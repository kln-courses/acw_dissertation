<plain_text><page sequence="1">VALERY'S 'POEMES ET PETITS POEMES ABSTRAITS': A GENERAL INTRODUCTION Despite the existence of such subtitles in the (Euvres as Poesie brute and Poesie perdue, Valery's poetic prose has hitherto attracted strangely little interest.1 The Cahiers classification assembling the 'Poemes et petits poemes abstraits',2 however, spans the greater part of Valery's creative life (1894-1945), and reveals a varied back- ground of themes and interests, including texts to be found in the Teste and Faust/Lust cycles, Melange ('Melange' and 'Poesie brute'), Tel Quel ('Croquis', 'Poesie perdue', and 'Mers'), the Histoires brisees, Eupalinos, and the Inspirations mediterraneennes of the Essais quasi politiques ( Variete). In any approach to the poetic prose texts of the Cahiers, this diversity must be placed in perspective against the simple fact of their recognition by Valery as an independent poetic type. An attempt will be made in this article to pinpoint the distinguishing features of the Poemes et PPA and, working outwards from those features, to consider some of the more speculative issues towards which they point. The initial and perhaps most far-reaching characteristic of the prose poetry of the Cahiers is that it is, by its very nature, a work of synthesis. The interaction of intellect and sensibility, often providing the creative spark of the texts, echoes the rich dialectic which forms the touchstone of so much fertile analysis in the Cahiers and other published works. The complementary nature of the two halves of individual perception, analysed in other contexts as 'Etre' and 'Connaitre', is echoed closely in the title itself, juxtaposing poetry and its concrete properties of imagery and rhythm with the rationality of abstract theorizing. A structural and thematic characteristic of many of the Poemes et PPA is the constant 'flow-on' they initiate between concrete and abstract perspectives, not merely within a given poem itself, but also in the wider context of the latter's link with the theoretical or practical considerations either preceding or following it. The transition between the two areas of perception is often effected in specific temporal and geographical conditions, when the dividing line between objects and their hidden abstract virtuality is blurred. Hence Valery's preference for the so-called 'Aubades'; it is often at dawn that objects appear the nearest to a domain where ossified conceptions of purpose or justification are radically displaced. The effectiveness of many such passages depends in large part on their brief notation, capturing the changing moments of a vision in metamorphosis. The integration of concrete and abstract elements can thus be 1 There are a number of exceptions to this. In particular, three early appreciations drew attention to the importance of the prose poetry in the encyclopaedic achievement of the Cahiers as a whole, and to its intrinsic literary value: J. Robinson, 'New Light on Valery', French Studies 22 (1968), 40-50;J. Robinson, L'Analyse de l'esprit dans les Cahiers de Valery (Paris, 1963), Chapter 9, 'Foi et mysticisme'; W. Ince, 'Etre, connaitre et mysticisme du reel selon Valery' in Entretiens sur Paul Valery (Paris, 1968). The following have appeared more recently: N. Celeyrette-Pietri, 'Au Commencement sera le Sommeil: quelques r6flexions sur un poeme en prose', in Cahiers Paul Valery I, 'Po6tique et poesie' (Paris, 1975); U.

Robinson, 'Reflexions sur les poemes en prose de Valery', Bulletin des Etudes Valeryennes, 23. 2 Throughout this study, the classification Poemes et petits poemes abstraits (Poemes et PPA) refers to the dossier published in the second volume of Paul Valery, Cahiers, edited byJ.

Ce cypres offre. Cette maison doree apparait - que fait-elle? Elle se CON- STRUIT a chaque instant. Ces monts se soulevent et ces arbres semblent offrir et attendre. Sous la lumiere naissante, tout chante et les choses divis6es de l'ombre designant la direction du soleil sont unisson. (Poemes et PPA, xII, I89) Anthropomorphic imagery (as in xxvII, 539: 'la lumiere fait balbutier leurs formes') and reflexive verbal forms combine in this poem to evoke the automatic spontaneity of nature. The latter is rendered also by the brevity of the opening syntactic units, in step with a creative vision attuned to moments of perception, and gradually increasing in length and phonetic complexity as the lyrical potential of isolated instants of experience is realized by the observer. Hence the final sentence where all things are perceived as 'singing' in unison, is also that part of the whole poem where assonance and alliteration are the most marked: 'tout chante' develop- ing naturally from the sound order in the first phrase (sous/naissante), and the rest of the sentence establishing an overall sound pattern which is closely dependent on the play of the fricatives [f], [z], and [s] (choses/divisees/designant/soleil/sont/ unisson), as also of the dental consonant [d] (divisees/de/designant/direction/du). But it is essentially the translation of moments of experience which is central to those texts of the Poemes et PPA picturing changing conditions: by immersion in instan- taneity as the only unit of time, the poet can arrive at a lyrical state embracing the whole in its constituent parts. In the poem ofxxII, 31 a pebble held in the palm of the hand becomes an image of totality, glimpsed in a unique instant of time ('Ce moment est au-dessus de tous les autres'). The tendency towards extreme reduction, applicable both to perception and to form, places strain on the process of composition, which must be similarly elliptical and compressed. But the effectiveness of those texts which relate the individual's experience to the multiplicity of objects and phenomena surrounding it, arises precisely from the expanding waves of imagery which can be generated when the nerve centre of any particular poetic moment is completely circumscribed. This ultimate point of precision is attained in a large number of texts; the passage occurring in xnI, 678 is typical: Chant cristallin de la Statue de Memnon Quand le soleil se revele et d'un rayon frappe / Quand le soleil bondit / moi de rosee lave - d'abord je murmure, cris infimes, puisje chante - Substance - crepite - Source - Soleil p[our] l'aveugle, et enfin la lumiere a tari la rosee, j'etincelle muet. It is the economy of composition which here communicates the lyrical purity suggested in the title. The emphasis on imagery of fiery reduction, rendering the glittering perfection of droplets or crystalline forms (chant cristallin / soleil / rosee / substance / crepite / lumiere / etincelle) is reflected closely in language itself, through the isolation of phrases and particularly poignant words, given greater significance by their independent placing. But what is particularly noteworthy in this text is the movement towards clarification, which the poem itself materializes in a very close association of form and content. In the concerted movement towards definition of a particular lyrical state, each syntactic unit, whether noun or phrase,</page><page sequence="3">R. PICKERING 8 7 contributes to the triumphant assertion of the closing affirmation, where the indistinct babble of nascent lyricism is transcended, and the accumulating image associations finally encapsulated. The last three words, with their sense of expan- siveness and commencement, both extend the poem and yet close it perfectly. A similar phenomenon occurs in a prose poem of Rimbaud, where the impressions of finitude and endless extension are fused in the isolation of the last three words: J'ai tendu des cordes de clocher a clocher; des guirlandes de fenetre a fenetre; des chaines d'or d'etoile a etoile, etje danse. ('Phrases', Illuminations) The will to define objects and situations thus often follows the path of the progressive accretion of words and images, in the poet's attempt to arrive at complete understanding of relevance or consistency. An interesting example of this means of composition occurs in x, 729: the description of a port (Le Havre) becomes the pretext for an extended study of the interplay of sight, sound, and smell. It is essentially the latter which dominates, the development of the final two paragraphs being signalled in the initial perception ('odeur lourde de fregate, de vieux bois flotte construite'). The isolated elements of a whole, yet to be delineated, follow one another in quick succession ('Cette odeur d'habitacle - vieux meubles - vieux bois - vieux sommeils, chambres fermees, flottantes, air epais'), each contributing to an overall impression. The uncertainty of the quest for the correct term is rendered in the heavy emphasis conferred on certain words; images jostle with one another as mind, language, and the senses concert to specify and denominate: je ne sais comment l'exprimer- le nez tatonne et tapote a travers les souvenirs et les mots cherchant la voie, l'expression, l'image exacte - Arrival at the point of total definition ('Charade de l'odorat, ton nom est creosote') spells the climax not only of the movement to specification but of the poem itself, since the latter is constructed with concatenating impressions, of which the final word constitutes the crowning element. The hint of the existence in the poet's mind of a semantic and linguistic field in which all elements are interrelated ('charade' conveniently symbolizing the system which the poem follows), is borne out in a comment in the Cahiers, taking as its subject the ordering of words and ideas in the course of composition: 'Autour d'une "idee" - d'un Mot - viennent par tropismes - quantite d'autres -, comme etrangers entre eux' (xxI, I58). The Poemes et PPA are often the vehicle for this process, which implies the existence of certain linguistic triggers or imaginatively 'loaded' themes, around which a series of words or phrases are spontaneously crystallized. Such words or phrases may be related consciously or unconsciously in the poet's mind; the important point is their very relation, forming a guiding criterion for the elaboration of a unified and coherent work. For just as in the realm of perception, where a privileged instant can give on to infinity, one of the major structural designs in the Poemes et PPA is to show that part implies whole, and poetic fragment a global system which validates it. In the course of an entry in the Cahiers where the constituents of the 'P[etit] P[oeme] Abst[rait]' are explored, Valery notes: II y a aussi cette g6enration par un fragment Cette 6trange formation v6egtale - Le fragment exige le tout et se le fait - ( , 575) (xxIv, 575) It is in this sense that the Poemes et PPA reflectjust as abiding a commitment to the art of suggestion and the evocative potential of language as the poetry in verse. We</page><page sequence="4">8i8 Valery's 'Poemes et petits poemes abstraits' can see this tendency clearly at work in such texts as x, 729 or XII, 678. Its significance lies principally in the very mode of its presentation, which demonstrates an essential principle of the poetic prose of the Cahiers: the wish to trace the inchoative and variable mechanism of the creative impulse itself. It is this unity of direction equating the artistic object with the actual process of its materialization which confers on the prose poetry an important element of its overall originality. The composition of poetry by recourse to a given interrelated linguistic field can, however, take the reverse direction, that of the gradual paring away of character- istics peripheral to the essence of any given experience. In using this method, Valery attempts to encapsulate an inner truth of existence by subjecting words to a process of specification. Thus in II, 186 the profusion of adjectives and nouns, following upon one another in rapid succession, helps to materialize the urgency of the poet's search for the ultimately appropriate term,3 which can only be circumscribed by the increasing refinement of its predecessors. The isolation of the concluding 'presence' concentrates our attention on the finality of a definitive linguistic precision, and substantiates with a stark immediacy the object to which normally it is only conventionally related: Etoile. Au ciel uni mat bleu sombre, a corps noir, - quelque chose infiniment douce, vive et elevee perce - accompagnee d'eclat, de distance, de puret6, penetration, finesse, isolement - presence. - Close examination of this key text reveals further structural elements character- istic of poetic technique in the Poemes et PPA as a whole. The first is Valery's receptiveness to the complex colour scheme and to tonal nuance, accurately analysed as if by the painter's eye,4 and highlighting the individual detail with which his vision and imagination are here impregnated. The second is the syntactic order created internally by the repetition of a basic ternary structure - the three adjectives ('douce, vive et elevee') prefiguring the three prepositional forms ('d'eclat, de distance, de purete'), which in turn precede the three substantives forming the penultimate stage of perception. The first ternary form thus motivates two others in analogical sympathy with it, as regards both form and meaning, the last three nouns signalling the last stage of interiorization of the whole experience. 3 An example of both tendencies followed in the search for the appropriate word, that of accumulating conditions and also of negation, occurs in the Cahiers classification Poisie (v, 58), where Valery outlines the properties and prerequisites of a word yet to be located. Of six successive conditions, five specify positive characteristics; yet Valery reinstates the importance of negation in the final emphasis and its suggestion of extreme finesse: 'Le poete cherche un mot qui soit: f6minin de deux syllabes contenant p ouf termine par une muette et synonyme de brisure, desagregation et pas savant, pas rare 6 conditions -au moins. Syntaxe, musique, regle des vers, sens, et tact!' 4 The tendency to analyse colour in the Poemes et PPA in terms of artistic technique is very evident (e.g. xvin, 277: 'mer pile . . . lavee avec beaucoup d'eau vers le bas du ciel'). A number of the prose poems where the essence of phenomena or objects is most abstractly suggested are accompanied by sketches in water colour or ink and wash, frequently painted with an arresting sensitivity to line and texture (e.g. xnI, 187; xI, i89; xn, 838; xIv, 797; xv, 644).</page><page sequence="5">R. PICKERING This increasingly personal emphasis conferred on the three paradigms of quality, feeling, and proportion abuts on 'isolement', before the poet seizes upon the one word whose imaginative resonance reaches out to embrace all the others: (quality) (feeling) (proportion) douce vive elevee purete eclat distance finesse penetration isolement A text which may thus appear to us as sketchy in technique and unmindful of traditional criteria of poetic form is in fact built upon a definite sense of internal order and coherence. But it is the technique of the creativejuxtaposition of opposites which is perhaps the most remarkable feature of this prose poem: the conjunction of relative specificity ('quelque chose') with absolute generality ('infiniment') is reflected further in the identification of presence with remoteness. The result may be initially disconcerting, but in the very process of rethinking concepts and responses, we are participating in the preliminary stages of renewed vision and understanding, which are at the core of Valery's poetic aims in the Poemes et PPA. The tendency to see the universe in terms of opposites (detail / whole, abstract / concrete) or of their interaction is hence a prerequisite for the gradual rediscovery of poetic essence in the object observed. It is the element of non-significance arising from the consequent personal disorientation which precipitates a renewed vision of the world. For the approach to an ever-deeper sense of pure being brings with it the consciousness of the total 'presence' of the object observed, which imposes itself pressingly upon the poet's gaze with the commanding weight of pure materiality: 'J'ai rencontre Notre- Dame - Je veux dire qu'elle m'est apparue tout a coup (comme je passais sur le quai) en objet inconnu - sans rapports anterieurs avec moi -' (Poemes et PPA, xvI, 509). Not all texts, however, present this radically strange experience of reality as illuminating. The happy coexistence of a sensuously-orientated bias to perception and an awareness of the abstract connotations lying dormant in the objects perceived, can be displaced by the brutally direct confrontation of mind and world. The dossier Langage5 develops in theoretical terms what the Poemes et PPA actually materialize in their sometimes hesitant and unfinished state, as reality imposes itself with an ever greater degree of structural alienation. One of the 'Psaumes'6 develops in ironically eloquent terms the impotence of language in communicating the complexity of thought; but in other passages, the self's suffering or despair can be expressed only in telegrammatic style, discovering in nature not a source of wonder but of inscrutability, and laying bare the supremacy of emotion over the rational directions of the mind: Mistral. Toute la mer dans le meme sens. Ennui - sub-desespoir. Solitudo..... Sur l'horizon des blocs de neige. Abattement excite - La plaie etrange r'ouverte. (Poemes et PPA, xi, 802) The difficulty involved in rendering the complexity of sensation and thought can nevertheless itself become a powerful springboard to poetic richness. The S Langage, II, 554: 'A mesure qu'on s'approche du reel, on perd la parole.' 6 Poemes et PPA, ix, 56: 'Les memes mots sont vides et vains qui sont aussi des armes vivantes, des organes de connaissance, de prise, et dejouissance, des instruments et des actes de possession, des tresors et des clefs de tresors, des vases et les breuvages extraordinaires qu'ils contiennent, des lumieres et aussi des yeux.' 819</page><page sequence="6">820 Valery's 'Poemes et petits poemes abstraits' apprehension of the essence of a given phenomenon, object, or emotion is dependent on an extreme receptiveness to silence, and the failure fully to express the poetic tension between 'Etre' and 'Connaitre', complete sensuous integration and abstrac- tion, is often the very spot where a given text attains its most moving lyrical tonality. This unexpected poetic source acts as compensation for the inevitable deficiencies in purity of perception, and often substantiates in an intensely suggestive way the state of speechless delight in the inherent necessity of things, simply through the unorthodox typographical arrangement of words, dislocated grammatical struc- ture, the innovatory use of punctuation, and the frequent recourse to a particularly expressive kind of textual pause. Among many texts of this type, the poem contained in XI, 622 is of special interest. The passage is typical in its hesitancy, rendering the wonder of the mind as it tries to express an extraordinary moment of experience: 0 ou P.P.A. J'ecoute l'oiseau invisible dans la structure doree, sombre, immobile de ce queje vois du parc. J'ecoute, j'coute et ce quej'ecoute - une fois d6pass6e l'id6e de chant d'oiseau, - et les comparaisons etc. et tout ce qui voudrait se substituer, aller outre, etje ne trouve que l'inexplicable en soi, le bruit, la sensation impenetrable ... comme une couleur Langage - Etat- Beneath the dependence on acuity of feeling, and the sloughing off of any kind of metrical or stylistic constraint, we cannot but be aware, as in ii, I86 ('Etoile'), of a sense of proportion and inner structural continuity. The three substantive forms of 'l'inexplicable en soi, le bruit, la sensation impenetrable', generalized and abstract as they are, follow naturally on from the similarly three-fold adjectival construction preceding them ('la structure doree, sombre, immobile'), and the triple repetition of the entranced state of listening ('J'ecoute, j'ecoute et ce que j'ecoute'). The poet suggests evocatively in this way the constant flow-on and cross-fertilization uniting opposed psychic tendencies and the modes of perception (feeling, sight, and sound) in which they are embodied. The positioning of the text is significant in this regard; for the uncertainty of classification, already wavering on the borderline between Theta and PPA, is further attested in a development on language introduced by the last line, and analysing vowels and consonants in relation to form and content. But what particularly strikes us is the paradoxical tangibility of the immaterial, made perceptible in the flow of negatives which characterize the mind's groping attempt at self-expression: 'invisible',7 'immobile', 'une fois depassee l'idee et les comparaisons, et tout ce qui voudrait se substituer', 'l'inexplicable','impenetrable'. It is only after the poet has shed various points of reference that the extraordinary synaesthetic8 leap into enlightenment can take place in the penultimate line. The prior recourse to negation can alone validate the final return to the very comparative means (comme une couleur) which were initially rejected, now purged of all suspicion of the 7 The underlining of this word and of those immediately following is my own. Unless specifically acknowledged, all underlining in texts quoted is that of Valery. 8 The mingling of different senses in perception is a preferred technique of the Poemes et PPA (e.g. i, 722: 'Le soleil fond et se liqu6fie, se deverse sur les d6mes et les tuiles'; IV, 462: 'Cela chante, au lieu de les compter, les heures. Liquidement, avec une liqueur infinie tintent ces notes'; x, 4. 'Les oiseaux ... taillent des cris dans l'inoui'; xxI, I64: 'Ces formes sur quoi la main de l'oeil passe et qu'elle 6prouve').</page><page sequence="7">R. PICKERING extraneous or inappropriate and, at the moment of apparently deepest impenetra- bility, communicating a palpable sense of mass, a paradoxically positive feeling for elemental presence. The creation of a positive state from a very negative one is a characteristic of those lyrical texts which are most finely attuned to the sounds of silence. In a sense, this tendency is entirely logical, for it is only through the prior removal of atrophied ways of looking at reality that the latter can finally be experienced in its fundamental strangeness. In this respect, the movement towards the perception of the essence of things pursues a path closely akin to the particular method followed by scholastic mysticism in attempting to arrive at a definition of the divine: the 'via negativa'.9 Valery's wrestling with words in an attempt to describe the sensations of purity and ethereality arising from the self's perception of dawn can be placed in the same perspective as the efforts of Meister Eckhart and a whole mystical tradition, endeavouring logically to explain concepts which in lesser hands might simply be imputed to intuition. Yet even those texts in which objects or phenomena are presented in their ultimate irreducibility are rarely aimed consciously at conceptual elaboration or dialectic. Many are very skeletal, constituting merely the preliminary to deep perception, or seemingly abandoned in a state of stylistic suspension. Yet the Poemes et PPA dossier takes the texts such as they are from the Cahiers manuscripts, with no attempt to heighten them stylistically. It is precisely in this discrepancy of style, distinguishing the poetic prose of the Cahiers from the poetry in verse, as also from those texts in poetic prose which are prepared for publication during the poet's lifetime,10 that the former's individuality is most evident. In their sometimes hesitant tone, the texts differ profoundly from more rhetorically or metrically sophisticated works, for they concentrate primarily on rendering that 'profondeur de l'apparence' which lies at the threshold of renewed perception (Po?mes et PPA, xn, 190). The resulting stupefied silence of the self re-establishes the poet's contact with the world, but it also threatens to engulf the creative interaction of intellect and sensibility which gave birth to it. Increased difficulty in expression springing from enhanced perceptive awareness itself, constitutes the characteristically exploratory and yet potentially disruptive dimension of the Poemes et PPA. Variations in confidence of expression in the poetic prose, however, cannot be imputed exclusively to the sense of alienation which is crucial to true perception. Many of the texts, where acquaintance with things brings about a sudden sense of estrangement, are infused with a dynamic optimism, particularly those devoted to a description of specific towns or places (Poemes et PPA, Iv, 463-64: 'Heureux celui que l'ecriture soulage! l'homme repond de toutes ses reponses, s'exonere par tous moyens. Dessine, peint, - surexcite son dictionnaire'). The unfinished nature of the Poemes et PPA raises rather more the question of Valery's attitude to the perfectibility of language, an issue which is central to a critical appreciation of the poetic prose, and one which would appear to invalidate that very 'poetique' conferring on the 9 This aspect has been developed by N. Bastet in 'L'Experience de la borne et du d6passement', in Cahiers Paul Valery i (Paris, 1975), pp. 64 ff. 10 Four prose poems ('Avant toute chose', 'L'Unique', 'Accueil dujour', 'La Rentree') appeared under the title of'Petits poemes abstraits' in the Revue de France in 1932 ( 2e annee, no. I, pp. 47-52). Other prose poems (the first three letters of the projected 'Alphabet', A.B.C., were published in the review Commerce in I925 (the first poem is reproduced in Cahiers Paul Valery I (Paris, 1975), pp. 21 i-2: 'Au commencement sera le sommeil'). 82I</page><page sequence="8">822 Valery's 'Poemes et petits poemes abstraits' better-known poetry in verse its full creative resonance. 'Un poeme n'est jamais acheve' (CEuvres, II, 553): Valery's advocacy of stylistic heightening speaks clearly enough, and the unremitting labour devoted to works such as 'Le Cimetiere marin' or La Jeune Parque would suggest that it is followed closely in the process of creation. Yet we have just seen no less a fundamental commitment in the prose poetry to the irreducible and the elemental, to a process of elaboration dependent less on constant perfecting than on the sudden unexpected spark which instils poetic value into abstract idea, and animates the images and themes internally. The uncoordinated jottings of poetic prose throughout the Cahiers are in disconcerting contradiction to the abiding preoccupation with transition and modulation as 'poetic gifts', expounded in such dossiers as Poesie and Ego Scriptor. Indeed, the Poemes et PPA materialize one pole of a contrast Valery establishes more generally, between the organic unity of'poeme' and the ambivalent relationship the latter entertains with a vision of the poetic process orientated towards fragmentation and discontinuity: En somme, ce qu'on appelle un poeme se compose pratiquement de fragments de poesie pure enchasses dans la matiere d'un discours. Un tres beau vers est un element tres pur de poesie. La comparaison banale d'un beau vers a un diamant fait voir que le sentiment de cette qualite de purete est dans tous les esprits. ((Euvres, I, 1457) The question of the 'poetry' of the largely formless texts in prose which constitute the Poemes et PPA dossier, is closely linked to the distinction established here between the fused agglomerate of the 'poem' itself and the 'beaux details' which individually comprise it (Poesie, vi, 687). In addition to mere considerations of metre and rhythm, Valery's understanding of form includes a fundamentally dynamic connotation. Reverting to the etymological 'poiein' of poetry, he comes to see the notion of the 'object made' as being of far less importance than the continuity of movement through which it is constructed: 'Plus me chaut le faire que son objet. C'est le faire qui est l'ouvrage, l'objet a mes yeux . .' (Poietique, xnI, 657). Thus a link is posited, which would make a form not so much a delimited structural contour as an evolving system of variations and contrasts, implying both a constant awareness of aesthetic equilibrium and the inventive participation of the intellect. The tension which is inbuilt in such a concept is one with which Valery scholars will be familiar: the pursuit of a goal, of a form to be apprehended, implies finitude and immutability, yet the very law of continuing progression animating the movement threatens to render this goal impracticable. When considering art in general, Valery often places emphasis on the notion of uninterrupted dynamic variation (Euvres, II, 1362: 'concevoir comme une oeuvre d'art l'execution d'une euvre d'art'). Such a concept is fraught with difficulty for the artist attempting above all to define and delineate creative impulses. Not even attainment of the perfect artistic object can compensate for the movement of continuous transmutation to which it puts an end: 'Un chef-d'oeuvre me semblait une restriction, une demonstration, un exercice' (Gladiator, xvI, 698). Valery summarizes: Les actes et les oeuvres sont necessairement moindres que le possible queje represente .... Ils sont retires de la variabilite .... Quelques [sic] soient les vertus d'une chose, elle a q[uel] q[ue] chose d'incomplet des qu'elle est complete. Ce qui est, et est acheve perd une qualite infinie. (vIII, 828) Despite the emphatic nature of Valery's espousal of such variability, the ramifica- tions of the potential dilemma touch upon many spheres of creative endeavour, but</page><page sequence="9">R. PICKERING nowhere more so than in the specific domain of poetry and of stylistic alteration. For it is the very notion of the 'finished' text which is thus radically questioned - all poetic material, at whatever stage, becoming 'matiere a tripoter, a corriger et toujours un etat entre autres' (xxvI, 732). The poetry in verse, of fixed form and metrical structure, bears eloquent witness to this tendency. La Jeune Parque, for example, in appearance so smoothly and coherently structured, demonstrates by the hesitancy of its differing plans and its host of variants, how the 'poeme' is in fact an aggregate of elements of'poesie pure'.11 Florence de Lussy's study of the genesis of the poem12 shows that such elements are progressively linked together by modula- tion between differing thematic and semantic levels, and that the 512 lines of text represent as close as possible a reconciliation of the two tendencies as Valery's own changing conception of the overall nature of the poem would allow.13 It might be objected that, in their fragmented and sometimes unfinished state, the texts of the Cahiers written in poetic prose are hardly comparable with the elements of 'poesie pure' together forming the text of La Jeune Parque. To conclude thus, however, would be to discount evidence of the compactness and versatility of the poems, rarely pared for greater density when used elsewhere as parts of more extended works.14 'Toute poesie git dans le commencement, ou plutot est tout le temps un commencement' (xxiv, 862); by virtue of their very concentration, we cannot but view many of the passages as a creative core, whose imagery is susceptible of development in many directions. The Poemes et PPA are closely akin to this raw material, from which the framework of longer works is eventually constructed. We can in fact pinpoint here two general tendencies which allow us to situate the poetic prose more adequately in relation to its frequent disregard for regularity in fixed structure and form. Firstly, the process of creation by modulation and linkage, uppermost in the poetry in verse, gives place 1 One of the Poimes et PPA (xxv, 107) is inspired directly by one such element: 'Divers Gemissement dans la nuit -'Qui pleure 1a .. .?' Chat, femme ou brise - Ou la vie, telle quelle Gemit avant lejour D'etre ce qu'elle est.' 12 F. de Lussy, La Genese de La Jeune Parque (Paris, 1975). ProfessorJ. Robinson's article in Poetique 37 ( 1979), 'L'architecture ouverte de La Jeune Parque', is similarly devoted to this tendency. 13 See the letter written to Albert Mockel (Lettres a quelques-uns, pp. 1 22-25): 'II y a de graves lacunes dans l'exposition et la composition. Je n'ai pu me tirer de l'affaire qu'en travaillant par morceaux. Cela se sent, etj'en sais trop sur mes d6faites! De ces morceaux, il en est un qui, seul, represente pour moi le poeme que j'aurais voulu faire. Ce sont les quelques vers qui commencent ainsi: "0 n'aurait-il fallu, folle, etc.".'

Hence those many texts in which time appears to stand still, with the self immersed in the object of its contemplation - the 'poesie illumination', operative on all levels of the creative imagination. Such, for example, is the text in iv, 19, where an entire landscape is perceived as 'un systeme momentane' whose extreme fragility is easily shattered ('toutes choses etaient de la meme nature et fragilite - Tout se reduisant a unjeu d'eclairage, un peu de plus ou de moins et tout changeait'). But more important is the degree of cohesive unity which sometimes emerges from this arrested development, capable of reconciling the law of constant intellectual change within the limits of a specific literary object - Valery's so-called 'univers ferme'. The concordance of idea and even choice of words in 'Toute belle oeuvre est chose fermee. Rayonne muette' (xii, I55) with the general tone of the 'Chant cristallin de la Statue de Memnon' (Poemes et PPA, xuI, 678) is remarkable, the final words, as we have seen, operating a process of closure and yet telescoping extension: 'j'etincelle muet'. It is this sense of glittering irreducibility which is central to the text's poetic message. In a work combining progressive mutation with a will towards close circumscription, Valery attains a degree of synthesis where form and the progression towards it are no longer in conflict. The increased power of suggestion stemming from the very condensation of language thus acts as a highly effective vehicle for the incoming and outgoing characteristics in which the poet sees an important mainspring of poetic energy.15 In the midst of artlessness itself, the prose poetry of the Cahiers can achieve in this way a high degree of linguistic and thematic integration, constructing a closed system in which mind and senses are in complete harmony. For the orientation of 'faire' can tend less towards an endless progression than, as in xni, 678, towards its inclusion in the object of its own making, a step in the course of which it is the poet's own active commitment to dynamic construction which is increasingly questioned. The many freely lyrical poems of the Cahiers reflect these changes in Valery's criteria for form in poetry, occasionally integrating the dynamism of'poiein' in the object which the latter actually constructs. Yet the fragmentary, independent nature of the texts adds a new perspective to his changing view of the 'complete' work, and its relation to the author himself. It has been suggested above that, as opposed to verse, attuned to laws of constant variation, the prose poetry homes in acutely on the functional and structural essence of reality, dislocating its surface characteristics and confounding our expectations of significance. It is this instantaneous, unchang- ing quality of perception which prompts the movement towards the growing independence of poet and poem, since time and space no longer bind the self to its existential relativity, and to the vicissitudes of the act of writing. It is significant that one of the Poemes et PPA (xIv, 785) actually celebrates the power of the mind to distance itself from the distracting material paraphernalia which dog the desire to 15 Poesie, xiv, 76: 'Diamant- ... le tailleur de diamants faconne les facettes de maniere que le rayon qui penetre dans la gemme par une facette ne peut sortir que par la mime - Feu et eclat.

PICKERING 825 create,16 and places typical emphasis on the instantaneous nature of the mind's experience. This distancing may be achieved, but at the same time the work in its turn is seen by Valery to assume an imperviousness to subsequent attempts by the self to intervene or modify. The intellect, anxious to find the ultimately non- significant work of art, in the end must relinquish its hold over the beautiful object it has created: Faire une belle oeuvre, c'estfaire quelque chose qui se place enfin hors dufaire . .. Ce qui est ainsi produit . . . exige donc l'idee (vague et ravissante) d'une categorie a part. (xxI, 444) Commentaries of this kind tend to occur in the later Cahiers, where the notion of structure as something fixed rather than as evolving from constant change re- establishes its ascendancy over the poet's imagination, and brings inevitable changes in the creative artist's situation relative to the work he creates. The opposition between the two becomes the paradoxical measure of the success attained in reconciling the original tension between definitive structure and the intellectual and perceptual mechanism producing it. In characteristic conformity with the basic analogy he establishes between poetic structure and diamond or crystal, it is to the mineral world that Valery has recourse, in defining the consequent impotence of the intellect: Mysterieux et acheve (ou parfait) comme un caillou. Impossible a annuler par utilite, par un conte, par l'idee d'un auteur, par la sensation meme d'une volonte, d'une intention ... Ceci emprunte leferie de la sensibilite pure. (xx, 557) The diamond-like limpidity of the perfected poetic form can change to an impenetrability defying further attempts at analysis and intervention. Hence the sometimes melancholy tone, underscoring poetic prose devoted ostensibly to a paean of the intellect, but expressed in conditional and subjunctive terms (Poemes et PPA, xxiv, 3: 'J'aurais voulu te vouer a former le cristal de chaque chose, ma Tete- et que tu divises le desordre que presente l'espace et que developpe le temps . .. ') or appearing in those texts where perfection is perceived to equate to instantaneous degradation, and is related to the anguished consciousness of the human predica- ment: Ecoute, mon Seigneur, ce que chante ce moment par la fenetre ouverte ... Le parfait se detruit soi-mime. Quoi de plus destructeur que lui! Le fruit engendre le ver, et le zenith, le Nadir. (xxII, 291) In a number of texts the poet posits not only the modification of the author by the work realized, but his entire reconstruction (vi, 818: 'Et quand [l'ceuvre] est achevee ... [l'auteur] se fait (par exemple) celui qui a ete capable de l'engendrer. Il reconstruit en quelque sorte un formateur de l'ensemble realise'). The limit so prejudicial to the creation of a valid and durable form can be transcended, but at the expense of the author's own autonomy or individual identity:' ... instrument qui a cesse de servir. L'ceuvre parfaite se debarrasse de son auteur' (xxix, 470). To see the neglect of the PPA corpus in this light, its importance overshadowed by works where the bond linking creator and creation is less strained, would be to take 16 Poemes et PPA xiv, 785: 'Mon regard prend et laisse la tempete, se fixe sur un point d'esprit qu'ilfait parler en moi, pendant un instant; revient au ciel embrouille. Que de choses et de travaux ont enfin permis que la pensee puisse a l'abri, durer, s'assouplir, se perdre, se retrouver et prolonger, prendre puissance, n'etre pas une 6chappee entre deux soucis de mon corps.'</page><page sequence="12">826 Valery's 'Poemes et petits poemes abstraits' Valery's theoretical pronouncements too far; nor, indeed, can all the Poemes et PPA be described as 'perfect' creations. But we are quite justified in concluding that the problematic conflict of views in the elaboration of structure assumes its full practical dimension in aiding us to grasp the poetic basis of texts written in prose, and in indicating to us the real nature of their contrasting relationship to Valery's poetics, such as it is materialized in the poetry in verse. Any introduction to the abstract poetic prose of the Cahiers must in the first instance come to terms with this seeming inversion of his own poetic rules and criteria by Valery himself. At one end of the spectrum, poetry is characterized by its peculiarly inchoative derivation as 'work in progress'; yet it is in the nature of a number of the lyrical prose texts to suggest the passage beyond a critical point, that where, in a more conventional context of poetry in verse, integration and modulation from section to section prove highly problema- tic.17 In such instances, mind and senses open on to a whole new visionary experience, even if, as with the divine,18 they can express the all-pervading sense of exaltation only through negatives, or in the hesitancy of the conditional: On se parlerait sans paroles. La nuit pourrait venir I y aurait quelque chose de plus - dans ce qui n'est pas visible. (On serait bien autre chose 'qu'heureux'). (xvI, 534) The 'wordless language' retains an element of the uncertain, but in the very act of its still doubtful utterance, the imperceptible is made tangible. There is no attempt in subsequent Cahiers to modify style and imagery; a highly complex situation is rendered in its immediacy, attaining to such a degree of synthesis of content and structure that the text is originally classified by Valery as 'Poeme', 'Eros', and 'Theta'. The spanning of different areas of experience, and the overall cohesion arising from roughly-composed texts, come increasingly to be the indicators of a mystical rarefication of the powers of perception, to which the interest taken late in the poet's life in the works of StJohn of the Cross is a tangible pointer. The semantic opacity which can sometimes be generated by the systematic confrontation of mutually irreconcilable characteristics or conditions19 indicates a conscious attempt 17 An interesting example of the difficulties involved in modulation occurs in LaJeune Parque, in the poet's changing attitude to the poetic representation of the theme of suicide, and its climactic point, the scream. The theme of death has been emphasized as commanding a central position in Valery's own reading of the poem (J. Robinson, 'Un nouveau visage de La Jeune Parque', in Bulletin des Etudes Valeryennes, no. 25, p. 51). Florence de Lussy gives an outline of some of the differing versions (and hence attitudes) of this point of extreme tension in the poem, by its very nature attaining a summum of emotional intensity, and posing very considerable problems of subsequent poetic progression (F. de Lussy, pp. 41, 97-98). The text as it stands represents an attenuation of the original theme, and suppresses the more extreme elements of the emotional substratum. 18 Theta, xx, 489: '0- Relligio- Le Dieu, lieu des negations - In-fini In-comparable In-ef-fable Im-materiel In-cr6e In-concevable.' 19 Theta/Poemes et PPA, xxi, 87-7 I; 'Pourquoi avoir nomm6 Dieu?

PICKERING to move beyond traditional registers of expression. Hence the recurrent features in much of the lyrical prose, of oxymoron and unexpected stylistic juxtaposition or contrast, which disconcert our responses and force us to reformulate them, in step with the poet as he gingerly sounds out ground untrodden before. The attempt to increase the range of language is by no means unique to Valery. Rimbaud had been similarly investigative ('Delires', Une Saison en enfer: 'J'ecrivais des silences, des nuits, je notais l'inexprimable'). But rarely before had such commitment to the expressive power of words been so closely implicated in the reformulation of notions of poetry, as also in the dynamic forces motivating the prerequisite synthesis of sensibility and awareness. The moments of total space/time reciprocity prolong the critical point of poetic progression in a suspension of all rational or intuitive faculties - that 'seuil de l'eternel' (Eros/Poemes et PPA, xxIV, 22) where the poem of the search for form overcomes the contradiction inherent in its own nature and, like the statue of Memnon, mutely radiates its essence. One indication of those privileged moments when the instant is prolonged, instead of mercurially vanishing in the act of its possession, can be perceived in style itself, at those points in the lyrical prose texts where greater difficulty of expression leads to an apparent roughness of conception and unevenness of texture. This impression of hastiness is sometimes the paradoxical measure of the success of such prose poems, in reconciling the fundamental contradiction opposing structural development to the very structure which the progression presupposes. It is for this reason that the many lyrical love poems occupy so significant a place in the poetic prose of the Cahiers, for they celebrate the critical instant in the act of love when the latter either turns irrevocably in upon itself,20 or expands into a state of total felicity, to include the 'other'.21 At the moment of culmination, of the transgression of limits of perception, it is the practicability of a linguistic means of communication which must inevitably be tested to the extreme. On occasion the prose poet capitulates, and the text either trails off into silence22 or merges organically with the sketches and watercolours of the artist. These moments of creative 'imbrication', linking different artistic media, confirm us in the belief that the progression to form constitutes both a radical questioning of the classically 'finished' work and of its relationship to the rough perception from which it is drawn, as also of the communicative norms by which it is subsequently expressed. The poetic prose texts of the Cahiers act as vehicle in this exploratory process, 20 Poemes et PPA, I, 222: 'Etreinte toute du bien et du mieux, lutte qui se gonfle, Melange; seul, on redevient; seul, on s'6elve Seul on ne pense plus, seul on veut, seul on est. 21 Eros, xxiv, 660: 'Actes de l'amour compares a ceux des executants d'orchestre- qu'il ne faut confondre avec la musique. 'Amour' -Etat chantant total.' 22 There are a number of unfinished texts in poetic prose, usually to be found in the Poemes et PPA (e.g. xi, 35; xvmI, 177); but such texts can also be found in other dossiers which are at times lyrically orientated, e.g. Eros, xvII, 4Io: 'C'est alors que - avant l'aube et si tard dans l'existence parut ce qui n'existe que 827</page><page sequence="14">828 Valery's 'Poemes et petits poemes abstraits' complementing the poetry in verse, yet at the same time differing radically from it in terms of lyrical directions and priorities. The gentle ironies underlying the publica- tion in 1941 of passages of'Poesie brute' by a poet for whom 'recherches volontaires' and the 'consentement de l'ame a des genes exquises'23 are the inescapable requirements of his art, should alert us to their hitherto largely neglected significance.
