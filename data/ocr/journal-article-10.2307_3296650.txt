<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROMAN RELIGION AND ETHICAL THOUGHT: ABSTRACTION AND PERSONIFICATION 1. The Beginnings T HE BEGINNINGS of Roman abstract thought lie in religion and specifically in the personification of abstractions.1 Roman ideas are not isolated concepts. They occur in a social context and acquire meaning from the use to which they are put in that context. One of the most important of these contexts is religion. It is extremely difficult to trace the process of abstraction in any form of Roman culture. Rome reached a high level of self-consciousness in her development so quickly that there is little evidence of her struggle toward intellectual maturity. "The Romans stepped almost from primitive animism to sophistication, and presently to sk pticism " wrote Tenney Frank.2 "When the Romans appear in history, it is well past the primitive stage," is H. Wagenvoort's comment on the same subject.3 We are faced with the necessity of reasoning from late phenomena in religion backward to the sources of Roman abstract thought. It is one of the most important problems in the history of Roman ideas to under- stand the deified abstracts or divinized ideas which we find established in cult-worships as early as the fourth century B.C. at Rome. The problem falls into many phases: What exactly are these concepts? How did they originate? How old are they? When and in what contexts are they abstracts of a truly philosophic nature, as distinct from exclu- sively deified personifications, or the creations of poetic imagination more closely related to allegory? We must try to distinguish if possible between numina, "virtues," and mere concepts, and to determine the amount of Greek influence which has been brought to bear on them. There are four major areas in which the concepts appear: 1. cult, 2. myth, 3. poetry, and 4. art, including coins. Some are closer to being genuine divinities in their 1 The most complete treatments of the subject are the following: L. Deubner, "Personifika- tionen abstrakter Begriffe," in W. H. Roscher, Ausfiibrliches Lexikon der griecbiscben und romiscben Mytbologie (Leipzig 1902-1909), III.ii, p. 2068-2169, which deals with the evidence in cult, myth, poetry, and art; F. St6ssl, "Personifikationen," RE 19 (Stuttgart 1937), p. 1042-1058; and Harold L. Axtell, The deification of abstract ideas in Roman literature and inscriptions (Chi- cago 1907), still the most complete and satisfactory treatment. Other discussions are less thorough: R. Engelhard, De personificationibus quae in poesi atque arte Romanorum inveniuntur (G6ttingen University diss. 1881), about which see Georg Wissowa, Religion und Kultus der Rimer (Munich 1902), p. 50 ("... genuigt in keiner Hinsicht"); and Axtell, op. cit., p. 68 ("He fails, however, to draw any distinction between fact and fancy."). Georg Wissowa discussed personified Roman ideas in the work referred to above at p. 46-50 and 271-280 (new edition, 1912, at p. 52-55 and 327-338). Kurt Latte's treatment in his Romische Religionsgeschichte (Munich 1960), p. 233-242, is brief and, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A valuable collection of references is found in A. S. Pease's edition of Cicero, De natura deorum, II (Cambridge, Mass. 1958), p. 692-693, and separate ideas discussed in other passages passim. The separate articles on abstractions in Pauly-Wissowa, Roscher-Preller, and the Thesaurus Lingua Latinae must also be consulted. The discussion in Ludwig Preller, R omisc/be Mythologie, II (Berlin 1883), p. 178-268, is still worth reading. 2 Liji' and literature in the Roman republic (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1930), p. 11. 3 Roman dLynamisml : studies in ancient Roman thought, language and custom (Oxford 1947), p. 3.</page><page sequence="2">ROMAN RELIGION AND ETHICAL THOUGHT 109 worship; others are drawn from a god's attributes and separate powers (numina).4 Among the Greeks, who were the first to make cult-worships of abstractions, they were gods to begin with and only later became abstractions; the reverse process was characteristic of the Romans: these divinities were first abstractions and later became gods among them. The Roman divinized concepts, in general, however, did not become fully personalized, remaining colorless and characterless.5 Finally, the invari- able index of a true personified abstract is the existence of a cult in its honor. Typical Greek personifications are TbvX7, ,pwC, vitrl, bjpdvota (which has its close relationships with the Roman Concordia), &amp;per-77, nretOW, StKatooavrl, owT7pia, Katp6q, IeraeaJXeta, po, 6oXeoq, a6c4w, q9 /pI77, bp/779, EijKXeta, e bvopia, 7or't, SIwarov , ye'Xwc , fia, IavydKrl?, 6iKr7, eb~i4oeta, and etpivrl, with 6i'poc and SrlloKpaTria as political personifications. Their cults are rarely due to an historical incident as a cause of origin as is often the case among the Romans. The imagination of the Greek poets played upon these concepts and transformed them into entities of uncertain nature, such as &amp;irt, which often changes in its associations from Homer onwards. She is the daughter of Zeus in Iliad 19.91, but the daughter of Eris in Hesiod, Theogony 230. Hesiod is the first Greek author to use abstracts in quantity, followed by Aeschy- lus and, to some degree, Pindar. Sophocles and Euripides use them less colorfully than Aeschylus does. The Orphics and Pythagoreans and, among individual pre-Socratics, Parmenides, employ them, as do the rhetoricians of the fifth century B.C. The personi- fications of Old Comedy have no connection with religious cult and are regarded by Deubner as dramatic allegory. Little evidence of the use of personified abstracts is found in Hellenistic poetry, although Stoic philosophy, in its seven Ei677 OewCv and its treatment of the years, months, and seasons employs them in materialized forms (Cicero, De natura deorum 1.14.36).6 Roman abstractions arise against a Greek background and are apparently quite early in their origin, although "the realization of the personality of the god was never as vivid among the Romans as among the Greeks, aided, as they were, by the imaginative genius of their poets and sculptors."7 There is little doubt that deified abstractions belong to a very early stage in Roman religion; this is borne out by a study of the numina, or divine powers, by the fact that primitive Roman elements are mingled with advanced elements as they are in modern religions,8 and by the fact that the cults of 4 L.

Rose, Primitive culture in Italy (London 1926), p. 44; Jean Bayet, Histoire politique et psychologique de la religion romaine (Paris 1957), .p. 44; and by Wagenvoort, p. 73-82, who takes it as equivalent to the mana of modern primitive tribes. Numen means an impersonal force exerted by a god. It is possibly influenced by the Stoic use of b6vaLgtc (Latte, p. 57). Weinstock points out that it appears first in Accius, frg. 646, 691 Ribbeck3. 5 L. Deubner, p. 2070. He realized the paradox which exists in the necessity of ruling out fully personalized divinities such as Hebe, Themis, Hygieia from a discussion of Greek and Roman personified abstracts and how difficult it is to draw the line among them. 6 Op. cit., p. 2106; cf.

Mommsen, The history of Rome I (Everyman's edition), p. 166: "The religion of Rome had nothing of its own presenting even a remote resemblance to the religion of Apollo investing earthly morality with a halo of glory, etc." 8 Mattingly, art. cit. 106: "... the 'Virtues' have their place in a very early stratum of Roman religion." See Axtell, p. 64: "... the direct evidence, incomplete as it is, tends to show that as far back as the agricultural stage of the Romans they deified res expetendae." P. 66: ". . . the deifica- tion of virtues and ethical conceptions is simply a developed stage of the religious bent of the earliest Roman." (italics mine). Warde Fowler, The religious experience of the Roman people (London 1911), p. 285, agrees.</page><page sequence="3">110 L. R. LIND Fortuna and Fides, among the oldest of the abstracts, were traced by tradition back to Servius Tullius (or Ancus Marcius) and to Numa, respectively. Axtell, in his excellent study of Roman personified abstractions (which no later writer on the subject seems to utilize), has conveniently arranged the establishment of the cults they represent in chronological order, under the headings, I. State-cults, II. Popular but unofficial cults, and III. Occasional and individual deifications. Fortuna, or more properly, Fors Fortuna, was honored among Republican divinities with two temples, one on the Via Portuensis and the other in the Forum Boarium. She was probably imported from the Italic communities near Rome in the time of Servius Tullius or Ancus Marcius. Concordia received her first temple from the dictator Camil- lus in 367 B.C., the first reliable date in the sequence of cult-establishments. Salus, a second Italic import, appears upon the Quirinal in a temple founded in 302 B.C.; she is one of the most important of the abstracts. Victoria comes next, in 294 B.C., with a temple on the Palatine; hers is also a native Italic cult, worshipped by the Sabines under the name Vacuna. Spes comes upon the scene in 258, during the First Punic War. Fides, the concept of good-faith, gained her first temple on the Capitol in 254 or 250, although tradition assigned her establishment to Numa or the Sabines. Honos, associated chiefly with war, was vowed a temple during the war with the Ligurians in 233. Ops did not possess a sanctuary until the third century, but was worshipped in the Regia by the Vestal Virgins and is "the oldest of the abstracts and perhaps the only one native to the ancient Romans."9 Libertas had a temple built for her before 238 by a man named Gracchus, and Mens received a cult upon the Capitol in 215 as the bestower of intelligence much needed after the tragic military error at Lake Trasimenus in 217; she seems to have had a worship also in Paestum and was associated with Venus Erycina, evidence of Greek origin. Cicero clearly respected Mens and lists it as an abstract worthy of honor. Virtus exemplified courage in battle and was thus an ancient idea; but her altar at Rome, dedicated by P. Scipio Africanus Minor, dates only from 134, after the capture of Numantia. Virtus and Bellona were goddesses of war and are often linked. Among other abstracts luventas appears in 191, Pollentia in 187, Pietas in 181, Felicitas in 151, and Bonus Eventus at least before 54 B.C.10 A number of these Republican divinized concepts or values had more than one temple and continued to be wor- shipped during the Empire, when other new abstracts received their cults as well. Wissowa classified Concordia, Spes, Pietas, and the Imperial abstracts Aequitas, Aeternitas, Copia, Abundantia, lustitia, Pudicitia (as the divinity of a woman who has been married to only one man), Pax, Securitas, Clementia, Indulgentia, Providentia, Fecunditas, Disciplina, Patientia, and a number of others certified by Imperial coins or cults as "completely freely created abstractions," most of which (with the exception of Virtus and Spes) give rise to other closely related subsidiary deified abstracts.11 After pointing out that no new abstract deities appear during the last century of the 9 Axtell, p. 22. 10 See Wissowa, (1902 ed.), p. 215-216 on Bonus Eventus. Latte does not even mention this abstract in his R omische Religionsgeschichte. The first temple of Virtus was dedicated in 205 B.C., according to Cicero, De natura deorum 2.61. 11 Op. cit., p. 271-280.</page><page sequence="4">ROMAN RELIGION AND ETHICAL THOUGHT 111 Republic (that is, the age of Cicero, a fact worthy of mention in view of Cicero's discussions of the abstracts in De natura deorum), Axtelll2 lists the Imperial abstracts in accordance with Wissowa's series, including Annona and Tutela: "new life was infused into abstract deifications, as men saw in them a special means of flattery to the ruler."13 We do not have sufficient chronological data with which to arrange them in order of time. Among abstracts popularly but not officially worshipped are found Copia, Mundi- ties, Natio (a deity of child-birth), Nemesis, Quies, Valentia, and such "Sondergotter" (as Usener called them)14 as Morta, Paventia, Pecunia, Praestitia, Volupia (who "pre- sided over contentment and satisfaction in youth"), and Vica Pota (identified with Victoria). Occasional and individual deifications included Amicitia, Civitas, Dies Bonus, Fama, Gloria, Robur, Tempus Bonum, Testimonium, and Ultio. Doubtful examples on the border-line between deification, whether by analogy or not, and literary personification, are Adventus, Constantia (found only on coins and considered by Peter, Preller, and Wissowa a deification by analogy), Cupido, Cura, Fatus or Fatum, Hilaritas, Laetitia, Lubentia, Maiestas, Memoria (vouched for by Arnobius, Contra nationes 4.2), Natura, Pallor, Pavor, Sanctitas, Sors, Verecundia, Vis, and Voluptas. The above list represents the chief abstracts of the Republic and Empire generally discussed in histories of Roman religion. It does not include, however, by any means a complete census, for St. Augustine's City of God, among other later writings, mentions many more on the basis of Varro's Antiquitates rerum divinarum, a mixed bag of di indigetes, great and small, their functions defined by often erroneous etymologies. 12 Op. cit., p. 3143. Groping for reasons why abstracts ceased to be created in this century Axtell asks: "Was this due to a feeling that they had been covered thoroughly, and to opposition on the part of the pontiffs against a further extension of this cycle of deities for fear of going to ridiculous extremes? Possibly it was due more to the growing scepticism or to the internal dissen- sion which so racked the city and engrossed the chief magistrates that they were more intent on using the religious machinery of the state for political ends than on establishing new deities." The first part of Axtell's question is sufficiently answered by the fact that the Empire proceeded to create a large group of new abstract deities which, even so, did not exhaust their source of supply. As to the fear of ridiculous extremes, practically the first indication of it appears long after the era in which most of the abstracts were deified: the mockery of them by Pliny, NH 2.7.5.14: qua propter effigiem dei formamque quaerere inbecillitatis humanae reor..... innumeros quidem credere, atque etiam ex vitiis hominum, ut Pudicitiam, Concordiam, Mentem, Spem, Honorem, Clementiam, Fidem, aut (ut Democrito placuit) duos omnino, Poenam ac Beneficium, maiorem ad socordiam accedit.... quamobrem maior caelitum populus etiam quam hominum intellegi potest, cum singuli quoque ex semetipsis totidem deos faciant lunones Geniosque adoptando sibi. Harold Mattingly, art. cit. 105, also refers to Lucian's ridicule in Deorum concilium 13, where Momus, speaking to Zeus, comments on the many strange names without a real existence that have been introduced among the gods. The more biting criticism of the deified abstracts was to come from the anti-pagan Christian Latin writers. Axtell's tentative conclusion is, of course, reinforced by Polybius 6.56.5-11, on Roman superstition used to impress the masses, by Cicero, De divinatione 2.12.28, on haruspicy as useful for the government, by Cato's remark on the laughter probably exchanged by haruspices when they met (ibid. 2.24.51), by the utility of religion for controlling the people (De legibus 2.6.15), and by the expedience of deceiving the masses by means of religion insisted upon by the well-known jurist and pontifex maximus, Q. Mucius Scaevola (St. Augustine, Civitas Dei 4.27, 31, 32; 6.5, 10). Long ago Numa had created religion and its fictions in order to discipline the Romans and to stir them from their sluggish tranquillity: Livy 1.19. 13 Ibid., p. 32. 14 Hermann Usener, G6tternamen: Versuch einer Lebre von der religiosen Begriffsbildung (Bonn 1896), p. 364-375.</page><page sequence="5">112 L. R. LIND This brilliant and masterful demolition of the very bases of Roman religion and the Roman reasons for the greatness of their empire makes merciless nonsense of the practice of assigning a separate god or goddess to life's manifold functions: e.g., Cunina, the goddess of cradles; Cluacina, the goddess of sewers; Vaticanus, who pre- sided over the wailing of infants; Lacturnus, in charge of grain when it is milky; Runcina, whose province was the removal of weeds from the field; Cardea, who guarded doorhinges; Mena, invoked during menstrual periods; Numeria, who taught children to count; Fortuna Barbata, who provided young men with beards; Stimula, who aroused men to abnormal activity; Fessonia, who succored those who were fatigued, and most ridiculous of all, the divinities who presided over the nuptial chamber: Domiducus, who led home the bride; Manturna, who saw to it that she stayed with her husband; and Pertunda, whose function was so superfluous as to elicit Augustine's most contemptuous jeer.15 This was indeed a "turba minutorum deorum" (4.9). The criticism of Augustine, Arnobius, and Lactantius among the Christians consti- tutes a later phase of the history of Roman deified abstractions. The first attempts to explain their origin and purpose appear in the works of Cicero. He discusses them in at least three important passages. The first of these is De legibus 2.11.28: "It is well, to be sure, that Thought, Piety, Manly Courage, Faith should be consecrated as gods by us, all of them with temples publicly dedicated at Rome, so that those who possess these qualities (which all good men have) may think that these gods themselves are placed in their own souls. But it was vicious to set up a sanctuary at Athens to Insult and Impudence as Epimeni- des of Crete persuaded them to do in expiation of Cylon's crime, for it is proper to consecrate virtues, not vices. There is also a very ancient altar to Fever on the Palatine and another to Evil Fortune on the Esquiline; all things of this sort are detestable and should be rejected. If we must make up such names we should call Jove Vica Pota rather from his ability to conquer and to take possession, use the terms Stata from 'staying' and Stayer and Invincible of Jove, make up names of things we desire, Safety, Honor, Wealth, Victory. Since the spirit is cheered by the expectation of good things to come, Hope also was properly consecrated by Calatinus. And Fortune may be This Day's Fortune (for she is powerful every day in the year) or Fortune Who Looks Back, because she brings us help, or Chance, in which form she reflects more clearly the uncertainty of events, or First Born, from her function of creation... ." Cicero does not really help us a great deal in this passage;16 perhaps we should not expect from him the profundity of antiquarian interest in such matters that Varro must have displayed. He does, however, provide the first indication that some of the abstracts were not worthy of deification and that the practice could lead to ridiculous extremes. In fact, he seems to be aware of Varro's view (expressed by Augustine, De 15 See especially 4.8, 10, 11, the last paragraph of 15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30; 5.1, 12; and 6.9, with its hilarious ridicule of the goddess Pertunda: "Erubescat, eat foras; agat aliquid et maritus." 16 Mattingly's comments (p. 104-105) are also not extensive nor revealing, although he calls the passage "a valuable enough indication of popular belief."</page><page sequence="6">ROMAN RELIGION AND ETHICAL THOUGHT 113 civ. D. 4.31; 7.5) that the ancient Romans worshipped the gods more chastely when they did so without images.17 Another passage from Varro may be reflected in Cice- ro's observation concerning those good men who may think the gods represented by the abstracts reside in their own souls:18 "The men who made images of the gods in human form seem to have been influenced by the view that the human mind in a man's body is very similar to the immortal mind." It is a remarkable coincidence that St. Augustine presents both of these statements on the same page; they may have been contiguous in Varro's text.19 The second major passage to be considered is De natura deorum 2.61. Balbus, the Stoic (whom Augustine mocks as a stutterer who lives up to his name: De civ. D. 4.30) is speaking: "But then any quality in which there is present some larger force is called a god by the same name as that quality, such as Faith, as Mind, which we see recently dedicated on the Capitol by M. Aemilius Scaurus [the temple of Mens was restored around 107 B.C. or 115 by Scaurus]; Faith had been consecrated earlier by A. Atilius Calatinus. You see the temple of Virtue, you see the temple of Honor renewed by M. Marcellus which was dedicated many years ago during the Ligurian War by Q. Maxumus, to say nothing of the temples to Safety, Concord, Liberty, Victory, whose power was so great that it could not have been controlled except by a god; the quality itself received the name of gods. Of this type the names of Cupid and Voluptas and of Lubentine Venus have been consecrated [as Desire, Pleasure, and Venus Libidinous], qualities vicious and not natural (although Velleius thinks other- wise); these vices, however, often drive human nature to especial violence. Therefore these gods were created in accordance with the magnitude of the useful services which each quality provided, and in fact the power which exists in each god is indicated by the names which have just been mentioned a bit earlier."20 17 De legibus was written in 52 B.C.; Varro's Antiquities were published in 47 B.C. Cicero was, of course, well acquainted with Varro, who dedicated the De lingua Latina (45-43 B.C.) to him. In Academica 1.3.9 Cicero addresses Varro as follows: "tu omnium divinarum humanarumque rerum nomina, genera, officia, causas aperuisti .. .", clearly a reference to the Antiquities. It may well be that the De legibus was in the passage referred to written under Varro's influence. According to De. civ. D. 4.31, the Romans first began to worship images in 583 B.C. during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. 18 "Eas interpretationes sic Varro commendat ut dicat antiquos simulacra deorum et insignia ornatusque finxisse, quae cum oculis animadvertissent hi qui adissent doctrinae mysteria possent animam mundi ac partes eius, id est deos veros, animo videre; quorum qui simulacra specie bominis fecerunt, hoc videri secutos quod mortalium animus, qui est in corpore humano, simillimus est immortalis animi" (Augustine, De civ. D 7.5), (Italics mine.). This is a sentiment which Cicero would have approved, at any rate. 19 Ibid. As Mattingly, art. cit. 104, puts it: "The worship of virtues teaches men to venerate as it were the gods in their own souls." He is more interested in the later imperial "virtues" than in the origins of the abstracts in general. Cicero clearly intended no distinction between virtutes and res expetendae, but thinks of them as numina which will provide worshippers with what they desire. Mattingly's distinction between Concordia (which Cicero does not even mention here) and Spes is thus unnecessary. 20 Compare De legibus 2.8.19, where Cicero lists Mens, Pietas, Virtus, and Fides again in the same order, "propter quae datur homini ascensus in caelum," "by means of which man is given access to heaven." R. Engelhard, p. 6 (see note 1), points out that Preller, Roimiscbe Mytbologie I, p. 73, had conjectured that Cicero drew from Varro here. He could have done so at 2.11.28 also. Jordan's rejection of Varronian influence here carries no weight; Cicero and Varro were close friends and doubtless discussed religion frequently.</page><page sequence="7">114 L. R. LIND Here Cicero displays more interest in the chronological origins of the abstracts as well as in their purpose as numina or powers, not related, of course, to any of the greater gods except Venus. He returns, as in the previous passage from the De legibus, to the harmful instances among the abstract concepts. The practical idea of services rendered by them as a reason for their deification is uppermost in his mind. The qualities (or virtues) here are the res expetendae of De legibus 2.11.28; but they are conceived as possessed of a divine power which calls inevitably for a name by which they may be worshipped. He proceeds in the following sentences to discuss the deifica- tion of human beings for merit, an idea common among the Stoics (see De natura deorum 1.38); but this has no relation with his discussion of the abstracts except as a parallel phenomenon.21 In general, Cicero presents us with Stoic doctrine on the problem of the abstracts. Pliny the Elder points forward to St. Augustine in his opinion of these personifica- tions, condemning them out of hand. In Natural history II, his pantheistic cosmology, derived from Plato and Aristotle (who are followed by Cicero, De natura deorum 2.47), Pliny rejects the possibility of accomplishment and derides the very attempt to measure the world, which is sacred, eternal, and infinite. Similarly: "It is characteristic of the weakness of the human mind to seek the image and form of God. Whoever he is, if there is any other god [except the world], and wherever he is, he is all sense, all vision, all hearing, all of life, all of mind, all of himself. Indeed, to believe that there are innumerable gods and even [created] from the vices of men [as well as from their virtues], such as Chastity, Concord, Mind, Hope, Honor, Clemency, Faith, or, as Democritus believed, only two in all, Punishment and Reward, leads to greater foolish- ness. Weak and suffering mankind, mindful of its own infirmity has made these separate gods so that each man might cherish those of which he had the greatest need. Thus we find different names for them in use by different peoples and innumerable divine forces among them, the minor deities ar- ranged in groups as well as diseases and many plagues, since we wish in our desirous dread to placate them. Therefore a temple to Fever has been publicly dedicated on the Palatine, an altar of Orbona [the tutelary goddess of parents who have lost their children] near the shrine of the Lares, and one to Bad Fortune on the Esquiline. Hence one can understand why there is a greater population of heaven-dwellers than there is of men, since individuals make the same number of gods for themselves, adopting their own Junos and Geniuses, some peoples in fact worshipping animals and even certain obscene objects, many of them quite shameful to mention, taking their oaths by smelly onions and other such things."22 21 The notes in Pease's edition of Cicero's De natura deorum II, p. 692-700, are a mine of information, although little of it is grammatical in nature. It is interesting to observe in Pease, p. 260-261, his notes on Nat. D. 1.28, the way in which the Stoic Persaeus' views on the deification of human beings (resembling those of Euhemerus, his contemporary) reflect the realistic conclu- sions of Prodicus, who held that foods and beneficial objects were first worshipped as gods (cf. Cicero's quotation of Terence, Eun. 732 at Nat. D. 2.60: "Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus," just before the passage on the abstracts translated above). Foods also represented important utilitates. 22 NH 2.7.5.14-17. The text is not clear in several places and I have added in square brackets what seems to be implied by Pliny's train of thought. Compare Petronius 17 on the comparative number of gods and men.</page><page sequence="8">ROMAN RELIGION AND ETHICAL THOUGHT 115 In the first place, Pliny represents a complete reversal of Roman attitude toward the deified abstracts and scornfully upbraids weak human nature for trying to bolster itself with such fictions. His condemnation of them is inherent in his view of the world as eternal, measureless, and ultimately beyond human understanding, a curious convic- tion for such an enormously inquisitive polymath as he shows himself to be elsewhere in the Natural history. Nothing could be less scientific than his stubborn obscurantism on this matter; but then Pliny was an antiquarian, not a scientist, and, although his own convictions appear frequently in his work, he is generally dominated by his sources. Both Varro and Cicero seem to disapprove in a guarded manner of such excessive deification, but Pliny expresses his hostility openly. He mentions several of the abstracts Cicero had listed as well and underlines the practical individual human need they exhibit ("ut portionibus coleret quisque quo maxime indigeret," Pliny, loc. cit.; compare Cicero, Nat. D. 2.62: "Utilitatum igitur magnitudine constituti sunt ei di qui utilitates quaeque gignebant ..."). His apprehension as to the abuse of such worship is more grave than that of Cicero and he too objects to enshrining Fever on the Capitoline. His coupling of nomina and numina in the same sentence ("Itaque nomina alia aliis gentibus et numina in iisdem innumerabilia invenimus .. .") clearly proves his understanding of these abstracts as divine forces which are to be set in action by calling their names in prayer. Finally, his disapproval is heavily colored by the affinity he pretends to discover between the Roman abstracts and the more out- landish divinities of Egypt, including the lowly onion.23 2. The Classification, Origin, and Purpose of the Deified Abstractions In the world of deified abstractions there are no differences, no hierarchy; one is as good (or as powerful) as another. Augustine, with merciless logic, was the first to discover this fact and to declare that Felicitas alone, since as the goddess of happiness she represented the sum total of all desirable things, might properly be worshipped to the exclusion of all other personifications.24 More important functions were assigned to lesser gods; Mens was placed on a level with an obscure Iterduca and lost in a common throng. Even Pecunia, who was so highly reverenced, had no temple at Rome, as Juvenal said;25 he realized also the random nature and haphazard origin of the abstracts when he wrote at the end of Satire 10: "Fortune, you would have no power If men had wisdom; it is we who make A goddess of you and place you in the skies." 23 On the Egyptian worship of the onion see John E. B. Mayor, Thirteen satires of Juvenal with a commentary, II (London and New York 1888), p. 362-363 (note on Juvenal 15.9), and Pliny, NH 19.101, where he mentions it specifically. See also Tertullian, Ad nationes 2.9: Si dii eliguntur ut bulbi (onions), utique ceteri reprobi indicantur. Accius, frg. 646, 691 R3 uses the pairing of numen and nomen first. Mayor lists a few passages on the abstractions at Satire 1.115-116. 24 De civ. D. 5, preface; 7.3. Victory, the goddess, should suffice to establish the Empire; Jupiter is unnecessary: 4.14. 25 Satire 1.112-116: quandoquidem inter nos sanctissima divitiarum maiestas, etsi funesta Pecunia templo nondum habitat, nullas nummorum ereximus aras, ut colitur Pax atque Fides, Victoria, Virtus quaeque salutato crepitat Concordia nido. See Augustine, De civ. D. 7.3 on this inconsistency as well as others.</page><page sequence="9">116 L. R. LIND Nor are the abstracts dignified in order of age or precedence of cult practice. Varro made a division of the Roman deities into dii certi and incerti,. a distinction which Augustine analyzed minutely and showed to be worthless.26 In applying the division, however, to Cicero's statement in De legibus 2.8.19, Preller27 concluded that Cicero's "dei, qui caelestes semper habiti" corresponded to Varro's dii certi and his gods, "quos endo caelo merita locaverunt, Herculem, Liberum, Aesculapium, Castorem, Pollucem, Quirinum" to Varro's dii incerti. This left unclassified the "consecrated Virtutes," as Preller called them; these, equated with Cicero's "illa propter quae datur homini adscensus in caelum" (Mens, Virtus, Pietas, Fides, etc.), he placed in Varro's second category, believing that this was their probable classification. It is obvious, of course, that Preller's conclusion is awkward, to say the least. In the first place, the deified abstracts were, for Cicero, the powers by which man gained access to heaven, a privilege offered by no other gods, certi or incerti. Secondly, while attributes or subsidiary numina connected with the gods of the Roman pantheon and their heroized companions (dii incerti, who had gained heaven by individual merit) had some influence upon mortal Romans, they could not bring the latter into heaven. This means that the deified abstracts must, on the grounds of their less systematic origin, their basic functions, and their quite dissimilar nature in comparison with both dii certi and incerti, fall into a third major category of divinities, which we may call dii abstracti. They have received little attention in comparison with their age, large number, and relative importance in Roman religion. Warde Fowler, for example, barely refers to them in his The religious experience of the Roman people.28 There is only a sentence in his Roman ideas of deity29 about them. Neither Wissowa nor Latte gives them adequate space in their respective histories of Roman religion. Mattingly remarks that, "The modern reader ... is left vaguely wondering how the Romans could seriously worship such 'personifications' as Pax or Fides, and his wonder will only increase, if he follows up the subject and traces the cult of the 'Virtues' in literature, in inscriptions and, above all, in the imperial coinage."30 Yet these deified abstractions possessed temples and altars, in some instances many more than one, and presumably were 26 De civ. D. 7.1-4. 27 R iomiscbe Mytbologie, I, p. 73. 28 P. 154: "Abstract qualities, let us note, are usually feminine in Latin, and I think it is not improbable that abstractions such as Fides and Salus, which were deified at a very early period at Rome, may have reached divinity by attachment to some god from whom they subsequently became again separated." P. 164: "The old Roman seems to have had a tendency to ascribe what for want of a better word we may call divinity, not only to animate and inanimate objects, but to actions and abstractions; this, I take it, is an advanced stage of animism, peculiar, it would seem, to a highly practical agricultural people, and it is this stage which is reflected in the ritualistic work of the priests. They turned dim and nameless powers into definite and prehensible deities with names, and arranged them in groups so as to fall in with the life of the city as well as the farm. What was the result of all this ingenuity, or whether it had any popular result at all, is a question hardly admitting of solution. What is really interesting in the matter, if my view is the right one, is the curious way in which the early Roman seems to have looked upon all life and force and action, human or other, as in some sense associated with, and the result of, divine or spiritual agency." See also p. 285. 29 Roman ideas of deity (London 1914), p. 92: "The Roman deities were not personal ones, but functional forces of nature, with a tendency to form abstractions; and thus they were much further removed from men than those of Greece or Egypt." 30 Mattingly, art. cit. 103.</page><page sequence="10">ROMAN RELIGION AND ETHICAL THOUGHT 117 offered sacrifices if we can regard their worships as similar in this respect to those of the dii certi and incerti. It would be odd to imagine the altar of Honos, let us say, or Concordia dripping with the blood of slaughtered victims; but I have found no evi- dence to disprove such a supposition. The records or testimonia concerning the establishment of temples to the abstracts at Rome have been carefully gathered by Giuseppe Lugli and his collaborators in the Istituto di Topografia Antica at the University of Rome.31 While this valuable reference work has not yet been completed, it contains much evidence for the history of the personified ideas both from literature and inscriptions. From this evidence it is clear that the deified concepts do not represent myths, either Greek or Roman. They are not identical in any instance, furthermore, with the divinities included in the so-called indigitamenta; not one of the deified abstracts appears in R. Peter's exhaus- tive alphabetical list of the indigitamenta.32 It was therefore not quite fair of Augus- tine to confuse the concepts with the dei indigetes: although both represent abstrac- tions, Domiduca is not on an equal footing with Spes and fulfills an entirely different religious need and purpose. Both the deified abstracts and the indigetes belong, accord- ing to Peter,33 to the dii publici populi Romani, a very flexible and all-embracing category. But their functions were not at all similar: those of Spes, even though we cannot reach a precise view of them, were certainly much wider than those of, for example, Domiduca. It is time to sum up the tantalizingly scanty information concerning the origins and purposes of the abstracts. There is little doubt that they are generally drawn to Rome from the cult-practices of the Italic peoples and are often connected with dedications made during war time, hence for national protection, as, in another area of culture, was the importation of Etruscan dramatic performances during a time of pestilence.34 The deified abstracts answered certain individual needs which were first revealed in Roman religion during the third century B.C.,35 although, according to Axtell,36 "the habit of personifying and deifying a quality or a condition independently of other gods was inherent in the Roman character" and goes back to "the agricultural stage of the Romans." He probably means by this the earliest traceable social organization of the Romans, for they were agricultural in economy for centuries after they first appear in history. As to the origin of the abstracts, the Romans themselves have left us no more than conjecture. We must turn once again to Cicero as he invokes the Stoic theory of the unity which exists in gods, the universe, and human society: "And yet it is necessary that the gods, since they exist (if in fact they exist, as surely they do), should be animate and not only animate but capable of reason and joined mutually by a kind of civil agreement and society, ruling 31 Fontes ad topograpbiam veteris urbis Romae pertinentes I (Libri I-IV), 1952; II (Libri V-VII), 1953; III(LibriVIII-XI), 1955; IV (Libri XII-XIV), 1957; VI (Liber XVI); VIII (Libri XIX-XX), 1962, all published thus far by the University of Rome, Tipografia "Unione Arti Gra- fiche," Citta di Castello. 32 W.

R. LIND one world as a common state and city. It follows that the same reason exists in them as in the human race, the same truth and the same law, which is the injunction of what is right and the repulsion of evil. Hence it is understand- able that prudence and also understanding of a rational kind have come to men from the gods, and it was for this reason that our ancestors instituted the worship, publicly consecrated and dedicated, of Mens (or Human Understand- ing), Faith, Courage (Virtus), Concord. How then can we deny that these qualities are possessed by the gods when we worship their august and sacred images? For if understanding, faith, courage, and concord exist in the human race, how could these have flowed down to the earth except from higher beings? Since we men have within us judgment, reason, prudence, the gods must possess these to a greater degree, not only possess them but use them in their greatest and best activities."37 The anthropomorphic origin of the abstracts is clear from Cicero's reconstruction. He and the cultured Romans of his day must have thought of them, under Stoic guidance, in the way not so much of religious as philosophic concepts, answering to man's need. for the highest virtues and ideals. When they sacrificed to Honos or Virtus and gazed upon the statues which artists had made to represent them, the Romans, well aware of the skepticism toward the abstracts expressed as early as Plautus38 when he fabricated such sportive additions to their number as Opportunitas (Pseud. 669), or Munditia (Cas. 225), were engaging less in a religious worship than in philosophic and moral contemplation, in a meditation upon their relationship to the realm of practical virtue. In short, they were engaging in abstract thought. 37 De natura deorum 2.78-79. Other passages which are worth studying: 1.3 (pietas); 1.36 (origin of the gods); 1.46 (anthropomorphism); 1.115 (sanctitas, pietas); 2.60 (the heterogeneous character of the Stoic gods: astral deities, benefactors of men, personified benefactions, personified abstracts, deified mortals, natural forces personified, and the gods of the poetic mythology); 2.153 (pietas, iustitia); 3.38 (the cardinal virtues); 3.44-45 (a list of assorted abstractions); 3.47 ("Honos, Fides, Mens, Concordia, ergo etiam Spes, Moneta, omniaque quae cogitatione nobismet ipsis possu- mus fingere." Cf. 2.61, where Balbus had listed Fides, Mens, Virtus, Honor, Ops, Salus, Concordia, Libertas, Victoria, Cupido, Voluptas, Lubentina Venus); 2.79 (Mens, Fides, Virtus, Concordia); De legibus 2.28 (Mens, Pietas, Virtus, Fides ... Salus, Honor, Ops, Victoria, Spes, etc.). Moneta may be used here in the older sense of Mnemosyne: so Mayor, cited in Pease's note; 3.61: "Nam mentem, fidem, spem, virtutem, honorem, victoriam, salutem, concordiam, ceteraque huius modi rerum vim habere videmus, non deorum. Aut enim in nobismet insunt ipsis, ut mens, [ut spes], ut fides, ut virtus, ut concordia, aut optandae nobis sunt, ut honos, ut salus, ut victoria; quarum rerum utilitatem video, video etiam consecrata simulacra; quare autem in iis vis deorum insit tum intellegam cum cognovero. Quo in genere vel maxime est fortuna numeranda, quam nemo ab inconstantia et temeritate seiunget, quae digna certe non sunt deo." One sees here once more the recurring traits of the personified abstracts as seen by Cicero: their essentially anthropomorphic nature, the human need which calls them forth, their usefulness, their images; how Mens could have been represented as an image or statue is a fascinating problem. Their simulacra were evi- dently an important part of the worship of the abstracts. Templa, arae, and simulacra are often mentioned in descriptions of their worship. 38 See P. Lejay, Plaute (Paris 1925), p. 177-201, on Plautus' use of personifications; also Stossl, p. 1053. He begins the attack on them which is taken up later by Pliny the Elder and the Christian writers; in addition to Augustine, Civitas Dei, see Prudentius, Contra Symmacbum 1.445; 11.45 f.; 57 f.; 236 f.; Lactantius, Div. inst. 1.20.13, 18, 21; Arnobius, 4.1.2; Paulinus of Nola, Epist. 16, c. 4; Eusebius, Pr.

Both Lecky and Fowler emphasize at great length the absence of ethical values in the Roman worship and the fundamental source of Roman morality in law, while religion became a ius divinum administered by state priests without the cooperation of an edified congregation. Litchfield in his work on national exempla virtutis in Roman literature has suggested a plausible reason for the growth of the abstracts: "That the Romans, throughout the historical period, recognized and strove hard to remedy a defect innate in their ancestral religious system is evidenced on every hand. The ancient divinities were made to denounce the moral vices, and themselves endowed, more or less successfully, with moral attributes. The creation of supplementary deities, purely moral, Fides, Concordia, Pudicitia, and the like - a phenomenon too familiar to need more than passing mention - is perhaps testimony at once to the original incompetency in this respect of the elder divinities, and to the inadequate success of the Roman state in their reformation.
