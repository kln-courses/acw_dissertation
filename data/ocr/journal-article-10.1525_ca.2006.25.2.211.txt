<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> FRANCO DE ANGELIS AND BENJAMIN GARSTAD Euhemerus in Context Euhemerus, the famous theorist on the nature of the gods who lived around 300 bc, has usually been discussed as a disembodied intellectual Wgure, with scholars focusing on his literary and philosophical sources and inXuence. Although he is called “Euhemerus of Messene,” there is uncertainty as to where he was born, lived, and worked, in particular whether he came from Sicilian or Peloponnesian Messene. Until now, the conquests of Alexander the Great and the establishment of the Successor Kingdoms have been considered the only context for Euhemerus. This paper will draw upon literary, historical, and archaeological evidence to argue that Euhemerus belongs in a Sicilian context. The long history of the worship of rulers in Sicily from the oikistai to the tyrants of Syracuse, the wealth of Sicily, the proximity of the Lipari Islands, the multiethnic milieu of Sicily with its vigorous interaction and syncretism, all contributed to Euhemerus’ experiences and thought. We suggest that centuries of Sicilian cultural and political experience, not merely the “phenomenon” of Alexander the Great and the dawn of the Hellenistic Age, provided the impetus to the ideas of Euhemerus, and that Euhemerus brought this Sicilian contribution to bear on the new problems of the wider world. It is remarkable, if not absurd, that a person whose name has entered the English language and given us a word for an important approach to gods and myth should be largely neglected in classical scholarship. But why? Perhaps it is because on those rare occasions when Euhemerus of Messene is mentioned, he is too often discussed as a disembodied intellectual Wgure, without a spatial or An earlier and abbreviated version of this paper was delivered at the panel “Greek South Italy and Sicily” organized by Franco De Angelis at the conference “Texts and Material Culture: Possibilities and Problems,” jointly sponsored by the Classical Association of the CanadianWest and the Classical Association of the PaciWc Northwest (Calgary, March 21–22, 2003). We would like to thank the panel participants and members of the audience for their helpful comments on it. We would also like to thank Robert Cousland, Waldemar Heckel, Clemente Marconi, Lionel Sanders (who also took part in the original panel), and the anonymous readers of Classical Antiquity for their comments on a later and full version of this paper.

As Oliver Taplin has emphasized in a recent study of Greek literature, the author (or “maker”) is always engaged in a two-way discourse, either with his environment or with his audience (or 1“receivers”). This is certainly true of Euhemerus. We shall argue in this paper that Euhemerus should be identiWed as a Sicilian, and that his world can be seen as the result of a complex and lively interchange of people, products, and ideas across the Mediterranean. Euhemerus, as we see him in his Sacred History, is not to be considered a theorist who just happens to be Sicilian, but a thinker who brings the Sicilian experience to bear on the problems of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the early Hellenistic period, problems which had long been dealt with in Sicily andMagna Graecia. We need to explore in detail the contributions a Sicilian context made to the development of Euhemerus’ thought. We will suggest that a variety of factors, which uniquely evolved on Sicily, inXuenced Euhemerus: the long history of oikistes and hero cults, the multiethnic milieu of the island with its vigorous interaction, even union, of peoples, the common syncretism of cults, and the political activities of Sicilian Wgures. We hope that our paper will be only a Wrst step in the ongoing contextualization of authors, and the investigation of the cultural legacy of Sicily, both areas of research that require the marriage of texts and material culture. Although the remains of Euhemerus are relatively extensive, they come to us at second or third hand 2. Diodorus Siculus included material from Euhemerus’ Sacred History (Hiera Anagraphe) in the Arabian geography of his Wfth book and in the legendary history of his sixth book 3. The sixth book ofDiodorus’Bibliotheca is lost, but Eusebius quotes its version of the Euhemeran narrative at length in the Praeparatio Evangelica 4. While Ennius’ Latin translation of Euhemerus (the Euhemerus sive Sacra Historia) is lost, Lactantius makes numerous substantial references to it in the Wrst book of his Divine Institutes 5. It is possible, therefore, to compile what is presumably a fairly complete picture of Euhemerus’ work. Euhemerus claims to have traveled to a group of islands in the Ocean oV Arabia. One of these, Panchaea, is home to a utopian society made up of a number of diVerent races. The island is remarkable for its verdure and natural wealth, and the society for its system of three castes and its communal sharing of the produce. But the chief glory of Panchaea is the temple of Zeus Triphylius. In this temple there is a golden stele inscribed with hieroglyphs which preserves the history of the gods when they were rulers of the oikoumene (the whole inhabited world). The course of this history is not altogether clear. The succession of “god- kings” followed Greek mythographic tradition, with Uranus Wrst, then Cronus, and then Zeus. This succession may very well have been accomplished through 1. Taplin 2000: xv-xix. 2. See Winiarczyk 1991. 3. Diodorus v.41.4–46, vi.1. 4. Eusebius Praep. evan. ii.2.59B-61A. 5.

It is apparent, however, that Euhemerus laid great stress on the travels of Zeus throughout the world, during which he established cults to his ancestors, himself, and his hosts. Zeus also led the “gods” from Crete to Panchaea, although they had been active there before his time. The locus amoenus of Panchaea is more than a frame for the account of the gods, even if the description of the island and the narrative of the gods on earth appear in separate passages in Diodorus;7 it is rather, as we shall argue, integral to an understanding of the implications of the career of Zeus. Euhemerus has recently been the subject of a monograph-length study by Marek Winiarczyk 8. Winiarczyk’s approach to the scholarship on Euhemerus is comprehensive and conservative. He indicates many instances in which theory has overreached the evidence and been presented as proven fact. While this caution is often salutary, it can also have the unfortunate eVect of inhibiting any speculation at all. Our approach is diVerent. We take the Wrm evidence to be not the end, but the beginning of the scholar’s task. Our present study is profoundly speculative, and works out the implications of what is, admittedly, the probable, rather than certain, setting of the formative inXuences on Euhemerus. Inasmuch as Winiarczyk’s aim is to place a check upon groundless statements about Euhemerus, and ours is to study the importance of Euhemerus’ context to the development of his thought, our purposes and interests are somewhat diVerent. So, while we shall refer to Winiarczyk’s views on various details, he does not address our overall thesis, and our study is not a response to his work. I. EUHEMERUS THE SICILIAN The majority of ancient testimonies identify Euhemerus as a Messenian 9, although they do not specify whether he came from Peloponnesian or Sicilian Messene 10. Nevertheless, most modern scholars agree that Euhemerus came from 6. The inclusion of generational conXict in the Sacred History seems to be corroborated by a close parallel to Lactantius’ account in the Third Sibylline Oracle; Orac. Sib. iii.1110–54. It seems that Diodorus tried to downplay this aspect of Euhemerus’ narrative of the gods; if it had appeared in the sixth book of the Bibliotheca, Eusebius would undoubtedly have included it in his excerpt, but no such material is found in the Praeparatio Evangelica. 7. Winiarczyk 2002: 23–24, 75–92, by contrast, sees the description of Panchaea as merely a frame for Euhemerus’ discussion of the origins of religion, and intended to characterize Panchaea as the sort of closed, archaic society which might conceivably preserve an ancient stele from the far oV time when gods dwelt amongst men. 8.

The distinctive spellings of Messene for the Peloponnesian city and Messana for the Sicilian are, of course, a modern convention; no consistent distinction was observed in antiquity. </page> <page sequence="4"> 214 classical antiquity Volume 25/No. 2 /October 2006 Sicilian Messene 11. There is good external evidence for this. The Latin poet Ennius translated, along with Euhemerus, two other Greek writers who were deWnitely Sicilian, Archestratus of Gela and Epicharmus 12. It seems reasonable, considering these other selections, to assume that Euhemerus was also Sicilian 13. Ennius himself came from South Italy, and such proximity would have made him personally more susceptible to the inXuence of a Sicilian writer. When Ennius translated the Sacred History (sometime in the Wrst two decades of the second century bc) 14, the inXuence of the Hellenistic kingdoms on Rome was not very considerable, but the inXuence of Sicily and South Italy on Rome had always been signiWcant 15. In Ennius’ day especially, the recent conquest of the island would have focused Roman attention on Sicily through increased contacts and the imper- ative to understand peoples newly fallen under Roman government. Furthermore, the Wrst-century bc historian Diodorus Siculus, in addition to including a summary of the Sacred History in his now lost sixth book, employed numerous Euhemeris- tic interpretations (even if he reinterpreted the ideas of Euhemerus himself)16 in the Wrst six books of his history, which are concerned with mythology. Diodorus also made extensive use of the fourth- and third-century bc Sicilian historian Timaeus of Tauromenium (especially for his treatment of Sicily) 17. It is possible that he favored Timaeus and Euhemerus for the same reason: because they were both, like him 1, Sicilian 8. Moreover, Clement of Alexandria, and Arnobius fol- lowing him, refer to Euhemerus as Acragantine 19. Although this is undoubtedly an error, we might suggest that it arose from some knowledge of Euhemerus’ Sicilian origins 20. We should not imagine that Sicilian Messene in the time of Euhemerus was an intellectual backwater. It was the birthplace of Dicaearchus, a pupil of Aristotle, polymath, writer on culture, literature, politics, philosophy, and geography, and, to judge by his floruit of 320–300 bc, a contemporary of Euhemerus. Dicaearchus 11. Ne ́methy 1889: 4; van Gils 1902: 12; Jacoby 1909; van der Meer 1949: 9. 12. Olson and Sens 2000; Berk 1964. 13. Gratwick 1982: 157 and n.5; Winiarczyk 2002: 7n.27. 14.

Balsdon 1979: 200. 19. Clem. Alex. Protrep. ii.24.2; Arnob. Adv. Nat. iv.29. 20. This is admittedly the weakest of the arguments for the Sicilian identity of Euhemerus, since the doxographical tradition consistently states that he was from Tegea (Aetius Placita i.7 p. 297–98 Diels apud Ps.-Plutarch Plac. Philosophorum 880D-E; Theodoret Graecarum affectionum curatio 2.112, 3.4; Ps.-Galen Historia philosopha 35 p. 617–18 Diels; see Winiarczyk 2002: 8 and n. 30), and would equally place him in the Peloponnese. </page> <page sequence="5"> de angelis and garstad: Euhemerus in Context 215 and Euhemerus also seem to have shared certain interests 21. At least the Wrst book of Dicaearchus’ Life of Greece was concerned with the earliest history of Greece and the world, and with the origins and development of human arts and institutions 22, containing material comparable to Euhemerus’ theorizing on the origin of religion in remote antiquity 23. If Porphyry is to be believed, Dicaearchus also wrote in the Life of a time when “the ancients were close to the gods” and rationalized stories of life in the time of Cronus 24. Despite his universal interests, Dicaearchus included pieces of peculiarly Sicilian or South Italian erudition, particularly in his lives of Pythagoras and Alcaeus 25, allowing the lessons of his homeland to elucidate matters of current interest, as we shall propose Euhemerus also did. It is by no means unlikely that, as a Sicilian, Euhemerus was a “friend” of Cassander 26, the Wrst king of Macedonia (301–297 bc) after Alexander the Great’s death, as he is described in Diodorus 2’ summary of the Sacred History 7. There was certainly a Sicilian intellectual interested in questions of religion in the circle of hangers-on which accompanied Alexander the Great on campaign 28. In describing the “proskynesis aVair,” an occasion on which Alexander the Great supposedly attempted to orchestrate his receiving divine honors from his Mace- donian generals 29, Quintus Curtius Rufus writes that chief among those Greek Xatterers who urged the banqueters to prostrate themselves before Alexander the Great was Cleon from Sicily; he also notes that Cleon referred to the ancient examples of Heracles and Dionysus in his argument 30. Curtius also intimates that Cleon’s sycophancy, if not his speciWc role and rhetoric in this situation, was due to his Sicilian nationality 31. Given Cleon’s example, we should hardly be 21. It is, however, probably an overstatement to suggest, as Tarn does, that Dicaearchus and Euhemerus were both members of an intellectual group united by their relations to Cassander: Tarn 1933: 166. 22.

If these arguments for his Sicilian origin are refused, an insistence on Euhe- merus’ coming from Peloponnesian Messene will not remove him from a Sicilian context. Textual and material sources demonstrate a constant movement of people and trade goods between the Peloponnese and Sicily 32. There was a particularly great movement of people from Greece to Sicily, thanks to the revival of Sicily credited to Timoleon, in the mid-fourth century bc 33, which seems to be a rea- sonable putative date for the birth of Euhemerus 34. (Diogenes Laertius tells us that the Sicilian philosopher-poet Epicharmus “of Cos” [ca. 540–450 bc], in what we might imagine was a manner of arrival in Sicily similar to many in Euhemerus’ time, was born on the Aegean island, but brought to Sicily when he was three months old 35. ) Nor was all of the movement of peoples westward. The “exiles” who returned to repopulate the newly liberated Peloponnesian Messene included people from Sicily 36. As a result of this intercourse between Sicily and the main- land, settlers continued to identify with their homelands, and homelands to take an interest in their overseas foundations 37. Homeland and overseas settlement fed into each other’s concerns and ideas, creating civic and personal identities that were intertwined and overlapped. The cultural manifestations of this intercourse may be seen in the fact that, according to Aristotle, both the Megarians of Greece and the Megarians of Sicily claimed the origin of comedy for their own city 38, suggesting that there were similar and contemporaneous literary and social trends in the polis and her apoikia 39. The ideas of Euhemerus could likewise represent a joint cultural product of overseas foundation and homeland. It is perhaps sig- niWcant, in this regard, that the cult of Zeus Casius, mentioned by Euhemerus 40, was practiced on the island of Corcyra (Corfu), which lay on the route from the Peloponnese to Sicily 41. 32. The most recent illustrations of such ties are Cavalieri 1998; Galvagno 2000: 109–75. 33. See Talbert 1974. The traditional reconstruction of Timoleon comes under Wre in recent work. For the arguments, see De Angelis 2001: 155, 164, 168, 176. 34. A birth date of ca. 350 bc for Euhemerus, nevertheless, remains only a reasonable guess, based on his one agreed date, a floruit of ca. 300 bc. 35. Diog. Laert. 8.78. 36. Pausanias iv.26.5; Alcock 2002: 160–62. Cf. the skepticism of Luraghi 2002: 64. 37. A memory of the homeland was maintained in the “Messenian diaspora” throughout the Mediterranean (Alcock 2002: 158–62). By the same token, Euhemerus, writing in Sicilian Messene, might have been inXuenced by the importance of the resurgent hero cult in Peloponnesian Messene (Alcock 2002: 158–62, 167–73). 38. Arist.

The cities of Sicily were famously wealthy 42, and could sustain the sort of leisured, cultured elite in which philosophy, particularly revolutionary philosophy, Xourished 43. In addition to its wealth, Sicily may have proven a fertile breeding ground for novel and iconoclastic religious ideas because, with its cities founded in the historical past, it was in a position to be comparatively free of its legendary inheritance 44. It is not surprising, therefore, to Wnd that Theagenes (floruit ca. 525 bc), one of the Wrst names associated with the allegorical interpre- tation of Homer, and especially the gods in Homer, came from Rhegium in South Italy 45. (It is important to note, however, that such allegorical methods are quite diVerent from the approach of Euhemerus. Allegory, as we Wnd it in the Derveni papyrus, for example, is closely bound to the text, Wnding its own doctrines in the words and phrases of ancient poets, while Euhemerus makes free to devise his own narratives on the basis of the traditional names and relationships of the gods 46. ) The Greeks of Sicily, moreover, were accustomed to go on “pilgrimages” to the holy sites of mainland Greece, particularly Delphi and Olympia, and this may have habituated them to think of the origins of religion and the homes of the gods as something distant and detached from their local landscape (as Euhemerus certainly did), whereas the landscape of Greece was, by contrast, littered with mythological souvenirs 47. It is also possible that, if Plato did in fact visit Sicily 48, his lingering in- Xuence might help to explain certain correspondences with Plato in the work of Euhemerus 49. The main points of comparison between Euhemerus and Plato seem to be: (1) a concern with the “scandal of myth,” (2) the use of myths (as Wctions) to convey philosophical concepts, (3) the use of Wction to reconstruct the remote past, (4) the method of signaling a Wction to readers, and (5) the possible acknowledgement of the divinity of heavenly bodies. The inXuence of Plato, nevertheless, was undoubtedly so general by the time of Euhemerus that 42. Another product of the wealth of the Sicilian Greeks was their renowned luxury, an aspect of their culture demonstrated in their famous cuisine; see Collin-BouYer 2000. 43. As Drachmann noted, the development and circulation of revolutionary ideas in regard to the traditional gods, ideas that might incur the charge of “atheism,” were in the ancient world isolated to a very small group of highly cultured and aristocratic thinkers and philosophers; Drachmann 1922: 3, 146–48. Burkert 1985: 296–304 and Bremmer 1999: 83 also note that the followers of Pythagoras and “Orpheus” tended to be from the elite. 44.

If the question of whether or not Euhemerus was indeed Sicilian seems more or less settled, the signiWcance of a Sicilian origin for Euhemerus’ thought and writing has never been dealt with. We, however, shall discuss several aspects of the Sicilian experience (particularly in the fourth century) which arguably informed the ideas of Euhemerus. Firstly, there is the oikistes, an autocrat who, as a Wgure in the mix of history and legend that surrounded the foundation of the Greek overseas settlements, and as a mortal who received worship, might have served as a model for Euhemerus’ Zeus. In addition to the city founders of the distant past, Dionysius I of Syracuse could have suggested the idea of an immensely powerful despot who was considered a god. The description of Panchaea is in so many points similar to Diodorus’ description of the Lipari Islands, which lay a short distance oV Sicilian Messene, that a material inspiration for Euhemerus’ Wction suggests itself. We shall Wnally propose that syncretism was central to the thought and intention of Euhemerus, but that, far from being a novelty of the dawning Hellenistic era, the syncretism discussed by Euhemerus was the product of centuries of Sicilian experience, and a special Sicilian contribution to the early Hellenistic debates on religion, culture, and the relation of various peoples now quite obviously part of a single oikoumene. II. A HELLENISTIC FIGURE? Euhemerus and his ideas have been seen, very widely, as the result of the world that emerged with Alexander the Great’s conquests in the East. Typical in this regard is the opinion of Michael Grant: “Euhemerus, like so many others, was Wred by the exciting situations and unexpected, instructive foreign societies opened up by the discoveries of Alexander 50. . . .” The point is important for us to tackle, since treating Alexander the Great’s conquests as a watershed that owed little to the past distorts historical reality in a way that is odd and misleading 51. This is another problem created by the periodization we impose on the past. Various possible counter-arguments can be advanced. There is no doubting that Euhemerus lies at the cusp of our modern divisions between Classical and Hellenistic history. That his floruit straddles both these historical epochs, and in particular comes so early in the Hellenistic period, can 50. Grant 1990: 256, cf. also 99, 224. See also, for instance, other major works: Tarn and GriYth 1952: 52, 122; Austin 1981: 67 no. 38; Green 1990: 55, 108–109, 172, 179; Sherwin-White and Kuhrt 1993: 130, and 116–18 on Alexander’s reign “as a watershed in the development of ‘ruler-cults”’ (see below, section III); Shipley 2000: 187–89; Chamoux 2003: 344–45, Dench 2003: 301. These opinions are, of course, assuming that Alexander the Great’s conquests aimed at revealing new unknown worlds, but for a contrary view, see now Heckel 2004a. 51. Our colleague Waldemar Heckel 2004b expects this and other one-sided ways of viewing Alexander the Great to become more balanced in future scholarship. </page> <page sequence="9"> de angelis and garstad: Euhemerus in Context 219 only logically mean that those ideas must have been developing and circulating before the conquests of Alexander the Great and the arrival of the Hellenistic period 52. We argue that those ideas were not exclusively the product, but rather the tools, of the Hellenistic world. Part of the problem here lies also in the way we treat Euhemerus: he is usually examined by looking forward and eastward, but just as much is to be gained from also looking backward and westward, by making him straddle, in other words, a cultural and geographic division that we have again imposed on this Wgure. According to the late David Lewis, “Dionysius I, with his one-man rule over a large territory, his professional army, and his technological resourcefulness, preWgures the hellenistic period with some clarity 53.” In addition, others have noted how the reign of Dionysius I acted as a sort “proving ground” for the deiWcation of Hellenistic kingship, about which we will have more to say in a moment 54. Several other scholars have also emphasized how Sicily’s tyrants, both before and after Dionysius I, anticipated the characteristics, behavior, and policies of the later rulers of the multiethnic Hellenistic kingdoms 55. Hellenistic historians need to be reminded that the experiences of and reactions to their period were encountered by Greeks elsewhere in the Mediterranean before Alexander the Great, and for that matter long before the fourth century bc, and that the Hellenistic monarchies, as we know from ancient literature, learned a great deal from other comparable Mediterranean situations, like that found in Sicily, which preceded them, as we will see further in a moment 56. III. WORSHIPPING RULERS AND INDIVIDUALS Let us illustrate these points in amore concretemanner by turning our attention to Sicily’s historical realities, beginning with the long-standing tradition, born up to four hundred years before Alexander the Great, of worshipping prominent rulers and individuals. The worship of prominent rulers in Greek Sicily goes back to the cult of the oikistes 57. There is some debate as to whether the origins of this cult practice are to be placed in the eighth and seventh centuries, or whether they represent a retrojection onto the distant past by Sicily’s tyrants from the sixth century onwards 58. What is important for our purposes is that well before Euhemerus the 52. Brown 1946: 259 admits as much, but argues that Alexander the Great’s combination of old ideas was novel. 53.

As Carla Antonaccio has remarked, “We assume that the status of the founder was paramount and his power essentially absolute. . . . In general, it would appear that an oikist wielded power in a colony on the same basis as a leader at home: through personal charisma sometimes reinforced by birth, but because of the circumstances an oikist accomplished what usually only tyrants would ultimately do at home; and tyranny comes later in the west 59.” The Sicilian tyrants were attracted to the cult of the oikistes, both past and present, because they were responsible for founding and refounding numerous settlements all across the island, and so the actions generally of oikistai served as a model for behavior and comparison 60. We should note here that most of the cults surrounding these prominent rulers emerged after their deaths and depended on their deeds as men, and not, as in the case of Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic kings, on claims to divinity made during their own lifetimes and on the basis of descent from the gods. In Sicily, at the same time, there also existed a tradition of rulers claiming divinity while alive. Dion is thought to have been the Wrst ruler to do so 61. Euhemerus seems to have adhered to a combination of these two claims to deiWcation. He had Zeus initiate his cult in his own lifetime, but on the basis of his power and deeds, not his descent from the gods. These developments must be set against a much larger backdrop in South Italy and Sicily of traditions involving rulers and other individuals who con- cerned themselves with expanding the possibilities of post mortem existence and of claiming divinity during their lifetimes. In Sicily, the oldest evidence for these traditions dates to the second quarter of the Wfth century and centers on Acragas. Pindar, in his second Olympian ode for the tyrant Theron, outlines three possibili- ties in the afterlife, and in doing so tactfully and quietly makes the link between ruler and divinity 62. Pindar’s audience at Acragas must have been prepared and receptive to what Empedocles, one of its citizens, espoused a little later in the mid-Wfth century 63. Most scholarship has dismissed or refused to delve deeper into Empedocles’ claim to divinity and immortality during his lifetime 64. If, how- ever, we appeal to the wider Western Greek cultural ambit, we Wnd other similar 59. Antonaccio 1999: 115.

Simon Tre ́panier has recently emphasized that “Empedocles’ claim to divine status in B112, or at least imminent divine status, was novel mostly for its directness and the public manner in which it was advanced 65.” In this and other regards, Empedocles embodies earlier Western Greek thinking, above all that of Pythagoras 66. Even if allowance is made that “the survival of Pythagoreanism as a living force, with a strong sense of its own tradition, guaranteed anachronistic ascription of views and discoveries of the founder 67,” there is no doubting that in the late sixth century Pythagoras was associated with the immortality and transmi- gration of the soul and came to have a semidivine status amongst his followers 68. That these kinds of ideas were put into everyday practice is not to be questioned. Pythagoras’ basic idea of communal living and holding property in common, which he and his followers adopted in Croton and elsewhere, Wnds parallels in his day in the nearby Lipari Islands and in the Wction of Euhemerus 69. As to the semidivine status of individuals, Bruno Currie has collected and analyzed afresh the textual and archaeological evidence for the heroization of Euthymos of Locri in South Italy during his lifetime 70. Euthymos was a highly successful athlete who lived at roughly the same time as Pindar and Empedocles were writing; the evidence for a cult to him while still alive is incontrovertible. In light of all these arguments, it is indisputable that, during Archaic and Classical times, the Western Greeks worshipped prominent rulers and individuals mostly after death and sometimes while alive, and that they had views about the soul and the afterlife that tied into this worship. Consequently, it should no longer be denied that such practices and beliefs were well established before Alexander the Great, and that, in consequence, Euhemerus was interested in matters that had long had a particular Western Greek stamp. This is evident in a number of ways. The burial of the oikistes in the agora which was part of his cult invites comparison with the grave of Zeus in Euhemerus 71. According to the Sacred History, after traveling throughout the earth Wve times, dispensing laws and beneWts to men and kingdoms to his friends and relatives, Zeus returned to Crete, died, and was buried there 72. Euhemerus seems to have been the Wrst to describe Zeus’ grave on Crete, although the subsequent tradition was widespread, and its location may depend on a Cretan vegetation cult 73, but its signiWcance in the 65.

For the connection with the Lipari Islands, see Figueira 1984: 199, who observes that the Cnidian settlers on the Lipari Islands arranged themselves communally a half-century before Pythagoras’ departure for the West, and so the idea of such an arrangement must have had wider currency in sixth-century Ionia.

What better model could there be for the prominent burial of Zeus, indeed for the whole theory of his original humanity, kingship, and eventual deiWcation, than these historical Wgures, obviously mortal, yet famous for their power, and their roles as lawgivers and benefactors, and now the recipients of cult, much like the gods The popularity, uses, and role of the cult of Heracles in Sicily are matters that also need to be brought into the discussion 74. Two points are signiWcant here. The Wrst is Heracles’ development in the Greek pantheon, namely as a heroic and mortal individual who, through his deeds, rises to the ranks of the divine. Currie has recently made an important observation about the attractiveness of the cult of Heracles in the heroization and divinization process: To emulate Herakles was a way of expressing—in one’s lifetime—the aspiration of the status of hero or god and to the corresponding cult honours. The tendency has already been observed for newly heroized historical persons to be treated posthumously as the equals of established heroes. What needs to be emphasized here is that historical persons’ emulation of heroes (pre-eminently Herakles) constitutes a bid in those persons’ lifetime and on their initiative to be regarded as the equals of established heroes. Historical persons who emulated heroes were proac- tive in the process of their own heroization. This calls for a revision of the common view of heroization that regards heroization as the exclusive concern of the community, taking the community to heroize solely for its own purposes and to do so only after the person heroized is dead 75. Peter Kingsley has revealed another dimension of the cult of Heracles that applies speciWcally to Pythagoras and Empedocles: “already by the Wfth century bc Heracles had become a Wgure of major importance for Pythagoreans in the West, as an archetype of the spiritual ‘hero’. . . at least by the time of Empedocles 76.” The second point concerns the cultic distribution and uses of Heracles worship. Where identiWable, we frequently encounter Heracles in Sicily in frontier and boundary situations, amongst both the island’s Greek and non-Greek populations. At Selinous in Southwest Sicily, for instance, we see Heracles most clearly in this role in a Greek context in an early sixth-century inscription at Poggioreale, which marks the boundary of the city’s territory with native settlements to the North, and at Temple M closer to the polis center itself, which is at the boundary between the suburban sanctuaries and the countryside beyond. The clearest example from Sicily of Heracles in a non-Greek context comes with the recent discovery of a sandstone relief depicting him found in a sanctuary in the native hill-top site of Colle Madore. Clemente Marconi, in his publication of this relief, has 74. For the cult of Heracles in Sicily, see in particular Giangiulio 1983; Jourdain-Annequin 1988–1989; De Polignac 1995: 89–127; Marconi 1999; Manni 2003: 23–31; Malkin 2005. 75. Currie 2002: 37. The emphasis is in the original. 76. Kingsley 1995: 253. </page> <page sequence="13"> de angelis and garstad: Euhemerus in Context 223 argued that Heracles and the sanctuary in which the relief was found acted as a mediator and point of mediation between cultures. He has also underlined that scholarly interpretations have usually emphasized Heracles as either a cosmos versus chaos Wgure or as a mediator between cultures, but not both, depending on the overarching model of culture contact guiding scholars 77. Marconi has instead argued that both possibilities could exist at the same time and varied over time in adherence depending on historical circumstances. Heracles, in other words, played a wide variety of roles in a wide range of cultural contexts in Sicily, both Greek and non-Greek. Again, the pattern and nature of Sicilian worship are resonated in the Euhe- meristic tradition. Heracles is oVered as an example of a deiWed man or “terrestrial god” in Diodorus’ introduction to his material from Euhemerus 78. The position of Sicilian shrines to Heracles on the frontier might also have found a place in Euhemerus’ Wction: the center-piece temple of “Triphylian Zeus” on Panchaea is some distance outside of the city of Panara 79, and that on an island where one region represented a hostile threat 80. The joint cults established by Zeus to himself and his hosts, as described by Euhemerus, are also compared to the foundation of a city on Sicily itself, namely Aeneas’ founding of Acesta, which he named after his host, Acestes 81. Callimachus also associates Euhemerus with an extramural temple, in the usual liminal position of a Heracles shrine, and it is possible that this temple is supposed to have aYnities with the temple of Heracles Manticlus at Messene 82. 77. Marconi 1999: 302–305. These overarching models of culture contact will be discussed in section V below. 78. Diodorus vi.1.2. It is, of course, practically impossible to determine to what extent this preface depends on the thought of Euhemerus himself. 79. Diodorus v.42.6. 80. Diodorus v.46.1. 81. Lactantius Div. inst. i.22.25. This comparison may come from Euhemerus himself, Ennius, or even Lactantius. 82. There is a passage from Callimachus which suggests a connection between Euhemerus and extramural shrines, and, taken together with a passage from Pausanias, it might suggest a further connection with Sicilian Messene speciWcally. In the papyrus which preserves Iambus I we Wnd the lines: . . . come hither assembled to the shrine before the walls, where the babbling old man who invented Panchaean Zeus of olden time scratches out unrighteous books . . . (Callimachus Iambus i.9–11) (See PfeiVer 1949–1953: 162; Acosta-Hughes 2001: 22–23.) The precise context and meaning of these three lines is not altogether clear, since the four lines which precede them and the fourteen lines which follow them survive only in a very corrupt state. The old man writing his impious books on Panchaean Zeus has generally been assumed to be Euhemerus (White 1994: 144; Acosta-Hughes 2001: 44–45; Winiarczyk 2002: 3–4). It has also been suggested that Callimachus’ criticism of the Cretans as liars, since they speak of the grave of Zeus (Hymn i To Zeus 8–9), is a rebuttal of Euhemerus (Winiarczyk 2002: 5–7). The shrine outside the walls is presumably the Sarapeum of Parmenion, to which, according to the Diegesis, Hipponax (the imagined speaker of the poem) summoned his audience. But not only is it not certain that Parmenion’s Sarapeum is the shrine outside </page> <page sequence="14"> 224 classical antiquity Volume 25/No. 2 /October 2006 All of these features associated with the worship of prominent rulers and individuals are the result of Sicily’s historical trajectory, particularly the role played by cultural interaction. The worship of prominent political rulers and the heroic and divine characteristics they achieved through their actions stimulated a further, though distinct, development, namely ruler cult, possibly in the time of the Syracusan tyrant Dionysius I, who ruled from 405 to 367 bc 83. We have already said something in this paper about the role played by the reign of Dionysius I for the course of certain Hellenistic developments, and here we want to extend those comments by considering further the possible role he may have played in the formation of Hellenistic ruler cult. In the early 1990s Lionel Sanders laid out a case for Dionysius I’s having played an important part in the formation of Hellenistic ruler worship 84. Sanders argues that Dionysius I established a cult of his own person during his reign, the walls, but this Sarapeum has also proven impossible to identify with any known sanctuary in the vicinity of Alexandria (PfeiVer 1949–1953: 163; Acosta-Hughes 2001: 30–31). The exact location of the shrine in which Callimachus places Euhemerus is therefore uncertain, though not an entirely open question. The passage from Pausanias concerns Manticlus, one of the founders of the Messenian settlement at the conquered city of Zancle (Messene) in Sicily: Manticlus also built for the Messenians the temple of Heracles. The god’s temple is outside the walls, and he is called Heracles Manticlus, just as Ammon in Libya and Belus in Babylon. Belus has his name from the Egyptian man, the son of Libya, and Ammon from the shepherd who founded the shrine. (Pausanias iv.23.10) Zeus was identiWed with Ammon in Libya, and with Belus in Babylon, and Pausanias is obviously comparing these joint cults, in which the cult founder’s name is used as an epithet for the deity, to the cult of Heracles Manticlus at Messene. Euhemerus, for his part, seems to have laid great stress in the Sacred History on the process whereby Zeus traveled throughout the world and jointly established cults to himself and his host in various places (Lactantius Div. inst. i.22.21–23; see Garstad 2004: 250–53). Euhemerus says that Zeus was a guest of Belus at Babylon (Diodorus vi.1.10), and Ammon is also mentioned in the Sacred History (Diodorus v.44.6–7), although not as the host of Zeus nor the recipient of a joint cult. While there are diYculties with suggesting that Pausanias’ discussion here is derived from Euhemerus (Garstad 2004: 254–55), he does suggest a similar solution, referring to at least one of the same examples, to the problem of local cults to universal deities and the peculiar epithets used at them. Intriguingly, the shrine of Heracles Manticlus, which inspires Pausanias to launch into what might be considered a reminiscence of Euhemerus, is located outside the walls of Messene, just as the temple in which Callimachus places Euhemerus is outside the walls. It would be too much of a stretch to suggest that Callimachus gathered Hipponax’s audience outside of Messene, or dashed with his readers from Alexandria to Sicily and back again, but it would be far from inconceivable to Wnd in the erudite poetry of Callimachus a glancing reference to some point in those impious books of Euhemerus. Perhaps Euhemerus employed a comparison similar to the one in Pausanias, indicating an example of a joint cult intimately familiar to him; perhaps Callimachus considered this comparison as central to the (to him faulty) conceptions of Euhemerus. These passages from Callimachus and Pausanias do not constitute proof, but they should not be ignored in a discussion of Euhemerus and Messene. 83. Dionysius I’s life and career may also have been reminiscent of the Greek pantheon in quite unintentional ways. Finley 1979: 77–78 aptly notes the “Olympian exuberance” which marks his family relations, and incest and multiple marriage, worthy of the Theogony, are certainly in evidence to a confusing degree. 84. Sanders 1991. Hornblower 2002: 45, unfortunately, neglects this article in his recent discus- sion, but does note that within Wfty years of Dionysius I’s death, and about the time of Euhemerus’ </page> <page sequence="15"> de angelis and garstad: Euhemerus in Context 225 which, through his successor Dionysius II, inXuenced the Argeads of Macedon, particularly Philip II, and the tyrants of the Black Sea area, especially Klearchos and Nikagoras. Sanders admits that he can adduce no physical evidence for such an argument and that his case rests ultimately on the testimony of Ps.- Dion Chrysostomos 85. Currie has made an observation, in his discussion of the heroization of the athlete Euthymos of Locri mentioned earlier, that is worth noting here: namely, that it is exceptional to have both textual and material evidence in such cases 86. This point needs to be borne in mind as we consider the two responses Sanders’ arguments have met. Most recently, Winiarczyk has given Sanders’ arguments a lukewarm and curt reception 87. Winiarczyk concludes that “Die meisten Forscher halten dieses spa ̈te Testimonium fu ̈r unglaubwu ̈rdig,” but then in the accompanying footnote cites two scholars who have accepted this testimony as credible and only one who has expressed doubts 88. As a result, Winiarczyk Wnds Sanders’ case unproven and leaves the discussion at that. The second response, from the pen of Federicomaria Muccioli 89, has been more receptive and engaging with Sanders’ arguments. Muccioli argues that Sanders’ evidence is weak and he makes more out of it than Muccioli would. Instead, Muccioli feels that the evidence is more secure for Dionysius II’s having established a ruler cult. Although, as he goes on to point out, the evidence for ruler cult, both literary and material, becomes clearest and most secure for the reign of Hieron II 90, Muccioli believes the origins of this institution date earlier to the Wrst half of the fourth century with Dionysius II, if not Dionysius I91 —in other words, before the reign of Alexander the Great. IV. THE LIPARI ISLANDS The ideas of Euhemerus seem to have been informed to some extent by the peculiarities of his locality and its neighborhood in other regards. There are several striking similarities between the Sacred History and Diodorus’ description of the Lipari Islands 92, an archipelago which lies very close to Sicilian Messene, in regard to matters as diverse as topography, history, civil defense, politics, and economics. These similarities are numerous enough and close enough to floruit, the person of the ruler was important in constructions of state identity. Surprisingly, Caven 1990 has nothing to say about Dionysius I’s ruler cult. 85. Orat. 37.21. 86. Currie 2002: 25. 87. Winiarczyk 2002: 54–55. 88. Winiarczyk 2002: 55 and n. 110. The dissenting voice that Winiarczyk cites is that of Stroheker 1958: 160, whose dismissive curtness is doubtless the source of Winiarczyk’s own similar viewpoint. 89. Sanders’ arguments are tackled in two publications: Muccioli 1997; 1999: 471–81. 90. For which, see Muccioli 1999: 481n.1349, and Bell 1999. 91. Muccioli 1997: 118. 92. Diodorus v.7–10.

Several sources have been suggested for Euhemerus’ utopia, from Plato’s Republic to the reports of Egyptian and Indian society current among the Greeks 94. Each of these suggestions has some merit, and our purpose is not to displace any of them. We would rather like to set the Lipari Islands in their proper place as one of a number of models that contributed to the utopian thought of Euhemerus—perhaps as one of the more important models, since it can be related to Euhemerus’ life. The Sacred History may be a utopian romance 95, but Panchaea is not a utopia that springs directly from the imagination of Euhemerus, nor entirely from Greek descriptions of ideal societies or travelers’ reports of foreign and exotic lands 96. It has at least one concrete model in the world of his experience. It is probable that Diodorus’ narrative of Lipari can be traced back to Timaeus in the late fourth century, or even to the earliest known historian of Sicily, An- tiochus of Syracuse (late Wfth century) 97, and so might have been available to Euhemerus at the turn of the third century. But Diodorus’ description almost cer- tainly originated with Liparian informants 98, and so too, considering the proximity of the islands to his native city, Euhemerus’ knowledge of the Lipari Islands was undoubtedly based on native reportage or, quite as likely, on Wrst-hand experi- ence. We should, therefore, look not for textual similarities between Diodorus’ description and the Sacred History, but for similarities between what Diodorus describes and Euhemerus’ narrative. First, there is the physical description of the islands. In both the fact of Lipari and the Wction of the Sacred History, there is a group of islands, one of which, in both cases, is called Hiera (or “The Sacred Isle”), and another of which is the principal island of the group, Lipara in the one case, Panchaea in the other 99. Panara is a city on Panchaea, and Panarea is one of the Lipari islands. There are healing springs on Lipara, and Euhemerus describes the remarkable health-giving springs near the temple on Panchaea 100. In both cases there is a peculiar source of 93. Winiarczyk 2002: 73–74, 91–92, 94–96, 118, consistently refuses to use the word “source” (Quelle), in order to emphasize the originality of Euhemerus’ work. Although Winiarczyk 2002: 90 mentions Lipari as an example of a communal society, we are the Wrst to suggest a connection between the Sacred History and the Lipari Islands. Compare our suggestion, and other ideas about the inspiration of Panchaea, with Spyridakis 1968: 338, who believes that Panchaea as a place has no basis at all in reality. 94. Winiarczyk 2002: 85–91 provides a survey of the literature. 95. Winiarczyk 2002: 23–24. 96. See Winiarczyk 2002: 75–92. 97. Figueira 1984: 180–85. 98. Figueira 1984: 184–85, 190–91. 99.

The story of the Lipari Islands begins with the eponymous hero, Liparus, who was the Wrst to arrive on the uninhabited islands from Italy with his followers, and to whom heroic honors were accorded. In the old age of Liparus, Aeolus came to Lipara with a company of men. He married Liparus’ daughter, installed him as king of Surrentum, and became king of Lipara himself. SigniWcantly, Aeolus is not said to conquer Lipara, rather his followers and the original inhabitants shared the government in common 103. Aeolus is identiWed with the host of Odysseus, the “keeper of the winds 104,” and his mythical persona in Homer is explained as the result of his virtuous behavior and the fact that by observing the (volcanic) Wre he was able to forecast the local winds 105. The archaeological evidence indicates that Aeolus also enjoyed a cult on Lipara 106. The sons of Aeolus, Phaeremon and Androcles, established their rule over Sicily and brought peace to the warring Sicels and Sicani 107, apparently extending the principle of peaceful cohabitation formulated on Lipara throughout their domain. Although the descendants of Aeolus ruled for many generations, they were eventually overthrown throughout Sicily, which led to strife amongst the Sicani 108. The legendary history of Lipara seems to provide Euhemerus not only with details for his narrative, but also with material for his theories on the origin of religion. Like Liparus and Aeolus, Zeus led his companions, the gods, to Panchaea from elsewhere, namely from Crete 109. Likewise, under Zeus the population of Panchaea was heterogeneous, including native Panchaeans, Doians, andOceanites, hence the epithet “Triphylian” (“of the three peoples”) used of Zeus on Panchaea 110. The peaceful coexistence of these three peoples seems to have been broken when the Doians were expelled by Ammon, an event only brieXy mentioned in Diodorus’ summary of the Sacred History 111. Also, just as Aeolus observed the volcanic Wres, Uranus, the grandfather of Zeus, observed the heaven and the stars from the great mountain on Panchaea, “the Throne of Uranus” or “Triphylian Olympus,” knew their movements well, and was the Wrst to oVer 101.

Euhemerus might have taken from the Liparian legendary material the account of men who arrived on an island and came to be worshipped there, as well as the idea that the assumption of their divinity might have been reinforced by their scientiWc endeavors, and that their inXuence and supposed divinity might have served to unite disparate peoples. It is also possible, if not proven, that the cults of Zeus Casius and Zeus Ataburius, mentioned by Euhemerus 113, had been introduced to Lipara through the inXuence of Corcyra and Acragas respectively, or from Rhodes directly, at the time of the Wrst Cnidian and Rhodian expedition 114, as these cults were practiced in those places 115. The initial parts of Diodorus’ narrative of the Lipari Islands bear all the hallmarks of a foundation myth, especially one that is intended to reXect, explain, and defend the more historical account of a later settlement 116. The narrative continues 117, relating that after the native “Aeolian” population was seriously depleted, a party of settlers arrived from Cnidos and Rhodes in the early sixth century 118. As in the mythic account, these settlers did not displace the natives, but—apparently at the instigation of the natives themselves—formed a single community with them. Later the Liparians were harassed by Etruscan pirates, and so decided to hold their land and possessions in common and to divide the population into farmers and crews for a Xeet (who all ate in common messes)119 in order to repel the pirates. This system of common ownership was eventually modiWed so that the main island of Lipara was divided amongst the citizens and the other islands continued to be held in common. Later still, all of the islands were divided up, but the land was to be redistributed every twenty years. There is some uncertain archaeological evidence that this communalism was indeed practiced 120, and a passage from Livy suggests that the system was maintained at least into the early fourth century 121. The historical account concludes by saying that these 112. Diodorus v.44.6, vi.1.8. 113. Diodorus vi.1.10; Lactantius Div. inst. i.22.23. 114. Figueira 1984: 186. 115.

The degree of social fusion and assimilation on Lipari was obviously intense 123, and in the view of two notable Italian scholars the Cnidian and Rhodian settlers acquired their land on Lipari through intermarriage and in so doing inherited the pre-existing pattern of collective landownership that the natives seem to have been following prior to their arrival 124. What happened on Lipari was not uncharacteristic of Greek relations with natives on Sicily, which might involve an exchange of inXuences, social amalgamation, and shared government 125. Nevertheless, Liparian communalism seems to have been a remarkable rarity, particularly as it was more practical than theoretical, and as the entire population of a state participated in it. In the words of Robert Buck, “Something about this small group of volcanic islands seems to have caught the imagination of the ancients 126.” Euhemerus included a social fusion and communalism very similar to that found on Lipari in his Wction, and his purpose in so doing was connected to the central intentions of the Sacred History. The ancient heterogeneity of Panchaea’s population was continued and extended in Euhemerus’ Wctional present, so as to comprise the autochthonous Panchaeans, as well as the foreign Oceanites, Indians, Scythians 1, and Cretans 27. This is a perfect parallel of Lipari’s ancient fusion of natives and newcomers reXecting a more modern instance of the same. The Panchaeans are divided not along ethnic lines, but into three castes: the Wrst of priests (and artisans), the second of farmers, and the third of soldiers (and herdsmen). The produce of the Welds and Xocks is rendered to a common store and apportioned by the priests 128. It is presumably out of this common store that the soldiers receive their pay in return for protecting the land from the robber bands which infest one part of the island and prey upon the farmers 129. In all of this there is not only a parallel to the Liparian social structure, but also a suggestion of the motivation for it. Furthermore, the organization of the neighboring island of Hiera in the Sacred History is closer to the later developments on Lipari: Hiera 122. Figueira 1984: 195–96 suggests that this story of victimization by pirates and a concerted defense against them might have been created, or at least elaborated, to hide or excuse the piratical activities of the Liparians themselves. 123.

But Euhemerus is interested in more than simply adding color to his narrative by borrowing details from the Lipari Islands. The unity and brotherhood of mankind has been dealt with in modern scholarship as a philosophical ideal or as the dream of Alexander the Great 131, and Euhemerus has been supposed to have a role in ancient discussions of these matters 132. However, there is nothing to indicate that Euhemerus was, in fact, an exponent of the unity and brotherhood of mankind 133, or that he was carried away by new ideas arising from the conquests of Alexander the Great. But that is not to say that he did not actively encourage the peaceful coexistence of a number of diVerent peoples in a single territory—a much more down-to-earth and practicable concept. One of the purposes of Euhemerus certainly seems to have been the promotion of such a benign internationalism, based on the common worship of Zeus under all of his various national guises 134. Euhemerus’ ideas were not instigated by the new possibilities of Alexander the Great’s empire. Rather, they were founded on centuries of Sicilian experience. Even if the conquest of the Persian empire opened up new territories to Greek government, settlement, and trade, it did not represent the Wrst signiWcant Greek contact with other cultures. The Greeks had already been learning how to accommodate heterogeneous populations—often quite successfully—in Sicily and the West for nearly half a millennium, as we have indicated earlier in this paper. Alexander the Great’s conquests and the problems of the nascent Hellenistic kingdoms may have raised the question of the coexistence of diverse ethnic groups anew, but Euhemerus reiterated the details of Liparian social integration in order to oVer a tried and timely Sicilian answer. V. SYNCRETISM IN EUHEMERUS AND SICILY Discussion of Aeolus and of the Lipari Islands more generally serves as a good springboard for examining the Wnal major area of this paper, namely syncretism in Euhemerus and Sicily, since Aeolus in the Lipari Islands is one of our clearest examples of this phenomenon 135. Here on Panarea in the Lipari Island group, there is evidence of the worship of wind and underground divinities since the Neolithic period, and with the arrival of Greek settlers in the islands the principal cults were those of Aeolus and Hephaestus, the closest equivalents to their na- tive counterparts.

For the purposes of this paper, we cannot, of course, investigate in detail every possible dimension of syncretism in Euhe- merus and Sicily. Instead, we will highlight the main features, beginning with two relevant points about religion and culture contact in the ancient Mediterranean. We have often referred in this study to the encounters between diVerent cultures and to the blending of peoples and practices that resulted from this interaction. One of the reasons, we argue, that Euhemerus has not been put prop- erly into his original cultural context before now is that modern scholarship has tended until recently to compartmentalize the study of the ancient Mediterranean into distinct and discrete disciplinary and cultural units and regional specializa- tions that do not favor communication between one and another 137. As a result, we have been inclined to view the ancient world as similarly consisting of cul- tural and regional units with little interconnection, but how we study the past has changed in the last two decades, perhaps because of modern globalization 138. Cross-cultural approaches are again coming into vogue and are being applied to many areas of ancient Mediterranean life, including religion and syncretism. The most poignant recent example of this is the book Religions of the Ancient World edited by Sarah Iles Johnston 139. Here the various authors emphasize the relative homogeneity of ancient Mediterranean religions and their propensity to syncretize, especially, of course, in zones of culture contact. These changes in scholarly perspectives have accompanied similar ones in the study of the na- ture of culture contact in the ancient Mediterranean. The so-called terra nul- lius model, appropriated from narratives of modern European colonization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, has traditionally been applied to ancient culture contact situations 140. This model entails a superior culture causing the physical destruction or complete acculturation and assimilation of an inferior culture. More recently, however, the middle ground model has gained promi- nence in culture contact studies, including in some of those conducted for an- cient Mediterranean situations. As Chris Gosden has stated, “A third outcome is not just possible, but common: the creation of a working relationship be- tween incomers and locals that formed a new way of living derived from the cultural logics that all parties brought to the encounters 141.” According to Carol 136. van der Veer 1994: 208. 137. For this problem, and a partial solution to it, see now Horden and Purcell 2000. For Sicily, Edward Freeman 1891: viii, the renowned world historian, had already pointed out this problem in the late nineteenth century: “Nowhere do we better learn than in Sicily the folly of those arbitrary divisions which have made the study of history vain and meaningless.” See Kingsley 1995: 79, who approvingly cites Freeman and takes up this otherwise still rarely practiced approach to ancient Sicily. 138.

Gosden 2004: 82. </page> <page sequence="22"> 232 classical antiquity Volume 25/No. 2 /October 2006 Dougherty, ancient Italy and Sicily were prime examples of the middle ground phenomenon: In the late Geometric period, three distinct cultures converged in the western Mediterranean in one of the most signiWcant and productive examples of cross-cultural contact and exchange in the ancient world. Traders and settlers, Wrst from the Near East and then from Greece, traveledwest in search ofmetal ores and suitable land, coming into contact with indigenous peoples in Italy and Sicily, especially the Etruscans. Throughout the late-Geometric and archaic periods, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Etruscans lived and worked together in multicultural communities, each borrowing, adapting, and accommodating aspects of these foreign cultures into their own 142. It is beyond doubt, therefore, that the process of cultural interaction and integration had long involved all the peoples of Italy and Sicily well before Euhemerus’ time and extended into various areas of life, including the religious sphere. The stage has been set to discuss syncretism in Euhemerus and Sicily. Inasmuch as syncretism is an intellectual exercise of accommodation, Eu- hemerus used it to present a justiWcation of a process which had already been well under way in Sicily by his time (perhaps in contradiction of the exclusionist ethnic theories of Plato and Aristotle). The idea that cults all over the world, with their speciWc centers and peculiar rites, originated with the shrines that Zeus established to himself and his hosts as he traveled Wve times around the world was integral to Euhemerus’ theories on the origin of religion 143. All religion, then, had in essence a single object of worship, and this single object of worship might serve to unite humanity. Notably, several of the examples of cult names and epithets Euhemerus included in his narrative and used to illustrate his principle of joint cults would have been familiar on Sicily, where ethnic diversity, and consequently religious diversity, were not merely theoretical problems: Zeus Casius was worshipped at Cassiope on Corcyra (on the sea lane from Sicily to Greece), and Zeus Ataburius at Acragas, and Belus, or Baal, was recognized as one of the chief deities of the Carthaginians 144. In the Wctional setting of Euhemerus’ narrative, religion is also central to the fusion of diverse ethnic groups on the island of Panchaea. In ancient times the Panchaeans, Oceanites, and Doians 145, and in modern times the Panchaeans, Oceanites, Indians, Scythians, and Cretans 146, were all united by the worship of Triphylian Zeus, who is said to have received his epithet from the three peoples who made up the early population of the island 147.

Such a world view Wts nicely into current conceptions of religion and culture contact in the ancient Mediterranean outlined earlier. But what Euhemerus proposed in theory had in Sicily been attempted, and occasionally achieved, in practice. As discussed above, cultural contact and integration had been occurring in Sicily since at least the Archaic period, making syncretism, arguably, more typical here than in other parts of the ancient Mediterranean. This was not only because of Sicily’s location at the Mediterranean’s crossroads but also because of the middle ground nature of the frequent and regular cultural encounters that occurred there. Syncretism aVected all the peoples living on the island, both before and after the time of Euhemerus, serving as an important cultural instrument in matters of identity and negotiation. Sicilian material culture provides ample and unequivocal evidence of syncretism, and here we can only hope to outline the basic picture 148. A Wne example of syncretism, spanning the sixth to third centuries bc, comes from the so-called sanctuary of Zeus Meilikhios at Selinous. Worship here in- volved natives and Greeks before the destruction of Selinous by Carthage in 409/8 bc, followed by Phoenicio-Punic worshippers in the fourth and third cen- turies bc 149. The best sign of syncretism is the continuity of worship over these centuries using a blend of parallel divinities and rituals from the three ethno- cultural groups just mentioned. Continuity is clearly demonstrated by the numer- ous bicephalous stelai of a male and female Wgure, usually identiWed as Zeus/Hera or Pasikrateia, Baal Hammon/Tanit, and their nameless native equivalents 150. The bicephalous practice seen in the late Wfth-century (pre-destruction) Greek stele illustrated in Figure 1 is picked up by the Carthaginian worshippers in the fourth and third centuries, as indicated by the stele illustrated in Figure 2. The latter stele also demonstrates the blending of Punic and native traditions in its execution 151. John Boardman, in his classic work The Greeks Overseas, has observed that “These are odd objects, and the inspiration for them may be native, or even Punic, but the inscriptions on them are Greek.” This is something to which the most recent study of these stelai has also drawn attention: the blending of elements was 148. For a more detailed and complementary picture (because of its diVerent emphasis on literary and mythical data, rather than material, as in the present case), see Manni 2003. This book is an ampliWed reprint of a 1963 original, containing two introductory essays and photographic documentation prepared by disciples of his so-called Palermo School. 149.

While there are stratigraphic uncertainties associated with these stelai, uncertainties due mainly to the sandy matrix in which they were deposited (Fama` and Tusa 2000: 10–11, 18, 27), the broad patterns of worship and dedication are reasonably secure. 151.

What happened at the so-called sanctuary of Zeus Meilikhios at Selinous has parallels in other parts and periods of Sicily. The natives’ use of anthropomorphic representations seen there is also widely attested amongst the rest of Sicily’s native populations, the general practice having been borrowed from the Greeks. Anthro- pomorphic representations, together with another borrowing, namely Greek-style sanctuary architecture, were blended into native ritual practices and can be taken as secure signs of pervasive syncretism in Sicily 153. The Sicilian Greeks, too, blended both native and Phoenicio-Punic religious elements into their own cults. This can be seen in particular in sanctuary archi- tecture and in the physical overlap with pre-existing native cults with their own equivalent divinities (in the latter respect, one should recall the Lipari example involving Aeolus and Hephaestus with which we began). The best known instance of native inXuences on Greek religious architecture in Sicily involves round reli- gious structures uncovered at Acragas (Agrigento) 154. The most recent opinion on these round structures at this site speaks in no uncertain terms about syncretism and the direction of inXuence: The chronology of round shrines in the Aegean and Sicily is inconsis- tent with the transmission of forms from the former region to the latter. The dates suggest that if round chthonic shrines with pits were trans- mitted from one culture to another, the most plausible direction is from Sicily to the Aegean. The most obvious scenario is that Greek settlers adopted some indigenous religious activities, including round buildings, but adapted them to their own purposes, including (but not restricted to) chthonic cult. Agrigento may have been the major point of interaction 155. A recent study has noted possible native Italic inXuences on the orientation of Greek temples in South Italy, and possibly on some temples in Sicily too 156. Greek religious architecture also seems to have been inXuenced by Phoenicio- Punic traditions. In a recent study of Archaic and Classical Greek temples from Sicily and South Italy, Margaret Miles has drawn attention to the inclusion of pairs of interior staircases built inside the cella block on either side of the door from the pronaos and leading to the attic. In Sicily a dozen instances of this phenomenon are presently known from across the island from such sites as Syracuse, Himera, Acragas, and Selinous, the earliest example being the temple of Heracles at 152. Boardman 1999: 187 and, more recently, Fama` and Tusa 2000: 89. On the implications of this blending at Selinous from the standpoint of religion and magic, see Kingsley 1995: 243. 153. For the making of these points, see in particular Le ́veˆque 1973: 52; Torelli 1977. The changes can be most easily traced in the work of Domı ́nguez 1989 and Hinz 1998. 154.

Another handful of instances are known from a variety of sites in South Italy. Miles connects these staircases with ritual ascents found in the Phoenician and Near Eastern ritual and belief, involving the ascent of divinities like Baal, a god mentioned by Euhemerus 158. The Phoenicio-Punic cultures of Sicily were engaged in syncretism as well, as we have already seen in our discussion of the so-called sanctuary of Zeus Mei- likhios at Selinous. But what happened at that site is again more widely attested both in Sicily and wherever else in the Mediterranean Phoenicio-Punic cultures came into contact with other cultures 159. In general, Phoenicio-Punic syncretism frequently involved respecting and incorporating the previous religious practices encountered at sacred sites, as well as the adoption and adaptation of certain material features of Greek religious practices like coroplastic traditions of votive oVerings and sanctuary architecture. Sicily during the fourth and early third centuries bc reveals evidence of syncretism in other ways beyond the native/Phoenicio-Punic/Greek nexus just discussed. During Euhemerus’ lifetime, Campanian mercenaries, the so-called Mamertines, came to Sicily to serve under the Syracusan tyrant-king Agatho- cles, who came to power in 319/8 bc. On Agathocles’ death in 289 bc, the Mamertines seized Euhemerus’ hometown of Messene. Mamertine coinage de- picts certain warrior divinities—Mamers, Ares, and Adranos—who were used interchangeably 160. Eugenio Manni must be right in thinking that this religious overlapping and amalgamation had begun as soon as the Mamertines stepped onto Sicilian soil 161, for the spirit of syncretism generally had become the policy of the later rulers of Greek Sicily, whose response to the non-Greek populations of the island was international or supranational, was more inclusive and accommo- dating, and went beyond Plato’s plea to reassert Hellenism 162. This can already be seen, for instance, in some of Dionysius I’s “anti-Hellenism” policies 163, and in the increasing use in the fourth century of the Triskeles as a personiWed symbol of pan-Sicilianism 164. The Mamertines are an interesting example of how relatively 157. Miles 1998–1999: 1–2. 158. Miles 1998–1999: 21–25. 159. For Sicily, see Bisi 1986; Falsone 1994: 687–90; Garbini 1999.

Sanders 1994 suggests that the xenophobic tone of Epistles VII and VIII was intended to alleviate suspicion of Plato’s sympathies created by the positive attitude of his friends in Sicily toward the Carthaginians. As Sanders notes, the Epistles represent the thought of Plato, as understood in his school, even if they were not written by him. 163. The phrase is taken from Bury and Meiggs 1975: 405. See in greater detail the work of Stroheker 1958 and, to a lesser degree, Caven 1990, who attempts to paint Dionysius I primarily as the defender of Hellenism, something that has rightly met with severe criticism from several reviewers of his book (Lazenby 1991: 245; Walsh 1991: 56; Westlake 1991: 140; Talbert 1992: 457). 164.

Later the Romans were to follow suit 166. There is no doubting that syncretism was a well-entrenched andmaterial reality in Sicily before, during, and after Euhemerus. To sum up, Euhemerus maintained that cults all over the world originated with shrines that Zeus established to himself and his hosts, and that all religion had a single object of worship that could be used to unite diverse ethnic groups. The material evidence from Sicily demonstrates that Euhemerus’ ideas about religion, syncretism, and fusion were not fanciful. Many cults, not just those of Zeus, were involved in this process; people right across Sicily, regardless of whether they lived alongside other ethnic groups or as their neighbors, blended together diverse religious elements to create new and hybrid practices. Through religion a unity emerged. CONCLUSION Our biographical material for Euhemerus is not really less than what we have for most ancient authors. The best we can hope to do in most cases is not to reconstruct an individual life, but to set an author in some kind of a context. A context will give substance to the “other parties” of the author’s discourse: his environment (or sources) and his audience (or “receivers”), and so cannot help but throw light on the author himself. This is what we have done with Euhemerus. By transcending the boundaries between philology, history, and archaeology, we have shown how the distinct and multiethnic culture of Sicily, the close and stimulating relations of her various populations, and the political agendas of the island’s leaders all contributed to the thought and writings of an individual who was well equipped to oVer solutions for the problems of his wider world 167.

The complex relationship between an author and his context seems to us to be well expressed, in relation to Euhemerus among others, by Purcell 2003: 350–51: “There is no reason to deny the participation of Rome in the age of Appius Claudius the Blind in the currents of thought that are represented for us by what we know of Euhemerus and Dicaearchus. The older style of argument that gave single authors determining roles in the development of culture is inherently implausible. A Heracleides Ponticus, a Dicaearchus, a Timaeus, or a Euhemerus tracks and traces cultural patterns skeined between Greek, Roman, Carthaginian, and Italic communities. Their oeuvres oVer narrow windows on a vastly complex cultural world. Even if they were not so fragmentary, they would never give us the key to understanding the whole problem any more than Virgil or Horace can in themselves and taken singly oVer the key to understanding Augustan Rome, a period whose cultural history is, all would agree, inWnitely better known.” </page> <page sequence="27"> de angelis and garstad: Euhemerus in Context 237 BIBLIOGRAPHY Acosta-Hughes, B. 2001.
