AN ANALYSIS OF IMAGES (i) The Location of Images A rough circumscription of our area of study will be achieved when I say that by images I mean the kind of thing about which Ian Crombie and Austin Farrer have written in Faith and Logic and Farrer also in The Glass of Vision. In the latter work Farrer cites as examples of religious images the Kingdom of God, the Son of Man, the Israel of God and the 'infinitely complex and fertile image of sacrifice and communion, of expiation and covenant'.' Farrer's images are essentially verbal pictures whose function is to interpret and elucidate revelatory events. He writes: The great images interpreted the events of Christ's ministry, death and resurrec tion, and the events interpreted the images; the interplay of the two is revelation. Certainly the events without the images would be no revelation at all, and the images without the events would remain shadows on the clouds. The events by themselves are not revelation, for they do not by themselves reveal the divine work which is accomplished in them: the martyrdom of a virtuous Rabbi and his miraculous return are not of themselves the redemption of the world.2 How does Farrer's use of 'image' correspond with Crombie's? Crombie uses 'image' and 'parable' interchangeably and by these designates a wider range of experience than does Farrer. For Crombie images are not only verbal pictures of enduring human relationships but particular historical actions as well, including Jesus himself. Crombie holds that Jesus is, 'in his person and in his teaching, a declaratory image' of God to US.3 Crombie cites the Triumphal Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem as another instance of an enacted historical parable. Thus images may be historical events (or, more probably, the narration of them) such as the Triumphal Entry which supplies us with a picture of the claim of divine authority and its humble nature. Images applied to God may be predicates of human relationships-faithful, angry, gracious, merci ful, etc., or substantives borrowed from earthly institutions-father, son, king, master, etc. In either case the words have been transferred from home I Austin Farrer, The Glass of Vision (Glasgow, Dacre Press, 1948), p. 42. 2 op. cit., p. 43. 3 I.

GUALTIERI base to a transcendent frontier where their reference and content appear perplexing if not outright mysterious. In this paper I shall use 'image' in a broad and rather non-technical sense to indicate those verbal representations whose primary reference (i.e. the object on which the image is patterned and not the object to which it is applied) is concrete, physical existence. Another point to note about images is that since their point of derivation is concrete their appeal is to the imagination rather than the abstractive appreciation of the intellect. The difference between Father and divinity, King and omnipotent is obvious. (2) How Images Function What possible relation could our words,' which are admittedly derived from human, earthly experience, bear to the transcendent God? We may consider four possibilities. First, our words might have a univocal relation, that is, they would have the same meaning when applied to God as they have in their original setting applied to man. Second, our words might have an equivocal relation, that is, when applied to God our words would have a meaning totally different from that which they possess when applied to man. Third, our words referring to God might be analogical. That is, though there is a dissimilarity between God and man, there is, nevertheless, in some respects sufficient likeness to enable us to use our earthly words intelligibly about him. God, for example, is not literally wise in a human sense, yet there is something in human wisdom that resembles what wisdom is to God. In more agnostic forms of the doctrine of analogy, this similarity is looked on as consisting only of an analogy or relation of proportionality. On this view, no direct equivalence between man's wisdom and God's wisdom is posited; rather the resemblance is one of proportionality; man's wisdom is to man what God's wisdom is to God. But whatever the degree of resemblance assumed by differing analogy doctrines, they are agreed in maintaining the existence and definition of a genuine similarity between God and man that enables us to use our earthly words analogically when referred to God. What assessment can we make of these understandings of religious langu age? With regard to the interpretation that our religious language is univocal we may note that it is probably impossible to find even a single rabid fundamentalist who would claim that the anthropomorphic images of the Bible, e.g. Father, King, Judge, jealous, angry, etc., are to be taken as literal descriptions of God. And for good reason. To maintain this would 1 In this paper I use image, words, religious language, more or less interchangeably. Images are mental pictures of concrete earthly existents but these are normally conveyed by language so that we have verbal pictures. In this paper we are not considering (except peripherally) religious language of the conceptual sort that is found especially in theological definitions.</page><page sequence="3">TRUTH CLAIMS FOR RELIGIOUS IMAGES I53 be to abandon belief in the transcendence of God who is experienced in his holiness as 'other'. Concerning the equivocal interpretation of religious language, I need only point out the logical outcome of arguing for such a theory. To maintain this understanding would, in fact, land us in linguistic agnosticism, for there would be no point in talking about God with words that have no contact with him at all. At best we would be uttering nonsense syllables which convention had decreed would stand for a mysterious sense of the divine. The words themselves would convey no meaning about God since their applica tion is vacuous. We should observe in passing that this position, though, I believe, un tenable for a Christian, is seriously advocated by McPherson in his chapter 'Religion as the Inexpressible' in New Essays in Philosophical Theology: 'Religion belongs to the sphere of the unsayable, so it is not to be wondered at that in theology there is much nonsense (i.e. many absurdities); this is the natural result of trying to put into words-and to discuss-various kinds of inexpressible "experiences", and of trying to say things about God.'" About the analogical interpretation of religious language it is difficult to say anything helpful in a paragraph. To my knowledge, this remains the official position of Roman theology. Its attractiveness inheres in its more or less steady course between the pit of anthropomorphism where our words are seen (erroneously) as having a literal application to God and the pit o agnosticism where our words are (again erroneously) viewed as bearing no intelligible relation to God at all. Analogy seeks to preserve a balance bef tween identity of meaning and total dissimilarity in meaning. For many contemporary Protestant theologians, however, the doctrine of analogy still presumes to an excessively precise knowledge of the trans cendent Mystery. The preceding three approaches have a long history in theological dis cussion. But there is a fourth interpretation of religious language for which the prevailing designation is 'parabolic'. In describing how religious images function I shall find it helpful to follow the analysis of Donald Evans in his book The Logic of Self-Involvement.2 For Evans, religious language (and specifically the Biblical idea of Creation on which he focuses his study) is a metaphysical parabolic onlook. Each word in this definition must be given full value. First, religious language is an onlook. 'Onlook' is a word coined by Evans to denote an existential or self-involving aspect of language. When one accepts a belief expressed in appropriate language, one judges that the expression is suitable and one commits oneself to an implied attitude and policy of behaviour. In the Austinian terminology which Evans adopts, onlooks combine verdictive 1 p. 142 2 Donald Evans, The Logic of Self-Involvement (London, S.C.M. Press Ltd. I963).</page><page sequence="4">154 A. R. GUALTIERI and commissive aspects. For example, to accept 'I look on each man as a brother for whom Christ died', means (among other things) that I judge that every person I meet is indeed an object of Christ's sacrificial and atoning love, and that I decide to adopt an attitude of reverence and caring for my neighbour and to commit myself to treating him in the future with the same sacrificial action shown me by Christ. We see that an onlook is not simply an objective statement of factual resemblances (i.e. it is not a flat constative), though onlooks may be literal in the sense of moving in the direction of the equation of x andy when we say 'I look on x as y'. To illustrate: In the assertion 'I look on Smith as a means by which I may gain access to The President', it is possible to hold that Smith literally is a means. The important thing to understand here about onlook assertions, however, is this. What qualifies an assertion for the designation 'onlook' is that it involves the adoption of an attitude and commitment to a way of conduct. When we make an onlook assertion ('I look on x asy') we are saying basically, 'I commit myself to x in the same way as I am already committed toy'. As Evans says: 'An onlook depends for its communicable meaning on the fact that there is an obviously-appropriate way of behaving or thinking in rela tion to y: the speaker commits himself (though not indefeasibly) to a similar attitude towards x.'1 Second, religious language is parabolic. When I decide to look on x as y I imply that there is some resemblance between x andy that enables me to view and act towards x in terms ofy. But when the language of the image is parabolic then this resemblance is not understood in terms of a similarity between x and y of abstractable content, but in terms of the similarity of attitudes with which both are regarded. For example, 'I look on death as the gateway to a spiritual form of life'. Normally, the entrance to the spiritual form of life is regarded as a desirable and happy prospect. When we accept this onlook about death, we are resolving to think and behave towards death in a manner that is appropriate to our contemplation of embarking upon a spiritual life. Another of Evans' examples is, 'I look on all Tories as vermin', which he analyses this way: '. . . the only similarity between Tories and vermin which the speaker is suggesting is that the feelings and behaviour appro priate in relation to vermin are in some way like those appropriate in relation to Tories; the speaker may have reasons for alleging this similarity of appropriate response; but he does not indicate them'.2 In a parabolic onlook the resemblance in virtue of which x (Tories) is regarded asy (vermin) is the simnilarity of attitude which is felt to be appro prih'te to both. In Evans' words: '. . . the similarity which is implied between Op- Cit. p. I 31 2 OP. Cit. pp. 13 1-2.</page><page sequence="5">TRUTH CLAIMS FOR RELIGIOUS IMAGES 155 x andy is mainly in terms of appropriate attitude: x is such that the attitude appropriate toy is similar to the attitude appropriate to x." Parabolic onlooks may be better understood by contrasting them with analogical onlooks. Consider: 'I look on alcoholism as a disease.' The first thing that is being expressed here is the decision to interpret and behave towards alcoholism the way one does towards disease. This is the onlook feature of the utterance. But certain analogies between alcoholism and disease are implicit and in this case these help to justify the assumption of the onlook. For example: disease debilitates, so does alcohol; disease produces suffering, so does alcohol, etc. Such onlooks where the factual resemblance is more or less on the surface, Evans calls 'analogical onlooks'. In parabolic onlooks the comparisons involved between the components are on the basis of attitudes, though, as we shall see in what follows, it is possible to get behind some parabolic onlooks to a factual content.2 Third, religious language is metaphysical. I said above that in parabolic onlooks the resemblance between the component elements is not of factual content but of attitudes. The attitude appropriate for a tool, for example, is looked upon by some as an attitude appropriate to persons. This is not to say, however, that all parabolic onlook assertions do not have some discernable factual resemblances between the components that warrant the equivalence of attitude. But in some parabolic onlooks the factual resemblance may be suppressed in order to emphasise the attitudinal resemblance. Consider: 'I look on Henry as a brother.' The primary force of this utterance is parabolic. It claims that Henry is such that the attitude appropriate to a brother is appropriate to Henry. But it may be possible to transform this assertion into an analogical one by enumerating the similarities noted between Henry's conduct and a brother's. We can get behind the attitudinal posture 1 Op. cit. p. 132. 2 I am not clear why Evans chose the term 'parabolic' to designate those onlooks where a com parison is being made between two things (I look on God as a Father) not in terms of analogies but in terms of similar attitudinal responses. Was it simply to indicate a kinship with Farrer's and Crombie's use of parable? If so, it is misleading because they use parable in a comprehensive sense, much as I use image in this paper. Their parables are metaphysical parabolic onlooks. Evans uses the term 'parabolic' to indicate one aspect of the total image, viz. the attitudinal. Would it not have made for clarity simply to use the term attitudinal to designate onlooks held on the basis of similar attitudes? That 'parabolic' by itself, to designate Evans' technical meaning of 'attitudinal', is confusing is seen by this need to conjoin the two terms; e.g. 'Divine transcendence can be expressed in anthropomorphic language, provided that this language is interpreted parabolically, attitudi nally' (p. 226). And again, '. . . the modern interpreter needs to discard the literal comparison so that he retains only the attitudinal, parabolic meaning' (p. 226, footnote). This usage also lands us with some awkward constructions, e.g. 'A parable provides a metaphysical parabolic onlook' (p. 223). But perhaps Evans' intention in using the term 'parabolic' is simply to stress the indirect quality of statements about God. Parables, in ordinary usage, are not objective descriptions of something; rather they illumine their referent only allusively and tangentially. Similarly, the onlooks under discussion are not objective designations of God; instead they predicate something about God indirectly by pointing to an appropriate existential attitude of the believer. Hence, on the model of parables which are inherently characterized by indirect reference, such onlooks may fittingly be called 'parabolic'.</page><page sequence="6">I56 A. R. GUALTIERI to detect factual likenesses. Or, as Evans puts it: ' ". . . x is such that the attitude appropriate toy is similar to the attitude appropriate to x"; but the "such that" can be filled in if required." There are, however, parabolic onlooks where it is impossible to get behind the similarities of appropriate attitude to a similar abstractable content. In the example given above, Henry may not in fact possess traits of character that would logically merit the appellation 'brother'. Nevertheless, the speaker insists that there is something about Henry that makes the fraternal attitude towards Henry appropriate. But the speaker may say 'I don't know what it is'. He does not penetrate behind the similarity of attitude that is ap propriate to a true brother that he judges to be appropriate to Henry as well. Such an onlook Evans calls 'metaphysical'. In this regard he writes: '...a parabolic onlook is metaphysical in so far as we not only do not but also can not specify the similarity between x and y except in terms of a similarity of appropriate attitudes. A religious onlook includes references to unobservable entities which are recognisable and describable only in relation to particular human attitudes'.2 Crombie is making much the same point, I believe, when he says: 'The point of a parable is that you do not suppose that there is any literal resem blance between the truth which is expressed and the story which expresses it, but you do suppose that if you accept the story, not as a true literal account, but as a faithful parable, you will not be misled as to the nature of the under lying reality.'3 Let me provide a religious image as an example of a metaphysical para bolic onlook, namely father. When we assert that God is our father we are expressing our intention to look upon God with the filial affection and subordination with which earthly sons ideally regard their father, and then to commit ourselves to behaving in a commensurate way, e.g. towards God with obedience and towards his other children with fraternal love. We make this intention and commitment because we have assurance that these implica tions of the father image are appropriate to God as he really is, even though we are not able to specify the metaphysical resemblances between human and divine fatherhood. Though the correspondence between our father image and God is, for us, elusive and undefinable, we affirm that he is such that the atti tudes and commitment involved in the image 'father' are appropriate to him.4 1 Op. cit. P. 133. 2 Op. cit. p. 254-5. 3 Op. cit. p. 70-I. 4 Since I have noted above that one of the sources of the problem of religious language is the transcendence of God, I ought to indicate briefly Evans' treatment of images whose purpose is specifically to draw attention to divine transcendence. Images that express God's transcendence, Evans calls 'transcendental'. For example, images suggesting omnipresence and omniscience are parabolic because they express a resemblance of appropriate attitude, i.e. the attitude of openness towards one who knows one's thoughts is appropriate to God. But God is transcendent; therefore, towards him the attitude of openness must be unlimited. Such images which convey the sense of God's transcendence by evoking an unlimited response on our part, e.g. unlimited glorification, unlimited submission, unlimited trust, express transcendental metaphysical, parabolic onlooks.</page><page sequence="7">TRUTH CLAIMS FOR RELIGIOUS IMAGES I57 This discussion of the metaphysical aspect of certain onlooks brings to mind Edwyn Bevan's distinction between the symbols behind which we can see and the symbols behind which we cannot see. Bevan writes, 'By the symbols behind which we can see I mean those which represent an idea which we seem to discern in a way enabling us to express it in other terms more truly. " To illustrate: Bevan cites the example of Marcel Hebert who viewed the Virgin Birth as a symbol of the 'superiority of this particular union of the divine with human nature' (p. 257). The real truth of Christ is expressed in the philosophical formula; the symbol of the Virgin Birth may serve to heighten emotional response. The two-concept and symbol-may co-exist, but the man of understanding can see behind the symbol to the truth that is conveyed by the philosophical statement. Over against this class of symbols stand those behind which we cannot see. Bevan writes: 'When we speak of the love of God or the will of God, we know that we are speaking of something different from any love or any will we can know in men, and the idea "love of God", "will of God" may, in that sense, be regarded as an element in the life of man taken to symbolise something unimaginable in the life of God. We cannot see behind the symbol ... The symbol is the nearest we can get to the Reality.' 2 Evans' metaphysical parabolic onlooks resemble Bevan's symbols behind which we cannot see in this respect: in both, the words employed do not have a direct, descriptive connection with the reality for which they stand. God, for example, is 'described' or 'demarcated' tangentially, that is, in terms of human feelings, attitudes and deeds involved in accepting the image or symbol. We shall examine later how the Christian feels these image-directed responses are, in fact, appropriate to God as he is, that is to say, how the images are true. The application of this analysis of religious language to our understanding of images should be clear. Religious images are instances of metaphysical parabolic onlooks. To believe a religious image is to commit oneself to looking upon God and acting towards him in a manner similar to that which one holds is the suitable way of thinking and acting towards the earthly reality contained in the image (onlook), in the conviction that God is such that this similarity of attitude is appropriate to him and serves in some sense to comprehend him (parabolic), even though we cannot move beyond this similarity of attitude to a comparison of God as he is in himself with the earthly reality (metaphysical).

The question whether images can be true obliges us to examine briefly what we shall take truth to mean. What conditions would images have to meet in order to qualify for the designation 'true'? The common sense notion of truth is that a belief is true if it corresponds in fact with the reality outside the mind about which the belief speaks. Now, as we have seen in the analysis above, images about God cannot be said to correspond literally to his reality. In his exposition of the thought of Mansel in Symbolism and Belief, Bevan writes: 'If you took the representa tions of God in Christian theology, Mansel also said, to be literally true, when used of the Infinite, and argued on that supposition you were soon landed in absurdities. We could have no imagination at all of the Divine Reality. So far a Thomist and Dean Mansel would agree.'" The failure of image language to correspond literally to the reality repre sented does not, however, mean that it does not correspond at all. The burden of this essay so far has been to unfold the way in which images function as metaphysical parabolic onlooks in order to place ourselves in a position to see in what sense they may be said to correspond with reality and may be called true. But before passing to an examination of how images can be said to be correspondentially true we should take note of another theory of truth, the pragmatic. According to the pragmatic understanding of truth a belief is true if action in accord with it leads to the attainment of desired ends. We shall have occasion further on to see the relevance of this view to the truth of images. (2) Are Images True? This analysis of images as metaphysical parabolic onlooks raises the problem of truth in an acute way. To simply call an utterance an onlook evokes the question whether it is merely an expression of a groundless existential decision. For example: 'I look on myself as Messiah' or 'I look on women as corrupting' may just be expressions of neuroses with no foundation in objective evidence. But we have not simply called images onlooks: we have qualified them as analogical or parabolic. To call an onlook 'analogical' introduces it into the realm of public discussion where truth claims can be examined and validated. 'I look on music as a language' invites us to take note of relevant facts such as language communicates and so does music; in principle every one can learn the signs of a language and everyone can learn to read scores, 1 Op. cit. P. p38.</page><page sequence="9">TRUTH CLAIMS FOR RELIGIOUS IMAGES 159 etc. The utterance is verifiable by showing whether implied factual corres pondences actually exist. We have also noted that some parabolic utterances (where the attitudinal response is primary) can be transformed into an alogical onlooks by giving reasons why something is such that it merits an attitude akin to that taken to be appropriate for another entity. The problem becomes acute when parabolic onlooks are further qualified as metaphysical; here there is no going beyond the similar attitudes to an apprehension of the 'such that' that makes a particular attitude appropriate. The correspondence between x andy does not move beyond a correspon dence of similarly appropriate attitudes. One must sympathise with the critic who insists that for him truth means a correspondence between his idea and the reality; that there must be some discernible (and, therefore, verifiable) reality in God that justifies applying the concept of father to him. The critic will feel he is being fobbed off if we simply tell him, 'God is such that the attitude and behaviour appropriate to our human father is appro priate to God', for he will want to know what will rescue us from arbitrariness. Ancient man attributed personality to celestial bodies; what is to prevent us from ascribing personality equally mistakenly, or applying physical con cepts (e.g. force) capriciously? Analogy having been abandoned, what meaning can we give to the truth claim that there is, for example, a correspondence between God and our idea 'father'; that God really is such that the filial attitude is appropriate to him? In the absence of such specified analogies between human existence and divine existence that make our words applicable (though analogously) to God, the critic is inclined to conclude that our images are not truth claims about an objective Reality, but imaginative representations of, and exhortations to, morality. In effect (so the critic argues) the addition of the qualification 'metaphysical' has served to cancel out the existence claim implied in 'analogical' or 'parabolic', and reduced the statement to a mere onlook where no existence or truth claim is made but rather an attitude towards life and a behaviour policy are expressed. Probably the best known formulation of this interpretation of religious images is Professor R. B. Braithwaite's An Empiricist's View of the Nature of Religious Belief, in which he tells us that 'The meaning of a religious assertion is given by its use in expressing the asserter's intention to follow a specified policy of behaviour'. Abstract concepts and principles are not, however, substituted for the vivid images and stories of religious tradition because these have a psychological value in enhancing and facilitating the prescribed way of life. But the Christian who believes the images of the church's teaching will not concede that his images are a matter of 'let's pretend' on the grounds that this adoption of a fiction conduces to sound morality. He will insist</page><page sequence="10">I6o A. R. GUALTIERI that the images (understood as metaphysical parabolic onlooks) are true. God exists and, moreover, he is really such that the attitudinal posture advocated by the image is fitting. God is really such that to hold to the image of Father or King or Lover in relating ourselves to him is to under stand him truly, even though we are unable to specify further wherein the correspondence between earthly and divine kingship lies.' God is such that our image of father does correspond to his essential being though in the time of our earthly pilgrimage when we see through a glass darkly, we are not able to stipulate more precisely the nature of this corres pondence beyond the correctness of similar attitudes and responses. How may we express theologically what it means to claim that images are true correspondences with God? Adapting Evans, we may put it this way: An image is true if the onlook it contains conforms to the divine onlook (op. cit. p. 255). To call a religious image true is to claim that the onlook prescribed by the image corresponds to God's way of looking upon himself and other things. When we say the image 'father' applied to God is true we mean that the implied onlook conforms to God's; that is, that he looks on himself as a father in relation to us. Since, by theological definition, God's viewpoint alone is totally sound and 'objective' to hold that an image-onlook corresponds to his is to claim that it is true. III. THE GROUNDS FOR TRUTH-CLAIMS It is natural, though, for the critic to persist by asking for the grounds for affirming religious images to be true (i.e. in conformity with God's onlooks) and not simply useful. (i) Authority An answer frequently seen in contemporary philosophical theology is that the man of religious faith believes the images are true because they are authoritative. At some point the believer has encountered a person (for example) whom he feels to be trustworthy and who prescribes belief in the images as truly appropriate to God. The Christian claims his images are true because he has them on the authority of Jesus. Because we recognise his identity as incarnate God we accept his instructions as authoritative and this includes his teaching of how we should think about the transcendent I Cf. Crombie, op. cit. p. 79. 'The critic is not only asked to conceive of the world as if it were the work of a supreme intelligence, but also to believe that it is the work of a supreme intelligence. Creation, Redemption, Judgment are not to be accepted as illuminating fables, but affirmed as faithful parables. That these parables deepen our understanding of the world is one of the grounds for affirming them; it is by no means the whole content of that affirmation. To believe these doctrines is not only to believe that they illuminate the facts which come within our view, but also to believe that they do so because they are revelatory of facts which lie outside our view.'</page><page sequence="11">TRUTH CLAIMS FOR RELIGIOUS IMAGES I6I God. In this regard Evans says, 'God is like a father, but the nature of the likeness is obscure, and I believe in it mainly because I accept the authorita tive words ofJesus'.1 Alasdair Maclntyre puts forward a defence of this view in his contribution, 'The Logical Status of Religious Beliefs', to the volume Metaphysical Beliefs. He writes, 'What we say about God we understand in the familiar pictorial senses: we do not derive it from evidence, we recognise that the facts of nature and history do not provide any ground for what we say, yet we say it. Our ground for saying it is that we have the authority of Jesus Christ for saying it .... And why do we accept the authority of Jesus? In the frequently quoted passage, Maclntyre says, 'We accept authority because we discover some point in the world at which we worship, at which we accept the lordship of something not ourselves'.3 I view this 'authoritative' basis for believing images to be true as essentially correct though, as I shall show in a moment, this need not be accepted as an exclusive justification for truth. The apple of rationalism tempts us to pursue the question as to why Jesus' authority should be accepted, but here we must recognise that the validity of ultimate assumptions cannot be demonstrated; they form the starting-point for argument and are not them selves the conclusion of logical inferences from indisputable evidence. (2) Pragmatism Here I want to reintroduce the pragmatic type argument that we dismissed above in discussing Braithwaite. There we saw that a utilitarian interpreta tion of the images, that led to their acceptance because they assisted the moral life, was rejected, because it failed to move beyond utility to affirming the existence of the realities portrayed in the image. Is it not possible to maintain, however, that one of the grounds for affirming our images to be true correspondences with God is because the actions performed in accord with them lead to desirable ends? The pragmatist's argument would run something like this: I believe God is my Shepherd and therefore I look on God as my guardian and act towards him with trust and obedience.' (He may say at this point that one of the reasons he holds the shepherd image to be true is because he has it on the authority of Jesus, but this is not the prag matic thrust of his argument.) The pragmatist then goes on to say, 'I find that adopting this attitude and following this behaviour leads to the ends I desire, namely, a sense of sustained fellowship with God and love for my neighbour. Therefore, the image is true'. If, to take another example, persons believe that since God is king their behaviour towards others should be characterised by humility and tolerance and not by dogmatic authoritar 1 Op. Cit. p. 134. 2 Op. Cit. p. 200. 3 Op. Cit. p. 202.</page><page sequence="12">I62 A. R. GUALTIERI ianism, and if this behaviour leads to a desirable state of affairs in society, then the Kingdom of God image is true. The image is verified pragmatically. I want to stress that the pragmatic ground must not be understood only morally, that is, in terms of an image's capacity to conduce to desirable moral situations, but also religiously. I referred above to 'sustained fellowship with God' as a desirable end that serves to validate the image that leads to its attainment. When we decide to look on God as our father we adopt an attitude of filial submission to him and pledge ourselves to conduct appro priate to an earthly father. If this attitude and action leads to a keener sensitivity to God's presence and a deepened personal relationship with him, then we affirm this as a justification for holding the father image to be true. It will be quickly seen that this pragmatic understanding of truth raises another problem: What should be regarded as a desirable end? What criteria determine whether a particular goal, e.g. a non-aggressive harmo nious society, is an end to be desired? For if we declare a belief or image true on the grounds of whether or not conduct compatible with it achieves a particular end, then universally acceptable judgment about the belief's truth has, as its precondition, agreement about the desired end. Bevan recognises this problem but does not attempt any solution of it. He says simply, 'Such a belief would, of course, rest upon what seems to those holding the belief to be the direct perception of a certain quality in a particular kind of life, a quality which commands their reverence or admiration and implies an obligation for them to attempt to follow it'.' And so it appears that we are forced again to acknowledge the undemon strability of ultimate convictions. In the first instance we noted the ultimacy of Christ's authority-the point in the universe where we feel impelled to worship. Now we recognise the ultimacy of the perception of a particular way of life as an end for which to strive. It should be observed that I am not using a pragmatic argument to justify the authority of Christ: that would be to make morality more fundamental that God's presence, whereas the truth of the matter is that morality receives its sanction from its power to enhance or destroy fellowship with God. What I am saying is that those who are for the moment unable to see in Christ the point where they ought to wor ship may be enabled to accept some of the Christian images as true on the fulfillment of these conditions: (i) That they have an intuition of the ultimacy of agape. (2) That they discern that action in accordance with certain Christian images leads to the attainment of agape. (3) That they are disposed to acknowledge the force of the pragmatic test of truth.
