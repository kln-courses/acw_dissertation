<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY VOL. LXXVI, 4 WHOLE NO. 304 ON HERACLITUS.1 I offer here remarks on (a) the authenticity of the whole or part of some of his fragments (Section I), and (b) the historical relation of his thought to that of those who influenced him most directly, Anaximander and Anaximenes (Section II). The im- mediate stimulus for these reflections I owe to the study of G. S. Kirk's recent book, Heraclitus: The Cosmic Fragments, which I reviewed briefly in the July issue of this Journal. A work as serious and thorough as this compels one to reconsider many things one has previously taken for granted, to ask new questions, look afresh at the texts, and push through to a finish some hitherto half-finished trains of thought. For this I must express my sincere thanks to Kirk and also the hope that he will see in my many criticisms of his views a mark of esteem, not 1 After completing the first draft of this paper I had the benefit of comments on it by Professor Friedrich Solmsen and of a detailed dis- cussion of the fragments of Heraclitus made by Professor Harold Cherniss in his seminar at Princeton (Spring Term, 1955). I learned much from both, and made many revisions and corrections accordingly. But it must not be inferred that either or both of them would share all the views I express here; I alone am responsible for any opinion not credited by name to another. With two minor exceptions, I have not even undertaken to mention the interesting suggestions put forward by Professor Cherniss in his seminar; original ideas are better presented to the public by their originator, and I hope he may publish them himself. I also wish to thank the Institute for Advanced Study for enabling me to pursue studies on this and other topics under ideal conditions during the past year. 337</page><page sequence="2">GREGORY VLASTOS. the reverse. Only a fundamental work is worthy of extensive criticism. And if I have said little on matters in which I agree with him, it is because I could not hope to improve on his own treatment of them. I I start with the river-fragments. In Diels-Kranz they read: B 91a.: roTralz . . . OK (rCTtV 4pfivat 8s' T aVrp. B 49a: 7roracLLos ToiS avTroL fiPuaLvoAev TC Kal OVK Ef/Aalvo0lEv, EL/EV TE Kat OVK ELIEV.

The latter's citation (Crat., 402A) reads: OVK av /3falr)S for OVK ETtLV epAftvat in Aristotle (Met., 1010 a 14) and Plutarch.3 I believe that Plato's more direct form, in the second person optative in place of the infini- 2 The sequel, Kact vvxat 8e d7ri, rcv VTypv dvaOvptuivrat, is printed in the fragment by Diels-Kranz, but with a sceptical question-mark. The main reasons for rejecting it are noticed by Kirk (pp. 368, 371). But we would be in a better position to solve the residual puzzle, sc. why Cleanthes (cf. Kirk, p. 367) should have connected the river-image with the soul, if we adopt (following a suggestion made by Cherniss in his seminar) an emendation proposed by J. D. Meewaldt (Mnemosyne, IV, 4 [1951], pp. 53-4), veapai for Poepai in the sentence preceding the citation, which would then run, " For Heraclitus, wishing to show that souls by being exhaled become ever new (veapal), likened them to rivers, saying, etc." Thus Cleanthes would have linked the soul with anathymiasis (perhaps, as Kirk suggests at p. 371, by means of B 36 sub fin.) and then soul-in-anathymiasis with the river-image by means of the ceaseless change characteristic of exhalation. A still more com- plete explanation for Cleanthes' treatment of the fragment would be available if, as I shall argue below, B 49a should be retained. (May I say here, once for all, that I shall not burden the text by references to the ancient sources of quoted fragments, except where these are essen- tial for my argument; the sources are easily found in Diels-Kranz or, better still, in Kirk who also gives more of their context. In referring to Kirk's opinions I shall not give page-references except when his excellent index of the fragments, pp. vii-ix, is insufficient to identify the passage.)

But in a third citation in Plutarch, to which I shall refer and quote in the text below, Plato's oVK av efat3ait is retained. 338</page><page sequence="3">ON HERACLITUS. tive, is more likely to be the original.4 The second fragment expresses in its first sentence much the same thought as that conveyed by B 91a in a different, though equally arresting, form. Both fragments are now in peril of their lives. Reinhardt has rejected the first; Gigon, and now Kirk, reject also the second, leaving us with B 12 as the single original.5 But I have no intention of bidding these old friends goodbye without strong reasons. And Kirk has really none for condemning the first, except the following: While Plutarch cites B 91a twice in al- most the same form (see Kirk; p. 372), he has a third citation (at Qu. Nat., 912a) which reads: nrorapoZs yap &amp;Sl rols avroTs OVK av 4eiJpatrf5, ws ^qclrw 'HpaKcAetroT, repa yap ertppel vara. Kirk assumes that the latter must be derived from an original identi- cal with B 12, and that Plutarch's first two citations (as well as Plato's and Aristotle's) can only be variants of B 12. But let us compare the first clause in Plutarch's third citation (a) with B 91a and (b) with the first part of B 12. In the case of (a) the difference is trivial: "rivers " in the plural in place of "river."6 In the case of (b) the difference is anything but trivial: Plutarch's says, " one cannot enter twice," while B 12, "to those who enter." The presence of &amp;is in the earliest version of the Heraclitean saying is attested not only by the Platonic citation to which I referred above, but, more strongly, by the context of Aristotle's version of the fragment (Met., 1010 a 13): " Cratylus scolded Heraclitus for having said one could not step into the same river twice; for he thought one could not even once." In his book Kirk does not question the authenticity of Cratylus' remark.7 But, if authentic, it could not have been a Cf. OVK a&amp;v eevpoto at B 45, which is sufficient to dispose of Rein- hardt's opinion ("Heraklits Lehre vom Feuer," Hermes, LXXVII [1942], p. 18, n. 2) that the second person optative "niemals Herak- litisch sein kann," echoed by Kirk (p. 372). To this article by Rein- hardt I shall hereafter refer merely by the author's name. 5Reinhardt, loc. cit., and Parmenides (Bonn, 1916), pp. 165 and 207, n. 1; O. Gigon, Untersuchungen zu Heraklit (Leipzig, 1935), pp. 106 ff. Cf. also E. Weerts, Heraklit und Herakliteer (Berlin, 1926), pp. 8 ff. I shall focus on Kirk's discussion which conserves most of the objections that have been raised against B 91a and 49a. 6 There is also, of course, oI/ aP&amp; ,4qaisjs for oiKr 9frLY e,jiYLvat, but this would only strengthen the conclusion I reach below if the former is the original, as I have already suggested.

How could it then be directed at anything but a saying which did say "twice," as Gigon and Reinhardt have already observed? Are we to suppose that Cratylus first invented the powerful image conveyed by "twice" (as an inference from B 12?) and then made his own creation the epitome of the Heraclitean doctrine to which he objected? Of' shall we think he got it from some other second-hand source? In the absence of definite evidence to the contrary, we can only assume that an image worthy of Heraclitus' genius was his own creation, not that of an imitator or paraphraser. But if 8s was in the original, it could obviously not have been in the first part of B 12; while the second part of B 12, unobjectionable in itself, could very well have been taken from an original which read, 8ts es &amp;ov arTOv 7roraov OVK av p3faiLr, 'trpa yap KaL ETepa iSaTa `7rtppeL. This is substantially Plutarch's third citation 8 and, in the light of the foregoing considerations, our best reconstruction of the Heraclitean original from which both B 91a and B 12 were derived. What of Kirk's case against B 49a? His objection to the first sentence is that it " is not a possible summary of anything Hera- clitus said, for it asserts that at any moment the rivers are the same and not the same: this, as Aristotle tells us, is the belief at pp. 244-8). He started here by pointing out the similarity between Aristotle's citation and Plato's (Crat., 402A 9-10), as though this were any reason for thinking that Aristotle is only quoting Plato and Plato is misquoting Heraclitus. Then, catching up with the non sequitur, he negatived the possibility that both Plato and Aristotle are quoting a genuine fragment by referring to Reinhardt's opinion that B 12 is the original quotation from Heraclitus and then "confirming " Reinhardt's view by referring to Plutarch. In all this there is nothing to discredit the authenticity of Cratylus' remark as reported by Aristotle, unless we assume the very point at issue, sc. the genuineness of B 12 and spuriousness of B 91a, nor is there anything in Reinhardt (loc. cit.) except the scornful aside, "Was bei Aristoteles steht, ist nicht Zitat, sondern Anekdote." 8 But I have kept the text in Plato's citation for the first part of the fragment, on the rule that the earlier citation should be favored in the absence of definite reasons to the contrary. For Plato's es . . . 7roTrao6v in place of the dative in Plutarch's third citation cf. eis 7r7Xov ei3ads at B 5; Plutarch himself has the accusative with eis in one of his three citations (De Sera Num., 559c). Both forms were in use (L. S., s. v. e4lpalvetv) ; Heraclitus' use of the accusative with es in this fragment and of the dative in B 49a presents no difficulty. 340</page><page sequence="5">ON HERACLITUS. not of Heraclitus but of Cratylus, airos yap )rTO oV8S' ara4" (p. 373).9 Now if we are to press such fine points we might as well be exact about it. If Cratylus' remark is to be recast into a retort against B 49a, it would have to assert not, as this does, both alternatives, "we do, and do not, enter," but just one of them, "we do not enter." So the difference between the two views would remain intact, Heraclitus asserting identity-in- difference in B 49a, Cratylus difference (without identity) in his remodelled rejoinder. So the difference from Heraclitus would remain intact. The only question then is whether Heraclitus would be unlikely to express identity-in-difference in a yes-and- no form. To this the answer is certainly, No. Kirk rightly cites the parallel of OIK E0CeAel KaGt iE'XE at B 32. He might also have noticed here the oAa Kal ovx o8a in B 10. These prove that Hera- clitus did use the paradoxical yes-and-no form of expression, for which there is no known precedent, though it turns up after him both in his imitators 10 and in his great critic, Parmenides 11 -a form which is the perfect vehicle for his paradox that things An objection first made by Gigon, op. cit., p. 107, and approved by Calogero, Giornale Critico della Filosofia Italiana, XVII (1936), p. 215, n. 1. 10 (Hippocr.), De Victu, 1, 4, 7rdava Irpos eKacTOV rTWr6, Kal o6O&amp;v Wrdapr TWVT6, 1, 5, 7rar vra raT&amp; Kal ou ravTa, 1, 24, ol avorol C'CeprovrLa Kal eep7rovur Kal o%X ol alroi . . . ro avrov /,il evat Trbv aro6v.

Those who deny any allusion to Heraclitus in Parmenides (and they are now in the great majority) have yet to explain why in these lines Parmenides should (a) impute to anyone the belief in the identity of being and not-being (rather than merely the belief in not- being, which is bad enough from his point of view and would have given his critical dialectic all the scope it needs) and (b) after saying ols r6 Ire'Xev re Kal OtK elvat ravrbv vevoY6tarat here, which would be quite sufficient to make his point, should add maliciously, KOV ravrov, pro- ducing the expression, Travrbv KOVt ravov, which so strikingly parallels 6Xa Kal o0uX IXa in Heraclitus; nor (c) why he should be so emphatic in asserting that each of the two forms in his cosmology is lauvrt 341</page><page sequence="6">GREGORY VLASTOS. which not only appear to be, but are, different are nevertheless " one " and "the same." Nothing would be more natural for a man who thinks and talks this way than to say, of the same rivers whose waters are never the same at any point, "we step into the same rivers-and we don't step into the same rivers." What of the next sentence, el/Lev re Kat OVK Etlfev? Surely one does not need to see " him through the eyes of Hegel" (Kirk, p. 373) to suppose that he could have said just that. The idea of our being and not being would be a true application of Heraclitus' notion of the identity of opposites and neither more nor less Hegelian than the identity of the living and the dead at B 88. Heraclitus was as capable of saying edLev re Kal OVK Euelv, as Euripides arTvV TE KOVKET' g(Ttr, Alc., 521. But is he likely to have said so in this fragment? This is the real problem, for admittedly the transition from "into the same river we do and do not enter " to "we are and are not" is abrupt. It is possible that some part of the original dropped out, for our source for this fragment, Heraclitus Homericus, omits important words in two of his other citations of Heraclitus.12 If so, the simplest ex- planation would be that the original read el/vr re Kal OVK ElcEv &lt;ol avTroL&gt;l.

As other allusions to Heraclitus we can count (d) raXivrpo7ros at B 6, 10 if, as I shall argue, the same word must be retained at Her., B 51; also (e) the parallel of oKiL8v7,rr . . . avviraara at Her., B 91 with KLpdvai/evov . . . avvarajuievov at Parm., B 4 (which is ironically strengthened by Rein- hardt's rehabilitation-now followed by Walzer and Kirk-of the genuineness of avvi-raTat in the Heraclitean fragment, against its re- jection by Diels-Kranz and others; to the defense of avvidararat I should add Heraclitus' use of &amp;LrTarar at B 125). 12 In the case of B 90, all he gives us is rvp5os ... d. zo3 Tra 7rdv7a, Quest.

Though I do not think these suggestions "absurd" (so Kirk, p. 373), neither can I put any stock in them in the absence of any appropriate parallels. 342</page><page sequence="7">ON HERACLITUS. There is nothing to preclude the possibility that the elpuev was existential, and that Heraclitus passed in this fragment (with or without intervening words) from the "yes-and-no" of our relation to external objects (the rivers, as symbols of change) to the "yes-and-no" of our own (changing) being.14 My conclusion as to the relative claims to authenticity of the three river-fragments is thus the opposite of Kirk's. In one thing I do agree with him: we cannot keep all three; for though Heraclitus may well have used the river-image more than once, he is unlikely to have done so without significant variation in thought and expression. But the one I would sacrifice is B 12, for it is the flattest of the three, and can be better explained as a smoothing down of B 91a (or rather of the variant I have suggested above) and B 49a, than can the latter as subsequent remodellings of a weaker Heraclitean original.15 Another solu- tion of the problem would be to take Seneca's version as the 14 Other objections to B 49a are also put forward by Kirk, following Gigon: " The use of the first person plural to represent an action which is not necessary or universal (in contrast, for example, with fr. 21) is improbable in archaic prose style; and it is extremely unlikely that the eJLPaivovTres (who provide the fixed point of observation in fr. 12) should be put on a level with the waters which change" (p. 373). Why is the latter "unlikely"? Doesn't Heraclitus think that men change as much? Why then should he not "put them on a level" with the changing rivers? And the truth expressed by the verbs surely is universal (what else could it be?); so there is no problem about the plural, though I am not convinced that there would be, even if it were not universal. Curiously enough Kirk does not bring up the most serious difficulty in the way of the genuineness of the latter part of B 49a: el,e'v re Kai OVK elduev are just the words that would have been most likely to be quoted by Cleanthes (n. 2, above) or by Seneca (n. 16, below) who see the river as a likeness of human change. The only explanation I can offer is to assume that the first part got separated from the second in some important source and thus came alone to the notice of Cleanthes and Seneca; cf. the fate of B 90, whose first part, 7rvpos re dvravTaotl,3 r&amp;a rdvra, is cited all by itself (with variations) over and over again (ten citations listed by Walzer, Eraclito [Florence, 1939], pp. 125-6), while only Plutarch preserves the whole fragment. '1 I have misgivings about dropping even B 12. It has its own peculiar stylistic beauty, best noticed by H. Fraenkel, who speaks of its "wie rastlose Wellen herabflutende Kola," Gott. Nachr., 1925, p. 107, n. 2. Yet neither does it have the rugged strength of Heraclitus.

Seneca is bound to have both of the gems that fell out of B 12, and both in the same sentence. But either of them-" do not enter twice " or " we enter and do not enter "-tells the whole story perfectly all by itself. To put them together makes a crowded pattern, redundant, and less lucid. Its taste (or, rather, lack of it) is much more likely to be that of Seneca than Heraclitus.l7 I shall next review the case of B 89, roi Eyprlyop(oatv eva KaL KOLVOY KOC/lOV ciEvaL T ,WV Of KOIUgpLeV( oV EKaorTV ei 1810ov a7roorTpee(O?aL. Diels, followed by Kranz, had already condemned the second clause, for no good reason: the use of KOt!E'w!vwv is no objection, for, as Kirk points out (p. 64), KOtla.0at, a common word from Homer down, is perfectly possible instead of KaOev'8cEV, eEtLV in B 1, B 21, B 26, B 75, B 88. Kirk thinks the whole fragment "a later paraphrase, partly of the last clause of fr. 2 [4oovotv ot 7roXAAot sg 18lav EXOVTrES qpodv]atv] and partly of the last sentence of fr. 1 [rovs 8e aAXXov0 avOpw7rov XAavaOvet 6KcoOa EyEpOEvTe Tr0OVtoaLV, OKwT7arep OKdOa e'iovrEs rctALavaOvovTat] " (p. 63). But surely there is no mere paraphrase here. B 1 speaks of failing to notice or take account of what happens in our waking experience, while B 89 of turning away from " the one and common world " to a " private" one; this in turn is a different idea from that of the Xdyos 3vvos vs. 8tta 0po'vroat of B 2, though the sense of all three is, of course, very closely related. If we are to throw out this fragment it cannot be on the ground that it merely repeats what is said in the other two, but that the distinctive thing it does say could not have been said by Heraclitus. And why not ? Because, says Kirk, the word Koanos could only mean ' order,' not 'world,' at this time (p. 63). He argues this at length in his commentary on B 30, KOda'T/V TOIVE, TOV aVTOV aT7raVTWV, OVTE TriF 0E0V oVrE avOpWrWv to get across the idea of change would be good enough for other writers, but milder than what one expects from Heraclitus-and gets in B 91a and B 49a. 16 Defended as a translation of a Heraclitean original by Calogero, loc. cit. at n. 9, above. 1 Reinhardt, loc. cit., objected to Seneca's version on the ground that 8ss would not go with the plural.

But he is wrong in saying that in Anaxag. B 8, ov Ke- XPpTrrat aXA7or)v ra ev Tr EVL KCOaJL/, KOOC'OS is " the one group, or category-in this case, probably the continuum formed by each pair of opposites" (p. 313). Anaxagoras does not say here that the hot and the cold "form " a Kdaox0', but that they are "in " one; his K/corAo is indeed a continuum, but a single one, wherein "everything has a portion of everything," not the many con- tinua of his multiple pairs of opposites, which would not be " one world."

He is finally wrong in saying that Xen., lMem., I, 1, 11, o KaXov'LEvos Vro TrOV C7O4lOTtaV KOOrtLOF and Plato, Gorg., 597E, ot aolf o . . TO oXov TOVTO . . .

But (a) lacks cogency, since only Clement cites the rest of the frag- ment in its entirety, while the other two give only pieces of it; (b) becomes irrelevant if one translates, "the same of all men" (see n. 21, below), which makes excellent sense: the world which "no one of gods or men has made" or could make is "this one," the real world, which is "the same of all"; "private" dream-worlds (cf. B 89) can be and are being made all the time. 19 On the other hand, I should agree with Kirk (p. 312) against 345</page><page sequence="10">GREGORY VLASTOS. very fragment of Heraclitus (B 30) is evidence that KO'Uzo-, though it implies, does not just mean, 'order,' for what is in question here is not merely that nobody made the order of the world, but that nobody made this orderly world; this world is fire, and nobody made the fire, for it is " ever-living." 20 Kirk, in spite of his theory, concedes as much when he is led to say in the course of his discussion of the fragment that "the relation- ship of KoaLIov rTOVS to 7rvp adtgoov becomes, after all, one of simple predication: the natural world and the order in it ... is an ever-living fire " (p. 317). " Natural world and the order in it "-this is the sense of Ko'rao in Heraclitus, B 30 and B 89, Anaxagoras, B 8, and Diogenes, B 2. Then the argument that it can only mean 'order' for Heraclitus is pointless, as it is certainly wrong anyhow. There is then no reason why Heraclitus could not have spoken of "this world, the same of all " in B 30,21 and in B 89 of the Reinhardt, Kranz, and Gigon, that Theophrastus' phrase robs ovpavobs Kal robs EV avTros K6LJOVS is of itself no evidence for the use of the word by Anaximander; and that the authenticity of OXov rbv KOa-Lov in Anaxi- menes, B 2 (to be discussed below) is far from certain. But I am not as confident as Kirk that K6oaJos was not used even in sixth century speculation for 'world.' In his extended defense of early usage (Philo- logus, XCIII [1938], pp. 430 ff.) Kranz makes no mention of this con- sideration: the Milesians would certainly need a substantive by which to refer both in the singular and the plural to the world(s) which issue from the arche. Adjectival and participial makeshifts like rb \Xov, rTO rii, ra airavra, ra eovTa would not formally distinguish world (s) from arche or, if they did, would only convey the idea of indefinite totalities instead of structured world-systems. Ouranos, sometimes used by Aristotle, Theophrastus, and the doxographers for just this purpose, is never used in this way in extant fragments (Parm., B 10,5; Emp., B 22,2) but always, as we should expect, in its original sense of 'heavens.' Such a need is bound to be met sooner or later, and more likely sooner than later; it could be met very early by the use of K6OfL0o since the notion of the world as an orderly arrangement was, of course, present from the beginning. For this reason (not Kirk's, p. 313) I am inclined to discount Aet., II, 1, 1, "Pythagoras was the first to name rTv rwv 6Xwv repLo%xv 'world' because of its order." 20 Cf. Burnet's comment: "KOcOptOS must mean 'world' here, not merely 'order'; for only the world could be identified with fire," Early Greek Philosophy (4th ed., London, 1945), p. 134, n. 3. 21 The usual translation of aTraOVTW here is "for all" (so Diels-Kranz, Burnet, Kirk), as though Heraclitus had written rdaLi.

The notion of the real world being "the same of all," "one and common" for all, is a powerful one. It fills out beautifully Heraclitus' idea that the Logos, though common, is missed by the many (B 2) and passes unnoticed, though ever-present and universal (B 1). It says explicitly what is implied in B 17, which says that the many don't understand the things they "meet with" (reading oKcdaots EyKvpevO-tv): the world is what we all "meet with" all the time, it is the very same for all of us, but those who cannot understand its order live as though not only their understanding (B 2), but their world (B 89), were private, like men asleep. Homer had already spoken of the 8io/LOp ovetPWv, Od., XXIV, 12, and for him, as for everyone, dream, like shadow, was the symbol of unreality, the land where only phantoms dwell. Heraclitus underlines the unreality of the dream-world by calling it "private." 22 At the same time he shows up the illusory character of ordinary belief by banishing it into a world as " private " as that of the dream. In developing this line of thought Heraclitus would run up against the paradox that the beliefs which he condemns as "private" were in fact the general rule and thus perfectly "common " in that sense, while his were, in the same sense, all too "private " to himself. To block this side-track he would wish to say somewhere along the line that the "common" is not the common-run, nor the individual the "private"; what is "common for all" is not what all, or almost all, happen to think, but what all should think, and would, if they had sense. So B 113, evv6v E aoT 7rdo T cppovetv, has a distinctive place in his train of thought, and I see no reason for dropping it because of Kirk's suspicions.23 we might as well observe it in the translation, with "of all" here and at B 114, rW vvu 7i avrwov, and "for all" at B 113, 3vvov . . . rda, and "for the wide awake" at B 89, rois eyp'7yop6ouL. 22 Cf. E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley, 1951), p. 118: "Not only does that rule out the 'objective' dream, but it seems by implication to deny validity to dream-experience in general, since Heraclitus' rule is 'to follow what we have in common'." 23 They come to this: for Heraclitus "common" was "almost a technical term" whose "primary " sense was " operative in all things "; but in B 113 it has the "subsidiary " sense of what (or how) all should think; and "one may well doubt whether Heraclitus would have ex- 347</page><page sequence="12">GREGORY VLASTOS.

With this change I would agree.24 But I cannot join Kirk (and an impressive list of other scholars)25 in dropping 7raXlvrpo7ros in favor of 7raAlvrovog. My reasons for conserving 7raXivrpo7ro' are partly those of Diels and Kranz (Vors.6, ad loc., pp. 162 and 493): (a) Plutarch has 7raXtvTpo7rov in one citation (1026b), 7raXAvrovos in a second (369b), while in a third (473f) one of the MSS gives -TroVO and all the others -rpO7ro%, and Porphyry, De Antr. Nymph., 29, has 7rahAvrovos. But none of these are complete citations of the fragment; only Hippolytus gives the whole fragment, and he reads 7raXtvrporos; moreover he cites it along with a raft of other complete fragments, which makes it pretty certain that he had a book, or excerpt, of Heraclitus before him, which is most un- likely in the case of Plutarch's and Porphyry's citations. (b) Given the repeated (five times) 7raitvroovo as an epithet for ro'OV (or ro'a) in Homer, it is certainly the lectio facilior for any later citation of Heraclitus' fragment. (c) Theophrastus' Lt T7r evavTLOTpowr pljorj'u6at (ap. Diog. Laert., IX, 7) is a clear plicitly used uvvos in this subsidiary sense where some other expression would have done equally well" (pp. 55-6). But what is the good of doubting this, when /vvos is so used in B 2 and B 114, in both of them with the sense of a norm which all should follow-a sense which surely has the closest connection with that which, I agree with Kirk, is the primary one. 24 Mainly for the reasons given by Kirk on p. 205. Hippolytus' text for Heraclitean fragments is generally excellent, and one departs from it at one's peril. But in this case, there is a plausible explanation for a mistake (by Hippolytus or a copyist) in the occurrence of 56/oXoyeIv (also 6MuoXoyovaiv) just before the fragment (Kirk, p. 204), and in the MS reading 6AtoXoye'ev, whose final nu strongly suggests repetition of the preceding oJLoXoyeiv. 25 Kirk (p. 211) refers to Brieger, Burnet, and Walzer. I add Snell (Hermes, LXXVI [1941], p. 86, n. 1), Verdenius (Parmenides [Gro- ningen, 1942], p. 78), H. Fraenkel (Dichtung und Philosophie des friihen Griechentums [New York, 1951], p. 482). 348</page><page sequence="13">ON HERACLITUS. variant for 7raX'vrpo7rop ampfovia. Kirk's objection (p. 211) that this depends "upon his (Theophrastus') physical interpreta- tion " of B 60, s avwo Kart pita KaL ,wv', is irrelevant: even if this interpretation of B 60 were mistaken (and I do not think that it is),26 it would not explain why Theophrastus should invent a word not modelled on Heraclitus to convey his mistake. I offer finally this further reason against 7raXlvrovo5: Tovos, in the sense of 'tension' that would be needed here, does not occur in any Heraclitean fragment, nor in any pre-Socratic fragment in a physical context; nor does reIvetv with this sense, but al- ways 27 with the sense of 'extending.' There is much talk of "tension " in Kirk's and others' interpretations of Heraclitus,28 but none of it is grounded textually on anything but the disputed 7raXvTvTovo in B 51. As everyone knows, tension was a key-concept for the Stoics, and if they could have pinned it on their patron they would have surely done so; this is itself another reason why raaivrovos would be likely to displace 7rakXvrpo7ros in the post-classical era. Tpo7r, on the other hand, is an important word and concept for Heraclitus, as we know from B 31, where indeed the sense of 7ratvrpo7ros is strongly conveyed: fire "turns " to sea, but half the sea turns back again to fire (7rpcr- 26 Kirk, following Reinhardt, takes it "as a relativistic statement devoid of physical application" (p. 109). But the arguments against the physical interpretation are weak. Its misapplication to the ekpyrosis by Diog. Laert., IX, 8 proves nothing. Nor does its use by Tertullian, Philo, and the neo-Platonists to express other ideas foreign to Hera- clitus (for the references see Kirk, p. 106), a recurrent fate of Heracli- tus' sayings. As Kirk duly remarks (p. 107), in "the commonest ancient interpretation . . . the 'way up and down' represents the cosmological changes of matter between fire, water, and earth, as in fr. 31." There is absolutely nothing to forbid this connection with B 31, whose sense B 60 fits perfectly, and much to recommend it, for thereby the primary reference of this assertion of the unity-identity of opposites becomes a cosmological phenomenon of the highest importance instead of a banality, like the sameness of the road that goes up-hill and down- hill, adopted in all seriousness by Kirk and others. 27 Empedocles, Diogenes, perhaps Parmenides; see Vors.6, Wort-Index, s. v. 28 Ironically, even proponents of 7raXtvpoiros fall into the same way of talking. Diels translated "gegenstrebige," having perhaps forgotten he had translated rovos dlpo' dpeT7s, Xenoph., B 1, 20, as " das Streben um die Tugend." Kranz also slips into " Gegenstrebigkeit" while elucidating raXkitrpoTro, Hermes, LXIX (1934), p. 118, n. 1. 349</page><page sequence="14">GREGORY VLASTOS. Trfp).29 On these grounds it appears to me that the evidence is overwhelmingly on the side of 7raAcVTpo7ro-.30 The only question then is whether it makes good sense. (i) Does 7raXivTpo7ros apjLovl- make a fitting description of the Heraclitean cosmos? (ii) Does it apply to the bow and the lyre in the simile ? I should have thought there could be no possible doubt in anyone's mind as to (i). But I gather from Kirk that there is more than doubt in his. 31 So I had better go into the matter briefly: The primary sense of 7radLv is 'back'; hence, by easy extension, 'reverse' or ' opposite' (so Kirk, p. 215). So 7raAtv- Tpo7roq would be literally 'back-turning,' 'changing in the op- posite direction,' or more broadly, just 'contrary' (L. S., s. v. II. 1, 2). As for apgovir], its sense is what wewould expect of the abstract for apdo'Co, which is 'to fit, adapt, accommodate'; its denotation is broad enough to cover a ship's joint, a medical suture, a covenant, a betrothal, a government, a musical scale or concord (L. S., s. v.). Burnet's "attunement " is too narrow as a translation of apiovt'q in this fragment; it will not fit the bow. Conversely, Kirk's " connection" is too loose; "adjust- ment" would be better. Now Heraclitus' world is all adjust- ment, and of a kind which is not only compatible with con- trariety, but can only exist through the latter; and since it is all in change, the contrariety it exhibits is that of changes pro- ceeding in opposite directions (e.g. B 10, B 126). So there would be plenty of scope here for 7raAtlvpoTros in its most general 29 It might have been even in the text of the closely following B 31b, which Kranz would now begin with &lt;Tratv 8oe 7y&gt;,T Vors.6, I, p. 493. 30 I have not mentioned 7raX\vrpo7ros at Parm., B 6, 9 which Diels considered decisive all by itself (Herakleitos [Berlin, 1901], p. 13), for it would not be right to argue that Parmenides' use of it here is an allusion to Heraclitus unless its use by Heraclitus can be established on independent grounds. 31 Pp. 212-14. The conclusion he reaches is that " 7raXivrpoTro cannot well describe a apiovirq, and is indeed probably not used during the fifth century in any sense which could conceivably be attached to the fragment" (p. 214). I suspect confusion here, for there is a sense in which what Kirk says is true but irrelevant. Certainly, to the general public, indeed to almost anyone but Heraclitus, 7raX\ivporos would seem the last thing any ap/Iovia could possibly be. But would not the general public find itaqep6oevor ... C. rvU,peraL an equally incongruous coupling? Is this a good reason why Heraclitus should not have used the latter, or the former? 350</page><page sequence="15">ON HERACLITUS. sense of ' contrary.' But we need not stop with this. Let us note that in the Heraclitean scheme any one thing following a given line of change will be found to turn in the opposite way sooner or later; and that this "back-turning " is necessary to preserve the inter-adjustment of this changing thing with other changing things. Think, for example, of some water on the "upward" path. Whatever parts of it continued on this path would have to double back when they became fire; only by doing so could they remain within the system of "exchanges" (B 90) that maintains the order of the world; and the only exchange " in which fire can be involved is with water, hence "downwards." Thus the appov4r of the Heraclitean world is 7ratvTrpo7ro in the most specific and definite sense. What of (ii) ? There are two possibilities here, depending on the reference of apxov'-q: If this is to the framework of the bow and the lyre (a perfectly good sense of ap/ovil, L. S., s. v., I. 4), then 7raktvpo7roS must refer to their shape, i. e. to the fact that the two arms turn away from each other at the center. The only trouble with this is that it would make for a static image, not in keeping with the apiovrL of the Heraclitean universe which is as dynamic as anything could be and is elsewhere appropriately illustrated by burning spices (B 67), gold coin in circulation (B 90), stirred barley-drink (B 125). To get a comparably dynamic image out of bow and lyre we must assume that apovtr- refers to their modus operandi. This is indeed 7raAvrpoTros, for bow and lyre do their work, send forth arrow or sound, at just that moment when the process of stretching the string is re- versed. The continuous application of effort in the same direc- tion would not produce this effect. No arrow would fly, no sound would be heard, without "back-turning." 32 s2 An identical interpretation of the simile was offered by A. Brieger (Hermes, XXXIX [1904], pp. 198-9), following closely upon Susemihl: "Die Bogensehne wird nach der Brust zuriickgezogen . . . und dann losgelassen, und das Resultat dieser beiden entgegengesetzten Bewegungen ist der Flug des Pfeils. Wie beim Schiessen, handelt es sich auch beim Leierspiel um zwei entgegengesetze Bewegungen: die Saite wird durch den Schlag des Plektrons zuriickgedrangt und schnellt wieder in ihre urspriingliche Lage vor, und das Resultat ist der Ton. Den beiden Werkzeugen, deren Fiigung durch Zuriickschnellen den betreffenden Effect bewirkt, wird mit Recht eine 'zuriickschnellende Fiigung,' 7raXl,- TrovoS apALovlr beigelegt." I have cited this at such length because of its 351</page><page sequence="16">GREGORY VLASTOS. Finally I must consider what Kirk does with B 41, which reads in Diels-Kranz, ev TO o-oo'v, &amp;rT'uracoOaL yvWlzuv, OTrE Kv/pep- vlur 7rdvra &amp;ia 7ra vTrov. Kirk would punctuate strongly after yvwr,L7v, taking riLarTaoaca yv70/11v with Heidel (and Gigon) as a periphrasis for y7yvraKELV; and he would read O'K7v Kv[Epvarat after yv4u-qv. Now Kvj/epvaraL is unobjectionable; something must be done with Kv/Bpvuraat or EyKv/8epvrjyaa of the MSS, which does not make sense, and Bywater's Kv/3epvarat will do as well as any of the proposed emendations.33 "OKiq for Cre4 would fit much better admirable lucidity and complete success in sustaining the consistency of the simile in bow and lyre alike-neither of which can be said of the much better known version of this interpretation, the one offered by Wilamowitz, in Griechisches Lesebuch, II, 2 (Berlin, 1902), p. 129, and again (with some changes) in Platon (4th ed., Berlin, 1948), p. 287, n. 2. The only odd thing in the citation from Brieger is in the surprise that awaits one at the end; one would never have thought he was doing anything but glossing and even translating wraXivrporros! "Bewegung" is intolerably loose for rovoS, and "zuriickschnellende" would be just right for iraXivrpo7ros. L. Campbell (who read raXivrovos) paraphrased (The Theaetetus of Plato [2nd ed., Oxford, 1883], p. 244), "As the arrow leaves the string, the hands are pulling opposite ways to each other, and to the different parts of the bow (cp. Plato, Rep. 439), and the sweet note of the lyre is due to similar tension and retention"; in the latter sentence the reference of " retention " is unintelligible; in the former (often echoed by others), the account is strictly false: the hands are no longer "pulling opposite ways," etc. "as the arrow leaves the string." Kirk's own gloss on raXivrovos (which he translates, "working in both directions "), "the string is being pulled outwards towards its ends and the arms of the frame are being pulled inwards towards each other" (p. 215), is possible, but open to two objections: (i) since, as he duly notes, pp. 213-14, 7raXivrovos, as applied to the bow in the epic and currently, was used of the unstrung, as much as of the strung, weapon, its primary reference must have been to its shape; (ii) if rTvoS in 7raXtvrovos were used with the sense of 'tension,' the 7railv would be redundant, since, as Kirk himself remarks, " any kind of tension must work in both directions" (p. 215), and Heraclitus is not the sort of writer who says the same thing twice over in a single word. If one must have wraXivrovos, one would do better to follow Macchioro (known to me only through Kirk, p. 216), who "takes it as meaning 'alternately stretching,' and refers it to the alternate tension and relaxation of the string" (Kirk, loc. cit.). Kirk's objection-that the present tense of arvgueperat in the preceding sentence precludes alternating tensions in this one-seems to me irrelevant. 33 And if taken with 6oe'r (following Deichgraeber, Philologus, XCIII [1938], p. 14 and n. 5, who compares 6re4 at B 15) would surely make 352</page><page sequence="17">ON HERACLITUS. Heidel's interpretation of emartaaa yLiwv.34 But why should Heraclitus, who is hardly the man to use two words where one will do, say roa7aarOaL yvw,7tv if Earlorarrat or ytyvocrKetv is what he means? Heidel's reason for this was that a yvw,ot governing all things is a Stoic concept; with this, says Kirk (p. 388), " I entirely agree," and adds that " the name of the possessor of the yvwpd7 would have to be added, as in, for example, Pindar, Pyth. 5.122 ff., Atos Tro voos lieya7a KVPepva 8at`/tov' avSppv o)bXtov." But is the subject of Logos supplied in Tro Xo'yov 8' ovros $vvov at B 2 or in rov Ao'yov dxov'raavrE at B 50? Naturally, if asked, "Whose yv-r/q or Xooyos are you talking about ?," he would reply, "that of the ever-living fire." But the implied distinction would not have been a matter of reflective attention for him. If any- thing is foreign to Heraclitus, it is the conceptual disjunction of the substantival and the adjectival. As Kirk knows very well, this sort of discrimination takes a long time to find its feet in Greek philosophy; Being is both existential and predicative in Parmenides, and the hot, cold, etc. in the pre-Socratics are not just qualities but, as Cornford used to call them, quality-things. It would be wholly characteristic of this period to merge thought and thinking things,35 and change freely from "the thunder- bolt (which) steers all things," B 64, to "the thought by which all things are steered." To whom could this give offence, except someone who would take the latter to imply a disembodied, in- corporeal mind, as no one would at this time.36 our best text for the fragment. ore' Kvpepvdarat is closer to the MS readings (6rer Kvpfepv7aat P1 B, Or' eyKv,epviYaat F) than , (Bywater) or 07rry / OKb (Gigon) or OK77 (Kirk) KvI3epvpTat. Diels' ev/cvppv7rae is open to Kirk's well-taken objection: "his gnomic aorist is inappropriate, since the action is strictly continuous" (pp. 387-8). 34 It would iron out the queer inconsistency in Heidel who, after denouncing as " Stoic " the notion of a thought that governs the world, went right ahead to translate, "she (Understanding) it is that per- vades all things and governs all things," Proc. Amer. Acad. of Arts and Sc., XLVIII (1913), pp. 700-2. 5 And even both of these with their object, cognoscens with cog- noscendum: cf. C. P., XLII (1947), p. 177 and n. 180. 36 Thus Xenophanes says only that his " one god " is ovirL 6eas OvrToli- atv 6Aiottos ov86e Yvo7a, B 23; he does not think of saying that he has vO671ta, but no 5ea/as which would have served infinitely better his polemic against anthropomorphism. 2 353</page><page sequence="18">GREGORY VLASTOS. II A prime requisite of the historical interpretation of any phi- losopher, ancient or modern, is to determine the nexus with those of his contemporaries or predecessors who did the most both to supply him with a working-stock of basic concepts and also to provoke new questions in his own mind, calling for new answers and therewith new concepts. Who are the most likely candidates for the role in the case of Heraclitus ? A proper answer to this question would call for a much more extensive investigation than I could carry out in this paper. All I can do here is to propound a hypothesis, and follow it out, in the hope that the results so obtained will commend it to others. It is that the main historical influences on Heraclitus' thought were the great Milesians, Anaximander and Anaxi- menes, and that our best chance to understand the problems which confronted him and the meaning of his own answers to them is to discover as best we can the links which connect his thought with theirs. Though, I repeat, this is only a hypothesis, it is only fair to add that it is not an implausible one. For think of the suggested alternatives: Parmenides, Xenophanes, Pytha- goras. Each of the first two has found powerful exponents, but with results disproportionate to the resources expended on either hypothesis. Reinhardt's brilliant sponsorship of the view that Heraclitus' " roots " are in Parmenides was condemned to failure at the start by the indefensible chronology on which it was based.37 Gigon's attempt to link him with Xenophanes 38 sheds some light on Heraclitus' religious views but almost none on his cosmologieal and metaphysical conceptions. As for Pythagoras, 37 For the most recent criticism of his chronology, see Kirk, pp. 1-3. That in spite of this mistake Reinhardt's work has done so much to stimulate Heraclitean studies in the last forty years is a tribute to the vigor of his thinking, the incisiveness of his writing, and the breadth of his knowledge. The same qualities make his later papers (to the first of which I shall continue to refer), "Heraklits Lehre vom Feuer," and "Heraclitea," Hermes, LXXVII (1942), pp. 1 ff. and 225 ff., outstanding contributions. 38 Op. cit. For a critique of his theory of Heraclitus' dependence on Xenophanes see W. Broecker, Gnomon, XIII (1937), pp. 530 if. Though only a doctoral dissertation Gigon's is a challenging book, and Kirk has done well to devote so much time to the detailed discussion of its views. 354</page><page sequence="19">ON HERACLITUS. he is easily the candidate least likely to succeed, since what we know of his doctrine is so meager in itself, almost infinitesimal in comparison to what we know of Heraclitus; how can our ignorance of the former improve our knowledge of the latter ? 39 So by a process of elimination one is led back to the Milesians, where one should have started anyway. That Heraclitus knew their books has high antecedent probability, and is confirmed, quite apart from all the things I shall discuss below, by some meteorological details in which he followed them.40 That he 39 If this sounds unduly pessimistic, consider the possible borrowings: (I) metron (so Kirk, p. 403). But did this figure in the Pythagorean scheme? We don't know. Our evidence, such as it is, speaks of peras (in opposition to apeiron), not metron. But suppose metron was used as an alternate to peras; it would then refer, like the latter, to (a) ratios of odd-even numbers such as those of the concordant musical intervals (cf. Gnomon, XXV [1953], pp. 33-4) and/or (b) whole in- tegers, applied to things like justice, the soul, etc. (Arist., Met., 985b 29-31 and Ross ad loc.). Where does Heraclitus employ ratios as at (a) or numbers as at (b) in any comparable way? (II) logos. What is there analogous to either (a) or (b) in Heraclitus when he speaks of logos e.g. at B 1 or B 31b? A more interesting suggestion has come from Fraenkel, A.J.P., LIX (1938), pp. 309 ff. and Minar, C. P., XXXIV (1939), pp. 338 ff., who take the sense of logos borrowed from Pythagoras to be "proportional mean," i.e. the X:Y :: Y:Z ratio. But though a convincing case has been made by Fraenkel for Heraclitus' use of this "thought-pattern," there is no evidence that he derived it from Pythagoras, whose use of it is purely conjectural, and, if his- torical, would not have endeared it to one who thought him a charlatan (B 81). Moreover, though any proportion would be a logos, there is no evidence that when Heraclitus spoke of the logos or "the same logos" he was thinking of a proportional mean at all (cf. my elucidation of B 31b in the text below, where the required relation is equality, not geometric proportion) nor, conversely, that when he did use the three- term proportion (e. g. at B 83, ape: man : : man: god) he was thinking of this relation as a manifestation of what he called logos. 40 His explanation of thunder-lightning is that of Anaximander as modified by Anaximenes (Aet., III, 3,1,2, and 6): Anaximander explained this as a cloud-burst; Anaximenes, likening the phenomenon to the "sea, which flashes when divided by the oars," added the notion of external impact (which could be only that of wind on cloud) as the cause of the rending of the cloud; Heraclitus' explanation of thunder has both wind-impact on cloud (ePurrwaets 7rvevPUarwv els ra pe0') and compression (avarpoqdis) of cloud. by wind; and there is no reason to think that he offered a different explanation for lightning, as the con- fusing statement in Aetius might suggest. His "bowls" theory of 355</page><page sequence="20">GREGORY VLASTOS. had plenty of respect for them we may assume from the fact that they never figure in his vitriolic broadsides against promi- nent contemporaries and predecessors (B 40, B 42, B 56, B 57, B 81). To be known and not abused by a man of Heraclitus' temperament is tantamount to the receipt of a certificate of merit.

Both SLK1 and KaTa Xppedv occur also in Anaximander's famous frag- ment; and the thrice repeated reference to " war/strife " could hardly fail to allude to Anaximander's notion of the mutual aggression of the elements.41 But what is the criticism ? Kirk's answer-that while Anaximander held that "change between opposites involves a kind of injustice: on the contrary, he (Hera- clitus) held that strife between opposites was 'the right way,' normal and just" (p. 240)-takes us part of the way toward the answer; but not the whole way. To begin with we must notice the enormous difference of the role which "strife " plays in Heraclitus: " All things happen in accordance with strife" (B 80); " war is the father of all and king of all " (B 53). What is only occasional and intermittent, though recurrent, in Anaxi- mander, becomes universal and invariant in Heraclitus. Why the heavenly bodies follows Anaximander in attempting to provide for containers of their fiery substance, altering the shape of the holders to suit the disk-shaped bodies postulated by Anaximenes. Heraclitus must also have known the physical theories of Xenophanes, but made only one important borrowing from them: the doctrine that "the sun is new every day" (B 6), though this apparently meant for him that each day's sun is extinguished at night (Kirk, p. 267), while for Xenophanes it meant its " travelling on ad infinitum " (Aet., II, 24, 9). An interesting linguistic link between Heraclitus and Anaximenes is pointed out by Reinhardt (p. 16), &amp;axedaOat (Anaxim., A 7, A 8; Heracl., B 31b). 41 For my interpretation of Anaximander I must refer to "Equality and Justice in Early Greek Cosmologies," C.P., XLIII (1947), pp. 168 ff. (pp. 168-73 on Anaximander). Cf. also F. Dirlmeier, "Der Satz des Anaximandros," Rhein. Mus., LXXXVII (1938), pp. 376 ff., K.

We cannot answer this question without grant- ing the obvious implication of the river-fragments which Kirk formally denies (p. 367 et passim), the universality of change.42 That strife is universal follows from the assumption that what- ever exists is in change with the added assumption that all change is strife, neither of them made by Anaximander. What happens now to the latter's conviction that the world is a realm of "justice "? Anaximander could hold, and did, that there is both "injustice" and "justice" in the world; strife being injustice, and justice consisting in the eventual reparation of the encroachments gained by strife. To Heraclitus this presented an intolerable compromise. Concluding as he did that strife is universal, he would have to infer that, if strife itself were unjust, there could be nothing but injustice. For him there could be no half-way house: either all is injustice, or all is justice, in the physical world. He chose the second alternative, which he could only do by affirming, as he does in B 80, that "strife is justice." The last clause of this fragment-that " all things happen in ac- cordance with strife and rightful necessity "-is the completion of the thought which is affirmed in each of the preceding clauses.43 42 For my criticism see my review of Kirk's book in the July issue of this journal (LXXVI, pp. 310-13). 43 Kirk fails to see that 7r6Xeftov . . . tvvp6 in the first makes the same point as 8iKV 'Epltv in the second. He says that "in Homer and Archi- lochus Ares is described as impartial, but here war is said to be uni- versal; this surely must be the sense in view of frr. 2 and 114 and of the description of war as father and king of all in fr. 53" (p. 241). But this misses (a) the perfect connection between the Homeric refer- ence to war as tvvos because "it kills the killer," II., XVIII, 309, and Heraclitus' reason for saying that strife is just (see the following paragraph in the text); (b) the fact that at B 2 and B 114 5vvo6 does indeed have the sense of a norm (note 23, above) ; and (c) that the same sense is even present at B 53 which, of course, accents the uni- versality of war in the strongest terms but also refers to its function as creator (rara7p) and governor (fao-tXeis), a function which Hera- clitus surely regards as just since he says that war establishes the distinction, unquestionably right for him, between gods and men, free and slave. Even the full significance of 8IK7pV 9pLi is not brought out by Kirk, for he makes no mention of usages of Lpts, pIEKOS which would lend substance to their conception as instruments of justice (cf. latter half of note 134, C.P., XLII [1947], p. 170; and Fraenkel's fine eluci- dation of B 80 in the work cited at n. 25, above, pp. 481-2). 357</page><page sequence="22">GREGORY VLASTOS. Thus so far Heraclitus' thought is more intimately connected with Anaximander's than Kirk or any of the modern interpreters have recognized. Two of the fundamental ideas in Anaximander -that there is strife among the elements, and that a just order is nevertheless preserved-are re-asserted in a form which uni- versalizes both of them and thereby resolves the opposition between them: what is a "nevertheless" in Anaximander, be- comes a "because" in Heraclitus. The result is that no part of nature can "over-step its measures," which is surely the point of B 94,44 and not, as Kirk takes it, that "long-term excess is punished (and reduced)" (p. 402), which is precisely what Anaximander had taught, not Heraclitus. There can be no excess at all, long-term, or short-term either, if "all things happen in accordance with strife and rightful necessity." But when we turn to the next question, " Why is justice preserved in strife?," we find that Heraclitus stands in a very different relation to Anaximander. For the maintenance of justice the latter had relied immediately upon the equality of the elements. Now, as Kirk notes repeatedly, the notion of nature as an equi- librium of opposing forces does find a place in Heraclitus, though with the difference that the processes of encroachment and repa- ration are not successive, as in Anaximander, but concurrent: at every moment the main world-masses of fire, water, and earth are each giving up exactly as much as they take, each com- pensating constantly by the "death" they suffer (B 36) for the one they inflict.45 So much, I believe with Kirk, follows from B 31a: "the turnings of fire are first sea, and of sea the half is earth, half prester": the second clause can only mean that equal amounts of water are always turning back into fire and forward into earth, whence it would follow (a) that the total mass of water remains constant, consequently (b) that the total masses of fire and earth are also constant, since either of these can only change into or from water, and hence, for the same reason, (c) that fire and earth must also display the equipollence of change asserted of water in B 31a-an inference 44 As Reinhardt (Hermes, LXXVII [1942], p. 244, n. 2) has remarked, el d8e Ui7 in this fragment "driickt eine Unmoglichkeit aus, einen Fall, der nie eintreten wird, wie in fr. 121: ' Und wenn, dann .. .', worauf eine Negation folgt." 45 Cf. above, note 43 (a). 358</page><page sequence="23">ON HERACLITUS. explicitly confirmed in the case of fire by the balancing expres- sions, "kindling according to measures, and extinguished ac- cording to measures," in B 30. But note how short all this falls of preserving (let alone, extending) Anaximander's concept of equality as the guarantee of justice. For one thing, nothing is said to the effect that fire, water, and air are equal to one another. The assumption of the equality of the physical components of the world, re-asserted by Parmenides and Empedocles, is quietly dropped by Heraclitus; for Anaximander's equilibrium of elements he substitutes an equilibrium of processes of change. And even the latter is only a special case of 7raXlvrpo7ros apJov7). It applies only to those systems which do maintain themselves in a stable equilibrium. The world as a whole is such a system, and so is a river or, for that matter, the humblest candle-flame, so long as its mass remains constant. But many, indeed most, things within the world are not of this kind; there are rivers that dry up and flames that are put out. To uphold the justice of all strife Hera- clitus must fall back on another notion, more fundamental in his scheme than that of equipollent change: the constancy of a logos or metron preserved in all changes whatever. This is con- veyed, in part, in B 31b, whose sense is not correctly rendered by Kirk. "(Earth)46 is dispersed as sea and is measured in the 46 I agree with Kranz, Kirk, and others that &lt;7y&gt; is justified by the probability that it was in the text followed by Theophrastus (rdaciv re ai J 7iv Y/v XeiaOaL, Diog. Laert., IX, 9). This expansion is rejected by Walzer, Snell, Reinhardt (for the latter's defense see p. 16, n. 1; and cf. note 48, below). I fail to see what is gained by dropping &lt;7yi&gt; if OdaXaaca &amp;axe'eTra is to be understood to mean, as by Reinhardt (loc. cit.) "the sea passes from a solid to a liquid state "; its "solid state" is earth, so we are right back to the meaning of &lt;-7?&gt; but now without warrant from the text. If one is to forego the initial &lt;(7&gt;, one should accept the only meaning which Clement's text will then permit, i. e. that the sea is dispersed as fire. This makes excellent sense, especially if taken in conjunction with the suggestion in the following note. For my part, I prefer to stick by &lt;7r&gt; on the probability that this was in the text known to Theophrastus. But nothing of any great consequence depends on this. The general conclusion I reach from my interpretation of B 31b and B 90 (towards the close of the paragraph in the text above) would be exactly the same if B 31b referred to the change from sea to fire instead of from earth to sea. 359</page><page sequence="24">GREGORY VLASTOS. same logos as existed before [it became earth] "47 does not say or of itself imply that " sea is being constantly replenished by the liquefaction of earth proportionally with its diminution by condensation into earth " (p. 331). Heraclitus believes this, but it is not what he says here. What he does say is that any part of earth which becomes water has the same logos which it had before it had become earth, i. e., when a part of water, wl, becomes a part of earth, el, and then el changes back into a part of water, w2, then w2 is "measured in the same logos" as wl, or w2= wl, for short.48 B 90, "all things are an exchange for fire, and fire for all things, as wares (are exchanged) for gold and gold (is exchanged) for all things," identifies fire as the thing that remains constant in all transformations and implies that its measure is the same or common measure in all things. Thus, in the preceding instance, the same measure would obtain not only between wl and w2, but also between each of these and el, and similarly between all previous transformations of which wl is the last and all subsequent transformations of which w2 is the first, and in all cases for the same reason: each member of the 47 I am inclined to accept a suggestion made by Cherniss (in his seminar) and treat 7/ 'yevPcr6aL yij as a gloss: its presence makes for unnecessary stylistic clumsiness, and its absence would make no dif- ference to the sense; retaining (here contrary to Cherniss) the initial 7y7, the new text would still allow, indeed favor, the same reference of "before," sc. to the earth's antecedent liquid state. (But cf. also the following note.) Incidentally, I would argue that, if i yeveo'aat yi7 is a gloss, it must have been put in by someone who did have an initial yi7 in his text; for, if he did not, it would have been natural to take Odciaa?a as the subject, and, in that case, his gloss would probably have been X yeveoOat OdXaacaa. 48 Another possibility on the text suggested in the preceding note is that "before" refers to the earthy state before it turns into water, in which case it would be el which is said to have the same logos as w2. A variant of this is permitted by the Diels text, sc. that the logical subject of guerpeerat is earth before it turns into sea, in which case the equation would be el = wl. For obvious reasons, neither of these is as likely as the one suggested above, though the latter would avoid com- pletely Reinhardt's objection (loc. cit.) that on the expansion &lt;(y&gt; " 8LaXeerca Kai ,uerpeerat verschiedenes Subjekt erhalten," since the sub- ject of LeTrpeerat (as well as 8taXeeraL) would be 7yi. On the former interpretation here and that of my text above, 7y would still be the grammatical subject of lAerpeeTra, but not the logical one; this I do not find absurd, or even difficult, in this context. 360</page><page sequence="25">ON HERACLITUS. whole series represents the same amount of fire which is the common thing--ro .vvov--in all the different things that com- pose the series. Thus the ultimate guarantee of cosmic justice is fire: the invariance of its measures is what accounts for the observance of the metron in all things, and fire is therefore that which "governs" or "steers all things" (B 41, B 64, and n. 35, above). Towards the end of his discussion of B 90 Kirk remarks: "There remains one slight difficulty. . . . Fire is said to be an exchange for 'all things'; but fire itself must be one consti- tuent of ' all things'. . ." (p. 348). There is indeed a difficulty; but is it "slight" and is it "simply due to an unavoidable looseness of speech" (loc. cit.) ? If the trouble were merely verbal, Heraclitus could easily have avoided it by saying that 7rdvTa &lt;a aAXXa&gt; are an exchange for fire and fire &lt;rv 'XAov&gt; a7ravTov. The real difficulty is of quite another order. It is why Heraclitus should give to fire so unique and preiminent a place, when it is after all just one of three components of the cosmos whose mutual transformations are symmetrical. Why should not water or earth have as good a claim to the place of the " com- mon," since either one of them becomes in due course each of the others? Indeed why should any one of them be singled out as the " common "? And why should the whole world be " ever- living fire "? Are not water and earth also " ever-living," each of them, like fire, everlastingly " living " and " dying "? 49 49 I cannot understand how the earth could be for Heraclitus " das Starre, Gegensatzlose, Tote" (W. Broecker, op. cit., p. 532). How could anything be gegensatzlos in Heraclitus' world, and fail to exemplify both terms of the polarities, change-stability, life-death? Kirk refers approvingly (p. 342) to the remark of H. Gomperz that life, for Hera- clitus, consists in passing from a more solid to a more fluid state, while death is the reverse. This too is surely wrong as a generalization; true enough in the case of fire, it would be e.g. false in the case of earth, for which it would be death to pass into the more fluid state of water. The more common view is that while Heraclitus would exempt nothing from change, he would (a) think of fire as changing more rapidly than anything else and (b) choose fire as his arche for this reason. We need not doubt that Heraclitus believed (a), i. e. that the rate of "exchange " between fire and water is higher than of that between water and earth, though he never says this. Nor do I think that (b) is wrong, though I do think it an incomplete answer to the question raised in the text above. Certainly fire makes a better symbol of permanence through 361</page><page sequence="26">GREGORY VLASTOS. When Kirk faces up to this problem he thinks he can solve it as follows: " The fire in question (in B 30) is not simply that which burns in the hearth, because this has no claim to be more important or more primary than sea or earth. The cosmological fire must be thought of primarily as alO'p, that purer kind which in popular thought fills the upper region of the heavens and is considered to be divine and immortal" (p. 316). Whether popular thought at this time made this distinction between our fires and the fire of the celestial regions we do not know. What we do know is that it is not to be found in Heraclitus 50 nor in any pre-Socratic fragment, and that no Ionian philosopher thought of ' cosmological" fire, air, etc. as different in kind from that we see and handle every day. The first surviving text in which this peculiar notion is asserted is in Plato. It is he, not Heraclitus, who says that the fire in the heavens is " pure," as well as "fairest," "most honourable," etc., while ours is ov3ax7j ovSau(5 elALKptVES, Phil., 29B-30B.51 But even if Hera- clitus had made this distinction, how would it help to answer our question ? " Cosmological " fire would still be on a par with water and earth in the series of natural transformations, and the question why it should be elevated above the rest would remain unanswered. It cannot be answered, I submit, without taking account of a powerful historical influence which passes unnoticed in Kirk's book: that of Anaximenes.52 It is here that Hera- clitus found the cosmological pattern we are looking for and superimposed it upon the one he derived and developed from Anaximander. This pattern, in sharp opposition to Anaximan- der's, explains all the things that compose the world as a dif- change and life in death than does anything else. If he were only a poet, the superbly evocative power of this symbol would be an ample answer to my question. 5 Nor the parallel one between an Urfeuer and its Erscheinungs- formen in sun, prester, etc., assumed by Reinhardt, p. 16-an odd vestige of Zeller's theory, who needed an Urfeuer as a prop for the ekpyrosis. 61 Where this distinction in respect of the superior "purity," etc. of T elv TrI wavari over rO rap' fIUTv (or rT evpade) is extended to all the arrotxeLa, including earth (29D). Cf. C. P., XLII (1947), p. 176, n. 173. 62 All I can find in Kirk by way of reference to any major relation- ship between Anaximenes and Heraclitus is the casual remark, pp. 343-4, "It may be that Heraclitus' omission of air is a direct criticism of Anaximenes' acceptance of it." 362</page><page sequence="27">ON HERACLITUS. ferentiation of just one of them. Anaximenes' preference for this type of explanation must have been due partly (a) to a genuinely empirical impulse, eschewing an arche, like Anaxi- mander's, which must lie forever beyond experience, to put in its place one which is indisputably in this world, as well as out of it, and whose relation to experience can be properly explained (Hipp., Ref., I, 7, 2), and partly (b) to the conviction that the arche must be of the same stuff as that of the human soul,53 doubtless because he held with Anaximander that the arche which creates the world also governs it,54 and is therefore intel- ligent. Though both motives are discernible in Heraclitus, the second far outweighs the first and provides, in my view, the main explanation of the dominant role of fire in his cosmos. What may have led Kirk to ignore this link is his insistence that "the parallel between man and cosmos is first explicitly drawn by medical speculation in the fifth century" (p. 312). But it is drawn in Anaximenes, B 2; though much of the word- ing of this fragment is doubtful, there is no good reason to doubt that it paraphrases an analogy drawn by Anaximenes himself.55 63 Which is air: A 22 and 23; also Aet., I, 3, 4, listed as B 2 in Vors.%, on which see note 55, below. 4t Arist., Phys., 203b 11 ff.: Kai 7repLexe&amp;v a&amp;ravra Kat wadvTa KvpepvYv, Ws q&gt;aa o' ToT /Ii7 TroLovau 7rap&amp;a rb a7retpov \XXas alritas olov voUv 77 tLXiav, which would certainly include Anaximenes. That air 7repLexet the world is also in Anaximenes, B 2. Cf. W. Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (Oxford, 1947), pp. 29-30 and notes; and on the significance of the ascription of ?repLteXev to the arche cf. also C. P., XLII (1947), p. 173, n. 153. 66 The upshot of the controversy about this fragment-for the best on either side see Reinhardt, Kosmos und Sympathie (Munich, 1926), pp. 209-13, and Kranz, Hermes, LXXIII (1938), p. 111 and Gott. Nachr., 1938, p. 145-is surely that it should now be regarded as an "A" fragment. How can avyKpaTre be defended for Anaximenes when there is no known use of the word prior to the Christian era? Nor is there any pre-Socratic parallel for the notion that the soul holds the body together while, as Reinhardt points out, this was a common Stoic view. On the other hand, there can be absolutely no objection to the statement that the air 7repte'Xe the world (cf. n. 54, above); Tbv lIov K6oa-Lo is doubtful (Kranz cites its occurrence in Philol., B 1, but this is not conclusive), though possible (cf. n. 19, above). Moreover, the comparison of a human with a cosmic phenomenon is also reported for Anaximenes at A 7, 6; Kranz compares &amp;'nrepeai repi r'7v j'ieTE'pav KeqfaX,7v there with otov 4 lvX' ) i JuerTpa here. Finally, the man-world analogy 363</page><page sequence="28">GREGORY VLASTOS. And even if we were to throw it all out, we would still have the fact, independently attested, that Anaximenes made air both the arche of all things and the stuff of the human soul, and this suffices for our purpose, for this is precisely what Heraclitus does, merely substituting fire for air. A variety of convergent reasons would prompt this substitution in the case of the soul. As the principle of life, soul would be naturally thought of as fire, since the warmth which persists throughout life and fails only after death, was a fact of ordinary experience.56 As the is also implied by Anaximenes' close follower, Diogenes of Apollonia, when he argues that the same thing, air, is that by which man lives and thinks (B 4; B 5 sub fin.; A 19, 42 sub fin.) and that which governs and thinks in the world. As to what stood for the improbable 9eyKpaTei V4gas in the original, the simplest guess is ,Luguv Kpar'et. Fraenkel (op. cit., p. 348, n. 20) thinks it anachronistic to credit Anaximenes with the notion of the soul ruling man or his body. Certainly there is no known elaboration of this idea before Plato. But it would be taken for granted from the moment the psyche was identified with the thinking, willing self and hence accorded the power of controlling the body or its functions expressed by Kpareetv and its derivatives (cf. 0KeXE'wv re Kat Xeipwv ldKpaTees, Hipp., Art., 48; 'yXoS-as daKpar)s, Aesch., P. V., 884; avroi KcpareeLv for the self-control which is lost in drunkenness, Antiphon, Or., V, 26). This concept of the psyche is amply documented in Hera- clitus (cf. especially B 118 with B 117), and there is no reason why it cannot go back to Anaximenes. 56 Anaximenes himself would have had to take account of this fact. Cf. Diog., B 5, 7 ivX7 a . . ., Cap OepioTrepos 70rou ecw ev O e-ev. This would make the transition (from 'hot air' to 'fire') all the easier for Hera- clitus. It is possible, perhaps probable, that Anaximenes had also anticipated Heraclitus in explaining sleep and drunkenness as due to the moistening of the soul, for we know that Diogenes of Apollonia held this view (A 19,44). In an interesting paper (Hermes, LXXVI [1941], pp. 359 ff.) Diller attributes these and other similarities between Heraclitus and Diogenes to the direct influence of the former upon the latter. This I very much doubt, since the true affinities of Diogenes- in style (cf. Anaximenes, A 1, KeXp-7ra .. . Xe'et . . . airX. Kail areplrrT, with Diog., B 1, rT' ep/Lypeiav &amp;rr\Xjv KaL a-eLyev'), main cosmological doc- trine (the same arche, air, infinite, giving rise to an infinity of worlds), and primarily " scientific " bent of mind with no discernible ethical or political interests-are with Anaximenes. It is most unlikely that Diogenes would take over the details noticed by Diller from a thinker with whose temper and fundamental doctrine he was so much out of line. Things common to Heraclitus and Diogenes are much more likely to be derived by Heraclitus from Anaximenes, and by Diogenes either directly from Anaximenes or from intermediaries other than Heraclitus. 364</page><page sequence="29">ON HERACLITUS. principle of thought, soul would be connected both (a) with the heat of fire, since that lapse of intelligence which looms so large in Heraclitus' psychological reflections, sleep, was generally regarded as due to a reduction of organic heat,57 and (b) with its light, because of the inevitable association of truth and knowl- edge with light, of error or ignorance with darkness.58 Now since his cosmos is "ever-living" and is "governed" by a gnome, what would be more natural for him than to ascribe the principles of life and intelligence in the cosmos to the same stuff to which he assigned them in the case of man? That the analogy between this cosmic fire and man's fiery soul was so complete for him that it amounts to identity we know from B 36, where he says " souls " when he means " fire "; as Kirk rightly remarks (p. 341), "Heraclitus has here put soul in the place of cosmic fire." Renouncing the Milesian concept of an arche which " contains" the world, he would have to give a physical explanation of the world's " government " by the arche in terms of the physical relation of fire to everything else in the world; and this he did, as we have seen, by imputing to fire the common measure whose preservation throughout all change ensures the " justice" of all "strife." This reconstruction, I submit, ex- plains why fire should have in his system its otherwise inex- plicable preiminence over water and earth; and it does so by showing how an idea, derived initially from Anaximenes, was grafted upon a concept of justice-in-strife developed from ideas supplied by Anaximander. Two other cosmological doctrines-his affirmation of the eter- nity of the world (B 30), and his denial of the infinity of fire and therewith of the sum-total of existence 59-tell against both 57 Parm., 46b, somnum . . .

It is strange that this important doctrine should be so seldom noticed in the modern literature; Kirk is typical in ignoring it completely. It is briefly recognized in Zeller-Nestle, op. cit., pp. 862-3, but with the suggestion that Heraclitus did not assert this doctrine explicitly; I see no reason for this opinion: he 365</page><page sequence="30">GREGORY VLASTOS. Anaximander and Anaximenes. Their significance is best ap- preciated in terms of his rejection of the Milesian axiom that the world is derived from and "governed " by an everlasting and infinite substance which "contains" it. For Anaximander the creative source of the world is wholly outside of it; for Anaxi- menes it is both in and beyond the world; for Heraclitus it is wholly within the world, which is itself the theatre of the cease- less and regular transformations of fire, therefore self-creating, self-governing, self-contained. He could thus transfer to the world that eternal life and youth which was always for the Greeks the unique privilege of divinity. To express this he employs in B 30 not only the solemn, traditional formula, "ever was and is and shall be," 60 but also the new and proud affirma- tion, "ever-living," in place of the canonical negatives, " death- less, ageless" (Anaximander, B 2, B 3) for which he had no use anyhow, since for him the condition of life ever-lasting :is not deathlessness but life endlessly renewed by death in a process where youth and age are " the same " (B 88). We do not know what form of expression he gave to his denial of the infinity of fire and the totality of being; all we learn from Aristotle and Theophrastus is that he did, without even a hint of his reasons. These we must reconstruct, and our only clue to them is in his new, anti-Milesian concept of the relation of the world-creating arche to its creatures. If the two are one, as in Heraclitus, then the arche neither need, nor can, be infinite. It need not, for no matter how limited may be its mass, its energy, ever-renewed by reabsorbing its own creatures, is inexhaustible, and thus suf- ficient to maintain it for all time to come. It can not, for it is interdependent with its creatures, and can be no more infinite than they; if it were, the balance of their mutual "exchanges would be completely upset.61 would have every reason for doing so against Anaximander and Anaxi- menes, if he did not believe in the infinity of fire. 60 Reinhardt, pp. 10-11; also in Parmenides, p. 176, n. 2. 61 One might still ask why the creatures too could not be infinite. The question could hardly have bothered Heraclitus. He must have assumed, as did every known thinker of classical Greece, that the visible world is finite in extension; the only thing ever held to be infinite was something either beyond the visible world, as for the Milesians and many others after them, or of a different order of being from it, as for Melissus, who was also the first to offer a formal argument against the possibility of more than one infinite being (B 6). 366</page><page sequence="31">ON HERACLITUS. Finally, what of that doctrine which many in the ancient world considered his most original invention,62 the unity of the many and the sameness of opposites? If, as Kirk says from time to time (e. g. pp. 121, 344, 402), this only meant for Hera- clitus that " opposites are essentially connected " or " not really disconnected," how could we think of it as Heraclitus' "great discovery " (Kirk, p. 344) ? That the many and different things which compose the world are all essentially connected, so much so, that they are all one and the same thing, is the rudimentary truth about the world as conceived by Anaximenes.63 When Heraclitus declared that "all things (come) from one and one from all" (B 10) or even that " all things are one" (B 50), he was saying something with which Anaximenes would have agreed as a matter of course. But the difference would still be enor- mous. The sense of the unity of all things would be both lucid and prosaic for Anaximenes: simply, that all things are differ- entiations of air.64 Heraclitus' speculative imagination trans- forms this straightforward cosmological theorem into an asser- tion of the unity of all differences whatever, including moral ones, and pursues its consequences to that reckless and bewilder- ing conclusion that " for god all things are fair and good and just" (B 102) which, if true, would be fatal for all morality, not excepting his own.65 I cannot discuss here the fragments e2 As Philo tells us, Quis rer. div. haer., 505. e8 And is spelled out in the only exposition of this type of cosmology available to us in extant fragments, that of Diogenes (at B 2). 64 For an excellent statement of this aspect of Heraclitus' relation to Anaximenes see Cherniss, op. cit., pp. 331 ff. 66 Kirk (pp. 180-1), following Wilamowitz and others, argues that the second part of the fragment, avOpwroot e a / ev &amp;t LKa vireLXKcas'Lv a 8&amp; 8LKata, can hardly be wholly authentic; vireLX \i)aOr, though barely possible, is most unlikely for Heraclitus. Kirk underwrites Mazzantini's suggestion that the original read something like advepwnrois e a fa&amp; d6LKa a ae 8iKata. With all this I agree. But what follows for the sense of the whole fragment? Man's wisdom is to god's what an ape's is to man's (B 83); since men's moral distinctions do not exist for god (first sentence of B 102), must they not be ultimately illusory? I fail to see how this difficulty is solved by Kirk's elucidation: moral distinctions, he says, submerged only for (god's) "synthetic" view, are still "necessary" and "legitimate" for the "analytical" view (man's), pp. 180-1. But what Kirk calls the "synthetic" view is "wisdom" for Heraclitus (B 50) -not only for god, but for man too 367</page><page sequence="32">GREGORY VLASTOS. which assert this and other aspects of the most paradoxical of all his doctrines and explore its connection with the doctrines of the justice of all strife and palintropos harmonia. Of Kirk's interpretation of these fragments I shall merely remark that it is sober and sensible throughout, and that its only fault is to discount that part of their sense which is inherently obscure and, so far as it is clear, profoundly disturbing not only to the moralist but also to the logician. It proved disturbing enough to the latter to provoke in Parmenides a reaction, violent in the extreme,66 yet immensely fruitful, for it issued in a doctrine of Being which served as the foundation of the great cosmo- logical constructions of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the atom- ists. In a singularly Heraclitean turn of events, Heraclitus, ignored in Ionia 67 by the best minds of the generation that followed him, lived in them only through the death of his own system in Parmenides.

Hence the wiser man becomes, the closer he comes to the view that "all things are fair and good and just," and if this does not make moral distinctions illusory, I do not know what would. 66 Cf. Cherniss, op. cit., pp. 336 ff. 67 I say "Ionia" to allow for some Heraclitean influence on Em- pedocles (C.P., XLII [1947], pp. 164-5), though it is subordinate to that of Parmenides. In Ionia itself not one of Heraclitus' distinctive doctrines is conserved by Anaxagoras or Leucippus; so far as we know, they do not even acknowledge their existence by a word of refutation. Democritus must have known intimately Heraclitus' book, for it in- fluenced his style (E. Norden, Antike Kunstprosa, I [Berlin, 1915], pp. 22-3) and doubtless also some of his ethical reflections; but he too writes cosmology and ontology as though Heraclitus had never existed. The only possible anti-Heraclitean polemic is Melissus, B 8 (so Kirk, p. 140), a feeble echo of Parmenides' great assault. 368</page></plain_text>
