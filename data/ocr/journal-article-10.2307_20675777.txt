<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA FAGIOLI: DE DIVINA PROPORTIONE, CHAPTER 541 Investigations of Renaissance architectural theory have not been confined to the writings of practicing architects. The contributions of Fra Luca Pacioli, in particular, have often been discussed ;2 for even though Pacioli is best known for his mathematical work, his treatises are not confined to arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. His Dwina proportione contains a number of scattered comments con cerning architectural theory and practice. The first part of this book, devoted to the five regular polyhedra and other three-dimen sional bodies, was written in Milan between 1496 and 1498 ; Leonardo da Vinci provided the illustrations. Chapter fifty-four, ostensibly a discussion of a seventy-two faced body, is in actuality a miniature architectural treatise. Pacioli first asserts that the seventy-two faced polyhedron was employed by architects as a model for buildings, and then he attacks contemporary architects who did not follow Vitruvius. Included in this assault is a consideration of the impor tance of geometric theory to architecture. The friar's comments deserve careful analysis. He had, after all, worked in the major Italian centers?Venice, Perugia, Naples, Florence, Rome and Urbino ?and was now in Milan in the company of Leonardo and Bramante. An examination of chapter fifty-four follows the Italian version and English translation.3 11 would like to express my thanks to Professors Carlo Pedretti and Andr?

RACKUSIN LIV Among these [bodies], exalted Duke, it is fitting to place the body of seventy-two faces which our Megarene philosopher describes fully in the fourteenth of his twenty books. This [body], although it has its planar faces with irregular sides and angles, cannot be said to depend on or derive from any of the regular bodies ; but rather it is formed and created, conforming to what our philosopher demonstrates in the said place, by means of the dodecagonal figure, that is to say, of twelve equal sides. And of its aforementioned faces, forty-eight are nonequilateral, nonequiangular quadrangles, and have only the two opposite sides which face towards one or the other pole or cone equal to each other ; and its other twenty-four faces are, similarly, nonequilateral triangles. Of these, twelve are directed towards one of the cones and twelve towards the other, and every one of them has two equal sides, which are those that are directed towards the inferior pole and towards the superior one. From this [body] one could, also, always form its elevated one, as has been done with the others ; but because of the irregularity of its faces comprehension of it will be difficult, although it would have no little charm to the eye. It [the elevated body] would have seventy-two pyramids in accor dance with the number of seventy-two faces, and the faces of these pyramids would also be those of the body which is supposedly inside. I have not bothered myself with deducing the form of this elevated body, but leave the task to the reader, in whose intelligence I do not lack confidence. And this seventy-two-faced body is often used by architects in their designing of buildings because of its being a very suitable form, the most so where tribunes or other vaults, or we should say ceilings, are necessary. And even though so many faces are not always employed in the said edifices, nevertheless [the archi tects] use forms similar to that body, taking from it a fourth or third part in all ways according to the place and the position where they propose to situate such a building. Following this very fitting model, [buildings] are found designed and constructed in diverse areas, as is seen in the inestimable ancient temple the Pantheon, which is today called the Rotunda by the Christians in the capital of the world. This temple was designed with such diligent industry and attention to proportions that the light of one sole round aperture in its open ceiling is enough to render the entire interior splendid and bright. I will not speak of many other famous and illustrious cities like Florence, Venice, Padua, Naples and Bologna, in which many build ings have been constructed, sacred or profane, large or small, on the model of this [body]. Also here in your Milan, in the worthy sanc tuary of Santo Scettro, the decorated chapel is formed by a part cut</page><page sequence="5">THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI 483 from this [body], with the reservation of having been applied to the somewhat convex wall surface ; and on each of its faces is a large rosette as an ornament. And in your pious and most sacred temple [Santa Maria] de le Gratie, the tribune corresponding to the main altar, and the lateral tribunes, are nothing but a similar part of this body, but their faces are more adorned. And however well many arbitrarily devise and design forms, not having greater knowledge of Vitruvius than of any other architect they nevertheless apply the art even though they do not know it. In the same manner Aristotle said of the rustic peasants that "they make errors and do not know they make errors." So also these [architects] "use art and do not know how to use it." Additionally the tailor and the shoemaker apply geometry and do not know what it is. In the same manner masons, carpenters, ironsmiths and all artisans employ measurement and proportion without knowing what they are, since as has been said other times, all things consist of number, weight, and measure ment. But what shall we say of the modern edifices as a class? They are arranged and planned with varied and diverse models that by their smallness offer some charm to the eye, and then in the actual buildings do not support the weight. And very far from lasting one thousand years, the buildings already fall in ruins in the third. [Their builders], because of their bad conduct, have to spend more to redo than to construct [the first time]. They are called architects, and never even saw the covers of the most excellent volume of our very worthy architect and great mathematician Vitruvius, who wrote "De architectural with the paramount documents about every class of structure. He who separates himself from the said author hoes the water and builds on sand, and very soon loses the art ; there are architects of renown who do not know the difference which exists between the point and the line or the differences of the angles, with out which [knowledge] it is not possible to build well. This is demon strated by, as our aforementioned Vitruvius says, the utmost jubi lation and great merriment which Pythagoras had when with sure science he hit upon the true proportion of the two straight lines which contain the right angle of the square, for which [discovery] he immo lated one hundred oxen, making a great sacrifice to and festival for the gods. And this angle is of such excellence that it can never be varied, and by another name the perfect geometers call it "Angulum iustitae since without knowledge of it it is not possible to distin guish the good from the bad in any of our works, and without it one could not in any way obtain any sure measurement. From here to the modern shoemakers with their edifices?it seems to them that they accomplish nothing if, parting from the right and obligatory antique norm, they do not introduce some nuisance of their foolish ness, censuring those (there are some who can still be found) who are</page><page sequence="6">484 . RACKUSIN returning to the true antique norm. And they are those who enjoy our mathematical disciplines, searching for the true guide of all edifices in the works of the aforementioned Vitruvius. In separating from him one can see how our edifices are, divine and profane : that which is awry is doubly so. For this reason the word and its effect of Your Highness give a most suitable result of ridding us of all the wrongs. And continuing what has already been started, your Milan will not have less beauty than Florence ; in brief you will turn it from the abominable and inept impression, removing its authors. Because, in truth, [Your Highness] understands more of such things, asleep, than those wide awake with one thousand eyes ; a similar thing was demonstrated by your close relation the most illustrious Duke of Urbino in the admirable construction of his aforementioned worthy palace. And this with the pardon of those who have taken ill what has been said up to now for their instruction ; and this is enough in what respects the said body. * * * Pacioli begins by describing the seventy-two-faced (figs. 1 and 2), citing its appearance in book twelve, proposition fourteen of Euclid's Elements. He is probably referring to the thirteenth-century manu script of Giovanni Campano da Novara, which circulated widely and was finally published in Venice in 1482, providing the basis for Pacioli's own edition of the Elements (Venice, 1509). Campano's work does indeed describe the body in book twelve, proposition 14, fol. 044v-045v. It is constructed as a solution to the following prob lem : given two concentric spheres, how can a polyhedron be inscribed in the larger sphere without any of its faces touching the surface of the smaller one? Interestingly, not all translations of the Elements solve this problem by constructing a seventy-two-faced figure. Billingsley's and Dee's English edition of 1570, apparently following a different test of Euclid, used another approach. The result was a polyhedron of one hundred and twenty-eight faces. In his "Mathematicall Praeface" to the work, John Dee mentioned other vernacular editions?among them Pacioli's?so it is likely that Dee and Billingsley were aware of any differences from earlier versions. However, they offered no expla nation for this particular divergence. They also changed the position of the proposition, making it proposition seventeen instead of four teen.4 It is found in the same form and location in the milestone 1883-88 edition by Heiberg, which subsequent translations have fol 4 Euclid, Elements, trans.

This version established what is generally considered as the definitive text of Euclid, and was the result of Heiberg's detailed investigation of hundreds of manuscripts. The tradition of the seventy-two-faced figure was once and for all displaced by that of the one hundred and twenty-eight-faced body. Apparently, Heiberg had found that the seventy-two-faced construction was spurious. He additionally found that the fourteenth and fifteenth books of the Elements?which also deal with solid geometry?were not genuine. The former is of disputed authorship,5 but the latter is probably due at least in part to the circle of Isidore of Miletus, architect of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.6 This fifteenth book is especially con cerned with inscribing the regular solids in spheres. It is possible that Isidore's circle of architects, so interested in spheres and inscribed polyhedra, contributed the book twelve construction of a seventy two-faced body. The importance of a connection of the figure to architecture will soon become evident. Before proceeding to architectural concerns, Pacioli mentions the "elevated" form of the polyhedron. This form is obtained by placing a pyramid atop each of the seventy-two faces. Since the result is a highly complex figure resembling a mace, it is no wonder that Pacioli preferred to "leave to the reader" its visualization. After his description of the polyhedron, Pacioli asserts that it "... is often used by architects in their designing of buildings because of its being a very suitable form, the most so where tribunes or other vaults, or we should say ceilings, are necessary." The use of the polyhedron as a model could produce a simple circular plan, or a dodecagonal one since a horizontal cross-section of the body yields a dodecagon. At times architects did not use the entire polyhedron, Pacioli notes, but instead employed "a fourth or third part" of it. The fourth part would be obtained by cutting out of the figure a section of three layers with six faces each. Similarly, the third part is a cut of four layers with six faces each. (See figs. 3a and 3b.) These portions would appropriate as models for tribunes or apses. The "third part" could also denote a domical section of the body. If the polyhedron's top two layers are cut from the rest of the figure, a dome with twenty-four faces is produced ; see fig. 3c. (The fourth part, or eighteen faces, could not yield a dome. Any domical cut of the body must have twelve faces, or a multiple of twelve, because a horizontal cross-section of the polyhedron is always a twelve-sided figure.) 5 The fourteenth book of the Elements is often attributed, to Hypsicles, a Greek astronomer thought to have lived in the second, half of the second century B.C. C. B. Boyer, A History of Mathematics, New York, 1968, p. 130. 6 Ibid., p. 131.</page><page sequence="11">. RACKUSIN 487 As examples of buildings modeled on part or all of the seventy two-faced body, Pacioli cites the Pantheon in Rome, and Santo Scettro and Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. If his statements are true, they would become major additions to our knowledge of Renaissance (and, for that matter, Roman) architectural theory. However, a detailed investigation of both the writings of architect theoreticians, and of actual buildings, does not support a literal inter pretation of Pacioli's assertions. Vitruvius' De architecture:, which prompted great praise from Pacioli, makes no mention of a seventy-two-faced body or any part of one. Polygonal plans are not discussed at all. Circular buildings are cited in chapter eight of book four, which deals with temple plans. An ordinary sphere is employed as a model: "The proportions of the roof in the center should be such that the height of the rotunda, excluding the finial, is equivalent to one-half the diameter of the whole work." 7 The result is a hemispherical structure. The Pantheon as we know it today was not built until more than a century after Vitruvius' activity. There is no evidence that the Pantheon was based on the form of a polyhedron rather than a simple sphere. If any polyhedron was in fact involved, the presence of eight niches suggests use of a figure different from Paci?las. As was noted earlier, a horizontal cross-section of the seventy-two-faced body is a dodecagon?not an octagon. Could the friar have meant that only the Pantheon dome was based on his polyhedron ? If its coffers are viewed as faces, the hemispherical dome could be considered as one-half of a faceted sphere. Pacioli did not write that architects used one-half of the polyhedron ; he only mentioned a third and fourth part. Furthermore, for the dome to have been modeled on a seventy-two-faced body, thirty-six coffers should appear?far fewer than the number actually present (over one hundred). Thus, there is no trace of the use of Pacioli's polyhedron or any part of it as a prototype for the Pantheon. As far as Renaissance architectural theoreticians are concerned, none mentions the seventy-two-faced body as a model for the Pantheon or any other building. A dodecagonal ground plan, obtainable by cutting a horizontal cross-section of the body, appears to have held no special fascination for these architects. Alberti says nothing of the polyhedron. He writes of circular and polygonal plans in De re aediflcatoria, but the polygons he emphasizes are figures of six, eight, and ten sides.8 Alberti mentions the Pantheon (briefly) three times ; the only note about its plan 7 ViTRUvius, De architectura, bk. 4, ch. 8. 8 Leon Battista Alberti, De re aedificatoria, bk. 4, eh. 7.</page><page sequence="12">488 THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI consists of a few words of praise for the system of niches and aper tures, which lightens the weight of the walls.9 Neither does Filarete discuss the seventy-two-faced body. Even if he were aware of the tradition cited by Pacioli, Filarete apparently would not have cared to follow it. Churches, he asserts, should be designed in the form of a cross in reverence to Christ. Circular and polygonal plans were employed in antiquity "because were idolators and lacked respect." Among these idolatrous structures, Filarete cites the Pantheon.10 Francesco di Giorgio Martini, unlike Filarete, approved of circular and polygonal plans. Nevertheless, his treatises show no interest in the seventy-two-faced polyhedron or any part of it. Dodecagons do not seem to have concerned him, although he does place some empha sis on pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, and decagonal plans.11 Francesco di Giorgio's notebooks contain several views of the Pantheon, but in his actual writings he cites it only once in passing ; the polyhedron fails to appear in this context.12 Cesariano's 1521 edition of Vitruvius also contains no discussion of the seventy-two-faced body. This is most significant, for it is here, if anywhere, that the figure would be cited. Cesariano was a pupil of Bramante.13 In the 1480's and 90's Bramante had worked on Santo Scettro (San Satiro)14 and Santa Maria delle Grazie? both seen by Pacioli as modeled on the polyhedron. Cesariano makes no reference to the body, even though he knew of Pacioli and De divina proportione ; he refers to the friar several times.15 The Pan theon is mentioned, briefly, four times, and once again Pacioli's polyhedron does not appear. Yet another treatise requiring our attention if Sebastiano Serlio's Libri d'architettura. Here, Serlio asserts that among architectural plans "la forma tonda ? la pi? perfetta di tutte le altre".16 He discusses a number of circular and polygonal ground plans, noting that "Doppo la forma circulare sono molte forme che tendono a 9 Book 6, chapter 11 discusses the bronze roofing of the Pantheon. Book 8, chapter 11 numbers the rotunda among the buildings of antiquity which had not remained intact and undisturbed through the centuries. Book 8, chapter 10 praises the system of niches and apertures in the Pantheon's walls. 10 Filarete, Trattato di architettura, bk. 7, fol. 48r. 11 Francesco di Giorgio, Codice Torinese Saluzziano 148, fol. 12v-13v. 12 Francesco di Giorgio, Codice Senese S.

Fottogona, cio? di otto faccie, la esagona, cio? di sei faccie, la pentagona di cinque faccie : ed appresso si possono fare diuerse forme di pi? lati, che tutte tendono alla rotondit?".17 But a dodecagonal ground plan holds no particular fascination for him, and the seventy-two-faced body is ignored. In his discussion of the ancient buildings of Italy, Serlio devotes a great deal of attention to the Pantheon. He emphasizes that its perfection derives from the use of the perfect form?the circle? and from harmonious measurements resulting in the correspondence of the parts to each other and to the whole. This leads him into a somewhat anthropomorphic metaphor : "E forse il prefato Architetto considerando che tutte la cose che procedono ordinatamente, hanno un principale, e sol capo, dal quale dipendono gli altri inferiori, uolse che questo edif?cio hauesse um lume solo...."18 But nowhere does Serlio mention the use of a seventy-two-faced model, even when discussing the Tempietto of Bramante himself.19 The same omission is apparent in the nearly contemporary Quattro Libri di Architettura by Pietro Cantaneo Senese (Venice, 1554). Cataneo does not prefer any one type of plan, observing that " la variet? porga bellezza".20 He, too, discusses the Pantheon, deeming it "cosi ben architettato".21 But he says nothing of a seventy-two faced model here or anywhere else in the book, nor does he emphasize dodecagonal ground plans. Palladio, the final architectural theoretician we shall consider, again does not mention the polyhedron, although he does discuss the Tempietto. He declares that Bramante was "il primo ? metter in luce la buona, e bella architettura, che da gli Antichi fin '? quel tempo era stata nascora" ; for this reason "m'? paruto con ragione douersi dar luogo fra le antiche alle opere sue".22 Among these antique structures is the Pantheon. Palladio indicates that it is based on a spherical model ("? di figura del mondo"), but says nothing of a seventy-two-faced body.23 Palladio himself prefers circle and square ground plans, and does not specifically mention or advo cate dodecagonal plans : 17 Ibid., bk. 1, fol. 14r.

Nor does the Pantheon itself, as they saw it, exhibit traces of such a model. Still, Pacioli not only insists that architects employed it, but also cites two specific instances of its use : Santo Scettro and Santa Maria delle Grazie. A glance at each is in order. In the last quarter of the Quattrocento, construction began on a new church adjacent to the little Carolingian chapel of Santo Scettro, now known as San Satiro. Bramante was involved in the project. It is not known precisely when he was given the commission, but the first time his name appears in connection with this church is in a document dated December 4, 1482.25 He attached to the sacristy an oblong room, with barrel-vaulted bays to either side of the central domed space. Shell-hooded niches run along the walls. A change of plan resulted in the oratory's becoming a transept, to which Bramante attached an Albertian single-story, barrel-vaulted nave. The nave arches, supported by piers, lead to side chapels. In actual plan the church has the form of a St. Anthony's cross ; but Bramante transformed the choir, only a few feet deep at most, into an illus tionistic three-bay extension. It is apparently this choir that Pacioli refers to when he notes that "the decorated chapel is formed by a part cut from this [body], with the reservation of having been applied to the somewhat convex wall surface ; and on each of its faces is a large rosette as an ornament." The "faces" are apparently the interior coffers, which are adorned with rosettes. Pacioli indicates that due to the shallowness of the choir, the third or fourth part of his polyhedron needed to be adjusted to the somewhat convex (as seen from the exterior) wall surface. Normally the use of the third or fourth part should result in a more ample interior space, and thus a more marked curving profile on the exterior. Pacioli could not mean that the "faces" of the choir are identical with the faces of the polyhedron section, since the choir has far too many coffers. In fact, even though use of the section is most plausible, there is no visual evidence that Bramante had it in mind. The same is true of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In 1492, Duke Ludovico Sforza decided to rebuild its apse and transepts, apparently 24 Ibid., bk. 4, ch. 17, p. 64. 25 A. Bruschi, Bramante architetto, Bari, 1969, xxvii.</page><page sequence="15">. RACKUSIN 491 with the idea of using the church as his family mausoleum.26 Al though no documentary evidence links Bramante's name with the construction, opinion is unanimous that he was responsible for the project. As with other mausoleum-church/chapel plans (for example, the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo in Florence, and the Portinari Chapel of San Eustorgio in Milan), the emphasis is placed on a centralized cubic volume surmounted by a dome. The large semicircular spaces at the sides and the extended apse result in an interplay of volumes, This is in accord with increasing contemporary interest in centrally planned churches, which were seen to reflect God's perfection by emphasizing the perfect forms of the square and the circle (more on this later). The interior of this church is highly ornate, with medallions, oculi, coffers, wheel forms, and so on. The foreportion of the choir alone boasts a remarkable series of circular forms?medallions and oculi?on the upper part of the walls and the dome ; the apse behind displays a frieze of rectangles, each with a centrally placed medallion, and a coffered hood above. Pacioli's use of the word "faces" is unclear ; a plausible interpretation is that the tribunes' "faces" are simply their surfaces. But again we cannot take his mention of the polyhedron literally, for there is no visible evidence that Bramante specifically used the figure as a model for this church or any part of it. In addition to citing buildings in Milan which were supposedly modeled on the polyhedron, Pacioli mentions other cities with such structures : Florence, Venice, Padua, Naples, and Bologna. The circular forms of Saint Mark's Catedral in Venice were probably on Pacioli's mind. As for other cities, the friar was most likely referring to baptisteries. The usual octagonal shape of a baptistery can be thought of as deriving from a circle. But neither Saint Mark's nor octagonal forms have any perceptible connection with a seventy two-faced body, or a part of it. Thus an examination of architectural treatises, and actual struc tures, has failed to disclose evidence of any use of Pacioli's polyhedron. Obviously a literal interpretation of his words will not do. What, then, might be the symbolic connotations of the seventy-two-faced body? Pacioli, it should be remembered, was a mystic. The very title of his book points to his attitude toward mathematics?it is not "On Proportion," but instead "On Divine Proportion". The work was written with the idea that numbers, proportions, and geometrical figures are connected with God. Numerology runs throughout ; for example, Pacioli discusses thirteen properties of the "Golden Section" 26 Ibid., p. 784, with full bibliography. For further documentary evidence, see C. Pedretti in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, XXXII, 1973, p. 30-42.</page><page sequence="16">492 THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI in honor of the twelve Apostles and Christ.27 Pacioli intended the Divina proportioned discussions of numbers and solid geometry to foster Pythagoreo-Platonic contemplation by practicing artists, in order to relate their works to cosmic mathematical harmonies. This was a preoccupation with him, seen before in his Summa (1494) and again in his little treatise on architecture (published with the Divina proportione in 1509).28 The earlier Renaissance link of the arts to science, then accomplished in order to raise the former to the status of liberal arts, took on Neoplatonic overtones in the later part of the Quattrocento.29 Pacioli's insistence on architects' use of a seventy two-faced polyhedron is but one example of this movement. Numerologically, the number seventy-two and its components are charged with symbolism. Seventy-two is 1x2x3x3x4. As a group, these numbers represent the octave (1:2, 2 : 4) ; the fourth, or diatesseron (3 : 4) ; and the fifth, or diapente (2 : 3). These are the harmonic ratios of the Greek music scale. There is evidence that harmonic ratios were used in Renaissance architecture. This point has occasioned much debate after it was first comprehensively treated by Wittkower ;30 but it is difficult to deny that the Greek music scale was on architects' minds. As far as specific instances, Simonetta Valtieri has recently extended the argument to architectural repre sentations in painting, asserting that the architecture in Raphael's "School of Athens" is based on harmonic ratios.31 In the more general theoretical sense, Alberti's comparaison of architecture to music was echoed by others, among them Francesco di Giorgio : Anco la musica necessaria pare per le conferenzie e proporzioni di ciascuno edif?zio. E cos? come la musica he le sue pause longhe, massime, brevi e simibrevi, che tutte proporzionatamente corri spondano, cos? in ciascuno edif?zio si richiede. E quando in nella musica una desonante nota sia, tutto el canto ? descordante, cos? interviene in ciascuno edif?zio, non avendo le sue conferenti corrispondenzie incomposto e discodante essar el fa.32 27 Luca Pacioli, De divina proportione, Venice, 1509, pt. 1, eh. 23, fol. 27r. 28 An excellent discussion of this point is found in Olschki, op. cit., pp. 152fl. 29 See in particular A. Chastel, Art et Humanisme ? Florence au Temps de Laurent le Magnifique, pp. 96?T. 30 Wittwoker, op. cit., 1949 edition, p. 101-158. 31 S. Valtieri, "La Scuola d'Atene", Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Institutes in Florence, XVI, 1972, p. 63-72. There are a couple of problems with this article. One of the diagrams (p. 67) is mislabeled ; two segments are labeled as having lengths of one and three units, respec tively, but this is mathematically impossible in Valtieri's construction. What she means is that the segments are in the ratio of one to three. Additionally, Valtieri has a questionable section where she sees measurements of eights, five, and four units in "The School of Athens," and asserts that they make one think of the octave, fifth, and fourth (p. 66-67). In order to yield the harmonic ratios, the number sequence should be eight, six, and four. The ratio of four to eight is an octave, four to six a fifth, and six to eight a fourth. 3 2 Francesco di Giorgio, Codice Torinese Saluzziano 148, fol. lOv.

RAGKUSIN 493 In addition to collectively forming the harmonic ratios, each of the smallest factors of seventy-two (one, two, three, and four) has its own numerological significance. The number one represents, quite simply, the Godhead, the One from which all springs. The number two, according to the Pythagoreans, is the first female number ; the product of it and three, the first male number, is six, the number of generation.33 The number three has a host of other symbolic connotations, the most important being that of the Trinity. The symbolism of the number four is involved with the idea of completeness, especially regarding the world and dominion over the four compass points and the four quarters of the globe. Additionally, Alberti wrote that some considered the number four to be dedicated to God, and for this reason solemn oaths were repeated four times.34 Even more important, in a numerological sense, than these small est factors of seventy-two are the larger components six and twelve. As Euclid noted, six is a "perfect" number in mathematics because the sum of its factors (one, two, and three) adds up to the number itself.35 Six is also a perfect number in Christian symbolism because the universe was created in six days?with man, God's most perfect creation, formed on the sixth. This is in accordance with the Pythagoreans' denoting six as the number representing generation. The number twelve and its multiples (for instance, the four-and twenty elders) occur throughout the Bible. Twelve is especially important, representing the cosmos emanating from the One : twelve signs of the zodiac, twelve tribes of Israel, twelve Apostles of Christ, twelve gates of Jerusalem, and so on. Twelve had also acquired cosmic significance from Plato's immensely influential Timaeus. Here, Plato asserted that the dodecahedron signifies the universe. He did not give his reasons for this statement, but several immediately come to mind. The dodecahedron is the most likely regular solid to represent the cosmos, because it most nearly approaches the form of an all-encompassing sphere. Further, the number twelve is related to the zodiacal divisions of the heavens. Moreover, the dodecahedron, is the only regular body that can contain within its faces each of the other four, which Plato likened to earth, air, fire, and water.36 The number seventy-two has a long history of symbolic meanings related to divisions of the world and the cosmos. The ancient 33 Boyer, op. cit., p. 57. 34 Alberti, op. cit., bk. 9, ch. 5. 35Boyer, op. cit., p. 128. 36 Plato, Timaeus, 53C-55C. In Phaedo HOB the planet earth is likened to a dode cahedron. The idea of cosmic divisions corresponding to the zodiac houses is no longer applicable, but otherwise Plato's line of reasoning appears to be the same. The regular polyhedron whose form most closely approaches that of an all-encompassing sphere, is once again viewed as the entity (earth) which contains the four elements (the other four polyhedra).</page><page sequence="18">494 THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI Hebrews, for example, believed that the world was divided among seventy-two nations.37 Later, the tradition arose that Christ's word had been spread across the earth by seventy-two disciples.38 Expla nations for this number of disciples vary. Saint Augustine noted that, if the sun rotates around the earth in twenty-four hours, it takes 3 24 disciples to speak world-wide about the Trinity.39 Bede wrote that it had been necessary to send out seventy-two disciples to account for the seventy-two different languages of the world's nations.40 The universe itself was considered by some to be divided into seventy-two parts. Based on a passage in Matthew XXVI : 53 referring to twelve legions of angels, Pietro Bongo of Bergamo, in his 1599 Numerorum mysteria, asserted that each legion (as in ancient Rome) is comprised of six thousand beings. The seventy-two thou sand angels control the seventy-two divisions of the heavens. These divisions are obtained by dividing each house of the zodiac into six parts.41 Seventy-two had a special added significance for the Franciscan order, of which Pacioli was a member. The Quattrocento Franciscan Marianic movement produced a new rosary, still in use today. Unlike other types of rosaries, the Franciscans' bears seventy-two beads, one for each year they believe Mary to have spent on earth before her Assumption.42 One would suspect that the choice of this par ticular number was tied in with the numerological traditions just mentioned. Pacioli's apparent concern for harmonic ratios and number sym bolism in architecture found a striking echo in the work of Francesco Giorgi, another Franciscan, who has left documentary evidence link ing the theory with actual architectural practice. In the third decade of the Cinquecento, Giorgi, attached to the Church of San Francesco della Vigna in Venice, submitted a plan for rebuilding the structure. The ratios he used in his design were based on numerology. Giorgi stated that the nave width should be 32 units and the length 33 units, because they are divine numbers. He also noted that the ratio of 3s to 32 is the ratio of an octave to a diapente. Giorgi's plan with all its symbolic meanings was approved by the building committee, among whom were Titian and Serlio.43 Obviously Giorgi was working 37 P. Saintyves, Deux Mythes Evang?liques : Les Douze Ap?tres et les 72 Disciples, Paris, 1938, pp. 173 and 250. 38 The number of Christ's disciples is variously given as seventy-two or seventy. The Latin texts seem to prefer the former number, the Greek texts the latter; see Saintyves, op. cit., p. 128-149. 39 Ibid., p. 248 ; Pietro Bongo, Numerorum mysteria, Bergamo, 1599, p. 555. 40 Saintyves, op. cit., p. 248 ; Bongo, op. cit., p. 555. 41 Bongo, op. cit., p. 556. 42 W.

RACKUSIN 495 in the longstanding tradition of turning a church into a cosmic diagram, a tradition reflected also in Pacioli's writings. Theologians had in fact believed for centuries that the universe possessed a mathematical structure. Renaissance artists shared this belief, and in architecture in particular it was felt that proper pro portions and measurements reflected the mathematical harmony of the universe. It has already been noted that the smallest factors of the number seventy-two yield the harmonic ratios of the Greek music scale. This is most significant because these ratios were considered a key to understanding the mysteries of the cosmos. An artist's proper use of measurement and proportion to create forms and spaces (be they two-dimensional or three-dimensional) would reflect the macrocosm, and bring the observer into spiritual communion with it. Hence architects' preoccupation with architectural "music". In a letter of 1477, Marsilio Ficino specifically expresses the relationship between numbers, three-dimensional geometry, and music : ... numbers, figures and reasons for movements concern thought more than the exterior senses ; by studying them, the soul detaches itself not only from corporeal appetite but also from the senses, and is turned toward interior reflection. Such is, in effect, the Platonic order in the perception of these objects : arithmetic leads to geometry, geometry to stereometry, stereometry to astronomy, this last to music.44 Therefore Pacioli's interest in numbers and stereometry reflects contemporary concerns. Uccello, gently rebuked by his friend Donatello for wasting his time constructing "palle a settantadue facce a punte di diamanti" ;45 Piero della Francesca, examining the same polyhedron in his De corporibus regularibus ; 46 and Fra Giovanni da Verona, representing the figure twice in intarsia panels in the monastery of Monte Oliveto and the sacristy of Santa Maria in Organo, Verona?all of these men shared Pacioli's fascination with the seventy two-faced body.47 This concern reflects the common interest of artists, mathematicians, and philosophers in the production of artistic works embodying the harmonies of the universe, through mathematical 44 Marsilio Ficino, Opera Omnia, Basle, 1576, Ep. 4, p. 762.

RACKUSIN organization of space.48 True, we cannot see visible evidence for the use of a seventy-two-faced figure in the buildings that Pacioli cites, nor is it mentioned in Renaissance architectural treatises. But as Wittkower has pointed out, the relation between architectural design and symbol can be tenuous.49 It may be said with confidence that Pacioli's polyhedron, far from representing mere mathematical games manship, reflects general ideas of which architects, Bramante among them, were very much aware. After discussing the seventy-two-faced polyhedron and its relation ship to architecture, Pacioli seems to abruptly change direction. He begins a tirade against architects who either do not know of or do not follow Vitruvius, or both. These architects are contemporary ones ; the friar refers to them in the present tense. By likening them to rustic peasants, tailors, shoemakers, masons, carpenters, ironsmiths, and artisans in general, he adds further insult. During the Quattro cento artists had attempted to elevate their position above the ranks of mere artisans. Pacioli's criticisms have an aura of specificity. They appear to be directed towards a particular individual or group which he need not design to mention, but which his readers will nevertheless recog nize from the description. Adding to the air of specificity are the reference to a building's falling in ruins in three years (this seems traceable) ; and Pacioli's statement that Ludovico, "continuing what has already been started/' "will turn it [Milan] from the abominable and inept impression, removing its authors." This confident asser tion implies a conscious program to rid the city of the influence of certain architects. The clue to the architects' identity (although Pacioli does not tell us precisely who they are) lies in the use of the word "modern". Pacioli opposes the "true antique norm" to the greatly inferior "modern" style. This indicates that "modern" probably meant "Gothic" to him. Supporting evidence for this interpretation is found in the writings of Filarete, who had leveled similar criticism some years before. In one of the dialogues in his Trattato di archi tettura, Filarete is asked to comment on such "modern" buildings as Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence. He is quite critical of this type of structure : 48 Leonardo da Vinci, as illustrator of the Divina proportione, was naturally con cerned with the seventy-two-faced figure. Studies for these illustrations are scattered throughout the Codex Atlanticus ; but with the possible exception of a very faint sketch on folio 87v, the polyhedron does not appear. In any case, Leonardo was not interested in stereometry for its mystic connotation. The attraction of mathematics for him lay in its use as a tool allowing clear rational organization of space. 49 Wittwoker, op. cit., 3rd ed., p. 30-31.</page><page sequence="21">THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI 497 Ma lasciamo stare al presente dire di queste chiese moderne loro mancamenti, i quali sono procceduti quasi da una oppinione universale di chi fa fare alcuna cosa che appartenga a questo esercizio d'edificare, e a ognuno gli pare essere buono architetto. E per questo ? pi? maestri di questa arte che di niuna altra, ma meno se ne truova buoni che dell'altre... Acci? che si possino avedersi degli errori e anche da loro guardarsi, leggendo questo vedranno li falli che com mettono e fanno commettere a chi di loro si fida. Aviene questo, come ho detto, perch? none intendono n? misure, n? proporzioni delle cose che s'apartengono allo edificare.50 Of course, by inveighing against incompetent architects, both Pacioli and Filarete were following Vitruvius : ... this grand art is boldly professed by the uneducated and the unskilful, and by men who, far from being acquainted with architec ture, have no knowledge even of the carpenter's trade_Nobody, therefore, attempts to practise any other art in his own home?as, for instance, the shoemaker's, or the fuller's, or any other of the easier kind?but only architecture, and this is because the pro fessionals do not possess the genuine art but term themselves archi tects falsely.51 If Pacioli's use of the term "modern" is in fact taken to mean "Gothic," then Ludovico could indeed have been seen as the sponsor of a new architecture breaking with the "Lombard Gothic" tradition. Bramante's Santa Maria presso San Satiro looks back to Albertian inspiration. Santa Maria delle Grazie illustrates increasing late Quattrocento interest in central plans and in the interplay of organ ically unified volumes.52 This interest was becoming particularly prominent in Milan, due to the fruitful exchange of ideas among Bramante, Leonardo, Francesco di Giorgio, and Giuliano da Sangallo, all of whom were involved with the Milan Cathedral tiburio project. In the first few lines of his written assault against the "modern" architects, Pacioli complains that they "apply the art even though they do not know it," just as tailors and shoemakers "apply geometry and do not know what it is," and other craftsmen "employ measure ment and proportion without knowing what they are." Since all indications point to a meaning of "Gothic" for "modern", Pacioli apparently believed that architects working in the Gothic style did not understand the theoretical principles behind their practical appli cation of geometry. He makes the same point again a little later : 50 Filarete, op. cit., bk. 1, fol. 2r, v. I have drawn the modem Italian rendering from Filarete, Trattato di Architettura, eds. R. Bonelli and P. Portoghesi, Milan, 1972, pp. 12f. 51 Vitruvius, op. cit., bk. 6, Introduction ; English translation from Vitruvius, The Ten Books on Architecture, trans. M. H. Morgan, p. 169. 52 For a discussion of the development and significance of the central plan, see Chastel, Art et Humanisme ? Florence au Temps de Laurent le Magnifique, pp. 139ff.</page><page sequence="22">498 . RAGKUSIN "... there are architects of renown who do not know the difference which exists between the point and the line or the differences of the angles, without which [knowledge] it is not possible to build well." What especially seems to disturb the friar is their supposed failure to comprehend the importance of right angles. After noting that architects must know these differences between a point and a line and between the angles, Pacioli states that : This is demonstrated by, as our aforementioned Vitruvius says, the utmost jubilation and great merriment which Pythagoras had when with sure science he hit upon the true proportion of the two straight lines which contain the right angle of the square, for which discovery he immolated once hundred oxen.... The mention of Pythagoras with his "true proportion of the two straight lines which contain the right angle of the square" refers to the Pythagorean theorem. The portion of De architecture! cited by Pacioli illustrates a way to form right triangles without complicated instruments. In any right triangle, a2 + b2 = c2, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. Con versely, if a triangle is constructed such that the lengths of its sides are described by this formula, then the figure is a right triangle. According to Vitruvius, Pythagoras once constructed a right angle by forming a triangle with sides of lengths described by the formula : Then again, Pythagoras showed that a right angle can be formed Without the contrivances of the artisans. Thus the result which carpenters reach very laboriously, but scarcely to exactness, with their squares, can be demonstrated to perfection from the reasoning and methods of his teaching. If we take three rules, one three feet, the second four feet, and the third five feet in length, and join these rules together with their tips touching each other so as to make a triangular figure, they will form a right angle. Now if a square be described on the length of each one of these rules, the square on the side of three feet in length will have an area of nine feet ; of four feet, sixteen ; of five, twenty-five. Thus the area in number of feet made up of the two squares on the sides three and four feet in length is equally by that of the one square described on the side of five. When Pythagoras discovered this fact, he had no doubt that the Muses had guided him in the discovery, and it is said that he very gratefully offered sacrifice to them.53 Following the citation of the Pythagorean theorem and its con nection with right angles, Pacioli explains why the right angle is so important : "... without knowledge of it it is not possible to distin guish the good from the bad in any of our works, and without it one 53 Vitruvius, op. cit., bk. 9, introduction ; English translation from Vitruvius, The Ten Books on Architecture, trans. M. H. Morgan, p. 252-253.</page><page sequence="23">THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI 499 could not in any way obtain any sure measurement.'' Since those "modern" architects supposedly did not know the differences between various types of angles, the implication is clear : they could not tell the bad from the good in architectural practice, and furthermore their measurements were inexact. In short, Pacioli not only accuses the erring "modern" architects of ignoring Vitruvius ; he also claims that they do not know the principles behind the geometry that they use. He further emphasizes his criticisms in succeeding lines : From here to the modern shoemakers with their edifices?it seems to them that they accomplish nothing if, parting from the right and obligatory antique norm, they do not introduce some nuisance of their foolishness, censuring those (there are some who can still be found) who are returning to the true antique norm. And they are those who enjoy our mathematical disciplines, searching for the true guide of all edifices in the works of the aforementioned Vitruvius. In separating from him one can see how our edifices are, divine and profane : that which is awry is doubly so. It is important to note that Pacioli does not claim that Gothic architects used no geometry.54 Instead, he asserts that they employed geometry, measurement, and proportion without knowing what they are, and that they did not enjoy "our mathematical disciplines, searching for the true guide of all edifices in the works of the afore mentioned Vitruvius". The phrase "our mathematical disciplines" is the key to understanding Pacioli's tirade, his insistence on following Vitruvius, and the reason for linking this discussion with his thoughts on the seventy-two-faced polyhedron. Pacioli's writings make it abundantly clear what "our mathe matical disciplines" involved : Pythagoreo-Platonic speculations by artists in order to have their works reflect the universe's mathe matical structure. Vitruvius also linked architecture to nature's mathematical harmonies by likening buildings to a well-proportioned human body. He consistently emphasized the importance of archi tectural modules yielding a "symmetry" among the parts and be tween the parts and the whole. In his chapter "The Fundamental Principles of Architecture," he compared this harmony to that of the human body : "Thus in the human body there is a kind of symmetrical harmony between forearm, foot, palm, finger, and other small parts ; and so it is with perfect buildings." 55 The comparison is made again in relation to temples : 54 A staggering number of books and articles have been written concerning the use of geometry in medieval architecture. Wittkower's 1962 edition of Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism offers a bibliography citing the classic works in the field. 55 Vitruvius, op. cit., bk. 1, ch. 2; English translation from Vitruvius, The Ten Books on Architecture, trans. M. H. Morgan, p. 14.</page><page sequence="24">500 . RACKUSIN The design of a temple depends on symmetry, the principles of which must be most carefully observed by the architect. They are due to proportion.... Proportion is a correspondence among the measures of the members of an entire work, and of the whole to a certain part selected as standard. From this result the principles of symmetry. Without symmetry and proportion there can be no prin ciples in the design of any temple ; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members, as in the case of those of a well shaped man. This observation leads Vitruvius into a discussion of the most perfect forms, the square and the circle, and their relationship to man ("Vitruvian Man"). He returns to the relationship between the human body and architectural proportions, noting that "it was from the members of the body that they [the ancients] derived the funda mental ideas of the measurements which are obviously necessary in all works, as the finger, palm, foot, and cubit. These they appor tioned so as to form the 'perfect number' ...56 The very pro portions of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns are based on the well-proportioned human body : Doric analogous to a male, Ionic to a female, and Corinthian to a young maiden.67 This linking of harmonious architectural measurements to the human body was exceedingly attractive to Renaissance architects, who were raised in the Christian tradition of viewing man, the microcosm, as a reflection of the perfection of the macrocosm. Once again the idea of architecture embodying cosmic mathematical har monies and perfect geometric figures comes into play. Pacioli him self summarizes these ideas in his 1509 treatise on architecture, appended to the Divina proportione upon publication. In the intro ductory epistle he writes, ... prima diremo della humana proportione respecto al suo corpo e membri pero che dal corpo humano ogni mesura con sue denominationi deriua e in epso tutti sorti de proportioni e propor tionalita se ritroua con lo deto de altissimo mediante li intrinseci secreti de la natura. E per questo tutte nostre mesure e instrumenti a dimensioni deputati per li publici e priuate comme le dicto sonno denominate dal corpo humano... E cosi comme dici el nostro V[itru vius] a sua similitudine dobiam proportionare ogni hedificio con tutto el corpo ben a suoi membri proportionato. E per questo prima diremo de epsa mesura humana con suoi proportioni a suoi membri secondo la quale ve arete aregere in vostre opere lapicide maxime de frontespicii e altre degne fac?ate de templi porti e palazzi quali sempre se costumo adornarli de colonne cornici e architraui comme apieno ne dici el nostro V[itruvius].58 56 Vitruvius, op. cit., bk. 3, ch. 1 ; English translation from Vitruvius, The Ten Books on Architecture, trans. M. H. Morgan, p. 72-73. 57 Vitruvius, op. cit., bk. 4, ch. 1. 58 Luca Pacioli, De divina proportione, pt. 1, fol. 24v-25r.</page><page sequence="25">THE ARCHITECTURAL THEORY OF LUCA PACIOLI 501 Pacioli continues this line of thought in the first chapter of his little architectural treatise, and adds the element of the circle and the square, perfect geometric forms : ... li antichi considerata la debita dispositione del corpo humano tutte le loro opere maxime li templi sacri ala sua proportione le disponiuano. Pero che in quello trouauano le doi principalissime figure senza le quali non e possibile alcuna cosa operare cio? la circu lar perfectissima e di tute l'altre isoperometrarum capacissima come dici Dionisio in quel De spheris. L'altra la quadrata equilatera.59 It is no wonder, then, that Pacioli and other architectural theo reticians emphasized the importance of the circle and the square, and displayed such admiration and even reverence for the Pantheon. The Pantheon, the most outstanding example of antique circular ground plans, was infused with explicit cosmic connotations from the start. Based on a circle?the figure with no beginning and no end?this temple to all the gods seemed to represent the rotating heavens themselves, with the light from the oculus revolving around the interior according to the time of day. It was viewed anthropo morphically as well, as Serlio demonstrated in his aforementioned comparison of the oculus to a "capo," or head. Gothic architects were of course familiar with the concept of man, microcosm, as a reflection of the macrocosm. But even though the cruciform church represented the crucified body of Christ, there was no real interest in a Vitruvian anthropomorphic conception of a church constructed with modular units, analogous to the harmonious proportions of a well-formed human body. Therefore, to Pacioli it seemed that Gothic architects did not know what geometry was, i.e. a tool to cause buildings to reflect the mathematical structure of the universe. Consequently these architects were ignorant fools who could not build well. Pacioli's discourse on "modern" architecture and on geometry is thus not at all an abrupt change of direction from his discussion of the seventy-two-faced polyhedron. Chapter fifty-four of the Divina proportione appears to be a unified entity treating Renaissance artistic preoccupations with cosmic mathematical harmonies. The chapter is an important document of later Quattrocento thought. Pacioli's mathematical aesthetic, so to speak, did not allow him to enjoy Gothic architecture. Still, he does not seem to have entirely disliked Gothic works. Within his tirade he mentions models of "modern" buildings which he find somewhat pleasing due to their small size. 59 Ibid., fol. 25r.</page><page sequence="26">502 . RAGKUSIN Pacioli concludes his chapter with a round of compliments. His Highness Ludovico will rescue Milan, ridding it of all the wrongs and removing the influence of the abominable modern architects. This will occur because the Duke "understands more of such things, asleep, than those wide awake with one thousand eyes". The same is true of Ludovico's relative, the Duke of Urbino (Guidobaldo). It is appropriate that Pacioli mention the Urbino palace after his condemnation of Gothic architects. The palace was begun under Guidobaldo's humanist father, Federigo da Mont efeltro. The list of artists and outstanding intellects who visited his court includes Leon Battista Alberti, Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, Francesco di Giorgio, and Donato Bramante. These were figures at the forefront of developments in architecture, both in actual structures and in buildings represented two-dimensionally in painting and relief sculp ture. In fact, Bramante's first architectural work appears to have been the palace's tiny Cappella del Perdono.60 With this note about the Urbino palace, Pacioli ends the chapter.
