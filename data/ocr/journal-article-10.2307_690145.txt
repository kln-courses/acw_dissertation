<plain_text><page sequence="1">Socialness and the Undersocialized Conception of Society H. M. Collins Cardiff University Socialness as a Force of Nature Since we are in Tucson, let me start with a quotation from Cormac McCarthy's The Border Trilogy, which is set not far east of here. This comes from the second volume: The Crossing. An old man is talking to Billy about his horse: I remember that horse, the old man said. That was your daddy's horse. Yessir. He bought it off a Mexican. He claimed the horse when he bought it didn't know a word of English. (McCarthy 1994, 353) Human individuals experience the physical world quite differently de- pending on the social groups in which they have been brought up. These different collective experiences are embodied in natural languages. But human experiences relate to social groups in ways in which horses' experi- ences do not. That is why there is something odd about the idea of a Mexican-raised horse which "does not know a word of English." Horses, or AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is a modified version of the paper presented at Annual Meeting of Society for Social Studies of Science, Tucson, October 1997, on the occasion of the presentation of the J. D. Bernal award to the author. I would like to than Karin Knorr-Cetina, the president of our society, for her kind introduction at the award ceremony. I have tried to keep this paper in the form of an "address" while making extensive changes to the text that was read out. Too many people to name have discussed aspects of the paper with me since its first presentation, and I have benefited from every remark. I thank them all; they will find their influence throughout the text. I must, however, mention Mick Bloor, Ingemar Bohlin, Ralph Fevre, and Diedericke Raven who sent me lengthy written comments for which I am extremely grateful. Olga Amsterdamska's editing led to very important and substantial corrections and improvements to the early sections of the paper. But I am still the person to blame. Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, Vol. 23 No. 4, Autumn 1998 494-516 ? 1998 Sage Publications Inc. 494</page><page sequence="2">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 495 for that matter domestic animals such as dogs and cats, whose upbringing has a huge overlap with the upbringing of human children, and whose social experience is as varied as that of their human masters and mistresses, just are not expected to have the equivalent degree of differentiation in the way they know the world and act within it. I believe that the stuff of sociology is the exploration of the consequences of whatever it is that allows there to be the kind of variation between groups of human beings that is not found between groups of horses, cats, and dogs. Whatever it is, it not only creates the rich and fascinating variations between groups of human beings, it also provides the conditions for certain kinds of competence within groups of human beings. I think sociologists needs to treat this "whatever it is" as a basic feature of their science-a primitive natural element; it should serve the same function within sociology as gravity or electromagnetism serves in physics. Chalmers (1996) suggests that consciousness is a fundamental force that will have to be included with the other forces if scientists are ever to fulfill their "Dreams of a Final Theory," and I admire his approach. I do not know whether he is right, but I believe that what he claims about consciousness is certainly true of the "whatever it is" we are discussing. What is the right term to describe the "whatever it is"? We need a term that enables us to state the sociological equivalent of "computers will never be like humans until they attain consciousness," or "the crucial question for psychology is understanding consciousness," or "these are the consequences of consciousness for human action," or "How can one tell the difference between an entity that has consciousness and one that does not?" We do talk about "tacit knowledge" or "collective consciousness" or some such, but these terms are either loaded with unwanted extraneous meanings or borrow from a universe of discourse which is subtly different, or both. We talk about "entities that can follow rules within a form of life," and that is an accurate description of the "whatever it is," but it is a bit of a mouthful. Martin Kusch and I, in our newly completed book, talk about "entities that can carry out polimorphic actions," but although this phrase captures an essential property of what we want to say, it also is too long-winded. Gerard de Vries, Wiebe Bijker, and I have written about "social capabilities," and this too is close to what we mean, but it is not sufficiently "thinglike." Kusch has written about "entities that can acquire social dispositions," and I, to my shame, have even used the word "socializability" to describe this potential, but that term is surely too ugly to be what we are looking for. "Sociability" is a term introduced by Simmel. He says: "the 'sociability drive' extracts the pure process of sociation as a cherished value," and "As a</page><page sequence="3">496 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values sociological category I designate sociability as the play-form of sociation" (quoted in Wolffe 1950, 44-45). Sociability is also used in W. G. Runciman's (1998) latest book. The trouble with "sociability" is that both in its Simmelian and its popular use, it is too much like what goes on in the pub; you might have more or less of it depending on how agreeable a person you are or how much you have had to drink. The term we are looking for is much more universal than this. "Sociality," a word introduced, or at least closely associated with, G. H. Mead, is the strongest existing candidate for the term we need. Further- more, Mead seemed to want to demarcate humans from animals in the way we do: Mead commented in a footnote that "the rate of development or evolution of human society, since the emergence of minds and selves out of the human social process of experience and behavior, has been tremendously accelerated as a result of that emergence" (Mead 1934, 227). He also warned of the danger of anthropomorphism when discussing ants and bees: "The principle of organization in these communities is a different one from that found in the human community" (p. 230). And he argued that "in man the functional differentiation through language gives a different principle of organization which produces not only a different type of individual but a different society" (p. 244). The trouble is that another reading of Mead is available. It damages the term sociality and encourages us to think of humankind as one end of a continuum with other creatures. For example, he says: All living organisms are bound up in a general social environment or situation, in a complex of social interrelations and interactions upon which their contin- ued existence depends. (P. 228) This kind of statement encourages analysts not to distinguish in a funda- mental way between the "social" nature of ants and bees and the social nature of humans. Whether it was Mead's intention or not, ants, bees, and even networks of computers are now so frequently described as "social" that the term has come to mean only "interacting in a network of like entities" or "organized through exchanges of information." These usages have nothing to do with forms-of-life, social rule following, polimorphic actions, or sociology. The term "sociality" is not anthropocentric enough because it is associated with this more general use of "social." Thus, while the idea of "sociality" allows us to say that humans are special, it becomes a matter of degree rather than kind. Sociality is also the wrong part of speech. It seems, at least to some analysts, to refer to the quality of the interactions within social structures.</page><page sequence="4">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 497 One might talk, then, of different groups of humans, and different kinds of entities, having different socialities, rather than the individuals of a species having sociality or not having it. For these reasons I am going to introduce a new term which has the same place in the language as "consciousness." The term is socialness. Socialness is defined as follows: "Socialness is the capacity to attain social fluency in one or more cultures." If one has social fluency, one has social capabilities and one can follow rules in the Wittgensteinian sense. Which is to say that socialness, once cashed out into social fluency, enables one to carry out polimorphic actions. Sociologists explore this idea on three levels. At the most general level, sociologists think about the nature of socialness and the nature of social fluency; this is close to being a philosophical enterprise. At the second level, sociologists think about the salience and consequences of socialness. I think this level has enormous potential but has been too little pursued. At the least general level, sociologists do sociology by comparing different cultures. Defined thus, sociology is very much like anthropology but it is more ready to consider the historical, institutional, and political sources and settings of cultures and the mechanisms of change. The two upper levels--discussing the nature of socialness and looking at its salience and consequences-are what I am going to call "metasociology." The top level is philosophical metasociology; here, concerns of metasociology and meta-anthropology coincide. What I am particularly eager to encourage, however, is the middle level-metasociology as an empirical and applicable discipline. We might call this "applied metasociology" if it is not too oxymoronic. Applied meta- sociology examines what entities who possess socialness can do and what entities without socialness cannot do. If socialness looked at this way is the social equivalent of the soul, one might say that what we are pursuing is "applied soul." There is an exact parallel with the analysis of natural language. At the most general level, we think about the nature of language; at the middle level, we look at the salience of language and the consequences of having language; at the least general level, we study and compare different natural languages. Socialness and the Higher Animals Socialness is something that belongs to a species. A species either pos- sesses socialness or it does not. That is not to say that people agree about whether certain species have socialness or not, or even whether it is always</page><page sequence="5">498 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values clear whether a species has socialness or not; these questions are the topic of debates within metasociology. The most obvious debating ground concerns the higher animals. I have heard people argue that horses, cats, and dogs have socialness. I think they do not. I have already pointed to the oddness of the idea of a Mexican horse. Likewise with dogs: a dog brought up in Paris seems to experience the world in roughly the same way as a dog brought up in London.' (Note that domestic dogs are brought up by humans, not other dogs.) Give an English dog a lump of pate de foie gras and it is only plausible to assume its experience of gobbling it down will be the same as that of a French dog. I do not expect I will ever meet a dog that is vegetarian on principle, and I am fairly sure that neither French nor English dogs are going to have their experience of pate affected by thoughts about whether it's good to stuff geese to bursting point in search of a dubious delicacy. But these are dimensions along which groups of humans differ radically from one another. As for competence, consider again that dogs and cats are brought up in human families, have brains of a complexity well beyond the dreams of the most ambitious builder of neural nets, are capable of navigating their way around a complex world with a certainty and refinement which has not been attained by robots, yet they cannot be trained to tidy a room. The dog does not understand the difference between clean and dirty, precious and valueless, misplaced and correctly placed, and so forth. And these categorizations vary from place to place and time to time even within human cultures and subcultures. So, we can imagine we could train a dog to tell the difference between today's fresh newspaper and yesterday's old one (with its patina of domestic smells), and dispose of them accordingly, but how could it be told not to throw away the one with the picture of Princess Di? What the dog lacks is fluency in the relevant social language. I think it lacks this fluency because it lacks the potential to gain it-it lacks socialness. Those who build robots think that the ability to tidy a room is just a small step from the ability to negotiate a room, but once you have the idea of socialness, you see it as a huge step. There are people who say that dogs, horses, and cats do have socialness but they just happen to be incapable of learning our social languages; their fluency is exhibited within the social lives they live out in their own groups. I think this claim is wrong because of the vast difference in capability of, say, dogs and humans and, as I have mentioned, the huge differences in variability within the species (what one might call a "second order" difference). I also think the claim that other creatures have their own, impenetrable cultures, is unsupportable.</page><page sequence="6">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 499 The claim is unsupportable because one cannot know whether something has socialness until one sees it demonstrate social fluency, and one cannot recognize social fluency unless it is exhibited in a social language in which one is fluent oneself. Again a useful parallel is natural language. To know whether an entity has the potential for fluency in a language (which following the usages "consciousness" and "socialness" we would have to call some- thing like "linguisticness"), we need to see that fluency exercised in a language in which we are fluent. Thus, not speaking Chinese I have no way of knowing whether another person, or thing, purporting to speak Chinese, is fluent or whether he, she, or it is producing a pastiche of Chinese sounds, words, or even sentences. These may even be grammatically correct yet lack real fluency.2 For that reason, I remain agnostic in the case of chimpanzees and dolphins where an effort is being made to teach them to communicate using our languages or to translate their, what might turn out to be languages, into ours. Bear in mind that we are talking about fluency, not the exchange of signs. If the exchange of signs were all there were to it, then bees, ants, and computers have languages just as much as we do. But, let it be that I am wrong about horses, cats, and dogs. There must still be some creatures that don't have socialness, and it must be that no current machines have socialness (Collins 1990). Somewhere there must be differ- ence between entities that have socialness and those that do not. The existence of a difference between two types of entities does not mean that a sharp dividing line can be found between them. Where the boundary between one type of thing and another is to be found, or set, may be unclear, or may be the subject of dispute, but this does not prove there are no differences. Sociologists often seem to argue as though establishing that a boundary between two kinds of things is disputable or confounded were a sufficient proof that there is only one kind of thing after all. This is fallacious. It may be unclear where the muddy boundary lies between a field and a pond-the boundary might even be the subject of a property dispute-but one may still drown in a pond and not in a field. I believe that the dividing line between entities with socialness and those without is pretty close to the dividing line between humans and nonhumans, but I don't care enormously if others want to say it includes chimpanzees and dolphins. If they want to say it includes dogs, cats, and horses, I will argue strongly. But I only care enormously if it is said that no such line exists or that it encompasses ants, bees, and machines, for that is effectively to deny the existence of a line and the existence of the concept of socialness. And it is the existence of socialness that makes sociology a distinct science.</page><page sequence="7">500 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Distribution of Socialness within Humans Species either have socialness or they do not, but socialness may be differentially distributed among the individual members of a species. It seems that most humans are born with enough socialness to develop a social fluency without conscious effort. Humans with socialness develop social fluency as they are socialized. Some humans, however, seem to be born with less than the normal share of socialness; we can recognize this because they have difficulty developing social fluency. Autistic persons may, perhaps, be best described as humans with less than the typical quota of socialness. Autism: Humans Born Without Socialness Show That Socialness Is Necessary for Social Fluency The inability of autistic persons to form normal social relationships is well documented. Frith (1989, 2) points out a corrolary-without socialness there is less variation in behavior than normal: "Many people have expressed their astonishment at how recognizably similar autistic children are, even if they come from different countries and communities." Autistic children, then, seem unable to develop the degree of variation which, at the outset of the paper, I suggested was typical of the possession of socialness. Autistic children, Frith goes on to say (p. 11), seem to relate happily to objects other than humans and they seem to be characterized by "repetitive- ness, rigidity, singlemindedness, pedantry, and inability to judge the signifi- cance of subtle differences." Furthermore, "It has been recognized that there can be profound impairment in the ability to engage in meaningful commu- nication despite adequate speech" (p. 12). There are philosophical niceties required for the interpretation of these claims because of the ambiguity of terms such as "repetitiveness," "rigidity," "adequate speech," and so on. To recognize repetitiveness, we need to know what is meant by "the same," and this is not a transparent concept. Neverthe- less, taking Frith to be using the terms in their ordinary usage, we can assume that similarity here means "natural similarity." We talk of a clock as remaining the same even after its hands have moved, whereas the utterances "hello" and "hi" will only be classed as the same "greeting" within the group of people with the appropriate social and linguistic fluency (Collins 1990). My guess is that autistic children prefer things to be the same in ways that imply stability in nature, and, as a consequence, I would guess that what "adequate speech" means in their case includes a tendency to use similar sets of phonemes for their greetings and so forth. I would also guess that those who are profoundly autistic would, just as computers, have difficulty understanding ordinary</page><page sequence="8">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 501 speech with its normal range of variations. Thus, Wootton (1997, 93) remarks of autistic children that they demonstrate the difficulties that are incurred by having a mind which is principally structured in terms of scripts. Their mind is script-like in that these children have as their main preoccupation the reproduction of familiar routines, often of a non-verbal nature and often ones they like to carry out on their own.... Indeed, even where these children can speak, their spontaneous talk often consists in large part of what is known as "delayed echolalia," which means repetition out loud of phrases which they have heard in the past .... Such phrases are also often used in a recurrent, stereotypical way.... This ... only permits these children access to a relatively crude form of interactional involvement. The paradigm of what we might look for in all these cases is found in an incident described by Hendriks (1998 [this issue]). He discusses an autistic child who could not be dissuaded by any amount of scolding from eating endless slices of bread and butter at tea-time. The problem, one might hypothesize, was that simply to understand the meaning of the scolding required the interpretation of an immensely complex body of sounds; each time we scold someone, we do it using a different set of phonemes, amplitude and pitch distributions, facial expressions, and body positions, which take great social fluency to see as "the same." Without seeing them as the same, the child will not know that something is being consistently and repeatedly demanded. The solution that worked in the case of this child was to replace the human with a mechanical alarm that rang to signal the end of eating. We might hypothesize that once the proper response had been established, the child needed less social and linguistic fluency to interpret the bell than to interpret a scolding; stimulus-response had replaced interpretation. Autism has been shown to involve inability to take the role of the other, and has also been described in terms of "mindblindness"-an inability to read others' minds (Baron-Cohen 1995). Psychologists treat these characteristics as the explanation of autism, but in my account it is the other way around. The inability to take the role of the other and, apparently, to see into other minds is a consequence of a lack of socialness; one who has social fluency can anticipate what others will make of attempts to follow rules in new settings, and this is equivalent to seeing into the other person's world. Thus, the ability to take the role of the other might well be described as an outcome of successful socialization rather than an explanation of what socialization is. Phenomenologically, the idea of "the primacy of socialization" version has much going for it, because in normal social interaction we are not continually looking into others' minds, we are following social rules as a</page><page sequence="9">502 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values matter of course without the sort of conscious analysis that is required in the psychological tests that autistic children fail. Feral Children: Socialness Is a Necessary but Not a Sufficient Condition for Social Fluency Autistic persons, I have suggested, are born without socialness, or at least without their full complement of socialness. But even those born with socialness do not necessarily develop social fluency. Feral children, such as Kaspar Hauser and "The Wild Boy of Aveyron" seem to fit this category. Frith (1989) devotes a chapter of her book to the parallels between autistic and wild children. It seems likely that both language and social fluency must be developed by a certain age in the human if they are to develop at all. If there is no opportunity to develop a single social fluency by the time the age of six years or so has passed, then no social fluency will develop. Socialness will have been suppressed, and no additional social fluencies can be developed later. The content of a social fluency is the property of a society, not the brain, and only immersion in a society can develop it. Frontal Lobe Damage: Socialness Destroyed Socialness may be absent, as in the case of autism, or unrealized, as in the case of wild children, but, perhaps, it can also be destroyed in those who have reached adulthood with a developed social fluency. Damasio (1994, 57-58) provides intriguing descriptions of people with damage to their frontal lobes: His behavior was stereotyped, unimaginative, lacking in initiative, and he developed no professional skills or hobbies. Reward or punishment did not seem to influence his behavior. His memory was capricious; it failed in instances in which one would expect learning to occur, and suddenly might succeed in some peripheral subject, e.g., a detailed knowledge of the makes of automobiles. Rigid and persevering in their approach to life ... they ... lacked original- ity and creativity... they displayed generally correct but stereotyped manners. Not being guided by the idea of socialness, Damasio's descriptions remain intriguing but unsatisfying from our point of view. The above extracts are selected from a much larger text describing what we might call "antisocial" behavior, which Damasio treats as the primary phenomenon. The patients7 ethical and social behavior was damaged, so they could not act properly in their families or hold jobs, but Damasio sees this as a result of emotional</page><page sequence="10">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 503 damage. We would want to ask if it could be a consequence of a loss, or partial loss, of social fluency. Lack of socialness does not lead to "antisocialness." To be antisocial in the common sense requires enough social fluency to see the difference between social and antisocial behavior but not to realize their relative value. That is quite different to not knowing how to act socially. We need to know whether frontal lobe damage produces psychopaths, whose behavior cannot be predicted from an understanding of the moral environ- ment, or the equivalent of autistic persons. Autistic persons' behavior is not inconsistently antisocial but consistently asocial. Thus, in the first extract above the patient fails to respond to reward or punishment, but the question would be whether what counted as a reward or as a punishment was still being understood. The socialness hypothesis would lead one to investigate whether there were cases where a different kind of reward and punishment-equivalent to the mechanical alarm described above-might still work. It is suggestive that some of these patients were able to perform quite well in written tests of ethical judgments, where the correct responses could be treated as a formal exercise. (One is reminded of the early claims that medical diagnostic systems could beat doctors at their jobs, while closer examination showed that it was ability to manipulate formalized "fault trees" that was being compared.) Thus, while the typical psychologist's question concerns damage to the individual's emotional centers or even what Damasio calls a loss of ability to make "rational" decisions and judgments, the paradigm offered here would lead to questions about ability to understand and anticipate the social world. What might look like emotional breakdown or "irrationality" might be an inability to grasp the moment-to-moment context for one's own and others' actions. Far from being irrational, these people might be "too rational"; that is, more computer-like than human-like. I do not know whether Damasio is right or wrong, but I do want to show that metasociology has clear and testable consequences. Socialness, Sociology, and Genetic Inheritance Socialness, then, is something we are born with. But this is no threat to sociology. Sociologists have an aversion to genetic explanations, and this is easy to understand given the imperialistic gesturing of sociobiology. But the idea of a species-specific socialness, the existence of which might well be explained in evolutionary terms, is no more a threat to sociology than is the idea that humans' ability to speak natural languages is a product of our evolution. Sociology, or anthropology, can learn little from studies of what</page><page sequence="11">504 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values is common to cultures or languages as a consequence of our genetic inheri- tance. There is almost nothing of value that can be learned from studies of the brain. The only thing that sociologists can learn from the idea of socialness is that they should not treat animals and machines as members of social collectivities and that they should not confuse information exchange with language. It is metasociology that needs the idea of socialness. This is quite easy to see if, once more, we take natural languages as an analogy. Let us suppose that Chomsky is right and that there is a deep structure to all languages, and let us suppose that our brains are inscribed with this deep structure as a consequence of our evolutionary inheritance. Knowing this does not help one to learn a new language, to explain the vocabulary or usages of different languages, or to write programs that will enable computers to understand languages in use. It may be that the deep structure proscribes certain forms of language and that there is an equivalent deep structure within socialness that proscribes certain forms of life, but these things are so abstract that they bear not at all on the day-to-day business of language or social life. All the interest is in the variations not the similarities. And this, not its evolutionary leanings, is the crucial failing of sociobiology. After all, even if it is the case that altruistic behavior is found throughout human and animal species, what we really want to know is answers to questions such as why was so little of it directed from the Third Reich toward Jews and Gypsies? I have used natural language as an analogue of social fluency, but actually the relationship is more one of interdependence than analogy. To understand a language as it is spoken, one must understand the context within which it is spoken, and this requires social fluency; thus linguistic ability is parasitic on socialness, which is why computers do not have it (Collins 1990). Of course, social fluency is almost certainly parasitic on linguistic ability as well. Though a genetic basis for socialness need not worry sociologists per se, it does give rise to a truly terrifying scenario. Suppose there were such a thing as a socialness gene, and suppose we could isolate it, locate it, and transplant it to our cats and dogs. As they grew up with us, they would learn barky and meowy versions of our languages, and all the nuanced social sensitivities that go with them.3 What then would be our relationship with our pets? The sheer moral terror of this scenario, as compared with, say, cross-species transplants of hearts or other organs, immediately tells us something about how different things are now in spite of our anthropomorphic tendencies with respect to animals. Let me sum up the concepts I have introduced. Socialness is a property of species located in most but not all individuals of a species. Social fluency is something that an individual may develop provided he or she has socialness,</page><page sequence="12">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 505 but having socialness is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for developing social fluency. The content of a social fluency-a culture-is located in a society and varies from society to society and from time to time. Thus, no individual can be said to be the location of a culture, merely a participant in it. Nothing much about cultures can be learned from biological evolution or the brain even though the ability to acquire a culture is in the genes: these two things should not be confused; they often are. What is common to cultures is of very little interest to sociology though it is of interest to metasociology. Nevertheless, the idea of socialness is vital to sociology for two reasons: it separates human society from other kinds of social structure; it gives rise to the "second order" quality of human societies-their cultural variability. It is cultural variability that makes sociology possible and interesting. An Instant and Tendentious History of Early Sociology of Scientific Knowledge in Terms of Socialness The early history of the sociology of scientific knowledge is easily understood in terms of exploring the domain of socialness. Rule-following in science turned out to be like rule-following in more obviously social institutions such as finance. The excitement of the early work was in showing that self-referential institutions such as money were not so different from institutions such as neutrinos, or mountains, or the effect of diet on the propensity for heart attacks, which the actors take to have an external reference. In those early days, rapid progress in showing the salience of socialness could be best made by adopting the strategy of the hard case. Physics seemed the best science to examine in detail because it was the most mature and had best claim to a universality and lack of social differentiation based on its apparent reference only to things outside society. Mathematics too seemed so unsocial as to provide a special case. Perhaps because mathematics was so difficult, it has taken longer to generate a large body of case studies, but the work is continuing most promisingly.4 Once it was made clear that science depended on social fluency, it could be studied like any other area of sociology, and the main stuff of sociology of scientific knowledge remains the relating of different social fluencies to the content of science. In the early days, the Strong Programme was strong on philosophical metasociology and strong on sociology. The first two stages of the Empirical Program of Relativism (EPOR) are metasociology of a more</page><page sequence="13">506 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values empirical bent than found in the Strong Programme. The third stage of EPOR is sociology.5 Computers are a superb test case for the idea of socialness for two reasons. First, they do not come with socialness built in because no one has the slightest idea how to build it in. Second, computers are not programmed by being socialized in the way that humans are socialized and cats and dogs would be if they possessed socialness. If computers can attain social fluency in spite of their lack of deliberately programmed socialness, and in spite of their totally inappropriate upbringing, something is wrong. But nothing is wrong; computers cannot attain social fluency, as a number of studies and analyses have shown, and it now seems bizarre, at least to a few people, ever to have imagined that they could.6 The solution to the problem of artificial intelligence cannot be a matter of improved hardware, or ingenious program- ming, or structures based on organic molecules, or mobility, or embodiment, unless these improvements result in something that can be socialized. Unless the computer has the capacity to interact with us in the way that other humans interact with us, it simply will not be able to do what we can do. And it must not simply interact with us, but it must do it to better effect than cats, dogs, and horses. It is hard to see why these things are hard to see when one considers the methodology of sociology and anthropology to which so many of us have been exposed. What do we ourselves do when we want to acquire some fluency in another culture? We mix as much as we can with the strange humans in the "target culture," perhaps for years and years. That way we might slowly pick up those commonly recognized but unstateable assump- tions of similarity and difference that differentiate one society from another. Precisely because these assumptions are unstateable and still somewhat mysterious, we do not know how to write computer programs that mimic these abilities, and we ought to know that we do not know this because we know we cannot train ourselves in the necessary skills from books and manuals. We know how to recognize gaucheness in other humans-how strange it is that we are less ready to recognize improper socialization in machines. Thinking of socialness as a force of nature, it is easy to see why the debate about whether computers could simulate the work of scientists attracted so much attention. In this debate, two different "cherished ideas" were being confounded and attacked. If computers could simulate scientists, then either being a scientist did not require social fluency or computers could attain social fluency. Either outcome would represent a severe setback to the attainments of the sociology of scientific knowledge.</page><page sequence="14">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 507 Disputes about computers, like the science wars, are debates within metasociology. The conclusion of the debate about computers, on the other hand, has led to a new field of applied metasociology. Some Applications of Metasociology Where metasociology has been pursued, its philosophical variant has often been dominant: as is so often the case, unanswerable questions about the fundamental nature of the social have proved more attractive than answerable questions about its significance. Though I do not want to stop people asking questions about the meaning of the social (except when they give wrong answers), I do think that we should not be frightened of treating socialness as an explanatory primitive. One of the exciting things about socialness is that it is a "big" idea yet it also has quite local and concrete implications. On one hand, it deals with the biggest questions of all in philosophy: What is similarity and what is difference? What is special about humans? On the other hand, it has conse- quences at the level of the most concrete technologies. It is the hallmark of the most exciting work in sociology of science and technology that it spans the full range of these levels. I do not think there is another branch of sociology which is like it in this respect. Concrete examples of the working out of the consequences of socialness at the medium and lower levels are spread far more thinly than they should be, but there are some obvious starting points. One thing the idea tells you is how to organize the scientific community so as to lead to speedier transmis- sion of knowledge; you have to arrange for people to spend a lot of time in each others' company; thus, happily, the idea of socialness justifies us all being here in Tucson at someone else's expense. More seriously, the idea can warn against too enthusiastic an endorsement of the technologies involved with distance learning; computer networks are great providers of information but not of education-which is, to a great extent, socialization. Sometimes it is far more difficult to see the implications. For example, in the case of computers and animals, it is made difficult because of the propensity of humans to accommodate, repair, and anthropomorphize. In the case of science, it is made difficult by the social forces that demand one sort of interpretation of scientific work rather than another. Nevertheless, when the concrete contribution of socialness can be teased out in detail, the results are exciting.</page><page sequence="15">508 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Donald MacKenzie's recent study of atom bomb testing is a superb "middle range" study of socialness.7 MacKenzie argued that the skill of developing atom bombs is, and this is my term not his, a matter of social fluency. Gerard de Vries, Wiebe Bijker, and I (1997, 270-71) suggested that "social capabilities survive, like oral cultures, within the continued social activity of those who practice them. Social capabilities cannot be 'dried out,' like soup, ready to be reconstituted when immersed in the proper social context; they cannot hibernate, only die. That is why skills and languages disappear-barring reinvention." They die, of course, because they cannot be stored in written or electronic form. If atom bomb making is, as MacKenzie argued, a social capability, then, as he also argued, if we stop practicing it, we will lose our fluency and this will amount to the uninvention of the bomb. That is an excellent example of what the idea of socialness can do.8 Speech Recognition (and Autism) Speech recognition technology might seem to be at the lower end of the scale of global and intellectual significance, but this is misleading. Its philosophical importance is enormous because it touches on our idea of what separates humans from other entities. It is also a technology of immense economic importance. Applied metasociological analysis of speech recogni- tion can use the idea of socialness to predict the future of the technology. Speech recognition is most often used for automated speech transcription. We might say that there are two models of progress in speech transcription technology-a continuous model and a discontinuous model. At the moment, speech transcription works best when a single speaker carefully enunciates a limited vocabulary, in a restricted domain, after extensively "training" the machine to recognize the unique voice. We can represent the continuous model by placing crosses on dashed lines showing the current state of play and the prospects for progress. Ingenious programming and the rapid growth of computer power are resulting in improvements in speech recognition on all these dimensions; the crosses are moving to the right. There is faster movement on some dimensions than on others, and, while computer power remains a limiting factor, there will be trade-offs between advances on the different horizontal dimensions. If one's head is so deeply buried in the technology that one does not look up, or if one has no idea about the existence of socialness or social fluency, one might well conclude that the steady progress already being made will result in continual movement of the crosses all the way across the dashed lines until a human standard of competence is reached on all dimensions. If one is a little more "savvy," one might think that some breakthrough will be</page><page sequence="16">PRO(3RRSS Speaker: One - -x -?-- &gt; Any Enunciation: Careful -x ------------------&gt; Natural Vocabulary: Limited ---x----------------&gt; Unlimited Domain: Res tri c ted - -x -----------------&gt; Unres tri c ted "Training"; Extensive -x- -----------------&gt; None Figure 1. The continuous model of speech recognition. needed, such as the development of neural nets. But if one believes in socialness as a condition of fluency, one can say with confidence that the crosses will never reach the right-hand side until computers can be socialized in the same way as human beings. Since we have no idea at all how to socialize speech transcribers, we can see that the crosses are going to stay well to the left for the foreseeable future. A much better understanding is to be obtained by substituting this con- tinuous model with a discontinuous model. In this model, the left-hand side is called "Sound Recognition," whereas only the right-hand side is referred to as "Speech Recognition." Using this model, it is more natural to think of the current technology as making progress in recognizing the sounds that correspond to human words. All the trouble arises because humans tend not to be very careful about always using the same sounds to represent the same words; our social fluency allows us to know what is being said even when the sounds that correspond to words are confounded. All the progress on the left is being made either by training humans to be more careful in the way they produce word-sounds so as to make them less confounded or by matching the machine to the particular speaker or domain so that the range of the word-sounds that have to be recognized is limited. The discontinuity is there because to get over to the right, socialness will be needed. I think that a lot less money would be wasted and a lot more progress made in the development of speech recognition if the discontinuous model were used to guide the technology. Furthermore, we can use what we know of socialness to save our own money. If a manufacturer advertises a speech recognizer-or handwriting recognizer for that matter, the problem is the Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 509</page><page sequence="17">SOUND KjsCuuNj'a'~ON u?S1CH RECO~NITION Speaker s One - -x ------&gt; Any Enunciation: Careful -x -------&gt; Na tural Vocabulary: Limi ted - - -x -.-.-.-&gt; 7Un2imi ted Domain: Restricted - -x- -----&gt; Unrestricted "Trn4n~ng"?

The discontinuous model of speech recognition. same-as replacing a human secretary, we can know, without reading any technical manuals, that, taken at face value, the claim is false. I do not want to say that speech transcribers and so forth will not one day become com- monplace, but I do want to say that they will not do the same job as human speech transcribers; they will work in different ways, demanding different sets of skills from the user. For fun, I am also going to make a very concrete prediction. I predict that one successful line of development in the control of machines and other devices by voice will be control by nonword sounds. The discontinuous model suggests that sound recognition will be easier and more reliable if the sounds that are to be recognized are not easy to mix up with word-sounds. Word-sounds are always likely to be produced in a variety of ways because we are used to allowing ourselves the liberty that others' social and linguistic fluency gives us. But humans are quite good at producing nonword sounds, and, precisely because they are not parts of ordinary speech, it is easier to produce them in a similar way, in terms of physical parameters, every time. Furthermore, nonword sounds are less likely to be confused by the sound recognizer with word-sounds produced for other purposes by the speaker or with the words uttered by other passing speakers. If I want my computer to erase a passage, the command "erase" is dangerous. I might want to use the term "erase" as part of my text, or my boss might come by and shout: "There is no way that you are going to get a raise." But these problems will be resolved for both me and my computer if the erase command is, say, "nyi." I'm likely to enunciate "nyi" in a pretty similar way each time, whereas to say "erase" in the same way each time requires special concentration. Furthermore, unless some of Monty Python's Holy Grail knights pass 510 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values</page><page sequence="18">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 511 through my office, it is unlikely that anyone else will be saying "nyi" in the vicinity. (Of course, it is tough to predict the future of social life; it may be that businessmen and women, unlike sociologists at the 4S, will not be prepared to be overheard by their colleagues saying "nyi.")9 One immediately testable prediction follows from the arguments and analogies put forward here. On my account, a severely autistic person would have the same problems understanding natural speech as would a "sound recognizer." Thus, in the case of the autistic child described by Hendriks (1998), a human saying "nyi," or some such, should work just as well as a mechanical alarm. The Undersocialized Conception of Society I have suggested that philosophical metasociology-the exploration of the essence of socialness-has sometimes been pursued at the expense of applied metasociology. That distinction made, there is a far greater division between those who embrace the idea of socialness and social fluency and those for whom these notions play no role in the explanation of behavior or knowledge. In the case of the second kind of disagreement, the parties inhabit different conceptual worlds. In particular, approaches such as actor-network theory, insofar as the actors are properly referred to "actants," inhabit a conceptual universe that is quite different from that of sociology as I have defined it. I think this accounts for the depth of disagreement. For actant-network theory, there can be no socialness because humans can have no special qualities as compared to other species. And this means that socialness cannot be an element in the analysis. There is, let me stress, nothing wrong with a theory of social forces that uses the metaphor of the network, but a metaphysics that treats all contributors to that network as equal cannot be the foundation of sociology, or metasociology, as described here. Networks have two components, nodes and relations between the nodes. Network analyses in which the nodes are identifiable as individuals or types are familiar and useful sociological tools, but the new metaphysics strips the nodes of properties; the nodes are empty place-markers. Any entity repre- sented by a node in these schemes is a cipher, whether it be a human, a nonhuman, or piece of text. In this kind of analysis, all the properties of the nodes are relational. All such properties must be generated only by the patterns in which the nodes are linked. We reach, in this kind of theory, the Cartesian point in which there is the minimum content and the minimum scope for doubt. Thus does "sociology" become a more reductionist science than psychology (which has individuals with consciousness), medicine</page><page sequence="19">512 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values (which deals with bodies and their organs), biology (which treats the content of cells as primitive), biochemistry (which allows the existence of mole- cules), chemistry (which is happy with atoms), and physics (which reduces things no further than quarks). "Sociology," which ought to be the least reduced of the sciences, dealing, as it does, with human collectivities, becomes more reductionist than anything save mathematics. Like mathemat- ics, nothing in this so-called sociology has properties. The reduction explains some of the principle features of actant network theory. There is no place for communities identified by their common skills; divisions and alliances are based on enrollment of other nodes rather than alignments or misalignments of social fluency (this is not, of course, to deny that power and interests play their part in the formation of alliances and enmities); there is no role for participatory learning as an element of the methodology; and there is no role for a Wittgenstein-type, socially embedded rule-following. There is only one kind of action because there is only one kind of entity, and the theory inevitably suffers from the problem of the evidently asymmetrical contribution of the different types of actors to the production of knowledge. The theory holds that there is no special kind of human action and therefore there ought to be no room for humans to contribute to knowledge-making in a special way. And, of course, with the idea of actants, there is no way of saying that a person is behaving in a computer-like way, for there is no such thing as "person-like" or "computer- like" except insofar as the boundary is constructed through relations. (We cannot even say that "we" construct the boundary!) I have selected actant-network theory for discussion because I have already been involved in a debate with its supporters, but there are other theories that are often taken to "belong" to sociology yet inhabit a conceptual universe that does not include socialness among its explanatory resources. I suspect this is true of many of the "postmodern" tendencies that take literary analysis as their model. While the word on the page is a product of socialness, words themselves neither possess nor do not possess socialness. Some versions of ethnomethodology exhibit the same tension. When one believes that the whole of social life can be captured by examining the appearance of interactions in ever greater detail, then there is no deep concept of socialness. Bite into, say, the concepts of "rule" and "routine" as they are used in ethnomethodology and ambivalence is revealed.1l The division between approaches which include the idea of socialness and those that do not is not a matter of product differentiation-it is not a small matter. The difference goes to the very heart of our intellectual enterprise.</page><page sequence="20">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 513 Conclusion There are fuzzy boundaries, complexly interwoven boundaries, disagree- ments about the location of boundaries, different interests in the estab- lishment or nonestablishment of boundaries, and so on. Still I want to insist that there is a boundary between entities that have socialness and those that do not. We have to be able to say the equivalent of "this is pond and this is field" when speaking of entities that possess socialness and those that do not. Given this, other differences follow. Most individual humans do have social- ness but some do not. Humans differ in the content and number of the social fluencies they have acquired. Some participant observers have mastered a particular target social fluency and others have tried and failed.11 There are experts and nonexperts. Experts have social fluency within their area of expertise, nonexperts do not; identifying where the expertise lies is difficult, but the difference between expert and nonexpert must be more than a matter of attribution if we want to hold on to the idea of socialness. The idea of socialness has driven the sociology of scientific knowledge to show that many differences that scientists take as given, or discovered, are socially constructed. Where scientists see many things, sociologists of scien- tific knowledge see one thing-the social. Ironically, the whole dynamic is based on a distinction between the social and the nonsocial, and the other social distinctions follow. The tendency to dissolve all social distinctions seems to have followed from the commendable impulse to take away the very foundations upon which social discrimination among humans is built and the less commendable impulse to push every idea as far as it will go. It is when this impulse is turned into a metaphysical principle with universal application beyond the sphere of human society that things go badly wrong. Not much that I have said is new. The term "socialness" is simply a summary of the deep idea that brought sociology into being. I think it is Durkheimian. Perhaps the only new things are the remark that there is no single term to describe the basic concept, the urging of new applications, and some of the applications. I have suggested that the lack of a single term has, from time to time, made us lose sight of sociology's special contribution to the social sciences. We seem to have been too self-critical and too deferent in the face of analytic approaches innocent of the idea of socialness. Sociolo- gists' self-esteem is, perhaps, too low. Sociology is inevitably and continually assailed by critics. It is disliked because it is a "critical" discipline-it takes what people take for granted and turns it upside down, affecting both the security of established worldviews and those with an investment in the world</page><page sequence="21">514 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values as it is. Second, the findings of sociology, if they are ever allowed to make an impact on the world, disappear like drops of rain on a hot pavement as they are absorbed into common sense. Because sociology's job is to remake the everyday world, as soon as it is remade it seems once more as though the new view was always common sense. We may have been too responsive to these criticisms, ourselves accepting that we are a failure as a science, and desperately casting round for ways of making ourselves into something else-something more mathematical. If we have not succeeded as we should, it is more likely to be because we have spent too long trying to work out the meaning of socialness, or trying to do away with it altogether, instead of celebrating its salience and thinking through its consequences. Criticisms of sociology encapsulated in such expressions as "cultural dope" or "the oversocialized conception of man" suggest that sociology is too rigidly deterministic. But as the sociology of science and technology have shown, there is nothing intrinsically conservative about the idea of social- ness; the gaze of the sociology of science and technology is always upon change-the way that social fluencies are learned, the way that one culture dies and another takes its place, the failed attempts to give social fluency to machines. In spite of this, within the sociology of science and technology, one has a microcosm of the malaise that has affected sociology in general- the idea of socialness has been too easily abandoned and an undersocialized conception of society is gaining currency. Don't abandon socialness! Value it! Celebrate it! Use it! Notes 1. And, as David Mermin pointed out to me, when you see a period film, the actors have dress and mannerisms which fit the time, but the cats and dogs are just cats and dogs. 2. As I have argued elsewhere, however, a fluent Chinese speaker would not be fooled by the "Chinese Room." 3. Contrary to what other writers such as Dreyfus (1993) have argued, I do not think that the cats' and dogs' bodies would have to change for them to learn to become reasonably fluent in our language provided they had socialness and the appropriate socialization (Collins 1996). 4. I have recent work by Donald MacKenzie in mind. 5. "Actant Network Theory" is "meta," but having no concept of socialness (see below), it is not metasociology. 6. It is surprising how the problem of socialization is resisted. For example, the latest model of "intelligent computer," the neural net, has been widely canvassed as a model of the human brain without giving any consideration to the way real human brains are trained or to the limitations of the much better neural nets that are installed in unsocializable animals. These problems seem obvious yet they are rarely even mentioned. 7. The term refers, of course, to Merton's notion of theories of the middle range.</page><page sequence="22">Collins / Undersocialized Conception of Society 515 8. In retrospect, my early (1974) analysis of the transmission of laser-building knowledge was applied metasociology. 9. This model, incidentally, corresponds nicely with the distinction between mimeomorphic and polimorphic actions (Collins and Kusch forthcoming). When we enunciate words with the care required to make things easy for speech transcribers, we are executing special mimeomor- phic actions (embedded, of course, in the polimorphic action of creating prose, poetry, or whatever-but then the transcriber does not have to understand the higher level polimorphic action to transcribe). Speech transcribers are improving as they are built to cope with the casual mimeomorphic actions that normal, lazy speakers execute to frame their words even when speaking to a speech transcriber. To attain human levels of transcribing ability, however, the machine would have to learn to understand the polimorphic actions taking place higher up the action tree, for it is this understanding that comprises social fluency and allows us to make sense of the many types of action that are executed in framing words in normal speech. Including "nyi" in my 4S conference presentation was very much a polimorphic action, but the argument is that analyzed at the level of utterance of the word-sound, "nyi" is very much easier to execute mimeomorphically than words that occur in a natural language. The considerations set out in these paragraphs lead one to expect that, in principle, a pigeon ought to be able to do rudimentary sound recognition and transcription. Likewise, the exchange of sounds, or their body-movement equivalent, is what is going on among bees and ants. 10. We can grant that the correctness of all applications of a rule is potentially negotiable, but this does not explain why they are generally so little in need of negotiation, and how it is that actors are usually able to anticipate others' reactions to new applications of a rule (Mike Lynch pointed this out to me years ago). To eliminate the ambivalence, one would have to answer questions such as: Could conversational analysis be successfully carried out by an analyst who was not socialized into the relevant linguistic culture and therefore did not know something in addition to a set of rules? Bloor (1980) argues a not unrelated point. 11. I, for example, never mastered even a resemblance of social fluency in the area of the theory of amorphous semiconductors-an area which I once tried to investigate but had to abandon.
