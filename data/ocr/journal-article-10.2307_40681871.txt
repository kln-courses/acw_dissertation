<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Pentecostal Flame" and the "Lower Centers": Too True to Be Good by Frederick P. W. McDowell1 Criticism of Shaw's later plays has emphasized that they are structurally weak, tend to sprawl, and possess little unity in action and development.2 In comparison with the plays written in his prime, this stricture possesses some validity, to the extent that these later works lack a number of commanding individuals who dominate - and develop in - personally significant situations. The somewhat loose accretion of character and incident in Too True to Be Good may be partly justified, however, by considering one of Shaw's purposes in writing it: the attempt to register the chaos of the postwar age through the somewhat amorphous structural lines of the work.3 It is possible, therefore, to interpret positively Desmond MacCarthy's negatively presented view of this play as "a series of snapshots taken from different angles of a postwar state of mind/'4 If the figures in Too True to Be Good exert less pressure on the imagination and appeal less to our sympathy than do those in the plays written before Heartbreak House, still the characters are clearly defined and implicated in varying degrees in the pressures of the post-World War I era. Except for the central figures, most of them were not meant to be fully rounded: in the symposium technique wherein the participants exchange ideas, it is enough if the ideas animate the characters and if the characters, at least intermittently, convey symbolically the writer's values. In contrast to Getting Married and Misalliance, the earliest examples of the true symposium in Shaw (if the Hell scene is excepted), the problems argued in Shaw's work after The Apple-Cart are political and social rather than predom- inantly ethical, and public rather than private in scope. In these later plays the ideas explored are more abstract than those analyzed iñ the earlier symposia; one result is that the characters who expound these ideas and who are so fully identified with them become more abstract and allegorical. Characters are, therefore, sometimes less incisively drawn than in the earlier discussion plays, whereas the ordering of ideas shows an increasing virtuosity and stylization. The full truth is more difficult for Shaw to present in these late works, at the same time that is it more difficult for the reader to grasp entirely. In responding to the sense of disorder in the age reflected in Too True to Be Good, most critics have, I feel, overlooked those aspects of the work which give it considerable unity. A loose, even capricious, ordering of materials need not mean a total absence of organization; in Too True to Be Good a minimal framework exists 1 Dr. McDowell teaches English at the State University of Iowa, Iowa City, la. *See A.

Shaw himself may have misled his critics by having "the Microbe" at the end of Act I con- tend that the work is now over but that the characters will spend two more acts discussing it. Actually, Too True to Be Good coheres remarkably in the analysis which Shaw accords its central characters, the Patient and Aubrey Bagot, who develop and show a certain com- plexity. The involutions of their psychology provide a focus for the actions and the thoughts of the other characters whose appearance on the scene is sometimes arbitrary and contrived. The conversion of the Patient, which begins in Act I and is completely worked out in Act III, and the continuous revelation of the varied facets of Aubrey Bagot's character firmly, if somewhat tenuously, hold together this play. Some of the more simply conceived figures in the play, such as Colonel Tallboys and Mrs. Mopply, also show a similar capacity for growth and help keep the play from becoming that mere accretion of episodic material which Shaw's hostile critics have deemed it to be. An air of fantasy, moveover, permeates the play, and gives it a remarkable unity of mood and atmosphere, and sup- ports Shaw's contention that a genuine reality is almost certain to possess strange and bizarre aspects. The Patient's quest for reality begins with her rejection of psychically induced illness and her rebellion against the falseness of the mores of her society when Aubrey Bagot - a lapsed clergyman, a wartime aviator, and an army chaplain now turned burglar - reveals to her the artificiality of her life. He proposes that she sell her jewels and allow herself to be kidnaped by him and his female assistant and former mistress, the amoral Sweetie, who has been hired as night- nurse by the Patient's anxious mother, Mrs. Mopply. In Act II after brief and disillusioning contact with Aubrey, the Patient decides that she needs more than satisfaction of the senses to achieve self-definition. In Act III she attains her positive philosophy, a Shavian harmonizing of contemplative and active elements in personality. Contrapuntally with the Patient's consistent progress toward the light, Shaw presents Aubrey's fumbling journey toward self-realiza- tion. In Act I Aubrey perfervidly lectures the Patient on the need for her to live vitally and dangerously: "Have you no consicence, that you waste God's gifts so shamefully?" In Act II she goes too far in exposing hypocrisy for his comfort; he is a more conventional per- son that he ordinarily cares to admit. In fact, her plain speaking disturbs even Sweetie, who continually seeks, but with increasing disillusionment, for fulfillment through sex alone. As a result of reaction against his newly-found father's restrictive influence, Aubrey in Act III recovers his spiritual independence and admits anew his responsibility to face reality even when it is disconcerting. In the relationships among the Patient, Sweetie, and Aubrey in Acts II and III, there develop many amusing and paradoxical situa- tions. The characters are now in primitive surroundings in a British dependency, possibly somewhere on the African coast Sweetie, un- conventional with respect to sex, is emotionally a slave to convention and wants only romance from the men she has known; for her a love affair must be a perpetual honeymoon. As to personal behavior, Sweetie is the least inhibited person in the play; as to underlying 9 * -28 -</page><page sequence="3">motivation, she is the most impervious to suggestion from without, and is possibly, therefore, the most conservative. For the Patient, Sweetie's harsh candor in confessing her past vagaries is at this point profoundly disturbing, even though the Patient had previously deflated her associate by calling her a "silly bitch." The Patient has not yet completely attained the regenerate state of confident self- possession so greatly valued by Shaw in which she will be able to face with serenity even the most brutal aspects of experience. The result is that she is now distressed by Sweetie's cynical utterances as to the animalism of sex. Upsetting as Sweetie is to her equanimity, the Patient is forced to admit that Sweetie is real since she does more than talk and has had the courage to test her convictions. We know that Shâw in the 1930's favored action instead of theorizing about it; something then is even to be said for action which is, as in Sweetie's case, in accord with the dictates of her "lower centers." One basic form of reality, then, albeit not the highest form, is that manifested by the uncon- scious self. Its irrational urges are frequently more genuine than the articulate ideas in our conscious minds, ideas that are often the result either of an unadmitted hypocrisy or of an unperceptive conformity to convention. Since tthe war the "lower centers," Aubrey remarks, have become "vocal" and have told us new and startling truths: as a result, he perceives that established institutions are violently dis- integrating, "rocking, and splitting and sundering." When the lower centers erupt, there is, accordingly, little left to hold by that is fixed or absolute: "They [the lower centers] leave us no place to live, no certainties, no workable morality, no heaven, no hell, no com- mandments, and no God." The disruptive effects of these "lower centers" - now frankly acknowledged for what they are - extend even to the conventionally organized five act play and make it an inadequate vehicle for the presentation of our modern problems, which are not always susceptible to ordered formulation in a universe where the only immutable law is that of change. Even the higher centers in their most articulate and inspired manifestation as "right reason," cannot countermand completely the influence of our uncon- scious selves. As a relativist in outlook, Shaw welcomed that aspect of modernism which disintegrated inhibiting custom; as a philosopher with some aspirations toward the ideal and the eternal, he was made somewhat uneasy by the too ready denial of all absolutes by "ad- vanced" spokesmen of the time who regarded as significant only those realities emanating from the aggressive instincts. Somewhat later in Act II, the Patient - previously the person shocked - becomes the shocker, and those who have previously been outrageously vociferous are in their turn discomposed by a person exhibiting a still more radical candor. The Patient's^ ideas and atti- tudes are authoritative, since they derive from the "higher centers" rather than the lower. These "higher centers" are ambivalent in nature: if they can speak negatively through "respectable conver- sation" they can also be commandingly evinced through "the great poetry and literature of the world," through inspired utterance of any sort. Sweetie and Aubrey are therefore disarmed by the Patient's consciously assumed mask of vulgarity, when she describes purpose- 19 9 * - 29 -</page><page sequence="4">less human beings as nothing more than "inefficient fertilizers" who "convert good food into bad manure/' The Patient's frankness seems far more brutal to Aubrey than Sweetie's; once the Patient achieves spiritual light, her hold upon reality is strong and her remarks are the more damaging to all pretense because of the inescapable truth they embody. Later, when in Act HI the Patient declaims against being devoured by the "parasites" of the rich, Aubrey recoils from such evocative, figurative language and again feels wounded in spirit by the Patient's "intellectual coarseness." As a result of her experiences in Act II, the Patient finds an inner regeneration and becomes well, strong, and emotionally cleansed. Dressed "en belle sauvage," she has ostensibly been vital- ized by an appreciation of wild nature and has come to appreciate fully the wonders of the universe. More important still, she has at- tained a knowledge of her own inner resources and a sense of social responsibility. If she now knows that her past life has been unreal, her present life is not so genuine as she wishes it to be; and she still yearns for some sort of projection for her sacred self within, which it does not yet have. For this reason she wishes to be vigorous and positive - to beat or even to kill as her "lower centers" might dictate, if that should be necessary - in order that her break with her respectable past may be conclusive. By the exertions of the will, we must achieve a modicum of order from the chaos of our lives and the effects of the lower centers upon them. This attaining of reason- able light by the Patient has its counterpart in Shaw's ordering of his materials in the play: its structure becomes increasingly firm as the Patient assumes spiritual control of her destiny. That she is at the end still a seeker may be inferred from the fact that the play never becomes so taut as those written by Shaw in his middle period. In those earlier works, the central characters found more positive answers to their problems than the Patient manages to achieve. In Act III the Patient realizes still more firmly that a cleansed spirit is only a preliminary - if an indispensable one - to assertive activity in the world outside. Shaw was evidently projecting through the Patient a favorite idea of his, that "until the heart and mind of the people is changed"3 there is little possibility of political progress. The glories of nature are not enough for the Patient who craves "something sensible to do" and who feels "utterly miserable" - like "a lost dog" - without a well-defined purpose in her life. For a time, she feels that she is spiritually adrift, just as Sweetie is emotionally adrift. But her revived self is soon impatient of aimlessness; and she feels herself compelled to become a housekeeper to the world and to set it in order. It is as if she had in mind Shaw's own statement in "The Revolutionist's Handbook" appended to Man and Superman: "If there be no will, we are lost."6 Despite its order and beauty, the cruelties and vastness of the universe lead her, in metaphysical self- defense, to affirm - at least tentatively - humanistic and spiritual values. In Act I, she has not found reality among the enervating luxuries of civilization; in Act II she does not find it in primitive nature; in Act III she finds some degree of truth within her own soul «"The Revolutionist's Handbook, " Man and Superman (Penguin Edition), p. 229. 9 * -30-</page><page sequence="5">as that provides her with the impetus to discover purposes outside and larger than herself.7 Exerting an almost religious consecration to these ends, the Patient wishes to organize a sisterhood which will first withdraw women from the world and then allow them to return to it fortified with a genuine wisdom. This order will appeal to the aspirations of all women, once they have been liberated - as the Patient herself has been - from the tyrannies of the family and sex and once they perceive, then, that family affection and sexual fulfillment are only aspects, sometimes quite nugatory, of self-realization. The sisterhood, the Patient avers, need not even be a nunnery, if the men will enter it without spoiling things - without, that is, obtruding emotional irrelevancies into a program of social betterment. In getting beyond the disillusionments of romance to responsible selfhood, the Patient recalls the Ellie Dunn of Heartbreak House, whose infatuation with Hector Hushabye of course went deeper than the Patient's for Aubrey. Sergeant Fielding, who is not introduced until Act III, combines aspects of the Patient's direct spiritual progress and Aubrey's spiritual vacillation. He is a young man whose moral seriousness has been consistently developed by close study of the Bible and Pilgrims Progress; he used to believe these books implicitly since they seemed to describe as an actuality a divine world far removed from life. They seem to have an even greater relevance, now that he has found in these repositories of God's wisdom an implicit commentary upon the present and a spiritual depth apparently absent from his immediate world. The war itself and the postwar age seem trivial to the Sergeant (as they also seemed in some moods to a disillusioned Shaw) in com- parison with the prophetic intensities which pervade the Bible and Bunyan. The prospect of terror and violence which unnerves Christian when he describes to his wife the overthrow of their city by fire from heaven has its modern counterpart: European capitals, which recall the "falling towers" of Eliot's "The Waste-Land," are on the verge of being destroyed by man-made fire from heaven; and gov- ernors, with their helpless burdens "of corpses and debts on their backs," echo Christian's plaint, "What shall I do to be saved?" This last question sounds antiphonally throughout the whole of Act HI: the Patient and Aubrey are concerned with it and the Elder later uses the phrase. The insecurity and latent violence in the postwar age are, of course, mirrored in the dissolving perspectives which char- acterize the shifting, yet fully articulated, structural lines of the play. The haphazard tensions and the incertitudes of the age are again adroitly suggested by another parallel from Bunyan: we are all concerned, says the Sergeant, with "fleeing from the wrath to come," yet have no "shining light" to guide us. Although the Sergeant reverences the Bible, he is repelled - as Shaw was - by those parts of it which celebrate the arrogance and self-righteousness of a chosen race and their assumed rights of pillage • Ibid., p. 253. 7 1 am indebted to Katherine H. Gatch's discussion of this play in "The Last nays ot Bernard Shaw: Dialectic and Despair," English Stage Comedy (New York: Columbia Uni- versity Press, 1954), pp. 126-147. 0 # - 31 -</page><page sequence="6">and slaughter. The Great War has conclusively shown, he says, how pernicious such an assumption of ethnic superiority can become, both as a national philosophy and as a practical means of solving inter- national problems. Even in a world distrustful of absolutes, the less militant portions of the Scripture, the Sergeant believes, still have spiritual immediacy. Just as Shaw continued to reverence the ethical content of the Bible, so the Sergeant commends as workable ideals those set forth by the Prophet Micah: to "do justice; love mercy; and walk humbly before your God." As a moralist the Sergeant is inferior to the Patient whose resources, self-discipline, and sense of reality are fully realized by the end of the play. He adopts a Shavian view that minds as well as bodies figure in sexual relationships; but in his personal life he fails to live up to the implications of this principle. He is unable to resist the appeal of Sweetie who is essentially mindless and without spirituality. A romanticism which he could only exercise through his critical intellect is in abeyance where Sweetie is concerned; it deflects him from his aspirations and interferes with the forward pro- gression of his inner life. The momentary blindness which overcomes Aubrey during the war when he first saw Sweetie and endowed her with "not only every charm, but every virtue," thus afflicts in more aggravated form the seriously religious Sergeant. The three principal foci of intellectual interest in the play - the Patient, the Sergeant, and Aubrey - thus parallel and complement one another in their development; Shaw's unfolding the destinies of people with some- what similar yet divergent characteristics provides another structural principle in the play. Introduced early in Act III, the Sergeant is, moreover, a link between Sweetie who predominates in Acts I and II and Aubrey whose inspired prophecies close the action in Act III. At the end of the play the Sergeant concludes that sex is "one of the facts that religion has to make room for." At this point he perhaps too readily assumes that association with Sweetie will repre- sent completion for him: life, he perceives, is complex and varied, and can no more ignore Sweetie's sexual hedonism than his own spir- itual conscientiousness. The direction of Sweetie's development away from sex to the impersonal is reversed in the Sergeant: if Sweetie is converted in some degree to a more spiritual life, the Sergeant is in some sense deconverted from it. In sex, Shaw implies, extremes meet and influence one another, sometimes positively, sometimes disastrously. The Patient's mother, Mrs. Mopply, having persecuted Colonel Tallboys for dereliction of duty in failing to rescue her child from brigands, also undergoes a forcible regeneration in Act III, when the Colonel, forced beyond his endurance, strikes her with an um- brella. With this sudden blow, she sees how deadening her own existence, based upon the lifeless aspects of Victorianism, has been. She now finds out that life is the opposite of what she had been told; she agrees with the Elder when he describes her, along with the others, as "falling through the bottomless abyss"; and she admits that now she does not "know my head from my heels." Violence can become, then, a needed preliminary to spiritual light: perhaps this 0 ♦ - 32-</page><page sequence="7">truth is implied in the somewhat contorted presentation of events and people in this play. After some momentary confusion at seeing life with changed eyes, Mrs. Mopply accepts the constructive aspect of modernism: one's responsibility of knowing oneself and of acting to some purpose. The hold of convention over an individual's free life is also amus- ingly revealed in Colonel Tallboys. If it were not for his wife, he says, he would be glad to give up his commission and become a gen- uine man like Private Meek. Meek is the all-competent soldier, whose attributes are those of Shaw's friend, Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who subsequently had a career as private in the Royal Air Force. At first reluctantly and then willingly, Tallboys resigns the conduct of the expedition to a better man who is his inferior in prerogatives. Genuine authority, distinction, and flexibility of mind like Meek's do not need the external support of rank to be effective, Shaw implies: it is possible as a private soldier to possess the talents of a Caesar. It is only when the Colonel gives over his scorn and envy of Meek and treats him as a human being that he becomes a human being himself. After he turns over his command to Meek and devotes himself to water-coloring, he becomes a better man as an artist than he had ever been as a soldier. Shaw implied, moreover, that imperial power administered by a stupid man like Tallboys, with his slavish ad- herence to routine, can hardly last. Although he does not have the stature of Captain Shotover in Heartbreak House, Aubrey Bagot resembles him in being at once a great soul and its caricature. Aubrey's character is, therefore, richly ambiguous throughout the play - he is at times contemptible and at other times supernally wise. Conflicting impressions of Aubrey are registered through the disparate episodes of the play and unite to form a charaters of considerable complexity. Near the point in Act II, for example, where the Patient shocks his prudish sensibility, he yet shows that he is in significant communion with the Life-Force. Com- menting upon Harry Smiler, who gratuitously murdered a policeman after the war for the thrill of the thing, Aubrey says that Harry went wrong because he was totally insensitive to "the miracles of the universe" and to "the problems of human destiny." Thus Aubrey implies that he is appreciative of these larger aspects of existence, as Shaw himself was. Previously, in Act I, Aubrey had been aware of the commanding significance to the Patient of his counsel to revolt: "the aspiring escapes from home, sweet home . . . the girl's prison and the woman's workhouse." Accordingly, he reflects not only Shaw's philosophy of creative evolution but his Nietzschean gospel of living experimentally. At this point, Aubrey sees the need for "the innermost uppermost life" in the Patient to assert itself, he senses that this unsure and challenging world is important only as a field for the adventures "of the life everlasting," and he decries as a primary aim in life the search for security: "They who cry safety first never cross the street: the empires which sacrifice life to security find it in the grave." If the Patient shocks him in Act II and early in Act III (he decides she does not have "the instincts of a lady"), Aubrey, who has - 33 -</page><page sequence="8">the last speech in the play, recovers his balance and comments phil- osophically upon the modern obsession, induced by "the iron lightning of war," of stripping our souls of their "angelic veils." Aubrey's words in this last speech have the ring of sincerity. Yet we do not forget that the Patient had loved Aubrey, found him wanting, and dismissed him as unworthy of her affection. He had previously in Act III de- cided opportunistically to be a popular "saint" - to acquire a halo "as large as Sweetie's sun hat" by making money, endowing hospitals, and contributing to party funds - in contrast to the Patient with her sincere quest for sanctity. Even here, however, Aubrey should not be misjudged: he is surely not the Shavian saint in the sense that Father Keegan is one, yet Aubrey does possess some of Keegan's saintly short- range impracticality and some of his saintly long-range sureness of vision. If the rending of deceptive appearances as described by Aubrey means the loss of some desirable amenities and the revelation "too keen ... to bear" of a concealed life, still we may come to see that the idealisms of the past, comforting as they once were, are no longer quite applicable to the present. In theory Aubrey approves of the modern determination to seize the truth beneath appearances, but in actuality he is dismayed by some of the more violent manifestations of this tendency. Even when he discerns the need at all cost to iden- tify himself with "the pentecostal flame" of the Life-Force, he is still somewhat imperfectly emancipated. Aubrey's timorousness concern- ing revolutionary modernism exceeds that revealed by Shaw. Yet Aubrey's reservations about an extreme iconoclasm may well reflect Shaw's skepticism of the absolutely confident younger generation of the 1920's. The constructive side to present unrest is this: if our souls now go in rags, if their former trappings have been seen to be specious, still knowledge of how things stand is salutary and bracing - Carlyle's point made long ago in Sartor Resartus. At least Aubrey realizes that with the "fiery forcing house" of the war the old standards have gone and life is confusing, chaotic, and disorderly. Accordingly, he finds that the war has bereft him of Bible and creed. Instead of revelling in our "nudity," we must realize that new affirmations are needed to supersede the remnants of outmoded beliefs. New values are needed lest the unimaginative men of action, who do not think and feel, totally prevail, now that "we have outgrown our religion, outgrown our political system, outgrown our own strength of mind and char- acter." We must, Aubrey insists, find "the way of life" or perish; and he realizes that the "lower centers" of Sweetie - which are direction- less - do not comprise all of reality. In so far as he identifies himself with the pentecostal flame, he transcends, then, the chaotic aspects of his own life. The Patient's achievement of light, the Sergeant's incursion of human feeling, and Aubrey's vision of spiritual fire are varying aspects of the positive direction of Act III, and provide an appropriate end to the circuitously unfolding action of the play. Aubrey's sensitivity and sincerity in his most impassioned mo- ments render too extreme, I think, William Irvine's judgment that Aubrey combines "a facility for words with no capacity for faith and 9 ♦ - 34 -</page><page sequence="9">action."8 Aubrey does possess faith, but is tragically unable to express it outwardly by meaningful action. He is to be aligned with those other talkers of intelligence in the Shavian drama who are disorgan- ized or ineffective in their personal lives: Charteris, Valentine, John Tanner, Cusins, Larry Doyle, and Hector Hushabye. If, as Shaw remarked in his preface, Aubrey is a "scoundrel" without "conscience," he still has on occasion insight so deep as to carry unmistakably the burden of the Shavian ethos. In so curtly dismissing Aubrey, Shaw himself may have forgotten his own conviction expressed many times: "It is generally admitted that even good men have their weaknesses: what is less recognized is that rascals have their points of honor."9 In Aubrey Shaw admits that spiritual humility before the ultimate mystery of creation is all-important; yet he feels that earnest social energies, directed by the wisdom accorded us when we are in harmony with ultimate reality, count for still more. The last word may not be with the Patient, but she has had the courage to be forthright in action and to approach the pentecostal flame without fear of being "shrivelled up." Despite his clear appreciation at times of the nature of the ineffable, Aubrey's hesitations in his progress toward the light become emblematic of the difficulties experienced by many intellec- tuals in the modern age in achieving philosophical clarity and self- definition. The unexpected, the unpredictable, the indeterminate, and the paradoxical determine the conditions of modern life and by implica- tion underlie the quest undertaken by the Patient, by Aubrey, and by Sergeant Fielding. As far as salvation is concerned, the Sergeant disagrees with Bunyan that the way is straight before us. A straight road would not in itself get us to heaven; the way to redemption may be circuitous; and in any event the road will have to be opened up by strenuous effort. In this play Shaw delighted thus in presenting certain distortions. Truth is so strange that fiction pales beside it; the unusual, the far- fetched, and the fantastic alone give us the key to reality. Through the means of fantasy, Shaw emphasized the unusual, not to say the grotesque, aspects of life in the twentieth century. As social, political, and moral commentator, Shaw could imply that hiis own standards were close to the opposite of those inherent in the absurd situations he presented; or else he could show that the absurd situations he presented had more reality than those ordinarily accepted without cavil by the conventional. As satirist he also exposed as absurd those influences which interfered with the flexible functioning of the state and with the comprehending relationships between individuals in it. The Patient goes beyond the normal expectations of the Burglar and the night-nurse when she suddenly and unexpectedly jumps out of bed and manhandles those who are threatening to overpower her with violence. One does not ordinarily expect a burglar to be a lapsed clergyman nor for him to have been ordained furtively by the de- viousness of his mother so as to avoid the wrath and opposition of his father, an uncompromising atheist. It is, of course, a fantastic enterprise for the Burglar and the Nurse to kidnap the Patient in «The Universe of G. B. S. (New York, 1949), p. 371. »Everybody's Political What's What (New York, 1944), p. 191. - 35 -</page><page sequence="10">Act I and have her consent to it, but not so fantastic after all if we consider the blankness of her previous existence. When Aubrey challenges her, her response is ambivalent: she feels she is in a dream but does not wish the dream to end. One of the chief characters in Act I, the Microbe, is a creature of Shaw's whimsical fancy through whom he can present some of his opinions upon medicine, disease, and physicians. The most important point made by the Microbe is that illness is often psychosomatic. For comic effect Shaw inverted accepted theories upon the cause of disease by presenting the Microbe-monster as having been made ill by the hypochrondriac Patient, instead of his causing her to be sick. Since the play opens with the plaints of the Microbe, the fantastic aspects of the play - its partial divorce from the completely probable - is established from the very outset. In Shaw's view, doctors are not often the healers they are purported to be; they sometimes make a sickly person yet more ill. At least the physician in this play has the honesty to admit that he is a hypocrite. When the Patient recovers from her hypochrondria, the Microbe who had been made ill by her excesses recovers. The doctor had previously told the Microbe that it is faith in oneself and in "that mysterious power which gives us our life and which none of us knows anything about" rather than science which makes one well; but a doctor customarily ascribes his cures to "science" because that it what people believe in. In the situations involving Aubrey and his father, Shaw reversed stereotyped characters and incidents so completely that the play once again acquires the startling quality we associate with the unique fabrications of fantasy. In the Elder, Shaw satirized the somnolence with which the Victorian intellectual in literature and life lost his faith in traditional Christianity and exchanged for the inscrutable workings of an anthropomorphic creator a faith in scientific reality. Accordingly, Shaw presented a new phenomenon in literature, the atheist who in the twentieth century has lost irretrievably his faith in the "new" orthodoxy of nineteenth century science which had erected deterministic natural law into an absolute. In the twentieth century the "infallible" laws of nature have only a contingent validity, as a result of "indeterministic" theorizing which stresses probability rather than uniformity in the workings of the universe. The Elder does not know what to do to be saved now that his dogmatic philosophy of science has been questioned now that the dynamic "Purpose and Design" basic to Shaw's theory of creative evolution may be rising "from the dead" to cast down the sway of impersonal natural law. He can only feel a sense of violent overthrow, a sense of forces at work which he cannot understand, an overpowering sense of dis- integration in nature and society.10 The Elder cannot see that purpose and design exist, but that their workings in life are inscrutable, episodic, and unpredictable. Shaw may actually have thought that he could best embody his Einsteinian indeterminism and relativity in a somewhat "photographic" representation of the external form- lessness of nature and society. Pattern in the natural and human 10 In this regard, see Shaw's statement in Everybody's Political What's What, p. 361: "Mr. Everyman is often as credulous and bigoted in his modern scientific scepticism as his grandfather was in his Evangclicism." 9 + -36-</page><page sequence="11">world is thus concealed but intermittently asserts itself strongly; just so does Shaw's sense of dramatic structure, in apparent abeyance in the play, firmly support its somewhat miscellaneous groupings of characters and incidents. The Elder fails to see that his intellectual rigidity and his sentimentalizing of a liberal creed have resulted in a departure from a desirable norm of values. What had been sophistication in the Victorian era has come to be intellectual immaturity, if not timidity, in the modern age. If the Elder's intellectual foundations have moul- dered and if he does not quite possess the imaginative force to for- mulate a new philosophy, he has painfully acquired a Shavian insight into the reasons for the failure of deterministic science, as a myth or religion, to provide spiritual light and life for the present age: "The science I pinned my faith to is bankrupt: its tales were more foolish than all the miracles of the priests, its cruelties more horrible than all the atrocities of the Inquisition. Its spread of enlightenment has been a spread of cancer: its counsels that were to have established the millenium have led straight to European suicide." The fantastic elements of the play shade off into allegory. People and incidents take on overtly symbolic value as a result of being several removes from average reality. Aubrey, himself no exception to his own statement, says of these people in his concluding speech: "There is something fantastic about them, something unreal, and per- verse, something profoundly unsatisfactory." The Patient, both un- regenerate and regenerate, is emblematic of the modern age. On the one hand, she is symbolic in her sickness, in her self-pity, and in her self-indulgence of those aspects of the age which Shaw felt should be ridiculed. On the other hand, she also possesses productive energies which at first lie fallow but which the present-day individual may utilize to achieve a modicum of order out of disorder. Accordingly, the Patient has used her own resources to achieve regeneration and to de- velop a secular idealism, and she has shown unexpected strength, phys- ical and moral, when the Burglar challenges her. The directionless younger generation as a whole is epitomized in Sweetie who is fickleness incarnate and who is characterized by her inconstancy and her complete lack of moral sense. Colonel Tallboys is symbolic as a survivor from the Victorian Age which produced him, in his earlier conventionality, in his sense of frustration over men and women who lack direction and faith, and in his recourse to nature and art - the solace of the spiritually shaken Victorian - when, in his later more perceptive phase, humanity still seems to fail him. The ills of the modern age can be measured in terms of Aubrey's futile life as petty criminal after the war. His life of crime had its origin in the bombings in which he participated: as he says, the theft of a pearl necklace is nothing in comparison to the things which he did during the war with his father's implied approval. It is not valid, Aubrey says, to divide himself into a war self and a peace self, as some would still urge him to do. Our evil impulses are part of our whole psychology and cannot be separated from it; our sinful natures, as well as our potential idealism, argue our common humanity. Even sincere impulses may be pernicious if they are not rationally exam- ined. Mrs. Bagot's uncritical enthusiasm for the war forced Aubrey's 9 * - 37 -</page><page sequence="12">reluctant brother into it - the result was that he was killed and she died of remorse. The irritating optimism and bluster in his father's prewar agnos- ticism caused Aubrey in revulsion to become a clergyman in the established church. However, Aubrey discerns during his wartime career as army chaplain certain hypocrisies which disillusion him with organized religion as strongly as his father had been disillus- ioned with it: "When I was wounded and lost my nerve for flying, I became an army chaplain. I then found myself obliged to tell mortally wounded men that they were dying in a state of grace and were going straight to heaven, while as a matter of fact they were dying in mortal sin and going elsewhere." Aubrey's disillusionment with the Christianity he has embraced is radical and represents, at least in part, Shaw's own distrust of the latent hypocrisy he saw in many of the official formulations of Christian values. When his father accuses him of being a scoundrel, Aubrey says that his religious education (engineered by his mother without the Elder's knowledge) has taught him that if he is "bold, unscrupulous, acquisitive, successful and rich," only then will he be admired and respected, and only then can he afford to be honest. The Elder, figure of ridicule as he sometimes is, betrays too much urgency in his conviction that all of us are falling into a "bottom- less abyss" for this assertion to seem only the timorous utterance of an idiosyncratic man. The stridency of his statements is in itself an indication that the modern age is in chaos, and there is truth as well as hysteria in his contention that, having fallen into this abyss, "our dizzy brains can utter nothing but madness." The Sergeant at least agrees with the Elder that in the war the bottom not only came out of soldiering but out of everything: the war, he says, was not devil- ment but damnation. With the Elder's rejoinder that we are only "lost souls, all of us," the Patient agrees in part, she says, that in fact "we are only lost dogs" and that, despite our present drifting, we may like lost dogs, find our way home again - if we but achieve command of ourselves. In his concluding speech Aubrey understands the sharp but limited insights of his parent, the Elder, and declares, echoing him, that the people in the play "are all ... falling, falling, falling end- lessly and hopelessly through a void in which they can find no foot- ing.' The latent violences in the period erupt in catastrophe: see the sudden onset of the Great War, which was, in part, the result of the unimaginative application to human affairs of the Elder's positivistic science. In Too True to Be Good Shaw acutely balanced the positive with the negative. If Aubrey and the Patient at the end of the play are optimistic, still one must admit that their optimism is only tenta- tive. Tone and texture of the play, on the other hand, aptly mirror the chaotic post-war age to which Shaw, as an intellectual conditioned in part during another period, had to adjust himself. The presence in conjunction in Too True to Be Good of the objective critical spirit, of a strong subjective sympathy with the characters, of a sense of the underlying tensions of the 1920's, and of an inventive fancy consistently expressing itself in richly symbolic situations provide this play with greater distinction, I feel, than it has ordinarily been thought to possess. 9* -38-</page></plain_text>
