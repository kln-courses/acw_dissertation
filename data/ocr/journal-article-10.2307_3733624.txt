<plain_text><page sequence="1">'CORTAS LAS FALDAS, CORTAS LAS MELENAS': THE REINVENTED FEMININE IN RAFAEL ALBERTI'S CAL Y CANTO The publication in I927 of Caly canto marks a significant change in both the poetic form and the content of Rafael Alberti's work. His previous four poetic collections, written between 1920 and I926, reveal neo-popular elements, with a predominant use of the copla form and evident echoes of the cancionero tradition.' It has long been acknowledged that it is the poetry of Alberti's second phase that has inspired most critical interest and acclaim. Caly canto marks the watershed between a first poetic phase and the profound, surreal expression of later works such as Sobre los angeles ( 929) and Sermonesy moradas (1930). Immediately on his return to Madrid from Rute (Cordoba) where he had written El alba del alheli during the winter of 1926, Alberti recognized the need for change, yet was mindful of his early success in winning the prestigious Premio Nacional de Literatura I924-25 for his debut collection, Marinero en tierra. The poet recalls this dilemma in graphic terms: 'jQue hacer para arrancar de nuevo? Ya el poema breve, ritmico, de corte musical me producia cansancio. Era como un limon exprimido del todo, dificil de sacarle un jugo diferente.'2 This poetic change of direction is partly a result of his intense desire to continue successfully in his newly found vocation, but, in addition, he was motivated by the imminent tercentenary of the death of the poet Luis de Gongora. Not for the first time Alberti was directly inspired by the Spanish poetic heritage to which he belonged: 'G6ngora nos llegaba muy oportunamente' (AP, p. 235). Caly canto is, thus, the fruit of a determined decision to develop new poetic- avenues, openly embracing a distinct lyrical style and employing innovative models. Faithful to his technique of initiating a poetic work, Alberti recalls: 'Necesitaba con urgencia un titulo. (C6mo conducirme sin el, cefiir la nueva lirica avalancha que intentaba invadirme?' (p. 234). The original title, Pasionyforma (changed onJose Bergamin's advice to Caly canto, which Alberti terms as 'de significado incompleto'),3 betrays perhaps more clearly a new obsession with poetic form, recognized by the poet himself: 'Con Caly canto la belleza formal se apoder6 de mi hasta casi petrificarme el sentimiento' (AP, p. 157). Caly canto, a collection of thirty-seven poems, divided into eight parts, has not been analysed in relation to Alberti's earlier opus, nor as part of a poetic dynamic that begins in 1920 with the experimental Poemas anteriores. As has been the case with much of Alberti's early poetry, critics have been inclined to categorize collections in a rather facile and sweeping manner. Geoffrey Connell confirms this tendency when 1 Critics have frequently failed to deal separately with Alberti's first three published works, Marinero en tierra (I924), La amante (I926), and El alba del alheli (1928), preferring to group the collections as one early poetic phase. The poet's earliest lyrical experiments were collected and assembled later by his niece, Maria Alberti. The forty-eight poems, entitled Poemas anteriores a Marinero en tierra, are included in the Obra completa, 3 vols (Madrid: Aguilar, 1988), hereafter OC. References are to volume and page number. 2 Rafael Alberti, La arboleda perdida (Barcelona: Seix Barral, 198I), p. 234, hereafter AP. 3 Rafael Alberti, Prosas encontradas, 1924-1942, ed. by Robert Marrast (Madrid: Ayuso, 1970), p. I74. A possible source for this strange title may be found in the Spanish proverb 'Entre santa y santo, pared de cal y canto'. There is ample evidence of Alberti's love of popular verse and of his interest in the cantos populares, ed. by F. Rodriguez Marin (Cantos populares espanoles (Seville: Alvarez, 1882)) and by A. Barbieri (El cancionero musical de los siglos XVy XVI (Madrid: Real Academia de San Fernando, 1890) ).</page><page sequence="2">72 The Feminine in Alberti's 'Caly canto' he comments: 'In discussing Caly canto, the emphasis is always on the supposedly Gongorine form, and content is generally neglected.'4 Similarly, in his comprehen- sive study of the work of the poets of the Generation of 1927, C. B. Morris emphasizes the 'world of verbal artifice' with its 'dense verbal texture and syntactic booby-traps'5 created by Alberti in Caly canto. The presentation of women in the poems of Caly canto has been neglected critically: explorations of theme have tended to centre on 'the new age of adventure, mechanical progress and rapid communica- tion' (p. 85) portrayed in various poems. Alberti himself is similarly vague about the theme and overall significance of many of the poems of Caly canto, preferring to stress the linguistic aspects of the work, 'la belleza idiomatica, los mas vibrados timbres armoniosos, imagenes que se sucederian con una velocidad cinemato- grafica' (AP, p. 234). What is of particular interest here are not the paroxysms of linguistic fabrication influenced by the culto style of Gongora, but rather how Alberti's poetic presentation of the feminine may be employed to decode a putative authorial psyche, the female figures being considered here as an idiom through which the young poet subconsciously articulates his relationship with the world. His previous poetic collections, Marinero en tierra, La amante, and El alba del alheli, feature lyrics that have at their core an idiosyncratic and highly individualized portrayal of women. A constant feature of Alberti's early lyrics is the poetic delineation of a pure, unadulterated feminine, whether communicated in the guise of'la sirenita del mar', 'Blanca-nieve', or 'la Virgen Maria'. The poet's reliance on the idiom of fairy-tale and his refuge in the chaste, undefiled feminine signal his inability to engage with adult existence, an inability that was to have significant repercussions on his later life and poetry.6 From his earliest poetry, Alberti sublimates the female figure, frequently swathing the feminine in beatific and quasi-divine imagery. From the earliest lyrics of Poemas anteriores, he establishes a referential paradigm of the unadulterated feminine whose dynamic constantly reinvents the pure female in an eclectic mix of guises throughout the early poetic texts. Neutered and sexless females haunt the poet through this early phase, acquiring an iconic status and creating a safe, asexual poetic refuge. It is of note that the female figures presented are exclusively asexual, revealing 'a fear of freedom' and 'an unconscious aversion to real life'.7 The underwater world of Marinero en tierra frequently exudes the aura of a submarine theme-park, a lyrical fantasy world behind barricades. Dream-fodder for this curious never-never land is provided in the guise of both the anthropomorphic female fantasy, 'la hortelanita' (OC, I, 39), and her mythical counterpart, 'la sirenita verde' (p. 79). The sea, a constant image in Alberti's work from 1920 to the present, occupies a central position within his psyche. The luminous seascapes of his birth place, 'el primoroso mar de Cadiz' (AP, p. 34), are the direct inspiration for the creation of poetic underwater groves, inhabited by 'la sirenilla deseada'. It is the descent of the poetic subject to 'los bosques de coral' in 'Sueino del marinero' (OC, I, 79-80), the opening poem of 4Geoffrey Connell, 'Sobre los dngeles: Form and Theme', Spanish Studies, 4 (I982), -14 (p. 2). 5C.

Cal y canto is, then, even more startling when evaluated in conjunction with Alberti's previous lyrical trajectory. However, the need to manipulate the female form is found in the collection immediately preceding Caly canto, El alba del alheli, in which the seeds for the abuse and debasement of the female figure may be found. Interestingly, such lyrics are found in the third and final section of El alba del alheli, 'El verde alheli', which was written in late 1926 immediately before Alberti began Caly canto. A gradual abuse and pollution of the feminine can be traced to poems such as 'Playeras': LA enterr6 de medio cuerpo frente al mar. Y al albedrio del viento, la deje la voz y el pecho. Triste, se puso a cantar: -Quien me ha partido mi cuerpo, frente al mar? (OC, I, 282) The desecration and destruction of the idyllic marine environment essential to the well-being of Alberti's psyche finds its genesis in the late poems of El alba del alheli, where the female figures systematically assume the role of victim, unexpectedly immersed in an alien, polluted world: LLORA, marinera, tu mejor llorar. iBarca mia carbonera, siempre ennegreciendo el mar! (I, 285-86) As the poems of Caly canto were soon to reflect, both the real world and Alberti's poetic seascape were undergoing immense changes. The lyrical parameters of this safe, underwater haven were gradually being penetrated by late 1926: BARCAS extranjeros, hija, barcos extranjeros. Barcos extranjeros anclan en el puerto. Anclan en el puerto, hija, con sus marineros. Con sus marineros, hija... iPronto, corre a verlos! (I, 286) The female figure of the copla 'Fuga' is both wounded and persecuted, banished from the safe haven of the sea, forced from innocence to maturity, a process symbolized by the appearance of possibly menstrual blood. DESCALCICA, por las piedras. iSangrando va! Yo, detras. Chinas que eran blancas, chinas coloradicas son ya. 73</page><page sequence="4">The Feminine in Alberti's 'Caly canto' iQue se fue! iSangrando va! D6nde ya? Coloradico esta el mar. (I, 288) A purge of the seas, casting the female form to land, registers an emphatic rejection on Alberti's part of the security of childhood, initiating a drawn-out and painful process of integration into adulthood. Caly canto opens a tortured poetic cycle, which finds its most surreal expression in Sobre los angeles, establishing Alberti as 'Spain's finest and most authentic Surrealist poet'.8 Robert Havard comments that 'Alberti's angels are nothing less than external projections of his embittered mind. They are a purely cathartic facility which isolates and gives concrete form to the amorphous, warring forces of his psyche, making them surface one by one' (p. 249). In the same way, the poetic delineation of the feminine in Caly canto heralds Alberti's impending mental crisis, registered here in a nascent aggression and desire to mutilate all vestiges of the past, the supreme symbol of which is 'la sirenita'. That critics have consistently overlooked Alberti's early poetry is borne out by the fact that no association has been established between the rudimentary motifs of 'la sirenita' and 'los angeles' of the Poemas anteriores and their later, more brilliant counterparts in Caly canto and Sobre los angeles. The poems of Caly canto are of double significance then, functioning as a transitional bridge between two mutually dependent poetic phases, yet providing continuity of both theme and motif. It is the disparity between a fervent sublimation of women in Alberti's early collections and their swift, unmitigated violation in Caly canto that indicate an imbalance on the part of the poet, an eventual mental crisis, afforded essential lyrical expression a year later in Sobre los angeles. What, then, makes the female figures of Cal y canto so different from their immediate antecedents in both Poemas anteriores and Marinero en tierra? The deliberate and vitriolic distortion of the feminine image may be attributed in part to the influence of Francisco de Quevedo and his. masterly pursuit of parody and the cult of the grotesque, but it is important to evaluate Alberti's portrayal of women in Caly canto as part of an emerging, organic process that begins with the Poemas anteriores, and not simply as a literary exercise in satire. The first section of Caly canto, containing four sonnets, provides graphic evidence of violence directed towards the poetic feminine. Whilst many of the poems in Caly canto defy unequivocal interpretation, two sonnets in particular, 'Busca' and 'Amaranta', project a female figure who is both victimized and pursued, to be ultimately wounded by exterior aggressive elements. In 'Busca', once again, Alberti is inspired by seascapes and the sonnet is pictorial on a grand scale: Night and Dawn are personified as victimized female figures. As in the traditional lyric, dawn signals a mood of danger and flight that in turn increases the threat to the central female figure, Night: HERIDA, sobre un toro desmandado, salta la noche que la mar cimbrea. jPor d6nde tu, si ardiendo en la marea va, vengador, mi can decapitado? (I, 305) 8 Robert Havard, From Romanticism to Surrealism: Seven Spanish Poets (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1988), p. 242. 74</page><page sequence="5">HELEN LAURENSON Multiple elements of violence surround the fleeing female, making the episode into a chaotic nightmare encapsulated in the image of the decapitated, vengeful hound. The dynamic of female desecration begun in 'El verde alheli' continues in Stanza 2 of 'Busca': 'Rompe la aurora en el acantilado I su frente y por el viento marinea' (I, 305). This potent mutilation of the female face registers an emphatic, rather misogynist aggression, which is replicated in the sonnet, 'Amaranta'. The central female figure here exudes a sensuality that is again desecrated and violated: RUBIOS, pulidos senos de Amaranta, por una lengua de lebrel limados. P6rticos de limones desviados por el canal que asciende a tu garganta. (I, 307) Again, female beauty (here, a stylized, Gongorine version) is in jeopardy of violation and abuse, an abuse actively encouraged by the poetic voice: Rojo, un puente de rizos se adelanta e incendia tus marfiles ondulados. Muerde, heridor, tus dientes desangrados, y corvo, en vilo, al viento te levanta. (I, 307) The theme of persecution and violation continues in Section ii with the poem, 'El arquero y la sirena'. Again, the poem is pictorial on a grand scale: the sea personified as a sensual female figure, PLAYERAS y siroco. Capitana, la mar: luna en el pecho. A la cintura, rota, la banda azul de la mafiana, y resbalando de su frente oscura, las dobles ondas negras de su pelo y el ambar verde de su carne pura. (I, 3 I) This sensual poetic feminine is depicted in fearful flight, accompanied by a mermaid Arrebolada y destronando el cielo, que en fuga de cristal llora mecido, bordando una sirena su pafiuelo. (I, 311) The passivity and submission of the embroidering mermaid evokes the innocent lyrics of Marinero en tierra: Nardo y carmin, los dedos bordadores, por la pendiente de la malva tela, van sembrando, luz, sombra, los colores. (I, 312) Here, too, the poetic voice admonishes 'la sirenita', predicting her merciless wounding at the hands of the archer: jAy sirenita del paiuelo, incauta, atenta al hilo y no a la punteria, p6rtico el arco, del arquero nauta! (1, 312) 75</page><page sequence="6">76 The Feminine in Alberti's 'Caly canto' The figure of 'la sirenita del mar', who surfaces as early as 1922 in 'Balcones' (I, 44) is derived from a multitude of sources. Alberti's singling out of the 'sirena' as his poetic hallmark may be attributed to purely personal reasons, an affection towards the charming and delicate mythical sea-creature. In a mood of amorous intimacy the little mermaid acts as an agent of profound nostalgia for the poet, transporting him back to his childhood close to the Bay of Cadiz. Not only is 'la sirenita' synonymous with popular tradition and sea shanties, but she is also physically represented on the facades of several buildings in El Puerto de Santa Maria. Jose Luis Tejada, a native of the town, comments: 'Este termino sirenita es doblemente popular por su diminutivo y por su referencia a un personaje de una mitologia folklorica representada, como motivo heraldico, en los escudos de las viejas casonas del Puerto.'9 It is important to emphasize that in their initial phase Alberti's 'sirenas' are gentle and industrious creatures, far removed from the classical siren of mythology. Central to a conception of'la sirena albertiana' lies the English distinction between mermaid and siren that does not exist in Spanish. In Marinero en tierra, Alberti's 'sirenita verde' leads an innocent existence in an underwater 'mas alla', described as 'virgen sembradora' and 'cantadora en vano', tending her underwater habitats, the 'huertos submarinos' and 'jardines albos del amanecer' (OC, I, 125). For the young poet, the pivotal figure of 'la sirenita' was an ingenious diversion from the complex issues of feminine sexuality. Enveloping himself in a poetic underwater vacuum, Alberti turns his back on reality and delights in the sexless innocence of his mermaid. Eduardo Cirlot maintains that as a symbol: '[Sirenas] son simbolos del deseo, en su aspecto mas doloroso que lleva a la autodestrucci6n, pues su cuerpo anormal no puede satisfacer los anhelos que su canto y su belleza de rostro y busto despiertan.'10 In his first published work, the mermaid's sexless quality and inability to satisfy man physically is seen by Alberti as a relief, a safeguard against the formidable and intimidating world of sexuality. Just as has been the case of the lunar maidens depicted in the Poemas anteriores, the mermaids of Marinero en tierra never leave their impenetrable poetic environment, and are only once depicted crossing the border between sea and land. Indeed, the mermaid in the poem 'La sirena del campo', who makes this transition from the depths of the seas to terrafirma, perishes in the process: SONAMBULA, la sirena. iSeguidla por la ladera!. (Bajo la verde lluvia de dos sauces, sola, una hamaca que columpia el aire.) Duerme, sirena del valle, hija de la madreselva. Tus trenzas de perejil se te enreden por la yerba. El esquil6n de los bueyes da la hora de la siesta. (Bajo la verde lluvia de dos sauces, sirena muerta, te columpia el aire.) (I, 96-97) 9Jose Luis Tejada, RafaelAlberti, entre la tradicidny la vanguardia (Madrid: Gredos, 1977), pp. 195-96. 10 Eduardo Cirlot, Diccionario de Simbolos (Barcelona: Labor, 1988), p. 415.</page><page sequence="7">HELEN LAURENSON The 'sirenita', the most potent of symbols in Alberti's early poetry, represents a sexless and essentially impenetrable female who, safely out of reach in lyrical marine spheres, is therefore safe and infantile, and totally lacking in any threatening eroticism: BRANQUIAS quisiera tener, porque me quiero casar. Mi novia vive en el mar y nunca la puedo ver. Madruguera, plantadora, allA en los valles salinos. iNovia mia, labradora de los huertos submarinos! iYo nunca te podre ver jardinera en tus jardines albos del amanecer! (I, 125) Both the mermaid and her lyrical sister, the lunar maiden of the Poemas anteriores, are powerful leitmotifs of the young Rafael Alberti's anxiety for purity, an almost compulsive necessity to moderate or restrain natural female sexuality. Far from being a playful and insignificant thread within the main body of his poetic work, Alberti's 'sirenita' and 'hortelana del mar' are symptomatic of more fundamental neuroses. It is for this reason that no evaluation can be made of the lyrical rendering of women in Caly canto without first taking into consideration the ruthless volte-face that had occurred by 1926. If Caly canto is viewed as the culmination of a poetic dynamic initiated in the Poemas anteriores, then Alberti's poetic vision becomes clear and coherent. However, viewed as an entity, without detailed reference to previous works, an exegesis of the text proves so elusive that critics have preferred to avoid it and concentrate on the innovative technical aspects of the work. In addition to this new and complex poetic style, the treatment of theme differs greatly from previous poetic collections. Of all the poems featuring female figures, 'Suefio de las Tres Sirenas' (I, 315- 6) is the most striking. Written in hendecasyllabic tercetos, both the syntax and the lexicon of the poem are much influenced by the elements of culteranismo, replete with a Latinate vocabulary and artificial style." The opening lines of 'Suefio de las Tres Sirenas' seem to reflect the schism that divides Alberti's first poetic phase and his later, more mature work: NACARES de la luna ya olvidados, las verdes colas de las tres sirenas, que huyendo de la mar y sus pescados. cortas las faldas, cortas las melenas, reinas del viento, los celestes bares solicitan en tres hidros alados. (I, 315) Consciously imitating the lavish vocabulary of G6ngora with its frequent reference to precious minerals and stones, 'nacar', 'marfil', 'cristal', Alberti registers a ' Alberti had previously experimented with hendecasyllabic tercets in Marinero en tierra ('Suenio del marinero' (OC, i, 79-80)) and in the same work had composed several sonnets in the style of G6ngora ('A un Capitan de Navio' (i, 83) and 'Malva-Luna-de-Yelo' I, 89)). 77</page><page sequence="8">The Feminine in Alberti's 'Caly canto' transition from innocence to experience: the 'nacar' of the mermaids' tails is a potent, shimmering symbol of their past innocence. The juxtaposition of these first two tercets, with their contrasting presentation of the female form, encapsulates a loss of innocence and idealism central to Alberti's poetry of this phase. Interestingly, in editions published before the 1988 Obra completa quoted here, line 3 reads, 'que huyendo de la mar y sus pecados', which suggests that the mermaids have indeed been cast out from their marine paradise because of misdemeanour, sexual or otherwise. If the female form is the idiom through which Alberti reveals his relationship both with the world and with his own psyche, the startling image of short skirts and cropped hair of these reinvented mermaids seems to suggest a dubious morality. In the context of the traditional lyric, imitated in a masterly way by Alberti in his second collection, La amante, long hair is synonymous with virtue and virginity. He is evidently conscious of the implications of a woman's status as revealed by the dressing of her hair; the shorn locks of these mermaids are a clear indication of their disgrace.'2 In addition to presenting an immaculate vision of women in his early lyrics, in El alba del alheli Alberti even goes as far as to present a poetic admonition of forgoing simplicity and innocence in the lyric 'De la ciudad al campo': TU no sabes lo que es eso, y ojala nunca lo sepas: en la boca el colorete, las melenitas cortadas, el cuerpo sobre la falda y las medias transparentes. eNo sabes que ya las rosas no son del tiempo en la cara? Si a ti te las pinta el aire, imejor que mejor, serrana! (I, 238-39) Not only does the previous lyric indicate the traditional 'ciudad'/'campo' opposi- tion, a theme often explored by Spanish writers, but in addition establishes an oppositional portrayal of women, whereby the female form is strictly dichotomized, either virtuous virgin or fallen woman. What is of particular note is that both female images are perceived and valued in purely sexual terms, and that both conditions are principally denoted by external, physical appearance. Alberti's startling lyrical dichotomy between Madonna and Magdalene upholds 'the powerful undertow of misogyny in Christianity, which associates women with the dangers and degradation of the flesh'. 3 12 In the traditional lyric, hair is a tangible register of the moral status of the girl, as registered by A. Sanchez Romeralo in El Villancico (Madrid: Gredos, I969), p. 428, no. 145. No tengo cabellos, madre, mas tengo bonico donaire. No tengo cabellos, madre, que me lleguen a la cinta; mas tengo bonico donaire. Hair was worn long only by young 'doncellas', or maidens; married women wore their hair in a cap, and nuns had shaved heads. 'La cabeza rapada', or shaved head, also popularly indicated shame and disgrace, as in the 1940s with Republican women in Spain after Franco's victory, and with women collaborators in France in the I940s. 13 Marina Warner, Alone ofAll her Sex: The Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary (London: Picador, I990), p. 225. 78</page><page sequence="9">HELEN LAURENSON It may be that 'Suefio de las Tres Sirenas' is an expression of the young Alberti's own repressed sexual desires. For the first time, the 'sirenas' are granted a voice of their own, yet this voice functions primarily as the subliminal expression of the poet's need to sever all ties with his past, in order to achieve the prerequisite transition from adolescent to adult. This fall into consciousness is translated into the need to dwell on land, and the poem functions as a paean to the delights of terrestrial and sexual existence: iQu6 amarga ya la menta de los mares! iGloria al vapor azul de los licores y al sonoro cristal de los vasares! (I, 315) A similar ambience is evoked in the poem 'Oso de mar y tierra', where a sea nymph is curiously placed amidst seedy portside bars and sailors: Bar en los puertos y en las interiores ciudades navegadas de tranvias, tras la nereida azul que en los licores cuenta al oido y canta al marinero coplas del mar y de sus valles frias. (I, 3I4) In a biographical context, it is of note that Alberti himself recalls certain misogynist tendencies as early as 1920. When he discovered that his friend, the young sculptor Julio Antonio, was dying of tuberculosis, the poet attributed his demise directly to women: 'Por el supe que las mujeres - cosa que me las hizo imaginar por entonces como unos serpenteantes monstruos bebedores de sangre - le habian sacado su avasalladorajuventud, llevandolo al final a la tuberculosis que lo tenia ya tan afilado y enfebrecido' (AP, p. 127). Alberti's misogyny and suspicion of sex, implicit in the above rather tremendista lines, were reaffirmed little over a year later when he himself was diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis. From I920 to 1927 when he composed Caly canto, he had sought refuge in a vault of lyrical innocence, surrounding himself with such neutered females as the 'sirenita', the 'marinerito', and the lunar maidens. However, by the time he was writing Caly canto, the powerful urge of sexuality had seemingly taken hold and was expressing itself through the reinvented feminine of the poems under consideration. A battle of wills had begun, which was to result in the tortured compositions of Sobre los dngeles a year later. This discourse of discord is implicit in two tercetos from 'Suefo de las Tres Sirenas', where a radical change of poetic environment is projected: Bajo las ondas, novios marineros, nunca mas, ni por playas y bahias, los pescadores y carabineros. Si por hoteles y confiterias, alfiler de sol puro en la corbata, angeles albos de las neverias. (I, 315- 6) The three mermaids jilt their innocent sweethearts, 'los novios marineros', for the sordid and possibly sexual pleasure of trawling terrestrial hotels and gaudy sweetshops. That the mermaids and Alberti himself are experiencing acute frustration with the highly symbolic and constrictive underwater world may be decoded in their exclamation at the end of the poem: 79</page><page sequence="10">80 The Feminine in Alberti's 'Caly canto' No mas algidas ferias submarinas, ni a las damas jugar con los tritones y al ajedrez con los guardias marinas. iMuerte a la mar con nuestros tres arpones! (I, 316) This dynamic of wounding the marine female, begun in 'El verde alheli' in 1926, reaches full realization in Caly canto, where the poet attempts to assassinate the sea itself. Alberti's preoccupation with the technical advances of the modern world has been much commented in relation to the thematic content of Caly canto, and this obsession is translated by a desire to obliterate both the symbols and the stylistic features of his primera etapa, exemplified by the final stanza of the sonnet 'Romeo and Julieta': iOh mar adolescente, mar desnudo, con quince lunas candidas, camino de los cielos y tierras ignoradas! (I, 325) With the poem 'A Miss X, enterrada en el viento del oeste', Alberti's relationship with his lyrical female is reaching a final, moribund stage. In his next work, Sobre los dngeles, he encodes his trauma by employing exclusively 'los angeles' 'no como los cristianos, corp6reos, de los bellos cuadros o estampas, sino como irresistibles fuerzas del espiritu, moldeables a los estados mas turbios y secretos de mi naturaleza' (AP, p. 264). In this often playful and at times comic elegy, he bids farewell not simply to Miss X but also to his poetic past, represented by the elements of the traditional lyric: iAH, Miss X, Miss X: 20 anos! Blusas en las ventanas, los peluqueros lloran sin tu melena -fuego rubio cortado-. (I, 36I) With her newly shorn hair and presumably high heels ('-jte aprietan los zapatos?'-), Miss X is depicted as fleeing from the safety of familiarity, reinvented by 'las modistas' and 'los peluqueros', her flight being a subliminal desire on the part of Alberti to achieve self-expression and independence. The mood of the poem is one of mourning: El barman, joh, que triste! (Cerveza. Limonada. Whisky. Cocktail de ginebra.) Ha pintado de negro las botellas. Y las banderas, alegrias del bar, de negro, a media asta. (I, 361-62) Miss X is nowhere to be found, a fact that implies a total absorption into a newly anonymous and disposable society, reiterated in the final line of the poem, 'ya nadie</page><page sequence="11">HELEN LAURENSON piensa en ti, Miss X, nifa'. The disorderly world of images in this poem would seem to herald the full-scale surreal expression of Sobre los dngeles. Treinta barcos, cuarenta hidroaviones y un velero cargado de naranjas, gritando por el mar y por las nubes. (I, 362) Again, the rich lexis denotes a fundamental schism in the psyche of Alberti, two powerful forces in conflict, the old and the new, which can be resolved only by the ultimate vanquishing of one of them through lyrical battle. The incongruous image of the sailing-ship loaded with oranges, 'el velero cargado de naranjas', belongs to the traditional poetic discourse ofMarinero en tierra and such poems as 'De La Habana ha venido un barco': DE mi ventana huye el barco venido ayer de la Habana. iSaltemos del lecho al barco, lucero de la mafiana! Al pasar por tu azotea, me echaras una naranja y un zapatito de oro, lleno de almendras y agua. (I, I 14) In both cases the orange, inspired by the cancionero tradition, is synonymous with 'mutual or corresponded love'14 and with the innocent promise of love. That the 'velero cargado de naranjas' should have been placed amidst the 'hidroaviones' suggests a discord, which the poet can not begin to contend with until the supreme symbol of his innocent past, the woman, has disappeared. With the definitive evaporation of'Miss X de los mares', he is left somewhat bereft in a poetic landscape strikingly similar to that projected in Sobre los angeles: Sol electrocutado. Luna carbonizada. Temor al oso blanco del invierno. (i, 363) The eighth and final section of Caly canto, comprising the eighteen-stanza poem 'Carta abierta', is an attempt to reconcile the two disparate worlds in conflict in Alberti's psyche. The discordant juxtaposition of aspects of his childhood in El Puerto de Santa Maria and the technical developments of the I920S creates an unresolved and vertiginous chaos, exemplified in these stanzas: ... HAY peces que se baian en la arena y ciclistas que corren por las olas. Yo pienso en mi. Colegio sobre el mar. Infancia ya en balandro o bicicleta. 14 Paula Olinger, Images of Transformation in Traditional Hispanic Poetry (Newark, DE:Juan de la Cuesta, I985), p. 15.</page><page sequence="12">82 The Feminine in Alberti's 'Caly canto' Nueva York esta en Cadiz o en el Puerto. Sevilla esta en Paris, Islandia o Persia. Un chino no es un chino. Un transeunte puede ser blanco al par que verde y negro. (I, 371-72) Whilst the poem is not strictly concerned with a central female form, the feminine makes a brief reappearance, surreal and disjunctured, in the closing lines of 'Carta abierta': 'Un polis6n de nieve, blanqueando I las sombras, se suicida en losjardines' (I, 372). The entire poem is an attempt at self-definition, Alberti's attempt to find a role for himself in the midst of multiple elements of chaos and insecurity. His concerns are encapsulated in the final stanza: Sabed de mi, que dije por telefono mi madrigal dinamico a los hombres: eQui6n eres tuf, de acero, rayo y plomo? -Un relampago mas, la nueva vida. (i, 373) Having dispensed with the female figures so central in his poetry from I920 to 1927, Alberti was abandoned to the reality of his mental crisis, bereft of lyrical refuge in his 'sirenita verde'. The organic development and delineation of Alberti's poetic feminine, traced briefly here, swiftly gave way in Sobre los angeles to a rapid descent into the poetic realms of neurotic disintegration: 'Carbunclo hueco, negro, desprendido de un angel que iba para piedra nocturna, para limite entre la muerte y la nada' (i, 432). From Caly canto, it was but a short step to the nihilism and desperation of Sobre los dngeles, which has so frequently been analysed independently, not as the inevitable outcome of neuroses clearly articulated in previous poetic collections. The fact that Alberti's most critically celebrated work, Sobre los dngeles, evolved as a direct result of his subliminal avoidance of natural feminine sexuality has been overlooked by critics. Thus, the female figures of his poetry of the period 1920-27 provide an essential interpretive key to his more mature work and chronicle his need to purify ad absurdum a self-destructive dynamic his psyche could not sustain beyond Caly canto.
