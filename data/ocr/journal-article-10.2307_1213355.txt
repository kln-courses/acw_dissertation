The Terminator Films and Recent Changes in the U.S. Auto Industry The Discourse of Technology, Ideology, and Subjectivity Since the 1970s, the term "transparency" has been widely used to signify the concealment of the techno- logical means of the cinematic illusion characteristic of classical and realistic film style.1 Such concealment has been assumed necessary for the cinematic appara- tus to achieve its ideological subject effect by provid- ing a coherent yet illusory spectator position. Conversely, any self-reflexive inscription of a film's technical means of production, the hallmark of post- 1968 radical and avant-garde cinema, was assumed to radically subvert this ideological work.2 While these categorical terms may now seem somewhat dated, the relationship between technology, ideology, and subjectivity in the cinema is still worthy of serious investigation. One of the problems with many previous attempts has been their failure to rec- ognize that cinema has always served a dual function with respect to technology, not only as a technology itself, but also as a means of representing technologi- cal change and narrativizing its social effects. These two functions interact in very interesting and some- times contradictory ways, complicating the question 20</page><page sequence="2">The ultimate machine: Arnold Schwarzenneger in The Terminator of technology and ideology, rendering notions such as transparency or self-reflexivity overly simplistic. The fact that cinematic hardware is mostly "absent" from the experience of the spectator today needs to be rethought in a broader context which includes the widespread discourse of technical innovation, an im- portant component of cinema marketing and its ap- peal.3 Likewise, technological self-reflexivity, now a common device of television advertising, may conceal as much or more about the ideology of representation than it reveals. Fascination with technology, conscious or other- wise, is an important component of cinema, from an early preoccupation with trains to the digital morphing technology of the T-1000 cyborg in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (James Cameron, 1991), creating at times its own visual spectacle. Vivian Sobchack points out that the science fiction genre in particular appro- priates culture's newest technology, incorporating it in its own language of special effects.4 However, there is more to this than a genre-specific marketing strategy. Here is where technology and ideology in the cinema may be more concretely investigated in terms of the function played by films in which the technologies of re-production are re-presented as representational technologies. 21</page><page sequence="3">Films like Terminator 2: Judgement Day (T2) and its predecessor, The Terminator (T1) (Cameron, 1984), make a fascinating case study of the cinema's technological discourse. In T2, the original T-800 Ter- minator from TI, a product of the advanced industrial age despite being from the future, returns to protect humanity from the more technologically advanced T- 1000, a fully-blown postmodern morph. The narrative and ideological conflicts here explode between human and machine, coherent subjectivity and polymor- phism; the modern (linear, hierarchic, industrial) and the postmodern (nonlinear, polymorphic, postindus- trial); and perhaps even between the cinema as an in- dustrial apparatus still tied to analogical mechanical reproduction and the threat of virtual reality posed by computer-generated digital media. If the cinema may sometimes foreground its own technology as part of its spectacle in contrast to the limited notion of transparency, this hardly means that cinema escapes ideology. As ideological subjects, we enjoy the cinema as a space in which the real contra- dictions of the increasingly technologically deter- mined conditions of subjectivity are played out in the imaginary. As an apparatus which brings objective conditions and subjective desires into contact, cin- ema's own technology plays a significant part in this process.5 From this perspective, the cinematic appara- tus provides a partial means of integrating people who are violently subjected to the alienation effects of industrial capitalism into its social formation. This partial integration represents a dialectical process whereby the pleasure of its modernized subject effect is offered in exchange for new forms of subjugation. Recent changes in the automobile industry, which had previously established the dominant mode of in- dustrial mass production of the twentieth century, placed demands on the cinema to mediate between technology and subjectivity. The cinematic image of the robot has a history of representing the relationship between human and machine as a model of techno- logically determined subjectivity. This paper explores the discourse of technology, subjectivity, and ideology in the films The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judg- ment Day, with particular attention to the real relations between people and robots, i.e., between workers and industrial automation in the U.S. auto industry. The Robots Are Coming! Although the 1980s saw the film industry successfully driven by new special-effects technologies, expanding video distribution, and diversified product tie-ins, the U.S. automobile industry went through a time of se- vere crisis. Owing to a number of factors, the U.S. The former factory model: pressed steel building (1941) 22</page><page sequence="4">share of auto sales dropped dramatically between 1974 and 1991, forcing hundreds of plant closures and thousands of employee layoffs. Between 1978 and 1980, over 200,000 jobs were lost,6 with industry un- employment in this same period rising from 3.9 per- cent to 20.4 percent.7 According to M.I.T. industry analyst Martin Anderson, the resulting restructuring of the U.S. auto industry "constituted the largest shift in technological, human, and capital resources in U.S. industrial history."8 Since 1980, these fundamental changes have in- creasingly emphasized technological innovation as the principle means of increasing productivity. The as- sembly-line production methods pioneered by Ford consisted of large-scale dedicated machines in highly specialized plants, achieving large economies of scale. Assembly-line production required only semi-skilled workers, who were forced to assume the dehumaniz- ing characteristics of the single-purpose machines of the factory.9 Faced with rapidly changing markets, in- creasing international competition, particularly from Japan, and two recessions caused by fuel shortages, the American auto industry collapsed, in large mea- sure because of those rigid production methods which had once made it so successful. In order to adapt to these changing conditions, U.S. auto manufacturers unanimously adopted the methods which they assumed accounted for the suc- cess of Japanese industry. The key concept among these was known as "flexible production," utilizing unspecialized, quickly reprogrammable computer- controlled machinery (i.e., industrial robots) and cross-trained, diversely skilled workers who could move rapidly from job to job as production require- ments dictated. These changes would allow factories to meet the requirements of rapid product diversifica- tion and differentiation without sacrificing economies of scale. By the mid-80s, flexibility had become the key idea in the transformation of the industry and its attendant modes of production and forms of subjec- tivity. Just as the former assembly- line worker was forced to assume the repetitive functionality of the dedicated machine, the new worker of the factory of the future would be forced to assume the character of the new industrial robot, capable of rapid morpholog- ical transformation from task to task, which entailed job retraining and the loss of union job classification and seniority benefits. These changes offered the never-to-be-realized promise of improving the lives of the workers who were forced to adapt to the demands of flexible pro- duction. Industry leaders claimed the industrial robot would finally free workers from the drudgery of repet- itive, dangerous, mind-numbing, and back-breaking assembly-line jobs so that they could pursue more challenging and individually fulfilling tasks. For all the jobs eventually lost to robots, the new technolo- gies promised to create even more new jobs, and, ul- timately, to change the character of work, humanizing the workplace and empowering workers in the pro- duction process. These unfulfilled promises concealed manage- ment's belief that the single most important obstacle to increasing productivity was the diminishing ratio of output per worker to wages,10 and that the cost of in- dustrial robots was declining inversely to the rising cost of labor.11 Workers feared that robots promised not increased empowerment and better working con- ditions, as management promised, but no work at all. This fear reached epidemic proportions in the early 1980s, some reports attributing the 200,000 jobs al- ready lost due mostly to plant closings, to robotization instead.12 Among several similar reports, a 1981 Carnegie-Mellon study predicted that over the next twenty years, three million more jobs would be lost to industrial robots.13 Battered by the anti-union policies of Ronald Rea- gan (and Margaret Thatcher), labor unions were faced with the choice between plant closing and moderniza- tion (with its attendant job losses), and were therefore forced to accept the logic of increasing productivity through technological change. They redirected their efforts to fighting for retraining and replacement guar- antees for displaced workers. 14 Not surprisingly, man- agement targeted those plants with histories of labor unrest, using robots to eliminate or threaten trouble- some groups of workers. 15 And just as in the 1930s the industry successfully displaced the management/labor struggle onto conflicts among different ethnic groups competing for jobs at different wage levels, in the 1980s it fueled a Japan-bashing/buy-American cam- paign to disguise its anti-labor campaign as national- ism, simultaneously merging its operations with its Japanese counterparts and outsourcing much of its component production to foreign plants that exploited much cheaper labor. Between 1980 and 1990 the robot became the metonymic symbol of the turbulent transition from as- sembly-line production to the fully automated "factory of the future." Management handbooks stressed the importance of "humanizing" the image of the robot in the workplace, as "assistant" or "co-worker."16 One such handbook refers to The Empire Strikes Back, in- structing plant managers that the perception of robots 23</page><page sequence="5">The factory of the future: Wayne Escort/Lynx assembly plant (1986) in their factories as either friendly "droids" like R2D2 or destructive war machines like the Death Star would be determined by their spin control. 17 For many work- ers, however, the industrial robot symbolized manage- ment's dream of factories without workers, or few enough of them to have been stripped of their collec- tive bargaining power despite the increased individual empowerment their newly defined roles promised. These changes, and their attendant conflicts, were reflected in the film industry on numerous levels. Computers and robots found their way into the narra- tives of a vast number of commercial films during the 80s. Two films by John Badham paradoxically reflect the process of negotiating the human/machine con- flict. Foreshadowing the apocalypse of The Termina- tor, the supercomputer is demonized in War Games (1983) while robots are humanized in Short Circuit (1988), a thinly veiled right-to-life allegory. The human/machine conflict is treated with ambivalence in Robocop (Paul Verhoeven, 1987): the cyborg Mc- Murphy's human side allows him to outwit all the predictably dumb machines he encounters while his technologically enhanced capabilities allow him to defeat his fellow humans. This film may best illustrate the film industry's own ambivalence toward the social consequences of technological change as it exploits its attendant conflicts as narrative fodder while in- creasingly relying upon computers and robotics to generate the special visual and auditory effects which reap it enormous profits during the decade. From Factory to Film: The Terminator The perception that industrial robots would replace human workers may have contributed to the enormous popularity of the relatively low-budget (and therefore less special in its effects) science fiction thriller The Terminator. The fear that our automated machines may ultimately become too intelligent and may even- tually do away with us, as the Skynet defense network will attempt to do in the future posited by The Termi- nator, reflects popular perception that industrial ma- chines would make human workers obsolete. The fear of termination by a robot programmed to accomplish the specific task of eliminating human life is really the fear of job termination, of replacement by a machine that can do it better, faster, cheaper, and without seek- ing better working conditions or higher pay.18 The possibility that The Terminator adapts social contradictions stemming from changes in the indus- trial mode of production as its narrative conflict be- comes even more certain at the end of the film, as the Terminator meets its end on the assembly line of an 24</page><page sequence="6">automated manufacturing plant. The final chase is less a chase in the classic sense than a representation of as- sembly-line production as Sarah and the Terminator are carried along by the factory conveyor belt. The as- sembly line, like so many trains in classic films, is both a narrative vehicle and a metaphor for the cinema itself, assembling a narrative scene by scene, carried along the conveyor belt of its rolling celluloid toward completion, narrative closure, and packaging and marketing of the "product." While the speed of the cinematic assembly line is standardized at 24fps, labor has struggled to acquire some control over the speed of the factory assembly line and to acquire the power to, when necessary, halt the process, arresting the "narrative" of production. Stopping the manufacturing process threatens profits just as breaking narrative transitivity threatens the film's ideological construc- tion of the subject. To management, one of the most appealing as- pects of robotization is the end of this historical struggle over assembly-line control, replacing work- ers with machines designed to work continuously at a fixed rate of speed for better production manage- ment. Sarah is the first to escape from the assembly line, after leading the Terminator into the hydraulic stamping press, taking control of the machinery of production herself. Instead of hitting the stop button just in time to save a fellow worker from injury, she hits the go button, terminating the Terminator and bringing the narrative of the chase to an end. Thus the end of The Terminator, robot and film, is doubly ironic. The Terminator is "killed" on the assembly line -like countless humans whose deaths resulted from similar industrial accidents or inhuman working conditions-by the same high-tech industrial ma- chinery that threatens to terminate workers' jobs and rights, and which the robot terminator symbolically represents. In a recent work, Janice Rushing and Thomas Frentz question the narrative success of The Termina- tor's ending, calling it thrilling but claiming that it fails to find a resolution for its Luddite human-ma- chine conflict.19 While Sarah effectively kills the Ter- minator, thus ending the immediate threat to her life, and allowing history and humankind to continue and the cinematic narrative to end, her victory does noth- ing to relieve the social contradictions of technology, representing (according to Rushing and Frentz) the sacrifice of liberty and community in exchange for in- creased productivity and leisure. It seems too much to ask a film which is exploiting this human/machine conflict for its commercial appeal to provide a mean- ingful solution to the problem. Yet the film offers a narrative solution, leaving open the possibility of dif- ferent kinds of technology, good and bad, providing a temporary coping mechanism with the real situation. Technology is good as long as it remains within human control and serves human interests; it is bad when it achieves autonomy. In other words, the human cannot be replaced by the machine. Even the auto- mated factory requires human supervision, mainte- nance, and control. This dialectical ending of The Terminator may provide a threatened worker with the simultaneous satisfaction of conquering the robot which symboli- cally threatens his or her livelihood if not life (which, under Reagan, may even have amounted to the same thing) at the same time that the narrative redeems the automated factory as needing humans and serving the needs of humanity, humanizing its image for manage- ment. The ideological function of the film may thus have been to mediate some of the real fears and ten- sions of job termination in the workplace, providing the substitute satisfaction of terminating the robot ter- minator in the imaginary as an alternative to the real possibility of sabotage in the factory. Sarah (Linda Hamilton) terminates the Terminator 25</page><page sequence="7">The Factory of the Future The actual number of jobs lost to robots, although sig- nificant, was much lower than predicted, owing to re- location of workers to positions vacated through attrition. The real losses were to new job opportuni- ties, to affirmative action programs targeted at those new positions, and to union power. The fundamental change brought about by the introduction of robots was the increased stress of job retraining and diversi- fication: the requirements of flexibility imposed by the Japanese-inspired model of production.20 According to Steven Babson, M.I.T.'s best-selling description of the factory of the future, The Machine That Changed the World, was hailed by plant man- agers in the auto industry as the newest Testament. It promised that old Fordist assembly-line methods would give way to teams of multi-skilled, job-rotating workers who would finally achieve human fulfillment in the workplace.21 While embracing the goal of in- creasing productivity and thus employment, the U.A.W. warned that management's plan to "democra- tize" the workplace was a smoke screen concealing its efforts to undermine collective bargaining and repeal individual workers' rights. According to Babson, the promise of worker empowerment masks new forms of exploitation,22 and attacks on the rigidities of tradi- tional production conceal the real problems of man- agerial inefficiency and short-term profiteering.23 The real goal of the Japanese-inspired "lean production" methods, he says, is to eliminate all wasted time, man- power, energy, and cost, which amounts to little more than a neo-Taylorism aimed at speeding up the pro- duction line, the traditional battleground between management and labor since 1949.24 However real or imaginary the benefits of the hu- manized factory of the future may be, workers would be forced to meet the requirements of flexibility or lose their jobs. Flexible production may be the re- quirement that poses the most significant threat inso- far as it undermines traditional job classifications, one of the tenets of union protection. One management guidebook describes the lateral job flexibility require- ment of the new factory as "morphological," like the conveniently reprogrammable industrial robot driving the lean production process. To lose one's job classi- fication would, in a sense, mean losing one's individ- uality, one's self, as well as the hard-fought benefits associated with it. Flexible production not only places new compet- itive pressures on and between individual workers, it allows large companies to force competition between individual manufacturing plants. Because the new or redesigned facilities can be cheaply adapted to differ- ent production requirements, management can force individual plants to compete for different automotive models, gaining greater union and labor concessions in exchange for continuing employment.25 The Japan- ese model of flexible production is known by its crit- ics as "management by stress."26 In many cases, U.S. implementation of the Japanese model led to longer hours and higher injury rates on top of the demands of job retraining and rotation27-hardly the liberation promised by managerial rhetoric. By 1991 and the re- lease of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the anticipated massive loss of jobs to robots had not occurred. Au- tomation had proven itself a greater threat to hard- fought union work rules and pay scales than it had to jobs, and had introduced new stresses into the work environment.28 The Terminator: the automated factory comes online 26</page><page sequence="8">Flipbook: sequence of police surveillence pictures shown to Sarah From Film to Factory: Terminator 2 Whereas T1 (the T-800 series robot of TI) may repre- sent the ultimate transformation of man into machine, (indeed Rushing and Frentz call T' "the sovereign ra- tional subject of modernism," the embodiment of "Taylorist efficiency"), it remains distinguishable from us as a machine.29 It is an analogical representa- tion, passing human, but not quite. Its threat is mani- fest in its mechanical capabilities as measured against frail human characteristics. A greater threat is posed by T2 (the updated T-1000 of T2), which can assume the virtual form of any person or object it comes into contact with, less a representation than a simulation. Rushing and Frentz claim that T2's meaning emerges from the interaction between its own technological form, which made it the most expensive movie then produced, and its narrative action.30 Indeed, the con- flict between a redeemed Tl, returned in the sequel to protect the future savior of mankind, and T2, sent to terminate him before he can do so, is between two forms of technology: between "hard" and "soft" ma- chines in the real world, and between analog and digital technologies of representation in the realm of cinematic special effects-the almost antiquated stop/go-motion technique which animates the skeletal armature of T1, and the technique of digital image morphing, which renders the transformational effects of T2. Morphing requires the same computational re- sources that make the morphological industrial robot possible. As a representational technology used to depict transformations between forms and objects, morphing itself represents the most significant char- acteristic of contemporary production technology: transformational fexibility. T1 returns in the sequel as a reprogrammed and rehablitated "humanized" version of its former evil self. On one hand, this transformation stems from Arnold Schwarzenegger's stated desire to provide a better role model for kids and improve his popular image, showing off his own morphological potential to play different and more demanding character roles.31 On the other hand, this transformation may also reflect the manufacturing industry managers' suc- cess at humanizing the image of the robot in the work- place: no longer perceived as the direct replacement for the human worker, it is now seen as a necessary means to increasing production, which provides some degree of job security. Continuing the logic of the end- ing of The Terminator, once under human control and serving human needs, the machine is good, protecting workers from work-related danger. In an ironic rever- sal of the fear of becoming machines ourselves, T' proves to be even better at being human than we are. Other possible implications aside, it is, in Sarah's words, the only would-be father for John who "mea- sures up." T2 on the other hand, is hardly a robot at all in the conventional sense. Made of a liquid metal poly-alloy, 27</page><page sequence="9">Melting pot: the end of the Terminator it has no intrinsic identity or structure. It is morpho- logical change itself, possessing the ability to become any object or person (of any gender) it comes into contact with. It represents the ultimate realization of Bazin's realist myth of total cinema. It literally be- comes that which it copies, fully real in every sense, replacing the original. Its threat then is manifold, crossing the boundaries between the film's narrative and its technical means of production; between the real and its changing mode of production; between genders and other subjective identities, and between the thing and its representation, representing the end of representation itself. Even if T2 is destroyed beyond recall at the end of the film, the morphological tech- nology it represents, that of its narrative fiction as well as its own cinematic realization, continues to pose the threat of total simulation, the perfection of virtual re- ality, effectively bracketing out reality, and its analog, the cinema, altogether. At the risk of anthropomorphism, it may be pos- sible to see here a fear on the part of the cinema itself that its ideological and technological relationship to a particular industrial mode of production is nearing its end, to be replaced by yet-unrealized computer-gener- ated simulations. At the end of T2, after a series of in- dustrial accidents which would have deprived any human of life or limb, both terminators are dissolved together in their own industrial melting pot. This end- ing may say something about the contemporary inte- gration of analog and digital technologies in the cinema, as it does about the integration of old and new modes of production in industry. But it also seems clear that the days of the mechanical means of cine- matic representation, like the traditional factory and its job-classified worker and their corresponding forms of coherent subjectivity, may be numbered. Self-Reflexivity As Transparency The humanistic outlook hailed by managers of the new production process masked the increasing indi- vidual stress and diminished collective strength of workers in the same way that, according to Steven Whittaker, "[digital morphing's] pseudo-change pro- tects the status quo from the threat of real-that is so- cially rather than technically achieved-change."32 In an article with the provocative title, "Morphing Sucks!," Whittaker states, "[i]n morphing, scientific modernity commodifies and makes graphic its own belief in a quantifiable equivalence of, or a mediated elision between, things."33 He cites the example of a television commercial for razors in which persons of distinctly different ethnicities continuously blend to- gether into a synthetic poly-person, claiming that all faces and skin types are equivalent, as long as you buy the razor. Michael Jackson's music video "Black or White" uses the same morphing technique, blending figures of different ethnicities as well as genders whose syn- thetic identity becomes polymorphism itself. This polymorph lip-syncs Jackson's song to us as the music's subject, representing perhaps Jackson's own rather amorphous and transformational gender and ethnicity, telling us, "it don't matter if you're black or white"-as long, again, as you buy the record. At the end of the video, with almost certainly unintentional irony, the race-ambiguous Jackson morphs into the form of a black panther. This "equivalence" of subjects-as-consumers, morphing together in a new image of the melting pot in which race and gender identities are little more than fashion accessories, elides the real differences that the 28</page><page sequence="10">global economy of the new world order imposes upon and between us. Like the rapid morphological trans- formations of the factory that result in product diver- sity and worker uncertainty, the social construction of the postmodern subject conceals itself not by masking its traces behind an apparently self-determined indi- viduality as before, but by its ever-changing and self- glorifying denial of coherent identity. Common criticism that T2, with its overly atten- tion-grabbing special effects, failed to achieve the level of horror attained by The Terminator overlooks the complex interplay of technology and ideology which is represented in the film and which makes the film's own technological representation possible. T2 meets its end, like its predecessor, on the factory floor-this time an old-style steel mill (improbably lo- cated in Southern California)-another victim of an industrial "accident," where its multiple identities dis- solve into the melting pot to end up, possibly, as the hood of someone's car. The ideological function of this film was certainly not the same as that of its pre- decessor (to displace fears of job termination); it was instead to simultaneously evoke the lesser but no less real horrors represented by flexible production while using the same digital technology of flexible produc- tion in a spectacular display of itself to distract us from those real-world problems. The lesser horror of T2, resulting from its overly spectacular high-tech representation, has been likened to the overly technical and certainly less horrific representation of the Gulf War compared to previous representations, such as the war in Vietnam.34 If self- reflexivity ever was a guarantee of a knowledge effect in contradistinction to an ideological effect, which is doubtful, it isn't any longer. The real horror of T2, like that of high-tech representations of the Gulf War, is that the technology of representation, even in the full light of its self-reflexivity and our understanding of its technical means of production, can so blind us to the real forms of human exploitation and suffering it masks.

Several others have already pointed out that self-reflexiv- ity may ultimately serve contradictory or even reactionary ends. See, for example, Jane Feuer's comments in "The Self-Reflexive Musical and the Myth of Entertainment," Quarterly Review of Film Studies 2.3 (1977). Rather than repeating this critique of self-reflexivity, I am hoping in- stead to call into question the assumed ideology of trans- parency by arguing that all forms of cinema are self-reflexive to some degree and that cinema audiences may be more consciously aware of cinema as representa- tion than is generally assumed. 3. Several magazines and cable programs which are dedi- cated to the subject of "movie magic" serve to demystify the means of cinematic production. Recently, the computer has placed the very same means of production of digital special effects in the hands of the audience. These facts need to be taken into consideration in discussions of the re- lationship between technology and ideology in the cinema. 4. Vivian Sobchack, Screening Space: The American Science Fiction Film (New York: Ungar, 1987). 5. Indeed, the idea that cinema achieves its ideological ef- fects through concealment of its technical means of pro- duction contradicts the possibility suggested by others that the cinematic apparatus itself serves the ideological func- tion of mediating between ideological subjects and the technological modes of production of industrial capitalism (which made the cinema possible). According to Keith Cohen, the invention of the cinema provided a means of transforming the negative psychological effects of the ma- chine age into pleasure. Cinema, "the most striking exam- ple of a material link between art and technology," provided a complex aesthetic experience based entirely upon mechanical reproduction, which, according to Cohen, could "transform systematically into art even the most stultifying or potentially dehumanizing qualities of machine culture."
