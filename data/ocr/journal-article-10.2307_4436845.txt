<plain_text><page sequence="1">22 The American Biology Teacher [Oct. Biology Lor Contemporary Youth HERBERT A. DWYER Roosevelt High School, Dayton, Ohio If biology is the science of life and all its manifestations then some coordinating principle should have been derived, long ago, between the existing facts of life and the teaching of those facts so that they would be helpful to the youth of the nation. Ignoring the urgent needs of youth the biology teacher assembled in the past a veritable bedlam of isolated facts in his texts and syllabi. These inadequately illustrated his precious principles of hereditary ratios, anthropomorphic illu- minations, victorian sentimentalisms, taxonomic hieroglyphics, unseasonable ontogenies and phylogenies, ad infinitum. He assumed that his systematics, be- cause of their rational presentation, were psychologically assimilable by young people. He was worried over the unit plan and projects, the functional and type courses. His teachers colleges were constantly in the throes of intellectual agony, as they are today, over the down- fall of progressivism and the new ascen- sion of elementarism. Truly, the naturalistic, progressive viewpoint toward these matters had never been established. Biology teaching rarelv extended itself beyond the day of Thomas Henry Huxley in actual practice. The exception was the master artist teacher who understood youth and forgot peda- gogical theory. In fact all of this disregard for scien- tific educational facts emerged from a fundamental disregard for the focal point of education, namely, that of the pupil. The actual answer to the dilemma has never been in the materials of the labora- tory but in man. Witness the clearest illustration in the eminently suecessful C.C.C. experinment. This program, inain- tained by the U. S. Army and not by an educational institution has approached the solution of the problem and set a standard for all time. Here life and learning approach closer. Simple biological concepts are enter- tained in only practicable and workable situations. The healthful, wholesome, constructive efforts manifested in the pro- gram are far removed from the pressure techniques of the systematized encyclo- pedic biology teaching in our schools. Modification of the paper and pencil classroom methods will be necessary ulti- mately in order to acquire the status of the C.C.C. program, for excelleniee in edu- cational results. This must be done and can only be done when the pupil is foremost in the educa- tor's mind. With the pupil as the end and theory, principles, materials of the laboratory as the means, an about face, in the right direction can be secured. From recent studies as the National Survey of Secondary Educationi and the Youth Commission of the American Council of Education new truths regard- ing the new entity, present day youth, will give a new orientation. In the monograph on Secondary School population of the National Survey of Sec- ondary Education and in the Youth Com- mission survey of Maryland "Youth Tell Their Story," the biology teacher may discover a different situatioln thani during his day. Many suggestions necessary for a new and basic viewpoint of biology teaching can be derived from their dis- coveries.</page><page sequence="2">1938] Biology for Contemporary Youth 23 Some are; over twenty million young people from fourteen to twenty-four have been bequeathed by past generations a frightful spectacle of incompetent social- economnic philosophies, economic deprava- tions, devastating indebtedness, slum areas, depleted natural resources, broken homes, mental disease and endless prob- lems which should not have been their heritage. There is a different pupil in the secon- dary school. A goal is being set to in- clude all boys and girls up to the age of eighteen. The trend of the I.Q. average has been downward with the increase of population. Today those with an I.Q. of 100 are found less often than before. The college preparatory concept of the Secondary School is definitely obsolete. The tremendous economic and techno- logical barriers to successful vocational enterprise prevents any specific training in specific occupations. The trek to the city definitely means an urban centered youth. Young people claim their greatest problems are found in economic security, the need for vocational guidance, atten- tion to the problem of understanding how to choose a mate, how to adjust success- fully with people their own age, how to properly use their leisure time. Interest in biology will necessarily grow out of these interests and tensions found in the normal youth. The resolu- tion of these problems and the creation of programs for participation in activities which will clarify their position in the world cannot be secured by a return to the superimposition of intellectual sys- tems of scientific thought upon the already burdened mind. All the neces- sary principles of biology which have been conjured by biological scientists can be studied with a new orientation. The actual viewpoint must be different. Pupils must reserve life problems for scientific answers. The educator must begin with the problem of the pupil and eventuate in the understanding of the problem by a survey of biological facts and principles. If we can agree with Herbert S. Jen- nings in his "Universe and Life," that " the daily, the hourly, occupation of most organisms-high or low-is the seeking of conditions that are favorable for life and the avoiding of conditions that are unfavorable, " then the problems of youth will be respected and interpreted in the light of such a science.
