<plain_text><page sequence="1">CENTURY OF AMERICAN BIRDS Birds and Men: American Birds in Science, Art, Literature , and Conservation, 1800-1900 BY ROBERT HENRY WELKER The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press , Cambridge $5.75 the title of this work is "wondrous cum- brous," as a Greek professor of my acquaint- ance used to say of some freshman's awkward translation. The reader will find here simply a history of American ornithology; and thus en- titled, the fact that birds, men, and the items mentioned in the subtitle are involved might be safely left to inference. To be assured that modern ornithology had its origin in America gratifies the national pride and makes a significant addition to our list of "firsts." Really, most of us would have accepted the claim on less conclusive evidence continued on page 244 southwest Review xv</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books CONTINUED FROM PAGE XV than the author with painstaking scholarship has here amassed in its support. As Americans we enjoy the account of how Alexander Wil- son, our champion (imported, it is true) , put the pseudo ornithology of the world- renowned Buffon to rout. Even before our literary decla- ration of independence was promulgated in Emerson's "The American Scholar," Alexander Wilson was simply assuming world leadership in ornithology and maintaining it by sheer strength of common sense and by the unfalter- ing dedication of his life to the task. According to Welker, the principal contri- bution of Wilson lies in his break with super- stitution, folklore, and the age-old fallacy of interpreting bird behavior in terms of our own thoughts and emotions.1 Belknap's "hiber- nation" of swallows; Charlevoix's Canadian owls who capture mice, break their legs, feed and fatten for winter consumption; Du Pratz' summer tanager's hoarding maize to carry through periods of scarcity; blacksnakes charming catbirds; the magical origin of the Barnacle Goose - all these and many more shoddy sensationalisms were dissolved in the acid of Wilson's sarcasm. He also abominated sentimentality. He dared to debunk the sacred emblem of American prowess, even the bald eagle, saying bluntly that the bird ate carrion and was a notorious robber.2 Our hero also pokes fun at those who speak with ecstasy of the devotional wooing and cooing of the mourning doves. In short, Wilson insisted, as our author points out, on firsthand observations to replace the folderol which had masqueraded as ornithology in Eu- rope ever since Pliny's influence in natural history began to supersede that of Aristotle. "It is only by personal intimacy," Wilson de- clared, that we can truly ascertain the character of either men or birds, more particularly that of the feathered race; noting their particular haunts, modes of constructing their nests, man- ner of flight, seasons of migration, favorite foods, and numberless other minutiae . . . The quarrel between Alexander Wilson and John James Audubon, in which charges of plagiarisms, tergiversations, and bad sports- manship were hurled back and forth, is treated at some length with no evidence of judicial bias. Indeed, the famous feud along with an appraisal of the comparative merits of the re- spective feudists takes up about forty pages in the central portion of the book. That Audubon was the greater artist, Wilson the better man, 1 For incredible excesses of the school Wilson attacked, see They Tell of Birds , by Thomas P. Harrison (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1 956). 8 This observation is usually credited to Ben Franklin; but in ornithology, at least, Franklin was Wilson's pupil. 244 SUMMER 1957</page><page sequence="3">seems to be the verdict.3 Interest in this wrangle for Texas readers is not lessened by the fact that our whooping crane is one feature of it. The real villain of the record, according to Welker, is George Ord, Wilson's editor, who took his job so seriously that he sometimes substituted his own language for Wilson's, his own identifications, his own opinions; and fin- ally, in an excess of loyalty, tried vainly to har- monize contradictory statements into which Wilson was betrayed during the heat of the controversy. Summing up the joint influence of Wilson and Audubon on the development and direc- tion of American ornithology, the author re- marks that they "provided natural science with a vast amount of material for subsequent ex- tension, refinement and correction." In short, with the passing of these two great men, "whose impact on American culture was im- mediate and direct," the day of the specialist arrived. Henceforward, the taxonomist, the indexer, the scatologist, the cataloguer, the list- maker, and combinations of these specialties took over, and their work is not yet done. "In eloquent words and frequently beautiful paintings," Welker continues, these two men had shown America her own birds. . . . they had looked to nature seeking beauty, and had found it in abundance. Audu- bon had celebrated his devotion in the greatest bird paintings ever to appear outside the Ori- ent; Wilson had done the same in engaging prose and lyrical verse. In their work was the joy of discovery, the eloquence of love, to which others with the calling not of the scien- tist but of the writer were soon to respond. With the end of the Wilson-Audubon era many literary figures come into prominence as identified with American ornithology. Succes- 3 Collateral evidence touching Audubon's character may be found in the correspondence between John Keats and his brother, George, who complained of being crooked in a merchandising enterprise in Louisville, Kentucky, by one "Audubon," who is identified as John James Audubon by Sidney Colvin in Keats (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1887), p. 190. sive chapters in the book are devoted respec- tively to Thoreau, Burroughs, Emerson, and Whitman. Following are chapters which in- clude a whole crew of minors. The space herein devoted to literary men only casually interested in ornithology could hardly be justified but for the fact that they are credited with awakening a public interest in birds which broadened into the great conservation movement of the last decades of the nineteenth century. A parallel absorption of master-writers in England had, of course, its influence here, as noted by the author. Surely through the eyes and inspirations of Americans above noted, and through the eyes and inspirations of Burns, Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, along with Goethe and his followers on the Continent, the whole Western world beheld a new heaven and a new earth come into being. Our people be- came acutely sensitive to the importance of conserving for future generations at least a part of the original heritage which was ours in the golden time when we possessed ourselves of a virgin continent. A popular interest arising in a democracy soon becomes a political interest, and then the wheels of legislation begin turning. The rav- ages of the plume-hunters touched off a great wave of popular indignation. Societies for the protection of our natural resources sprang up all over the country, not only promoting ap- propriate legislation but backing up the execu- tive arm in its enforcement. First a comic stage- hit, the "bird on Nellie's hat" became a byword and a reproach. Even in the sensitive area of fashions in dress, women were driven into line in behalf of our beleaguered birds. Among the most amusing of the twenty-one full-page il- lustrations in this book are four plates exhibit- ing women's hats adorned with dead birds and fragments of dead birds reproduced from women's magazines dated from √ç883 to 1898. We find the consequences of this movement traced out in much informative detail. "The ornithologist is almost inevitably a conserva- SOUTHWEST Review 245</page><page sequence="4">tionist." Personally, I have never known one who wasn't. From the time of Jefferson birdmen were designated to accompany explorers. Nearly every expedition had its corps of scientific ob- servers and recorders; and their reports, exten- sively elaborated and magnificently illustrated, were published and distributed by the Smith- sonian Institution. The works of these explor- ing ornithologists (William Dunbar and George Hunter, away back in 1803; Charles Wilkes, John Cassin, and Stephen F. Baird, in mid-century; and W. H. Henshaw, in 1875) form a solid scientific extension of the Wilson- Audubon contributions, and equipped the lit- erary gentry with launching sites for some of their most effective publicity. American orni- thology became continental in scope and almost universal in interest. The usual "trickle down" process occurred. We find birds occupying positions of strength on lower and lower levels, which means wider and wider levels of popular interest - often, however, at the expense of a return to those elements which were so ferociously denounced by Alexander Wilson at the beginning of the century. How, for illustration, would Wilson have reacted to Lanier's sonnet to the mocking- bird, or to the anthropomorphic tenderness and literary cuddling of "our feathered friends" by Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, or even to Mabel Osgood Wright's work, which our author deli- cately describes as "occasionally too literary in approach or too overladen with sensibility"? Indeed, many influences looking toward larger and more inclusive conservation were operative at the close of the century. Among these the author selects, as exemplifying the cultural trend, "the Audubon people," who, he declares, were in a sense merely some thousands of Amer- icans joined in special groups to achieve par- ticular ends; but in another, broader sense, they were the inheritors and custodians of a great complex tradition of science and art and litera- ture, and of a tradition even older and deeper in human experience, the simple love of birds. Of course, the end is not yet, even now in 1957; but surely the period from Alexander Wilson to William T. Hornaday, embraced in this book, is one of continuous progress toward a more civilized view of birds in particular, of wildlife, and of the conservation of natural resources as a whole.
