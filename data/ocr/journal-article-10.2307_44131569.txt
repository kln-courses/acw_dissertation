<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRÜCKE PRIMITIVISM: THE EARLY FIGURATIVE WOODCUTS by Philip Larson For most American print-lovers, Brücke art means the angular figure with the masklike face. This is the mark of first generation German expressionism that reads from across the room. The artists of the Brücke group arrived at their characteristic manner after several years of drawing curvilinear nudes after Munch and Matisse. Few of these early works are in the United States. Subsequently, their own primitive style provided them with an insul ative bond that headed off foreign influence and affirmed group solidarity. Historians have long as- sumed Kirchner invented this figurai type, perhaps in partnership with Heckel . But the precise genesis of this most famous of all German expressionist images has been clouded by guesswork. Also assumed has been the role of African sculpture in the Brücke primitivisiri. But now it can be shown that drawing from life, rather than cribbing from ethnographic art, was far more critical for generating works in the new style. The drawings, prints, and paint- ings by Kirchner and Heckel that effected the breakaway have been canonized by textbook histories of the period, Heckel's Standing Child attaining rank as expres- sionist icon. These works hide a rich variety of sources and symbols that have never been precisely pinned down. In my dissertation (Columbia University, 1970, unpublished), sequences of preparatory drawings illustrate the origins of Brücke primitivism. Some of the material is recast here. During the summer of 1901 Kirchner and Heckel drew great numbers of abbreviated, sketchy figure studies. These became the basis for their new figure style. To kick old studio habits, Kirchner and Heckel left Dresden for the out of doors, the shores of Lake Moritzburg, where for the first time they tried to capture the nude model in motion. Observing the figure running in and out of the water, romping through the reedy shallows, or tugging at the companion in play, Kirchner sketched rapid-fire, then attempted to transfer the energized, outlined design to woodblock. The princi- pal document of this is Kirchner's Four Bathers, a masterprint from the 1910 Brücke portfolio. The drawing closely fol- lows a postcard drawing in the Altonaer Museum, Hamburg, postmarked Dresden- Altenstädt, 6 September 1909. This reed- pen preparatory sketch is the precise reverse of the woodcut design; its early postmark indicates Kirchner arrived at the new figure style a few months before he began to take seriously the African sculptures in the Dresden Ethnological Museum. The tight angles and V-shaped formations in the figures are not contingent on any reading of African sculpture but are wholly a result of Kirchner's woodcutting, a style that he consciously modified to imitate his erratic reedpen drawing. Even the orange crayon areas in the drawing are translated into the woodcut, there rendered by a separate block printed over the initial black. That Kirch- ner's "primitive" woodcut style was a logical result of his life drawing style is seen again in Bathing Pair, another Moritzburg wood- cut in the 1910 Brücke portfolio. In every essential detail, the print derives from a free-wheeling charcoal drawing in the Graf von der Goltz Collection. The sketch for Bathing Pair was made from life. It also evidences a certain admira- tion for Matisse's contemporary figure style. Matisse's peculiar use of single, broken lines to define body masses and his preference for pressing the figure into flattened profile or back view are features Kirchner adopted to his own ends in his 1909 Moritzburg bather pictures. Kirchner's integrating these figurai shapes with analogous background forms is a formalizing approach Matisse had been onto for some time. The Brücke's primitive figure style not only signals the rise of a new German modernism but participates in a Continental style in which national sensi- bilities flirt but never marry. Basic philo- sophical differences between Kirchner and the Fauves keep their expressions at arm's length from each other - one reason Kirch- ner eventually gave up his curvilinear, Matisse-like figure style for a harshly an- gular, more Germanically expressive re- formation of the nude. Always as close to nature as to the ab- stracting tendencies of art, Kirchner saw the nude outdoors in a more traditionally romantic vein, as an expression of sexual display and free spirit. This is why he fre- quently gave his outdoor bather scenes a dancelike organization. Figures align in rows, dogpaddle with their hands or stride in parallel ranks, much like the cabaret (Left) Erich Heckel, Standing Girl, pencil (47x37 cm), 1910.

Kirchner elevated the dance of nature to a universal symbol of life, and all Brücke members worked variations on the theme for years. The dance was also a favorite subject with Parisian painters, but a psychological gulf divides French and German versions. Matisse's dance compo- sitions are motivated by formal, even dec- orative rhythms that give new life to the old French arabesque; Kirchner's dance pic- tures are enlivened by a mystic procreative urge bonding naked man to earth: Matisse loved Arabic calligraphy; Kirchner loved Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. After their summer stay in the Lake Moritzburg region, Kirchner and Heckel returned to Dresden and immediately in- corporated their new figure style into studio compositions. To create an indoor environ- ment as lush and exotic as Moritzburg, they decorated their two adjacent workrooms with painted wall -hangings, carved furni- ture, and assorted sculptures in a pseudo- African or pseudo- Polynesian vein. These homemade, gaudy objects provided stri- dent background for the Brücke's most original figurative work. Regrettably, only a few small carved pieces survive from this environmental project. We must rely almost entirely on drawings and illustrated post- cards to reconstruct what must have been an interior as richly exotic as Gauguin's South Seas studio. Kirchner's carved mirror frames, chieftain's stools, and high-backed, anthropomorphic chairs appear as theatri- cal props for his famous paintings of primi- tive nudes, such as Marcella in the Stock- holm Moderna Museet and Franzi in Carved Chair in the Baron Thyssen Collection. Heckel's favorite backdrop was his long wall-painting depicting nudes bathing before undulating hills. A section of this hanging appears in his colored woodcut Standing Child, one of the artist's most convincing attempts at primitivizing the nude. Heckel's Standing Child makes a good test case of what Brücke primitivism is about. Like most of his studio woodcuts, it derives from a very spare life drawing. Heckel took as his central task the trans- lating of a quick outline study into a rela- tively unyielding woodblock design, and it is important to note drawing-like characteris- tics in the print. The point might seem ob- vious, but much has been written about the woody characteristics of the block influenc- ing the Brücke's characteristic angular woodcut style, when, in fact, the style was more a product of drawing, therefore more of sight and mind. Important to how Heckel saw the figure in Standing Child was how he saw his previous Moritzburg work. The com- position is somewhat unusual for Heckel, since it also depends on how he saw a partic- ular Congo figure type. In 19th-century carvings by the Mbole tribe, solutions for dramatically outlining the facial features seem almost readymade for Heckel's tightly contoured drawing style. The heart-shaped face, slit eyes, hourglass nose, and grossly exaggerated navel are borrowed from the Mbole type; the V-like rendering of the breasts, the union of hand with thigh, and the pressing of the figure into the back- ground mural are taken from the sketch alone. Central to Heckel's primitive conception in Standing Child is retention of personal identity. This is no African deity. The sitter is recognizably Franzi, an orphan girl in- formally adopted by the Brücke as model and companion. She often appears with her sister Marcella in Heckel's and Kirchner's first primitive works. Psychologically, Standing Child has the personable life and breath of portraiture in the Western Euro- pean tradition. Fränzi's features betray the influence of African carving, born as it is from mythic belief, but she remains Franzi - a particular girl with a particular smile. Her brazen, adolescent sexuality was a shocker for the German public of the time, even though Munch had previously intro- duced similar themes. Fränzi's masklike face makes her nudity the more blatant and gives her an aura of ceremony, as if some pub- escent rite were in the offing. The primitive figure style provided a com- mon bond between the Brücke artists for several years. Most important expression of this communal style is a group of outdoor bather pictures Kirchner, Heckel, and Pechstein produced in the summer of 1910 at Lake Moritzburg. Here compositional formats, typically setting frontal figures against a lakeshore background, pass from artist to artist, and it takes an expert to sort out stylistic differences. Franzi and Mar- cella are major dramatis personae in most of these pictures, prancing through the grass or exhibiting themselves squarely. The reedy shores of Lake Moritzburg and the confines of the Brücke's Dresden studio become the outside and inside of the same escapist world. When the Brücke moved to Berlin in late 1911, Heckel attempted to construct a second exotic environment, but by then the richness of the idea had worn a little thin. He painted tentlike curtains and wall -hang- ings and carved a few foot-high figures, and when he met Kirchner at Fehmarn Island in the summer of 1912, he attempted to graft his own neo-African woodcarving style onto bathers out of doors. The results were not always as lively as his earlier Mor- itzburg work. But the following winter Heckel retreated into his own Berlin studio and skillfully incorporated primitivist carv- ings and tapestries into such expressionist masterpieces as the triptych Convalescent Woman, in the Busch- Reisinger Museum. In this work Heckel formulates a highly personal symbolism. Primitive accessories amplify a mood of quiet, sometimes sad reflection. His Berlin pictures are far from the exuberant physicality of the Brücke's earlier group style, and after the group broke up in 1913, each artist pursued his own private vision. Brücke primitivism was an amalgam of separable components that find most power- ful expression in the 1909-11 pictures. Faces inspired by African masks, backdrops sug- gestive of Polynesia, and sharply angular figurai style can all rightly be called prim- itive, as can the evocation of a primordial state of man. For the Brücke artists, the primitivism in their art was not simply some- thing to paint - it was something to believe in. In 1910 they attempted to spread this gospel by releasing to Brücke patrons a port- folio of Kirchner's Moritzburg prints. When the group moved to Berlin, they sought to have their drawings and graphics repro- duced in Der Sturm, an underground broadsheet dedicated to expressionism in all the arts. Schmidt- Rottluff designed woodcuts for the journal - his Two Nudes appeared on the cover of a 1914 issue. By then, however, Brücke expressionism had lost its relevance as a radical force. The war swept away the Utopian joy of first-genera- Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Bathing Pair, woodcut (19.5x28.5 cm), 1910. 159</page><page sequence="3">tion expressionism, and after the war, a more tortured, more literary expression gained prominence, as artists like Max Beckmann made drama and autobiography into art.
