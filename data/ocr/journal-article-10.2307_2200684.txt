<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHARTER OF ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES AND THE DEPRIVATION OF FOREIGN-OWNED WEALTH By Burns H. Weston* I n a parable drawn from The Trial, Franz Kafka once etched the following chilling profile: Before the Law stands a doorkeeper on guard. To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. "It is possible," answers the doorkeeper, "but not at this moment." Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the doorkeeper sees that, he laughs and says: "If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other. Even the third of these has an aspect that even I cannot bear to look at." These are difficulties which the man from the country had not expected to meet; the Law, he thinks, should be accessible to every man at all times .... ~ The message of this parable is fundamental, I believe, to a proper under- standing of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States,2 adopted by the UN General Assembly by an overwhelming vote of 120 to 6 with 10 abstentions in December 1974 as a centerpiece of what has come to be called the "New International Economic Order" (NIEO). Signaling the end of complete Northern hegemony and the emergence of a new inter- dependence of power and wealth, this NIEO Charter raises fundamental questions about what is fair and just, quintessentially legal and moral ques- tions that, in Ali Mazrui's well-chosen words, mirror a Third World "caught between the indignity of charity and the ambition of economic justice."s It is from this general perspective that one should approach Article 2 of the NIEO Charter and, in particular, it subparagraph 2(c),4 which purports to affect the Law of State Responsibility as it impinges upon the nationaliza- * of the Board of Editors. This article was adapted from a paper prepared for the Study Panel on State Responsibility of the American Society of International Law. ~ F.

Every State has and shall freely exercise full permanent sovereignty, including possession, use and disposal, over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities. 2. Each State has the right: (a) To regulate and exercise authority over foreign investment within its national jurisdiction in accordance with its laws and regulations and in conformity with its national objectives and priorities. No State shall be compelled to grant preferential treatment to foreign investment; (b) To regulate and supervise the activities of transnational corpora- tions within its national jurisdiction and take measures to ensure that such activities comply with its laws, rules and regulations and conform with its economic and social policies, Transnational corporations shall not intervene in the internal affairs of a host State. Every State should, with full regard for its sovereign rights, co-operate with other States in the exercise of the right set forth in this subparagraph; (c) To nationalize, expropriate or transfer ownership of foreign property in which case appropriate compensation should be paid by the State adopting such measures, taking into account its relevant laws and regulations and all circumstances that the State considers pertinent. In any case where the question of compensation gives rise to a con- troversy, it shall be settled under the domestic law of the nationalizing State and by its tribunals, unless it is freely and mutually agreed by all States concerned that other peaceful means be sought on the basis of the sovereign equality of States and in accordance with the principle of free choice of means.s A break from the past seems clear. The so-called public purpose (or public utility) doctrine is disregarded. The "doctrine of alien nondiscrimination" s The term "wealth deprivation" and such derivatives as "deprivation measure" and "deprivation claim" are used principally to avoid the simultaneous and, hence, ambiguous reference to both facts and legal consequences that so often characterizes the more popular "expropriation," "confiscation," "condemnation," "taking," "forfeiture," and the like. It is there- fore conceived as a neutral expression that describes the public or publicly sanctioned imposition of a wealth loss (or blocking of a wealth gain)mat whatever time, by whatever means, with whatever intensity,' and for whatever claimed purpose--which, in the absence of some further act on the part of the depriving party, would involve the denial of a quid pro quo to the party who sustains the deprivation (the component "wealth" usually being preferred to the more popular "property" because it refers to all the relevant values of goods, services, and income without sharing the latter's common emphasis upon physical attributes or the civil law's stress on "ownership"). Depending on a multitude of factual variables, a wealth deprivation may be found lawful or unlawful. As implied and as thus defined, however, the term is superior in ways other than its descriptive neutrality. By stressing more the results than the implementing procedures of the institution, it underscores the ultimate gravamen to which all claims arising out of any social interaction are addressed: value change. At the same time, but without straint of legal-technical language, it affords a broad mantle under which a variety of procedures may take shelter, whether the archetypal "direct taking" or its many "indirect" functional equivalents. Finally, it more readily admits that there can be a loss by one party without there being a one-for-one gain by another. 6 See note 2 supra.</page><page sequence="3">1981] NIEO CHARTER AND FOREIGN WEALTH DEPRIVATION 439 is ignored. And the much heralded international law principle of compensa- tion appears to be "domesticated," i.e., rejected as an international regulatory norm. Provoking not a little consternation and complaint among capital- exporting constituencies,7 the provision is a vivid demonstration, even if primarily a symbolic one,s of the central NIEO demand for restructured perspectives and patterns of international economic order, as most recently, albeit rather ineffectually, evidenced by the General Assembly's 11th Special Session on international development issues (which anticipated the up- coming "global negotiations" on international cooperation and development). A preliminary reassessment of the issues fundamentally at stake in this discrete realm therefore seems needed. Accordingly, I shall proceed first and briefly with the failure of Article 2 to incorporate the "public purpose" and alien nondiscrimination doctrines, and then shall consider in some detail two questions that I believe must be asked about the compensation issue which Article 2 does address: '~ 1) whether Article 2(2)(d) is or is not an authoritative statement of existing international law (lex lata); and (2), assuming arguendo a negative answer to the first issue, whether Article 2(2) (c) should or should not be recognized as an authoritative statement of international law (de lege ferenda). The key issues thus may be seen to divide between law and policy. I. ARTICLE 2 AND THE PUBLIC PURPOSE DOCTRINE It is neither surprising nor shocking that Article 2 omits mention of the public purpose doctrine, i.e., the contention that foreign property, rights, and interests cannot be "taken" except for reasons of public necessity or utility? Although early declared by Grotius to be a limitation upon a sovereign's power of eminent domain,~? and while understandably in- corporated into many domestic systems to_ protect against executive and legislative abuse,TM the doctrine has found scant support in practice as a "rule" of international law whose violation independently engages inter- national responsibility.x" Research has yet to reveal any international legal ? Voting against the NIEO Charter, in significant part because of Article 2, were Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Abstaining were Austria, Canada, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and Spain. The U.S. vote against the Charter was in accordance with American Bar Association Resolution No. 301, adopted at the Association's annual meeting in August 1974, and reproduced in 9 INT'L LAW. 405 (1975).

Moreover, no matter what legal effect one may ascribe to the NIEO Charter,~6 it is amply reinforced not only by Article 2, but also by many of the remaining Charter provisions which similarly favor un- fettered economic sovereignty as a basis for ordering international economic affairs.~7 The point is not that foreign-wealth deprivations should not be taken in the public interest, but, as Hans Baade has observed, in "whose public interest, as determined by Whom."~s II. ARTICLE 2 AND THE ALIEN NONDISCRIMINATION DOCTRINE For all its disabilities, the so-called public purpose doctrine does serve nevertheless to remind us that what or why something is wanted commonly conditions both our perspectives about the permissibility of given initiatives and the correctness of individual and group responses to them.~9 So basic is In the Walter Fletcher Smith Claim (United States v. Cuba), 2 R. Int'l Arb. Awards 913 (1929), the arbitrator found that "the expropriation proceedings were not, in good faith, for the purpose of public utility." To like effect, see the Oscar Chinn Case, [1934] PCIJ, ser. A/B, No. 63, at 75; El Triunfo Case (United States v. El Salvador), FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, 1902, at 838 (1903); The Savage Claim (United States v. El Salvador), 2 J. B. MOORE, INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATIONS 1865 (1898). In none of these cases, however, was the "public utility" concept explored, nor did any of them turn on the absence of "public utility" alone. 14 GA Res. 1803 (XVII), 17 UN GAOR, Supp. (No. 17) 15, UN Doc. A/5217 .(1962), reprinted in 57 AJIL 710 (1963), 2 ILM 223 (1963): "Nationalization, expropriation or requisitioning shall be based on grounds or reasons of public utility, security or the national interest which are recognized as overriding purely individual or private interests, both domestic and foreign." But see Baade, Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Wealth and Resources, in ESSAYS ON EXPROPRIATIONS 3, 23 (R. Miller &amp; R. Stanger eds. 1967): "This [provision] would ap- pear to be an attempt to diminish, rather than to increase, international-law restrictions upon nationalization by making the precedence of public over private interests a matter of international public policy." 15 Although the requirement that the taking of an alien's property be for a public purpose --or be based on reasons of public necessity or public utility--is frequently mentioned in international adjudications and the works of text writers, there is little authority in inter- national law establishing any useful criteria by which a state's own determination of public purpose can be questioned. There appear to be few, if any, cases in which a taking has been held unlawful under international law on the sole and specific ground that it was not for a public purpose.

Long honored in customary practice, judicial decisions, and treaty law,21 this doctrine may now be a matter of jus cogens--part of a "newly emerged general norm of nondis- crimination which seeks to forbid all generic differentiations among people ? . . for reasons irrelevant to individual capabilities and contribution"-- so that its omission would not prejudice the resolution of controversies arising under Article 2. A distinct problem is, however, that Article 2(2) (a) is quick to provide that "[n]o State shall be compelled to grant preferential treatment to foreign investment" the Calvo Doctrine reincarnate--and without "even . . . a genuflection" to "the natural corollary of nondiscrimination," as pointed out by Brower and Tepe.~4 Indeed, given that Article 2(2) (c), by referring only to "foreign property," implicitly authorizes a state to exempt its own :?This contention is supported by two interpretations of the doctrine of alien non- discrimination: the so-called national treatment standard and the so-called minimum standard of international justice. The first calls for equal treatment as between aliens and nationals, and the second for a certain de minimus treatment of aliens irrespective of the treatment ac- corded nationals. For details, see authorities cited in notes 21 and 23 infra. :1 For discussion and abundant references, see G. WHITE., supra note 11, at 5, 119-50; M. McDOUGAL, H. LASSWELL, &amp; L.

LASSWELL, &amp; L. CHEN, supra note 21, at 738 (footnote omitted). In the Oscar Chinn case ([1934] PCIJ, ser. A/B, No. 63, at 87), the Permanent Court of Interna- tional Justice voiced the kind of discrimination that is said to be prohibited: "The form of discrimination which is forbidden is . . . discrimination based upon nationality and involving differential treatment by reason of their nationality as between persons belonging to different national groups." Gillian White correctly points out that "the court was interpreting the prohibition of discrimination contained in the Convention of Saint-Germain and the word 'forbidden' clearly refers to this prohibition and not to a general principle of customary international law." G. WHITE., supra note 11, at 34. Considering the growth of international human rights law since the 1934 Oscar Chinn case, however, it probably is true that the Per- manent Court's language now has more generic significance. :s The Calvo Doctrine maintains that aliens are not entitled to rights and privileges not ac- corded to nationals, and that therefore they may seek redress for grievances only before local authorities." D. SHEA, THE CALVO CLAUSE 19 (1955). This doctrine, which embodies the so- called national treatment standard of alien nondiscrimination (long favored in Latin American circles), is criticized as it pertains to the NIEO Charter by Lillich, The Diplomatic Protection of Nationals Abroad: An Elementary Principle of International Law Under Attack, 69 AJIL 359 (1975). For sympathetic treatment of the doctrine in the same context, see GarcIa-Amador, The Proposed New International Economic Order: A New Approach to the Law Governing Nationaliza- tion and Compensation, 12 LAW. AMERICAS 1, 25 (1980). For extensive but dated analysis of the competing "minimum standard of international justice," which rejects the Calvo Doctrine and its constituent "national treatment standard," see A.

Additionally, despite the repeated deference in the NIEO Charter to such principles as "common interest and co-operation," "equal rights," "equity," "respect for human rights and fundamental feedoms," and "social justice," other provisions that do invoke the language of nondiscrimination do so, similarly, not to guard against but to widen governmental power in order to give priority to what will aid the less-developed countries (LDC's).~'5 A more direct challenge to the doctrine of alien nondiscrimination as traditionally conceived in the context of foreign-wealth deprivation (at least outside Latin America) is thus hard to imagine? Considering the historical inspiration and principal authorship of the NIEO Charter, this manifestly one-sided approach is of course not difficult to fathom.~7 However, it does raise a complex of difficult questions that beg for objective analysis. Without attempting any definitive answers here-- answers that only an extended and much needed dissertation can supply let us consider briefly what some of these might be. Take the "simplest" case first. Putting aside qualifying treaty commit- ments (which would appear guaranteed by chapter I of the NIEO Charter),~'9 it seems proper to conclude, as did Gillian White over a decade ago, that "It]here is as yet no rule of international law which provides that a State is guilty of illegal discrimination if it nationalises alien property in a field where there are no national interests capable of being affected."a? The concept of discrimination meaning or implying choice, this conclusion is logical. More importantly, it is wise. In Baade's words: 25 Accord, Garcia-Amador, supra note 23, at 27-28. See, e.g., the Preamble and Arts. 4, 16, 18, 19, and 26 of the NIEO Charter, note 2 supra. ~6 On this point, see Lillich, note 23 supra. See also Brower &amp; Tepe, note 24 supra. ~7 For a not overly charitable but nonetheless accurate explanation, see M. McDOUGAL, H. LASSWELL, &amp; L. CHEN, supra note 21, at 777. ~~ McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen recently have completed a detailed elaboration of the general norm of nondiscrimination. See id., pt. III. However, only chapter 14 of this volume deals with the doctrine of alien nondiscrimination per se, and then with but limited reference to the relatively discrete context of foreign-wealth deprivation. Additionally, such other major and widely cited works as are pertinent to this realm tend to be dated and Western inspired. See, e.g., E. BORCHARD, THE DIPLOMATIC PROTECTION OF CITIZENS ABROAD OR THE LAW OF INTERNATIONAL CLAIMS (1915); F. DUNN, THE PROTECTION OF NATIONALS (1932); C. EAGLETON, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (1928); G. FOUILILOUX, LA NATIONALISATION ET LE DROIT INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC (1962); A. FREEMAN, THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES FOR DENIAL OF JUSTICE (1938); S. FRIEDMAN, EXPROPRIATION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (1953); A. ROTH, note 23 supra; D. SHEA, note 23 supra; G. WHITE, note 11 supra;l and B. WORTLEY, note 9 supra. ~-9 Chapter i of the NIEO Charter, note 2 supra, includes among its "fundamentals of international economic relations" the principle of "[f]ulfilment in good faith of international obligations." According to Sole Arbitrator Rene-Jean Dupuy, in the international arbitration of Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co./California Asiatic Oil Co. v. Libyan Arab Republic Award on the Merits, reprinted in 17 ILM 3, 31 (1978), this language applies to concession agreements. a0 G. WHITE, supra note 11, at 144.</page><page sequence="7">1981] NIEO CHARTER AND FOREIGN WEALTH DEPRIVATION 443 [N]ationalizations in many underdeveloped countries with few major natural resources tend to be discriminatory by the mere force of circumstances, because the natural resource that is nationalized is exclusively in the control of enterprises belonging to one foreign power, frequently, though not necessarily, the former colonial power .... If it is urged that even such discriminations are to be proscribed, the purpose of the asserted rule becomes clear. It is not envisaged as an enumeration of the conditions of the legality of nationalizations, but [as] an attempt to insulate one of the most important areas of inter- national investment from nationalization completely. It is, in other words, an attempt to substitute the restrictions of international law for the restraints previously imposed by colonialism and gunboat diplomacy.s~ In a world that can ill afford losing anyone's respect for the rule of law, these opinions are prudent? Yet troublesome questions arise even in this simplest ("no national interests") case. For example, what if more than one alien interest is capable of being affected? In the absence of indigenous targets, are deprivation- prone elites free to discriminate among resident aliens willy-nilly? Or what if a "nationalization" or "expropriation" of one or more alien interests is done in whole or in part for reasons of retaliation or reprisal? Leaving aside the desirability or propriety of infusing the alien nondiscrimination doctrine with the concepts of retaliation and reprisal,as are past trends opposing such actions, along with carefully nurtured principles of proportionality, to be disregarded because only alien interests are at hand? Of course, these questions tend toward the rhetorical as posed, suggesting negative answers. However, recast to call up complementary issues of fact and policy i.e., are all discriminations among and between aliens unlawful? are all retaliatory deprivations against aliens impermissible--they recommend extreme caution. The same can be said of these and related questions in the more heterogeneous context where there are also national interests capable of being affected. For example, in the initial matter of determining who among existent national and alien proprietors shall be subjected to deprivation, is it lawful or unlawful to single out an alien interest on any one or more of the following (illustrative) grounds: (1) that, as an actual or perceived agent of a foreign power or as an unwanted reminder of colonial or imperialistic association, the alien interest inhibits true foreign policy independence? a~ Baade, supra note 14, at 24-25. s2 But see Herz, Expropriation of Foreign Property, 35 AJIL 243,249 (1941): "Non-discrimina- tion has formed the basis of all those claims where measures had been directed against single foreigners. I t does not matter whether the discrimination is open or veiled, if only there is evidence that in its effects the measure affects practically aliens alone." as For a brief discussion of the joinder of these concepts with the doctrine of alien non- discrimination, see Dawson &amp; Weston, supra note 12, at 84-96. an On the doctrine of proportionality in the context of retaliation and reprisal, see the widely cited Naulilaa Case, 8 Trib. Arb. Mixtes 409 (1928). For a more recent statement, see Bowett, Economic Coercion and Reprisals by States, in ECONOMIC COERCION AND THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER 7 (R.

(3) that, in contrast to competing national or alien interests to whom the host government might be obligated, it cannot lay claim to express or implied contractual promises not to deprive? or (4) that, concession agreement or not, it monopolizes, otherwise dominates, or disproportionately exploits a particular resource or field? Similarly, as regards the eventual matter of determining which of the targeted national or alien interests shall be entitled to what compensation (if any), do not one or all of these and possibly other kinds of discriminations have some appropriately differentiating role to play? My point is this: whatever the disabilities of the NIEO Charter in general, and of Article 2 in particular, it is difficult to accept categorically the following conclusions reached by White some years ago: (1) that "[m]easures which are aimed exclusively at alien-owned property in a field where there are also national interests constitute illegal discrimination" (2) that "[m]easures which are general in scope but which single out ? . . [alien] property . . . for unfavourable treatment (usually in the matter of payment of compensation) constitute a breach of the [alien nondiscrimination] rule unless there is justification for such treatment in treaty provisions."a? These conclusions, I submit, are too facile? Additionally, they risk a questionable ethnocentricity. In Tom Farer's words: Latin American governments and scholars [have] consistently urged the view that international law require[s] nothing more than the equality of treatment for indigenous and foreign investors. Yet, although they [have] pulled all the right buttons on the international legal console and pedaled vigorously, they might as well have been silent for all the effect they [have] had on the views expounded in Western universities and chancelleries or, for that matter, on the gunboats and marines dis- patched periodically to enforce the "law."a9 Echoing Baade on the simplest ("no national interests") case,4? this expres- sion, too, is prudent warning. a5 For further and approving elaboration on this theme, see Dawson &amp; Weston, "Prompt, Adequate and Effective": A Universal Standard of Compensation?, 30 FORDHAM L.

I hasten to add, though, that one must start from the oft- neglected truism that discrimination is not per se unlawful or bad; indeed, no unqualified doctrine of nondiscrimination could be constituted par of customary international law without sacrificing important community values? McDougal, Lasswell, and Chen (concerned to banish all discrimina- tions "irrelevant of individual capabilities and contribution"42) usefully counsel in this way: "whether a particular differentiation of aliens and nationals has a reasonable basis in the common interest of the larger com- munity must . . . depend not only upon the value primarily at stake in the differentiation but also upon many particular, and varying, features of the context in which the differentiation is made."4a Of course, to avoid tipping the balance too much in one direction, one should counsel further that the same holds true for any particular nondifferentiation of aliens and nationals also; nondifferentiations, too, if they are to have "a reasonable basis in the common interest," must be seen to depend upon the complexities of fact and policy to which the Yale scholars refer. Yet, regrettably, these counsels tend to fall on deaf ears. Many of the NIEO Charter's enthusiasts (quick to bypass the doctrine of alien nondiscrimination in quest of largely unrestricted "self- determination"), as well as many of its opponents (slow to concede any system change lest access to resources and profit margins be reduced), often choose to ignore these complexities and consequently render the attendant ambiguities moot. However, for all that one may appeal for heightened fact/policy sensitivity on all sides, there is at least one aspect of the doctrine of alien nondiscrimina- tion that in principle should not be open to debate. Actually, it is central to heightened fact/policy sensitivity, the diacritical skein that winds through all the questions raised so far. I refer to the concept of arbitrariness, praised by Orrego Vicuna as a "profound moral judgment about what is just and unjust."44 Whether the question is to determine which alien interest shall be subjected to deprivation, or to decide who shall receive what compensation therefor (if any), or to evaluate the procedures for reaching these determinations and decisions (this last issue being one we associate with "denial of justice" claims),45 it cannot must not be answered arbitrarily 41 Otherwise, how does one defend, for example, the "most-favored-nation" provisions of commercial and other treaties? On this point, see Baade, supra note 14, at 23-24. See also M. MCDOUGAL, H. LASSWELL, &amp; L. CHEN, supra note 21, at 756, who, in seeking to demonstrate "an overall commitment to a minimum international standard," contend that "It]he standards established in many of these [FCN] treaties often go beyond national treatment in relation to particular problems, most notably in the form of `most-favored-nation treatment.'" 42 Supra note 21, at 738. 4a Id. at 758 n.82. 44 Orrego Vicuna, Some International Law Problems Posed by the Nationalization of the Copper Industry by Chile, 67 AJIL 711, 715 (1973).

FREEMAN, supra note 28, at 517, who contends that international law limits a state's right to deprive aliens of their wealth "by arbitrary action, whether . . . directed against foreigners as such or against the populace as a whole under general legislation." 4~ The "denial of justice" concept, though important to the notion of arbitrariness, might best be left as a juridical variable in its own right, not to complicate further an already complex</page><page sequence="10">446 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 75 (i.e., capriciously or without reasons sanctioned by the common interest of an increasingly interdependent and interpenetrating world community). To be sure, left unrefined, the concept of arbitrariness does not augment legal certainty. As Cornelius Murphy has observed, "Arbitrariness is not a self- evident norm from which, through a process of deduction, one can make judgments about specific controversies."46 What is just and fair (i.e., non- arbitrary) discrimination is a question that is capable of final solution only by reference to the discrete fact/policy context (a point well understood by American constitutional lawyers even as they invoke the so-called strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis tests to prove or disprove a "compelling State interest," a "substantial State interest," or "administrative convenience" in race, sex, and alienage discrimination cases). And, even then, given that people (decision makers) unconsciously arrange what they secretly desire, it is a matter of interpretation. For example, the two lower United States courts in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino held the 1960 Cuban takeovers of North American sugar interests to be unlawfully "dis- criminatory"47 notwithstanding their having been undertaken in retaliation for what Cuba avowedly considered, not without some justification, acts of illegal economic aggression.48 To quote Murphy again, "An impartial tribunal, taking that circumstance into consideration, [might] have reached a different conclusion."4" Nevertheless, considering the many authoritative human rights formula- tions and practices that have followed upon the UN Charter and the alien nondiscrimination doctrine. Such a conclusion is inferred, at any rate, from F. GARCIA- AMADOR, L. SOHN, &amp; R. BAXTER, RECENT CODIFICATION OF THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURIES TO ALIENS 180 (1974): This term [denial of justice] has in the past been used in at least three different senses. In its broadest sense, this term seems to embrace the whole field of State responsibility, and has been applied to all types of wrongful conduct on the part of the State toward aliens. In its narrowest sense, this term has been limited to refusal of a State to grant an alien access to its courts or a failure of a court to pronounce a judgment. In an intermediate sense, the expression "denial of justice" is employed in connection with the improper administration of civil and criminal justice as regards an alien, including denial of ac- cess to courts, inadequate procedures, and unjust decisions. The last appears to be the most apposite usage, since the term may thus be usefully employed to describe a particular type of international wrong for which no other adequate phrase exists in the language of the law. On "denial of justice" generally, see, e.g., Eagleton, Denial of Justice in International Law, 22 AJIL 538 (1928); Fitzmaurice, The Meaning of the Term "Denial of Justice," 13 BRIT. Y.B. INT'L L. 93 (1932); and Lissitzyn, The Meaning of Denial of Justice in International Law, 30 AJIL 632 (1936). 46 Murphy, Limitations Upon the Power of a State to Determine the Amount of Compensation Payable to an Alien Upon Nationalization, in 3 THE VALUATION OF NATIONALIZED PROPERTY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 49, 59 (1975). 47 Banco Nacional de Cuba v.

Indeed, if there is any basis, in the context of foreign-wealth deprivation, for maintaining that the doctrine of alien nondiscrimination has achieved jus cogens stature, it is in this realm of "simple human respect," of such general acceptance as to challenge even the most zealous advocate of the NIEO Charter. On the other hand, given the yet fragile state of the global human rights system, and taking into account the NIEO Charter's understandable (but, I submit, myopic) rejection of the principle of diplomatic protection (as most vividly seen in Article 2), even a modest gesture in opposition to arbitrary discrimination would have been salutary. The point is not, per the "minimum standard of international justice," that aliens always should be treated prima facie more favorably than nationals regarding who shall be deprived or compensated for what (nor, indeed, per the "equal treatment standard," that aliens always should be treated no more favorably than nationals). The point is, rather, that no one, not even depriving state nationals, should be deprived of her or his wealth arbitrarily--that is, without some reasonable justification in terms of, say, per United States constitutional law for example, a "compelling State interest," a "substantial State interest," or even mere "administrative convenience." Incorporating the Calvo Doctrine without qualification, and hence disregarding the potential capriciousness of all domestic systems (including so-called civilized ones), Article 2 grossly underestimates the importance of this value and thereby does unwitting disservice even to the Third World interests it was intended to help. The history of exploitation prompting its formulation and adoption is perfectly clear; but generalized southern suspicion of the North is no less dysfunctional than generalized Northern ethnocentrism vis-a-vis the South. In Richard Lillich's words: [W]hile it is true that "the ideas of justice and fair dealing incorporated in the accepted norms of conduct for European nations were carried over into the wider sphere of the international society of the nineteenth century," there is no need to apologize for attempting to establish a universal consensus behind justice and fair dealing? 50 This conclusion finds support in post-World War II lump sum settlement practice. See 1 R. LILLICH &amp; B. WESTON , supra note 12, at 138. To avoid possible misinterpretation, however, it is important to note that it is stated only with reference to the deprivation, in contrast to the exclusion, of foreign-owned property rights and interests. Most countries (including the United States) disallow foreign nationals from participating in certain economic activities and sectors, and the LDC's especially give preferential treatment to local entrepreneurs desir- ing entry into the economic marketplace. Such discriminations, it may be said, are not deemed ipso facto impermissible. See, e.g., M. MCDOUGAL, H. LASSWELL, 8c L. CHEN, supra note 21, at 737-78. In other words, the conclusion extends only to postinvestment-- not preinvestment circumstances, i.e., to the deprivation of rights that already have "vested." 5!

ARTICLE 2 AND THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPENSATION We come now to subparagraph 2(c) of Article 2 and its seeming repudia- tion of the principle of compensation as an international regulatory norm in the foreign-wealth deprivation context. To appreciate its full import, it should be seen against General Assembly Resolution 1803 (XVII) on Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, adopted in 1962.~: In cases of "nationaliiation, expropriation or requisitioning," the 1962 resolution provided, "the owner shall be paid appropriate compensation, in accordance with the rules in force in the State taking such measures in the exercise of its sovereignty and in accordance with international law."~a For the next decade at least, this formulation was regarded generally, among developed and developing nations alike, as a reasonably accurate reflection of customary international law.~4 Article 2(2), (c), however, reflecting grow- ing Third World dissent from the international compensation principle at least as articulated by the liberal West, does not follow suit. While also providing for "appropriate compensation" upon the deprivation of foreign wealth, it does so by way of a precatory "should," and subject only to the "relevant laws and regulations and all circumstances that the [depriving] State considers pertinent," i.e., without any express reference to inter- national law standards and procedures, not even by implication through cross-reference to Resolution 1803 (XVII). Indeed, because it mandates as well that all Compensation controversies "shall be settled under the domestic law of the nationalizing State and by its tribunals" (except insofar as the concerned parties might "freely and mutually" choose otherwise),~ its intent is to renounce international law (or its relevance) in this realm? Con- cededly, the preparatory history of Article 2(2) (c) leaves room to contend that this negative interpretation is unwarranted. Citing the remarks of the 5~ See note 14 supra. For a description of the formulation of this resolution, see Gess, Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources, 13 INT'L &amp; COMP. L.Q. 398 (1964). 5a GA Res. 1803 (XVII), supra note 14, para. I(4) (emphasis added). The provision continues: "In any case, where the question of compensation gives rise to a controversy, the national jurisdiction of the State taking such measures shall be exhausted. However, upon agreement by sovereign States and other parties concerned, settlement of the dispute should be made through arbitration or international adjudication." 54 Cornelius Murphy, writing in 1975, described "It]he standard of 'appropriate' compensa- tion referred to in General Assembly Resolution 1803 (XVII), understood as an amount that is reasonable under all the circumstances," as "probably the governing principle." Murphy, supra note 46, at 52. The same view was taken by the sole arbitrator in the TOPCO/California Asiatic international arbitration with Libya, 17 ILM at 27-31, paras. 80-89. Cf. Garcia- Amador, supra note 23, at 20-24.

Nevertheless, because the preparatory history leading up to the article's adoption (including its final debate in the 29th session of the General Assembly) renders the issue ambiguous at best,?? because some key postadoption developments tend to corroborate a nationalistic or self-determinist bias,?~ and because, over time, the "full permanent sovereignty" principle has been used by its most vigorous exponents to legitimize the refusal of states to submit foreign-wealth deprivation disputes to international law standards and procedures,?s the repudiation of the principle of compensation as an international regulatory norm seems a reasonable conclusion? 5s See 29 UN GAOR, Second Committee (1638th mtg.) 382, UN Doc. A/C.2/SR. 1638, at 383-84 (1974).

In point of fact, as a colleague and I sought to demonstrate almost two decades ago, and Western advocates to the contrary notwithstanding (see, e.g., Schwebel, note 55 supra), the notion of "prompt, adequate, and effective compensation" always has been, at least in the context of large-scale nationalization, more a preference assumed for bargaining purposes than a rule of international law. See Dawson &amp; Weston, note 35 supra. ~0 For a helpful summary, see Garcia-Amador, supra note 23, at 32-40. ~ Note, for example, the following passage from the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development, adopted in 1975 by the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO): 32. That every State has the inalienable right to exercise freely its sovereignty and permanent control over its natural resources, both terrestrial and marine, and over all economic activity for the exploitation of these resources in the manner appropriate to its circumstances, including nationalization in accordance with its laws as an expression of this right, and that no State shall be subjected to any forms of economic, political or other coercion which impedes the full and free exercise of that inalienable right [emphasis added]. For the full text of the Lima Declaration, see Doc. ID/Conf. 3/31 or UN Doc. A/10112 (I 975). On the international plane, the principle of permanent sovereignty has become the focal normative conception used by states to justify their right to exercise control over production and distribution arrangements without being hampered by the international law of state responsibility as it had been traditionally interpreted by the capital-exporting countries.

Lillich edges close to this judgment in his historical review of the substantive erosion of Resolution 1803 (XVII).64 The matter is, I think, ambiguous. Article 2(2) (c) does provide for "appropriate compensation" (albeit in terms of the precatory "should" rather than the mandatory "shall"). In fact, it invokes this language in the face of two immediately preceding and related General Assembly formulations that spoke, first, in terms of "possible compensation"~5 and, second, without any reference to compensation whatsoever? On the other hand, what good is a promise, especially a discretionary one, when there is not the slightest gesture against the potential for arbitrary discrimination? No doubt a great deal in many instances. Such must have been the view, it seems, of some of the industrialized Nordic countries which, at the sixth Special Session, evinced a generally favorable regard for the then proposed NIEO Charter (in contrast to the United States, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan).~8 However, as once suggested by Mr. Justice Holmes, a right without an effective remedy may be no right at all? In any event, assuming our interpretation is correct, we have in Article 2(2) (c) what looks to be no minor challenge to the international law principle of compensation as traditionally even recently--conceived, and it is to this 64 See Lillich, supra note 54, at 190: "Resolution 1803 (XVII) . . . still affords the best opportunity for an eventual consensus on the thorny compensation question. It can no longer be assumed, however, that developing as well as developed States still consider it reflective of customary international law" (footnote omitted).

See text accompanying note 6 supra. Also, considering that paragraph (j) of chapter I of the NIEO Charter provides for the "[f]ulfilment in good faith of international obligations" (see note 2 supra), it is reasonable to assume that treaty commitments to international arbitration or mediation would be honored. Nevertheless, it is important to note that "compulsory ad- judication or an obligation to submit to third-party settlement only exists when that method has been agreed upon by both interested States, either on an ad hoc basis or by means of a pre- existing treaty or agreement."

As stated above, there are two key issues that seem most in need of attention, one of law (lex lata) and one of policy (de lege ferenda). An Issue of Law In ascending order of persuasiveness, there are at least four comple- mentary arguments in support of the proposition that Article 2(2) (c) is an authoritative statement of existing international law, each derived from a perception about the NIEO Charter as a whole: first, per former President Echeverria of Mexico, that the Charter was intended to place its articulated principles on "a firm legal footing";*? second, that its provisions are framed by such weighty preambular imagery--e.g., "The General Assembly . . . Solemnly adopts the present Charter . . ."--as to at least imply binding legal effect; third, that the Charter, even though a General Assembly resolution, is no ordinary resolution and hence is more prescriptive than recom- mendatory; and fourth, that the Charter, having won the overwhelming endorsement of the UN membership (i.e., by a vote of 120-6-10), reflects mature legal concepts and expectations that go beyond pious expressions of morality. None of these arguments, singly or in combination, is entirely convincing. To begin with, mere good intentions and weighty imagery are not alone sufficient to make law, let alone terminate long-standing and still signifi- cantly accepted legal norms. The point is elementary. Moreover, as con- siderably documented in the award on the merits in the international arbitration between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company and California Asiatic Oil Company, on the one hand, and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic, on the other, the travaux preparatoires and debates leading up to the Charter's adoption show that few of the UN members seriously believed they were creating law in the binding or codificatory sense (high hopes and rhetorical flourishes notwithstanding).?~ 70 Summary of Address by Mr. Luis Echeverria Alvarez, President of the United Mexican States, UNCTAD Proceedings, 3d Sess., UN Doc.

The purpose of the proposed Charter, Ambassador Castaneda (the working group's Chairman) stated, was to "enunciate authentic economic rights and duties of States . . . as rights and duties of a juridical nature" and that therefore the function of the working group was "to formulate an instrument . . . setting out genuine authentic rights and duties of a juridical nature arising in economic relations between States." *~ This point is stressed by the sole arbitrator in Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co./California Asiatic Oil Co. v.

Despite its "legislative history," the NIEO Charter is no ordinary General Assembly resolution (else why the profound feelings stirred?) and it did receive a large majority vote. One of course can point to the conventional wisdom that General Assembly resolutions have only recommendatory force? Also, it can be shown that, in addition to the many votes cast against particular provisions, the Charter in general, and Article 2 in particular, received the negative votes and abstentions of a very powerful segment of the global economic community, without whose support no amount of wishful think- ing can do much good~s (or at least not for those provisions which aroused vigorous dissentTM or as between those members who disagreed funda- mentally).?a It probably is correct to conclude, in fact, that these debating points, along with certain postadoption practices to be noted hereinafter, are, on final analysis, decisive? After all, law is no mere body of rules accompanied by convictions of "obligation" or "duty." It is, rather, "a process of decision taken in accordance with formal authority and supported by effec- tive control, with the matter of control (or sanction), when not confined to the official threat or use of force, commonly being reduced .... to what Professor McDougal has called 'expectations about reciprocal claim and mutual tolerance.'"~ Nevertheless, it is too extreme (if not utterly in- correct) to say, as one critic of the NIEO Charter has done, that "General Assembly Resolutions do not in any way have the force of law."?s One need ?: See, e.g., J. BRIERLY, THE LAW OF NATIONS 1 10 (6th ed. 1963). ?a As already mentioned, the roll-call vote on the NIEO Charter was 120 in favor to 6 against, with 10 abstentions. For details, see notes 2 and 7 and accompanying textsupra. As summarized and evaluated by one observer, "The Charter was passed by a large margin, but the United States, Canada, Japan, and the members of the European Economic Community all abstained or voted against it. Such opposition properly raises a serious question as to the legal significance of the Charter." Dubitzky, supra note 71, at 674 (footnote omitted). A more emphatic position was taken by the sole arbitrator in Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co./California Asiatic Oil Co. v. Libyan Arab Republic, 17 ILM at 29, paras. 85-86. 74 Other provisions of the NIEO Charter that failed to achieve universal endorsement were, in particular, Articles 5, 19, and 28. 75 Common sense dictates that there is at least room for argument that the NIEO Charter may have "binding" legal effect as among those developing and socialist countries which voted for its adoption with little or no reservation.

In the first place, the NIEO Charter was in fact adopted by a very large margin (albeit, as noted, without unanimous and important endorsement). Second, it is replete with the language of legal obligation, reflecting the General Assembly's original, even if compromised, intention "to establish or improve norms of universal application for the development of inter- national economic relations on a just and equitable basis."79 Third, it is one of the most vigorous and important demonstrations of a long Third World effort to bring about radical changes in the international economic order, dating back to the Afro-Asian Conference at Bandung in 1955 and-under- scored at numerous conferences and intergovernmental negotiating sessions since that seminal meeting.so Finally, reflecting perhaps the juridical cogency of these and similar factors, the Charter and especially certain of its provisions, such as Article 2(2) (c), clearly have generated strong resistance in the "no legal effect" Northern/Western school, which accurately perceives a major parry and thrust to its long-standing dominance of the global economic system a curious response for proponents of the view that the Charter has only recommendatory import.' In other words, if we contemplate the truism that the venerable "legal question/political question" distinction invariably produces results that can be rationalized only by knowing the relevant identifications, expectations, and demands of the decision maker involved, it is not enough to indulge in normatively ambiguous classification and terminology, which tends more to obfuscate than to clarify. What is needed is frank recognition that, as Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty would tell us, a "charter," "declaration," or "resolution" will be called "binding" or "recommendatory" depending largely upon one's policy preferences, qualified by processes of "reciprocal claim and mutual tolerance," and that therefore it is the actual practice of states and other actors (and the policy reasons underlying that practice) that finally determines whether the NIEO Charter in general, and Article 2(2) (c) in particular, have"binding," "recommendatory," or no effect whatsoever.8~ Looking, then, to the most recent available evidence of state practice in 79 GA Res. 3082 (XXVIII), 28 UN GAOR, Supp. (No. 30) 40, UN Doc.

Admittedly, much of this evidence stems from North Americans (including myself), some of it predates the creation and adoption of the NIEO Charter, and only a minor share reveals what has been done to resolve "indirect," "constructive," or "creeping" expropria- tion controversies.84 Neverthelesss, the basic compensation pattern is clear. Furthermore, in each of the reported cases since the NIEO Charter, all of them "expropriation" or "nationalization" cases, the respondent countries have been ones that voted for the adoption of the Charter.s5 All of this argues for the proposition that the principle of compensation as an international regulatory norm is yet alive, even if under attack. From a jurisprudential point of view, it matters not at all that the individual settle- ments, lump sum agreements, and arbitral awards that make this finding possible have resulted, more or less, from what the legal positivists would call "extralegal" expediencies.

In short, even though the NIEO Charter itself may be perceived as almost.a "dead letter" juridically, Article 2(2) (c) may be the start of a fresh practice whose impact on the law, although currently without immediate binding force, could be substantial in the future. A n Issue of Policy This essay began with a parable from Franz Kafka to stress the point that, over the years, the preponderance of the peoples of the Third World have gotten little or no real opportunity to participate in, and benefit from, the existing global economic order. This leads one to ask, irrespective of all that has been said so far, whether the LDC's, now acutely alert to this "distributive injustice" (albeit too frequently without reference to their own internal orders), are not absolutely correct in insisting upon drastic system (including normative) change. One can legitimately wonder whether there is any real possibility of eliminating or substantially reducing global inequities as long as we continue to think and act according to the dictates of the present world order.8~ Now whether this line of questioning is appropriate to NIEO Charter Article 2(2) (c) is a matter over which reasonable minds can differ.

And as Richard Lillich and I have documented in great detail, the Article 2(2) (c) challenge to international law actually seldom arises because the vast majority of compensation claims for the loss of foreign-owned wealth--an estimated 95 percent since World War II--are settled through the negotiation of international lump sum agreements.9~ Still, if only as a symbol of the Third World's demand for radical change, Article 2(2) (c) should be considered in these lights. At the very least, such questioning impels one back to the basics of justificatory policy, something that seldom occurs when one stands more on the dominant than on the unfavored side of a legal tradition. If the international law principle of compensation cannot meet the test of the contemporary (and future) com- mon interest, then surely, and especially if it actually contributes to the problem of global poverty, it ought to give way to one that does. On what basis, then, might the international law principle of compensa- tion be justified, if at all? Certainly not, one would suppose, on those Western conceptions of laissez-faire justice which inspired it and which, in later years, especially during the 19th century, made "the inviolability of private property" (and the correlative "duty" to make reparation for damage done thereto) a sine qua non of international square dealing. In our ideologically cloven world, such a rationale would be untenable. For any international law principle to survive, it must advance the common interests not of a limited ideology but of the wider (global) community it purports to serve. Of course, the "common interest of the world community" is something that is easier to talk about than it is to apply, especially in particular cases. Nevertheless, in a world aspiring to greater "distributive justice" for all peoples (no less highly generalized an abstraction), it is appropriate-- indeed essential--to insist that the principle of compensation be made to serve "a world public order of human dignity" or, as Myres McDougal puts it, "a world public order in which values are shaped and shared more by persuasion than by coercion, find which seeks to promote the greatest pro- duction and widest possible sharing, without discriminations irrelevant of merit, of all values among all human beings."~2 That is, if it is to avoid desuetude, the international law principle of compensation must find ~0 Farer, supra note 39, at 84. ? 9~ See, in particular, 1 R.

Less abstractly, even if not splendidly in avoidance of the high-level-of-abstraction problem, this means that the principle of compen- sation must be seen to serve the following interdependent, although always potentially contra- dictory, objectives: (1) reducing the possibility for resort to coercion on the part of capital- exporting, claimant countries; (2) fostering at least minimum order within capital-importing, depriving countries; (3) maximizing the free flow of beneficial wealth, skills, enlightenment, and other important values across national boundaries; and (4) facilitating an optimum neces- sary return from and for all host country value processes.</page><page sequence="21">1981] NIEO CHARTER AND FOREIGN WEALTH DEPRIVATION 4.67 validation in the degree to which it actually promotes a world economy that holds out, if not the assurance of complete security and total abundance, at least the prospect of minimum order and basic well-being for all. Only if it assists in the achievement of a peaceful, equitable, productive and, one should add, ecologically sensitive balance among competing legitimate demands can or should the principle be vindicated. Then, being identified more with the interests of the world community as a whole than with the interests of any particular group or groups, it would require neither sponsor nor justification. The probable Third World response is, however, that it is Article 2(2) (c), which is centrally concerned with the negative developmental impact of direct foreign investment (DFI) by transnational corporations, not the inter- national law principle of compensation, that is most likely to advance the world economy of human dignity to which I have just alluded. Starting from the realistic Kafkaesque perception that "[u]nfortunately, there are very few examples in history of the rich surrendering their power willingly or peacefully [to the poor]," as the former Director of the Policy Planning and Program Review Department of the World Bank has put it,9a the argument would have at least three interdependent strands: (1) By allowing for greater autonomy among host societies, Article ... " n 2(2) (c) would give effective meaning to the principle of full permane t sovereignty." As a consequence, it would eliminate vestiges of colonial- ism and other inequities in global economic relations, permit greater control over harmful DFI as represented especially by transnational corporations, and thereby afford greater freedom of choice among alternative paths to development (including, if desired, so-called dis- sociative strategies of development). (2) Whatever the alarums sounded by the capital-exporting world (raised more as scare tactics, it would be argued, than as matters of deep conviction), the principles and procedures of Article 2(2) (c) would not deter DFI measurably. In fact, they would encourage such investment because they would help instill greater host-country self-respect, which in turn enables precisely those stable political climates that make for foreign investment security. (3) By requiring foreign-wealth deprivation controversies to be settled according to the law and through the tribunals of the depriving state, Article 2(2) (c) would facilitate compensation decisions consistent 9a M. UL HAQ, THE THIRD WORLD AND THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER 10 (Overseas Development Council Development Paper No. 22, 1976). The same author continues: Whenever and wherever the rich have made any accommodation, they have done so be- cause it had become inevitable, since the poor had gotten organized and would have taken away power in any case. The basic question today, therefore, is not whether the poor nations are in a grossly unfavorable position in the present order. They are, and they will continue to be, unless they can negotiate a new world order. The basic question really is whether they have the necessary bargaining power to arrange any fundamental changes in the present political, economic, and social balance of power in the world. Ibid.

The conse- quence of such a risk allocation approach to compensatory decisions --involving a judgment that foreign investors (especially transnational corporations) are generally better situated to bear the costs of "na- tionalization" and other forms of deprivation--would be to promote global wealth redistribution and thereby facilitate the meeting of basic human needs. These and like arguments, I suggest, must not be taken lightly. They reflect both a profound (and by no means wholly unwarranted) belief that the present global order systematically discriminates against the interests of the poor, and an equally profound (and by no means wholly unwarranted) conviction that there is no way to reverse this state of affairs except by challenging head-on the criteria, rules, and procedures by which that order, in particular its economic parts, has operated heretofore. Concededly, for persons historically more on the giving than on the receiving end of economic (and political) decision, this injunction does not transform easily into changed behavior. Nonetheless, it is essential not to forget, in the words of former UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Philippe de Seynes, that "the historical circumstances of decolonization, memories of exploitation and the persistence of unequal bargaining powers have created the atmosphere in which foreign investment is now being judged."94 On the other hand, as de Seynes simultaneously observes (albeit in special contextual terms), one also dare not forget the "inescapable fact that non-renewable resources acquire value largely through international markets and [that] they can be exploited only through the most complex technological and logistic operations."~5 De Seynes's implicit message is, I think, that most countries, including those of the Third World, need private foreign capital and know-how to effect full employment and raise standards of living. At any rate, while it is difficult to construct general assess- ments in this connection (as shall be seen in a moment), the thesis seems by and large accurate. In the first place, "petrodollars" and foreign aid programs notwith- standing, there simply are not now (for military, political, and other reasons) sufficient public funds to meet the needs of economic development on a global scale;"6 and, in any event, such funds typically are "tied" in ways that ~ De Seynes, Statement on the United Nations Study of Multinational Corporations to the Southwestern Legal Foundation, International and Comparative Law Center, Symposium on Private Investments Abroad, Dallas, Texas, June 13, 1974, UN Doc.

The same can generally be said, secondly, of such DFI alternatives as "know-how" or "management" contracts, "licensing" agreements, and "turn-key" operations. Furthermore, while certainly not to be discouraged, these "nonequity" alternatives are not without their own problems in terms of (social) cost and harmonious government-business relations.9s Finally, even countries pledged to achieving their developmental goals strictly or mainly through "self-help" or "self-reliant" strategies, avowedly to "dissociate" themselves from too great a dependence on foreign entrepre- neurship and industrial modes of development, ordinarily cannot and do not foreclose foreign enterprise altogether.s? As Jimoh Omo-Fadaka has written, "Self-reliance does not mean that countries will not need or accept international assistance for their development. Obviously, they will need and seek foreign capital for particular projects. They would welcome such that is borne out every day and every hour is beyond question: the aggravation of economic problems is largely connected with the rising scale of the arms race and with soaring mili- tary expenditure.

In sum, irrespective of the utility of such conventional distinctions as "capitalism" and "socialism," there is considerable evidence that at this stage in history the achievement of a world economy of human dignity requires at least some kinds of DFI. Indeed, it is this fact, in combination with the premium now being placed on the principle of "full sovereignty," which underlies, in Oscar Schachter's words, "the ambivalence in the attitudes and legislation of many of the developing countries."~?~ Yet, it is one thing to say that the LDC's need DFI (or at least certain kinds of DFI) and quite another to say that, in turn, this need compels the inter- national law principle of compensation. Indeed, it is precisely this mental leap that is rejected by much of the Third World. Accordingly, it behooves one to look more closely, even if only briefly, at the three major counter- arguments given. 1. The Antidomination/Proequity Argument. The contention is widespread in the developing world (and assisted by Marxist and New Left writings on the international economy) that DFI, at least as practiced by the trans- national corporations commanding the field,~?2 is generally detrimental to Third World development, hence not to be encouraged, and therefore beyond the reach of the international law principle of compensation. This ,00 Omo-Fadaka, supra note 97, at 47. Consider also Parthasarathi, Self-Reliance as Alternative Strategy for Development, 2 ALTERNATIVES 365, 369 (1976), who writes that the concept of self- reliance (SR) should not be equated merely with economic nationalism; nor should it be meant to imply autarchy or self-sufficiency; SR and self-sufficiency do not necessarily lie along the same "line." While SR may imply, or indeed call for, self-sufficiency in a particular case, the reverse would not be true. SR does not imply a lessening of interest in international cooperation, but it does imply a desire to make the relations between industrialized and developing countries reflect genuine interdependence and international economic justice.

Schachter continues: "This apparent contradiction cannot be dismissed as irrational; it should be understood as reflecting a polarity inherent in the objective circumstances and, in that sense, as a challenge to seek a reconciliation that would, to the extent possible, maximize the competing values." Ibid. For similar opinion, see Dawson &amp; Weston, supra note 12, at 72-77. 20: The term "transnational corporation," which I use interchangeably with the term "multi- national enterprise," is the expression used in Article 2 of the NIEO Charter.

"This is so," writes Joseph LaPalombra, "notwithstanding the proliferation of developing nations since World War II, and notwithstanding the location of natural resources and population growth in the Third World."

O CHARTER AND FOREIGN WEALTH DEPRIVATION 461 thesis derives from one or both of at least two distinct perceptions about transnational corporations: first, that these firms, capable of circumventing national policies and regulations, are prone to coercive, fraudulent, or otherwise dubious practices which subvert the local political order; and second, that these enterprises perpetuate an inequitable international division of labor, encourage dependency technologies more appropriate to the "metropole" than to the "periphery," and disregard the crux of de- velopment as the satisfaction of basic human needs.~?a In the Northern/ Western world, where history has favored Private property rights more than the social interest, these perceptions have been given regrettably short shrift.~?4 Yet there is substantial basis for the argument, even if, as happens to be true, it often is espoused by elitist Third World spokesmen. Past disclosures of bribery, duress, and "covert operations" on the part of transnational corporations and their "home" countries amply justify the first perception ? o noted;~?5 and there are rich and growing data to the effect that multina- tional enterprise (past and present) is not as economically virtuous as its proponents claim, that in fact it tends to inflict major harm upon host (particularly developing) societies, at least from a needs-oriented point of view.~?6 The multinational corporations, planned on a planetary scale and at economic levels rivaled only by a few nation-states, can be shown in many instances to be oblivious to the interests of the poor countries. Operating in extremely oligopolistic markets, intent upon global profit maximization, and generally committed to GNP-growth models of development, they are arranged more to reinforce than to repeal what Dieter Senghass has called the "structurally crippled" condition of most ~0a A popular elaboration of these and related themes is found in R.

Understandably, therefore, the Third World search is on for new ways and means to deal with DFI.

To the contrary, this accounting can and should be pressed fully (a point I have made elsewhereTM and to which I return below~).

Nor has it any interest in investing more than it has to in acquiring knowledge of local conditions and investigating ways of adapting its own productive knowledge to local factor/price ratios and market conditions. Its purpose is not to transform the economy by exploiting its potentialities (especially its human potentialities) for develop- ment, but to exploit the existing situation to its own profit by utilization of the knowledge it already possesses, at minimum cost to itself of adaptation and adjustment .... Hence, it will invest in technological research on the adaptation of its technology and in the de- velopment of local labour skills only to the extent that such investment holds a clear prospect of profit.

To be sure, the owners or managers of private foreign capital and technology are not engaged in charitable works. Writes Harlan Cleveland: "Generating and fulfilling effective demand, not meeting basic human. needs, [has been] the criterion of business judgment. The 'bottom line,' not the 'bottom billion,' [has been] the central focus of public policy."~s Nevertheless, in our "more or less"--not "either-or"--world, many foreign investors do try to act the "corporate good citizen." Moreover, economic cost-benefit analyses of the impact of DFI upon Third World development, including some analyses of transnational corporate activity, reveal that private profit can be consistent with social objectives (e.g., in certain tech- nology transfers, manpower training, and local subcontracting).TM These observations and findings, although necessarily qualified by the principal interests and world views of the analysts involved (corporate management, labor/trade union, home country, host country, or other),n5 naturally complicate the Third World argument and consequently present economic crosscurrents not easily maneuvered by lawyers. But the legal policy question remains nonetheless: is it equitable (desirable), especially in the absence of safeguards against arbitrary discrimination, to withhold from essentially responsible foreign investors an international assurance, even a minimal one, of an "appropriate" or "fair" return in the event of a publicly inspired wealth deprivation? Regarding the private enterprise that has yet to make an investment and that presumably is "on notice," an "assumption of risk" argument may suffice as an answer. It clearly is a dubious rejoinder, however, for the enterprise that already is in place and that may well have gotten there on the basis of an official invitation or other representation made earlier (a point one hopes is not lost on those LDC's which sooner ~s Cleveland, Toward an International Poverty Line, in J.

Without wishing to be excessively deterministic in this matter we might maintain for the sake of clarity of exposition that the field contains at least four important groups: corpora- tions (represented by management), employees (both union and nonunion), home-country governments, and host-country governments. Distinct outlooks and approaches toward multinationals, he continues, correspond to each of these groups, and in his collection Modelski assembles "studies and expositions of views" that adequately express them. Of course, as Modelski is careful to point out, "this effort does not exhaust the range of viewpoints to be considered."

Also to be considered is the consequence of a domesticated compensation principle upon claimants and controversies not associated with major foreign enterprise: for example, upon minor foreign entrepreneurs and individual property owners (or upon alien personal injury and other non- wealth claims). One possible answer is that Article 2(2) (c) is not meant to affect other than major DFI. Another is that most-perhaps all-of these variables are covered by international human rights prescriptions and customary "denial of justice" principles. Were Article 2(2) (c) an authorita- tive statement of international law, an alert advocate surely would so argue. The interpretative enterprise being. the highly subjective phenomenon that it is, however, the fact remains that Article 2(2) (c), which is silent in these respects, is potentially capable of corrosive effect beyond the major DFI context. Moreover, despite recent campaigns from Washington and else- where, the accelerating march of authoritarianism worldwide hardly warrants unqualified optimism about human rights and "denial of justice" protections. To be sure, many societies North and South will be undeterred. in assuring protection to individual foreign nationals who are in some way deprived at the hands of local authorities. Indeed, many will do so irrespec- tive of any sense of international legal obligation. Nevertheless, by virtue of its understandable preoccupation with the developmental impact of transnational corporations and other major foreign enterprise, Article 2(2) (c) overlooks the interest of individuals from throughout interna- tional society (including from the developing world) in not being asked to shoulder disproportionately painful burdens compared to all the rest.n6 In sum, as regards the antidomination/proequity argument, Article 2(2) (c) appears to overreach. By withholding the compensation issue from international law standards and procedures, and in a manner that fails to safeguard against arbitrary decision, it invites inequities of its own-in- equities that ultimately can work to the disadvantage of the long-term interests of the LDC's themselves.~ Granted, one can insist that the historic plight of the Third World is so gross an inequity as to justify incurring all or most other inequities. However, this value choice seems unnecessary when it comes to the compensation issue in the prescriptive as distinct from applicative context.~8 My point is not that there should not be strenuous efforts to eliminate imperious and otherwise "inappropriate" foreign investment modes and practices, even serious consideration of funda- mental kinds of system change. What is questioned is whether rejection of the international law principle of compensation is the best way to achieve this objective. Better suited to the task, it would seem, are multilateral codes of conduct and grievance machinery, perfected regulatory legislation at the national level, preinvestment "screening" arrangements and agreements, n6 One is tempted to ask, however, whether this logic should apply to the likes of a John D. Rockefeller or a J. Paul Getty. ~? See subsection 2 infra. '~ See text preceding and following note 139 infra.

Such new and improved methods of regulation and accountability, I believe, are less apt to risk inequitable or otherwise unwanted results because, in contrast to Article 2(2) (c), they favor discrete assessments that are alert to the infinite complexity of particular cases and national economies.~9 Indeed, as G. K. Helleiner suggests, lately increased experimentation along these lines may well account for a recent precipitous decline in formal "nationalization" and "expropriation" disputes involving U.S. firms abroad.~?

The Nondeterrence Argument. The contention that withdrawal of the international principle of compensation--of an internationally pledged "appropriate" return--would not deter DFI measurably is one that for obvious reasons is strongly resisted in the Northern/Western world (at least officially). However, it is a thesis that deserves greater deference than ordinarily it receives.~~a The so-called promotional pacemaker, for example, who typically starts new LDC ventures (especially in the manufacturing sector where often there is little or no indigenous entrepreneurial experi- ence), only to withdraw once the enterprise is under way, is unlikely to be 119 It would be preferable that for their part, the_ host countries defined well in advance at what moment they meant to take a share-either governmental or by local capitalists--L' if the firms which come from abroad indicate at what point they would insist on participa- tion by their nationals in the personnel and management of these firms. It would be natural, too, that the host countries outlined the sectors to which they would prefer to see foreign capital directed subsequently, as the initial investments are gradually replaced by local capital. Such schemes could prevent misunderstandings and tensions, and could make of foreign enterprises a real impetus for a balanced, and less dependent, national development. P. URI, supra note 99, at 75.

Often the same can be said, too, of resource-dependent enterprises which, despite alternative sources or synthetic substitutes, may find themselves so "locked in" as to make minimal compensation assurances virtually meaningless; or, indeed, of any (at least large-scale) foreign in- vestor who, by demonstrating reasonably strict or even general adherence to host country priorities and policies, stands to reduce the risk of uncom- pensated deprivation and therefore the probability of being deterred by the absence of compensation promises. Also, as surely no pedant's footnotes need substantiate, insurance schemes, pricing mechanisms, tax write-offs, and various bookkeeping devices, while not without cost to corporate share- holders and customers, make it possible for many foreign investors to spread or otherwise offset potential losses in ways that make the risk of uncom- pensated deprivation a less significant factor in foreign investment decision making than is commonly believed. Still, even if as only one of the many risks and uncertainties of foreign investment, there is no blinking the fact that a heightened potential for un- compensated deprivations, as implied by Article 2(2) (c), would have a chilling effect upon DFI. Without a minimal assurance against major loss-- "at least a short-range assurance of an adequate return... and "124 recovery --small foreign investors, for example, who do not have the flexibility of the multinational corporations, would likely as not be deterred.

This argument is in no way helped, however, by the failure of the NIEO Charter to assure against arbitrary discrimination, a truly sorry omission that always must be recalled when contemplating Article 2(2) (c). Also, it can be said that the capacity of the LDC's to achieve their objec- tives through collective action (as most conspicuously illustrated by some of the recent successes of the OPEC countries) can serve as an effective countervailing force to the threat of withheld foreign capital and know- how.127 However, there is evidence that the early optimism surrounding "commodity power" has receded; and, in any event, the policy is fraught with complexities that are not easily controlled no matter how earnest the desire. Finally, it can be argued that by emphasizing (1) private technology purchases and public technology transfers, and (2) "dissociative" or "self- reliant" strategies of development, dependence on DFI can be sharply re- duced, and with it the need for concern about the,issue of deterrence. This last rebuttal cannot be lightly dismissed. Yet it is, I believe, too extreme in underestimating, first, the "smoother, more automatic, and sometimes even (socially) cheaper access to technology" that is afforded by multi- national firms12s (in contrast to "licensees or one-shot, arm's length purchasers of 'shelf' technology");x29 second, the potentiality of new "ap- propriate technologies" through smaller (but more vulnerable) DFI; and third (and more generally), the fact of an increasingly interpenetrating, if not always truly interdependent, world.~3? Thus, Article 2(2) (c) again appears to overreach.

It is not denied that a repudia- tion of the international law principle of compensation would produce adjustments that over time would establish new stabilities of expectation and behavior. But in the meanwhile, forgetting for the moment the un- reconstructed interventionist predilections of some Northern constituencies, what would be the cost/benefit ratio? _ 3. The Wealth Redistribution Argument. One positive response to the fore- going question is, as noted earlier, that the possibilities for redistributing the global product would be that much more enhanced. By requiring foreign-wealth deprivation controversies to be settled according to domestic law principles and procedures, Article 2(2) (c), it can be argued, would facilitate compensation decisions consistent with a depriving state's capacity (or incapacity) to pay and thereby help reduce glaring economic inequities. There is, I think, larger merit to this contention than Northerners (especially Americans) ordinarily are inclined to give it, at least when it is limited to the short run.~a~' Among other things, we blanch at "deep pocket" thories of risk allocation that presume foreign investors (especially the multinational corporations) to be relatively well situated to shoulder the costs of "nationalization" and other forms of wealth redistribution. Per- haps out of some blind allegiance to outworn shibboleths that posture any socialist experiment as the work of the devil, or perhaps because of some anthropomorphic conception of business enterprise that resists ex- plaining why collectivities should not be treated differently than individuals,~ss we tend to discount the variety of schemes, pricing mechanisms, tax write-offs, and other risk-spreading devices that, though costly, make such burdens at least bearable. Nevertheless, my sense is that Article 2(2) (c) overreaches yet again. In the first place, although saying so is to risk charges of paternalism, it is by no means clear that a general acceptance of Article 2(2) (c) would lead to true distributive justice. The Third World elitism that infuses much of the NIEO debate and the authoritarianism that now is rising throughout the South afford scant assurance that basic human needs would actually be met (a point that alone might justify international jurisdiction over the compensation issue, especially if the West were to give to "economic, social and cultural ~s~ See text preceding and following note 139 infra. ~a2 A notable exception is American economist Martin Bronfenbrenner who has sought to demonstrate through arithmetic models that the "confiscation" of private foreign wealth (i.e., without compensation) in "reasonably representative" underdeveloped economies can significantly accelerate economic development "by shifting income to developmental invest- ment from capitalists' consumption, from transfer abroad, and from unproductive 'invest- ment' like luxury housing."

Sec- ond, there is, as seen, the possibility that a domestication of the principle of compensation would deter needed beneficial foreign capital and tech- nology, particularly in the absence of assurances against arbitrary dis- crimination. While exaggerated in the North, this potential cost should not be minimized. Finally, there are systemic complexities that, although often neglected by deprivation-prone governments, nonetheless complicate the process of wealth redistribution in ways that are not always quickly evident. As David Apter has observed, what might be called the "Algerian solution" of extensive nationaliza- tion is not so easily accomplished. Enclaves can easily be taken over and, if not run by the government, handed over to a consortium. But where MNC domination affects an entire sector, such as large-scale fabrication plants, or petrochemicals, the problem is that the efficiency of the operation, the profits of the firm, are a function of an international network of pricing, tax rebates, labor agreements abroad, and so forth. To nationalize the part of the organization operating in a particular country is not to nationalize the network. Hence, unless the multinational sector consists of subsidiaries in which there is virtually no connection to the productive and financial facilities of the rest of the firm, the Algerian solution is very awkward, leading to inefficiencies, bureaucracy, and a different set of social overhead costs. Dependency, then, is built into intermediate modernization. Control cannot simply be a function of nationalization or any stock-in-trade solutions. No one can nationalize the metropolitan impact, the world market, the pricing and transfer policies.~s4 Of course, lawyers untrained in economics (and who therefore bring no obvious comparative advantage to the Third World's wealth redistribution argument) must be wary to avoid quick judgments in this realm, especially since even the economists can be found to disagree.~ss On balance, however, it is fair to say that, while certainly to be taken more seriously than it has been, the argument exaggerates the redistributive potential. Article 2(2) (c) looks to be the wrong tool for the right job. Thus, although not to minimize in any way the need to make the global wealth process work for the many instead of the few, one must conclude that Article 2(2) (c) should not be recommended as de lege ferenda. For all the reasons noted, it would tend more to retard than to promote a world economy of human dignity.

Utilizing the essentially conservative principle of "full permanent sovereignty" as a weapon of socioeconomic change~a6 (only to challenge, by way of double irony, an essentially radical principle that was fired in the crucible of royal encroachment and despotism), Article 2(2) (c) places the interests of the host state above all other interests, thereby fosters precisely that competitive nationalism which is at the root of North-South inequities, and consequently risks further contributing to the Third World's economic malaise. Even so, if we recall the Kafka parable quoted at the outset and face up to the crippled state of the LDC's as a consequence mainly of the asym- metrical structures that the "metropole" has visited upon the "periphery" since the beginning of colonialism (rather than of some "backward" in- ability to generate investment capital), it is difficult to escape a profound unease over the conclusions reached so far. It is hard not to sympathize with the "man from the country" who seeks a flexible and highly decentralized system to ensure that his economic and other priorities will be met. In the first place, as suggested earlier, there is mounting evidence that LDC links to the industrialized world, through aid, trade, investment, and migration (not least at the hands of the multinational corporations), not only have failed to improve the lot of the world's poor, but actually have worked to their "de-development." Summarizes M.I.T. economist Jagdish Bhagwati: IT]here is the doctrine of "malign neglect" which views the impact of . . . links between the rich and the poor nations as primarily detrimental to the latter group. In the apt description of Osvaldo Sunkel, integration of the developing countries in the international economy leads to their domestic disintegration. This doctrine also supports the economic notion, used extensively by the Swedish economists Knut Wicksell and Gunnar Myrdal, of growing disequilibrium and exploding sequences, rather than the classical notions of equilibrium. Thus, multinational corporations disrupt domestic salary structures by introducing islands of high-income jobs that cause exorbitant wage demands by others seeking to keep up with the Joneses in the multinationals. International trade leads to the perpetuauon of the role of developing countries as producers of primary, unsophisticated products that relegate them to a secondary and inferior position in the international division of labor. Furthermore, in the classic Prebisch thesis, the terms of trade of the primary-product-exporting developing countries have declined and will continue to do so, conferring gains on the developed and inflicting losses on the developing countries. The brain drain to the developed countries deprives the developing countries of scarce skills and the talents that make economic progress possible.

The language of "excess profits" has entered the valuation vocabulary in recent years, to be sure; but the language of "prompt, adequate, and effective" nevertheless prevails as the central rallying cry, with "book value"as the cri du coeur. Finally, but by no means least importantly, there is an indelicate paternalism attached to any thesis that argues, in essence, that the LDC's do not know what is good for themselves.

Bhagwati, Introduction, in THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER, supra note 3, at 1, 2-3: The author summarizes the opposing traditional view as follows: The ideology that has traditionally been dominant is aptly characterized as that of"benign neglect"-links with the rich nations create benefits for the poor nations. This view of the world economy parallels the utilitarian economists' view that the invisible hand works to promote universal well-being. In this model, the laissez-faire view that private greed will produce public good translates on the international scene into the notion that, while the different actors in the world economy pursue their own interests, the result will nonetheless be to benefit the developing countries. Thus, while multinational corporations invest in these countries to make profits, they will increase these countries' incomes, diffuse technology, and harness their domestic savings. The exchange of commodities and services in trade will reflect the principle of division of labor and hence bring gains from trade to these countries. The migration of skilled labor, instead of constituting a troublesome brain drain, will help to remove impediments to progress such as inadequate remuneration of the educated elite. Id. at 2.

This is, I think, the fundamental difficulty with Article 2(2) (c), the main reason why it should be rejected. Suppose, however, that Article 2(2) (c) were to be revised so as to prohibit arbitrary discrimination, and explicitly as a matter of international legal concern. What then? Could we not then endorse, as appears to be true of Article 2(2) (c), a "domesticated" principle of compensation? More provocatively, if we could point to an express international prohibition against arbitrary discrimination, and assume that the LDC's seeking juridical dissociation would be fully cognizant of the risks of withdrawn capital and know-how, why not leave the matter of compensation to the local authorities? I confess no absolute certainty on this issue. Clearly, it is no answer to say that such a revision would be merely an exercise in "anticolonialist" or "antiimperialist" sentimentality. Major changes obviously would be wrought, including the possibility (probability?) of an "equal treatment" rather than "minimum international standard" application of the compen- sation principle. Nor is it an answer that under such revised circumstances the LDC's would be more likely than other countries to evade their non- discrimination obligations. A more vivid assertion of ethnocentric hubris would be hard to imagine. Yet it is an answer, surely, that the economically and militarily powerful North (not to mention newly arrived powers in the developing world) might manipulate the revision to the detriment of the LDC's. However uncertain the notion of "appropriate compensation," the concept of "arbitrary discrimination" (with a lesser history of case-by-case refinement) is vaguer still, and thus more susceptible of interpretative abuse. Either because of a perception (real or otherwise) of an LDC evasion of nondiscrimination obligations or because large economic or political interests might be at stake, it regrettably is not difficult to conceive of a compensation or other foreign-wealth deprivation controversy generating rapid-fire charges of"arbitrary discrimination" for the purpose of justifying a unilateral intervention of some coercive sort. And therein lies a basis for genuine concern.~a8 True, some Third World spokesmen might claim (contrary to what I contend above) that these abusive risks are reason enough to disregard the NIEO Charter's failure to warrant against arbitrary discrimination in the first place. But this would be to turn the argument on its head. The point is not to renounce language that, even if imperfect, is serviceable as a check on potentially abusive LDC power. The point is to encourage arrangements, including the establishment of international tribunals or equivalent resolu- live mechanisms, that can reduce conflict and promote cooperation beneficial to all. Nevertheless, real dangers lurk.

To be sure, it always can be insisted that the dangers are worth risking. Stability--often a euphemism for maintaining the status quota is not and cannot be the optimal requirement of the international or any other system all the time. In this instance, however, even if we admit to the LDC straitjacket, is it really necessary to tempt serious harm? Is the international law principle of compensation necessarily inconsistent with the principle of "full permanent sovereignty"? My sense is that there is a promising middle way. Rather than scrap the international law principle of ("appropriate") compensation altogether, and consequently invite potentially explosive inequities and harm damaging to everyone's self-interest (at least over the long run), international lawyers should undertake to redefine or reform it, and in a way that will force no major compromise upon the principle of "full permanent sovereignty" as responsibly conceived. They should accommodate it to the basic human needs and second-order values (as appropriate) for which "full permanent sovereignty" should be presumed to stand, Of course, this route is not easy to follow. It requires serious psychological and political as well as economic adjustments, both North and South. Also, it requires enlightened commitment by all concerned policy analysts~~ especially the economists and lawyers--to fashion "scientific" indicators and formulas that can tell us where private profit ends and social responsibility begins. Yet, if the more broadly intended models of development strategy worked out by the Argentine Bariloche Foundation and the American Overseas Development Council are any indication,~S9 it can be done.~4? More importantly, it must be done. In addition to giving objective meaning to the concept of "appropriate compensation" by admitting into the balance of relevant considerations such potential (and two-way) evils as "duress" and "fraud,"~4~ this compromissary option would help catch the urgent struc- tural problems of North-South economic relations that in the context of foreign-wealth deprivation have so far escaped adequate international attention (and consequently produced more confrontation than concilia-~ tion). It is of course to the credit of the UN Commission on Transnational Corporations that this option is on its agenda for the formulation of a transnational corporate "code of conduct."~42 Yet the option merits far wider attention still.

Society as a whole must accept the responsibility for guaranteeing a minimum level for all its citizens and aim at equality in human relations .... The essence of the above argument is, of course, that the international law principle of compensation should be treated more as a presumption than as an inflexible rule; that the test of its legitimacy should be the extent to which it actually promotes the common interest of a world economy of human dignity; and that on these terms it seems neither an impossible nor an onerous norm for developed and developing countries to accept. Indeed, unless it is because the logical extension of this preferred view is that the burden of policy proof should rest upon the depriving state whenever the compensation question is handled by its domestic tribunals, or that it should rest upon the injured foreign investor whenever the issue may be decided by its home jurisdiction, it is difficult to see why anyone should refuse to do so. A concomitant approach, I concede, is the active development of inter- party preinvestment arrangements at the national level and decision- making mechanisms on the international plane that can more easily forestall and handle foreign-wealth deprivation disputes in an equitable and im- partial manner, a key concern of the UN Commission on Transnational Corporations mentioned above.TM But to acknowledge this approach is less a concession than it is a suggestion about where in this special realm the North-South dialogue should be bending much of its energies. IV. CONCLUSION: SUMMARY AND POSTSCRIPT In the preceding pages, I have considered how, from a world order policy perspective, one ought to greet the failure of Article 2 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States to provide for or otherwise honor the international law public purpose doctrine, the doctrine of alien non- discrimination, and the principle of compensation, as traditionally under- stood and applied in the foreign-wealth deprivation context. By way of conclusion, it is useful to reiterate the principal judgments reached. (1) The failure of Article 2 to provide for the so-called public purpose doctrine is no cause for alarm. The doctrine never has been sanctioned as a "rule" of international law whose violation independently engages international responsibility. Its omission, therefore, is entirely con- sistent with state practice. (2) The failure of Article 2 to provide for the doctrine of alien non- discrimination is explained by, and therefore must be seen against, a historical backdrop of imperialistic and ethnocentric application.

However, the failure of Article 2 to ensure against arbitrary discrimination is an egregious omission that should not be tolerated. (3) The apparent repudiation by Article 2(2) (c) of the international law principle of ("appropriate") compensation should be recognized neither as lex lata nor as de lege ferenda. It cannot be recognized as lex lata because it was not expected to have "binding'' legal effect, because a large segment of the international economic community opposed its adoption, and because it has not been confirmed in post- adoption practice. Moreover, it should not be recognized as de lege ferenda because, on final analysis, it would work to the overall detriment of the developing world (in large part because of its failure to protect against arbitrary discrimination) and thereby inhibit the achievement of a world economy of human dignity. However, to ensure at least minimal sensitivity to the problematique of universal well-being, the international law principle of ("appropriate") compensation should be made to accommodate to the principle of "full permanent sovereignty" as responsibly defined. In its application, it should be infused with basic human needs considerations; it should be treated more as a rebuttable presumption than as an inflexible rule. These judgments, I recognize, are not likely to be received enthusiastically by all who are concerned about the interrelation of direct foreign investment and territorial sovereignty. I suffer no illusion that they will be viewed as anything other than a "sellout" among certain capital-exporting constituen- cies or, conversely, as anything other than a liberal apology for the capitalist status quo among certain elements in the developing world. Identifying with the common interest of the world as a whole and conse- quently deferring to no particular special interest-least of all the "Inherent Rights Group" and the "Hard Socialist Group" in Thomas Bergin's "imaginary debate" ~4S- they challenge both the old and the proposed new order of things. This middle course seems appropriate, however. The great challenge lies less in "proving" the rightness or wrongness of the competing special claims (and values) involved, but in formulating, clarifying, and applying policies that will simultaneously satisfy developmental goals and attract beneficial private capital and technology. Such is the essence, in any event, of what is involved in much of the Law of State Responsibility (and International Claims) generally: the accommodation, in creative and humane fashion, of the exclusive interest of each nation in achieving economic freedom and well-being, on the one hand, and of the exclusive interest of the foreign investor in being assured at least a minimum of security and cooperation, on the other. It is hoped that what has been said here will move that process of accommodation a bit further than has been done heretofore. . ~4s See Bergin, The Compensation Rule: An Imaginary Debate, in 2 THE VALUATION OF NATIONAL- IZED PROPERTY, supra note 82, at 3.</page></plain_text>
