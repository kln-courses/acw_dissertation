Eliot, The Waste Land Like the High Priestess of the Tarot deck, Frances Whitehead presides over an arcane body of knowledge whose true interpretation remains perpetually half-veiled by her cloak. Long a patroness of obscure and discarded information, she conjures up forgotten symbols that resonate with familiar, yet elusive, mean ings and shrouded revelations. Although schooled as a printmaker, White head has become known over the past decade as a sculptor, first building large-scale, quasi emblematic constructions in richly textured metal, then progressing into the use of organ ic materials such as shellac and mica. Elegant ly spare, these works never fully gave up their secrets; it is as if, by paring down her ideas into their essential forms, she created something impenetrable. Only their esoteric, alchemical titles provide etymological clues to revelation. The dumbbell-like Arsenic (1988) is, quite lit erally, an early chemical symbol for the poi son. The cone and armature Alembic II (1988-89) is named after a vessel used in alchemical distillation. A flat ring of shellac is folded at its diameter to form Halve (1991). Learning Whitehead's vocabulary, however, is no guarantee of comprehension. Vaguely rec ognizable, yet foreign, her sculptures resist translation. In the past year, Whitehead has moved toward installation, a format that allows the multiplic ity of her concerns to emerge. Recently on view in the exhibition The Nature of the Machine at the Chicago Cultural Center, her efforts have taken a botanical shift, the ancient meanings of plant materials echoing her conceptual themes. The Dream (1993) comprised a fragrant veil fabri cated from cast pine rosin on an armature of zinc and steel, gradually dissolved by oil of lau rel from a glass dripper poised above, a man tle of laurel leaves, glass pistils and stamens submerged in laurel oil, and laurel plants encased in zinc armatures. Opposite these botanical symbols for fame and desire stood glass pots of deadly nightshade (atropa bel ladonna) laden with lethal berries. In Untitled (for the Lotophagi) (1992-93), oil of rosemary (remembrance) floated in a lotus (forgetting) "dish" of zinc and steel mesh coated with green shellac. Nearby, rosemary topiaries spelled out "memory," "amnesia," and "anamnesia." In these complex, sensuous installations, White head abandons the reductivism of her previous objects, engaging in dialogue rather than res olution. Through the dialectics of sense and intellect, she attempts to recover the origins of meaning from the distorted transmissions of time, history, and memory. In 1991, on the cusp of this abrupt transition, Whitehead created her first formal prints—a 216</page><page sequence="2">series of 19 lithographs and monoprints—at almost stubborn objectivity of her three-dimen- blessings of industry.

The donutlike torus and the more complex Klein bottle, two common figures in topological study, float dreamlike across the prints or hover rev erently at center. These found images, gener ated onto aluminum plates by xerox transfer, are superimposed on a sheet of drawings, also transferred to aluminum plate, from White head's sketchbook. Both the drawn and appro priated images are documents of Whitehead's "research"; they link the prints to the rest of her oeuvre, revealing distinct formal and concep tual threads. The recurring concentric circles of the torus, for example, recall the earlier Halve and presage the lotus dish in her recent installation. By opening her sketchbook for scrutiny, Whitehead reaches what is for her an unprece dented level of intimacy.

Appropriately, her process partakes of the magical. Each piece of Kayasuki paper is printed recto and verso; only with the applica tion of shellac, which soaks the paper and ren ders it translucent, do hidden images emerge. The more coats of shellac, the more translu cency is achieved, deepening the pictorial space. When applied to both front and back of the paper, the shellac cutouts create further trance like visual effects, pushing glossy elements for ward and drawing matte images back. The com positions appear to float and shift, mimicking the surreal interplay of the rational and sub conscious. These formal manipulations paral lel Whitehead's preoccupation with memory as both a psychological and cultural construct. Certain information, pushed to the fore, becomes 'Valuable," while, under the surface, a wealth of knowledge and experience lies dor mant, forgotten, yet ever present and no less crucial. Like the Vedic maya, the veil of illusion that both obscures and reveals, the shellac soaked paper offers a glimpse of an alternate universe behind the perceptual curtain. As a sibyl, however, Whitehead is stubborn ly abstruse, calling images up from the mist but refusing to interpret. There is something intimidating about someone who has answers, yet speaks only in riddles. But Whitehead is not given to easy or complete revelations, whether personal or artistic. In many ways, she operates from a culturally received position that keeps femaleness, and its apparendy dan gerous powers, underground. Her early inter est in esoterica functioned, in one sense, as a brilliant disguise—using a highly scientific, manmade vocabulary to express a furtive female intelligence. The true riches of her prints are similarly concealed: applied on verso, the sen suous wealth of her materials—shellac, gold and silver leaf—prospers unseen, turned to the wall. Her recent move toward botanical mate rials—first the shellac and plant resins, and now the plants themselves—more directly embraces the traditional realm of feminine influence. Whitehead's transition stemmed from her own garden, an unexpected profusion of vegetables, herbs, poisons, and nocturnal blossoms reclaimed from the rubble of the for mer crackhouse next door. For Whitehead-as woman, this secret garden is a nurturing endeav or, a haven from the blight of the city, yet once pressed into the service of her art, it becomes almost sinister, a laboratory for bizarre exper iments. Whitehead herself is something of an urban Morticia, cooking up the belladonna jam. She straddles the borderline between heresy and enlightenment, where one woman's witchcraft becomes another man's science. Whitehead's prints mark her first direct con frontation with gender difference and issues of creativity. Implicit in this is deliberate forget ting as a cultural defense. Historically, knowl edge belonging to women has been perceived as a threat, something to be co-opted and made "safe" by the masculine realms of science and art. Whitehead's compulsive veiling, then, serves as a both a protective mechanism (a way to avoid being burned at the patriarchal stake) and a metaphor for the hidden powers of the female. The combination of geometric, "rational" images and intuitive scribblings, and the atten dant play of her anthropomorphic mathemat ical forms, return the body to uneasy coexis tence with the intellect. With this resurrection, Whitehead begins to question the true locus of creative power. The secret, invisible anatomy of the uterus is at once an unreproducible conun drum (the Klein bottle) and the prima materia (the torus) from which all other forms spring. Splitting the Klein bottle apart only deepens the puzzle, leaving the inquisitor with twin Mobius strips, impossible to fully penetrate or escape. Whitehead plays with the mathematical para dox of these twisting surfaces, where "outside" is simultaneously "inside." As a result, the fal lopian anatomy of the bisected Klein bottle suggests a trapped, if vast, potential for giving birth, waiting for the midwife. Whitehead's prints are simultaneously a cel ebration of artistic, intellectual creativity and an indictment of its labors, which ultimately can only give rise to approximations of life. Her topological exercises practice evolution on a pri vate scale; the iconic torus and Klein bottle are supreme ancestors, the secret bloodlines between one act of generation and the next. In their anthropomorphism, Whitehead finds a correspondence between the creativity of the mind and that of the body. Ultimately, howev er, "similar" is not "same." At the heart of her unifying process is an attempt to compensate for a schism, a missing link. These prints, tran sitional works in her artistic relocation from the intellectual to the sensual, are both formal and intimate explorations. Like the split Platonic hermaphrodite, Whitehead is searching for a lost half, venturing to the mysteries of the "other side" in desire and pursuit of the omnipotent whole.
