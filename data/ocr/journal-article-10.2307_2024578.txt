<plain_text><page sequence="1">540 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY NELSON GOODMAN'S LANGUAGES OF ART FROM A MUSICAL POINT OF VIEW * T o many of us in music, the virtues of a confluence of ra- tional inquiry and art have long been evident, if rarely exhibited. So the existence of a book explicitly devoted to the epistemology of art by the author of The Structure of Ap- pearance seems to us not only an imposing benefice, but an entirely appropriate one as well. We do not, moreover, share the surprise of some of Professor Goodman's philosophical colleagues that he, in particular, should have become engaged in such an enterprise; for, from our vantage point, Goodman's contribution to th-e metr- languages of art had alfready seemed a considerah-,- one, long before the publication of his most recent book. And tha it was an indirect contribution, a use to which his work was put rather than one it specifically proposed, in no way diminished for us the scope and explicitness of that contribution's significance to our art-theoretical concerns. Thus, before turning to the matter of Languages of Art directly, it might be useful to elaborate briefly on the nature of this antecedent contribution, so that the Goodmanian influence on the music-conceptual scheme out of which my remarks about Lan- guages of Art emerge will be apparent. Quine has pointed out that "the less a science has advanced, the more its terminology tends to rest on an uncritical assumption of mutual understanding." Given this observation, it is hardly sur- prising that the customary inadequacy of meta-artistic communi- cation has resulted in the usual, though erroneous, attributions of cognitive indeterminateness to the manifestations of the object- domains of art themselves, an attribution which is evident in the prevalent practice, in the philosophy and theory of art, of identify- ing as the salient aspects of art almost anything other than the con- textually observable properties of those manifestations. Here an- other remark of Quine comes to mind: that "what counts as obser- vation sentences for a community of specialists would not always so count for a larger community." The converse of this sentence is, of course, frequently also true, for many other domains as well as for art; but the particular failure of nonartists to recognize, and of artists to explicate, the intersubjectivity of the entities the ob- servation of which constitutes the contemplation of something as a work of art of a particular kind, has made this fact a particular * Delivered at the Sixty-Sixth Annual Meeting of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, on December 29, 1969, at a symposium devoted to Nelson Goodman's Languages of Art.</page><page sequence="2">NELSON GOODMAN'S LANGUAGES OF ART 54I burden to the theory of art, as it is not in science, linguistics, or mathematics, in all of which the authority of competence is assert- ible in a metalanguage that is culture-wide recognizable. But it is the explicative theory of art-not the theory of struc- ture which may be understood as what is unfolded by a set of perceptual data selected and contemplated in a certain way which we may call "making a musical (or visual-artistic, or literary) struc- ture of that data"-that has been in the primitive state character- ized in Quine's remark. And therefore, those of us who have ob- served the cognitivity of music as a highly developed medium of thought within its empirical object-language have attended with increasing urgency to contemporary epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophical linguistics, and the study of formal and interpreted systems, to derive an explicative theory of music that might do justice to what may be called the "empirical theory of music" of which it would be a model. Now the special character of art entities as entities has lent a particular art-explicative relevance to the literatures of nominalis- tic epistemology and rational reconstruction, quite apart from the positions in specifically intraphilosophical controversy they repre- sent. Such relevance resides in particular in what Quine concedes to rational reconstruction: that "imaginative construction can af- ford hints of actual psychological processes." And since "actual psychological processes" are all there are in the entification of things as works of art, such reconstructions have obvious epistemic value in these cases. The nonimperativeness of the construal of any slice of sensory experience as determining an art entity and the determinacy of the entities derived from such a construal, as well as the vari- ability of that determinacy with respect to the supposedly "same" entities within the range delimited by the "field"-term involved, are all aspects of artistic cognition that correlate with the methodo- logical attitude toward entification adopted in Goodman's epistemo- logical investigations. Thus the replacement of the Given by the Chosen, or at least by the choosable-in-principle, is an indispensable practical concept in the perception and composition of art entities. What this concept enables, principally, is the awareness that the structure, or the iden- tity, of a work of art is in the mind's eye or ear of the perceiver. And this consequence of Goodman's earlier epistemology is signif- icant in that of Languages of Art as well; for example, in the expli- cation of the dependence of representation on what Goodman calls the "non-innocent eye." But a further consequence of this</page><page sequence="3">542 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY dependence, namely the necessary presence, in the cognition of something as an art entity, of a theory, however internalized, of that entity's structure, is not explicitly engaged in the book; and this is a matter to which much of the sequel will be addressed. The kind of analysis undertaken in connection with such con- structional systems as those of Carnap's Aufbau and The Structure of Appearance also represents an intensely practical matter for art, since the very identity of an art entity is a theoretical construct quite remote from the pragmatics of object-identification in the physical world. Art entities, in fact, may be said to have identity as entities of their types just by virtue of being identifiable as interpretations of a general notion of entityhood within that type. Therefore, the extent to which they can be determinately recog- nized as particular entities of their types depends first of all on the generality of the concept of entityhood they are regarded as inter- preting. And secondly, the degree of their particularity depends on the number of intervening concepts that can be, or that are, invoked between the atomic and the global levels, concepts which dis- tinguish and order subentities as the ultimate determinants of the global structure. Thus the salient characteristic of an art entity may, most generally, be considered to be its "coherence"; and the extent of its coherence, and hence of its particularity as a work of art, may be considered to reside in the degree of determinate com- plexity exhibited in the ordered structure of subentities of which it is a resultant. Moreover, in speaking of artworks as such we denote entities which, though they are inferred from observable characteristics of particular slices of the physical-entity world, are not themselves, as art entities, composed of those slices. Rather, these art entities are, so to speak, purely phenomenal things, intersubjective in the sense of thoughts rather than in that of sounds and sights. Now here I may appear, contrary to my assurances, to be raising strictly philosophi- cal issues of the nature of reality; but this is not so. For I mean to suggest that art entities are purely phenomenal not in the pre- objective sense that has vexed constructional systems with the problems of abstraction from particulars or of concretion from qualities, but rather in a post-objective sense, as constructions placed on intersubjective aspects of entities that have been pre- viously identified as concrete, however that prior identification is understood. The component elements of such constructions are indeed qualia, which are indeed with one another in concreta, in Goodman's senses. But as qualia they are retreads of previously</page><page sequence="4">NELSON GOODMAN'S LANGUAGES OF ART 543 identified qualities, and the entities they determine are not con- creta at all, but structures of selected, discriminated, and quantized relations of qualia in ordered successions of distinct concreta. In this sense, our phenomenalistic constructions of works of art would begin where Carnap's and Goodman's constructions of the world would terminate, had they been completed. Sounds, then, are not part of music, however essential they are to its transmission. And neither are paint, pigment, or canvas parts of paintings, nor masses of bronze parts of sculptures, nor pages and letters parts of poems. Sounds, in fact, are not even what musical notation specifies, a matter which Goodman seemingly overlooks in his discussion of such notation in Languages of Art. What scores do specify is information about music-structural components, such as pitches, relative attack-times, relative durations, and whatever other quale-categorical information is functionally relevant. Thus it may be said that the notations of scores determine their interpret- ing musical works, and the performances thereof, to varying degrees and in varying respects, depending on the identity of the function- ing quale-categories and on quantization thresholds that are func- tional within each category. So the varying determinacies of score-notations with respect to various quale-categories at different music-historical junctures, which Goodman engages in his chapter on music in Languages of Art, simply correspond to the degrees of structural functionality that are at maximum assignable to those categories in those com- positions, at least on the evidence of their scores. "Precision" of notation is, of course, relative to inferred "thresholds"; and a piece whose pitch notation specifies only "relative height" may be one where pitch-relational characteristics function only to within "higher-than" determinations. Thus such a notation would con- strain the appropriate interpretations just to within the "higher- than" boundary criterion without any lack of music-structural "precision." For any interpretation conforming to such a criterion contains precisely "the" correct pitch-structural information for that piece. Now this means that our present pitch notation is not necessarily more precise relative to the piece it notates than, say, that of pre- Gregorian chant, but only that what counts as compliance to it of interpreting sounds may be inferred as being more highly con- strained with respect to their pitch components, and thus that our music may be interpreted as invoking discriminable pitch dif- ferences more determinately than just in terms of "higher than."</page><page sequence="5">544 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY But even so, what will count as compliance to even a supposedly "precisely" notated score is relative to a theory of the structure of the work with reference to which the score-performance relation is evaluated. It is in the nonrecognition of this music-structural theory-dependence of compliance that I think Goodman goes wrong in his explication of musical notation. For whatever the notation involved, a listener to early church music conditioned to more precisely quantized pitch-functional music such as our own might infer that he was hearing two different pieces in successive performances that, under the pitch-quantizational concepts being used by the performers, were also noticeable as being performances of the same piece. One reason for this perplexity is, of course, that it is sound-successions rather than notations that are the real sym- bolic languages of music; and notes require prior music-structural interpretation to be regarded as music-determinately symbolic of sounds. Thus a listener from an Eastern culture, learning that a given notation represented two attacks of the same pitch, might hear a Western-culturally "correct" realization of that notation as an "incorrect" succession of two different pitches, because his back- ground pitch-structural vocabulary was more finely quantized than ours. For pitch-function assignments are contextual, and take place within thresholds that in practice enable such apparent anomalies as the assignment of discriminably different pitches to identical pitch functions, and of indiscriminable pitches to different pitch functions, depending on the structural context. Similarly, the difference of a G#-versus-Ab notational problem as it arises with respect to a piano score and as it arises in connec- tion with a violin score is not, as Goodman seems to believe, a question about pitch-function difference, but only an observation of the inflectional room left by our traditional quantizations of pitch- functional thresholds. Similar differences within a piano-score reali- zation are assigned the status of "out-of-tuneness," which can be determinately distinguished from "wrong-pitchness" only by the operation of a background pitch-function reference. Thus the notational question raised by Goodman of the relation of "wrong pitches" to "genuine instances of a musical work" is tied to the structural question of what constitutes a "wrong note" with respect to a given work. For the theory of the structure of that work, which is, first of all, requisite to determine what that work's identity is, will interpret some wrong notes as wronger than others, disenabling any correlation of "degree of nongenuineness</page><page sequence="6">NELSON GOODMAN'S LANGUAGES OF ART 545 as an instance of a work" with "number of noncompliant sounds presented." To give a crude example, say that one's theory of some work's pitch structure constructs it by means of just three pitch functions, which we may call "high," "middle," and "low." Then the structural limits within which notation-determinably wrong notes may still be part of a "wholly correct" performance of that piece might be considerably wider than the notationally deter- mined limits; but such structural limits would still be non-indiffer- ent to the question of "wrong-note" determination, even after that question had passed out of the range of the notational limits. Moreover, the compliances determined by a figured-bass notation and a free-cadenza notation are similarly theoretical. By Goodman's purely notational criterion, only a failure to observe actually notated "facts" counts as a "mistake"; but a music-structural theory will extend from what is notated to what is interpolated, and, for any given performance, will determine how what is not specified is constrained by what is specified such that literal compliance to the specified entities is no more or less determinate of "correctness of realization" than is the appropriateness of what is chosen to inter- vene between them. Thus I would argue that Goodman's avoidance of music-struc- tural questions in talking of musical notation is not so much frivolous as impracticable; and in fact his own discussion does not fail to be, however inadvertently, music-theoretical. For what he tells us about the limits of determinability of compliance-classes for John Cage's notations is pure music criticism, since it really tells us what the limits of music-structural determinacy in Cage's com- positions are likely to be, with predictable consequences for the particularity those compositions are likely to be able to exihibit as musical structures. On the other hand, Goodman's allographic-autographic distinc- tion is obviously useful; indeed, the problem of pure "autographical- ness" has already arisen in connection with some forms of electroni- cally performed music, although computer-synthesized electronic performances use a numerical, musically interpretable, allographic notation. Now if my account of musical structure can be taken as art-typi- cal, it implies that the "actual psychological processes" which Quine allows that rational reconstructions may "hint at" are, in the case of art entities, in fact crucially determined by those reconstruc- tions. The path and content of a hierarchical construction of an art entity, through progressive subentity articulation, determine the</page><page sequence="7">546 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY content of that entity in the only sense in which it may be said to have a content as a work of art. And the more such a construction proceeds through relational concepts defined in a maximally open way, consistent with the retention of the intuitive concepts involved, the more different-appearing things may be subsumed as inter- pretations of the same concepts, and, hence, the more works may be commensurable at the more levels of their construction. For a perceiver, this engenders the capacity both to "understand" a greater number of more unlike-appearing things as instances of a single art-entity domain, and to regard each such thing as a more individuated thing within its domain. This consideration engages the most general art-theoretical aspects of Languages of Art. For it is crucial to the argument of Languages of Art, as to the above remarks, that what the observer brings to his perception of a work in the way of predisposition is a crucial determinant of what he perceives therein. But my remarks raise the additional question whether some aspects of what a given perceiver might bring to such a perception might not count toward the competence of that perception, as a perception of a, or in par- ticular of that, work of art, and whether some other aspects of what such a perceiver might bring might not count as irrelevant thereto. A rough analogy may be the relevance of English-under- standing to the perception of an utterance as an English sentence, as against the relevance to that perception of a disposition to regard English utterances as "sad-sounding." This suggests that some kinds of "non-innocence" may be more sophisticated than others, where art-perceptual competence is con- cerned; and although Goodman and I seem to agree that relevant non-innocence involves previous experience of artwork perception, I would insist additionally that it also requires that such experience of artworks be of them as artworks. Thus, in analyzing ascriptions made to artworks, we might dis- tinguish between those which are relevant to them as artworks and those which are not. The issue is related to that of the interpretability and applicability of theoretical terms. Sometimes, for example, it might seem from the form of an ascriptive discourse that evidence of a certain type-for example, observations on the perceptual data of a work of art-could influence the determination of a truth-value assignment of a given use of a predicating term, when in fact it could not. In other words, we might distinguish terms whose uses make a difference to our perception of a thing from a certain point of view, from those whose uses matter only in the context of some other point of view.</page><page sequence="8">NELSON GOODMAN'S LANGUAGES OF ART 547 To take a simple example, compare the ascriptions to, say, something identified as "Beethoven's Eighth Symphony" of 'This is sad' and 'This is in F major'. Now it would be as absurd to decide the question "This is in F major" by an audience poll as it would be to decide "This is sad" by surveying the musical data.1 In which case, then, are we making a statement "about" Beethoven's Eighth Symphony? A popular way to resolve the issue has been to say that the referents in the two cases are different, as those of 'book' might be in two possible uses of 'This is a weighty book'. But here the problem is deeper; for how is the "this" being identified in the first place in the case of "This is sad"? The "book" model breaks down here, for no observation comparable to that which could confirm a porter's report that something was a weighty book could be brought to bear. And to bring the point closer to Goodman's investigations, how does an ascription like 'high note' differ from one like 'sad piece'? Goodman methodologi- cally equates the 'is a red book"-"is a novel" type of disjunction of our earlier example with this latter case: he suggests that "Calling a picture sad and calling it gray are simply different ways of classify- ing it." But what competence is invoked in declaring a picture "sad"? Not "psychological," since that would have to do with making assignments by observing correlations with other people's assignments, not by observing as they do. I find a clue to this per- plexity in our musical example: a "high note" is understandable as a hypostatization of observable relations of "higher than"; whereas "sadder than" is just as inscrutible as "sad." Another clue may be that such predications as 'sad', of pieces, are invariably re- stricted to familiar musical domains, such as tonal pieces, whereas the pieces in unfamiliar domains like, for example, twelve-tone pieces, are more often described as "noisy" or in some other way that simply reports failure to ascribe identity. The latter case seems to provide the better clue; for I think that the "this"-identification underlying the "This is sad" ascription is just a hidden music-theoretical one of the "This is in F major" type, 1 Goodman describes me (in his Reply, 567) as a "formalist" to whom "the ac- tual structure of the work is all that matters." But since what I call "musical structure" is just the coherent juxtaposition of everything relevant to the iden- tity of a musical work, I can't see what an "exclusive concern with musical struc- ture" excludes. And I cannot imagine, as a practitioner of music, what signifi- cance might be attributed to a property of which it could be said that "works differing widely in detail may have the same property of sadness" (568, emphasis mine); the notion of "details that don't matter" in the ascription of properties to a work would seem to have a legitimate place only in an aesthetics of the im- mediate, such as is disclaimed by Goodman in the first paragraph of his reply, or in a study of art as inattentively or casually observed.</page><page sequence="9">548 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY just as the "picture" referred to in the activity of "calling a pic- ture sad" is in a prior sense the picture that was called gray. Now this means that the whole act of identification that underlies a "this-is-sad"-type ascription to works of art is, in fact, located in the data-discriminative domain relevant to the particularization of things as entities of certain types. As predications in those do- mains, the status of such ascriptions is thus as mere "proper names." For they are intelligible only as ascriptions to things to which prior, if hidden, recognition has been given as entities of the structural kind; but as ascriptions with regard to those structures, they are empty, in that they make no discernible difference. Whether these ascriptions are metaphorical or not is, moreover, immaterial in the same sense; as defined predicates, they are sys- tematically indifferent under explication: "higher than" could be called "lower than," as it was by the ancient Greeks, or "greener than," or "greater than," or "left of," without affecting the music- identifying question. The etymologies of metaphors, their "schema- transferring" attributes investigated by Goodman, are heuristically useful just to the degree that the transferred term-names can be determinately correlated with observables. Thus Goodman's ex- plication seems essentially to enable the elimination of metaphors as special "types" of ascriptions to works of art. And in this light, the only problem with 'sad' is that we simply have nothing observa- tional to tie it to in either music or painting, and so it makes no difference to the music- or painting-identity of anything. In use, however, such "proper names" have negative value, since they serve to perpetuate the internalization of a perceiver's theoretical scheme and, hence, to minimize his competence. The world of the average listener contains very little music and a great deal of noise, a gap which he tends to cover by the invocation of picturesque place- holding slogans. But to a sophisticated observer, the space thus straddled is filled with so many determinate particulars producing such particular identities that the sloganizing terms actually do seem hopelessly inapplicable. Like prescientific attributions, to natural phenomena, of anthropomorphic and volitional characteristics, predications like 'sad' of art simply symptomatize an underprivileged stage of cogni- tion, not a category thereof. How cogent, I wonder, would philoso- phers find the assertion about The Structure of Appearance that it was "colorful"? But to call such predicates "supervenient terms" or "slogans" is only to characterize their inapplicability to art, not to explicate their</page><page sequence="10">NELSON GOODMAN S LANGUAGES OF ART 549 cognitivity in any respect. To understand their cognitive status, however, I believe it is necessary to look to those domains where metaphorical schema transfer is part of the determinate identity of structures, namely, to the arts of language, as exemplified in literary structures. For paintings are represented by predicates like 'sad' in literary works as objects are represented by color-patch structures in paintings, not as paintings are objects. This last observation invites a confrontation with Goodman's no- tion of representation. Here again, I think that the epistemological interest of the explication is quite independent of its relevance to art-theoretical concerns. For the problem in ascribing representation to works of art as a primary attribute thereof is not uninterpret- ability or inapplicability, but grossness. Most of the attributes that distinguish a painting as a particular painting lie below the level at which representation is predicable of it; the situation is rather like that of predicating 'a gas' of something where what was im- portant was how it was a gas, whether it was helium or oxygen, for example. Hence I suspect that Goodman's principal interest was to explicate representation, rather than paintings. Otherwise I can- not understand why he would take such a complex "fact" about a painting as that it "represents something thus" as virtually "atomic" for it, without investigating what particularizes, determinately, that representation with respect to any other. For to say just that "away- ness up" and "awayness forward" are "differently represented" from each other in a given literature of paintings is not to characterize what constitute the palpable determinants of even the observation that in a given single painting "things receding upward are repre- sented as parallel and things receding forward are represented as convergent." That is, is not the level at which color areas articulate the visual space itself a distinctive determinant-for each single case -of the particular identity which is only loosely classified as "paral- lelism" or "convergence"? Music's failure to represent, of course, has happily always been an embarrassment to the art-as-representational thesis. On the other hand, traditional music does reveal, at a comparable level of gross- ness, an observational characteristic that corresponds to representa- tion in painting; namely, "thematicism." In both cases, it seems to me, such entities as "themes" and "represented things" are best understood as subglobal structural frameworks that enclose com- plex sets of quale-relations in mnemonically convenient form, as advantageous strategies in the optimal communication of the often</page><page sequence="11">550 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY highly complex structural identities of the global structures they articulate. As to the predicate 'picture of x', this, like the "theme" of a symphony or the fact that it is in "Sonata Form," can be eliminated altogether as a special stage in the subentity ascension. As part of such an ascension, it is merely a "proper name" for a defined predicate, with more or less heuristic value; as such, it may also function as a conceit, constraining the limits of what would count as an appropriate resultant, much as the "Mickey-Mousing" of literary texts in songs provides such external constraints. But as a significant individuating term for paintings, 'picture of x' seems to me only slightly beyond the level of 'oil painting', 'landscape', 'portrait', or 'abstraction'. Thus, again, I find that Goodman's explication enables rather the elimination of a notion than its invocation as a significant factor in the construction of art entities. What, then, do art entities express? Ideas of relation, I think, particular coherences, in analog form; and what they exemplify are their structures. That is, works of art may be regarded as analog models of closed formal-systematic structures whose interpreting entities express the relations of the formal-systematic entities through patterns of relative quantity of perceptual qualities, such qualities being quantitatively articulated by scales of measurement chosen by a perceiver. A "scientist" constructs an experiment to test "his" structure of the world against the measurable facts of obser- vation, on the scales of magnitude relevant to the properties being tested for. The experimental complex is strategically designed to extrude optimally those properties regarded as critical. The compo- sition of works of art may be described as the definition and creation of relational "universes" of elements in whose interrela- tions are embedded hypothetical properties of relational behavior; hypotheses, that is, of "what can be learned to be observed" on the basis of what has already, by appropriate receptors, been learned to be observed. And, ultimately, it is the reasonable possibility that, from the data he specifies, the relational properties he has em- bedded will be the "most favorably inferrable" things, that justifies the artist's "experiment." In art, of course, all the "measuring in- struments" are perceptual, not physical; but their measurements, on the quantizati'onal scales needed to infer all the significatively em- bedded properties, are as precise and unambiguous as those of the scientist-which is not surprising, since the data relations were de- signed in the first place to be measured by perceptual instruments. Moreover, the relation of the "analog" state of non-art-theo-</page><page sequence="12">NELSON GOODMAN'S LANGUAGES OF ART 551 retical quality perception to a syntactically and semantically inter- preted perception of those qualities as components of art entities seems to me to explicate the relation between what may be termed "aesthetic experience," on the one hand, and "art," on the other. I would liken an "aesthetic experience" to an informal act of "quasi- analysis," in which the component qualities of concrete entities rather than their gross entityhood are what is being taken note of. Noticing the sunset as a certain confluence of a certain red over a certain spatial extension, etc., is an activity of the "aesthetic" type. Art, on the other hand, uses these quasi-analytically derived qualities as materials with which to build structures, whose syn- tactically differentiated and discontinuous elements are semantically interpreted by qualia that are degree-ordered into differentiated and discontinuous vocabularies. Here, of course, I am engaging Goodman's explication of the digital-analog relation (157-173), which is for me not only the most enlightening passage of Languages of Art, but that which seems most directly to enable the connection of art-entity construction with the constructions of The Structure of Appearance. But Goodman does not specify how the connection is to be made, nor does he otherwise take note of it. The final question that I want to engage with respect to Lan- guages of Art is the analogy between verbal and art-symbolic languages proposed by Goodman. Again, we seem to invoke quite disparate desiderata and, accordingly, to arrive at quite different conclusions. Goodman locates the analogy in the problematic area of reference, the aboutness of language. This assignment seems en- tirely consistent with his concern, throughout Languages of Art, with representation, expression, and the "comprehension of our worlds" to which he refers. He replaces Oscar Wilde's epigram about art and life with a stronger one of his own: "Nature is the product of art and discourse." And throughout the book, the discus- sion centers on what is in works of art, while never once addressing the question of what works of art are. Although he never says so explicitly, I wonder whether, as a non- specialist, Goodman felt constrained to attempt a cognitive explica- tion of what is commonly said about art rather than one of art itself, limiting himself to a rational analysis of popular notions about art, as reflected in traditional aesthetics and the critical and journalistic literature, rather than attempting to explicate the identities of artworks from a rational analysis of their perceptual attributes directly. In any case, the trouble with regarding works of art as primarily</page><page sequence="13">552 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY about the world is that they are in the first place of the world. And in the sense that the world is what communicates through lan- guage-dependent perception, art works surely add themselves to the world and use the ways that the world communicates to communi- cate themselves. The issue of the languageness of the languages of art clears, moreover, if we turn from the aboutness of language to the special entityness of verbal-linguistic things, which, like art things, are entities just by virtue of being inferred as such from aspects of concreta filtered through a syntax and a semantics. As such, they may be mentally experienced as thought; the same, I believe, is true of art entities. And the absence of "aboutness" in the languages of the musical and visual arts, at least, frees them from the constraints of conventional norms of syntactical and lexical formation and association. As a result, they are free to create their own norms contextually from much simpler perceptual-assumptive bases. Hence, for example, works of music are constructable from a general no- tion of "music" without the essential intervention of stages identi- fied as, say, "tonal" or "twelve-tone," which would be analogous to the construction of a particular English utterance wholly from a system that defines "language" in general, without the essential intervention of an English dictionary or grammar. Thus the structures of the "contextual" arts are like man-made possible "mini-worlds," perceivable and palpable, and yet not con- strained by the exigencies and recalcitrances of the physical, con- strained only by the bounds of human perceptual and intellectual capacities, which are thereby both demonstrated and expanded. This, it seems to me, is essentially the awareness that the epistemol- ogy of The Structure of Appearance has contributed to the theory of art, locating the relevant focus of such theory in the activity of entification and particularization by means of conceptually guided systematic construction. Therefore, that art has fed back into the epistemology of Lan- guages of Art mainly in the form of a referential theory is something I find deeply perplexing, and earnestly hope that Profes- sor Goodman's remarks will help to explain. For even linguistic entities refer only by virtue of linguistic interpretation, so that, like art entities, they are something before they do anything. And I thought it was from Goodman himself that we had learned most lucidly that just being something is doing plenty already. BENJAMIN BORETZ Columbia University</page></plain_text>
