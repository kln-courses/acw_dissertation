Wennemyr INTRODUCTION This paper might also be entitled "Confessions of an Ex-Deconstruction- ist." In 1989 in a routine lecture for master's degree candidates at Chicago something remarkable happened in row 6, seat 3: An a-slash-believer was born. On the edge of my seat I listened spellbound as David Tracy reiterated Mark C. Taylor's cutting remarks in the Prelude of Erring: "Though consistently monotheistic," Tracy read from Taylor, "Christian theology is repeatedly inscribed in binary terms. The history of religious thought in the West can be read as a pendular movement between seem- ingly exclusive and evident opposites." Then came the list of the polarities that constrain our thought. It included the dyads of Sanity/Madness, Purity/Stain, Honesty/Duplicity, and-most challenging of all-"Good/ Evil." Tracy, reading Taylor, continued, "[Theology] refuses to allow the possibility that oppositional terms can coexist peacefully. Invariably one term is privileged through the divestment of its relative. The resultant Susan E. Wennemyr is Lecturer in Religious Studies and Dean of Davenport College at Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520. *An early version of this paper was delivered to the International Literature and Theology Conference "The Trace of the Other" at Westminister College in Oxford, England, on September 12, 1996. 571</page><page sequence="2">572 Journal of the American Academy of Religion economy of privilege sustains an asymmetrical hierarchy in which one member governs or rules the other throughout the theological, logical, axiological, and even political domains" (1984: 8, 9). Upon reading Erring I found that the construction of philosophical dyads was an elaborate unconscious scheme to deny death. My conversion was complete; I knew that my own deepest secrets had been found out and publicly aired (by a professional confessor, no less). I would do anything to repent. Any theory that exposes mortality anxiety and feigns to explain it has a certain grip over a reader. Soon I realized that, as I preached my newfound Gospel According to Taylor, there were points along the way at which I had to talk fast, hoping my listener would not catch the huge leap made in the argument I articulated. I intend in this work to identify those leaps of faith, the points in Taylor's thought, as spelled out in Erring, at which it is necessary to trust claims that are by no means self-evident or clearly established. We are then free to leap if we like, but to do so with open eyes. Otherwise, we might suppose we are simply meandering down a path of common sense that leads by surprise to a slippery oasis of un- conventional wisdom. The first leap is the ascription of social and logical hierarchies to an unconscious template of being and non-being. The second is the belief that the impossibility of a transcendental signified implies the death of God. Third, I will argue that one must render nega- tion absolute to follow one of Taylor's two quite different responses to Hegelian logic. Finally, I will identify in Taylor's privileging of fragments a failure to apply the epistemology of perspectivalism that he elsewhere endorses. This is not the first essay to wrestle with Taylor's a/theology, though this piece focuses more than most on particular claims made in the pro- gression of Taylor's argument rather than on the overarching Gestalt of his conclusions. With a wider-angle lens, critical portraits of Taylor have been made by Wesley Kort, Stephen Webb, Peter Hodgson, and Walter Lowe. Kort faults Taylor (and most other theologians) for claiming to have found objects of discourse that are, in fact, created by the discourse itself (1, 3); for positing a "total terrain" of shared texts that all readers do not actually share (39-40); for emphasizing the spatial at the expense of the temporal (40); and for "dissolving all differences into a vast and com- mon field of crisscrossing and mutually canceling meaning" (41). Webb argues that Taylor "radicalizes God's immanence in order to emphasize not exchange but gratuity, to the point where excess becomes ubiquitous and thus meaningless" (90). Hodgson finds meaningful mediating theol- ogy impossible if one accepts with Taylor the death of God and the end of history (1991:36-37). Lowe, while often concurring with Taylor, finds a dubious ethic implied by Taylor, one that glorifies the condition of "exile"</page><page sequence="3">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 573 at the very time that refugees face a legitimate need for their homes, a need that Taylor belittles (134). Exceptionally grounded in a close reading, Kevin Hart rejects Taylor in favor of Derrida as a resource for discern- ing how deconstruction can inform a theology that is more sensitive to religious experience and less tainted by the influence of Altizer and Nietz- sche (47). Like these other critics, the present author focuses on Erring as Tay- lor's most philosophically lucid work. This text was pivotal in Taylor's development, marking decisively his move away from Hegelian dialectics. Before the phase launched by Erring, "Taylor tries to bring Hegel and Kierkegaard together and concludes that we can attain unity within plu- rality, Being within becoming, identity within difference" (Wyschogrod: 524). This progression from the early to the later Taylor is spelled out in the third critique below. Of the texts that follow this transition, Erring is selected for its supreme clarity, the product of Taylor's possible overstate- ment of his position in this work. Subsequent volumes by Taylor amp- lify the themes set out in this text, applying them to other postmodern thinkers and cultural phenomena, but they do not chart a new conceptual direction as drastic as the one heralded by the production of Erring itself. I. THE AETIOLOGY OF HIERARCHY Taylor sets out to account for the fact that human social behavior includes the constant establishment of hierarchies. Indeed, while he re- fuses the label "ethicist," his seemingly arcane concerns ultimately con- stitute an appeal that people be treated with dignity. The question that torments Taylor is the one he voices in Altarity: "Are others who are dif- ferent to be converted, integrated, dominated, excluded, or repressed?" (xxi). It is to protect the disenfranchised other that Taylor identifies the vast array of conceptual dualisms that permeate western thought. By re-tracing the conceptual crime behind social relations of domination, Taylor hopes to expose a scandalous system, nipping domination in its pro-verbial bud. Let us take just one of these conceptual crimes for our test case: the drawing of a distinction between sanity and madness. Taylor sees the establishment of this conceptual dichotomy as the second step in a tri- partite move that traces social domination to unconscious motives. Sum- marizing Taylor's prelude to Erring, that movement goes something like this: 1. First: the fantasy. Unconsciously, I fear my own inevitable non-being, which is assured by my mortal nature. True to Freud, I will do anything</page><page sequence="4">574 Journal of the American Academy of Religion to facilitate the fantasy that I will live forever. This overriding fear establishes in my unconscious mind a fundamental dichotomy be- tween being and non-being. My wish is to identify with being as mine and to disown non-being as not-me. 2. Second: intra-psychic wish-fulfillment. To make this imagined im- mortality more credible, and because my Lacanian mind is structured like a language, I divide everything in my midst into mutually exclusive categories, identifying with one and disavowing the other. One of each pair, in this case "sanity," represents to my unconscious mind "being"; the other-here, "madness"-is identified with non-being. Being and non-being define the template; all other predicates with which I iden- tify represent to my unconscious mind "being" (in the case of the favored predicate) or non-being (in the case of its opposite). The cate- gories must be mutually exclusive, or else I would have to see the fluid interdependence within my own person of sanity and madness, and ultimately of my own intimate involvement with being and non-being alike. Luckily, I am not alone in my conspiracy, as I am educated in western schools that long ago rejected the revelrous Bacchus and Hera- clitus in favor of the stodgy Aristotle and Socrates. Aristotle in particu- lar provides the logical underpinnings for the belief that two opposite predicates cannot both describe the same person in the same sense at a given time. 3. Third: social wish-fulfillment. This self-protective logical apparatus informs my social behavior. It motivates me to identify with "sanity" (which is affiliated with being to my unconscious mind) and to pro- ject onto others "madness" (associated with non-being). If I can then dominate the mad person, my satisfaction is complete: I am controlling death itself! Social hierarchies that justify this act of domination follow from these dynamics of projection. As Taylor portrays this progression, what was first an exercise in anxiety abatement has as a consequence the formulation of truth-claims about the self, world, and other that are socially destructive, wish-fulfill- ing, and misrepresentative (whatever misrepresentation means to a de- constructionist). This account of how psychic needs lead to social domi- nation is a compelling and familiar one. Anyone schooled in Freud or Jung will recognize the dynamics of projection generally, if not the mean- ing assigned to each projection specifically. I challenge it only to prevent us from adopting it precisely because it is so familiar as to seem beyond question to postmodern minds. First, the argument I have outlined begins with the ascription of a motive: We WANT to deny death. All that purportedly ensues from that</page><page sequence="5">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 575 desire-the creation of dichotomous predications, the projection onto the social other-is thereby suspect. For Taylor as for Freud, if it feels good, it must be a deceptive construct of humans imposed on an other- wise innocent order of things. In any other area of critical thought-say, a court of law-the identification of a motive is not sufficient for a convic- tion. And so we must ask Taylor: Where is the smoking gun? This very question leads to my second critique of Taylor's account of hierarchy. The "smoking gun" that we seek is precisely an unconscious mind at work-first constructing predicates that it traces to a template of being and non-being and then building an identity around the privileged of those predicates. I ask: Does the unconscious mind really do this? Are all other predicates-to the unconscious mind-smokescreens for being and non-being? To say so, we must accept many assumptions: A) Intellectual truth-claims are the slave of the unconscious mind. B) Within that master- slave relationship one desire alone has extraordinary power over our intel- lectual constructions. C) It is not possible that another deep need-say, the desire for creativity-is comparably influential, somehow interfering in the predication process set up by mortality anxiety. As Walter Lowe has noted, Taylor's account of projection quickly becomes "a denial of any- thing other or anything more" (135). Clearly these assumptions presume answers to questions that cannot be answered, and that is precisely my point. It is deceptive of deconstructive discourse to describe the trickery that it ascribes to the unconscious mind as an obvious fact to those with insider's knowledge of something that is subtle, rhetorical, and French. Third, even if social domination results from the desire to control mortality, it is not clear that deconstruction itself is free of this desire. The one fact that most clearly indicts me as a mortal creature is my natality. Birth is that other endpoint of the lifespan, bringing me into the world from I know not where. In Taylor's own repeated insistence that we create by interpreting images' and that the self is nothing but an image, does he not also paint us as creators of ourselves, allowing us momentarily to for- get that the bodies that contain our interpreting brains are born of that over which we have no control? When Taylor in this way slips into the humanistic romanticism that he elsewhere refutes, he too puts forth a view of human nature that would bring some relief to those anxious about their mortality. 1 Taylor usually falls short of actually conflating the Kantian noumenal and phenomenal realms, making the more modest claim that we only have access to the linguistic, the always-already- interpreted. Nevertheless, he does often get carried away and dismiss the noumenal altogether. Fur- thermore, it would follow from his dismissal of dualism that the phenomenal/noumenal distinction too must ultimately collapse. Indeed, in Erring Taylor affirms that "the inner world is phenomenal" (1984:176; cf. 178). As Lowe points out, Taylor is inconsistent in his reduction of the actual to the apparent, sometimes insisting upon "the Derridean reality" (135).</page><page sequence="6">576 Journal of the American Academy of Religion II. GOD AS TRANSCENDENTAL SIGNIFIED Taylor's treatment of language derives from both Saussure and Der- rida. Adopting Saussure directly, Taylor regards language as a chain of sig- nifiers with the purpose of pointing to intended referents (which he exposes as themselves inevitably linguistic). With Derrida he insists that this process is more slippery than we suppose: To understand the defini- tion of one referent, we must look up the words used in that definition and so on ad infinitum. No definition is final (though etymological roots do appear more equal than other referents). What I am terming the leap of faith in Taylor's work is his inference from this feature of language; it proves, he believes, that the God of the Jewish and Christian traditions is "dead"-not only meaningless to us but altogether absent as transcen- dent, omnipotent, or omniscient creator. Taylor is clear in his claim that language as reference fails. It stub- bornly refuses to satisfy the wish ascribed to structuralists-of yielding to univocal meaning "(a)s one progresses from surface to depth" (1990: 149). To pretend that language can do what it cannot is to taunt the desire of the reader for totality and closure, providing a "fix" that does not "cure" (1984: 91). A better physician, in his book, would leave the reader to discover a better medicine: the crucial lesson that language is inevitably riddled with gaps, the need of further cross-reference and circuitous turns requiring great imagination. The only honest writing in this school of thought is self-acclaimed literature that makes no pretense of representing a system that ultimately reduces being to one definitive interpretation. The leap then taken follows from Taylor's acceptance of the linguistic turn: The impossibility of Derrida's transcendental signified is said to cor- respond to an impossibility of a divine ground of Being in a dimension of depth. As with language, so with being: The free-floating, endless play of associations characterizing language indicates the labyrinth of mutually reflected surfaces that endlessly mirror the matrix of being and non-being in which we live. For this reason, when he asks What's the Point? in Chap- ter 10 of Tears, Taylor plants a double entendre in which seeking a "point" qua existential meaning is abandoned precisely when we give up hope of finding a "point" at which reference would come to rest. Taylor deduces the death of a Christian God from the impossibility of a transcendental signified because both offer a resting place that defies further playful, de-substantiating searching. He casts a bridge between the tradition's God and Derrida's transcendental signified by identifying "God" with "Word." As Altizer has observed, "Following the recent work of Robert P. Scharlemann, Taylor can assert that God is what word means, and word is what 'God' means" (527). In this spirit, Taylor terms the writ-</page><page sequence="7">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 577 ten page-with its interdependent text and margins, its words sparking unending associations-the "divine milieu." Surely, however, the biblical God of the Jewish and Christian tradi- tions also differs significantly from the transcendental signified. Yes, Augustine prays to this God for stability and rest, but there the resem- blance to the transcendental signified ends. The God of Christian scrip- ture does not enjoy the complete transparency and presence of the transcendental signified. Hodgson astutely points out that "[t]he theo- logical tradition never entertained the illusion that divine presence was totally, immediately available. It knew that ... God would be 'all in all' only at the eschaton" (1991:37). Moreover, while the image of the deity evolves within the biblical texts, one can say with considerable confidence that the scriptural God of this tradition is a Creator with whom covenants are made. Wrath and mercy are ascribed to this God, as are interventions in human history. In this way scriptural language is anthropomorphic in describing God, while Taylor's talk of "mazing grace" in the "divine milieu" is not. A deconstructionist could argue that his model of divine- human relation is a de-mythologization of such accounts, but Taylor does not make that argument. As a result, the transcendental signified and the God preached by Jesus bear very little likeness whatsoever. To bring lin- guistic theory to bear on theology, Taylor has had to create a straw man. In Taylor's divine milieu of writing, the term divine is a tricky one. It clearly does not refer to any traditional theist's God. Given that Taylor rejects Altizer's immanent God of "total presence," however, it is hard to see that there remains any content whatsoever to a god of which "divine" is the adjective. It follows that "divine" is used only rhetorically and not theologically, as one would say that chocolate mousse is "simply divine." The death of God that Taylor deduces from the impossibility of a tran- scendental signified is a strong death; it refers not merely to our incom- prehension, but also to the final Feuerbachian realization that our talk of God for all these years was factually mistaken. I wholeheartedly agree that the transcendental signified is an impos- sible dream. My response as a theologian, however, is simply "So what?" One need not resort to a realist's account of language to defend the possi- bility of the biblical God of Judaism and Christianity. Even if some variety of realism is necessary to Christian theology, it is a caricature of the tradi- tion to imagine that it has rendered God as non-elusive as the transcen- dental signified. Indeed, ever enshrouded in mystery, the biblical God would be a notable contrast to, rather than a prime example of, this lin- guistic endpoint to human reference. Truer to the tradition is Walter Lowe's argument that the God of Christianity is the "other" par excellence (33-47). Whether realist or nominalist, inferring anything theologically</page><page sequence="8">578 Journal of the American Academy of Religion from the failed quest for referential closure is to make a leap of faith, to assume that language delimits the sphere of ontological possibility. III. IS NEGATION ABSOLUTE? Taylor's reflections on the logic of theology are carried out in relation to Aristotle and Hegel. Early in his career Taylor rejected Aristotle's law of non-contradiction in favor of allegedly Hegelian dialectics.2 While Aris- totle squarely refuted the possibility that opposites could coexist, Hegel's Aufhebung-the product of the dialectical process alleged both to pre- serve and to cancel the thesis-promised the coincidence of opposites that he sought. We find this early Taylor-cum-Hegelian writing in De- constructing Theology: "Instead of analyzing and separating into discrete parts, dialectical reason synthesizes and integrates into internally differ- entiated wholes that simultaneously maintain the differences identified, but incorrectly interpreted, by analytic understanding" (57). Such is his early faith in dialectics. In the period that begins with the writing of Erring Taylor shifts away from Hegel as the guarantor of difference. Taylor realized that the method of Hegelian dialectics (which is application of negation at every step of the dialectical progression) precluded its self-acclaimed goal of reaching Aufhebung. Rather, the method of applying negation is now critiqued because it converts the negativity of the antithesis into affirmation of the thesis through double negation; the seeming synthesis is but a mirror image of the thesis, delivering only narcissistic satisfaction. In the imagi- nation of the dialectician, the later Taylor tells us, "[n]egation is always negated, loss inevitably turns to profit,"' so that "[w] hen properly under- stood, the empty tomb is not a sign of absence but is a token of resur- rected presence" (1984:228). (Contrast this to his pre-1984 faith that the dialectical "process of double negation" allows "opposite relata" to "coin- here" (1982:101).) In this time Taylor has also been influenced by Deleuze, so that the ideal of "cancelling and preserving" the identities of both the thesis and antithesis is now seen as overly ambitious, as it denies the irre- producibility of the moment. This realization drives the final nail into the coffin of the Hegelian Taylor. In his retreat from Hegel, however, the later Taylor turns in two different directions, one of which makes negation absolute. 2 I say "allegedly" to call attention to Walter Kaufmann's argument that Fichte actually traced the progression of ideas through the stages of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, whereas Hegel displayed only an inordinate fondness for tripartite structures generally. Taylor-who must have read Kauf- mann, as he footnotes him in Nots-freely admits that he is misreading Hegel but uses this misread- ing for heuristic purposes. Taylor acknowledges in Erring that "Kierkegaard willfully misreads Hegel as a philosopher of identity whose System is finally totalitarian" (99).</page><page sequence="9">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 579 The first response of the later Taylor to Hegelian dialectics is to aspire to a more successful coincidentia oppositorum, one modeled on Derrida's diffdrance, which alone is purported to salvage Hegel's goal of Aufhebung from Hegel's own method of double negation. With Merleau-Ponty, Tay- lor affirms in Altarity: "There is no good dialectic but that which criticizes itself and surpasses itself as a separate statement; the only good dialectic is the hyperdialectic" (78). Such a hyperdialectic would rest on a Nagarju- nan caricature of logic in which one says of any predicate ascribed to a subject: "both yes and no; neither yes nor no."' With this response to Hegel I find no fault whatsoever. While not as strong a protection of the weak as the traditional Christian category of agape, this de-substantializ- ing move would preclude the conceptual demonization of others that leads to ethnic cleansings. For this Taylor, death is always in life, and life somehow in death, though not in any form resembling "resurrection." The later Taylor, though, finds death always in life but cannot find any rhetorical strategy to affirm life as somehow part of death. That is, he is not consistent in recommending a "hyperdialectic." Elsewhere, in his eagerness to preserve the antithesis-as-other, Taylor affirms the Hegelian antithesis to the exclusion of the thesis, at which point he becomes what he resists, author of a revolution that is "insufficiently radical," "merely putting a minus sign instead of a plus sign before the elements of Western culture" (1984:9). The dichotomy that is treated with a simple inversion of Hegel is the very dyad that he himself deems so influential to all other thought: the personal being and non-being that allegedly form the tem- plate of all our other predications. In his fervor to protect the finality of death Taylor takes a stronger, nihilistic stance. "Death," he insists, "will not be denied" (1984:9). Now we are not to affirm both being and non- being, neither being nor non-being; we are to affirm only non-being as negation. In Taylor's words, in this case we must uphold "affirmation of negation, the affirmation of the negation that is always already within and can thus never finally be negated" (1984:146). Walter Lowe fears for the ethical implications of this Taylor, suspecting that it will allow "the mur- derer" to "have the last word," as Horkheimer feared (134). In this more simplistically anti-Hegelian moment Taylor makes death- as-negation absolute, if the absolute be that which cannot change. Taylor protects negation from being changed into affirmation through the dynamics of double negation. In the case in which life represents affirma- tion and death negation, Taylor insists that negation as non-being gets the last laugh. Here he rejects not only the illusion of immortality but also his 3 Nagarjuna was a second-century Buddhist logician who created the structure of "both . . and/neither ... nor" as a necessary corollary of the de-substantializing impulse in Buddhism.</page><page sequence="10">580 Journal of the American Academy of Religion own claims elsewhere that being and non-being, life and death, are inter- dependent. Is negation absolute, alone excluded from incessant change, interdependence, and fluidity? To say so is to take the third leap of faith that deconstruction demands. IV. ATOMISM AND THE SEMBLANCE OF SOLIDITY Another dichotomy is exempted from Taylor's eradication of dualistic thought structures: the dichotomy of parts and wholes (not mentioned in the list that he provides in the prelude to Erring). If subjected to the Nagar- junan subversion of logic, we would say that a book, for instance, is "both whole and partial, neither partial nor whole." Perspectivalism insists that both possible perceptions in this respect are true in a particular context, so that "both whole and partial" must be affirmed; the same Nietzschean rel- ativism further affirms that neither perception is true from a meta-context of objectivity, so that a book is also "neither whole nor partial." Rather than leading to this affirmation of multiple perspectives and concomitant denial of any one authoritative perspective, however, Taylor deems one perspective superior to others. Parts, fragments, and shards are counted as ultimate throughout Taylor's work. Erring celebrates the termination of "wholes" and the victory of "parts." The death of God re- veals the possibility of an infinitely diverse divine milieu; the "disap- pearance of the self" makes way for understanding persons as anonymous channels of multiple desires; the "end of history" ushers in acceptance of "errant wandering" through many nooks and crannies that we dare not identify as parts of one historical house; and "closure of the book" exposes what has always been the case-that writing resists the type of cohesion that books represent. The constructs constituted by so many parts are consistently denied as wish-fulfilling illusion. In the poignant and fascinating account of his own diabetic condition in Nots Taylor explains the possible confusion of self and other by anti- gens at the cellular level of the immune system. As usual, small is beauti- ful, and cells reveal what bodies conceal: that the boundary between self and other is ever fluid and unstable. Not only is the cellular level exclu- sively recognized in this case, but de-substantiating conclusions are drawn from the condition of cells in an uncommon state of disease. Even if we grant an authority to the cellular level that is denied at the level of the organism, Taylor's own example actually defies his own conclusions. Most of the time cells effectively distinguish "self" from "other" so that not every pregnancy ends in miscarriage and not every life ends through a breakdown of auto-immune functions. If cellular activity be socially normative, then the successful annihilation of invading cells by healthy</page><page sequence="11">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 581 immune systems actually validates a barbaric state of xenophobia, not the openness to difference that is Taylor's cause cclebre. Returning to the question of scale, perspectivalism would not only affirm the perception of whole entities as one of many valid interpre- tations; it would privilege that perception in contexts from which such a reading is the clear and obvious vision. To the naked eye resting in its socket between five and seven feet from the ground, a body looks like one organism; only to an eye coupled with a microscope is this perception challenged by the awareness of multiple organelles and other systems of cellular organization. While acknowledging the context dependence of any reading and thereby debunking any claim to absolutism, perspectival- ism does promote embracing a given reading within a context. Rather than claiming objective truth for any one reading, it simply labels pre- ferred readings as context-appropriate. It follows that the semblance of solidity that is the perception of embodied human beings be not only per- mitted but actually preferred-in the quotidian context. The microscopic perspective is to be preferred within its context, and neither is deemed "ultimately" true. Yet, that is just what Taylor is doing when he lambasts the semblance of solidity in favor of fragments of unspecified scale. Per- spectivalism affirms both the unity and the inner diversity of any unit of observation; Taylor deviates from applying this philosophy when he favors diversity at the expense of unity. USES OF DECONSTRUCTION Is deconstruction thereby to be dismissed as a resource for construing Christian theology? By no means. The "leaps of faith" identified do not impinge on the features of deconstruction that make it fruitful, even essential, for theological discourse. Without accepting the dynamics of projection, the linguistic turn, the identification of "God" with the tran- scendental signified, the absolutizing of negation, or the rejection of the semblance of solidity, there remains a thrust to deconstruction that comes to Anglo-American theological thought as a great gift, much as Babette's feast came as a rejuvenating elixir to the puritanical community whom she astonished with her extravagance. Deconstruction raises a critical question that Christian theology can- not afford to ignore: Is it not entirely possible that the historical accom- modations of Christianity to both Platonic and Aristotlean philosophy in predominant schools of medieval and modern interpretation required a distortion of Christianity such that it might not be recognized by Jesus himself or the first communities of believers? Just two centuries before Paul wrote, the Jews of the Maccabean revolt risked their lives to stave off</page><page sequence="12">582 Journal of the American Academy of Religion a Hellenistic influence that they deemed incompatible with their world- view. Did the Christian reformation of Judaism create changes that sud- denly rendered Hellenistic philosophy more compatible? It is hasty to assume with Taylor that contemporary mystery cults based on pre-Socratic ideologies would have made a more compatible vehicle for conveying Christian teachings. Significantly, Christians distin- guished themselves from the Mithraic and other cults with which they were often confused on the basis of historicity. Jesus actually did descend, preach, die, and rise, they contended, while counterparts in Greek legend clearly did not. Affiliation with Dionysian mythology might particularly obscure what is perhaps the greatest contribution of deconstruction to post-modern Christian theology: its ability to resuscitate the unmistakably Christian themes of kenosis and sacrifice that have been rendered all but unintel- ligible by the modern and postmodern habits of acquisition, preservation, and moderation. The average twentieth-century Anglo-American Chris- tian cannot but be perplexed upon being told at church that sacrifice is pivotal in the drama of the God-world relationship, when the very term "sacrifice" is associated only with the slaughter of animals to placate gods by people-presumably less intelligent ones-from other places and times. To such perplexity deconstruction sheds light, by speaking of sacri- fice in new ways that make sense to the postmodern mind, while also offer- ing it a way beyond the prudishness of modernity that is now recognized as repressive. The vital themes of kenosis and sacrifice, however, must be handled with kid gloves. Perhaps in losing ourselves we shall indeed find ourselves, but in calling attention to this central Christian insight one opens a Pan- dora's box. Apocalypticism is often the rationale for genocide, validating destruction of the "other" that Taylor intends to protect. Indeed, "sacri- fice" is construed in many deconstructionist texts as an erotic fondness for laceration, a Gestalt that has been exposed as a central and not purely coincidental feature of the Berlin that gave rise to Hitler and his inner circles (Tatar). In Christianity the criterion of agape protects the theme of sacrifice from assuming this interpretation. To believe that Taylor's a/theology will preclude a murderous interpretation of sacrifice, one must trust his claim that acceptance of one's own multiplicity and mortality will result in the cessation of the desire to eradicate the other as embodiment of intoler- able predicates. In this claim Taylor is surprisingly conservative; links between self-acceptance and lovingkindness are integral to the Christian tradition that he would dismantle. Bataille and Taylor can teach us that squandering feels better than accumulating. The sacrifice of the Christ, however, was not chosen by Jesus as an instrument of self-satisfaction that</page><page sequence="13">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 583 was preferable to simple survival. The central Christian sacrifice is more credibly interpreted as a giving born of love so great that it did not count the cost. Taylor is indicted, but Christian theology is not, by Stephen Webb's astute observation that " [i]f the generous act is reckless for the sake of irrationality rather than otherness, then it becomes gratuitous in a pe- jorative sense, and such private profligacy can hardly be considered gen- erous" (29). Following Anders Nygren's distinction, Christian sacrifice is made in the service of agape, and the same agape imposes a limiting condition on surrender that respects the erotic commingling of pleasure and pain. That condition is that love for self and other not be violated-as it might be when eroticism leads to murder or other involuntary "sacrifice" of one for the pleasure of another with greater physical or political power. The rela- tion of the deconstructive interpretation of sacrifice to the more moralis- tic interpretation found in Anselmian orthodoxy (the traditional doctrine of atonement) remains an important matter for further research. Considering the possibility that the alliance with Hellenistic thought obscured the Christian message clears the air to revisit basic questions. With compelling reasons Anabaptists have long deemed the alliance with Roman power the distorting moment in Christian morality, seeking Jesus' ethical teachings from the model of pre-Constantinian Christians. If we grant the historiography of Anabaptism, and if we then consider that the apologetic movement may have corrupted Christian thought as much as the alliance with Rome compromised Christian conduct, we are tasked to examine the beliefs of the Christians before the second cen- tury B.C.E. If Paul be the first Hellenizer, it may be necessary to follow Anabaptist exegetes one step further in privileging the synoptic gospels to the Pauline epistles as the "canon within the canon." To ask deconstruc- tion to consider the claims of scriptural texts may not be as revolutionary as it sounds. Hart has pointed out that interpreters have ignored Derrida's most glaring play on words: that &amp;criture translates not only as "writing," but also as "scripture" (50). Of course, it is already known that a plurality of texts and interpretive communities satisfy the criterion of primitivity and that the historical Jesus movement will never yield to unequivocality. Nevertheless, the theo- logical conversation is at least narrowed down to a limited spatiotemporal framework. Taylor reminds us that Athens may have little to do with Jerusalem. I have raised the further question of what Paris has to do with Jerusalem. To answer either question, we must delimit a range of plausible meanings associated with "Jerusalem." Revisiting these ancient issues, fresh and compelling questions arise: Did Jesus' teaching include what we now term "metaphysics," the quest for some Being in which beings have their source? Kevin Hart contends</page><page sequence="14">584 Journal of the American Academy of Religion that a postmodern theology must eschew metaphysics (x). Such a non- metaphysical theology certainly does justice to postmodern sentiments, but does it do justice to the claims of Christian theology? The analysis remains to be done to support the claim that Jesus' Judaism had no meta- physical framework, be it one compatible with Plato's or otherwise. An- other question arises: Do we discern in Jesus' teaching an inadvertent respect for the law of non-contradiction, or do his quixotic parables form the basis for a Christian theology that rejects binary logic? Theologians, in this prescription, might turn their attention most fruitfully to the re- search in Christian scripture and history before engaging the legacy of philosophical theology. If the goal of hermeneutics be Gadamer's "fusion of horizons," hermeneutical method must minimally include the search for authors' intentions and the contemporary reception of a text. Other- wise, we know only the horizon of our own time but not that of the author's world. This recommendation that Christian theology be accountable to research on the ancient world deviates from most other Christian ap- propriations of deconstruction, which would champion a modern or medieval theologian by casting him as an unwitting proto-deconstruc- tionist. Peter Hodgson, for instance, has highlighted a side of Hegel that is arguably less metaphysical than the rest as the basis for a postmodern trinitarianism. Graham Ward has argued that Barth's analogia fidei is an inadvertent prototoype of Derrida's diffirance. Kevin Hart suggests cau- tiously what John Crossan defends explicitly: that mystics and negative theologians will be the sole bearers of the tradition that satisfy postmod- ern palates (66). Finally, John Caputo has dressed up Aquinas as a mystic who "deconstructs" his own metaphysical claims (247). Whereas Taylor begins with an enthusiastic appropriation of Derrida and then suggests that Golgotha and other Christian motifs illustrate the deconstructionist spirit, I am recommending that any postmodern the- ology be defended explicitly as a plausible interpreter of the Christ-event. Otherwise-if postmodernism can be said to represent our "culture" while the tradition of contending theologies represents "Christianity"- our theology of culture will have failed by the standard of dialogue 4 Borrowing from his teacher Martin Kahler, Tillich was the first to formalize the standard of dia- logue, terming it the method of correlation (Pauck in Adams, Pauck, and Shinn: 33). Tillich construed religion as "the substance of culture" and culture as "the form of religion," rendering the two inti- mately related (42). Tillich has been charged, however, with limiting culture to the role of questioner in this dialogue, especially in Systematic Theology. David Tracy has suggested that mediating theology follow a "revised method of correlation," in which both questions and answers can come from either</page><page sequence="15">Wennemyr: Dancing in the Dark 585 between theology and Christianity4; "culture" will have been granted the upper hand in the conversation between theology and culture, a meth- odological crime no less spurious than the fundamentalist demand that culture yield altogether to alleged values of Christian theology. Insofar as the themes of kenosis and sacrifice have been selected as deconstructive motifs that can elucidate the Christian tradition, the present recommen- dation is in line with that of other theologians who are developing these themes. Two stand out as especially compatible: Jean-Luc Marion, who construes God as that which gives while having no internal affiliation with Being; and Stephen Webb, who interprets the dynamics of giving in a trinitarian God as the basis for a community of faith. CONCLUSION The importation of deconstruction into theology, then, is an enter- prise to be undertaken cautiously, though not for the reasons traditionally cited. Taylor's deconstructive a/theology is not necessarily irrelevant to our own ethical praxis if it succeeds in realizing its goal of preserving oth- erness through an acceptance of the otherness that is always inevitably within (Edmundson: 622; Hodgson 1986:285). Nor can deconstruction be faulted for "leaving us with nothing;' for its purpose is precisely to bring us face-to-face with the nothingness we purportedly dread. Indeed, de- construction brings to Christian theology newfound appreciation for the processes of kenosis and sacrifice that are otherwise inaccessible to the Anglo-American world in the wake of modernity. It also questions the marriage of Christian theology with both Platonic metaphysics and Aris- totlean logic, raising anew crucial questions about what sort of logic and metaphysics are implicit in the source texts of the tradition. To follow deconstruction further, as Taylor has done, however, theo- logians must do something many of us already do very well: take leaps of faith, affirming with Taylor that fear of death exclusively fuels the mecha- nism of projection, deducing the death of God from the impossibility of a transcendental signified, tolerating the rendering of negation as the only absolute, and privileging atomism over the semblance of solidity in defi- ance of the relativistic epistemology that is elsewhere endorsed. Look before you leap. the culture or the tradition. "[I]f the 'situation' is to be taken with full seriousness," Tracy argues, "then its answers to its own questions must also be investigated critically" (17).</page><page sequence="16">586 Journal of the American Academy of Religion REFERENCES Adams, James Luther, The Thought of Paul Tillich.
