In addition, what I have to say builds strongly on the work of David Clarke, whose powerful influence was exerted on me principally via Andrew. The title reference is to the Middle Upper Palaeolithic mammoth ivory marionette of a male human figure from Brno, Czech Republic, which serves as a pivot for my argument (although the paper does not pretend to present a detailed and fully contextualised account). By building on observations and contentions concerning the unique life-world of humans, it is possible to argue that a recognizably modern form of human intelligence appeared (and perhaps could only have appeared) as a product of some essentially accidental, initially perhaps epiphenomenal, interactions between minds and material artefacts. I want to show that the familiar idea of a genetically-driven reorganisation of cognition, moving from mind to culture, in our genus, can be challenged by a reverse proposition, using a materiality perspective to work from culture to mind.

Although I was then focused on the Iron Age, he made it clear that prehistory was not a place for artificially-drawn temporal boundaries, and that long-term processes could easily be overlooked if all studies were strictly and tightly typological. He took the same approach to place and the impor- tance of inter-regional and cross-cultural (i.e. cross archaeological-cultural) assessments of phenomena. I can see more clearly now that a principal aim of his was to keep the candle of diffusionism alive as an available and plausible explanation of phenomena occurring across what is, after all, a quite geographically restricted and porous continental peninsula. Thus, in tandem with Thracian and Scythian studies, I began to research aspects of the Bronze Age (Sherratt and Taylor 1989, 1997 with revised illustrations). It was Andrew's grasp of wide scales and his mistrust of the then dominant autoch- thonous styles of explanation that drove him to arrange for Chernykh's magisterial Ancient Metallurgy in the USSR (1992) to appear in English; its translation in our house by Sarah Wright, my wife by then, and currently this journal's Managing Editor, meant that any hopes I might once have had of avoiding the big picture through faint-hearted speciali- sation were definitively dashed. Beyond such discrete challenges, the overall example of Andrew and Sue as a scholarly and parental team, inspired us and encouraged the con- catenation of circumstances that eventually led to the joint project of this journal. Its scope, as defined by Angela Close, was one Andrew thought archaeology pre-eminently needed - global, concerned with deep time and long sequences, and comparative. But Andrew's view of what comparison entailed was never simple. I learned from him also the meaning of the term Verfremdungseffekt (inelegantly translatable as Estrangement effect') and its significance. Andrew thought that much that was odd about the past was hidden from us because we framed it analogically and familiarly. Often an unusual angle was required to render familiar material unfamiliar again, and so amenable to reinterpretation. Through this we might move towards classifications that were more congruent with the values that things originally embodied, and better comprehend their valencies. His instinct in chal- lenging us to overcome the various, often daunting, bureaucratic, linguistic and logistical hurdles was - I think - rooted in a simple, powerful conviction that, while there was a very clearly emergent world prehistory, there was also a coherent and special prehistory of Europe. It may have been first glimpsed by Montelius and Kossinna, but it was the unfolding of an intellectual success story that could trace a genealogy back to Johann Gottfriejd von Herder. intellectual success story' was Andrew's oft-deployed, thrillingly upbeat assessment of archaeology as a discipline, and the concept of the European intellectual was dear to his heart. He was disheartened, I think, that only rarely since Coleridge's time had Englishmen or women aspired to such an epithet, and (arguably of course) among Anglophone archaeologists most prominently an Australian (Childe). The politics of the post-war period in Europe threatened to fragment earlier and more integrative understandings, and Andrew's instinct was to pull them back together again. That did not mean ignoring the problems in what had gone before. Rather it meant understanding and confronting archaeology's dirty history under nationalism, and the way issues of race and culture had not so much disappeared as been conveniently occluded by studies of artefact typology (in the west) and social typology (in the east). Like the great Romantic poet, Andrew was keen to deepen his engagement with fellow European scholars. That should ideally be in their own language, not as a courtesy but because he knew that Verfremdungseffekt was not the only word-concept that could not be unreflectively translated for passive users: learning other European languages meant that one would be exposed to a process of Verfremdung , Springer</page><page sequence="3">J World Prehist (20 1 1 ) 24:2 1 3-225 2 1 5 in which alien concepts would be absorbed. Such ethno-decentring brought one closer to unfamiliar truths and other lives. The point of distancing the familiar was, ultimately, to bring it close, and render it numinously mundane. The practice of travel through other, contemporary, worlds of European thought was to be encouraged in anyone who was contemplating the yet more culturally decentring trip into prehistory (and it was an endless regret to him that relatively few English-speaking archaeologists saw it that way). It would perhaps be true to say that in matters of history, philosophy and aesthetics, if not especially in typological archaeology, Andrew Sherratt was a Germanophile. Partic- ularly, though, he was an enthusiast for the later eighteenth century, when the philosopher and poet Johann Gottfried von Herder, the founder of modern linguistics Wilhelm von Humboldt, his younger brother, the explorer and pioneering ecologist Alexander von Humboldt, and the writer and cultural critic Heinrich von Kleist were all in their heyday. My argument here will take as its starting point a claim made about the nature of our species by Herder, to whose name and thinking style I was introduced via one of Andrew's withering and astounded 'you-don't-know-who-x-is?!' remarks (which, despite the regular inadequacy - if not actual shame - I felt, I learned to appreciate as the lot of a less-than- fully cultured research student in his presence). The first fruits of the thinking in this particular paper had already been shared with Andrew before his untimely death. In a research seminar given in Oxford in 2003, before his final institutional move to Sheffield, I presented ideas from the Palaeolithic chapters of The Buried Soul (Taylor 2002), and Andrew's positive reaction to what I had begun to argue gives me grounds for believing that he would have found some value in what follows. The following section (The challenge of Herder) describes how a particular model of culture, first formulated by Herder and developed in a post-Darwinian context by Gellner, is still salient. I want to show how this model aids an understanding of the processes - and an assessment of the significance - of enculturation in Ice Age human communities. The idea is to steer between the Scylla of evolutionary psychology and niche adaptation and the Charybdis of the Standard Social Science Model, with its stress on a rewritable 'blank slate' substrate for culture. This raises the question of whether there are sensible units of culture - discrete and 'heritable' traits (or gene-like 'memes') - that would allow a bio- logically reductivist account of our species to be sustained. My answer, firmly in the negative, leads to the suggestion in the following section (From Kleist to the Pavlovian) that it is helpful to attend to the insights of Vygotsky and more recent theories of social practice to grasp the significance of the emerging projective subsystem in Ice Age material culture; in addition, a second term from German art his- tory - Denkraumverlust - is introduced into the analysis. The conclusion references the 'sapient paradox', Renfrew's (2008) suggestive term for an apparent mismatch in the timing of the evolutionary emergence of modern human anatomy and cultural/cognitive development in humans (over 50,000 years later), and tries to dissolve it by reference to Vygotsky's (1978 [1931]) ideas of operative development, and more recent materiality theory (Taylor 2008b). The Challenge of Herder The subtitle of this paper as it was given, 'materiality and operative development', stressed the links between materiality theory and Herder. Herder was responsible for renewing the Herodotean concept of ethnic specificity, and he gave archaeologists and other scholars the Springer</page><page sequence="4">216 J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 concept of cultures , plural, as an alternative to the unitary Enlightenment concept of culture (singular). In the unitary conception, culture was an available means of betterment, operating in essentially monolinear style. The differences between human groups were perceived as surficial, 'skin deep', and connected to differences in technological level that could be bridged as easily as appeared to be the case for language barriers. In the plural conception, humans were seen as forming a series of equivalents to different animal species. Herder, in a powerful act of imagination, considered that while we may perceive different animals inhabiting the same environment, for each species the environment was its own, mapped out internally and reflexively in tandem with its own specific sensory abilities, its inherited instincts, its habituations. Each type had its own ungraspable Umwelt : for one, salt water was heaven and an airy ledge hell; the reverse for another. Herder extended this concept of Umwelten to humans. But where each animal type was born with its sensorium more or less complete, grounded in instinctive perception and behaviour in relation to species-potent stimuli, humans were born radically incomplete, and 'world open', lacking sufficient instinct to simply behave. Only through the complex and long process of enculturation would one type of human come to know and love traversing a sandy desert in a camel caravan and another feel most at home in a kayak. But for Herder, the outcome of these learned routines and absorbed values was pretty much as fixed as instinct by the time a human member of a culture had reached maturity. Each culture brought its own cultural Umwelt into being, and acted in relation to the incom- mensurable, and often contradictory, values of each. The ideas that Herder began to systematise were developed subsequently in a number of ways, and misunderstood and perverted in some later nineteenth and earlier twentieth century anthropology. Ironically, after Darwin, the way became clear for arguments to be made about the potential innate, instinctual, biological bases of the features that Herder attributed very largely to culture alone. The rise of this race-based science, although its spirit and logic ran contrary to Herder's conception, produced a reaction that was equally hostile to appreciating his analysis. In short, the 'blank slate' conception of the Standard Social Science Model returned us to an Enlightenment idea of cultural differences as rather fluid and mutable; perhaps they were valorised in a different way, no longer seen as a substrate for progressive and universal 'perfectibility'. But the extension of Herder's thinking that characterised the social anthropology of Ernest Gellner, and which concep- tualised cultures as near fascistic Umwelt-ge nerating machines, was not seen to be as significant as I believe it was. Simply put, its claims and insights did not fit what had become, and to an extent still is, a polarised, intellectually reduced, debate. A diagnostic sign of this was that Steven Pinker, in his The Blank Slate: the modern denial of human nature (2002), finds no space (in over 500 pages) for either of these thinkers (or Vygotsky). In his key 1989 paper 'Culture, constraint and community', Gellner argued along classic Herderian lines: while humans were the most behaviourally labile of any animal species on the planet when viewed inter-culturally, tora-culturally they typically - even univer- sally - displayed a penchant for using lethal sanction to enforce norms, emphatically proscribing forms of behaviour that an adjacent cultural community as emphatically pre- scribed. Gellner' s insight seems perhaps more plausible in the years since his death, with the emergence of ever clearer metaphysical fault lines, such as those apparent between religious fundamentalism and scientific secularism. Andrew Sherratt felt strongly that a central duty of the intellectual was to remain 'world open' in Herder's terms; from this conviction, he resisted the increasingly strident calls from some in the academy to hitch atheism and scientific inquiry together as if by some ^ Springer</page><page sequence="5">J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 217 underlying logic. Atheism clearly falls under the remit of faith and attracts conviction and converts (see McGrath 2007), while to cultivate a genuinely scientific culture, sensu lato , as Andrew understood it, involves continually entertaining attractive suppositions and welcoming challenges to yesterday's convictions. But a less optimistic reflection is that part of the logic of Herder's position, as adumbrated and developed by Gellner, is that some ongoing cultural communities become so antipathetical to perceiving any values but their own that even science, with its apparently objective testability and provable empirical outcomes, cannot operate effectively within them. Living with the translation of Chernykh, I became more sharply aware of the potentially political and reflexive character of some kinds of archaeological inference. Chernykh, like Childe before him, sought to explain the innovative style of the Later Bronze Age in Eurasia, the period of tin bronze, by reference not to race or ethnicity, but to what Marx termed the relations of production. His conclusion was remarkably similar, but drawn in more personal terms, seeing the marvellous floruit of bronze metallurgy as due to the scientific and artistic freedom won by, or given to, emigre metalworkers who had escaped the shadow of the ziggurats. Welcomed by the northern tribes as workers in a key tech- nology, they regained the world-openness that scientific progress requires and that the dead hand of theocracy denies. Latent in Herder's concept was an idea of the autonomy of culture, cognate with Kant's idea of the autonomy of the aesthetic. It is important to recognise this, because, post Darwin, explanations of differences in human lifeways became increasingly biologically rooted. The idea that evolution had produced a series of iterations between apes and humans opened up the possibility of evolutionary gradations extant in the present; this was something Darwin himself believed. Once the idea that large-scale, continent-wide forms of human existence were not so much historically emergent traditions as the outcome of innate predispositions came into fashion, it became possible to explain more minor physical and cultural differences in a similar way. Thus Hans Gunther, in The Racial Elements of European History (1927), parcelled out specific cultural achievements among types of ideal communities, conceptualised as sub-races and given labels such as Dinaric, Mediterranean, Alpine, Nordic, Baltic, Semitic, Negroid, and so on, with their various potential admixtures and 'strains'. These groups were considered the natural 'bearers' of diagnostic cultural 'traits'. Infamous among these was the swastika, whose appearance on ancient Greek geometric period pottery was seen as the fingerprint of the Indo-European, Germanic, Aryan people. Such symbols, according to Carl Jung, subsisted as archetypes in the collective unconscious of specific peoples, who could be galvanised into recognising their destiny by the appearance of a concrete physical manifestation. This, for the Nazis, was the theory underlying the importance accorded to the parade of emblemata. The tragic history that unfolded left biological explanation needing to find a new kind of cultural foothold. It was one shorn, mostly, of the more gratuitously racist inferences (but see the continuing controversy surrounding Herrnstein and Murray 1994). The territory shifted to the apparently safer ground of sexual politics, with sociobiologists and evolu- tionary psychologists attempting to provide entirely innatist explanations of gender dif- ferences. Nevertheless, the concept of discrete and heritable units of culture soon returned, initially in the culture-evolutionary concept of 'cultigens' (White 1959), and subsequently in the guise of the 'meme' (Dawkins 1979). Despite the boldness of the meme formulation (and its catchy name), the influential analysis of David Clarke had by then convinced most archaeologists that the old trait concept could not hold up. Childe had displayed ever greater doubt about the logic of drawing sharp lines around cultural communities; now Clarke moved towards a new form &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="6">218 J World Prehist (20 1 1 ) 24:2 1 3-225 of certainty: artefacts, long typologised as if they were biological entities, and put into monothetic groupings with clearly identifiable sufficient and necessary attributes for group membership, in reality had to be dealt with in another way (Clarke 1968). Clarke's lasting contribution was to reveal the polythetic (fuzzy-edged) nature of artefact categories, and to recognise that this decisively precluded their entitation using some version of biological taxonomy. The significance of the concept of polythetic categories is not just that it shows how nested taxa of archaeological entities - from artefacts via cultures to techno-complexes - are constituted through comparison of attribute similarity and difference (in classes in which no formal attribute is at once both sufficient and necessary for group membership), but, more profoundly, that it helps us uncover the reasons for the more complex patterning. This is not the place to examine the generative processes which bring artefacts into being, but suffice it to say that they represent a different level and scale of process to Darwinian descent with modification, and the subsequent selection in terms of fitness. To mention just one critical difference, many forms of variance in artefact form are designed, planned, intentional, goal-directed . . . that is - in the most fundamental contrast to Darwinian pro- cess that we can conceive - teleological. Dawkins, in describing the images of US presi- dents at Mount Rushmore, clearly accepts this (1996, p. 4) as a case where 'the distinction between accident and design is clear'. From Kleist to the Pavlovian My understanding of the complex nature and significance of the interrelationship between 'thingness' and 'humanness', partially symmetric but remaining unsatisfactory in its the- orisation, is the subject of both a technical review of materiality theory (Taylor 2008b) and a monograph, The Artificial Ape (Taylor 2010). My approach and concerns here run parallel to, but often differ in detail from, recent approaches of Shanks (2007), Webmoor and Witmore (2008), and Olsen (2010). Here I want to expand on a particular element of the argument, focussing on a particular artefact. The sight of the remains of a Middle Upper Palaeolithic marionette from the Pavlovian culture context known as the Brno II burial is enough to give any prehistorian pause for thought (Fig. 1). The elements that make up the now incomplete artefact are unambiguous, and the proximity to Prague, with its world famous puppet theatre, is so uncanny that it forces an immediate Verfremdungseffekt. The surviving elements of the marionette come from a Pavlovian culture context, Brno Francouzska Street, brought to light during the digging of a canal in 1880. Setting the circumstances of recovery to one side for the moment, we can say that the Brno II assemblage consists of a red-ochre stained set of adult male bones, which have yielded a high precision date of c. 23,680 ± cal BP (Pettitt and Trinkaus 2000). As Martin Oliva has argued, the assemblage may not be a formal burial qua funerary rite, so much as a cache of ritual materials, including the pieces of human skeleton (Oliva 2000). Found along with the human remains were an elaborate shell-jewellery headdress, ochre-stained mammoth bones, shells, and many worked bone, antler and ivory objects of symbolic aspect, made from a range of animals including rhinoceros, reindeer and mammoth. A reindeer antler rod and the mammoth-ivory marionette have suggested an interpretation involving sha- manism (Oliva 1996, 2000, 2005). Shamanism has been invoked more generally to con- textualise Palaeolithic art as a whole (Lewis-Williams 2002). Whilst that is certainly consonant with what I propose below, my aim is not to judge the plausibility or Springer</page><page sequence="7">J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 219 Fig. 1 The marionette elements from Brno II. Photo T. Jursa, Moravian Museum, Anthropos Institute meaningfulness of such an interpretation. Rather, I want to take a step back to focus on the dimension of materiality: the affordances of the artefact (pace Gibson 1979), both in an inferred complete and articulated form, and as incomplete and disarticulated. The marionette was clearly originally designed for articulation and had been articulated: a rod connected the head to the torso, and it is plausibly inferred that the arms and legs were attached with sinew or twine, and movable (Oliva 2000; Valoch 2009). It should be added here that the use of a term like 'marionette' (or a 'puppet ... jointed like a doll': Valoch 2009, pp. 180-183 and figure caption) leads us immediately into a dilemma in which potentially highly fruitful interpretive avenues are in danger of being closed off at the outset simply because of the decision to include the artefactual remains within the category (pace Wylie 1989). This label is a practical convenience or necessary evil; it should not occlude appreciation of the ontological uniqueness of the historical circum- stances that led to the production of the earliest object so far recognised as coherently Springer</page><page sequence="8">220 J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 ascribable to this class; and we should remain aware that the label could prejudice a more specific and contextualised description. Although we never spoke about it, it is likely that Andrew would immediately have had something to say about possible Ver- fremdungsejfekten operating between this little Gravettian marionette from Brno and Heinrich von Kleist's Uber das Marionettentheater ('On the Marionette Theatre'), an anecdote published in 1810 in the Berliner Abendbldtter, that centres on an unusual debate. It is worth giving a version of von Kleist in extenso here, to establish its tone: When spending the winter of 1801 in M...t I personally met , one evening in a public park} Mr C., who had recently been installed as principal dancer at the Opera, to the great approbation of the public. I said to him that I had found myself astonished to hear that he had undoubtedly been observed, more than once, at the Marionette Theatre down at the market, a place which pandered to the rabble with music hall numbers and burlesque dramas. He assured me that the pantomime exploits of the puppets gave him considerable pleasure, and that one should not overlook that fact that a dancer who sought improvement, might well learn something from them, (von Kleist 2007 [1810], p. 2 [my translation]) Having set the scene, Kleist draws us into the initially curious personal philosophy of the principal dancer. The principal starts by asserting his opinion that the limbs of the marionettes, not needing to carry any weight, were more able to describe ideal movements. Further, he suggests that the marionettes' movements embody a kind of mystic grace, transforming the actions of the puppeteers. Their impulses were constricted yet also extended through mechanism, conferring the advantage of weightlessness ('den Vorteil, daB sie antigrav sind'). Summing up, von Kleist's character rejects his interlocutor's belief that his interest is trivial by asserting: ... it was, unfortunately, impossible for human beings to reach the level of compe- tence of a marionette. Only a deity could stand comparison in such company; indeed, here we reach the critical juncture, the place where the two ends of the looped spectrum of worldly existence meet, (von Kleist 2007 [1810], p. 6 [my translation]) Juxtaposing the von Kleist story with the Brno marionette encourages us to confront the possibility that the Pavlovian figure was not made as a roughly working miniature of a living human, but was an exemplar for movement, an object encapsulating its ideal. A German aesthetic term to put beside Andrew's beloved Verfremdungsejfekt is Abi Warburg's Denkraumverlust: the 'loss of thinking room' that descends in the presence of particularly viscerally engaging art works. Warburg was interested in the point at which self-conscious, mediated, and rational aesthetic responses are overwhelmed by what an image or a sound immediately evokes. It partially explains the pattern, noted by Hans Belting, of oscillation between a passionate veneration of idols in Christian Europe and equally impassioned phases of iconoclasm (Belting 1994). The relevance to the Brno marionette becomes clear when we consider Ernst Gomb- rich's elucidation of Warburg's concept as a 'tendency of the human mind to confuse the sign with the thing signified, the name and its bearers, the literal and the metaphorical, the image and its prototype'. Gombrich added that 'We are all apt to "regress" at any moment to more primitive states and experience the fusion between the image and its model or the name and its bearer. Our language, in fact, favours this twilight region between the literal and the metaphorical' (Gombrich 1948). Denkraumverlust is a temporary inability to Springer</page><page sequence="9">J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 221 compare, a loss of the analogical perspective as signifier becomes signified. This will bring us shortly to the nub of the matter, and my characterization of a 'Brno Effect'. Accepting that our understanding of the symbolism of the Upper Palaeolithic is likely to be subject to continuing revision, of course, one last brief preliminary setting is required, summarizing in compact form some arguments I have advanced from a materiality per- spective on the so-called Venus figurines (Taylor 2006, 2008a) and the issue of putative formal burial in the Upper Palaeolithic (Taylor 2002, 2009; reaching conclusions conso- nant with more recent and more detailed syntheses: e.g. Pettitt 201 1). These things seem to me to be reflexive: the around 80 sets of buried human remains and probably over 100 members of the anthropomorphic or human figurine category show strong, and opposite, female-male sex/gender trends. Thus, while the clear majority (around 75%) of sexed human remains are male, the figurines are even more predominantly female if we read their biological notation correctly. The well-known exceptions include the haematite 'her- maphrodite' from Grimaldi, the equally ambiguous and fragmentary Grotte du Pape fig- urine, and the Hohlenstein-Stadel and Hohle Fels 'lion-men' carvings, none of them readable as standard depictions of men. Clearly, there was no taboo on the depiction of male genitals, as they are shown in cave art and in explicitly phallic objects. But simply put, the 'Venus' was the predominant form for human figurines, and there is a complete absence (in the discoveries made so far) of obviously equivalent male-coded counterparts. Given the sex imbalance in the skeletal population, and the supposition that funerary rites of some kind would have been enacted for nearly all members of a community, it becomes problematic to argue that the record actually reflects any normative rite of funerary inhumation. One possible symbolic logic is to understand what are presented as 'burials' as a kind of tableau, behind which some ritual killing or human sacrifice might have lain. Such tableaux could not merely have adumbrated certain emergent social norms but gave the emergent relational structures a memorable physical form. Andrew was immensely enthusiastic about my presentation of such 'burial' as - as he immediately labelled it - more coup de theatre than solemn deposition. Yet I cannot claim the idea: Oliva (1996) had previously made suggestions along these lines, and Pettitt (201 1) has now provided a broad synthesis of Middle Upper Palaeolithic humans remains which rejects any simplistic, overarching interpretation, including a primarily funerary one. But whatever the emic content of the behaviours, some of which have been preserved archaeologically, the production of posed skeletons in the ground is a form of static installation that, sooner or later, begs the question of where movement has gone. If the dead are lost to predators, or reabsorbed in acts of benevolent endo-cannibalism, the question of the onward movement of their vital force does not arise in quite the same way - personal vitality can be felt to be refreshed and redistributed. The fixed tableau of inhumation burial could have crystallised a hitherto more nebulous idea, of a distinct and separated soul increasingly identified as the missing element, detached by death from the distinct and separated body. It is possible that a complementary idea of fixity and separation was produced by the Venus figurines during what may have been their ritual deposition, but there is no space to pursue that argument properly here. What is clear is that the Brno marionette, found with human bones that also would no longer move, could have been far more mentally pro- vocative at the time of its deposition than we might imagine by default. Whether it could still have been operated is a moot point. What survives is incomplete, and it seems probable that it was interred like that, perhaps with its remaining articulations and control strings cut as well. How we judge this depends to an extent on the level of recovery during the original retrieval in 1880. Springer</page><page sequence="10">222 J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 The excavation of the remains in Francouzska Street was managed by Alexander Makowsky, an eminent botanist and geologist. He was a Darwin protagonist and a great friend of Gregor Mendel. There is no reason to believe that the work under Makowsky' s direction was not careful. Clearly, in fact, it was, as many tiny shell beads and fragmentary bone roundels were recovered from the primary locus, which would have required thor- ough sieving and a systematic approach to recovery. The investigation squares were extended outward on all sides until they could be logged as empty of finds; but after this exercise, not only the marionette but also the human skeleton remained incomplete (Oliva 2000; Oliva pers. comm.). Although it could still be argued that some material was nev- ertheless missed (Pettitt 2011, p. 193), this need not be a major interpretive spoiler. The key point for the argument here is that, at the time of deposition, whether that could be characterised better as a primary or a secondary context, the marionette was potentially retrievable and repairable. Unlike the disarticulated human bones, humans had the capacity to reanimate it. The marionette from Brno was, we might reasonably assume, not the only marionette ever made in the cultural context to which it belonged, even if it is (so far) the only specimen to have survived to be recognised and preserved through archaeology. Under- standing the potency of what Sartre (1976) called the reverberation of the 'practico-inert' in this case makes it tempting to label a general effect, which (as was already clear in my title) I propose to call the Brno Effect. I suggest that the Brno Effect represents a further development in the suite of con- ceptions about life, death and creative power that had begun to emerge, primarily through, and following from, material practice at this time. If the man whose skeletal remains accompanied it was the maker of the marionette, and the one who in life had animated it, Denkraumverlust could have (I would argue, must have) at some stage intervened when the final selection of items to be associated in the ground, the ochre-stained bones and the marionette elements, was made. With man and marionette equated, 'reanimation' of the latter became not just taboo but unthinkable; at least, reanimation by other mortals. At this point we might surmise that the concept of a higher 'maker' - one who had, by extension, initially made the 'model' for the man now lying dead and disarticulated - became imaginable. Here then, might be material grounds for an emergent belief in an anthropomorphic god. If the material and technological aspects of the articulated model human were pregnant with import for the future of science, then the implicit teleological dimension was equally freighted with significance for Creationism. Conclusion Towards the beginning of this paper, I suggested that there has been a tendency to privilege biology as the source of culture, which, in the broadest organic and operational terms, it must underpin. For the Upper Palaeolithic, this idea is familiar in relation to solutions to what Colin Renfrew has called 'the sapient paradox'. Broadly, this can be expressed as a timing issue, with anatomically modern humans, as determined from the fossil record, appearing by at least 160,000 BP (and maybe significantly earlier), while cognitively modern behaviour, as judged from archaeologically-surviving elements of symbolic cul- ture, does not seem to be systematically present until after around 40,000 years ago. One solution to that problem, promoted by Steven Mithen among others, has been to argue for 'modules' in the brain. Mithen' s 'Swiss Army knife' conception of the brain Springer</page><page sequence="11">J World Prehist (20 1 1 ) 24:2 1 3-225 223 (Mithen 1996), based on work in evolutionary psychology and cognitive science, envisages a Homo sapiens with neurological structures that were less interconnected at earlier stages. At a comparatively late stage these gelled to produce the integrated mental abilities inferred as required for the emergence of symbolic culture. Qua machine metaphor, the Swiss knife view of the human brain may involve a similar category error to the one made by Creationists when they argue that, biologically, we must have been designed. Certainly, an empirical problem with this mind-to-culture solution is that it does not connect to observable changes in anatomical structures that we can easily measure in the fossil data. It also rests quite substantially on the record for the Upper Palaeolithic in western Eurasia alone, which, as a regional record set against global pat- terns, may be said to be unusual. The inference of the alternative argument as it is presented in this paper is that culture is powerful enough to engender mind. This could be viewed as a species of 'blank slate' argument, but I think it is more grounded in the realities of biological development (especially the impressive early lability, in Gellner's terms, of the infant mind) than the versions familiar from the Standard Social Science model. Ontogenetically, human off- spring remain foetuses for around 2 years after birth, and they complete cellular brain growth, and thus the interconnection of neural pathways, under specific cultural conditions. This means that, while things that appear innate are in fact often routines that have been learned, once some early, critical point, has been passed, they cannot be unlearned (as the behaviourist B.F. Skinner, as well as Piaget, Vygotsky and Montessori, long ago appreci- ated). Looked at this way, the issues Herder, and later Gellner, raised in connection to the specificity and fixity of Umwelten for human cultural communities can be seen as consonant with their equally strong insistence on cultural autonomy, and the recognition that what is most critically innate, biologically speaking, is our 'culture-prone' incompleteness at birth. In this setting, the implications of what I have called the Brno Effect should be clear. But to briefly recapitulate: patterns of behaviour that may have emerged in quite unsys- tematic, contingent ways - such as the inhumation of some of the dead, or the productions of miniature simulacra of the human form in durable artistic media - while requiring the prior existence of certain physical and mental capacities, had the power to produce pro- found, unanticipated cognitive reverberations. For example, it is not trivial to consider that we cannot imagine a verbal metaphor of social control like 'to pull someone's strings' being possible before the appearance of objects such as the marionette from Brno. After such things became present in the material world, however, a whole new cognitive space came into existence, pregnant with opportunities for conceiving and discussing movement, volition, impulsion, convention, transgression, perfection, and so on. This cognitive space was not exactly symmetric with the realm of material production, but perhaps more like a new 'zone of proximal development' (to use Vygotsky' s term), enabled by the artefact world. Into this nexus, the new generation was born and developed, accepting, indeed physically and mentally in-building, its habitual affordances. Coda Andrew and I never discussed Solugub, but I can imagine that my epigram would have been more than usually provoking and led to a long conversation full of passionate assertion and colourfully articulated doubt. If Herder's hint about the incommensurability of cultures remains relevant, it must certainly condition our understanding of various languages (as Herder, long before Whorf, cogently argued), and the approximations of Springer</page><page sequence="12">224 J World Prehist (201 1) 24:213-225 translations. One meaning of sravnenie is 'simile' ; in English it could more closely equate to 'equate' (in order to judge) than to 'compare' (in the sense of to reveal dissimilarity); but then English may never quite have carried over the direct sense of the Latin from which 'compare' comes, favouring instead an older, rougher and more pagan, juxtaposition of potentially unequal choices. What should we take from the similarity we see between the Brno marionette and the much later animated figures of the Prague puppet theatre? It is possible that while social context and performative intention are very widely separated, some underlying affor- dances, to use a Gibsonian term, constrain things enough for parallels to be worthwhile. Having begun here with something Russian, and gone on to examine something Czech, I will end on a (suitably elegiac) German note: ...wenn mir zumut ist, zu warten vor der Puppenbuhne, nein, so vollig hinzuschaun, dafi, um mein Schauen am Ende aufzuwiegen, dort als Spieler ein Engel hinmufi, der die Balge hochreifit . Engel und Puppe: dann ist endlich Schauspiel. ...if I have the guts for it, to wait before the puppet stage, no, to become so drawn in that to break the trance an angel must turn actor, donning the beast costume. Angel and puppet: finally, then, it's theatre. Rainer Maria Rilke, Fourth Elegy , lines 52-7 Setting aside the probability that prehistorians should eschew poetic exegesis, it seems to me that Rilke both deepens the Kleistian image and drives at the conundrum of Cartesianism. Rilke aims to dissolve dualisms and even comparisons to suggest that the puppet theatre is a form of human life, a sublime engagement in which our physical impulses and imagination are equally extended through things - the fur pelts of wild animals and the turned wooden legs of dolls - revealing something essential about what we are: creators, endlessly creative. Acknowledgments Having signalled in some detail my debts to Andrew throughout this paper, I should also record the encouragement and influence of the late Ernest Gellner. Proximally, I wish to thank Martin Oliva and Gerhard Trnka; the referees for their helpful suggestions for improvement; and (of course) the Managing Editor. The inferences are my responsibility, as is the roughness of the translations from Kleist and Rilke (which if not simply inept, underscore the translational reality of the Whorf hypothesis, with its Herderian pedigree, lending little support to the Chomsky-Pinker idea of universal 'mentalese').
