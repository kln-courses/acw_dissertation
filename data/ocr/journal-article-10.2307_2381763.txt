Many people will have learned from Ray Monk's masterly biography how much ethics mattered to Ludwig Wittgenstein. Not only did the need to behave decently obsess him (as well it might have, given the distance between some of his behavior and that of the rest of us) but ethics is a focal point for the problem that dominates his later work, namely, that of finding a relationship between the world as humans find it and the world as science finds it. The contemporary scene suggests three interpretations, or three clusters of resem- bling interpretations, of his thinking on this subject, and Paul Johnston's book is an illustrative defense of one of them. The first cluster of interpretations makes him into a moral "realist" of a fairly specific kind. Of course, he has nothing in common with attempts to reduce or identify ethical properties with more naturalistic ones. His realism is more an affirmation that realistic thought and language is perfectly in place in ethics: we need not blush to talk about truth, facts, knowledge, certainty in this area any more than in any other. Why not? Because consideration of the nature of language, culminating in the 'rule-following considerations' shows us that not only our tendency to apply or withold ethical judgment, but all our classifications depend upon the human perspective we bring to the world. Given such a generalized anthropomorphism no special status needs to be found for ethics. It is merely an area where the trail of the human serpent is more than usually visible. We might react to this by supposing that instead of realism about ethics we have linguistic idealism about everything. But practitioners of this approach will retort that Wittgenstein has shown us how to dissolve these ancient oppositions. It does not matter if we do not have a term 'ism' to call the result: what matters is that truth, knowledge, and the rest are in place as firmly and in the same way as everywhere else. I discern John McDowell, and following him, Sabina Lovibond and Susan Hurley in this family. This interpretation would be nice if there were evidence for it. Unfortunately it flies in the face of innumerable texts, and indeed of the whole spirit of the later Wittgenstein. Far from finding a fundamental identity in our different assertoric activities, Wittgenstein wants to force the difference between different "language games" right down our throats. He is constantly suggesting that underneath a superficial similarity of linguistic form there is deep difference of function. There is no area he considered in the later work where this approach is not found. Philosophical statements are not what they appear; they are rules of grammar. Mathematical statements are often not what they</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 589 appear; they do not have the use of statements but of rules. Apparent self- descriptions are not what they appear; avowals are forms of self-expression, not self-description. Statements attributing consciousness to others, or describing acts as voluntary, have the use of expressions of attitude. Ethical and aesthetic and theological assertions are not what they appear; the form of life in which they are found is not that of describing how the world is but of reacting emotionally to it. Bully for Wittgenstein, say I. But now remember too that "philosophy leaves everything as it is." So can we continue to talk of truth, fact, knowledge, and the rest in these nondescriptive areas without blushing? It seems a good question, and I do not think Wittgenstein ever confronted it squarely. His answer is going to be that we can, but it is not at all plain how he gets to it, for the difference of activity he harps on is introduced precisely by contrast with describing and representing the way of the world, and those are the activities that most obviously must conform to norms of truth and fact. Witt- genstein seems to leave unfinished business, and the second interpretation is that indeed he does. He leaves the business taken up by the character I call the quasi realist, with whom he should therefore be allied. Note that he leaves unfinished business even if we remember his adoption of a "minimalist" or redundancy conception of truth. The business would be understanding how ejaculations, expressions of emotion, rules, and the rest can properly don the garb of assertions in the first place. The third cluster of interpretations wants elements from the second and from the first. It properly remembers Wittgenstein's love of motley. But it finds no unfinished business-after all, how can Wittgenstein, with his hostility to the idea that philosophy is trying to find explanations of anything, admit to a feature of our language games that needs philosophical explanation? The true Wittgensteinian reaction is just to find more motley. Talk of truth, knowledge, certainty is itself a patchwork. For these notions do not just arise in connection with descriptions and representations but with rules, ejaculations, and so on as well. Provided we have a correct "ubersicht" of what we are doing, nothing needs explanation, nothing is hidden. I discern Gordon Baker and Peter Hacker in this family, and Paul Johnston is a willing pupil. It is true to much in Wittgenstein, yet its problem is obvious: it denies Wittgenstein any words to say what he wanted about the differences that the position starts by celebrating. Maybe "description" and "representation" are a patchwork, or what we might call mottled themselves ("this is what we call describing the ethical facts"). Drunk on clusters, we evade the problems that torment the quasi realist by reaching once more for the mottle. Of course ethical (mathematical logical, philosophical, psychological) statements are true, describe the facts, can be known, say how it is. No contrasts there! But they do not do so in the way that empirical statements do. Don't they? Find an interesting way in which they allegedly contrast and watch me mottle it! "Objective"-this is what objectivity is in ethics; "knowable by observation"- this is what observation is in mathematics/psychology/ethics/philosophy. The motto is that where we can fly mottle, there is no fly bottle. Perhaps the differences the later Wittgenstein said he wanted to teach us are unsayable, thrown away after we have climbed the ladder. If this is the upshot, then the third position is really unstable. In spite of paying lip service</page><page sequence="3">590 Ethics April 1993 to the teaching of differences, it eventually sides with the first exegesis, finding that Wittgenstein teaches us the exact contrary, that truth, knowledge, and the rest sit as smoothly on every discourse and in the same way (for ways are mottled) as they do on any. I myself think that Wittgenstein did want to teach us differences, and that they can be told. Much of Johnston's book is valuable in reminding us just how seriously and centrally Wittgenstein was concerned with the difference between ethics (and aesthetics) and other disciplines. It isJohnston's dismissive attitude toward other philosophies, and particularly toward the enterprise of fitting the genuine differences that interested Wittgenstein into a wider na- turalistic picture of humanity and its activities that eventually saps enthusiasm for the approach. But I do not think we should blame Wittgenstein for that. SIMON BLACKBURN University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</page></plain_text>
