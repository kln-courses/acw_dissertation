<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphic Tendencies in Positivismi BY CHARLES HARTSHORNE _ 'HE theme of this paper is that positivism, whether old or new, is a version of the doctrine 3 of Protagoras, that man is the measure of / things. Certain limitations of the human mind are mistaken for characteristics of the universe. I am not primarily concerned with the particular views of actual positivists, but with a general alternative of thought. If no one is in all respects a positivist in the sense criticized in this article, it is certainly true that there are many who would not accept what I suggest is the only satisfactory alternative to positivism; so that existent positivisms will, if my reasoning is correct, consist in more or less arbitrary compromises between the unmitigated form, and the real over- coming, of that anthropomorphic narrowness which all positivism (and some forms of so-called realism and naturalism) involves. 1 Enlargement of a paper read to the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, December, 1937 (Princeton). I wish to emphasize the remark made in the text that this article is not an attempt to estimate the value of the work of Carnap, Reich- enbach, or any other individual, except so far as that work purports to establish the limits of human knowledge and to eliminate metaphysics. I wish only to show that the success of this attempted elimination has been exaggerated; that the attempt has indeed quite definitely failed. It does not follow that we owe nothing to those whomade it. An incisive failure may be more helpful, more cause for admiration and gratitude, than a vague or equivocal success. We cannot know adequately what metaphysics is until we know with the utmost clearness what it means to attempt to get along without it. Those neo- Humians who are known as "logical positivists" may in the end do more for the science of metaphysics than the neo-Hegelians or neo-Thomists. 184</page><page sequence="2">C. Hartshorne 185 This much must be granted to positivists, that what is in every sense unverifiable by experience is meaningless. The absolutely unknowable is nothing, or, if you prefer, it is in every sense unknown, and being in every sense unknown it is in every sense an illegitimate object of reference. Further, what is to have meaning for man (or for me or you) must be knowable by man (or by me or you), it must in some fashion be humanly knowable. Thus human knowledge is in some manner really the measure of things. And yet, if-as seems evident enough-man is a species and not the genus of possible knowing mind, then reality as man is able to know it can hardly be in every way identical with reality as knowable. Probably no positivist is much concerned to demonstrate the practicability of our seeing the other side of the moon in order to give meaning to the idea that this other side has color. For he is likely to be satisfied with pointing out that we know in principle what it is like for an object verifiably to have color on its various sides. But do positivists generalize, as it deserves to be generalized, this admission of knowledge on principle, where details are not accessible? There are many, or infinite, gradations between absolutely particular details (which escape science, as Aristotle long ago pointed out) and the most universal traits of existence. If instances are out of reach, yet meaningful, why not whole species? A blind man is ignorant, not of this or that color sensation, but of all color sensations. Yet it is noteworthy that he is not ignorant of sensation as such. This suggests a general principle: the particularity of the world is less accessible to the human mind or any other mind not omniscient (but able to use abstractions) than the general characters of things. To be sure, everyone admits that the law of gravity is better known than the detailed weights of objects throughout the universe. But against this one is apt to set the fact that special laws are sometimes known before the more general laws of which they are special cases. Yet this does not in- validate the principle spoken of. For (I) even the most general law of the scientific type would still be a special case of the logi- cally possible (other laws being conceivable) and the general</page><page sequence="3">i86 Tendencies in Positivism class of such possibilities would as such be knowable, at least in general outline, to anyone reflecting sufficiently; and (2) scientific generalization presupposes as known, not merely of possibility but of actuality, the general truth that nature or existence is not in every sense chaotic, this truth being no special case but the generic trait of existence as such; and finally (3) scientific laws, even themostgeneral, may have alternatives, and so be special cases, not merely with respect to logical possibilities, but with re- spect to actualities in the remote past, and real possibilities for the remote future-if there are reasons, as many thinkers believe there are, for supposing that nature has not forever, and will not forever, run "true to form" as this form is describable by laws which science can discover. The only form to which nature must forever run true would be that to which there is no possible alternative, for instance the form, spoken of above, of possessing always some sort and degree of order, the law that there shall be law, from which the validity of scientific induction as a principle can be deduced. This law concerning laws is metaphysical or generic, and can be known no matter how many or few specific laws are known, for it is essential to them not they to it. Positivism seeks to avoid this conclusion, or render it harmless, in two ways. (i) The law that there shall be law, the ground of induction, is treated as a mere "wager" (Reichenbach), something we have nothing to gain and everything to lose by doubting, but whose truth to existence cannot be known (if it can even be called true, rather than merely a necessary postu- late). (2) Other generic or metaphysical principles, so far as these are considered by positivists, are interpreted as logical or syntactical only. Thus what nature may do, the really possible, is held to be only what nature, as knowable by induction, in a general way does do; and beyond that we have, it is contended, only what language can consistently state. And things are consistently statable, not because nature, reflected in language, may or might sometime produce them (perhaps in violation of laws which science rightly ascribes to nature in her present stage), but just because-they are statable. Language, then, is held not to express a generality in nature going beyond her actual</page><page sequence="4">C. Hartshorne I87 behavior in the present cosmic epoch (in Whitehead's invaluable phrase). It is denied, at least implicitly, that there is an evolu- tion of quantitative laws, an evolution not subject to law of the same degree of quantitative definiteness; and it is denied that there is a real distinction in nature between doing and capacity to do, or at least it is denied that such capacity has an aspect of unlimited generality coextensive with the logically possible. The first supposition is a little surprising in view of the discovery in physics itself that particles must be described, not in terms of what they do do, but in terms of what, with varying degrees of probability, they may do. In any case, positivism is here taking sides-which it claims to avoid doing-upon a metaphysical question, either as to whether there is a real objective, non-formal, cosmic distinction between actuality and potentiality, or at least as to whether this distinction has the same scope as that between the actual and the logically conceivable. All this is only a way of saying that positivism takes sides upon the issue of nominalism and realism, in one of its more adequate formulations. For actuality is individual, and potentiality, or at least some of it, is general. Thus the question whether nature contains generals or not is on our hands. If real potentiality and generality be admitted, how does the positivist know that the most general real potentiality is not transcendent of the cosmos on its actual side during any period of time accessible to scientific inference? Such potentiality would be inaccessible altogether, and hence, it would seem, meaningless; or else the most general conceivable ideas are not merely syntactical but refer to nature, yet are known to us as the most general principles by the very fact that we can conceive them, and that we find them involved in all thought, including all thought which attempts to generalize beyond them. What I have just crudely described is metaphysics. To the scientist the claim that we can know the most general truths merely by thinking (we shall see later that this does not mean apart from all experience) seems suspicious, if not absurd. But he might note that it is only the most, the utterly, general truths that metaphysics (except when it runs amuck) claims to know in this way, and that the inaccessibility of special cases to</page><page sequence="5">i88 Tendencies in Positivism mere thought applies even to extremely general problems, if they are less than the most general. Quantitative accuracy is always a special case, and even infinitely special if the accuracy be sup- posed infinite. Also the scientist may, if astute, observe in himself the belief that thought and not detailed observation settles the final generalities, such as the generality that the future may be expected (with certain reservations) to resemble the past, indeed, that it will resemble the past, for no scientist goes around, and no man walking the street goes around, regarding this prop- osition as uncertain. Here is a generality lying behind observa- tion, giving it all the significance it can have, and this generality is certainly not merely a matter of language; and if it is known to have truth, then this knowledge must come in some sense just by taking thought. It makes no particular difference whether we say that we "know" such general principles, or merely admit that we "believe" them and obviously will continue to believe them. For metaphysics can about as well be described as the rational systematization of what we ultimately believe as of what we ultimately know, and the very significance of this distinction is relative to the idea of special cases where there is an alternative belief. (If what simply must be believed is, or may be, false, it can do us no good to know it!) Positivists have the tendency, either not to take the trouble even to list what we all do and will believe, not only in science but in life generally, or else not to try to unify ultimate beliefs as much as possible, and if feasible, to reduce them to aspects of one ultimate belief (such as belief in God). On the one hand, then, positivists-and many scientists, especially those who have severed connections with religion-tend to suppose that what is inaccessible to man by the method by which special cases have to be humanly reached is inaccessible altogether, and hence that the idea of it is meaningless. This is a subtle way of arguing from human to objective limitations. All clear-cut, distinct, obvious insights that we enjoy are of details, special cases. Ultimates are, indeed, inalienably there in our experience and thought, but in such a way that it is easy to imagine that one has got rid of them, or reduced them to their</page><page sequence="6">C. Hartshorne I89 purely linguistic aspect. The finitude of human knowledge is seen just in this, that either we are comprehensive but vague (or if definite, with the definiteness of a mere empty outline) or else clear and distinct but provincial, in our ideas. We can be vaguely omniscient (this omniscience being all that gives meaning to such terms as "universe", "God", "the past"-mean- ing the infinite, the whole past-etc.). We can be narrowly definite ("this table has four legs"). In between come the scien- tific generalities, which alone can be both fairly precise and of wide (though never absolute) generality. By this truly unique combination science presents to otherwise clever men the ap- pearance of constituting the whole of human knowledge, and the measure of existence. Yet when it is said that what cannot be verified (by man) is nothing, it is seldom if ever made clear how this differs from saying that there is no limit to the extent to which particulars conform to patterns connecting them at last with our distinct perceptions, from which they can, in principle, be in- ferred. (This is explained not to mean determinism, but it appears to mean that reality is no more and no less and no otherwise determinate than our potential knowledge.) There is a reason for stopping short of this extreme. It is the formal principle of the universal, as we have seen, that it does not imply the particulars that come under it. A generality which enabled one to pass without limitation from detail to detail, or even from species to species, in the world would be the "con- crete universal"-not an abstract concept at all, but an organic intuition. The world may be an organic unity (although, in spite of some idealists, the details of the future cannot be con- tained in advance), but discursive thought is in principle inadequate to delineate this unity. It may be objected that at least there can be indefinite advance toward the goal by dis- cursive thought, so that while all cannot be known, there is no one definite thing or aspect of things which never could be humanly known. But it has to be considered that there may, indeed almost obviously must, be a law of diminishing returns such that, in certain directions, further knowledge will be more and more difficult, and at best vaguer and vaguer as one advances,</page><page sequence="7">190 Tendencies in Positivism so that a point may be reached beyond which for practical purposes there is absolute inaccessibility (to man). And this diminution of our powers in certain directions need not be con- tinuous, but may be subject to a quantum principle, so that at a certain point further progress will be not a little, but incom- parably, more restricted and unlikely-as seems to be the case already in certain phases of physics, as I wish now to suggest. The mere physical pattern of things is sufficiently uniform and precise to enable us to infer approximately the details of physical arrangement beyond the given. But not without limitation. Physics does not quite reach the individual particles in their individual history, even as bare physical, that is, spatio-temporal, structures. We cannot follow the behavioristic eccentricities of single electrons, or-it is the same thing-they have no such eccentricities of sufficient magnitude to affect the patterns by which we infer them from perceptual data. Yet, as a brilliant mathe- matician has said, if anyone really believes in the absolute physical (spatio-temporal) sameness of electrons, he is credulous indeed. We can very well verify the general idea of physical eccentricity, and therefore we know in principle what we mean by electronic eccentricity. Will it be asserted that not only univer- sals, but all specifications and combinations of universals, must be capable of exemplification or confirmation in our experience in order to exist really? Inaccessible to man are not only the individual details of physical behavior, but, as already suggested, the remote reaches of past and future time. For all we know, the laws which de- scribe nature in this "cosmic epoch" have no relevance to sufficiently remote periods of time. We have no right to assume that any generalization not of a metaphysical order applies to all time. Does this mean that the notion that through all the past nature always had some more or less enduring regularities of behavior is meaningless? Do we not in principle know very well what is meant? An advantage of believing all natural uniformities to be tem- porary, that is, of generalizing the evolutionary principle to include all natural kinds whatever, is that it enables us to regard</page><page sequence="8">C. Hartshorne I9I possibility as objective. If, that is, we regard determinism as objectively false, and the laws of nature as only relatively en- during as well as allowing slight irregularities all the time (in both respects being like the habits of biological species), then possibility as wide as consistent speech, and the objective mean- ing of such speech, will lie in what nature may do, or may have done, in the present, past, or future, either (i) within or (2) around the edges, so to speak, of her not too "inviolable" laws, or (3) in remote times before or after the emergence of laws that conflict with the possibility. In other words, what is logically possible is, in terms of all time, naturally possible, and possibility is thus naturalized, instead of being made a supernatural mystery, or explained away altogether. And the reason the naturally possible is also logically possible is that meanings are reflections of nature, and whatever they tolerate, nature tolerates (as possible, though this proves nothing about what is actual-unless there be some one actuality involved in all that is actual as well as in all that is possible, some individual that is also universal in scope, such as God). There is an interesting question about the relation of this view of laws to the theory of probability. If we define probability in terms of the "infinite long run", then either it must be possible to conceive an infinite number of cases, in the sense required by the definition, even with respect to a finite stretch of time (by including possible as well as actual cases, or by supposing space infinite) or else, as seems more likely, the definition amounts to a piece of metaphysical dogmatism implying that real probability requires laws fixed for all time. Some positivists (more strength to them) have sought to escape the dogmatism by defining prob- ability in finite terms; but it is symptomatic that, although the evolutionary conception of law is half a century old, positivists discuss probability with little notion that they may be committing themselves on this question, or that the question exists. Un- fortunately, metaphysicians like Whitehead have not written very satisfactorily on this subject either. It is a task for the future. That physical structure can-subject to certain restrictions</page><page sequence="9">192 Tendencies in Positivism and difficulties--be inferred is due to its abstractness. The scientific universal is necessarily, as we have seen, abstract. Physical properties, as Parker has recently reminded us,2 are not capable of particularity. They always leave open alternatives, infinite in number, with respect to qualitative filling. "Phy- sicalism" thus amounts to the doctrine that there is only an emotional or pictorial significance to particularity. Particularity may not be useful in physics, but it is as objectively factual as more general aspects; it is the facts in their completeness. Physics is concerned with the manipulable aspects of fact; it is sublimated engineering. But the world is not definable as that which human beings may manage. In friendship we have another motive for knowledge, the motive of appropriating, sharing in, the states of another mind by imaginative duplication. This sharing is knowledge if by that we mean that it involves meanings which fit their objective referents, which correspond to their realities. We are not understanding ourselves but the friend, and either truly or falsely. But the difficulty with this kind of understanding is that it depends upon a fairly close resemblance in emotional and intellectual constitution between knower and known, or upon imaginative flexibility such as a novelist possesses, which is never anything remotely like absolute. Lacking such resemblance or flexibility we not only cannot verify, we cannot even clearly conceive, what the feelings and emotions and thoughts of others may be. Hence the advantage of the physical language lies not only in superior verifiability but also in our ability to conceive definitely the whole system of pos- sibilities, of what could be true. We need not wait to observe the shapes of molecules; for the mathematician can construct the chief possibilities. But how are we to construct sensory qualities we have never sensed? In vague general terms, in principle, we understand what is involved, but the kind of adequate crystal- clear symbolization furnished for geometrical ideas by symbolic 2 "Value and Existence," Int. F. of Ethics, Vol. XLVIII, pp. 475-86. See also D. H. Parker, Experience and Substance (The University of Michigan Press, I94I). Several of the topics discussed in this article are dealt with in brilliant fashion in this book, including the question of probability in the finite run.</page><page sequence="10">C. Hartshorne 193 sets, operations, and diagrams we cannot have for ideas of quality. Space is a relational pattern, such as can be accurately symbolized; sense qualities are perhaps related in such a pattern (as I have elsewhere tried to show they are)3 but they are not in themselves patterns, as shapes are. To know them specifically we must intuit them. But our capacity for sense intuition is surely any- thing but exhaustive. There must be classes of sensory quality in the experience of other animals than man which we not only cannot directly know but cannot definitely, specifically imagine or conceive. Positivism, of course, seeks to short-circuit the argu- ment here by insisting that the entire content, apart from pictorial or emotive meaning, of statements about feelings and volitions and thoughts is found in the physical descriptions of organisms and their environments. But suppose the question is, what are the pictorial and emotive meanings of other than human minds? How are they similar or dissimilar to mine? Positivism replies perhaps with physiological descriptions of human and animal sensations and emotions. Such descriptions, it says, are alone verifiable, and by the laws of psycho-physics are unambiguously correlated with, hence logically equivalent to, the introspective descriptions. There is no formal but only a material difference, a difference of imagery. First of all, if we know what we mean by similarity, it is hard to see how we could fail to mean something by similarity, or its contrary, between-not our behavior-but our feelings, as they are to us, and-not the behavior-but the feelings of others, as they are to them. We can compare remembered with present feelings; is it certain that the relation between one self and another is wholly different in principle from the relation between present self and past self? Positivists sometimes speak as if they had a private metaphysics, according to which to feel the feelings of others, and hence to be able to compare them to one's own feelings, is a contradiction in terms. I have not discovered how positivists know this. The nearest organisms to a man are not other human beings, whose feelings seem indeed beyond his vivid direct intui- 8 rhe Philosophy and Psychology of Sensation, Chicago, University of Chicago Press. 1934.</page><page sequence="11">I94 Tendencies in Positivism tions, but his own cells. Nothing shows that we do not, and much suggests that we do, feel the feelings of some of these cells, though not clearly enough to distinguish the individual cell-feelings from the mass. Many have believed and do believe that the whole universe is a living organism which feels distinctly the feelings of all its parts. It could therefore compare them. (The love of God means just that; it is not an emotive phrase, but a principle of knowing which alone could justify pure positivism: "the world is as it can be given to me." One iota's departure from perfect love and there must be bias and blindness rendering the state- ment false.) But apart from the direct comparison of feelings of more than one mind there is the possibility of indirect evidence. Carnap says that since one verifies of the feelings of another only the behavior which they involve, therefore one means by the feelings only the behavior. (This may not be his present position.) But if "verifies" means directly perceives, then by the same reasoning "Washington crossed the Delaware" means the now existing docu- ments which prove this event; or, more drastically, it means the state of the historian's organism when exposed to the light rays coming from the documents. If, on the other hand, as Carnap certainly holds, there is to be indirect verification, why not of the feelings of others, not as behavior but as feelings, verified indi- rectly through behavior? Perhaps the best discussion of this problem is by Reichenbach, in his new book, Experience and Prediction.4 Reichenbach con- siders, as a conceivable verification of the similarity of feelings in different minds the possible partial joining of the two nervous systems. Perhaps this would provide evidence. But isn't it almost obvious that all such human verifications are human efforts to get at relations which are real even though we do not get at them, and which could never be adequately stated in terms of human verification, however fantastically extended in imagina- tion? All verifications involve memory, and all human memory is imperfect; all intersubjective verification involves sympathy, putting oneself in place of another, and all human sympathy is 4 The University of Chicago Press, 1938.</page><page sequence="12">C. Hartshorne '95 indeed imperfect. After all, joining the two nervous systems would not prove two individuals were getting the same sensations, unless there were real sympathetic overlapping of two minds, and this overlapping could not be perfect. Of course we check one human memory or sympathetic understanding by another, but in this checking and comparing does not an ideal operate which is above all the relative terms compared? The very notion of the social situation, self here, other self there, implies a common measure of feeling and thought which is neither of the two selves compared, with their more or less incurable partialities, but an impartial experience of both, a transparent sympathy and a per- fect memory (without which the very meaning of "the past" cannot, I believe, be understood). Turning from this hasty inconclusive suggestion, we must con- sider the alleged "equivalence" of psychical and physical state- ments. This is not an analytic relation, not an "L-equivalence", since it assumes the logically contingent laws of psycho-physics, which are "lucky accidents" for positivism. This lack of analytic relation between physical and psychical properties is due to the already mentioned abstractness of physical concepts. But there is an analytic relation running in the reverse direction. Psychical concepts are concrete, and without the assumption of any laws imply physical pattern. No one could describe aesthetic experi- ence in abstraction from spatio-temporal structure, as physics describes structure in abstraction from qualities. Experience, aesthetically considered, is a unity of all the categories. Art is indeed subjective, selective, but only in respect to details, while science is selective in respect to utterly general features. The whole generic nature of reality is the subject of art, but not of physics. Science, as remarked, is accuracy. This is its only superiority. Philosophy founded chiefly on science is philosophy committed to the proposition'that what we cannot know accu- rately we cannot conceive; that because, to get detailed accuracy, we must abstract from much of reality, we cannot admit in prin- ciple, and without pretensions to precise specificity, the omitted aspects. The truth is that, as Leibniz, Peirce, and Whitehead have demonstrated, there is nothing in the physical picture of</page><page sequence="13">I96 Tendencies in Positivism the world but a relational pattern which can be fully included in the panpsychic picture of the world. The one is a skeleton, the other the only conceivable way to give the skeleton life; or to speak less poetically, to specify even in principle what provides the terms for this network of relations. Certainly the doctrine that such things as atoms do not involve anything psychic is as abso- lutely unverifiable, not only by us but by any conceivable mind, as anything that could be put into words. Just how would it be verified? We can verify easily enough that electrons do not feel in the complex way that we do. That is verifiable if anything is, for all the evidence, from structure or behavior, conflicts with such an assumption. And of course only unitary individuals feel, not heaps of sand, or a man's arm; and it has indeed been argued that electrons are not individuals but only phases of atoms, or of some more inclusive entity, say the whole of space- time reality. But this would only mean for panpsychism that the feeling which electrons must involve belonged not to them as subjects but to some entity of greater scope and complexity. To verify that the individual units of action in nature have no feelings of any kind, however remote from our own in specific quality, not only is this beyond our conceivable accomplishment, but no one has given us the glimmering of an idea as to how any mind whatever, even divine, could be aware of such a negative fact. If an object is red it is not, in the same area, green, for these exclude each other, but no positive qualities exclusive of feeling can be specified or conceived. One feeling excludes an- other, nothing excludes all feeling but non-existence (of the indi- vidual as such). The doctrine that mind explains the world is often accused of anthropomorphic narrowness, but in fact no doctrine other than a sufficiently generalized idealism makes so clear what a small part of reality man is, and how much of it escapes his grasp. For only mind very different from the human, only a variety of more or less drastically non-human, and to us only slightly conceivable, minds could constitute all aspects of the world known to us in some of its aspects. What is called the "thesis of positivism", that all things can be stated in terms of human sense perceptions,</page><page sequence="14">C. Hartshorne 197 is the real anthropomorphism. If a frog is formulated in terms of sensations which we-who cannot clearly imagine what it would be like to be a frog having frog-sensations-can enjoy, then it is something less than the frog that is being formulated. Nor can all that physiology adds to this account give us the objective frog, though it gives us, approximately accurately, a whole class of objective facts about the frog, all from the side that is humanly accessible, the side of spatio-temporal outline. The other side is inaccessible in detail, but not in principle. If a man can see how his emotional and sensory experiences differ among themselves, and if he can see that the ways in which his experiences differ admit of much greater, even perhaps infinitely greater, differences of the same kind than he can experience, then can he not form the idea of a vast system of possible sensations which never enter into the human positivistic language at all? The principles of this system are given to us; they can be stated in human terms. For instance dimensions of color sensations, such as intensity, clearness, saturation, are represented in our experience by finite segments of lines of variation not exhausted by these segments. After-images of red are said to be redder than any red we otherwise experience; maybe there is a being whose sensation of red is of a redder red than any we know. It must be granted to positivists that to say that humanly unknowable details and species exist requires that we have a veri- fiable meaning for "existence" other than the following: "for an individual of a certain character to exist is for an instance of that character to be verifiable by human beings." But the required other meaning is that the instance should be verifiable by minds of some type, whether human, sub-human, or super-human, the existence or real possibility of such minds itself being humanly verifiable. This definition of existence is metaphysical. There can be nothing which could be experienced by no mind whatever. But that everything must be such that man can have definite knowledge of it is a proposition without foundation, a piece of false metaphysics. It may, however, be asked what use there can be in ideas which cannot lead to human knowledge of their object. First of all,</page><page sequence="15">I98 Tendencies in Positivism knowledge of our necessary ignorance is after all knowledge about ourselves. Second, it is knowledge about the world. To see the outlines of the world we must have some conception of the range of species, including those we cannot, except vaguely, get at. (Of course, we can never be certain just how inaccessible a thing is; I am only objecting to the position that the concept of the humanly inaccessible is meaningless.) As we have seen, humanly unverifiable ideas are all specific. The uttermost generalities must be verifiable. Metaphysics is thus not at all the unverifiable, but that which, itself verifiable, gives meaning to all other ideas, verifiable or not. True, the metaphysical verification is not the verification achieved in natural science. It would be absurd if knowledge of the abso- lutely non-specific were to be obtained by the same method of examining relatively specific facts as such, which is the method of induction. Non-specific knowledge must, of course, be ob- tained by examining experiences, but not as specific, rather as examples of experience in general. By ideal experimentation, which Husserl calls "free variation," we discover what the really generic traits of experience and existence are; discover that time, some sort of space, certain dimensions of quality (such as inten- sity), memory, desire, order, contingency, are features of ex- perience which cannot be generalized away and leave anything conceivable. Metaphysics is a priori but experiential, though non- inductive. It is deduction from generic intuitions, experiences of experience as such. Positivists deny such intuitions, except as syntactical. For instance, they hold that possibility is either a mere matter of language, or of the actual laws of nature. To ask if other laws are or were possible is to consult human speech conventions. If nature wished to change her comprehensive habits, her laws, she must consult us. In generalizing to the limit we come back to our little species of organism, or at best, to a highly special aspect of experience. What we should come back to is experience as such, that is, abstracting from all that is merely human or merely animal (the need to sleep, sex, the limitation to a specious present of just this or that length, etc.) but not abstracting from features without which no experience at</page><page sequence="16">C. Hartshorne I99 all would be conceivable, features whose infinite variability is proof of their universality, such as memory, joy, suffering, con- trast, etc. The logical status of metaphysical propositions can be briefly indicated. Consider the proposition: The relatively indeter- minate future is relatively indeterminate. Formally this is ana- lytic; but so is, "The absolutely determinate future is absolutely determinate." Thus mere syntax will not help us decide between these propositions. But the difference between them is that the first proposition has experiential meaning and the second has not. The indeterminate future is the future as any and every experi- ence, however imaginatively varied, depicts it. The partial indefiniteness of the future, increasing as degree of futurity increases (implying that there is some amount or degree of deter- minism, of order, in the time process) is that by which we identify the future as such.5 The ball leaves the bat "before" it reaches the fielder in the experience of a spectator in that the latter's perception of the first position of the ball contains the second position only as a more or less indefinite, problematic anticipation, while the perception of the second position contains the definite awareness of the first, as immediate memory. (Still shorter time intervals will make the point clearer). It may seem that memory is more or less indefinite also. But it is not upon any such indefi- niteness that the identification of memory as such depends. The most perfect retention of the perception of the first position of the ball would not confuse this retention with present experience, for it would retain the non-committal character of the original perception as to whether the fielder was to catch or miss the ball, whereas the experience of the catch (in the case supposed) in- volves in its memory background the just preceding history of the ball. Thus the vagueness of foresight is essential both to fore- sight and to memory, and to any knowledge of events as such (in spite of what one type of theology has said about omniscience being timeless). Such metaphysical judgments are a priori, though not formally analytic. To deny them is to utter no formal non-sense. Yet it 6 See my Beyond Humanism, Chicago, Willett Clark, I937.

Metaphysics is the science of the uttermost generalities, which lie behind linguistic expression. How could the evidence for them be merely formal? Or how could it be inductive in the ordinary sense, when even to state what induction is, let alone to give its justification, is to employ metaphysical ideas, such as the idea of time (in its generic meaning)? Metaphysically erroneous beliefs are not, except verbally, con- ceivable. The criterion of the inconceivability of the opposite is of course useless in dealing with special cases of existence. It is also useless if inconceivable means "not easily conceived", espe- cially by one who would rather fail than succeed. But the most general conceptions can never be wholly inaccessible, and we must be able to judge, with whatever difficulty and danger, when we are using them in accordance with the meaning which experience, imaginatively varied, is able to give them, and when we are con- tradicting that meaning and talking non-sense, even though with good syntax. It is not inconceivability in the sense of a blank before the mind (like the inconceivability of unknown sensory qualities) that is in question, but contradiction of what is and must be conceived concerning some general feature of experience. Mathematics also disproves by showing inconceivability; but only with regard to formal structure. Metaphysics cannot reduce its ideas to formal structure alone. It must rely upon more elusive data than can be literally embodied in symbolic sets and opera- tions; though I believe mathematical clarity can in a manner be employed in metaphysics, which like all science other than pure mathematics is a branch of applied mathematics (Peirce). Positivists would have us think that metaphysical ideas have only emotional meaning, value but not truth. However, if truth is correspondence, there may be a greater correspondence between the idea, say, which a theist has of God, and the objective World- Unity, than there is between the latter and the atheistic concep- tion. One thing seems sure, a correspondence between our most general ideas and the most general, the strictly general, aspects of nature, if any, could not be established by the same method as correspondence of special ideas to special cases in nature. This is overlooked because we can go from less to more general cases</page><page sequence="18">C. Hartshorne 201 (thanks to the absolutely general principle of causality or world- unity, the principle of inducibility), and because through such "generalization" special cases of such majestic sweep are reached that it is forgotten they are still special cases (the character of the world during some cosmic epoch), and forgotten also that even greater generality was presupposed in the scientists faith in the world-order, not to mention in the most general ethical and aesthetic principles implicit in his actions and thought. The truth seems plain: not all generality in knowledge is the product of generalization, on the contrary something more general is always simply given, rooted, one might say, in instinct, or in something deeper and less specialized than instinct, the will to live. The demand that metaphysical ideas should have the same kind of fruitfulness as scientific, by yielding specific predictions, must be weighed against a counter claim, that the whole value of more or less particular truths lies in their illustrating and giving content to completely general truths-manifesting, say, the good- ness of God, and details of the kingdom of ends of which He is the focus; so that without the sense of such strictly general truths the value of all less general ones tends to vanish; if not entirely, then, on this theory, because the general truths are only driven into the subconscious (the range of whose contents is even greater than Freud supposes) rather than lost altogether. How is it to be proved that we live only to know the details of the world but not the world? To view nature as a mere system of particles and waves, immensely complex to be sure, and majestically ordered, but in the large mindless, may quite obviously be as much an error, a missing of something objective, as it would be to look upon one's friends in this manner alone. (Theologians have been prevented from making much of this point by their insistence that God is not, in any reasonable sense, the mind of the world- body, but rather the absolutely independent cause of the world. A man may be permitted to accept theism without assuming responsibility for all the logical processes of theologians of other times, or their too literal contemporary followers.) Positivism is not wrong in trying to state the world in terms of human experience. In some sense this has to be done. But to look for light upon the existence and nature of necessary features</page><page sequence="19">202 Tendencies in Positivism of reality by searching only those clear-cut data whose function is to guide the organism among the accidental details of the envi- ronment, and finding no light thus, to deny that there are such necessary features is less than adequate technique. For example, with Hume, positivists find no datum which directly reveals causality, the principle of connectedness which makes inference intelligible. So the principle has to be itself inferred, or rather just set up, used on instinct or because there is no practical alter- native. And so the organic interdependence of the world (not complete with respect to the future) is denied, and science is viewed, not as knowledge of the future, but as a wager. Yet experience does directly, though not obviously, illustrate "causal efficacy." In aesthetic intuition we directly possess past and future (the latter in outline only) both as unified in the pattern of the present.6 Memory, anticipation, aesthetic harmony and discord, are clues in immediate experience to the order of the time process. They are the basis of our very idea of time, which exter- nal sense-perception does not adequately illustrate (its datum does not exhibit how the past and future are integrated with the present; and this integration is time). That the order of the world is not only in time but in space, that it connects us not only with our past and future but with other individuals, is also directly given, in principle, though in particular only in a narrow range of cases, essentially limited to our relations with our own bodily parts, cells, or molecules. That we do not intuit these very distinctly is taken to prove we do not intuit them at all, by the fallacious inference that only the distinct is genuine or impor- tant. Prick my flesh and I have a vivid sense of suffering. Is this suffering merely mine? It is felt as in my body, not merely in my mind. Well, the parts of my body are also little organisms. If I directly seem to share pain with some of them (not distin- guished as individuals, but blurred together in a mass, my "flesh" as I feel it), what is this but direct though indistinct testimony to an emotional overlapping between me and other individuals? The injured cells, including perhaps certain nerve cells, may have their own suffering, which enters vaguely into mine. Call this an hypothesis if you like; but it seems to be rather an attempt to 6 See A. N. Whitehead, Symbolism (1927).</page><page sequence="20">C. Hartshorne 203 describe the given as such, not just to arrive at its explanatory cause. The datum is "shared pain." This datum verifies the hypothesis. The panpsychic-aesthetic explanation can hardly work with- out assuming a religious form. For only a supreme psyche could provide the cosmic version of the principle of order which experience, so analyzed, exhibits. Such a psyche will not be the non-interacting God of Thomism and the innumerable similar doctrines, but precisely the most universally interacting, the all-sensitive, psyche which religion has been trying, in spite of the unwitting sabotage of theologians, to teach us about. To return to our problem of anthropomorphism. There ought to be a language deanthropomorphized enough to express a dog's sensations as they are to him, yet in precise comparison to the experiences of the mind knowing the dog as these are to that mind. Only one such language is conceivable, but it is something more than just a language: the knowledge, superior to symbolic thought, realized in the sympathetic intuitions of God. Whether or not God can be verified by the metaphysical method outlined, I should like to close with the suggestion that, so far from being anthropomorphic, theology is the only radical way to overcome anthropomorphism. The generic intuitions, of which the idea of God is the explicit epitome, bringing out their essential unity,7 are those by virtue of which man's "reach"-in general outlines-is great enough to reveal to him how slight is his "grasp"-in specific details. If man does not, in general, know what the highest mode of knowledge would be, he does not know why his mode of knowledge is not the highest. He does know it, however. He knows that the highest mode of knowledge would not be less than this, to feel the feelings, and think the thoughts, and share in the volitions, of others without losing his own indi- viduality-in short, to fully love them. Without perfect sym- pathy no mind could find reality perspicuous. For this obvious, this really self-evident, truth we should find a place in our philosophy. 7 That philosophical theology can be more rigorously logical than it has hitherto suc- ceeded in being I have sought to show in my book, Man's Vision of God and the Logic of 'heism.
