<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE PROBABLE DATE OF JAIMINI AND HIS SUTRAS BY Prof. G. V. DEVASTHALI, M.A. H, P. T. College, Nasik Jamini, the author of the M. S., shares the fate common to all, particularly the pre-cla9sical, Sanskrit writers and we hardly know anything about him beyond his name and the traditional account of his death at the hand of an elephant. 1 References to the name of Jaimini in ancient literature are, at best, only vague and indecisive. Thus we know of a Jaiminlya Samhitã and a Jaiminlya Brãhmana belonging to the Sãma-veda. We also find a Srauta as well as a Grhya Sutra ascribed to Jaimini. The Asvalãyana and the Sãmkhãyana Grhya Sütras, on the other hand, put the name of Jaimini in lists of doubtful authenticity. Thus the identity of this Jaimini with the author of the M. S. is extremely doubtful. Nor do we get any clear reference to our Jaimini in the Mbh. or in the Buddhist or Jain literature. While the Buddhistic and Jain literature observes strict silence about Jamini, the Mbh. refers to him only as an ancient sage and not as a philosopher, 8 though, it must be remembered, ' it recognizes the existence of Mlmãmsã. ' Panini 's acquaintance with Mlmãmsã becomes also pretty certain when we find him giving a special sütra to the explanation of forms like ' Mlmãmsante. ' 3 But strange as the name is 4 it is ignored in Panini and the Mahã-bhãsya, which, however, knows of the Mlmãmsakas, probably adherents of this school,4 but more probably those of the Vedãnta.5 Patañjali, how- ever, does show acquaintance with the mlmãmsã term, parisam- khyã and 5 ts well-known example. 6 The same holds good in the case of the Kalpa Sütras. They do refer to the mlmãmsã rules and doctrines. Thus the doctrine of Sruti being stronger than Smrti is given by Apastamba when he writes 'gimf 9 7 which may very well be compared with M. S. I. 3. 3. The familiarity which the Kalpa Sütras show with mlmãmsã is so great that no less a critic than Dr. Keith declares that 4 they must » Pt IT. 34. * Hopkins, Great Epic of India, p. 97. «'* Astadhyayi III. 16. 1 Keith, Kid., p. 5 n. 1. 6 Kano, p. 4. 5 Pat., vol.

S. It is in the M. S. itself that we have anything like a clear and definite reference to Jaimini as a philosopher. Thus along with other authorities in the field, Jaimini is found to refer to himself in no fewer than five places. 8 ' Jaimini's views are cited in the B. S. at least ten times ( I. 2. 28 ; I. 2. 31 ; I. 3. 31 ; III. 2.40 ; III. 4. 2 ; III. 4. 18 ; III. 4. 40 ; IV. 3. 12 ; IV. 4. 5 ; IV. 4.1 1) ; but only two of these viz. 1. 3. 31 and III.2. 40. can find some parallel in the M. S. VI. 1. 5 and II. 1. 14. 3 All other clear references to Jaimini, as an authority on philosophy, are to be found in works belonging to a date only posterior to that of the B. Sutra. Comparison of the contents of the M. S. with those of the Sutras of other systems appears to show that the M. S. is, very probably, ' the earliest of the six Darsanas preserved to us. ' 4 It may not, indeed be one of the earliest products of the Sütra period,5 but it is not, at the same time, the latest of them all ; and is, almost beyond doubt, the earliest of all the extant works expo- unding the six Darèanas. " The M. S. does not contain any allu- sion to the existence of a work dealing with the interpretation of the Upanisads" and is, therefore, anterior to the extant B. Sütra.6 Taking into consideration all these circumstances, Dr. Keith concludes ' that the M. S. does not date after 200 A. D.; but that it is probably not much earlier, since otherwise it would have been natural to find in the Mbh, some reference to it and its author. ' 7 Prof. Kane, however, refers to YäjSavalkya Smrti ( I. 3 ) which mentions mlmãmsã as one of the fourteen Vidyãs and concludes that ' the lowest limit to which the extant Pürva- mhnämsäsütras can be brought dowD is about 100 A. D ; the highest limit being about 300 B. C. 8 Even here Prof. Kane is not as dogmatic as Dr. Keith and accepts the possibility of the date being pushed back a few centuries even beyond 300 B. C. 9 Now it is but well-known that Buddhism is one of the surest land-marks in the field of ancient Indian chronology and we speak of a work as being post-Buddhistic or pre-Buddhistic according as it makes or does not make a reference to Buddha Keith, KM., p. 3. 2 M.

Applying this test to the M. S. we find that for want of any reference to Buddha and his doctrines therein, the work of Jaimini will have to be labelled as pre-Buddhistic. Both Dr. Keith and Prof. Kane have marked this absence of 4 any express reference to Buddhist dogma and philosophy ' ; but they draw no conclusion therefrom thinking possibly that no very definite conclusion can be based on this omission on the part of Jaimini, since there was no compelling occasion for him to refer to Buddhism. This view, however, does not seem to be quite Bound. On the contrary, one might legitimately argue that had Buddhism had any hold on the society in the days of Jaimini, he would certainly have tried his best to attack and demolish it. The mlmãmsã doctrine of Yajña and its reward requires the assumption of an abiding soul 5 and had any sort of Ksanikatva-vãda been already in the field successfully enga- ging the attention of the people is it possible that Jaimini would have done nothing to refute it and loosen its hold on the publio mind while dealing with Dharma ? Is there anything that is more deadly opposed to Karma-kãnda than the ksanikatvavãda preached by Lord Buddha ? Under these circumstances would it not be wrong to argue that Jaimini had no occasion to refer to Buddha and his doctrine ? The absence of any reference to Buddhistic doctrines would thus appear to be a clear proof of the M. S. belonging to a date prior to the rise of Buddhism in India. The truth of the above argument will be glaringly clear when we find even the Vrttikära-the earliest known exponent of the M. S.-could not help refuting some Buddhistic theory. 1 This only means that Buddhism had gained some ground at the time of the Vrttikãra whereas Jaimini found it conspicuous by its absence or at any rate thoroughly negligible though present. This conclusion regarding a pre-Buddhistic date for the M. S. is again supported by the use of the word Buddha by Jaimini in M. S. I. 2. 33 2 where the ferm signifies nofc the founder of Bud- dhism, but simply 4 one who knows'. Had Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, been well-known in his days, Jaimini would cer- tainly have avoided the term Buddha rather than use it in such a general sense thus showing himself absolutely unfamiliar with the famous Lord Buddha. It would thus appear more probable, 1 For various views on this passage and further references vide Jha Coramentaration Volume, p. 115ff. 2 &lt; 9 [ Annals B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="4">66 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute than not, that not only was Buddhism not already in the field at the time of Jaimini, but that even its founder had not as yet attai- ned to the fame and glory that was destined to be his within a few years after Jaimini. The latest, date, therefore, that can plausibly be given to Jaimini and his work can at the most synchronize with the earlier years of the life of Lord Buddha-then known only as prince Siddhãrtha. The relation of Jaimini's work with the Ealpa Sütras is another faot of great importance in connection with the question regarding the date of the former. If we rely upon the interpreta- tions of Sabara-and there is no reason why we should not-the M. S. presupposes the existence of the Ealpa Sutras. In one adhikarana of four sütras Jaimini discusses the validity of the Kalpa Sutras and concludes that they are not intrinsically valid. 1 This adhikarana called the Ealpasüträsvatahprämänyädhikarana, has led some to argue that the M. S. of Jaimini must belong to a period posterior to that of the Kalpa Sutras. Such a conclusion, however, would not be wholly accurate. The adhikarana referred to above merely shows that Jaimini knew of some Ealpa Sutras ; but that does not mean that Jaimini flourished only after the Ealpa Sütra period : or that no Ealpa Sûtra was composed after him. We have, indeed, good evidence to show that a good many of these Sütras betray the influence of the mlmämsä and also an acquaintance with the arguments which are to be found in the M. S. of Jaimini. Ãpastamba, in particular, appears to show some familiarity with Jaimini and his work. Thus Ãpastamba in his Dharma Sütra 1. 1. 4. 8 seems to be acquainted with the doctrine of Jaimini regarding the relative importance of a positive Vedic text and usage. Ãpastamba I. 4. 12. 11 is almost an echo of M. S. IV. 1. 2. Ãpastamba also appears to Bhow acq- uaintance with the work of Jaimini in II. 6. 14. 13 which can very well be oompared with the M. S. IV. 7. 30. It would thus appear that Jaimini's work presupposes the existence of some Ealpa Sütras ; and that some of the Ealpa Sütras also, in their turn, presuppose the existence of the M. S. Paradoxical as the statement is, it can very well be explained by postulating for Jaimini's work a date which would fall somewhere in the middle of the so-called sütra period, so that there would be nothing » M. S , I. 3. 11-14,</page><page sequence="5">On the Probable Date of Jaimini and his Satras 67 unnatural if Jaimini shows acquaintance with the earlier Kalpa Sutras and at the same time is seen to influence those belonging to the later part of the sütra period. Now we come to a point which seems to me highly important particularly because it appears to have upto now escaped the notice of all eminent scholars who have toiled to fix the date of Jaimini. I mean the relation of Jaimini with Yäska, the author of the Nirukta. ' In Nirukta VII. 5£f. we have a very interest- ing discussion about the form of the deities invoked at sacrifices and in MantraB and various views are put forth viz. that they have an anthropomorphic aspeot or that they have no such aspect and so on. This very subject is discussed in the Purvamlmãmsã- sQtra IX. 1. 6-10, where lhe authoritative conclusion seems to be that the deity in a sacrifice has no corporeal form. ' 1 Besides this there are two more places where both Yäska and Jaimini are dealing with one and the same topio. 8 A careful comparison of these passages is, indeed, at once interesting as well as instr&gt; uctivé, for it furnishes us with an altogether new piece of evid- ence whioh helps us a good deal in fixing the date of Jaimini. Thus Jaimini in M. S. II. 1. 1 appears to repeat the very idea which Yäska gives us in his Nirukta when he writes ' ïïHITrcra: I '. And whereas Yäska shows as though he is referring to some authority while giving this definition, Jaimini appears to be self-relying. Thus we find the former introducing his definitions of Nãma and Ãkhyãta by the remark ' this is gener- ally given as the definition of a noun and a verb. ' 5 Jaimini on the other hand, merely defines a verb in the words '»rraTOÏ: whioh bear a very olose resemblance to Yäska's ' 'l ( Nir. 1. 1 ). Again M. S. II. 1. 2-4 appear to be an echo of the words of Yâska when he writes ' enraie ' ' Compare with these words of Yâska the following words of Jaimini, vnítaí , ^Tgcqwr # snrìnf ìnmfò, ^ sniffi * regit m^rnnnemti ' ( M. S., II. 1. 2-4 ). Not even a casual reader can fail to notice the superiority of Yäska over Jaimini so far as expression is concerned. Yäska is decidedly more exact, more elegant and more impressive than I Kane, p. 3. ® Nir., 1. 1 ; 1. 15 and 16 ; and M.

Though, however, such a conclusion shall be run down as being more hypothetical than real, for want of any strong and positive evid- ence corroborating it, yet the fact that there are striking resem- blances between Yãska and Jaimini cannot be negatived. And the only other possible conclusion that it seems possible to deduce therefrom is that both the authors are quite unfamiliar with eaoh other and have drawn upon some common source. The conclu- sion that we are thus almost forced to accept is that Yãska and Jamini show no acquaintance with one another and are almost contemporaneous. They could not have been separated from one another by several centuries as the present generally accept- ed theories regarding their dates require us to assume. Now let us turn lo the other pair of passages where these authors discuss another topic in common. Both Yãska as well as Jaimini mightily refute the theory of the yajñikas according to which the Vedas are devoid of any sense whatever. Yãska devotes one whole section to the prima facie view which he ascri- bes to Eautsa and then gives his refutation in a separate section altogether. 1 Jaimini also gives no less than nine Sütras to give the refutation of the prima facie view and establish his Siddhãnta. Comparing the statment of the pürvapaksa as giren by both these writers we find that five Sütras of Jaimini find an exact parallel in the Nirukta, of course, only so far as the sense is concerned. 8 Two more are condensed into one by Yãska who writes ' *Tïl% i ' corresponding to Jaimini's ' srnNwrH» iRTCtïr » ' and ' I ' But the remaining two Sutras 8 from the work of Jaimini find no parallel in the Nirukta. Here once ag&amp;in the resemblances are so weighty that they cannot be lightly set aside. But despite the points of resemblance in gen- eral neither of the authors can be pronounced as being the borrower. And though in some cases Yãska appears to be more accurate, in one case at least Jaimini enters more into details than Yãska who has condensed two of Jaimini's Sutras into one.4 It is again interesting to note Yâska's silence about two more arguments which Jaimini has put in the mouth of the Pûrva- paksin. According to Yãska the Pürvapaksin is Eautsa, a pure ' Nir., I. 15 and 16. 2 M. S., I. 2. 31-33 and 35 and 37. « M. 8., I. 8. 34-35. « M.

Yäksa himself also, not being a Mlmämsaka, did not think it worth while to incorporate into his work the arguments which were important only for a Mlmämsaka. Jaimini, however, being a Mlmämsaka «ould not neglect these objections which if left unrefuted were sure to be directed against the prominent dogmas of the Mlmãmsakas. Thus Jaimini makes the Pürvapaksin argue that Mantras have no significance- ( i ) because there is no teaching of the meaning as there is of the text ( of the Mantras ) and ( ii ) because there would be connec- tion with ephemeral things. ( cf. and aTRRRhfhTRT- I M. S. I. 2. 37 and 39 ). Striking as the resemblances are between the statements of the Pürvapaksa as given by Yãska snd Jaimini, their statements of the Uttarapaksa have very little in common. Whereas Jaimini makes his statement more technical, Yãska simply takes refuge in ordinary experience of every-day life ( ). This section is, therefore, not of much use to us so far as the ques- tion of the relative ohronology of the two writers is conoerned. The third pair of passages referred to above oomprises M. S. IX. 1. 6-10 and Nir. VII. 6-7. Though here the topic is common yet there appear to be no resemblances of style and phraseology which might warrant us in drawing any conclusion regarding the relative dates of their authors. This may then be put down as the general outcome of the examination of parallel passages in the Nir. and the M. S. that their authors were not familiar with one another ; that they sometimes appeared to have borrow- ed from some common source and that they must have been almost contemporaries of each other, not separated by any wide gulf of time. If this conclusion be accurate we should be required to give to Jaimini a date which would be far anterior to what has been proposed by Dr. Keith and supported by almost all scholars. But his unfamiliarity with Yãska and vioe versa, his relation with the Kalpa Sutras, and his unfamiliarity with Buddha and his doctrines seem to me to be arguments strong enough to warrant us in putting the date of Jaimini as being at least not late? than about 500 B. G. or the beginning of Buddhism in India. But before such a conclusion can be put forth with even the slightest hope of finding acceptance among scholars there are 1 M. S , I, Í. 31-32. « M. 8., 1. 1. 34-35.</page><page sequence="8">70 Annals oj the Bhatidatkat Oriental Reseat ch Institute certain points which require some illucidation. It has been al- ready noted above that though they know of the mlmämsakas yet neither Panini nor Pataãjali make any reference to Jaimini. This appears to speak for a date later than that of these two grammarians. But we may ask, does Jaimini refer to Pãnini or Patañjali ? Now if absence of references by itself is proof enough why not conclude that Jaimini is even earlier than these gram- marians ? The fact, however, appears to be that neither Panini nor Patañjali had any occasion to make any reference to the name of Jaimini, nor had Jaimini one to do the same in the oase of these grammarians. It would, therefore, be best not to lay too much premium on this absence of reference to Jaimini on the pa* t of Panini and Patañjali. The same oould be said of the so called absence of reference to Jaimini, the philosopher, in the Mbh. It is but too well known that Jaimini is not only mentioned in the Mbh. but is even credited with an edition of that work of which only one parvan ( the Asvamedhaparvan ) has been preserved for us. But, it is argued, this Jaimini that is thus referred to in the Mbh. is not a philosopher but a sage and oannot therefore, be identified with the author of the M. S. Such is, indeed, the argument that makes Dr. Keith declare that the M. S. cannot be muoh earlier than 200 A. D. 1 But as has been already remarked negative evidence is always shaky and can have no intrinsic value in the absence of positive corroborative evidence. The very idea, moreover, that the author of the M. S. is not mentioned in the Mbh. is swept off its legs by the fact that Jaimini is referred to as a sage and not as a philosopher in the Mbh.-a fact which again speaks perhaps for the antiquity of Jaimini. It is a fact, admitted on all hands, that the Purvamlmâriisã in its origin discussed the various details of sacrifices and a little later came to concern itself with the discussion and interpreta* tion of several Vedio texts with a view to resolve any conflict that might arise between them. Thus Jaiminťs M. S. and the views propounded by him are quite innocent of any philosophy in the real sense of the term. What wonder then that Jaimini, dealing with Dharm a-and not philosophy-should be referred to as a sage and not as a philosopher ? If at all then any conclusion is to be based on the evidenoe supplied by the Mbh. we shall have to a 1 Keith, KM., p. 7.</page><page sequence="9">Ott the Probable Date of Jaitnini and his Satras 7 1 admit that the Mbh. when it refers to Jaimini as a sage, rather than as 9 philosopher is, in faot referring to the author of the M. S. only, preaching Dharma alone without any admixture of metaphysics and other allied topics, which were literally fathered upon him by later writers who wanted to turn the Pürva- mlmãmsã into a philosophical system in the real sense of the term and thus bring it in a line with the other Darsanas. Reviewing the whole set of arguments, now it may be said that Jaimini makes no reference to Buddhism-the deadliest enemy of the Karma-Kãnda ; that suoh a reference was, in fact, quite pertinent as is clear from the fact that the Vrttikära actu- ally went out of his way to refute some of the Buddhistic theo- ries : that the term Buddha did not, as yet, signify the founder of Buddhism ; that Jaimini and Yãska do not show any familia- rity with one another though they appear to hold some views in common which are possibly drawn by either of them from some common source 5 that Jaimini and Ealpa Sutras show familiarity with one another which can be explained only on the assum- ption that Jaimini 's work belongs to the middle of the Sütra period *, that Jaimini not being mentioned by Pãnini and Pat- añjali is simply due to their having no occasion for doing so ; and that the Mbh. does mention Jaimini who is rightly referred to as a sage, that he really is, as he deals with Dharma, and not as a philosopher, he having scrupulously set aside the metaphysi- cal discussions which were supplied into the system only as late as the seventh century A. D. by Prabhäkara and Kumãrila ; and that all these arguments appear to justify the conclusion that Jaimini and his work must be at least pre-Buddhistic ; and hence must belong to a date which cannot be later than about 500 B. 0. The conclusion thus deduoed on the strength of the various items noted above again finds some corroboration from another quarter. That Sabara, the author of the earliest extant com- mentary on the M. S., is himself far removed from the author of the Sutra is a generally accepted fact. It oan also be proved by showing how a variety of interpretations-sometimes even three or four of them-is proposed for some adhikaranas ; 1 and how even variant readings had crept into Jaimini's work by his time2 1 M. 8., XX. 2. 21-24 ; IX. 2. 25-28 ; X. 1. 1-3. « M. S„ XI. 1. 14.</page><page sequence="10">72 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and also by pointing out that Sabara was preceded by not only the Vrttikära and Upa var sa but also by several others all of whom had written commentaries on the M. S., though unfortu- nately none of these has yet been found out. Dr. Keith seems to allow a period of about two centuries only between the Sütrakära and the BhSsyak&amp;ra, whom he places at about 200 A. D. and 400 A. Ď. respectively. 1 Prof. Kane, however, appears to be more accurate when he allows a period of four to eight Oenturies to elapse between Jaimini ( 100 A. D. to 300 B. O. ) and Sabara ( at least before 500 A. D. ). s Nor does he seem to have any objection if this intervening period be increased by a few centuries more. 8 Now the date of Sabara is again not very definitely fixed and we find Dr. Keith putting him at 400 A. Ď. at the earliest, and Prof. Kane asserting that Sabara wrote his Bhãsya at least before 500 A. Ď. while tradition would make him the father of the foun- der of the Vikrama era ( 57 B. C. ) and thus put him at about 100 B. C. Whatever may be said regarding the other details of the ř tradition about Sabara, at least so far as the question of date is concerned, it seems to be nearer the truth than the two eminent scholars just quoted above. Prof. K. Chattopadhyaya has given arguments leading to the conclusion that Sabara belongs to a date which is prior, not only to that of Ãsanga and Vasubandhu, but also to that of Nãgãrjuna. 8 Internal evidence also appears to / * favour this early date for Sabara. If thus Sabara s date is fixed at about 100 B. C. and if Sabara is separated from Jaimini by four to eight centuries, as shown above, the latest date that Jaimini can be assigned to cannot be later than 500 B. C.
