Fish 1 On May Day, 1977, Pat Kelly, an outfielder for the Baltimore Orioles, hit two home runs in a game against the California Angels. The Baltimore Sun devoted three columns to the story, in part because Kelly had rarely displayed such power (he had hit only five home runs in the entire previous season), but largely because of the terms in which he saw his accomplishment. In fact, he didn't see it as his at all but as the working through him of divine Providence. Two years previously Kelly had ex- perienced a religious conversion. As he reports it, "I had been like a normal ballplayer. I was an extreme party-er, hanging around in bars and chasing all the women. But then this change came over me, and I have dedicated myself to Him." The effects of this change are described by the Sun reporter, Michael Janofsky, whose comments betray some understandable exasperation: It is not even possible to discuss [with Kelly] the events of yester- day's game--or any game--on strictly a baseball level. He does not view his home runs as merely a part of athletic competition. They are part of his religious existence. One assumes that Janofsky had tried to discuss the events of yesterday's game and found that Kelly simply did not recognize the facts to which sports writers' questions routinely refer. These are the facts that exist on "a strictly baseball level," a wonderful phrase that can serve to identify the subject of this paper, a level of observation or discourse at which 0093-1896/78/0404-0001$01.72 625</page><page sequence="2">626 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases meanings are obvious and indisputable, the level of the ordinary, the normal, the usual, the everyday, the straightforward, the literal. From Janofsky's point of view it is this level that Kelly has lost, but from Kelly's point of view it has simply been redefined: as Janofsky reports, he now literally sees everything as a function of his religious existence; it is not that he allegorizes events after they have been normally perceived but that his normal perception is of events as the evidence of supernatural forces. Kelly played on May 1st only because the regular right fielder came down with conjunctivitis, and "even that," Janofsky exclaims, "he interpreted as divine intervention." "Interpreted" is not quite right be- cause it suggests an imposition upon raw data of a meaning not inherent in them, but for Kelly the meaning is prior to the data which will always have the same preread shape. The effort that Janofsky must make be- fore he can read providential design into everyday occurrences is natural for the born-again Christian who would now have to make an effort wholly unnatural in order once again to see a "mere athletic competi- tion." What this suggests is that categories like "the natural" and "the everyday" are not essential but conventional. They refer not to prop- erties of the world but to properties of the world as it is given to us by our interpretive assumptions. In the world in which Janofsky is situated as an independent agent amidst equally independent phenomena, Kelly is an anomaly (and therefore noteworthy) because rather than accepting that world as it is, he populates it with the invisible presences demanded by his belief. That is, Janofsky assumes (without being aware of the assumption) that he speaks from a position above or below or to the side of belief, but in fact he speaks from within an alternative belief, one that gives him his world of "natural" causes as surely as Kelly's belief gives him a world alive with divine interventions. At stake here is the status of the ordinary. It would never occur to Janofsky to explain or defend the basis on which he describes events on a "strictly baseball level" (as he asks Kelly to explain and defend his point of view); he is simply describing what is there. That is what the ordinary is, that which appears to be there independently of anything we might say or think about it. It does not require comment (one doesn't write news stories about it) because it is obvious, right there on the surface; anyone can see it. But what anyone sees is not independent of his verbal and mental categories but is in fact a product of them; and it is because these categories, rather than being Stanley E. Fish's most recent work is The Living Temple: George Her- bert and Catechizing. He is currently preparing a collection of his theoreti- cal essays and completing a book on Milton's aesthetic. His previous contributions to Critical Inquiry are "Interpreting the Variorum" (Spring 1976) and "Interpreting 'Interpreting the Variorum' " (Autumn 1976).</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 627 added to perception, are its content that the entities they bring into being seem to be a part of the world in the sense that they were there before there was anyone to perceive them. In other words, while the ordinary and the obvious are always with us, because we are always in the grip of some belief or other, they can change. They have changed for Kelly and that is why his story can bear the weight I am putting on it. "I had," he says, "been like a normal ballplayer," by which he means that he saw what normal ballplayers see. Now what he just as normally sees are divine interventions. His conversion follows the pattern prescribed by Augustine in On Christian Doctrine. The eye that was in bondage to the phenomenal world (had as its constitutive principle the autonomy of that world) has been cleansed and purged and is now capable of seeing what is really there, what is obvious, what anyone who has the eyes can see: "to the healthy and pure internal eye He is everywhere. ... ."' He is everywhere not as the result of an interpretive act self-consciously per- formed on data otherwise available, but as the result of an interpretive act performed at so deep a level that it is indistinguishable from con- sciousness itself. 2 I have lingered over this example because it seems to me to bear (however indirectly) on the question most frequently debated in current literary discussions: What is in the text? That question assumed that at some (perhaps molecular) level what is in the text is independent of and prior to whatever people have said about it, and that therefore the text is stable, even though interpretations of it may vary. I want to argue that there always is a text (just as there always is an ordinary world) but that what is in it can change, and therefore at no level is it independent of and prior to interpretation. My literary example is Milton's Samson Agonistes, a text whose history has a surprising relationship to Pat Kelly's conversion. Like Milton's other major works, Samson Agonistes has received many readings. Among the readings now considered acceptable is one in which Samson's story is seen in relationship to the life of Christ. In its starkest form, the argument for this reading has the air of a paradox: Samson Agonistes is about Christ because he is nowhere mentioned. Such an argument seems to fly in the face of the rules of evidence, but in fact it illustrates something very important about evidence: it is always a func- tion of what it is to be evidence for, and is never independently available. That is, the interpretation determines what will count as evidence for it, 1. Augustine, On Christian Doctrine, trans. D. W. Robertson, Jr. (New York, 1958), p. 13.</page><page sequence="4">628 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases and the evidence is able to be picked out only because the interpretation has already been assumed. In this case, the evidence is evidence for a typological interpretation, and that is why it is evidence even if, in some sense, it is not there. Typology is a way of reading the Old Testament as a prefiguration or foreshadowing of events in the life of Christ. It is not, at least in its Protestant version, allegorical because it insists on respect- ing the historical reality of the type who is unaware of his significance as an anticipation of one greater than he. In Paradise Lost, this significance can be pointed out by the narrator who stands outside the con- sciousnesses of the characters and therefore can look forward to the new dispensation without violating typological decorum. In Samson Agonistes, however, there is no narrator, and the consciousnesses of the characters mark the limits of allowable awareness. It follows (given a disposition to read typology) that the absence of any reference to Christ, rather than being evidence that he is not being referred to, is evidence of Milton's intention to respect typological decorum. As William Madsen puts it, Instead of collapsing Samson and Christ, [Milton] is concerned with measuring the distance between the various levels of aware- ness ... possible to those living under the old dispensation and the level of awareness revealed by Christ.2 Once this characterization of Milton's intention has been specified, the text will immediately assume the shape that Madsen proceeds to de- scribe: If... Samson is viewed first of all as a concrete individual living in a concrete historical situation, then his significance for the Christian reader lies primarily in his inability to measure up to the heroic norm delineated in Paradise Regained.3 The fact that this significance is unavailable to the characters is precisely what makes it inescapable for the Christian reader. Moreover, it is not a figurative significance, one that is imposed on the text's literal level; rather it is built into the text as it is immediately seen by anyone who operates within Madsen's interpretive assumptions. A reader who was innocent of those assumptions would not see that significance, but he would see some other, and that other would be similarly the product of the assumptions within which he was operating. In either case (and in any other that could be imagined) the resulting meaning would be a literal one that followed directly upon a determination of what was in the text. The category "in the text" is usually thought to refer to something that is 2. William Madsen, From Shadowy Types to Truth (New Haven and London, 1968), p. 198. 3. Ibid., pp. 201-2.</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 629 irreducibly there independently of and prior to all interpretive activities. The example of Samson Agonistes suggests that what is perceived to be "in the text" is afunction of interpretive activities, although these activities are performed at so primary a level that the shapes they yield seem to be there before we have done anything. In other words, the category "in the text," like the category of the "ordinary," is always full (because there is never a point at which a set of interpretive assumptions is not in force), but what fills it is not always the same. For some readers in 1978, Christ is "in the text" of Samson Agonistes, for others he is not, and before the typological interpretation of the poem was introduced and developed by Michael Krouse in 1949, he was not "in the text" for anyone. Again, it is important to see that the question of what is in the text cannot be settled by appealing to the evidence since the evidence will have become avail- able only because some determination of what is in the text has already been made. (Otherwise it would be impossible to read.) Indeed the same piece of evidence will not be the same when it is cited in support of differing determinations of what is in the text. Thus for one reader the fact that Christ is not mentioned "proves" that he is not in the text, while for another the same "fact" (really not the same) proves that he is. Nor can one descend to a lower level of description and assert that at least that fact about the text (that Christ is not mentioned) is beyond dispute; for the two readers I posit would be stipulating two different notions of "mention," and indeed the second reader would be claiming that the mention of Samson includes Christ and that thus He is no less mentioned than his Old Testament prefiguration. This does not mean that the text of Samson Agonistes is ambiguous or unstable; it is always stable and never ambiguous. It is just that it is stable in more than one direction, as a succession of interpretive assumptions give it a succession of stable shapes. Mine is not an argument for an infinitely plural or an open text, but for a text that is always set; and yet because it is set not for all places or all times but for wherever and however long a particular way of reading is in force, it is a text that can change. 3 Perhaps a shorter example, one taken neither from the sports pages nor from literature but from (if you will pardon the expression) life, will make the point clearer. I have in mind a sign that is affixed in this unpunctuated form to the door of the Johns Hopkins University Club: PRIVATE MEMBERS ONLY I have had occasion to ask several classes what that sign means, and I have received a variety of answers, the least interesting of which is, "Only</page><page sequence="6">630 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases those who are secretly and not publicly members of this club may enter it." Other answers fall within a predictable and narrow range: "Only the genitalia of members may enter" (this seems redundant), or "You may only bring in your own genitalia," or (and this is the most popular read- ing, perhaps because of its Disney-like anthropomorphism) "Only genitalia may enter." In every class, however, some Dr. Johnson-like positivist rises to say, "But you're just playing games; everyone knows that the sign really means, 'Only those persons who belong to this club may enter it.' " He is of course right. Everyone does know (although as we shall see everyone does not always know the same thing), but we can still inquire into the source of that knowledge. How is it that a text so de- monstrably unstable can be stabilized to such a degree that a large number of people know immediately what it means? The answer can be found in the exercise performed by my students. What they did was move the words out of a context (the faculty club door) in which they had a literal and obvious meaning into another context (my classroom) in which the meaning was no less obvious and literal and yet was different. What they did not do was move away from a meaning that was available apart from a context to the various meanings contexts confer. Paradoxi- cally the exercise does not prove that the words can mean anything one likes, but that they always and only mean one thing, although that one thing is not always the same. The one thing they mean will be a function of the shape language already has when we come upon it in a situation, and it is the knowledge that is the content of being in a situation that will have stabilized it. In the case of PRIVATE MEMBERS ONLY, the knowledge is the knowledge of what to do with signs on faculty club doors. Those who enter the club do not first perceive the sign in some uninterpreted or acontextual form and then construe it so as to conform with the situation; rather, being in the situation means that they have already construed it, even before they see it. That is, to know what to do with signs on faculty club doors is already to have done it because that knowledge will already have been organizing perception. This is not to say that the knowledge of what to do with the signs on faculty club doors is itself stable, but that in whatever form it takes, it is always stabilizing. In many municipalities a business will incorporate as a club in order to secure certain tax advantages, and in some "dry" states incorporation is a way of circumventing laws that prohibit the public sale of liquor. In such situations the word "private" means "public" (it is not restrictive at all, except in the sense that any business establishment is restrictive), and the sign PRIVATE MEMBERS ONLY would be im- mediately understood to mean "anyone who has the price may enter." That would then be as literal a reading as "Only those persons who belong to this club may enter it" because to those whose understandings were an extension of the situation they were already in the words could mean nothing else. It may seem confusing and even contradictory to</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 631 assert that a text may have more than one literal reading, but that is because we usually reserve "literal" for the single meaning a text will always (or should always) have, while I am using "literal" to refer to the different single meanings a text will have in a succession of different situations. There always is a literal meaning because in any situation there is always a meaning that seems obvious in the sense that it is there independently of anything we might do. But that only means that we have already done it, and in another situation, when we have already done something else, there will be another obvious, that is, literal, meaning. The stronger sense of literal, in which "single" is inseparable from "once and for all," would itself make sense only if there were a meaning that was apprehensible apart from any situation whatsoever, a meaning that was not the product of an interpretation but was available in- dependently. Every literal meaning comes to us with that claim, but it is a claim that seems to be supportable only because an interpretive act is already in force but is so embedded in the situation (its structure is the structure of the situation) that it doesn't seem to be an act at all. We are never not in a situation. Because we are never not in a situation, we are never not in the act of interpreting. Because we are never not in the act of interpreting, there is no possibility of reaching a level of meaning beyond or below interpretation. But in every situation some or other meaning will appear to us to be uninterpreted because it is isomorphic with the inter- pretive structure the situation (and therefore our perception) already has. Therefore, there always will be a literal reading, but (1) it will not always be the same one and (2) it can change. In this newly defined sense, a literal reading can even be plural, as it is for my students when they are asked, "What does PRIVATE MEM- BERS ONLY mean?" Constituting their perception is not the knowledge of what to do with signs on faculty club doors but the knowledge of what to do with texts written on blackboards by professors of English litera- ture. That is, professors of English literature do not put things on boards unless they are to be examples of problematic or ironic or ambiguous language. Students know that because they know what it means to be in a classroom, and the categories of understanding that are the content of that knowledge will be organizing what they see before they see it. Irony and ambiguity are not properties of language but are functions of the expectations with which we approach it. If we expect a text to be am- biguous, we will in the act of reading it imagine situations in which it means first one thing and then another (there is no text with which this cannot be done), and those plural meanings will, in the context of that situation, be that text's literal reading. That is, in a situation in which the obvious (immediately apprehensible) reading is a plural one, meaning more than one thing will be the one thing a text means. In summary, then, there are two things I do not want to say about PRIVATE MEMBERS ONLY: that it has a literal meaning, and that it</page><page sequence="8">632 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases doesn't. It does not have a literal meaning in the sense of some irreduci- ble content which survives the sea change of situations; but in each of those situations one meaning (even if it is plural) will seem so obvious that one cannot see how it could be otherwise, and that meaning will be literal. 4 If the question of what is literal is important in literary discussions, it is the central question in the law where determining what a text (con- tract, statute, case, precedent, ruling) says is the business everyone is in. A close examination of the way that business is conducted will reveal a pattern that should by now be familiar. My example is a case that deals with the probating of wills, Riggs v. Palmer, New York, 1889.4 The deci- sion is prefaced by a rehearsal of the facts: "On the thirteenth day of August, 1880, Francis B. Palmer made his last will and testament, in which he gave small legacies to his two daughters, Mrs. Riggs and Mrs. Preston, the plaintiffs in this action, and the remainder to his grandson, the defendant Elmer E. Palmer." In 1882 the elder Palmer married one Mrs. Bressee, and there was some indication that he would alter the will so as to make his new wife the principal beneficiary. It was then that Elmer acted: "He knew," says the court of the provisions made in his favor ... and that he might prevent his grandfather from revoking such provisions, which he had man- ifested some intention to do, and to obtain the speedy enjoyment and immediate possession of his property, he willfully murdered him by poisoning him. He now claims the property and the sole question for our determination is, Can he have it? The defendants say that the testator is dead; that his will was made in due form, and has been admitted to probate, and that, therefore, it must have effect according to the letter of the law. It is with this last phrase-"the letter of the law"-that this example falls into line with the others. Elmer's lawyers have presented the court with a dilemma: either it must decide in favor of the client or it must go against what the law plainly says. The law in this case is a statute that reads as follows: All persons, except idiots, persons of unsound mind and infants, may devise their real estate, by a last will and testament, duly exe- cuted, according to the provisions of this article. 4. Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N.Y. 506, 22 N.E. 188 (1889). All further references to this text will be at 189.</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 633 In effect Elmer and his counsel are arguing that there is nothing in the statute that bars a murderer from inheriting or a victim from bequeath- ing his property to a murderer, and that therefore his act is irrelevant to the question of probate. The court begins rather badly by conceding Elmer's basic claim: "It is quite true that statutes regulating the making, proof, and effect of wills, and the devolution of property, if literally construed, and if their force and effect can in no way and under no circumstances be controlled or modified, give this property to the murderer." This would be a damaging admission were it not that as the decision unfolds the court proceeds to take it back. It does this by introducing the notion of pur- pose and by insisting that the statute be read in its light: The purpose of the statutes was to enable testators to dispose all of their estates to the objects of their bounty at death . .. and in considering and giving effect to them, this purpose must be kept in view. It was the intention of the law-makers that the donees in a will should have the property given to them. But it never could have been their intention that a donee who murdered the testator to make the will operative should have any benefit under it. Why could it "never have been their intention"? The court answers that question by invoking as one of the "general fundamental maxims of the common law," the principle that "No one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, or take advantage of his own wrong, or found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime." At this point the court's strategy becomes clear. It wants to find a way of reading the statute so that it bars Elmer from inheriting, and the way it finds is to assert that something goes without saying (that is why it is a matter of common, i.e., unwritten, law) and therefore has been said. The reasoning is the same that yields the typological reading of Samson Agonistes: just as the mention of Samson is understood to include a reference to Christ, so is the text of a statute understood (at least under this interpretive as- sumption) to include a proviso disallowing any claim founded upon the commission of a wrong. It is a very good argument, and the court errs only in thinking that in order to make it, the literal reading must be set aside. That is, the court apparently believes that only it is reading the statute with "a pur- pose in view" while the defendant is urging a reading of what the words literally express. The truth of the matter is that both are pointing to what the words literally express but in the light of two different purposes. The opposition between a literal and a nonliteral reading could be main- tained only if it were possible to conceive of a reading that did not follow from the assumption of some purpose or other, but as Kenneth Abra- ham observes,</page><page sequence="10">634 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases A statute without a purpose would be meaningless. .... to speak of the literal meaning of a statute ... is already to have read it in the light of some purpose, to have engaged in an interpretation.5 In other words, any reading that is plain and obvious in the light of some assumed purpose (and it is impossible not to assume one) is a literal reading; but no reading is the literal reading in the sense that it is avail- able apart from any purpose whatsoever. If it is assumed that the pur- pose of probate is to ensure the orderly devolution of property at all costs, then the statute in this case will have the plain meaning urged by the defendant; but if it is assumed that no law ever operates in favor of someone who would profit by his crime, then the "same" statute will have a meaning that is different, but no less plain. In either case the statute will have been literally construed, and what the court will have done is prefer one literal construction to another by invoking one purpose (as- sumed background) rather than another. It is not that we first read the statute and then know its purpose; we know the purpose first, and only then can the statute be read. This is exactly the sequence the court follows, and at one point the principle underlying its procedure is articu- lated: It is a familiar canon of construction that a thing which is within the intention of the makers of a statute is as much within the statute as if it were within the letter; and a thing which is within the letter of the statute is not within the statute, unless it be within the intention of the makers. The rhetoric of this sentence insists upon the distinction between what is intended and what is literally there, but the argument of the sentence takes the distinction away. It is your specification of the makers' inten- tion that tells you what is in the statute, not your literal reading of the statute that informs you as to its makers' intention. This would seem to suggest that one need only recover the makers' intention in order to arrive at the correct literal reading; but the documents (including even verbatim reports) that would give us that intention are no more available to a literal reading (are no more uninterpreted) than the literal reading it would yield. However one specifies what is in a statute--whether by some theory of strict constructionism or by some construction of an original intention--that specification will have the same status as the specification of what is in Samson Agonistes or of what PRIVATE MEM- BERS ONLY means. It can always be made, but as situations and the purposes which inform them change, it will have to be made again. 5. Kenneth Abraham, "Intention and Authority in Statutory Interpretation" (paper delivered at the 1977 Modern Language Association session on Law and Literature).</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 635 5 I could imagine someone objecting to the previous pages in the following way: "Aren't you in each of these examples simply talking about ambiguous language, language that can mean more than one thing?" My answer is that the objection would have force only if there were a kind of language to which ambiguous language could be op- posed. That is, to label a sentence "ambiguous" will be to distinguish it only if there are sentences that always and only mean one thing, and I would contend that there are no such sentences. I am not saying that sentences always have more than one meaning, but that the sentence which is perceived as having only one meaning will not always have the same one. In other words, I am as willing to say that all sentences are straightforward as I am to say that all sentences are ambiguous. What I am not willing to do is say that any sentence is by right either one or the other. That is, I wish to deny that ambiguity is a property of some sentences and not of others. Typically, the division of sentences into two classes (ambiguous, nonambiguous) is not defended; it is simply assumed in the course of presenting strings that are asserted to be obviously members of one or the other class. In a recent introduction to transformational grammar the following sentence is offered as an example of one that is ambiguous on its face: The suit is light.6 As the authors point out, the reference can be either to the suit's weight or its color, and the situation is not helped, they observe, when the sentence is expanded to read: The suit is too light to wear. The additional material is not sufficiently disambiguating because the words do not combine in such a way as to make one reading inescapable; but when the sentence is further expanded to read "The suit is too light to wear on such a cold day," the ambiguity, we are told, disappears. In the new sentence, the "semantic environment" specified by "cold day" blocks one of the possible readings of "light," and the result is a perfectly straightforward utterance. It is an elegant argument, but unfortunately it won't work. It takes only a moment of reflection to imagine a situation in which this sentence would have the reading that is now supposedly blocked. It so happens 6. John T. Grinder and Suzette Haden Elgin, Guide to Transformational Grammar (New York, 1973), p. 117.</page><page sequence="12">636 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases that I have a weakness for light-colored suits, and I have several that are heavy enough to wear on a cold day. My wife, however, is more con- scious of the proprieties of fashion than I am and is likely to say to me, "That suit is too light to wear on such a cold day," and be immediately understood as meaning that the suit is too light in color. M. F. Garrett offers a similar counterexample to a supposedly unambiguous sentence put forward by Katz and Postal: The stuff is light enough to carry. It is not ambiguous, Katz and Postal say, because "light enough to carry" cannot be understood to mean "light enough in color to be carried." But, objects Garrett, "it does not take an especially tortured context to make this the preferred reading: Scene: Highway patrolman lecturing to 3rd grade class. Patrolman: "When you are walking on a highway at night, it is important to wear light colored clothing or carry a light colored flag so that you will be visible to oncoming cars. For instance (holds up flag), this stuff is light enough to carry."' Katz and Postal might reply that what the counterexample shows is that the original sentence was not sufficiently explicit. If we were to add more information to it and write (let us say) "This stuff is light enough to carry even for a small child," it will be capable of one reading and of no other. But if this sentence were uttered by a manufacturer's representative, the word "carry" would be understood to mean "stock in inventory," and the speaker would be reminding a potential buyer that small children do not normally wear the darker colors. One could imagine counterexample following upon counterexample, but the result would always be the same; for no degree of explicitness will ever be sufficient to disambiguate the sentence if by disambiguate we understand render it impossible to con- ceive of a set of circumstances in which its plain meaning would be other than it now appears to be. The conclusion that Garrett draws from this and other examples is that all sentences are ambiguous, but then he is faced with the problem of explaining the fact that "we simply don't notice most of the am- biguities that we encounter."8 It is a problem because Garrett has moved away from one version of an error only to embrace another. He correctly sees that no sentence always means the same thing, but this leads him to affirm that every sentence has more than one meaning. What he does 7. M. F. Garrett, "Does Ambiguity Complicate the Perception of Sentences?" in Ad- vances in Psycholinguistics, ed. G. B. Flores d'Arcias and W. J. M. Levelt (New York, 1970), p. 54. 8. Ibid., p. 50.</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 637 not realize is that these positions are the same position in that they both assume a stage in the life of sentences before they are perceived in a context. It is just that in one position that stage is characterized by a timeless stability (means only one thing), in the other by a timeless in- stability (means more than one thing). The truth is that there is no such stage. A sentence is never apprehended independently of the context in which it is perceived, and therefore we never know a sentence except in the stabilized form a context has already conferred. But since a sentence can appear in more than one context, its stabilized form will not always be the same. It follows then that while no sentence is ambiguous in the sense that it has (as a constitutive property) more than one meaning, every sentence is ambiguous in the (undistinguishing) sense that the single meaning it will always have can change. Now, it is sometimes the case that we are asked to imagine first one and then another context in which a sentence will have different single meanings. In that case, we are in a third context in which the single meaning the sentence has is that it has more than one single meaning. The insight which makes perfect sense of these apparent paradoxes is firmly articulated by Garrett: "We must, I believe, always assume that any sentence is interpreted with respect to some context."9 Garrett then immediately demonstrates how easy it is to slip away from that insight by declaring that if "a sentence is ambiguous, it is the context which determines what reading will be as- signed." In the interval of a typographical space, the contextless utter- ance has been revied since, presumably, no context at all has de- termined that the sentence is ambiguous in the first place. But by Gar- rett's own axiom, there is no "first place" in the sense of a state in which the natural (acontextual) properties of a sentence can be observed and enumerated. In order for the sentence to be perceived as ambiguous (or to be perceived at all), it must already be in a context, and that context, rather than any natural property, will be responsible for the ambiguity the sentence will then (in a limited sense) have. 6 A sentence is never not in a context. We are never not in a situation. A statute is never not read in the light of some purpose. A set of interpretive assumptions is always in force. A sentence that seems to need no interpretation is already the product of one. These statements have made my single point from a variety of perspectives, and I am about to make it again with another statement. No sentence is ever apprehended independently of some or other illocutionary force. I1- locutionary force is the key term in speech-act theory. It refers to the way 9. Ibid., p. 51.</page><page sequence="14">638 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases an utterance is taken-as an order, a warning, a promise, a proposal, a request, etc.-and the theory's strongest assertion is that no utterance is ever taken purely, that is, without already having been understood as the performance of some illocutionary act. Consider, as an example, the sentence "I will go." Depending on the context in which it is uttered, "I will go" can be understood as a promise, a threat, a warning, a report, a prediction, etc., but it will always be understood as one of these, and it will never be an unsituated kernel of pure semantic value. In other words, "I will go" does not have a basic or primary meaning which is then put to various illocutionary uses; rather, "I will go" is known only in its illocutionary lives, and in each of them its meaning will be different. Moreover, if the meaning of a sentence is a function of its illocutionary force (the way it is taken), and if illocutionary force varies with circum- stances, then illocutionary force is not a property of sentences, but of situations. That is, while a sentence will always have an illocutionary force (because otherwise it would not have a meaning), the illocutionary force it has will not always be the same. My authority for much of the preceding paragraph is John Searle, and therefore it is surprising to find that Searle, along with other speech-act theorists, is committed to a distinction between direct and indirect speech acts. A direct speech act is defined as one whose il- locutionary force is a function of its meaning, and the best example of a direct speech act would be an explicit performative, that is, "I promise to pay you five dollars." An indirect speech act is one whose illocutionary force is something other than its literal meaning would suggest. "Can you reach the salt?" is literally a question about the hearer's abilities, but in normal circumstances it is heard as a request. The distinction then is between utterances that mean exactly what they say and utterances that mean something different or additional. As Searle puts it, "in indirect speech acts the speaker communicates to the hearer more than he actu- ally says by way of relying on their mutually shared background in- formation . .. together with the general powers of rationality and in- ference on the part of the hearer."'0 This assumes, of course, that in the performance of direct speech acts speaker and hearer do not rely on their mutually shared background information because what is actually said is available directly (hence the distinction). It is with this assumption that I would like to quarrel, if only because it reinstates what John Austin in How to Do Things with Words was at such pains to dislodge, a class of utterances (constative utterances) that mean independently of situations, purposes, and goals. It seems to me that all utterances are understood by way of relying on "shared background information" and that therefore 10. John R.

Peter Cole and Jerry Morgan (New York, 1975), pp. 60-61.</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 639 the distinction between direct and indirect speech acts, as it is usually formulated, will not hold. What I have to show then is that the acts cited as direct are, in fact, indirect, at least according to the theory's definition of the terms. My argument will take up Searle's as it appears in his first full example. Searle begins by imagining a conversation between two students. Student X says, "Let's go to the movies tonight," and student Y replies, "I have to study for an exam." The first sentence, Searle declares, "constitutes a proposal in virtue of its meaning," but the second sentence, which is understood as a rejection of the proposal, is not so understood in virtue of its meaning because "in virtue of its meaning it is simply a statement about Y."11 It is here, in the assertion that either of these sentences is ever taken in the way it is "in virtue of its meaning," that this account must finally be attacked. For if this were the case, then we would have to say that there is something about the meaning of a sentence that makes it more available for some illocutionary uses than for others, and this is precisely what Searle proceeds to say about "I have to study for an exam": Statements of this form do not, in general, constitute rejections of proposals, even in cases in which they are made in response to a proposal. Thus, if Y had said I have to eat popcorn tonight or I have to tie my shoes in a normal context, neither of these utterances would have been a rejection of the proposal.12 At this point my question would be "Normal for whom?" Or, to put it another way: is it possible to imagine a set of circumstances in which "I have to eat popcorn tonight" would immediately and without any chain of inference be heard as a rejection of X's proposal? It is not only possi- ble; it is easy. Let us suppose that student Y is passionately fond of popcorn and that it is not available in any of the local movie theaters. If student X knows these facts (if he and student Y mutually share back- ground information), then he will hear "I have to eat popcorn tonight" as a rejection of his proposal. Or, let us suppose that student Y is by profession a popcorn taster; that is, he works in a popcorn manufactur- ing plant and is responsible for quality control. Again if student X knows this, he will hear "I have to eat popcorn tonight" as a rejection of his proposal because it will mean "Sorry, I have to work." Or, let us suppose that student Y owns seventy-five pairs of shoes and that he has been ordered by a dormitory housemother to retrieve them from vari- ous comers, arrange them neatly in one place, and tie them together in 11.

In such a situation "I have to tie my shoes" will constitute a rejection of student X's proposal and will be so heard. Moreover it is not just "I have to eat popcorn" and "I have to tie my shoes" that could be heard as a rejection of the proposal; given the appropriate circumstances any sentence ("The Russians are coming," "My pen is blue," "Why do you behave like that?") could be so heard. This does not mean that any sentence is potentially a proposal (that would be the mistake of ascribing properties to sentences) or that it doesn't matter what sentence a speaker utters, but that for any sentence circumstances could be imagined in which it would be under- stood as a proposal, and as nothing but a proposal. The objection to these examples (which could easily be multiplied) is obvious: they have reference to special contexts, while Searle is talking about what sentences mean in a normal context. But for those who are in the contexts I describe, the meanings I specify would be the normal ones because they would be the only ones. Searle's argument will hold only if the category "normal" is transcendental, if what fills it is always the same, whatever the circumstances. But what is normal (like what is ordinary, literal, everyday) is afunction of circumstances in that it depends on the expectations and assumptions that happen to be in force. Any other sense of normal would require that the circumstances not be circumstan- tial but essential (always in force), and that would be a contradiction in terms. In other words, "normal" is context specific and to speak of a normal context is to be either redundant (because whatever in a given context goes without saying is the normal) or incoherent (because it would refer to a context whose claim was not to be one). In short, I am making the same argument for "normal context" that I have made for "literal meaning," "straightforward discourse," "the letter of the law," and the category of what is "in the text." There will always be a normal context, but it will not always be the same one. This means that if it becomes possible to see how "I have to eat popcorn" could be heard as a rejection of a proposal, it is not because we have imagined a set of special circumstances, but because we have imagined an appropriate set of normal circumstances. The point can just as well be made from the opposite direction. Having to study for an exam is no more normal (in the sense that it is a state of which everyone has an implicit knowledge) than having to eat popcorn is special (in the sense that it is a departure from what everyone normally does). To be in either situation is to have already organized the world in terms of certain categories and possibilities for action (both verbal and physical), and in either situation the world so organized, along with the activities that can transpire within it, will be perceived as normal. Once again the moral is clear, even though it has the form of a paradox: a normal context is just the special context you happen to be in, although it will not be rec-</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 641 ognized as special because so long as you are in it whatever it permits you to see will seem obvious and inescapable. From this perspective, Searle's argument falls apart. This first example, as he presents it, is intended to distinguish between: 1. "I have to study for an exam" when it is "simply a statement about Y"; that is, when it means what it says and is therefore a direct speech act; 2. "I have to study for an exam" when it is a rejection of Y's proposal; that is, when by virtue of shared background information it means more than it says and is an indirect speech act; and 3. "I have to eat popcorn tonight" which cannot be a rejection of the proposal "without some special stage setting." If what I have been saying is true, these distinctions cannot be main- tained (at least as they are here formulated) because given different sets of special or differently normal circumstances, the three speech acts are equally direct or indirect. They are direct because in each case the il- locutionary force they have will be immediately perceived; and they are indirect because their immediately perceived illocutionary force will have been a function of mutually shared background information (that is, of some or other special stage setting). The trick is to see that when Searle moves from "I have to study for an exam" as a statement about Y to "I have to study for an exam" as a rejection of a proposal, he has not moved from a literal meaning to a meaning that emerges in a set of circumstances, but from one meaning that emerges in a set of circum- stances to another meaning that emerges in another set of circum- stances. Both meanings are then equally circumstantial (indirect) and equally literal (direct), and in both cases the utterance means exactly what it says because what it says is a function of shared background information. The argument will also hold for "Let's go to the movies tonight," although, for reasons that will become clear, it is harder to make. Here what has to be shown is the reverse of what had to be shown in the case of "I have to eat popcorn." Rather than having to imagine a situation in which an utterance ("I have to eat popcorn") could possibly count as the performance of a certain speech act, we have to imagine a situation in which an utterance ("Let's go to the movies tonight") could count as something other than the performance of a certain speech act. The problem is that the examples that first come to mind make Searle's point rather than mine. That is, they are examples in which the perceived illocutionary force is perceived only because a "more normal" illocu- tionary force is seen to be inappropriate. Thus if speaker X and Y are trapped in some wilderness, and one says to the other, "Let's go to the movies tonight," it will be heard not as a proposal, but as a joke; or if</page><page sequence="18">642 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases student X is confined to his bed or otherwise immobilized, and student Y says, "Let's go to the movies tonight," it will be heard not as a proposal, but as a dare. But in either case the dare or joke will be heard only because the circumstances rule out the possibility of a proposal, a possibility whose absence (and therefore whose presence) must be recognized for the effect to be secured. What we need are examples in which "Let's go to the movies tonight" is heard immediately as a dare or a joke (or as anything but a proposal) and which do not involve the two stage inferential proce- dure specified by Searle. And what we need too is an explanation of why such examples are relatively difficult to come by; that is, why it is so much harder to think oneself out of a necessary association between "Let's go to the movies tonight" and a proposal than it is to think oneself into a necessary association between "I have to eat popcorn" and the proposal's rejection. First of all, Searle's analysis depends on the assumption of a gener- alized relationship between the use of "let's" and the performing of a proposal: "in general, literal utterances of this form will constitute a proposal, as in ... 'Let's eat pizza tonight.' "13 But in this very same paragraph Searle provides an example of an exception to his own gener- alization when he says, "Let us begin by considering a typical case .... " In the context of his discourse, it is not really open to a reader (or, in the case of a lecture, to a hearer) to suggest another beginning or to coun- terpropose that he not begin at all. Moveover, a hearer who responded in either of these ways would be thought to have misunderstood the illocutionary force of "Let us," which is here not so much a proposal as it is the laying down of a plan. Similarly, when a quarterback leads his team out of the huddle by saying "Let's do it" or "Let's go," he is not propos- ing, but exhorting. It would be inappropriate for one of his linemen to answer "I have to study for an exam" or even to answer at all, just as it would be inappropriate if a member of a congregation were to demur when the minister said (here he would be announcing, not proposing) "Let us pray." In each of these cases, "let's" does not introduce a proposal because in the situation as it is imagined the speaker is understood to be conclud- ing or forestalling an exchange rather than initiating one. Notice that in Searle's example the understanding is exactly the reverse: "Let's go to the movies tonight" is assumed to be the first utterance in an exchange that has no antecedents, and that is why it is heard as a proposal. Placed differently, at the end rather than at the beginning of a conversation, the same utterance would be heard as an assent to a proposal that had already been made. (It would be equivalent to "OK, let's go to the movies tonight.") The point is that neither placement is intrinsically the more natural or normal one, and that the stage has to be set no less for "Let's 13. Ibid., pp. 61-62.</page><page sequence="19">Critical Inquiry Summer 1978 643 go to the movies tonight" to be heard as a proposal than for "I have to eat popcorn" to be heard as its rejection. Why then does Searle spend so little time setting that stage in rela- tion to the time that I must spend to dismantle it? The answer is that it is already set for him by the habitual (not inevitable) practices of an entire society and that he need do nothing more than assume those practices in order to secure the benefit of their continuing operation. When some- one is asked to assign an illocutionary force to an utterance, he does so in the context of the circumstances in which that utterance has been most often heard or spoken. For most of us those circumstances are the ones presupposed by Searle, and therefore it appears that the relationship between "Let's go to the movies tonight" and its stipulated force is natu- ral when, in fact, it is a function of a context so widely shared that it doesn't seem to be one at all. It is just such contexts that produce the felt continuity of life by allowing us to rely on and assume as normative the meanings they make available; and it is because Searle invokes such a context (by failing to realize or point out that it is one) that so much effort is required to see around his example. In a sense, then, the circumstances that lead us to assign the force of a proposal to "Let's go to the movies tonight" are normal in that they occur more frequently than do circumstances that would lead to a dif- ferent assignment. But they remain circumstances still (statistically, not inherently, normal), and because they do, the main assertion of this section is intact: there is no distinction between direct and indirect speech acts because all speech acts are understood by way of relying on mutually shared background information. All speech acts are direct be- cause their meanings are directly apprehended, and all speech acts are indirect because their directly apprehended meanings are functions of the situations in which they are embedded. It is important to realize what my argument does not mean. It does not mean that a sentence can mean anything at all. In their discussion of indirect speech acts Herbert and Eve Clark point out that "under the right circumstances" any one of a number of sentences could be "used as a request to open the window; yet," they warn, "not just any sentence can serve this purpose," for "if so, communication would be chaotic" because "listeners would never know what speech act was being performed."'14 But the chaos the Clarks fear would be possible only if a sentence could mean anything at all in the abstract. A sentence, however, is never in the abstract; it is always in a situation, and the situation will already have determined the purpose for which it can be used. So it is not that any sentence can be used as a request to open the window, but that given any sentence, there are circumstances under which it would be heard as a 14. Herbert H. Clark and Eve V. Clark, Psychology and Language (New York, 1977), pp. 121-22.</page><page sequence="20">644 Stanley E. Fish Normal Circumstances and Other Special Cases request to open the window. A sentence neither means anything at all nor does it always mean the same thing; it always has the meaning that has been conferred on it by the situation in which it is uttered. Listeners always know what speech act is being performed, not because there are limits to the illocutionary uses to which sentences can be put, but because in any set of circumstances the illocutionary force a sentence may have will already have been determined. The Clarks can stand for all those who think that it is necessary to anchor language in some set of independent and formal constraints, whether those constraints are given the name of literal meaning, or straightforward discourse, or direct speech acts, or the letter of the law, or normal circumstances, or the everyday world. The question that is always being asked is "Are there such constraints and, if so, how can we identify them?" Behind that question, however, is the assumption that the constraints must be specifiable once and for all, and that if they are not so specifiable at some level, we live in a world of chaos where com- munication is entirely a matter of chance. What I have been saying again and again is that there are such constraints; they do not, however, inhere in language but in situations, and because they inhere in situations, the constraints we are always under are not always the same ones. Thus we can see how it is neither the case that meanings are objectively fixed nor that the meanings one construes are arbitrary. To many these have seemed the only alternatives, and that is why the claims for objectivity and subjectivity have been continually debated. It is because the position elaborated here is neither subjective nor objective (nor a combining of the two) that it can reconcile the two facts cited again and again by the respective combatants: (1) that there are no inherent constraints on the meanings a sentence may have, and (2) that, nevertheless, agreement is not only possible, but commonplace. 7 It may interest you to know that, after hitting two home runs in a single game, Pat Kelly went on to hit three more in the same week, thus equaling his entire total for 1976.
