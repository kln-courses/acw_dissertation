<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sensuous Seas: Tales of a Marine Biologist. By Eugene H. Kaplan. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2006. 271 pp. Cloth $24.95. "How am I to turn the thoughts of these hormone-laden young men and women to the subject matter at hand? What can I say that will interest them, I wonder, as I drone on interminably about clams and worms?" (1). To answer these questions, Eugene H. Kaplan tells stories of the aquatic environment and its organisms in a way few other ma- rine biologists could have. Thirty-one chapters include both scientific accounts and beautiful drawings of each creature described. Sensuous Seas is a scientific and artistic book, but what makes it unique is the author's use of personal narratives, which are replete with descriptions of the surprising behaviors of marine animals.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 275 In chapter 3, "Bedtime Stories/' for example, Kaplan introduces a bloodsucking catfish called "candiru," formerly believed to be a parasite of humans, "entering the human body through the urethral open- ing to penetrate into the urinary bladder" (21). Chapter 8, "The Only Male Reproductive Organ with a Name," describes varieties of squid in reference to "Squid Sex." Such stimulating chapters might invite a feminist critique of marine biology! I don't mean to degrade Kaplan's approach by mentioning his often sexualized descriptions. Sensuous Seas is a serious and honest book on marine biology, and we can see how purposefully Kaplan attempts to draw his readers' attention to what he believes are beautiful and intellectually stimulating marine organisms. In "Apologia" Kaplan even apologizes for frequently using anthropomorphism and teleology "in the name of storytelling" (xi). It is unusual for a scientist to have written such a sensuous book, but Kaplan is motivated by a sense of urgency. He wants his readers to pay more attention to the marine environment and its endangerment. As a book of marine biology, Sensuous Seas is much more readable than a field guide; it should be helpful in field education courses, too, as it shows how Kaplan runs his own classes. My preference is to read it as a book of nature writing, a contribution to a thriving genre of Ameri- can literature. If nature writing may be placed on a spectrum ranging from the literary on the one hand to the scientific on the other, Kaplan leans toward science- but he makes his science writing readable and engaging. Kaplan's narrative style might become a catalyst not only to draw our attention to the marine environment, but also to inspire new, productive interactions between science and literature.
