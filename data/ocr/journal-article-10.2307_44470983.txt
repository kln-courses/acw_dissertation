Rex Shee, and John D. Horsch General Motors Research Labs. Biomedical Science Dept. Warren, Ml ABSTRACT Injury and disability associated with head (brain) , neck (spinal cord) and facial injury account for 61.7% of the total societal Harm in the most recent estimate of motor-vehi- cle related crash injuries. This paper discus- ses the need for accurate information on trans- lational and rotational acceleration of the head as the first step in critiquing the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) and other injury predic- tive methods, and developing a fuller under- standing of brain and spinal cord injury mech- anisms. A measurement system has been developed using linear accelerometers to accurately de- termine the 3D translational and rotational acceleration of the Hybrid III dummy head. Our concept has been to use the conventional tri- axial accelerometer in the dummy's head to assess translational acceleration, and three rows of in-line linear accelerometers and a least squares analysis to compute statistical best-fits for the rotational acceleration about three orthogonal axes. This process provides a standard error or confidence interval of the computed rotational accelerations as a function of time. With accurate rigid body acceleration computed, the inertial response of the head can be subtracted from the neck reaction force to obtain the applied force on the head or face, or determine the lack of head contact. This paper describes a design for an in-line accel- erometer package, the hardware, instrumentation and computer software to determine head dynam- ics, the validation of the measurement analysis packages, and a demonstration of the character- istics of head dynamics. The demonstration includes rotational and translational acceler- ation responses and head impact forces obtained in a variety of Hyge sled and mini-sled tests. The resulting head dynamic responses demon- strate high levels and various combinations of rotational (typical values of 4,00^-6,000 rad/s with peaks over 20,000 rad/s ) and translational (typical values of 100-150 G with peaks of 250 G, and HIC values of 200-2500) acceleration during direct impact and indirect loading of the head. OVERVIEW HISTORICALLY, THERE HAS BEEN an ongoing contro- versy over the role played by translational and rotational head acceleration as the cause of traumatic brain injury. While there have been firmly entrenched camps espousing each mode of head acceleration as a principal cause of in- jury, there has been insufficient experimental information obtained from real-world impacts using highly accurate measurements of each component of acceleration. Lacking such con- crete information, as well as the acceleration effects on brain deformation, arguments from both camps have been unconvincing to the other side. Recently, there has been an emerging consensus in the safety community that both rotational and translational acceleration need to be accounted for in an^advanced head injury assessment procedure (1,2) . This has provided a more appropriate focus since both acceler- ation types are occurring in varying combina- tions during head impact. Equally important has been the under- standing that brain injury is actually occur- ring secondary to skull motion initiated by head acceleration. The brain has inertia and has a relatively loose fluid and vascular coup- ling to the skull. Thus, dynamic motion of the skull can occur relative to the brain which may lag in its motion and be deformed by this re- sponse. Relative motion of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain with respect to the cusped ridges on the floor of the skull and relative motion of the brain adjacent to the more rigid membranes and structures are impor- tant causes of vascular damage, brain contu- sion, and neural trauma.

However, any effort to link brain injury by whatever specific and underlying mechanism to the accel- eration response of the head has been generally lacking, because of incomplete information on head dynamics and the deformation of the brain it causes. The problem is complicated in human injury because head acceleration includes varying degrees of rigid body motion and defor- mation of the skull and brain. The task of accurately characterizing head dynamics is much simpler in the Hybrid III dummy since the dummy's skull can be considered a rigid body and thus, rigid body mechanics applies to the full range of test conditions anticipated for injury assessment with the dummy. The goal of this research has been to de- velop a measurement system using linear accel- erometers to accurately determine the 3D trans- lational and rotational acceleration of the Hybrid III dummy head. Our concept has been to use the conventional triaxial accelerometer package located near the center of gravity of the dummy's head for assessment of transla- tional acceleration, and three rows of in-line linear accelerometers and a least squares anal- ysis to compute statistical best-fits for the rotational acceleration about three orthogonal axes. This process provides a standard error or confidence interval of the computed rota- tional accelerations as a function of time. With accurate rigid body acceleration computed, the inertial response of the head can be sub- tracted from the neck reaction force between the head and neck to obtain the applied force on the head or face, or determine the lack of head contact. This paper describes a design for an in- line accelerometer package, the hardware, in- strumentation and computer software to deter- mine head dynamics, the validation of the mea- surement analysis packages, and a demonstration of the characteristics of head dynamics. The demonstration includes rotational and transla- tional acceleration responses and head impact forces obtained in a variety of Hyge sled and mini-sled test conditions. SIGNIFICANCE OF HEAD AND NECK INJURIES - Head and neck injuries are a significant soci- etal problem and represent a major fraction of the cost of motor-vehicle related crash in- juries. Estimates of the total societal burden of motor-vehicle related crashes indicate a total U.S.A. cost of approximately $60 billion annually (3) . Considering that head (face) and neck injuries account for 44.6% - 61.7% of the crash injury Harm (Table 1), the cost of these injuries to the U.S.A. is in the range of $26.8 - $37.0 billion annually. The lowest estimates of societal Harm (4,5) are based on a uniform cost for each severity of injury, irrespective of the cost differences for injuries of similar AIS severity (that is, an AIS 5 brain injury has significantly greater medical and rehabilitation costs than an AIS 5 liver injury) . In the more recent estimates of motor-vehicle related crash injury Harm (6,7), the significance of individual injuries is accounted for as are the long-term effects of survivable injuries with impairment and disa- bility. These estimates have increased the relative significance of head (face) and neck injuries to well over half of the total socie- tal burden of motor-vehicle related traumas. The increasing importance of head (face) and neck injuries in societal Harm is due to the impairments and disabilities associated with cognitive and functional damage of the brain, quadriplegia and paraplegia resulting from traumatic spinal cord injury, and the disfig- uring consequences of facial damage. The previous analyses of the significance of passenger car occupant injury Harm are based primarily on field accident data involving unrestrained occupants. The increasing use of seat belts by the motoring public in the U.S.A. will reduce the occurrence and change the dis- tribution of injuries occurring in motor-vehi- cle related crashes. A recent analysis using a Multiple Injury Priority Rating (MIPR) proce- dure has compared the relative importance of head (face) and neck injuries for lap-shoulder belted and unrestrained occupants (7) . The analysis indicates that there may be an in- crease in the importance of injuries to these body regions for lap-shoulder belt restrained occupants. In fact, the 61.0% distribution of injuries to the head (face) and neck for the unrestrained occupants increased to 86.9% for the lap-shoulder belted occupants injured in motor- vehicle related crashes (Table 2) ; how- ever, the sample of lap-shoulder belted occu- pants with injury is very small in the combined 1980-83 NASS data. Data obtained from European field accidents (8) , which include a greater number of lap- shoulder belted occupants, provide additional information on the injury frequency to the head (face) and neck for the belted and unrestrained driver and right front passenger in car crashes (unfortunately, the European studies do not use a societal Harm concept in their data presen- tation) . There is a clear reduction in the overall frequency of injuries for the lap- shoulder belted occupants over the unrestrained occupants for both front seating positions (Table 3). With seat belt use, the frequency of head and face injury drops by 47% (44.6% - 23.5%) and 48% respectively, while the nearly doubling of neck injuries is due solely to an increased frequency of AIS 1 neck pain. When the more serious neck injuries are compared between the lap-shoulder belted and unre- strained occupants, there is a similar reduc- tion in neck injury to that for the head ąnd face. However, this and other European aifd U.S.A. studies (1-3, 7-9) indicate that the assessment of head and neck injury risk is important for both unrestrained and lap-shoul- der belted occupants.

A majority of the traumatic brain injury admis- sions involve confusion, amnesia, and short duration unconsciousness symptoms, and the patients are generally admitted for overnight observation as a precautionary treatment before release. In the more severe cases, prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation are re- quired. In contrast, virtually all of the traumatic spinal cord injury patients admitted to hospital have severe injuries and do not experience good recovery. Thus, while the incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury is only 3.6% that of traumatic brain injury, the incidence of permanent disability from spinal cord injury is 13.4% that with brain trauma. If only the defined impairments at the time of hospital release are compared, the incidence of permanent disability from spinal cord injury is 31.9% that with traumatic brain injury. Injury disability to the nearly 31,000 permanently impaired by central nervous system trauma is an important emerging problem of motor vehicle related crash injuries. With improved medical treatment, there is a better survival of the severely brain and spinal cord injured than would have been expected years ago. As the costs for post-traumatic care are rising and the number of permanently disabled increasing the prevalence of this problem, more attention is focusing on the disabling conse- quences of impact injury. Since many of the disabled are permanently confined to wheel chairs or limited in activity, injury impair- ment and disability is quickly becoming a major health-care issue (11). The majority of injury disability associated with traumatic brain and spinal cord injury requires attendant care because of permanent damage to motor, sensory and cognitive functions. Only one in ten of these victims will return to gainful employment and nearly 40% will be unemployed for years after the injury. These individuals face an average life expectancy of 36 years after in- jury, with nearly a quarter living 50 years or more (1,10,11). Recent motor-vehicle related crash injury data (12) indicates that more than three quar- ters of the head and neck injuries are classi- fied as minor and moderate trauma (Table 5) . These injuries include short duration concus- sion with confusion, dizziness and amnesia, and neck pain after the crash. The more severe injuries of the head and neck involve contusion and laceration of central nervous tissues, skull fracture and vertebral fracture/disloca- tion with significant risk of morbidity and fatality. Obviously, our search to understand the various types and severities of traumas to the head (face) and neck requires an accurate understanding of occupant kinematics and injury dynamics associated with impact. Much of this improved understanding can be obtained from Table 4 OUTCOME OF SEVERE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD INJURIES INCLUDING- PROJECTIONS OF ANNUAL INCIDENCE OF PERMANENT DISABILITY TRAUMATIC HEAD AND NECK INJURY MOTOR-VEHICLE BRAIN SPINAL CORD TOTAL RELATED CRASHES Incidence 204,000 7,250 211,250 Outcome Good Recovery 142,5589 151 142,709 Permanent Disability 27,312 3,654 30,966 Death 34,130 3,445 37,575 ^ Projections obtained from Ref (10). 2 Includes 11,472 patients released from hospital with diagnosed Cen- tral Nervous System impairment and an additional 15,840 or 10% of the patients classified as good recovery who may exhibit psychologi- cal and cognitive deficits requiring special testing to document but may affect employment or life-style. 5.802</page><page sequence="6">861891 testing with anthropomorphic dummies , if a more complete measurement of head and neck dynamics is employed in crash simulations. ACCELEROMETRY TECHNIQUES - The description of the kinematics of rigid body motion in bio- mechanical research through the use of multiple translational accelerometers (termed acceler- ometry) was first demonstrated for two-dimen- sional motion by Mertz (13) and later extended to three dimensions by Kane et al (14) , Pad- gaonkar et al (15) , and Alem (16) . They demon- strated that translational accelerometers ju- diciously positioned in a moving frame of reference could, in theory, yield angular accelerations, angular velocities and transla- tional accelerations, with respect to the moving frame of reference. Mertz (13) used four accelerometers to obtain these quantities in two dimensional head motion due to indirect impact. Kane et al (14) used twelve acceler- ometers mounted on a tennis racket to examine the forces exerted in tennis play. Hayes et al (17) have applied this 12 accelerometer method to the analysis of leg motion during gait. Padgaonkar et al (15) showed that although a minimum of six accelerometers are necessary to theoretically describe three-dimensional motion the resulting equations for the three angular acceleration components require prior knowledge of the angular velocities about the three axes. Numerical solution of the equa- tions requires a high degree of accuracy in the measurement of the translational accelerations and in the placement of the accelerometers. Errors in the acceleration measurements lead to the accumulation of error in the values of angular velocities obtained by numerical inte- gration. These error build-ups in turn affect the accuracies of the angular accelerations, leading rapidly to an unstable situation. The authors suggested a solution to this problem by adding redundant accelerometers resulting in a nine accelerometer array in what is known as a 3-2-2-2 configuration. The array consists of a triaxial accelerometer group at the origin of three mutually perpendicular arms on each of which there is a biaxial pair of accelerometers some distance away from the origin. This arrangement allows the elimina- tion of the angular velocity terms from the equations for the angular accelerations, leaving instead just the differences between the various pairs of accelerometer signals and their separations along the axes as the direct determinators of the angular acceleration com- ponents at each point in time. Thus, the angu- lar acceleration components could be determined directly at each time step without reliance on values of the acceleration and velocity com- puted at the previous time step.

This redun- dant method was an elegant extension of the two-dimensional redundant method of Mertz (13) to the much more complex problem of three- dimensional motion. The method was validated for oscillatory general motion but not for direct impact. Alem (16) adapted another redundant ap- proach to rigid body motion measurement orig- inally developed for automobile chassis motion measurement during crashes (18) . This method can use any number of individual translational acceleration measurements greater than six. Alem chose nine to give redundancy in each of the three reference frame directions and pro- posed a configuration referred to as the 3-3-3 array. The configuration has been employed as three triaxial sets of translational acceler- ometers each locäted at a different point on the head (19) or mounted at three corners of a triangular flat plate (20) . Rather than select six independent equations for the six kinematic unknowns as is done in the 3-2-2-2 method, the redundancy of the nine equations for the mea- sured accelerations is used to develop a nine element small error vector involving the six unknowns. A computational procedure is used to search for the values of the six unknowns which minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors. The resulting expression is then differentiated with respect to each of the six kinematic un- knowns to produce a set of six differential equations. Solving these equations yields three angular accelerations, three angular velocities and three translational acceler- ations which are considered to be the "best" estimates, in the least squares sense, of the true solution. Johnson and Hu (21) have conducted an error analysis of the 3-2-2-2 accelerometer scheme and have shown that there are four significant sources of error associated with the measure- ment of angular acceleration using that method. They are transverse (cross-axis) sensitivity, mismatch of accelerometer pairs, misalignment of accelerometers and signal noise. The last three sources of error increase as the dimen- sions of the configuration decrease. Trans- verse sensitivity is related to the production of a signal by accelerations in directions other than that of the intended sensitive axis of the transducer. This transverse sensitivity can be as great as 5 % in some accelerometers used in impact studies. All of the methods employ the differences between the transla- tional accelerations at two points in the moving reference frame to determine angular motions. Thus any error between the two sig- nals or any vibrations of the mounting system can lead to the erroneous computation of an angular acceleration due to these sources of apparent differences in the accelerations of the two points. Numerical analysis of the accelerometer data is an additional source of potential error. The general system of equations which are the basis of accelerometry analysis are coupled, non-linear differential equations. The fact that the equations are non-linear prevents any strong assertion regarding conver- gence or stability of solutions. Liu (22) has demonstrated analytically the unstable nature of these equations. The 3-2-2-2 method does eliminate the coupling and non-linear portions of the problem but the structural arrangement of the accelerometers can lead to vibrationally induced errors during direct impact situations. Additionally, for any of the methods it is required that the initial conditions for the angular velocities be known for the problem to be well-posed. METHODOLOGY IN-LINE ACCELEROMETRY - The general ap- proach of the method presented in this paper is directed toward solving some of the drawbacks and shortcomings of the previously described methods for the problem of direct impact to the head of an anthropomorphic test dummy, specifi- cally the Hybrid III dummy (23) . The method uses a rugged mounting block to eliminate con- cern over vibrations between accelerometer locations. The basic principle of the method is to determine the translational motion of a point on the block with three uniaxial trans- lational accelerometers and in addition provide measures of the differences in translational acceleration at multiple points along the three moving (head) reference frame axes to allow statistical methods to be used to determine the acceleration gradients along the axes. The following sections describe the theoretical basis for the method, called the in-line accel- erometer package, and its application. The absolute acceleration ap, of a point P in a rigid body (Figure 1) is given by the vector equation: *p = + k x £p + Ü x (Ņ x £p) (1) where a^ is the translational acceleration of a point A in the rigid body U is the absolute angular velocity vector of the body u is the absolute angular acceleration vector of the body is the position vector of P relative to r A The xyz components of the vector in the inertial reference frame XYZ are given in terms of the xyz components of the above quantities as follows: 5.804</page><page sequence="8">z Y / Figure 1 Coordinate system for a moving X rigid body. = aAx + VyyP + VzZP (2a) - ("y + Wz)xP + "yzP - VP ^y = aAy + VyxP + WyVP (2t) - (w2 ♦ w2)yp + VP - Vp "P z = aAz + VzXP + VzyP (2C) - ("x + Wy)zP + VP - SyXP The general approach used in this study to provide head acceleration measurements for solving the above equations involves the deter- mination of the translational accelerations of one point in the rigid body (head) along with an additional three rows of aligned uniaxial acceleration measurements. The alignment is such that each row of in-line accelerometers is perpendicular to a body frame plane. The sen- sitive axis of one of the rows is aligned in parallel to the x-body axis and the other two axes are aligned in parallel to the y-body axis. However, the in-line axis of one row is in the z-axis direction and the other in the x- axis direction. The resulting array is shown in Figure 2. As presently configured there are five uniaxial accelerometers in each row. The translational acceleration of one point in each body axis direction is measured by the standard set of Hybrid III accelerometers. Consider the row of accelerometers which are mounted along the z-axis with axial sensitivity in the x- direction. The resulting equation for the absolute acceleration at each point in the row is: 861891 a- = a. ł ü w y. + w w z. 1 (3a) lx a.

The remaining two rows of accelerometers shown in Figure 2 are mounted such that the sensing axes of the accelerometers are all in the lateral, or y direction, with one row along the x-axis and one row along the z-axis.

Burkhard (24) has developed a method* at^ the Seneral Motors Research Laboratories for decoupling these equations thereby allowing numerical techniques to be applied to the solution of the differential equations. Note that the negative sign in Eq. (5a) is the result of choosing to place a lateral acceleration sensing configuration for the row of accelerometers along the z-axis. This result is used as the basis for the decoupling method as follows: Make the following definitions: G(t) = P3(t) ♦ P2(t) (6a) H(t) = P3(t) - P2(t) &lt;6b) F(t) = Pj(t) (6c) u = w + u y z v = u -u (6e) y z The equations for F^(t), Fg(t) and Fg(L) then take the form: u + uù/x = G(t) v - vù/x = H(t) (^k) u2/4 - y2 /4 - ¿x = F (t) (7c) The quantities u and v can be established in terms of the remaining dependent variable as follows: ...-&amp;■«* "'Wdr dr..7W)«.&lt;M] M v - e '°%&lt;T)dT [/J "x&lt;T)dT dT » .y(0)-,z(0)] (8b) By defining the following quantities, the decoupling of Eqs.

The coupling that was present in the original Eq. (5 a-c) can be seen through the non-linear terms involving G(t) and H(t). The path dependency or non-commutativity of rotations is evident through the integrals which are present in the differential equation, that is, the value of $(t) depends upon the total time history of $. The initial conditions for angular velocities about the y and z axes are required for the solution of the angular displacement about the x body axis, and these initial conditions enter the equation in a nonlinear manner. It is clear from Eq. (10) that no singularities have been introduced into the differential equation. Thus, for finite time durations, the angular displacements and the angular velocities are finite. To solve Eqs. (8a, 8b and 10) initial conditions for u, v and d$(t)/dt are required. Since the functions G(t) and H(t) are measured from the data acquisition system at equal time steps, a numerical scheme is developed by deriving a recursive formula for the displacement function $(t) at each time step. Using the subscript k for the discrete instant of time t = kAt, the func- tional values can be written as follows, = $(kAt) k = 0, 1, , n where n is the number of the discrete data points. In order to solve the integro-dif f erential Eq.

(2 a-c) if there is at least one accelerometer for each of the principal directions. DETERMINATION OF HEAD CONTACT FORCES - The measurement of the three-dimensional rigid body motion of head allows a complete description of the kinematics of the dummy head. This information in com- bination with measurements of the three-dimensional forces and moments acting at the head/neck junc- tion permits the calculation of impact forces applied to the head through the use of Newton's Second Law. Specifically, the sum of the forces, including the neck reaction forces, acting on the head is equal to the product of the head mass and the translational acceleration of the head center of gravity. In vector form this relationship can be written as follows: Zl = m¿cg (18) where F = force vectors acting on the head m = mass of the head a = translational acceleration vector of the center of gravity of the head 5.808</page><page sequence="12">861891 Since it is possible to measure the three neck reaction forces and to calculate the three translational accelerations of the center of gravity of the head in the Hybrid III dummy, the applied impacting force vector may be found by subtracting the neck reaction forces from the inertial forces in the following form: EP = ma - N (19) v ' - -eg - v ' where P = applied resultant force vector N = neck reaction force vector The magnitude and the direction of the resultant of the impact load to the head or the single resultant of a number of simultaneous impact forces can be obtained. The location of the line of action of the resultant force can be determined from consideration of the equa- tions of rotational motion and the measured neck reaction moments using the following rela- tions. The rotational motion equation is: EM = H = MN + £N X N + £p X P (20) where M = applied moment vectors H = rate of change of the angular momentum of the head M^ = neck reaction moment vector = radius vector of the neck reaction forces £p = radius vector of the resultant applied force Evaluation of H in terms of its components along the body axes located at the center of gravity of the head yields the following expressions, known as Euler* s equations of motion. EM = I w + (I v - I )w w (21a) X xx X v zz yy y z EM = I w + (I - I zzJ )w w (21b) y yy y xx zzJ z x EM = I w + (I - I )w w (21c) z zz z yy xx x y where; 1,1, and I are the principal moments of inertiK^ about tSe three head coordinates axes x , y , and z . The three-dimensional kinematic data from the in-line accelerometer package combined with the Hybrid III head inertial properties allows the determination of the quantities in Eqs. (21 a-c) . The measurements of the neck reaction forces are made at a specific location relative to the head center of gravity, thereby deter- mining £ ^ the neck reaction force radius vector. Since the magnitude and direction of the resultant applied force P are known from Eq. (19) , the only remaining unknown in Eq. (20) is the radius vector of the resultant applied force £p. Thus, the line of action of the resultant applied force can be determined from the combination of Eqs. (21 a-c) and the components of Eq. (20) . INSTRUMENTATION AND DATA PROCESSING - The in-line accelerometer package was designed to include the standard Hybrid III triaxial accel- erometer locations as part of its structure. The system is shown in Figure 3 installed in a Hybrid III head and neck system along with a six-axis neck load cell (Denton Model No. 1716) . The three accelerometers used in the standard triaxial array are Endevco 7231-750 piezoresistive models and the accelerometers used in the in-line rows are Endevco 7264 pi- ezoresistive models with either a 200 G or a 2000 G range as appropriate. The mounting block is aluminum and weighs 226 grams. The head, with the mounting block and accelerome- ters installed, was adjusted in mass, moment of inertia and center of gravity location to meet the inertial and geometric requirements for the Hybrid III head (25) by modifying the head ballast weights.

The signal from each channel is digitized at a rate of 10,000 samples/sec and then reviewed on a "quick-look" basis to assess the uniformity of the signals associated with each group of five in-line accelerometers . If an individual chan- nel of the group of five appears to have ill- conditioned data, such as excessive noise or waveform spikes not present in the rest of the group, that channel can be eliminated from the subsequent least squares analysis to obtain the acceleration gradients associated with that in- line set of signals. The individual channels are then filtered (typically at SAE Channel Class 1000 with a second order Butterworth filter) prior to performing the dynamics compu- tations. At each time step (0.1 msec) the five accelerometer values and their correspon- ding positions from each in-line row are used to calculate values of the functions F^, and Fg. This is accomplished by determining a linear regression between acceleration and position using a least squares best fit slope of the regression line. Statistical parameters such as the standard error of the regression can also be obtained to indicate the accuracy of the regression in terms of a straight line dependence between acceleration and position. After obtaining the functions F^(t), Fg(t), and F«(t) for the entire time course of inter- est tne resulting signals are again filtered with the same filter used on the input signals to produce a comparable signal for further analysis with the translational acceleration data. The filtered F-(t), F2(t) and Fg(t) functions are then used as the input data for solving for the angular accelerations and angu- lar velocities using the decoupling methods described in the previous section (Eqs. 6-17). Once the three-dimensional angular acceler- ations and angular velocities are obtained as functions of time they can be combined with the translational acceleration data from the tri- axial package to calculate the true transla- tional accelerations of the center of gravity of the head, since the seismic mass centers for the conventional triaxial accelerometers are offset as much as 2.8 cm from the true center of gravity of the head. Thus, it is possible to compute the head injury criterion based on the conventional triaxial accelerometer re- sponses (HIC) or the true acceleration at the center of gravity of the head (HIC ) . This set of data, involving the head cente? of gra- vity translational accelerations and angular velocities of the head in three dimensions, provides a complete description of the impact kinematics of the head as a rigid body. The acceleration of any point on the rigid body can then be calculated from the analyzed data. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A series of tests was conducted to study the effectiveness of the in-line accelerometer package under a variety of test conditions. The initial tests involved direct head impacts using a Hybrid III head and neck mounted on a mini-sled. Subsequent tests involved the use of the whole Hybrid III dummy in direct head impacts and indirect whole body restraint sys- ^0 tests DIRECT HEAD IMPACT - The head and neck structures of the Hybrid III dummy were mounted on a mini-sled platform which is guided hori- zontally on rails and is pneumatically acceler- ated up to a desired speed (approximately 8 m/s maximum) and then stopped by a hydraulic shock absorber. The head/neck system is supported rigidly during acceleration and is released during the sled transit to allow an unimpeded reaction during the impact phase of the test. The head/neck/sled base system mass of 30.6 kg approximates the upper torso mass of the aver- age U.S. male. Head impact targets backed by a load cell and mounted against a rigid support structure can be placed to produce a head im- pact prior to deceleration of the sled. A 38 mm thick, 76 mm diameter soft (50 durometer) rubber block was placed as the contact surface on a GSE biaxial load cell. The load cell was mounted at a height that provided for a fore- head contact with the head and the sled veloc- ity at head contact was either 5.7 m/s or 7.4 m/s. The results of a 5.7 m/s impact are shown in Figure 4a and 4b, and Table 6. The figures show the resultant translational acceleration time history (Figure 4a) and the angular accel- eration time history about the y-axis (left- right axis) (Figure 4b) . Also shown in each figure are drawings of selected frames from the high speed movies of the test depicting the attitude of the head at the various peaks in the acceleration histories. Note that at the initiation of the impact (Figure 4a) the atti- tude of the head/neck is slanted slightly for- ward to insure a flat contact of the rubber block surface with the forehead. During the first phase of the contact the angular and translational accelerations rise abruptly with the angular acceleration reaching its peak slightly before the translational peak is reached. This is due to the abrupt stopping and reorientation of the head by its inter- action with the rubber block. Although the reorientation is slight (about 4*) it occurs in a few milliseconds and results in an angular acceleration waveform with a shorter duration than the translational acceleration duration. The angular acceleration then rises again as the head rebounds from the rubber block. This second angular acceleration peak is followed by a second translational acceleration peak which is due to a z-axis component of the centripetal acceleration associated with the angular veloc- ity of the head rebound rotational motion. A third angular acceleration peak occurs later in the test.* Its value is negative and is the result of the neck arresting the rearward rota- tion of the head. The translational accelera- tions are relatively low at that time. This test set-up was also used to evaluate 5.810</page><page sequence="14">861891 &lt;3 - 200 I 200 160 [ - 1 160 - A 0 120 - /l &lt; / ļ ™ 80 Í ' C 40 - J ' [' Ę1 2 !

The load cell data from a 7.4 m/s test are compared in Figure 5 to that cal- culated from the in-line accelerometer package and neck load cell combination as described in the previous section. Good agreement is evi- dent in both waveform and magnitude of the calculated force. A second type of direct head impact was conducted by using the entire Hybrid III dummy equipped with the in-line head accelerometer package and neck load cell. The impact situation simulated an individual falling back- wards from a sitting position on a stool with the back of the head striking a rigid concrete floor covered with vinyl flooring tile. Al- though this type of impact is not typical of an automotive crash impact it is known to produce head injuries in some individuals. The dummy was seated upright with the center of gravity of the head 1.42 m above the floor. The dummy was tipped and rotated rearward abruptly cau- sing the shoulders to strike the floor first with the head then rotating rapidly and the back of the head striking the floor to produce a severe (210 G peak) short duration (3 ms) resultant translational acceleration pulse with a Head Injury Criterion value of HIC = 590 (HIC = 554) . ÎSe sequential loading as the dummy back struck the floor and began to rebound caused the head to rotate rearward2with a peak angular acceleration of 9,500 rad/s and a peak angular velocity of 46 rad/s. When the head struck the floorg a peak angular acceleration of -17,000 rad/s occurred. A peak contact load of 10.7 kN was computed for this impact. Although the HIC value for this impact would not indicate that the impact was a severe blow to the head, the very high angular accelerations produced by the impact sequence rfould indicate that, rota- tionally, the event was severe. This type of fall may produce skull fracture and/or subdural hematomas .

A third type of direct head impact was a sled test using the entire Hybrid III dummy equipped with the in-line head accelerometer package and neck load cell. The unrestrained dummy was seated in a body buck simulating the right front seat passenger space including the instrument panel and windshield. The test ve- locity change was 14.5 m/s. The resulting translational and angular acceleration traces are shown in Figure 6a and 6b respectively . Also shown are selected configurations of the dummy during the impact sequence associated with significant peaks in the translational and angular accelerations. The translational acceleration (Figure 6a) reaches its first peak of 130 G due to head contact with the windshield and subsequent fracture of the glass. Both the x-axis and z- axis head accelerations contribute to this peak. The second peak at 150 G is more broad than the initial contact waveform and is due to the head deforming the plastic interlayer of the windshield. The third major peak at 120 G is the result of the head being stopped by the instrument panel. The HIC for this impact was 1666 (HIC = 1780) . In this case the value of HIC at the® center of gravity of the head is 6.8% higher than the conventional calculation. The angular accelerations about the y-axis (Figure 6b) predominate the angular acceler- ation history of this test except for an appre- ciable x-axis angular acceleration spike (&lt;6,000 rad/s ) during initial head/glass con- tact. Large y-axis angular accelerations (+10,000 and -18,000 rad/s ) were produced during the deformation of the interlayer and subsequent head/instrument panel contact. These two peaks lagged the associated transla- tional acceleration peaks by 5-8 ms. A similar test conducted at a lower velocity of 11.3 m/s produced acceleration waveforms that were simi- lar in shape but the magnitude of the angular accelerations during the head/glass contact and fracture phase produced the highest angular acceleration peaks (+11,000 and -13,000 rad/s ) . The angular accelerations associated with the deformation of the interlayer and the instrument panel contact were much lower (- 6,000 and +5,000 rad/s ) than in the high ve- locity test. The HIC in this test was 482 (the value of HIC was 578, 19.9% higher). The lastC®type of direct head impact was also a sled test using the entire Hybrid III dummy equipped with the in-line head accelerom- eter package and neck load cell. The unre- strained dummy was seated in a body buck simu- lating the right front passenger rotated 30* inboard and in front of the instrument panel and windshield. The test velocity was 14.5 m/s. The 3D translational and rotational acceleration traces are shown in Figure 7. The sequence of dummy kinematics involved an initial right arm/shoulder contact with the instrument panel prior to head contact. There was subsequent rotation of the upper body into frontal contact with the instrument panel during windshield contact.

The three dimensional content of the head dynamics is evident in Figure 7 with each axis of translational and rotational acceleration experiencing high-level responses during the glass fracture and plowing phases of the head impact. The resultant translational acceleration reaches its first peak of 120 G due to head- windshield contact and subsequent glass frac- ture. The x-axis (78 G) , y-axis (80 G) , and z- axis (45 G) head accelerations contribute to this peak. The z-axis head acceleration has an earlier positive response associated with shoulder contact on the instrument panel. The second peak resultant head acceleration of 130 G is more broad in time due to head plowing in the plastic interlayer but also includes a significant 3D response. The forward motion of the head was stopped in the glass plowing phase , but resulted in a deep laceration of the right cheek of the dummy's face. The HIC for this impact was 1157. There were significant levels of head angu- lar acceleration about each of the three axes of rotation. During the initial head/glass contact and glass fracture there is an appreci- able x-axis (-21,000 and 14,000 rad/s) and z- axis (-28,000 rad/s) acceleration spike with a slightly lower y-axis (13,500 rad/s) angular acceleration response. The negative z-axis rotational acceleration indicates a sharp left- ward rotation of the head during glass frac- ture. During the plowing phase, the y-axis angular accelerations (-8,500 and 8,000 rad/s) were the largest of the three components. The angular acceleration responses lagged the asso- ciated translational accelerations as in the previous tests. The full 3D responses demon- strate the variety of acceleration effects experienced by the head in a typical impact sequence with an unrestrained occupant. INDIRECT HEAD LOADING - Two types of impact sled tests were conducted where the initial loading to the body was through a restraint system and thus produced head accelerations by loads transmitted through the neck from the torso to the head. A frontal crash simulation with a three-point lap/shoulder belt restraint system and a rear crash simulation with a fixed-height head restraint seatback were per- formed. The frontal crash test used a 15.6 m/s velocity change. The shoulder belt was inten- tionally given 25 cm of slack to produce an abrupt restraining action of the upper torso. The resulting translational and angular accel- erations for this test are shown in Figures 8a and 8b respectively. The peak translational head accelerations were about 100 G with the first peak associated with a z-axis acceler- ation related to centripetal head acceleration as the head rotated forward. This peak was preceded by~an angular acceleration peak of - 4,000 rad/s . Note that at that point the head/neck of the dummy had rotated only slightly. The second pegk of head angular acceleration (+6,000 rad/s ) occurred as the head's rotation was arrested by chin/chest contact. A translational (x-axis) acceleration peak was also produced at that time. The con- tact force calculation showed clearly that chin/chest contact had taken place. The rear crash simulation test was per- formed at a velocity change of 8.5 m/s. Fig- ures 9a and 9b display the test translational and angular acceleration histories respec- tively. Note that, again as in the three-point belt test, the initial angular acceleration peak occurs prior to significant head rotation and also that both the angular acceleration peaks are of ^ significant magnitude (+4,000 and -5,000 rad/s ) in this low velocity test. The associated translational accelerations are relatively low, however. S 125 M*1 !

VALIDATION OF IN-LINE ACCELEROMETRY - The mini-sled tests with head contact onto a padded load cell provided direct validation of the translational acceleration analysis and iner- tial compensation of the neck reaction forces to obtain the force applied to the head. As evidenced in Figure 5, good agreement was found between computed and measured contact force responses. In contrast, direct validation of the accuracy of the computed rotational accel- erations during a three-dimensional impact is beyond the scope of the present study. The lack of a suitable calibration and validation device that can produce known three-dimensional angular acceleration inputs similar in magni- tude and waveform to those in head impacts continues to be a problem for all the raulti- accelerometer motion measurement techniques. For the case of two-dimensional motion in the x-z plane the in-line accelerometer method allows direct computation of angular acceler- ation since the coupled term in equation (5c) is zero. This calculation would be similar in principle to the other multi-accelerometer methods in planar motion determination. The multi-point determination of translational accelerations in the in-line method would allow a better estimate of the acceleration gradient due to rotational motion than the two point samples of the other methods. Direct compari- son of integrated angular displacements with film analyzed rotations of the head are not possible during head impact because of the small angular displacements (typically less than 5*) occurring during the short-duration contacts, even though the magnitudes of rota- tional acceleration approach 20,000 rad/s. With larger angular displacements of the head, which occur during indirect loading such as the initial head motions in a whiplash test, com- parisons based on computed rotational acceler- ation and integrated angular velocity and dis- placement with film analyzed motion of the head show good agreement (within 5% for angular velocity and 11% for angular displacement) , but the accumulation of integration errors in- creases the confidence interval with longer times (200 ms instead of 50 ms) . An indirect indication of the validity of the approach is inherent in the in-line accel- erometry method to assess the accuracy of the measurements and computational procedures. The process of linear least-square analysis of the acceleration differences in Eqs. (4a-4d) and Eqs. (5a-5c) provides a measure of the goodness of fit of the acceleration values to a straight-line gradient. Thus, the time varying correlation coefficient associated with that fit provides an indirect measure of the valid- ity of the method particularly in planar mo- tion. The y-axis rotational acceleration and corresponding correlation coefficient for the 5.7 m/s mini-sled test is shown in Figure 10. During contact with the rubber pad, the y-axis rotational acceleration rises sharply to a maximum value of 3,700 rad/s and the correla- tion coefficient is R=0.939. The second y-axis rotational acceleration peak is 2,800 rad/s and has a correlation coefficient of R=0.991. The third negative peak y-axis angular acceleration is -3,100 rad/s and has R=0.998. The correlation coefficient for the -17,000 rad/s y-axis angular acceleration in the 1.42 m fall and occiput loading of the dummy's head on the floor was R=0.936 indicating good fidelity in computed rotational acceleration under vio- lent direct loading of the head. The average correlation coefficient for the computed peak rotational accelerations in the demonstrated tests of this paper was R=0.957 * 0.048 with a range of R=0. 850-0. 999. However, the linear least squares computation procedure produces a correlation coefficient that approaches zero as 5.815</page><page sequence="19">the slope of the best-fit line approaches zero. This inherent characteristic of the statistical analysis means that the correlation coefficient drops well below one with zero crossings or low values of computed rotational acceleration, conditions which are of less interest than those of high angular acceleration. The in-line statistical analysis procedure also provides sufficient information to compute a time-varying standard error or confidence in- terval for the computed rotational accelera- tions. However, this calculation has not yet been implemented as a routine part of the in- line accelerometry procedure. The addition of a confidence interval for the computed rota- tional accelerations and resulting integrated angular velocities and displacements would be useful in judging the range of possible values. This would also supplement the information provided by the correlation coefficient. CONCLUSIONS 1. A rugged procedure has been developed to measure 3D dynamics of the Hybrid III dummy head during impact. The method uses the con- ventional triaxial accelerometers near the center of gravity of the dummy head to measure translational acceleration and statistical analysis of three in-line accelerometer arrays to compute rotational acceleration about or- thogonal axes. The redundant in-line acceler- ometers and statistical analyses provide accur- acy and minimize the effects of transducer errors, and also provide a standard error or confidence interval for the computed rotational accelerations as a function of time.

Typical crash exposures involve high rotational and translational accelerations in various combinations during direct impact and indirect loading of the head. The in-line accelerometer technique is proving useful in obtaining a better understanding of the dynam- ics of head impact and identifying the mecha- nisms of brain injury. Table 6 demonstrates head dynamics in a variety of tests using the 3D in-line accelerometer package. 3. The 3D in-line accelerometer method works in conjunction with the 3 force axes of a 6-axis neck load cell (3 force axes and 3 mo- ment axes) to compute contact force. The neck load cell is connected between the Hybrid III dummy head and neck, and head (face) contact force is calculated by subtracting the inertial response of the head from the measured neck load. The translational and rotational accel- erations of the head and contact forces are measured with high accuracy using the 3D in- line accelerometer technique. 4. For the assessment of planar impact responses, the complexity of the 3D in-line accelerometer technique can be reduced to a 2D method which retains the precision obtained from the statistical analysis of rotational acceleration but with the requirement of much fewer channels of accelerometer data. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is the culmination of a three- year multipdisciplinary effort which involved the various expertise of the coauthors and many other people. While the concept for an in-line accelerometer technique was the idea of the principal author, the realization of the idea would not have been possible without the mech- anical design and test experience of Richard Madeira, the electronics and systems input from Joseph McCleary who was also the focus point for virtually all aspects of the procedure for the years of this project, the assistance of Dr. John Melvin the past year in validating and demonstrating the in-line accelerometer package with the collaboration of John Horsch and Dr. T. Rex Shee, and the valuable assistance of Jerry Horn and Ken Baron. Particular recogni- tion should be given to Dr. Peter Burkhard who developed in the early years of the project an innovative scheme for decoupling Eqs. (5a-5c) thereby allowing numerical techniques to be applied for the solution of the differential equations of motion. 5.816</page><page sequence="20">861891 REFERENCES 1.
