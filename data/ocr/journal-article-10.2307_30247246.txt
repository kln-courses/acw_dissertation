STEWART Department of Anthropology Lakehead University Thunder Bay, Ontario Canada P7B 5E1 PAUL MATOUSEK c/o Department of Anthropology Lakehead University Thunder Bay, Ontario Canada P7B 5E1 JANE H. KELLEY Department of Archaeology University of Calgary Calgary, Alberta Canada T2N 1N4 ABSTRACT Studies of rock art and painted ceramics largely have been separate domains of scholarship in the American Southwest, except in cases of rather obvious decorative overlap, such as Jornada Style rock art and Mimbres Black-on-white pottery. This paper calls attention to a small but important degree of parallel between Jornada Style rock art and painted ceramic designs in the Jornada Mogollon region. Researchers in the Southwest are urged to give more attention to similarities across these and other visual media. CROSS-MEDIA DESIGN RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SOUTHWEST The Southwest is well known for the richness of its graphic art in a variety of media, including basketry, textiles, pottery, interior walls of ceremonial rooms, and rock outcrops. One might expect considerable stylistic and formal continuity across such media within any given art style, allowing for formal variations con- ditioned by each medium. Art critics and historians will be well aware of this. In anthropology, such continuity has been recognized at least since Boas's (1955:183-298) cross-media study of native art on the Northwest Coast of North America, although he found there were differing male and female styles that cor- related with their works in different media. Some scholars have observed discon- tinuities between designs in various media in the prehistoric Southwest and have asked why. The operation of culturally defined constraints, for example, has been suggested by Schroeder (1982:6): The strange lack of overlap in artistic form or treatment in several media of prehistoric times is of interest. Kiva mural-like art on pottery, possibly aside from that of the Mimbres and a rare symbolic element in late prehistoric times, and a treatment such as that seen on rock art are completely lacking on Southwestern ceramics, suggesting that some type of formalized attitudes dictated the type, place, and use of decorative art to be employed. 301</page><page sequence="2">302 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY sexql E o0!xOW MON 00 I - cr.. cI I I I I'l , m .... ............. man.... -- R'" o" / ".' 0 ~ I0 euozVF mommo .." e ,OWN l .. .. y . . . . . . . .. ." . o I I. ..zo I .

To some extent, the apparent "lack" of design cross- overs may be due to a certain research bias. That is, students of ceramic design generally do not seem to give much attention to rock art and vice versa. This paper advocates a cross-media approach, with specific reference to certain designs that recur in rock art and on painted ceramics in the Jornada Mogollon region (Lehmer 1948). We are not the first to have pointed out ties between rock art and ceramics in the Southwest. For example, Fewkes (1919) noted similarities between prehistoric Hopi feather designs on Sikyatki pottery and in petroglyphs. He also discussed the presence of the Hopi mythical figure, Kwataka (Man-eagle) on Sityatki pottery and in a pictograph near Walpi (Fewkes 1898:691-692). In the Hohokam area, parallels have been noted between designs in rock art and on red-on-buff ceramics of the Santa Cruz phase of the Colonial period (Wellmann 1979:83). Olsen's (1985) semantic study of Hovenweep rock art not only compares it to prehistoric ceramic art but gives detailed attention to its archaeological contexts and ethno- graphic continuities. Another recent example is Schaafsma's (1987) comparative study of designs in rock art, ceramics, and textiles from in and around Wupatki National Monument, Arizona. In addition, two important and interrelated papers were published in this journal (Hays 1989; Cole 1989) just as our paper was in the review process. Hays and Cole demonstrate the presence of katsina symbolism in painted ceramics and rock art, as well as in other media, in the Homol'ovi area be- ginning about A.D. 1300 or shortly before. In general, however, rock art designs and ceramic designs appear to have been treated as more or less separate domains of study in the Southwest, where professional archaeologists usually have devoted more attention to ceramics than to rock art. Much credit for the recording and study of Southwestern rock art (and other art forms) must go to art historians and critics and to avocational archaeologists. Yet, rock art does have considerable anthropological, as well as aesthetic significance, as Schaafsma's (1985) review of North American rock art research shows. The detection of design parallels in different media, if formally distinctive (like temporally diagnostic artifacts) can establish chronological relationships between them. This is particularly helpful for rock art, which is so difficult to date. In addition, such parallels can help to determine cultural ties or interactions between regions. Such is the case for the Jornada and Mimbres regions of the Mogollon archaeological area. Over large portions of these regions is found a genre of rock art termed the "Jornada Rock Art Style" by Schaafsma (1975). Schaafsma (1972:95-122) subdivides the Jornada Style into a Western Phase, characteristic of the Mimbres region, and an Eastern Phase, characteristic of the Jornada region. Figure 1 shows the approximate boundary of the Mogollon with adjacent</page><page sequence="4">304 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY archaeological areas, regional subdivisions within the Mogollon and Schaafsma's proposed extent of the Jornada Rock Art Style. These "boundaries" and "subdivi- sions," especially that between the Mimbres and Jornada manifestations of the Mogollon, are difficult to draw and vary, depending on the particular defining criteria used and the time period under consideration (Lekson 1986). Figure I also shows that recent work by the Capitan-North Archaeological Project extends Schaafsma's Jornada Style periphery at least slightly to the north and east, beyond Carrizozo, New Mexico. Both the Eastern and Western phases of Schaafsma's Jornada Style display a wide variety of designs, including zoomorphs and anthropomorphs, as well as abstract and geometric figures. The Eastern Phase is the more elaborate and is especially notable for its numerous katsina-like masks and other supernatural or ritual figures. A detailed recapitulation of the Jornada Style and its regional varia- tions and chronology is not appropriate here. Schaafsma's (1972:118-121) com- ments on the relationships between east and west are worth quoting, in part, however. Absolute dates for the Jornada Style are suggested on the basis of a comparison of the petro- glyphs with similar designs on datable pottery. As mentioned earlier, most of the rock art figures are paralleled by those on Mimbres Bold Face and Classic Mimbres Black-on-white pottery. Thus it is reasonable to postulate a contemporaneity between the pottery and the petroglyphs [in the Mimbres region] .... A somewhat similar dating for the Eastern Phase in the Jornada division is likely, although datable pottery with comparative designs is perhaps less closely associated with the appearance of the Jornada style in the Jornada divi- sion. Pottery native to the Jornada development did not incorporate representative figures into its decoration, and Mimbres Bold Face did not enter this area until the late Mesilla Phase around A.D. 1050 or 1100 (Lehmer 1948:77-78). In the east, however, the tradition is known to have persisted... around 200 years longer than it did in the area of the Mimbres Valley. The longer continuation of the tradition in the Jornada division may account for its greater complexity here. As little had been published on Jornada ceramic designs at the time of her writing, Schaafsma hardly could have been aware that there are infrequent but im- portant exceptions to her statement that Jornada Mogollon ceramics lack represen- tational designs. Sutherland (1978:50-53), in a report on the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site (LA 4923) in Schaafsma's Eastern division, also comments on the broad artistic tradi- tion linking the Jornada and Mimbres Mogollon regions and points out parallels with Mimbres (but not Jornada) ceramic designs. Just why the artistic tradition and associated symbolism characteristic of Mimbres ceramics and the Jornada Rock Art Style should have persisted in the rock art but not in the ceramics of the Jornada Mogollon region is a mystery, particularly because Mimbres ceramics reached the Jornada region and vice versa. Indeed, it has been shown that some Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta bowls of the Jornada Mogollon region have simple geometric designs very similar to Mimbres designs (Stewart 1983), and it has been asserted that "early" examples of Chupadero Black-on-white, another Jornada</page><page sequence="5">Rock Art and Ceramic Art 305 Mogollon ceramic type, "have designs exceedingly similar to Mimbres Classic Black-on-white" (LeBlanc (1982:117). In any case, ceramic artisans in the Jornada Mogollon region did practice a largely abstract, geometrical, nonrepresentational mode of painted decoration. According to Schaafsma and Schaafsma (1974) and Schaafsma (1980), much of the rock art and kiva mural art of other areas of the Southwest, after A.D. 1300, is derivative of the Jornada Style. Here, however, we are not concerned primarily with these developments or with the Schaafsmas' proposed Mexican derivation of the Jornada Style (for a contrary view, see Crotty 1988). THE PRESENT SAMPLE The rock art sites and habitation sites referenced in this paper are mostly within the Sierra Blanca region of southeastern New Mexico, as defined by Kelley (1984). Because these sites are vulnerable to vandalism, we have not included a map showing exact locations. The Three Rivers Petroglyph Site and Hueco Tanks, which are well known and open to the public, are shown in Figure 1. And because site names (e.g., those named after land owners) may provide clues to site loca- tions, we have used site numbers (the LA series used by the Laboratory of Anthro- pology, Museum of New Mexico). The ceramic designs considered here represent a fairly extensive sampling of published and unpublished material for three of the major painted ceramic types native to the Jornada Mogollon region - Chupadero Black-on-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and Lincoln Black-on-red. Precise dating of these types is yet to be achieved. Based on various discussions (e.g., Wimberly and others 1977:407, Figure 6; LeBlanc 1982:116-117; Stewart 1983:45, 1984; Wiseman 1984; and Stewart and others 1990), we would suggest tentative ranges of about A.D. 1150 to the early or middle 1400s, and perhaps later, for Chupadero Black- on-white, about A.D. 1150 to the early or middle 1300s for Three Rivers Red-on- terracotta, and about the early or middle 1300s to the early or middle 1400s for Lincoln Black-on-red. Considerable flexibility must be entertained for both the early and late ends of these ranges. Our illustrations of Three Rivers Red ware (Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta and Lincoln Black-on-red) are drawn from extensive earlier design studies (Stewart 1979, 1983). The Chupadero Black-on-white illustrations are drawn mostly from a collection of photographs on file with Stewart. Although it is not possible to do so here (with the exception of one vessel), a fourth native type, El Paso Polychrome, as well as the painted ceramics of the Casas Grandes region, also should be examined in relation to Jornada Style rock art, as Curtis Schaafsma has pointed out to us. The rock art illustrations mostly represent four sites in south-central New Mexico from which we happen to have photographs - the well-known Three</page><page sequence="6">306 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY o . . --e, ; - .. .. . . a e . o- i. eea. a .......

La 48270 was partially published by Kelley (1984:237-251) and was further recorded in 1985 by the Capitan-North Project (Kelley 1990) and by the New Mexico Rock Art Field School. LA 51353 and LA 51341 were recorded by the Capitan-North Project in 1985. These sites contain additional examples of some of the illustrated designs and many more examples exist at other Eastern Phase Jornada Style rock art sites. Our coverage of the rock art, though far less extensive than that of the ceramic designs, is enough to document the overlap between the two media and to draw attention to the need for further research. COMPARISON OF JORNADA ROCK ART AND CERAMIC DESIGNS Typical Southwestern Geometrics A number of abstract, geometric designs occur in both the rock art and ceramics studied here. Some, such as simple terraces, opposed steps or keys, and interlocking scrolls are not illustrated here, as they are very common on a virtually pan-Southwestern scale and do not necessarily establish specific Jornada Style links between rock art and ceramic art. Future researchers, however, might find examination of the more subtle regional and temporal variations in such imagery fruitful. Meander Lines Somewhat more unusual are meandering line designs, such as those on the "killed" Chupadero Black-on-white vessels in Figures 2a-b (see, also, Kelley 1984:Plate 64b) and in the rock art examples in Figures 2c-d. For a meander line on the exterior of a steep-walled Chupadero Black-on-white bowl from Gran Quivira in the Salinas region, see Hayes (1981 :Illustration 90). Farther afield, we are aware of at least one occurrence in Anasazi rock art (Polly Schaafsma, per- sonal communication, 1988). Circle-and-Dot Designs A geometric design common in the regional rock art, especially at the Three Rivers Petroglyph site, is a circle-and-dot configuration. This design occurs in variations. The center may be a large or small dot or may be defined by a solid- lined circle. Around the center are various concentric arrangements of solid-lined circles and/or dotted circles. Another variation, in which the central dot is replaced with a cross is illustrated by Schaafsma (1980:Figure 196). Only one Jornada Mogollon ceramic example exhibiting both solid circles and a dotted circle is known to us, that on the Chupadero Black-on-white jug in Figure 2f.</page><page sequence="8">308 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY K:j II c as e C~ K 'I A r.,~,,,. l~t-:~mrr'~e-.''e'n-,r 44- - V C iY 4 j, 3 -.r ee9 Figure 3.

Figures identical to this are present in a pictograph panel at a small rock shelter near Capi- tan (Schaafsma 1980:Figure 6). Concentric circle designs are widespread in the Southwest and may have an earth and sun symbolism (see discussions in Schaafsma 1980:11-12 and references cited therein). Although considered here as variations on a single design, it is possible that examples with and without dotted circles should be categorized separately. Continuous Linear Patterns A regionally characteristic mode of abstract design is found on Three Rivers Red ware bowl interiors (Figures 3a-c; see also Stewart 1979, 1983; Mera and Stallings 1931 :Plate III) and in rock art (Figures 3d-g; see also Sutherland 1978). At first glance, these designs appear rather nondistinctive in terms of Southwest- ern decorative tradition, generally. That is, they display common, simple ele- ments, such as stepped figures, scrolls, etc. It is a peculiar, linear decorative treat- ment rather than the particular decorative elements used that imparts the regional specificity, however. The key feature of this treatment is the use of a continuous, unbroken line to form rather complicated design patterns. These may be embel- lished with filler lines and other elements. We are indebted to Curtis Schaafsma (personal communication, 1987) for calling our attention to this essential feature, which extends to El Paso Polychrome design (e.g., see the bowl illustrated in Hammerson 1972:22) and for pointing out that it is a distinctively Mogollon, as opposed to Anasazi, treatment of decorative space. There are some differences between the rock art and ceramic designs using this linear treatment. In Three Rivers Red ware, the designs often cover bowl in- teriors in radially or rotationally symmetric patterns. Also, the continuous line is often repeated around the design field in congruent fashion, creating a layout structure of multiple parallel lines. In the rock art designs, the congruent multiple line effect and the radial and rotational symmetries are not characteristic. In rock art, but apparently not ceramics, such designs may comprise or embellish life forms. The famous "Tlaloc" painting at Hueco Tanks, for example, has a stylized anthropomorphic head on a torso consisting of a quite abstract design of this sort (Newcomb and Kirkland 1967:Plate 141; Schaafsma 1980:Figure 163). Figure 3f, from the Capitan area, compares closely, except that the head (pointing down- ward) is more abstract than in the Hueco Tanks example. Figure 3g, the well- known bighorn sheep figure at Three Rivers, imparts a similar visual effect, al- though not created by a single, continuous line. For a nice example of a fish treated in this fashion, see Schaafsma (1980:232, Figure 191). Fan-like Figures Figures resembling a fan, broom, or animal paw occur occasionally on both Lincoln Black-on-red (Figure 4a-b) and Chupadero Black-on-white (Figures</page><page sequence="10">310 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY e.e .I ,.

Michael Bilbo (personal communica- tion, 1988) has drawn our attention to an interesting occurrence not illustrated here. His example, a petroglyph in the Rio Bonito Valley near Fort Stanton, shows the "fan" as the tail tip of a clawed quadrupedal mammal. In both ceramic and rock art, the fan appears either with or without a line ex- tending from the apex of its triangular outline. Stewart (1983:51) previously suggested that this figure might be a stylized awanyu, or horned or plumed ser- pent, although we would not argue strongly for that interpretation. Newcomb (1956:Figure 47) identifies a Navajo example as a rain cloud, although this is usu- ally represented by the terraced figure to be discussed presently. The closest paral- lel to the Lincoln Black-on-red treatment of the fan-like figure of which we are aware occurs in a Classic Mimbres Black-on-white design illustrated by Brody (1977:Figure 122) in which an anthropomorphic character twirls a similar figure, evidently a bull-roarer. Horned or Plumed Serpents and Other Zoomorphs Definite homed or plumed serpents are represented on Mimbres ceramics and, in western Texas, in Jornada Style rock art in the Hueco Mountains (Figure 4h, after Schaafsma 1980:Figure 176) and the Fort Hancock area (see Schaafsma 1980:Figure 187). In the Mimbres country, the figures are sometimes anthropo- morphized, resembling, Schaafsma (1980:203) suggests, the Mexican deity, Quetzalcoatl (see Schaafsma 1980:Figure 155). Others (e.g., Tyler 1964:244) seek to minimize any connection between the Southwestern and Mexican deities, however. The only horned serpent known to us on ceramics native to the eastern (i.e., non-Mimbres) part of the Jornada Rock Art Style area is found on a miniature Chupadero Black-on-white jug (Figure 4g; after Wiseman 1985). Rare examples, such as this, are extremely important in documenting the ties between Jornada Mogollon rock art and ceramics. Ordinary snakes, not evidently representing the horned or plumed serpent, also occur in Jornada rock art. We are not aware of such snake figures on Jornada ceramics. Fish appear occasionally in Jornada Style rock art (Figure 4j) and abundantly on Mimbres ceramics (Jett and Moyle 1986) but apparently not on Jornada ceramics. One possible occurrence is shown on a Lincoln Black-on-red sherd (Figure 4i) but the design is too fragmentary to be certain. Though questionable, this piece is worth mentioning as it was excavated at a habitation site associated with a rock art site that does have fish petroglyphs. A few additional examples of miscellaneous life forms are known on Chupa- dero Black-on-white (Hayes 1981:Illustration 96; Kelley 1984:Plate 2b), for which parallels might be found in rock art.</page><page sequence="12">312 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY e"'"'k : ,.. c . e.., .; . a .e;.,,.,,- .. :e .e S... .. .e.,. ae :, ., . . a , . . ,'.- ;...'...e .;,..,: .. ... . ..e.? , " i ,,... .

Our view that rain and fertil- ity is expressed in these designs is primarily a visually based interpretation arising from the repeated combination of certain forms and embellishments. Often only two or three of these elements will occur in a single design. The largest set of these associated elements known to us is found in a petroglyph panel at Three Rivers, to be discussed shortly. A bilaterally symmetrical stepped figure, which we refer to as a "cloud ter- race," is usually central to this symbolism. Such terraced figures, as decorative motifs, if not necessarily associated with rain symbolism, are first known on tex- tiles of the Basketmaker era (Kent 1983:220). The numerous occurrences of this design in the rock art at the Hueco Tanks Site are discussed by Newcomb and Kirkland (1967:198). They note, citing Dutton (1963:58, 77), that this is a wide- spread Puebloan symbolism that eventually was adopted also by Navajos. Navajo examples published by Schaafsma (1980:Figures 253 and 266) are strongly repre- sentational, leaving no doubt that the depicted plant associated with the bird and the terraced figure is a mature, fruiting corn plant. In the Mogollon area, a remarkable petroglyph at the Three Rivers Site (Fig- ures 5h and 6) is composed of an interesting complex of elements. A corn plant grows beneath a terrace whose base is embellished with vertical tics suggesting rain, and within the terrace appear to be represented a rainbow and a zig-zag light- ning flash. From steps of the terrace, lines (prayer or planting sticks?) protrude up- ward. A bird perches atop the terrace. Schaafsma's (1980:Figure 189A) illustra- tion of this petroglyph shows all of these elements, and the plant, though depicted with less detail than the Navajo examples mentioned above, is clearly corn with ears. What Schaafsma's illustration does not show is the goggle-eyed face im- mediately above the bird, as shown here (Figures 5h and 6). To us, the association of this goggle-eyed figure with the portrayal of rain falling on growing corn sup- ports the idea that such goggle-eyed figures in Jornada rock art represent a rain deity somehow related to the Mexican Tlaloc (Schaafsma and Schaafsma 1974; Schaafsma 1980). The cloud terrace appears frequently in Jornada Style rock art, often associated with one or more of the symbols just mentioned and sometimes with other anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, as seen in Figure 5 (for other examples, see Schaafsma 1972:Figure 96a; and Wellman 1979:Figure 368). The association of a bird or winged anthropomorph with a terrace is also seen in Zuni altars for the summer solstice katsina ceremony (Cole 1989:Figure 5b). Terraced figures are known on Lincoln Black-on-red bowls (see Stewart 1979, 1983 for illustrations) but they lack the embellishments (i.e., zig-zag light- ning lines, arching rainbows, and subtended rain tics) that would signify them definitively as clouds. That symbolism or imagery, however, clearly is present</page><page sequence="14">314 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY Figure 8. The late Mark Wimberly examining a petroglyph at the Three Rivers Petroglyph site in 1979 (cf Figure 5h).</page><page sequence="15">Rock Art and Ceramic Art 315 occasionally in Chupadero Black-on-white designs (Figures 5a-c). Figure 5a shows the front of a Chupadero effigy vessel having the cloud terrace with sub- tended rain lines and a curved element (stylized bird?) on top. Another terraced figure appears on the back of this vessel, and its sides are decorated with geomet- ric designs. We are uncertain as to what animal the effigy represents. Figures 5b-c show two additional Chupadero Black-on-white miniature vessels with rain sym- bolism. The paint on the vessel in Figure 5b is worn and faint to the point that some detail is uncertain but rain symbolism clearly is present. The fact that rain symbolism on Chupadero Black-on-white pottery occurs on special vessel forms (effigies and miniatures) suggests that this symbolism may have been reserved for pottery made for ritual use. We hasten to add, however, that not all Chupadero Black-on-white effigy and miniature vessels display rain symbolism. We are aware of several examples that have quite ordinary geometric designs. Although El Paso Polychrome designs are not covered in this paper, we do include an illustration (Figure 5d) of one small, undoubtedly ceremonial, bowl having four modeled cloud terraces on its rim, each painted black and having a rainbow painted in reddish orange. DISCUSSION Designs on ceramics native to the Jornada Mogollon region and designs in rock art of the Jornada Style show many differences in style and content. Never- theless, this paper demonstrates that there is more overlap than is generally recog- nized. In ceramics, the most impressive parallels are seen on those relatively rare vessels having representational and symbolic designs but future research should involve careful comparisons of abstract designs in ceramics and rock art. In such comparative work, the possibility should be kept in mind that some abstract designs could be stylized or conventionalized equivalents of designs ren- dered in representational form elsewhere (e.g., Hays 1989:301-302). Our discus- sion of the broom-like figure is a possible case in point. The process of stylization is well known (if not so well understood) in art, generally. An interesting South- western example from the early work of Fewkes (1919:232-236) is the conven- tionalization of bird designs on prehistoric Sikyatki pottery from the Hopi area. A similar study is that by Barnett (1968), who analyzed bird designs on Rio Grande Glaze pottery from Tonque Ruin. Barnett demonstrates a continuity from fully representational bird figures to completely stylized tails. The latter (see Barnett 1968:Figure 11) include stepped figures or keys that, by themselves, would appear as simply decorative elements. Some of these, incidentally, are identical to ele- ments often seen on Chupadero Black-on-white and Lincoln Black-on-red, as well as other Southwestern types. The rock art and ceramic design parallels we have presented here are consis- tent with the chronological and cultural associations of rock art within the Jornada</page><page sequence="16">316 STEWART, MATOUSEK, AND KELLEY Mogollon region that have been recognized by other researchers (e.g., Newcomb and Kirkland 1967; Schaafsma 1972, 1980; Bilbo 1984; Bilbo et al. 1979). These parallels also support the relationships seen by Schaafsma (1975, 1980) and others between Jornada Mogollon and Mimbres Mogollon symbolism. Although we have been specifically concerned with rock and ceramic art in this paper, we believe that studies of other media, when done from a cross-media perspective, will be fruitful. A recent example in this vein is Brook's (1985) analysis of designs on beads and other small artifacts from caches in the Jornada Mogollon region and his comparison of them with petroglyph designs. We hope our own exploratory study helps to stimulate additional interest in this general line of research. Specifically, we would like to see comparative studies of rock art in relation to designs on Mimbres Black-on-white, El Paso Polychrome, and the decorated Casas Grandes ceramics. In this connection, rock art in northern Mexico should be recorded as intensively as it has been on the American side. In addition, attention should be given to the further development of method and theory, drawing for inspiration on existing examples such as Olsen's (1985) con- textual, semiotic, and cross-media approach to Hovenweep rock art. Schaafsma (1985) also provides much food for thought on method and theory in the study of rock art. Acknowledgments. We thank Polly Schaafsma, Curtis Schaafsma, Michael Bilbo, and Kelly Ann Hays for reading and commenting thoughtfully on earlier drafts of this paper, and two anonymous reviewers and the Kiva's editor for criticisms of the submitted version. Of course, only we are respon- sible for any shortcomings in the present version. We thank the School of Forestry, Lakehead Univer- sity, for use of a device that facilitated the tracing of designs from projected photographic slides. A grant from Lakehead University supported a trip by Stewart to New Mexico several years ago, during which some of the pottery was photographed. Other photographs were taken during the Capitan-North Archaeological Project, funded by a grant to Kelley from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. All the petroglyph illustrations are from either the Capitan-North Project or per- sonal photograph, whereas the pictograph in Figure 4h is reproduced from Schaafsma (1980:Figure 176) with permission from the School of American Research. The Laboratory of Anthropology, Museum of New Mexico, gave permission to publish illustrations of pottery pieces in the Collections of the Laboratory of Anthropology and the School of American Research Collections in the Museum of New Mexico, as well as to use illustrations of pieces previously published in Mera and Stallings (1931) and Wiseman (1985). We thank John Robinson, Clark Pfingsten, Jack and Chris Jack Harkey, Jack and Jenny Spall, and Lester Sharp for photographic access to pottery in their possessions. Mickey Thomas, Monument Ranger at Lincoln State Monument, facilitated the photographing of several ves- sels formerly on display there. Figures 2a, 4c, and 4d are based on photographs of the Sierra Blanca Restudy Project, funded by a grant to Kelley from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.
