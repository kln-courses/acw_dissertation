This short book by the Professor of Statistical and Mathematical Science at the London School of Economics is an excellent antidote to Monod's Chance and Necessity. Not only does it succeed in showing that chance (in the sense of absolute randomness) is com patible with design, but also that chance plays an intelligible, even necessary, role in God's plan of creation. Einstein was convinced that God does not play dice with the world. But Einstein's deter ministic world is by no means to be preferred to a Christian theistic view embracing the rich potential, spontaneity, creativity, and freedom that the presence of chance elements in creation allows. The first part of Bartholomew's book is the more professional. It is here that we find the refutation of Monod. It is also of very great interest, in view of recent advocacy of the use of probability theory in argument for the existence of God by R. G. Swinburne and its deprecation by D. H. Mellor, to read an expert statistician's evaluation of these debates. Bartholomew's treatment of Mellor's 'bridge-hand' argument invites much pondering. This part of the book is also highly pertinent to discussion of the 'anthropic prin ciple', whereby the narrow range of initial conditions permitting the emergence of life in cosmic evolution is found hard to ascribe to chance. Bartholomew is curiously sceptical about this argument. The second part of the book reveals in Bartholomew an amateur theologian of considerable skill and judgement. A plausible attempt is made to read the biblical narrative in a non-deterministic way and a useful study of the notion of divine providence in a world including chance is given. The criticism, particularly of Pollard, but also of Geach and Peacocke, is acute. I was sorry that the treat ment of 'double agency' on p. 141 was so brief and that the name of Farrer only appeared in a footnote. The preference for 'top-down' over 'bottom-up' accounts of divine action in and through the created world yields some highly suggestive but tantalizingly brief speculation. The last chapter, on more detailed theological topics such as incarnation, evil, prayer, and eschatology, continues to display the clarity of thought and the determination to face difficulties head on, that characterize the book as a whole. All these issues would have benefited from a fuller treatment of the preferred concept of providence mentioned above and perhaps a greater sensitivity to the dangers of anthropomorphism in talk of the relation between God and the world. All the same, this is the best book of amateur theology that I have read for a long time. Brian Hebblethwaite Brian Hebblethwaite</page></plain_text>
