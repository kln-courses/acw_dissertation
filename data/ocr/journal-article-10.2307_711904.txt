Other points are less certainly wrong, but he needs far more space if they are to be justified. His arguments are difficult to follow, but he makes the interesting point that Aristotle was aware of problems about teleological explanation that were unknown to his predecessors. On the other hand Allan Gotthelf's discussion of spontaneous generation includes a painstaking study of the relevant texts. His conclusion is that Aristotle did not let his belief in spontaneous generation affect his general views on teleology. Fred Miller combines politics with biology in a sensitive study of the senses in which a state is by nature.

H U B Y MINOAN RELIGION WALTER POTSCHER: Aspekte und Probleme der minoischen Religion: ein Versuch. (Religionswissenschaftliche Texte und Studien, 4.) Pp. viii+282; 48 figs. Hildesheim, Zurich and New York: Georg Olms, 1990. DM 98. W. Potscher's book is a refreshing albeit daring endeavour to understand some aspects of Minoan religion through the analysis of imagery. P.'s approach differs from that of other scholars such as B. Rutkowski (Cult Places in the Aegean) and G. Gessell (Palace, House and Town Cult ... ) in that this author is not an archaeologist but a Classicist who has specialized in Greek religion. He therefore is less concerned with presenting and describing the archaeological evidence than with investigating ritual. P.'s knowledge of Greek religion enables him to draw attention to several Greek rituals which may have had similarities with Minoan ones. Welcome as the comparative approach is, the temptation to project Greek religion and myth backwards onto the Minoans is a real danger. Some Greek myths such as that of Zeus, who impregnates Io by a mere touch, are a real inspiration for the author, who sees sacred marriage in many images of the Minoans. His main theme is hieros gamos. He detects its symbolic manifestation in most cult implements of Minoan religion. His first step is to classify cult implements and symbols into male and female. If symbols representing the two genders occur together, hieros gamos is implied. There are many female symbols: boughs, trees, columns, birds and snakes. They are identified as such because they are associated with the goddess and appear with her. There are symbols of a male god as well according to P.: the double axe and the sacred horns. How does the author arrive at these conclusions? Let us take the example of the double axe. P.'s reasoning is that the axe was the attribute of a male god in Anatolia. In addition, the Anatolian word labrys was used by the Minoans because ' labyrinth' is attested on Linear B tablets as da-pu-ri-to-jo. According to P. this means that contacts were close and that we might transfer the meaning of labrys into Minoan Crete as a symbol of the male god. As for another male symbol, the Minoan sacred horns, P. argues that they are schematized horns of the bull, a male god. ? Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">86 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW There are problems with these interpretations. As regards the axe, the icono- graphical language suggests the opposite of what P. argues: the double axe is associated only with a goddess or her priestesses (there exists only one example of a male holding a dubious double axe on a postpalatial sarcophagus from Armenoi). When axes bear decoration, the motifs come from the realm of plants and insects. I am referring to lilies and butterflies on axes from Zakros. B. Dietrich has argued on the basis of these facts that the double axe is a regenerative symbol. It can bring death but out of death springs new life; the deadly weapon becomes a source of life. At any rate, it is a fact that the double axe is not the attribute of an aggressive warrior god. It is also difficult to prove that the horns are attributes of a male god. Are they really horns? And had they been, were bulls really worshipped? F. Matz has convincingly argued for the contrary. Note that the Egyptians used a similar pictogram to designate the two mountains that defined the horizon. Had we not known from inscriptions what this symbol meant in Egypt, we could have seen horns there also. The so-called sacred horns are stylized and abstracted beyond recognition so that we can only speculate about their original form. Speculation is legitimate but it is certainly too risky to base an entire hypothesis on a simple impression. It is preferable to confine our conclusions to how the 'horns' were used in cult: the Minoans poured libations over horns or placed boughs and double axes between them. In addition to the objections outlined above, namely that we cannot be sure what the original meaning of cult objects such as the so-called horns was, the author has constructed a highly abstract system. Do religions work that way? Is everything a symbol for some supernatural entity? A simpler explanation is to look for the meaning of objects within the framework of cult practices. The bough, for example, was placed between the sacred horns in order to adorn them during the period of a festival. Branches are signs of renewal in many religions, including the Greek, and can be associated with both male and female deities. The bough does not have a gender; it simply signifies regeneration. To take another example, the sanctity of the tree. The author argues that it is a manifestation of the goddess. And yet, its sanctity might derive from it being a sacred locus, a place where the deity might be expected to appear. In fact the tree is consistently associated with epiphanies of deities in Minoan Crete as well as Classical Greece where Apollo or Artemis, for example, will appear next to a palm. (See also N. Marinatos, 'The Tree as a Focal Point of Ritual Action in Minoan Glyptic Art', in: Fragen und Probleme der bronzezeitlichen agaischen Glyptik (CMS Beiheft 3) (Berlin, 1989), pp. 127-43). The final objection that may be raised against P. is the arbitrariness of some of his interpretations. Contextual analysis and examination of all relevant representations is essential when dealing with pictures of a culture of which so little is known. One example will suffice. In interpreting the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, P. assumes a series of consecutive rituals executed at different times of day. This he deduces from the background colours. He simply asserts that yellow implies early morning; white is daylight; blue is night and red signifies the liminal zone where gods appear. Although the hypothesis is ingenious, it is utterly unsupported by parallels in Aegean art. P. would have to show that such background colours are an accepted convention to indicate time before he proceeded to explain the meaning of the rituals. When the foundation block of his hypothesis is so flimsy, the whole construct collapses. Despite these criticisms, I found much in P.'s book which is sound and gives food</page><page sequence="3">87 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW for thought. He is certainly correct in stressing that zoomorphic manifestations of deities are not a primitive trait preceding anthropomorphism but that the two may coexist. He also correctly emphasizes that Crete must have had a polytheistic religion. His stress on regeneration, fertility and death is valid, and I agree that the scenes on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus must have had a significance which is broader than mere funerary rites. Had his insights been constrained by a more disciplined approach to iconographical analysis, this would have been a very exciting book indeed!

Pp. 247. Paris: Julliard, 1990. Paper, frs. 100. This volume brings together, unaltered but for the addition of a short introduction by the author, the 'resumes de cours' which Jean-Pierre Vernant published year by year in the Annuaire du College de France during his tenure of the chair of 'comparative study of ancient religions' from 1975 to 1984. On assuming the chair, he had stated his intention of investigating in his lectures 'les problemes de la mise en image du divin', the diverse forms of plastic evocation of the divine (or the deceased) among which ' realistic' anthropomorphic representation was only one late-emerging if ultimately dominant type. And his courses did indeed all take at least their starting point from aspects of that theme. After an introduction, which vindicates the autonomy of the visual image against those who see it as a form of text, a long first section treats ' la figuration du mort'; it takes up the theme of an earlier article, on kolossoi and 'the psychological category of the double', and sets the development from the archaic, non-figurative grave- marker to the funerary kouros in a much broader context: the changing forms of memorisation' in the developing city, the similarities and contrasts of poetic and plastic commemoration, the appropriation by the city of the heroic ideal of' la belle mort', the relation of the grave-marker to other forms of symbolic substitution or doubling of the person. The kouros, it is finally stressed, does not yet 'portray' the dead youth; rather it still, in the archaic way, 'stands for' him, although it goes beyond the sema in evoking his beauty through its own. This is a rich and complex enquiry, bursting out in all directions; the reader is left to make his or her own synthesis. This reader found the invitation to distinguish different modes of ' representation' very enlightening (V. develops this theme in an essay in his Religions, histoires, raisons, 1979, and in another fine one added to the new edition of Mythe et pensee chez les Grecs, 1985), but was unhappy about some of the principles used to explain the changes between them. A large part of V.'s argument is based on the view that we have knowledge, from Homer, of a ' pre-polis' heroic society, the institutions of which we can watch being gradually replaced in the archaic period. But, if it is useful to speak at all of' the rise of the polis', we should doubtless associate it, as most now do, with that 'eighth-century renaissance', of which of course the poetry of Homer is the most spectacular expression. Two consequences follow: Homer can offer us no simple access to a world before the polis, since he is himself arguably the first polis-citizen who we can put a name to; and we certainly cannot use the rise of ?
