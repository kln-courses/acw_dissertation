With his Au-dela de Vimage ^'Beyond the Image"), Olivier Boulnois has written, in his own words, "a genealogy of the Western worlds visual unconscious" (p. 17) from Augustine to Luther and the Council of Trent. For his description of the episteme of visuality from the fifth to the sixteenth century, the question of the knowledge of God suggests itself as Ariadne's thread, a question that radiates into domains of enquiry as varied as epistemology, ethics and pedagogy. If theology is pivotal in Boulnois' book, his general enquiry consists in unearthing the changes that occurred in the conceptu alisation of the relation between a thing and its representation. Boulnois maintains that the primary issue is neither perspective nor the problem of veneration. Fundamentally, the Western world specified its relation to the visual in terms of a philosophy of knowledge and access to the truth. Augustine, the first to have given a full account of'the image', is therefore the main thinker studied in chap ter one, entitled "Le noeud augustinien." With the crucial ideas of "man as the image and resemblance of God" (Genesis, 1:26) and of "Jesus Christ as the perfect image of the Father" in the background, Augustine distinguished between different aspects of the notion of image. First, he offered a general theoretical account that permitted to think of Christ as the image of the Father as a particular case of what Boulnois calls the "relation d'image." Second, he tackled the 'sociological' problem of idolatry. And third, he accounted for the nature of knowledge. Leaning towards Neo-Platonism, he claimed that not all knowledge was framed by means of images, and notably that the knowledge of God was imageless. This theological and philosophical account of the image provided the framework within which later theologian-philosophers would think about this issue. John Cassian thought that God was imageless. Likewise, he deemed anthropomor phic images formed of Christ as illicit. As Boulnois explains in chapter two, "Image et ecriture," Cassian underlined the primacy of writing and of the word over the image. The term formula passed from designating a visual model to meaning a little sentence giving an orientation to prayer. Visual images were becoming transformed into a language in which the erudite would recognise signs - a situation that would however be counter-balanced by Pope Gregory the Great's approval of the use of didactic images for the illiterate. In chapter three, "L'art de mediter," the visual is extended as far as the changes in page layout in handwritten books. With respect to thinkers such as Bernard of Clair vaux, Hugh of Saint Victor and Ailred of Rielvaux, Boulnois shows that the shift from reading aloud to silent reading was accompanied by significant layout changes that triggered new types of cognition and an evolution in the concept of knowledge. In the context of reading, the construction of mental images and Schemas for memorisa tion and of representationes for internalising the biblical scenes read about were taken into consideration by medieval thinkers. ?

Again, Platonic and Aristotelian approaches to knowledge conflict. Boulnois shows that a range of thinkers such as Dionysios the Areopagite, Hugh of Saint Victor, John Scotus Eriugena and Hildegard of Bingen, to cite only a few, favoured the symbol. Pace Aristotle, in Christendom the problem of the knowledge of the invisible casts a long shadow on the validity of images, leading to a preference for cognition acquired through symbols and negative theology more generally. Because symbolism has been so successful, Boulnois feels entitled to the claim that "PEcriture et le Symbole ont detrone l'image" (p. 169). But the critique of the image went even further: cognition itself could be understood as representational and thus be viewed as belonging to the domain of image: "les theologiens se perdent dans la fabrication d'images qui sont des idoles conceptuelles" (p. 178). "Le probleme de la veneration" (chapter 5) describes the relation between concep tualisation and the visual from Augustine to John of Damascus, Gratian and the second Council of Nicaea, and to TheodulPs Libri carolini and their reception. In this chapter, the problem of the image is shown to have become more intricate as, besides God, the saints too came to be represented, receiving their own cult in icons that often even encapsulated relics. "La place du roi" introduces the third part of the book, "L'ordre des images." Similarly to Foucault's The Order of Things, where the corresponding chapter deals with anachronism, Boulnois' chapter opens with the late thirteenth-century author Pierre de Jean Olivi and his untimely meditations', as it were, on painting, the neces sity of symbolism and of its completion with a text that is usually coded. The chapter "A Metaphysics of Perspective" opens with the reception of Alhazen's treatise of optics in the thirteenth century and its impact on the concept of image and the vision of God. In 1241, the statement according to which God could not be seen was condemned. God, it was now decreed, could be seen intellectually. The knowledge of God could proceed according to three manners: through images (affirmative theol ogy), through forms (symbolic theology) and through marks (negative theology). In opposition to Thomas Aquinas' support for figures and resemblances, Dietrich of Freiberg and Master Eckhart, discussed in chapter seven, favoured natural rather than artificial images, preferring images that shared the substance with their model (fathers and sons) to images that did not (trees mirroring on water surfaces). The three chapters of the last part of the book, "L'image sans limites," describe the shifts that took place during the late Middle Ages. "La naissance des arts du beau," demonstrates that in the Middle Ages, there existed no connection between 'ars and "pulchrd. 'Ars' was transferred from a status of imitation of nature to a status where it was regarded as the imitation of the divine gesture and hence a creation. "L'image discordante," starts with the difference between the trace and the image, and the problem of participation. Generally, the image is seen as mimetic. If God can be represented, it is henceforth through mimetic means. Boulnois concludes: "la signi fication de l'image chretienne a perdu toute sa specificite" (p. 390). Indeed, personi fications and allegories of God now rest on anthropomorphism, so that religious images are no longer essentially different from ancient allegories of justice, for instance.</page><page sequence="3">292 Book Reviews / Early Science and Medicine 15 (2010) 287-317 In his last chapter "Dissemination et centralisation de l'image," Boulnois describes the progressive autonomisation of the visual arts vis-?-vis religion. Continuing reflec tions developed in previous decades, theologians came to believe that the image should only represent the visible, and that the image therefore had to be natural. Boulnois concludes by reviewing the central options presented in his book with regard to two contentions. One, it has been demonstrated that veneration was only one problem among others. Memory, meditation, visualisation, narration and knowl edge itself were of equal importance in thinking about the image in the Middle Ages. The status of the image as a medium and the problems of reference that it carries were primordial, as was the nature of the thing represented (visible or invisible). Second, Boulnois substantiates the view that the theory of art and of the image was independ ent of aesthetics. Closer to noetics, because the central questions had to do with the mind, and to ethics, because religious painting instigated imitation, the medieval theory of the image also had an anti-esthetical charge as it was not aiming at beauty, but at truth. Boulnois' book aims beyond the image: what is of importance is the object of the image and the relation between it and a thinking subject. Reading Beyond the Image is in no way a fruitless effort. The book offers precious informative material about the history of the visual from Augustine to Luther. The reader will find at all times an accurate description of the interrelations between the visual, the divine and the knowable. Boulnois has maintained the promise made in the subtitle in providing an archaeology of the visual. Alexis Smets Radhoud University Nijmegen</page></plain_text>
