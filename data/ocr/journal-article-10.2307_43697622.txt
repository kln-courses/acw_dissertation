Forschungen zum Alten Textament 2. Reihe 74. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck 2014. ISBN 978-3-16-153724-0. Recent research on (cult) images and symbols tends to point out that it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between iconic and aniconic artifacts. While some authors con- sider only anthropomorphic representations of deities as iconic, others include picto- rial representations of animals and objects. Problems of definition arise with regard to objects traditionally classified as aniconic, such as standing stones (mazzebot): archae- ological evidence suggests that mazzebot can also be painted (cf. Arad), and according to Lev 26:1, mazzebot, too, should fall under the interdiction of images. Moreover, ex- egetes debate whether the interdiction of images might extend even to mental images of God (e.g. A. Wagner). Questioning a rather narrow concept of the image as a two- or three-dimensional pictorial (or even anthropomorphic) representation, the discussion has shifted towards a broader understanding of images and icons. Jill Middlemas' study contributes to this discussion by suggesting to reframe the question of iconism vs. aniconism as a distinction between the single and stabilized vs. the multiple and varying image. Her examination of aniconic rhetoric in Second Isaiah, Ezekiel and Hosea follows a twofold aim: First, she seeks to bring other liter- ature beyond the usual Pentateuchal legal material into the discussion of aniconism in ancient Israel. Furthermore, the abundance of anthropomorphic speech about God in the prophetic literature raises the question of how this figurative language relates to the aniconic ideal advocated in the texts. In this study, rather than tracing the historical development of the texts and their theological ideas, Middlemas seeks to show how the rejection of physical objects as well as of stabilized mental images of God takes place on a rhetorical level. With this book, she pursues a line of research developed in various articles published over the past five years. After an introduction presenting the main ideas, research questions and outline of the book, Middlemas begins with an analysis of the prophetic idol polemics (chapter 2). While most previous studies have focused on the literary history of these texts or of their significance for the development of "monotheism", Middlemas, in keeping with the objective of her study, examines the iconoclastic function of the "Polemic Against the Idols passages" (PAI; Isa 40:18-25; 41:6-7; 44:9-20; 46:1-7; Jer 10:1-16; 51:15-19; Hab 2:18-20). In addition to pointing out polemical strategies such as the ridiculing of their human fabrication, demotion of the raw materials, and contrast with Yahweh the Creator, she stresses that these passages appear in contexts of divine judgement, thus promoting iconoclasm. She identifies further rhetorical strategies to denigrate the idols in prophetic texts beyond the "Polemic Against the Idols passages" (PAI), such as the exclusive use of language of divinity for Yahweh and the use of derogatory language in reference to other deities. Following M. Dick and D. Lipton in arguing that the bibli- cal texts show awareness of Mesopotamian rituals, she reads the polemics as deliberate misrepresentations. She concludes that as the polemical texts undermine the ideologi- cal support for cultic images, they simultaneously bolster programmatic aniconism. Die Welt des Orients, 45.

KG, Göttingen</page><page sequence="2">112 Buchbesprechungen/Book Reviews The third chapter examines aniconic strategies regarding the worship of the god Yahweh. In particular, it deals with the rejection of mental iconography and of objects which support a stabilized mental representation of Yahweh. In the first part of the chapter, Middlemas discusses the polemics against the bull iconography in Hosea and argues that the bull calf statue in the northern kingdom most likely was a Yahwistic cultic object. Polemics similar to those against the idols of the nations discussed in the previous chapter are thus found in Hosea to reject a Yahwistic cultic object. Turning to the cherubim throne and the ark, Middlemas explains their disappearance from the texts as a rejection of "cultic items that promoted the figuration of the deity as a hu- man king in mental imagery" (68). She points out that not only is the cherubim throne no longer mentioned in the description of the rebuilt temple (Ez 40-46), but the term twmd ("likeness") is also absent from the final chapters of Ez. "The final chapters pri- oritize the divine word over the divine image and even downplay the visual elements of the theophany to highlight aurality" (p. 73). Similarly, according to Middlemas, the ark is demoted from a divine footstool to a mere container before disappearing from the literary record. She contrasts the cherubim throne and the ark as cultic objects of the Solomonic temple with the iconography acceptable for the second temple (menorah; cherubim merely as adornments for the walls), the latter indicating divine presence without suggesting the divine image. As the mental representation of the deity in a concrete and anthropomorphic form is not limited to its induction by cultic objects, Middlemas also examines the figurations of Yahweh in Ez 1:26-28; 8:2. She concludes that the particular use of comparative terms (with the effect of a "blurred photograph", p. 86) and the varying descriptions of Yahwehs presence as rainbow (Ez 1:28) and fire (Ez 1:27; 8:2) "destabilize a specific and anthorpomorphic mental image of the deity" (p. 87). This interpretation leads to the next chapter (chapter 4), in which Middlemas in- vestigates the interplay of expressions of incomparability and metaphorical speech as a strategy to destabilize the divine image itself. Following the idea of P. Miscall and others that the use of multiple metaphors for Yahweh might combat a fixed mental image of God, Middlemas examines this phenomenon in the prophetic texts dealing with idolatry. Because of the context of polemics against other gods, she rejects an ap- proximation of the incomparability texts (Isa 40:18, 25; 41:4; 44:6-8; 46:5; Jer 10:6, 7) to similar statements in Mesopotamian texts. She argues that the intended contrast is with "idols as non-effective material objects" (94) rather than with gods. This contrast, in her view, promotes aniconic belief and bolsters monotheism. Concerning metaphors and multiple imaging, Middlemas - although she expresses general doubt about the usefulness of metaphor theory applied to biblical texts - briefly discusses major metaphor theoretical approaches previously used in biblical studies (Lakoff, Black, Kittay) and adopts Soskices concept of "interanimation" (108) and "modeling similes" (similes which function like metaphors, 109). In the following, she studies the instances of comparative ëlÀ used with respect to Yahweh in Second Isa- iah, Ez and Hos. She interprets the images used of Yahweh in Second Isaiah (warrior, birthing woman, and sheperd in particular) in contrast to the idols who are inactive, immobile and impotent. According to Middlemas, the multiple modeling similes in Ez prevent a single stable image of the deity, while the great and sometimes surprising variety of similes in Hos underscores in particular that Yahweh is not human. This result leads her to raise the question of whether statements of humanity cre- ated in the image of God contradict the prophetic effort to avoid a specific, anthro-</page><page sequence="3">Buchbesprechungen/Book Reviews 113 pomorphic figuration of the divine. Middlemas addresses this issue in the last chapter (chapter 5). She examines Gen 1:26-28; 5:1-3; 9:6, which she takes to express a like- ness between the figure of Yahweh and the human form. The image of God, in each of these passages, is linked to roles humans have in the creation (to rule, to bear chil- dren, to refrain from murder). After discussing the passages in Gen, Middlemas returns to the prophetic texts to investigate "whether they represent alternative or compatible perspectives" (136). With regard to the incomparability passages in Second Isaiah, she concludes that the use of verbal forms (rather than nouns) suggests that " nothing is to be made comparable to [the divine figure]" (138), not excluding that something in the creation might resemble the likeness of Yahweh, and considers that there is an implicit equation of Yahwistic and human forms in Second Isaiah. In Ez, she argues, Yahweh appears in human form, but not as a single stable figure, which leads her to suggest that the Priestly Writer, too, uses multiple imaging by referring to male and female gender and to various roles of human beings. In a short conclusion (chapter 6), Middelmas provides an overview of the books argument and emphasizes the need to consider mental imaging in the discussion of aniconism. She concludes that the prophetic aniconic tradition, through statements of incomparability and comparability, attests to a God other and transcendent, and at the same time present and near to the divine creation. Middlemas' book brings a refreshing view of aniconism by taking into considera- tion not only material objects but also mental images. This perspective on stabilized vs. multiple iconography has interesting potential for further research. However, the fact that the term is used by other exegetes in a different sense creates some confusion and it might be worthwile to think of a different term for Middelmas' concept of "aniconic rhetorics". In particular, the aniconic concept used in this book embraces aspects not commonly associated with aniconism, such as polemics against the cult of other deities without reference to images, as in Jer 19:5; 32:35 (p. 48), the exclusive usage of divinity language for Yahweh (p. 4 If), and the avoidance of female imagery in relation to the city of Jerusalem (p. 57). Thus, a clarification of the terminology used and possibly a more nuanced use of terms (aniconism, anti-iconism, iconoclasm) may help prevent misinterpretations by the reader. Middlemas rightly states that earlier studies (Preuss, for example) read the polemical texts only under the aspect of idolatry and monotheism, passing over the question of aniconism, and it is certainly a most welcome effort to bring the issue of Yahwistic imagery into the discussion. Yet her broad understanding of "aniconism" carries the opposite danger of focussing on aniconism, where other aspects like Yahwehs reliability or political polemics, for example, might be more central to the meaning of a particular text. A more explicit statement on her methodology would have been helpful to make her analysis more transparent to the reader. Although it is not the aim of this book to compare Mesopotamian and Hebrew discourses on gods and cult images, it would have been useful to include a comparative perspective to validate the methodology for detecting aniconic rhetoric. Thus, it might be interesting to take into consideration that complex multiple imaging is also used in Mesopotamian texts without attacking the cultic use of images (e.g., the famous hymn KAR 102 equating body parts of the god Ninurta to various deities). Moreover, the broad understanding of aniconism might convey an idea of iconic cult that falls behind the nuanced studies of Berlejung and others. Statements like "Yahweh as incomparable functions to dissuade and deny the basis for iconism, a God without</page><page sequence="4">114 Buchbesprechungen/Book Reviews equivalence is also a deity that cannot be imitated by an idol" (153) might lead the general reader (for whom the book is intended, p. VII) to adopt an oversimplified and polemically informed view on iconic cults. We should bear in mind, however, that the idea of the cult image as similiar to rather than representative of the deity is a polemical concept of the biblical writers. It remains a challenge for the exegete to describe the polemical strategy of the texts without taking on an anti-iconic bias. In this sense, it might be helpful to abandon the term "idol", which Middlemas uses for deities other than Yahweh and their images alike. In sum, Middlemas' emphasis on a more complex understanding of "aniconism" and her search for rhetorical strategies that destabilize fixed mentid images of God raise many inspiring questions and offer interesting possibilities for further research. Her theological reflections on the image(s) of a God both transcendent and close to humanity will certainly also stimulate the discussion among a broader audience. Sonja Ammann</page></plain_text>
