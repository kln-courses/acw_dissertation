The immense scope of Dante's poem attests to the stimulus of a love whose object the same poem cannot represent or "transfigure." Coextensive with the impulse of human love, the imagination is infinite; but the figures and words by which the imaginative experience expresses itself are finite. The free imagina- tion is imprisoned by its very act of shaping or image-making, partic- ularly when its images are derived from the historical ideologies ("words of hate and awe")-in Dante's case, Christianity. The human mind habitually ignores or accepts its imprisonment, and worships the shapes it or other, similar minds have created. Hence, the Divzne Comedy may exert its own ideological spell, in turn, over successive generations of readers.2 The deformation of the imaginative experience into ideology is both the subject and intrinsic poetic process of The Triumph of Life. The parodistic elements of the poem, Biblical, Platonic, Dantesque, epitomize its theme: "thought's empire over thought," a history of texts that forever recast the life of the mind into their own image. Crit- icism treating its allusive texture by reading backwards through the continuum of the history of ideas-the same continuum that is por- trayed in the enslaved triumphal procession following the chariot of Life-understandably has not yielded satisfactory solutions to its dif- 'All citations of The Triumph of Life are taken from the new variorum edition of Donald H.

His allegorical figures do not point to some paraphrasable abstraction for which they have been substituted, but to their own function as imaginative representation. The two major "allegories" of the poem, the theophanic chariot and the female soul-figure who appears to Rousseau, are derived from two central myths of Western civilization, and portray their own progress from representation to myth and their eventual ideological domina- tion over the human mind. In both instances, Shelley reduces the representational image to its lowest common denominator, to mere "Shape." The shadow, the mediation in Plato's cave of the philosopher, is taken over by Shelley as a general figure for representation. In the poem's terms, human shadows stand for the figures cast by the imagi- nation, reflections not of the outer but of the inner man. These and other shadows haunt the crowd of humanity that attends the chariot of Life. And others mournfully within the gloom Of their own shadow walked, and called it death . . .

Bloom offers a useful summary of previous criticism of the poem. James Rieger, following Bloom's lead when he identifies the Shape who appears to Rousseau as the embodiment of Nature and finds the poem to be a brief for suicide, nonetheless makes some suggestive contri- butions in The Mutiny Within (New York, 1967), pp. 207-221.

(58-73) Sight supersedes the other senses but in a negative mode; man's obses- sion with the visual shadow alienates him from the synesthetic sources of the imagination, the fountain and cave which reappear at the beginning of Rousseau's autobiographical narrative (313-314). The passage distinguishes two forms of shadow-worship. The private self -enchanters are possessed by their own shadows. The public ideo- logues, greater in number and prone to social discord ("with motions which each other crost"), pursue or shun shadows cast by foreign objects blocking the sun, like the "eclipse" which is worshipped in place of the "true Sun" in verses 288-292. While this distinction sepa- rates the individual poet, Rousseau, in love with his own imaginative creations, from the multitudes who follow the chariot as the victims of the historical ideologies, it is, in fact, a distinction without a differ- ence. Rousseau, too, is swept up in the triumphal procession, and, his own claims to the contrary, he is an exemplary rather than an excep- tional figure. His detailed narrative will reveal the common structure of desire which leads self-enchanter and ideologue alike into life- imprisonment by the representational image. As representations of an inner subjectivity, Shelley implies in the Essay on Love, the human shadows wrought by the imagination pro- ject an absence no more substantial than the evanescent cloud or lost bird. Thou demandest, What is Love? It is that powerful attraction towards all that we conceive or fear, or hope beyond our- selves, when we find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient void and seek to waken in all things that are a community with what we experience within ourselves.4 The void within, an unconstituted selfhood, initiates the desire for external self-representation. The imagination turns to "all things that are" outside the self in search of a sympathetic kindred spirit or mirror image that will, in turn, gloss or define the self. The operative word here is "all." The hunger of the self, the "chasm," is infinite, 4Shelley's Prose or The Trumpet of a Prophecy, ed.

This quest of love is as endless as it is vital to the human spirit: Shelley equates its cessation with a living death. So soon as this want or power is dead, man becomes the living sepulchre of himself, and what yet survives is the mere husk of what he once was.5 Here is the subject matter of The Triumph of Life: a death-in-life occasioned by man's surrender to ideological representation, whether an ideology shaped by the private imagination or derived ready-made from past thinkers. Prisoners of their own mental constructs, the self- enchanters "mournfully within the gloom / Of their own shadow walked, and called it death." A similar "deep night" enveloped the ideologues behind the chariot during their lifetimes ("ere evening"). "And who are those chained to the car?" "The Wise, "The great, the unforgotten: they who wore Mitres &amp; helms &amp; crowns, or wreathes of light, Signs of thought's empire over thought; their lore Taught them not this-to know themselves; their might Could not repress the mutiny within, And for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night Caught them ere evening." (208-215) The "mutiny within" corresponds to the "insufficient void" of the Essay on Love. Unable to answer their own self-questioning-the question is the major form of action in The Triumph of Life-men attribute authority to representation and create ideology. Ideology, the feigned "morn of truth," fills the insufficient void, providing a system of beliefs that answers all questions. His infinite desire satis- fied by finite representation, the ideologue is emptied of his capacity for love and imagination; he becomes the husk described by the Essay on Love, one of the chariot's victims whose hour Was drained to its last sand in weal or woe, So that the trunk survived both fruit &amp; flower. (122-124) These victims include Rousseau, the distorted root. 5Ibid., p. 171.</page><page sequence="5">DA VID QUINT 643 The gloom, the sepulchral shadow which surrounds the ideologue are properties transferred from their source, the chariot of Life. Like the young moon When on the sunlit limits of the night Her white shell trembles amid crimson air And whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might Doth, as a herald of its coming, bear The ghost of her dead Mother, whose dim form Bends in dark ether from her infant's chair, So came a chariot on the silent storm Of its own rushing splendour, and a Shape So sate within as one whom years deform Beneath a dusky hood &amp; double cape Crouching within the shadow of a tomb, And o'er what seemed the head, a cloud like crape, Was bent a dun &amp; faint etherial gloom Tempering the light. (79-93) In the theophany of the first chapter of Ezekiel, the prophet beholds "the likeness and appearance of a man" enveloped in a glory cloud and seated on the throne of the chariot of God. Shelley's parody sub- stitutes a Shape whose contours seem to be defined by its shadowy cloak; another shadow acts as charioteer. Beyond an implicit attack upon the anthropomorphism of the Judaeo-Christian deity, the Shape is the principle of ideology, any representational shadow exalted into a god, into an absolute authority that exerts its tyranny over the mind and imagination. Although itself moulded by shadow, the false but exclusive light of the chariot forbids "shadow to fall from leaf or stone" (445) and will eventually deprive man, too, of the shadow-making powers of his imagination. The Shape appears "as one whom years deform," and the burden of the dead parent in the moon simile suggests the historical dimension of the pageant which follows in the chariot's wake; the ideas and images of the past continue to cast their shadow over the present. But modern thinkers and their thought have no more claim to authority than their predecessors.

(243-251) With wonderfully ironic understatement, the speaker rejects the Enlightenment idea of progress. One shadow-figure replaces another in the historic continuum. "Paint them how you may," they still remain only figures. By worshipping the dogmas of ancients or mod- erns, the ideologue de-historicizes the figure, ignoring its essential character as timebound representation. For the figures, too, shall pass, unless they are restored to a ghostly second life as ideology. The final section of the poem (480 ff.) depicts just such a resurrec- tion. The deformed light of the chariot turns the shadows produced by the human imagination into ideological phantoms which return to haunt their creators. the marble brow of youth was cleft With care, and in the eyes where once hope shone Desire like a lioness bereft "Of its last cub, glared ere it died; each one Of that great crowd sent forth incessantly These shadows, numerous as the dead leaves blown "In Autumn evening from a poplar tree- Each, like himself Sc like each other were, At first, but soon distorted, seemed to be "Obscure clouds moulded by the casual air; And of this stuff the car's creative ray Wrought all the busy phantoms that were there "As the sun shapes the clouds-" (523-535) In its Aeneid context (VI, 309-310) the simile of the autumn leaves re- fers to the unburied dead, an appropriate enough allusion here to de- scribe the shadows which are not allowed to die their "natural" death.6 The simile suggests the levelling effect of a common mortal- 6The human shadows distorted into phantoms have been identified by Paul Turner with the Lucretian simulacra (De Rerum Natura IV, 26-521), the visual images which</page><page sequence="7">DA VID QUINT 645 ity; here it depicts the original equivalence of the shadows ("Each like himself and like each other were / At first"). But the shadows become phantoms, the stuff of ideology; the "casual air" indicates the arbi- trariness which privileges certain figures and grants them member- ship in the history of ideas/ideology. The phantoms in their turn exhaust man's capacity to cast off further shadows. When the cycle is completed, the phantoms' victims have lost the vital faculty of self- representation; under ideological domination, human desire and imagination cease to function. As the lioness Desire loses her last cub, so the followers of the chariot, shedding "mask after mask," enter a living death and fall by the wayside: "'Those soonest from whose forms most shadows past / And least of strength &amp; beauty did abide.'" (542-543). Rousseau is the poem's paradigm for man's temptation and fall before the representational shape. He appears as "an old root which grew / To strange distortion out of the hill side" (182-183). Beyond the significance of the husk image in Shelley's private symbolism, the topos of the human tree derives from a long literary history. Ariosto's Astolfo, Spenser's Fradubio and Fraelissa, the metamorphosed vic- tims of Circean enchantresses, prefigure Rousseau who drinks from the cup of a Shape who is in some sense the daughter of the sun; we shall return to this romance configuration below. The topos also links Rousseau to Pier delle Vigne in Dante's wood of suicides (Inferno XIII). While Shelley may have in the back of his mind a tra- dition which made a suicide out of the historical Rousseau's death,7 his Rousseau dies the metaphorical suicide of self-enchantment. "I was overcome By my own heart alone, which neither age "Nor tears nor infamy nor now the tomb Could temper to its object." (240-243) mediate between objects and the human eye. The Triumph of Life portrays the conse- quences of representation, like the simulacra, assuming an independent life of its own. Turner, "Shelley and Lucretius," RES, 10 (1959), 281-282. 7Madame de Sta'l suggests that Rousseau committed suicide in her sixth letter "Sur le caractere de Rousseau," Oeuvres de Madame La Baronesse de Stael-Holstein (Paris, 1838),I, 45 ff. Madame de Stael's theory that Rousseau's death was caused by his inabil- ity to find a reciprocal love may influence Shelley's depiction of Rousseau's ideological "suicide" as an attempt to make the Shape come to life and respond to his desire. There is a discussion of suicide in the twenty-first and twenty-second letters of the third part of La Nouvelle HHoise.</page><page sequence="8">646 THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE Like the damned sinners of the Commedia, whose different voices he will from time to time assume, Rousseau insists upon the personal uniqueness of his fall. But Shelley, like Dante, undercuts the "true confessions" of his protagonist; Rousseau's insatiable desire deprived of its object is the desire of everyman. Indeed, the pathos of Rous- seau's narrative lies in its implication that man, even when independ- ent of the historical ideologies, will become an ideologue unto himself, prompted by the longings of his unquiet heart. Critics have compared the opening of Rousseau's narrative (verses 308-335) to Wordsworth's Intimations ode;8 beginning with his April birth, "asleep / Under a mountain"-the metaphor is of spring sowing-the passage describes childhood experience preceding the moment of self-consciousness. The general outlines are similar: like Wordsworth, Shelley opposes childhood, a period of enchantment by nature, to the adult world and its historical pressures; the pre- determined roles handed out to the actor-child in section 7 of Words- worth's ode have much in common with Shelley's depiction of ideological conformance. But, ultimately, Shelley's is a very different version of the Romantic myth of childhood. The spell exerted by nature upon the child Rousseau not only blots out the consciousness of history-suggested by the similes of the bereft mother and dethroned king (verses 321-326), generational and political images darkly conceived in terms of loss-but it also denies the possibility of the Platonic and Wordsworthian anamnesis of a divine origin. "Whether my life had been before that sleep The Heaven which I imagine, or a Hell Like this harsh world in which I wake to weep, I know not." (332-335) The child of The Triumph of Life fails to perceive the divine glory in nature, because pre-conscious or unconscious, the child perceives nothing. This total oblivion is none the less positive, shielding the child from the burden of selfhood. As his Lethean childhood recedes, Rousseau "arises" into self-consciousness and must confront unanswerable questions of origin and identity. Only after the onset of consciousness does Rousseau discern a Wordsworthian "visionary gleam" upon the landscape, a moment which parallels the vision of 8Allott, pp. 223-224, attacks Bloom, pp. 263 ff., for reading the mountain and cave as a locus of childhood rather than of birth. I believe both readings are correct; Shelley simply conflates infancy and the childhood experience which precedes self- consciousness. Reiman, pp. 60-61, correctly demonstrates to what extent Shelley's depiction of childhood is anti-Wordsworthian.</page><page sequence="9">DA VID QUINT 647 the speaker at the beginning of the poem; the isolated speaker is sim- ilarly out of phase with the natural order, unable to partake in its re- freshing sleep or morning ritual. As clear as when a veil of light is drawn O'er evening hills they glimmer; (32-33) a gentle trace Of light diviner than the common Sun Sheds on the common Earth. (337-339) But the shimmering veil of visionary light is already the product of the imagination replacing and compensating for nature's spell of for- getfulness: Rousseau imagines a heavenly pre-existence. Conscious- ness and the desire which sparks the imagination coincide; in the terms of the Essay on Love, the human subjectivity attempts to consti- tute itself through self-representation, projecting its inner longings upon the outside world. Man turns back towards nature for the sources of the imagination, sources at first synesthetic and predomi- nantly aural, but which are a prelude to visual representation. and I knew That I had felt the freshness of that dawn, Bathed in the same cold dew my brow &amp; hair And sate as thus upon that slope of lawn Under the self-same bough, &amp; heard as there The birds, the fountains &amp; the Ocean hold Sweet talk in music through the enamoured air, And then a Vision on my brain was rolled . . .

(339-341) After being immersed in the morning dew and the music of nature, the speaker, apparently an old hand at such imaginative experience, envisions the action of the poem. Rousseau's imagination, in its first and last action in his compressed capsule autobiography, creates the visionary "Shape."</page><page sequence="10">648 THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE In his pioneering essay, Yeats correctly derived the cave and flow- ing river, recurrent images in Shelley's poetry, from Porphyry's Con- cerning the Cave of the Nymphs, which was translated by Thomas Taylor in 1789.9 In Porphyry's allegory, Homer's cave (Odyssey XIII, verses 96 ff.) represents the avenue by which the incorporeal soul enters material generation. Shelley applies this Neoplatonic model to the man Rousseau and to his imaginative Shape alike, both of them born inside the cave. The Rousseau-Shape analogy structures the imaginative act-the generation of the representational Shape-in terms of the bipartite movement of Rousseau's emergence from pre- consciousness to consciousness. The natural reverie of the senses which precedes the production of the Shape derives from the same natural enchantment which surrounds the pre-conscious child. When the Shape passes out of her cave into representational being, she parallels Rousseau's alienation from nature after the moment of consciousness. The image is the secondary, conscious by-product of the imaginative process. But the image's non-representational ori- gins in an initial pre-conscious or subconscious stage of synesthetic reverie, precisely because they are non-representational, are as inac- cessible to the mind as the oblivious state of childhood or a Neopla- tonic pre-existence in the stars. Shelley portrays the "ineluctable modality of the visible" of the imagination, able to understand its own workings only in terms of its own images. By simply reversing the analogy, the Neoplatonic birth myth itself may be seen as the reflection of the structure of imaginative represen- tation. Such a reversal is already suggested by Taylor's translation of Porphyry. And souls insnared by corporeal love, and attracting to their nature a humid spirit, condense this watery vehicle like a cloud; for a cloud is nothing more than humour condensed in the air. But the pneumatic part thus condensed, through too great an abundance of humour becomes the object of cor- poreal sight. And among the number of these we must reckon 9William Butler Yeats, "The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry" in Essays and Intro- ductions (New York, 1972), pp. 82 ff. Taylor's translation of Porphyry is reprinted in Thomas Taylor the Platonist: Selected Writings, ed. Kathleen Raine and George Mills Harper (Princeton, 1969), pp. 296-323. While Shelley appears to have known Concerning the Cave of the Nymphs directly, his poetic source was undoubtedly Paradise Lost IV, 449 ff. Eve awakes, as does Rous- seau, beside the cave and stream of Porphyry's allegory. In the waters she beholds a "fshape" (461), which is, of course, her own reflection. Rousseau similarly perceives his self-projection in the Shape "on the vibrating / Floor of the fountain. . ." (350-351).</page><page sequence="11">DA VID QUINT 649 those apparitions of images, which from a spirit coloured by the influence of imagination, present themselves to mankind."1 Porphyry's last sentence refers to spectres and ghosts, but Taylor's version blurs the distinction between the supernatural and the imagi- nary. The Shape, later compared to a ghost (428, 433), draws moisture about her and comes into being. The passage, linking the assumption of the cloudlike body to an erotic stimulus, is congenial to Shelley's concept of love as self-representation. It may gloss the earlier depic- tion of sexual love in verses 149-160, where the collision of rain clouds (155-157) appears to describe not merely a physical exchange but also the interpenetration of two projected subjectivities. The nexus of love and representation also accounts for the Shape's femininity. Rous- seau's imagination, reaching out at the moment of consciousness for a transcendent object that will define his selfhood, confuses physical and metaphysical desire. The seductiveness of the Shape is further heightened by her "metri- cal" components. The Shape's rhythmical dancing recalls the Muses invoked at the beginning of Hesiod's Theogony, who beat out the time with their feet." "And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune To which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot The thoughts of him who gazed on them, &amp; soon "All that was seemed as if it had been not, As if the gazer's mind was strewn beneath Her feet like embers, &amp; she, thought by thought, "Trampled its fires into the dust of death, As Day upon the thresholds of the east Treads out the lamps of night. (382-390) '?Thomas Taylor the Platonist, p. 304. ""From the Heliconian Muses let us begin to sing, who hold the great and holy mount of Helicon, and dance on soft feet about the deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of Cronos, and, when they have washed their tender bodies in Permessus or in the Horse's Spring or Olmeius, make their fair lovely dances upon highest Helicon and move with vigorous feet." Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica, trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White, The Loeb Classical Library (London and New York, 1926), p. 79. For the feet-poetic feet reading, I am indebted to Professor Paul de Man of Yale University. A second possible source for Shelley's airborne Shape is Homer's account (Iliad XIX, 92 ff.) of Ate, Delusion, whose delicate feet "do not touch the ground, but she walks over the heads of men, harming them." The Homeric passage is assimilated in the description of Eros in Plato's Symposium (195d). The Shape's de- structive footwork may recall the classical goddess of Infatuation.</page><page sequence="12">650 THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE The Shape's "poetic feet" enhance her charms. Here, and perhaps only here, the poem shades into a specifically literary polemic. But the "rhetorical" fascination of the Shape is supplemental to her pri- marily visual attraction as imaginative representation-note the insistence upon "gazed" and "gazer." Her dancing reproduces or transfers into representation the aural charms associated with nature's Lethean reverie. Hesiod's Muses, the daughters of memory, bestow the gift of forgetfulness. Rousseau's forgetfulness, extinguishing the thoughts and fire of his mind (verse 201: "the spark with which heaven lit my spirit"), reveals the latent negativity of the imagination which will turn upon itself and invite its own destruction. At her most captivating, erotic, and musical, the representational Shape is most dangerous; obsessing the mind of her creator to the exclusion and stamping-out of all other thought, she becomes its idele fixe. Yet the fault does not lie with representation per se. Like Macbeth's dagger, the Shape is merely the incarnation of desire, born of an inner want. Prompted by his unquenchable thirst for selfhood-his "insufficient void"- Rousseau willingly suspends disbelief; he attributes authority and truth-value to the Shape. In doing so, he creates his private ideology. ". . . as one between desire and shame Suspended, I said-'If, as it doth seem, Thou comest from the realm without a name, "'Into this valley of perpetual dream, Shew whence I came, and where I am, and why- Pass not away upon the passing stream.' "'Arise and quench thy thirst,' was her reply. (393-400) Rousseau's question is his fall; the Shape's cup of Nepenthe is his apple. He refuses to acknowledge that the Shape is subject to the tem- poral boundaries of human representation; "pass not away" contrasts to the speaker's "Let them pass," addressed to the shadow-figures at verse 243. Rather, Rousseau chooses to associate her non- representational imaginative origins ("the realm without a name") with some kind of "divine" or eternal order of truth; he rebuilds the Neoplatonic myth which the poem is at pains to deconstruct. His shame indicates that Rousseau may know better, but his desire pre- vails, a desire to solve the riddle of his existence. Shelley, in the Essay on Life, recognizes the inadequacy of human representation to supply the answers.</page><page sequence="13">DA VID QUINT 651 What is life? Thoughts and feelings arise, with or without our will, and we employ words to express them. We are born, and our birth is unremembered, and our infancy remembered but in fragments; we live on, and in living we lose the appre- hension of life. How vain is it to think that words can pene- trate the mystery of our being! Rightly used they may make evident our ignorance to ourselves, and this is much. For what are we? Whence do we come? And whither do we go? Is birth our commencement, is death the conclusion of our being? What is birth and death?'2 Philosophy, impatient as it may be to build, has much work yet remaining as pioneer for the overgrowth of ages. It makes one step towards this object: it destroys error and the roots of error. It leaves, what is too often the duty of the reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy. It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would have acted but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own creation. By signs, I would be understood in a wide sense, including what is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly mean. In this latter sense, almost all familiar objects are signs, standing not for themselves but for others in their capacity of suggesting one thought which shall lead to a train of thoughts. Our whole life is thus an education of error. 13 The second passage makes clear that Shelley's concept of representa- tion extends beyond the written word; by a trick of the imagination, all external objects may assume representational qualities. Read together, the two passages offer useful commentary on the problems of The Triumph of Life. The necessity of representation arises from the desire to "penetrate the mystery of our being," a desire which is as inevitable as it is sometimes involuntary ("with or without our will"). But truth cannot reside in imaginative representation, which, when granted authority, only leads to error. Philosophy, conceived as a "pioneer for the overgrowth of the ages," would undertake the poem's quarrel with the history of ideas; Shelley's goal is the free mind, able to recognize the representational nature both of past ideas and of the products of its own imagination. The result is a "vacancy," which again should be understood in terms of the "insufficient void" of the Essay on Love. In asking men to expect no more from words and signs than the revelation of their own ignorance, Shelley asks them to accept that void, to accept the proposition that the desire for 12Shelley's Prose, p. 172. "3Ibid., pp. 173-174.</page><page sequence="14">652 THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE selfhood can never be satisfied, rather than to enslave their minds and imaginations to a fictive, representational selfhood. Rousseau, however, refuses to live in a state of unfulfilled desire: he cannot repress his own "mutiny within." He plays Pygmalion to the Shape's Galatea,4 demanding that this figment of his imagination come to life in order to remove the thirst for selfhood which attends human consciousness. The Shape's Nepenthe, like the forgetfulness induced by her dance, are negative substitutions for the oblivion of childhood. But the wish to return to a state of unconsciousness, free from desire, is as futile as it is regressive. Rousseau drinks with disas- trous results. "And suddenly my brain became as sand "Where the first wave had more than half erased The track of deer on desert Labrador, Whilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed "Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore Until the second bursts-" (405-410) The passage is crucial and difficult. Yeats helpfully suggests that the wolf symbolizes desire.'5 Under the influence of the Shape's Nepenthe-the first wave-the tracks of the deer, the inaccessible object of desire, are all but washed away. Left in their place are the tracks of the wolf, the image of desire, which I would identify with the Shape herself. Rousseau remains trapped in the mediations of his longing until he is overcome by the conquering chariot of Life-the second wave. Then the Shape, too, disappears. The Shape vanishes because Rousseau has "quenched" his desire. His willing subjection to his Shape paradoxically destroys the very imagination which created her. Under the impact of the chariot's light, she fades away.

The Shape sheds her representational being, "veil by veil," anticipating the "mask after mask" which fall from the chari- ot's victims at verse 536. Like those literary figures, Christ and Socrates (verses 128-134),16 the Shape returns to her "native noon," to a non-representational or pre-representational state figured by the invisible evening star.'7 In her non-representational, hence humanly unknowable, "pre-existence," the Shape can only be evoked through the synesthetic combination of the non-visual senses: smell, hearing, touch (the jonquil, the shepherd's lament, the caress) which we have already associated with the non-representational component of the imagination. But the representational power of Rousseau's imagina- tion is effectively dead.'8 "6I am also indebted to Professor de Man for the suggestive argument that Jesus and Socrates share the Shape's representational status as characters in a fiction. In The Gutenberg Galaxy (New York, 1969), pp. 121-124, Marshall McLuhan cites a text of Thomas Aquinas which explains why neither Christ nor Socrates committed their teachings to writing, preferring instead a "higher" inspirational and non- representational mode of teaching. Either of these lines of argument is to be preferred as an explanation for Shelley's grouping together of Christ and Socrates than the suicide theory proposed by Bloom and Rieger.

Hartman, "Reflections on the Evening Star: Akenside to Coleridge" in New Perspectives on Cole- ridge and Wordsworth: Selected Papers from the English Institute (New York and Lon- don, 1972), pp. 85-13 1, esp. 91-93. 18The Shape's transformation into a "ghost of a forgotten form of sleep" may be par- alleled in the final pages of La Nouvelle HWloise. Madame d'Orbe declares after the death of Julie:</page><page sequence="16">654 THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE Yeats and, among modern critics, Harold Bloom have pointed out the tripartite hierarchy of light in The Triumph of Life: the star, the sun, the glare of the chariot of Life.'9 We are told that the Shape blots out Rousseau's thoughts as the morning sun puts out the stars (388- 390); the same metaphor describes the loss of the Shape in the light of the chariot. This reciprocity, one stage of the imagination succeeding another, is already suggested by the initial description of the chariot. And a cold glare, intenser than the noon But icy cold, obscured with light The Sun as he the stars. (77-79) If we are to understand this hierarchy, I believe that we must identify the Shape with her "father," the Sun. Plato declares the sun "the author of visibility in all visible things";20 the Shape is the representa- tional product of the imagination which supersedes the eclipsed non- representational star. If the star represents an "ideal" object of desire (the deer of the earlier simile), then the sun is the agent which gives that desire an intelligible representational shape (the wolf). The star and sun would consequently correspond to the dual structure of the imagination we have already outlined: the sun to its conscious, image-making functions, the star to its pre-conscious, non- representational "origins." In terms of the human biography, the sun, the adult, image-producing imagination, replaces the star, the synesthetic childhood reverie. Both, in turn, fall before the ideologi- cal domination of the chariot. Even as he joins the other victims of ideology in their long proces- sion in the wake of the chariot, Rousseau continues to proclaim his personal uniqueness. "-I among the multitude Was swept; me sweetest flowers delayed not long, Me not the shadow nor the solitude, Non, elle n'a point quitte ces lieux qu'elle nous rendit si charmants; ils sont encore tout remplis d'elle. Je la vois sur chaque objet, je la sens ai chaque pas, ai chaque instant du jour j'entends les accents de sa voix. Julie ou la Nouvelle Heloise (Paris, 1960), p. 732. Julie, too, parodies Socrates and Jesus on her deathbed, p. 714: "je ne vous quitte pas, pour ainsi dire, je reste avec vous; en vous laissant tous unis, mon esprit, mon coeur vous demeurent." The Shape's de- mise into a genius loci may well reflect Julie's death, which as the self-conscious Preface de Julie implies, could represent the historical Rousseau's own deconstruction of his novel's central image of desire. 19Yeats, pp. 93 ff.; Bloom, pp. 270 ff. 2ORepublic VI, 509b.</page><page sequence="17">DA VID QUINT 655 "Me not the falling stream's Lethean song, Me, not the phantom of that early form Which moved upon its motion,-but among "The thickest billows of the living storm I plunged, and bared my bosom to the clime Of that cold light, whose airs too soon deform.-" (460-468) Rhetorically, his fall behind the chariot becomes a defiant suicidal gesture ("I plunged, and bared my bosom") instead of surrender to a common human lot. Rousseau's claim to exceptionality stems from his Romantic "originality." "I Am one of those who have created, even "If it be but a world of agony." (293-295) Unlike other followers of the chariot, Rousseau has not succumbed to the historical ideologies but to the creations of his own imagination. But Shelley, abolishing the distinction between the ideologue and the self-enchanter, finds the fault to lie not in history but in ourselves. The anaphoric repetition of "me" may recall the ubiquitous moi, the moi seul of the Confessions and the Re^veries. But the anaphora also echoes the speech of Dante's Ulysses. Ne dolcezza di figlio, ne' la pieta Del vecchio padre, ne '1 debito amore Lo qual devea Penelope far lieta, Vincer poter dentro da me l'ardore Ch' i' ebbi a divenir del mondo esperto.21 (Neither tenderness for my son, nor piety towards my aged father, nor the love I owed which should have made Penelope happy could conquer the ardor that I had within me to gain knowledge of the world. Inferno XXVI, 94-98) At the moment he claims the uniqueness of his fall, Rousseau imitates the literary model Ulysses. Ulysses shares with Rousseau the infinite desire for knowledge which he claims separates him-the scorner of familial ties-from the normal run of men. And Ulysses is 2ILa Divina Commedia di Dante Alighiere, ed. C. H. Grandgent (Boston, 1933), pp. 235-236; my italics.</page><page sequence="18">656 THE TRIUMPH OF LIFE similarly undercut: he is the Commedia's exemplary figure of the sinner, the man who would slake his inner thirst not in the love of God but through his own human intellect.22 Shelley and Dante both belittle the powers of the mind to know the transcendent object of its desire. Shelley goes one step further by reducing Christian revelation to just another human mental construct, to ideological representa- tion; hence his quarrel with Dante, for whose allegorical mode of thought he none the less shares considerable sympathy. If Ulysses stands for all sinners in the Commedia, Rousseau, whose insatiable desire does not allow him to linger in the early stages of the imagina- tion but rushes him to enslavement by the chariot, exemplifies the human ideologue in The Triumph of Life. When the self-asserting Ulysses must describe his drowning and shipwreck, he confesses that he was not the master of a fate decided "com' Altrui piacque" ("as it pleased Another"); Rousseau, plunging into the "billows of that liv- ing storm" in a metaphorical drowning, brings about his ideological death-in-life by merely yielding to the inevitable. Rousseau's exemplary position lies at the center of the story- within-a-story structure of The Triumph of Life. In their respective epics, Ruggiero and Red Crosse listen patiently to the warnings of the enchanted human trees Astolfo and Fradubio, and then proceed none the less to fall to the same temptations of Alcina and Duessa against which they have been warned. So it may be with the speaker, who seems to imitate Rousseau point by point. Rousseau admonishes the speaker to abate his "thirst of knowledge" (194), but the speaker, like Rousseau, cannot stop asking questions. He puts to Rousseau a ques- tion parallel to the one Rousseau had made of the Shape: "'Whence comest thou &amp; wither goest thou? / How did thy course begin, ' I said, ' &amp; why?"' (296-297). Rousseau is the speaker's Shape, the fig- ure of his visionary imagination, and the speaker appears to repeat Rousseau's own error of seeking the truths of existence from represen- tation. But if Rousseau has fallen, and the speaker seems about to fall, the final say belongs to the poem's reader, who must deal with the outermost of its Chinese boxes despite evidence that it is a Pandora's box. For the story-within-a-story, if it reveals the fictionality of the poem, also implicates the reader in that fiction. If the reader's desire 22For Ulysses as exemplary sinner and antitype of the pilgrim Dante see John Freccero, "Dante's Prologue Scene," Dante Studies, 84 (1966), 1-25.</page><page sequence="19">DA VID QUINT 657 persists to fill in the blank space on the chariot where the Shape sits crouched in shadow, rather than understand it as a vacancy which only ideology can occupy, then he, too, may join the speaker at the end of the poem in a question to which the poem offers no reply.
