<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTE More Sacred Holes in the Ritual Landscape of the Lower Pecos River Region by Solveig A. Turpin In the Lower Pecos River region of Texas, the prehistoric practice of disposing of the dead in vertical and horizontal shaft caves is a chick en-and-egg phenomenon. Were the people buried in the caves because they were sacred places or did mortuary use hallow these eminently practical natural repositories? The number of horizontal shafts or small inacces sible caves that were used as burial sites em phasizes their special role in the eschatology of the local populations (Turpin 1988; 1992). Now, however, it appears that the openings to many clefts, crevices and shafts not used for mortuary purposes are encircled by pigment, the remains of once-elaborate pictographs, or, in one case, by hundreds of incised lines (Turpin and Davis, in press). Three previously unreported instan ces of such ritual marking help clarify the relationship between rock art, holes in the bedrock, and mortuary use (Turpin 1992). The preponderance of the evidence suggests that the dominant factor is the penetration of the bedrock via a natural channel, the stuff of which myth and legend are made throughout the world. 41W1310, ATASCADO CAVE A sharp-eyed helicopter crew, searching for ibexes on an exotic game ranch, caught a glimpse of pictographs inside a small, almost inacces sible horizontal shaft cave and reported their ob servations to the ranch manager and to me. The opening to Atascado Cave, 41W1310, is barely visible from the cliffs overlooking the Devils River arm of Lake Amistad and can be reached only by creeping along a very narrow ledge. The ledge broadens to about 1 m wide at the trian gular mouth of the cave, providing a platform above a sheer drop of some 30 m to the water. Prior to inundation, the cave was minimally 50 m above the river bed and afforded a sweeping view of the western horizon from a position of almost complete isolation. Inside the 1 m high opening, the cave bells to form a small antechamber about 12 m2 in area. A narrow slit, 2 m high but only about 50 cm wide, extends back into the bedrock a distance of 5 m, where it is blocked by a large boulder which has been in place long enough to accrete travertine. Prior to the accumulation of eboulis, a small person or child could have passed beneath this rock, although it would have been a tight squeeze. What lies beyond this boulder is unknown and no obvious use of the cave as a burial chamber was surficially evident. Left of the entrance, on the curved wall of the an techamber, a brilliant red pictograph panel in cludes serpentine and chain designs flanked by smaller geometric motifs (Fig. 1). Indistinguish able blurs of red pigment outline the opening to the cleft. Mineral accretions and stains testify to the antiquity of the paintings but the discernible iconography is not consistent with any of the five pictograph styles defined for the Lower Pecos region. Superficially, geometric designs such as these are more like Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000-1500) or proto-historic paintings than the earlier Archaic types. 275</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 140,1992 Figure 1. Possibly Late Prehistoric geometric paintings at horizontal shaft cave 41W1310. With one exception, the abstract designs appear in series of six and eight motifs. The entire panel is approximately 1 meter square. 41W961, KING SHELTER Another example of elaborate painting around a crevice in the bedrock is found north of 41W1310 at 41W961, King Shelter. There, a niche in the back of an intensively occupied dry rock shelter is outlined by motifs characteristic of the Archaic-age Pecos River style, dated to approximately 3000 to 4000 years ago. The designs, which resemble wide-brimmed cowboy hats, are in fact the torsos, upraised arms, and heads of small anthropomorphic figures (Fig. 2), a convention noted at a number of other sites on both sides of the Rio Grande, where they have been mistaken for drawings of longhorn cattle. The faint outlines of their bodies establishes that they were positioned perpendicular to the left lateral of the cleft. On the right side, three typi cal shaman figures stand erect adjacent to the opening. This crevice is too small to enter, much less accommodate burials, but it may have been selectively marked as a conduit for water seep ing through the porous limestone. Such an explanation is suggested by a con fusing mass of geometric designs surrounding the mouth of a seep spring that once trickled from the bedrock and a larger circular hole under a shallow overhang near the Rio Grande. This site, 41W650, contributed to my definition of the Bold Line Geometric style, dated to the Late Prehistoric Period ca. 500 to 1000 years ago (Turpin 1986: 159), but its design peculiarities did not seem significant until now. RATTLESNAKE CANYON The last location of relevance to this issue consists solely of two large red blotches of pig ment flanking a vertical fissure in the wall of Rat tlesnake Canyon, one of the most concentrated enclaves of rock art in the region. The natural configuration of the crevice resembles female genitalia. The age of the paintings is undeter 276</page><page sequence="3">Solveig A. Turpin] LOWER PECOS SACRED HOLES Figure 2.

Compared to the elaborate murals found nearby, these innocuous paint blobs seem unim portant, but their position bracketing a vulva like rock fault is atypical if not unique in the region. DISCUSSION The inventory of clefts, crevices, caves and holes in the rock marked by pigment or paint ings around their openings shows considerable variability in size, shape, location and degree of accessibility. The one unifying factor is that all can be perceived as conduits to or from the in terior of the earth, whether real or imaginary. The relationship between sexual symbolism, regeneration, mortuary use, and chthonic origin myths suggests that some of the shafts or caves figured prominently in the regional eschatology. Where practical, burying the dead in these sites would have a synergistic effect on their ritual im portance. Water, and the marking of seeps and conduits, would not be inconsistent with sym bolic fertility, especially in an arid region such as the Lower Pecos. These attributes alone would justify the apparent selective importance at tached to these natural features, but other, less pragmatic solutions are equally attractive. A similar but more subtle relationship be tween pictographs and their rock backgrounds amongst the San of Southern Africa provides a more esoteric explanation for the Lower Pecos examples, based on their common origin in shamanistic societies (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1990). A common feature of the trance experience so essential to shamanistic perfor mances is passage through a vortex, often described as a tunnel or hole, into the spirit world. This sensation is neurologically deter mined, thus common to the trance state regard less of its culture-specific context. The sites described above range in age from perhaps 500 to 4000 years and were painted by artists from entirely different traditions, thus transcending the limitations imposed on ritual art by cultural expectations. Like the San, but thousands of years earlier, the Lower Pecos shaman may have seen these openings as "gateways to the spirit world" (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1990: 15) and marked the entrances to inform the viewing public that these were, in fact, sacred holes in their ritual landscape. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Landowners Laurent de la Grange and W. K. (Buck) King deserve credit for recognizing the importance of rock art sites on their properties. Long ago, Darlene Cork intro duced me to the rock art of 41W650. Bunny Ray was our kind and helpful companion on the Indianhead Ranch. Lee Bement and Herb Eling dragged me along the ledge to Atas cado Shelter amidst loud protestations. Jim Zintgraffs photograph of King Shelter was of great help to David G. Robinson, who drew both illustrations from slides and photos. REFERENCES CITED Lewis-Williams, J. David, and Thomas A. Dowson 1990 Through the Veil, San Rock Paintings and the Rock Face.
