<plain_text><page sequence="1">PUBLICATIONS REVIEWED REALITIES OF BIRD LIFE. By EDMUND SELOUs. With an Introduction by Julian S. Huxley, M. A. London, Constable and Co. Limited, 1927. Demy-octavo (140 x 220 mm.), xvI + 342 pp. It is so long since such a book has appeared that we of the present genera- tion must cast about for adequate critical criteria. The book is intimate and dra- matic. We feel the nipping and the eager air of the north before dawn, on the cliffs above some gray Hebridean flow, or on the windy flats of the Dutch coast. We watch, insatiably, equipped only with glasses and the genius to neglect nothing, to take nothing for granted, to com- fortably pigeon-hole nothing in the easy repository of another man's doctrine. There is no smell of powder, no hint of bird-skins, museum trays, or taxo- nomics,-nay, not even of scales, stop- watches, clinical thermometers, colored bands, or long-focus cameras. Yet the mass of solid material is so great as to inspire as finished a technician as Julian Huxley, who writes the introduction, both to quick enthusiasm and careful criticism. The volume has unity rather as a study of the mind of a brilliant ornithologist than as an attack upon any given prob- lem. Scattered, diary-like records of the behavior of birds, most frequently of the breeding behavior of the birds of the shore and the sea, are not planned for the convenience of the slit-eyed specialist. Having thrown the usual defensive sop to Cerberus in the form of disclaimers of "literary" intent ("for 'you cannot serve God and mammon,' or say here 'gam- mon' "), Selous proceeds to cram his three hundred pages almost as tightly with ironic wit, philosophic and aesthetic by- play, and an overload of polyglot literary echoes, as with solid ornithology. To have obviously gone so far, both in field and study, yet to write a volume which does not contain one stale pseudo- scientific "tag" is a mighty assertion of individuality. To have so exposed one's thoughts yet to remain a man without a doctrine indicates not so much the sceptic as the hardened cynic. If the British School, as shown by men like Howard, Nicholson, Selous and Huxley, are leading the world in the re-discovery of field ornithology, they are not doing so as a conscious unit. Selous, for instance, has no love for "territorialism". "The fact is, a bird can- not possibly be nowhere, and so is forced into having a territory." " . . . It might fly into a certain wood, field, island, etc., with a distinct idea of appropriating it, first [i. e., before localized sex and food associations were formed], which, for my part, I doubt if it ever does." Perhaps if one aspect of bird life has stronger fascination for Selous it is what he has once called "psychology in transi- tion",-the transitory iconfusion of be- havior which passes from its origin into a complexity of new adaptations and collateral values, as the singing exhibi- tions of the oyster-catchers, which seem, from a functional, sexual, origin, to have become an end in themselves. If the volume deals largely with in- stinct, it is hardly mechanized, and never freed from a haunting suggestion of some- thing higher. A pervading ironic sense of a sort of reversed anthropomorphism</page><page sequence="2">July, 1930 MINUTES OF COOPER CLUB MEETINGS 219 is often illuminating and never harmful. For instance, of the fighting of mated avocets,-"Strange matrimoniac, jurga these! They should be bitterly denied, because so human, by those 'on the side of the angels'." The splendid book-making of Constable's and the high literary standard are rarely marred. All the more shocking is such a break as "jesture" on page 29.-T. T.
