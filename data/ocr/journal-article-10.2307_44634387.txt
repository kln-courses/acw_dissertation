White Southwest Research Institute G. R. Smith and H. J. Mertz General Motors Corp. ABSTRACT This paper describes a study to determine the influence of preimpact vehicle braking on the positions and postures of unrestrained, children in the front seat at the time of collision. Anesthetized baboons were used as child sur- rogates. The unrestrained animals were placed in various initial sitting, kneeling, and standing positions typically assumed by children while traveling in automobiles. Tests were conducted with various front seat positions and seat cov- ering materials. Measurements were made of per- tinent vehicle dynamics and surrogate kinematics during the hard braking event. For each initial condition evaluated, a photosequence is given showing typical positions and postures of the sur- rogate during the braking event. The principal conclusion of the study is that the kinematic response of a child will be somewhere between that of a child dummy (probably more representative of a "braced11 child) and that of an anesthetized baboon (probably more repre- sentative of a sleeping or relaxed child). The anesthetized animal pivoted about his hips and tumbled forward in response to the braking, where- as the child dummy maintained his seat position while sliding forward. A CONCERN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT of any front seat, passenger inflatable restraint system is the effect of the added deployment forces applied to occupants who are close to the instrument panel at the time of deployment (1-6).* To determine the effect of these forces, the engineer must know the range of possible occupant positions and postures at the time of deployment. A major fac- tor influencing occupant positions and postures is the effect of preimpact braking which often occurs prior to the collision. Most vulnerable to preimpact braking is the small, unrestrained *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. child. Because such children, if unrestrained, can move off the front edge of the seat during "hard" braking, they could be near or against the instrument panel in a variety of positions and postures at the instant of the crash. It is not appropriate to conduct hard braking tests with small children because of the possibility of pro- ducing minor injuries. Possible child kinematics must be deduced from tests using appropriate child surrogates. General Motors Corporation (GM) had conduct- ed such tests using a three-year old and a six- year old child dummy as child surrogates. In the GM tests, the child dummies slid forward on the seat in response to the hard braking while main- taining their upright, seated postures. The dum- mies impacted the instrument panel and remained against the panel until the end of the braking event. This kinematic behavior is identical to that reported by Takeda, et al. , (5) who conduct- ed similar hard braking tests with the child dum- mies. Much concern was expressed by those who re- viewed the films of the child dummy kinematics that the trajectory of the child dummy may not be representative of a child's motion because the dummy's articulated joint responses were not hum- anlike and its lumbar spine was much too stiff. To investigate the effects of greater body flex- ibility on the resulting trajectories, it was proposed to conduct hard braking tests using an animal model as a more supple child surrogate. Consequently, the purpose of the study presented in this paper was to determine the trajectories of an unrestrained, anesthetized animal model during vehicle hard braking for various initial sitting, kneeling, and standing positions and postures with various front seat positions and seat coverings. The test protocol called for the surrogate to be in the right front passenger pos- ition for all tests. Anesthetized animals were placed in one of 13 characteristic sitting, knee- ling or standing postures typically assumed by children while traveling in automobiles (7). Some positions were replicated to study the 3653 0096-7 36X/83/91 04-3653$02.50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3654 H. h. STALNAKER, ET AL. effects of different seat positions (full for- ward or full rearward) and different seat cover- ings (vinyl, cloth or leather) on the surrogate's kinematics. In addition, some tests were repeat- ed with body segment s tiff eners (casts and braces) applied to the surrogates to determine if muscle tone is a significant factor in child kinematics during hard braking. Other tests were conducted with body tethers, as well as static control tests of the body support system. Sliding fric- tion tests were also conducted. Measurements were made of pertinent vehicle dynamics and animal kinematics. Vehicle dyna- mics were characterized by measuring the vehi- cle's initial speed, longitudinal deceleration and stopping distance. Animal kinematics were monitored with two on-board, orthogonal, high- speed cinecameras. In addition to the high-speed film coverage, a documentary cinefilm of each braking test was taken at standard speed with an off-board camera. The surrogate's initial posi- tion and final position, as well as details of vehicle set up, were recorded with 35 mm color photographs. This paper contains discussions of the ex- perimental protocol including selection and de- scription of the child surrogate, the test vehi- cle set up and instrumentation, and the test conditions. This discussion is followed by a summary of the braking test results including the effects of parameter variations and altera- tions in surrogate body segment stiffness produc- ed with the various braces. A comparison of the trajectories of the anesthetized animal and the child dummy is given. TEST PROCEDURE AND PROTOCOL ANIMAL SPECIES SELECTION - Since this study was to concentrate on subject kinematics of a living three-year old child, only nonhuman pri- mates were considered because of the need for an- thropometric similarity. Of the available non- human primates, the chimpanzee is usually consi- dered the most humanlike in terms of size, deve- lopmental history and physiology. This animal, however, is on the endangered species list. Con- sultation with the Southwest Foundation for Re- search and Education (SFRE) /Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) Animal Use Committee led to dropping the chimpanzee as a candidate. The various species of baboons were then surveyed and the Pap io hamadryas was selected as the child surrogate. This species is character- ized by arms and legs that are short in compari- son to the torso, a characteristic shared with human children. The population of Papio hama- dryas at SFRE (the subcontractor for animals and animal support services) was screened for animals in; the 14-16 kg weight range. Candidate animals were anesthetized and measured with a standard anthropometer and tape measure (Figure 1) . These measurements were compared against equivalent measurements for an average size three-year old child obtained from published data by Reynolds, et al. (8). Two baboons were selected for the test program. A listing of each animal's meas- urements is contained in Table 1. The equiva- lent measurements for a Sierra three^year old child dummy, as well as the Reynold's child measurements, are included for comparison. &gt;SI&lt; &gt;*&lt; &gt;»&lt; . &amp; «A»» . f - i ,t 1 (f ļEĒ^jrr; f i ,t 1 f IS niPr- ļ I ' ) 41 ( fu 1 tLy IS ļ I ' ) 41 ( 1 tLy )¿ ' ^ «0 V Ï 'l / &gt;.&lt; ) 41 ( /V.

The dummy was chosen as the basis for this comparison because it could serve as a physical standard. The comparison of other data sets for children, as well as future proposed dummies, can be related back to the baboons through a comparison with the Sierra dummy. TABLE 1.

VEHICLE MODIFICATION - The vehicle used for this series of tests was a 1979 Buick Electra Park Avenue four-door sedan. It was equipped with disc front/drum rear brakes which were stan- dard equipment for that year and model. The tires used in all tests were the HR78-15 polyest- er, steel-belted radial tires provided with the vehicle. To minimize the chances of injuring the ani- mal when it struck the instrument panel (I.P.), the vehicle was modified by removing all knobs and controls in front of the middle and right front passenger's positions. A foam insert was installed on the right-hand two- thirds of the panel which provided a flat, energy absorbing surface. The right front door of the vehicle was re- moved and a frame of one- inch square steel tub- ing for mounting the side camera was fabricated. It was mounted to the door hinges and latched to the B-pillar. The framework extended outboard about two feet. The rear seat and floor covering were remov- ed from the vehicle and a reinforced tubular steel pylon was fabricated and installed in the rear seat compartment behind the right front pas- senger's position. This pylon was used to mount the animal tether system and a forward facing high speed camera. The tether support was align- ed above the centerline of the right front pas- senger's bucket seat and was adjustable in the fore-* aft*, and vertical directions. The animal tether consisted of four tape loops attached to the animal's thorax with adhe- sive tape and a nylon cord harness. The cord was attached to the loops with tautline hitches so that their joined length could be adjusted. The cord, when held vertically, supported the ani- mals as shown in Figure 2. The free end of this supporting cord was tied to a 1.5 inch long, 0.25 inch internal diameter, flanged linear bearing. This bearing was free to slide on a hardened rod in the end of the tether support bar. The sup- port bar and cords of the tether were adjusted to locate the animal at the desired distance from the I. P. An alligator clip was used to hold the teth- er bearing in place during the acceleration phase of the test. Just prior to braking, the driver pulled the alligator clip off the bar with a cable attached to the clip. At the onset of braking the inertial forces on the bearing caused it to slide off the bar, releasing the tether. This arrangement worked well in all tests and in none of the films does there appear to be any alteration of the animal's kinematics due to the release mechanism. ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTATION - Electronic instrumentation provided for the hard braking tests included measurement of brake initiation time, vehicle velocity, braking time and braking distance. Associated with the brake initiation was a strobe flash to identify the start of brak- ing on the cinefilms. The instrumentation system was initiated by the driver. Upon the start of hard braking, the rise in brake fluid pressure closed a switch that 1) started an elapsed time</page><page sequence="4">3656 R. L. STAŁNAKER, ET AL. FIGURE 2. SUBJECT SUPPORT TETHER clock, 2) started the fifth wheel instrumentation, 3) activated the event marker on the chart record- er, and 4) flashed the strobe light for visual marking of the high-speed film. The vehicle's fore-aft acceleration was measured with an accel- erometer mounted on the passenger side front door pillar and the amplified accelerometer output was recorded on the strip chart recorder. PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION - Photographic documentation of the tests was provided by two high-speed, on-board cameras, a real time, off- board camera which panned the braking event at 24 frames per second, and a 35 mm slide camera which documented the animal's position before and after the test. The high-speed cameras were Photosonic model 16 mm - IB' s that ran at 200 frames per sec- ond. Since the tests were normally run under bright sunshine, precautions were taken to prevent reflection and to reduce photographic contrast in the camera field of view. Auxiliary, fill-in lighting was installed behind and on both sides of the passenger location to illuminate normally shadowed areas under the I. P. ANIMAL PREPARATION - Since this study re- quired that unrestrained, anesthetized animals would be propelled against the I. P. in response to hard braking, the animals wore specially de- signed helmets and neck collars. Three helmets of similar construction were used. Each helmet consisted of a hard, puncture resistant outer shell with a custom-fitted, shock absorbing, foam inner liner. A full, clear acrylic shield was attached to the outer shell and covered the face. Helmet 1 was used in the first few tests; how- ever, a slight interference between the face shield and face was noted. Helmet 1 was modi- fied to allivate this interference and the modified version was called Helmet 2. Helmet 3 was a lighter weight helmet and was used in only two tests (Tests 16 and 17). Pertinent geometric and inertial characteristics of the three helmets are given in Table 3. A "foot- ball neck ring" of two-inch diameter polymeric foam was shortened and attached to all the hel- mets using Velcro strips to prevent neck injury. Two types of special braces were used in some of the tests in an effort to simulate pas- sive muscle reaction. The first type was balsa wood splints taped to the lateral aspects of the knee joint (Figure 3). This splint kept the knees straight to simulate a child's posture and lessen the magnitude of the tether support force. The splints were designed to prevent the knees from bending while standing, but were easily brok- en when the baboon began to move forward in re- sponse to the braking action. These splints were used in tests 19. 20, 21 and 34. FIGURE 3. SUBJECT IN LEG BRACE A back/hip brace (Figures 4 and 5) was de- signed to diminish slumping of the back and flex- ing at the hips when the body tether was released. It was thought that this brace would allow the baboon to slide forward on the seat rather than slump and roll forward upon deceleration. The braces were attached to the animal with gauze</page><page sequence="5">HARD BRAKING 3657 tape placed around the hips, legs and lower ab- domen. The back support of the brace was attach- ed to the animal with an elastic bandage wrapped around the abdomen and lower chest. The flexi- ble bandage allowed the animal to breath norm- ally. This support system was used in Tests 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34. FIGURE 4. BODY BRACE FIGURE 5. SUBJECT IN BODY BRACE PRETEST ANIMAL PREPARATION AND EXAMINAT ION S- Two female baboons were used during the study. Their numbers were 2X137, weighing 14.7 kg, and 2X131, weighing 14.3 kg. Each animal was given a complete pretest physical examination including X rays and blood chemistries to ascertain its health status. The results of all tests were found to be normal for each animal prior to the braking experiments. Since positioning the ani- mal was a prime consideration for the study, it was necessary to amputate the tail and control the activity of the es trous cycle to provide human-like buttocks. TEST DAY ANIMAL PREPARATION AND EXAMINA- TIONS - On the test day a general physical ex- amination was made by the veterinarian to check the health status of the subject. The entire hair coat was clipped from the baboon to permit ease in handling. The weight was recorded and radiographs were taken of the entire body. An infant diaper with an absorbent pad and plastic liner was placed on the baboon and changed as required. After the animal tether was attached, the animal was dressed in denim overalls and cotton socks. The subject was transferred to the test site where it was fitted with the helmet de- scribed earlier and positioned in the test car. After each test run, the baboon was examined by the veterinarian for injuries and to evaluate the level of anesthesia. The baboon was allowed to stablilize from the test before the anesthesia level was adjusted for the next test. After the day's testing was completed, the baboon was returned to the laboratory at SwRI for evoked response testing. The animal was then given a physical examination and full body radio- graphs were taken before it was returned to its cage. ANIMAL ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA - The fol- lowing drugs were used to provide the desired level of anesthesia and analgesia. Ket amine Hydrochloride (KetasetR) was used to provide the basic anesthesia and immobilization. This drug is classified as a dissociative anesthetic and has proven to be very effective in baboons. A dose of 10 mg/kg given intramuscularly has a rapid onset (4 to 6 minutes) and persists for 30 to 40 minutes. Acetylpromazine maleate (Acepro- mazine^") , a potent neuroleptic agent, was used to produce central nervous system depression in bab- oons (1 mg/kg) and acts efficiently in combina- tions with Ketamine HCl. Pentazocine Lactate (Talwin^) is a strong non-narcotic analgesic that works effectively in baboons (1 mg/kg). Sodium Thiopental (Pentothal ) , a short duration barb- iturate anesthetic, was used to produce light to general anesthesia at doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg when given intravenously. Atropine sulphate, an anti- cholinergic drug was given, to control secretions from respiratory mucous membranes. The dose rate was 0.04 mg/kg in baboons. These drugs were used in combinations to ob- tain the desired anesthesia. Pretest, the level of anesthesia was sufficient so that the animal would maintain the desired posture until the hard braking event occurred. This usually required the animal to be immobile for 2 to 5 minutes.</page><page sequence="6">3658 R. Ł. STAŁNAKER, ET AL. The baboon was constantly observed by the veter- inarian during the test day to monitor the level of anesthesia. The veterinarian administered drugs when needed to accomplish the desired anes- thesia for each particular situation. TEST CONDITIONS - The hard braking tests were performed with a mean initial vehicle speed of 52.2 km/h (32.4 mph) . The actual vehicle speeds varied from 45.2 km/h to 57.8 km/h (28-36 mph) with standard deviation of 2.4 km/h (1.49 mph). The tests were run at two sites; both were paved with asphalt ic concrete. Weather conditions for the tests were typi- cally clear to partlv cloudy skies with a tempera- ture of 31. 9°C ± 4.8 C (89.4° ± 8.6°F). Except- ions to this are Tests 19-22. Tests 19-21 were run on pavement that had partially dried after a rain earlier in the day. Test 22 was run on wet pavement and was unacceptable. The tests were performed with the front seat in either the full forward or full rearward locked seat positions. Intermediate positions were not used since the project objective was to establish the limits of the possible trajectories. Four front seat configurations were used to evaluate the effects of seat hardness and seat covering materials on the surrogate kinematics. Two bench seats were used in three test configurations; one was covered with vinyl, one covered with a "Doe- skin" cloth, and one covered with "Doeskin" with a leather overlay. A bucket seat covered with leather was the other seating configuration used. All seats and coverings were supplied by GM. The test animals were positioned in the car in one of 13 various sitting, kneeling, or stand- ing positions reported in a survey conducted ' for NHTSA in 1980 (7). These same positions were also reported by the Japanese in their survey of 2,074 automobiles with children under the age of eight on the front passenger seat (5). These typically observed positions are number coded and shown in Figure 6. Some positions were repeated in the full forward and full rearward seating positions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION SUMMARY OF BRAKING TEST RESULTS - A summary of the results of the vehicle kinematics is given in Table 2. The reported vehicle speed prior to braking and the vehicle stopping distance were read from the fifth-wheel display recorded on the high-speed film. Vehicle stopping time and aver- age deceleration were taken from the deceleration- time traces (Figure 7). The stopping time was defined as the time the deceleration curve rose above the zero line more than 0.14 g for more than 0.10 second, and the first time the deceleration curve crossed the zero acceleration line. The results of the subjects' kinematics are given in Table 3. This table is ordered with re- spect to the subject's initial position as shown in Figure 6. Various major factors affecting the subject's kinematics are given in this table e.g. vehicle seat position, seat material, helmet type, body supports on the subject, initial chest- to- 1.P. distance, vehicle kinematics, etc. &lt;9^ CHILD PANIC BRAKING TEST ^ MATRIX POSITIONS ' N- 1.

SUBJECT POSITIONS An I. P. near zone was defined as the space between the I. P. surface and a locus of points de- scribing a surface 100 mm from the I. P. surface. This zone was chosen for analyzing the animals kinematics because passenger inflatable restraint system tests conducted by GM have shown that the interaction forces between a specially instrument- ed, three-year old child dummy and a deploying cushion were significant when the child dummy was within 100 mm of the I. P. at the time of deploy- ment. The high-speed films were anlayzed to de- termine the time at which either the animal's head or torso came within 100 mm of any portion of the I. P. Results are summarized in Table 3. The times were read from the elapsed time clock showu on the film. In addition, the vehicle speeds at these times were calculated and recorded. The cumulative times that the animal's head, torso or both were within the 100 mm zone were also deter- mined for three periods following the start of braking and are listed in Table 3. Three time periods were chosen for calculat- ing cumulative times. The first two periods began with the start of braking and lasted until either the car stopped or 2.0 seconds, whichever was shorter. To complete the analysis of the animal's re- sponse to hard braking, a: sequence of high-speed film frames was printed that illustrates represen- tative samples of its kinematics.

In addition to the animal test results, Table 3 contains observations made for hard braking tests conducted with a three year old child dummy. It should be noted that the child dummy test results noted as "GM" were obtained from SwRI analysis of test films supplied by GM, and the results denoted as "HA" were data extra- cted from Takeda's paper (5). It was inferred from Takeda's paper that the dummy's head entered the I, P. zone first and that the dummy's kinema- tics were similar to the other dummy tests. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS - Some test conditions which were thought to be constant throughout the test series did, indeed, vary and had large in- fluences on the animal's time to reach the 100 mm zone. The most significant of these test condi- tions were the rate of onset of the vehicle de- celeration, the vehicle deceleration level, the initial position of the animal's head, and the degree of support provided by the body tether. The initial phase of the vehicle decelera- tion was found to have different rates of onset. In some tests the brakes were applied more slowly than in others, resulting in a longer time for the subject to begin to move. In still other tests, the brakes were applied momentarily, re- leased, then reapplied, resulting in quick onset</page><page sequence="8">3660 R. L. STALNAKER, ET AL. TABLE 3.

The tests were conducted on two different roadways. Tests 1-18 were conducted at Site land Tests 19-41 were conducted at Site 2. While the initial vehicle velocities were compatab le between the two sites (52.5 ^ 2.4 km/h for Site 1 and 51.9 * 2.5 km/h for Site 2), the mean vehicle deceler- ation levels were quite different (0.63 * 0.16 g vs 0.80 * 0.03 g) even though both roadways were paved with asphaltic concrete. This difference in deceleration obviously influenced the time re- quired for the animal to reach the 100 mm zone. This influence is discussed in detail later in this paper. The initial head position of the subject was observed to be tipped forward in some tests and tipped backwards in others. Since the head is the first major body part to enter the 100 mm zone in all tests, its initial position had a great effect ôn the time to reach the zone. The body support provided by the tether also varied from test to test. This variation of tether support changed the subject's sitting height and the body center of gravity location relative to the vehicle seat cushion. This, in turn, changed the time for the subject to begin to move forward. The time to the 100 mm zone was shorter when the subject was held high in the seat with the body center of gravity high, as would be expected. ANALYSES OF FACTORS AFFECTING TIME TO REACH 100 mm ZONE - To provide a basis for analysis of the kinematic data, one can assume that the time, t, for the subject to reach the 100 mm I. P. zone is dependent on the subject's initial distance from the 100 mm zone, x , and the mean vehicle deceleration level, A, řrom the start of braking until the subject reaches the 100 mm zone. Di- mensional similitude requires the following re- lationship between these variables: x % c = K A (1) where K is a proportionality constant. The value of K is dependent on the influences of other var-r iables, such as seat cushion padding and trim, the type of surrogate, etc. These dependencies of K allow its use to assess the effect of these parameters on the time to reach the 100 mm zone. Figure 8 shows the experimental data plotted according to the relationship given by Equation 1. The ordinate is the time for the subject to reach the 100 mm I.

Lin- ear, least square fits for specific groupings of the baboon and dummy data are shown. All of the data from the baboon tests were grouped to deter- mine the least square fit with the exceptions of the three static tests (Runs 23, 25 and 29),; the four tests where primary data were lost (Runs 19, 20, 21 and 22); and three tests where a back teth- er was used (Runs 37, 28 and 39). The data used to determine the least square line for the dummy included all the tests in which the dummy slid on the seat cushion (Runs HA-2, HA-3 and GM-21). Dummy tests GM-10, GM-22 and HA-1, all in Position 2, were not included since the dummy did not slide, and, therefore, the dummy's response was more like the baboon, as indicated in Figure 8. Also, dummy test SwRI-1, Position 4, was not used in any analysis because the dummy did not slide or bend, but tipped over. This motion was unlike any of the baboon or other dummy tests. The least square equations of the data are: ~~x "1 15 t = 1. 359 ^ + 0.014; r = 0.850, (2) for baboons, and rxp t= 2.08 y- + 0.130; r = 0.996, (3) for sliding dummies. The ordinate intercept, 0.014, in Equation 2 closely approximates zero and can be ignored. The correlation coefficients, r, of 0.850 and 0.996 indicates good fit to the data. Equations 2 and 3 were used to determine if other parameters influence the time for the sub- ject to reach the 100 mm zone. The constant, K, was calculated for each test by the formulas: rA&gt; I K = I for baboons, (4) L 'J K = 130) dummies. (5) The variations in the calculated values of K for each test were used to determine if stati- stical differences exist in various subsets of data. COMPARISON BETWEEN TEST SUBJECTS - As noted in the Animal Species Selection, the two baboons were picked to be as identical as possible. Vari- ations of several of the most important anthropo- metric measurements between the two animals were: body weight - 2.8% difference; stature - 0.6% dif- ference; and sitting height - 4.5% difference. Of the other measurements listed in Table 1, 63 percent of the measurements had a difference of less than 5%, 84 percent had a difference of less than 10% and 100 percent of the measurements were found to have a difference of less than 15%. These results indicated that the two subjects can be considered anthropometrically equivalent. The kinematics of the two animals were com- piled using the individual proportionality con- stants calculated by Equation 4. A t-test of the means of the two sets of data resulted in a t- value of 0.26 (p&gt;0.5). This implies that there was no difference in the kinematics response due to animal variability. The calculation of con- stants were restricted to test results on vinyl seats. Furthermore, the test results using braces were excluded since braces were not used uniformly between the animals. The Position 2 dummy tests in which the dum- my rotated forward like the baboon were compared to all the baboon tests in position 2. Based on the results of the t-test of the calculated pro- portionality constants, there was no kinematic difference between the dummy and baboons for this position (t = 0.17, p&gt;0. 5) . This result agrees with the data for those tests plotted on Figure 8. Next, the Positions 5 and 2 dummy tests in which the dummy slid forward were compared to the baboon tests conducted in Position 5. The bab- oons in Position 5 rotated forward about the hips instead of sliding forward like the dummy. The result of this comparison indicated that there was a statistical difference in the times requir- ed to reach the 100 mm zone due to the difference in the kinematic behavior between the dummy and the baboon (t = 7.50, p&lt;0.05). To summarize, if the dummy is set on the front edge of the car seat with its feet on the floor and its head close to the 100 mm I. P. zone, its kinematics are much the same as the baboon. It the dummy is set back from the edge of the car seat with its feet off the floor and its head well back from the I. P. zone, it will slide forward and not rotate at the waist like the baboons. This difference in kinematic behavior will result in the dummy taking longer to reach the 100 mm zone than the baboon. COMPARISON BETWEEN REARWARD AND FORWARD SEAT POSITIONS - For this comparison, the animal data were grouped according to forward and rearward seat position and proportionality constants were calculated. The result of the analysis indicated that there was no difference between the rearward and forward seat positions which was not account- ed for by the initial distance from the 100 mm zone and the car deceleration level (t - 0.66, 'p&gt;0 . 5 ) . However, there was a difference in kinema- tics after the animal entered the 100 mm I. P. zone for the two seat positions. In all cases where the seat was in the forward position, the animal was in the 100 mm zone for a maximum time. With the seat in the rearward position, the time in the 100 mm zone was determined by the way the animal hit the I. P. When the animal's initial position was close to the 100 mm zone, the animal stayed against the I. P. throughout the braking. When the animal was initially back from the 100 mm zone, the animal fell to the floor under the I. P. and out of the zone. In analyzing the time to the I. P. zone as a function of the seat posi- tion, it was seen that the animal's posture af- fected this time greatly. For example, the dif-</page><page sequence="11">HARD BRAKING 3663 ferences in times that it took the animal to reach the 100 mm I. P. zone with the seat full forward were 0.097, 0.072 and 0.045 seconds, respectively, for the initial sitting Posi- tions 4 (Tests 8 and 12), 6 (Tests 9 and 14), and 7 (Tests 11 and 15). EFFECT OF SEAT CUSHION MATERIALS - Four types of seat cushion materials were used in the tests; vinyl, "Doeskin" cloth, "Doeskin" with a leather overlay, and leather. Only one test was conducted using "Doeskin" with leather overlay and was not included in the statistical analysis. Also, the tests in which the animal wore braces were not used in the analysis. The remaining animal tests were grouped according to seat mat- erial, and the proportionality constants for each type of seat cushion material were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) . This analysis gave an F = 0.12 (p&gt;0.5) which implies that no significant difference existed in the animal's kinematics due to the differences in the three seat cushion materials up to the time when the animal reached the 100 mm zone. This result is consistent with the observation that the animal did not slide forward on the seat cushion, but always tumbled forward toward the I. P. COMPARISON BETWEEN SUBJECTS WITH AND WITHOUT BRACES - Two types of braces, "Knee Splints" and a "Hip and Back Brace", were used in some tests in an effort to simulate passive muscle reaction. Due to a lack of comparative data, a statistical comparison between animals with and without bra- ces could only be made for the "Hip and Back Brace" tests. A t-test was run on the propor- tionality constants for these two groups of tests. The result of the analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in the times to reach the 100 mm zone for the two groups of data. A subjective analysis was done on the ani- mal's time to the 100 mm zone and the kinematics observed from the high-speed films. Based on this analysis, the following conclusions were reached. The leg braces produced no effect on body kinematics for subjects in Position 1 or 7. The hip brace made no difference for Position 2 or 5. In position 6, a difference was seen in the initial sitting position with the hip brace which may have resulted in the shorter time to the I. P. zone. However, the overall kinematics were not significantly affected by the hip brace. The implications of the statistical and sub- jective analyses are 1) the "Hip and Back Brace" did not provide sufficient resistance to prevent upper torso rotation of the baboon and consequ- ently did not affect the time to reach the 100 mm zone, and 2) the "Knee Splints" had no influence on the animal's kinematics. EFFECTS OF UPPER TORSO RESTRAINT - To fur- ther investigate the influence of muscle tensing on the animal's trajectory, three tests (Tests 37, 38 and 39) were conducted where the baboon was in Position 5 and its torso was restrained by a constant, rearward-directed tether force. With a constant 22 N (5 lbs) tether force, the time for the animal to reach the 100 mm zone was 0,376 seconds. When the resisting force was in- creased to 44 N (10 lbs) , the time increased to 0.676 seconds. For: comparison, it took the un- tethered animal wearing the hip and back brace 0.388 seconds to reach the 100 mm zone (Position 5, Test 30). In both of these tethered tests and the hip and back braced test, the animal tra- jectories were similar to the unrestrained animal trajectories in that the torso rotated about the hips prior to the animal's hips moving forward relative to the seat. In the third test, the tether force was in- creased to 60 N (13.5 lbs). The upper torso did not rotate forward, nor did the animal slide for- ward during the braking event. The minimum seat "friction" force required to prevent the animal from sliding forward was estimated from this test using the relationship: F + F_ = MA seat tether where F ^ = Minimal Seat Friction Force seat ^ F tether = Tether Force = 60 N M = Mass of Baboon and Helmet = 15.2 kg A = Mean Vehicle Deceleration Level = = 0.81 g This calculation gives a minimum seat "friction" force of 60 N required to prevent the animal from translating forward. To develop this force level, the "coefficient of friction" of the seat cushion would have to be greater than 0.4. A static "sliding friction" test was conduct- ed using the "Doeskin" covered seat and the bab- oon. The static "coefficient of friction" was found to bę 0.66 which is greater than the mini- mum level of 0.4 required to prevent sliding. In order for the animal to resist upper tor- so rotation and slide forward instead of tumbling forward in response to the hard braking action, the animal must generate a muscle reaction equal to the product of the vehicle's deceleration, its torso and head mass, and the effective moment arm of this combined mass about the hips. Certainly, an unanesthetized animal (or an alert three-year old child) is capable of developing this level of muscle reaction. CONCLUSIONS - There are a number of factors which can affect a child's response to hard brak- ing. If the child is aware of the impending braking action, he could tense his muscles. Since the maximum deceleration due to hard braking is less than one g, the child could maintain an up- right posture and slide forward on the seat, similar to the child dummy. If the deceleration is low enough (less than the static seat "coef- ficient of friction") , the child may not move to- wards the I. P. at all. On the other hand, if the child is unaware of the impending braking, he may or may not tense his muscles in response to the braking action. If he does not tense his muscles, the child's kinematics would probably be similar to the anesthetized animal's kinematics; his tor- so would rotate about his hips and he would tum-</page><page sequence="12">3664 R.

At some point he would develop sufficient muscle action to slow down this rotation and, instead of tumbling forward, his • hips would begin to slide forward. With the seat in the full rearward position, he would probably strike the I. P. with his head instead of rotating past it as did the anesthetized animal. The degree to which the tensed child's hips can slide forward on the seat depends on the mag- nitude of the interaction forces between the seat cushion and the child, and on the magnitude of the vehicle deceleration. Factors affecting the child/ seat cushion interaction are the construction of the seat cushion, the child's clothing, and the distribution of the child's weight on the seat cushion. For example, if the seat cushion is quite stiff and flat, then the frictional charact- eristics of the seat covering material and the child's clothing will influence the degree of sliding. However, if the seat is "soft", the child will deflect the seat cushion padding in re- sponse to braking. In this case, the resistance to the hips moving forward relative to the seat will be much greater, masking the frictional char- acteristics of the child's clothing and seat cov- er material. This "plowing" resistance could be large enough so that the hips would have to move upward, out of the seat cushion, prior to moving forward in the car. The distribution of the child's weight on the seat cushion can affect his kinematics. For example, if the child is sitting rearward on the seat with his legs extended out in front of him, his weight will be distributed over a large seat contact area. This posture will tend to reduce the effect of the "plowing" resistance for a given seat cushion design. On the other hand, if the child is sitting against the seat back with his legs drawn up to his body, he will concentrate his body weight on a much smaller area. For this pos- ture, the "plowing" resistance will be high. Also, since his feet are close to his hips, he will probably rotate about his feet instead of ttans- lating forward. Muscle tensing will have no in- fluence on his kinematics for this sitting posture. A similar kinematic response would probably occur if the child was sitting sideways against the seat back. The child's torso and head would ro- tate sideways about his hips. However, the child could alter his kinematics by placing his hand on the seat to resist the sideways rotation. If the child is sitting on the front edge of the seat, then the time to reach the 100 mm zone will not be dependent on his muscle tone. However, the duration, body posture and position while in the zone will be dependent on muscle re- sistance afforded by his knee joints. SUMMARY - The anesthetized animal kinematics observed with the animal initially sitting upright against the seat back were entirely different than the kinematics of the three-year old child dummy. During the early portion of the braking event, the animal's torso and head rotated about the hips which remained stationary with respect to the seat. When the seat was full forward, the ani- mal's head struck the I. P. and remained against it during the rest of the braking event. With the seat full rear, the animal's head passed near the I. P. without striking it. The animal tumbled to the floor with its back striking the I. P. In contrast, the three-year old child dummy maintained its upright sitting posture and slid forward towards the I. P. Upon striking the panel, the child dummy remained against it until the end of the braking event. Obviously, these different types of kinematics result in different times to reach the 100 mm zone, and various durations and postures of the child surrogates within the 100 mm zone. Tests were performed to determine the influ- ence of simulated muscle tone on the resulting animal kinematics by restraining the animal's torso with different magnitudes of constant, hor- izontal tether forces. Analysis of these tests indicated that the force required to prevent upper torso rotation was within the muscle capac- ity of the animal or a three-year old child. These results were used to conclude that the kinematic response of a child to hard braking will be somewhere between that of a child dummy which is probably representative of a "braced" child and that of an anesthetized baboon which is probably representative of a sleeping or relaxed child who does not tense his muscles in response to the braking action. Data are provided that can be used to esti- mate the time required for a "relaxed" three-year old child to reach the 100 mm zone, and the dur- ations, positions and postures of the child while he is within this zone for a variety of initial sitting positions and postures. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS THE AUTHORS would like to gratefully acknowledge the contribution made by Dr. Gary T. Moore tothis program. His efforts in preparation of the ani* mals and maintenance of proper anesthesia during the tests were invaluable for the success of the project. REFERENCES 1.
