<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Vignettes in E.T.A. Hoffmann's Kater Murr: Portraits of Artists and Lovers Christopher R. Clason Oakland University While E. T. A. Hoffmann is remembered primarily as a creator of fabulous tales, mysterious novellas, and complex novels, he was accomplished in other areas of artistic endeavor as well. Several Hoffmann biographers emphasize his predilection for musical composition as his chief medium of artistic expression, since, if he had had the choice, he undoubtedly would have pursued a primary career as a composer and Kapellmeister.1 Hoffmann also displayed some talent as a visual artist in the numerous drawings, sketches, and caricatures which decorate letters, scrap papers, and the covers of some of his most important literary works.2 When the first volume of Lebens-Ansichten des Katers Murr3 was published in 1819, a vignette of the literary cat on the front cover greeted the readers. This is the first impression one obtains of the feline protagonist and author of the unusual autobiography, which combines the cat's philosophical digressions and personal reminiscence with the fragmentary life story of KapellmeisterJohannes Kreisler via the now (in)famous "blotting-paper" fiction (297-99). A drawing depicting a young man in the midst of a wooded landscape decorates the rear cover. Similarly, the second volume (published in 1821) presents feline and human figures on the front and rear covers respectively. Because these illustrations occupy such prominent positions, one would think that they would merit a good deal of attention by literary scholars. Yet, until now they have elicited only a few descriptions and little analysis in the critical literature on Hoffmann's second novel. Possibly the most important scholarly treatment to date of the vignettes has been Beardsley, although even she gives them no more important a position in her text than as a "kurzen Umweg" in her analysis of Murr.4 In works dealing with visual aspects of Hoffmann's work one would expect to find discussions of these prominent drawings, but this is not usually the case. Cramer investigates some thematic aspects of the text but fails</page><page sequence="2">494 GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW to mention the vignettes at all.5 Lee names the subjects of the drawings and makes only some brief observations concerning the border.6 By means of the vignettes, Hoffmann fuses feline and human characteristics visually, which he also accomplishes verbally on several levels of the novel's text. In the first vignette one encounters the cat on a rooftop, seated at a desk with pen in paw, like a poet or a professor. Clothed in what appears to be a kind of toga, in imitation of Greek or Roman garb, Murr presents a "classical" image. Despite its grotesqueness, the drawing expresses Murr's self- estimation as a model of felinity for his readers, in the same manner that the classical authors of Greek and Roman antiquity served as cultural prototypes for later eras. The locus on the roof bears a great deal of significance, firstly because house cats regularly make the roof one of their customary habitats, and secondly because it provides a kind of objective correlative to the cat's lofty thoughts.7 In the background, the turbulent sky (dark, ominous clouds giving way to celestial radiance) creates an atmosphere of breathtaking grandeur. This phenomenon leaves an impression with the viewer that Murr comprehends nature's elementary and profound secrets, while it visually supports his boastful claim to his own monumental importance. In this essay I will use the term "feline characteristics" to describe those typically feline anatomical features and behavior patterns which humans attribute to cats, whether they reflect the genuine, instinctive behavior of the animal or if they result from the superimposition of anthropomorphic qualities onto the beast. Certain technical aspects of the first illustration weave feline characteristics into the image, and, through parallel lines, shading and framing, emphasize the cat's positive qualities by focusing the reader's attention on them. Murr seems to fix his vision onto something in the upper left corner of the drawing, where the light is brightest, as if he has located an object or entity of great importance there. Hoffmann verifies this possibility through his shading technique in the drawing: the darkest regions lie in the lower right quadrant, at Murr's back, while the brightest point radiates from the upper left corner. Murr clutches the pen (appropriately a feather quill - perhaps the souvenir from an earlier avian meal?), in his right paw. It parallels the line of his perception toward the bright corner, as if it were imbibing wisdom from a celestial spring along this diagonal line for the cat to translate onto the page. Similarly, Murr's large right ear parallels the pen and seems to focus upon sounds emanating from the light source. Cats are known for their ability to discern tones which are very faint to human ears, and Hoffmann exploits this feature to connect sensual acuity to wisdom, wit, and intelligence. The cloud patterns, jagged, black streaks as well as round, dark billows, follow the same directional line and support the connection between Murr and lofty thoughts. On the extreme left and right sides, a church steeple and Murr's striped</page><page sequence="3">Christopher R. Clason 495 tail provide a horizontal balance and a vertical framework for the cat's image. Since Hoffmann employs them for the same logistical purpose, he gives them a grotesque and humorous symbolic equivalence. Indeed, likening a religious institution to a cat's tail must have struck some contemporary viewers of the illustration as blasphemous. However, the harmonious spatial relationship between them also emphasizes the naturalness of Murr's position in his elevated realm on the roof. The tail seems to blend in with the other vertical elements of the drawing as a normal part of the town's skyline.8 Several other important feline characteristics stand out in the drawing. Although the economy with which Hoffmann sketches the roof environment presents the cat in a simple, almost Spartan life-style, and one presumably conducive to Murr's intellectual and spiritual pursuits, a plate of fish appears at the foot of the writing desk. Epicurean, culinary elements find their way even into this portrait of the feline scholar and truth-seeker. The fish may indicate that Murr himself has sketched the portrait: perhaps the plate serves as a kind of signature or as the fulfillment in art of the cat's desire to have enough to eat. The plate of fish does not merely point to sensuality, however, and like most other symbols in the vignettes it functions on a number of thematic levels. Of course, the plate is a round object. Round and circular motifs in the vignettes as well as in the text incorporate the thematic relationship between art and life which Hoffmann symbolizes geometrically as a circle.9 No matter to what extent Murr pursues intellectual and artistic goals (the crowning achievements of human endeavor, in Hoffmann's point of view), he cannot escape the desires and behavioral patterns necessitated by his felinity. As in Kreisler's case, the polar opposition of body and mind engenders in Murr an inversely proportional relationship between artistic accomplishment and physical satisfaction. However, unlike Kreisler, who is caught in his own "Teufelskreis," a vicious circle which causes him to suffer greatly and which threatens his sanity, Murr is quite content in his position. At first, he does not consciously sense the great internal antagonism between the poles, nor does he feel any great need to extricate himself from his circularity. Because his "art" both depends upon and serves his physical desires, and because he never permits higher concerns to take precedence over eating, sleeping or copulating, Murr does not feel any discomfort, anxiety or need typical of those artists pursuing aesthetic goals. Thus, in the illustration he appears with both scholarly robes and a round plate of food, symbols of the intellectual and material realms respectively. These are framed by a church steeple, reflecting the spiritual sphere, and Murr's tail, a visual reminder of the cat's physical, bestial, and instinctive nature, and perhaps even a phallic symbol of his physical appetites. All reflect harmonious equilibrium, without a trace of discord or strain. For millennia humans have considered cats' eyes to be mirrors of the enigmatic wisdom which the animal is said to possess.1I Even Murr's posture</page><page sequence="4">496 GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW in the illustration contributes to the reader's perception that he is a "wise" beast. Hoffmann positions the cat so that the reader receives a head-on view of the feline scholar, and both eyes are clearly visible. His wide-open, piercing gaze shows not only his perceptiveness and understanding, but also his connection to wisdom and learning as a "seer" and "visionary." Since many humans believe that such feline characteristics may represent biological veracity, Hoffmann is able to create an exaggeratedly, even grotesquely intellectual aura for Murr, while preconditioning the reader's sensitivity to the humorous and satirical features of the novel's verbal text. As the reader views this portrait he gains a strong impression of the solitude which the cat-scholar experiences. Romantic authors and their successors sometimes symbolized the lofty and lonely aesthetic realm by housing their artist figures in secluded rooms (Poetenstiibchen) in the upper storeys of buildings (as in the anonymously penned Nachtwachen des Bonaventura). However, that is not precisely the case here. By retreating to his familiar abode on the roof where he pursues artistic endeavors, the tomcat does not completely isolate himself from humans, since it was undoubtedly Meister Abraham who filled the plate with fish. In reality he has probably chosen this vantage point to spy out a rodent or a bird. On the first pages of Murr's autobiography we read the following description of an environment similar to the one presented in the drawing, in which this motive becomes clearer: Uber mir wolbt sich der weite Sternenhimmel, der Vollmond wirft seine funkelnden Strahlen herab und in feurigem Silberglanz stehen Dacher und Turme um mich her! Mehr und mehr verbraust das larmende Gewiihl unter mir in den StraBen, stiller und stiller wird die Nacht - die Wolken ziehen - eine einsame Taube flattert in bangen Liebesklagen girrend um den Kirchenturm! - Wie! - wenn die liebe Kleine sich mir nahem wollte? - Ich fiihle wunderbar es sich in mir regen, ein gewisser schwarmerischer Appetit reiBt mich hin mit unwiderstehlicher Gewalt! - 0 kaime die silBe Huldin, an mein liebekrankes Herz wollt ich sie driicken, sie nimmer von mir lassen (303-4). The reader's image of the Romantic artists' typical dwellings, a commonplace with which Hoffmann's audience was doubtlessly familiar,juxtaposed with the cat Murr and his feline trappings depicted in the drawing, creates a tension which finds its release in humor. And yet, the image of the solitary cat on the roof still seems fitting. An important aspect of this illustration, especially in regard to feline characteristics, demonstrates the appropriateness of Hoffmann's choice of animal in this</page><page sequence="5">Christopher R. Clason 497 solitary role. Humans consider tomcats to be "loners," normally keeping company with others of their kind only for mating or in territorial disputes. Furthermore, they are often intolerant of human presence, although they greedily devour edible gifts which mankind lays at their feet. Indeed, in the novel's text one discovers that Murr prefers solitude. This observation is reinforced through his experience in the Brotherhood of Cats, and through his acceptance of feline companions only when they thrust themselves upon him (making enduring their presence less inconvenient than driving them ofF), or when they satisfy his physical needs. Thus, the first portrait presents contradictory elements which rely upon human preconceptions of cat behavior for their effects. A situation in which Murr does seek companionship is depicted in a vignette on the front cover of the second volume. Here, Murr displays his adroitness in the techniques of courting as he woos Mina,1 1 his daughter (!) from a rendezvous with his former lover Miesmies. The tomcat has descended from the lofty habitat on the roof down to a basement, an abode which corresponds, perhaps, to the "lower," baser desires and passions. Again, human and feline characteristics produce an odd mixture which strikes the reader as humorous. Anyone who has witnessed cats' mating behavior knows that "chivalrous" tenderness has little to do with the process. This observation creates an immediate awareness in the reader of a discrepancy between reality and what the second vignette suggests. Both cats tenderly bow toward one another. Murr, bearing an almost human expression, lightly cradles Mina's paw while he begins to caress her right ear, and she demurely awaits his attentions with closed eyes and a lowered head. Such ritualized behavior would be more appropriate in human sitting rooms, where lovers woo according to exacting rules of etiquette. The inconsistency of expectation and actual content creates a tension which is eased through humor, as it was in the first drawing. As we have seen, in the first vignette Hoffmann employs visual techniques to direct the reader's attention to the cat's great wisdom. Technical aspects in the second drawing reveal other qualities in Murr. His position is now reversed as he looks downward and to the right at Mina. He no tonger gazes out and away at distant and abstract "truth," but focuses on the concrete, physical object of his carnal desire. A barrel stands against the wall behind Mina, while a jug and a plate sit upon a high shelf next to a window. These objects refer symbolically to a feminine presence, because they typically contain sources of life (food and liquid nourishment - mythologically from the telluric "mother" earth), and because their location associates them with Mina's section of the vignette. Unlike the plate of fish in the first illustration, these containers appear to be empty. The lovers need no food, since they are focusing on the satisfaction of their sexual passion, and in their cellar-Minnegrotte they live on love only. The dominant geometric form in the second drawing is the circle. The</page><page sequence="6">498 GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW heads of both cats are round, while the configuration of both bodies and tails taken together suggests a circle. In the right half, the mouths of the barrel and jug and the round plate continue the circular motif. Critics have usually associated circularity only with Kreisler. In the vignette, however, the geometric theme is connected to Murr and Mina visually, and the reader becomes aware of the immediate importance of the circle for both parts of the novel. Symbols and images similarly support Murr's presence in the left half of the illustration. The light beam entering through the window in the upper left quadrant throws its luminescence on the rear wall. The illumination seems most intense at a point on a vertical line (formed by the corner of the room) directly above Murr. The beam grows broader and less intense as one's eye follows from Murr's half horizontally to Mina's half of the basement. As a visible sign corresponding to Murr's sexual interest, the light supports Murr's physical influence, as it spreads itself out over the female feline's symbolic sphere, represented by the barrel,jug, and plate. The luminous source does not represent the "enlightening," distant truth which one found in the first illustration, but rather the transformation of Murr's personal power into sexual energy. Appropriately, Hoffmann does not represent the illumination as a pure source (e.g., the light itself, the sun, a candle, etc.), but rather as a reflection (and symbolically, therefore, as indirect and impure, and less significant than that of the first vignette). Finally, Hoffmann deemphasizes the attributes of wisdom and understanding which he imparted to Murr's sense of vision in the first vignette. The reader can see but one of Murr's eyes, since the cat's gaze is fixed desirously upon his beloved. Although Mina faces the reader directly, both of her eyes are closed as she revels in the tomcat's attention. Because her eyes are not visible, their thematic significance becomes relatively minor. Instead, the tails take up an important symbolic position in the foreground of the drawing. Humans consider the feline tail to be a very expressive organ, which communicates a wide range of physical reactions and emotions. Here, the tails nearly touch, perhaps indicating the promise of an impending sexual liaison between the lovers. A third vignette, on the back cover of the first volume, presents a man in long robes standing amidst a grove of trees. The reader recognizes him as Johannes Kreisler, the Kapellmeister and second protagonist, whom the last few paragraphs of the novel's first volume have located in such an area.12 The geometric form which dominates in this sketch is again the circle. Kreisler stands in the middle of a circular figure which, apparently, a human hand, perhaps Kreisler's own, has drawn on the forest floor. A border forms the circumference and contains the signs of the zodiac. From the pseudo-science of astrology, which straddles the threshold between knowledge and magic, Hoffmann evokes another circular motif, since the signs of the zodiac follow a</page><page sequence="7">Christopher R. Clason 499 circular path through the heavens. In the vignette, four trees and the foliage covering their bases form a second circle in the vignette's horizontal plane (with respect to Kreisler). The focus of this circle lies at the Kapellmeister 's feet, thus yielding another, external and natural circular figure embracing the cryptic, internal and man-made form. The tree trunks, branches, and leaves suggest a third circle in the vertical plane, enclosing Kreisler in a second dimension. In the background many small, circular figures depict a line of trees bordering a body of water. On the thematic level, the reader discerns most immediately Kreisler's embeddedness within circular figures. Kreisler's expression of determination and his stance (his knees are bent) seem to indicate that he is making an attempt to take a step. He holds a long, narrow object (a torch or a kind of magic wand) out and away from his body, perhaps as if he wished to see something beyond the limits of the circle or, possibly, as if he were about to begin a magical ritual. He is reading from a book, perhaps in search of an occult solution to the circular dilemma which ensnares him. But overwhelming, unbearable tension arises from his relationship to the circular environment. The cryptic circle, supported by the arrangement of the tree bases, holds his feet tenaciously, preventing his movement outward from the center. If one considers his stick to be a torch, then it is useless, for it is not lit and casts forth no illumination. If one thinks of it as a wand, then it has apparently little magical effect. It is not raised overhead in a gesture of power but rather lowered at what must be an uncomfortable angle for Kreisler's arm. This linear object must remain in a weakened position, for it is overwhelmed by the dominant, natural, and circular environment. The circle formed by the trees and their tops contains Kreisler vertically, closing in upon him from above and stifling him with amorphous shadows. Nature holds Kreisler firmly in its grasp, and he cannot escape the order which nature imposes. Why, then, does Kreisler appear as a magician? The Kopellmeister has been an apprentice of sorts to Meister Abraham, learning about the relationship between the world of everyday reality and the higher world of art. Doubtlessly he has discovered much from the Meister concerning occult practices, and therefore his magician's pose and attire should not strike the reader as exceedingly unusual. Furthermore, magic is man's attempt through art to delve into nature's secrets, and, by exerting supernatural control over natural forces, to change nature. Kreisler's attempts to enter into an independent and purely aesthetic mode of existence run contrary to the natural order. Therefore, he may be seeking a magical path to transcend the demands which finite and corporeal existence make on the artist. In order that he continue to exist and to compose, Kreisler must sustain his life. In order to obtain the food, shelter, and other necessities required for survival, Kreisler, like many other artists of the Romantic period, depends upon</page><page sequence="8">500 GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW benefactors, such as the Duke at the Sieghartsweiler court or the abbot at the monastery. In return, Kreisler must surrender some of his aesthetic freedom and produce works for the entertainment of dilettantes and courtiers. This is a central problem for the Kapellmeister, for whom only autonomous art is aesthetically legitimate. Even more elementary, however, is the direct confrontation of life forces and aesthetic striving within Kreisler himself. The reader witnesses the circular nature of this conflict in Kreisler's often-cited pronouncement concerning his name: "In diesen Kreisen kreiselt sich der Kreisler, und wohl mag es sein, daB er oft, ermiidet von den Sprungen des St. Veits-Tanzes, zu dem er erzwungen,... hinaussehnt ins Freie" (352). But he never fully escapes, even in nature, as the cover vignette demonstrates. In fact, the "Kreis" problem becomes concretely visible in this drawing. The ineluctable attraction of pure art draws Kreisler constantly onward, while corporeal demands anchor him in a detestable but necessary daily reality. The Kreisler vignette demonstrates that even as a magician he is powerless to overcome natural necessities in his aesthetic quest. Reduced to simple terms, the paradoxical relationship between life and art, as the novel's two protagonists represent it, can be expressed as follows: Murr wants to live well but produces bad art, while Kreisler wishes to create true art but cannot live well. During the course of the narrative the characters find no solution or compromise. Thus, the circle, as Hoffmann employs it in the cover vignettes, represents an existential trap into which both Murr and Kreisler have fallen. But is each character inextricably caught within a circle? Does Hoffmann present a hopeless dilemma without the possibility of solution? Hoffmann does not answer these questions directly, but the novel's structure offers a solution, as some of Hoffmann's critics have maintained. A few of them have argued that Murr's, the editor's, and the printer's errors, which lead to the amazing "zusammengewiirfeltes Durcheinander," actually yield an answer by combining the Kapellmeister 's and the cat's modes of existence.13 The novel's intriguing structure embraces both corporal and intellectual principles, sometimes holding them apart and sometimes permitting them to connect. The vignettes continue this thematic treatment, repeating circular (and other) motifs in the three which I have thus far discussed. Murr's death and the absence of the novel's promised but never produced third volume prevent the reader from further speculation with regard to how Hoffmann may have wished to resolve this issue, if at all. On the back cover of the second volume, the reader encounters the final vignette. In the monastery courtyard a priest holds forth a lighted torch. This, the priest's garments, a crucifix, and the Gothic windows, are the most prominent objects in the drawing, and provide the vignette with visual balance and thematic significance.</page><page sequence="9">Christopher R. Clason 501 The "Nachschrift des Herausgebers," announcing Murr's death and eulogizing the beloved feline, fills the ultimate page of the narrative and therefore furnishes the final contact between the text and the reader before the vignette of the cleric. The sudden news in the "Nachschrift" of Murr's demise has a shocking and saddening effect, and correspondingly the priest's presence evokes a solemn and mournful atmosphere. Although the editor's religious concern regarding the immortal part of this fictional cat might strike one as excessive, it is certainly widespread in human culture that we grieve the loss of our pets. The woeful expression on the priest's face invites the reader to take part in the grieving, as the smouldering torch (providing illumination in the drawing) offers hope for eternal life. The Gothic arches on the window and door of the church contribute to the upward-striving, religious feeling. The circle, the geometric symbol of carnal love in the second Murr vignette and of the life/art dilemma in the Kreisler vignette, is significantly absent. Hoffmann visually communicates the wish that circularity will no longer concern Murr, since nearly all objects in the illustration are linear, emphasizing the cat's final freedom in death from the dualism which informs the novel. Many of Hoffmann's most significant sketches are set inside framing devices, and some of the most consciously meaningful imagery which Hoffmann produces as a visual artist frame the drawings on the cover of the Muff novel. Each of the four vignettes is surrounded by the same arabesquelike border which further develops the themes discussed above.14 Circularity, nature, art, and sensuality are represented by figures from various natural realms of vegetable, animal, and human life. At the very top a regal, portly being, borne by his two attendants and wearing a golden crown, presents the circular theme which dominates the entire border. While he anchors the spatial symmetry of the arabesque (since his place is at the top and center of the frame), his round body sets the tone for the development of the sensual theme, and his almost grotesque corpulence hints that, at least in his realm, art does not require rigid abstinence from food. His countenance and posture reflect amusement and self- contentment. The combination of lordliness, mirth, and grotesqueness reminds one of Shakespeare's Saturnalian nobility, particularly of the "Lord of Misrule." 15 Hoffmann's admiration for Shakespeare surfaces elsewhere in the novel (e.g., in such feline misquotations as "O ATpetit, dein Name ist Kater!" [335]), and in numerous other loci in his works. I The importance this figure holds for the Lebens-Ans.sichten cannot be underestimated, since it contributes another possible solution, that of humor, to Kreisler's and Murr's dilemma. The two attendants, one at each side of the lordly figure, offer him their support. Their nude and muscular forms express sensuality, and their pose suggests a circle. At the bottom of the border, a female image appears, bearing full, round breasts, wings, and animal legs. Two goats accompany her. Through her form and position she simultaneously represents telluric fertility and</page><page sequence="10">502 GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW chthonic sensuality. Her bestial companions are not only associated with the zodiac goat-sign Capricorn, but also "refer to the dual tendencies of life toward the abyss on the one hand, and toward the heights on the other," 17or toward materialism and spirituality. Vinous ornamentation follows a symmetrical, winding path upward along both side panels of the border, while other vines provide curvaceous support for the goats and attendants. The latter seem to spring forth from plants as half-human, half-floral figures. All elements breathe life and sensuality, but they become ordered through a symmetry which the "Lord of Misrule" and his court establish. None of it comes into conflict with the artistic balance which each vignette presents as a whole. There is no tension or artificiality in the border, although strong, procreative images stand out in a carefully orchestrated set of symbols. Life coexists peacefully with art, and in fact the two principles seem thoroughly enmeshed with one another. Thus, the arabesque provides a symbolic answer to the dilemma, and it becomes apparent that art may yield the only solutions for artists in their conflict with life forces: art may provide the sole environment in which the artist can discuss this issue meaningfully. Hoffmann's KaterMurrvignettes visually embrace the novel's thematic complexity while offering aesthetic answers to a perplexing problem. It is difficult to ascertain whether any such solutions are effective in reality outside of the work of art. The problem is still central among artists in the twentieth century. It is not surprising, then, that Thomas Mann, who struggled in his works with the demands of art and life perhaps more than most modem authors, read Kater Murr while planning his own experimental novel Doktor Faustus, which deals in part with the same theme. And it is not surprising that Hoffmann's "zusammengewuirfeltes Durcheinander" has achieved a staggering popularity in recent years,.as numerous new editions and a wealth of scholarly attention attest. Yet, some recent editions lack a reproduction of the vignettes. This is unfortunate, particularly when one considers the important relationship of the vignettes to the text, which I hope to have demonstrated in this essay. As an introduction to the thematic core of the novel, the artwork on the cover of Kater Murrgives the reader important insights, and these portraits of lovers and artists should not be overlooked.
