<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FIRST BOOK OF BUGS. By Margaret Williamson. Franklin Watts, New York. $1.50. 45 pp.; ill. 1949. This book describes various activities of insects that should be readily observed by the children for whom it is intended. Included are crickets and their rela- tives, ants, moths and butterflies, bees and wasps, and other insects. In addition, spiders are included, but as the author specifically states, her use of the term bug is to be taken in the popular rather than in the scientific sense. Although the style is quite anthropomorphic, it must be remembered that this is a book for children who, if interested, can learn the facts of life later. The material is well presented and is supplemented by many attractive colored illustrations. JOHN CUSHING</page></plain_text>
