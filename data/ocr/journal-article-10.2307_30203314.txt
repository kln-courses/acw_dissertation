<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO: THE CASE OF DOS MADRES 1. THE UNAMUNIAN NOVEL AS PROBLEM SOME years ago, Antonio Sinchez Barbudo took issue with the usual philo- sophical approach to Unamuno's novels and urged a new sensitivity to his work as literature: "...lo que mais falta hace son buenos estudios analiticos y cri- ticos de las obras literarias de Unamuno, consideradas estas bisicamente como literatura, como obras de arte, y no simplemente al modo que suele hacerse, como obras filos6ficas y amorfas, sacos cuya forma no importa,..." (12). Granting the element of abstraction in don Miguel's narratives, the eminent Unamuno scholar nonetheless insisted that a surprising number of his texts remain strangely effective, as if endowed with some quality not yet fully under- stood. Abel Sdnchez, for example, may suffer from certain deficiencies such as thin or unidimensional characters, absence of concrete detail, and lack of veri- similitude, but it also possesses many other qualities that make it "come to life" as viable fiction. And in the critic's opinion, La tia Tula is one of Unamuno's truly great works, one for which he even uses don Miguel's own favorite word, "real," in attempting to communicate his sense of its importance: Generalmente, los personajes de Unamuno que no sean personajes secundarios, suelen ser, en todo o en gran parte, simple encarnaci6n de una idea: monstruos que no viven realmente. La tia Tula, en cambio, di- riase que desborda a Unamuno, que se le escapa y sale del libro, y no para ir a enfrentarse con su autor, sino para vivir eternamente en la imagina- ci6n como un ser muy real y muy complejo. (14. Italics mine) In Sainchez Barbudo's view - and there can be no question here of one who identifies with Unamuno -, the presence of a prior ontology, the lack of realis- tic detail, or the reduction of character to a few extreme traits are incidental to don Miguel's achievement as a novelist, for there are other as yet undeter- mined factors which make his works stand on their own as highly effective fic- tions. Although some years have passed since the Spanish critic first made these arguments, they point to a fundamental problem with which Unamuno crit- icism continues to struggle, the difficulty of understanding the representa- tional system of his fiction. There is, we might say, a dimension in many of don Miguel's novels that is effective or compelling in spite of the apparently mal- adroit technique that also often seems present. This dimension is not simply a philosophical or thematic concern within the ideas of the texts but an enigma- tic "something else" that we have difficulty identifying but that appears to be part of the discourse. And though many readers of Unamuno may never have felt the lure of this otherness, those who have do not think of it as merely their</page><page sequence="2">16 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) own personal taste, still less as a vague "no se que" beyond apprehension. On the contrary, it seems there, before our eyes, in the language of the texts; and since terms like "convincing," "effective," or "persuasive" are trite and hack- neyed until made more precise, we want to understand it, as Sinchez Barbudo says, as something literary or discursive. The problem, however, is that we do not know how.' In the pages that follow, I would like to consider this "strangeness" in Unamuno's fiction by attempting to unravel a series of confusions or contra- dictions which I find in his theory of the novel, and then to apply what we learn to the analysis of one of his narratives. It is my sense that, though many of don Miguel's statements about fiction have become well known - even noto- rious - over the years, they have not necessarily been well understood and raise a number of issues that need to be considered with care. To do so in turn raises a thorny problem about which don Miguel himself was concerned, the expectations we bring to our reading of literary works. 2 By clarifying these issues, I hope to work our way into the discursive structures of the novels and begin to identify the representational system that supports them. This implies two stages in my approach, to study Unamuno's theory of the novel and then to consider his actual practice. With respect to the latter, considerations of space require me to limit my analysis to a single work, the short novel Dos madres, from the Tres novelas ejemplares y un pr6logo (1920). The understanding, however, is that the general principles we discover could be applied equally to other works. It should be noted that I am not attempting to defend or attack Unamuno, though neither do I wish to disregard him completely. Some of what I will say will no doubt differ from what don Miguel might have wanted to believe but I take it as axiomatic that authorial intentions cannot govern literary texts because authors are never fully conscious of everything they do. Moreover, in the places where the gap between meaning and intention becomes extreme, it will be possible to consider the implications of the difference. In the end, rather than falling into pro- or contra-Unamuno attitudes, I prefer simply to understand, something that too many readers seem to think was resolved long ago. On the contrary, it is my opinion that in spite of much important work over the years, there are still many areas of don Miguel's writing that have yet to be satisfactorily understood, particularly in the domain of his aesthetic thought. One goal of what follows is to encourage others to see this. 2. THE NOVEL AS RE-CREATION OF MYTH Unamuno's theory of the novel has never been adequately understood because don Miguel himself did not explain it very well and because critics I In his recent Unamuno, narrador, Robert L. Nicholas uses Sinchez Barbudo's words as the point of departure for an analysis of point of view in Unamuno's novels. Whereas my approach is different, Nicholas does show that perspective and voice are far more complex in Unamuno's texts than has usually been conceded. 2 For example, in the prologue to the Tres novelas ejemplares, he lashed out at his critics for basing their understanding of his works on inappropriate "precedentes" or</page><page sequence="3">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 17 keep getting sidetracked by his statements about realism. That he spoke against realism is of course well known, but that he rejected it out of hand is quite another matter. Let us look at his statements but let us also postpone the issue of realism until establishing what he was seeking. In the prologue to the Tres novelas ejemplares, don Miguel dismissed realism as a merely formal concept of art that claimed to represent reality when it really portrayed little more than superficial aspects of life such as dress or speech habits: Verdad es que el ilamado realismo, cosa puramente externa, aparencial, cortical y anecd6tica, se refiere al arte literario y no al po6tico o creativo. [...] Las figuras de los realistas suelen ser maniquies vestidos, que se mue- ven por cuerda y que Ilevan en el pecho un fon6grafo que repite frases que su Maese Pedro recogi6 por calles y plazuelas y caf6s y apunt6 en su cartera. (2: 972) In his view, realists loaded their texts with concrete detail but left us with merely "twilight" characters lacking depth: Y ahora os digo que esos personajes crepusculares -no de mediodia ni de medianoche- que no quieren ser ni quieren no ser, sino que se dejan llevar y traer, que todos esos personajes de que estrn Ilenas nuestras nove- las contemporineas espafiolas [...] no son en su mayoria personas, y que no tienen realidad intima. No hay un momento en que se vacien, en que desnuden su alma. (2: 975) Against this, he proposed a different kind of novel that would eliminate realis- tic detail, concentrate on character, and above all, portray the latter in terms of what he believed to be the most essential dimension of existence, "querer ser," that is, projective being, desire, or creativity. The result was an often pet- ulant insistance that, unlike in the case of realism, his characters were "really real" because represented in terms of reality itself: "Sus agonistas, es decir, luchadores -o si quer is los llamaremos personajes-, son reales, realisimos, y con la realidad mas intima, con la que se dan ellos mismos, en puro querer ser o en puro querer no ser, y no con la que le den los lectores" (II, 972). What these statements fail to clarify is that behind them is a mythopoetical theory of narrative. Following the crisis of 1897, don Miguel proposed that "querer ser" or desire reacts to personal experience by fabricating symbols in the imagination which are drawn from archetypal images in a collective unconscious. ' These symbols pursue their own logic by imposing themselves on the individual consciousness in which they appear and by taking anthropo- expectations: "La pereza mental, el no saber juzgar sino conforme a precedentes, es lo mis propio de los que se consagran a criticos" (2: 971). The question he does not cla- rify is which expectations are appropriate. 3 I have dealt with the philosophical basis of this on another occasion, where I showed how the core of Unamuno's thought turns on a largely implicit theory of imag- ination, symbol, and myth as the key to both his existential understanding of life and his approach to art.

Because they originate in desire, the myths are not literally true but function as an exemplification of some deeper human need, therefore stand- ing as "poetic" or analogical forms of truth which, though unverifiable in a rational sense, are valuable as explorations of "universal" concerns important to mankind. And since they can be conceived as poetically true, a fairly simple play on words permits don Miguel to call them "really real," an idea he re- peated at every opportunity. Myth is, in effect, a fictional reality in the sense of being a poetic intuition of some human truth. Such ideas are very little dif- ferent from the major humanistic tradition of myth commentary since roman- ticism, and though carrying a strong epistemological element - the concern for fictional truth-, they remain eminently compatible with archetypal theory such as espoused by Durand, Frye and others.4 Given this foundation, one can readily see how most of Unamuno's other concepts of fiction are part of the same orientation. For example, if narrative is an exemplification of archetypal patterns of existence, ordinary human expe- rience is less significant than "archaic," "primitive," or "instinctive" levels of life, which thereby become the center of narrative focus. An author is less in- terested in observing the world around him - although this is not excluded - than in seeking to intuit within himself the elementary forces of desire that constitute the often secret motive of existence. This is why Unamuno said that in order to be a novelist, one did not need to observe the world but to "excite" it, that it, to provoke it into revealing its hidden, repressed dimensions so as to meditate deeply on the strange visions one will begin to see: Si quieres crear, lector, por el arte, personas, agonistas trigicos, c6mi- cos o novelescos, no acumules detalles, no te dediques a observar exterio- ridades de los que contigo conviven, sino tritalos, excitalos si puedes, quierelos sobre todo, y espera a que un dia -acaso nunca- saquen a luz y desnuda el alma de su alma, el que quieren ser, en un grito, en un acto, en una frase, y entonces toma ese momento, m&amp;telo en ti y deja que como un germen se te desarrolle en el personaje de verdad, en el que es de veras real. (2: 975) The meditator thinks about the experience and begins to envisage fictional characters, symbols that develop on their own into characters in stories, that is, myths on collective longings, needs and truths. But if the imaginer develops the symbols, a key to the whole process in Unamuno's conception was to avoid interference from the conscious mind so that the symbol could tell its own story rather than any that consciousness might wish. Consciousness, he thought, does not understand the meaning and implications of the symbol. It represses, distorts, modifies, or even thinks it can improve upon the workings of the unconscious and therefore tends to inter- vene in the telling of the story. Believing that such intervention is never pos- itive, don Miguel developed various ideas oriented toward eliminating con- 4 In reference to Unamuno, see Valdes. Be it noted in anticipation of what follows that my approach is not archetypal.</page><page sequence="5">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 19 sciousness from fiction. The concept of the autonomous character, for exam- ple, responds to this situation, and just as he criticized Cervantes for trying to interfere in the mythical impulse of Don Quijote, so too in Niebla he showed a fictional author (ironically named Unamuno) struggle with his character, Augusto Perez. The same tendency lies behind the concept of "oviparous" ver- sus "viviparous" writers. The former are realists who observe the external world and build their works through careful documentation; the latter are self-intui- ters who explore the workings of their own unconscious by letting symbols form themselves into myths. Unamuno, of course, preferred the "viviparous" or intuitive writer, who lets the symbols "do their own work," so to speak. His goal was to write "a lo que salga," without thinking, so as to prevent conscious- ness from interfering in the process of mythification. Such ideas describe Unamuno's theory about the genesis and composi- tional practices of the myth-oriented author. They also led him to an abiding concern for the mystery of creation, that is, the making of something real or existent from nothing, which is when the symbol achieves the status of myth. One of its major examples in his work is the figure of God, who was imagined and even created by man as creator of the universe in expression of the need to believe in a final purpose to life. Equally important and perhaps more so for fiction is the figure of Jesus Christ, whose story constitutes a kind of meta- myth or myth-about-mythmaking on which even God depends. Thus, in don Miguel's vision, the texts of the New Testament show Christ as a man who took up and taght the Old Testament myth about God for the purpose of helping mankind live with the hope of an ultimate purpose beyond death. However, since Christ knew that this mythical God was imaginary, he secretly doubted his reality. But since to admit these doubts would have undermined the hope he was trying to give others, Christ tried to obscure his insecurity by going so far as to permit himself to die for God, that is, to be sacrificed to the myth as proof of his faith in the power of the creator to save him. Unamuno also insi- nuated that Christ may have been trying to convince himself - despairingly - that God might actually be there beyond death. In any case, this act contri- buted decisively to the real creation of the myth, for by sacrificing himself without declaring publicly that God is a fiction, Christ became a historical fi- gure in the sense of generating followers whose stories about his life became new myths articulating collective values that have had a significant influence in history. The story of Christ, repeated collectively in the New Testament, stands as the fundamental myth in terms which the values of the West have been played out historically, while at the same time it reveals the essential structure of myth itself, a fiction that is doubted but becomes true. Additionally, since this same pattern can be seen in the Old Testament figure Moses, in Cervantes' Don Quijote, and in Unamuno's own version of the same story, San Manuel Bueno, martir, one can say that all these texts stand as myths about mythification formulating an archetypal pattern about creation repeated across the ages with different historical details. Unamuno's mythopoetical theory accounts for the fairly obvious tendency in many of his texts to use recognizable myths as a referent pointing to psycho- logical and ontological dimensions of human behaviour. If we say that nine- teenth-century realism alludes to contemporary social experience, the Una-</page><page sequence="6">20 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) munian novel relegates this to a secondary role and finds its primary (though, as we shall see momentarily, not its only) referent in intertextual allusions to an array of previous stories serving as the source of symbolic meaning. These intertexts are not intended as obscure references that only a few privileged readers will understand, for Unamuno always resorted to well known stories whose wide recognition already implied a canonical and therefore a kind of mythical status. They include the Book of Genesis, the New Testament, Don Quijote, various plays of Shakespeare and other dramatists, and even many real- istic novels such as those of Balzac, Flaubert, Clarin and others. In general, we can say that don Miguel's turning to myth exemplifies a sig- nificant and still not fully appreciated Spanish contribution to European modernism. 5 Not only was a renewed interest in myth a common concern of modernist writing, but so was the discontinuity for which Unamuno argues be- tween consciousness and the unconscious, author and text, intention and act, in short, the idea of literary autonomy. A modernist perception is equally ev- ident in the characteristic return to "primitive" or "instinctive" levels of expe- rience. And of course it is an unavoidable but typical paradox of modernism that the goal of capturing an unconscious level of "archaic" meaning appears only in a highly conscious practice of literary allusion. As so often in modernist writers, a defense of the primitive is developed in elaborately conscious theo- ries that follow the paths of artifice. 3. FROM REALISM TO ALLEGORY Let us now return to the problem of realism. Though it appears that don Miguel sought to counter realism through myth, the issue is not that simple. In the prologue to the Tres novelas ejemplares, he speaks about the appearance of the symbol in texts. Having just affirmed that the "really real" element of things is that which is creative in them, he says the following about fictional character: S61o que este hombre volitivo e ideal -de idea-voluntad o fuerza- tiene que vivir en un mundo fenomrnico, aparencial, racional, en el mundo de los llamados realistas. Y tiene que sofiar la vida que es suefio. Y de aqui, del choque de esos hombres reales, unos con otros, surgen la tragedia y la comedia y la novela y la nivola. (2: 974) Unamuno is telling us that the symbol or anthropomorphic image in the unconscious, "este hombre volitivo e ideal," appears as a signified or meaning that takes its signifier or form from the codes of realism, "el mundo de los lla- mados realistas." Narrative is proposed as based on myth, but its encoding sys- 5 I use the term in the Anglo-American sense proposed by Bradbury and McFarlane of a general crisis and change in aesthetic norms throughout European art from the late 1800s to approximately the end of surrealism. It is a separate issue that the meaning of "modernismo" in Spanish is traditionally taken in a different sense. I am preparing a monograph on Unamuno's aesthetics which considers this problem.</page><page sequence="7">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 21 tem remains governed by the limits to which realism adheres, namely, a recog- nizable world of everyday experience, characters with patterns of typical be- haviour, and an overall constraint of verisimilitude. The point is crucial. In spite of his opposition to realism, don Miguel here re-inserts it back into his theory as the encoding system of his texts. In simple terms, the recreation of ancient myths occurs in the contemporary world with contemporary people in recognizable situations. This is consistent with the implication that daily life carries deeper patterns of mythical meaning and it in turn justifies don Miguel's tendency to read certain novels of other authors mythically. Such is his vision of Don Quijote, for example, which he interprets as an archetype on the myth of creativity. And of course, it is also what we find in his own texts, which are mythical tales set in contemporary environments. 6 The retention of realistic codes suggests that Unamuno remained much closer to realism than even he would have liked to admit, a situation that on one level explains why so many readers criticize his novels for their lack of con- cretion or their inadequate verisimilitude. Normally, if we read a novel with the understanding that it is based on myth, we would not criticize it for its lack of realism since it is an elementary rule of any reading experience that a work should be judged in terms appropriate to it: we would put aside the codes of realism and seek the more appropriate signs of myth. But because the encod- ing system of Unamuno's novels is partially realistic, readers receive schematic indications of realistic codes and are then frustrated when there are not enough. By the same token, to recognize the continuing importance of realism in Unamuno's novels allows us to grasp the real implication of his approach to the realistic novel. Contrary to his own statements, don Miguel did not reject realism as such. Rather, he was opposed to one of its late forms, naturalism, which he was seeking to reverse by returning to historically early forms of realism such as practised by Cervantes, Balzac or even Flaubert, all of whom he consistently praises in the pages of the prologue to the exemplary novels. Such a distinction between early and late realisms is in fact legitimate. For example, the contrast Unamuno establishes between the writers he admires and the ones he calls "realists" is remarkably close to Lukacs' opposition between the "true great realism" of Balzac and the insipid version of it produced in the later naturalism of Zola. Like Lukacs, Unamuno deplores documentation and excessive detail, and his scornful allusions to "twilight" characters who are un- able to "bare their souls" reminds us of the Lukacsian distinction between the realistic "type" and the naturalistic "average man." Both writers prefer the for- mer, as exemplified by characters tending toward exaggeration "in the ulti- mate unfolding of the possibilities in them, in extreme presentation of their extremes (6). Of course, Unamuno was pursuing ontological mysteries while Lukacs insisted on socio-historical problems and in this sense, don Miguel has fallen into that very modernism which the marxist critic so much deplored. 6 There is, however, an inconsistency in the fact that don Miguel rarely attributed the same mythical possibilities to nineteenth-century realists in search of symbolic pat- terns that imply a mythical foundation behind them. The probable explanation for this inconsistency is his aversion to most of his immediate predecessors.</page><page sequence="8">22 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) The point, however, is not to suggest that Unamuno was a realist, but that his work retains underlying connections to realism which make it impossible to declare him simply an anti-realist. It was naturalism that Unamuno rejected, and against it he proposed a kind of "purified" realism which would deploy realistic models infused with mythical patterns and meaning. This is also com- patible with recent understandings of modernism, which insist on the degree to which modernist texts function as palimpsests of realistic ones by offering a counter-form whose opposition to realism inevitably depends for their design on realistic codes (Eysteinsson, 179-241). But there is a far more complex point in these considerations. By yoking realism and myth together, Unamuno creates a problem of incompatible codes wich generates a third and different mode of representation. We can see this if we recall that, as Northrop Frye, Mircea Eliade, and other theorists of myth have shown, mythical narrative involves a hero superior in kind to men and their environment, a divine or semi-divine being who participates in super- human events which are proposed as having occurred in a remote past of or- igins and ultimate issues (Frye 33-35; Eliade 6). Precisely because they are ulti- mate, the issues and therefore the characters of myth are not susceptible to directly referential figuration as in realism, which is why mythical narratives are located in a remote, "sacred" time outside our present world. The heroes of myth are symbolic beings whose meaning must be translated or interpreted into ordinary language via the codes peculiar to archetypal figuration. To pro- pose, as does Unamuno, to represent myths via ordinary experience is to argue for a signifier whose relationship to the signified is necessarily artificial or unmotivated because realism was not designed as a mythical referent and in- evitably appears exaggerated or distorted if forced to accommodate such a purpose. As a result of this crucial point, it is my understanding that, in the end, Unamuno's theory of the novel points to neither realism nor myth, neither to the conventions of referentiality nor to those of transcendent mystery, but to a system of signification in which the signified has no intrinsic relationship to the signifier, a system based on an unmotivated or arbitrary linking of its com- ponents, which is to say, allegory. Don Miguel proposes to encode a mythical meaning in the language of realism and therefore ends up with a representa- tional mode that is different from both because it is based not on the unity of signifier and signified but on their difference. Interestingly, Unamuno may well have been aware of this. In the prologue to the exemplary novels, he says: "Pues bien; un hombre, y un hombre real, que quiere ser o que quiera no ser, es un simbolo, y un simbolo puede hacerse hombre. Y hasta un concepto. Un concepto puede Ilegar a hacerse persona" (2: 974-75). He is of course correct as long as we recognize that when a concept becomes a person, it does so alle- gorically. But this immediately creates another difficulty. Even if we had not detected allegory in Unamuno's theory of the novel, some readers would have already intuited it in his practice and for them, this is the problem, not the solution. Ever since romanticism, allegory has been devalued as a form of literary dis- course because, unlike the symbol, it is understood as a mere illustration of abstract ideas and therefore mechanical, artificial, and lacking in feeling. The</page><page sequence="9">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 23 symbol, in contrast, is superior because it is a concrete image that implies but never states an abstract meaning and therefore exists as a deep and abiding unity of form and content whose sense is ultimately ambiguous. To argue for allegory in Unamuno appears merely to solidify the condemnation that has so often been used against him while returning us to the long tradition of philo- sophical interpretations which we said we wanted to avoid. The problem, however, is one of expectations and recent criticism has gone a long way toward clarifying important issues in this area. Allegory has suffered from an unfair prejudice in post-romantic tradition which has tended to limit our expectations about reading it. 7 Responding to the obvious fact that much twentieth century literature is characteristically allegorical (Unamuno is in company here with no less than Kafka, Hesse, Borges, Nabokov, Pynchon, Barth, and many others), critics today question the romantic opposition be- tween symbol and allegory while offering an entirely new perspective. Angus Fletcher has constructed a full theory of the allegorical as a distinct mode no less important than symbolic representation and that permeates many other forms of discourse while existing as a kind of permanent tendency in literature throughout history. Paul de Man has taken this a step further by showing how many supposedly symbolical discourses actually derive from previous texts and are therefore based on artifice and convention, exactly like allegory. De Man's theories have had a major impact on undermining the symbol and encourag- ing others to pay closer attention to allegory. One of the best of these, which I will use further on, is Maureen Quilligan's The Language of Allegoiy, which em- phasizes the ambiguity and subtlety of allegorical language. All these cases ultimately derive from Walter Benjamin's seminal 1925 study on the German baroque trauerspiel or melancholy drama, where the German critic calls for an appreciation of allegory in its own right as a legit- imate representational mode that occurs under certain kinds of historical con- ditions and that develops textual effects which, though different from those of the symbol, are often equally ambiguous and no less authentic or interesting. In Benjamin's perspective, the disjunction between signified and signifier points to an underlying distance or separation felt by the allegorist between the meaning he feels and the means he finds available to express it. Meaning has become problematical because the connection between the sacred and profane is weakened or lost, thereby necessitating an arbitrary or personal sys- tem of signification in order to recover it, always with a deep sense that the recovery is tenuous if not impossible. This provides the genre an underlying apprehension of uncertainty, history and death: "Whereas in the symbol de- 7 To the extent that Unamuno's thought derived from the romantic tradition, he too had tended to perpetuate this prejudice against allegory, as for example in the pages of "El espiritu castellano" in En torno al casticismo (1: 817-822), where he develops a typically romantic contrast between the subtlety of symbolic writing, identified with Shakespeare, and the hard angularity of allegorical writing, which he links to Calder6n. Of course, this text is from 1895 and therefore pre-dates the crisis of 1897, which is the origin of his modernist, allegorical aesthetic. Ironically, however, it does show that don Miguel eventually proposed the very "sin" of which he had once accused the baroque master.</page><page sequence="10">24 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) struction is idealized and the transfigured face of nature is fleetingly revealed in the light of redemption, in allegory the observer is confronted with the facies hippocratica of history as a petrified, primordial landscape. Everything about history that, from the very beginning, has been untimely, sorrowful, unsuccess- ful, is expressed in a face - or rather, in a death's head" (166). Here then, is the modern understanding of allegory: the intrusion of time and relativity into the eternal, the profane into the sacred, the demonic into the divine, and the uncertain into the secure. Allegory seeks truth while being aware of its own artificiality; it penetrates mystery only to discover the unintelligible. It carries an inherent doubleness between appearances and reality, the literal and the figural, which seems always to lead to enigma. The very crudity or obviousness of much allegory cannot even be trusted for it is often a sign of irony, espe- cially in the modern era when the hierarchical authority of the Middle Ages has been lost and the allegorist resorts to older sources of meaning such as the Bible which he already knows cannot provide direction. Thus, a form that used to be perceived as static and closed is now understood as ambiguous and open, far less obvious than the romantics would have believed. To be sure, allegory is artificial, conventional and all the rest, but so is all literary discourse, and there is no reason other than habit for saying that the allegorical is any the less "rich" than other discursive modes if one knows how to read it. In addition, to the degree that the mode has become typical of the twentieth century, it is his- torically significant and deserving of study. It should now be clear where these considerations have been leading. If read with care, Unamuno's understanding of the novel can be shown to reveal a theory of allegory based on the coupling of mythical meaning and realistic language. However, because of an inherited prejudice against allegorical writ- ing in conjunction with the preference for realism in the Spanish tradition, we have tended to think of his works as lacking the subtlety or richness we wish to find in literary texts. On the other hand, more recent approaches point to alle- gory, stress the ambiguity of the mode's language. They also avoid the older demand for realistic verisimilitude or philosophical clarity. What does it mat- ter that the characters of Unamuno's novels are not believable? This is an expectation based on realism and the issue is not what conforms to everyday life (although once the allegory is grasped, reference to the everyday can be- come visible) but the allegorical meaning being proposed. And how can we be certain that this meaning is obvious? That is the assumption of traditional phi- losophical criticism, which almost always overlooked the elusiveness of allegor- ical language. The issue, then, is to open ourselves to a new understanding of allegory's possibilities. If we can do this, we will be studying Unamuno's work in the literary way proposed by Sainchez Barbudo many years ago. Let us attempt this with one of don Miguel's typical texts. 4. Dos MADRES AS ALLEGORY Dos madres is a work whose brevity - some twenty pages in the Obras comple- tas - makes it perhaps seem more like a short story or novella than a full- fledged novel. Such concision was typical of all the works published in the</page><page sequence="11">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 25 years following Niebla (1914), and was integral to the distillation or "purifica- tion" of realism Unamuno was seeking. As Carlos Blanco Aguinaga has said in what is still the best study of this and the other "novelas ejemplares," every- thing in these works is reduced to schema which are, however, "ejemplos del vivir mais cotidiano presentados en situaciones conceptualmente limites" (54). In the case of Dos madres, the reduction is even more extreme than usual in the sense that the work is one of Unamuno's most straightforward and direct, reaching even to a kind of exaggerated crudity. In eleven brief chapters, we are confronted by the story of Raquel, a barren woman who persuades her lover, Juan, to marry and impregnate another woman so that she, Raquel, can steal the baby. And the most striking aspect of this is the ruthless efficiency with which she carries out her goal. Armed with malevolent indifference to any but herself, Raquel announces her objective at the outset, proceeds almost without incident to its realization, and at the end, appears to live "happily ever after" with her stolen infant daughter, who of course becomes "really and truly" her own. Nothing it would appear can stop the all-powerful urge to be- come a mother, which acts like a steamroller crushing everything in its path. Like a steamroller too is the narrative technique. Along with the usual sin- gle-faceted characters, we have a reliable narrator whose frequent and obvious allusions to Biblical stories of sterility and motherhood underline the myth of the maternal instinct that seems to be the theme of the story and leave little to the imagination of the reader. The many metaphors about "burning lips, "arid" or "milkless" breasts, and "dark" or abysmal eyes merely drive this point home in a hyperbolical and overdetermined manner. Whereas dramatic effect is sought through frequent and intense dialogue, the overwhelming strength of Raquel combined with the seemingly contrived weakness of everyone else prevents the kind of dialectic necessary for real dramatic tension and reduces the whole to a one-sided display of the main character's power. Combine all this with the usual absence of concrete detail and we seem to have a compen- dium of the defects about which so many have complained in Unamuno's narratives. What possibly could be of interest in a work such as this? Here is where we need to look at the allegorical factor. That Dos madres is an allegory is apparent from the opening lines: "iC6mo le pesaba Raquel al pobre don Juan! La viuda aquella, con la tormenta de no tener hijos en el coraz6n del alma, se le habia agarrado y le retenia en la vida que queda, no en la que pasa" (2: 978). Life, the narrative tells us, is organ- ized on two levels, one permanent and essential, which we can call the world of being, the other temporal and contingent, which can be called the world of appearances. Being is the signified or meaning-level of the story, and is linked exclusively to Raquel, whose access to it gives her absolute control over the other characters. Raquel understands more about the world than the other characters and appears as a god among men, "superhuman" in her knowledge and control. Appearances, on the other hand, constitute the signifier of the story and comprise the characters, events, and actions of the story, including the acts and behaviour of Raquel when dealing with the world. In general, the world of appearances is a cruelly scornful and highly schematic version of con- temporary bourgeois life emphasizing the development of the family: court- ship, marriage and parenthood. Raquel lives on the two levels of being and</page><page sequence="12">26 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) appearances whereas the remaining characters -Juan, Berta and her parents - live exclusively in the latter: they know nothing of the domain to which Raquel responds and, indeed, do not even become aware of it by the end of the novel when every one of them has been devastated by it. Here we see one of the many paradoxes conveying the doubleness characteristic of allegory. The world in which people live is controlled by a force which the text suggests is their reality but they know nothing about it. Reality is alien or other to the world, a presence whose meaning is arbitrary and mysterious. This is crucial for the novel because it raises the question of whether or not being even exists. Let us consider this in detail by looking at how allegory develops. According to Quilligan, the central issue in allegory is a deep ambiguity between figural and literal levels of the text that is communicated by "the piv- otal phenomenon of the pun, which provides the basis for the narrative struc- ture characteristic of the genre" (33). As Quilligan explains it, allegory has a "tendency to slide tortuously back and forth between literal and metaphorical understandings of words, and therefore to focus on the problematic tensions between them" (67). A pun or double-entendre functioning as a metaphor at the outset of the story will later be shown to be literally true, and subsequent metaphors can then add to or complicate the process as a sequence of shifts, deviations and detours keeps revealing the literal truth of the figural. As this occurs, the process of taking the figural literally can become so dizzying that the reader gradually becomes aware of the "letteral" or verbal dimension of the text. That is, the story comes to appear dependent on language and words themselves eventually become foregrounded in the reader's consciousness as the primary source of the experience, though not necessarily in a way that pro- vides clarity about their meaning. The reader acquires a profound conscious- ness of language as the source of meaning, but meaning itself becomes deeply problematical, as if perhaps now shown to be inapprehensible. In Dos madres, becoming a mother is Raquel's objective at the literal level of the text, which is to say, in the world of appearances. Figuratively, however, one can see another level for which the maternal instinct and sterility are but signs at the surfaces of the drama. As Honig notes, allegory typically provides an ini- tial and emblematic "threshold" scene which establishes the terms for which the rest of the text operates as commentary (71-75). The first chapter of Dos madres serves this function by presenting a conversation between Juan and Raquel in which the protagonist plays on the language of theology. To his offer of marriage she scornfully replies that matrimony exists "seguin nos ense- fiaron en el Catecismo, para dar gracia a los casados y que crifen hijos para el cielo," objectives which her inability to have children prevents them from achieving: "aDarnos gracia? iAy, michino! [...] ni a ti ni a mi nos dan ya gracia con bendiciones" (2: 978). These words will be repeated on subsequent occa- sions, almost as a set phrase which Raquel is mocking. 8 The implication, I 8 For example, at the end of Chapter V. The Obras completas puts the key word in the plural: "iPara casar y dar gracias a los casados y que crfen hijos para el cielo!" (2: 988). The Alianza edition does also (35). In the Austral edition, it is in the singular (52). I have been unable to review early editions or the manuscript to see if we could determine an "original" form.</page><page sequence="13">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 27 would suggest, is a pun on the concept of grace. Rather than seeing children in the stereotyped or habitual manner of society as a "favor" for the parents, she takes the metaphor literally by seeing them as a blessing or gift from God. To be a mother is to accede to a state of grace, something which is impossible for her because of her sterility. The latter thereby takes on the overtones of sin or fallenness. Raquel feels herself guilty of some flaw or failure though she does not know why: "Si, ya s6 que t-i no tienes la culpa, como no la tuvo mi marido, aquel..." (2: 979). And when she tells Juan that Berta is the woman she has picked for him, she turns to the language of redemption: 'Y Berta, que tiene un heroico coraz6n de virgen enamorada, aceptari el papel de redimir- te, de redimirte de mi, que soy, seguin ella, tu condenaci6n y tu infierno" (2: 80). Indeed, metaphors like "redimir," "salvar" and their opposites "perdi- ci6n," "condenaci6n," etc. are constant in her vocabulary and point to an insis- tent play on words that suggests a "supernatural" perspective alien to the other characters, all of whom take her to be exaggerating metaphorically the pain she feels. Thus, where others might consider Raquel's sterility a merely unfortunate circumstance, perhaps the product of chance, for her it has acquired mythical meaning as a structure of guilt and redemption. To be sterile is to exist within a condition equivalent to original sin, as if she has been cast out by God, con- demned to an infernal existence in which hell is "el centro de un vientre est6- ril" (2: 980). And by plotting for the baby she cannot have, she is seeking salva- tion or redemption from guilt. Here, I would say, is the meaning of the story at the level of the signified, "la vida que queda": a mythical recreation of the fall and redemption. This in turn helps us situate the famous theme of maternity more appropriately because it now appears as a signifier that could be re- placed by any other that would convey the underlying pattern of guilt and re- demption. The maternal instinct is less important for what is says about women than for pointing to the existential theme of human finitude. 9 There are important questions here about whether or not this mythical pat- tern really matters in the text, but for the moment we can note that the met- aphors of fall and redemption enunciated in the threshold scene are played out literally in the remainder of the story with, as Quilligan says, dizzying shifts and changes that constantly ask us to consider their implications. For example, shortly before Juan's marriage to Berta, there is a scene in which Raquel gloats about how her control over everyone is about to become complete. When Juan weakly complains at her cruel words, she retorts: "No gimas asi, Juan, que pare- ces un cordero al que estin degollando" (2: 986). This metaphor of a sacrifi- cial lamb can be seen as becoming literally true when he commits suicide at the end of the story. Throughout the work, he is used by Raquel with great indif- ference toward his feelings and he is then discarded by her when she achieves her goal. In effect, she literally sacrifices him like an innocent animal killed as an offering to the gods. 9 I do not of course mean to gloss over of a certain reductionism in Unamuno's view of women, which tended to simplify the feminine by emphasizing the importance of the maternal instinct.</page><page sequence="14">28 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) Berta too is an innocent victim, but rather than being sacrificed, she is led toward a fall or state of sin that will require the same redemption Raquel is seeking to overcome. Thus, for example, Berta is metaphorized as an "angel" who attempts to "save" Juan, that is, wrest him from the diabolical force of Raquel. But this action is also an imitation of Raquel, for it merely tends to repeat the latter's dominance overJuan. Thus, Berta is fascinated by the power Raquel possesses and falls into the "sin" of wanting the same self-knowledge: "se iba descubriendo a si misma al trav6s de la otra" (2: 989). In effect, then, she commits an act of pride leading to guilt and the need for redemption, a situation evident at the end of the story, where she has become the "viuda" that Raquel was at the beginning. Like Raquel, Berta ends up a sinner victim- ized by circumstances beyond her control. The difference, of course, is that we do not know who or what caused the problem for Raquel whereas it is the lat- ter who is the source of Berta's fall. But it is in Raquel herself that we must especially heed Quilligan's warning about the shifts and changes of meaning in allegorical metaphors. From within the tradition of religion, redemption requires that the guilty person submit to a higher authority by admitting responsibility, seeking forgiveness, and under- going penance or atonement in order to restore wholeness. Raquel accepts the need for atonement but she does not recognize personal responsibility, does not seek forgiveness, and does not submit to a higher authority. Rather, in what I take to be a major change in the underlying myth being reworked by Unanumo, Raquel becomes her own redeemer by sacrificing others to her cause. Everything is made to acquire the structure of undeserved guilt that she has suffered in her own life and the world becomes a place of perverted atonement and redemption. And as one might anticipate, the effect is destructive, for Raquel creates undeserved suffering throughout the world and universalizes fallenness for everyone. Described as an "dingel caido" (2: 981) in the thresh- old scene, she thus emerges in a pattern typical of allegory as a kind of satanic figure who raises herself from hell by infecting the world with the arbitrary deprivation she has suffered (Fletcher, 25-69). But the crucial point here is that we are never certain if Raquel actually believes in the myth of guilt and redemption which she forces on others, and it is this that leads to the ambiguity one finds in the text. In the first chapter, when Juan insists that they marry "como Dios y los hombres mandan," she retorts: "JTi5 invocando a Dios, michino?" (2: 979), as if to insinuate either that she does not believe in God or that they have been cast out by God and cannot receive his forgiveness. Overall, she appears deeply resentful or disbelieving, like a person who either hates God for what he has done to her or who is no longer able to accept him. But if there is no God, the myth of the fall is irrel- evant and there would be neither need nor purpose for atonement and redemption. By insisting on it, Raquel lives in a state of "betweenness" in which she forces the patterns of myth on others while lacking the values on which such patterns are based. There is no God but she has not rid herself of the structures of a God-based world. She imposes the mythical patterns of a reli- gious value-system without believing in the system itself. '0 The importance of this point cannot be overestimated. If Raquel does not really believe in the myth, one begins to suspect that her puns are just that,</page><page sequence="15">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 29 word games that point less to a hidden level of being in the world than to her own capacity for manipulation and control of others. In other words, guilt and redemption begin to appear as a game played by Raquel, a perspective that empties the myth of its substance and raises the specter of that "letteral" dimension mentioned by Quilligan. For Raquel, the world of appearances becomes a kind of language whose signs she has mastered and which she uses at will to convert the other characters into puppets to do her bidding. Appearances become a kind of "fiction" that she "writes" for the purpose of fulfilling herself, and the baby she has at the end is but one part of her crea- tion, which also includes the other puppet-characters. The effect of this is often so diabolical that much in the work ends up satirically ironic, as if a supe- rior Raquel were disinterestedly paring her fingernails from Valle-Inclin's "otra ribera" beyond the world while the poor fools on this side were hope- lessly trying to figure out what was happening to them. Such a perspective per- mits us to see a dimension of Dos madres that I believe has been too little appre- ciated, its detached, ironic playfulness. In effect, Dos madres is an exaggerated game played by each character against the others, all of whom are "figures" in Genette's term, verbal constructs with which we are not expected to identify - that would be to adopt a realistic reading - but which we observe as pieces in a series of verbal manoeuvers. Precisely because reality in the novel is an arbitrary idea in which Raquel may not even believe, the text becomes like a self-conscious exercise which, knowing itself founded on words, puts its em- phasis on playing with conventions while at the same time foregrounding words. Raquel disrupts the social conventions of bourgeois marriage and parenthood through a mere game of words. Unamuno's purpose in showing this game is to awaken the reader to the arbitrariness of social conventions and the ambiguous power of language. One could say, for example, that Dos madres takes the form of a mock debate or war - one of the typical narrative structures of allegory - whose significance lies in the debaters' mastery of language. Allow me to study this in more detail by turning to the mechanisms that motivate the plot. Although the plot is very simple, the key to its development is Raquel's understanding of the social and psychological codes of the bourgeoisie. In order to achieve her goal of stealing the baby, she induces the other characters into actions intended to appeal to secret but repressed longings without them becoming aware that they are being manipulated. With Juan, for example, she creates a mother-son relationship which on the one hand makes him depen- dent on her, and on the other, implicitly encourages him to look for a substi- tute "mother" as a way of escaping her dominance. In other words, Raquel deliberately mistreats Juan in order to make him want another woman who would "save" him from her. And of course, this calculated manipulation tends to make Juan more attractive to any woman who feels "maternal" toward men, a situation that pre-selects Berta from among any number of possible other 10 This no doubt approximates Unamuno's own position with respect to religious consciousness: recognizing the silence of God, he cannot however conclude that God does not exist and is unable to abandon mythical categories.</page><page sequence="16">30 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) women. Thus, women who do not relate to men maternally would presumably not be attracted to Juan and the novel, quite legitimately, ignores them. Raquel even plays this game publicity so as to involve Berta's desire to free himself of Raquel and fall into the trap of thinking that they can marry their daughter to a wealthy man by encouraging a mother-son relationship between Berta and Juan. Thus, they too manipulate Juan by talking about him at dinner in front of Berta (2: 981), or, when he occasionally visits them, by delaying their coming into the room so that Juan will be provided apparently casual opportunities to be alone with their daughter (2: 982). Ultimately, they con- spire with Berta to catch Juan, all of which puts the daughter into the role of "mother" to Juan and therefore contributes to Raquel's diabolical plot. In this way, the "mother-son" structure undergoes a kind of diabolical dissemination, like a disease infecting the world of appearance and causing its fall. In the end, the entire plot is generated by launching this simple convention: characters pre-ordained into mother-son relationships whose importance in their own lives they have repressed and which therefore become all the more significant as they fall into the trap. Each attempts to anticipate the others' calculations in order to gain an upper hand and each inevitably falls because of a failure in self-understanding. And the significant point is that Raquel is like the puppe- teer who pulls the strings of the various roles without the least compassion for the players. Moreover, because everything is pre-ordained, our interest in read- ing the text is not the tension of discovering what comes next but the ironic subtleties of the game itself as different manoeuvers reverberate in compli- cated entrapments throughout the world of appearances. In this context, one of Raquel's most extraordinary strategies is what I would call the "truth-dare." That is, we might assume that the most obvious way to manipulate others into doing something we want is simply to lie to them so as to get them to react a certain way. Raquel certainly does this, but she cannot be satisfied with such simple methods and just as often resorts to a bluntly true statement of her wishes which, because it is so direct, makes others think it carries a secret motive intending to make them behave a certain way. Reacting against this, they alter their behaviour by doing something else intended to head off the entrapment, which of course is exactly what Raquel had antici- pated. This has a deeply ironic effect throughout the text by generating state- ments of truth with effects of falsehood, "lying truths" that in turn motivate further lies and deceits. It also provides a constant source of ambiguity over what is sincere or insincere. In the first chapter, for example, Raquel tells Juan that she wants him to marry Berta so that she can have a baby. To this he re- sponds as if offended by asking how she could expect him to love another woman. Her rejoinder is a good example of a truth-dare: "Pero ino se trata de quererla; se trata de emprefiarla! aLo quieres mais claro?" (2: 979). There is no lie or insincerity here. Raquel says exactly what she wants and thereby dares Juan to defy her. The consequence is thatJuan is encouraged to seek out Berta not as a way of fulfilling Raquel's wishes but in order to escape her, which of course is exactly what Raquel knew he would do and fits her plans by relegat- ing him to a subservient role with respect to Berta. Her truth-dare has been a provocation in which the very directness and sincerity of language make it, as she intends, untrustworthy.</page><page sequence="17">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 31 During a conversation between Raquel and Berta in chapter 6, these issues are even more ambiguously explored in a dizzyingly self-conscious scene which discusses sincerity as falsehood. At the same time, that key word "gracias," here meaning "thanks" but possibly reverberating the earlier meaning of grace, also appears in the conversation, either by chance or perhaps through an ironically spontaneous calculation that merely looks like chance, i.e., that is insincerely sincere. In the scene, Raquel tells Berta that she did not marry Juan because she could not have children. This is sincere and true. The statement, however, also carries overtones of insincerity that are apparent in the calculated detach- ment of her tone. Ironically, Berta is being set up for another fall: RAQUEL.-Pero como estibamos a prueba y la bendici6n del pairroco, aun- que nos hubiese casado, no habria hecho que nos criaisemos hijos para el cielo... Por qu6 se ruboriza asi, Berta? aNo ha venido a que hable- mos con el coraz6n desnudo en la mano? BERTA.-ISi, si, Raquel! iHibleme asif! RAQUEL.-No podia sacrificarle [aJuan] asi a mi egoismo. iLo que yo no he logrado, que lo logre d1! BERTA.-jOh, gracias, gracias! RAQUEL.-aGracias? iGracias, no! iLo he hecho por 61! BERTA.-Pues por haberlo hecho por d1..., igracias! RAQUEL.-iAh! BERTA.-aLe choca? RAQUEL.-No, no me choca; pero ya iri usted aprendiendo... BERTA.-aA qu6? A fingir? RAQUEL.-INo; a ser sincera! BERTA.-aCree que no lo soy? RAQUEL.-Hay fingimientos muy sinceros. Y el matrimonio es una escuela de ellos. (2: 989) This is plain speaking to the point of vertigo. Raquel tells the truth about why she did not marry Juan but lies when she insinuates that she is generously of- fering him to Berta. This elicits a "thank you" from Berta, but in another act of sincerity, Raquel does not accept the thanks for she knows she does not de- serve them. At the same time, if we see a pun in the word "gracias," Raquel is sincere when she denies the state of "grace," for she has not been given it by God or, even worse, does not believe that there is even such a thing. And in a final dizzying moment, she says that Berta's sincerity is the product of the "sin- cere pretending" characteristic of married people, thereby saying that married people are liars and that her own lying is sincere and truthful. Again, the important point about these and similar scenes is the degree to which the detachment of Raquel generates an ambiguity of language which depends on two meaning-levels: the literal way it is understood by the other characters, and the metaphorical way it is understood by Raquel, who forces this latter on the others. Observing this duality, the reader acquires a profound sense that mean- ing is profoundly elusive and words deeply ambiguous. One of the most striking instances of language's elusiveness is the moment when Juan announces to Raquel that Berta is pregnant. Overwhelmed with both joy and apprehension at the success of her plans, she covers him with kis-</page><page sequence="18">32 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) ses and, looking into her reflection in his eyes, says: "iDejame que me bese!" (2: 991). Can we really take Raquel to be serious in such a statement? Her nar- cissism is so exaggeratedly absurd that it seems to me to approach a self-con- scious, mocking joke, like a person who is cruelly rubbing salt into the wounds of another's misfortune, in this case, Juan. And the key is the silence of the narrator, who refuses to clarify if the scene is meant to be horrible or funny. In my estimation, Dos madres is less concerned about a tragic failure of mother- hood than about the games people play with words. Actions are so extreme that words themselves become the main focus of the story without it always being possible to know what they mean. Whereas the rest of the story is played out in identical terms, it is important to mention a particularly enigmatic sequence that appears in the last few chap- ters when Raquel finally steals the baby. At the point when Berta goes into labour, Juan hears her cries "como de otro mundo," and feels like he is dream- ing (2: 992). The child is born and Raquel appears, declaring its name Raquel. "Abrumados," Berta's parents agree to the name and shortly after, Berta does too: "Sea como queraiis" (2: 993). Raquel now almost literally moves into the house, as if she were the real mother. Like Juan, Berta feels as if she has been taken over by the forces of another world, as if she were living a dream: "la vio como a un fantasma del otro mundo" and "viendolo todo como envuelto en niebla" (2: 993). Then, in the most enigmatic of scenes, Raquel takes the child and begins to sing lullabies in an unknown language: "Y entonces Raquel se puso a mecer y a abrazar a la criaturita, cantindole extrafias canciones en una lengua desconocida de Berta y de los suyos, asi como de Juan." (2: 994). And throughout the page and a half that this sequence requires, the narrator con- stantly asks what the sense of all this is, as if it possessed a secret meaning: "'Que le cantaba? [...] Que era todo aquello? EQue significaba todo aquello? iQu6 significaba su vida?" (2: 994). There are a number of important elements in this scene. On the one hand, we see the other characters discover their own fictionality, that is, that their life is a story told by Raquel. Having been manipulated into doing what she wants, they have become like Augusto Perez in Niebla, unreal figures in the dream (or vengeful nightmare) of another person, Raquel, who now appears as their "author." But in a situation both typical of allegory and highlighted by the interrogatives of the narrator, this very revelation of origins is also a refusal to reveal the final answer: the lullabies in another language point to a level of awareness that seems both real within the world of Raquel yet obstructed by words that cannot be understood. Raquel finally reaches openly toward that otherworldly domain of being that was insinuated from the first words of the text, yet we cannot know anything about it. There is no moment in Dos madres when the radical otherness of allegory is more insistently felt. The mythical, supernatural domain now manifests itself in words but the words cannot be understood and nothing will ever be known about it. This in turn leads one to ask if she is merely pretending to allude to it. Could the whole scene be a mere fraud? It would certainly be consistent with Raquel's other actions, which are never clearly otherworldly. Thus, we are confronted by a situation in which we cannot resolve two possible meanings: either she is a god moving now within another dimension of existence to</page><page sequence="19">THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE NOVEL IN UNAMUNO 33 which normal human beings do not have access (in which case they are re- duced to little more than helpless animals under the force of an all-powerful alien), or she simply continues her verbal fictions so as to achieve her selfish goals. Is she a god or a fake? The text is so ambiguous that we cannot say. The mystery of man's fall and redemption becomes all the more enigmatic because it may not exist except as a language strategy for control over others. Thus, myth is followed in its larger outlines but it may also be subverted into a cruel joke which undermines its original intent and dissolves into the ambiguity of language. Man is not free of God but merely enslaved to myth-as- distortion and an empty babble of incomprehensible words. And everywhere we look, human beings are manipulated and manipulating in a godless, un- caring world. The meaning of Dos madres is not that women want to have babies but that meaning can never be clear and ambiguity can never be over- come. This is a far cry from that Unamuno whose meanings had been thought to be straightforward, direct and simple: far from illustrating abstract ideas, he has shown abstract ideas in the process of disintegrating into words and ambi- guity. And in the end, we have irony and sarcasm at man's innocent attempts to struggle against this. 5. CONCLUSION My reading of Dos madres is not intended to "solve" or close the work but to open it to further study by encouraging others to recognize the problems it presents. More analysis is certainly necessary both on this tale and on Una- muno's other narratives, beginning perhaps with the other two exemplary novels, El marquws de Lumbria and Nada menos que todo un hombre, both of which, I believe, follow patterns similar to those described here, though with conse- quences that may be radically different in their implications. " In all cases, the key to unlocking the texts is to answer Sainchez Barbudo's call for a literary understanding of Unamuno by a frank recognition of his work as allegorical. The peculiarity of allegory is a deep tension in the production of meaning that destabilizes ideas and engenders a consciousness of their dependence on words. The signified resorts to an arbitrary signifier either because it cannot find the real one - in Dos madres it exists in an unknown language - or because 11 By way of a brief example, Nada menos que todo un hombre also recreates myth - Alejandro G6mez incarnates the self-originating of God - but it undermines tradi- tional understandings by showing that God is dependent on his creation. The discovery of this occurs as an experience of the ambiguity of language when Alejandro literally becomes a character in the metaphorical love story guiding his wife's ideas about their relationship. Interestingly, the implication from a mythical point of view is that self- redemption is impossible, an idea at odds with Dos madres. Perhaps the entire volume of "novelas ejemplares" is an ongoing meditation on the redemption myth with different perspectives developed in the different stories. This would be compatible with Quilligan's view of allegory as a series of tenuously related episodes that each reverber- ate back on one another through detours and modifications of understanding. In that case, we would need to look at all three exemplary novels as episodes in a single alle- gory.</page><page sequence="20">34 STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL RHM, XLV (1992) meaning can never be adequately conveyed. This leads to situations in which truth is ensnared by language and appears uncertain. This, I would say, is the fundamental dilemma of Unamuno. Having sought to penetrate a level of awareness that lack verifiability, he resorts to communication through the detour of otherness or difference. To recognize this is to enter the labyrinth of modernity's struggle to achieve aesthetic expression. Contrary to what has so often been said, don Miguel was at the forefront of this struggle and continues to challenge with the brilliance of his effort. STEPHENJ.
