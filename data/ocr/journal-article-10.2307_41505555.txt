For the most part, especially in anthropological, ethnographic, or world cultures museums, the focus has been on body art, body adornment, and body modification.1 Other approaches have highlighted the historical and/or cross-cultural methods through which bodies are studied and represented.2 Perhaps this appeal, to academics and curators as well as audiences, rests on the recognition that the body is somehow universal. We are all human and all have bodies. In the often fractious interplay of differences with which curators of ethnography deal so often, this must be as rare as it is comforting. You know where you are with bodies. Our bodies, at least, are not culturally variable; they offer a common, natural basis on which to demonstrate variation between cultures. Recent theoretical forays into 'human bodies', however, present challenges, to both the apparent singularity or universality of the body and the division between nature and culture that seems to underlie analytical approaches to it. Bodies are not fixed or singular - they are changeable and multiple (Viveiros de Castro 1998, Mol 2002). Neither are they biological or natural: the consternation surrounding new reproductive technologies, and their impact on how British people reckon kinship, relatedness, and personhood, highlight the instability of categories such as 'human' and 'body' (see Strathern 1992). They also undermine easy equations between natural and 'real' on the one hand, and cultural and 'made up' on the other. The very idea of 'nature' is cultural. What is natural (both in the sense of its being self-evident and being biological; that is, not the product of human ingenuity) seems less clearly defined. When that which is commonly thought to unify us - the human body, with which some of us install and some of us visit exhibitions - is seen to be less stable and reliable than we thought, it prompts some reflection on the kind of exhibitions that we produce, and how they can best get at this uncertainty (without unduly overwhelming and frustrating our audiences). This article is something between a review and a reflection on three recent attempts to exhibit and engage with bodies, in France and the United Kingdom: respectively, a temporary exhibition at the Musée du quai Branly, Paris (Qu 'est ce q 'un corps?, from 23 June 2006 to 23 September 2007), a new series of 'permanent' 241</page><page sequence="2">Mark Elliott displays at the University of Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum {Body Arts, opened 20 April 2002), and a new 'permanent' gallery at Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery (The Body Gallery, opened 4 May 2002). I should make clear at the outset that, as one of the curators of a new special exhibition on human bodies at the University of Cambridge's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology,3 my view is no doubt particular. We all see the exhibitions we want to see, after all. Taken together, the three exhibitions demonstrate the potential of museum displays to engage with ways of seeing and thinking about (epistemologies of) and ways of being in and doing (ontologies of) 'the body'. Radically different in scope, style, and conceptualization, they none the less present kinds of bodies that are the products of diverse technologies and processes by highlighting these technologies and processes themselves. Paris Qu'est ce q'un corps? was the first in a series of explicitly 'anthropological' exhibitions at Paris's new museum of arts premiers, the Musée du quai Branly.4 Innovative in design and approach, it clearly aimed to set the tone for the kind of exhibition that the museum would produce in the future. To the question in the exhibition's title, 'What is a body?', the curatorial team led by Stephane Bréton offered what they called, in one of the exhibition texts, 'an unexpected answer'. Four distinct sections dedicated to 'the body' in different areas of the world - West Africa, Western Europe, Papua New Guinea, and Amazonia - confronted visitors with complex and challenging understandings of what bodies are. In short, the answer given is that the typically Western idea of the body as an irreducible singularity is untenable. No human society, including ours, makes the body a private thing - ne fait du corps une 'chose privée ', or a strictly individual entity. The body is not a finished, given, whole entity; rather, it is universally conceived as something unfinished, incomplete. Completing one's body (or the body of another person) takes a lot of work, and is achieved by forging relations with something outside of or other than the self - with an Other of some kind. This relation is one of dependency and confrontation, and varies between cultures. The scene that greeted the visitor on entering the exhibition space - a mezzanine above the main World Cultures gallery - took some effort to comprehend, as was clearly the intention (Figure 1). There was a curious blend of visibility and invisibility. Spotlights shining through a wire-mesh ceiling created a dappled effect of cross-hatched pools of light on the dark grey linoleum floor, picking out details of the crowd of twenty anthropomorphic wooden carvings from West Africa to the visitor's left. Both of the museum's temporary exhibition galleries have been designed with a fragmented layout, without walls. This can be effective, as throughout the exhibition the visitor was offered tantalizing glimpses of other sections - glimmering light from the Western European section, or a large basketry 242</page><page sequence="3">Three 'Body' Exhibitions Figure 1. View of the entrance to the Qu'est ce q'un corps? exhibition at the Musée du quai Branly, Paris; from a photograph taken in 2006/2007. Courtesy and copyright , Musée du quai Branly initiation figure ( kaiaimunu ) through which young boys in the Papuan Gulf pass to become men - but the principal effect was destabilizing and disorientating. Throughout the exhibition - and indeed throughout the museum - patchy light denies the visitor the chance to see fully the objects on display. Challenging the visitor in this way can itself make a powerful point, as has been experimented with elsewhere.5 The risk, however, is that when also faced with inaccessible interpretative texts, the visitor is less unsettled and intrigued than confused and frustrated. The body in West Africa was presented in the opening section as oriented by the relationship between the living and the 'non-living'. This is a relationship that must be maintained and made safe. The newborn is dangerous, ambivalent. More connected to the ancestors and guardian spirits than to the living, both the body and person of the child must be transformed into those of a socialized adult through a series of rituals including circumcision and scarification. The need to stabilize is emphasized by the human body's continual mirroring of both sides of the relationship - of the ancestors and of the living. This mirroring was dramatically emphasized, both by the rows of anthropomorphic sculptures directly facing the viewer and by a series of black-and-white portrait photographs by Joseph Moïse Agbojelou and Daniel Attuomo from Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Benin. The photographs, mounted almost at eye level, confronted the viewer with the image of 243</page><page sequence="4">Mark Elliott Figure 2. View of the Papua New Guinea section of the Qu'est ce q'un corps? exhibition at the Musée du quai Branly, Paris; from a photograph taken in 2006/2007. Courtesy and copyright, Musée du quai Branly. , living men and women and simultaneously, through reverse images printed on the other side, drew attention to the fact that these people, photographed between the 1930s and 1950s, are now themselves ancestors. The second section presented (Christian) Western Europe through changing imagery: on twenty screens, ever-changing digital images (of photographs and paintings) - by turns shocking, titillating, ambiguous, sexual, and bland - were juxtaposed with one another temporally and spatially. Each and all told a story of incarnations and models of ideal types, of penetrated, dismembered, and disabled bodies, and of the human and the divine. Each is a model for the other, producing the 'ideal' to which all else is compared. This is the body in Europe, then; the body of the 'we' that the exhibition text claimed to speak for, whose idea of the body is not so singular and homogeneous as the visitor may have hitherto believed. It is a Europe of great religious traditions and secularization, accompanied by such technological and scientific advances as the human genome project: I 'ame dans un monde sans Dieu, 'the soul in a world without God'. There was a sense of history and change here, of avant/après, 'before and after', curiously missing from the exhibition's other sections. The images and thé media through which they were presented emphasized this. In the other sections, all the photographs (whether taken in the 1930s or the late 1990s) were printed in black and white. This certainly contributed to a certain aesthetic (which may have been 244</page><page sequence="5">Three 'Body' Exhibitions intended to be sophisticated), but it also located these 'other cultures' in a sort of timeless past. Western Europe, by contrast, is all about flashing lights and digital technology. The difference couldn't be more stark. Round a corner, past the central rotunda where North American musical instruments are stored on shelves behind glass, the next section, on the 'masculine matrix' in Papua New Guinea, presented spectacular objects within curved white display cases. A bilum bag from the Middle Sepik expressed the complex relationship between masculine and feminine, container and contained. The strange moulded cases emphasized this (Figure 2). Curving round to form a separate bubble- like enclosure, the objects contained within in turn surrounded the visitor, at once contained and containing. The body in Papua New Guinea is, like those of the other regions covered (for this was the emerging message of the exhibition), unstable and in need of continual maintenance and refinement. Humans are born androgynous and are transformed through initiation into gendered adults. There is thus a continuing productive tension between the masculine and the feminine, each of which contains the other. The objects displayed here were either containers - the bilum, the kaiaimunu - or visualizations of the fluid relation between interior and exterior, masculine and feminine. Nestling between Sepik masks, whose mouths and penises are fused, was a Klein bottle, its single non-orientable surface curving in on itself. The Klein bottle and the self-consciously innovative display-cases also drew attention to the temporality of the exhibit, and thus of the artefacts. On the one hand this emphasized something very complex and modern about Melanesian concepts of the body and personhood. On the other, however, the display highlighted the contrast between the shiny smooth polymers of the Museum's construction, and the comparatively simple (or natural?) techniques and materials employed by the New Guinean artists. The Amazonian body, presented in the final section, is made up of glances and gazes, un corps fait de regards. The relationships that construct the body are between viewing subjects. The body you have is the body that is seen. In this way, in Amazonia, as in Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, the body is unstable; indeed, humanity is unstable, it must be constantly worked at and maintained. One states that one is a predator by wearing particular trophies or ornaments of teeth and claws. One states that one is a human, having relations with other humans, by wearing the feathers of particular birds. This was the most dimly lit and inscrutable section of the exhibition. Tall, narrow, glass cases - between which the visitor passed - contained intricate feather-work mounted on long vertical metal rods, each example being identified by a narrow label attached to the rod below the object. In the low light (doubtless closer to the ideal conditions for the display of feathers), the labels were difficult to make out, and in some cases, where lights appeared not to be working or labels had slipped from their position, the viewer was forced to work even harder. This is clearly an exhibition that - both during its physical existence and, afterwards, through the impressive catalogue - does an immense amount of work, 245</page><page sequence="6">Mark Elliott presenting theoretical and ethnographic perspectives on bodies that few (if any) exhibitions have attempted explicitly. The display technology, in the sections on Papua New Guinea and West Africa in particular, were certainly daring and innovative, and themselves added much to the experience of a visitor grounded in the techniques and theories of anthropology and museum work. However, it is questionable whether the messages thus encoded were accessible to a non-specialist audience. The impression could so easily be one of wilful obscurity; complex and inaccessible text combined with limited light and a challenging layout. The sharp and unproblematized distinctions in Qu 'est ce q 'un corps? between different places and peoples tended towards the essentializing, exoticizing, and curiously decontextualizing. A fragmented and disorienting experience may well be the most accurate means of communicating the partiality and contingency that characterizes the human body, and it works well for a specialist audience. But here, in the end, the effect was unsatisfactory; there were too many troubling questions. One was never certain whether the effects produced were intentional or whether you were reading too much into them. Oxford While I felt rather lost on leaving Qu 'est ce q 'un corps?, it is hard to know where to start with Body Arts at the Pitt Rivers Museum.6 Occupying a row of shallow wall- and desk-cases along one long wall of the museum's lower gallery, it has been designed to be 'readable' by visitors taking either a clockwise or anticlockwise route around the museum. At each end is a case bearing the exhibition's title and a single object - on the left, a carved door-panel from Gabon and, on the right, an oil painting of a tattooed Maori chief. Curators Jeremy Coote and Jenny Peck have worked within the constraints of the historic exhibition space, balancing the need for maximum visibility and accessibility of exhibited objects with rich interpretation and additional information. In racks to the right of the exhibition, printed texts provide information for the more curious visitor, allowing the use in the displays themselves of smaller labels that not only interfere less with the objects but also, crucially, take up less space and thus allow more pieces to be exhibited. For each case there is an accompanying laminated card containing more detailed information about the themes of the displays. The first few cases to the left offer an orientation for the visitor, using particular objects to highlight the themes explored in the subsequent sections. The anthropomorphic figure carved on the Gabonese door-panel is covered with marks representing cicatrices: 'In many parts of the world', the accompanying text tells us, 'people permanently mark their skin with scars or tattoos to make themselves look beautiful, to indicate group identity, or to mark stages in a person's life.' In the next case, a stone figure from Ancient Peru highlights the diversity of what people 246</page><page sequence="7">Three 'Body' Exhibitions Figure 3. View of one of the cases devoted to the theme of Reshaping in the Body Arts displays at the Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford; from a photograph taken in May 2009 by Elin Bornemann. Courtesy and copyright , Pitt Rivers Museum , University of Oxford. consider to be beautiful, and locates practices of shaping babies' skulls within the broader work of 'temporarily and permanently changing the shape of the body'. Also in this case are body ornaments from the Marquesas, Hawai'i, and Nagaland: 'Ornaments are worn for many different reasons: it may be for their aesthetic appeal, for their magical properties, to change the shape of the body, to mark a person's social status, or to indicate group identity'. This exhibition thus enacts a human body that is, like that of Qu 'est-ce-qu 'un Corps?, incomplete, mutable, and transformable.7 It is a body to which you can do things - add, subtract, and manipulate. Unlike in the Paris exhibition, however, the examples presented are not separated by geographical or cultural boundaries. There 247</page><page sequence="8">Mark Elliott Figure 4. General view of the cases devoted to the themes of Childhood, Puberty, Marriage, and Adulthood in the Body Arts displays at the Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford; from a photograph taken in December 2009 by Malcolm Osman. Courtesy and copyright, Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford. is no 'us' and no 'them'. Artefacts produced by people separated by distance and time, from Anglo-Saxon England and Ancient Mexico to China, Africa, and Australia, sit alongside objects that may seem more commonplace and therefore more striking to British and European visitors - a judge's wig, a black silk tie, perfume bottles, fingernail extensions, and adhesive bindis - grouped according to such themes as 'Toiletries', 'Cosmetics', 'Death', 'Tattooing', and 'Reshaping'. The exhibition - like the museum as a whole, of course - collapses time and space into thematic or, to use the older term, typological displays. The thematic markers tell wholly different stories, indeed enact wholly different social and material phenomena and processes, than would markers such as 'Amazonia', 'Tibet', or 'Iatmul'. There are exceptions to this. Cases devoted to the uli body- painting tradition in Nigeria and to Ta Moko in Aotearoa / New Zealand operate on different registers and seem somewhat out of place. Certainly they offer more detailed insights into particular localized practices that are related by neighbouring cases to broader themes, but they seem to sit rather uncomfortably alongside their neighbours. Perhaps this, too, is intentional. They offer greater detail, which for the other examples is (necessarily, given obvious limitations of space and a need for coherence) relegated to supplementary text. Perhaps they encourage the visitor to look further. 248</page><page sequence="9">Three 'Body' Exhibitions Proclaiming itself to be about body arts , the exhibition seems initially to be about what bodies look like when they are manipulated, curtailed, or embellished. But the multiplicity of the object in the title evokes the multiplicity of both technologies and effects that are on display. These 'arts' are about artifice and ingenuity - about technology and innovation and the products that result. The products are not merely bodies that look different - the bodies thus enacted are different. Thus the silicone breast-implant, pinned in its little plastic bag to the back of the 'Reshaping' case, emphasizes the permeability not only of the physical body, but of our concepts of it (Figure 3). Elsewhere, we see techniques through which mourning is enacted, or childhood, or vulnerability, or gender, or being the member of an age set or society (Figure 4). When the body is adorned it becomes a different kind of body, making visible a different kind of person. The mourners' ornaments, and the markers of status in a neighbouring case, also force the issue of gender. It is unsettling to note that the objects chosen enact male and female bodies in restricted ways: men are presented as defined by achievement and status (as chiefs, or members of age sets), while women are defined by bodily functions and practices (menstruation, but also marriage and procreation). The relationship between the body and the person is most evident here, though this is not made explicit. Brighton The Body Gallery at Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery occupies a single, elegantly designed room.8 Curved walls with embedded display cases guide the viewer through a serpentine display space from 'Transforming' to 'Representing'. An eclectic array of exhibits once again confronts the visitor, which parallels strategies used in the Paris and Oxford exhibitions. The apparent familiarity of our 'bodies' makes it possible - perhaps even essential - to present contrasting and challenging ideas of what a body might be and how it might be done. Brighton Museum's collections are much more explicitly focused on European art and fashion than those of the Pitt Rivers, for example, and as a local authority museum the emphasis is on serving and engaging the local community. The exhibits are things that visitors can relate to their own lives - a blend of the familiar, the exotic, high art, and fashion. We, the audience, see ourselves displayed alongside others. Here, again, are some familiar friends: perfume bottles by Jean Paul Gaultier, a judge's wig, a Maori carving depicting Ta Moko, a silicone implant. In 'Transforming', the subsections refer to the body's physical substance: 'Flesh', 'Hair', and 'Skin'. Each of these is explored through actions - how people bind, cut, protect, or enlarge the flesh; how they (or rather we) extend, keep, or groom hair, and what we do to the skin: tattoo, pierce, scarify, and paint. Juxtaposition between times and cultures seems more blatant here than in the Pitt Rivers, and is not without effect. Women's shoes from nineteenth-century China adjacent to whalebone corsets worn by British women, children, and indeed men, 249</page><page sequence="10">Mark Elliott Figure 5. General view of the entrance to The Body Gallery at Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery; from a photograph taken in 2008. Courtesy and copyright, Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery. along with instruments used in cosmetic plastic surgery, prompt a consideration of practices such as foot-binding in relation to 'our own' ideal body shapes. The headdresses of the English judiciary and Zulu royalty, perhaps, encourage reflection on the 'exotic', and the circumstances in which we temporarily transform our bodies, as do the Dermalite wig for sufferers of hair loss and the 1920s 'fashion' wig made of metallic threads. Coming from the opposite direction, 'Representation' is about 'making images' - showing the body and the person, and 'making ideals' - the shape of the female body (Figure 5). On one side of the room are portraits, caricatures, and reconstructions including a Roman-Egyptian funerary portrait, a facial reconstruction from the skull of an Anglo-Saxon man, a 'Spitting Image' puppet, and an early nineteenth-century marble bust (Figure 6). Plastic buttons in the shape of Mae West's lips are also presented as portraits, emphasizing how representations can rely on fragments and evocations to show what is most important, 'the identity of the person shown'. Actual visual resemblance to the person's body can be vital, the accompanying text informs us, but it can also be irrelevant. It can be difficult to tease out the relationship between 'body' and 'person', with frequent slippage in practice between the terms. This is where the exhibition's principal concerns - expressed in the introductory text-panel - with 'identity and what we believe in' and 250</page><page sequence="11">Three 'Body' Exhibitions Figure 6. General view of the entrance to The Body Gallery at Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery; from a photograph taken in 2008. Courtesy and copyright , Brighton Museum &amp; Art Gallery. 'how we see ourselves' come to the fore. This may seem less an exhibition about bodies than about what we do with them; but, of course, what we know as a 'body' is made up of precisely such actions. Final Reflections The exhibitions in Paris, Oxford, and Brighton enact similar kinds of bodies in very different ways. In part this reflects the different objectives and audiences of the museums: Qu'est ce q'un corps? was a temporary exhibition in a new national museum, Body Arts and The Body Gallery are 'permanent' displays in a university and a local museum respectively. In terms of approach, Qu ' est ce q ' un corps? wore its intellectual credentials and ambitions on its sleeve, as it were. There was an argument with which the visitor either engaged or not. In the fragmented experience of the exhibition, however, the narrative of each section did not ultimately fit together. Body Arts and The Body Gallery by contrast, make no such claims. The Body Gallery has a clear agenda. It highlights that we are all united as well as differentiated by our bodies: 'The human body is something that we all share. 251</page><page sequence="12">Mark Elliott Everybody has one and every one is different.' The exhibits offer multiple ways into this message, but the message is clearly presented. Body Arts is less explicit. There is no 'narrative' as such. Rather it presents an assemblage of tools and materials through which different kinds of bodies are enacted. As such, for me, it works on more levels and thus more effectively. It is not prescriptive. All visitors will not take away the same experience, but then arguably they/we never do. By not being prescriptive, it can be accessed in multiple directions and in different ways. This perhaps best demonstrates the multiplicity of human bodies as they are elaborated and enacted.
