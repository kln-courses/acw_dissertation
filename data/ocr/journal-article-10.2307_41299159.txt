<plain_text><page sequence="1">Response: Fighting over Religion (Notes from the Front) Gary Lease Both the study of religion and the struggles over what constitutes the "object" of such a pursuit threaten to dissolve into ethnographic oddities. The more energy dedicated to defining religion's study in the contemporary university, the more porous the boundaries become between it and other disciplines or objects of attention. Witness the flap occasioned by Charlotte Allen's recent article - "Is Nothing Sacred?" - in the popular journal Lingua franca. l Initially this titillating discussion about what is allowed to pass for the study of religion was provoked by differences arising over a judgment by the National Research Council that divinity degrees do not represent research degrees; they are instead, so the Council's decision, "professional" degrees. A year earlier I had published my account of the demise of the Religious Studies Department on the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California some 15 years earlier; there I offered the opinion that a struggle over what constituted a proper subject for such a department - making intelligible what is claimed under the rubric "religious experience" vs. nurturing and cultivating students' religious experiences- had led inexorably to the 1 .

As Jonathan Z. Smith has reminded us repeatedly, a claim for object-status, or disciplinarity as he terms it, must be based on reflective and critical assessment of the object to be studied; in other words on a definition.4 In North America's mainstream tradition, that is, in the Christian tradition, this definition is, however, assumed: John Henry Newman summarized it best throughout his many works as the "need to know" god.5 Chicago's Martin Marty has adduced six hallmarks that will tell the scholar-hound that it is on the track of a religion: there is "ultimate concern," embedded in "socialization," articulated in "symbolic language," expressed in "ceremonies," resting on a "metaphysical view of life," and resulting in "behavioral adjustments."6 Can such a hodge-podge possibly work? Is this a classification that will allow us to set "religion" aside as a discrete object for study and attention? Marty's taxonomie checklist fits such a large number of obviously non- or unreligious, or even nonrecognized events, that one must clearly despair of reaching any workable definition if those were the criteria. At the same time, it is equally patent that self-definition will not serve the purposes of a shared conversation about an object of study: religion, so this mantra goes, is simply whatever I say it is. Such taxonomies, if that is what these are, mislead at best, and at worst they remove the world of claims from all rational scrutiny. Definition matters and matters deeply. 2.

One person's definition, it turns out, is another's abomination. The scholarly and public landscape pullulates with examples of definition gone astray. In the University of California, for example, the tried and true model from the Christian seminary, with a few exotics thrown in, still seems to hold sway: a recent recruitment on the San Diego campus, and another on the Los Angeles campus, seek Jewish and Christian scripture positions (i.e. Old Testament, New Testament) as the foundation for program building; the Noah's Ark principle would appear to rule: one or two of each. On the Santa Cruz campus, now close to twenty years after the demise of its formal department in Religious Studies, there is more a garbage-can methodology in operation: whatever we happen to find strewn about the faculty is, higgledy-piggledy, grist for the mill. In the public mind, many of the same confusions rule. The Heaven's Gate phenomenon of recent past was decried as an example of the "power" of religion; here there was not an overwhelming need for study but rather basic critical thought. Instead, Heaven's Gate participants were viewed as members of a cult, which by default is considered bizarre; "legitimate" religion, on the other hand, represents in these presentations the "shared" values that we all associate with the term. And how carefully drawn is such a "legitimate" religion? Witness the recent law suit brought in New Jersey through Rutgers University's Institute of Environmental Law: a person charged with violating the legally allowed exercise of hunting has raised the defense, not that the act of obstruction was a case of free speech, but rather a practice of religious rights. Religion in this law suit is defined as a "belief deeply and sincerely held" (in this case of the "sacredness of life"). Such a definition can cover myriad events, even the aggressive attempt on the part of Georgia Baptists to convert Jews to Jesus by interrupting their synagogue services and preaching the Christian gospel to a surprised, and ultimately angry, Jewish congregation. And who can forget the stalwart Alabama judge who refused, in the face of an order from a higher Federal court, to remove copies of the Ten Commandments from his courtroom wall? The contested definition of religion in that case pitted a claim to plural diversity against the fear that the United States is no longer a Christian nation, if it ever was. These examples make clear that the category of religion is often assumed to be a political given. By that I mean that what religion is, or better, what is allowed to count as religion in a given culture and society at a given moment, is frequently thought of as self-evident. In other words, the definition of religion is almost invariably conceived of as the automatic result of the data that make up the notion itself. Such a stance</page><page sequence="4">480 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques is, of course, strikingly wrong. Data, or the empirical "stuff that makes up any categorized phenomenon, does not, indeed cannot, reveal its own structure; such data are never directly and immediately accessible. Rather, the society or culture, through selective interpretative structures (theories), imposes "meaning" on assemblies of experiences: they create definitions. Theory is the source of taxonomy, not the data. The most vivid example of this in the world of religion's study can be found in the contrast between the Eliade-inspired tradition of a universal category that is self-defined, and thus a self-given mystery, on the one hand, and the La Barre-model which staunchly maintains that the only mystery about religion is what it purports to be about, on the other. As Masuzawa so forcefully argues, we do not talk about religion itself; the only thing we can discuss is what others say about religion.7 Assuming the category of religion to be politically given can sometimes lead to bizarre results. Take the case of South Africa and its new Constitution. In 1995 a South African scholar (Martin Prozesky) challenged the phrase "May God Protect our People" in the proposed Preamble of the Constitution. His argument was simple: such language was discriminatory of nontheists. The Constitutional Assembly allowed the phrase to stand, following the counterarguments that the very body politic rose or fell on such obvious and self-evident "givens" as the notion of god. Upon appeal the decision to keep the contested wording was upheld, but for reasons that neither party had envisioned. In essence, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, ruling on the Constitution of the Western Cape, decided that the word "god" was not an example of discrimination; indeed, there was no discrimination at all. To everyone's surprise the Court found that the word "god" in our contemporary and extremely diverse societies had no substantive meaning at all!8 It is, in other words, an "empty" cipher. Not only does the category religion not provide such words as "god" with automatic meaning, but in the judgment of this particular South African Constitutional Court, no current theory has done so either. It therefore does not come as a surprise when the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, in conjunction with the North American Association for the Study of Religion, hosted a joint session aimed at clarifying the definition of religion, especially in social scientific research 7.

In the collection of papers presented here, both Geertz and Jensen attack the question of definition, and its problems in the realm of religion, directly; these contributions, however, were made after the conference in question, and without intending any judgment on those efforts, I confine my remarks here to those papers from the original session that prompted shared discussion. In fact, "remarks" is perhaps too strong a term: I responded to each presentation with a series of questions that, taken together, resulted in some common conclusions, or better, consequences that, in my opinion, represented well the fruits of our joint labors. Benson Saler probes here the difficulty of providing a definition of religion by taken a closer look at language usage. His result argues for a renewed concentration on "prototype effects" as a path to such a definition. One must ask, however, what the criteria are for determining when language is "murky" and when it is "clear"? Without such a clarification, prototypical language usage is unable to offer a guarantee. Even more perplexing is the question of how one determines when such language usage is saying "yes" and when it is saying "no." Or, when is it "more" and when is it "less?" Language, prototypical or not, does not, itself, provide these clues, or rules of interpretation; instead, one must look to interpretative structures from outside the immediate language field to do so - in other words, one must look to theory for the imposition of meaning. The notion of "natural language" does not, unfortunately, take us much further: those examples that are "less" able to capture a definition are no less a member of a category for being less! The proposed resolution of the problem of definition becomes, on this tangent, as slippery as the problem itself. One fall-out of language application to the surrounding world, according to Stewart Guthrie, is that the human species casts all its experiences with everything other than itself as human-like. The difficulty here is that "gods" are not human-like; indeed, one of the most frequently shared characteristics of so-called gods is that they are possessed of traits, abilities, features, and finally, natures, that are distinctly nonhuman. Anthropomorphic images may well lie at the origins of various religions - after all, humans seem to be "compulsive" anthropomorphizes, as an animal behaviorist has termed it9 - but surely not as an end. How, in other words, does one reconcile the non-human nature of "gods" with the need to "see" humans? Perhaps Barbara 9.

Kennedy, New Anthropomorphism (Cambridge, 1992).</page><page sequence="6">482 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques Ehrenreich is correct when she posits primeval human experiences with predators as the root moment for many of the species' most destructive acts. 10 Though speaking of North American Pronghorn, the biologist John Byers may be close to the human mark when he views these obviously ill-designed prey animals - they are far faster than they need to be for the current assemblage of predators threatening them- as chased by the "ghosts of predators past"11: that could hold just as well for humans as it can for the Pronghorn. While Brian Smith's approach to the academic study of religion is refreshing, he also generates some problematic relationships. Can it really be, as he claims, that the study of religion is interested in whether a particular religion's contents are "true" or not? Or whether those "truths" are enunciated with authority? Speaking with authority is not a fact, but rather a claim, above all of universality and absoluteness! I would counter that the only thing possible for the student of a religion is to determine what is claimed as true, not whether those contents are, in fact, true; and further with what force, and above all with what impact, those claims are furthered. In Smith's view, the study of religion presupposes that religion is a human product. I must ask, however, whether such a conclusion is a fact, or whether that appears to be the case because that is all we have access to? To do more than that, as Smith seems to do, is also to imply a judgment about the so-called truth of the religion under investigation - the very thing that the study of religion is supposed to eschew! Strikingly, all three contributions share in common a missing factor: where is the political dimension?! Put another way, I wonder where is the concern for, and analysis of, power and control within which the determinations about what gets to count as religion (and above all, what does not!) always take place? Saler, for example, sees religion as a specific aspect in time and place; Smith maintains that religion can only be studied historically. Both of these positions imply the political dimension: why is it left unaddressed, indeed not even directly mentioned? What does emerge as common ground, however, is that our contributors all agree that the definition of religion has no firm boundaries. No matter how much the one or the other of them may wish for more solid ground under our definitional feet, the shifting sands of the 1 0.

As a consequence, each of our authors also recognizes that no definition is sustainable, i.e., each one sees "religion" as a constantly floating determination. This is so, they agree, because the definition of religion is always taking place under historically conditioned negotiations. The end result of this extended discussion is that however undesirable it may be for the one or the other, relativity is clearly the hallmark of the entire definitional process: determining what gets to count as religion at any given time in any given place is always contingent on factors both changing and outside of the data and experiences that make up the material of the definition of religion in the first place. What can we conclude from our conversation? Some results seem clear. For example, it is very difficult to imagine how one can continue to use any longer the term "religion" as an effective analytic category. One can describe religion, one can wrestle over its historically conditioned changes, but one cannot presume sufficient stability in the term's meaning to apply it analytically to data. In fact, one must ask, as I have elsewhere, whether a "natural history" of religion is not only necessary, but the only avenue open to us for shared discussion about religion?12 If so, then we must ask first and together with our authors here collected, just how such a "natural history" is to be conceived and executed? Perhaps as a form of so-called cultural studies, in which one would trace the historically contingent presence in societies and cultures of centers for the distribution of power: tracing, in other words, how what is allowed to be "religion" changes in time and place, and how the attempt to prohibit change leads to programmed (institutional) suicide. For the study of religion this can only mean that since the characteristics of religion are neither self-evident nor agreed-upon, there is no "object" to guide our determination of what religion is. Wrestle as we will with the problem of definition, no cracking ofthat nut is possible. Instead, since the only validity attaching to a religion is that enjoyed by each moment's accepted agreement of what counts as religion, history is the only way to study the phenomenon and its data. Beyond the world of academic investigation, however, one must still live, both publically and privately, with religion. That means, in effect, that a constant negotiation is necessary between the claims of individuals, on the one hand, and the demands of a society on the other. A clear cut-off point is 12.

Thus the world of law, not the academy, has become the place where society conducts its battles over the negotiations that result, for however short or long a period of time, in serviceable but always temporary definitions of religion. And with the erosion of the possibility of defining religion comes inevitably both the abuse of its power and the inability to protect against that abuse: let the buyer beware!</page></plain_text>
