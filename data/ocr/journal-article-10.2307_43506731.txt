The first volume ( Yoqnecam I), published in 1996, was devoted to the later periods excavated at the site (Strata VII-I), from the Ottoman to the Hellenistic period. The present volume reports on the Iron Age and Persian period strata (XVIII-VlII). The Iron Age strata at Yoqnecam (XVIII-XI, most of which are divided into several sub-phases) constitute the main theme of the present discussion, since they include the bulk of the material. Furthermore, the presentation of these strata and the analysis of the material uncovered in them make a significant contribution to the archaeological picture of that period in the Land of Israel. In this respect, the following aspects are noteworthy: • The almost uninterrupted sequence of Iron Age strata - eight in all - uncovered at Yoqnecam, spanning the twelfth/eleventh centuries BCE (the Iron Age I) through the last third of the eighth century BCE (the Iron Age IIB/III); • The discovery and partial excavation of a water system, one of the very few in this country securely dated to the Iron Age IIA (the tenth century BCE); • The uncovering of two superimposed defense systems, the earlier a casemate wall and the later consisting of two parallel walls separated by a narrow passage (termed "the gallery wall"). The latter appears to be unique in this country so far (with a possible exception at Gibeon); • The dense stratigraphie sequence resulted, among other things, in the recovery of a relatively large number of ceramic assemblages originating in loci of secure stratigraphie attribution. This made possible a detailed study of the development of various ceramic types throughout the twelfth/eleventh-late eighth centuries BCE (from the Iron Age I through the Iron Age IIB/III) and the rate of their rise and decline in "popularity" (measured statistically). Of special importance in this respect is the picture emerging with regard to the development of the ceramic typology throughout the tenth and ninth centuries. Most instructive is the comparative study of the Yoqnecam ceramic types with those uncovered in neighboring sites (see map), such as Tell Qiri (a satellite site of Yoqnecam), Megiddo, Tel Jezreel and Taanach, all in the Jezreel Valley, Rosh Zayit, located in the Lower Galilee, sites in the northern coastal area, such as Tell Keisan and Tel Dor, and even with more distant contemporary sites, such as Hazor and Dan in the Upper Galilee. The results of this study are of great significance with regard to the controversy about the "traditional" versus "low" chronol- ogy of the Iron Age II (Finkelstein 1996; Ben-Tor 2000). In our opinion, it clearly supports the "traditional" chro- nology of that period (Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a).

Although several other small areas were investigated during the first season of excavation (1977), in all subsequent seasons the archaeological investigation focused on the north-western part of the site. In total, ca. 1,500 m2 of Iron Age remnants were exposed, amounting to about 2% of the total area of the site. The geographic location of Yoqnecam, its topography, the excavated areas, the literary sources in which it is mentioned and its role within the Yoqnecam Regional Project have already been discussed in previous publications and need not be repeated here (Ben-Tor 1980; 1993; Yoqnecam I: 1-2). The final report on the excavations of Tell Qiri, one of the two satellite sites of Yoqnecam, was published in 1987 (Qiri), and the final report on the other satellite site, Tel Qashish, was published in 2003 ( Qashish ). It is a great pleasure to thank all those who made the excavation at Yoqnecam and the publication of the results possible, by extending logistical and financial aid, as well as those who carried out the work at the site. First and foremost, thanks are due to the Soltam factory and especially to the late Mr. S. Matri, who was head of Soltam' s personnel department when the excavations were started. Without his help and enthusiasm, the entire Yoqnecam Regional Project would not have been possible. Our thanks are also extended to Mr. Y. Ronen and Mr. M. Bar-Uman, subsequent heads of Soltam' s personnel department. We are most grateful to the municipal authorities of Yoqnecam Illit, Mr. I. Gavrieli, then head of the Yoqnecam local council, and especially the late Mr. S. Leibo, his deputy, who generously placed the Hadassim school at our disposal and who, with the aid of Yoqnecam Illit' s technical department headed by Mr. Y. Elkanati, made the school a pleasant base and headquarters of the expedition. Finally, our gratitude is extended to the residents of Yoqnecam Illit, whose help, curiosity and hos- pitality made our stay in their town a pleasant one. Thanks are due to all the volunteers, from Israel and countries worldwide, who participated in the excavations either as individuals - many returning to Yoqnecam year after year - or as members of organized groups. Among the latter, the groups of the Criswell Bible Center (Dallas), the Ponti- fical Biblical Institute (Jerusalem), Project 67 (London), and the Swedish Theological Institute (Jerusalem) deserve spe- cial mention. Groups of students from the Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jeru- salem received their field training at Yoqnecam; several of these students became area supervisors and some remain with us as experienced archaeologists today. 2 We would like to express our gratitude to Y. Portugāli, surveyor and member of the team of the Yoqnecam Regional Project, and to the excavation area supervisors, who directed work and investigation of the Iron Age strata: R. Avner, E. Bloch-Smith, B. Brandi, Y. Graff, Z. Greenhut, M. Hershkowitz, M. Hunt, R. Lavi, H. Mashat-Alon, I. Sharon and A. Zarzecki-Peleg. M. Avissar, R. Ben-Dror and L. Charash-Zehavi were in charge of find registration; S. Dahan was the excavation's administrator. Thanks are due to the following institutions which sup- ported the analysis of the material uncovered at Yoqnecam and the publication of this volume: the Berman Center for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Doron Foundation (Tel Aviv), the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and the White-Levi Program for Archaeological Publications (New York). Needless to say, without all this support the excavation, research and publi- cation of this volume would not have been possible. Part of the research, the findings of which are published in this volume, was carried out during my appointment at St. Johns College, Cambridge, U.K., as a visiting fellow. I would like to thank the college, and in particular the Rev- erend Dr. Andrew Macintosh, then Dean of St. Johns Col- lege, for its help and great hospitality. Special thanks are due to Ruhama Bonfil, who labored for many hours on the preparation of the complex plans and section drawings. H. Bitan, S. Halbreich, M. Sarig and A. Yarus drew the finds; R. Uni was the excavation restorer; I. Sztulman, G. Laron and A. Zarzecki-Peleg were the area and find photographers. All the authors who contributed to this volume are indebted to Tsipi Kuper-Blau, who translated Parts II and III and edited the volume. Without her dedication and meticu- lous attention to detail, this volume would not have reached completion. We are grateful to Yehuda Cohen, who translated Part I. Thanks are extended to Avraham Pladot, for the layout and design of the volume, and to Yoni Gamliel (Tavim) for the typesetting. Last but not least, the support and cooperation of the Israel Exploration Society was an important element in the suc- cessful realization of the Yoqnecam Regional Project. This cooperation continued throughout the entire period of prep- aration of this volume. This volume is dedicated to Joseph Aviram, Director of the Israel Exploration Society, in appre- ciation of his personal involvement, support and constant encouragement, without which this volume could never have reached completion. * The chapter on the Iron Age faunai remains had not been submitted by the time this volume went to press and will be included in the Bronze Age volume ( Yoqne'am III).</page><page sequence="25">PART I STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE</page><page sequence="26">CHAPTER TWO INTRODUCTION The excavations at Tel Yoqnecam focused on the area adja- cent to the tell' s north-western boundaries (Photo 1.1). The terrain slopes steeply from the top of the mound towards this area, leading to considerable differences in height be- tween adjacent areas of excavation. This is clearly reflected in the exposed remains, both with regard to the designation and planning of the area, as well as in the technical solutions employed to overcome the problematic topography (con- struction of retaining walls and terraces, installation of rain-water drainage channels, etc.). The excavated area was originally divided into five areas (A-E) in an effort to obtain preliminary results (Ben-Tor and Rosenthal 1978; Yoqnecam I). Following the results of the first excavation season, it was decided to focus on Areas A (further divided into Al, A3 and A4) and B2 (Plan 1.1), on the north-western boundary of the tell, since it was presumed that this location would provide a broader picture of the earlier strata at Tel Yoqnecam. As the excavation progressed, the delineation of the areas underwent various changes in accordance with new objectives set and in response to physical constraints, mainly those posed by the massive Iron Age IIA and B fortifications (Photo 1.2). Thus, new bound- aries of the areas were designated, e.g. "the piazza" (thus named on account of its use as an open space in the Stratum XII city and encompassing part of the old Areas A3 and A4) and "the water system".

None- theless, the remains from Iron Age I strata, however frag- mentary, allow for a reconstruction of the settlement during that period (the second half of the twelfth century BCE and the eleventh century BCE). In most of these strata (as well as in those assigned to the Middle Bronze Age II and Late Bronze Age), the inhabited areas extend beyond the bound- aries of the Iron Age IIA and B cities; moreover, they are built along the same orientation, which changes only in Stratum XIV. The areas in which Iron Age I remains were encountered (Plan 1.3) are: • Area Al (Squares M-N/20, N/21); • Area A4 west (Squares E-F/25, E-F/26, E/27, G/25); • The piazza, Area A4 (Squares H-J/27-28, G/28); • The test pit in the gallery wall (Squares G-H/26); • The test pit in the casemate wall (Squares E/28-29); • Area B2 (Squares E-F/31-32). The various areas, although not contiguous, have been linked together on stratigraphie grounds. At the end of the Late Bronze Age / beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XIX), the settlement was totally destroyed, and a hiatus precedes the later Stratum XVIII settlement built above it. In most areas, Stratum XIX terminates in a great destruction, with an extensive fill above it, ca. 50-100 cm thick, indicating that the place had probably been abandoned for a consider- able length of time. This is of significance for an understand- ing of the site's stratigraphy. Evidence of yet another great destruction, attributed to terminal Iron Age I, was encountered in Stratum XVII. This destruction is the second stratigraphie marker used in linking the physically disconnected areas of excavation. Between these two destruction layers several Iron Age I phases have been identified, varying in number as well as in nature in the various areas. In most areas - Area Al, the test pit in the gallery wall, the piazza (mainly in the upper terrace) and possibly Area B2 as well - two principal strata, Strata XVIII and XVII, were clearly identified, occasionally including sub-phases. 10 In contrast to the lack of continuity between phases evident in most areas, in Area 4 west the phases discerned exhibit continuous architectural development and do not permit a clear-cut differentiation between the two strata. The following discussion presents the areas of excavation from north to south, providing a representation of the ce- ramic assemblages and other small finds, according to each stratum and/or phase. A detailed discussion of the ceramics appears in Part II. AREA Al This area was excavated with the aim of exposing early (Iron Age I and Bronze Age) remains in a locality where excava- tion was not restricted by the Iron Age IIA or B city walls (Squares M-N/20-21; Plan 1.4; Sections A-Al, A2-A3). The area starts in the south, at the point where the city-wall line turns sharply towards the center of the mound (W.25; Plan 1.4). The northern part of the area, where the Iron I strata are not damaged, is extremely limited in size (only ca. 5 m2). Consequently, the remains of the Iron Age IIA and B fortifications in the south are at the same elevation as the Iron Age I remains in the north. The western part of the area has been washed down the slope. Paving L.2335 and a tilting earth floor, L.2326 ( Yoqnecam III) are attributed to Stratum XlXa, the last of the Late Bronze Age strata. An accumulation, ca. 70 cm high, of collapsed burnt bricks and other indications of an immense conflagration, was found above them. Two strata, XVIII-XVII, were identified above this destruction layer, the upper one (Stratum XVII) likewise terminating in a conflagration. Stratum XVIII (Plan 1.4) This stratum is represented by a packed earth floor, L.2325 (incorporating L.60; Fig. I.l1), tilted steeply to the west. No walls ascribed to this stratum were uncovered. Several ob- jects were found on this floor, including a cooking jug and an iron knife (Fig. 1.1:8,18). 1 The ceramic assemblages appear at the end of each chapter, after the discussion of the strata in question.</page><page sequence="32">THE IRON AGE I Plan 1.3.

These include several walls: W.21, running east-west, perpendicular to W.26 to the south and W.27 to the north. It is difficult to determine the plan of this structure. A floor of pebbles and packed earth, L.2258 (incorporating L.63; Fig. 1.2), was also exposed, with stone paving to the south. Part of the latter may have functioned as a foundation for a mudbrick wall (a great number of such bricks were found within collapses all around); such a wall, however, could not be readily discerned. This floor, like the one from the previous stratum, is tilted westward. Most of the area was covered by a thick fill of crumbled burnt bricks, suggesting that the area had been abandoned for a considerable length of time. However, the sharp slope on which Area A lies should be borne in mind, as well as the fact that it drains rainwater from most of the mound's top. AREA A4 WEST This area is located outside the Iron Age IIA and B fortifi- cation line (Squares E-F/25, E-F/26, E/27, G/25), in the western part of the excavation area, some 11m from the piazza (Plan 1.3; Photo 1.3). The sounding deviates some 45° from the mound's grid, a measure taken in order to adjust it to the slope line. Evidence of the destruction of the Late Bronze Age settlement (Stratum XlXa) was exposed in the area. The Plan 1.5.

Aerial view of Area A4 west; note fortifications on top of remnants of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I floors of a private dwelling unearthed here, L.2376, L.2374 and L.2375, were overlaid by a fill, ca. 1 m thick, of collapsed bricks, ash and other indications of fire ( Yoqnecam III). An earth fill, ca. 0.50-1.0 m thick, separated the top of this destruction layer from the Iron Age I structure erected above it (Stratum XVIII; Photo 1.4). This structure seems to have been in continuous use throughout Strata XVIII and XVII. As the excavated area was relatively small, the plan of the structure could not be clearly determined. The western side of the structure, facing the mound's edge, has collapsed down the slope. On the eastern side, the excavated area was restricted by the city walls, leaving a long narrow strip. The structure features an outer wall, W.342, to the north and several inner walls, W.150, W.341, W.149 and W.343 (Plans 1.6-9). On this evidence it is feasible to reconstruct a structure featuring a relatively wide central space (perhaps an open courtyard, L.2365 in Stratum XVIII and L.2358 in 14 Photo 1.4. Iron Age I walls on top of fill resting on Late Bronze Age walls</page><page sequence="36">THE IRON AGE I Stratum XVII) in the west, delimited by W.341 and W.150, and rows of rooms to the east and south. The structure shows several building phases, indicated by raised walls, elevated floors and blocked doorways. W.342, W.341 and W.343 feature three building phases, one on top of the other, all following the same plan and continuing until the end of Stratum XVII. Several floors, belonging to dif- ferent phases, have been exposed east of W.341. The distinction between the two strata is somewhat arbit- rary, based upon an ash layer on top of the walls of the lower building phase, separating it from the intermediate one. Thus, the lower phase was attributed to Stratum XVIII and the intermediate and upper phases to Stratum XVII. Stratum XVIII The structure under discussion was constructed in the first building phase, to which two living floors in the eastern space, one on top of the other (L.2371 and L.2363; Section B-B'), are attributed. Phase XVIIIb (Plan 1.6) A low wall, W.346, possibly a bench, built against W.342, was uncovered in L.2371 (Fig. 1.3:15-27). An opening in Plan 1.6.

Blocked doorway in W.341 (Strata XVIII-XVII) A stone paving, L.2368 (incorporating L.2362), exposed in the inner space, consisted of large flat stones and pebbles, overlaid with a thin layer of packed earth (Photo 1.6), on which several potsherds were found (Fig. 1.4:21-28). Phase XVIIa (Plan 1.9) By this stage the doorway in W.341 was blocked, and a tabun was erected opposite it, in L.2361. No well-defined floor was detected in the eastern inner space (L.2360; Fig. 1.4:1-20). Only the eastern part of the floor, L.2358a, was exposed; the rest had been washed down the slope. These three phases were not observed in the southern part of the structure, where W.150, perpendicular to W.341, was unearthed. W.149, to the south of and perpendicular to W.150, is at a higher elevation; however, this difference in height may reflect the area's terracing, rather than indicating different phases.

Since the paving of L.1864 has not been dismantled, it is unknown whether there were any earlier floors abutting W.149. The attribution of paving L.1864 to Phase XVIIb is therefore tentative. The structure yielded no evidence of destruction or hasty evacuation, and it seems to have been abandoned. The absence of any suggestion of a violent destruction at the end of this sequence of phases makes it difficult to link it stratigraphically with the other areas (as is also the case with Area B2; see below). Remains attributed to the Iron Age IIA (the tenth century BCE; see Chapter 4) were found above the structure. THE PIAZZA Located east of the Iron Age II fortifications (Squares H-J/27-28, G/28; Plan 1.3), the piazza (whose name is derived from the area's function in the Iron Age IIB) con- stitutes the principal area in which Iron Age remains have been unearthed. Stratum XVII structures unearthed in the piazza were built on three terraces: ranging from the upper- most one in the south to the lowest one in the north (Plan 1.9). Extensive building activity in this period required the clearing of part of the earlier remains down to bedrock. For this reason, few remains survive pre-dating these activities, and these are situated mainly at the northern edge of the Stratum XVII terraces, in places where the bedrock forms a sheer drop. A cave, L.2252, integrated into the Stratum XVII Structure 3035, may have been quarried at an earlier period, possibly during the Middle Bronze Age II (see below). Late Bronze Age remains have been found mainly on the upper terrace (L.2522 or L.3042a), some founded on bedrock (Plan 1. 10; Sections D-DI, D1-D2 on p. 24; Fig. 1.5). No evidence of destruction or abandonment was found on these floors. In contrast to most other areas, the tops of the Late Photo 1.7. Iron Age I walls (Strata XVIII-XVII) on top of Late Bronze Age walls (Stratum XIX) 20 Bronze Age walls (Stratum XIX) were found immediately beneath the Stratum XVIII foundations (Photo 1.7). It is therefore possible that any evidence for the Late Bronze Age conflag- ration had been cleared away with the construction of the later structures. However, a fragmentary white plas- tered floor, L.3046, dated to the Late Bronze Age, was uncovered in the intermediate terrace, with the remains of a wrecked tabun on it. Stratum XVIII (Plan 1.7) A floor, L.3037a and L.2517 (Fig. 1.6) was exposed on the upper terrace, abutting the foundation of W.424. This floor consists partly of packed earth and partly of gravel (Photo 1.8). A tabun (L.3039), built of large potsherds of a collar-rim pithos (Fig. 1.7:6; Photo 1.9), and a small wall (W.398) east of the tabun , with a relatively large square stone integrated in it, were also unearthed here. The terrace's eastern bound- ary is not clearly discernable. Photo 1.8. L.2517 (Stratum XVIII) Photo 1.9.

These remains include W.318. With the exception of L.3044 (Fig. 1.8), no floors associated with this wall have been detected. Noteworthy is a goblet, recovered from the makeup, L.2533, beneath the foundation of W.312 (Fig. 1.8:8; Photo 1.10). No remains attributable to Stratum XVIII were encoun- tered in the lower terrace. Photo 1.10. Goblet under wall of Room 3032 (Stratum XVII) Stratum XVII (Plan 1.9) As mentioned above, a system of structures, built on three terraces, was exposed in the piazza (Sections D-Dl, D1-D2). A dual-purpose wall, functioning both as part of the structure and as a retaining wall, was built at the edge of each terrace. Hence, on the edge of each terrace there are two adjacent walls: W.312 and W.309/W.425 in the south, and W.319 and W.313 in the north. The difference in height between the upper and intermediate terrace floors exceeds 1.5 m, while the difference between the intermediate and lower ones is ca. 0.5 m. This construction method, applied to the steep terrain, is responsible for the fact that the parts of the structure on each terrace that face south are better preserved. Wall repairs or rebuilt sections, detected in several places, attest to two building phases in this stratum: XVIIb and XVIIa. W.312a and W.397 in the intermediate terrace, W.313 and W.319 between the intermediate and lower ter- races and L.3036b-a on the lower terrace are all indicative of this sub-division. Evidence of the violent destruction that befell Stratum XVII is clearly visible throughout the piazza, where an accumulation of collapsed burnt bricks and of charred wooden beams over 1 m high has been found, containing much pottery, as well as other buried finds. The remains are described below from the upper to the lowest terrace. Structure 2511 (Plan 1.9) Only the northern part of Structure 2511, located on the upper terrace (Squares G-H/28), has been exposed. As a result of the collapse of the terrace's northern edge, various remains from this stratum, including floors and walls, were damaged. The area was covered with an earth fill (mixed with collapsed bricks, pottery, etc.), which was subsequently washed down the slope. The destruction line descends diag- onally northward (for further discussion, see Chapter 4, Stratum XVI, L.2506a). The structure's remains include W.309/W.425 on the northern edge of the terrace and floors L.2285 and L.2511 (Figs. 1.9-12), abutting it in the south-west. An installation of small stone slabs, L.2519, was unearthed here, with a storage jar on top (Fig. 1.9:12). The floor is partly paved (with the top of W.424 incorporated into the paving) and partly made of packed earth and plaster residue. Many pottery vessels were found in situ , including storage jars and small vessels (a bowl, a chalice, a lamp, etc.), underneath a collapse of burnt bricks (Photos 1. 1 1-14; for distribution, see Plan 1. 11 on p. 26). Structure 3035 : The Oil Maker's House (Plan 1.9) Located mainly on the intermediate terrace, this structure may have extended over to the lower one as well. In this location the rock surface was relatively high, particularly in the west, and there is evidence of large-scale quarrying activities (Sections C-C', D-Dl, D1-D2). Photo 1.11.

Detail of amphora wall with evidence of carbonized grains, L.2511 Photo 1.13. Pottery assemblage Irom L.2511 The nature of the installations within the structure, cou- pled with the multitude of charred olive pits found inside one of them (L.3047), indicate that the structure served for oil extraction; hence its designation as "the Oil Maker's House". Structure 3035 is delimited on the south by W.312 and on the west by W.311. The structure's corner is clearly visible, although W.312 continues westward, beyond it. Despite appearances, W.312a, the wall's continuation be- yond the corner, should in all probability be assigned to the same time-span as the corner of the walls visible above it, since the very same floors abut all three walls. In the east, the steeply ascending rock constitutes the boundary of the house. A cave located on that side (L.2252) is integrated into the structure's plan (see below). The structure's northern limit is not readily discernible: it is perhaps outlined by the separation between the intermediate and lower terraces, by W.319 and by the stretch of bedrock quarried along the same course to the east. It is possible, although not probable, that the area exposed in the lower terrace (L.3036) was also part of this structure (see discussion below). The structure consists of at least three spaces, two of which (L.3035 and L.3034) were built and another (the cave, L.2252) quarried into the rock, with W.314 separating the former two from each other and with W.303 separating the cave from the central space (Photo 1.15). 23</page><page sequence="45">CHAPTER THREE Section C-C . Schematic section of piazza, Phase XVIIa (view west-east) Sections D-DI, D1-D2. Schematic section of LB and Iron Age I remains in piazza (view south-north) L.3035. - L.3035 (incorporating L.2290) presumably func- tioned as an open courtyard. Its floor is clearly visible: its southern part consists of the hewn worked bedrock and its central and northern parts leveled with an earth fill overlaid by a tough clay layer. W.303, located west of the stairway leading into the cave, supported the fill and flooring of L.3035. Part of the wall, as well as the north-eastern section of the yard flooring, have tumbled into the cave. Several installations in this space are cut in the rock (Plan 1.9; Section C-C'): • A shallow elliptical installation (a basin?) in the south-western corner (only identified after the end of the excavation and the cleaning of the area, and therefore not assigned a locus number). A shallow hemispheric recess in its wall, to the north-west, probably served for placing 24 an oil receptacle. Another rounded depression carved in the bottom of the installation, to the south-east, served as a drainage hole. • An installation north of the basin was carved in the rock to form a rectangle protruding above the surface, with a hole in its centre. This apparently served as a pillar base. A flat stone, exposed on the floor to its north, probably served the same purpose. • Installation L.3047 (Fig. 1.13:9-18) is a rather deep ( ca . 1 m) rounded basin, cut in the rock. Its upper edge on the north side, where the rock surface is naturally sunken, was leveled with stones and superimposed by the court- yard's white clay floor (Photo 1.16). The basin features a step-like recess (see Section C-C'), hewn in its south-western wall, and a depression at its bottom on the same side, intended as a drainage hole. 92.00 92.00 i : , 91.00 ir 91.00 ~W397 90.00 ^ W.314 90.00 û L3032 lllll^n JPjL J* 89.00 ^ W : 3041 ■ ijr J* jjř _ 89.00 A Bedrock 88.00 88.00 87.00 87.00 92.00 92.00 (W.A25) 91-00 L 2511 Ì i __?m_ goô -L_.jW.312a i 90.00 ^PhwJ-2522 ļļļp W.313 j 9Q.QQ W.431 ™___ L.303A 1¡¡¡¡¡Í | 89.00 I L.3041 ™___ i Jpffj L.3036a | I 89.00 Bedrock 88.00 W.319 L.3036b 88.00 87.00 I 87.00 D D1 D2</page><page sequence="46">THE IRON AGE I Photo 1.15.

Weights inside installation L.3047 (note bricks as fill for floor L.3035) The basin, hewn at the same time as the yard's floor, went out of use at a later stage and was intentionally filled in with stones (including three big ones, possibly weights), some pottery and earth, intended to level it with the courtyard floor. This fill was overlaid with a packed earth layer (which had eventually sunk to its present elevation of 89.13), on which numerous pottery vessels (especially storage jars) were found in situ , all dating from the time of the stratum's destruction, as well as other finds (Plan 1. 11; Figs. 1.14-17, 1.18:2,4-6,9,12; Photo 1.17). The installation was evidently not in use at that time; none- theless, it seems probable that its use had been discontin- ued only temporarily, as it must have functioned on a seasonal basis. L.3034. - The room's central and northern parts are paved, with the top of W.318 incorporated in the flooring. In its southern part, the elevated bedrock was leveled off to form a floor (Plan 1.9; Sections D-DI, D1-D2; Fig. 1.18:1,3,7-8).

When exposed it was filled with oily grayish soil (perhaps mixed with organic material), containing num- erous charred olive pits as well as a few small- and medi- um-sized stones, including grinding stones. The installation had been covered with limestone slabs integrated into the room's flooring. The slabs were found crushed and slightly sunk inside the installation (Photo 1.18). It seems probable that the installation was sealed over at around the same time as the temporary termination of use of installation L.3047, in the adjacent space (see above). The location of the room's entrance is unclear.

L.3034, with installation L.3041 temporarily blocked this, however, would not have been easily accessed, as it is located near the oil-extraction installations. Unlike the other rooms excavated in the piazza, Room 3034 was found almost devoid of finds. Cave L.2252 (Plans 1.9, 1.12) This cave ( ca . 3.10 x 4.50 m; maximum height: ca. 2.30 m; Square J/28; Photos 1.19-21), is entered through a flight of steps cut in the rock at its north-western edge. Quarrying marks are clearly visible on its ceiling, walls and floor. Two elliptical basins are hewn into the bottom of the cave (Plan 1.12), the larger one (ca. 1.30 x 2.30 m) to the west, its walls clearly emphasized and its bottom two-tiered, and the smaller one (ca. 0.80 x 1.70 m) to the east, not as well defined. A step-like projection carved between the two basins, sloping towards the western one, possibly represents an early stage in the quarrying of a third basin. The inside of the cave was found partly blocked by a fill, sloping west to east from the cave's entrance. The fill, composed of soil and some stones, has turned into mud under the high-humidity conditions within the cave. Although these conditions have impeded stratification of the cave, the fill seems uniform and contains sizeable quantities of pottery and bones. Plan 1.12.

Internal view of cave L.2252 (Stratum XVII); note stairs in foreground Photo 1.20. Cave entrance and W.303 (Stratum XVII; view from within cave) Photo 1.21. Cave entrance and W.303 (Stratum XVII; view from outside cave) structure, ascribed to Stratum XVII on the following grounds: 1. The building activities conducted in Stratum XVII in- cluded the leveling of the area down to bedrock and the removal of earlier remains (Sections C-C', D-Dl, D1-D2). It is inconceivable that the cave would not have been discovered in the course of these activities, had it existed prior to that period. 2. W.303, delimiting the stairway, functions as a retaining wall for the court's foundation and flooring (Photo 1.21). Its stratigraphie position as well as its orientation allows its integration in the rectangular courtyard wall system (Plan 1.9). It follows that this wall forms a direct link between the industrial structure and the cave. 3. The features of the uppermost step (which is wider than the others and is oriented towards the courtyard) point to its function as a passage between the courtyard and the cave. In addition, its elevation (89.19) corresponds to that of the courtyard floor. Moreover, the rock adjacent to installation 3047 (whose top is at the same elevation as the courtyard floor) was hewn with evident consideration given to the top step, so that a narrow parapet had been left, separating the two elements). The cave's quarrying date has not yet been conclusively determined. The cave (but not the stairway leading to it) may have been quarried at an earlier period for other, perhaps mortuary, purposes, and was later cleared up to accommo- date the Stratum XVII occupants. This assumption is sup- ported by the fact that the fill just outside the cave has yielded, in addition to various skeletal remains, some MB II pottery. The skeletal remains, too small to furnish any significant information, were buried a short distance from their place of recovery. The cave's entrance was covered by the ruins of Stratum XVII, within the huge collapse of stone and burnt bricks that covered the entire piazza. Thus, the destruction of Stratum XVII constitutes a terminus ad quern for the cave's use. The question whether the cave had been in use throughout Stratum XVII until its destruction arises in light of several architectural changes that Structure 3035 underwent in the course of its existence, for example the (temporary?) sealing of installation 3047 and the blocking (?) of the passage at the southern end of W.314. It cannot be confidently estab- lished whether the cave constituted an active part of the complex until Stratum XVII' s destruction, or went out of use at an earlier date, in which case its entrance may have been blocked or it may have turned into a refuse pit. The cave's function in the course of Stratum XVII. - As noted above, the cave was part of an oil-extraction facility, as attested by the installations exposed in the courtyard (L.3035) and adjacent room (L.3034) and by the many olive pits found inside them. The question arises whether the cave had formed an integral part of this industrial complex. It seems unlikely that it was used for oil storage, since this 28</page><page sequence="50">THE IRON AGE I Photo 1.22. Pottery assemblage from L.2252 would have required a cool, dry and well-aired space, which would clearly have rendered the damp, badly ventilated cave unsuitable. Both the quarrying date and the purpose of the two large elliptical basins hewn in the cave's floor are debatable. If the cave existed prior to the construction of the industrial structure and indeed served as a burial cave, the basins may have served as resting places for the interred. Alternatively, they may be regarded as contemporaneous with the industrial structure and connected to the oil-manufacturing process. On the basis of parallels from other sites, it may indeed be claimed that the basins formed part of a system of installa- tions, hewn for the purpose of oil production. Large rectan- gular basins, located close to oil-pressing facilities, were encountered at Beth Shecarim and in a cave at Kelca 17 in the Ephraim Hills (although closer than those at Tel Yoqnecam). These basins have been interpreted as either storage facilities for ground olives or olive waste, or as a device for pounding olives (Eitam 1980: 36). The basins in the cave at Tel Yoqnecam may have been similarly used. The numerous vessels found in the cave (Figs. 1.19-24) probably date from its later phase, when the quarried installations inside it had already gone out of use (as in the case of installation 3047 in the structure's courtyard). The ceramic assemblage consists of a large number of cooking pots and jars, in keeping with the expected composition of an assem- blage derived from a residential or industrial space (Photo 1.22). L.3032 (Plan 1.9) L.3032, located on the intermediate terrace, is delimited by walls W.312a, W.311 and W.397 in the south, east and west respectively; its northern limit was not uncovered. Access to this room was most probably gained from the west. The door jamb may have been located in the northern edge of the exposed part of W.397, in an area where the structure continues under the remains of the later fortifications. It appears that Room 3032 constitutes a separate unit, separate from L.3035. This conclusion is based on the construction of the south-western corner of Room 3034 (W.312 and W.311), since no entrance or passageway was found along W.311, to connect Rooms 3032 and 3034. Wall W.312a is visibly warped, seemingly as a result of pressure exerted by the upper terrace fill. A course of stones exposed at its base, deviating southward from the wall line, apparently indicates an earlier building phase (XVIIb; Photo 1.23). A jar found resting on top of these stones suggests that during Phase XVIIa they may have served as a bench. Construction of a somewhat different character is also de- tectable in the foundation course of W.397 at an elevation comparable to that of the foundation of W.312a. An installation, L.3043, constructed of three rectangular stones, with a jar and a flask on top of it, was exposed in the room's northern side, adjoining W.311. Much pottery, including storage vessels as well as small vessels (an un- common krater, flasks, a lamp, Philistine bottles, a stirrup, etc.), was recovered on the room's packed-earth floor (Figs. 29</page><page sequence="51">CHAPTER THREE Photo 1.23. L.3032 (Stratum XVII; view from north); note floor with pottery in situ ; in foreground, section under floor reveals W.318 (Stratum XVIII) 1.25-28; Photos 1.24-25; for distribution, see Plan 1.1 1). The small vessels found here are noteworthy in their variety and quality, even in comparison to the upper and lower terraces, and may suggest a special function for this room. L.3036 (Plan 1.9) This room, located on the piazza's lower terrace (Squares H-I/27; Sections D-DI, D1-D2), is delimited by W.316, W.319AV.313 and W.315 in the east, south and west respec- tively. It extends north and north-west underneath later remains, not removed (on the southern boundary, see below). Despite its location on the lower terrace, it is still possible that the room was part of Structure 3035, connected via a stairway or wooden ladder (the difference in height between the two terraces being ca. 0.5 m; see below). The room is stone-paved, except for its eastern section, L.3033, where the flooring is of packed earth. The paving is overlaid by a shallow earth fill, on top of which numerous pottery vessels of diverse types, as well as a few small objects, were found in situ (Figs. 1.29-31; Photos 1.26-27; for distribution, see Plan 1.11). The pottery was found 30 Photo 1.24. L.3032 with pottery vessels in situ (view to north) Photo 1.25. Pottery assemblage from L.3032</page><page sequence="52">THE IRON AGE I Photo 1.26. L.3036 with pottery vessels in situ (view to west) Photo 1.28. Paving L.3036b underneath W.313 (detail) Photo 1.27. Pottery assemblage from L.3036 scattered throughout the area except for the unpaved eastern section, L.3033, almost devoid of any finds (see below). Several storage jars were found leaning against W.313. A stripe clearly visible inside one of these jars suggests it was used to hold liquid. The larger part of the room, except its eastern section, was covered with collapsed bricks showing evidence of fire. Cracked stones and bricks fired at high temperatures testify to the enormous conflagration that raged here. Two phases are evident in L.3036: Phase L.3036b. - At this stage the room was built and paved, with W.319 probably forming its southern wall, as suggested by the fact that the paving runs underneath W.313 (Sections D-DI, D1-D2; Photo 1.28). No pottery associated with this phase was recovered. 31</page><page sequence="53">CHAPTER THREE Photo 1.29. L.3036 with pottery vessels in situ; three storage jars leaning against W.313 (view to south) Phase L.3036a. - At this stage a new, slightly curving wall, W.313, was built, its west section adjoining W.319 (Sections D-DI, D1-D2). It is joined by W.315 (?). It stands to reason that the new wall was constructed in order to relieve some of the excess pressure exerted on the previous retaining wall, W.319. Floor level was slightly elevated by means of a packed earth layer, on which pottery vessels were uncovered, including several storage jars leaning against W313, as noted above. This phase was destroyed in a huge conflagration (Photo 1.29). As mentioned above, the eastern part of the room, L.3033, is unpaved. The fill here was dark-brown earth, unlike the fill in L.3036, which contained numerous burnt bricks. In addition, L.3033 was almost devoid of finds (with the ex- ception of two vessels, a lamp and a krater, found on the line separating L.3036 and L.3033). All this notwithstanding, the difference between the two phases does not seem to indicate a later disturbance, since no later ceramics were encountered, but rather suggests that the place served differ- ent functions. The passage connecting the two terraces (pos- sibly through a wooden stairway leading from courtyard L.3035 to L.3036) may have been located here. 32 THE TEST PIT IN THE GALLERY WALL Two relatively small test pits were excavated in the vicinity of the Iron IIA and B city walls (Squares E/28-29, G-H/26, Plan 1.3). The aim of the excavation in these limited areas was to narrow the stratigraphie gap between Area A4 west, the piazza and Area B2. The excavation penetrated as deep as the terminal Late Bronze Age remains, in order to obtain the entire stratigraphie sequence for the Iron Age I. Despite their small size, the excavated areas yielded remains of all relevant strata, including floors, walls and ceramics. The northern test pit is located between the walls (W.212 and W.200) composing the Stratum XII gallery wall (see Chapter 6) and the remains adjoining the Stratum XIV casemate wall on its inner side (W.138, W.135 and W.152, assigned to Iron Age IIA; Plan 1.2; Photo 1.3; see Chapter 4). In this test pit evidence was found of the two destructions marking the limits of the Iron Age I at Tel Yoqnecam: the destruction of the Late Bronze Age settlement (Stratum XlXa) and the one that occurred towards the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). Within this sequence, three levels were exposed, associated with three building phases (XVIIIb-a and XVII). The final Late Bronze Age remains, Stratum XlXa, are</page><page sequence="54">THE IRON AGE I clearly discernable in the area (L.2521, Plan 1.10 on p. 21). A plastered floor was exposed, with several vessels resting on it in situ , covered by a thick burnt layer (over 0.50 m), featuring brick collapses and ash (Fig. 1.5). A fill layer containing natural deposits separates the Late Bronze Age destruction layer from the incipient Iron Age I settlement (Stratum XVIII), attesting to the existence of an occupational gap between the two periods. Stratum XVIII Two building phases separated by a thin ash layer and representing Phases XVIIIb and XVIIIa were observed in W.432. Phase XVIIIb (Plan 1.6) These earliest Iron I remains in this area include: W.432, situated at the south-western corner of the test pit; a white chalk floor, L.2515 (Fig. 1.32:11-38), and an installation, L.2520, built adjacent to the wall (Photo 1.30). The latter is composed of a thin, elongated stone slab, small- to medium- sized stones and one mudbrick. Elevation inside the instal- lation is somewhat lower than around it. Another installation Photo 1.30. L.2515 (Phase XVIIIb) may have been built to the south-west, but its presumed location was disturbed by a later pit. A fragment of a Late Bronze faience plaque was retrieved from slightly above floor level, out of its true stratigraphie context (Fig. 1.32:38; Chapter 24, Photo III. 16). Phase XVIIIa (Plan 1.7) Floor L.2444 and L.2512, exposed above these remains, is also associated with W.432 (Fig. 1.32:1-10). It is composed of packed earth with ash marks, and from it, at the southern edge of the excavated area, a flask and an intact goblet were recovered (Fig. 1.32:9,10; Photo 1.31). This level had been cut by two later pits. Photo 1.31. Pottery from Phase XVIIIa from test pit in gallery wall Stratum XVII (Plan 1.9) A tilted stone floor, L.3050, covering most of the area, has been exposed. The Stratum XVIII wall, W.432, was partly integrated into and partly overlaid by this later paving. A new wall, W.320, encountered at the test pit's western edge, was built in the same orientation as the earlier wall, W.432, except for a slight shift to the south-west. The top of its preserved part is at the same elevation as the paving; thus, only its readily discernable face attests to its existence. The wall's superstructure is brick, many of which were recovered from the collapses piled on the paving. A partly stone-faced pit, L.2443, was exposed in the eastern part of the area. It was found, along with paving L.3050, covered by brick collapses, which attest to the immense conflagration that destroyed Stratum XVII. Paving 3050, located 2.5-3.5 m west of the piazza and ca. 5.5 m east of Area A4 west, is a continuation of the piazza's lower terrace, L.3036. This, however, is not sup- ported by a comparison of elevations: paving 3050 is over 33</page><page sequence="55">CHAPTER THREE 0.50 m higher than 3036, despite the fact that it is located further west, towards the slope. On the other hand, paving 3050 corresponds in elevation to L.3032, which is situated further south, in the piazza's intermediate terrace, and to the Stratum XVII remains in Area A4 west, near the slope. It is therefore difficult to determine with which architectural unit paving 3050 may be associated, if any. Hardly any finds were uncovered in Stratum XVII, except for a few finds, presented in Fig. 1.18:11-12. THE TEST PIT IN THE CASEMATE WALL This test pit was dug ca. 1 m south of Area A4 west, within a cell in the Stratum XIV casemate wall (Squares E/28-29, see Plan 1.3). Two strata, XVIII and XVII, were exposed here above the Late Bronze Age remains (L.2367; Plan 1. 10); these are further divided into sub-phases. Stratum XVIII (Plan 1.7) This stratum is represented by W.345 and an associated white chalk floor, L.2359b. Stratum XVII (Plan 1.9) Two walls, W.163 and W.162, perpendicular to each other, were exposed in this stratum, as well as two associated, superimposed floors (L.2354 and L.2355), with only a small difference in height between them. These are regarded as two phases within Stratum XVII. The early phase (XVIIb) is a packed earth floor with ash marks, L.2355 (incorporating L.2359a), and a badly damaged installation (a tabunl). The later phase (XVIIa) is a floor, L.2354, featuring gravel and organic material remains, with a fill of collapsed bricks above it, with no indication of fire. AREA B2 This area ( ca . 2x3 m), located at the southern end of the excavated area (Squares E-F/31-32, Plan 1.3), was opened in order to re-examine the stratigraphie sequence for the Late Bronze Age-Iron Age II span. As the excavation penetrated deeper, the excavated area gradually decreased in size. This area yielded no evidence of the destruction marking the end of Stratum XIX (Plan 1. 10). The remains in its northern part were found overlaid by an earth fill, suggesting that the place had been abandoned and was left exposed to the elements for a considerable length of time (Photo 1.32). Stratum XVIII or XVIIb (Plan 1.7) Pit L.2528 (ca. 2 m in diameter) constitutes the first Iron Age phase in this area (Fig. 1.33). It was first detected at elevation 94.32, and its bottom is unknown (the elevation 34 Photo 1.32. Industrial area, L.2516 (Stratum XVII), pit L.2528 (Stratum XVIIb or XVIII); Late Bronze Age walls (Stratum XIX) below reached by the end of the excavation was 92.94). The few finds recovered inside it consisted of several potsherds and a conoid stone seal (see Chapter 22, Photo III. 3). The pit was covered over by a stone paving, L.2516 (Stratum XVII). Examination of the pottery retrieved from the pit points to some difficulties in assigning the pit, constituting the earliest phase in Area B2, to Stratum XVIII, due to the presence of a bichrome bowl (Fig. 1.33:1). It may instead belong to an early phase in Stratum XVII. Stratum XVII (Plan 1.9) In this stratum the area acquires an industrial character, associated with bronze production. The remains include W.86 in the south, a floor, L.2516 (Figs. 1.34-35); to the north another wall may be reconstructed (judging by the floor, which ends in a straight line). Floor L.2516, abutting the base of W.86, is mostly stone-paved, with sporadic patches of packed earth. The paving covering pit L.2528 had sunk, collapsing slightly under the pressure of the overlying fill. Fragments of an installation (a tabunl ), surrounded by many ash marks, were recovered in the west, where the floor was packed earth. W.86 functioned as a retaining wall, facing north. It would seem that when W.86 was erected the terrain was steeply sloped, whereupon the wall's foundation trench was not dug in the ordinary fashion, but was almost straight-angled at its southern edge so as to form a triangular section. Fragments of tuyères and crucibles (made of coarse fired clay), bronze production detritus, some pottery, and stones burnt at high temperatures were recovered on and slightly above the floor (Photo 1.33; see Chapter 25). It cannot be determined with confidence whether the extensive evidence of fire found in this area is to be associated exclusively with the local metal industry activities or whether it should be regarded as an indication of the stratum's destruction, as observed in other excavation areas.</page><page sequence="56">THE IRON AGE I Photo 1.33. Tuyère found on floor L.2516 CONCLUSIONS An occupational gap (see Table 1.2) was detected in the north-western part of the tell, between Stratum XlXa (as- signed to the Late Bronze Age) and Stratum XVIII (assigned to the Iron Age I). This gap is manifest in various areas by an earth fill, at least ca. 50 cm thick, between the top of Stratum XIX' s destruction layer and the base of the Stratum XVIII remains. It seems probable that the absence of this fill in the piazza area and in the southern test pit in the Iron Age II fortifications stems from extensive leveling activities, which involved the removal of earlier remains when the Iron Age I structures were erected there. Stratum XVIII, the first of the Iron Age strata, is of a non-contiguous nature and is meager in finds. Conversely, Stratum XVII, which was demolished in the great destruc- tion, was exposed in all the excavated areas and is repre- sented by numerous remains and finds. Strata XVIII and XVII span a relatively long time framework, as is evident in the number of sub-phases detected in Area A4 west, where three clearly visible building phases were exposed, consist- ing of raised walls and four floors (Section B-B'). This part of the tell was densely inhabited, with the settlement spread- ing as far as the tell' s boundaries. Its edge, eroded down the slope, has not survived. The settlement developed gradually, becoming increasingly prosperous in the course of Stratum XVII, as is evident in the apparent change in the nature of construction and in the building standards. The internal sequence of the occupational process is not uniform throughout the areas of excavation: 1. Several areas clearly reveal continuity between Strata XVIII and XVII, as illustrated in Area A4 west, where alterations were introduced, while adhering to the struc- ture's original plan. The stratification of the remains shows an accumulation, ca. 1 m thick, between the levels of the lower (early Stratum XVIII) floor and the upper (terminal Stratum XVII) one. 2. The piazza, on the other hand, gives an impression of discontinuity between the structures from the two strata (XVIII and XVII). Remains of the former, consisting of wall sections on bedrock, with associated floors, are scant and fragmentary, due to the destruction that was caused by the clearing activities preceding the construction of the Stratum XVII structures. The exposed remains indicate that the north-western section of the mound was first and foremost a residential area, interspersed with small-scale industrial installations, such as those used for oil extraction in the piazza and for the metal industry in Area B2. In both cases the industrial element was introduced at the final stage of the stratigraphie sequence of Strata XVIII-XVII. The settlement came to an end in a violent destruction, manifest in extensive evidence of a great conflagration: a plethora of vessels on top of the floors, buried beneath collapses, up to 1.5 m high, of stones, burnt bricks and charred wood.

The most prominent Iron Age IIA remains at Tel Yoqnecam consist of the city fortifications (the casemate wall) and the water system (Plan 1.13), which are suggestive of a central government. These were erected in the course of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV) on top of earlier Iron IIA remains (Stratum XV). Other remains, in- cluding sections of dwellings, courtyards and open spaces, are also attributed to Strata XV-XIV. While much evidence has been uncovered from the later strata in this sequence (Stratum XV and especially Stratum XIV), only meager remains from the beginning of the sequence (Stratum XVI) have been exposed, in the area of the piazza (Squares H/27, G-I/28). As in Chapter 3, the following discussion is presented according to architectural units and areas, since in many cases there is no direct stratigraphie connection between them and the stratigraphie attribution is not irrefutable. Nonetheless, Stratum XVI is presented separately as it re- presents a completely different kind of settlement, exposed only in the piazza area, and can therefore be clearly distin- guished from the later remains. The remains ascribed to Strata XV-XIV are divided into several architectural units (Plan 1.13): • The casemate wall (Stratum XIV; Squares D/28-30, E/27-30, F/26-28, G/25-26, H/24-26, 1/22-25, J/23-24); • The water system (Stratum XIV; Squares J/23-24, K/22-24, L/22-23, M/22); • Remains near the casemate wall (detected in three small test pits; Strata XV and XIV; Squares E-F/26-27, G/26, H-I/25-26); • The piazza and the area to its south (Strata XV-XIV; Squares G-H/29, H-I/27, H-J/28); • Area B2 (Strata XV-XIV; Squares E-F/31-32). THE STRATUM XVI REMAINS As mentioned above, the meager remains of Stratum XVI were encountered only in the piazza (Squares H/27, G-I/28; Plan 1.14). Situated above the Oil Maker's House and Room 3032, they seal the great destruction terminating Stratum XVII, dated to the end of Iron Age I, and are overlaid by 90 remains attributed to Strata XV and XIV, dated to the Iron Age IIA (see below). The remains ascribed to Strata XVII-XVI seem to exhibit a certain anomaly with regard to their elevations. The upper terrace floors of Stratum XVII, L.2285 and L.2511, are at a similar elevation as the nearby Stratum XVI floor L.2506a, to their north (Plans 1.9 and 1.14). This apparent anomaly can be explained as follows. The Stratum XVI floors are all situated at more or less the same elevation (ranging between 90.90 and 90.77/70), while the Stratum XVII piazza is divided into three terraces. Consequently, the Stratum XVI floors are indeed at a higher elevation than the intermediate terrace floors of Stratum XVII, but they are similar in elevation to the upper terrace ones. No Stratum XVI remains have been exposed in the upper terrace, and it can therefore be assumed that this area was not occupied during that time span. The Stratum XVI remains are located in the center of the piazza. No remains were detected in the southern part, and identification of the remains in the north is problematic. During the time span of Stratum XVI, part of the area was presumably still strewn with Stratum XVII brick collapses, occasionally fused by fire into "stone masses" (like the one incorporated into W.305, as late as Stratum XV). The Stratum XVI remains - floor segments, a built instal- lation and a tabun , with no associated walls - are fragmen- tary, occasionally lacking traceable physical continuity. They include a discontinuous packed earth floor, L.2506a (Figs. 1.36-37) and L.2266 south (represented on Plan 1.14 as L.2266s) (Figs. 1.36-37), with a tabun , L.2278, in between. Several objects found on this floor include a bichrome ware jug (Fig. 1.37:11), a fragment of a female figurine (Fig. 1.37:21; see Chapter 23, No. 1, Photo 111.8), a Mittani-style cylindrical seal and a scaraboid (Fig. 1.37:22-23; see Chapter 22, No. 1, Photo III. 1, and No. 4, Photo III.4, respectively). A continuation of the floor, L.2293, combining stones, gravel and chalk, was exposed nearby (Figs. 1.36-37). To the east, installation L.2295 was exposed (Photo 1.34). This installation, one side of which is not preserved, is built of rectangular stone slabs and is associated with floor L.2294 (Fig. 1.38:23-24). This floor overlies a layer of crumbled, burnt, yellow mudbrick material, probably originating in a demolished Stratum XVII structure, which lay abandoned and exposed to the elements (see Chapter 3). The cracks in the installation's stones and the white ash that accumulated on its bottom indicate that it functioned as a fireplace.</page><page sequence="112">THE IRON AGE IIA Plan 1.13.

In sum, Stratum XVI, limited in extent and meager in remains, is represented by a few floors and installations. No remains of any proper structure have been encountered, suggesting that the tell was sparsely, probably ephemerally, inhabited. Nonetheless, Stratum XVI is significant for an understanding of settlement patterns at Tel Yoqnecam in particular, and in the Jezreel Valley in general. It constitutes an independent phase between two strata - the Iron Age I Stratum XVII and the Iron Age IIA Stratum XV - which both represent well-developed, permanent settlements (see Chapter 8, second phase, p. 229). THE CASEMATE WALL The casemate wall, encircling the edge of the mound's summit and attributed, as mentioned above, to Stratum XIV, was exposed in Areas A and B2 (Squares D/28-30, E/27-30, F/26-28, G/25-26, H/24-26, 1/22-25, J/23-24; Plan 1.16, foldout). Although visible for a length of over 40 m, its full width has been exposed at only one location (Squares H-I/24-25). The outer face of the outer wall was mostly eroded down the slope, whereas the outer face of the inner wall was covered over by the later Stratum XII gallery wall Photo 1.35. Chamber No. 3 or casemate wall (¡Stratum XIV) (Photo 1.2; see Chapter 6). Only in places where the later city wall was damaged or where it slightly shifts course, was the casemate wall's inner wall identified. The city wall narrows towards its northern end. Where preserved to its full width, it is ca. 5 m wide; other wall segments in the south, not fully exposed, however, clearly attained a width of ca. 5.5 m or more (e.g., in Squares D-F/28). The walls composing the city wall (with the ex- ception of W.132, see below) vary in width between 1.80-1.60 m. This is the case regarding the outer wall (W.154+W.142), the inner wall (W.139+W.153) and the diaphragm walls (W.277, W.131, W.159, W.133 and W.143) connecting them. Shifts in the course of the city wall - occasionally sharp-angled ones - occur in proximity to the diaphragm walls, where two chambers meet, rather than in the middle of a chamber, such as, for example, between Chambers Nos. 2 and 3 and between Nos. 3 and 4. The chambers Five chambers (one represented by only one corner) have been exposed in the casemate wall, of various sizes (aver- aging ca. 6.5 m in length and ca. 2.6-3 m in width). Chamber No. 2 is particularly long (ca. 7.5-8 m) and its northern corner, unlike its other ones, is not straight-angled, a distor- tion that reflects an adjustment of the wall's course to the angling slope-line. Chamber No. 3 features a massive wall (ca. 3 m thick), which consists of a subsidiary wall (W.132) attached to the inner face of the outer wall of the casemate. This was presumably intended to lend extra strength to this curving stretch of the city wall. The particularly narrow inner space (ca. 0.80-0.90 m) left within this chamber probably contained a stairway leading to the top of the wall (Photo 1.35). Chamber No. 5 is also irregular in shape. The chambers' floors, mostly consisting of packed earth, exhibit considerable differences in elevation resulting from the steep slope. Raised floors have been encountered in a few chambers. Chamber No. 1. - L.1994 (not excavated underneath; Fig. 1.39:1). Chamber No. 2. - L.1890 (incorporating L.1892 and L.1858a; Figs. 1.40-41). Chamber No. 3. - L. 1 824 (incorporating L. 1 826 and L. 1 844; Fig. 1.39). Chamber No. 4. - This chamber exhibits two building phases. The earlier phase consists of L.2357 (incorporating L.2351 and L.2352b; Plan 1.17; Fig. 1.42:1-19,28). The floor rests on a foundation of well-packed pounded chalk. A rectangular installation, L.2356 (Plan 1.18; Section E-E'; Fig. 1.42:20-27), with rounded corners (the north-eastern one somewhat out of shape), is built in the northern corner (Photo 1.36). The installation (ca. 1.90 x 1.40 m) has two elongated 93</page><page sequence="115">CHAPTER FOUR Plan 1.15. Stratum XV stone slabs as its narrow sides and a few fieldstones, whose inner face is flat. Two recesses at the top of each slab, paralleling those in the opposite slab, probably functioned as anchors for wooden beams. The installation is paved with stones of various sizes, among them two relatively large stones, one rounded and positioned slightly off-center. The paving slopes steeply in the direction of the city. 94 A jar, its neck neatly cut (Fig. 1.42:25), is embedded in the south-eastern side of the installation. Although the in- stallation's function has not yet been clarified, it evidently involved the extraction of liquids. A similar installation from Tell Qashish, also ascribed to the Iron Age IIA (tenth century BCE; see Ben-Tor et al. 1987: 16; and Qashish ), lacks the wooden beam anchors.

Installation L.2356 (Stratum XIV) division of Chamber No. 4 into cells, as attested by the fact that partition wall W.145 is built partly on top of the installation's side (see description, Phase XlVa). Earlier publications attributed it to a "pre-wall" stage (Stratum XV; Ben-Tor 1993: 808). Admittedly, no evident connection was found between the inner face of W.146 (the outer wall of the casemate wall) and floor L.2357. However, installation L.2356 was clearly made to fit the chamber's outlines, including its warped angle with W.146, which bends slightly outward in the west. The base elevation for W.146 along that stretch is 89.60, just a few centimeters below that of floor L.2357. In our opinion, the installation indeed belongs to the early stage of the casemate wall. In the later building phase, the chamber is divided into cells by partition walls W.145 and W.158 (the latter perhaps a heap of stones, rather than a wall). Two floor elevations were observed in this phase in each cell (Plan 1.16; for upper levels, cf. Plan 1.17): • The north-eastern cell, consisting of a lower level, L.1855 (Fig. 1.43:8-14), and an upper level, L.1835 (Fig. 1.43:1-7); • The central cell, with a lower level (?), L.2352a (incor- porating L.1883; Fig 1.44:7-9), and an upper level, L.1878 (Fig. 1.44:1-6); • The south-western cell, with a lower level, L.2353b (Fig. 1.44:14), and an upper level, L.2353a (incorporating L.1884; Fig. 1.44:10-13). Chamber No. 5. - A lower, stone-paved level, L.1852 (in- corporating L.1846) and an upper level (?), L.1836. 96 Photo 1.36. Installation L.2356 in Chamber No. 4 of casemate wall (Phase XlVb) The preliminary publication (Ben-Tor, Portugāli and Avissar 1983: Fig. 6) proposed a reconstruction of the casemate wall as extending southward, with W.94 identified as its inner wall (Square E/32; see plan in Ben-Tor, Portugāli and Avissar 1983). Although W.94 is very fragmentary, the large size of some of its stones, compared to those used in walls of private dwellings, lends some support to this reconstruc- tion. W.94 is not joined to W.273, which was then regarded as a diaphragm wall), nor to the city-wall remains to its north. Upon re-examination, this reconstruction raises certain difficulties, suggesting that the above-mentioned elements should be viewed separately. First, if the northward contin- uation of W.94 as an inner wall of the casemate wall were reconstructed, it would coincide and run on top of several other remains attributed to Stratum XIV (W.273, loci L.2108a+b and a tabun , L.2118; see discussion below). Furthermore, W.273 does not relate to W.94 at all. Moreover, W.273 pre-dates W.267, ascribed to Stratum XIV. It follows that W.94 should be viewed as post-dating Stratum XIV and belonging to Stratum XIII (see discussion of Area B2, below). The drainage channel A drainage channel, ca. 1.5 m wide, L.2023 (Figs. 1.45-48; Photos 1.37-39), is located north of Chamber No. 5 (Squares H/24-25, 1/24-26). Crossing perpendicularly underneath the city wall, it drains water from inside the city (Plan 1.16). The channel is well-built, its sides formed by the diaphragm wall of Chamber No. 5 (W.143) and another wall paralleling</page><page sequence="118">THE IRON AGE IIA Photo 1.37.

Eastern extremity of fortifications; water system in center it to the north (W.92). The channel is paved with large stone slabs, one of which is rectangular, particularly large (0.75 x 1.5 m) and carefully worked. The channel's roofing was exposed only beneath the casemate wall's outer wall (W.142), which is ca. 1.8 m wide at that point. The roofing consists of large stones resting on top of vertical stone slabs, forming two narrow channels. Two stone slabs standing almost vertical (Photo 1.39), found inside an earth fill beyond the city wall's inner line, under the later city wall's foundation (Stratum XII), may be the remains of a further stretch of the channel's roofing. A further extension of the channel (L.1737), exposed beyond the inner face of the later city wall (Stratum XII), is built of small- to medium-sized unhewn stones. No paving was detected on its bottom (Photo 1.40). No evidence was found of any channeling of the drain's outflow into some sort of reservoir outside the city limits. This seems to indicate that the channel's sole purpose was to drain runoff surface water from within the city, mainly during periods of heavy rain, in order to prevent the water 98 from accumulating at the lowest area of the mound's top (in the north), which might have damaged the water system (for discussion of the water system, see below). The northern segment of the city wall North of the drainage channel the city wall turns sharply towards the slope (Squares 1/22-24, Plan 1.16; Photo 1.41). Segments of the wall uncovered here provide no information regarding its character. No chambers were identified, and it is therefore possible that at this spot the city wall turns into a solid structure {ca. 5-6 m thick). The city wall's outer face (W.173) is a continuation of the outer wall of the casemate wall (W.142; Plan 1. 16). 1 The outer face of both city walls - the earlier and the later - do not exactly overlap; W.173 juts out towards the slope (in Square 1/23) and gradually converges with the Stratum XII wall (W.167) in the north. At the meeting point of the two 1 Every wall segment was assigned a number of its own in order to prevent confusion.</page><page sequence="120">THE IRON AGE IIA walls, only one face of a wall segment was exposed (Photo 1.42). The joining point is damaged. The top of the remains along this segment is at a similar elevation as the upper/later city wall. An earth-filled "seam" identified between this wall segment and the earlier wall, W.173, attests that the northern segment is of later date. Moreover, an architectural analysis, which takes into consideration factors such as the manner of construction, the wall thickness, the tower construction and other features, leaves no doubt that the northward extension of this wall belongs to the later city wall (Stratum XII; see Chapter 6). No remains attributable to the earlier city wall were detected near the outer face of the later city wall, beneath the remains discussed above. Such remains may have been washed down the slope. However, several wall segments were observed beneath the inner face of the later city wall, some of them the remnants of the inner face of the early city wall and others which functioned as foundations or retaining walls for the later city wall. On architectural and stratigraphie grounds, W.176 may be attributed to the casemate wall. Photo 1.42. Fortifications encircling water system; note later fortification wall (Stratum XII), here W.167, above W.173 (Stratum XIV casemate wall); note edge of earlier wall THE WATER SYSTEM A large open space was exposed near the northern edge of the excavation area (Squares J/23-24, K/22-24, L/22-23, M/22; Plan 1.16). As only a small portion of it was excavated, its exact nature is yet unknown. However, certain topo- graphic and architectural features suggest that it formed part of a water system. The city wall at this point deviates sharply from the "natural" course of the slope, clearly in order to encircle this shaft and enclose it within the fortifications (Photo 1.41). As both city walls, the earlier as well as the later one, follow a similar course, it is evident that this shaft was already in use at the time of the casemate wall's construction. In addition, the foundations of the two faces of the early city wall along this stretch were found to have been set at significantly different elevations. The foundation of its outer face was at elevation 85.92, whereas its inner face rested on bedrock, at the considerably lower elevation of 82.87. The fact that it was the inner face that was more solidly based suggests greater concern for a possible collapse of the wall into the deep open shaft, rather than towards the slope. Wall segments, exposed beneath the inner face of the later wall, are occasionally somewhat differently angled than the upper wall line. These walls, which functioned in fact as retaining walls for the later city wall, can be divided into the following types: • Walls, such as W.436 (Plan 1.21, foldout), which were constructed as a foundation for the upper city wall. Protrusions and bulges, similar to those on W.436, were observed along the later wall; • Several wall segments, such as W.176, which are attribut- able to the early wall on architectural-stratigraphic grounds and on the evidence of pottery found nearby; • Ancient walls of EB/MB date, such as W.439 and W.430, which were damaged when the shaft was dug; • Supporting walls or repairs of indeterminable date, such as W.399. Bedrock was exposed, within the limits set by the city-wall line, along a stretch ca. 14 m long, followed, after an interruption of ca. 3 m, by a stretch of another 5 m. The irregularly-shaped, elliptical and elongated shaft has one rounded corner and another sharper one, not fully exposed (Photo 1.43). The rock's stepped side descends in a direction opposite to the slope (in the section under discussion, to the east and north). Two steps hewn in the rock were exposed, descending southward (at elevations 84.21/83.89 and 83.77/ 82.87 for the upper and the lower one respectively). When found, the shaft was filled with stratified, variegated deposits, attesting to the presence of still water. The upper layers yielded animal bones and numerous vessels (including amphorae and cooking pots), some of them intact, dating from the Hellenistic period ( Yoqnecam I: 12-13). As exca- vation penetrated deeper the recovered pottery grew increas- ingly older (of Persian and Iron Age II- III dates). The stairway (Plan 1.16) A stairway descending into the shaft was detected in the northern part of the excavation area (Squares L-M/22) and exposed to a depth of 2.5 m (Photos 1.44-45). It continues beneath the tower of the Stratum XII city wall, presumably adjoining the early wall's inner face, hidden beneath the later city wall. Two segments of the stairway were exposed: an upper and a lower one. The upper segment (L.2508) consists of six clearly defined steps descending westward, supported on the south by the two-phase wall W.421a-b. The two phases meet just oppo- site the juncture of the fourth and fifth steps (counting downwards). 99</page><page sequence="121">CHAPTER FOUR Photo 1.43. Inner face of fortifications (view from inside water system) Photo 1.44. Steps leading down into water system (Stratum XIV) The lower segment (L.2509), not as well preserved, con- sists of four slightly sloped steps. Adjoining W.421b on the west, they are supported on bedrock and on W.428, next to it to the east. The latter seems to have been built as an extension of the rock forming the side of the lowest step. Photo 1.45. Stratum XII city wall, on top of steps leading down to water system (Stratum XIV) The function of the shaft Although hardly any excavation has been carried out here, the role of the shaft as a water system can be inferred from the following: 1) it constitutes a relatively large, non-built area (over 300 m2), enclosed within the perimeter formed by the two fortification systems; 2) it is located at the lowest spot of the mound's top; and 3) there are water sources situated nearby (some 100 m north of the tell). The nature of the water system (presumably a shaft reach- ing a spring via a tunnel or ground-water) has not been sufficiently clarified, since only a very limited part has been excavated. The location of the drainage channels to the south of the shaft in both of the fortification systems (in Strata XIV and XII, for the casemate and the gallery wall respec- tively) suggests that the shaft did not function as a water reservoir, as these channels clearly directed the runoff water to beyond the city boundaries, rather than towards the shaft. Although quite common in the Iron Age II, the construc- tion of water systems is not a frequent occurrence in the early part of this period, in the tenth century BCE (see Chapter 8). 100</page><page sequence="122">THE IRON AGE IIA REMAINS NEAR THE CASEMATE WALL In an effort to confirm the date of the construction of the casemate wall, three test pits were dug next to it. The relationship between the remains of the earlier phase (adjac- ent) and of the casemate wall was difficult to ascertain, because of the existence of the later gallery wall (Stratum XII) between them. One of these pits was carried out beyond the Stratum XIV city limits, while two small pits were dug in close proximity within the city boundaries, south of the drainage channel (L.1737), in places where the Stratum XII gallery wall was damaged (Plan 1.13; Photo 1.3). The north- ern pit ( ca . 2 X 2.5 m; Squares H-I/25-26) was excavated directly next to W.84, constituting the drainage channel's southern side up to its intersection with the casemate wall. The other test pit was dug ca. 3.5 m south of the former (Squares G-H/26), abutting the inner wall of the casemate (W.138). The test pits yielded remains abutting the casemate wall from within the city (Stratum XIV), and the northern one also yielded remains pre-dating this wall (Stratum XV). Stratum XV (Plan 1.15 on p. 94) Remains attributed to the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV), pre- dating the construction of the casemate wall, were exposed in two areas: outside and within the line of the later wall. L.1843 In the north-western part of the excavated area (Area A4 west, Squares E-F/26-27; Plan 1.15), the remains include W.147 and W.148, the latter forming a corner with a third wall, of which only one surviving edge was exposed on the slope. These form an elongated room of residential nature. The remains, disassociated and disturbed due to their close proximity to the slope (fill locus L.1843), are nevertheless of considerable stratigraphie significance. Sealed as they are Photo 1.46. Drainage channel (Stratum XII); casemate wall (Stratum XIV), with L.2013 (Stratum XV) underneath by the casemate wall (Chambers Nos. 4 and 5), they clearly pre-date its construction (Plan 1.13; for discussion of the wall, see below). On the other hand, they seal - and therefore post-date - the Iron Age I remains of Stratum XVII (see above, Plan 1.8). As aforementioned, these remains are attributed to Stratum XV. L.2013 Floor L.2013 (Plan 1.15, Squares H-I/25-26; Fig. 1.49), exposed within the city bounds, also pre-dates the casemate wall, further indicating that the wall post-dates Stratum XV. This consists of a packed earth level, with the remains of a tabun , most of which had been destroyed by the construction of W.84, the southern wall of the drainage channel, ascribed to Stratum XIV (Plan 1.16; Photo 1.46). Thus, this phase pre-dates the drainage channel and, as aforementioned, is not associated with the casemate wall. Stratum XIV (Plan 1.16) In the northern test pit, two phases were identified, which can be regarded as contemporaneous with the casemate wall: the lower, L.2011 (Fig. 1.50:21-29), is a layer of stones, and the upper, L.2006 (Fig. 1.50:1-20), a layer of white plaster and ash marks, slightly tilted eastwards.

The rest of the structure (or unit) with which it is associated has not been excavated, with the possible exception of W.306 (Square H/27), which may have formed its south-eastern boundary. The room is built against the inner wall of the casemate, W.138, which forms one of its walls, and is delimited by W.135 and W.152 to the north and east respectively (its southern end is unknown). Two tabuns , L.1859 (incorporating L.1810) and L.1862 (Fig. 1.52:10), are located side by side next to these walls, on a packed-earth level, L.1809 (Figs. 1.51:1-5), resting directly atop the Stratum XVII brick collapse (Photo 1.47). No earlier Iron Age II stages (i.e. Strata XV-XVI) were found in this test pit. THE PIAZZA AND THE AREA TO ITS SOUTH Various remains have been exposed, whose association with the city wall has not yet been investigated. These include the piazza and the area to its south, as well as Area B2 (see below). Since these remains are not connected with those found in adjacent areas, their stratigraphie attribution was established by counting the strata from both ends of our secure stratigraphie sequence: the terminal Iron Age I (Stra- tum XVII) on the one hand, and the gallery wall of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII) on the other. In most cases, the number of identified strata coincides across the various areas, with the exception of the transitional Stratum XVI, characterized by a paucity of remains. However, no corres- pondence was found between the different areas with regard to the number of phases attributable to each stratum, as some of these phases stem from independent developments within each specific area. The correspondences between strata across the various areas were also verified by the examina- tion of the ceramic assemblages ascribed to each of these strata. The terrain in the piazza and the area to its south is particularly strongly tilted to the north and west, with dif- ferent sub-areas showing significant differences in elevation. With regard to the strata under discussion, the piazza and the area to its south are physically disconnected; however, there are several markers allowing linkage between them (see below). In the greater part of this area two clearly defined strata - XV and XIV - were discerned, each containing sev- eral architectural units. The principal area is situated above the Stratum XVI remains and beneath the open space levels of the Stratum XII piazza (Chapter 6). In the area to the south, the excavation only reached as deep as Stratum XV, beneath Building III of the Stratum XII piazza. The remains attributed to Strata XV and XIV include residential structures and courtyards. Stratum XV (Plan 1.15 on p. 94) Structure 2019 Located south of the piazza (Squares G-H/29-30), this structure extends to the west and south, to areas where excavation has not penetrated sufficiently deep to determine its extent. Consisting of fragmentary remains, the structure is represented by the corner of W.96/W.93 and W.91, by a floor, L.2019 (incorporating L.2017; Fig. 1.53), abutting a plastered wall, W.93, and by a tabun , L.2016 (Fig. 1.53: 27-30). W.91 is of non-uniform thickness and incorporates several partly worked stones. This outstanding feature may indicate either the location of the entrance to that unit or the past existence of a row of columns, connected by a thin wall. Remnants of a floor, L.2008 (Fig. 1.53), have been found to the east, along with several stones, probably the remains of a wall delimiting the locus in the north. Additional remains from that phase, L.2004 (incorporating L.2015), found north of W.93, had been badly damaged by the Stratum XIV wall, W.88, and by the Stratum XIII pits situated directly above them (Photo 1.48). Structure 2281 Structure 2281, located in the piazza area (Squares G-H/28-29; Plan 1.15), encompasses a space defined by W.305 in the east and W.156a in the north. W.156a, built of large stones, features a built-up threshold (the doorway apparently having been blocked when W.156 was con- structed, in the later phase, Stratum XIV). The corner of walls W.156a and W.305 is not preserved. The southern end of W.305, built directly on the Stratum XVII destruction layer, incorporates melted burnt bricks. The remains extend- ing further (to the west and south) are situated underneath the Stratum XII city wall. The space is partitioned by W.307 into two paved cells, L.2281 (Fig. 1.54:5-8) in the north and L.2505 (incorporating L.2277) in the south. The latter shows two floor levels (elevations 91.57/47 and 91.74). Courtyard 2282 A courtyard to the east of Structure 2281, L.2282 (incorpo- rating L.2276 and L.2273; Figs. 1.55-56), features a tabun , L.2279 (Fig. 1.54:1-4), and to its north a stone, probably used as a basis for a wooden post (Photo 1.49). It is not known whether the rest of the piazza was inhabited. Ash patches and pits were encountered in its eastern and northern parts (Squares 1/27-29; Plan 1.15), but the relation between these patches and pits is uncertain. L.2159 is one such patch: ca. 15 cm thick and containing numerous bone remains, it may be either a living floor or a fill. Some of the pits, such as L.2158 (Fig. 1.57:1-10) and L.2160, are con- temporaneous with the ash patches; others, such as L.2198 (incorporating L.2197; Fig. 1.57:21-35), are covered by them; and in yet other cases, such as L.2196 (Fig. 1.57: 1 1-14) and L.2199 (Fig. 1.57:36-38), the relation is unclear.

Building III (Phase Xllb); note pits L.1893, L.1894 and L.1895 (Stratum XIII), W.88 (Stratum XIV) and Structure 2019 (Stratum XV) Photo 1.49. Detail of Structure 2273 and tabun L.2279 (Stratum XV) pits and ash patches show no direct stratigraphie link with other Stratum XV remains in the piazza. However, it should be noted that some, in the vicinity of Stratum XIV tabuns L.2152 and L.2153 (Plan 1.16), are superimposed by Stratum XIV remains, and all are situated above the Stratum XVII destruction layer. Hence, and taking into account the eleva- tion at which these remains are situated, they may presum- ably be attributed to the time span of Stratum XV. Stratum XIV (Plan 1.16) The Stratum XIV remains are oriented somewhat differently than those of the preceding stratum. Structure (?) 1897 A wall, W.88, with patches of a packed earth floor on both its sides (Squares G-H/29-30), was exposed south of the piazza. The remains were badly damaged by the Stratum XIII pits (Photo 1.48). The structure includes: L.2010 (Fig. 1.58) 103</page><page sequence="125">CHAPTER FOUR in the north; L. 1719c (Fig. 1.59) in the south-east, consisting of the remains of a round installation, built of small stones; and L.1897 (Fig. 1.58) in the west. Wall W.88 was not preserved here, and excavation of the locus encompassed the disturbed area as well. Apparently, W.144, extending westward along the same course as W.88, should be attributed to the same architectural unit. Structure (?) 1897 is built in the same orientation as Structure 2268 in the north (see below; and Plan 1.16). The distance between W.88 of Structure (?) 1897 and W.304 of Structure 2268 is almost 5 m. As the difference in elevation between the floors of these two structures is nearly 2 m, it can be assumed that there was a terrace wall separating the two structures (although its presumed location has not been excavated). Structure 2268 (Plan 1.16) Structure 2268 (Squares G-I/28-29) is the most prominent structure in the piazza. It consists of L.2268 (Fig. 1.60), with a packed earth floor, which is delimited in the north by W.156 and in the south by W.304. In the east it is largely open towards a wide courtyard, L.2270 (Fig. 1.60), and its western boundary is hidden beneath the later Stratum XII city wall (Plan 1.21, foldout; Photo 1.50). Three installations were uncovered built against its walls. The first, L.2275, was built against W.304 in the passage Photo 1.50. Structure 2268 (Stratum XIV) and gallery wall (Stratum XII) in background 104 from the courtyard to the front space, opposite the eastern end of W.156. It consisted of a semi-circle of stones with a flat stone in its center. Three grinding stones and ajar base were found nearby. The other two installations were built next to each other against W.156. One, L.2272, was a rectangle of stones (its western end not exposed), with jar fragments covering its bottom as if paving it and much ash residue in its north-eastern corner. The third installation, L.2274 (Fig. 1.60:1-3), to the east of L.2272, consisted of relatively small stones composing a circle, on top of which was a jar with its upper part intentionally cut and polished (Fig. 1.60:2). Opposite it, near W.304, a round stone was found, with a hole in its center - perhaps part of a potter's wheel (Fig. 1.60:26). Two entrances in W.304 lead southward onto L.2269. The rather wide ( ca . 2.5 m) westernmost entrance, leading from room L.2268, was found blocked by one course of stones, narrower than the wall's thickness. The other entrance, leading from courtyard L.2270 into the room, is represented by a threshold located by the wall's eastern end. L.2269 (incorporating L.2271 and L.2503; Fig. 1.61) has a packed- earth floor. W.171, to the east of this spot, seems to form a corner with another wall perpendicular to W.304. W.171 is built along much the same line as W.304, except for a slight northward bulge. It is feasible that W.298 delimited the space on the east; however, no direct link was found between W.171 and W.298 (which is at a lower elevation). The remains in the piazza's eastern section are at a higher elevation than those in its western part - probably the result of adjustments to the tell' s topography. A pebble paving, L.2137 (incorporating L.2129), was detected north of W.171, with another floor, L.2139 (incorporating L.2127) south of this wall. A bracelet of entwined bronze and iron, found in the fill directly above the top of W.304 (L.2262; elevation 92.23), should perhaps be associated with the remains of the Stratum XIV Structure 2268. The open space Most of the area north of Structure 2268 was a large open space (Squares J/26, H-J/27 and I- J/28). L.2270, the part of the courtyard adjacent to Structure 2268, was a packed-earth floor. To the north-east, two tabuns were found, L.2152 (Fig. 1.63:31-32) and L.2153 (Fig. 1.63:33), separated by a small wall, W.99 (Square 1/28; Plan 1.16; Photo 1.51). East of this wall, a possible elevated floor was detected, with L.2148 as the upper level (Fig. 1.62:1-16) and L.2155 (including an ash patch, L.2154) as the lower one (Figs. 1.62-63). To the west of W.99, a single floor was identified, L.2152 (Figs. 1.62-63). North-east of this spot two segments of paving, L.2185 and L.2218, were encountered, made of uniform pebbles and separated by a patch of brown clay, which also functioned as a foundation for the paving. The same clay layer was also noted in L.2184, south of paving L.2185. No direct associ-</page><page sequence="126">THE IRON AGE IIA Photo 1.51. Tabum L.2152 and L.2153 (Stratum XIV) ation was found between the paved sections and the tabun area, but the pottery recovered in both areas is Iron Age IIA in date. Two arrowheads, one of bronze and the other of iron, were recovered on these floors (L.2184 and L.2218). The paved sections are in close proximity to the drainage channel, L.1737, adjoining the casemate wall, and may have been associated with it. Wall segments W.306 and W.308, exposed several meters further west, probably belong to structures located to the west and north. The area to the north has not been excavated to the depth of the strata discussed here, whereas the rest of the area is very disturbed. No floors associated with these walls were identified. Some of the Stratum XIV remains were exposed in and south of the piazza, superimposed by a thin layer of ash. AREA B2 Area B2 is stratigraphically unrelated to the areas adjacent to it (the piazza and the fortifications; Squares E-F/31-32). As in the case of the piazza (see above), the relationship of the remains to the city wall has not yet been revealed. The stratigraphie sequence was determined on the basis of local stratification and comparisons of the ceramic assemblages with those recovered from the other excavation areas. Stratum XV (Plan 1.15 on p. 94) Structure 2003 The exposed area in this Stratum XV structure is relatively small and the architectural elements encountered here in- clude: two well-worked rectangular column bases, which probably functioned as dividers between the two spaces in the structure; a packed earth floor around the column bases, L.1749, L.2003 and L.2534 (incorporating L.2001a; Figs. 1.64-65; Photo 1.52). The area to the south-east was dam- aged by a pit penetrating from Stratum XIV (L.1750; Plan 1.19). Two wall segments (separated by the Stratum XIV wall W.267; Plan 1.16), exposed in the southern part of the area, probably belong to the same wall: W.273. It is feasible that this early wall, located ca. 2.7 m from the column bases, is contemporaneous with them and constituted the boundary of the southern space (although it is equally likely that it was Photo 1.52. Area B2: view of Iron Age I and IIB (Strata XVII-XII) remains associated with other early remnants, such as Stratum XVII remains, the differences in elevation being the result of terracing). The ceramic assemblage from this stratum in Area B2 may be mixed. 105</page><page sequence="127">CHAPTER FOUR Plan 1.19. Phase XIYb, Area B2 Stratum XIV (Plans 1.16, 1.19) Structure 2108 The new Stratum XIV structure L.2108 erected here shows some degree of continuity in orientation with the earlier structure (2003; cf. Plan 1.15). An inner wall of Structure 2108 continues the line of the Stratum XV column bases. The structure's remains, however fragmentary, elucidate certain aspects of its plan. It may perhaps be reconstructed as a structure of the "four-room house" type. Three adjacent spaces may be identified, possibly the three front rooms of such a structure (Photo 1.53). The southern one is delimited in the north by W.268 (whose western end is not clearly discernable, the area being disturbed). This space is divided into two or three rooms by partitioning walls, W.267 in the west and W.441 in the east. The floor was of packed earth. 106 The central space of the house, L.2108, is delimited by W.268 in the south, W.442 in the east (perhaps the struc- ture's outer wall) and W.272 in the north. Entrance into L.2108 was gained from the east, through an opening in W.442. The rear broadroom that one would expect to find in such a structure is not discernable; it may be buried under the inner wall of the gallery wall. Two floors were unearthed in Structure 2108, including elevation of floors. The lower level (Plan 1.19) is represented in the central and northern space by a packed earth floor, L.2108b (incor- porating L.1734) and L.2112 (incorporating L. 1744a; Figs. 1.66-67). In the northern space, a tabun , L.2118, was un- earthed next to the western boundary of the structure. A pit, L.1750 (incorporating L.1997), was exposed in the east, filled with stones, earth and large quantities of ash. A number of vessels were found on the floor, along with several patches D E F /' 9i16^3 iv/ ' / / 1 I S / / ; / / a 30 ' r-vL / 1 ^ * - ' , "/Q/ -,/ / ^ - N &lt;o ' iU=V / / // ^ S' &lt;o iU=V / / // / I / // ^ / / 4 I ,/ I _J / 0 2m.

In the southern space, a packed-earth floor was found, L.1726 (Fig. 1.68:1-4). The upper level (Plan 1.16) also consists of a packed-earth floor, L.2108a (incorporating L.1728 and L.2100b; Figs. 1.68-69), with a tabun , L.2514, built in the east, next to W.423, in the northern and central spaces, and a packed- earth floor, L.2107, in the south. The existence of two phases of the same building, along with pottery and concentrations of ash in the lower phase, is a local phenomenon unknown from other areas of exca- vation. The fact that the wall tops surrounding the upper level were preserved up to an elevation of 95.86/82/75/50 rules out the possibility that the upper level is in fact the result of a later leveling of the area. CONCLUSIONS The Iron IIA settlement at Tel Yoqnecam exhibits a lengthy, gradual process of development, from Stratum XVI to Stra- tum XIV (Table 1.3). The initial stage of the renewed settlement, Stratum XVI, was exposed in only one area, the piazza, and is characterized by meager remains of an ephemeral occupation: floors, installations and the like, but with no permanent structures. The rather significant differences between the ceramic as- semblages dated to the time of the city's destruction at the end of Stratum XVII (Iron Age I) and those recovered from the Stratum XVI floors indicate that there was a hiatus following the Stratum XVII destruction before the site was re-occupied. Stratum XV represents a permanent settlement, the re- mains of which were exposed in several areas of excavation, showing a similar overall character: dwellings (some with courtyards) featuring two-stone-wide walls and column bases (circular or rectangular). Stratum XIV represents a further stage in this process, Photo 1.53. Remains of dwellings (W.264) and gallery wall (Stratum XII); note remains of earlier walls (Stratum XIV Structure 2108) beneath during which the settlement evolved into a city fortified by a massive casemate wall and possessing a water system. Walls and cooking installations built against the city wall indicate the absence of a perimeter street adjacent to it. New dwellings occasionally show a degree of continuation from the Stratum XV remains. Repairs and alterations are evident both in the city wall and residential structures, on occasions practically constituting two separate phases, a lower one (b) and an upper one (a), indicative of Stratum XIV' s fairly long duration. The relatively large number of vessels encountered on the floors of the dwellings and the casemate-wall chambers seems to suggest that Stratum XIV met its demise suddenly, despite the fact that no clear evidence was found of a conflagration or other violent destruction (ash marks and charcoal remains were detected almost exclusively in the vicinity of tabuns).

Its meager remains include pits, floor segments and wall remains in the southern area (Plan 1.20). No complete or even nearly complete structure was encountered, and there are clearly no grounds for suggesting that it had been fortified. The unearthed remains suggest an interruption in the permanent settlement of the tell, at least in its exca- vated part, during that period. The Stratum XIII remains have been exposed south of the piazza (Squares G-H/29-30) and in Area B2 (Squares E-F/32). Although the two areas are not adjacent, the re- mains were attributed to the same stratum on the basis of the stratigraphie analysis. SOUTH OF THE PIAZZA The entire stratigraphie sequence of Strata XV-XI has been encountered in this area. The Stratum XIII remains include a rather large number of pits, L.1893, L.1894, L.1895, L.1896, L.1899 (?) and L.2022 (Figs. 1.70-71), as well as floor sections, L. 17 16b and L. 1745a (Fig. 1.72; Section F-F). The nature of the relationship between the pits and the floors could not be clarified sufficiently at the time of excavation. The floors are slightly lower than the top of the pits to their west, but somewhat higher than pit L.2022 in the south, a difference that can probably be ascribed to the sloping terrain. No structural remains that could be associated with the pits or the floors were found. Photo 1.54. Detail of Buildings III-II (Phases Xllb-XIIa) and fill (L.1732 and L.1725) of Stratum XIII Most of the pits were filled with soft, dark gray material, containing organic residue, ash, bones, some brick material and stones. The shallow pit L.1896 was filled with stones. Section F-F'.

In between the remains there are two loci (pits?), L.1725 and L.1732, similar in character to the pits discussed above. They consist of a fill of soft soil and small stones and are separated from each other by a heap of stones (Plan 1.20; situated above the Stratum XIV wall W.88; Fig. 1.73). No floors were detected in either of these loci. Their attribution to Stratum XIII, based upon their resemb-lance to other pits of that stratum, is uncertain. Two faience objects - the head of a bearded man (L.1732; Fig. 1.74:1; Photo 1.55) and a body fragment of a Bes fragment standing on a lotus flower (L.1725; Fig. 1.74:2; see Chapter 24, Photo III. 17) - originate from these two loci. Another object, a faience wdjat eye (Fig. 1.58: 10; see Chapter 26, Fig. 111.25:19, Photo III.38) was found nearby, in the fill of L.1897, whose floor was ascribed to Stratum XIV (Chap- ter 4, Plan 1.16). The three objects seem to belong to the same context, although found at somewhat different eleva- tions (93.69, 93.85 and 93.95 respectively). AREA B2 Like the remains found south of the piazza, the Stratum XIII remains in Area B2 (Squares E-F/32) are unrelated to earlier or later remains: they pre-date the Stratum XII gallery wall (being at a lower elevation than the base of W.212, the inner wall of the gallery wall; Plan 1.21) and are clearly not related to Stratum XIV Structure 2108 (Plan 1.16). A packed earth floor, L.2100a (incorporating L.1712a; Plan 1.20; Figs. 1.75-76), was exposed, as well as several wall fragments near the area's eastern edge, belonging either to this stratum or to the later phase of Stratum XIV. A bronze object (Fig. 1.76:25; see Chapter 25, Photo III.21) was found on this floor. It has applied decorations depicting facial features: a nose(?) ending in a five-fingered palm(?) and a pair of spiral-shaped eyes. A similar object has been found Photo 1.55. Figurine head in a ninth-century BCE context at "En Gev (Mazar et al. 1964: 27, Fig. 11:11, Pl. 12e) (for discussion of the bronze object found at Tel Yoqnecam, see Chapter 25). CONCLUSIONS Stratum XIII represents an ephemeral settlement, remains of which were unearthed in the northern section of the tell. On the assumption that the excavated area faithfully represents the entire mound, the remains of this stratum, which include a wall segment, floor patches and pits, attest to an interrup- tion in the sequence of permanent occupation of the site. The few remnants exposed display no relationship to pre- or post-dating remains (Stratum XIV or XII; see Table 1.4). Stratum XIII may perhaps be regarded as an initial stage in the development of the later permanent settlement (Stratum XII), much the same as the developmental process that took place between Strata XVI and XIV (for further discussion, see Chapter 8).

This stratum (dated to the second half of the ninth century through the eighth century BCE) features a massive city wall, a water system and a perimeter street running next to the city wall, with dwellings arranged along it, and an open square - a Photo 1.56. Fortifications (Strata XIV and XII; view to south-west) piazza - allowing direct access to the various architectural units. The following discussion is organized according to architectural units: • The fortifications (Squares D-E/30-32, E-F/28-29, F/30, G/28, F-H/26-27, 1/26, H-J/25, 1-J/22-24, K-M/21-22); • The water system (Squares I-M/22-25); • Dwellings in the north (Squares G-H/29-31); • Dwellings in the south (Square F/32); • The perimeter street and the piazza. THE FORTIFICATIONS The Iron Age IIB fortifications consist of a city wall with an unusual layout (the "gallery wall") and with tower-like buttresses, a drainage channel and possibly a postern gate. The gallery wall The superstructure of the Stratum XII city wall consists of two parallel walls, the outermost W.200 (2.00-2.20 m thick) and the innermost W.212 (1.60-1.80 m thick), separated by a long, narrow, undivided space (Squares D-E/30-32, E-F/28-29, F/30, G/28, F-H/26-27, 1/26, H-J/25, I-J/ 22-24, K-M/21-22), which afforded protected passage (Photos 1.2, 1.56). These two parallel walls are built of medium to large undressed stones. Both have offsets at the same location on their exterior faces, at 7-11 m intervals, each ca. 2.8 m wide, projecting ca. 0.50 m from the wall's face. The combined thickness of these two walls is ca. 5.20-5.60 m and up to 6.50 m including the offsets. Extend- ing for a length of over 38 m, the area between the two walls forms an uninterrupted gallery {ca. 1.5 m wide), with a packed earth floor, L.1967 (incorporating L.1535 and L.1965), L.1777 and L.1792 (Figs. 1.77-79). To overcome the steep terrain, several terrace walls were constructed perpendicular to the city wall, forming a retain- ing structure (W.122) for the stepped stone foundation under- lying the gallery's floor and quite possibly for small wooden stairways as well. The gallery floor, inclining moderately northward across the terraces, shows considerable differ- ences in elevation along its length, declining ca. 3.5 m over a distance of 16 m. The gallery was accessed through entrances set at intervals along the wall and opening on the perimeter street. One such entrance, L.1968 (Squares E-F/30; Photos 1.57-58), leads via two steps into the passage between the walls; another is 184</page><page sequence="206">THE IRON AGE IIB Photo 1.57. Detail of entrance into intra-mural area (L.1968) located opposite the piazza (Square H/27). Another segment of the gallery wall was detected in Area D in the north-eastern section of the tell, suggesting that the gallery wall encompassed the entire site (Ben-Tor and Rosenthal 1978; for discussion of the architectural plan of the gallery wall and possible parallels, see Chapter 8). The tower-like buttresses The city wall features particularly large, rectangular tower- like buttresses, two of which were exposed in the excavated area. The southern one (W.115; Squares F/27, G/26-28, H/25-27), ca. 13.5 m wide, protrudes ca. 1.6-2.0 m from the wall line towards the slope, with a parallel projection jutting out ca. 0.5 m in the opposite direction (Photo 1.3). This inward-facing projection is built only against the south- ernmost part of the "tower", the northern part of which is flush with the wall. The remains at this spot are badly preserved; however, it seems most likely that there was a narrow passage (a postern) in the tower, allowing access into the gallery, L.1792, and from there, by an indirect passage, into the city. The proximity of this presumed postern to the water sources north of the tell gives rise to the suggestion that it may have functioned as a water gate. The other tower-like buttress (Squares K-M/20-21) was exposed at the northern edge of the excavated area, north of the water system, but is only partially preserved. Its south- western and north-eastern corners, exposed in W.430 and W.25 respectively, point to similar dimensions as the south- ern buttress, discussed above. The drainage channel A drainage channel, L.1723 (incorporating L.1730 and L.1845) and L.1851 (Squares H-I/26, G-H/25; Figs. 1.80-81; Photos 1.59-60), is integrated in the city wall, north of the southern tower. Such a channel is of crucial impor- tance at this low-lying location, as it drains all runoff from the top of the mound. Other drains, incorporated in the city Photo 1.58. Gallery wall (Stratum XII); note entrance into intra- mural area and plastered street walls of other strata, have been encountered nearby (Stratum XIV, L.2023, Plan 1.16; and Stratum III, attributed to the Crusader period, see Yoqneam I: 20, Photo IV. 10 there). As no evidence was found to suggest that the water drained from within the city was channeled into a reservoir, it seems that the main purpose was to divert surface water and to prevent it from accumulating against the side walls of the water system's shaft (see Chapter 8). The narrow and relatively shallow Stratum XII channel (&lt; ca . 0.75-1.00 m wide and less than 0.50 m deep) is stone-paved along a stretch ca. 11.5 m long. The channel is bounded on its southern side by the tower's northern wall (W.136) and subsequently extends north-westward beyond the city-wall line (W.139). W.140, paralleling it on the north, forms the channel's other side wall. The channel's roof, preserved only underneath the external side of the city wall (W.200), consists of stone slabs supported by two vertical slabs. The roofing {ca. 1.8-2.0 m wide) is as wide as the outer wall of the gallery wall. From here on, the channel was not preserved up to the height of the roofing; it is thus impossible to determine whether the channel had been roofed at this point. The northern segment of the city wall In the northern part of the excavated area, shortly past the drainage channel, the city wall (W.167 and W.172) turns sharply towards the slope of the tell (Plan 1.21; Photos 1.2, 1.41). This bend stemmed from the need to include the shaft of the water system within the confines of the fortified city, as evident by the dovetailing (Square J/25) of the city wall corner (W.172 and W.212) and the quarried rock (for a discussion of the water system and its relation to the two city walls, see below). This section of the city wall was preserved only up to the height of the foundation courses, and its width decreases from at least 5 m to 3.75 m. As the wall's superstructure has not survived, it cannot be unequivocally determined whether the gallery extended 185</page><page sequence="207">CHAPTER SIX Photo 1.59. Drainage channel (Stratum XII; view from inside city) Photo 1.60. Drainage channel (Stratum XII; view from outside city) along this stretch as well. The low height of the walls at this point should not exclude this possibility, since they may have been particularly badly eroded. On the other hand, it is quite possible that topographic constraints compelled the fortifi- cation builders to construct it as a solid wall at this location. It should be borne in mind that if indeed this structural transformation took place, it occurred at the spot where the wall turns sharply outward, enclosing the water system's shaft. At this location the high-rising wall was completely free-standing, devoid of any support on its inner side, facing the deep shaft. It stands to reason that all the necessary steps were taken to lend it extra strength at this critical spot in order to avoid its possible collapse into the shaft. Some 11m further north, the wall ( ca . 5 m thick along this segment) turns sharply to the north-east, running along a distance of ca. 22 m (W.326). No further extension is discernable beyond that point, and it is presumed that the wall made a backward turn at that point, towards the mound's center. The northern tower-like buttress mentioned above is integrated in the north-eastern end of this wall segment. The earlier casemate wall (Stratum XIV) and the later gallery wall (Stratum XII) are not quite parallel: their outer faces gradually converge towards an abutment in the north, at which point only one face of the city wall (W.326) has been exposed (see also Chapter 4). An earth-filled "seam" identified at the point where W.326 meets the early city wall (W.173; Plan 1.16, foldout) shows at least two different building phases. An architectural analysis, which considers features such as the manner of construction, the wall thick- ness and the nature of the tower construction, leaves no doubt that the northward extension of W.326 belongs to the later Stratum XII city wall. Residue of a light-colored plaster coating, which must have covered the steep slope at the foot of the city wall, was sporadically detected, in L.2194 (Squares H-I/24), L.1817 (Squares E-F/28) and the packed-earth floor L.1929 (Square D/30). This coating was probably intended to divert rainwater, preventing it from penetrating into the wall's foundation at these vulnerable locations. Similar use of plaster coating was encountered in Iron Age fortification systems elsewhere, such as at Hazor and Beer Sheva (Beit Arieh 1973: 31). THE WATER SYSTEM The water system, first encountered in Stratum XIV (see Chapter 4), continues in use in Stratum XII (Squares I-M/22-25; Plan 1.21). This is attested by the fact that it is clearly integrated into the fortification system erected in this stratum: the gallery wall encloses the shaft within the city's fortifications (Photos 1.41, 1.43). In addition to the new city wall, there are several other changes in the vicinity of the water system, which are attributable to Stratum XII: • The new city wall eliminates the Stratum XIV flight of steps leading down into the water system (Photos 1.44-45). This was presumably replaced by another access way, located in a hitherto unexcavated area. • South of the shaft, at the location where the city wall turns sharply towards the slope, the wall (W.172) forms the south-western boundary of the shaft. The wall's inner face forms an angle at this spot. 186</page><page sequence="208">THE IRON AGE IIB • Various wall segments, occasionally deviating somewhat from the line of the city wall, are discernable beneath the inner face of the later city wall. Some, e.g. W.436, functioned as foundations, while others served as retain- ing walls for the later city wall. THE DWELLINGS IN THE NORTH As the excavation focused on the fortification line, close to the mound's edge, only a few remains of dwellings have been encountered, including one structure - almost fully exposed - in the north and part of another to the south (see below), both adjacent to the perimeter street running parallel to the city wall (Plan 1.21). Two clearly distinguishable phases of Stratum XII, desig- nated Xllb and Xlla, were observed in the residential area. The transformed interior plans evident in the dwelling units stand in contrast to the continuity evident in the city plan, in the fortifications and the open spaces. Three buildings were identified in the northern residential area (Squares F-H/29-31), built one over the other. The two earlier ones (Buildings III and II), associated with the gallery wall, were assigned to Stratum XII (Phases Xllb and Xlla, Plan 1.21), whereas Building I, the latest of the three, seems to have been in existence when the city wall had already gone out of use and was therefore assigned to Stratum XI (see Chapter 7, Plan 1.22 on p. 220). It is assumed that this structure post-dates the city wall, although this assumption is based mainly on comparisons of the ceramic material recovered from the floors of Building I with that found on the floors of the gallery. Phase Xllb (Plan 1.21, inset) Building III Building III, erected above the Stratum XIII pits (Section F-F on p. 169), was free-standing on at least two sides. Built parallel to the perimeter street, its entrance is through the northern wall (W.275a), which faces the piazza. The struc- ture is squarish, its south-western corner somewhat irregular; each of its sides - W.78 in the east, W.275a in the north, W.261a in the west and W.74 in the south - is ca. 9 m long (Photo 1.48). The structure is a "four-room house", typical of contemporary dwellings (see, e.g., Shiloh 1970; Netzer 1992: 193-199). The front space is divided into three rooms by W.73 in the east and W.75 in the west, with two column bases continuing the line of the latter. These rooms consist of: • A relatively narrow space in the east (L. 17 19b, ca. 1.6 m wide), badly damaged by later pits; • A central space, L.1746, where the building was entered (incorporating L. 17 16a and L.2007; Figs 1.82-83). Some 2.5 m in width, this is the broadest of the structure's inner rooms. It is not clear whether it was roofed (Netzer 1992: 195-199). Several installations, such as a tabun , L.1898 (Fig. 1.82:21,35), located next to the entrance, and a grinding stone (or perhaps a potter's wheel), illustrate the activities that might have taken place here. A rather shallow pit filled with stones, L.2002, was located next to the south-eastern corner; • A space in the west, L.1706, open to the central space except for the two columns, which, as aforementioned, continue the line of a solid wall, W.75, further south. The space is stone-paved over a white lime foundation and may alternatively have functioned as an animal pen. Paved rooms, separated from a central space by means of col- umns, are common in structures of similar plan (Braemer 1982: 138); • The rear space is divided into at least two (L.1717, incorporating L.1741, and L.1707), and possibly three, cells (it is partitioned by W.75, and it is possible that W.73 too extends further in the hitherto unexcavated part of this space (Fig. 1.84). The central space, L.1717, may also have been partitioned laterally by W.81. No clearly discernible floor was identified. Phase Xlla (Plan 1.21) Building II In the course of Stratum XII, the "four-room house" was replaced by another structure, Building II, the reconstructed exterior of which shifted slightly southward. It consists of W.275 in the north and W.261 in the west. In the south, W.262 was erected on top of the earlier wall, W.74, which forms its foundation. The eastern wall was barely preserved (Photo 1.61). To the north of W.275, the top of an earlier wall, W.275a (Building III, Phase Xllb) was incorporated in the paving of the later phase, Xlla, in front of the entrance (Photo 1.62). The interior, totally different in plan from that of Building III, consists of an entrance space and two other spaces, one to the rear and the other lateral. These spaces are delimited Photo 1.61. Building II (Phase Xlla) and peripheral street 187</page><page sequence="209">CHAPTER SIX Photo 1.62. North-western corner of Buildings III- II (Phases Xlla-XIIb) and later walls by three walls, of varying nature and lengths: W.269 and W.80 (running along the same line from north to south) and W.274 (running east to west). The entrance was shifted further west, leading through the entrance space (L.2093b; Fig. 1.85:6-22). A rectangular pivot stone was found inside the entrance. The floor is of packed earth, with a patch paved in small stones integrated in it and L.2110 forming its foundation. The entrance room opens onto the lateral room, L.2099 in the south-east, and the rear room, L.2098, in the south-west (Figs. 1.86-87). The floors of this phase are particularly problematic: most were not detected in the course of excavation and were determined only after the processing of the recovered mate- rial, based on the elevations at which intact pottery had been found. These floors are ca. 30 cm higher than that of the entrance space, L.2093b, and ca. 30 cm lower than the wall bases of the Stratum XI Building I. The area was badly damaged by later pits, and it is likely that pottery attributed to the Phase Xlla floors may have originated in these pits: from the Stratum XI Building I or even later. Evidently, no uncontaminated representative assemblage is available from the Phase Xlla Building II. THE DWELLINGS IN THE SOUTH Some 4.5 m to the south (Square F/32), remains have been found of what is probably the edge of another dwelling, the greater part of which extends eastward and southward in an area not yet excavated. These remains reveal two clearly distinguishable architectural stages attributed to Phases Xllb and Xlla, as in the case of the northern structure.1 Phase Xllb (Plan 1.21, inset) L.2101 The remains include the corner of W.265 and W.264. This corner, built of small undressed stones, forms the boundary of a floor, L.2101 (incorporating L.1708; Figs. 1.88-89), with a tabun , L.2102 (the foundation of the tabun was designated as L.1710; Photo 1.53). To the west lies the perimeter street, designated L.2097 at this spot (Fig. 1.90; Photo 1.63). The area to the north of these remains (Squares F-H/31) is severely disturbed, and its nature in Stratum XII cannot be securely determined. W.95, two segments of which were exposed, is unrelated to the Phase Xllb remains north or south of it. The abutment of W.95 and the corner of Building III are destroyed; however, it seems that the former was cut through by W.262 of Building II (Phase Xlla). Photo 1.63. Area B2: view or two phases or Stratum XII dwelling (on right), street L.2097 and gallery wall on left Phase Xlla (Plan 1.21) L.2085 During this phase, new walls were erected a short distance from those of the preceding phase, maintaining the distinc- tion between private and public areas. W.256 delimits a packed-earth floor, L.2085 (Fig. 1.92:1-6), with a tabun , 1 The area excavated within the southern structure was particularly small, yielding small quantities of pottery. It was therefore decided to group this pottery together with that recovered from the street level directly abutting the structure's outer wall (Figs. 1.90, 1.92). 188</page><page sequence="210">THE IRON AGE IIB L.2086, on it; all these features are attributed to Phase Xlla (Photo 1.63). This unit is abutted on the west by the perimeter street, designated L.2069 at this point (Fig. 1.92:7-41). THE PERIMETER STREET AND PIAZZA Stratum XII shows evidence of a perimeter street running parallel to the fortifications, providing access to the various sectors in the north-western part of the tell (Areas A and B2): the fortifications, the water system and the dwellings (Plan 1.21). The northern edge of the perimeter street in this area converges with the piazza, leading to the postern in the fortifications and possibly to the water system bordering the piazza on the north (the entrance to the water system has not been exposed). Floors of various levels were encountered in the streets and piazza, attesting to a relatively long period of use. The terrain is particularly steep in this area and the floors are of sharp and irregular inclination. Due to the problematicky of findings recovered from these open spaces, only a few findings were represented in Fig. 1.91. Next to the southern entrance to the city wall (Area B2), the terrain is less steep and it was hence easier to note a division between the two phases of the Stratum XII street (Figs. 1.90, 1.92:7-41). CONCLUSIONS Stratum XII represents a well-planned city, with fortifica- tions that include a gallery wall and towers, a perimeter street and a piazza, as well as newly-planned domestic dwellings. The use of the water system was resumed in this stratum (assuming there had been an occupational gap preceding it). The stratigraphie sequence of Strata XIV (the Iron Age IIA), XIII (the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period) and XII (the Iron Age IIB) is represented in Table 1.5. Stratum XII is of long duration, adhering throughout to the original allocation of public areas. Private dwellings, on the other hand, show significant changes over time. Two clearly discernable phases, Xllb and Xlla, are illustrated by Buildings III and II: both occupy more or less the same area (although the Phrase Xlla structure is slightly further to the south), but the inner division undergoes significant changes in the later phase. As aforementioned, Stratum XII is dated to the Iron Age IIB, apparently from the second half of the ninth century, coming to an end during the eighth century BCE, probably during the 732 BCE Assyrian conquest by Tiglath-pileser III. However, in the absence of any indication of destruction, the precise circumstances of this (temporary) interruption cannot be determined. Table 1.5.

Its remains are meager and fragmentary, probably reflecting the relatively sparse occupation of the site at that time, as well as the intensive building activities in later periods. The remains that are clearly attributable to Stratum XI are scattered throughout Areas A and B, disassociated from one another. These include: • Meager remains above the ruins of the gallery wall (Squares D/31-32, G/28, H-I/25-26); • A structure designated Building I, erected above the remains of the Phase Xlla Building II (Squares G/29, F-H/30, F-G/31). REMAINS ABOVE THE GALLERY WALL Scanty remains, including several tabuns and wall segments, superimposed over the ruins of the gallery wall, clearly indicate that the Stratum XII city wall no longer existed in Stratum XI. These remains consist of the following: • A packed earth floor, L.1721, with two tabuns , L.1718 and L.1720 (Squares H-I/25-26; Photo 1.64). This patch is located by the mound's slope, and the material recov- ered from it showed indications of later disturbances (from the Persian, Hellenistic and Early Islamic periods); • A corner of W.126 and W.127, delimiting a fill, L.1806, with no clearly detectable floor (Square G/28). Other parts of the structure, extending down the slope, have been destroyed; • W. 1037, built on top of the inner face of W.200 (the outer wall of the gallery wall; Squares D/31-32). The dating of this wall is uncertain: it may belong either to Stratum XI (terminal Iron Age) or to Strata X-IX (the Persian period). THE AREA SOUTH OF THE PIAZZA The remains of Building I were unearthed here (Squares G/29, F-H/30, F-G/31; Plan 1.22). Extensive building activ- ities during the Persian period entailed the division of the area into two terraces, the southern one higher than the Photo 1.64. Tabuns 1718 and 1720 (Stratum XI) northern one, leading to the better preservation of the south- ern part of Building I. Built directly above Building II (Phase Xlla), the plan of Building I is indeterminable. The struc- ture's outer frame (in its southern part) is outlined by W.262 in the south and W.261 in the west, built in Stratum XII. Photo 1.65. Pottery from L.2098 and 2099 218</page><page sequence="240">THE IRON AGE III The interior underwent partial changes: W.80 was cancelled and replaced by W.263; W.274, in contrast, continued in use from Stratum XII. Floor L.1992 and fill L.1985 (Fig. 1.93) were exposed in the south-west, with indications of an eastern extension of this floor, L.2088 (Fig. 1.93), north of W.263. The area further on is damaged. Possible traces of a floor, L.2093a (Fig. 1.85:1-5), were detected on the north-western side. Pits dug in Building I must have pene- trated and disturbed the Stratum XII Building II, judging by some pottery found in the latter (L.2098, L.2099 and L.2093a-b; cf. Plan 1.21, foldout), which in all probability is intrusive from Building I (e.g., an "Assyrian" flask, Fig. 1.86:5; Photo 1.65). This assemblage was designated as XII/XI in the quantitative analysis (see Chapter 9). The northern part of Building I, located on the lower of the two Persian terraces, is too badly damaged to permit any reconstruction. W.266 and L.2078 and L.2076 (Plan 1.22), exposed here, yielded a greatly mixed ceramic assemblage (Fig. 1.94), due to their proximity to remains of Persian date. CONCLUSIONS Although the poor state of preservation of the Stratum XI remains makes it impoosible to determine the nature of the settlement, it is quite clear that Tel Yoqnecam was inhabited in the course of the seventh and/or sixth centuries BCE. The stratigraphie sequence of Strata XII (the Iron Age IIB) and XI (the Iron Age III) is represented in Table 1.6. The Iron Age III settlement was unfortified, as attested by the remains of several tabuns overlying the ruins of the Stratum XII gallery wall. However, some of the previous dwellings seem to have been reconstructed for further use, as in the case of Building I, which was erected directly over the Stratum XII Building II, preserving its original outline.

The thick layers of the post-Iron Age (see Yoqnecam I) have made it difficult to expose the Iron Age remains. For this reason, the excavation of the earlier periods was restricted to the north-western part of the mound, close to the slope. The main effort was devoted to the exposure of the city fortifications of Strata XIV and XII (attributed to the Iron Age IIA and B, tenth-eighth centuries BCE); con- sequently, only modest attention was given to the excavation areas inside the city walls (dwellings, administrative struc- tures, etc.). The following is a consideration of the architectural and urban features of the site, which may contribute to an understanding of the development of the Iron Age settlement at Tel Yoqnecam. THE FORTIFICATIONS The renewed settlement at Tel Yoqnecam in the Iron Age (Stratum XVIII), following its destruction in the Bronze Age, is characterized by its lack of fortifications. This situation continued until Stratum XIV, when a casemate wall was first constructed around the city. Tel Yoqnecam is not the only site to be unfortified during the Iron Age I and the early Iron Age IIA: this was characteristic of many other sites in the Land of Israel, including the northern valleys. During that period, a "belt" of dwellings circumscribing the settlement served as its main defensive line (see Herzog 1992: 269; 1997: 211; Mazar 1990: 388). Similarly, the construction of the casemate wall at Tel Yoqnecam during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV, Plan 1.16), in the tenth century BCE, is consistent with the pattern of city-plan development in the Iron Age evident elsewhere in the Land of Israel, such as at Hazor Stratum X ( Hazor II: 1-3; Ben-Tor and Ben- Ami 1998: 3ff.) and Gezer Stratum VIII (Dever 1993a: 505; 1993b: 37). Casemate walls are a very common type of fortification in the Iron Age IIA (Shiloh 1978: 44; 1987: 8ff.; Yadin 1979: 228; Mazar 1990: 388, 465; Herzog 1992: 269; 1997: 220). The casemate wall at Tel Yoqnecam is irregular in width (minimum width: ca. 5 m). Its walls (the external, inner and diaphragm walls) are relatively thick, varying between 1.60-1.80 m (for further details, see discussion of Stratum XIV, Chapter 4). The similarity in thickness between the external and other walls of the casemate is an unusual feature: the outer wall of a casemate fortification is generally about one-third thicker than the inner wall (see, e.g., Hazor II: 2, Pl. CXCIX; Beit Arieh 1973: 31). The city wall constructed at Tel Yoqnecam can be classified as Herzog's "integrated casemate wall" (Herzog 1992: 269), in which dwellings were built abutting the city wall, with no perimeter street between them, such as at Beersheba Stratum III (Herzog 1992: 269). The casemate wall was in use at Tel Yoqnecam only in Stratum XIV, with the Stratum XIII settlement no longer fortified. The city's fortifications were rebuilt only in Stra- tum XII, with an impressive system termed the "gallery wall" (see Chapter 6, Plan 1.21, foldout). This city wall consists of two parallel walls (the outermost 2.00-2.20 m thick and the innermost 1.60-1.80 m thick), separated by a long narrow passageway - a gallery (ca. 1.5 m in width). The fortifica- tions were built on what was presumably a solid stone infrastructure, running under the two parallel walls as well as under the intervening passageway. A few offsets were incorporated in both walls composing the city wall, including some particularly large offsets resembling rectangular tow- ers, which defended the city wall's more vulnerable points. There may have been a narrow postern in one, serving as a "water gate". The incorporation of offsets in the city wall offers it more stability (Herzog 1992: 270-271). The width of the city wall ranges between 5.20-5.60 m, reaching 6.50 m at the offsets (see Chapter 6). The passageway is not interrupted by any internal division. The gallery wall ensures safe passage between the two walls (in addition to the open perimeter street running adjacent to the inner face of the city wall). The city wall did not survive to its full height. Nonetheless, one may surmise that the passageway was roofed and that the top of the city wall probably served as a uniform surface. The gallery wall is exceptional among the fortifications of this period excavated to date. It is possible that a few of the solid city walls exposed in other sites, of which only the foundation courses survived, may originally have supported similar gallery walls. Thus, in light of the discovery of the gallery wall at Tel Yoqnecam, the fortification system un- covered at Gibeon and the newly discovered wall at Tel Rehov (Mazar 2003: Fig. 8) should be reexamined. The excavator of Gibeon identified two systems - an inner and 225</page><page sequence="247">CHAPTER EIGHT an outer wall - one earlier than the other (Pritchard 1961: 1-2, Fig. 2; 1964: 33ff., Figs. 2, 18). The plan of the fortifications in the area of the water system (Area 8/9) is more complex, and differs from the other areas. As noted by the excavator (Pritchard 1964: 33): "Two city walls had encircled the mound ... in Area 8/9 [the earlier] is inside the later line of the defense... the earlier... merges with the later wall just before it reaches the tower... From that point onward around the eastern and southern part of the hill we found no sure trace for the earlier wall". Thus, taking into consideration the relationship between the two walls and between them and the adjacent tower and postern, it may be postulated that all these elements are components of one system, like the gallery wall at Tel Yoqnecam. The gallery wall at Tel Yoqnecam was in use only during the Iron Age IIB (Phases Xlla-XIIb) and was destroyed together with the rest of the city, probably during the Assyr- ian conquest of 732 BCE. This is the last fortification to have been constructed at Tel Yoqnecam during the Iron Age. Later, in the Iron Age III (Stratum XI), the settlement was no longer fortified, as suggested by the tabuns and the remains of other structures built over the line of the city wall (Plan 1.22 on p. 220). THE DRAINAGE CHANNELS Drainage channels are incorporated in the two Iron Age II fortification systems at Tel Yoqnecam - one in the casemate wall and the other in the gallery wall. The earlier channel is the wider and more impressive of the two ( ca . 1.5 m in width). The channels were built close to the northern edge of the tell, near the water system and close to the lowest point of the tell' s summit. These drains were intended to channel the runoff water flowing down the steep surface to beyond the city's boundaries, in order to prevent a build-up of pressure that might endanger the city wall and/or the retaining walls of the water system (see Chapters 4 and 6). Kempinski (1989: 117) notes that: "In the ancient Near East... streets were built not only for transportation and movement of peoples and animals of burden. They were also important arteries of drainage during the rainy season, as well as serving as local channels for disposal of sewage throughout the year. In a country where in winter 50-70 mm. of water may pour down within a few hours it is important that such amounts of water can flow off, in order not to flood the houses." The incorporation of drainage channels in the city wall is known from other Iron Age II sites as well, where runoff water streams down from wide open spaces and gathers in the lower areas, threatening to damage or destroy the walls by flooding. Examples of such drainage channels were ex- posed, for example, at: Hazor VIII-VA, Area G, Channel 10507 (Hazor III-IV: 179, Plans XXXI-XXXIII); Megiddo IVA, Channel 2093 (Megiddo II: Fig. 105); Lachish IV-III, the drainage channel north of the city gate (Ussishkin 1982: 42); and Tell en-Nasbeh 3, where a number of drainage channels were uncovered in the city wall (Zorn 1993: 262ff.). THE WATER SYSTEM A water system was constructed in the northern part of the tell, at the point where both the earlier and later city walls (Strata XIV and XII respectively) make a sharp bend beyond the natural contour of the slope (Squares I-M/22-25; see Plans 1.16, 1.21). The bend in the direction of the walls was intended to encompass the water system within the fortified area (for its description and stratigraphie attribution, see Chapters 2, 4 and 6). A stairway, built adjacent to the north-eastern side of the shaft, led down into the shaft. This stairway, attributed to Stratum XIV, was cancelled during the establishment of the Stratum XII fortifications. Presumably, another stairway, not yet uncovered, was constructed elsewhere. Despite the fact that only the upper part of the shaft was uncovered, it is clear that this system was intended to supply water to the city residents. The nature of this system has not yet been completely clarified. The location of the drainage channels south of the water system in both fortification systems suggests that this system did not serve as a reservoir: these channels led the run-off water to beyond the city boundaries and not to the nearby water system. It is likely that the shaft at Tel Yoqnecam was connected to a tunnel which led to a natural water source: to the spring located north of the tell or to ground water (like the water systems at Megiddo, Hazor and Giveon, see Lamon 1935; Garfinkel 1997: 239-246; Pritchard 1961; for a general discussion of water systems, see Shiloh 1992). The dating of the water system The earliest evidence for the existence of a water system is the casemate wall, which was built during Stratum XIV and which took into consideration the shaft's location. The system was still functioning at the time of construction of the later city wall (attributed to Stratum XII), as attested by the latter' s outline, which similarly took the shaft into consideration. The tower built into the shaft - dated to the Hellenistic period (Yoqnecam I: 11-13, Plan IV. 1 and Photo IV.2 there), though possibly built as early as the Persian period - is a clear indication of its termination of use. The construction of the water system should therefore be attrib- uted to Stratum XIV, during the later half of the tenth century BCE. The system was in use until the destruction of Stratum XII, attributed to the 732 BCE conquest by Tiglath-pileser III (see Chapter 6). It is possible, though not very likely, that the water system continued in use throughout the Persian period (Strata X-VIII) as well. It was customary to date most of the water systems leading from the city to natural water sources to the ninth century BCE onwards, although this dating was not always unequiv- 226</page><page sequence="248">ARCHITECTURAL AND URBAN ANALYSIS ocal (see Cole 1980; Yadin 1972: 164; and others). A number of suggestions have been made to date the construction of some of these water system to the tenth century BCE, but these proposals are based on ambiguous claims (see Shiloh 1992: 291-292). It has recently been proposed to date several water systems to the Middle and/or Late Bronze Age, with Warren's Shaft in Jerusalem serving as the clearest case (Reich and Shukron 2001; Franklin 2000: 521). As for the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (the tenth century BCE), only the water system functioning as a reservoir is known with certainty from this period, particularly from the southern Land of Israel (see Tel Shevac, Herzog 2000; for a later example, see Tel Arad X, Amiran et al. 1985: 16-17; Herzog 2002: 72-76; for a general discussion of reservoirs, see Tsuk 2001-2002). The water system at Tel Yoqnecam constitutes clear-cut evidence for the existence of water systems leading to natural water sources in the Iron Age, as early as the Iron Age IIA (the tenth century BCE). THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SETTLEMENT The complex picture of the settlement at Tel Yoqnecam in the Iron Age reflects the economic, political and social vascillations that took place during that period. In the Iron Age I, Tel Yoqnecam exhibits features reminiscent of the Late Bronze Age settlement. In the Iron Age II, towards the end of the united monarchy, and later, with the strengthening of the Kingdom of Israel, a transformation takes place in the concept of urban settlement at Tel Yoqnecam, generating far-reaching changes in urban planning, reflected in many other contemporaneous sites (for a general analysis of the city plans of different models of Iron Age cities, see Herzog 1992; 1997: 190ff.; Faust 2002, and bibliography therein). The Iron Age settlement at Tel Yoqnecam is characterized by three distinct phases: the first attributed to Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII), the second to Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV), and the third to Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII and perhaps the beginning of Stratum XIII, in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period). The first phase comes to an end in a conflagration and general destruction in the late Iron Age I. The second and third phases, on the other hand, come to a less drastic end, with various elements reintroduced in the subsequent phase. These include the water system, which was built in the second phase and reincorporated in the third, and a dwelling, which was built in the course of the third phase, and reused, after the Stratum XII destruction (apparently during the Assyrian conquest), in Stratum XI. Despite a certain degree of similarity, however, each phase has its own unique char- acteristics. The first phase: the Iron Age I (Plan 1.23) The settlement at Tel Yoqnecam was renewed in Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII) after a gap in the settlement following the general destruction at the end of the Late Bronze Age (Stratum XIX). This gap is evident from the complete dis- continuity between the two settlements, and particularly from the fill between the two strata found in many of the exca- vation areas ( ca . 50-100 cm in thickness). The settlement developed gradually. Two main strata - XVIII and XVII - were identified in most of the excavation areas. The transition between these strata is not uniform: in some places there is continuity in the architec- tural remains, with no clear distinction between the strata, while in other places there is great disparity between the architectural remains of each stratum (see Chapter 3). The relatively long life-span of the first phase is reflected in its large number of sub-phases (most prominent in Area A4 west, where three construction phases and several occupa- tional surfaces were identified). The excavation in Areas A and B2 demonstrates that this part of the site was densely populated. The settlement ex- tended to the very edges of the tell: its boundaries were broader than those of the late, fortified Iron II settlement, and it extended beyond the line of the fortifications. Al- though the periphery of the settlement did not survive, it is evident that the Iron Age I settlement was not fortified. The northern area of the tell was primarily residential. Relatively late in the first phase, there is a growth in industrial and craft activity. Various small industries, such as oil production and metal processing, are evident alongside the residential structures (the finding of these two industries in close proximity is a well-known phenomenon in this period, see Chapter 25). The heterogeneous ceramic assem- blages and the small finds from the end of this period point to the relative prosperity of the residents and to the close economic relations maintained primarily with the northern coastal area - Phoenicia. It should be borne in mind that the excavated area con- stitutes only a relatively small portion of the entire settlement and that it is distant from the areas with special functions, such as the city gate and its environs (structure/s related to the local administration) or the sacred precinct (temple?), like the one at nearby Megiddo. These "special function" areas, essential in such a comparison, have not been uncov- ered at Tel Yoqnecam. Nonetheless, the nature of the remains of the first phase and their dating, as well as the evidence of conflagration and destruction, testifying to the nature of the end of the phase, support a correlation between the first settlement phase at Tel Yoqnecam (Strata XVIII-XVII) and Megiddo (Strata VIB-VIA). In both cases there is a renewal of Canaanite urban culture in the Iron Age I, and they apparently both come to an end under the same circum- stances. Several settlements contemporary with the first phase at Tel Yoqnecam may be associated with this phenomenon, among them Tell Qiri IX- VIII, Beth Shean S-2/Upper VI, Taanach IA-IB and Tell Keisan 12b-9a-b.

However, Stratum IV at Tel Qashish was poorly preserved and is merely a transitional phase between the Late Bronze and the Iron Age settlement at the site ( Qashish : 331-344). The second phase: the Iron Age IIA (Plan 1.24) The remains exposed in the northern part of the tell suggest that the settlement at Tel Yoqnecam was renewed after a gap in occupation following the Stratum XVII destruction. This is notable in the analysis of the pottery (see Part II). The changes that take place during the second phase of settlement (Strata XVI-XIV) exemplify the fluctuations that the site underwent, gradually developing, over a long period of time, from a temporary settlement into a well-developed fortified city. Stratum XVI constitutes an initial, independent transient settlement, preceding the permanent one of Stratum XV. This type of settlement is not commonly identified; thus, Stratum XVI at Tel Yoqnecam is of great importance for an under- standing of the early stages of settlement both at Tel Yoqnecam and at other sites. The renewed excavations at Megiddo, for example, revealed a stage preceding Stratum VB (Phase K3b, see Megiddo III: 126-128, 596-597, which I propose terming "Stratum VC"); this stage resembles Stra- tum XVI at Tel Yoqnecam in character and time framework (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming). The first permanent settlement of this phase is Stratum XV. Its remains were found in several areas. The settlement was not yet fortified during this period, and the peripheral structures presumably served as a defensive belt for the residents. The fortified city established in Stratum XIV constitutes yet another stage in the process. There is hardly any resem- blance between the urban plan of this city and that of the Stratum XV settlement. This dramatic change faithfully portrays the geo-political and socio-economic upheavals of the Iron Age IIA, and points to the existence of a well-established system of government, based upon eco- nomic power, and permitting the planning and execution of extensive building projects, such as the foundation of a massive city wall and the digging of a water system. The innovations in Stratum XIV generated additional changes in the city planning, such as the orientation of the residential buildings, taking into consideration the fortification line (whereas until then residential structures were built as a peripheral belt along the line of the slope, more or less maintaining the traditional layout of the Late Bronze Age). In Stratum XIV the structures stand flush against the city wall (with no open space or perimeter street separating them). The pottery from the second phase suggests that there was a decline in the economic ties between Tel Yoqnecam and the northern coastal area of Phoenicia, compared to the situation at the end of the preceding phase. These ties remained minimal until the end of the period (Stratum XIV), when there was a strengthening of relations, especially evident in the Black-on-Red ware which occurs in small quantities as early as Stratum XV, and becomes frequent in Stratum XIV (see Graph II.5 for bowls and Graph 11.30 for juglets). The second phase at Tel Yoqnecam is similar to the contemporaneous period at neighboring Megiddo, Strata (VC) VB and VA-IVB. The intensification of the settlement during Strata VA-IVB compared to the settlement at Me- giddo Stratum VB is reflected there primarily in representa- tional structures - "palaces" (Structure 6000 and 1723) - and not in fortifications, as at Tel Yoqnecam. Among other settlements either completely or partially contemporary with the second phase at Tel Yoqnecam, the following should be noted: Tel Qashish IIIC-A, Tell Qiri VIIC-A, Taanach IIA-IIB, Beth Shean S-l/Lower V, Tel cAmal IV, Tell el-Faťah (N) Vllb, Tell Keisan 8-7 and Rosh Zayit III- IIa. The second phase came to a sudden end at the end of Stratum XIV, although no clear-cut evidence was found of a conflagration or other violent destruction. Other settle- ments in the region (Megiddo VA-IVB, Taanach lib, Tell Abu Hawam III, etc.) also came to an end in the late Iron Age IIA, although these sites exhibit clearer signs of destruc- tion. The absolute dating of the destruction of these sites and the circumstances leading to it are still controversial: the traditional conventional chronology, the one accepted in this research, dates the late Iron Age IIA to the end of the tenth century (beginning at the latest in the early ninth century BCE, see Mazar 1957; Dever 1997; Mazar 1997; Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a; Ben-Tor 2000; 2001, and references therein); while the low chronology dates these events to the mid-ninth century BCE (see Na'aman 1997; Zimhoni 1997; Gilboa and Sharon 2001; Finkelstein 2002; and references therein). The third phase: the Iron Age IIB (Plan 1.25) The city fortified by the gallery wall (the two phases of Stratum XII) constitutes the third and main phase of Iron Age settlement at Tel Yoqnecam. The preceding Stratum XIII intervenes between the two fortified cities (Strata XIV and XII). Its meager remains are suggestive of a gap in the permanent settlement, at the very least in the northern part of the tell. It may perhaps be construed as the first, temporary, stage in the development of the permanent settlement (Stratum XII), along the lines of the process identified in the second phase, between Strata XVI-XIV. The analysis of the ceramic assemblages of Strata XIII-XII points to substantial differences: Stratum XIII con- tains pottery typical of the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period, while the Stratum Xllb pottery is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB (see Part II). However, these differences are not relevant in the ninth century BCE, in which signifi- cant changes take place in the ceramic typology, evident also in places which exhibit clear stratigraphie and architectural 229</page><page sequence="251">CHAPTER EIGHT Plan 1.24.

Among the settlements contemporary with Stratum XIII at Tel Yoqnecam, the following are noteworthy: Taanach III-IV, Tell el-Faťah (N) Vile, Dan Hussot B, Rosh Zayit I, Tel Jezreel (the enclosure wall complex), Tel cAmal III, Tel Rehov Cl/El and Hazor VIII (some may be somewhat earlier than Tel Yoqnecam Stratum XIII). The new city established in Stratum XII (dated to the Iron Age IIB) is a well-developed settlement, which exhibits evidence of urban planning familiar from many other sites of the time of the divided monarchy. This phase includes: a city wall and towers, a perimeter street adjacent to the city wall, structures arranged along the perimeter street, open spaces, a water system and a drainage system (see discus- sion). The third phase is contemporary with Tel Qashish IIB, Tell Qiri VI-V/VI, Megiddo IVA, Tell el-Faťah (N) Vild, Hazor VI-V and others, either completely or partially, and came to an end in the Assyrian conquest of 732 BCE, like other northern cities such as Megiddo IVA, Beth Shean P-7 and Hazor V, and, slightly later, the capital of the kingdom - Samaria VI. The later settlement The settlement of Stratum XI is attributed to the period following the Assyrian conquest. The isolated, meager re- mains exposed are insufficient to determine whether Stratum XI should be viewed as the beginning of another sub-phase of settlement in the Iron Age - and perhaps continuing into the Persian period - or whether it is a short-lived sub-phase of the third phase. The latter possibility seems more likely, since the finds suggest a certain degree of continuity in the use of private structures from the third phase, while the public structures of representational or military character, such as the city fortifications, ceased to exist (a phenomenon similar to that evident at Tel Qashish Ha and Hazor IV). 232</page><page sequence="254">PART II POTTERY ANALYSIS</page><page sequence="255">CHAPTER NINE INTRODUCTION TO TYPOLOGY This section presents the typology of the Iron Age ceramic ware uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. A total of 4,238 vessels or rims were found in undisturbed contexts dating from the period between the Iron Age I and the end of the Iron Age (Strata XVIII-XI). Their distribution among the Iron Age strata is presented in Table II.l. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS The quantitative analysis of the ceramics at Tel Yoqnecam makes it possible to draw conclusions regarding the appear- ance of families/types in relation to other vessel types and in relation to other sites. Moreover, it enables us to trace the Table ILL Distribution of vessels in Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam Stratum Bowls Chalices Lamps Kraters Cooking Storage Pithoi Amphorae Jugs Juglets Pilgrim Miscellaneous Total vessels jars flasks XII/XI 70 0 6 12 19 39 19 2 166 and XI XII 625 6 22 174 183 152 3 1 176 7 - - 1349 XIII 87 3 22 35 40 2 42 4 1 236 XIV 255 9 27 136 267 134 5 1 223 16 4 - 1077 XV 85 5 21 70 68 39 3 1 111 8 - 1 412 XVI 25 5 6 27 23 13 4 - 52 - 1 156 XVII 156 22 22 77 68 131 5 3 147 7 9 6 653 XVIII 64 4 3 30 13 16 8 47 1 2 J 189 The typological classification is based upon the vessel type, ranging from the open to the closed, following Amiran's 1969 classification (with minor modifications). Each of these vessel groups (e.g. "Bowls") is further divided into families (e.g., "B III: Carinated Bowls") on the basis of its body profiles. In a few cases the family is defined on the basis of other traits, such as a particular rim shape (e.g., B II: Ledged-Rim Bowls) or a specific form of decoration (e.g., the B VII-B IX bowls). The families are further divided into types on the basis of rim shape and additional factors, such as the material or the finish. A few isolated cases could not be attributed to any of the types within the families; these are presented as "Varia" (e.g., B Varia 1-6). Vessels differing slightly from the main type are not included in the general typology or in the statistics, and are presented only in the assemblages arranged by loci in Part I, where they are marked as variants by an asterisk. Finally, a number of vessel types were not included in the general typology, since only one or two examples occur at Tel Yoqnecam. These are: cup and saucer, Assyrian flask, Philistine bottle, stirrup jar, "flower pot", wall bracket, vat, fenestrated stand, strainer, and a clay-made "leaf'. All these are presented separately (Fig. 11.48 on p. 342) under the category of "Miscellaneous Vessels". chronological development of each family/type throughout the Iron Age strata and to determine the repertoire of vessels characteristic of each period, at times narrowing down the time framework even further. The quantitative analysis takes into account all the com- plete (or almost complete) vessels and all the rims (which constitute the majority of the examples).1 These vessels are from undisturbed contexts: floors and their makeup, instal- lations, pits, etc. Finds in baskets from stratified loci higher than the floor level (fills) were not taken into account in the quantitative analysis. In some cases it was difficult to ascer- tain the type of vessel (storage jar or jug, bowl or chalice, etc.). These cases have been excluded from the quantitative analysis. In the case of some rims of closed vessels (particularly storage jars and jugs), the type to which they belong - which is defined primarily on the basis of the shape of the body - could not be determined with certainty. In these cases, the rims were included in a separate typology - based 1 This method is problematic in that it gives the same value to a complete vessel and to a rim. However, this type of analysis does indicate general tendencies of typological development, which are not easy to follow in an analysis based solely on the relatively restricted number of complete vessels. 235</page><page sequence="256">CHAPTER NINE only on the shape of the rim - and not in the main typology. The rims in this secondary typology were marked R (thus, SJR = storage jar rim; JR = jug rim). This is particularly relevant in the case of the jugs, in which the rims included in the rim typology constitute ca. 80% of the jug sherds uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. A JR I rim in the rim typology, for example, could belong to a number of possible jugs, such as J IA, J IV, or J V. The most common vessel groups are: bowls, kraters, cooking pots, storage jars and jugs. Their frequency (e.g., the number of bowls in relation to all other vessel shapes) changes from stratum to stratum, or from one period to another. This can be seen, for example, in the case of bowls vis-à-vis kraters. In the Iron Age IIA, the frequency of bowls (20% of all vessels) is lower than in all other periods. In the Iron Age I they constitute ca. 30%, while in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period, the Iron Age IIB and the Iron Age III they constitute approximately 40%. This tendency seems to correlate with the increase in the number of kraters, which are more common in the Iron Age IIA (when bowls are at their lowest frequency). Graph II. 1 presents the distribution of the main vessel groups at Tel Yoqnecam in the various Iron Age strata. Graph II. 1. Distribution of most common vessels at Tel Yoqnecam in the various Iron Age strata The quantitative analysis also compares the frequency of appearance of vessel families/types (e.g., "rounded bowls" versus "carinated bowls") within each stratum, as well as their distribution in the different strata. In the case of particularly small groups of finds (such as juglets, pilgrim flasks, etc.), the data are given in numbers, rather than percentages. In several cases, the quantitative finds are also presented in graph form. These graphs offer, in our opinion, a clear depiction of the fluctuations that take place in the appearance of families/types in the course of the various Iron Age periods. The graphs present the distribution of each type or sub-type by stratum. The data shown for any given stratum reflects the percentage of the type in question from among the total number of vessels of that vessel group (bowls, lamps, etc.) found in that stratum. For example, in Graph II.2 (p. 240), 45% of all the bowls in Stratum XVIII at Tel Yoqne2am belong to the B IA type. Each chapter concludes with a summary of the develop- ment of the family, broken down according to periods, accompanied by graphs presenting the main types character- istic of each period. A number of strata at Tel Yoqnecam - mainly the transi- tional phases - yielded particularly meager ceramic finds. These are: Stratum XVIII (the beginning of the Iron Age I), Stratum XVI (the beginning of the Iron Age IIA), Stratum XIII (the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period) and Stratum XI (the end of the Iron Age [Iron Age III]). Certain distortions probably occurred in the statistical analysis of finds from these strata. In order to overcome these distor- tions, the more general picture was examined, taking into account the stratigraphie sequence preceding and following the stratum in question (for example, the analysis of the data pertaining to Stratum XVI takes into consideration the vessel development from Stratum XVII to Stratum XV). This problem is particularly acute in the case of Stratum XI, which is very scanty in both architectural and ceramic finds. This paucity was exacerbated by our inability, in many cases, to attribute a particular ceramic assemblage with certainty to Stratum XII or XI. In order to overcome this problem and in light of the importance of Stratum XI (the only stratum representing the end of the Iron Age), the sherds originating in the uncertain assemblages were counted and included under the combined heading XII/XI. In the accompanying graphs the data is combined with the Stratum XI data. It should be pointed out that "XII/XI-XI" does not represent an independent settlement layer, but instead is an indication that the data refer to ceramics from both strata, XII and XI. Most of the vessels have been drawn to a scale of 1:5, with the exception of intact jars and pithoi, which have been drawn to a scale of 1:10. Each type is presented with parallels from other sites, including their stratigraphie attribution. The sign ~ next to a parallel indicates that it bears a certain resemblance to the vessel in question, but that it is not an exact parallel. 236 60% ~J U" m i i H mm U" i ■ IH ■ 40% H ■ m H ■ III ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ 20% ■■■■■■■■ 0% XVIII XVII XVI XV XIV XIII XII XII- VI/YI</page><page sequence="257">CHAPTER TEN BOWLS Bowls constitute the most significant component of the ceramic assemblage at Tel Yoqnecam ( ca . 32%). Approxi- mately 1,400 rims were uncovered in undisturbed contexts. For the distribution of the bowls according to strata, see Table ILI on p. 235. There are nine families of bowls (B I-B IX), distinguished on the basis of body shape, and in a few cases on the basis of other characteristics, such as rim shape (e.g., B II) or decoration (e.g., the Bichrome B VII bowls). Further classi- fication into types and sub-types is based upon rim shape and other secondary distinctions. B I. ROUNDED BOWLS (Fig. II.l) This bowl has rounded walls; its base is generally flat, although a disc base occurs in a few cases. The vessels are generally not decorated. This is the most dominant of the families, representing 34% of all the bowls throughout the Iron Age strata. It can be further broken down into five types, the first three (B IA-B IC) occurring with great frequency (30%, 24% and 33.4% respectively) and the other two (B ID-B IE) occurring less frequently (6% and 7% respec- tively). B IA. Simple bowls (Fig. 11.1:1) This type of bowl is small to medium in size, at times with a slight internal depression beneath the rim. Most of these bowls (75.3%) are not decorated, although a few ( ca . 8%) have a thin red band on or near the rim and some isolated cases are red-slipped. A number of the bowls (ca. 8%) have a deep broad groove beneath the rim (e.g., Fig. 1.25:2). PARALLELS.

XXVI: 1^); Samaria III (55 III: Fig. 4:1); and Beth Shean P7 (Mazar 1999b: Fig. 5, first on right). CHRONOLOGY. This type is prevalent during the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII), reaching its greatest distribution in the early Iron Age (Stratum XVIII, in which it constitutes 45.31% of all the bowls). It gradually declines in frequency during the Iron Age IIA and B.1 The rim broadens in the course of the Iron Age II. As for the decorated bowls, the red-band rim decoration appears in the Iron Age I (especially in Stratum XVIII) and less frequently in the Iron Age IIA. Red-slipped bowls are very infrequent in the Iron Age I, appearing in the Iron Age II. In addition, some bowls have a groove on their rim; these are characteristic of the time-span from the Iron Age I until the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI). B IB. Bowls with bent walls (Fig. 11.1:2) This bowl has a bend in the upper part of its wall, close to the rim, most prominent on the internal side of the vessel. The rim is rounded (albeit at times slightly straightened), upright or slightly inverted. The bowl generally has a flat or ring base. The vessels are made of well-levigated clay. Some specimens are particularly shallow (e.g., Fig. 1.55:5). They are generally not decorated (ca. 80%); a few are burnished and/or slipped. Close to 10% of these bowls have bar handles with two protrusions at the ends (e.g., Figs. 1.6:5, 1.9:4). PARALLELS. Bowls of this type are common in the north- ern coastal area and Phoenicia,2 where they first appear in the early Iron Age I and perhaps even earlier. In the twelfth century there are very few in the Land of Israel, at least in the north, in the valley region (Taanach IA); they continue in the Iron Age II, tenth-ninth centuries BCE (Taanach IIB, Tell Keisan 7, PI. 57:7). 3 It seems that bowls with bar handles first appear in the eleventh century BCE (Beer Sheba VIII, 1 For example, see discussion of these bowls at cIzbet Sartah, Finkelstein 1986: 54-55. 2 Tyre, Bikai 1978: 24-25 and Table 3A-3B, Types 11, 12 and 13; and Sarepta, Sarepta I: 160-161, Types X-28, X-29. 3 See discussion in Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a: 271, Fig. 8:2. 237</page><page sequence="258">CHAPTER TEN Fig. II.l.

This is the most common of all the B IC bowls, constituting 47% of these bowls. In a number of examples, the rim is obliquely cut inwards (ca. 16% of the B IC2 vessels; see Fig. 1.49:6). This sub-type resembles the B II vessels, but with a more delicate rim which barely protrudes beyond the vessel's walls. PARALLELS.

This type is typical of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). B I, Summary (Graph II.2) There is a clear-cut chronological distinction between the various types of rounded bowls: • Type B IA, a continuation of the Late Bronze tradition, is common primarily in the Iron Age I (particularly Stratum XVIII). Graph II. 2. Distribution of B I bowls in the Iron Age • Type B IB begins in the Iron Age I and is most common during the Iron Age IIA (Statum XV). At the end of that period (Stratum XIV) there is a decline in frequency. • Type B IC: Sub-type B ICI a is infrequent, beginning in the late Iron Age I and continuing to the end of this period. Sub-type B IClb is infrequent during the Iron Age II, although it is more common in the Iron Age IIA. Sub-type B IC2 appears during the Iron Age IIA, generally with red slip, and continues into the Iron Age IIB and III, with slip or a red band on the rim. • Type B ID is characteristic of the Iron Age IIA-B transi- tional period and the Iron Age IIB. • Type B IE is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB. B II. LEDGED-RIM BOWLS (Fig. II.2) The rim of this family of bowls is the most characteristic component in the vessel's design, protruding beyond the vessel's walls. A depression often occurs beneath the rim in the outer wall, giving the bowl a slightly carinated to round shape, although the distinction between these shapes is not always obvious. The base may be flat, ring- or disc-shaped. Some bowls have bar handles, and one has an ear handle. The bowls are generally large, although some smaller, more delicate examples occur (marked * in the locus assemblages in Part I, e.g. Fig. 1.44:1). The bowls bear a variety of decorations: some have horizontal or irregular burnish and/or red slip; others bear a red band on the rim. This family represents 26.3% of the Iron Age bowls at Tel Yoqnecam. It is divided into two main types on the basis of the rim shape: B IIA (ca. 63%), with a double ledge rim, and B IIB (ca. 37%), with a single ledge rim. B IIA. Bowls with double ledge rim (Fig. 11.2:1-3) The two edges of this rim protrude outwards. There is a sharp transition between the rim and the inner side of the vessel's wall.

Its distribution grows in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period, and it becomes wide- spread in the Iron Age IIB and III (Strata XII and XII/XI-XI). It is noteworthy that in the Iron Age IIA the number of 241</page><page sequence="262">CHAPTER TEN undecorated and slipped bowls is similar, while there are very few bowls with red band decoration. During the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period, the slipped bowls become the most dominant type. During the Iron Age IIB, there is a growing number of bowls with a red band decoration on their rims, almost matching the number of slipped bowls. This trend continues at the end of this period (Stratum XI). During the Iron Age III (Strata XII/XI-XI), the distribution of the decoration upon the bowls resembles that of the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period, with slipped bowls being the most common (although this change may stem from the small number of the sample). B I1A2. Massive bowls (Fig. 11.2:2) This is a particularly large sub-type (diameter: 40-45 cm). The upper part of its rim is convex (with the exception of one example which has a carinated wall, the upper part of which is flat). This uncommon sub-type is generally slipped. PARALLELS.

This sub-type is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). BIIA3. Deep bowls (Fig. 11.2:3) This bowl - an uncommon sub-type - has a convex rim with an inner groove and a slight carination. It is generally burnished and sometimes slipped. PARALLELS.

This sub-type occurs from the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV) until the Iron Age IIB (Strata XIII-XII). B IIB. Bowls with single ledge rim (Fig. 11.2:4-6) The outer edge of this type of rim is pointed, while the inner edge continues the line of the vessel's walls. This type is further classified into sub-types on the basis of the shape of the rim's upper part. B UBI. Horizontal rim (Fig. 11.2:4) This is the most common among the B IIB bowls.

Since then, they cease to appear until the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). Their distribution increases during the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), and after that gradually declines. The decoration of the bowls changes over time: during the Iron Age IIA and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XIV and XIII) the number of slipped bowls approx- imates that of non-slipped bowls, while the red band deco- ration is extremely rare. During the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), the proportion of slipped bowls rises ( ca . 66%) in relation to the non-slipped vessels, while a growing number of bowls bear a red band decoration on the rim (ca. 12%).

CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type first appears in the late Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), and becomes more common during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV) and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII). It becomes increasingly rare during the Iron Age IIB and III (Stratum XE and XI). The bowls' decoration is chronologically significant: the early bowls (Strata XVII and XV) are not slipped; in Stratum XIV the number of slipped bowls approximates that of non-slipped bowls, while towards the Iron Age IIB there is a slight increase in the occurrence of slipped bowls. B IĪB3. Diagonally everted rim (Fig. 11.2:6) The rim of this sub-type is convex, extending obliquely outwards, often with a depression in the outer side of the rim, a remnant of the carination. This sub-type differs from the others in decoration: approximately half the vessels bear a red band decoration on their rim, in contrast to the less common red slip (ca. 20%).

Summary This bowl family is typical of the Iron Age IIA and B. Some types are characteristic of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV and XIV), while others are more common in the Iron Age IIB and III (Strata XII and XI). • Sub-type B IIA1 appears during the Iron Age IIA, reach- ing its greatest distribution at the end of the Iron Age (Strata XII and XI). • Sub-type B IIA2 is typical of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). • Sub-type B IIA3 is characteristic of the Iron Age IIA and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XIV and XIII). • Sub-type B IIB1: A few bowls were found belonging to the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). Following a gap in distri- bution until the late Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), its appearance becomes frequent in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), declining thereafter. • Sub-type B IIB2 is common during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV) and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), its appearance declines in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). • Sub-type B IIB 3 is typical of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII).

Bowls with slight carination (Fig. 11.3:1-2) This type is not decorated (with a few exceptions), and constitutes 22% of the B III bowls. BUI Al. Gentle carination (Fig. 11.3:1) The distance between the point of carination and the rim is ca. 2 cm or more. The bowl has an "S" profile. The rim is generally simple, elongated and everted.

A. Mazar has carried out a comprehensive study of this type of bowl,5 which is a development of the Late Bronze II carinated bowls. These vessels appear frequently through- out the Land of Israel in the Iron Age I, gradually disappear- ing during the tenth century BCE. CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type is common during the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII), reaching its greatest distri- bution at the end of the period (Stratum XVII) and declining thereafter throughout the Iron Age II. B IIIA2. Degenerated carination (Fig. 11.3:2) The degenerated carination is very close to the rim (up to 1.5 cm). The rim is simple and slightly everted, at times with a straightened upper part.

Bowls of this type appear in the northern region, particu- larly in the valleys, throughout the Iron Age I and in the first half of the tenth century BCE (Hazor XB).6 CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type reaches its greatest distri- bution at the beginning of the Iron Age (Iron Age I, Stratum XVIII), and gradually declines in frequency, although it is still common during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV). It reappears at the end of the Iron Age (Stratum XI), although the ceramic quantities in this stratum are too small to permit any generalization. B IIIB. Bowls with sharp carination (Fig. 11.3:3-4) This is a small, thin- walled bowl with a simple rim, obliquely everted. The walls are uniform or thickened at the point of carination. Some of these bowls are slipped. This type is rare at Tel Yoqnecam. One example has holes at the thickened point of carination. 5 For his Type 8, see Qasile II: 39-42. 6 They occur at Megiddo as early as the Late Bronze Age (VIIB). 243</page><page sequence="264">CHAPTER TEN Fig. II.3.

Thick-walled bowls with low carination (Fig. 11.3:5-6) The wall above the point of carination in this type of vessel is relatively high ( ca . 2.5-3.5 cm), and the rim is generally everted. The bowl's base is usually flat. This is the most common of the B III bowls (70.3%). B IIIC1. Slight thickening of internal wall (Fig. 11.3:5) This sub-type has a pointed, slightly everted rim. It is slightly carinated, especially on the internal wall. The bowl is gen- erally burnished and slipped (over 70%).

CHRONOLOGY. A few bowls of this sub-type appear in the late Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), growing in frequency during the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII) and becoming common in the Iron Age IIB and III (Strata XII and XII/XI). The decoration of these bowls is chrono- logically significant: at first the more dominant form of decoration is red slip, the red band decoration is less common and undecorated bowls occur infrequently. During the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), the ratio between the different types of decoration (slip and red band on the rim) becomes almost equal, whereas undecorated bowls are rarely found. During the Iron Age III (Stratum XI), the actual number of bowls (two to four) is too small to permit any conclusion. B HID. Bowls/kraters (Fig. 11.3:7) These are deep bowls with a prominent carination, a short upright neck and a ledge rim. They are reminiscent of K IIA kraters; their smaller size, however, warrants their inclusion in the bowl category. The vessels are generally neither slipped nor burnished. This vessel is infrequent, constituting 6% of all the bowls in the Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam. PARALLELS. Tell Keisan 11-10 ( Keisan : Pl. 81:9); and Tel Masos (Masos: Pl. 140:6). CHRONOLOGY. These bowls are common during the Iron Age I and the early Iron Age IIA (Strata XVIII, XVII and XVI), and decline in frequency throughout the Iron Age IIA until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XV-XIII), later becoming rare. B III. Summary (Graph II.3) There is a clear chronological division between the various types of carinated bowls (Type B HIB does not appear in the graph due to the small size of its sample). Graph II. 3. Distribution of B III bowls in the Iron Age • Type B IIIA is a common type, characteristic of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII) and declining in frequency during the Iron Age IIA until the Iron Age IIA-B transi- tional period (Stratum XIII). There are two sub-types: B IIIA1, the most common of the two, reaches its greatest distribution in Stratum XVII, while B IIIA2 is more com- mon at the beginning of the period (Stratum XVIII), declining in frequency throughout the Iron Age. • Type B HIB, rare at Tel Yoqnecam, is found during the Iron Age II. • Type B UIC appears frequently during the Iron Age II. There is a clear chronological distinction between its sub-types. B IIIC1 is characteristic of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV), declining in frequency during the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII) and hardly appearing at all during the Iron Age IIB. The later sub-type, B IIIC2, is characteristic of the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII) and is prevalent in the Iron Age IIB and III (Strata XII and XII/XI). The ratio of the various decorations changes over time: at first the slipped bowls are the most dominant, but in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII) the number of slipped bowls equals the number of those with a red band on their rims. • Type B IIID is typical of the Iron Age I and the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVIII, XVII and XVI). It declines during the Iron Age IIA until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XV-XIII). B IV.

It is characteristic of the early Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII), where it constitutes ca. 12% of all the bowls found in the stratum, and of Stratum XVII, albeit in smaller quantities. It continues to appear, although less frequently, in the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). A few isolated examples were found in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). B IVB. Straightened rim (Fig. 11.4:2-3) These bowls are often decorated with a red band, and sometimes are red-slipped and burnished. A few bowls of this type are undecorated. The rim is reminiscent of that of Sub-type B IIIC2, and at times is particularly sharply cut. This is the most dominant type of B IV bowls, constituting ca. 85%. It is divided into two sub-types: BIVB1 and B IVB2, the former being the most common, accounting for 66.5% of these bowls. B IVB1.

This sub-type is common in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), reaching its greatest distribution during the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII, where it constitutes ca. 12.7% of all bowls). Towards the end of the Iron Age (Stratum XI), it declines in frequency. The decoration of these bowls changes over time: at first most are slipped, while some bear a red band decoration on their rim and a few lack any decoration. In the Iron Age IIB most of the bowls are decorated with a red band on their rim, while the number of slipped bowls gradually declines. In the Iron Age III (Stratum XI), there are only bowls with a red band decoration on their rims. B IVB2.

BELL-SHAPED BOWLS (PHILISTINE CERAMIC WARE) (Fig. II.6) These deep bowls, with two horizontal handles, occur in two sizes: small and medium.

For a general discussion, see Qasile II; Dothan 1982: 98-106. CHRONOLOGY. This family occurs at Tel Yoqnecam in the early Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII). Three examples were found, constituting 4.5% of all the bowls in that stratum. It should be noted that a Philistine bowl sherd was found in the fill under the earliest level, attributed to the Iron Age I (between Strata XIX-XVIII; see Fig. 11.6:1). One example was uncovered in Stratum XVII, and another two in Stratum XIV (Iron Age IIA). B VII-B IX. FAMILIES DEFINED MAINLY ON THE BASIS OF DECORATION (Figs. II.7-9; Graph II.5) The decoration of these bowls is the main indicator of these families, in contrast to the previous families, which were differentiated on the basis of form. The sub-classification is based upon the body shape, and in many cases it correlates with the bowl definitions previously presented. Much of the repertoire presented in Figs. II.7-9 does not occur in an undisturbed stratigraphie context. These families occur with low frequency in the Iron Age assemblages at Tel Yoqnecam. Noteworthy is the Black-on-Red B VIII family - constituting 1.5% of all the Iron Age bowls at Tel Yoqnecam, although its occurrence in the Iron Age IIA strata is notable (see discussion below). Graph II. 5. Distribution of B VII, B VIII and B IX bowls in the Iron Age B VII. BICHROME BOWLS (Fig. II.7) These bowls are characterized by their bichrome decoration of horizontal lines: thin black lines with a broad red band between them. In most cases, the clay is of good quality. Many of the bowls are burnished. The bichrome ceramic group originated in the northern Phoenician coastal area (Gilboa 1999: 1-22; Anderson 1990: 35-54; Birmingham 1963: 15-42; Bikai 1978; 1987). The shape of most of the bowls correlates with the types familiar from the local repertoire (Fig. II.7). Noteworthy is a particularly large bowl/ krater (Fig. 11.7:2), whose form resembles Sub-type B ICla. The inverted rim is slightly thicker than the vessel's walls, and its upper part is flat. There is an external groove under the rim, with a line decoration beneath it, but the rim treatment in the bichrome bowl/krater differs from that of B ICla. PARALLELS.

This family of bowls is rare at Tel Yoqnecam, with only four bowls found in a clear context. Two of these are attributed to the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII) and the two others to the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV). B VIII. CYPRO-PHOENICIAN BOWLS (Fig. II.8; Photo II.2) These bowls are burnished and decorated with a group of black horizontal lines against a red-orange background, which is the natural color of the clay. The decoration is arranged in groups of thin and thick lines, with a thick band always appearing on the rim. The rim of these bowls is generally slightly pointed at its edge. Most of the vessels have rounded walls, two elongated horizontal handles that are extended upwards and decorated with a band (Fig. 11.8:1-2). These have been discussed in Rosh Zayit : 68-79. In a few cases, the shape of the bowl's body is irregular: Photo II.2. Bowl VIII 1. A deep bowl with a degenerate carination (Fig. 11.8:3).

Tell Qiri VI /V ( Qiri : Fig. 8:2). SUMMARY As mentioned above, bowls constitute a major component of the ceramic assemblage at Tel Yoqnecam in the Iron Age (. ca . 32%). The most common family is the rounded bowl (B I), constituting 34% of all the bowls in Iron Age strata. Ledged-rim bowls (B II) and carinated bowls (B III) occur alongside the rounded bowls, constituting 26.3% and 24% of all the bowls in these strata respectively. The plates (B IV) are less common, constituting 11.8% of the Iron Age bowls at Tel Yoqnecam. Decoration (Graph II.6) The bowls exhibit three main types of decoration: there are undecorated vessels, red-slipped ones and bowls with a red band on their rims. Bowls with other decoration types are less prevalent (Families B VI-B IX, discussed above). Some of the red-slipped bowls in particular, as well as various undecorated ones, are burnished. Most of the Iron I and IIA bowls at Tel Yoqnecam are not decorated, especially those of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII). The frequency of decorated bowls increases from the early Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI) until the end of the Iron Age (Strata XII and XI7). During the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), the decorated bowls out- number the undecorated ones, a situation that continues until the end of the Iron Age. Red-slipped bowls first appear at the beginning of the Iron Age II (Stratum XVI), and they become increasingly popular throughout the Iron Age II, reaching their greatest distribu- tion in Strata XIII and XII. 7 For discussion of the problematicity of Stratum XVI and particularly of XII/XI, see Chapter 9. Graph II.6. Distribution of bowl decoration in the Iron Age Bowls with a red band on their rims appear in the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII) and perhaps in the early Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI), and represent a continuation of the Canaanite Late Bronze Age tradition. They then disappear and later re-emerge, albeit with lower frequency, from the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), reaching their greatest distribution in the Iron Age IIB and III (Strata XII and XI). The ratio between the various decorated bowls - the slipped ones and those with a red band on their rims - changes over time. During the late Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV) and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), most of the decorated bowls are red-slipped. In the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), the two types of decoration occur with almost equal frequency, while in the Iron Age III (Stratum XI), bowls with a red band on their rims are more frequent than their slipped counterparts (see Graph II.6). The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII (Graph II.7) The most common type of bowl in this period is B IA, which continues the Late Bronze Age tradition (this type constitutes ca. 45% of all bowls in the earlier Stratum XVIII and 35% of all bowls in the later Stratum XVII). Additional types that are popular in this period, but occur in smaller quantities, are Types B IIIA (especially B IIIA1), B IB and B IVA; Graph II.7.

Some types are considered characteristic of this period despite the fact that they occur in extremely small quantities: these are B VI (mainly at the beginning of the period) and B VII. Type B IIB begins to appear towards the end of the period. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV (Graphs II.8-9) The earliest stratum in this period (XVI) differs from the preceding period in terms of the relative frequencies of the main types. The most common types in this period are B IB and B IC2b (occurring with greater frequency than before). Graph II.8. Distribution of bowls in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XV) Graph II.9. Distribution of bowls in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV) In contrast, Type B IA still occurs, but much less frequently than in the preceding period. Sub-types B ICI, B IC2a and B IIID continue to occur in small quantities, like in the previous period. Sub-type B IIIC1, which is to become characteristic of the Iron Age IIA, makes its first appearance in the period under discussion. The rest of the period (Strata XV-XIV) is characterized by a strengthening of trends already present in Stratum XVI: for example, the B IB bowls reach their greatest distribution in Stratum XV (constituting ca. 35% of all the bowls in the stratum), the popularity of Sub-type B IIIC1 increases and it becomes one of the characteristic bowls of the period, while B IA, which had already begun to decline at the beginning of the Iron Age IIA, decreases even more in frequency. This holds true of the B IIIA bowls as well. B IC bowls are typical of the period under discussion. A new family that first makes its appearance is B II, which occurs mainly from the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), although most of its sub-types are characteristic mainly of subsequent strata, with the exception of B IIB2, which is typical of the Iron Age IIA; a similar process is evident with respect to B IIIC2. The families of bowls defined on the basis of their deco- ration first occur in and are typical of this period: B VIII (Black-on-Red bowls) in particular, and, in lesser quantities, B IX and B VII bichrome bowls (the latter being less com- mon and beginning earlier, in the course of the Iron Age I). The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII (Graph 11.10) The bowl family characteristic of the Iron Age IIA-B tran- sitional period is B II, and particularly Sub-types B IIB1 and B IIA1 (especially the red-slipped variety). Also common is Sub-type B IIIC2. These bowls occurred earlier, but in small quantities, and they become increasingly popular in this period. Most of these types reach their greatest distribution later, in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). Sub-type B IDI occurs somewhat infrequently, but never- theless is characteristic of the period under discussion. Sub-type BIVB1 also makes its first appearance in this period, reaching its greatest popularity in the subsequent period. In addition, a number of previously mentioned types continue into this period, such as B IIIC1, B IC2 (especially B IC2a) and Family B VIII, although in smaller quantities. Graph 11.10.

Type B VA first occurs in this period, but is rare. Among the decorated bowls occurring in this period, B IX is notable, although it does not occur frequently. The Iron Age III: Stratum XI The trends evident in the Iron Age IIB continue in this period, although with slight modifications. For example, B IVB bowls are characteristic of the Iron Age III as well, but in this period Sub-type B IVB2 is the most common. In addi- tion, alongside the B VA bowls, another type - B VB - first occurs, later becoming characteristic of the Persian period. 256</page><page sequence="277">CHAPTER ELEVEN CHALICES A total of 51 chalices and chalice fragments were found at Tel Yoqnecam. For their distribution according to strata, see Table II.l on p. 235. At times it is difficult to distinguish between the rims of chalices, bowls and lamps, and in a few cases the attribution of the rim is not certain. There are two main families of chalices: C I and C II. C I. CHALICES WITH ROUNDED BOWL AND RIM WITH TRIANGULAR SECTION (Fig. 11.11:1-3) The external part of the rim is flat and in infrequent cases convex. The vessel is generally not slipped or burnished. This family, which accounts for 56% of all the chalices at Tel Yoqnecam, is further classified into types on the basis of rim shape: C IA. Short rim (Fig. 11.11:1-2) This is the most common of the C I types, accounting for 82.6% of the C I chalices uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. CI Al. Delicate rim (Fig. 11.11:1; Photo II.4) The transition between the rim and the body is smooth, with the inner wall of the chalice rising gradually towards the pointed edge of the rim. This is the most common of the C IA sub-types (63%). 15:3,5); Megiddo VII and Tomb 39 (Megiddo II: PI. 67:5; PARALLELS. Tell Qiri VIII-VII (Qiri: Figs. 10:9-10, Photo II.4.

CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type is characteristic of the Iron Age I and the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVIII-XV). Three examples were found in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), although they may perhaps be attributed to a B IE bowl characteristic of that period (see Chapter 10, p. 240). CIA2. Pronounced rim (Fig. 11.11:2) The rim is inturned and there is a sharp transition between rim and body. The chalice is shallower than C IA1. PARALLELS.

The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII Only C I chalices (Sub-type C IA1 and Type C IB) occur at the beginning of this period. Towards the end of the period, Sub-type C IA2 appears, in addition to those already present, and C II chalices first occur (Type C IIA). The chalice feet characteristic of this period are B2 and C. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV At the beginning of this period (Strata XVI-XV), Sub-type C IA1 still occurs, although it disappears during this time-span (Stratum XV). Type C IIA continues to occur. At the end of the period (Stratum XIV), the C II chalices are the most common (Types C IIA and C IIB), with the latter first appearing in this period. The chalice foot most typical of the Iron Age IIA is the B1 type. Type A feet are rare, occurring at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). From the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period until the end of the Iron Age: Strata XIII-XI During this period, chalices all but disappear at Tel Yoqne'am. A few rim sherds of the two families, attributed to the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), were uncovered. 260</page><page sequence="281">CHAPTER TWELVE LAMPS A total of 112 lamps and lamp fragments were uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam, constituting 2.5% of all the vessels. For their distribution according to strata, see Table II.l on p. 235. These are classified into three families. L I. SIMPLE, SLIGHTLY EVERTED RIM (Fig. 11.12:1) The rim is a continuation of the vessel's wall. The base is rounded and in rare cases slightly raised. A total of 47 examples of this type were found (constituting ca. 42% of all the Iron Age lamps at Tel Yoqnecam). PARALLELS. Megiddo VIII-VIA (.

This is the most common lamp found at Tel Yoqnecam from the beginning of the Iron Age I until the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVIII-XVI, constitut- ing ca. 66% of all the lamps in each stratum). In the course of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV), it diminishes in frequency, although it is still the most common among the lamp families (representing 52.3% of all the lamps in the stratum), Later, from the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV) until the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), it becomes less common (con- stituting approximately 30% of the lamps in Strata XIV and XII). L II. PROMINENTLY EVERTED RIM (Fig. 11.12:2) The transition between the vessel's wall and rim is slightly emphasized. The base is round to flat. This is the most common of the families of lamps at Tel Yoqnecam, with 60 examples uncovered (constituting ca. 54% of all the lamps found in Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam). PARALLELS.

LXXXVIII:13). CHRONOLOGY. This family occurs infrequently from the beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII) until the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI). In Strata XVIII-XVI it constitutes ca. 33% of all the lamps in each stratum. In the course of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV), it becomes more frequent, a trend which intensifies at the end of the period (Stratum XIV), when L II becomes the most popular lamp (ca. 70% of all the lamps in the stratum). It continues to be widespread until the end of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII); later, in the Iron Age III (Stratum XI), there is a significant decline in its occurrence. This is the only type of lamp to appear during the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), although the sample is too small to permit any conclusions. L III. LEDGED-RIM LAMPS (Fig. 11.12:3) The rim is pointed, often slightly downward. The transition from the rim to the inner wall is carinated and highly emphasized. The base is flat and at times slightly concave; the transition from the lamp's base to its wall is sharp. The lamp is made of light clay, is generally burnished and only rarely slipped. Only five L III lamps were uncovered. PARALLELS.

This family makes its appearance at the end of the Iron Age (Strata XII/XI-XI). SUMMARY (Graph 11.11) The lamps at Tel Yoqnecam constitute a small group com- pared to other vessels. Their typology is chronologically significant: Graph 11.11. Distribution of lamps in the Iron Age The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII L I is the most common lamp in this period, with L II occurring concurrently, although with lower frequency. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV During this period a change occurs in the trends of these two families, L I and L II. At the beginning, in Stratum XVI, L I continues to be the most common lamp, as in the Iron Age I. The later Stratum XV is a transitional phase, in which the L I and L II families occur with almost the same frequency. At the end of the period, in Stratum XIV, the trend is reversed, with L II becoming more common. The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII The only lamp occurring in this period is L II, although the sample is too small to permit any conclusions. The Iron Age IIB: Stratum XII L II is the most common family of lamp, while L I is more peripheral (as at the end of the Iron Age IIA, Stratum XIV). The Iron Age III: Stratum XI L III is the most characteristic lamp in this period. 262 100-1 DLI ■ L II 80&gt;LIH| ļ 60 - n I I 40 ~ II I 20 " I I I I I I 0 ® 1 ® 1 ™ 1 ® 1 1 1 1 ® r-*1™ 1 XVIII XVII XVI XV XIV XIII XII XII-XI / XI</page><page sequence="283">CHAPTER THIRTEEN KRATERS A total of 548 kraters have been uncovered in undisturbed contexts at Tel Yoqnecam, constituting 13% of all the vessels. For their distribution according to strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. Six families can be distinguished. K I. HANDLELESS KRATERS WITH FOLDED RIM AND SHORT SHOULDER (Fig. 11.13) The kraters belonging to this category - the most dominant family at Tel Yoqnecam - are generally slightly carinated close to the rim and have a ring base. They are smaller than the other kraters. This family commonly occurs from the beginning of the Iron Age until the Iron Age IIA-B transi- tional period (Strata XVIII-XIII), and includes almost 90% of the kraters in all strata during this time period. There is a decline in their distribution in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), although their presence is still significant, constituting ca. 40% of the kraters in this stratum. This family is char- acteristic of the entire northern valley region (see parallels below). It can be divided into two main types, KIA and KIB. Fig. 11.13.

Neckless kraters (Fig. 11.13:1-3) This is a relatively shallow krater, neither slipped nor bur- nished (with a few exceptions). The rim is unevenly shaped along its entire circumference. The rim diameter ranges from 27 to 37 cm. Two particularly small kraters were uncovered (diameter: ca. 20 cm, see Fig. 1.19:29). This is the more dominant type of K I kraters, constituting ca . 60% of all kraters found at Tel Yoqnecam. In the Iron Age I and the early Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVIII-XV), this type - which originated in the Late Bronze Age - constitutes over 80% of the kraters in each stratum. It can be further broken down into three sub-types: K IA1, K IA2 and K IA3. KIA1 . Rim rectangular in section (Fig. 11.13:1; Photo II.5) The outer side of this upright rim is flat.

This is the most common sub-type of K IA kraters, which includes over 50% of the kraters in the strata dating from the beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII) until the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV). It reaches its greatest distribution at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII) and the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI). At the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), it gradually declines, although it is still common in Strata XIV-XIII (ca. 30%).

CHRONOLOGY. This is the earliest of the K IA sub-types. It reaches its greatest distribution at the beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII), gradually declining in the Iron Age I and IIA (Strata XVII-XVI). K IB. Kraters with medium-sized neck (Fig. 11.13:4-6) This type of krater is deeper than the previously discussed types. The rim is elongated and its outer part is thickened. Its diameter is close to the maximum diameter of the vessel. The edge of the rim is generally narrow and pointed. Occa- sionally the krater is burnished and red-slipped; the number of such vessels is significant in comparison with the K IA kraters, in which slip is absent. Ca. 15% of all the kraters at Iron Age Yoqnecam belong to Type K IB. 264</page><page sequence="285">KRATERS The K IB kraters can be classified into two main sub-types (K IBI and K IB2), with a similar distribution, and an addi- tional sub-type (K IB3), which is rare.

CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type first occurs at the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI), and gradually becomes more common during this period (Strata XV and XIV; ca. 15% of all kraters in Stratum XIV). It reaches its greatest distribution in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stra- tum XIII), in which it constitutes over one-quarter of all the kraters. Later, in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), it decreases in frequency. Slipped kraters are rare, and are attributed only to the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV). KIB2. Rim triangular in section (Fig. 11.13:5) The apex of the triangle, close to the lower part of the rim, is emphasized. The apex meets the neck in an oblique line. This sub-type of krater is sometimes red-slipped and bur- nished {ca. 22%), and is the largest category of slipped K I kraters. PARALLELS.

CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type of krater first appears in the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV) and it is common at the end of that period (Stratum XIV, when it constitutes 15.4% of all kraters). It reaches its greatest distribution in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII, when it constitutes 22.7% of all kraters). Later, in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), it declines in distribution. Slipped kraters occur from the earliest stage of this sub-type (Stratum XV), when they are similar to the non-slipped kraters in their distribution. Slip gradually be- comes less frequent during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). It is exceedingly rare in the Iron Age IIA-B transition period (Stratum XIII, in which only one example was found), and disappears completely in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). KIB3.

Taanach IIB ( Taanach . Fig. 44:1-2). K I. Summary This is the most prevalent family of kraters in the Tel Yoqnecam assemblage, occurring from the beginning of the Iron Age I until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period. There is a clear chronological distinction between the two types, K IA and K IB: the latter developed out of the former in the early Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XV). It gradually replaces the earlier type, becoming more dominant in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII). • KIA is the most dominant krater in the Iron Age I and IIA, and among its sub-types, K IA1 is the most common. • K IA1-2 are widespread from the early Iron Age I (Stra- tum XVIII) until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII). At the end of this period (Strata XIV-XIII), they become less common. The two sub-types differ slightly in their distribution: the first, KIA1, reaches its greatest distribution at the end of the Iron Age I and the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVII-XVI), while the second, K IA2, reaches its greatest distribution during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XV). • K IA3 is a continuation of the Late Bronze Age tradition; it reaches its greatest distribution in the early Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII) and declines during the Iron Age I and IIA (Strata XVII-XIV). • K IB is characteristic of the end of the Iron Age IIA and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XIV-XIII). • K IB 1-2 are similar in development and frequency. Both sub-types appear in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XV) and are widespread at the end of that period (Stratum XIV), reaching their greatest distribution in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII) and declining in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). Slip occurring on K IB kraters is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB (Strata XV-XIV). • K IB3 is rare, occurring at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). K II. KRATERS WITH LEDGE RIM, LONG NECK AND HANDLES (Fig. 11.14) This family of kraters has a rounded to carinated body. The rim is generally everted, but in a few cases is somewhat inverted. Sometimes it is slightly convex. The neck merges with the upper wall of the vessel. The krater has two or four handles attached from the rim or just beneath it to the shoulder. It has a ring base. This family is not common at Tel Yoqnecam - accounting for a maximum of ca. 12.6% of the kraters in the strata in which it occurs. It is generally not slipped or burnished. At times it bears a monochrome linear decoration. The family is further classified into three types: K IIA, K IIB and K IIC. 265</page><page sequence="286">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 11.14.

Refined rim (Fig. Ii. 14: 1-2) KIIA1. Short upper wall (Fig. 11.14:1) The walls of this vessel sub-type are short to medium; the neck is upright or slightly inverted. CHRONOLOGY. This is the most common of the KIIA sub-types. It is a continuation of the Late Bronze Age tradition, as reflected in the singular decoration of the krater presented in Fig. 11.14:1. This sub-type appears in the Iron Age I, and is most common at the beginning of that period (Stratum XVIII). KIIA2. Long upper wall (Fig. 11.14:2) The walls of this sub-type of vessel are medium to long. PARALLELS to K IIA. Many variations of this type of krater - in body shape and decoration - appear throughout the Land of Israel in the thirteenth-tenth centuries BCE: at Megiddo VIIB-VIIA and Tombs 39, B 912 and C 1101 ( Megiddo II: PI. 69:14,16; Megiddo Tombs'.

It is noteworthy that slip first occurs during the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), con- tinuing into the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). KIIB2. Ridged neck (Fig. 11.14:4) This sub-type is less common than the former and is not slipped. 1 For a more detailed discussion, see Mazar in Qasile II: 45-47, Type 1. CHRONOLOGY. Sub-type KIIB2 is similar to KIIB1 in distribution. Most of the examples date from the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). K IIC. Cut rim (Fig. 11.14:5-7) The ledge rim of this type of krater is particularly flat, rectangular in section and with its outer part straightened. KIIC1. Tall upright neck ( Coastal Phoenician ware) (Fig. 11.14:5-6; Photo II.6) This sub-type has an outwardly extended rim, its upper part is flat and its external side is cut. The vessel has a rounded shoulder, two handles with an emphasized depression along their lengths, and a high ring base. The clay is unusual: light and sandy. This sub-type of krater is attributed to the Phoe- nician ceramic ware. It is rare in the ceramic assemblage at Tel Yoqnecam, with only two examples: one unslipped whole krater, dating from the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), and one decorated, red-slipped sherd, which was not found in an undisturbed context.

KRATERS WITH THICKENED CONVEX RIM (Fig. 11.16) The rim of this family is oblique, its inner side pointed. Some rims have a depression on their lower side. A ridge, close to the shoulder base, is sometimes degenerate. The vessel's upper walls are medium to long and are inverted. There are two types of this krater: one large and one smaller (although without the body it is difficult to distinguish between them). The krater has two or four handles, extending from the rim to the shoulder. The rim is sometimes decorated in red. A particularly deep variant (Fig. 1.80:35) has a relatively thin profiled rim which protrudes outwards. A depression on its lower part emphasizes the sharp transition to the upper wall of the krater. The junctures at both edges of the upper wall are emphasized by a depression on the inner wall. Fig. 11.16.

The predominant family is K I (71.7% of all the kraters). Families K IV and K II are smaller (17.8% and 9.6% respectively), and the other families are rare (for distribution of the main families and types in each stratum, see Graphs 11.12-13). Decoration Most of the Tel Yoqnecam kraters are not decorated. In the Iron Age II there is a small quantity of red-slipped kraters, with the slip appearing primarily on the rim and the upper part of the vessel. The types that are sometimes slipped include K IB 1-2, KIIB1, KIV and KVI. It should be pointed out that no uniform chronological development could be noted in the appearance of slip on the kraters. For example, slip on the K IB kraters is characteristic of the Iron Age IIA, while slip on the K IIB kraters is typical of the Iron Age IIB, despite the fact that both types appear - albeit in different frequencies - in both periods. The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII (Graph II. 12) The K I A kraters are the most common in this period ( ca . 90% of all kraters in these strata), with K IIA kraters fre- quently occurring as well. Graph 11.12. Distribution of the main families of kraters in the Iron Age The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV (Graph II.12) During this period Type K I A continues to be most dominant krater, although its distribution gradually declines. Type KIB first appears in this period, becoming increasingly popular. K II kraters appear in small quantities, with K IIA decreasing in frequency and K IIB, which first occurs in this period, becoming progressively more common. Although the KV family occurs mainly in this period, it is nonetheless rare. The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII (Graph 11.12) The trends noted for the Iron Age II, regarding the K I and K II kraters, continue and strengthen during this period, with Type K IB becoming the predominant krater in this stratum. The Iron Age IIB: Stratum XII (Graph II. 13) Most of the kraters dated to this period belong to two general families: the K IV krater (43.1%), which first appears in this stratum and is characteristic of it, and the K I krater (40.2%), which, as aforementioned, occurs throughout the Iron Age. Graph 11.13. Distribution of KI and KIV kraters in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period and the Iron Age IIB (Strata XIII-XII) The ratio between the two families changes in the course of this period: at the beginning (Phase Xllb), KI is the pre- dominant krater, although it occurs in small quantities in comparison to the previous period. At the end of the period (Phase Xlla), the K IV family is more common. Other less common families also occur in this period: K II (especially Type K IIB), K III and K VI. The Iron Age III: Stratum XI The trends noted for the Iron Age IIB continue into the Iron Age III as well. 271 100 ļ IHK IA ao- W m raK,B ao- W I 0KIIA 80 - Il SRK,,B I I PK IV 100 -| 90 - mm Ski I ■ mm I I Ski 80- ■ MA XIII Xllb Xlla</page><page sequence="292">CHAPTER FOURTEEN COOKING VESSELS A total of 676 cooking vessels have been found in clear archaeological contexts at Tel Yoqnecam, constituting 16% of the total number of vessels. For their distribution according to Strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. Cooking ware differs in its clay from the other vessels: it has a gray-brown/reddish hue with quartz grits. The cooking vessels at Tel Yoqnecam assume a variety of forms: broad carinated pots (CP I-CP V), globular pots (CP VI-CP VIII), cooking jugs (CP IX-CP X) and baking trays (CP XI). The cooking pots with broad carinated body (CP I-CP V) are open vessels, the diameter of their rim close to the maximum diameter of the vessel. The neck is short to medium in length, and the vessel is generally handleless. Globular cooking pots (CP VI-CP VIII) have a relatively small rim diameter, a small globular body, sometimes slightly carinated, an extremely low neck and two handles attached from the rim to the shoulder. The cooking jugs (CP IX-CP X) include vessels manufac- tured out of the same clay as the cooking pots, but differing from them in shape. The cooking jugs have one or two handles. In many cases it is difficult to determine the number of handles since only a small fragment of the rim survived. There is generally a correlation between the size of the vessel and the number of its handles: the smaller ones usually have one handle, while the larger ones have two. The baking trays (CP XI) are shaped like a simple bowl, placed upside-down, with straight or rounded walls. Cooking pots with broad carinated body constitute 71% of the cooking vessels at Tel Yoqnecam. Globular cooking pots constitute 18.3%, cooking jugs close to 6.2% and baking trays ca. 4.2%. The statistical data presented below does not include the baking trays, the number of which is insignificant in comparison with the other cooking vessels. Noteworthy is a group of broad pots with various markings on their rims, incised before firing. This group is accorded a separate discussion below, due to the great quantity of such pots found at Tel Yoqnecam, the largest group to have been uncovered to date, and due to the implications of such a find. CP I. BROAD COOKING POTS WITH EVERTED RIM (Fig. 11.20:1) This vessel has a short triangular rim, slightly convex and upright, its lower edge extending far from the vessel's body. The neck is relatively tall. The shape of the rim (ca. 32-39 cm in diameter) developed from the Bronze Age everted triangular rim; it is transitional between the Late Bronze and Iron Ages and is rarely found later. PARALLELS. Taanach IA ( Taanach : Fig. 2:2-7). CP II. BROAD COOKING POTS WITH LONG, NARROW TRIANGULAR RIM (Fig. 11.20:2-3) In over one-third of the rims the upper part is straight, generally sharply cut. A few similarly cut rims occur in Type CP IVB (see below). The CP II cooking pots constitute ca. 12.4% of all the cooking pots at Tel Yoqnecam, and are further classified into two main types, CP IIA and CP IIB. CP IIA. Simple upright or slightly inverted rim (Fig. 11.20:2) This is the most common of the CP II cooking pots (consti- tuting ca. 70% of the family). The rim is straight or slightly concave. Approximately two-thirds of these vessels have a rim whose upper edge is rounded or slightly pointed; the other one-third have a sharply cut straight rim. The rim is generally extended downward, and in rare cases is slightly pointed. In some cases there is a slight depression inside the upper part of the rim. PARALLELS.

Summary (Graph 11.14) Cooking pots belonging to the CP II family are typical of the Iron Age I and the early Iron Age II. There is a clear chronological distinction between the two types: • CP IIA is the most common type, frequently appearing at Tel Yoqnecam in the Iron Age I and particularly wide- spread at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). • CP IIB reaches its greatest distribution slightly later than CP IIA, at the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI). Graph 11.14. Distribution of CP II cooking pots in the Iron Age CP III. BROAD COOKING POTS WITH THICK TRIANGULAR RIM (Fig. 11.20:4-8) The rim is upright or slightly everted, its upper edge pointed, its base broad and usually horizontal. At times there is a groove at the juncture between the rim base and the neck. The outer side of the rim is smooth, sometimes with a slight protrusion at the lower tip. In some cases, the folding of the rim left a gap in the center of the triangle. This is the most common family of cooking pots at Tel Yoqnecam, constitut- ing ca. 31% of the total number of cooking pots. CP UIC is the most common of its three types. CP IIIA. Small, delicate cooking pots (Fig. II.20:4) The rim of this type is short and delicate, its diameter ca. 23-25 cm. Only a few examples were uncovered. PARALLELS. Taanach IB ( Taanach : Fig. 14:11). CHRONOLOGY. This type is typical of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII). CP IIIB. Rim of medium thickness (Fig. 11.20:5) This type represents a transition between the narrow trian- gular cooking pot (CP II) and the thick triangular one (par- ticularly CP IIIC1). Type CP IIIB has a relatively delicate rim; its base is narrower than that of CP UIC. This type represents close to 10% of the CP III family. PARALLELS . Megiddo VIA (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Fig. 5:8); and Rosh Zayit III ( Rosh Zayitš. Fig. 111.1:15). CHRONOLOGY. Type CP IIIB begins at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), continuing in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV). CP UIC. Very thick rim (Fig. 11.20:6-8) This type is the most dominant among the CP III vessels. Most specimens can be classified as belonging to the CP IIIC1 sub-type. In rare cases, these cooking pots have handles. CP IIIC1. Rim with horizontal base (Fig. 11.20:6-7) This sub-type constitutes ca . 76% of all the CP III vessels. In a large percentage of these cooking pots, the diameter of the rim is as large as or larger than the diameter of the shoulder. In these cases, the rim is everted and the neck is concave and emphasized. This sub-type occurs in two main sizes: medium (rim diameter: 25-35 cm; rim length: 1.8-2.5 cm) and large (rim diameter: 36-56 cm; rim length: 2.6-3.8 cm). Approximately three-quarters of the vessels belong to the former category.

This sub-type occurs infrequently during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV); it increases significantly in distribution towards the end of the period (Stratum XIV). CP III. Summary (Graph II. 15) The CP III cooking pots can be classified into one main sub-type (CPIIIC1) and two secondary types: • CP IIIA is characteristic of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII). • CP IIIB begins at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), and continues in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV). It appears to be the link - both chronologi- cally and in terms of form - between the earlier types, typical of the Iron Age I, and Type CP UIC, which is typical of the Iron Age IIA. • CP UIC is the dominant type in Tel Yoqnecam's Iron Age IIA assemblages. Most of the cooking pots of this type are classified as Sub-type CPIIIC1, which begins in the course of the Iron Age IIA and is most typical of that period until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XV-XIII). CP IIIC2 occurs infrequently during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV, and especially Stratum XIV). Graph 11.15. Distribution of CP III cooking pots in the Iron Age CP IV. BROAD COOKING POTS WITH LONG, CONCAVE TRIANGULAR RIM (Fig. 11.21:1-2) The rim is upright, with slight concavity, and its upper edge is rounded. This family constitutes ca. 15% of all the cooking pots uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. It is divided into two main types on the basis of size and shape: CP IVA. Small, delicate cooking pot (Fig. 11.21:1) The rim is thin (diameter: 24-28 cm). Only a few examples were found. PARALLELS . Megiddo VIA (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Fig. 10:11). CHRONOLOGY.

Sometimes there is a depression in the inner wall at the pinched area. This family constitutes 12.2% of all the cooking pots at Tel Yoqnecam. It is further divided into one main and two secondary types: CP VA. Slightly pinched rim (Fig. 11.21:3) This is the most common of the types, constituting ca. 67.5% of the CP V cooking pots. The rim is thin and upright, with a slight depression. Approximately one-third of the rims have a slight thickening at their upper edge and at times a slight depression in their inner wall. The pinching in this type of cooking pot is slight, compared to the other types, and this constitutes a "transitional type" between Type CP IVB and the other CP V types (it is sometimes hard to differentiate between CP IVB and CP VA vessels).

Distribution of CP IX and CP X cooking jugs in the Iron Age CP X. Summary (Graph 11.19) The CP X cooking jugs are characteristic of the Iron Age IIA, replacing the CP IX jugs that were typical of the Iron Age I. The typological distinctions within the CP X family may reflect chronological differences: Type CP XA is more characteristic of the earlier period (Stratum XVI), whereas Type CP XB continues in small quantities into the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). CP XI. BAKING TRAYS (Fig. 11.24) The body of the baking tray is shaped like a simple bowl placed upside-down, with straight or rounded walls. This vessel family constitutes ca. 1.5% of all the cooking ware at Tel Yoqnecam. Sometimes the concave part of the vessel is burnished. Two main types of impression and incision appear on the walls: 1) a number of densely spaced, incised concentric circles, with delicate and deep reed impressions between them (Fig. 11.24:2); and 2) one incised circle en- compassing large, coarse reed impressions (Fig. 11.24:1). A fragment of a baking tray (Fig. 11.24:4) shows a large number of incised broad concentric circles, closely spaced and without reed impressions. The baking trays can be divided into two types, CP XIA and CP XIB, on the basis of their rim shape. Fig. 11.24.

Summary • CP XIA occurs throughout almost the entire Iron Age. • CP XIB, in contrast, is typical of the end of the Iron Age IIA and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XIV and XIII). The type of impression presumably has chronological significance: the delicate reed impressions circumscribed by a number of radial circles are typical of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), while the coarse reed impressions are characteristic of the Iron Age IIA and IIB (Strata XVI-XII). VARIA (Fig. 11.25) CP Varia 1 (Fig. 11.25:1) This cooking pot has a deep elongated body and a long, thick triangular rim, similar to Type CP UIC. Remains of paint survive on one such cooking pot. CP Varia 2 (Fig. 11.25:2) This is an open, broad, carinated cooking pot. The diameter of its rim equals the maximum diameter of the vessel and is wider than the neck's diameter (creating a gutter rim). The rim is upright and rectangular in section. CP Varia 3 (Fig. 11.25:3) This cooking pot has a thick, short triangular rim with a depression in its center. The neck is medium-sized and upright. CP Varia 4 (Fig. 11.25:4) This cooking pot has a folded rim, oval in section, and no neck. The vessel is relatively narrow ( ca . 15 cm in diameter). Photo II.8.

It has been uncovered to date in the valleys in eleventh- and early tenth-century BCE contexts. MARKED COOKING POTS (Figs. 11.26-28; Photos II.9-21) Many cooking pots uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam have various markings on their rims, incised before firing. The stratigraphie context The majority of the marked cooking pots were uncovered in non-indicative contexts or in fills. Most of those occurring in clear stratigraphical contexts are attributed to Stratum XIV (and in those cases where a more exact dating can be determined, to the final phase of the stratum); they were found on floors and in the drainage channel. The few earlier examples were uncovered in fills and may be intrusive. In addition, a few examples were found in a later stratum (one on a Stratum XIII floor and another on a Stratum XII floor); they too may be out of context. It may therefore be determined that the marked cooking pots occur toward the end of the Iron Age IIA and are typical of that period alone. We have little knowledge about such cooking pots in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (very little pottery is attributed to Stratum XIII, including a cook- ing pot with one mark - shaped like a v, perhaps with a tag; see below). Classification according to the cooking pot typology Most of the marked cooking pots belong to Type CP UIC: 59 out of the 78 cooking pots with markings. The prevalence of this type among the marked cooking pots is noteworthy because it diverges from the general trend among the cooking pots: 52.3% of all the cooking pots in Stratum XIV belong to Type CP UIC, compared to 75.6% of the marked cooking pots. The second largest group of marked cooking pots is Type CP IVB: 13 items belong to this category (constituting 16.6% of all the marked cooking pots). A few marked cooking pots belong to types that resemble the two above-mentioned ones. Four examples (5.1% of the marked cooking pots) belong to Type CP HIB, which is close to Type CPIIIC; two items (2.5% of the marked cooking 283</page><page sequence="304">Photo II. 9.

The M-shaped sign is the most common, appearing on ca. 36% (or 32%)2 of the marked cooking pots. The W-shaped sign occurs in ca. 18% (or 16.6%) of the cases. Less frequent are the marks shaped like a ca. 8% (or 12.8%), a v with an additional line, 8% (or 10.2%), a - + sign, 6% (or 9%) and a circle or cluster of circles, 8% (or 5.1%). The other signs recorded - such as the N-shaped sign - appear only in iso- lated cases (Table II.2). The sherd of a cooking pot rim bears a combination of two adjacent signs: Wv (there may also have been additional signs on the missing part, see Fig. 11.27:1). Parallels Marked cooking pots are known from several sites, mainly from the western Jezreel Valley. More were uncovered in the neighboring Tell Qiri (20 examples, Qiri: Figs. 52-53), while a few were found at Tel Qashish, Megiddo, Raqefet Cave and Ramat Hashofet (Qiri: 226; Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a: Fig. 7:6). A few marked cooking pots have been found in the northern coastal region: at Tel Mevorakh, Dor, Shiqmona, Horvat Rosh Zayit and Tell Keisan (Mevorakh I: Fig. 14:5,7; Qiri: 226; Rosh Zayit: Fig. VII.6:8; Keisan: Pis. 92:24, 93:50). Discussion A large concentration of marked cooking pots was uncovered at Tell Qiri, the second largest corpus following Tel Yoqnecam. Within the framework of the Yoqnecam Regional Project, an analysis was conducted of the clay composition of the cooking pots with and without markings, found at Tel Yoqnecam, Tell Qiri and more distant sites: at Tel Mevorakh and Megiddo (see Sharon, Yellin and Perlman 1987; their two-dimensional Smallest Space Analysis diagram, Fig. 55, reproduced here). The analysis suggests that the clay of most of the marked cooking pots originated in the Yoqnecam-Qiri region, and that it is similar to the clay of the cooking pots without markings from those sites.

Those appearing in the "uncertain cases" column are signs that could belong to a number of different groups because the fragment does not contain the full mark: M or N (Fig. 11.26:19-26); N or W (Fig. 11.27:13-16); or 'V/V' (Fig. 11.28:5-13), /+ or // (Fig. 11.28:27-28), V or W (Fig. 11.27:11-12), + or /+ or ++ (Fig. 11.28:19), and a broken sign (Fig. 11.28:22-23). For calculation purposes, the uncertain signs were divided proportionally among the certain signs in the "certain sign" column. For example, the N or W signs (a total of four) were divided according to their relative appearance; thus, one was attributed to N, while three were allocated to the W sign. searchers, "Most of the control material from Qiri and Yoqnecam falls within the same group. It can therefore be confidently stated that the workshop manufacturing marked cooking pots was located at Yoqnecam or Qiri (or at a third site in the immediate vicinity)... At present, no sub-clustering according to mark can be distinguished" (Sharon, Yellin and Perlman 1987: 232). There is a difference in the repertoire, quantity and dis- tribution of the markings found at the two central sites, Tel Yoqnecam and Tell Qiri. 1. The M-shaped mark, together with its variants, occurs on over half of the marked cooking pots at Tell Qiri (Qiri: Fig. 52:6-10). The main component of this group at Tell Qiri consists of variants of the mark (over two-third of the group). At Tel Yoqnecam, approximately one-third of the repertoire occurs with the M-shaped sign alone, with- out its variants. 1 A similar typology of marked cooking pots is evident at Tell Qiri, where numerous such vessels were uncovered. One noteworthy specimen has a narrower rim and is reminiscent of Type CP IIA at Tel Yoqnecam, which appears predominantly in Iron I strata (Area A, Stratum VIII, ~ Qiri : Fig. 28:4). For discussion of the markings incised on the Tell Qiri cooking pots, see below. 2 The first percentage noted takes into account only those signs that have been identified with certainty; the percentage presented in parentheses includes those whose identification is dubious. 292</page><page sequence="313">COOKING VESSELS Smallest Space Analysis diagram (from Sharon, Yellin and Perlman 1987); MG = Megiddo; MV = Mevorakh; Q = Qiri; Y = Yoqnecam 2. The combinations of signs (markings composed of at least two signs) occurring at the two sites, Tell Qiri and Tel Yoqnecam, are different. The only combination apparently occurring at both sites is - +, although it is more common at Tel Yoqnecam. 3. The W-shaped sign is common at Tel Yoqnecam and rare at Tell Qiri. 4. The N-shaped sign occurs in small quantities at Tel Yoqnecam and has not been found at Tell Qiri. The sign shaped like a with or without a tag ('u&gt;), on the other hand, appears in similar frequencies at both sites (constituting close to 20% of all the markings at each of these sites). In our opinion, the minor differences in the composition of the clay from which the various marked cooking pots are produced, coupled with the difference in the repertoire of signs in these sites, suggest the existence of a number of production centers for cooking pots in various sites. What is the significance of the markings on the cooking pots? It seems unlikely that they point to the existence of some kind of ruling administration in the tenth century BCE in the western Jezreel Valley (like the later Imlk jar impres- sions in Judah). After all, the marking occurs on vessels which are clearly domestic in nature and do not serve for storage or for long-distance transportation. The possibility that the markings indicate the vessels' contents is also unlikely, since there are so many different signs. These markings may perhaps be potter's marks. Summary The marked cooking pots at Tel Yoqnecam are dated to the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). They occur in a limited area, primarily in the western Jezreel Valley, at Tel Yoqnecam and Tell Qiri. Most of the marked cooking pots belong to the CP UIC type. A total of 13 different markings have been identified, among which M and W are the most prevalent. CONCLUSIONS The cooking pots constitute the third largest group of vessels at Tel Yoqnecam. The broad cooking pot is the most common cooking vessel at this site from the beginning of the period until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XVIII-XIII). During the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), the globular cooking pots are the most common type (57.3% of all the cooking pots in that stratum). The globular vessels appear in isolated cases as early as the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV), although these belong primarily to the CP VIII family, which is distinct from the other globular cooking pots. The "classical" globular cooking pots appear from the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII, Types CP VIA-B). It should be noted that the broad cooking pots are still very popular in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), where they constitute close to 40% of all the cooking ware. The transition between the two types of vessels - the decline in the number of broad cooking pots together with the increase in the number of globular cooking pots - is evident throughout the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period until the end of the Iron Age (Strata XIII and Phases Xllb and Xlla). As the globular cooking pots, which are smaller than the broad pots, increase in popularity, the frequency of cooking jugs gradually declines. Baking trays occur throughout the Iron Age, albeit in small numbers, except for the Iron Age IIB onward (Strata XII and XI), where they barely occur at all (although their absence may be coincidental).

The second most common cooking pot is Type CP IVB (21%), while Types CP IIA and CP VA occur in smaller, but nev- ertheless significant, numbers (13% and 12% respectively). Globular cooking pots: CP VI-CP VIII The most common kind of globular cooking pot is Type CP VIA, which constitutes 36% of all the globular cooking pots. Together with Type CP VIB, which is similar and belongs to the same family, they constitute 59% of all the globular cooking pots. The CP VII family is less frequent (22%), and the delicate cooking pots (CP VIII) account for 15% of the globular cooking pots. Cooking jugs: CP IX-CP X The most common kind of cooking jug is Type CP XB, which constitutes 42% of all the cooking jugs. Together with Type CPXA, which is similar and belongs to the same family, they constitute 71% of all the cooking jugs. The CP IX family accounts for 29% of the cooking jugs. The typological classification of the cooking ware has clear chronological significance: The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII and XVII (Graph 11.20; Photo 11.22) CP II is the most characteristic cooking pot during this period (50% and 62.5% of the cooking pots in Strata XVIII and Graph 11.20. Distribution of the main types of cooking vessels in the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII) XVII respectively). Type CP IIA is the most common of the types (31% and 49% respectively). The most common family of cooking jugs in the Iron Age I is CP IX. A few types of cooking pots are unique to this period, although occurring infrequently: CP IIIA and CP IVA. Other types, such as CP IIIB, CP IVB and CP VA-B, also occur infrequently, some only at the end of the period, and they continue into the subsequent period. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV (Graph II.21) A large number of the types characteristic of the Iron Age IIA occur during this period for the first time, while others continue from the Iron Age I.

Distribution of the main types of cooking vessels in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV) Some changes are evident in the course of the Iron Age IIA, from the early part of the period (Stratum XVI) until the end (Stratum XIV). Most of the cooking pots in Stratum XV are similar in distribution to those occurring in the later stratum (XIV), although a few types resemble those that appear at the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI). The beginning of the Iron Age HA ( Stratum XVI) This is a transitional stage between the Iron Age I and the Iron Age IIA, with unique characteristics: the main types that appear during this period are CP IIA, CP IVB and CP VA (which reach their greatest distribution during this period and in the subsequent stratum (XV). In addition, cooking jug CP X, which is characteristic of the entire Iron Age IIA, occurs here for the first time. The other types occur less frequently, and can be considered relics of the Iron Age I: CP IIA, CP HIB and CP IVA. The middle and end of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV and XIV) The most common types in this period are CP IIIC1, CP IVB and CP VA. The various types undergo changes in frequency in the two strata: in Stratum XV, Type CP IVB is the most common, followed by Sub-type CP IIIC1 and Type CP VA. In Stratum XIV, on the other hand, Sub-type CP HIC 1 becomes predominant, while Type CP VA occurs in much smaller quantities. Marked cooking pots and pots of the CP IIIC2 sub-type also appear in this period, with the latter occurring primarily at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). The cooking jug most characteristic of the Iron Age IIA is the CPX family, although a few examples of CP IX, typical of the Iron Age I, still occur. In addition to baking tray CPXIA, which is common throughout almost the entire Iron Age, another baking tray appears: Type CPXIB, which is unique to the end of the Iron Age IIA and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XIV-XIII). The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII (Graph 11.22) Most of the cooking pots of this period continue the tradition of cooking pots from the end of the Iron Age IIA. However, a number of new types appear as well: these have globular bodies, a precursor of the cooking pots that are to become typical of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). The types char- acteristic of the transitional period are: CP UIC 1, CP IVB, CP IIA, CP VIA and CP VA (which constitute 34%, 20%, 6%, 15% and 8.5% of the cooking pots respectively). Type CP VIB originates in this period, albeit in small quantities. Two types of baking trays, CP XI A and CP XIB, appear during this period in equal quantities. Graph 11.22. Distribution of the main types of cooking vessels in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period and the Iron Age IIB (Strata XIII-XII) The Iron Age IIB: Stratum XII (Graph 11.22) Globular cooking pots are the most dominant ones during this period. The most common of these is Type CP VIA (20.2%), followed by Types CP VIB, CP VII and CP VIII (13.7%, 13.7% and 7.7% respectively). The broad cooking pots are still very common during this period, the most prevalent sub-type being CPIIIC1 (constituting 17%), fol- lowed by Type CP IVB (8%). Cooking jugs hardly appear at all during this period. The Iron Age III: Stratum XI Most of the various types of cooking pots, particularly the globular ones which occur at the end of the Iron Age IIB (Phase Xlla), continue in this period.

For their distribution according to strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. The typology of storage jars, like that of other vessels, is based upon the shape of the body. A number of types may be defined on the basis of their clay and firing, as well as on the basis of particular aspects of the treatment of the vessel, evident on the handles, or grooves on the shoulder, etc. These types include the "hippo" jars, conical and "sausage-like" jars (SJ IIA, SJ IIIA and SJ IVB). A large percentage of the jar and jug rims - particularly the simple ones - cannot be attributed with certainty to any specific vessel shape. The rims of storage jars are presented in a separate rim typology (see below, pp. 308-309 and Fig. 11.35). S J I. OVOID STORAGE JARS (Fig. 11.29) This is the most common family of storage jar at Tel Yoqnecam (constituting ca. 37% of the storage jars uncov- ered at the site). This jar has a medium to tall neck, a rounded shoulder, at times slightly carinated, two loop handles and a rounded/slightly flattened base. These vessels range be- tween 50-65 cm in height. This family can be further divided into three types with two different body shapes and various rims: Types S J I A and SJ IB have an inflated body, a tall neck and an elongated shoulder, while Type SJ IC has a narrower body, a medium to tall neck and a short, emphasized shoulder. Decoration S J I A and S J IB storage jars occur infrequently with red wash (&lt; ca . 2.5%; see, for example, Figs. 1.15:4-5, 1.17:2). Red wash also occurs on ovoid storage jars from neighboring sites, such as Megiddo VIA (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Figs. 7:4, 9:11) and Rosh Zayit IIa ( Rosh Zayit : Fig. 111.92:2). Body sherds of ovoid storage jars, decorated with red monochrome horizontal lines, as well as one storage jar with a more complex decoration (Fig. 1.22:17), were found at Tel Yoqnecam. The storage jar is decorated in its upper part with groups of parallel horizontal lines above and below the handles, creating a band around the jar's belly. Within this band, around the handles, there are tryglyphs filled with straight vertical lines, interspersed with wavy lines. In the center of the band a single palm tree may be reconstructed. In addition, above the upper horizontal lines one may discern a pattern composed of triangles. The surviving jar handle is decorated with three intersecting lines, and there is a finger impression at the top of the handle (for a detailed discussion of the decoration, see Zarzecki-Peleg 1997b: 52-61). Parallels The decorated storage jars continue the tradition of the Late Bronze Age II "domestic" storage jars. This type of storage jar, bearing a decoration of horizontal bands alone, is also common during the Iron Age I, for example, at Megiddo VIIA-VIA and Tombs 237 and 221B {Megiddo II: Pis. 68:2, 73:10; Megiddo Tombs : PI. 72:1,13), Beth Shean VI (Beth Shean I: Figs. 49:5, 51:15), 2, 4 (. Beth Shean II: Figs. 9:9, 32:4,5) and Pella UIC, Phase Ib (Pella: Pl. 122:14). A few examples bear a more complex decoration (more common on kraters). A storage jar resembling the decorated jar from Tel Yoqnecam was discovered at Afula, in the eastern cemetery (Dothan 1955: Fig. 20:14). A similar decoration also appears on an amphoriskos from Tell el-Farcah (S) (Duncan 1930: PI. 44: F 552). S J IA. Ridge beneath the rim (Fig. 11.29:1-3) This storage jar has an upright neck with a ridge close to the rim. There is usually a depression on the inner side of the neck. Approximately 40% of all the S J I storage jars belong to this type. A smaller, narrower version of SJ IA occurs infrequently (see, for example, Fig. 1.29:19; Photo 11.23). Two of these storage jars have a third handle, equidistant from the two other handles, extending from the ridge to the shoulder (see, for example, Fig. 11.29:3; Photo 11.24). Two sub-types, SJ IA1 and SJ IA2, have been distin- guished on the basis of their rim shape: SJIAl. Simple rim (Fig. 11.29:1; Photo 11.25) This is the most common sub-type of S J IA rims (constituting ca. 67% of the SJ IA jars). PARALLELS.

Sub-type SJ IA1 is characteristic of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII, where it constitutes ca. 18.7% and 27.7% of the S J IA jars respectively). It continues to appear, although less frequently, during the first part of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI and XV); after that, its distribution becomes extremely limited. SJIA2. Shaped rim (Fig. 11.29:2) The rim of this sub-type is generally triangular; the ridge, situated close to the rim, is sometimes pronounced, forming part of the rim.

CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type reaches its greatest popu- larity at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). No earlier examples were found. It continues to appear throughout the Iron Age II, albeit infrequently. SJ IB. Thickened rim (Fig. 11.29:4; Photo 11.26) This storage jar has a slightly everted neck, often with a ridge where the neck joins the shoulder. The rim has an elongated section, and its external side is flat. Similar rims occur during the Late Bronze Age, although their section is thicker and the upper part of their rim is more pointed. This type constitutes ca. 39.5% of all the SJ I storage jars. 298</page><page sequence="319">STORAGE JARS Photo 11.26. Storage jar SJ IB These jars are made of two different types of clay: one is light with white grits, while the other is orange/red (sandy?) and well fired. The S J IB jars are generally larger than the SJ IA vessels, and the emphasized shoulder is broader. In these cases, the vessels walls, beneath the shoulder, are straighter, heralding the beginning of one of the forms most typical of the Iron Age IIA (see below, SJ II). PARALLELS .

CLXIX:2); and Tell Keisan 9a-b (. Keisan : Pl. 58:2). CHRONOLOGY. Type SJ IB is a development of the Late Bronze Age "domestic" storage jar (see Amiran 1969: 142-143, PI. 44), which appears at many sites, for example at Megiddo VIII (Megiddo II: PI. 60:2,4); and Hazor 1, Lower City (Hazor I: Pis. CIX:4,5, CXXIX:l-6). This type is characteristic of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII), reaching its greatest popularity at the beginning of the period (it is the predominant storage jar in Stratum XVIII, in which it constitutes 62.5% of all the storage jars). It gradually declines in appearance during the Iron Age IIA, hardly occurring at all at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). For detailed discussion of this type, see Zarzecki-Peleg 1997b: 47-49. SJ IC. Short emphasized shoulder (Fig. 11.29:5-7) This type of storage jar has an upright or inverted neck and rim. A slight depression sometimes occurs on the inner side of the rim. The vessel walls expand slightly below the handles, a form reminiscent of the sack-shaped vessels. Type S J IC is less common than S J I A and S J IB, and constitutes ca. 20% of the SJ I storage jars. It is further divided into three sub-types on the basis of the shape of its thickened rim (although at times the differ- ences are indistinct). S J ICI. Slightly thickened rim (Fig. 11.29:5; Photo 11.27) The rim is generally convex. Close to half the SJ IC storage jars belong to this sub-type. Photo 11.27. Storage jar S J ICI PARALLELS. Rosh Zayit IIa (Rosh Zayit : Figs. 111.84:3, 111.92:9); and Hazor IX (Hazor III-IV: PI. CCIX:13). CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type first appears during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV), and occurs mainly during this period until the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). Later, in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII) and the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), it declines in frequency. SJ IC2. Elongated triangular rim, convex and extended downward (Fig. 11.29:6) The neck of this vessel is particularly wide. There is a sharp transition between the lower edge of the rim and the neck (in contrast to the rest of the sub-types). In many cases, there are incisions on one of the handles. 299</page><page sequence="320">CHAPTER FIFTEEN PARALLELS.

Sub-type SJ IC3 first occurs at the begin- ning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI), and continues to appear, although with lower frequency, throughout the Iron Age II (Strata XV-XII). SJ I, Summary (Graph 11.23) The SJ I storage jar is the most common family to appear at Tel Yoqnecam. It is divided into two different body shapes, which are chronologically significant. Graph 11.23. Distribution of SJ I storage jars in the Iron Age • SJ IA and S J IB have a somewhat inflated body and an elongated shoulder, typical of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII). They continue to appear, although infre- quently, during the first part of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI and XV). • SJIC, with its relatively narrow body and a short, empha- sized shoulder, occurs later, and is characteristic mainly of the Iron Age IIA. • SJ IA1 is characteristic of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII), although it reaches its greatest popularity at the end of that period (Stratum XVII). • SJ IA2 occurs mainly at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). • SJ IB is typical of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII), reaching its greatest popularity at the beginning of this period (Stratum XVIII). • S J IC first appears in the Iron Age IIA. • SJ ICI mainly occurs during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV), and declines in frequency in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period and the Iron Age IIB. • SJ IC2 is less frequent at Tel Yoqnecam, occurring mainly at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV) and in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII). • SJ IC3 occurs from the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI), continuing less frequently throughout the Iron Age II (Strata XV-XII). SJ II. STORAGE JARS WITH SQUAT BODY AND WIDE BASE (Fig. 11.30) The proportions between the width and height of this vessel differ from those of the other storage jars: SJ II is wider and shorter than the others. The jar has a short wide shoulder, with a gentle carination. Two loop handles extend from the carination to the body. The combination of the short shoulder and the wide base form a "square-like" body. SJ II storage jars occur infrequently at Tel Yoqnecam (constituting ca. 6% of all the storage jars). It is likely that some of the rims presented in the separate rim typology (see discussion below) in fact belong to this family of storage jars. SJ IIA. The "hippo" jar (Fig. 11.30:1-5) This jar, termed "hippo" in the literature (Alexandre 1995: 77-88), has a medium to tall ridged neck and a thickened rim of various shapes. There is usually a depression in the inner wall of the neck, below the ridge. A number of concentric grooves appear on the shoulder. The base is rounded. At times there are incisions on the handle(s) (see discussion below). Some of these storage jars have relatively upright walls and a wide base, while others have somewhat rounded walls and a narrower base. The classification of these vessels is based in part upon parallels from other sites, since excava- tions at Tel Yoqnecam did not yield complete vessels of all sub-types. The jars are generally produced from special grayish-green clay and at times from dark red clay with white grits. The vessel is well fired. This type constitutes ca. 63% of all the SJ II vessels A number of sub-types were distinguished at Tel Yoqnecam, based upon the rim shape: S J IIA1.

The vessel has a simple or slightly thickened rim and a rounded base. Only a few storage jars found at Tel Yoqnecam can be attributed with certainty to this type. Nonetheless, it is likely that many of the rims classified in the rim typology in fact belonged to S J IIB storage jars. PARALLELS.

Summary • S J IIA is the most common of the SJ II types. Its classi- fication into further sub-types is of chronological signif- icance: • S J IIA1 (the predominant "hippo" jar) lasted for a rela- tively long period: it occurs during the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV) until the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), reaching its greatest popularity at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). • SJ IIA2 occurs at Tel Yoqnecam only at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). • SJ IIA3 is a relatively late development, occurring only in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). • SJ IIB occurs from the Iron Age IIA onwards (Strata XV and XIV). Its frequency diminishes during the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). • SJ IIC is rare, occurring at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). SJ III. CONICAL STORAGE JARS (Fig. 11.31) The body is elongated, its upper part at times with parallel walls. The maximum diameter of the vessel is at the shoul- ders; the rim is simple and upright. Two loop handles extend from the carinated shoulder to the body. Few storage jars can be attributed with certainty to this family. However, as in the case of Type S J IIB, it is likely that many of the rims included in the rim typology in fact belong to S J IIIA-B storage jars. This family constitutes 7.4% of all the storage jars uncov- ered at Tel Yoqnecam. It can be divided into three types: SJ IIIA, SJ HIB and SJ UIC. SJ IIIA. Pronounced shoulder and nipple base (Fig. 11.31:1; Photo 11.29) This type of storage jar generally has a short neck and a simple or slightly thickened rim. The jar is made of sandy Fig. 11.31.

Horizontal shoulder and pointed base (Fig. 11.31:3-4) No complete storage jar of this type was found at Tel Yoqnecam. Nevertheless, the shape of the body can be determined on the basis of parallels: it has a shorter body than the other two types and a short shoulder. A total of 80% of the examples of this type belong to S J IIIC1. S J IIIC1. Pointed rim (Fig. 11.31:3) The neck is particularly short.

NARROW, ELONGATED STORAGE JARS (Fig. 11.32) This family of storage jars has a short neck or, in rare cases, no neck at all. There is a clear distinction between Type SJ IVA, on the one hand, and Types SJ IVB and SJ IVC, on the other. S J IVA has a soft elongated shoulder, and, accord- ing to the parallels, a rounded base. The other types, SJ IVB and SJ IVC, have a short, sharply carinated shoulder, with two generally distorted and relatively small loop handles extending from it. These types have a pointed base. This family constitutes ca. 13% of all the storage jars uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. SJ IVA. Cylindrical storage jar with slightly carinated shoulder (Fig. 11.32:1) The lower part of the walls broaden slightly, the neck is short and the upright rim is either simple or slightly thick- ened, at times ridged. Few examples can be attributed with certainty to Type S J IVA, and it appears that, as in Types S J IIB and S J IIIA-B, many rims that have been included in the separate rim typology in fact belonged to SJ IVA storage jars. This type constitutes ca. 6% of all the SJ IV jars. PARALLELS. Megiddo IVB-VA (Zarzecki-Peleg, forth- coming: Figs. 25:4, 26:3). CHRONOLOGY.

SJ IVB. Cylindrical storage jar with carinated shoulder (Fig. 11.32:2-3) This storage jar has a slightly concave wall and a slightly convex shoulder with a number of concentric grooves. The vessel has a short neck and an upright thickened rim, gen- erally rectangular in section. There is often a depression on the inside of the rim. This storage jar is made of orange-yellowish clay (these jars are called "sausage-like" and/or "torpedo" jars in the literature, see Amiran 1969: 242, PL 81:6-7). This is the most common of the S J IV storage jars (constituting 62% of all the S J IV jars at Tel Yoqnecam and approximately one-quarter of the Iron Age IIB jars [Stratum XII]). The S J IVB storage jars are further divided into two sub-types, occurring in equal quantities: SJ IVB1.

CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type first appears in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), with low fre- quency. It is typical primarily of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), continuing to occur, although with low frequency, in the Iron Age III (Strata XII/XI, XI). SJ IVB2. Ridgeless neck (Fig. 11.32:3) PARALLELS.

This sub-type first occurs in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), with low fre- quency, and is typical of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). S J IVC. Sack-shaped storage jar with empha- sized shoulder and pointed base (Fig. 11.32:4-5) This storage jar has a particularly short carinated shoulder. In many cases the carination is emphasized by a depression or ridge below it. The walls of the vessel are concave in their upper part, broadening toward the bottom. This type is common, constituting 32% of all the SJ IV storage jars at Tel Yoqnecam. S J IVC1. Ledge rim and short to medium upright neck (Fig. 11.32:4) The neck is extremely convex, and there is evidence of a degenerate fold on the rim. At times there is an inner depression on the rim. This is the most common of the S J IVC sub-types, constituting 75% of all the examples. PARALLELS.

Only a few examples of this sub-type occur in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), and it is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). A number of examples occur in the Iron Age III (Strata XII/XI, XI). SJ IVC2. Neckless with infolded rim (Fig. 11.32:5) This storage jar has a particularly short shoulder. The thin rim is extended downward and inverted, continuing the line of the shoulder. The vessel is generally made of yellowish clay with a red core. This storage jar appears in two sizes: one elongated (Fig. 11.32:5) and the other short, occurring in the Persian period at Tel Yoqnecam. PARALLELS. Tell Keisan 5 ( Keisan : PL 47:1a, 2); 4 (.

Summary (Graph 11.24) The typological sub-division of the S J IV storage jars has clear chronological significance: • SJ IVA occurs in the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), declin- ing in frequency in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). • SJ IVB first occurs in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), increasing in frequency and reach- ing its greatest popularity in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). Its frequency declines significantly in the Iron Age III (Strata XII/XI, XI). • SJ IVB2 does not appear any later than Stratum XII. • S J IVC1 parallels Type SJ IVB in its chronological dis- tribution, although its frequency is low throughout the period. 306</page><page sequence="327">STORAGE JARS Graph 11.24. Distribution of SJ IV storage jars in the Iron Age • SJ IVC2 occurs predominantly in the Iron Age III (Strata XII/XI, XI). SJ V. HOLEMOUTH STORAGE JARS (Fig. 11.33) This is a neckless storage jar with a distinctly infolded rim. On the basis of parallels, the jar is relatively small, lacks handles and has a wide rounded base. The vessel's opening is wide in relation to the body, reaching almost the maximum diameter of the vessel. This family constitutes 5% of all the storage jars uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam in the Iron Age strata. SJ VA. Smooth rim (Fig. 11.33:1-2) Most of the SJ V jars at Tel Yoqnecam belong to this type.

SJ VI. SACK-SHAPED STORAGE JARS (Fig. 11.34) Only rims of this family of storage jars were found at Tel Yoqnecam; the reconstruction of the vessel's shape is there- fore based on parallels. The jar has an upright triangular rim or a short ledge rim with a slight depression, and a degenerate ridge where the short to medium neck joins the shoulder. This family is rare at Tel Yoqnecam.

For this reason, they were not included in the main typology of storage jars (which, as aforementioned, is based upon the shape of the vessel's body). The rims in the rim typology constitute ca. 30% of the storage jars, and can be attributed to the following types of jars: SJ ICI, SJ IIB, SJ IIIA-B and SJ IVA. S JR I.

(It should be borne in mind, however, that the sample from this stratum is relatively small.) Thereafter it declines significantly in popularity, constituting close to 10% of all the storage-jar rims in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV) and in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII). In the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), it decreases in frequency even further, to 2.5% of all the rims of storage jars in that stratum. SJR I. Summary • SJR I rims are the most common in the rim typology. • Type SJR IA, the most common type, begins to appear at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), but occurs mainly during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV), later declining slightly in frequency until the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). • Type SJR IB occurs relatively infrequently throughout the entire Iron Age, from its beginning (Stratum XVIII), with the exception of the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI), where it is the most common type.

Triple thumb impressions (Fig. 11.36:3) The impressions are arranged horizontally. Summary: thumb impressions The thumb impressions (Type A) are the most common markings appearing on storage-jar handles. In most examples (a total of 11), the mark consists of only one thumb impres- sion, while in some cases it is a combination of two or three impressions (four and two cases respectively). Type A im- pressions generally occur on the ovoid storage jars (SJ I). In most of the examples in which both handles were preserved, the impression occurs on only one handle. These impressions begin to appear in the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), but are characteristic of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV). B. Reed impressions (Fig. 11.36:4-6) Bl.

Complex incision (Fig. 11.36:12) Summary: incisions A few examples were uncovered of incisions made upon handles of storage jars, termed Type C. These markings differ one from the other, occurring from the beginning of the Iron Age I until the end of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVIII-XIV). The vertical-line and V-shaped incisions (CI and C2) are characteristic of "hippo" jars (SJ IIA), while the I-shaped incision (C4) often appears on the "Taanach" stor- age jars (Sub-type S J IC2), which are common in the western Jezreel Valley. SUMMARY Storage jars are common among the vessels uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. The most common family is S J I, and S J IV is the second largest (although it occurs in significantly lower quantities). It should be noted that close to one-third of the storage-jar rims could not be attributed to a specific family with certainty. The frequency of occurrence of the various families and types changes chronologically. The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII (Graph 11.25) The most common family of storage jars at Tel Yoqnecam in this period is the ovoid jar: S J I A and S J IB (together accounting for over 80% of all the storage jars in the strata). There is a clear chronological division between these two types in the course of the Iron Age I: at the beginning (Stratum XVIII), Type SJ IB is the most common (67% of all the storage jars in the stratum, compared to 20% attributed to SJ IA), while at the end of the period (Stratum XVII), the two types occur in similar proportions (38% of S J IB and 40% of SJ IA). Graph 11.25. Distribution of main families and types of storage jars in the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII) In addition, storage jar S J III A, which originated from Phoenicia, appears at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), with low frequency (constituting ca. 6% of all the storage jars in that stratum). At the beginning of the period (Stratum XVIII), the most common rims (in the rim typology) are those belonging to jars with medium to tall neck (Types SJR IB and SJR IIB). At the end of the period (Stratum XVII), the rims of Type SJR IA - short-necked jars - become the most common. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV (Graph 11.26) The beginning of the Iron Age IIA: Stratum XVI The most common shape of storage jar in this period is still the ovoid vessel. Nonetheless, a difference is evident in the occurrence of storage jars from the previous period. Note- worthy is the appearance of Sub-type SJ IC3 in this period (constituting 15% of all the storage jars in this stratum). SJ IA and SJ IB continue from the preceding period, al- though they decline significantly in popularity (each type constituting ca. 8% of all the storage jars in that stratum). The simple rim (SJR I) is the most common family, with most examples belonging to the tall-necked variant, Type SJR IB. 312 70i I □ XVIII 60- UxVII 50 - 40 - I 20 - ■ 10 - I o - ' i » i - - WLJ - - ftlR HR Q IR IR ft.

Distribution of main families and types of storage jars in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV) The Iron Age IIA: Stratum XV During this period the ovoid storage jars continue to be the most common family, constituting approximately one-half of all the storage jars in that stratum: Types S J I A and S J IB continue, although with lower frequency than in the Iron Age I (18% and 23% respectively). A new sub-type, S J ICI, now occurs (constituting 8% of all the storage jars in the stratum). Another new type, the squat, broad-based storage jar (the SJ II family, with two types, SJ IIA1 and SJ IIB) first appears in this period, although still with low frequency. The simple rim (SJR I) is the most common one, and most of the examples belong to the short-necked variant (Type SJR IA). The end of the Iron Age IIA : Stratum XIV In addition to the continuity of some of the previously noted types, a number of new types appear: SJ IC2, SJ IIA2 (typical only of this period), SJ IVA and SJ VAI. The "hippo" jar, S J IIA1, reaches its greatest popularity in this period (con- stituting 11.2% of all the storage jars in that stratum). The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII (Graph 11.27) A number of types of narrow, elongated storage jars (the S J IV family) first appear in this period, namely Type S J IVB and Sub-type S J IVC1, although in relatively small quanti- ties. The other storage jars that occur during the transitional period are already present at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), such as SJ IC and SJ IIA, although at times with different frequencies. Graph 11.27. Distribution of main families and types of storage jars in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period and the Iron Age IIB (Strata XIII-XII) The Iron Age IIB: Stratum XII (Graph 11.27) The most common storage jar in this period is the cylindrical jar with the carinated shoulder - the "sausage-like" jar (SJ IVB), which constitutes 25% of all the storage jars in that stratum. Additional jars characterize this period, al- though they appear much less frequently compared to the former type. These include: SJ IIA3 (which is a late devel- opment of the "hippo" jars), S J IIIC1 and S J IIIC2 (the latter appearing for the first time in this period and in very small quantities), SJ VA2 and SJ VI. Type SJR I A is the most common type of rim in the rim typology. The Iron Age III: Strata XII/XI-XI The most common storage jar in this period is the one with the horizontal shoulder, pointed base and pointed rim (Sub-type SJIIIC1), which constitutes over 30% of all the storage jars in the stratum. A number of additional types of storage jars, S J IVB, SJ IVC1-2, SJ VA2 and SJ VI, occur with lower frequency, representing a continuation from the preceding period. 313 50 i __ 45 . fixVI __ □ XV 40 " BXIV 35 - 30 - 25 " 20 - ;= I I n I I fi j II h II I ll o I I I I I ■i ry m I fi II II ll ¿•V ^VWV" ** S / ** o* o* 30 -1 25 . laxiiil ■ XII 20 - 15- •ti 'iñ Jí .i IL Ai V///^4W/Ä'w</page><page sequence="334">CHAPTER SIXTEEN PITHOI Very few pithoi have been uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam (a total of 30 pithoi and pithos sherds). For their distribution according to strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. The pithoi resemble some of the jars in contour, although they are much larger. They have a large elongated body, thick walls, rounded shoulders and two handles extending from the shoulder. Some bear rope impressions on their body, around and below the handles.

CHRONOLOGY. This family has a long life-span: it first occurs at the beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII), increasing in popularity at the end of the Iron Age I and the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVII-XVI), and then decreasing in frequency. SUMMARY The pithoi are rare among the ceramic assemblage of Tel Yoqnecam. The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII Stratum XVIII, at the beginning of the Iron Age I, is characterized by the appearance of P I A pithoi. Type P IB and the P II family occur concurrently, although in smaller quantities. Stratum XVII, at the end of the Iron Age I, is characterized by an absence of pithoi, in comparison to the large quantity of jars. The few pithoi occurring in this period belong to Type P IC and to the P II family. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV The occurrence of pithoi gradually declines in the course of this period. The P II pithoi are characteristic of Stratum XVI, and continue with low frequency until the end of the Iron Age II. Type P IB appears in Stratum XV. 316</page><page sequence="337">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN AMPHORAE Very few amphorae have been uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam: a total of six amphorae and sherds. For their distribution according to strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. A I. AMPHORAE WITH SPOUTS (Fig. 11.38:1-2) This family of amphorae has two handles extending from the shoulder and a spout between the handles, slightly below the shoulder. For a discussion of this family, see Qasile II: 59; Taanach : 18; Tappy 1992: 222-224. The amphorae are classified into two types, AIA and A IB, on the basis of their body shape. A IA. Carinated body (Fig. 11.38:1; Photo II.31) This amphora has a biconical body with a slight carination at the shoulder and a narrow, pinched cylindrical spout between its two loop handles. On the basis of parallels it may be reconstructed as having a tall neck and a ring base. It generally has a monochrome dark red/brown decoration above the body's carination. The decoration consists of clusters of parallel horizontal bands at the shoulder and the center of the body, forming a band around the belly. Within this band, on either side of the spout, there are tryglyphs, with a pattern of straight parallel lines with a wavy line in the middle (the decoration on the amphora illustrated in Fig. I.23:10 is particularly worn). This type occurs in two sizes: small and large (maximum diameter: 20 and 30 cm respec- tively). PARALLELS. Megiddo VI-V, fill under IV?

Degenerate carinated body (Fig. 11.38:2; Photo 11.32) This amphora is relatively small and is more rounded than Type A IA; it has a tall neck and a disk base. The spout is straight and smaller than that of A IA. The vessel from Tel Yoqnecam has a ridge under the rim and a depression in its inner wall (resembling the rims of J IC jugs). The amphora is slipped, burnished and decorated with clusters of horizon- tal black lines above and below the handle. PARALLELS.

On the basis of parallels it may be determined that the vessel has a globular body, a molded rim and a wide neck. Three loop handles are attached symmetrically around the neck, close to the rim, with a spout instead of a fourth handle. PARALLELS .

Nonetheless, there is a clear chronological distinction between the various types: The type of amphora characteristic of the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII) is A IA. Type A IB appears at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV), while the A II family appears in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). 319</page><page sequence="340">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN JUGS A total of 817 jugs were found in undisturbed contexts at Tel Yoqnecam, constituting 20% of all the vessels uncovered. For their distribution according to strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. The vast majority of these jugs ( ca . 800) have a wide opening. Jugs come in diverse body shapes and have a variety of different types of rims. Most of the jugs uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam are not complete; in many cases the body did not survive.1 Similar rims sometimes occur on different types of jugs, particularly the wide rims (Type J IA, Family J IV or J V). These rims cannot be attributed with certainty to any specific type, since the main typology of the jugs (Types J I-J VII) is based upon vessel shape. For this reason, a separate typology has been compiled for these rims, based upon their shape (JR I and JR II; see Fig. 11.43 and discussion below). Most of the jugs from Tel Yoqnecam are included in the rim typology {ca. 80% of all the Tel Yoqnecam jugs), compared to a relatively small number of vessels {ca. 20% of the Tel Yoqnecam jugs) included in the main typology. Percentages are therefore included only in the discussion of the rim types, with the exception of Type J IB in the jug typology. Since a large proportion of the items included in the main typology belong to this type2 (16.5% out of the 20%), percentages are given in this case. Because of the significance of the main typology to the understanding of the development of the jugs, both in terms of shape and chronological development, this chapter begins with this typology despite the paucity of examples. The number of examples of each type appearing in each stratum is mentioned in the discussion below. J I. WIDE-NECKED JUGS (Fig. 11.39) This jug has a globular or slightly carinated body, a tall neck and a ring base. The rim is upright, sometimes with an inner depression. The opening of the vessel is circular {ca. 5 cm in diameter) or trefoil. The handle extends from the rim to the body. This family is divided into two types, JIA and JIB, on the basis of rim shape. J IA. Simple, slightly thickened rim (Fig. 11.39:1-2) The rim is sometimes emphasized by a carination on its outer side. PARALLELS.

Only a few examples were uncovered in which the vessel's shape is identifiable. Nevertheless, a comparison with parallels from other sites suggests that a large number of rims included in the JR I and II families of the rim typology in fact belong to Jug Type J IA. If this is correct, Type J IA would be the most common jug at Tel Yoqnecam (see discussion of Rim Types JRI and JRII below). The complete examples found (a total of four) occur in different periods throughout the Iron Age: one in the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), two in the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV) and one at the end of the Iron Age (Strata XII/XI-XI). J IB. Ridged rim (Fig. 11.39:3-4) This type of jug has a ridge at the base of the rim, generally with a slight inner depression. Some of the jugs have a trefoil rim. The rim of Type J IB occurs on this jug type only. It is therefore strongly represented in the main typology, in com- parison to other types, whose rims were included in the rim typology (particularly Type J IA, see discussion above). Two sub-types were identified at Tel Yoqnecam. J IBI. Shaped rim (Fig. 11.39:3) This jug has a thickened prominent rim, rectangular in section; the neck varies in height. Similar rims occur on storage jars S J IA2, as well as on amphorae A IB. 1 At times it is difficult to determine with certainty whether a rim sherd belongs to a jug or storage jar. In these cases, the distinction is based upon the wall thickness: the thick rims are classified as storage jars and the thin ones as jugs. 2 Type J IB is characterized by a ridged rim, which occurs on only one type of jug; hence it is included in the main typology (for discussion, see below). 320</page><page sequence="341">JUGS Fig. 11.39.

Most of the J IB examples belong to Sub-type J IBI (ca. 95%), which occurs throughout the Iron Age. It is common in the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII, constituting 19.1% and 14.6% of all the jugs in these strata respectively), becoming less common in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV), and increasing in popularity once again 321</page><page sequence="342">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII, constituting 23.8% of all the jugs). It continues to appear in significant quantities until the end of the Iron Age. J IB2. Simple rim (Fig. 11.39:4) This type of vessel has a very tall neck and a trefoil rim. PARALLELS. Megiddo VB (red-slipped, with delicate rim, Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Fig. 18:11); and Taanach IIB ( Taanach : Fig. 59:4). CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type occurs in small numbers, and is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). J I. Summary This is the most common of the jug families uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. It is characteristic of the entire Iron Age, with the exception of Sub-type J IB2, which is typical of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). J II. JUGS WITH RIDGED, MEDIUM- WIDTH NECKS (Fig. 11.40:1-2) This jug has a tall neck and a thickened handle, which extends from the ridge to the body. The rim is thickened, and assumes a variety of shapes. Some of these jugs are red-slipped. PARALLELS. Taanach IIB ( Taanach : Fig. 37:1, with me- dium to wide neck); Hazor VIII ( Razor II: PI.

The few examples found are from various periods of the Iron Age: one from the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), one from the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV) and one from the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). J III. NARROW-NECKED JUGS (Fig. 11.40:3-4) This jug has rounded walls, a tall neck and a ring base. The vessel is smaller than the other jugs (average height: ca. 17 cm). The handle extends from the middle of the non-ridged neck to the shoulder. Some of these jugs are decorated with horizontal lines in the area of the shoulder. The family can be divided into two types, J IIIA and J HIB. J IIIA. Upright neck (Fig. 11.40:3) PARALLELS.

A few examples occur at Tel Yoqnecam at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). J III. Summary This family is characteristic of the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). J IV. DIPPER JUGS (Fig. 11.40:5) This jug resembles a dipper juglet in shape, but is much larger. It has a wide, tall neck and a slightly thickened, trefoil rim. PARALLELS .

A few examples were found, dating from the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). J V. STRAINER JUGS (Fig. 11.40:6-7) The strainer jugs display a number of variants in terms of body shape; they have a wide neck, a basket handle and usually a ring base. Some are imitations of Philistine ware. Some of the jugs are not decorated, while others bear various decorations, either bichrome or monochrome.

This family is rare at Tel Yoqnecam. The jugs are further classified into two types, J VA and J VB, based on their body shape. J VA. Globular body (Fig. 11.40:6) The handle of this jug type has been reconstructed as a basket handle, since there is no sign of a loop handle on the shoulder, which has survived in its entirety. Strainer jugs with rounded body and a basket handle occur in the reper- toire of Philistine ware (see Type 7; Dothan 1982: 155-157), although at Tel Yoqnecam this jug is not decorated (for discussion of this vessel type, see Zarzecki-Peleg 1997b: 71). PARALLELS. Most of the rounded strainer jugs have loop handles, unlike the Tel Yoqnecam jug. For examples of rounded jugs with an ear handle, see: Tell Keisan 9c ( Keisan : PL 71:8); Tell Qasile X ( Qasile II: Fig. 51:1); and Tel Masos II 0 Masos . PL 161:9). In some of the rounded jugs, it is difficult to determine the type of handle. For example, see: Beth Shean VI (Beth Shean I: Fig. 56:7); Tell Abu Hawam IV (Abu Hawam : PL 17:8 47.1738); and Beth Shemesh III (Beth Shemesh IV: Pl. LX:24). CHRONOLOGY. One example of this type was found at Tel Yoqnecam, dating from the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). J VB. Biconical body (Fig. 11.40:7) This type includes vessels of two different sizes: large and small. The body shape is defined as Type 17 in the repertoire of Philistine ware (although the latter are smaller jugs). The vessels of this type found at Tel Yoqnecam3 include a number of different styles of decoration: JVB1. Phoenician bichrome decoration (Fig. 1.17:7; Photo 11.33) This decoration consists of two groups of horizontal black bands, with a broad red band between them (similar to the decorative style of the bichrome family). These two groups are located around the two carinations, leaving a wide non-decorated register between them, where the strainer appears. This decoration style appears on relatively large vessels.

Philistine decoration (Fig. 1.31:4; Fig. 11.40:7) Two smaller vessels were found with this decorative style: one with bichrome and the other with monochrome decora- tion. This body shape is defined as Type 17 in the Philistine ceramic repertoire (according to T. Dothan, Type 17 appears at the final stage of this ware; for discussion, see Dothan 1982: 148-149, 191). Jug with bichrome decoration (Fig. 1.31:4; Photo 11.34). - This jug has a decorated area in the center of the body, between the two carinations. The decoration is bordered by Photo 11.34.

PARALLELS. No parallels were found bearing the entire decorative composition occurring on the Tel Yoqnecam jug. The checkerboard pattern is common in the Philistine rep- ertoire; see Dothan 1982: 132-155 (Type 6), Figs. 22:2, 23:2; Qasile II: Fig. 32:7. Jug with monochrome decoration (Fig. 11.40:7). - This jug's decoration consists of parallel horizontal bands in the center of the body and on the shoulder, forming a central strip encircling the jug, decorated with a zigzag pattern (composed of three parallel lines). The neck and rim bear additional horizontal bands. For a discussion of this vessel, see Zarzecki-Peleg 1997b: 71-72. PARALLELS .

Summary This jug is characteristic of the end of the Iron Age I at Tel Yoqnecam (Stratum XVII). For a comprehensive discussion of this family, see Zarzecki-Peleg 1997b: 73. J VI. PHOENICIAN BICHROME GLOBULAR JUGS (Fig. 11.41) The bichrome jugs are decorated with concentric circles composed of a broad red band bordered on both sides by thin black bands. The decoration is divided into two circles, an inner and outer one, separated by a non-decorated area. Most of the vessels are burnished. In a few cases there is a white paint decoration between the circles. Two different types of material can be distinguished: some of the vessels are made of a sandy clay, while others are produced from a different material and have a grayish hue on their inner wall. Type J VIC is exceptional in the fact that its decoration, on the basis of complete parallels from other sites, is limited to the neck region. These jugs belong to the Bichrome Ware, which originated in the northern coastal area of Phoenicia (for discussion of this family, see Birmingham 1963: 15-42; Culican 1982: 45-82; Bikai 1978: 37-39, Type 8A; 1987; Anderson 1990: 35-54; Gilboa 1999; Mazar 1996: Part A, Type C.4.b, p. 77). This kind of decoration occurs on a number of additional vessels: Bowls B VIII and Pilgrim Flask PF IB. These jugs come in a variety of body shapes, which are of chronological significance: the body gradually becomes smaller, and the proportions between the height of the neck and the body change. The neck is tall, with a ridge in its center, from which a handle extends to the body; the width of the neck varies between the types. J VIA. Jug/pilgrim flask (Fig. 11.41:1-2) This jug has a wide inflated body and a narrow to medium- width neck. The body is made in the same technique as a pilgrim flask: two hemispherical parts, stuck together in a vertical fashion and topped by the neck (the wheel marks on the interior of the body are vertical). This technique creates a body with an asymmetrical circumference, and the area of attachment is generally flattened. The vessel has one loop handle, generally a double one, extending from the center of the neck to the body. J VIA1. Ridged neck (Fig. 11.41:1; Photo 11.35) A prominent ridge appears in the center of the neck, and the &gt;hoto 11.35. Jug J VIA1 325</page><page sequence="346">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Fig. 11.41.

Most of these jugs have a protrusion at the bottom of the handle (see, for example, Figs. 1.17:8, 1.28:1-2, 1.31:5). One jug bears a decoration of horizontal and diagonal bands on the double handle, and below the protrusion at the bottom of the handle, there is a band with a painted net pattern (Fig. 1.31:5). The rim of this sub-type is thickened and slightly rounded. The neck is everted from the ridge upwards. This sub-type is the most common among the bichrome jugs at Tel Yoqnecam. PARALLELS . Megiddo VIA (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Fig. 10:14,15); Tell Keisan ( Keisan : Pis. 62:6, 62:4-5, par- alleling Sub-type JVIA1, but smaller, this example is red-slipped, bearing a painted white and black diamond design filled with a net pattern); Tell Abu Hawam IV ( Abu Hawam : PI. 17:158); Akhziv Tomb T.C.3 (Mazar 1996: Pl. 2:1); Tyre, Type 8A.b (Bikai 1978: 38, Table 8A:b); XIII/I (Bikai 1978: PI.

Protrusions at the bottom of the handle, characteristic of the Tel Yoqnecam jugs, occur at Megiddo as well (e.g., Megiddo VIA, Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a: Fig. 5:2), yet they are not common in the Land of Israel. They are also known from beyond the boundaries of the Land of Israel, for example at Tyre XIII/I (Bikai 1978: PI. XXXIII:25); Amathus Tomb 310/13 (Bikai 1987: PI. VI:28); Tomb 312/71-2 (Bikai 1987: PI. IV:32); etc.; and Episkopi-Kaloriziki Tomb 7/13 (Bikai 1987: PI. IV:40). Designs filled with a net pattern below the handle are well known, but generally assume a diamond form, such as at Tell Keisan 9a-b ( Keisan : PI. 62:5); and Joya (Chapman 1972: Fig. 3:191). CHRONOLOGY. This sub-type is typical of the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). J VIA2. Stepped neck (Fig. 11.41:2) The bottom part of the vessel's neck is narrow, gradually broadening from the ridge at the center upwards; the upper part is straight. In addition to the bichrome decoration, white paint is evident between the circles. The handle extends from the ridge of the neck to the body, and is decorated with horizontal bands. PARALLELS. Megiddo VIA (. Megiddo II: PI. 80:3); Kouklia (Palaepaphos) Tomb 49/67 (Bikai 1987: PI. 111:43); Amathus Tomb 312/71-73 (Bikai 1987: PI.

One example was found at Tel Yoqnecam, dating from the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). J VIB. Regular jug (Fig. 11.41:3-5) This type is smaller than J VIA and has horizontal wheel marks (unlike those on the jug/pilgrim flask) and a ridge in the center of the neck. J VIB1. Rounded base (Fig. 11.41:3-4; Photos 11.36-37) The base of this sub-type is a continuation of the body contour. This vessel appears to resemble the jug/pilgrim flask, but differs from it in body symmetry, since it was manufactured like a jug and not a pilgrim flask (see above). Photos 11.36-37.

One example was found at Tel Yoqnecam, dating from the beginning of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XVI). This sub-type plays an important role in the chronological development of the J VI jugs: it serves as a transitional type between Sub-types J VIA1 and J VIB2. This transitional type has the rounded base typical of Type J VIA (the jug/pilgrim flask), occurring at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), but is made in the jug tradition, characteristic of the later 327</page><page sequence="348">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Iron IIA jugs (Sub-type J VIB2, see discussion in Zarzecki-Peleg 1997a: 277-280).

CHRONOLOGY. One example was found at Tel Yoqnecam, dating from the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). J VIC. Jug decorated with horizontal bands (Fig. 11.41:6) The few sherds of this type uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam include only the upper part of the jug. This type bears a bichrome decoration consisting of broad horizontal red bands and thin black bands. The jug has an everted triangular rim. On the basis of parallels, this vessel is reconstructed as a relatively small jug with a ridged neck. The handle extends from the ridge to the shoulder, and the vessel has a delicate depressed ring base (a technique characteristic of the rela- tively late jugs of the Phoenician family; see also the Akhziv jugs, Type J VII). This type is rare at Tel Yoqnecam, and the few examples uncovered originate from disturbed contexts. PARALLELS. Taanach IIB ( Taanach : Fig. 58:14); and Amathus Tomb 11/67 (Bikai 1987: Pl. XI: 190).

Summary Among the bichrome vessels, Sub-type J VIA1 is the most common at Tel Yoqnecam. This family first occurs at the end of the Iron Age I, and its typological classification is chron- ologically significant: • J VIA is characteristic of the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). • J VIB is typical of the Iron Age IIA, with Sub-type J VIB1 appearing at the beginning of this period (Stratum XVI), and Sub-type J VIB2 occurring at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). • No J VIC vessel has been found in an undisturbed context at Tel Yoqnecam; thus, it is impossible to determine its date. J VII. RED-SLIPPED AKHZIV JUGS (Fig. 11.42) This type is hardly represented at all in the Tel Yoqnecam assemblages (see below). The vessel has a pinched trefoil rim and a diagonally inverted neck ending with a wide grooved base. On the basis of parallels, the vessel has a globular or piriform body, with a delicate ring base made by a special technique in which the ring is formed as an integral part of the vessel. The handle is attached to the rim. Some of the handles bear appliqués in imitation of metal ware. The vessel is slipped and well burnished. This family originates in the northern coast of Phoenicia, and appears at many sites in northern Israel. For discussion, see Mazar 1996: 71-76, Part A, Type C.3; Bikai 1978: 36-37, Type 7. PARALLELS.

This family is characteristic of the Iron Age IIB at Tel Yoqnecam (Stratum XII), although one ex- ample dating from the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV) has also been found. UNATTRIBUT ABLE RIMS (Fig. 11.43) This typology, based on the rim shape, includes those rims that cannot be attributed with certainty to a specific body shape and therefore cannot be included in the main typology. The rims are relatively wide in diameter, like those of Type J IA and Families J IV and J V, although the parallels suggest that most actually belong to Type J IA. A large number of the rims is included in the rim typology (i ca . 80% of all the jugs uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam). Thus, percentages are given in the rim typology, unlike in the main typology (see discussion above). JR I. SLIGHTLY THICKENED, SIMPLE RIMS (Fig. 11.43:1-2) The rim is upright or slightly inverted, continuing the contour of the neck. This family represents 27% of all the jugs uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. JR IA. Rim with inner depression (Fig. 11.43:1) This rim is at times trefoil. The neck is medium to tall. In shape, this rim resembles that of the SJR IA2 storage jar and of the CPXA cooking pot. This type includes 10% of all the jugs at Tel Yoqnecam. PARALLELS. Taanach IIA ( Taanach : Fig. 22:5); and IIB ( Taanach : Fig. 39:1). CHRONOLOGY. This type occurs throughout the Iron Age, although quantitative differences are evident between the various periods: it occurs infrequently from the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII), becoming very common in the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI-XIV) and reaching its greatest distri- bution at the beginning of this period (Stratum XVI, where it constitutes 23.1% of all the jugs in that stratum). It continues until the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), although with lower frequency (representing less than 10% of all the jugs in that stratum). JR IB. Rim with straight inner wall (Fig. 11.43:2) This rim resembles SJR IB in shape, and constitutes 17% of all the jugs at Tel Yoqnecam. PARALLELS. Tell el-Farcah (N) Vllb ( el-Farcah I: Pl. 48:2). CHRONOLOGY. This type occurs from the beginning of the Iron Age (Stratum XVIII) in relatively small quantities, representing 6.3% of all the jugs in the stratum. Its frequency later increases, and then remains almost constant throughout the Iron Age ( ca . 17% of all the jugs in each stratum), with the exception of the Iron IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), when it is particularly widespread, representing 26.1% of all the jugs in that stratum.

Graph 11.28. Distribution of JR I jug rims in the Iron Age JR II. PROFILED RIMS (Fig. 11.43:3-6) The rim is upright or slightly splayed. There is a clear sepa- ration between rim and neck by means of a line on the lower external part of the rim. At times there is a depression on the rim's inner side. The neck is medium to tall. This family represents approximately half the jugs at Tel Yoqnecam. JR IIA. Rim with rectangular section (Fig. 11.43:3) This type of rim has a narrow section, often with a slight inner depression. A few examples bear a red band decoration on the rim and neck. In some cases there is a degenerate ridge on the neck. This type represents approximately one-quarter of the jugs at Tel Yoqnecam. Such rims occur on JV B jugs at Tel Yoqnecam and on J IA jugs from other sites. PARALLELS.

CHRONOLOGY. This is the most common type during the Iron Age I, from its early stages (Strata XVIII-XVII, where it constitutes 42.5% and 34.6% in each stratum respectively), continuing the Late Bronze Age Canaanite tradition. Al- though it continues to appear throughout the Iron Age, its frequency declines: in the Iron Age IIA and in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XV-XIII) it represents approximately one-quarter of all the jugs in each stratum, and in the Iron Age IIB and the Iron Age III (Strata XII-XI) it declines even further, to ca. 15% of all jugs in each stratum. JR IIB. Protruding triangular rim (Fig. 11.43:4-5) This type of rim sometimes has an inner depression. In some cases there is a degenerate ridge on the neck (e.g., Fig. 330 30 -i 25 - B jR ia] r- □ JR IB m 20 - ■ ídMUí XVIII XVII XVI XV XIV XIII XII XII- XI/XI</page><page sequence="351">JUGS II.43:5).

This type occurs in significant quantities throughout the Iron Age. It is particularly widespread in the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII, where it constitutes 35.8% of all the jugs in the stratum). JR IIC. Ledge rim (Fig. 11.43 :6) The neck of this type is particularly tall, and a ridge or pronounced depression occurs in its center or upper part. In cases in which the handle survived, it extends from the ridge to the body. This type is rare (constituting ca. 3% of all the jugs at Tel Yoqnecam). CHRONOLOGY. This type is characteristic of the Iron Age IIA (Strata XVI and XIV, where it constitutes 5.8% and 7.5% respectively). It occurs from the beginning of the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII), although in low frequency, reaching its greatest distribution in the Iron Age IIA and continuing to occur until the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), albeit in smaller quantities.

SUMMARY In most of the jugs the body did not survive, and in approx- imately 80% of the cases it is difficult to determine the original shape of the body on the basis of the rim alone. Decoration Most of the jugs uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam are not deco- rated. Among the decorated ones, the monochrome or bichrome band decoration characterizes the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII-XVII, with decoration occurring on ca. 35% and 31% of the jugs in these strata respectively). This type of decoration becomes significantly less frequent, and during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV) it occurs on ca. 12% and 10% of the jugs in these strata respectively. From then on it becomes rare. The monochrome band decoration is dominant throughout the periods in question, accounting for between two-thirds to three-quarters of all the jugs decorated with painted bands. The examples appearing in Strata XVIII, XIII and XII/XI are exceptions: in the former the Iron Age bichrome decoration had not yet appeared and in the other two strata the sample is extremely small. Red slip is rare at Tel Yoqnecam, occurring from the end of the Iron Age IIA. During this period (Stratum XIV) the slip is local, at times with an additional black band (see, e.g., Fig. 11.44:2), while during the Iron Age IIB and III (Strata XII/XI-XI), most of the slipped jugs belong to the Akhziv jug family (J VII). The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII A number of different families appear during this period. The most common type is JR IIA (particularly at the begin- ning of the period, when it represents 42.5% of all the jugs). In addition, there are types that continue into the Iron Age II: JRIIB and J IBI, and, with lower frequency, JRIA and B. At the end of the period there is a proliferation of new types, which are characteristic only of that time-span (Stra- tum XVII). Most of these apparently point to links with the northern coastal area, Phoenicia. These new types include: J IIIA-B, J IV, JVA-B and J VIA. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV All the rim types (JR IA-B and JR IIA-B) occur in equal frequency during this period, as well as the J IBI jugs. Type JRIIC, which occurs in smaller quantities than the other types, typifies this period. Bichrome Jug J VIB is especially noteworthy. Despite the fact that it occurs in small quantities, it is apparently chronologically significant: Sub-type J VIB1 occurs at the beginning of the period (Stratum XVI), while Sub-type J VIB2 occurs at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII The rims prevalent in this period, occurring in similar fre- quencies, are: JRIB, JRIIA and J IBI. Type JRIIB also occurs in this period, but in smaller quantities. The Iron Age IIB: Stratum XII The most prevalent rim during this period is Type JR IIB (which constitutes ca. 35.8% of all the jug sherds). Rims belonging to Types JR IB and JR IIA are also common, while Type JR I A occurs in smaller quantities. Type J IB are also common. Noteworthy is Sub-type J IB2, which characterizes this period despite the fact that it occurs in small quantities. The Akhziv jugs (J VII) are also typical of Tel Yoqnecam during this period. The Iron Age III: Strata XII/XI-XI Most of the types occurring at the end of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII) continue into this period, with the exceptions of Types JR IA and J IB2. 332</page><page sequence="353">CHAPTER NINETEEN JUGLETS A total of 45 juglets and juglet fragments were uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam. For their distribution according to strata, see Table II. 1 on p. 235. Their small number makes it impossible to present the finds in terms of percentages. The juglets are divided into three families, on the basis of the vessels' shape and decoration. JT I. DIPPER JUGLETS (Fig. 11.45:1-3) This juglet has a wide neck, and the shoulder is sometimes emphasized. It has a simple or thickened trefoil rim and a handle extending from the rim to the shoulder. It is further divided into three types, JT IA, JT IB and JT IC. JT IA. Sack-shaped body and pointed base (Fig. 11.45:1) The lower part of the body broadens. PARALLELS.

CHRONOLOGY. This type first occurs at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII) and is more frequent in the Iron Age IIA and B (one example in Stratum XVII, three in Stratum XIV and three in Stratum XII). JT IC. Elliptical body (Fig. 11.45:3) The body of the vessel has delicate walls, and the rim is thickened and everted. CHRONOLOGY. Two juglets were found dating from the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII) and one from the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII). JT I. Summary This family of juglets has a clear chronological sub-division: • JT IA occurs mainly in the Iron Age I (Strata XVIII and XVII), and continues to occur, with low frequency, in the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). • JT IB first occurs at the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII) and appears mainly during the Iron Age IIA and B (Strata XIV and XII). • JT IC occurs infrequently throughout the Iron Age. JT II. "BLACK" JUGLETS (Fig. 11.45:4-5) This family has rounded walls, a tall narrow neck and a simple rim. At Tel Yoqnecam it appears with two different bases, one rounded and the other a button base, the former being more common. The handle extends from the rim or the shoulder to the body. The juglet is sometimes burnished and/or red- or brown-slipped. Its name derives from the dark clay from which the vessel is produced and the burnish, which empha- sizes the color. PARALLELS. Megiddo VB (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Fig. 17:17); IVB-VA (Zarzecki-Peleg, forthcoming: Fig. 23:6); Taanach IIB, cultic structure ( Taanach : Fig. 40:4-6); Tel cAmal III (Levy and Edelstein 1972: Fig. 13:16); Rosh Zayit Ha (Rosh Zayit: Figs. 111.80:14, 111.85:11-13); I (Rosh Zayit : Fig. 111.122:21); and Tell el-Faťah (N) Vllb (el-Farcah I: PL 50:10,12,17-32). CHRONOLOGY. This family first occurs during the Iron Age IIA (Strata XV-XIV, with two examples in each stra- tum), and continues until the end of the Iron Age IIB (Stratum XII), with two examples in Stratum XIII and three in Stratum XII. In two of the juglets the juncture of the handle to the body was preserved. In these cases the handle was attached to the center of the neck. These vessels were uncovered in undis- turbed contexts at Tel Yoqnecam, dating from the Iron Age IIA and the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Strata XV and XIII). The juncture was not preserved in the other juglets. The attachment of the handle to the center of the neck is characteristic of the relatively early juglets, attributed to the Iron Age IIA (Amiran 1969: 256). JT III. BLACK-ON-RED JUGLETS (Fig. 11.45:6) The vessel's body is globular, the neck is narrow and ridged, and the rim is diagonally everted. The base is generally straight-cut, but some examples occur with a delicate disc base. The handle extends from below the rim to the shoulder. The juglets belonging to this family are produced from well-levigated clay, densely burnished and decorated with black horizontal bands in groups of thin lines and concentric circles. The handle is generally painted black (for discussion, see Rosh Zayit : 68ff. and references therein). PARALLELS.

The vessel is decorated with red and black bands, and it has a narrow neck, thick at its bottom, flattened and sometimes slightly concave. SUMMARY A small number of juglets and juglet sherds was found at Tel Yoqnecam. In a number of cases, the division into types is chronologically significant (Graph 11.30). The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII Type JT IA is the earliest type of juglet to appear at Tel Yoqnecam since the beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII). At the end of the period (Stratum XVII) the three types of JT I occur. 335</page><page sequence="356">CHAPTER NINETEEN Graph 11.30. Distribution of juglets in the Iron Age The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV The most common family during this period is JT III, which first appears in the course of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XV) and reaches its greatest popularity at the end of the Iron Age IIA (Stratum XIV). JT II juglets also begin to occur in the Iron Age IIA, although these are infrequent. JT I vessels continue to occur together with an increase in the appearance of JT IB at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII The two families that occur during this period (Stratum XIII) are JT II and JT III. The Iron Age IIB: Stratum XII The juglets occurring in this period belong to the JT II family and Type JT IB.

This type is rare at Tel Yoqnecam, with only one pilgrim flask uncovered, dating from the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII). PF I. Summary PF I pilgrim flasks are typical of the Iron Age I, particularly the end of the period (Stratum XVII). They continue to occur, although with lower frequency, in the Iron Age IIA, until Stratum XIV. The decoration is chronologically significant. • PF IA is the most common of the PF I flasks.

SUMMARY Only a few pilgrim flasks were found at Tel Yoqnecam, mostly belonging to the PF I family, generally with a red monochrome decoration (Type PF IA). The Iron Age I: Strata XVIII-XVII PF IA is the general prototype of the pilgrim flasks, preced- ing the other types. It occurs from the beginning of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVIII). The PF I and PF II families are characteristic of the end of the Iron Age I (Stratum XVII), with approximately one-half of all the pilgrim flasks from Tel Yoqnecam occurring in this stratum. A few other types, PF ID and PF II, occur in this period only. The Iron Age IIA: Strata XVI-XIV A number of types, PF IB and PF IC, continue to appear, although with low frequency, in this period. Type PFIB occurs at the beginning of the period (Stratum XVI), while PF IC occurs at the end of the period (Stratum XIV). The Iron Age IIA-B transitional period: Stratum XIII No pilgrim flasks were found at Tel Yoqnecam in the Iron Age IIA-B transitional period (Stratum XIII), with the ex- ception of a few sherds (PF Varia). No pilgrim flasks occur after this period, in the Iron Age IIB or III (Strata XII-XI). 340</page><page sequence="361">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE MISCELLANEOUS VESSELS This group includes a number of vessels which have a certain significance in Tel Yoqnecam's ceramic repertoire, despite the fact that they are very rare at the site.

In contrast to the three cylinder seals, the stamp seals from Tel Yoqnecam exemplify a variety of four types of seal forms common in local glyptic from the twelfth to the seventh century BCE: hemospheroid, conoid, scaraboid and circular shapes (cf. Keel 1995: 95, 100-103). Most of the seals published here are made either of common stones, such as limestone and steatite, or of the man-made sintered quartz substance. The materials of the seals of Tel Yoqnecam and the diversity of forms conveyed by the repertoire of the stamp seals, combined with glyptic themes and styles ren- dered on the seals of the entire group, strongly imply that they were locally made, at times reflecting foreign glyptic traditions. 1. A Mitannian cylinder seal (Fig. III.l [= Fig. 1.37:22]; Photo III.l) L.2266s, Basket 6754 (together with scaraboid seal No. 4), on floor of Stratum XVI (early tenth century BCE); cylinder seal made of sintered quartz; height: 3 cm; diameter: 1.3 cm; wide string hole; Ben-Tor et al. 1987: 5 This Common-Style Mitannian cylinder seal is depicted with the popular theme of a tree flanked by a human figure and a horned animal. Between the human figure and the animal there is a schematic pattern consisting of three vertically aligned pairs of globular dots, connected by slightly curving lines. This pattern serves as the termination of the scene. The typical Mitannian bouquet tree is made of six branches, each terminating with a globular dot. A seventh globular ending, which is vertically aligned with the tear-shaped bulb-like tree stem, surmounts the upper, central tree-top. Two fine short lines cross the tree trunk horizontally. The man, standing to the left of the tree, wears high head gear and a long garment. His left arm is attached to his chest, while his right arm is partially hidden behind his back. The horned animal turns its head back toward the tree, while its body faces the opposite direction. The theme rendered on the seal associates it with Salje's Sub-group 2.1.8 of Common-Style Mitannian cylinder seals (Salje 1990: 46-47, PI. V:90-91), typified by depictions of a bouquet tree, a human figure, a horned animal and a decorative motif. A local workshop for such seals, dated mainly to the thirteenth century, is plausible (M.K. Dabney in James and McGovern 1993: 230; Stein 1997: 82). Indeed, representations of a bouquet tree flanked by a human figure and a horned animal are popular among the local Common-Style Mitannian cylinder seals and are depicted on seals found at Tell el-Hesi, Gezer, Megiddo, Beth Shean and Hazor. These seals, however, differ from the Tel Yoqnecam example in various details: at times there are two horned animals represented beside the tree ( Gezer III: PI. 214:20; Megiddo I: PI. 72:16; Megiddo II: PI. 161:11; Beth Shean I: Fig. 100:3) and on other occasions the human figure is represented seated or kneeling (Bliss 1894: 79, 80, 134; Megiddo I: PI. 72:16; Hazor III-IV: PI. 320:b; M.K. Dabney in James and McGovern 1993: No. 19, PI. 59:i), and not standing, as depicted on the seal of Tel Yoqnecam. Closer parallels to the Tel Yoqnecam seal are another seal from Hazor, a seal from Beth Shemesh and a seal impression from Shiloh, in which, as on the Tel Yoqnecam seal, there is a Photo III.l. Fig. III.l. Mitannian cylinder seal 347</page><page sequence="367">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO standing male figure and one horned animal flanking the tree (Hazor III-IV: 317, PL 320:2; Beth Shemesh II: 107, n. 71; Brandl 1993: 213-215). These specimens differ, however, in a number of other aspects: in the schematic design which marks the termination of the theme, in the number of globular endings on the tree, and in the hand gestures of the human figures. 2. A hemispheroid stamp seal (Fig. III.2 [= Fig. 1.41:23]; Photo III.2) L.2096, Basket 2096/1 , Hellenistic pit, cutting floor of Stratum XIV ; black limestone hemispheroid stamp seal; height: 2.3 cm; base length: 3.5 cm; base width: 2.9 cm, perforated in its upper part at right angle to depiction rendered on base; unpublished The back of the seal is decorated with three incised lines, flanked, at a right angle, by short incisions on one side and a long incision on the other side.1 At the bottom of the hemispherical back there are two incised lines encircling the seal. The representation rendered on the base consists of two horned long-necked quadrupeds, each surmounted by a human-shaped figure. The large crescent-shaped horns iden- tify both animals as bulls. Each of the proportionally small anthropomorphic figures raises the arm close to the animals' necks in a saluting (?) gesture. The positioning of the figures on the back of animals is a well-known ancient Near Eastern motif for representing deities (Wiggermann 1994: 227). The choice of the bulls as mounts for these divinities may hint at their identification as storm deities (Ornan 2001: 2, 14-15, 21-22). However, since the two deities share a strong resemblance, as do the two beasts, it is difficult to determine whether two different storm gods are represented or whether one divinity is represented twice in a symmetrical composi- tion. Representations of two identical themes confronting one another in a symmetrical composition are known on contemporary seals, for example, from Tel Dor and Tell en-Nasbeh, depicting two suckling horned animals (Stern 2000: 128-129, Fig. 70; Shuval 1990: 108, No. 091; cf. Keel-Leu 1991: No. 58). The hemispherical seal was not common among local Late Bronze glyptic finds and its occurrence in Iron Age I contexts is to be connected with the introduction of the larger group of conoid stamp seals in this period (Buchanan and Moorey 1988: 15-16). Hemispheroid or tall hemispheroid seals dated to the late twelfth-eleventh centuries have been found at Tel "Etun, Beth Shean, Tell el-Farcah (S), Gezer, Lachish and Megiddo (Shuval 1990: 101, Nos. 18, 53, 54, 60, 64, 70, 72; Lachish III: PI. 44:100,101; Megiddo II: PI. 163:20). The depiction of two deities standing on animals associates the seal with contemporary local scarabs inspired by Egyptian imagery, in which two deities mounted on animals are represented (Shuval 1990: 99, Nos. 45^8). The theme conveyed on the Photo III. 2. Fig. III.2. Hemispheroid stamp seal Tel Yoqnecam seal differs from the one rendered on the latter examples in the similarity of the two portrayed deities and in the representation's symmetrical composition. Although the shape of this twelfth-eleventh-century seal from Tel Yoqnecam can be considered new in the local glyptic reper- toire, its visual theme is a continuation of earlier represen- tations of deities mounted on beasts. 1 Cf. an unpublished seal from el-Hama (k 1118). 348</page><page sequence="368">STAMP AND CYLINDER SEALS 3. A conoid stamp seal (Fig. III.3 [= Fig. 1.33:11]; Photo III.3) L.2528, Basket 9796, Stratum XVIII-XVIIb?; hard black stone conoid stamp seal; height: 1.8 cm; base diameter: 1.7 cm; perfora- ted; Shuval 1990: 154, No. 71 (no illustration) Photo III. 3. Fig. III. 3. Conoid stamp seal The seal depicts a horned animal and its young. Two debased scorpions appear in front and above the horned animal. The representation is encircled by dots around the outer circum- ference of the base of the seal. The animal's body is oblong, its four legs somewhat incurving and its tail long and rounded. It has a protruding nozzle and small horns. The tail of the young is uplifted and it has two proportionally large horns, which may signify it as a young ibex. The bodies of both quadrupeds are more deeply engraved than their incised legs and tails. The combination of a mature quadruped under which stands its young, usually suckling, is an age-old motif in ancient Near Eastern imagery, which became prevalent on local Iron Age I- II stamp seals in the Land of Israel (Keel 1980; Shuval 1990: 105-110). However, while the suckling kid usually faces the hind part of its mother, the kid on the Tel Yoqnecam seal faces the front of the mature animal; it is thus doubtful whether a suckling scene is being depicted here (cf. Shuval 1990: 106, Nos. 079-081). Nevertheless, even though a suckling scene is questionable, the represen- tation conveys a message of fecundity, as is attested by the inclusion of the scorpion, which in ancient Near Eastern traditions symbolized a female divinity (Seidl 1989: 156-157; Collon 1995: 73-74), and moreover, appears in contemporary seals together with a suckling animal (Shuval 1990: 105, Nos. 67-69; Amiet et al, 1996: 28, Pl. 11:10). The shape, style and theme of the seal identify it as a local product of the twelfth-eleventh centuries BCE. 4. A scaraboid stamp seal (Fig. III.4 [= Fig. 1.37:23]; Photo III.4) L.2266s, Basket 6826 (together with seal No. 1), Stratum XVI; reddish limestone scaraboid seal; height: 0.6 cm; base length: 1.2 cm; base width: 1 cm, perforated at right angle to depiction rendered on base; unpublished Photo III.4. Fig. III.4. Scaraboid stamp seal The depiction engraved on the seal is unclear. Based on the two long curving lines, which may stand for horns, the entire rendering may represent two crossed quadrupeds, perhaps ibexes.2 Similar, although more intelligible and elaborate representations of this theme, rendered on stamp seals, have been found at Tell el-Farcah (N) and Shiloh (Amiet et al. 1996: 27-28, Pl. 11:8,9; Brandl 1993: 216-217; for probable comparison, see Nunn 1999: 133, No. 342). An Iron Age I date may be postulated on the basis of the dating of the latter seals. 5. An Assyrianized cylinder seal (Fig. III.5; Photo III.5) L.2259, Basket 8827, found above fill of Stratum XII wall; cylinder seal made of sintered quartz; height: 2.2 cm; diameter: 0.8 cm, drilled and incised techniques; Ornan 1997: 353, No. 143 2 My thanks are extended to B. Brandl for this interpretation. 349</page><page sequence="369">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO Photo III.5. Fig. III.5. Assyrianized cylinder seal The seal is engraved with a bull facing a stylized tree. Above the bull, which turns to the left, are a winged disc and a moon crescent. The tree consists of a palmate-like tree-top with two small branches flanking its short lower trunk. These two branches emerge from the short ground-line from which the tree grows. Two smaller branches, pointing downwards, are seen below the horizontal line, above which the palmate tree-top is depicted. The bull's right legs, which are far from the viewer, are shorter than its left legs. Its right hind leg appears to emerge from the belly and thus is not parallel to its left hind leg. Typical of bovoids, the beast's long tail is somewhat upturned at its base and then hangs down, termi- nating in a bulb-like tuft. In contrast to the profile rendering of the bull's body and head, its horns are shown frontally. To the right of the tree there are two cuneiform signs, and another cuneiform sign is seen above the bull's back. The theme of a beast, sometimes a bull, approaching a stylized plant is known on Assyrian cylinder seals and in other media of Neo-Assyrian art (Herbordt 1992: 216, PI. 9:5 and bibliography therein; Andrae 1925: Pis. 5-6). It is sometimes combined with a fighting human figure in repre- sentations which probably convey protection of the tree, regarded as sacred in this context (Porada 1948: 73, Nos. 616-620). As is typical of Neo-Assyrian glyptic representa- tions focusing on a stylized tree, a winged disc is usually depicted above it (e.g. Porada 1948: Nos. 640-645). At times the beast appearing at the side of the tree is portrayed as a fantastic creature with wings (Porada 1948: No. 616). A composition including a winged bull and a palmate tree,3 with a winged disc above it, is also found on an Assyrian linear cylinder seal uncovered at Shechem.4 A palmate tree below a winged disc, at the side of which is a crouching winged sphinx, is seen on a linear-style Assyrianized cylin- der seal found at Ashkelon (Ornan 1997: 354, No. 145). The Assyrian or Assyrianized nature of the seal from Tel Yoqnecam is further demonstrated by the three scattered meaningless cuneiform signs, which manifest imitation of inscribed Assyrian or Babylonian seals; this practice is known in Assyrian cylinder seals originating in the western parts of the Assyrian empire (Porada 1948: 79, Nos. 661, 662). Indeed, scattered cuneiform signs are shown on local Assyro-B aby Ionian cylinder seals found at Beth Shean and Megiddo (Beth Shean I: Fig. 117:5; Megiddo , Schumacher: 139, 2, 44:c). These examples suggest a local production for the seal from Tel Yoqnecam as well, corroborated by the sintered quartz of which it is made. The probable affinity of the theme and style represented on the Tel Yoqnecam seal to those seen on a seal impression from Nineveh, dated to 680 BCE, suggests its dating to the seventh century BCE (Herbordt 1992: 214, PI. 9:3; Collon 2001: 99, No. 177). 6.

The serpentine stone of which the seal is made, the linear style and the appearance of the palmate tree strongly attribute the seal to ninth-eighth-century Neo-Assyrian production and not to the Middle Assyrian period, as suggested in the earlier publications. 350</page><page sequence="370">STAMP AND CYLINDER SEALS The seal is rendered with a depiction of a stylized tree, to the left of which is a winged horned animal, turning its head away from the tree. To the right of the tree there is a column-like element surmounted with what seem to be very short branches. Below the round drilled tree-top there are two leaves pointing downwards. Two additional leaves, pointing upwards, are seen on the lower part of the trunk, above a short ground-line from which the tree grows. The frontal legs of the animal are slightly bent forward, as if it is poised to jump. The upper edge of its wing is straight; its lower edge curves where traces of incisions indicate the feathers. The creature's body is elliptical and there are four vertical inci- sions on its side. Its long backward-curving horn, with the ear in its center, identifies the creature as a mature ibex. The rounded shape of the tree-top and its long stem-like trunk associates it with Neo-Baby Ionian cylinder seals, in which elaborate rounded, rosette-like tree-tops are known (Collon 2001: 98-101, esp. No. 179). An elaborate Babylo- nian rosette tree, flanked by two erect winged ibexes, is depicted on a contemporary cylinder seal found at Tel Yincam, in the eastern lower Galilee,5 probably an eighth-seventh-century Neo-Babylonian import. A simple rendering of the Neo-Babylonian rosette tree beside a winged horse is depicted on a local linear cylinder seal found at Beth Shean (Beth Shean I: Fig. 1 17:5). As the rosette tree appears on seal impressions dated to the reign of Sargon II (Delaporte 1920: PL 48:18, S. 566; Collon 2001: 100), the seal from Tel Yoqnecam can be attributed to the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century BCE. The simple version of the rosette tree-top rendered on the Tel Yoqnecam seal hints at local production, inspired by contemporary Assyrio-Babylonian glyptics. 7. A circular stamp seal (Fig. III.7; Photo III.7) L.4536, Basket 8646, non-indicative fill; brownish-gray limestone, flat circular stamp seal; dimensions: 0.5 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm; worked with linear incisions, horizontally perforated; Ben-Tor and Rosenthal 1978: 81, n. 50; Ben-Tor et al. 1987: 6; Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 307-308, Fig. 307 This seal depicts an enthroned male figure, whose head is hardly traceable, facing right toward three pillar-like high stands, each surmounted by a palmate-type plant. The figure raises his right hand while holding its palm open toward the stands, as if saluting. He wears a long garment, decorated from the knees downward with short horizontal lines. The pillar-like stands and the seat are both engraved with short diagonal hatchings. Two horizontal incisions, which serve as a ground-line, are seen below the figure and the stands. The seal's shape, material and style of decoration - involving flat incisions and chip carvings - suggest local manufacture. The enthroned male figure is not shown seated directly on his seat; instead, he appears to be "hovering" above it. This mode of representing a seated figure associates the seal with other rounded limestone stamp seals, dated to the seventh century BCE, in which an enthroned male figure facing right is depicted in a similar manner. This "hovering" enthroned figure, flanked by two cypress-like stylized trees, appears on a seal from Shechem, in which he is identified as a lunar deity. Similar figures, seated within a boat, are depicted on a few non-provenanced seals, some of which are inscribed with Hebrew legends. Since the seated figure on these seals probably represents a divine figure, a similar identification for the figure on the Tel Yoqnecam seal is possible (Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 306-311).

The objects, three anthropomorphic and five zoomorphic, are described in detail, followed by a discus- sion. ANTHROPOMORPHIC IMAGES 1. Lower part of female figurine (Fig. III. 8 [= Fig. 1.37:21]; Photo III.8) L.2506a, Basket 9550/1, found close to floor (Stratum XVI, early tenth century BCE); buff, somewhat brownish clay; surface at back blackened by fire; maximum extant height: ca. 8.5 cm This is a mold-made figurine, flattened at the back, and tapering toward a narrow, now damaged, base. Because of its very thick walls the figurine is unusually heavy. Inside, in the center, there is a small, hollow space. The surface is hand-smoothed. The details of body and decoration are executed in bold incised lines and dots. The contour of the pubic triangle is marked by two lines, each incised upwards, forming an open semi-circle; the excess clay on top of each line was then flattened by a finger and is clearly visible. The short heavy legs are delineated, but not divided, by vertical grooves running down to the base in front; the groove at the back is shorter. The anklets and belt, identical in their design, are incised in front only: each consists of two parallel horizontal lines with dots between them. Except for the dividing groove between the legs, the back has no details of body or jewelry. 2. Disk (Fig. III.9; Photo III.9) L.1543, Basket 4668, fill, late Iron Age; brown clay, levigated, well fired; diameter: ca. 4 cm The disk is flat in front and somewhat convex in the back. It has a raised border ring around its circumference. Two palms are depicted: one - the figurine's right palm - is com- plete with five fingers separately molded, resting on the surface of the disk; the other - the left one - clutches the Photo III. 8.

Disk edge of the disk and is fragmentary; here only four fingers are defined. Both surfaces were smoothed, indicating that the disk was free-standing. It was attached to the body of the figurine only at a small area in the back, parallel to the right palm; when broken off in antiquity, the disk carried with it a small part of the body as well. As the space between the right palm and the edge of the disk is smooth, the arm above the palm must have been detached from the disk. Discussion of fragments Nos. 1 and 2 It is suggested that both fragments were parts of figurines depicting female drummers. Fragment No. 1 represents the lower part of the drummer's body; the disk in fragment No. 2 should be identified as a drum which was held by the drummer.1 However, even though both figurines portrayed drummers engaged in the same action, they should be clas- sified differently: the body fragment is a solid plaque figurine cast in a single open mold; the disk was part of a three-dimensional "bell"-shaped figurine of a female musi- cian. The image in the Tel Yoqnecam plaque figurine adheres to the stylistic convention of her type (such figurines are discussed in detail by Beck 1990: 87-93, 183). Complete or partial nudity is common in these images. As a rule, the woman's right breast is exposed and the drum covers the left breast. The lower body is depicted in two possible ways: female drummers are either completely nude or partly dressed, in short skirts or long wraps. The fact that the woman in our figurine wears only a belt on her belly suggests, therefore, that she must have been nude. The short and rather heavy legs are also a common stylistic feature in this type; originally, they must have been disproportionate in relation to the complete figure. The anklets and the belt, only partially preserved, are also typical. Patterns based on incised dots and zigzag lines confined between horizontal lines are very common in the depiction of jewelry or of textiles. Unusual is the shape of the pubic triangle, which, as mentioned above, is marked here by an incised semi-circle, open on top. It seems, however, that this depar- ture from the accepted convention is a variant of little significance. The depth of the grooves turns this incomplete open shape into a dominant element in the body of the woman, leaving no doubt as to its identity. In all likelihood, even when complete, the figurine could not have been steadied on its narrow base. The features enumerated above are common in solid plaques, which were pressed into open molds so that the obverse carried the detailed relief of the face and the body, while the reverse was flat, hand- or knife-smoothed and devoid of any details. Two unusual features should, however, be noted in our fragment. One is that it is almost, but not completely, solid. Surprisingly, there exists some hollow space in the lower tip of the body. This is most probably due to the method of production: the potter probably rolled the lump of clay in his hands, negligently creating thick, hand-smoothed walls rather than a completely solid body of the figurine. Another unusual feature is the fact that the back is not completely flat, creating an illusion of a three- dimensional body. As only the lower part is preserved, one cannot be completely certain of the original structure of the complete figurine; there is, however, little doubt that this is indeed a plaque figurine. Certainly, a figurine in the round, conforming in its style with plaque figurines, would be very unusual in the repertoire of female drummers of the Iron Age. As mentioned above, the small disk identified as a drum also belonged to a female figurine of a drummer, but a figurine in the round (this type is discussed in detail by Meyers 1987: 1 16-122, PI. 7; for a similar complete figurine, see Ornan 1986: 32-33). Most likely, the woman's head was made separately and attached to the body by means of a peg. The body was bell-shaped and hollow, gradually widening towards the base.2 The drum was positioned in the center, roughly perpendicular to the body. Figurines of drummers have consistently drawn the atten- tion of scholars since the early days of research; emphasis was often laid on the identification of the disk, whether a musical instrument or some other object, as well as on the identity of the woman, whether human or divine. Percussion instruments, played mostly by women in cultic ceremonies and on various other occasions, were popular in the ancient Near East and are attested from the late third millennium 1 I prefer the term "drum" to the often-used term "tambourine" because, unlike the modern tambourine, the drum depicted here - and in ancient representations in general - had no metal jingles attached to its sides. The term "tambourine" may thus be misleading. Ancient drums were most likely made of a round wooden frame - hence their name "frame drums" - and their membrane was made of leather (Braun 2002: 29-31, 118-133). 2 The hollow and "bell"-shaped body, gradually widening, is typical of such local first-millennium figurines of drummers. The figurines differ in these characteristics from the contemporary female "pillar" figurines; the latter are solid and hand-made, with a cylindrical body widening only near the splayed base (Holland 1995: 159-167; Kletter 1996: 29, Appendix 2: 177-233; Gilbert-Peretz 1996: 32-37). 355</page><page sequence="375">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE onwards.3 Individual drummers and ensembles in which drummers participated are depicted on objects made of pottery, bronze and ivory, painted, incised and depicted in relief (Beck 1995: 166; Meyers 1987). Locally, female plaque figurines of the first millennium continue the long Mesopotamian and Near Eastern tradition of plaque figurines, which spread into Canaan in the second millennium BCE. The drummer motif, however, is attested only in the first-millennium repertoire. Stylistically, these plaque figurines are fairly uniform: the posture of the female drummer never varies, only the degree of nudity and orna- mentation. Plaque figurines of drummers must have been quite popular, as they are found in all parts of the country, as well as in Transjordan. Beck, in her paper on the Tell Tra figurine, lists all figurines known at the time (Beck 1990: 92), and more have been found since.4 A torso, recently added to the previously known plaques from Megiddo, is of the Tel Yoqnecam type: it depicts a woman with a drum over her left breast (Sass 2001: 400, Fig. 12.36:1; May 1935: PL XXVII). In contrast to plaques, the three-dimensional "belL'-shaped female figurines appear only in the first millennium. They consistently depict women dressed in long, gently flaring, often painted dresses. Musicians - drummers or double-flute players - are attested in this genre, as well as women holding doves. Thematically, these "bell"-shaped female figurines are no different from the contemporary three-dimensional figurines of women engaged in bread making or bathing; although the two types differ stylistically and technically, they all depict women engaged in their various tasks.5 Such figurines were popular in Phoenician sites along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean; they were found in numerous Punic sites in the Mediterranean basin, reaching Carthage in the West (Bisi 1980: 57-85). They were especially popular in Cyprus, where they are considered an influence from the East (Bisi 1980: 59; Karageorghis 1998: 30-31) and where they developed specific characteristics of construction and style.6 In the Land of Israel, three-dimensional figurines of drummers were found mainly at coastal sites, but also inland, possibly reflecting Phoenician connection and influence. Figurines of drummers were also found in sites in the vicinity of Tel Yoqnecam. Heads of three-dimensional female figurines were unearthed in the excavations of the Oriental Institute at Megiddo, but as the bodies are not preserved it is uncertain whether drummers were among the images (May 1935: Pis. XXIII, XXVII-XXVIII:5418). The plaque figu- rines of drummers from Megiddo, mentioned above, are of special significance in this context, as is a mold of a plaque from Taanach (Lapp 1964: 39-41, Fig. 21). Thus, the finds from Tel Yoqnecam come as no surprise. They clearly indi- cate that both styles of figurines depicting female drummers were "at home" in Iron Age Tel Yoqnecam. 3. Part of anthropomorphic figurine (Fig. III. 10; Photo III. 10) L.1841, Basket 3116, found at intersection of perimeter street and piazza, north-west of Structure III- II (Stratum XII, eighth century BCE); light brown clay with white inclusions, some large, and dark gray core through almost entire thickness; smoothed surface; max- imum present height: ca. 10 cm This is a fragment of a solid hand-made figurine. It is elongated and narrow, but thick, with little modeling. The lower legs, short and heavy, are separated and removed from each other. Some fingerprints can be seen on the inner side of the legs. The right leg is preserved to the bottom, but most of its tip is damaged. A faint horizontal line is incised in front, where the foot would begin, but the foot itself was not modeled. Only a stump remains of the left leg, which was broken off in antiquity. The figure is clad in a long dress, the hem of which is indicated in relief by a horizontal line in front, back and on the left side. In the back, a very shallow swelling marks the contours of the buttocks. Above it, a shallow vertical depression along the center of the back indicates the spine. In front, above the legs, the potter added some clay for the belly, but the surface is badly damaged here and the contour of the figurine cannot be reconstructed. A flat, ledge-like sherd (a handle?) was found near the figurine. It is made of very similar clay and is similarly fired. The break is recent. 3 On Near Eastern drummers, see, e.g., van Buren 1930: 89-91, Pis. XXV: 123,4; Barrelet 1968: 256-261, Pis. XXXIII-XXXVIII; Opificius 1961: 207-208, Nos. 123-125; Winter 1983: 119-121, 261-263, Figs. 61-67, 252, 259-261; Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 164-167. On Cypriote drummers, see Karageorghis 1998: 30. On Palestinian drummers, see, e.g., Pritchard 1943: Type V, 54, 55; May 1935: 30, Pis. XXVII-XXVIII; Bayer 1968: Col. 775; Amiran 1967: 99-100; Hillers 1970: 606-619; Beck 1990: 91; 1995: 162-168; Meyers 1987: 122; Frick 2000: 112-114. When discussing anthropomorphic Transjordanian figurines, Dornemann remarks that "almost all the female figurines belong to the 'tambourine-player' type" (1983: 139; see also Kletter 1996: 31, Appendix 4: 237-145; Daviau 2001). 4 For example, plaque figurines were found on the surface at the village of Gat, east of Hadera (Horowitz 2002: 1, 2) and in Khirbet Nasiba in the Galilee (as yet unpublished, personal communication by E. Eisenberg). A plaque figurine of a drummer, once attached to some other object, and a torso of a pillar figurine were found in Moab (Daviau 2001: 320, Fig. 2; 321, Fig. 4). 5 A varied assemblage of bell -shaped figurines of all types is well exemplified in the tombs of Akhziv (Dayagi-Mendels 2002: 145-151). A figurine of a drummer was found at Shiqmona (Gorali 1977, back cover), at Horvat Qitmit (disks only, Beck 1995: 162-166) and at Horvat cAqav in Zichron Yacakov (head only, Brandl 2000: 188-191). 6 Karageorghis discusses the gender of Cypriote figurines of drummers, tending to define some as male (Karageorghis 1995: 40-43; 1998: 30-33, 68-75). Contemporary Cypriote parallels may be either hand- or wheel-made. Sometimes the upper part of the figurine is hand-made and solid, while the body is wheel made and hollow. Cypriote figurines are often painted or knife-pared; moreover, they are very often "pillar"- and not "belF'-shaped, with a cylindrical body that broadens at the base (e.g. Karageorghis 1995: 41-42, Pis. XIX-XX; 1998: 30-33, 68-75, Pis. XVII-XX; XLV-LV). 356</page><page sequence="376">ANTHROPOMORPHIC AND ZOOMORPHIC FIGURINES AND VESSELS Discussion In its present state of preservation it is impossible to recon- struct the original height, shape, or gender of this anthropo- morphic figurine. However, as the back is modeled, this must have been a three-dimensional figurine. The surviving fragment is of unusual proportions, its elongated, solid body standing in sharp contrast to the short Photo III. 10. legs. Two objects from clear Late Bronze Age contexts provide comparisons to these stylistic features. One is a vessel with a basket handle from the temple at Kamid el-Loz, which has two additional handles in the shape of women holding their breasts ( ca . 11 cm long; Metzger 1993: 34-35, Pis. 15:4, 68). One would expect here representations of completely nude women; however, like in our figurine, both women are clad in long dresses, from which only the tips of the legs protrude. One figure forms an integral part of the jar. The other is only partly attached to the vessel, leaving much of the back free; like in the Tel Yoqnecam figurine, there may be some modeling of the back in this one (Metzger 1993: Pl. 15:4). An unusual feature is the attachment of both figurines to the neck and the rim of the jar by their pulled-back hair. Another stylistic Late Bronze Age parallel is a container (not a figurine) found in tomb 7 at Gezer, shaped to depict a nude woman with similar short legs ( Gezer I: 304-307, Fig. 162; Gezer III: Pis. LXIV-LXVIII). The figurine, with its short footless legs, is somewhat reminiscent of human figures which were often placed in cut-out "windows" and "doors" of Iron Age stands and models. In such figures the proportion between the body and legs are often distorted or the legs are altogether lacking, substituted by a splaying base that merges with the stand (as in the musicians of the "orchestra" in the stand from Ashdod, Dothan 1977: 38-39). Splayed bases appear earlier: a figure from Nippur has a similar, splayed base (van Buren 1930: Pl. 33, p. 31, Fig. 159) and a figure from Tell Chuera (Moortgat 1965: 17-22, Fig. 7; cf. also the male figure in an unusual model shrine, Ornan 1986: 88, 89). A female figure in a long dress and short legs (but with feet) is placed in the door of a sixth-century tower-like model from Cyprus (Caubet 1979: 97, Fig. lb). Fig. III. 10. Part of anthropomorphic figurine 357</page><page sequence="377">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Stands and architectural models have an age-old tradition in ancient Near Eastern art; in the second and first millennia, representations of human figures were frequently added to them, placed in niches or openings, or applied on walls, sculptured in the round or in relief and merging with the structure.7 Such representations were an integral part of Iron Age imagery and iconography. Therefore, despite the fact that none is attested in the small assemblage uncovered to date in the excavations of Tel Yoqnecam, there may have been stands or models of an edifice with human and animal images, like at adjacent Megiddo and Taanach or at Beth Shean. It should be stressed, however, that our fully clad figurine differs significantly from the usual Iron Age I images placed in architectural models, as these were consistently images of nude women.8 Only in much later Punic models are female representations clad, their lower legs - or only their feet - shown (Bisi 1980: Pis. I-VI). Moreover, it seems that, when complete, the Tel Yoqnecam figurine would be somewhat big and heavy for a figurine attached to some other object and there are no signs that the legs were connected. However, if the ledge-like sherd found with the figurine indeed belongs to it, this would lend more plausi- bility to the highly hypothetical possibility that our figurine was originally attached to some other object. ZOOMORPHIC IMAGES Zoomorphic representations were very popular in Iron Age imagery and are frequently found in excavations of occupa- tion levels and tombs. Zoomorphic figurines and vessels were often shaped as bovines, horses, lions, birds, dogs and even more exotic animals, such as giraffes or elephants. Animal figurines were also applied as attachments to vessels and other objects, among them kernoi , architectural models and stands. Horses and bovines were more popular than other animals. Sometimes they were realistically shaped, but often they were no more than schematic figures of quadrupeds that can be identified only by the presence of such diagnostic elements as horns, dewlaps or a characteristic shape of the body or head.9 4. Lion's leg (Fig. III.ll; Photo III.ll) L.1876, Basket 3369, non-indicative fill; brown clay, surface of front of leg smoothed; some red slip and burnish at back; present height: ca. 8.5 cm Photo III.ll. Fig. III.ll. Lion's leg The muscles and toes are realistically sculptured in high clear relief. The base is wide and flat so that the leg can easily be balanced. The break on the top is ancient. The leg was attached to some object by the horizontal ledge, which projects from the back near the top; this too is an ancient break. Discussion This is a fragmentary representation of a lion's leg. It is not surprising that even the small assemblage of figurines from Tel Yoqnecam contains a representation of a lion - the animal par excellence of Near Eastern iconography and imagery. As is well known, animal and human images were often added to other objects in the Iron Age. Nonetheless, the Tel Yoqnecam fragment is rather unusual. It cannot be compared to the long-legged sphinxes of the architectural model from Megiddo (May 1935: 13, 14, Pis. XIII, XIV) or to the lion images in the Taanach stand, where they are an integral part of the object, merging with the walls of the structure 7 Margueron 1976: 206-227; Caubet 1979: 94-118; Qasile I: 87-96; Mazar 1985: 5-18; Beck 1994; 1995: 28-110; 1998: 165-183; de Miroschedji 2001; Yon and Caubet 2001: 143-160. 8 For an eleventh-century pottery plaque with representations of nude women from Tell Qasile and discussion of related objects, see Qasile II: 5-18. 9 Numerous scholars have studied animal representations, e.g., May 1935: 34, Pl. XXXV-XXXVIII; Dornemann 1983: 140-142, Fig. 86; Beck 1995: 125-141; Holland 1995: 159-190; Gilbert-Peretz 1996: 30-84; Tchernov 1996: 85-86; Ben-Shlomo 1999. 358</page><page sequence="378">ANTHROPOMORPHIC AND ZOOMORPHIC FIGURINES AND VESSELS (Dayagi-Mendels 1986: 162). Nor is it similar to represen- tations of animals applied to walls of stands (e.g., Beck 1995: 125-141). The Tel Yoqnecam leg is unusually long, while the others, whether separately modeled and three- dimensional or shaped in relief, are usually of smaller creatures. The smoothed and burnished back surface shows that the Tel Yoqnecam lion leg was free-standing; the ledge-like projection at the back, broken at its end, indicates that it had been attached to some object. It would be futile to speculate whether the section above the upper break was shaped like a head of a sphinx or belonged to that object. It is tentatively suggested that the leg may belong to a stand, similar to an unusual "open-work" cult stand with three high legs and a superimposed cup from Megiddo, which is composed of horizontal and interconnecting vertical coils of clay (Finkelstein, Zimhoni and Kafri 2001: 308). The stand, unearthed in the Tel Aviv University renewed excavations, belongs to Level H-3, which equals Level IVA of the Megiddo Oriental Institute Expedition. Similar in its concept is the stand and cup of unknown provenance from the Israel Museum collections (Ornan 1986: 26-27). It is significant that in the latter the three high legs are shaped to depict female figures. The fact that legs of such stands were sometimes sculptured supports the suggestion that the Tel Yoqnecam lion-shaped leg could have been part of such an object too; the wide flat foot - possibly one of three or four - was certainly an adequate base for such an object. However, as I have found no exact parallel to a stand or a vessel superimposed on similar lion-shaped legs, the sugges- tion remains hypothetical. 5. Perforated head and neck (Fig. III. 12; Photo 111.12) L.4553, Basket 8708/1, non-indicative fill; buff clay with numerous, mostly white, inclusions and wide grey core; present length: ca. 6.5 cm This is a hand-made fragment of a bird's head and neck, which served as a spout. The neck is elongated and curved, gradually merging into the bent head, which is only partially preserved. The eyes are made of applied round pellets. The fragment is rather negligently made and poorly fired. A narrow channel, pierced off-center through the interior, is visible on both ends of the fragment. A few smudges of dark brown paint are preserved on the inner side of the neck. Discussion The narrow off-center channel would not have facilitated a steady flow of liquid. However, if the surface was painted, the blemishes of shape and structure would not be easily apparent. Similar objects, albeit solid, appear in "bird-shaped" bowls, which are known especially from the early phases of Iron Age and are considered cultic equip- ment. At Tell Qasile such bowls were found in eleventh-tenth-century cultic contexts ( Qasile I: 96-100; Dever 2001: 119-134). Solid heads and necks of figurines and similar, but perforated, heads belonging to kernoi were found in a potters' quarter at Ashdod and were probably produced there (Hachlili 1971: 131-135). A long-necked Photo III. 12. Fig. III. 12. Perforated head and neck 359</page><page sequence="379">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE head from the "Philistine house" at Gezer was identified as a "swan's head" ( Gezer IV: 116, 127, PL 119:D). Figurines of long-necked birds from the end of the Iron Age were found at Qitmit (Beck 1995: 142-147, 150-151, esp. 143, Fig. 3.95:157). Beck identified them as ostriches, but re- marked that the identification "may be qualified because of the short legs of the bird". These heads are solid and were not intended to function as spouts. Our bird cannot be identified, as even the beak is missing. In view of the popularity of bird-shaped images in the Iron Age, the presence of the bird-shaped head spout in the small Tel Yoqnecam assemblage is not surprising. However, its fragmentary state precludes a definite attribution: it could have been part of a zoomorphic vessel or, alternatively, an addition to a kernos ring. Its find spot in a "general fill" offers no help towards a more precise chronological defini- tion. 6. Perforated head and neck (Fig. III. 13; Photo III.13) Basket 9840, surface find; light brown and fine clay; smoothed surface; well fired throughout; present height: ca. 3 cm This is a fragment of a spout, consisting of a head and short neck, which widens at its present bottom edge. Two circular breaks on top of the head show that horns/ears were broken off in antiquity. It has a barrel-shaped muzzle. The applied button-shaped eyes are perforated in the center. A well- shaped, wide round channel runs through the center of the head and neck, ending at the mouth. Discussion This is a head spout of an animal-shaped vessel. To judge from the existing fragment, the vessel was carefully made of fine clay: there is even an attempt at some modeling of the surface of the head, and the eyes are pierced. It is impossible to identify the animal with certainty as the head is incomplete, and horns - the most important diagnos- tic element - are missing. If horns had been depicted, this would have been a bull's head; if ears - it might have been a horse, its muzzle barrel-shaped. Indeed, a very similar head unearthed in the excavations at the City of David in Jerusa- lem was identified as a horse (Gilbert-Peretz 1996: Fig. 15:13, Pl. 6:5). Figurines and vessels in the shape of both animals were very popular in the Iron Age. It is of interest that depictions of horses were even more frequent than those of bulls. According to Holland, "the horse takes the dominant place amongst all animal plastic art" (Holland 1995: 167; Rosh Zayit : 80-82), while Dornemann remarks that in Transjordan "all the animal figurines are horses" (Dornemann 1983: 129) and Beck notes that "no horse figurine, nor horse and rider so common in Transjordan, has been identified at Horvat Qitmit" (Beck 1995: 141). In Jerusalem horse figurines are an overwhelming majority, constituting 82% of animal figurines, 174 out of the 211 Photo 111.13. Fig. 111.13. Perforated head and neck animal heads found there (Gilbert-Peretz 1996: 37-38; Tchernov 1996: 85). 7. Body fragment of zoomorphic vessel (Fig. III. 14; Photo III. 14) L.2300, Basket 6380; coarse brown clay, wide gray core, numerous inclusions; present length: ca. 9 cm; inner diameter: ca. 6 cm Photo 111.14.

Body fragment of zoomorphic vessel 360</page><page sequence="380">ANTHROPOMORPHIC AND ZOOMORPHIC FIGURINES AND VESSELS This is a large, hollow cylindrical fragment of the front part of the body and stumps of two legs. The body is wheel-made, like a jug or ajar, and is closed in front by an applied piece of clay. The outer surface was smoothed, while the inner remains rough. A large area of the top surface has been torn off. Two holes were perforated from outside before firing, one on top of the back and the other on the side near the top. Around the top perforation the torn-off surface is cir- cular in contour. There is a vertical raised line between the legs and up to the break. 8. Body fragment of miniature zoomorphic vessel (Fig. III. 15; Photo III. 15) L.28, Basket 120, non-indicative fill; brown, very fine clay, with few inclusions; present length: ca. 5 cm Preserved are fragments of two front legs and part of an elongated cylindrical body, which is hollow and wheel-made like a juglet. The legs were added by hand. There is one perforated hole on top of the body and another on the side, above both legs. Discussion of body fragments Nos. 7 and 8 In vessel No. 7 the raised line between the legs should be identified as a dewlap; thus, the existing fragment can be identified as the front section of a bull-shaped vessel. It is impossible to identify the animal represented in fragment No. 8 as no identifying features were preserved. It was Photo III. 15. clearly a miniature vessel. Indeed, it is made of much finer clay and is carefully shaped, its surface smoothed, while the larger vessel is coarse in its clay and finish and - unlike the miniature vessel - poorly fired. Although the two objects differ in size and quality of production, both were probably used in the same manner. Each vessel has two perforations. The perforation placed at the center of the back served as a filling spout and the vessel originally had a funnel to guide the liquid to the narrow opening; the front perforation was a pouring spout ending at the mouth of the animal. A complete vessel of this type, but without a dewlap, was found at Megiddo (May 1935: PI. XXXVIII:3016; body fragments, May 1935: Pl. XXXV: 4587,1944; Rosh Zayit : 81; see also Ornan 1986: 58-59). Bull-shaped containers were also represented as beasts of burden, carrying two jars or baskets at their sides; those would be filled through the mouths of the jars (e.g., May 1935: PI. XXXV:5043). SUMMARY The figurative assemblage from the Iron Age levels in Tel Yoqnecam, although small and fragmentary, is varied. On the whole, it exemplifies contemporary themes and shapes typ- ical of pottery sculpture, but it also exhibits some unusual forms. Of the three anthropomorphic figurines, two depict drummers; one is a plaque, while two are figurines in the round. A lion, a bird and three bull-shaped vessels (or perhaps two bull- and one horse-shaped vessel) comprise the small zoomorphic corpus. The lion's leg and the third an- thropomorphic figurine belong to well-known genres, but are Fig. III. 15. Body fragment of miniature zoomorphic vessel unusual in shape; I have found no exact comparison to either in the corpus of Iron Age small sculpture in pottery. Six objects find close parallels in objects from nearby Megiddo, possibly reflecting the extent of regional similarity in pottery products and custom. 361</page><page sequence="381">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE BIBLIOGRAPHY Amiran 1967 Amiran, R., A Note on Figurines with "Disks", Eretz-Israel 8: 99-100 (Hebrew) Barnett 1982 Barnett, R.D., Ancient Ivories in the Middle East (Qedem 14), Jerusalem Barrelet 1968 Barrelet, M.-T., Figurines et reliefs en terre cuite de la Mésopotamie antique , Paris Bayer 1968 Bayer, B., Encyclopaedia MiqraHt 5, s.v.

ROMANO* The Brooklyn Museum 1. Faience plaque (Fig. III. 16 [= Fig. 1.32:38]; Photo in. 16) L.2515, Basket 9628, Stratum XVIII, out of its true stratigraphie context; small plaque, ca. 5x5 cm The best parallels for the Bes on this fragment date from the late 18th Dynasty, specifically from Amunhotep III to Tut- ankhamun. Within this range, the plaque should be dated earlier, rather than later. The resemblance between the figure uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam and those on the foot-boards of the beds of both Yuya and Tuya (Cairo CG51109; Quibell 1908: Pls.XXVIII-XXX) and Tutankhamun (Cairo JE 62015; PM 1,2 [1964], p. 576) are particularly striking. One should also consider a Cairo ostrakon (JE 59386A) from el-Amarna (Martin 1974: 75, PL 49, No. 272). The costume has a wider chronological range. The sash begins under Amunhotep III (see a painting fragment from Malkata pub- lished by Smith (1958: 165, Fig. 56). The vertical panels with interior hatching have their closest congeners on the Yuya/Tuya bed. The only thing that prevents a definitive Photo 111.16. Fig. 111.16. Egyptian faience plaque * Sadly, the author passed away during the preparation of this volume. 364</page><page sequence="384">TWO EGYPTIAN FAIENCE OBJECTS dating is the occurrence of both the animated pose and variations of costume on material from Deir el-Medina (painting: Bruyère 1937: 113, illustration; ostraca: Vandier d'Abbadie 1937: 75, Pl. LIV [2360] and 128, Pl. PXXXI [2623]), as well as a marvelous bowl from Nubia (Säve-Söderbergh 1963: 57, Pl. Villa). The dating of these objects is notoriously difficult. On balance, however, a date ca. Amunhotep III seems most reasonable. One would not expect to see the knives projecting from the figure's feet much later than that date, certainly not beyond Tutankhamun. As for whether the piece is Egyptian or Egyptianizing, one should consider the remarkable ivory found by Karageorghis at Kition in 1975 (Karageorghis 1976: 232, Fig. 3), in a level contemporaneous with the Ramesside period. I originally accepted it as the work of a 19th-20th-Dynasty craftsman, but now am more inclined to view it as an 18th-Dynasty heirloom, one made either by an Egyptian living in Cyprus or, more probably, by somebody working in Egypt. The piece from Tel Yoqnecam is certainly closer to the canonical Egyptian Bes than the Kition ivory, supporting its interpre- tation as an Egyptian import. Prof. A. Ben-Tor notes : In addition to the above comments, it may be worthwhile to draw attention to several representations of Bes on ivories found at nearby Megiddo, in Stratum VILA, a context almost contemporary to our find from Tel Yoqnecam (Liebowitz 1987: Figs. 8, 9, 12). 2. Bes fragment (Fig. III. 17 [= Fig. 1.74:2]; Photo III.17) L.1725, Basket 2680, fill, Stratum XIII (Iron Age IIA-B transitional period) This faience figure of the god Bes standing on a lotus capital is probably based on a well-documented series of staff terminals made in and around Tanis in the 22nd Dynasty (Bulté 1991, passim). These Tanis pieces usually show the god holding a much smaller image of the god Bes, either nursing it or offering it a small round cake. Alternatively, they sometimes support a variety of desert antelope such as Photo 111.17. Fig. 111.17. Bes figurine an oryx. Since the upper portion of the Tel Yoqnecam figure is missing, it is impossible to determine whether it belongs to the Tanis group or is merely a local variation. Prof. O. Keel notes: Similar items have been found in Cyprus (e.g., Kition) and in the Egyptian Delta (e.g., Tanis, Saqqara, Zagazig, etc.); cf. Bulté 1991: Pis. 1-9.

The cast splatter and six other copper-based arti- facts were selected for metallurgical analysis. The sample preparation (cutting, mounting and polishing) and the metallography took place in the archaeo-metallurgical labo- ratory at the Kimmel Center for Archaeological Sciences in the Weizmann Institute of Science. Metallography was con- ducted on the unetched and etched polished specimens, with an Olympus PME3 optical inverted metallurgical micro- scope, under incident and polarized light, with magnification of up to 1000 (Photos III. 18-20, 22-24). Chemical analysis was made on a JEOL JXA 8800R electron microprobe (with a detection limit of 0.02Wt%) in the Department of Materi- als, University of Oxford, with the help of C. Salter, using a wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS). THE OBJECTS Chemical analysis Five out of the seven analyzed items were made of bronze (Table IIL2, Samples Nos. 1-4, 7). Of the other two, one was made out of arsenical copper (Table III.2, Sample No. 5) and the other (Table III.2, Sample No. 6) was made of unalloyed copper. The tin percentage varied considerably, from 1.4% to over 11%. Bronze is defined here as copper with more than 1% tin, following Craddock (1980: 171). The knife with the recurved blade (Table III.2, Sample No. 1) contained 11.8% tin, and the unique "miniature rhyton"2 (Table III.2, Sample No. 7, see below, pp. 371-372) con- tained up to 11.3% tin, suggesting a relatively high amount of tin in prestige objects. The copper-based objects Knives A nearly complete bronze knife (Table 111.1:1; Fig. 1.1:18) was found on a floor (L.2325) of Stratum XVIII. It was initially included in Tel Yoqnecam's report of the late periods (Yoqne'am I: 221, No. 14), although found in a clear Iron Age I context. This is an elongated knife (26.5 cm in length) with a re-curved blade and a slightly tapered back, which was originally inserted into a handle made of wood, bone, or ivory. In the back of the knife two rivets are preserved, and a third hole is apparent at the point of the break. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND METALLOGRAPHY (87% Cu, 11.8% Sn; Table III.2, Sample No. 1). Optical microscopy revealed an equiaxed grain structure with inter-granular corrosion (Photo III. 18). The object was ho- mogenized; twinning and slip traces indicate cycles of ther- mal and mechanical treatments, i.e. hammering and anneal- ing with final cold work close to the surface. PARALLELS. Copper-based knives with re-curved blades were found at several other sites in the Land of Israel from the Late Bronze Age II and Iron Age I contexts. Although generally of the same type, each maintains a certain degree of uniqueness; the place of the curve or the way the back is shaped varies, for example. The earliest examples are known from Megiddo Vllb ( Megiddo II: PI. 180:41) and Beth Shean, Level VII, dated to the Late Bronze Age lib. The latter has a re-curved blade but was cast together with the handle, which was recessed for wooden inlay (see Bonn, Moyer and Notis 1993: 206, Fig. 152:1). Knives dated to the early Iron Age were found at Tell el-Farcah ( Beth Pelet I: PI. XXX: 110), Beth Shemesh (Beth Shemesh III: 59, PI. XXX:311), Gezer ( Gezer III: II, 268; III, PI. CXCVIII:3,12) and Tomb 39 at Megiddo (Megiddo Tombs : 165, Fig. 172:4). Another close parallel was found in Stratum III at Tell Abu Hawam (Hamilton 1935: PI. XXXIII, No, 124; Balensi 1985: 68-69).

Worked and annealed microstructure of bronze knife (Table 111.1:1) x200 unetched (a) etched with ammo- nia (b) in his Type O, and asserted that this type is Aegean in origin (Deshayes 1960: I, 320-324; II, 135-137, especially Sub- types Olb, 02a and 03a; see examples in his Pis. XLIII-XLIV: Nos. 2599 from Ialysos, 2607 and 2608 from Psychro, Crete, No. 2598 from Syros, No. 2594 from My- cenae and No. 2595 from Cos). Some of the knives were found in an LH IIIB-C context, others are schematically dated to the end of the second millennium. In Cyprus, a copper-based knife with a re-curved blade and a bone handle was found at Enkomi in an LC IIIA context (Courtois 1984: 26, No. 227, Fig. 8:13). The distribution of knives with re-curved blades extends, however, far beyond the Aegean world. They are common throughout Europe, i.e. Italy (Peroni 1976: Pl. 61, especially "Typ Fontanella nahestehend"), Ukraine (Kobal 2000: PI. 46:B1), Eastern Alps (Řihovsky 1972: No. 130), Poland (Gedl 1984: Pis. 6:43,45,47, 7:54) and Yugoslavia (Deshayes 1960: No. 2610, PL XLIV:16), indicating a strong European tradition for this knife. A single but very close parallel was found in Bogazköy (Boehmer 1972: PI. XV:258). Another fragment of a copper-based knife (Table III. 1 :3) was found in L.3036, Stratum XVII, together with the bronze-cast splatter (Table 111.1:35). This is a tapered fragment with a complete rivet preserved in it, indicating that it broke off the back of a knife. Chisel (Table 111.1:2) Found in L.2359, Stratum XVIII, this chisel is a common type with no handle (Petrie 1917: 19-22). It is square in section and slightly tapers towards a sharp flaring end. A similar chisel was found in recent excavations of Tel Beth Shean, conducted by A. Mazar (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem), in a twelfth-century context (see Yahalom 2002: 27, Cat. No. 43, Local Stratum S3a). Dagger (?) (Table 111.1:4) This is the tip of a double-edged blade, found in L.3032, Stratum XVII, which may have belonged to a dagger. Dou- ble-edged daggers were common in the Land of Israel in the Late Bronze Age and continued into the Iron Age I (see discussion in Bonn, Moyer and Notis 1993: 212-213). Pointed Rod (Table 111.1:5; Fig. 1.18:12) This complete copper-based rod, round in section, pointed at one end and broken at the other, was found in L.3050, Stratum XVII. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND METALLOGRAPHY (93.4% Cu, 5.5% Sn; Table III.2, Sample No. 3). Optical microscopy revealed an equi-axed grain structure (Photo III. 19). Inter-granular corrosion is visible.

Worked and annealed microstructure of pointed rod (Table 111.1:5) x200 unetched Pointed Rod (Table 111.1:6; Fig. 1.31:17) This is a broken metal point too corroded for metallography, although annealing and hammering typical microstructure is partially preserved. It was found in L.3036, Stratum XVII, together with a copper-based knife fragment (Table 111.1:3) and the "cast splatter" (Table 111.1:35). 370</page><page sequence="390">METAL PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION CHEMICAL COMPOSITION (ca. 97.5% Cu, 1.6% As, 0.3% Fe; Table III.2, Sample No. 5). This composition is charac- teristic of earlier periods (i.e., Shalev 1997; 2000) and is uncommon in metal production after the Late Bronze Age I. It thus seems probable that the object had initially origi- nated in an earlier stratum and was kept only for the purpose of re-melting. Rings (Table 111.1:7-8) These are fragments of two very similar copper-based rings, uncovered in L.251 1, Stratum XVII. Both are decorated with coiled metal at the top. A similarly decorated ring is known from a much later context at Megiddo, Stratum II, dated to the seventh century BCE ( Megiddo I: PI. 86:9). A similarly decorated bracelet was found at Aphek in a twelfth-century BCE context (unpublished; Y Gadot: personal communica- tion). Needle (Table 111.1:12) This is unalloyed thin needle, splayed at one end, possibly of the "fisherman's" type. It was found in L.2289, a post-Stratum XVII fill. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND METALLOGRAPHY (ca. 99.1% Cu, 0.2% Fe, 0.2% S; Table III.2, Sample No. 6). Optical microscopy revealed an equiaxed grain structure (Photo III. 20). Twinning and elongated inclusions of copper sulfides indicate a massive reduction in thickness caused by cycles of hammering and annealing. No final cold work is visible. Fhoto 111.20. Worked and annealed microstructure or needle (Table 111.1:12) with elongated copper- sulfide inclusions x 500 etched with ferric chloride Miniature "rhyton" (Table 111.1:16; Fig. III.18; Photo III.21) This complete, hollow conical object has a hole perforated through the tip and a slightly ledged rim. There is plastic decoration immediately below the vessel's rim. It includes a double spiral and an unidentified hand-like object emerging Photo 111.21. Fig. 111.18. Miniature "rhyton" down from it, possibly in an attempt to depict a face. The object was found on a floor (L.2100a) in Stratum XIII. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND METALLOGRAPHY (ca. 77.5% Cu, 7.7% Sn and 14.2% Pb; average of non- homogeneous as-cast microstructure). This object was most probably cast in one piece together with the plastic decora- tion in a lost wax technique (Hurst 1996: 60-83). The surface of the object underwent mechanical treatment visible imme- diately on the as-cast structure (Photo III. 22). This treatment could have included some heating but was definitely not sufficient for the homogenization of the cast. Due to this in-homogeneity of the as-cast microstructure with relatively large quantity of segregated lead, the maximum and mini- mum elemental concentrations are given in Table III.2, Sample No. 7, in addition to the average. PARALLELS. A similar object was found in Stratum III at "Ein Gev, dated to the ninth century BCE (Mazar et al. 1964: 27, Fig. 11:11, Pl. 12e).3 It is slightly smaller than ours (only 7.2 cm in length; 2 cm in diameter) and badly preserved. It has a similar plastic decoration immediately below the rim, different in shape but similar in concept and production technique. ORIGIN OF SHAPE AND DECORATION. Conical vessels with a wide opening at one end and a smaller hole at the opposite end are classified as "rhyta" in the Aegean world (Koehl 1990: 350). 4 In most cases, these have a ledge rim 3 We would like to thank A. Zarzecki-Peleg for pointing out this parallel to us. 4 But see above, n. 2. 371</page><page sequence="391">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE Photo III.22.

The spiral on the bronze "rhyta" may possibly be viewed as continuing this tradition, especially in light of the Aegean origin of this type of vessel. Spatula (Table 111.1:18; Fig. 1.81:33) A complete copper-based rod, slightly bent, round in section, with one end slightly tapered and flattened. The object was found in uncertain stratigraphy. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND METALLOGRAPHY ( ca . 97.3% Cu, 1.4% Sn, 0.4% Fe; Table III.2, Sample No. 4). Optical microscopy revealed an equiaxed grain structure with twinning, indicating cycles of thermal and mechanical treat- ments, i.e. hammering and annealing (Photo 111.23). Photo III.23. Worked and annealed microstructure of a low-tin bronze spatula (Table 111.1:18) x500 etched with ferric chloride and a handle, with the lower opening averaging 5 mm in diameter, which would allow liquid to flow in a thin stream. Our vessel has a ledge rim, but no handle. It is relatively small (the diameter of its lower opening measuring only 2.5 mm), and should thus be regarded as miniature. The spiral decoration on both objects from Tel Yoqnecam and "Ein Gev is reminiscent of spirals which were incorpo- rated in the elaborate ornamentation found on stands in the Cypriote bronze work tradition (Catling 1964: Pis. 27-37). Such stands were manufactured in Cyprus no later than the twelfth century BCE, but were hoarded and possibly pro- duced outside of Cyprus as late as the seventh century BCE (Catling 1984: 88). Evidence exists for this phenomenon in Sardinia and Crete in the sub-Minoan to Late Geometric Period (Papasabbas 2001: 267-269). Additional evidence of this phenomenon is the presence of such stands, whether hoarded or the result of continued manufacture, alongside similar pieces of definite local manufacture (i.e. "offering stands") in clear Iron Age I contexts in Canaan, at sites such as Megiddo (Negbi 1991: 233-235). This continuity of Cypriote bronze-working tradition, along with other ele- ments of "Cypriote" or Aegean affinity in the Iron Age I, is well documented especially in the Jezreel Valley (e.g., Raban Iron knives, sickle blades and a biblical "cow goad"? Iron objects begin to appear at Tel Yoqnecam in Stratum XVII, alongside the bronze industry. The objects presented in Table 111.1:10-11 are iron knife blades with copper-based rivets. A part of a bone or ivory handle is preserved in the latter. These knives were found in Stratum XVII in L.3050 and L.3032 (Fig. 1.28:18), re- spectively. They belong to a group of bi-metallic knives common in the Land of Israel in the eleventh-tenth centuries BCE, but known as early as the twelfth century BCE at Tel Miqne and Tell Qasile (for discussion, Qasile II: 6-8; Dothan 1989). Sherratt (1994), based on the large number of such knives found in twelfth-century BCE Cyprus, suggested that these knives were exported from Cyprus to Israel and the Aegean, are were subsequently imitated there. No scientific method has hitherto been applied in order to determine their place of production. The objects presented in Table 111.1:9 (Fig. 1.28:19) and Table 111.1:13 are sickle blades. No. 9 was found together with one of the bi-metallic knives in L.3032, Stratum XVII; 372</page><page sequence="392">METAL PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION No. 13 was found in L.2293, Stratum XVI. Sickle blades are common in the Land of Israel throughout the Iron Age II sites ( Batash II: 218-220). A single sickle blade may have been found in Stratum III at Beth Shemesh, dating from the later part of the Iron Age I (Waldbaum 1978: 25). Table 111.1:15 is a rod, 30.5 cm long, with a roughly triangular blade at the end. It was found on a floor (L.1744) in Stratum XIV, dated to the tenth century BCE. It resembles a tool from Stratum Ha at the fort of Horvat Rosh Zayit, which is the later occupation phase of the fort dated to the tenth-ninth centuries BCE (Rosh Zayit : 128, Fig. 111.118:10). The excavators, Z. Gal and Y. Alexandre, identified the tool, following Avitsur, as a "shepherd's tool" used by shepherds to prod the cattle and clean mud off their hooves. They further suggested that this was the biblical cow goad men- tioned in Judges 3:31. Two other iron artifacts were found in a bad state of preservation. One is a blade fragment (Table 111.1:14; Fig. 1.53:26), which originated in L.2019, Stratum XV; the other is possibly an arrowhead (Table 111.1:17; Fig. 1.76:25), found together with the bronze "miniature rhyton" in L.2100a, Stratum XIII. THE METAL INDUSTRY Industrial remains were found in Stratum XVII in an area encompassing ca. 15 m2 in the southern part of Area B2 (Squares E-F/31-32), south of the Oil Maker's House, near the southern excavation border and not far from the edge of the tell. The remains of metal production were concentrated on a floor (L.2516), which was partially stone-paved and partially constructed of compact earth. Scant remains of an installation surrounded by ash were uncovered in its western part. The remains included fragments of more than ten tuyères (in addition to dozens of smaller fragments), cruci- bles with adhering metal slag, rim fragments of a furnace or possibly of a pot bellow and casting splatter. Some pottery and highly burnt stones were found in this area as well. The excavators could not ascertain whether the massive burning was related to the metallurgical activities in the area or to the final destruction of the settlement (see Fig. 1.35). A single tuyère fragment (Table 111.1:19; Fig. 1.6:31) was found in Stratum XVIII (Square H/28) on the northern damaged edge of Floor 3037a. However, since these are the only remains of metal production to have been uncovered in this stratum, and since remains of Stratum XVII in Area B2, Square H/28, were found at the same level as those of Stratum XVIII, the tuyère is most likely intrusive. Nonetheless, the possibility that metallurgical activities began in Stratum XVIII should not be disregarded. The tuyères all appear to be of the bent-axis type of blowpipe nozzles (see Table 111.1:19-29 for the larger frag- ments). These were made of coarse clay and are round in section, slightly tapering towards the end. No fragment longer than 15.3 cm was preserved. Two of the fragments (Nos. 20-21) are probably of the same tuyère, thus suggest- ing a possible length of over 30 cm. The maximum inner diameter measured was 2.4 cm, and the minimum inner diameter enabling airflow into the fire was 0.6 cm (note that no complete end was preserved). They were probably made with a mass of clay rolled around a cylindrical rod, the removal of which left a perfectly regular tubular hole for the air stream. These tuyères most likely received the air from bellows at ground level and were bent at the tip to direct the blast of air downwards onto the crucible. Similar tuyères are known from Late Bronze Age levels in the Land of Israel, at Hazor and Tel Zeror, and from Iron Age I sites in the Land of Israel and Transjordan, such as Tel Harashim, Tel Dan, Deir cAlla, Khirbet Raddana, Tell Qasile and Beth Shemesh (for the full list of references, see Ilan 1999: 220-230, Appendix I). Single tuyères were found in recent excavations at Beth Shean, in local Stratum S4, dated to the twelfth century BCE (Yahalom 2002: 43), and at Megiddo VIA (Y. Gadot: personal communication). Notably, the tuyères from Timna differ in shape and method of production (Rothenberg 1990: 35-44), thus emphasizing their role in the primary smelting process, which took place at Timna as opposed to the secondary metallurgy practiced at other sites in the Land of Israel. Two fragments of a crucible (Table 111.1:31-32; Fig. 1.35:1-2) were also found in Locus 2516. The profile of the whole vessel could not be reconstructed on the basis of these fragments. However, the re-curving wall of one of the fragments suggests that these may belong to the type of spouted crucibles known, for example, from Stratum IV at Tel Dan (Biran 1989: Fig. 3). Two rim fragments (Table 111.1:33-34) found in the same locus are 3.1 cm in thickness, nearly twice as thick as all measured crucible rims (e.g., from Qasile, 1.55 cm in average, and Gerisha, 1.65 cm in average) and have no adhering remains of metal slag. They could belong to furnaces or possibly to a pot bellow, like the one reconstructed at Tel Dan (Ilan 1999: 127, PI. 79:4). An unidentified amorphous piece of metal (Table 111.1:35) was found in Locus 3036, north of the Oil Maker's House (see Chapter 3). On the basis of chemical analysis and metallography, it was determined that this was a solidified bronze cast splatter made of copper, alloyed with 2.8% tin (for detailed analysis, see Table III.2, Sample No. 2). Metallography revealed the original as-cast dendritic struc- ture, suggesting that it was probably splattered of a mold during casting (Photo 111.24). 373</page><page sequence="393">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE Photo III.24. Granular and dendritic as-cast structure of metal splatter (Table 111.1:35), etched with ammonia xlOO (a) and ferric chloride x 200 under polarized light (b) CONCLUSIONS The two major components of metal and metallurgy uncov- ered at Tel Yoqnecam are the industrial remains, which were found in a limited area dated only to the Iron Age I, and several metal objects, distributed throughout the entire stratigraphie sequence of the Iron Age. These fragmentary industrial remains bear a close resem- blance to contemporary bronze scrap re-melting local indus- tries (e.g., Dan, see Shalev 1993). Analogy of such small-scale metal industries in Late Bronze Age and early Iron Age Israel with the Cypriote Late Bronze Age urban industry has already been pointed out (Tylecote 1982: 92; Biran 1989: n. 18; Ilan 1999: 130-131). The relatively large number of tuyères and the absence of clear evidence for furnaces indicate that the industrial area must have continued beyond the excavated area. This limited excavated area leaves us with many unresolved questions. The type of fire installation and/or furnace used remains unknown, as does the type of flux and burning material. It would have been interesting to know, for example, whether the oil industry remains were used for burning. Metal scrap in relevant quantities is also missing from the scene, although a small pin of arsenical copper (Table 111.1:6), found north of the Oil Maker's House in L.3036 together with the bronze cast splatter (Table 111.1:35), could attest to the existence of scrap metal for recycling. In this context, it may also be relevant that all copper-based objects from Stratum XVII are frag- mented. Notably, iron objects appear for the first time in Stratum XVII. These are alien to the bronze melting or re-melting industry. It seems that their presence did not replace bronze production, but apparently fulfilled a complementary role. Each of the metals should perhaps be considered independ- ently, possibly employed for different functions (such as iron for agricultural tools and copper for more delicate tools or perhaps cultic artifacts). Among the local metal assemblage, certain foreign tradi- tions may be identified. This is seen in Stratum XVIII in the copper-based knife with the re-curved blade, as well as the bi-metallic knives found in Stratum XVII that were possibly Cypriote imports or their local imitations. The artistic back- ground and possibly cultic connotation of the miniature "rhyton" from Stratum XIII and its parallel from "Ein Gev remain obscure, although they may allude to the continuation of Cypriote traditions, well established and especially noted along the west-east route leading from the coast to the inland northern valleys in the Early Iron Age.

The vast majority of these items were used for pounding and grinding (Amiran 1956), while a few served other purposes. Grinding stones (Figs. III. 19-20) Grinding stones are the most common type of stone object to have been found in the strata under discussion. These include millstones (Fig. 111.19:10-14; Photo III.25), bowls and mortars (Fig. III.20; Photo III.26) and pestles (Fig. 111.19:1-9). Millstones (Fig. 111.19:10-14; Photo III.25) The most common type of object used for the grinding of grains was the millstone. Compared to the basalt bowls and mortars, also used for pounding and grinding (see below), the relatively large surface of the millstones suggests that they were used for greater quantities of produce. These objects, known since the Natufian period, continue to appear throughout the ages with no significant change in their shape (Amiran 1956). Millstones are generally made of crudely worked basalt and occur in pairs of an upper (Fig. 111.19:10-11) and lower stone (Fig. 111.19:12-14). The lower stone, the larger of the two, has an elongated ovoid shape. Its upper side is generally flat, and at times slightly concave. The margins of the lower stone are often higher than its work surface, giving the stone a saddle-like shape ( Gezer III: 35). Of the nine lower grinding stones found in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam, eight are basalt (e.g., Fig. 111.19:12-13) and one is made of limestone (Fig. 111.19:14). None were found intact. The upper grinding stone is also elongated and wide, and is generally smaller than the lower stone. Its lower side is flat, while its upper side is convex, giving it a plano-convex section (Fig. 111.19:10-11). From the 37 upper grinding stones uncovered in the Iron Age and Persian period strata at Tel Yoqnecam it is clear that their shape does not change significantly over this time period. Bowls and Mortars (Fig. III.20; Photo III.26) Stone bowls and mortars were also used for pounding and grinding. The distinction between these two types is essen- tially arbitrary, based on two main criteria: the bowl's depth and the thickness of its base. While stone bowls are shallow and their base is generally as thick as their sides (Fig. 111.20:1-4,6-10), mortars have relatively high sides and their base is thicker than their sides (see, e.g., Fig. 111.20:5,11-12; Photo 111.26). These characteristics suggest that stone bowls, with a larger work surface than mortars, were used for grinding, while mortars were used for pounding. Photo III. 25. Millstones 377</page><page sequence="397">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Fig. III. 19. Pestles (Nos. 1-9) and millstones (Nos. 10-14) A total of 28 stone bowls and mortars were found in Strata XVIII- VIII at Tel Yoqnecam; 26 of these are basalt and two are of limestone (see below). All the bowls are basalt, the inner side of their base flattened by use. It appears that unlike the other grinding objects (upper and lower grinding stones, see above), basalt bowls were used for grinding small amounts of substance, which did not require large work surfaces (such as ochre, Brandl 1993: 254). Despite the fact that only a few basalt bowls were found in undisturbed contexts, it appears that bowls with concave bases were common in the Iron Age I (Fig. 111.20:4,6-7), while bowls with flat bases (Fig. 111.20:1-2) or three-footed bowls (Fig. 111.20:9-10) were more common in the Iron Age II. With the exception of a bowl with bar handles (Fig. 378</page><page sequence="398">MISCELLANEOUS SMALL OBJECTS Fig. III. 19 No. Object Reg.

A basalt bowl with a similar bar handle was uncovered in Stratum V at Hazor. Among the mortars uncovered in the strata under discus- sion at Tel Yoqnecam, those presented in Fig. 111.20:11-12 are exceptional in being made of limestone (Photo III.26). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that deep mortars, made of basalt or limestone, are common from prehistory until the Photo 111.26. Limestone mortar latest periods (Amiran 1956: 47). The mortars found at Tel Michal Strata XIV-VII are outstanding examples of such limestone mortars from similar contexts (i.e. the Iron Age and the Persian period). Pestles (Fig. 111.19:1-9) The classification of the stone objects presented in Fig. 111.19:1-9 as pestles stems mainly from the fact that in general, one side of these items was completely smoothed, the result of their use in grinding and pounding. Thus, these pestles should be considered integral to the stone bowls and mortars (see above), serving the same function as "upper grinding stones" in the latter (cf. the millstones, above). Ca. 45 pestles were uncovered in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam, exhibiting a variety of shapes and sizes. It appears that the elongated, narrow pestles were used for pounding (Fig. 111.19:1-4), while the broader ones were used for grinding (Fig. 111.19:5-9). Other Stone Artifacts (Fig. III.21) The other stone objects found in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam lack a common denominator. The most notewor- thy of these items are the following: 379</page><page sequence="399">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Fig. 111.20.

The decoration consists of four parallel bands lengthwise and an additional decorative element, only partially preserved. The latter appears to be an extended hand, diagonal to these bands (cf. Hazor II: Pis. CVIII, CLXIV:12). Fig. 111.21:5 is a small stone "button" with a rounded, convex base (Photo 111.28). On its upper side there are four straight grooves, intersecting at the center of the object.

They probably served as tiny storage vessels for cosmetics. Fig. 111.21:10-12 are stoppers made of soft chalk (Photo III.30), their lower side rounded, designed to fit the diameter of the vessel they were intended to seal. Parallels to the stone stoppers presented in Fig. 111.21:1 1-12 have been uncovered at various sites, such as Megiddo. The stopper presented in Fig. 111.21:10 is unusual both in shape and dimensions; no close parallel has been found to date. Photo III.29. Alabaster vessels Fig. 111.21:13 is a basalt stone object, angled in section with a rounded perforation in its center. The perforation is biconical in section, suggesting that it was drilled from both sides of the stone. Although similar stones have been un- covered at many other sites, their function has not yet been clarified. Sebanne (1997: 48 and Fig. 24) has recently sug- gested that such objects were weights threaded onto the end of a pointed wooden rod used for ploughing. According to this proposal, these heavy stone rings helped thrust the point of the rod into the ground. Photo III.30. Stone stoppers 381</page><page sequence="401">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Fig. 111.21.

More than 30 loom weights were uncovered at these strata at Tel Yoqnecam, mostly unfired (29-430 gr. in weight; 3-7.5 cm in height; 3.5-9 cm in diameter). Most of the weights are of the "doughnut-shaped" type; the others are conical or biconical in shape (see below). As at other sites, most of the loom weights at Tel Yoqnecam were found grouped together on floors (see, for example, Shamir 1996: 138-139; Beit Mirsim III: 56; La- chish III: 107). Two clusters of loom weights were found in Stratum XII (five in L.1967 and four in L.1944), and another group of 11 loom weights was found in L.2078 (Stratum XI; Fig. 1.94:26). Although no remains of the loom itself were found at Tel Yoqnecam, the discovery of looms at other sites alongside similar loom weights renders the function of the latter certain (Singer-Avitz 1989: 359; see other references therein). Despite the impression of fragility suggested by the material from which these clay balls were made, several experiments have demonstrated that loom weights produced from readily available local clay and sun-dried were not damaged in the course of their use (Sheffer 1981). It should be pointed out that even if some of these weights disinte- grated as a result of use or wear, their method of production and the ready availability of the raw material made them easily replaceable (for a comprehensive discussion, see Shamir 1996 and bibliography therein). As noted above, the doughnut-shaped loom weight is common in the Iron Age (Shamir 1996; Sheffer 1981). In Tel Yoqnecam, this is the predominant type of loom weights, with over 90% of those dated to the Iron Age (Fig. 111.22:2-4; Photo 111.31). Although generally rounded and squat in shape (Fig. 111.22:2,4), at times they are globular (Fig. 111.22:3). They are made of dried clay and only one was fired. In addition to the doughtnut- shaped loom weights, 15 biconical loom weights were uncovered in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam (Fig. 111.22:1; Photo III.32). As mentioned above, 11 were found grouped together on floor L.2078. These are small sun-dried clay balls (36-90 gr. in weight). Another four weights of this type were found, all made of 383</page><page sequence="403">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Photo 111.31. Doughnut-shaped loom weights Photo III.32. Biconical loom weights well-fired clay. Biconical loom weights are particularly widespread in the Persian period (see, e.g., Shamir 1996: 151; Singer-Avitz 1989: Fig. 31.7:23-26). At Tel Yoqnecam, these weights occur in a similar context (L.2078). Because of their relatively small dimensions and weight, similar objects have sometimes been described as spindle whorls (see, e.g., Megiddo I: PL 93:26-53; SS III: Fig. 92a:4). However, the fact that such items are often found in large concentrations (such as in L.2078 at Tel Yoqnecam, for example) supports the possibility that they are in fact loom weights. The occurrence of small loom weights together with large loom weights (Singer-Avitz 1989: 359) suggests that each type fulfilled a specific function in weaving (but compare with Shamir 1996: 143). An additional loom weight (Fig. 111.22:5) completes the repertoire of loom weights from the strata under discussion at Tel Yoqnecam. Although its base and head are missing, its shape can be identified as conical and its sides are rounded. There is a horizontal perforation in its upper part. Similar loom weights are known mainly from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. The finding of this loom weight at Tel Yoqnecam suggests that they continued to be in use during the early stages of the Iron Age, unless this weight was not in situ. 384</page><page sequence="404">MISCELLANEOUS SMALL OBJECTS Fig. 111.22.

The generalized use of the term has been challenged in various publications (e.g., City of David II: 139-140). Some researchers single out a few of these items, particularly those made of bone, suggesting that these served other purposes.1 The fact that such bone items were found at Megiddo in situ , connected to spindles (Megiddo I: PI. 95:38; and see below), supports their interpretation as whorls. If this is the case, the different sizes of the various 1 At times the object's weight is the criterion for determining whether the specific object indeed functioned as a whorl, see, e.g., Gezer III: 72; Petrie et al 1952: 16. 385</page><page sequence="405">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Fig. III.23.

A total of 25 spindle whorls were uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam in Iron Age and Persian period loci (Fig. III.23). They are made of various materials, such as stone, clay (Photo 111.33), or bone (Photo III.34), and range between 2.50-135.50 gr in weight and between 9-22 cm in diameter. No decorated spindle whorls have been found. Typologi- cally, they can be divided into four main categories: Type A: double-convex (made of bone, clay, or basalt; Fig. 111.23:1-4); • Type B: plano-convex (made of bone or clay; Fig. 111.23:5-9); • Type C: disc-shaped (made of potsherd, chalk, or lime- stone; Fig. 111.23:10-13); • Type D: pyramidal (made of steatite or chalk; Fig. 111.23:14-15). Photo III. 34. Bone whorls 387</page><page sequence="407">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Type A: double-convex (Fig. 111.23:1^) Four spindle whorls of this type have been found to date in Strata XVIII-XII at Tel Yoqnecam. Their upper and lower sides are either convex and rounded (see, e.g., Fig. 111.23:4) or else end in a straight line (Fig. 111.23:1-3). They weigh 7.5-25 gr, and are 2.2-3.8 cm in diameter. Two of the four (Fig. 111.23:1-2) are made of clay and were found in Iron Age I strata. Another spindle whorl (Fig. 111.23:3), made of basalt, has a perforation in its center drilled from both sides. It was uncovered on an Iron Age IIB floor. Similar basalt items have been found at other Iron Age sites, including Megiddo Strata V-III and Tell Qiri Stratum IX, although they are also known from earlier contexts (e.g., Megiddo II: PL 171:2,4,7-8). Fig. 111.23:4 is made of bone. Although the vast majority of bone spindles are of Type B (see below), the form of this spindle whorl should not be considered exceptional, since it is a combination of two Type B spindles. This is evident from the in situ find at Megiddo of a spindle with two Type B whorls attached, together forming a double-convex shape (Megiddo I: Pl. 95:38). Type B: plano-convex (Fig. III.23.5-9) Five spindle whorls of this type were found in Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam (2.5-24.20 gr in weight; 2.3-3.6 cm in diameter). All have close parallels from most Iron Age sites. Their presence at nearby Megiddo (Strata IV-III) and Tell Qiri (Stratum XIII) is noteworthy, although similar items have also been uncovered at more distant sites, such as Hazor (Strata VI-V) and Tel Mevorakh (Stratum VII). Fig. 111.23:5 is made of clay, while Fig. 111.23:6-9 are burnished bone spindles. Fig. 111.23:7 is a high plano-convex spindle whorl, found on the floor of one of the casemates (L.1890). Fig. 111.23:8 is a flat plano-convex spindle whorl with a perforation in its center drilled from both sides. Its upper part bears signs of burning, which may be related to the evidence of burning found in L.2288. Fig. 111.23:9 is somewhat unusual in shape, its central part circular and higher than its base. Close parallels were uncovered at neighboring Megiddo Stratum V and Tell Qiri Stratum VII. Type C: disc form (Fig. 111.23:10-13) This type is characterized by its straight sides; its base and upper part are generally flat. Nine Type C items have been found in Strata XVIII-VIII, among which six are clay body sherds. The fact that the raw material from which these objects are made is extremely common accounts for their relatively widespread distribution throughout the different periods (see also Shamir 1996: 149-150, Type B3h). These potsherds, which were adapted for use as whorls, are not uniform in weight or diameter. They are generally rounded, although some are irregular in shape. The perforation is generally in the center of the item, drilled from both sides in order to avoid breakage in the process. The presence of two limestone whorls of this type is noteworthy (see, e.g., Fig. 111.23:13). Similar limestone spindle whorls were found at Megiddo and Tell Qiri, where they are also dated to the Iron Age. Type D: pyramidal (Fig. 111.23:14-15) Seven Type D whorls were uncovered in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam. Six of these are made of steatite (e.g., Fig. 111.23:14) and one of chalk (Fig. 111.23:15). Among the former, only three were uncovered in undisturbed contexts: two of these are dated to the Iron Age, while the third originated from a Persian period locus. Close parallels have been reported from sites such as Megiddo Strata III- II, Hazor Stratum VI and Tel Mevorakh Stratum VII. BEADS, PENDANTS AND AMULETS (Figs. 111.24-25; Photos 111.35-38) A total of 19 beads, amulets and pendants were uncovered in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam. Their relatively small number and the fact that some were found in disturbed contexts make it difficult to draw any clear conclusions. The miniature size of most of these items, as well as their relatively high value compared to other everyday objects, make it imperative to be circumspect even with regard to those uncovered in undisturbed contexts (see, on this issue, Zuckerman 1996: 276, and detailed bibliography therein). Beads (Fig. 111.25:1-14) Most of the beads were uncovered in fills dated to the periods under discussion; only a few were found in stratigraphically reliable contexts. Most are simple, and only four are deco- rated (see below). They are regular in shape, and are similar to beads uncovered in many other sites throughout the country. Made of materials such as carnelian, faience and others, they can be classified into four basic types (Fig. 111.24) on the basis of their general shape. Fig. 111.24.

Beads and pendants Type A: globular beads (Figs. 111.24:1, 111.25:1-4) The height of this round globular bead is approximately the same as its diameter. Four such beads were uncovered at Tel Yoqnecam; one of them is decorated (Fig. 111.25:4). Type B: round squat beads (Figs. 111.24:2, 111.25:5-9; Photo III.36) In contrast to Type A, the height of these beads does not equal the diameter. Five Type B beads were found at Tel Yoqnecam, two of which are decorated (Fig. 111.25:8-9). The basic color of the bead shown in Fig. 111.25:9 is bluish, and it is decorated with an "eye" pattern (Photo III.36). This was achieved by the use of two shades: a white circle, in which an additional, smaller circle was imprinted in blue. The "eyes" are arranged in pairs. Although they generally appear in a four-pair combination, the composition of three pairs with another single "eye" (a total of seven "eyes") is not uncommon. The number seven presumably has some signif- icance. Type C: cylindrical beads (Figs. 111.24:3, 111.25:10-13) This type includes all rounded and elongated beads. A total of four cylindrical beads were found in Strata XVIII-XIII, only one of which is decorated (Fig. 111.25:10). Photo III. 36. Double-eye bead (= Fig. 111.25:9) Type D: polygonal beads (Figs. 111.24:4, 111.25:14) An entire group of angled beads is included in this category. Most are elongated in shape, with an angled section. Fig. 111.25:14 is an octagonal carnelian bead; among its close parallels, beads uncovered at Megiddo Stratum III are note- worthy. Pendants and amulets (Fig. III.25: 15-19) Carnelian pendants with a flat base and a bottle-shaped upper part are represented in Fig. 111.25:16-17. Similar pendants are known mainly from the Late Bronze Age, although they continue to occur during the Iron Age. Close parallels are 390</page><page sequence="410">MISCELLANEOUS SMALL OBJECTS Photo III.37. Faience amulet found in a similar context at nearby Megiddo Strata V-II, where they are termed "lotus seed-vessel pendants". It should, however, be borne in mind that these two pendants could be out of context in the assemblage in which they were found. Alternatively, they may be Late Bronze Age heir- looms. Fig. III.25: 18 is an anthropomorphic faience amulet (Photo III.37). It is broken at the juncture between the head and the body; the head is missing. The amulet's reconstruction is possible on the basis of parallels uncovered at nearby Me- giddo and Tell Qiri. The amulets uncovered at Megiddo are made of faience and occur in assemblages dated to the end of the Late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. A similar faience amulet was uncovered at Tell Qiri, in an assemblage dated to the Iron Age I. In both sites the amulets were identified as representing Ptah-Sokar, and it seems that the amulet from Tel Yoqnecam should also be associated with this deity (see, e.g., Qiri: 86). Even though the amulet under discussion occurs in a relatively late context (Stratum X), it appears that it should be dated to the Iron Age, on the basis of the above-mentioned parallels. Fig. 111.25:19 is an Egyptian-style amulet (Photo III.38; see also Fig. 1.58:10), depicting an wdjat eye (cf. Cahill 1996: 291). It bears signs of fire and lacks any trace of color, although it may originally have been painted. This item was found on a floor dated to the earlier stages of the Iron Age II (Stratum XIV). No similar amulet has been found in a Photo 111.38. wdjat-e ye amulet Late Bronze Age context in the Land of Israel (McGovern 1985); such amulets appear in the Iron Age II, continuing into the Iron Age III (Hermann 1994: 636). The amulet corresponds fully to the typology of Müller- Winkler (1987: 168-171). Close parallels were uncovered at Megiddo Strata V-II, although similar items have also been reported from additional sites (such as Samaria, Lachish and others). For the significance of this type of amulets, see Cahill 1996: 291-297 and select bibliography therein. Although Hermann (1994: 35-37) generally favors an Egyptian origin for this type of amulet, local production should not be ruled out. BONE OBJECTS (Fig. 111.26; Photo III.39) The bone objects uncovered in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam can be classified into five main groups: spindle whorls (Fig. 111.26:1-5); rods (Fig. 111.26:6-8); spatulas (Fig. 111.26:9); needles (Fig. 111.26:10-11); and handles (Fig. 111.26:12; Photo III.39). Spindle whorls (Fig. 111.26:1-5) Five bone spindle whorls were uncovered in Strata XVIII-VIII at Tel Yoqnecam. For their typological sub-division and discussion, see above. Rods (Fig. 111.26:6-8) These bone items are rounded, well smoothed and are similar in diameter. All are grayish-brown in color and undecorated. They were found on two adjacent floors dated to the Iron Age I, a proximity that may suggest their attribution to the same object. Possible parallels were found at sites such as Megiddo, Hazor and others. Spatulas (Fig. 111.26:9) Fig. 111.26:9 is a smoothed bone object, one side flat and the other somewhat convex. Similar worked bones are a common find throughout the ages from the Neolithic period onwards, and are particularly widespread in the Iron Age II (City of David II: 127-134, see there a summary of the various proposals for their use, and references to parallels from sites in the Land of Israel and elsewhere). Needles (Fig. 111.26:10-11) All long narrow bone items with a pointed end are included in this category. Fig. 111.26:11 represents a burnished rounded bone (7.5 cm in length), which gradually becomes narrower and ends in a point. Its stratigraphie origin is uncertain. Fig. 111.26:10 is a small bone needle (3.3 cm in length). One end of this object is wide and perforated, while the other end is narrow and pointed. This object was found on an Iron Age I floor. Close parallels have been found at nearby Megiddo and Tell Qiri. It should be pointed out that similar items have been found in assemblages dated to various periods. 391</page><page sequence="411">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Fig. III.26.

One side is smooth, while the other is carved. The intact end has the form of a rectangle with a "waist" ending with a straight side; a perforated hole is clearly visible in its center. The continuation of the handle is narrower, and is broken at the point where a similar perforation must have been located. Such perforations undoubtedly marked the location of the nails, by which the bone handle would have been attached to the object's body (Photo III.39). This item was one of two identical parts, which were attached to the butt of some metal object (a knife or the like). Although one would expect such objects to be rela- tively common finds, few parallels have been uncovered to date. This may suggest that these were generally made of wood, which therefore did not survive in the archaeological record. Following are the most noteworthy parallels to our Fig. 111.26:12. The two most intact examples are those uncovered at Megiddo and Tell Gemma. A similar item, uncovered at Megiddo Stratum V, was described by the excavators as "bone inlay", but this definition appears to be too general and does not indicate the specific function of the object. Another item, uncovered at Tell Gemma, was described by Petrie as "a bone for one side-piece of a third handle; the two pieces were probably bound by metal bands" ( Gerar : 16). Another parallel was found at Tel Hazor Stratum VIII. Despite the fact that it is less complete than the other parallels, the excavators rightly identified it as a bone handle. Like the handle at Tel Yoqnecam, the Megiddo and Hazor parallels were dated to the Iron Age II. The date of the Tell Gemma handle is not certain, but it occurs between the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age II.

The mean annual amount of precipitation is 600 mm (measured at HaZorea; map ref. 161 227; elevation 75 m) (Meteorological Notes 1967). The native vegetation of Jezreel Valley disappeared long ago, and the present-day landscape is characterized by cultivated and segetal plants. Only remnants of Quercus ithaburensis (Mt. Tabor oak) trees penetrate to the north-western region of Jezreel Valley from the Alonim-Shfaťam district. A few specimens of this tree have survived in the agricultural fields of Beth Shecarim, Ramat Yishai and Kfar Yehoshua. These specimens were left intentionally by farmers as shade trees (Zaharoni 1967). MATERIAL AND METHODS During the excavations of Tel Yoqnecam, numerous charred pieces of wood and carbonized seeds were collected from the Iron Age strata. Samples of 0.5-1 cubic cm were taken from the charred pieces of wood for botanical identification. They were aspi- rated in absolute ethyl alcohol, dipped in methyl-benzoate- celloidin for 24 hours, rinsed in benzene and transferred to 50-55° C paraffin for 72 hours. Blocks were made in paraffin, and 10-12 millimicron thick sections were cut with a microtome. Cross and longitudinal, tangential as well as radial sections were prepared. Identification of the wood up to the species level, based on the three-dimensional structure of the wood, was made from these sections by microscopic examination. Comparison was made with reference sections, prepared from living, systematically identified woody spe- cies, and with anatomical atlases. Identification of seeds was based on their morphology, by comparison with recent identified seeds. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION All in all, 42 wood samples were collected and identified from the Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam (Table III.3). They originated from five tree species: Olea europaea (Olive), Pistacia palaestina (Terebinth), Quercus calliprinos (Ker- mes oak), Quercus ithaburensis (Mt. Tabor oak), and Rhamnus palaestinus (Buckthorn). More than one-third of the wood remains were identified as Olea europaea (36%, 15 out of 42 samples); over 30% of the wood samples were of Pistacia palaestina (31%, 13 out of 42 samples); and about one-quarter were of Quercus calliprinos (24%, 10 out of 42 samples) (Table III.4). These three tree species comprised more than 90% of the wood assemblage of the Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam (90.4%, 38 out of 42 samples) (Table III.5). The dominance of these three tree species in the Iron Age holds true for all other sites investigated in the Jezreel Valley: Tel Megiddo (Liphschitz 2000; 2003), Tel Jezreel (Liphschitz 2000: Table 17.5), Tell Qiri (Liphschitz and Waisel 1987) and Tel Taanach (Liphschitz and Waisel 1980) (Tables III.4-5). Data obtained from pollen analyses, dendroarchaeological research and historical records show that the native arboreal climax vegetation of the Mediterranean territory of the Land of Israel in the period from 8000 BCE to 1500 CE was dominated by Quercus calliprinos-Pistacia palaestina asso- ciation (Liphschitz and Biger 1990). The wild Olea europaea trees were one of the native components of this association before its cultivation, but only in small percentages. After its cultivation by man in the Early Bronze Age (Liphschitz et al. 1991) Olea europaea percentages greatly increased, and olive orchards became very prominent in the Mediter- ranean landscape. The dominance of the native climax association of Quercus calliprinos-Pistacia palaestina and the prominent presence of cultivated Olea europaea orchards in the Jezreel Valley in the Iron Age is already obvious in the Early, Middle and Late Bronze Ages. This is evident from dendro- archaeological research carried out at Tel Qashish (Liphschitz 2000: Table 17.5), Tel Megiddo (Liphschitz 2000; 2003), Tel Taanach (Liphschitz and Waisel 1980) and Tel Yoqne'am (Liphschitz, in Yoqnecam III). Rhamnus palaestinus , like wild Olea europaeaf is also one of the native components of the Quercus calliprinos-Pistacia palaestina dominant association. Quercus ithaburensis , remnants of which still grow in this region today, was present in the area during the Iron Age. These specimens are most probably a secondary invader, which occupied abandoned niches in the agricultural fields or cultivated or settled areas due to the better capability of 395</page><page sequence="415">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN Quercus ithaburensis to withstand competition with Quercus calliprinos in the early stages of establishment. The stability of the macroclimate during the Holocene (Liphschitz 1988) is once again reflected in the results of the present dendroarchaeological research. Numerous Olea europaea (olive) stones and Triticum sp. (wheat) grains were also collected in the Iron Age strata at Tel Yoqnecam (Table III.6). These remnants constitute part of the local diet, and these crops were no doubt raised in the vicinity of the site. Table III. 3.

The deep foundation trenches of the Early Islamic and Crusader periods at Tel Yoqnecam caused much damage to the Persian remains, even more than that caused to the previous Bronze and Iron Age strata. Hardly any complete structures have survived, and the remains uncov- ered are mainly fragmentary walls, floor patches and pits. Throughout the Persian period the site was unfortified. Due to the site's topography - the steep slope towards the north and west - the Persian period settlement - like others throughout the site's history - is terraced. Remnants of the Persian period were detected in all areas of the excavation, but are best preserved in Area A, where three different strata, X, IX and VIII, dated to the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, could be distinguished.

The walls of this level are of a relatively substantial nature, and their construction may be one of the reasons for the poor state of preservation of the remains of the preceding Stratum XI. The dominant feature of the period is the 2 m wide retaining wall, W.208, in Squares E-G/30-31. This is clearly a terrace wall: the area to its south is approximately 2 m higher than the area to its north. Terrace walls of a similar nature and alignment were located here in the preceding Iron Age, as well as in the succeeding Early Islamic period. W.197 (in Square E/30), the westernmost preserved wall of structure L.1971, delimiting L.1934 on the west, is situated on top of the latest Iron Age city wall, using it as a foundation. The settlement was unfortified during the Persian period: no trace of any fortification system was found between the Iron Age II- III (Strata XIV-XII) and the Crusader period (Stratum III). East-west walls of the Persian period (W.103, W.105 and W.210) - the western extremity of which has eroded down the slope - were built immediately above the Iron Age fortifications. Building 1971 The predominant architectural feature of Stratum X is a row of three rooms constructed on the northern side of the terrace wall W.208, using it as a retaining wall. The eastern room (L.1971) is delimited by W.206 in the west, W.208 in the south, W.215 in the east and W.214 in the north. Stones of various sizes pave the floor, on which a rich ceramic assem- blage was found, consisting mainly of bowls and storage jars (Figs. IV. 1-2).

The middle room (L.1953) is delimited by W.205 in the west, the terrace wall, W.208, in the south and W.206 in the east. Very few sherds were found on its packed-earth floor. The western room (L.1934) is delimited by W.197 in the west, W.205 in the east and the terrace wall, W.208, in the south. A good assemblage of Persian period vessels was found on the floor of this room (Fig. IV. 3). Building 2054 This building, with two preserved rooms, is one of the main features of Stratum X. The northern room (L.2054) is de- limited by W.251 in the north and W.1018 in the west (the north-western corner of the room is cut by a Persian pit, L.1564 of Stratum VIII). In the south it is delimited by W.1022 (preserved in Stratum IX), and in the east by the only partially preserved W.1051. The floor of the structure (L.2054, L.1526, L.1566 and L.1568) is made of packed earth, small stones and patches of ash. The largest quantity of ceramic finds was encountered on floor L.2054 (Fig. IV.4). The southern of the two rooms (L. 1567a; Fig. IV.5) is delimited by W.1018 in the west, W.1022 in the north and W.1051 in the east. W.1022, which divides the building into its two rooms, is built of rough fieldstones with several integrated piers of ashlar masonry. This wall survives into the next stratum, where it is numbered W.1044. To the west, between L.2054 and the slope, lies a heavily eroded space, L.1527. This may originally have been the western part of Building 2054. Several storage jars and mortaria found on the floor (Fig. IV.6) point to this struc- ture's contemporaneity with the construction to the imme- diate east. A complete storage jar (Fig. IV.7:1) was found in the open space between L.2054 and the terrace wall, W.208 (L.1952). No floor was discerned here. Fig. IV. 3.

For some reason, the huge terrace wall, W.208, was no longer in use, and fragmentary walls of a structure (or possibly two structures) were built on top of it: W.176, W.191, W.193, W.206, W.1045 and W.1048. The cancellation of the terrace wall was the main reason for our definition of Stratum IX as a stratum in its own right. In this stratum the slope is somewhat more moderate, so that differences in floor levels between north and south are somewhat smaller than before. The level of floor L.1563 in the north (96.97) is 0.74 m lower than the floor of L.1558 to the south (97.71). In Stratum X, when terrace wall W.208 was still in use, there was an approximately 2 m difference in floor levels between the north (L.1953 at 95.38) and the south (L. 1567a at 97.30) in this area. Other fragmentary walls belonging to Stratum IX are W.117 (Square H/29), W.120 (Square G/28) and W.128 (Square H/28). These are located further to the north and down the slope at elevations of 95.00 (L.1772), 94.07 (L.1789), two or even three meters lower than the loci located approximately 15 m to the south (L.1563 and L.1933). A terrace wall should have been located in Squares E-H/29, but no trace of it has been detected. Locus 1558 This is the main structure attributable to Stratum IX. It is, in fact, a continuation of the Stratum X building L. 1567a, with a raising of floors. The floor of L. 1567a (Stratum X) is at an elevation of 97.30, while that of L.1558 (Stratum IX) is at 97.71; and the floor of L.1526 (Stratum X) is at an elevation of 97.23, while that of L.1512 (Stratum IX) is at 97.71. The floors of Stratum IX have thus been raised by an average of 40-50 cm. The room (L.1558) is delimited by W.1044 in the north, W.1043 in the west and W.1017 in the south. The eastern limit of that locus (above W.1051 of Stratum X) has not 409</page><page sequence="427">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT Plan IV. 2. Stratum IX been preserved. The entrance into room L.1558 was gained from the west, between W.1043 and W. 1017. A group of 13 storage jars was found leaning against the northern wall of the room (Figs. IV. 8-9; Photo IV. 1). The floor in the north-eastern corner of the room is covered by a layer of white plaster, while the rest of the floor is tamped earth. To the west of L.1558 lies room L.1512. An assortment of large fragments of storage jars was found on its floor (Fig. IV. 10), suggesting that it served as a storage room, like the adjacent L.1558. The building came to an end in a large conflagration, as is evident by the ash and black marks visible everywhere. No similar signs were discerned in the neighboring struc- tures. However, the large quantity of pottery and other artifacts found everywhere in both Strata IX and X seem to point to a rather sudden end to these settlements. This building's mode of construction is noteworthy: in both Strata X and IX it is built mainly of rough fieldstones with several piers of ashlar masonry integrated into the walls (W.1044 in Stratum IX and W.1051 and W.1022 in Stratum X; for parallels, see Hamilton 1934: 78-79; Mevorakh I: 71-75; Dor IA: 11, 92). While some view this method of construction as aimed at structural reinforcement (Shiloh 1979: 63), others consider it to be motivated by aesthetic considerations (Pritchard 1971: 19-20). This construction method is typical of Phoenician archi- tecture and has been encountered at many contemporary sites. It is quite common, and is known from the beginning of the Iron Age II (Megiddo Strata VA-IVB and IVA and Hazor Stratum VIII; Kempinski and Reich 1992: 303-304), continuing uninterrupted until the Hellenistic period.

Storage jars leaning against wall of room L.1558 (Stratum IX) a large number of sites, including: cAkko Strata IV-II (the late Persian and Hellenistic periods, Akko : 27, 30, 41); Tell Abu Hawam Stratum II (Hamilton 1934: 78-79; 1935: 2-5); Tel Mevorakh Stratum IV ( Mevorakh I: 71-75), where a casemate wall constructed this way encloses a large Persian period structure; Tel Dor Strata VII- III (walls dating from the Iron Age II to the Hellenistic period, Dor IA: 34, 37, 91-102, 111); and finally Jaffa Level II (Jaffa: 656-658). Room 1563 This room was uncovered north of L.1558, on top of the Stratum X terrace wall, W.208 (see above). Three of the walls delimiting this room were preserved: W.193 in the east, W.1045 in the south and W.1048 in the west. The floor, made of patches of earth and small stones, is missing in the eastern part of the room, due to a disturbance by an Early Islamic pit (L.1928). Several Persian period sherds, includ- ing parts of a storage jar, were found on the remains of this floor. Locus 1959 Floor L.1959 (Squares G/30-31), which might have be- longed to a structure delimited by W.191 in the east and W.206 in the west, produced four baskets of Persian period pottery (Fig. IV. 11). Although the southern wall was not preserved, its location may perhaps be determined by the south-eastern corner, which survived in Square G/31. This room is located directly on top of W.208, the Stratum X terrace wall, which did not survive into Stratum IX. Stratum VIII The only features assignable to this stratum are five pits, ca. 0.80-1.00 m in depth, scattered throughout the excavated area. Pits assignable to later strata (mainly to the Islamic and Crusader periods) were also encountered. Only those securely assigned to the Persian period are mentioned below: L.1564 ( Square E/31). - This pit cuts through the 413</page><page sequence="431">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT north-western corner of Stratum X building L.2054 (see above and Plan IV.2).

L.1964 (Square G/30). - This partially stone-lined pit cuts through the Stratum IX stone pavement of L.1959. It con- tained a Persian period mortaria (Fig. IV. 14). L.2117 (Squares F-G/30). - This pit cuts through W.206 of Stratum IX (Plan IV.2). A very small number of body sherds belonging to Persian period vessels were found in it. The stratigraphie attribution of these pits to the Persian period is ascertained by their cutting through walls and floors of Strata X and IX, coupled with the fact that they are superimposed by later walls, such as W.188, W.189, W.192 and W.258, dating from the Early Islamic period (Strata IVb and I Va). Furthermore, these pits contained almost exclu- sively Persian period ceramic assemblages (with the excep- tion of L.1963, which also had some Iron Age pottery). None of these pits can be positively defined as an installation of any sort, and their purpose therefore remains unclear. Pits of a similar nature were found at many other sites, such as Tel Michal Stratum XI, where they were identified by the excavator as storage pits later converted to waste disposal (. Michal : 91). Unlike at Tel Yoqnecam, ashes and bones were found in those pits, mixed with the ceramic finds. Several pits were found in Strata IV, V and VI at Tel Mevorakh, as well as at Tel Dor, but at these sites too, like at Tel Michal, large amounts of pottery, bones and ashes were found in the pits ( Mevorakh I: 26-30; Dor IA: 99, 133, 160, 166).

Over 70% of the complete vessels and sherds are storage jars. This is consistent with the nature of the architecture in the excavated area, which most probably served as the storage area of the city (see Chapter 28). The various families represented in the main loci are presented in brief below, and only the bowls and storage jars are divided into types. Photo IV.2. Pottery vessels from Persian strata Bowls (Fig. IV. 15: 1 - 4) Very few bowls were found. Among these, the most common (Fig. IV. 15: 1-3) are those generally classified as mortaria (Stern 1982: 95-98; Keisan : PI. 31:1-7). Three types are observed, differentiated by their rim profiles. One, with a pronounced outturned rim, somewhat uncommon among the mortaria, finds a close parallel at Tel Dor {Dor IB: 544, Fig. 2.2:13). The small bowl (Fig. IV. 15:4), from an unequivocal Per- sian period locus, is unique at Tel Yoqnecam {Dor IB: 52, Fig. 2.1:3; Stern 1982: 95; Keisan : PL 29:9). Kraters (Fig. IV. 15:5-6) Two types of kraters were found, both necked. One of these (Fig. IV.15:5) has a gutter rim; it has a close parallel at Tel Dor {Dor IB: 56, Fig. 2.3:4). For the other type, with thickened outturned rim (Fig. IV. 15:6), see kraters from Tel Michal C Michal : 120, Fig. 9.2:1; Stern 1982: 100, Type 3). Holemouth jars (Fig. iv.i5:7-8) These vessels closely resemble the late Iron Age types. Similar holemouth jars were uncovered at Tel Dor {Dor IB: Fig. 2.5:2) and Tell Keisan {Keisan: Pl. 21:21:6-7); see also Stern's Type C (Stern 1982: 103). Storage jars (Fig. IV. 16) Four main types and one additional variant can be discerned. Most common are the bag-shaped jars (Fig. IV. 16: 1-2) with a short outturned neck, a simple rim, a sharp shoulder and an oblique body, the lower part of which turns in towards a rounded base {Dor IB: 61, Fig. 2.8:17; see also Stern's Type H5, Stern 1982: 108, Fig. 151). The second type, closely related to the former, has a kind of "waist" (Fig. IV. 16:3-4), while the former has a rather straight drooping body. Similar jars have been noted at Tel Michal {Michal: 131, Fig. 9.10:3; see also Stern's Type F3, Stern 1982: 106, Fig. 144). Only fragments have been found of one variant, closely related to the two types described above (Fig. IV. 16:5-6); thus, the contour of its body cannot be determined. It has an extremely short neck and outturned rim, yet the carination of the shoulder is much sharper than that of the above two types and its body drops down at a right angle {Dor IB: 60, Fig. 2.7:4). Similar jars are known at Tell Keisan {Keisan: Pl. 25:7-8). The type represented in Fig. IV. 16:7 differs from those previously mentioned in the carination of the lower part of its body; it turns in sharply toward the base, which is pointed. Similar jars are known from Dor {Dor IB: 60, Fig. 2.7:2), Tel Michal {Michal: 131, Fig. 9.10:5), cAtlit (Stern 1982: 109, Type H6, Fig. 152) and Shiqmona {Shiqmona: Pl. LI: 106). The other noteworthy type of storage jar (Fig. IV. 16:8-10) differs in nature from the other types: its rim is generally thickened, it has a short to medium neck with a slight ridge at its base, its shoulder is soft and its body globular. Similar jars are known at Tel Dor {Dor IB: 59, Fig. 2.6:1), Tell Keisan {Keisan: Pl. 25:9) and Tel Michal {Michal: 123, Fig. 9.4:6).

However, they seem to belong to a type illustrated by the complete example found in L.1952. Similar jugs are known from Tel Mevorakh (Mevorakh I: Fig. 9:2-3) and Tel Michal ( Michal : 131, Fig. 9.10:1,9); see also Stern's Type H (Stern 1982: Fig. 172). JugletS (Fig. IV. 17:2) The only complete juglet found belongs to Stern's juglet Type 2a (Stern 1982: 119, Fig. 178), with an oval body and flat base. Similar juglets were found at Tel Dor (Dor IB: 65, Fig. 2.11:2-3), Tel Mevorakh (Mevorakh I: Fig. 9:11) and Shiqmona ( Shiqmona : Pis. XXX, XXXIII: 11). Several other fragments of juglets cannot be classified more precisely, due to their state of preservation. The upper part of a juglet, from L.1795, belongs to a somewhat different type, with a squat body and a wide neck ( Mevorakh I: Fig. 9:23; Keisan : PI. 28:11; see also Stern's Type Dl-2, Stern 1982: 124, Fig. 192). Oil lamps (Fig. IV.17:3; Photo IV.3) Several fragments of oil lamps were found, all belonging to the well-known open type, with a large flat base and a flaring Photo IV.3.

Discussion The ceramic assemblages closest to those found at Tel Yoqnecam originate mainly at coastal sites. Among those, the following are noteworthy: Akhziv tombs (Dayagi- 420</page><page sequence="438">POTTERY Mendels 2002: 1 1 1-141), Tell Abu Hawam Stratum II (Ham- ilton 1935: 2-4,14-19), Tel Dor Strata VI-VA {Dor IB: 272-276), cAtlit tombs (Jones 1933: 41-104), Tell Keisan Levels 4-3 ( Keisan : 131-151), Tel Mevorakh Strata IV-VI ( Mevorakh I: 26-45) and Shiqmona (Strata a and b) (i Shiqmona : 9). The vessels are generally made of yellowish-green or reddish clay, typical of the coastal region. Many are crudely made, and the clay is not well levigated. Imported ware (mainly of Greek origin) is conspicuously, scarce, with only small fragments found here and there (Photo IV.4). This is probably due to the public, rather than domestic, nature of the investigated area. As discussed in Chapter 28, the two main Persian period strata discerned at Tel Yoqnecam (Strata X and IX) present a continuous occupational picture. In spite of the change in the general layout of the area (the abolishment of the terrace wall, W.208), the main building of Stratum X (L.2054) continued to be used, albeit with some modifications, in Stratum IX (L.1558). Stratum VIII, however, characterized by pits strewn throughout the previously occupied area, seems to represent either a partial or complete abandonment of the site. Due to the absence of coins and the scarcity of imported (mainly Attic) ware, it is difficult to assign absolute dates to the various Persian period phases at Tel Yoqnecam. A comparative study of the (rather limited) ceramic assem- blages seems to indicate an occupation which began in the late fifth century BCE and continued into the fourth century BCE.1 As described in Chapter 28, the later of the two architectural phases (Stratum IX) was destroyed in a huge conflagration/This apparently violent destruction may per- haps be attributed to the struggle between the Egyptians and Photo IV.4. Sherds of imported Attic and Beoetian ware from Persian strata the Persians over control of the land, and should be dated somewhere around 380 BCE (Stern 1982: 254-255). Fol- lowing this destruction, the site seems to have been deserted for a while (a period represented by the Stratum VIII pits), until its reoccupation in the Hellenistic period (Stratum VII). 1 An ostracon bearing a list of Aramaic names was discovered at the site in the season of 1977. The script is dated to the late fifth and early fourth centuries BCE, see Naveh 1985: 119-120, item 10, PL 20:10. 421</page><page sequence="439">I ® ^ ^ * I ' 21 + Ý + i - i i - i i i i » i » i o §m. 22 4- 4- + 23 4-4-4- 24 _1_ _ļ_</page><page sequence="440">6 [ H ļ ¡ I J f- 4- + + s X r 87.13 f- + + K°p r^- + r^- 84.9 H r H ^ « 8679 í z *)ff Ì ^ 11 82,89 i i i Z8698 f 'M~ I- i 4- i + i i s + Q /&amp; i ? ļ n 86.08 I ™ ļ ļ~^ f^' ' 87.3^kc^ &lt; «g ' ) 1 Ç; 8728~^^QA;^^^r69/ i ) Ļ=z 5 i^ļgj^^Mdroek ~' ^ ' ,fiSOT ť + X</page><page sequence="441">J I K I L I M I ^ ^ ' ' ' ' &lt; r S 4" + 4~ ' L.2508' 84.47, ^ 87 71 BtdLck^ EE ^^2fl^8i76 84 74 J Water System 4- y + + / / IO * s jļ^^Bedrock / ' ffiSOT ■ ')tr^¡g^ -ļ~ ~f- -h 88.35 '</page><page sequence="442">- 4- +- t 25 ^víV/ A 90.31 ^ V A ^ 89.93 ViVūl A i i / ^ B9.59V&gt;(Oä/7^- ~»~ i i / 8960 .v' .tvVl&amp;Hç B9.59V&gt;(Oä/7^- J*^"^YS c ' 8960 .v' Ai- ¿ J*^"^YS c •*" VVH^aO5"^ ' ¿ M.5O'V. / 89.8i sS&gt;Ju'j&gt;C . ,„/V / 89K^Hv^Pv^'4. .
