Overall responsibility for the excavation rested with J. Carington-Smith, Field Director, and H. W. Catling, Director, who also personally supervised the excavation of many individual tombs. Such supervision entailed the control of workmen, keeping the Day Books, planning tombs and their finds in situ, and packing and labelling objects as they were lifted. Tomb descriptions published here were written by J. Carington-Smith, H. W. Catling, W. G. Cavanagh and R. J. Howell, with chronological advice from J. N. Coldstream and E. Moignard. The descriptions were subsequently edited for uniformity by H. W. Catling. Supervisors included the following (* = a prolonged period of supervision,1 = supervision of tombs at Teke,2 = supervision of Fortetsa 1967 tombs): M. Alden; C. J. M. Catling; W. G. Cavanagh*; J. N.

Huxley STUDY AND PUBLICATION During an undertaking on the scale of the North Cemetery excavation, study and publication, it is natural that a very large number of people will have contributed to the different stages of the work. Though the Editors have endeavoured to mention all those who took part, and to whom thanks are both due, and here warmly expressed, it is possible that some participants have been overlooked. If so, the Editors offer their sincere apologies, and their thanks for whatever was contributed. The invitation to the School to investigate the piecemeal discovery of tombs at the Teke site was made by Dr. (now Professor) Stylianos Alexiou, when Ephor of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Herakleion. Dr. Angeliki Lembessis, who succeeded Professor Alexiou as Ephor, invited the School to investigate the University of Crete's Medical Faculty site and, with the administrative staff of the Ephorate, undertook responsibility for paying the work-force, recruited partly from Knossos, partly from the wider pool of the Ephorate 's casual labour force. In the later stages of the excavation Dr. Yannis Tzedakis, in charge of the Ephorate, continued to offer all necessary help. During the subsequent study of material in the Stratigraphie Museum and the Herakleion Museum, Dr. Yannis Sakellarakis, by then Ephor, was always available when assistance was required. During the final stages of study in 1995, the Ephor, Dr. Alexandra Karetsou (who, as Epimeletria in 1978, had closely followed the excavation's progress) was most helpful in allowing us access to finds stored in the Herakleion Museum. In the early stages of the excavation, at Teke, the Niotakis and Koiladi families raised no objection when the School responded to the Ephorate's request to investigate the building plots on their properties. At the Medical Faculty site the University authorities gracefully accepted the need for an excavation in advance of building, and for the inescapable delays thus entailed. Their assistance in the provision of earth-moving plant, and their willingness also to pay for the removal of topsoil from the site, were most important contributions to the success of the excavation. The late Professor Nikolaos Platon most generously released the material he had recovered at the Teke site in 1943, and has contributed an account of the circumstances of discovery; an English translation of his original text is published here.</page><page sequence="9">xii KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY The Managing Committee of the School endorsed the School Director's decision to respond positively to the 1978 request of the Greek authorities. The Chairman, the late Dr. R. A. Higgins, followed the progress of the work closely and supportively. The late Professor J. M. Cook was Visiting Fellow at the time, and much encouraged participants by a special visit to Knossos during the excavation. The Director of the School, H. W. Catling, had overall responsibility to the Greek authorities, and to the Managing Committee for the conduct of the excavation and for arranging the subsequent study. J. N. Coldstream accepted the invitation to play a major role in the study of pottery from the Dark Age tombs and the chief role in the preparation of these volumes. Dr. Jill Carington-Smith held the appointment of Knossos Fellow at the time of the Medical Faculty Site excavation. In that post she undertook direction of the excavation in the field, a responsibility which lasted many months, and entailed long hours of strenuous and exacting work. She had, perforce, to make the best of a constantly changing series of tomb supervisors, and a labour force of limited experience and skill - apart from the Foreman, the late Mr Antonis Zidianakis, and one or two old Knossian hands. Dr. Carington-Smith conducted herself with the greatest skill and energy, and a great debt is owed her for her huge contribution. We pay tribute elsewhere to the memory of David Smyth, the School's Honorary Surveyor, who took a large part in recording the Teke tombs in 1975-76. His great achievement was the site plan of the 1978 excavation, for which he laid down the original grid and kept control of it despite enormous difficulties created by working hand-in-hand with a bulldozer and a JCB. He tied every tomb into the grid, and related the resulting plan to the Knossos Survey, on the Second Edition of which he had recently worked in collaboration with M. S. F. Hood. Subsequently, he prepared the cemetery plan and the plans of the individual tombs published here as figs. 1-55. During the busiest weeks of the 1978 excavation, in May and June, very large quantities of material were recovered every day and brought back to the Stratigraphie Museum for future attention, always excepting precious objects which were transferred straight away to the Herakleion Museum. Reception of material was organised by E. A. Catling, assisted from time to time by M. Alden, L. Cavanagh, C. Mee and C. Rees. The huge task of cleaning hundreds of baskets of broken pottery, as well as a great many complete vases, was the work chiefly of Mrs Eleni Petraki. Her husband, the late Petros Petrakis, Hon. MBE, School vase-mender, undertook the enormous task of reconstructing thousands of vases in the workshop of the Stratigraphie Museum, working with a skill and speed that astonished even those long accustomed to his exceptional qualities. During later seasons, conservation work on metals and faience was undertaken first by V Kelly, later by J. Lee; they were assisted by successive Cataloguers at Knossos, P. Cameron and C. Morris. Many tombs contained very large quantities of broken pottery which had to be spread and sorted to prepare it for the vase-mender and subsequent processing. Among participants in this work were L. Bloementhal; E. A. Catling; H. W. Catling; E Cawsey (Mrs Dick); J. N. Coldstream; S. Huxley; S.Johnson; C. Morris (Mrs Peatfield); A. Peatfield; S. Raven; T. Rombos (Mrs Samaras). Excavation photography at the Teke site was the work of R. J. Howell, M. R. Popham and L. H. Sackett. At the Medical Faculty, site photographs were taken by J. Carington-Smith and H. W. Catling. The major task of object photography during study was shared by H. W. Catling, J. N. Coldstream, E. Moignard, and S. Raven (pottery), H. W. Catling, D. Evely, D.</page><page sequence="10">KI) ITO RS' PR E FACH: xiii Hibler, R. J. Howell, A. Peatficld and S. Raven (other objects); all those named have contributed, to a greater or lesser degree, to Volume IV Negatives made by the above were printed at the School in Athens (S. Raven), at the London University Institute of Archaeology (S. Laidlaw; L. Morgan) and at the Oxford University Institute of Archaeology (R. L. Wilkins). The work of numerous draughtsmen and draughtswomen is represented in the illustrations of Pottery and Other Objects reproduced in Volume III. Original drawings were made by: Mrs Katharine Baker (Orientalizing pottery); Mrs Elizabeth Catling (Subminoan pottery; bronzes; iron objects); Mr Jeff Clarke (the Wild Goat oinochoe, T. 56. 11); Dr. Nicola Coldstream (the greater part of the Protogeometric and Geometric pottery); Miss Emma Faull (Mrs Spring - Subminoan pottery); Miss Zillah Pettit (Mrs Richards - the Wild Goat dinos, T. 34. 18, the Cretan LO dinos, T. 56. 13); Miss Rosemary Robertson (Orientalizing pottery, including the watercolours in the FRONTISPIECES) and Mrs Ann Thomas (Geometric pottery). The final tracings of these drawings for reproduction were made by Miss Susan Bird; Mrs Elizabeth Catling; Miss Emma Faull (Mrs Spring); Mrs Davina Huxley; Mrs Sara Parfitt; Miss Rosemary Robertson and Mrs Diana Wardle. During the many years of study in the Stratigraphie Museum, participants were greatly assisted by the School's Knossos staff, including J. A. MacGillivray, A. A. D. Peatfield and C. F. Macdonald (successive Curators), and P. Cameron and C. Morris (successive Cataloguers). Mrs Cameron undertook the onerous task of entering all this material in the Accessions Registers of the Stratigraphie Museum. She and Dr. MacGillivray facilitated the systematic transfer of many tomb groups from the Stratigraphie Museum to the Herakleion Museum during the early 1980's, at the direction of the Ephor, Dr. Yannis Sakellarakis. Many authors have contributed to these volumes. It has been explained supra that J. Carington-Smith, W. G. Cavanagh, H. W. Catling and R. J. Howell between them drafted nearly all the tomb descriptions. The catalogue entries accompanying the description of each tomb were written by the individual specialists responsible for the corresponding analytical sections in Volume II, as follows: Subminoan Pottery - H. W. Catling; Other Subminoan Objects - H. W. Catling; Protogeometric and Geometric Pottery - J. N. Coldstream; Orientalizing Pottery - E. Moignard; Iron - A. M. Snodgrass; Bronze - H. W. Catling; Jewellery - |R. A. Higgins; Faience, Egyptian Blue and Glass - V Webb; Terracottas - |R. A. Higgins; Other Materials - R. D. G. Evely. In addition, the tomb descriptions draw on information provided by R. D. G. Evely (Other Materials), J. Cocking (Textile remains), J. H. Musgrave (Human remains) and S. Wall-Crowther (Animal remains), while the Catalogue includes information from D. Liddy's chemical analysis of pottery. Dr. R. E. Jones, former Director of the Fitch Laboratory, kindly revised Dr. Liddy's report before publication. Valuable advice on a Minoan seal was received from Dr. J. Betts and Dr. I. Pini. Mention has already been made of the substantial financial contributions made during the excavation by the Ephoria of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, Herakleion (workmen's wages and I. K. A insurance) and the University of Crete (earth-moving equipment and spoil disposal). The British School at Athens contributed in many ways, not least in the emoluments of the officers who participated in different aspects of the work (Director, Assistant Director, Director of the Fitch Laboratory, Knossos Fellow, Curators at Knossos, Fitch Laboratory Fellow, Cataloguers at Knossos). The School also provided accommodation and maintenance for excavation supervisors, and generous support subsequently during the Knossos study seasons. The Managing Committee more recently approved a generous grant to meet the expenses incurred in the final stages of the preparation of this report for the press. The British</page><page sequence="11">xiv KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Academy in 1980, 1981 and 1982 made grants to J. N. Coldstream and E. Moignard for study seasons at Knossos. The entire text of these volumes has been committed to disc by V Batten and L. Steel, with assistance from N. Wardle. We thank them for their strenuous efforts towards this publication. * # # # * We distinguish the tombs thus: for the Teke plots, the letters A-Qj for the University site, simple arabic numerals 1- 310; for the Fortetsa tombs, F/67 followed by arabic numbers 1- 15. In the catalogues, the finds are numbered in the order in which they came out of the earth, and are marked with the numbers assigned to them by the excavators. In any but the least disturbed tombs it is hardly surprising that different parts of the same object will have acquired two or more different numbers; hence the frequent occurrence of vacat against many entries in the catalogues, under which reference may be made to the heading under which the reunited object is described. For most tombs, the catalogues will outrun the numbering of objects observed during the excavation; the additional finds were later mended from disiecta membra within the tomb. The catalogues also include finds of later periods, infiltrating especially from Hellenistic or Roman burials; these are mentioned, but without description. Their full study is reserved for a later publication. We refer to each individual find, in discussion, by its tomb number (or, for Teke, letter) followed by a simple arabic numeral for pottery, a number preceded by f for a small find. Within the entry for each tomb in Part I, especially in the description of the tomb, the tomb number or letter may be omitted. In the tomb descriptions, all measurements are given in metres; in the catalogues, in centimetres. For each entry in the catalogue for small finds, individual references to FIGS, and PLATES will be given. Entries for pottery vessels illustrated by drawings will likewise bear their own FIG. references; but since the photographs are arranged in the same order as the tombs (PLATES 45-262), we give general PLATE references at the head of each pottery catalogue, and individual reference to PLATES only where the photograph occurs on a page well out of numerical order. An asterisk against a vessel indicates that no photograph is included. Since pottery supplies the chronological foundation for the dating of the other objects and for the history of the tombs, a phase in J. K. Brock's system is suggested with each catalogue entry. Where ascription to a single phase is not possible, we make a distinction between a hyphen and an oblique: thus LG-EO denotes a vessel which could belong to either period, but LG/EO refers to a brief transitional phase between the two periods (see GGP 245-6, 330). In our references to comparative material we do not include any publication appearing after 1994, other than articles written by the contributors themselves. When more than a dozen scholars analyse and interpret the tombs and finds of a very large cemetery, it is inevitable that they will form very different conclusions on the various questions which may arise. We have no wish to project any 'orthodox' approach to such questions; instead, we attempt through editorial footnotes to alert the reader to any alternative views expressed in other chapters. We dedicate these volumes to honour the memory of two men who, in different ways, have laid the foundations for this work on the North Cemetery. We have all appreciated, with enhanced respect, the masterly achievement of James Brock, the first scholar to chart a reliable course through the terra incognita of the Knossian Early Iron</page><page sequence="12">EDITORS' PREFACE xv Age. His chronological sequence has stood the test of time; and, for all of us, his Fortetsa has been an indispensable source of enlightenment on every kind of material from the North Cemetery. We also remember with profound gratitude and admiration the sterling work of David Smyth, for many years the British School's Honorary Surveyor. Throughout the excavation of the Teke and Medical Faculty sites he was our architect, and is thus one of the major contributors to this report. As well as making the site survey, on which all excavated features are recorded, including the tombs reported here, he made field drawings of the plans and sections of many of the tombs, often under harassing conditions, taking endless trouble, even in the most abundantly rich tombs, to mark even the smallest object in its correct position. Later, he prepared the finished drawings of all the tombs published here. H. W. C. J. N.

The rest of his land (apart from that on which he built the Villa Ariadne and laid out its gardens) had great amenity value within the milieu which he thus created for himself and his colleagues. During his lifetime, he transferred the ownership of the whole of this estate to the British School at Athens to provide a permanent centre for the continuation of his work at Knossos and land in the middle of the Knossos archaeological area sufficient for excavation for a very long time to come. Sir Arthur's calculations could take no account of the Second World War, and the economic difficulties by which it was followed. The end of the war found the Villa Ariadne in need of costly care and maintenance work, while the land had to be taken in hand. The School's Managing Committee faced similar anxieties at the School, in Athens. This was in the period before Sir Mortimer Wheeler, as Secretary of the British Academy, had persuaded Government to place the finances of all the British Schools and Institutes overseas on a far sounder footing. The School accordingly invited the Greek State to accept ownership of the Villa Ariadne and the land that had formed the Evans' Estate. Ownership was duly transferred after detailed negotiations, and the School's financial responsibilities were considerably eased. At the time of the transfer, it was agreed between the Greek authorities and the School that, in consideration of the gift, the School should in future be consulted by the Herakleion Ephoria concerning chance discoveries or impending rescue excavations in the Knossos Archaeological area, a fairly extensive zone, the precise boundaries of which were rather loosely defined. And so it was that for many years after the transfer of the Evans Estate that the School, at the request of the Ephoria, would excavate and publish rescue sites in the Knossos area. This understanding was still in force in 1978 when a decision was reached by the Greek authorities to build a substantial part of the new University of Crete in an olive grove one kilometre north-north west of the Minoan palace, east of the main Herakleion-Knossos road, and north of the Venizeleion Hospital. Previous archaeological discoveries in the area1 strongly suggested that this olive grove must contain buried ancient remains. This belief was only strengthened by discoveries made earlier, to the North of the threatened site, where in 1939-40 R. W. Hutchinson had excavated the Khaniale Teke tholos, and other tombs.2 Much more recently, the School had excavated, piecemeal, a series of Dark Age chamber tombs in the Niotakis and Koiladhi plots which building activities brought to light in the bank beyond 1 MSF Hood, KS', grid squares G4, G5. a Hutchinson and Boardman, BSA 49 (1954), 215-22; Boardman, BSA 62 (1967), 57-75. KS*, Site 46.</page><page sequence="20">2 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY the north fringe of the University site, as it was first called.3 A tomb had been found here in 1943 by the occupying forces, and had been rescued by Dr. Nikolaos Platon, at that time Ephor of Herakleion.4 These tombs, which came to be known as the Teke tombs, are included in this report, designated by letters of the alphabet. Among those who took part in their excavation are R. Howell, M. R. Popham and L. H. Sackett. Several of them were planned by D. Smyth, the School's Honorary Surveyor, who was to play so major a role in the main excavation on the University site - the North Cemetery, as it will hereafter be described. H. W. C. The road from Knossos to Herakleion, after passing the Venizeleion Hospital, descends a steep slope at the base of which one road leads w to the hamlet of Teke and another E to a number of suburban houses. Building in 1975 and 1976 on the hill slope on the S side of the latter road uncovered remains of fourteen chamber tombs of the PG, G and O periods. As these were uncovered, the British School at Athens was invited by Dr. S. Alexiou, Ephor of Central Crete and Keeper of the Herakleion Museum, to investigate. In 1975, M. R. Popham and L. H. Sackett excavated Ts. A, B, D, E and F on the A. Koiladhi plot. In 1976, R. J. Howell, assisted by D. Smyth, excavated Ts. G, H, J, K, L, M, N and O on the adjacent M. Niotakis plot, in the angle between the main and the secondary roads. T. G was already known since it had been discovered during construction of a bunker by occupying soldiers in World War II. Nikolaos Platon (later Professor Platon) on behalf of the Herakleion Ephoria, rescued most of the material from the tomb at that time. During the present excavations it became clear that the bunker had cut partly through another tomb, T. N, and that some material from this had been included in that recovered by N. Platon. (A small segment of the same tomb lay in the Koiladhi plot, and had been excavated as T. C by L. H. Sackett in 1975). In 1976 only a short part of the dromos of T O could be excavated since the remainder of the tomb was in the S. Koiladhi plot, to the S. Excavation was completed by J. Carington-Smith in 1980. T. Qwas excavated by R. J. Howell in 1976 in the A. Koiladhi plot, immediately S of the Koiladhi house. A primary school still stood on the site during N. Platon's excavation in 1943. The entrance to the bunker was still apparent before the mechanical excavator began work. It penetrated the hillside at right angles to the secondary road, close to the boundary with the Koiladhi property. After cutting through the dromos of T. N, the tunnel turned at right angles to cut through the chamber of T. N and then parts of the chamber and dromos of T. G (FIG. 9). From this passage a round well-shaft led off, at right angles, to the SE, cutting deeply into the chamber of T. G, the floor of which was at least 1.00 above the floor of the bunker (FIG. 10). There was an iron cannonball in the well-fill, and leaning against the side of the well were the remains of a shovel with the head of a pickaxe at its foot. The remains of another shovel and a pitchfork were found on the floor of the tomb chamber. Possible traces of another bunker were found cut into the W edge of the same tomb-chamber with a probable shovel handle in it. The bunker may have been similar to the well-preserved example in the grounds of the Villa Ariadne at Knossos. *AR 23 (1977), 11- 17. L. H. Sackett in BSA 71 (1976) 117-36.

Within living memory there had been a baker's hut at the top of the slope. The machine uncovered its square foundations as surface soil was removed. Remains of two pits with traces of burning found near T. L were possibly connected with the bakery's ovens. There was a filled and levelled stone-built well in the NW corner of the plot. There were high walls on the S and W of the property. As well as the slope down to the N there was a slope to the W down to the level of the main road. After the W wall had been removed and the land behind levelled, part of an earlier cobbled road, or kalderimi, was found, with wall foundations bordering it on the E. The kalderimi was only exposed for a short distance, but appeared to be on a more N axis than that of the modern road which runs NW towards Herakleion. There was a stone cannonball in the wall foundations {supra). After the removal of the wall on the S side of the property, Ts. M and O were found to extend beneath two well-built flights of stone steps leading up to what must once have been a charming little villa belonging to the local Agha. The ruins of this building lay at the top of the slope. R.J. H. THE TOMBS Tomb A (fig. 2) No dimensions and no features of the tomb could be distinguished. The tomb lay at the NW corner of the Koiladhi plot. It had been almost entirely destroyed by one of the square foundation pits sunk by the mechanical excavator. In the E face of the pit pottery was retrieved from two pockets of earth, neither penetrating more than 0.25 into the rock. The first (1.2 below modern surface) may have been part of a niche; it contained fragments of three large vessels, 1-3. The second pocket (at 1.70 below) possibly marks the tomb floor. Sherds were collected from the machine's spoil. POTTERY (PLATE 45) 1. NECK-HANDLED AMPHORA. PH. 30. Rim to belly. Cream slip. Ridge below rim, another between neck and shoulder.

The stomion and blocking had been destroyed. There was a step down from the dromos into the chamber. The chamber was oval in plan. The tomb was on the extreme E side of the Koiladhi plot. Its orientation was ESE-WNW; the chamber was at the E end of the dromos. The tomb was found when a mechanical excavator cut across the dromos at an oblique angle. The tomb had been robbed. Several stones were in situ on the dromos floor 2.50-2.70 from the entrance; there were other disturbed slabs in the fill nearby. There may have been a repiled blocking set well back from the entrance. The chamber may have been entered from the dromos in the second cent. A.D., judging from the sherds in the upper dromos-ñW. After the robbing, the roof collapsed, filling the chamber with crushed kouskouras, tightly compacted by a later overlay of 3.00-4.00 of accumulated soil. 1-3 were in the chamber, c. 0.50 above the floor. 5 was on the floor in the SE of the chamber.

All that remained was the back half of the chamber. The tomb was found when much of it and the dromos was dug away in the mechanical excavation of a foundation pit in the centre of the N circuit of the Koiladhi plot. It was probably orientated ESE-WNW; the chamber was at the E end of the dromos. Where observed, the dromos-ñil was hard, compact brown earth, with no sherds. The chamber was full of kouskouras fallen from the roof. A group often LPG vases remained on the tomb floor, including i, amphora, 2, jug, 3, bell-krater with figured design, 4-55 7-95 bell- skyphoi, 6, 10, cups. In 3, as a secondary burial, were the unburnt bones of a girl, 18-21 years old. Other unburnt bones were found 1.00 away from 3, near the NE wall, possibly of a young male. The finds from this tomb have already been fully published by L. H. Sackett, A new figured krater from Knossos', BSA 71 (1976) 117-50. Reference to the figured krater 3 is made below, pp. 370-1.

The nearly parallel sides of the dromos were very slightly undercut. The dromos rose 0.80 in vertical distance in four shallow steps, the first at a mean angle of 8°, the second at 40, the third at 8°, the last at 160. The step from stomion to chamber was 0.08 deep. The stomion was vestigial, the blocking had disappeared. The chamber was sub-rectangular in plan, little wider than the dromos. The tomb was on the NE limit of the group of Teke tombs, N by W of T. D - the two chambers were 7.00 apart. The orientation was ESE-WNW; the chamber was at the E end of the dromos. The tomb was found after a quantity of pottery appeared during the excavation of foundation pits in the NE corner of the Koiladhi plot. It had been looted. Excavation of the dromos showed there was a deposit of pottery between its far end and a line of stones 1-2 courses high, 1.80 towards the entrance, perhaps a blocking wall. On the E side of this wall was a group of PGB vases - 1, bell-krater with figures, 2, coarse pithos, 3, bell-skyphos, while 4, bell-skyphos was 1.00 further along the dromos, near its S face. Between 4 and the entrance were some small stones and a large boulder (0.50 long). In the entrance were more sherds, one at least belonging to a vase of which a fragment had been found at the W end of the dromos. The chamber was empty. It is not clear whether the dromos vases were in their original position as part of the offerings for the earliest known burial in the chamber, or whether they had been removed from the chamber to make way for a subsequent interment. The contents of the chamber had been removed to the far end of the dromos by the robbers. Neither they nor those who made the latest burials had entirely cleared the dromos to its rock floor and they had not only left the bottom courses of a blocking wall in place, but the nearby dromos fill up to 0.30 deep. 1. 00 NE of the end of the dromos was a roughly circular depression, 0.05-0.20 below modern surface. The original depth of the pit was unknown, since the virgin rock surface had already been bulldozed for the house foundations. The depression/grave-pit was seen to contain the</page><page sequence="26">8 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY partly articulated skeleton of an equid. Subsequent study of the bones by Miss Sheilagh Wall (Mrs. Crowther) revealed the remains of two horses and two dogs, showing that this complex had originally comprised the deliberate burial of horses and dogs of the same kind as the much better preserved T.79 [infra). W of T. F was a pit with much animal bone and some sherds. It was oval, 1.00 X 1.80 in plan, its floor sloping to 0.40 at the S; its E and W sides were fairly vertical. Study by Miss Wall of the bones showed they comprised the skeleton of an ox in a good state of preservation, which she considered might well be modern. The entire feature is therefore likely to be of recent origin. POTTERY (PLATE 48) 1. BELL-KRATER (fig. 59). H. 39. D. 37.5. Nearly complete. Red-brown clay, coffee-brown surface, black paint.

Tomb G (figs. 2, 9-10, plate 7 a-b) Introduction Finds from the BSA's excavation of this tomb included a trenching tool of modern appearance. Hence arose a suspicion that the areas explored in 1976 belonged to a tomb broached by foreign occupying soldiers during the Second World War, and then promptly excavated by Dr. N. Platon, then Ephor of Antiquities in Crete - a tomb of which the precise location was subsequently lost. Our suspicion was confirmed when sherds gathered in 1976 were taken to the reserves of the Herakleion Museum to be compared with those from Platon's tomb. When several joins were noticed between the finds from the two excavations, Dr. S. Alexiou, then Ephor of Antiquities in central Crete, kindly agreed that all the boxes of pottery found by Platon should be temporarily transferred to the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos, so that the possibility of making more joins could be explored. During the study season of 1979, sixty more vessels (here 82-141) could be reconstituted. All material from this tomb, as from the other Teke tombs, is now stored in the Herakleion Museum. During a visit to Knossos, Professor Platon generously agreed that his tomb should be included with the BSA's publication of the other Teke tombs. Working from his notes in 1943 and from our catalogue and photographs of all the pottery (including the newly reconstituted vessels), he contributed in Greek the following detailed account of his excavation, conducted in difficult circumstances. His text appears here in English translation prepared by J. N. Coldstream in consultation with R. J. Howell who then directed the BSA's excavations. It is followed by Mr Howell's account of his own exploration of the tomb in 1976. The 1943 Excavation At the end of July 1943 a German military unit stationed in the neighbourhood of Teke, with their headquarters in the house of Dr. Evanghelis Hatzakis whose land commanded a view over the main Herakleion-Knossos road, constructed an anti-aircraft shelter. Its foundations were dug into soft kouskouras rock at the foot of the wall enclosing the Teke Primary School, situated on a low rise exactly at the corner formed by the main road to Knossos and the lane leading eastwards towards the locality Kephali. While digging the galleries of the shelter the German soldiers came upon the dromoi and the edges of the chambers of two PG-EG tombs, later designated with the letters N and G during the excavations by members of the British School in 1976. The officers in command of the unit invited me, as a representative of the Greek Archaeological Service, to study the chance finds which thus came to light, and to conduct an inspection of the site in order to establish the character and the date of the structures from which the finds had been collected. In the unit's office I was shown a group of about fifteen vases, mainly pouring vessels and hydriai of medium size, a decorated neck of a large amphora, and a large quantity of sherds, all of the Geometric period. I asked the unit commander that the antiquities which had been collected should be handed over to the</page><page sequence="28">I0 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Herakleion Museum. He readily agreed to do so, with the exception of about five or six unbroken pouring vessels which were duplicates, which he wished to keep as souvenirs. This was agreed, on condition that the soldiers should allow and assist with the investigation of the tomb, calling a temporary halt to the digging of the shelter. An inspection of the site (FIGS. 9, 10) established that the gallery which led from N to S into the shelter had been opened with a width of c. 1.00 from N-S, with a slight downward slope and ending in four steps. The passage then turned a right angle toward the SW on the level, and with approximately the same width. A little way beyond the turn, the two walls revealed the section of the dromos of the tomb which was later called Tomb G, in the N wall at 1.10 above the passage floor, but in the S wall from right at the passage floor. In the S wall it was clear that the dromos had arrived at the stomion of the tomb chamber. At this point the upper level in the front part of the chamber had been tunnelled out by the German soldiers; and the tomb had also been disturbed near the stomion by a vertically sunk well, clearly constructed after the chamber had passed out of use. Sherds remained scattered all over the surrounding area. At a distance of 1.00 from the W flank of the stomion, the Germans had begun to construct another passage-gallery of the same width, at right angles to the main shelter, clearly with the purpose of using it as an approach to the main shelter. During the digging of this fork the NW corner of the tomb chamber had been cut away and clearly from this opening some of the contents of the tomb had been removed. The tomb was afterwards disturbed from this direction and also from the front part of the stomion. The Germans had continued the main passage beyond the S fork; clearly their aim was to construct a second exit, perhaps towards the side where a wooden períptero was later built. During this inspection, work was stopped in both passages. From the observations made in the entrance gallery of the shelter with its steps, and from following a layer of ash descending gently in the walls of the passage, it became clear that the gallery had coincided with the dromos of another tomb, later called Tomb N. Clearly the course of this dromos ran obliquely in relation to the axis of the entrance gallery of the shelter. A little way beyond the steps many stones had been removed, which clearly had come from the blocking wall of the stomion. Some of them remained in situ high up in the corner of the gallery. In the section at the corner, at a relatively high level - higher than the opening into the entrance of the other tomb - there appeared a section of the tomb chamber with part of its contents, of which other sherds were scattered on the floor of the passage. Clearly it was not feasible to excavate this tomb without destroying the entrance and the corner of the shelter passage; this excavation was therefore postponed. (The chamber of Tomb N was recognised later when the foundations of a building were laid near it, to the E of it, and cut through it.) Also the excavation which subsequently took place with the special permission of the unit commander was achieved only under great pressure since it interrupted work on the digging of the shelter. It lasted two and a half days with a limited personnel, namely Zacharias Kanakis the chief draughtsman of the Museum, the foreman of the Museum, and the phylax of the Knossos archaeological area. Before work began, the discarded sherds and fragments of pottery thrown out with the soil from the shelter were collected, as well as those that had been scattered over the shelter passages. It was clear that many of them had come from the dromos and stomion of Tomb N. The quantity of fragmentary vessels thus collected was very large, and for that reason it was extremely difficult to determine the number and shape of vessels until they were eventually mended. They could not be mended at the time since the Herakleion Museum and its workshop were not then functioning. The whole pottery collected by the Germans clearly</page><page sequence="29">THE TEKE SITE T. G n came from the w part of Tomb G, from the opening which had been created there. A smaller number would have come from the upper layer of the front part of the chamber, and from the stomion. That would explain why, during the excavation, very few pots were found in the W part of the chamber, and also why some of those found in the E part were found incomplete, and were later completed with sherds thrown out with the earth and on the floor of the chamber. Few sherds came from the stomion which, as has been mentioned, had been thoroughly disturbed by the well sunk from above. The tomb floor was 0.40 above the level of the passage. This indicates a steep incline for the dromos, whose floor was 1.10 above the level of the passage on its N side, as has been mentioned. It seems very likely that there had been three steps in front of the stomion, of which traces of two were detected. From the plans of Tombs G and N which were prepared after the British School's excavation, it emerged that the Germans had changed their intention of constructing the main chamber of the shelter at the end of the S fork, which cut off a small part of the chamber of Tomb G. They were assisted by the existence of the tomb chamber, and opened up (their) chamber with its floor one metre lower down. They did not open this up to the full extent of the tomb's chamber, the floor of which was thus left at a higher level. At first the shelter chamber had not yet been opened and consequently had not damaged the contents of the tomb. Moreover it appears that the Germans deepened their original passage, since originally the chamber floor of Tomb G was found 0.40 below the level of the shelter floor which cut its dromos. I did not follow the work for the completion of the shelter, and the conclusions concerning its final form come only from the details which emerged from the British School's excavation. The Excavation of Tomb G Excavation began from the tomb's stomion, of which the right side was preserved to a width of 0.50, while the left had been cut off by the well (FIG. 9). The latter had also encroached slightly on the front part of the chamber. Clearly it had been vertically sunk at a period later than the latest vases deposited in the stomion of the tomb. Sherds of these vases were collected in the upper fill of the well and in the surrounding area. Owing to the restricted resources then at our disposal and the urgency of the work, it was not feasible to clear the well entirely. A little way down the sherds ceased. At a slightly deeper level there was only an iron ball, clearly of Venetian or early Turkish date, indicating the relatively late date of the well. The chamber proved to be of horseshoe or mushroom shape, 2.80 wide on its NW side, and not more than 2.10 deep. Because the confined space did not permit any easy view of the whole chamber, it was very difficult to make an accurate general plan. Nevertheless the impression was given that the NE side of the chamber was relatively contracted, and symmetrically placed in relation to the dromos. The w part of the NW side was 1.10 long, and that which survived of the E part after the opening of the well was only 0.25; the length of the whole (NW) side did not exceed 2.80-2.90, taking account of the portion shaved off at the W corner. The greater part of the roof had collapsed, and a great mass of kouskouras had fallen into the middle of the W side of the chamber. It was thus very difficult to calculate the original height; towards the back of the chamber, however, its curvature was detected, showing clearly that the height cannot have been very great. In the tomb plan are marked the vases found in situ during the excavation. Their position is shown only approximately, since the confined space did not allow a general view which would have established the relative position of the vases. Clearly certain vessels had already been removed by the German workmen from the front part of the tomb, and especially from the w</page><page sequence="30">I2 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY part beyond the fallen mass of kouskouras. Most of the cremation urns were found smashed, but their fragments remained in situ and were collected. Because of the urgency of the excavation, only general notes on the vases were kept, for recognition after mending. These notes proved in the end to be insufficient, since the piles of sherds produced many vessels similar to one another. Almost all the urns contained burnt bones, many of which had been scattered with the collapse of the vessels which contained them. The large krater H and the vase N (which appears to be a large amphora) contained no bones. Near or inside the urns were found smaller pots which accompanied the burials. Most were found in the small urn I. In cases where the pots were found either inside or outside the urns, but had got mixed up with the fragments of the urns when the latter had been broken, their exact association is not certain. The tomb floor had been sprinkled with fine shingle (tsaihi). The marking of the tomb vases follows the letters of the Greek alphabet, but nevertheless they were extracted in the order given below. By mistake the letter H was given to two vases, the large krater and the large oinochoe with scale decoration; the latter is now marked Hi. H= G 80 (HM 12149). Large pedestalled krater. Broken into many fragments, but its conical foot remained in situ. Above it were found frs. of a one-handled cup coated in brown paint and with a conical projection on the base and light decoration inside. Near the krater was collected a large and curious bone of cylindrical shape. In the photograph it appears broken in two. B = G 6-7 (HM 12074-5) Straight-sided pithos and conical lid. F = Gii (HM 12079) Small neckless ovoid pithos. A = G 8-9 (HM 12076-7) Large neckless ovoid pithos, conical lid. Z = (Not mended or photographed) Small pithos of coarse brown clay with domed lid broken above the knob. The neck of the following vase Hi fell into it. Hi = G 14 (HM 12082) Large oinochoe. From near its neck was collected another small decorated oinochoe found complete (?). Within the space of Hi was found a thick base of a vase with a central depression. A = G 10 (HM 12078) Small neckless ovoid pithos. Near by was found a small unbroken oinochoe with similar decoration, i.e. a zigzag panel on the neck, bands and lines on the body.5 In front of this urn had been placed a hemispherical bronze bowl which contained a clay vessel (S), well preserved. (The bronze bowl was probably preserved whole, and may not be the same as the photographed frs.) M = ?G 12 (HM 12080) (But see infra) Found in frs., partly mixed with the frs. of B and F.

N = ?G 3 (HM 1 2071) Belly-handled amphora. Only the lower part was found in situ. It appears to be the amphora of which the Germans found the decorated neck in two pieces. If so, it should be identified with G 3 since no other large amphora from the tomb had a decorated neck except for G 83 which has no base, and G 82 whose neck bears only a narrow zone of triangles and was smashed into many frs. The amphora G 3 has a deeply hollowed-out conical foot which is described in the day-book. It seems very likely that the other large amphorae mended from fragments also came from the W part of the chamber which was found empty, i.e. G 2 (HM 12090), G 5 (HM 12073) and G 4 (HM 12072). Two other similar amphorae were found in a fragmentary state: G 82 and G 83. Three more cremation urns were mended from fragments: G no (similar to A), G 105 with lid G 89,6 and G 12 (HM 12080?) with PG decoration. Perhaps bell-skyphoi like G 77-9 (HM 1 2 146-8) and G 122 constituted the contents of this PG urn, as in other comparable Knossian cemeteries. Perhaps the position of G 12 was in the SE corner, where other PG vessels were also found. If the use of the tomb began in that corner, that would be the source of other PG vessels like the oinochoe G 92, the kalathoi G 54 (but G 54 = K above-JNC), 55 and 90, the oinochoai G 24-5, the jug-aryballoi G 107-09, the skyphoi G 41, 123-4 and 128 and the skyphoi with reflex handles G 39, 42, 45-65 1067), 117-9 and the pyxides G 52-3. It is not possible to determine the position in the chamber and stomion of the other later vases which were collected whole or in fragments and then restored. These include: the very fragmentary urns G 84, 86-7, and 134; a group of hemispherical cups with low lip like those found in urn I (G 69, 70 72-3, 76, 130); cups with broader strap handle and more onset lip, some decorated but most fully coated (G 58-9, 61-4, 131-2); the more open decorated cup G 60; skyphoi with more or less offset lips G 40, 43-4, 48, 126; the skyphos 125 with a zigzag panel like the urns A and G no; the skyphos frs. G 121 and 1275 also the jug G 68 and the incised oinochoai 138-40, and the other ribbed oinochoai G 31-2 (?) (like G 27-30 found in the urn I); the oinochoai G 93-5; the frs. G 98, 100, 101, 103 and 104; the oinochoai G 15-17, 20, 21; and the hydriai G 33-5 and 137. It can be considered almost certain that the intact or almost intact oinochoai and hydriai G 16, 17 and 33-5 were among the vases collected and handed over by the Germans, but I cannot remember whether the oinochoe G 20 (HM 12089) was among them. This last seems to be of the Orientalizing period; nevertheless its shape is derived from LG, to which this oinochoe could be assigned because of its double handle and its band of decoration on the neck. It would thus belong to the same stage as the oinochoe G 21, mended from many fragments. The series of pouring vessels and hydriai would have been found in the W and front parts of the tomb on the NW which were disturbed by the Germans.

G 37 (HM 1 2 106) is a LM I A vessel of which hardly a quarter is preserved; its discovery perhaps in the dromos earth does not present a serious problem, since there were Minoan tombs in the Teke area. Other vases collected inside the double vase G 49 and the fragments of another similar, G 135, with its lid G 136; the fragmentary krater G 112, the krater foot G 113, the dish G 88 (cf. G 51), the small conical lid G 67, and the tray G 50. A few pieces of bronze vessels, from handles, lips, embossed walls and bases, etc., perhaps fell into the NE corner of the chamber of Tomb G from the chamber of Tomb N which had been breached at this point. Tomb G was used from PG times until the beginning of the Geometric period. N. P. The 1976 Excavation Extant L, overall: 5.00 Extant L of Dromos: 2.06 W. 1.06 Stomion: estimated 0.67-0.60 Chamber 3.15 X c. 2.20 What remained of the dromos appeared to rise 0.45 in vertical distance at an angle of 12. 50. The stomion (the N side of which had been destroyed) appeared to widen between dromos and chamber. The surviving (s) jamb was unusually deep. A slight threshold within the stomion created a step 0.10 down into the chamber, whose plan was roughly 'mushroom'-shaped. Its floor was strewn with sand and small pebbles. The chamber wall was preserved to a greatest H. of 0.88. The tomb was part of the NE-SW line of chamber tombs found in the Niotakis plot - N-G-H-J-L-K - immediately SW of T. N. The orientation was SE-NW, the chamber on the SE side of the dromos. The tomb was found by chance in July 1943, during the construction of a bunker by troops of the Occupying Power, and was investigated by the late N. Platon, at that time Ephor of Antiquities in Herakleion (see, supra, translation of N. Platon's account of his work). Its position was re-identified in 1976 when rescue excavation was undertaken at the Niotakis plot, after parts of the site had been bulldozed, when the NW end of the dromos was destroyed and the roof of the chamber (assuming that it had survived) was removed. At some undetermined time, a well-shaft had been sunk which passed through the front part of the chamber, destroying part of the stomion in the process; its fill contained sherds, apparently from pots once in the chamber. One of the galleries of the bunker had cut through the dromos close to the stomion; from that gallery a small dug-out had been excavated which had added to the destruction in the stomion and the front of the chamber. The roofs of dug-out and tomb had subsequently collapsed, though the areas below may not have been completely filled until the bulldozer began work. The SW corner of the chamber had also been dug away, perhaps by another dug-out. (The end of a modern wooden handle - Pshovel - was found upright at the side of this cutting.) The dromos fill consisted of a block of fallen kouskouras 0.32 thick with red soil above. There may have been a small side-chamber, or niche, in the S wall of the dromos, close to the stomion, though evidence for it had been mostly destroyed by the gallery. Some of the dug-out was removed, though its floor, at least 1.00 below the chamber floor, was not uncovered. In the fill were modern sherds and rubbish, as well as many small fragments of bronze and a few sherds later seen to have fallen from T. N, a corner of which had collapsed into the dug-out. Upright</page><page sequence="33">THE TEKE SITE T. G 15 against the NE side of the dug-out was a wooden-handled shovel, with a heavy N European type of pickaxe head at its feet. The soldiers had obviously removed some of the contents of the chamber while excavating their dug-out; the rest of the tomb seems to have been cleared subsequently, since practically nothing was found on its floor, apart from a modern shovel and two parts of an iron fork. A group of sherds found close to the edge of the chamber (G 83) and a few scraps of bronze found some way above the floor may have belonged to the tomb, f 1, small bronze fragment, was on the remaining narrow strip of floor between the dug-out and the NE edge of the chamber (in this position, of course, f 1 might have fallen from T. N). A few more flakes of bronze lay on the floor on the S side of the chamber. POTTERY (PLATES 49-60) 1. NECK-HANDLED AMPHORA (HM 12069). H. 64. DR. 20. Parts of body restored.

G-H 23 Tomb H (figs. 2, 8, plate 7 c-e) Extant L. overall 3.30 Dromos: extant L. 2.28 W. 0.80-1. 18 (at the stomiori) Stomion: 0.72 X c. 0.37 Chamber: 1.06 X 0.85. Maximum extant H. 0.57. The NW end of the dromos was lost. The dromos walls were preserved up to 0.12. The dromos floor descended 0.04 vertically from the stomion as far as it was preserved at a mean angle of c. 50. The jambs of the shallow stomion were eccentric and irregular. There was a shallow step up from the dromos to the stomion varying 0.09-0.12 in height. A large poros blocking slab 0.74 X 0.48 X 0.20 lay in the entrance to the chamber, displaced and tilting inwards at an angle of 61 ° from the vertical. The roof of the small oval chamber was lost. The floor, which was covered in coarse sand and small pebbles was c. 2.70 below modern surface. A relatively large side-chamber, sub-rectangular in plan, had been cut into the W face of the dromos, 1.62 wide, 0.92-0.71 deep from N-S. Its w wall stood 0.34 high; its floor was 0.07-0.12 above the dromos floor. The tomb was in the middle of the NE- SW line of chamber tombs on the Niotakis plot (N-G-H-J- L- K). Its SSE- NNW orientation distinguished it from its fellows, and it was set further into the slope of the hill. The chamber was at the SE end of the dromos. The tomb was found in investigating the plot after a bulldozer had been at work. This work destroyed the NNW end of the dromos, and removed the chamber roof. The tomb had previously been looted. Large sherds scattered in the area of dromos and chamber pointed to looting. There were large stone slabs in the dromos which came from the chamber blocking, concentrated near the stomion. One, of squared poros (0.47 X 0.25 X o. 10) was NW of the main slab [supra), while another, to the W, had been squared on one side only. On top of the W end of the largest blocking stone was a fragmentary lid, 1. Fragments of a cup, 2, oinochoe, 3, were further N. Large pieces of 4, pithos-urn, were E of the main blocking stone. There was a scatter of sherds and some burnt bone in the chamber at the level of the top of the blocking stone. At the same level were two separated halves of a glass bead, £2. Near the centre were three fragments of iron pins (fj); Í4, 5, iron pins, were in the same level. Under the sherd-scatter was a layer of soil with fewer sherds; here was f65 iron fragment c. 0.05 below the other iron. There was another group of sherds and burnt bone just above the floor. Two lids, 5, 6, were on the floor on the w side of the chamber. In the NW corner of the side-chamber was a pile of four stones, perhaps part of the blocking wall of the main chamber.

TOMBj (FIGS. 2, 11, PLATE 8) Extant L. overall: 3.06 Dromos: extant L. 1.64 W. 1.06 Stomion: 1. 00 wide, 0.47 deep Chamber: 1.95 X 1. 16 Chamber wall preserved up to 0.90. Chamber floor 2.00-3.00 below modern surface. What was preserved of the dromos was irregular. The floor rose a vertical distance of c. 0.20 at a mean angle of 50. The stomion was evidently damaged since there was a jamb c. 0.45 on the S side, none on the N; there were no blocking stones. An irregularly cut step 0.14 high led</page><page sequence="44">26 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY down from stomion to chamber. The sub-rectangular chamber was unevenly cut. The chamber floor sloped down from door to back wall, more steeply in the front, levelling off towards the back. In the E corner was a roughly squared stone stand 0.33 X 0.28 X 0.11, one corner of which had been rounded to fit the chamber corner. The tomb was near the middle of the NE-SW line of chamber tombs on the Niotakis plot (N- G- H-J- L-K). Its orientation was SE- NW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found after the mechanical clearance of the building plot. Its upper part was removed by the machine, slightly damaging two of the vessels still upright. It was otherwise undisturbed, its contents in situ. Just outside the dromos^ near its present mouth, was a bronze pin fragment, fi3, perhaps part of the original tomb furniture. From sherds found flat and trodden into the dromos floor the kantharos 56 was recomposed. In the chamber, on the stone stand in the E corner {supra) was an EPG coarse pithos, 2, high enough for its rim to have been damaged by the machine. It contained the remains of two interments - a swept-up inhumation of a woman of c. 22 including, at the top of the urn, part of the skull, with maxilla and mandible detached and displaced towards the side. Beneath was the cremation of a female, probably under 30. On the SE side of the skull were two pieces of a bronze dress pin, later found to have been silver- plated, £3. Just under the mandible was a gold pin, fj, its pair £7 was a little lower, on the other side of the urn. Slightly higher, on the same side, was a rounded stone pellet £5; closer to the skull was a rock crystal bead, f6. Among the cremation was a miniature rock crystal double axe, £8, an amethyst bead, £9, a LM III B steatite sealstone, fio and, lowest of all, a pierced bone plaque, fu, apparently burnt. A carnelian bead, fi2, was found when the urn contents were sieved. The unburnt remains perhaps belonged to an earlier burial which was swept up and placed in 2, on top of the cremation. Possibly the grave goods in the urn, except fu, belonged to this secondary burial, even if some of them had worked their way to the upper level of the cremation. Perhaps, too, the kalathos 53, in the W corner of the chamber behind the amphora 4, and the fragments in the dromos (supra) belonged to the earlier burial. In the middle of the chamber, at the back, was the MPG amphora 1 with, inside it, fragments of a MPG stirrup-jar 55, evidently placed as a stopper in i's mouth. In the W corner was the large EPG amphora 4, an amphoriskos 3, in its mouth. The remaining vases were arranged between these three large vases (1, 2, 4), round the edge of the chamber. Near the S wall was the MPG amphora 55 between it and 1 were an amphoriskos 65 an oinochoe 8, stirrup-jars 7, 16, pyxides 9, 13, a lid 10, skyphoi 11, 15 (the former nested with a cup 39), and cups 12, 14. E of these, partly under 15 and behind 1, clay beads (£2) were scattered in two lines. One, with plainer beads, was close to the wall; the other, with more decorative beads, to the W, though this included some plain beads and one of glass. Others were more widely scattered to the NE and in the centre. The two lines were perhaps separate strings that were eventually broken and to some extent scattered. Immediately in front of 1, an amphoriskos 17 was inside a shallow skyphos 18. Between 1 and 2 was a special concentration of vases, especially around 2 where some seem to have been stacked originally. These included a MPG stirrup-jar 19, an amphoriskos 20, a MPG pyxis 21, with cups 47, 48 beneath it; also a skyphos 22, an amphoriskos 23 overlying a shallow skyphos 24 in which the cup 40 was nested (part of 22 was under 24). There were four clay beads (£2) in the MPG amphora close to the back wall. Just in front of 2 was the amphoriskos 35. A tripod cooking pot 46 stood between 35 and 21. Between 21 and 2 was a fallen stack of vessels - high-footed skyphos 50 containing high-footed cups 51 and 54. The cup 49 was above 50, the high-footed cup 45</page><page sequence="45">THE TEKE SITE - T. J 2y below it. On the floor, between i and 38, was the bronze bowl (fi) with the Phoenician inscription. In front of 2, against the N wall, was a kalathos 37, piled high with a heap of vessels including, on top, high-footed skyphoi (27, 31, 34), cups (28-30, 32-3), an amphoriskos (35) with more cups below (41, 43-4), and a high-footed cup (42). SW of 37 stood the oinochoe 26 with, just beyond it, the tray 25. In the W corner, piled up, behind 4, were a kalathos 52, and a cup 53. POTTERY 1. BELLY-HANDLED AMPHORA. H. 60. DR. 22.

Chamber wall was preserved up to 0.48. The outline of what remained of the dromos was irregular; it narrowed towards the stomion. What remained rose a vertical distance of 0.06 at an angle of 50. A prominent jamb survived on the S side of the stomion, which led down to the chamber by a curved step 0.06-0.08. The chamber seems to have been roughly mushroom-shaped in plan. The tomb was near the sw end of the NE-SW line of chamber tombs (N-G-H-J-L-K) in the Niotakis plot. Its orientation was SE-NW; the chamber was on the SE side of the dromos. The tomb was found following the mechanical clearance of the plot, which removed the S edge of the chamber and three stones which might have been part of the blocking. The floor had not been far below modern surface, which sloped down steeply towards the main road, just W of the tomb. The chamber had been partly destroyed long before, and its outline, and the dromos, could be made out only with difficulty, for the kouskouras here was much weathered and probably disturbed by root activity. The tomb had been looted. Traces of a modern fire- pit were found in the area just above dromos and stomion floor. One of the stones (0.44 X 0.39 X 0.13) pulled out by the machine seemed to have come from the dromos] the other two may have come from the same spot and perhaps were originally part of the door blocking. Scattered sherds were found in the dromos, including large pieces near the dromos and stomion floor. In the chamber, especially in the NE part, there were fragments at floor level, including parts of a stirrup-jar, 16. On the E side a kouskouras fall had crushed a pyxis and lid, 1; beneath, and nearer the wall, the base of an amphora, 7, suggested the chamber had been robbed before the fall. A few apparently unburnt bone fragments were found on the floor. POTTERY (PEATE 67) i. PYXIS (Fid. 66). H. IO.2. DR. 9.5. Complete. Yellow slip.

L-M gg have been as much as 0.26, led from the stomion into the mushroom-shaped chamber, with level floor. The tomb was on the SW edge of the Niotakis plot, perhaps part of a NE-SW bank of tombs to which Ts. O and Qalso belonged. Its orientation was SE-NW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found after mechanical clearing of the plot, when its dromos was seen in the scarp left by the machine in front of the lower flight of stairs that led to the Agha's ruined house. The chamber was directly below the steps; its roof must have been destroyed before they were built. A channel cut 0.16 below the original dromos floor may represent the remains of a robbing tunnel into the tomb. The S side of the dromos seems to have been largely destroyed, perhaps at the same time. The tomb had been ransacked. There was a mass of broken pottery in the area of the stomion and dromos, including 1, a tray, 2, a lid found under a large stone over the ruined W side of the dromos, and 3, another tray, to the E. Into the chamber was 4, base of an urn lying on edge. Parts of these vessels were found strewn across the tomb, fi, iron fragment, was on the E side of the stomion. There was more pottery on the W side, including 5, two halves of a skyphos 0.15 apart. To the W of these was the base of a bell-krater, 6, two aryballoi, 7 and 8. On the NE side was 9, fragments of a lid. Fragments were found all over the chamber and stomion, possibly belonging to 4. All these items seemed to be 0.05-0.10 above the chamber floor. Among the sherds were several large stones, perhaps remains of the blocking wall. Under the general level of sherds was a scatter of burnt bones, with one concentration in the stomion associated with sherds of a thin-walled vessel, another on the E side of the chamber near the entrance. These probably represent points where ash-urns were emptied by the robbers. POTTERY (PLATES 68-9) 1. TRAY (fig. 67). H. 4.6. DR. 20. Complete base with one third of wall. White grits.

Tomb N (figs. 2, 9-10, plate 9 d) (For general circumstances of discovery, and relationship with T. G, see T. G, supra) All dimensions are largely conjectural. Extant L. overall: 3.00. Dromos: extant L. 0.80. W. c. 1. 00. Stomion: irrecoverable. Chamber: 3.00 wide, 2.20 deep. Chamber wall preserved up to 0.85. The chamber was probably mushroom-shaped in plan. Other features of the tomb's architecture are conjectural.</page><page sequence="53">THE TEKE SITE Is. M-N 35 The tomb was furthest NE of the NE-SW line of chamber tombs (N-G-H-J-L-K) on the Niotakis plot. It was constructed so close to T. G (though its floor was 0.78 higher than that tomb) that the two chambers must almost have - if not quite - intersected. The orientation seems to have been SE-NW, the chamber at the E end of the dromos. The tomb's existence was gradually appreciated during the excavation of the Niotakis plot following mechanical clearance, though the NE arc of the chamber was partly dug as T. C the previous year, 1975, during emergency excavation on the Koiladhi plot. In 1976, from the Niotakis plot perspective, it was at first thought to be T G's side-chamber (though it was understood that it had been designated T C in 1975). It had had a turbulent history, including looting, probably in antiquity. The gallery for the wartime bunker had penetrated the hillside from the NW, slicing the dromos at an oblique angle, before its right angled turn SW, cutting through part of the chamber, and continuing towards the dromos of T. G. The 1976 bulldozer had further damaged the dromos, almost totally destroying it. The bunker-diggers must have removed some of the contents of T. N's chamber, since part of its floor had been cut away (though a large stone slab 0.32 above the floor had apparently remained undisturbed). Perhaps the bunker which had cut into G's chamber had also sliced through the extreme SW corner of T. N. Sometime after the bunker was abandoned the W corner of N's chamber collapsed into it, leaving the W part of its floor sloping down towards T. G at a gradient of 1 in 2. The first part of T. N to be excavated was that which had fallen into the bunker, followed by the area above the sloping part of the floor. An ash-urn may have stood here originally since small fragments of burnt bone were found above the sloping floor, and more in the bunker fill. Small flakes of bronze were found in the bunker fill (samples 1-5), which probably belonged to a bronze object part of which, fi, was crushed under a stone which had fallen from N into the bunker, where it lay, 0.12 above the bunker floor, in an arc 0.27 wide. Many other small bronze fragments were found nearby, probably belonging to the same object. f25 a gold boss, was found adhering to the same stone. Just S, on the same side of the stone, was a patch of powdered copper oxide; a coarse sherd - ?part of the ash-urn - also had adhering copper oxide. Some of the burnt bone from here was also stained with copper. Further E, a gold ornament, £4, was found 0.14 over the sloping floor, with i, base of an aryballos, nearby. NE was an iron spearhead, £5, with f6, iron object, SE near the chamber wall. Just NE was f8, another piece of iron. The upper part of the chamber had been removed by the machine, but a group of large stone blocking slabs still lay where the looters had left them, scattered across the centre of the tomb. At this level, 0.50 above floor, were large sherds N and S of the stones. To the S, near the wall, groups of sherds belonged to specific pots (2-4), but elsewhere they were inextricably jumbled. Patches of bronze fragments (Samples 6-7, 9) were found at several points in the chamber and, in one case, in what remained of the dromos floor near the stomion (Sample 10). A bronze pin fragment, fg, was 0.10 above floor at the chamber centre; bronze fragments, fio, were found 0.20 above floor on the E side, and there were others, fu, towards the centre. A bronze pin fragment, fi2, was found on the E side, with a concentration of bronze flakes around it. There were large sherds in the same area, and there may be others in that part of the chamber inaccessible to excavation under the foundations of the new building to the E. Sherds from T. C (1975) belonged to vases found in T. N.</page><page sequence="54">36 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY POTTERY (PLATES 70-72) 1. *JUG (?)-ARYBALLOS. PH. 6.7. Base to shoulder. Yellow slip.

This tomb, exceptionally, comprised two chambers (n and s) in tandem, the S apparently added after the irretrievable loss of the N chamber's roof, the latter essentially becoming part of the dromos leading to the former.</page><page sequence="57">THE TKKK SITE Is. N () gg The dromos in its later phase rose 1.05 in vertical distance, at a mean angle of 180. In the earlier phase (assuming the X half was not then reçut) it rose 0.44 in vertical distance at a mean angle of 190. There had apparently been two steps out of the chamber through the stomion when the X chamber stood, 0.95 beyond which was a single step and an increase in dromos gradient (from 70 to 24o). The entrance to the S chamber, down into which there was a step, extended a small distance into what had been the floor of the N chamber. The walls of the dromos sloped slightly inwards towards the top; it narrowed somewhat as it reached the N chamber. The X chamber had been oval in plan; its original cutting was very clear up to c. 0.30 above the floor, but thereafter its walls were very irregular, having fallen away. On the 'V side from a height of c. 0.90 above floor the kouskouras was cut straight in such a manner as to continue the line of the dromos. The S chamber was cut from the X chamber's back wall. Its floor was c. 0.30 below the X chamber. It had roughly straight side walls, a rounded back wall. A flat stone 0.38 X 0.48 X 0.08 was in situ in its entrance, no doubt the foundation of its blocking wall. The roof was largely intact, but was missing over what will have been its stomion. At the X end of the dromos in its E face was Niche 1, c. 0.65 of whose width was excavated; it was at least 0.45 deep. Its floor was 0.60-0.70 above dromos floor. Niche 2 was cut into the S end of the E dromos wall and into the adjoining wall of the X chamber, c. 0.65 wide, 0.40 deep. There is no note of the height of its floor above the adjacent floors. The tomb lay astride (to the x) the Niotakis and (to the s) Koiladhi plots, most S of the Teke tombs, perhaps part of a XE-SW bank to which Ts. M and Qalso belonged. Its orientation was SE-XW, the chamber(s) on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found (in 1976) when the machine digging foundations on the Niotakis plot cut the X end of the dromos and grazed the X end of Niche 1. A 1.10 length of the dromos and Niche 1 were then excavated. Beyond that, the dromos ran under a heavy concrete staircase on the Koiladhi plot, making further excavation too dangerous. By 1980 the staircase had been removed and it was possible, through the goodwill of Mr. S. Koiladhis, to excavate that part of the tomb that lay on his property, in the process destroying a remaining part of the stair and a concrete courtyard to the S. Between the 1976 and 1980 excavations some 0.75 of the dromos must have been destroyed at the same time as the staircase, probably during construction of the building which had by now been erected on the Niotakis plot, covering the 1976 excavation. The modern structures {supra) probably date c. 1900. Parts of them rested on kouskouras bedrock, except where the gap in the bedrock over the X chamber existed, and here they were founded on the hard reddish earth which filled both chambers. With the exception of Niche 1, the tomb had been robbed in antiquity. The reddish fill, containing G sherds of mixed periods, which became larger, less worn and more numerous as the excavation went down, proved to be robbing spoil, almost certainly R. There were fragments of R lamps, pots and tile throughout, but nothing later. The robbers may have dug straight down into the X chamber, thence to the S chamber, ignoring the dromos and Niche 1. They may have found the blocking of the S chamber intact. A number of small to medium stones had been piled to the E of the entrance to the S chamber, on or just above the floor of the X chamber, and one or two had also been pushed inside the S chamber. The floor and much of the walls of the S chamber were coated with a thin layer of fine grey- brown silty mud, separating the kouskouras from the robbing fill, which grew progressively harder from top to bottom, and was hardest in the S chamber. This suggested8 that the S 8 The lati* Antonis Zidianakis, the School's Foreman at Knossos, who dug this tomb, offered this interpretation of the silt.</page><page sequence="58">40 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY chamber had been flooded and then dried out and that the tomb had been looted and back- filled in wet conditions, probably, therefore, in winter. In the dromos, on dromos-ftll, parallel with Niche i, was a low retaining wall. Below the level of its stones was 25 PG oinochoe. Among the stones was 9, sherd of an EG amphora (?). On the W side of the dromos, opposite the niche, lower than its floor, was 6, an ash-urn, inverted, still containing burnt bone. Ash was also found strewn in the dromos at this level. Near it, 0.66 above the dromos floor, was a PGB oinochoe, 10. Beneath 6 was an Attic LPG jug, 7. Fragments of an LPG bell-krater, 12, were also found in the dromos. On the step leading from the dromos to the N chamber was 29, PG jug (unbroken). On the floor of the N chamber, just W of the entrance to the S chamber, in a thin level of apparently lighter, browner and softer earth, with more kouskouras and fewer stones, were fragments of 25, a plain pithos perhaps in situ. Just to the S, still nearer the S chamber, were sherds of 24, O polychrome pithos, in a heap with sherds of other pithoi. Also on the floor, nearer the centre, were the fragmentary O aryballoi, 22, 23. This thin level may have been a pre-robbing roof- fall level, though the change was not particularly clear. Somewhat above 24 were fragments of the base of the LG pithos, 19 (many of whose body sherds were in the S chamber fill). In its area were amphora (?) 17, 18, fragments of coarse pithoi, c. 0.30 above floor, 19's base sherds just below 18's. c. 0.40 above the floor, in the N part, was a mass of smashed pottery including fragments of 14 (MG pithos - partly above the dromos), 15 (EG ash-urn), 16 (plain pithos). There was a heavy scatter of burnt bone around and below 15; one of its pieces was found c. 0.30 higher in the robbing fill. There was a predominance of O material on the N chamber floor, with LG sherds above them, MG or even earlier pieces above those, in the reverse of proper chronological order. In the S chamber the upper half of a MPG stirrup jar, 28, was jammed between a stone and the back wall, next to 27, base of a LG pithos. £5, part of an iron javelin head on the E side of the entrance, may alone have been in situ in this chamber. Niche 2 {supra) was empty. Though the contents of Niche 1 had been disturbed within the period of the tomb's use, its ash-urns and their lids were in situ. At the S end of the niche were the EG pithos and lid, 4, 5, and, inside, aryballos, 8, and three iron fragments, identified during the study of the cremation. 1, in the N end of the niche, was a MG pithos, containing 3, a MG aryballos. In the light of the evidence described above it is suggested that after the tomb's first use, the dromos was not completely dug out for every fresh interment. Niche 1 was probably cut quite high in the dromos wall to avoid the need for removing all the fill, so that when pots which may have been in the niche were thrown out to make way for others, they fell not on the dromos floor, but where they were found, 0.60-0.70 above the floor (supra)', that ash was also found at the same level helps corroborate this reconstruction. Dromos and Niche 1 suggests two 'spring cleanings'. In EG it was necessary to rehouse PG and EG interments (4, 6, 12). At the end of MG or early in LG, 6 and 12 and the smaller pots found near them were thrown into the partly-excavated dromos to make room in the niche for 1 and its contents. A theoretical history may be summarised thus:- 1 Dromos and N chamber dug in the PG period. 2 Used in PG. 3 Overcrowded in EG; PG and EG pots removed to Niche 1. 4 EG-MG. Collapse of N chamber; converted into S extension of the dromos. S chamber dug; its first interment may have been 15.</page><page sequence="59">THE TEKE SITE T.

Stomion: 0.83-0.80 wide, 0.53 deep. Chamber: 2.51 X 2.26. Greatest H. of chamber 1.25. This tomb was excavated in very difficult circumstances, which prevented its full investigation, particularly of the dromos and S side-chamber. The dromos had been cut down from the top of the kouskouras, 2.62 above its floor. It may originally have been narrower than its 1.23 at the top, since by the time of the latest fill, parts of the dromos and stomion walls had spalled off. The dromos may have been cut from another 0.60 above the kouskouras, through a layer of hard red earth, though as the upper dromos fill was very similar, it was difficult to decide. The dromos floor rose a vertical distance of 0.06 from the stomion as far as it was excavated, at an angle of 50. A 0.04 step cut in the kouskouras up from the dromos formed the threshold in the stomion, with a 0.08 step down into the chamber. The E side of the threshold was 0.14 higher than the rest for an area 0.15 wide on the dromos side, and 0.14 on the chamber side. The whole threshold may originally have been raised to the same height, by the use of squared stone blocks, removed by the robbers. The stomion was preserved to a greatest height of 0.62 above the threshold on the W side, and up to that point could be seen curving in with an overhang of 0.06 over the base. The chamber was an irregular oval in plan, though, because of collapsed sides, its precise outline was difficult to trace. Part at least of the chamber floor seems to have been paved, since six slabs, mostly of limestone, were found in situ. Others were in the rubble fill in the front part of the chamber and may have been displaced from the front and E side of the chamber. The slabs varied in thickness from 0.04-0.10, and the floor they formed was e. 0.11 above the original kouskouras floor. Slabs were 0.50 X 0.35, 0.45 X 0.35, 0.36 X 0.24. The SE-most slab of red sandstone, 0.04 thick, was unique. The height of the chamber was difficult to determine because the roof had fallen. The fill in the front of the chamber was 1.90 above the floor, but possibly part of the roof had already fallen before that fill was deposited. This point was 2.50 below modern surface. The ancient ground surface was hard to determine, since the layers over bedrock had been removed before excavation. The S side-chamber opened 0.55 from the stomion. Its ground plan may have been roughly rectangular, 1.76 deep, and more than 0.70 wide. Its floor seemed to slope down slightly towards the interior. There was a slight niche 0.09 deep in the chamber's S wall; 0.80 above the floor the S wall had been cut back to form a shelf 0.30 wide. The roof was 1.90 high at the front, but diminished to 1.62 at the lowest point uncovered. The tomb was the furthest SE of the Teke group, perhaps part of a NE-SW bank to which Ts. M and O also belonged. Its orientation was approximately SE-NW, the chamber being on the E side of the dromos. It lay immediately SE of the house belonging to Mrs. A. Koiladhi, immediately S of the plot in which Ts. A-F had been found. The tomb was found by chance during the construction of a cesspit near the SE corner of the Koiladhi house. A 3.0 m2 pit was dug through a layer of hard red earth to the kouskouras bedrock, which appeared 1.20 below surface, sloping down fairly steeply to the SE, as though there may once have been a gully there. A cutting in the kouskouras, filled with the same hard red earth was then apparent on the E side of the pit. Sherds were found both above bedrock and in the fill of the cutting which, once removed, could be seen to be the fill above a collapsed chamber tomb. Near the top of the fill were some sherds and a piece of iron, fi (2.17 below surface) and a piece of worked marble, f2 (2.19 below). At c. 2.50 below surface (1.90 above chamber floor), the original fill of the chamber began to appear, with many sherds in the front part of the chamber. In the inner, S part the red earth fill continued to a layer of densely packed stones</page><page sequence="63">THE TEKE SITE T.Q. 45 perhaps used to help fill the hollow caused by the collapsed roof. Below the stone layer was the kouskouras roof fall, reaching down to the chamber floor in its S edge, but gradually rising towards the centre above the original chamber fill which seems to have spilled in from the dromos before the roof fell. The chamber floor was 4.40 below surface, and was eventually uncovered completely. The limits imposed by the cesspit allowed the stomion and a short section of the dromos to be investigated. By tunnelling into the N edge of the pit the S part of the side-chamber could be excavated; the risk of collapse prevented further work there. In both dromos and side-chamber there were two distinct strata, an upper layer of red earth, a lower of crumbled kouskouras, both containing much broken pottery. The relationship of the two strata was not immediately obvious. The fill in the stomion and front of the chamber resembled the upper dromos-ñ'l, but was slightly more mixed. Material from the looted tomb began to appear in the front part of the chamber, the stomion and the dromos 2.50 below the surface (1.90 above floor level). Lower in the fill (infra) two large fragments of the side of a LM III decorated larnax 116 were found stretching across the front of the stomion, dividing the lower, predominantly kouskouras fill of the dromos from the more mixed but predominantly red fill of the stomion and front of the chamber. On the S side of the dromos, near the stomion, was an O aryballos, 2, 0.99 above floor. Two small pieces of bronze £3, were near, 0.94 above, with another piece to the NW. At the same level, near the side-chamber entrance was a concentration of coarse pithos fragments. With them were £5, fragment of a zoomorphic askos, 114, 0.79 above floor, while f4, bronze pin, was 0.65 above. These finds appeared as though spilling out of the side-chamber. The lower dromos fill, behind the larnax fragments in the stomion was mainly crumbled kouskouras and a jumbled mass of sherds, including some of coarse pithoi. fu, piece of a bronze pin, was near the outer larnax fragment, 0.54 above the floor, and fi2, small terracotta bead, was in front of the side-chamber. Several small fragments of bronze seemed to have spilled out of the area of the side-chamber, as did much of the material in the dromos. A terracotta bead, fi3, was found 0.03 above floor on the N side of the dromos. The greatest concentration of sherds in the dromos was in the lowest part of the kouskouras fill, especially on the S side, near the side-chamber. Among the sherds were small flakes of bronze and a piece of a bronze pin, £14. The upper part of the looted chamber fill was mostly red earth with some patches of kouskouras and many stones of varying sizes (a large squared block was 0.42 X 0.40 X 0.30) probably from blocking walls. Throughout the fill in front of the chamber and stomion were many sherds and, frequently, small flakes of bronze. Some large fragments of pottery included the upturned base of a large O pithos-urn, 1, (1.53 above chamber floor), with two small pieces of bronze nearby. At this level some larnax fragments (supra, infra) began to appear. A large side piece was found fairly high in the fill in the front of the chamber. Also in the front, near the W wall, 0.70 above the floor, was 3, part of a coarse pithos-urn, other pieces of which were lower in the fill. Some pieces of burnt bone were in the same area. There were several pieces of burnt clay among the stone rubble in the same area and level, perhaps once used as rendering. Another shaped piece of burnt clay was found near 3. Slightly lower was a small piece of bronze, and a piece of blue glass -?R intrusion. More small bronze fragments were found close to the larnax fragment, in the stomion, reaching down almost to floor level. Here was also found the foot (fy) of a zoomorphic vessel, 0.10 above stomion floor (? part of 114) and, close S, part of a bronze pin, :P6. Beside the W wall of the chamber a small group of vases was found on the floor under some kouskouras that had presumably fallen from the roof before the tomb was robbed. These include an aryballos, 4, an amphora, 5, a jug, 6, a cup with a small oinochoe inside, 8, 9,</page><page sequence="64">46 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY with a jug stacked on top, 7. Under the cup was the foot of a zoomorphic vase resembling 114 {supra). On the kouskouras floor SE of the paved area {supra) was the foot of a zoomorphic vessel, with a crystal bead at the E edge. Seven more beads (f8) of the same shape but of different sizes were scattered over a 0.30 arc along the S chamber wall, evidently part of a necklace overlooked by the looters. A gold leaf-shaped ornament, fg, was found on the SE-most paving slab, a gold ring with plain bezel, fio, was just E of the arc of beads. As we have seen supra, the side chamber was partly excavated by tunnelling into the N face of the cess-pit. This followed the length of the S wall at its base, as well as a short stretch of its W return. The shelf cut 0.80 up in the S wall {supra) could not be followed far into the chamber. The deposit just above the shelf was essentially kouskouras with a mass of sherds that seemed to slope down into the dromos. Much of the side-chamber fill had to be left in situ, for it was dangerous to make too large a tunnel. At floor level in front of the chamber were two largish stones apparently slightly displaced from an original position in the blocking wall (the larger was 0.68 X 0.38 X 0.25). Behind, under and between were smaller packing stones - behind them was £15, iron fragment and fi6, ?part of a pin. Also in the front of the side-chamber were £17, iron knife fragment, and, just W of it, fi8, glass bead. Close to the last, the base of the larnax began to appear. Its NE narrow end, and part of the long side facing into the chamber had been broken off to use in blocking the stomion {supra). 1.34 long, 0.48 wide, it had been placed against the S wall. It had four legs. The fill over the larnax base was mostly crumbled kouskouras though there seemed slightly more red clay mixed with it in the area that had originally been the interior of the larnax. There was a fair amount of burnt bone in the fill as well as a few pieces of charcoal. Also two fragments of an iron pin (£21) and a pin head (£22), and several fragments of bronze, perhaps part of £19 {infra). Around the larnax the fill near floor level was redder and harder, as though well trodden. There were several fragments of bronze between the S wall and the larnax, and one large piece near its top was part of a shallow pan (£19) with its rim pressed against a recess cut in the chamber wall. io, a miniature jug, was found on the floor against the S wall of the chamber and the adjacent larnax foot. On lifting the base of the larnax, a number of miniature vessels appeared (mostly lying on their sides, where they had been undisturbed by looters). 11 and 12, aryballoi, were just in front of the larnax, with 21, miniature juglet, then (partly under the larnax) aryballoi 13, 15. Under the front part were 14 (kalathos), 16 (aryballos), 17 (cup), 18 (lekythos), 19-20, 22, 25 (aryballoi), 23 (miniature oinochoe) and 24 (kalathos). Under the central section were massed 26-27 (cups), 28-30, 32-33 (aryballoi), 31 (lekythos), while 34 (lekythos) was inside 35 (cup). Beneath 35 were bronze fragments perhaps part of fig {supra) and the leg of the zoomorphic askos 115. Other vessels were a juglet, 36, two miniature lekythoi, 37-38, aryballoi, 39-40, 42, a cup, 41, beneath which were a miniature aryballos, 46, inside a small conical cup, 45. Under the far section of the larnax base were a kalathos, 43, over a miniature aryballos, 47, a pyxis and lid, 44, and a bronze flake, perhaps from fig. There was a miniature aryballos, 48, near the N edge of the larnax and a vessel handle with a small hedgehog modelled on it, £245 W of £24 was a small terracotta bull, £25, and a small strainer- spouted jug, 49. To the S, in a small depression in the floor was the splendid hippalektryon vase 115, miniature jug mounted on its tail, small parts of which were found detached nearby. By the SE foot of the larnax was 50, miniature hydria. Between the larnax and the w wall was an amphora, 51, with a skyphos, 52, jammed in its mouth, possibly its cover. By the larnax's SW foot were 53, 56, aryballoi, 54, small skyphos, 55, lekythos, with f26, iron javelin head, above them (only part of which could be retrieved as it extended into the inaccessible part of the side-chamber fill).</page><page sequence="65">THE TEKE SITE T.Q. 47 POTTERY (PLATES 78-86) 1.

Such trials would determine if ancient remains were present, in which case more prolonged excavation would be necessary. At that time Jill Carington-Smith (University of Tasmania), held the appointment of 'Knossos Fellow'. Her wide responsibilities for attending to the School's interests at Knossos included conducting the rescue excavations undertaken by the School within the frame of reference outlined above. After the negotiations between the School and the Ephoria had been completed, and the decision taken that the School should undertake the work, Dr. Carington-Smith was continuously in charge in the field, except during those periods when the School's Director joined the excavation when, naturally, responsibility was shared. It was agreed between the School and the Ephoria, and through the Ephoria, with the University authority, that the costs of what was to prove a very long drawn out operation should be shared between the School, the Ephoria and the University. The School should undertake the expense of supervising the excavation and recording it, cleaning, conservation and study of the finds and of publication. The Ephoria paid for the labour force, while the University of Crete paid for the earth-moving equipment which was such an essential feature of this excavation. The work-force was under the supervision of the late Mr. Antonis Zidianakis, the School's Foreman of Excavations at Knossos. The workmen included a number of experienced men from Knossos, and others recruited from Herakleion and neighbouring villages. During the course of the excavation, which lasted from March until November 1978, the size of the labour force fluctuated considerably, but never exceeded 20 workmen on any one day. The first group of excavators who began work on March 20th found a large, relatively level field of some 25 stremmata in extent, very roughly 250 metres north- south, and a similar distance east-west. The field is raised well above the level of the Knossos-Herakleion highway, by which it is bordered on the west. The level falls away very slightly to the east, more noticeably towards the south, in the direction of the Venezeleion Hospital. To the south-east, south and south-west lies open country, of which the silhouette of Juktas is a conspicuous feature. Nearly a kilometre away to the south-south-west is the highest point of the modern village of Fortetsa, 80 metres above the level of the North Cemetery. Due south, a kilometre away, on the west side of Monastiraki Kephala (the ancient akropolis of Knossos) is the site of the main Fortetsa Dark Age cemetery excavated between 1933 and 1935 by N. Platon, H. G. G. Payne, A. Blakeway and J. K. Brock.9 Other Dark Age graves have been excavated much ()J. K. Brock, Fortetsa (1957).

The first step taken by the contractors had been to clear the site of its olive trees, largely by uprooting them with a bulldozer. The site, in consequence, was choked with the remains of these trees at the time that the first tests were being laid out and attempts made to excavate them, and the site grid was being established. The initial technique for exploring the site used extended but narrow trenches in an attempt to trap buried features and explore them piecemeal as they were discovered. This procedure met with limited success, but it soon became obvious that if the whole site was to be explored at all adequately before it was completely surrendered to the building contractors, a different approach was essential. Force majeure provided the solution. The contractors, having largely removed the remains of the olive trees - sometimes with the help of dynamite, to the considerable alarm of the excavators - began to strip off the relatively shallow layer of cultivated topsoil to expose the distinctive white surface of the undisturbed underlying kouskouras, a soft white marl of Pliocene age.11 This procedure quickly led to an accelerated rate of discovery of buried ancient features, largely consisting of the filled-up dromoi of chamber tombs, chambers of such tombs whose roofs had collapsed, or simple grave pits. It also became clear that part of the site included the very destroyed remains of a building complex, the date and purpose of which for some time remained in doubt. With the passage of time, topsoil was mechanically stripped from the greater part of the site. Unfortunately, the stripped soil was not immediately removed, and work during the central weeks of the excavation, late April to June, was made more difficult than it need have been through the presence of huge dumps of bulldozed soil covering areas where it was clear excavation would have to be undertaken. The contractor at first attempted to meet the excavators' appeals by moving the dumps by bulldozer from one part of the site to another. Wiser counsels eventually prevailed, so that a shuttle-service of lorries was provided into which dumped soil was loaded by JCB and removed from the site, allowing much larger areas of exposed kouskouras to be examined as a piece. As successive areas were cleared of topsoil and/ or dump, the surface of the kouskouras was carefully examined for traces of intrusive heads of soil. This usually necessitated skimming clean by hand the bulldozed surface of soil smears and tyre marks left by the machine and examining the heads of soil that remained, clearly visible by colour contrast against the white kouskouras matrix. In many cases, these heads of soil proved to be no more than small localized hollows in the kouskouras. In other cases, cleaning revealed the outline of filled grave-pits or dromoi, which were subsequently excavated systematically. Similar procedures led to the complete uncovering of the building complex mentioned above, which was identified as the almost wholly destroyed remains of a basilican church surrounded by an enclosure wall. With it was associated a number of built ossuaries, of which the most remarkable, T. 244, was nearly completely built of spolia from a monumental building of second century AD date, perhaps a mausoleum.12 Two other large, but shallow heads of soil were identified as the remains of rectangular huts of the 16th century AD. 10 KS'2, Sites 52, 53, 55 and 56 with references cited. 11 N.

Each one was excavated under the personal direction of a site supervisor, who kept the notebook record together with the register of finds. Groups were planned in situ by the supervisor at a scale of 1:20. In the case of large tomb groups, such planning had of necessity to be done piecemeal, so that cleaned material was not left in situ at the end of a working day. Mr. Smyth tied in every feature to the main site plan, a task made very difficult by site conditions, not least the constant, though inadvertent, removal of survey pins by bulldozer action. Precious objects were transferred without delay to the care of the Herakleion Museum. Other finds were taken at the end of each day to the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos. Here, the very large quantities of pottery were cleaned and shelved in readiness for subsequent study. Complete but broken vases were repaired as soon as possible by the late Mr. Petros Petrakis, Hon. M.B.E., the School's vase-mender. This stage of the excavation, during which the contractors, though present on the site, were not concerned with more than site clearance, but were waiting, sometimes a little impatiently, for the excavation to end, lasted until late June, 1978. By this point 211 tombs of all periods had been excavated, and the plan of the basilica and its enclosure wall recovered. Following the advice of Mr. A. H. S. Megaw, the remains of a large vaulted subterranean cistern had been found and excavated (largely mechanically) in the area of the atrium of the church. With the agreement of the Herakleion Ephoria, operations were brought to a close, and the large party assembled at Knossos for the operation, dispersed. The second stage, which lasted intermittently from July to November 1978, consisted of responses made by Dr. Carington- Smith and ad hoc teams of assistants to further discoveries made as the result of the first phase of construction work undertaken by the contractors, involving trimming the kouskouras surface at various points and, more importantly, the excavation of a complex of deep, broad sleeper trenches in readiness for laying the main concrete foundations of the university buildings. At times the pressure of work was intense, particularly during August and again in October, the latter when the northerly group of chamber tombs (Ts. 282, 285, 286, 292) was discovered. Nearly one hundred more graves were excavated during this second stage. Though a majority of the graves found in the second stage was of Hellenistic to Early Christian date, they included several very important Dark Age chamber tombs, T 219 with its exceptional finds and the untouched T. 285 among them. In brief, then, the North Cemetery site revealed an almost continuous history of use from the eleventh century BC, when the first Sub-Minoan burials were made, until at least the fifth century AD, the date suggested for the basilican church and its associated ossuaries. That long history had taken toll of, especially, the Dark Age tombs. In some parts of the site space available for burial was evidently so prized that many of the Hellenistic and Roman inhumation graves cut into dromoi or collapsed chambers of Dark Age tombs. Individual Dark Age tombs themselves had long histories of reuse, sometimes from Protogeometric to Orientalizing times. In some cases there seems to have been an interval between such use; T. 285's primary period of use was in Protogeometric A. It seems not to have been used again until Orientalizing. The eventual construction of the church and the associated ossuaries also contributed to the disturbance which the excavators found so clear a feature of the cemetery's history. In every case it was clear that the disturbance was ancient, and was the result of the repeated use to which the site was put. The last major disturbance was deduced to belong to Venetian times, when it seems that the site was pillaged of stone for the defences of Cândia, resulting in the disappearance of whatever remained of the ruined basilica and its enclosure</page><page sequence="74">56 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY wall, and any surviving tomb superstructures (in the case of Roman and Early Christian graves). The worst effects of disturbance were felt in the Dark Age chamber tombs, for which their own frequent reuse may well have been chiefly responsible. In extreme cases, the fills of both dromos and chamber were found replete with broken pottery that had once formed part either of the ash-urns or the burial gifts, one or two of which might still be intact, in situ, whether in the chamber itself, a side-chamber or (as in T. 75) high up in the dromos fill. In practical terms, this degree of disturbance meant that study of the contents of the worst affected tombs (the Ts. 34, 56, 57 complex; Ts. 75 and 107) was particularly laborious, requiring thousands of fragments of pottery to be spread out on the sorting tables at the Stratigraphical Museum, disiecta membra reassembled and passed to the vase-mender for his highly skilled attentions. Much the largest role in the conduct of the excavation was played by Dr. Jill Carington- Smith, Knossos Fellow, who was in charge in the field from beginning to end, sharing the charge with the Director of the School when he was present from early May to late June, and again in October. The School's Honorary Surveyor, Mr. David Smyth, made a very large contribution. As well as the very testing work of controlling the main site survey and constructing the site plan in the field, he was responsible for the final drawings of the cemetery plan and the individual tomb plans published here. Among the many individuals who contributed to the supervision of the excavation a conspicuous part was played by Dr. W. G. Cavanagh (at that time Macmillan Student) and Mrs. Anne Thomas. Other participants on the site included Miss M. Alden (at that time School Student), Mr. P. Avery, Mr. C. J. M. Catling, Mr. R. W. V. Catling, Mr. E. O'Donoghue, Dr. R. E. Jones (Director of the Fitch Laboratory), Mr. C. Macdonald, Dr. C. B. Mee (at that time Assistant Director), Mrs. E. Preston, the Hon. Mrs. C. Ridley, Miss J. Webb and Miss S. Young. For two days in August, to assist with an unexpected rush of discovery, Professor P. M. Warren (then directing the School excavation at the Stratigraphical Museum Extension site) transferred the whole of his excavation party to work in the North Cemetery. Among those who from time to time worked on the immediate care of the finds in the Stratigraphical Museum as they came in day by day from the excavation, Mrs. Elizabeth Catling played a leading role. Others who gave invaluable help included Miss M. Alden, Mrs. L. Cavanagh, Mrs. C. Mee and Miss C. Rees. The arduous and lengthy work of pottery washing was undertaken by Mrs. Eleni Petrakou. During the main period of activity in May and June, Mrs. Catling, assisted by Mrs. Cavanagh, also acted as hostess, housekeeper and cook for the excavation party resident at the Taverna, Knossos. H.

The tomb was identified before the removal of the olive grove, after a group of G sherds from large vessels had been noticed among the trees, probably brought to the surface by the plough. The fill of light golden-brown plough-soil contained modern as well as G material. As the result of agricultural activity the contents were in total confusion. These included i, EO lekythos and 2, LO aryballos. Sherds in the fill and on the floor came from a MG urn, three LG urns and three EO urns.

E chamber: 1.06 X 1.66. The main chamber was on the E side of the dromos, and another cutting, chamber-like in plan only, on the W, which could have been added after the main tomb was cut. The dromos sloped up from the E chamber at an angle of 8°. The stomion had been destroyed. There was a long and pronounced door-jamb on the N side, and a vestigial one on the S. The (e) chamber, whose flat floor was reached by a step, 0.26, was rectangular with rounded corners. The roof sloped up diagonally from the back, instead of being rounded. The floor was at least 1.40 below modern surface. The W 'chamber' was irregular, but rounded in plan, with small, though pronounced door-jambs. In its floor was a pit 0.52 X 0.44, up to 0.50 deep. The floor sloped down towards the dromos and the E chamber. Just outside the door-jambs was a slight, rounded drop to the dromos-ñoor proper. The tomb was one of four at the S limit of the area excavated in 1978. Its orientation was ESE-WSW. The tomb was found in the first trial trenches dug near T. 1. It had been robbed. There were no blocking stones. In the upper fill of the trial were fi (sealstone) and £2 (glass tessera). In the dromos were £3, two non-joining dirk fragments, and pieces of unburnt bone. The former probably and the latter certainly came from the chamber, where more unburnt bones, mostly limbs, were found, showing it had contained an inhumation, probably male, judging by the objects which accompanied it. The broken and scattered finds included 2 (SM stirrup-jar) fs 4-5, 8a (iron pins), fs 6-9 (fragments of the same iron spear), fio (Pits socket), fu (bronze pin fragments), fi2 (bone handle or sleeve), fi3, 14 (iron knife fragments). In the W chamber, set in the pit, was a coarse SM pithos, 1, found broken and scattered. Scraps of burnt bone in the pit indicate it had been a cremation.

Tomb 8 SW (figs. 5, 14) Estimated L. overall: 3.00. Dromos: L. 1.80. Chamber: estimated D. 1.26. Part of the E wall of the dromos and the S (back) wall of the chamber were found in a 1.00 wide trial. The dromos floor was flat for most of its length; the chamber floor was 0.20 lower - it had probably been circular. There were no step, door jambs, or blocking. The greatest preserved height of the walls was 0.32. The tomb was one of four found on the S-most limit of the area excavated in 1978. Its orientation was NW-SE, the chamber at the E end. The tomb appeared as a very shallow cutting in kouskouras, which lay c. 0.50 below surface. There were no recognizable finds; the pottery from the chamber is as likely to have come from the general plough soil as from the tomb. POTTERY (PLATE 88) i. FOUR-HANDLED PITHOS. PH. 12.

The existence of a DA tomb in the general vicinity of Ts. i, 2 and 8 was deduced from discovery of a ragged cutting in the kouskouras in trials excavated near T. i, designated here by Roman numerals. Here the kouskouras descended steeply w- or SW-wards in a series of irregular banks. The fill of the ragged cutting (pit-like feature), light yellowish-brown with many kouskouras lumps, seemed rather firm and stable, but this was belied by finds of unburnt (?HL) bone, and HL lamp fragment (VI. fi), part of a worked block with orange-pink plaster adhering, a bit of glass, three miniature pots (VI, i, 2; V/VI. 4), an aryballos (V. 1) and fragments of an iron knife (VI. fo).</page><page sequence="78">6o KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Below the kouskouras was an amphora-burial of an infant (T. 5). Somewhat above the bottom of the kouskouras, NW of T. 5, were remains of a coarse pithos (VI. 5) and pieces from another large, decorated pot. These two vessels were assigned to a conjectural T. 9 which must have been in the vicinity, whose outline was too much destroyed by later activity for it to be identified. In and near the base of the pithos was a mass of poorly or partially charred bone. Many of the pieces (teeth, fingers, skull fragments) seemed to have come from children. The aryballos [supra) may have come from this burial, as well as the iron knife and fragments of bronze among the pithos sherds (V/VI. fi) and an iron object (V/VI. fa). Tomb 13 SE (figs. 6, 14; plates 11 e-f, 12 a-b) L. overall: 4.80. Dromos: L. at least 3.50. W. 0.90-1.24. Stomion: 0.82 X 0.30. Chamber: 1.00 X 1.44; H. 0.85. The wedge-shaped dromos was not completely excavated; it rose 0.50 in vertical distance between the stomion and the excavated limit, at a mean gradient of 140. On the N side of the dromos was an irregular niche c. 1.00 X 1.00, its floor 0.85 above the adjacent dromos, 1.30 above the level of the chamber floor. On the S side was a cutting 1.50 X 0.80 whose shape and odd diagonal angle to the dromos make its identification uncertain; its orientation was that of the many HL tombs in the area. The stomion, from which all blocking stones had been removed, had an unusual raised threshold c. 0.40 wide, and distinct jambs. The small well-cut oval chamber was slightly off-centre, the floor strewn with fine gravel or coarse sand containing tiny water-worn stones. The floor was 1.52 below modern surface. The tomb was part of a rather irregular N-S line - Ts. 14-1 3-1 9-55 - in the crowded SE sector of the cemetery. Its orientation was ENE by N, WSW by S. The chamber was on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found during the mechanical clearance of 2.30 wide channels N-S and E-W on the 1 o-metre square system of the site grid. Its presence was observed when the machine touched the bronze bowl, 1, in the N niche. The tomb had been robbed in antiquity; the chamber contained no recognizable pots or objects, and few sherds. The blocking stones were found in the dromos. A pit containing brown earth had been dug into the upper part of the outer dromos fill. The HL inhumation graves Ts. 118 and 304 were at the NW end of the dromos and another, T. 114, had been dug through the chamber roof, explaining unburnt limb bones and HL sherds in the chamber fill, and the fact that the roof was only partly intact. The upper dromos fill contained R/ECh sherds. The lower fill, though lighter in colour and more stable, still had late tile fragments and a piece of R or Ch plaster. 8, a ?PGB aryballos, and fi, an iron arrowhead, were comparatively high in the fill, but the rest of the finds were on or near the dromos floor. They were in two groups, one c. 0.60-1.60 from the threshold, the other up against it; stones from the blocking wall were among them both. Three of the largest were in the first group, near the N wall. Between them were sherds of the PGB-EG pithos, 12, and lying amongst them in a manner which suggested they were associated were the fragments of an EG? skyphos 11 and an EG hydria, 14. Nearer the entrance were the EG kalathos-lid, 13, and the EG oinochoai 20, 23. Immediately S of 12 was 10, head and neck of a PGB bird askos. S of this, under some large sherds, was the broken EG oinochoe 18 and S again, near a stone close to the S dromos wall, was the almost complete LPG-PGB pyxis, 9. 0.30 E of 9 was 15, rim fragments of an EG pithos, and between them the EG lid, 17. In the NE corner of the dromos near the threshold were the remains of a PGB-EG pyxis, 24, a LPG lid, 25, and a PGB-EG oinochoe, 26. Very close was the EG oinochoe 23. In the SW corner</page><page sequence="79">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 13 61 were the sherds of the EG jug-aryballos 21. 11 and 14 may have been associated with 125 otherwise, the original vessel groupings are irrecoverable. The O interment in the N dromos niche included 1, the bronze bowl, 3, the base of a pithos (the urn) accompanied by a large aryballos, 2, a jug, 5, and two oinochoai, 4, 6. Their upper parts were anciently broken. The cremated bone still remaining in 3, or found near it belonged to an adolescent or young adult. Among them was a curious object of soft stone, drilled longitudinally and shaped like a champagne cork. The PG pithos base, 7, was just within the S niche, overhanging the dromos. 27-51 were reconstructed from sherds recovered during excavation, confirming the PGB-EG use of the tomb, and its abandonment until O. From these and the vases recorded in the tomb a dozen ash-urns hypothetically add up to as many interments in the tomb. POTTERY (PLATES 89-91) 1. BRONZE VESSEL: see f3. 2. ARYBALLOS (fig. 73).

It had an irregular nick jutting into its NE wall. The stomion had been destroyed; no stones remained of the blocking wall. The chamber was roughly rectangular; its roof had collapsed. The rear wall survived to a height of 0.44; the floor was c. 1.25 below modern ground surface. A niche, of rounded plan, 0.64 X 0.42, H. preserved 0.20, its floor up to 0.50 above dromos surface, was cut into the S side of the dromos. The tomb was immediately S of T. 219 and parallel to it. The S circuit of the perimeter wall of the mortuary church passed between the two graves. This pair of tombs was somewhat isolated from the main groups of chamber tombs, rather to the N of the most congested part of the necropolis. The orientation was E by S- W by N. The destroyed stomion, as well as the presence of pottery in the dromos, including two cremation pithoi, suggested the tomb had been pillaged in antiquity. The topsoil was found very disturbed, with a mixture of G and later sherds, scattered fragments of bone, pieces of tile and marble tesserae, fi (bronze fragments), Í2 (clay pipe), a brick with traces of slag and an equid scapula were also found. In the dromos, the lower fill comprised a lighter yellow earth in which were found 2 and 5 + 50 (LG-EO cremation pithoi), a miniature cup, 1 = £3, a griffin protome from an EO polychrome lid, 3, a bird askos, 4, as well as sherds and burnt bones. A deposit of light brown soil 0.08 thick, had accumulated over the collapsed chamber fill. Inside, finds were set in a hard kouskouras roof- fall, suggesting the chamber had been ransacked before the roof collapsed. No clear order was observed in the arrangement of the contents. These were arbitrarily divided into four groups - group 1, in the NW corner, consisted of 14, a polychrome pithos, partly overlying 24, a LG skyphos, 33, a griffin protome, and 31 , base of a vase. Immediately N was a domed lid, 28. Group 2, in the s corner, included 6, 12, aryballoi, 11, a hydria, 13, a kotyle, and £4, 7, fragments of an iron blade. At the chamber centre was group 3: 8, a bull's head protome from a polychrome lid and 23, a small conical lid. In the N quarter, group 4, were 9, 17, two cups. 7, base of a cremation pithos, 15, a polychrome lid with a lekythos, 30, inside it, 26, 27, 29, aryballoi. Under 27 was half a domed lid, 32, of which another part was under the domed lid 28. Nearby were £5, chlorite spindle whorl, £8, 9, 10, two glass beads and one yellow bead. Group 5 was in the E corner, including 20, a lekanis containing 19, a skyphos, with 2i5 a domed lid, behind it. In front of 20 were 18, a lekythos, and £6, a serpentine bead. There were also two small vessels, 10, 25 and a bovid tooth. Thus, two cremation pithoi, 2, 5 + 50, came from the dromos, a third in the chamber close to the SW wall, 14 and a fourth, 16, in the centre of the chamber. Group 1 and perhaps group 2 might be associated with 14; other associations were even less secure. The dromos niche was found empty, without blocking. It is unknown how or when it was used.</page><page sequence="82">64 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY POTTERY (PLATES 92-3) 1. *MINIATURE CUP. DR. 3.2. Fr. of body with lip. Trace ofline below lip.

Chamber: 1.30 X 1.20. The sides of the dromos, which sloped slightly inwards towards the top, were unevenly cut. The dromos floor rose 0.52 in vertical distance at an angle of 130 to a step 0.20 deep. The ill- defined stomion was sealed by two rectangular limestone slabs side-by-side, apparently in situ, of which one was 0.42 long, 0.50 high, 0.12 thick. The chamber floor was 0.45 below the dromos floor. The chamber was irregular in plan, with curving E and S walls, straight W wall. The back (s) wall rose in a curve to form the partly preserved roof. The floor was at least 1.25 below modern surface. The tomb was on the SE limit of the area excavated in 1978, on approximately the same W-E line, and with similar unusual SSE-NNW orientation as Ts. 106, 26, 40, 112 and, some way further E, 18. All alike were opened early in the life of the cemetery. The chamber was on the S side of the dromos. The tomb was found undamaged during mechanical clearance of a N- S channel 2.30 wide in the site grid of 10.00 squares. Though much of the roof had fallen, intact blocking slabs and undisturbed dromos fill suggest it was not pillaged. There were virtually no sherds in the stable dromos fill. The chamber was filled by roof-fall, high in which, just behind the blocking stones were 1, a miniature cup, and fi, iron knife fragment, which may not have belonged to the tomb. 0.25 above the floor, in the roof fall, was 2, another cup. Near the back wall were unburnt bones - part of an adult skull to W, limbs to the E and, among the latter, pieces of an infant's skull. Immediately N of what would have been the corpse's hip were a SM stirrup jar, 3 and £2, steatite button. NE of these was a hole in the tomb floor, D. c. 0.15 (cf. T. i). POTTERY (PLATE 94) 1.

Tombs 18, 28, 31, 63, 69 INTRODUCTION This confused complex was first noted at an early stage of the excavation, during general mechanical cleaning in the vicinity; further mechanical cleaning was undertaken as more and more tombs appeared. An area c. 5.00 X 5.00 was originally named T. 18', but proved to contain many tombs - two chamber tombs, Ts. 18 and 28, a ?pit burial, T. 63, a pithos burial</page><page sequence="85">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 16, 18 67 in 18. 8, a larnax burial, T. 31 (= 18. 11), possibly another in 18.15, the ill-defined T. 69, the HL graves T. 62 and T. 204 and, to the E, the HL/R T. 32. Ts. 28, 63, 69 and 204 had their finds individually numbered; the objects belonging to the others were all assigned to T. 18'. The two dominant features in the area were Ts. 28 and 18, the E-most of a line of very early tombs strung W-E across the S of the cemetery. The others (w-E) were 8(?), 2, 200-202, 98 + 106, 26, 40, 112 and 16. There was a 14.00 gap between 16 and 28. All these early chamber tombs were orientated approximately N- S. Except 28, all had chambers to the S, and the effect given in plan is that they were following a lightly curved hill contour to the S, since vanished. T 28 was exceptional in having its chamber at the N end; its dromos was parallel with T. 18's, 1.40 apart. The area between the two dromoi was partly closed off to the N by T 28's chamber, and, to the S, by T. 18's chamber in the E and T. 28's Niche 3 in the W, the HL grave T. 204 spanning the two. A sort of island of kouskouras was thus formed between the two tombs. In the W of this island, parallel to T. 28's dromos, with its N end on a line with T. 28's blocking stone, was a larnax, T. 31, containing a LG-EO interment. E of this was the HL T. 62, whose E edge virtually coincided with the W edge of T 18's dromos. A late cutting ran across T. 18's dromos, at right angles, its N edge c. 1.40 from T. 18's stomion, its S edge unclear. Its disturbed brown fill contained remains of all periods, including R glass. The cutting was followed for c. 2.30 SE from T. 18's dromos, where it encountered the HL/R T. 32. 1.00 E of T. 62, above the dromos of T. 18, were pieces of a larnax (18.15) perhaps part of T. 31. Some 0.25 S, above T. 18's E door jamb and blocking wall was an EG pithos-interment (18.8). T 69 was an ill-defined feature, perhaps once a chamber tomb, that cut obliquely across the S half of T. 28's dromos; at its end were traces of an HL grave (unnumbered). Tomb 18 S (figs. 6, 16; plate 12 e-g) See Introduction to Ts. i8, 28, 31, 63, 69. L. overall: 5.45 (at least). Dromos: 4.40 (at least). W. 1.00. Stomion: minimum W. 0.70. L. - rudimentary. Chamber: 1.30 X 1.70. The dromos had straight parallel sides. It rose 1.60 in vertical distance from the stomion to its excavated limit. For 0.60 from the stomion it rose at a mean angle of 40o, thereafter at 20o. The blocking, c. 0.80 wide, was found in situ; its major element was a large, possibly worked limestone slab (0.40 X 0.40 X 0.20). E of this, four medium sized unworked stones were set one upon another, the top one fallen slightly inwards. E again was a narrow gap (perhaps once filled by a flattish stone found in the chamber). Beyond was a large irregular block (0.35 X 0.20 X 0.14). The uprights rested on a flat foundation course of three stones, necessary to counteract the sharp slope down into the chamber. The stomion was rudimentary and the door jambs ill-defined, possibly because of the crumbly state of the kouskouras. The chamber was oval, its greatest diameter at right angles to the dromos. Much of the low, rounded roof was preserved, to a maximum height of 0.75. The tomb, in the SE sector, closely juxtaposed to T. 28, was furthest E of any in the area of the cemetery dug in 1978. Its orientation of S by E, N by W, chamber to the S of the dromos, is unusual for the site. The tomb was found after mechanical cleaning (see Introduction, supra). Though the upper part of the dromos fill over the stomion had been cut to insert the EG pithos-interment 8 (infra) this in practice provided an additional seal, for it would have been difficult to effect entry without removing the pithos. The late cutting (Introduction, supra) did not reach the dromos floor, and its undisturbed fill suggested the tomb had not been entered.</page><page sequence="86">68 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY In the dromos, above the E part of the blocking wall, was a broken but complete pithos, 85 on its side, c. 1.50 above the chamber floor, orientated N-S, its mouth towards the S. 9, a small PGB cup lay just beyond its mouth; another, 14, was beneath it. Just within its mouth was a coarse E-MG basin, 13, within which was a juglet, 12. It is likely that the EG pots 27 (jug- aryballos) and 34 (miniature) from the pottery baskets were associated with it. This was clearly an interment, though no bones were found in 8; indeed, burnt bone found in its vicinity after its removal may have been spilled from it. The amber beads f6- 85 probably all from one necklace, were from an area 0.14 and 0.30 to the side of the pithos rim, well above the blocking stones. Mixed with them were patches of black-stained earth, and there were burnt bones in the vicinity. It is very probable that they had been part of the interment in 8. 15 was a collection of disordered larnax sherds, perhaps once a larnax interment. A corner piece was found in hard yellow earth, in the E part of the dromos, 0.2 N of the pithos interment, 8, and at the same level as the larnax interment, T. 31, 1.40 away, in the island of kouskouras between the dromoi of Ts. 18 and 28. 'Undistinguished, unburnt3 bones lay W of, and underneath these larnax sherds. Though the HL T. 62 intervenes between 15 and the larnax interment T. 31, it is unlikely, in fact, that 15 could be part of T. 31 detached when T. 62 was dug. Elsewhere in the dromos fill was £5, part of an iron knife, 0.80 from the blocking wall, possibly from the fill of the late cutting, or to be associated with the larnax, 15. The gold-mounted rose amethyst gem, £3, was found before Ts. 18 and 28 had been defined; subsequent study showed it lay just inside the W wall of T. 18's dromos' it was 0.90 from the larnax T. 31, 0.70 from the pithos interment in 8, and 0.50 from the larnax sherds 15. With it were a few crumbs of an 'amber' bead; beneath it were some pieces of bone. It is associable either with the pithos 8 or the larnax 15. The chamber, filled with fallen kouskouras, contained two poorly preserved inhumations. The later burial (2), possibly a young adult, but of unknown sex, its head to W, may have lain at full length across the tomb; some limb bones were beneath the SM neck-handled amphora, 18, which was rather E of centre. A SM stirrup jar, 19, just within the W door-jamb, must have belonged to it. A stone, perhaps fallen inward from the blocking, lay between 18 and 19. The earlier burial (1) - perhaps a young, lightly-built adult, perhaps male - lay at a slightly lower level than (2) with the skull in the SW, some limb bones to the SE. The position of the bones suggest either this was a contracted burial, or it had been pushed aside by the later burial party. The only gift was the SM stirrup jar, 20, lying between skull and legs. The bone report also refers to cremated bone from this tomb, including a partly burnt hand. An equid tooth, found in the depth of the chamber, seemed to be associated with the earlier burial.

W. 0.54-0.93. Stomion: W. 0.58. Depth: 0.14. Chamber: 1.50 X 1.30 max. H. 0.85. Two ill-defined steps led down to the short dromos, at a mean angle of 54o. The dromos was narrow at its end, widening towards the stomion. The dromos floor itself rose at an angle of 30; it was separated from the stomion by a shallow hollow, 0.25 deep, as wide as the stomion] on the floor of the hollow, just outside the door jambs, a rectangular stone c. 0.32 X 0.26 X 0.12, was placed as a step. The N door jamb was well defined, rectangular; the S jamb was irregular, perhaps eroded. Though there was no regular blocking wall, a mass of what appeared to be fallen, unworked stones was found immediately below surface at the E end of the dromos. Beneath them were others, fewer but larger, still in no apparent order; below again were four more, unworked, laid in an approximate line just outside the stomion, above the entrance step. These stones, which began c. 0.20 above the top of the entrance, must have been a very rough but apparently effective blocking. The chamber was almost square, but had rounded corners, and a convex N side. Its roof was largely intact. Its floor (at least 1.10 below modern surface) was strewn with a film of mud mixed with small, fine pebbles, among which was set, towards the back, a flat limestone block 0.30 X 0.32 X 0.12, presumably a pot-stand. The tomb lay within the N- S group 14- 13- 19 and, probably, 55, on the SE side of the area of the cemetery excavated in 1978. Its orientation was ENE-WSW, with the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found during the mechanical cutting of the site grid. The chamber's contents were almost intact. The upper part of the dromos fill contained a handful of 'completely uninformative, unburnt' bones; a little lower was fi, a tile with ?dog's footprint. There were many sherds in the fill and, near the W end, just above the floor, a patch of carbonized earth and burnt bone. All this gave the impression the tomb had been robbed. Just within the chamber, somewhat higher than the level of the stone step were, in a neat line, 2, a LG lekythos, i, an EO oinochoe and 3, an EO cup, all complete. Below were the EO olpe, 4, and the LG-EO jug, 65 just behind was a large EO skyphos, 5. These pots could have been contemporary with 7, the latest ash-urn {infra). The juxtaposition of the six vases - three for pouring, three for drinking - suggest a last drinking or pouring rite before the final closure of the tomb. Further inside was a series of four ash-urns, lying on their sides, and various smaller pots. Nearly all were complete, and apparently broken merely by roof-fall. The earliest interment was in the LG pithos 12, just N of the stone stand, on which it may originally have stood. Its cover was probably the LG/EO lid 27, between its mouth and the stand. Inside, with the burnt bones probably of an adult, were the LG lekythoi 20, 21 and small pyxis 22. Possibly also assignable to this group are the LG aryballos 26 (beneath 12), the LG-EO cup, 15 (at its foot), the LG cup, 23, the LG-EO lid 16 + 18 (16 was partly under the foot of 13, 18 was N of 12) and (made up of sherds) the LG lekythos 29. S of 12 was the pithos 13, in a more central, visible position, and therefore perhaps earlier than 14 (infra). Inside 13 were the LG lekythos 19, and the bones of an adult, perhaps middle aged, possibly female, together with scraps of animal bone. The EO lekane, 28, nearer the wall, may have been 13's cover. An EO oinochoe, 17, between 13 and 12 (overlying 12's cup, 23) may have accompanied it. 14, the rather small EO pithos tucked away in the NW corner, had the broken EO lid 24 inside it and another, 25, between its mouth and wall. It also contained Í5, a flat clay spindle whorl, and the bones of a not too young adult.</page><page sequence="89">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 19 yl 7, the EO pithos nearest the entrance, contained the tomb's last cremation, as indicated by the LO aryballos 11, found inside it. The cremation was of an adult male, with a small quantity of bones probably from animals including, most remarkably, a burnt fragment of a horse's pelvis. Also in 7 were the EO aryballos, 9, fs 25 3 (bronze mountings), £4 (iron bracelet) and four olive pips. 7's mouth was sealed by the LG lid 10, set in it upside down. At its foot, as though associated with it, was the EO cup, 8. POTTERY (PLATES 95-7) 1. OINOCHOE. H. 21.8. Gaps in wall. Grouped lines on neck and body, triple circles on shoulder. E 154, classi E.

Stomion: 0.75 wide, 0.30 deep, c. 0.97 high. Chamber: 1.66 X 2.10 , 1.38 high. The relatively long dromos changed direction by 70 1.85 from the stomion, at the level of an ill- defined, shallow step. The rise between stomion and step was io°, beyond the step, 150. The jambs of the stomion were 0.24 and 0.13 wide respectively. None of the blocking was in situ; stones from it were found in front of the stomion for up to 1.00 into the dromos. A step 0.20 led down into the roughly oval chamber, its back wall slightly flattened, the roof (which survived) domed. There was a niche, elliptical in plan, 0.88 X 0.56, 0.59 wide at the mouth, its floor up to 0.80 above the dromos surface cut into the N dromos wall some 2.00 from the stomion. The tomb was in the centre of a group of five DA chamber tombs (30, 45, 24, 25, 56) with parallel dromoi, chambers on the E, S of the SW angle of the enclosure wall of the mortuary church. Its orientation was E by S, W by N. The tomb was found after mechanical topsoil stripping and subsequent hand cleaning,</page><page sequence="91">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 19, 24 73 when it appeared as a head of dark soil within its kouskouras matrix. The character of the dromos fill, as well as the displaced blocking wall showed the dromos had been thoroughly robbed down to its floor. The dromos fill was a consistent brown earth containing a mixture of G, HL and R sherds; no trace of the original fill was found. Near surface, close to the entrance, was fi (bronze fibula bow); nearer the S dromos wall was £2 (iron obelos fr.), i5 an A cup, was 2.00 from the stomion. Bones, some of them burnt, and shells were also found, but were probably unassociated with the tomb's original contents. £3, a small worked stone, is probably also of later date. Fragments of R plaster found in clearing the displaced stones from the blocking confirmed the late robbing. Among these stones were pithos fragments, a stone mortar, £5, a stone basin, f6, a fragment of glass, £j and an iron dagger-hilt, f*j. The chamber roof was removed mechanically in view of its unstable condition. The remains of a tightly flexed skeleton were found on the floor, the skull (slightly raised) near the N jamb of the stomion, the legs doubled and parallel to the rear wall. Beside the feet, against the wall, was 3, a SM/EPG neck-handled amphora standing upright with 2, a SM/EPG stirrup jar, in its mouth. The dromos niche was found without blocking, filled with the same material as the dromos. There were no finds. Thus, this was a SM/EPG chamber tomb, probably used once only for a single inhumation, the dromos and stomion pillaged in R or Ch times. POTTERY (PLATE 98) 1. *IONIAN CUP (fig. 77).

The dromos, with parallel sides as far as excavated, sloped upwards at an angle of 120. The much damaged stomion led by two steps down (0.60) into the oval chamber, its long axis at right angles to the stomion. The chamber floor was 1.80 below modern surface. The tomb lay in the middle of a group cut parallel and close to each other (from N-S: Ts. 30, 45, 24, 25 and 56). Ts. 34/57 seem to have been late insertions in the series (between 25 and 26). The orientation was E-W, with the chamber in the E side. The tomb was found as a head of dark soil contrasting with the white kouskouras matrix following mechanical clearance of topsoil. It had been very thoroughly pillaged; the stomion had been largely destroyed, and no blocking remained in situ. None of the few remaining contents can have been in place. The disturbed dromos fill was removed as level 1 (three baskets of pottery); part of it was cleared by machine. Some rubble and one or two larger stone blocks (largest 0.60 X 0.27 X 0.24) in the fill near the stomion may once have belonged to the blocking wall. Finds included several groups of shapeless bronze fragments (fi, 3, 5, 7 and 9). A scrap of glass, f2, is a sign of late disturbance. At the w end was 1, perhaps the knob of an O polychrome lid. The chamber fill was excavated as level 2 (three baskets of pottery). A few fragments of human bone (including scraps of skull) suggest an inhumation. This could have been accompanied by 3, a large, fragmentary SM/EPG neck-handled amphora. fi3, a bronze fibula fragment, may be as early. EPG use of the tomb is implicit in the cup, 2, and the vase, 4. O fragments may have intruded after T. 34?s chamber cut into the dromos. Also in the chamber was a bronze pin, fio, and a scrap of sheet bronze, fi2. POTTERY (PLATE 98) 1. *MINIATURE JUG. H. 5.5. Traces of white slip. Perhaps the knob of a polychrome lid. O. 2.

The original forms of this unusual complex are uncertain. It comprised two separate graves, the later a roughly trapezoidal 'chamber' with an apparent opening eccentrically located, a small niche enlarging and distorting its N angle, with no sign either of blocking in the opening or dromos beyond it. This overlay an earlier grave of unusual type, consisting of an ovoid cutting in stereo 1.50 X 1.10, at opposite ends of which were two pits. Pit 1, on the S, was 0.47 X 0.28, 0.11 deep; Pit 2, on the N (just within the E jamb of the entrance opening) 0.80 X 0.61, 0.37 deep, with, cut into its floor, a bag-shaped hole 0.28 X 0.27, 0.30 deep. The tomb was between the chambers of Ts. 40 and 106, closer to the latter, on the SE side of the most congested part of the cemetery; it could also be seen as part of the NE-SW line made up of Ts. 16, 112, 26. Uncertainty over the tomb's form makes its orientation equally uncertain. The tomb was found in an area much confused by excessive use. The HL/R inhumation graves Ts. 27 and 29 were cut into the area where a SE-NW dromos would have been had one, indeed, existed. No traces of roof remained for the 'chamber'. Pottery of all periods was found in the topsoil in the area of the grave. The underlying grave contained several skull burials and a poorly preserved semi-articulated skeleton, perhaps the final burial. These are probably of SM date. In Pit 1 {supra) were two skulls and a femur. A SM bronze finger-ring, fi, was found beside one of the skulls, a plain bronze ring, £2, beneath it. Under the second skull was a SM/PG bronze dress-pin, f$. There was a third skull on the floor of the grave, between the two pits. In the hole at the bottom of Pit 2 was a bone, while, on the floor of the pit were various long bones that could not be attributed to a particular skull. Over Pit 2 was a fourth skull, to which belonged clavicle, ribs and hands, a skeleton laid on its right side with the spine parallel to the E wall of the grave. The legs may have curved</page><page sequence="94">76 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY round to lie parallel with the S wall, but it is far from clear which if any of these bones belong with the fourth skeleton. The later use of the tomb was reached almost immediately below topsoil, where objects were found on a kouskouras floor, possibly the collapsed roof of the underlying SM complex. At the back of the 'chamber' were several small vases - i, a lekythos, 2, a jug and 3, a strainer, all in the SW corner. In the SE corner were 4, 5, aryballoi and 6, pyxis. Of two cremation pithoi, 13, i6, only sherds remained. Close to the NE corner (resting on one of the crania of the lower burial) was the crushed O cremation pithos, 7. Four vases were on its shoulder - aryballoi 8-10 and alabastron 11, with a skyphos, 12, beside it. In the urn were a silver pin, Í5, a lion's head pendant, fl6, a gold cap, f7, a steatite and a faience bead, f8, 9, a bronze pin, fio and fragments of bronze, fu, 12, 13. POTTERY (PLATE 99) 1.

W. 1.20. Stomion: 1.00 w, up to 0.32 deep. Chamber: 2.00 X 1.30. Max. H. 0.82. Where the dromos sides were unaffected by later intrusions, the edges were cut straight and parallel. So far as excavated, the dromos rose 1.16 in vertical distance at mean angle of 180, except immediately in front of the stomion, where the angle was 28o. The short stomion was marked by small, irregular door jambs. The entrance was blocked by a single dressed slab, in situ, 1. 16 X 0.55 X 0.13, unusual in being wider than it was high. The well-cut chamber was an almost regular oval in plan. The roof curved up evenly from back wall, and was highest at the stomion. The chamber floor was 2.20 below modern surface. There was a niche ('Cupboard 3') on the E side of the dromos, 0.82 wide, estimated depth 0.60. with its blocking stone still in place. The niche floor was 0.28-0.18 above dromos floor. The tomb was at the E end of the line of early tombs 106-26-40-1 12-28-18 across the S end of the site, approximately sharing their orientation (n by W, S by e) with the important difference that this tomb's chamber was on the N side of the dromos, not the S. The tomb was found after mechanical clearing of topsoil (see Introduction, supra). Though the chamber seemed relatively undisturbed (infra), the dromos was confused by the intrusion of T. 69 (q.v.) into the SW side, and the insertion of the interment T. 63 into the upper part of the dromos fill, near its N end. The niche was confused by what was subsequently recognized as the HL T. 204. The chamber was disturbed by roof-fall, but seemed unrobbed. The dromos fill between the niche and the chamber contained no sherds. Against the E wall, each side of the niche's blocking stone, were the O pots 1, 2; 1, to the N was a coarse pyxis, 2, S, was a coarse pithos, unfired, in wretched condition. S of it was 3, an O miniature aryballos. Just below surface, in the vicinity of 2 and 3, were a few burnt bone scraps and fi, pieces of R</page><page sequence="96">78 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY green glass. This may have been an O interment, with 2 the ash-urn. In the chamber there had been at least one inhumation (thick skull fragments and limb bones) in the W and a cremation (burnt bones, perhaps of an adult and a child) near the broken coarse pithos 5, near the entrance, without demarcation between the two groups. The LPG amphora, 12, lay beside the inhumation with the bell-skyphos 15, beside its neck. At its foot were the PGB pyxis 16 and another bell-skyphos, 17. Next 12, in the centre of the chamber, was the crushed PGB bell-krater 11, on its side, with the LPG-PGB bell-skyphos, 13, inside. Two LPG-PGB bell- skyphoi, 6, 7, were SE of 11. (All the bell-skyphoi might once have been inside the krater - cf. T 285.82.) w of 11, N of 6, 7, was the pyxis lid, 14. 8, a PGB oinochoe, and 4, a PGB cup, were on either side of the LPG-PGB pithos, 5, just within the entrance. In the SE, near the wall, were f6, an iron dirk with wooden hiltplates and bronze rivets, and two iron spearheads f7, 8. In the niche were 9, a very fragmentary PGB pithos containing cremated bone and 10, LPG cup; fio, an iron dirk, was on the N side. There, too, were bronze studs, f2, 3, which may have come from the LPG burial. POTTERY (PLATE 100) 1. COARSE PYXIS. H. 19.5. Gritty buff clay.

The dromos, whose line was rather irregularly cut, sloped upward in two stages, first at 140 for a distance of 3.40 from the chamber where it reached a step c. 25 high, marked by a line of small, flat stones set on edge at the top. The second stage continued at 6° for another 2.0 before levelling. A line of slabs in two courses, roughly 0.40 high, 0.90 long, 0.60 wide marked the approximate position of the destroyed stomion. The largest slab was 0.60 X 0.30 X 0.10. There was a step 0.35-0.40 deep into the oval chamber, its long axis at right angles to the dromos. Its floor was 2.0 below modern surface. The tomb was at the N end of the group of Ts. 30, 45, 24, 25 and 56, into which Ts. 34/57 subsequently intruded. The orientation was E-w, with the chamber on the E side. The tomb was found after mechanical topsoil stripping as a head of dark soil contrasting with the white kouskouras matrix. It had been pillaged, the roof destroyed and the chamber emptied from the top, after which it was back-filled no earlier than R times, perhaps during building operations when the partly silted hole was a convenient dump for debris. The dromos fill of soft brown soil (level 1, four pottery baskets; level 2, three baskets) was not distinguishable from the top level of chamber fill (level i-one basket). At the w end of the dromos were i, a skyphos and 2, a small jug, both O. The large coarse tray, 3, came from the W end of the E half. In the chamber, level 3 (two baskets) was chiefly rubble, among which were scraps of glass and R tile. The brown soil and kouskouras underlying this (level 4, four baskets) rather surprisingly contained the complete PG neck-handled amphora, 4, as well as more R tile and glass. 4 lay on level 6 (two baskets), fairly clean fallen kouskouras. The tomb's history can only be dimly discerned. It may have been opened in EPG and continued in use until at least O times. The slovenly resetting of the stomion blocking perhaps belongs to its final use. The purpose of the division in the dromos is not clear, though it might be the result of recutting (and therefore enlarging) the dromos during reuse, or of digging out only a part of the dromos, also in reuse.</page><page sequence="98">8o KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY POTTERY (PLATE 101) 1. *SKYPHOS.

The orientation was nearly the same as T. 28's (n by W, S by e) The larnax was found under the same circumstances as Ts. 18 and 28 (Introduction, supra). It was incomplete; the SW corner and W side and S end were preserved to about half their probable original height. The SE corner was broken, but its pieces were scattered nearby. Only a very small proportion of the E side was preserved, and the N end was missing entirely. The floor was virtually complete. It had been rifled, possibly by the diggers of HL T 62 almost parallel with it, between it and T 18, reaching within 0.10 of its SE corner. The larnax was empty. The earth below it was burnt in places, particularly under the SW corner, where i6, an Attic LG Ha skyphos, and 17, a LG cup, were found, indicating the date of use.

They also illustrate only too clearly the extent of disturbance sometimes caused by HL/R grave-digging among the DA tombs, followed in many cases by still further damage at the building, use and destruction of the mortuary church. The difficulty of elucidating the sequence of events was aggravated by the chance of excavation. When work began on T. 34, topsoil had not yet been stripped from the surrounding area, and the presence of Ts. 56 and 57 was unsuspected. Recognition of the existence of these two tombs grew only slowly, since the architecture of all three had suffered so much damage (see description of individual tombs). Particularly harmful had been a large robbing pit which destroyed part of the N dromos wall of T. 56, the SW angle of T. 34's dromos and part of T. 57's dromos. What was in fact part of the dromos of T. 57 was for a time believed to be a side-chamber of T. 34, while part of the dromos of T. 57 was, almost inevitably, dug as though it was part of T 34's dromos. It has already been noted that T. 34's chamber cut into T 25's dromos, and this was for a time misinterpreted as a dromos niche belonging to T. 25. The construction sequence seems clear. Ts. 25 and 56 are part of the N-S rank of tombs 30-45-24-25-56. So far as horizontal stratigraphy is concerned none of these has necessarily to be earlier or later than another. T. 34 was intended to fit exactly into the space between Ts. 25 and 56, but a slight error in alignment brought its axis too far to the N and led to its intrusion into T. 25. Then, it seems, a need was felt for another tomb that had to be in the immediate neighbourhood. Either the need could not be satisfied by cutting cupboards or niches in existing tombs, or it was feared that such additions would damage adjacent tombs. So a new tomb, 57, nearly the same size as T. 34, was cut almost on the reverse axis of T 34, so that the E end of its dromos overlapped the W end of T. 34's dromos. All three tombs had been thoroughly pillaged, and their structure severely damaged. Fragments of the same vases were frequently found in more than one of the tombs, suggesting (though not proving) that all three were pillaged simultaneously. Inevitably, this factor has led to some arbitrary allocations of vases to one or other of the three tombs. Some ascriptions made at the time of excavation were found to need correction after post- excavation study. Thus, 25.3 and £15-20 belonged in fact to T. 34; 34.17, 19-33 and £40-64 belonged to T. 56; and 56. £4-9 belonged to T. 57. Tomb 34 sw (figs. 5, 19-20; plate 16 d-f) (See Introduction: Ts. 34, 56, 57) L. overall: 2.56. Dromos: L. 1.20 W. 0.52-^. 0.70. Stomion: none remained. Chamber: 2.0 X The unusually narrow dromos apparently broadened from the (missing) stomion towards its mouth, but the detail has been removed by cutting the dromos of T. 57. Near the chamber the dromos sloped upwards at c. io°. The chamber walls either side of the entrance, straight at first, then formed a continuous curve with the back wall. The latter was preserved c. 1.0 high. The chamber floor was 2.10 below modern surface. The tomb had been inserted between Ts. 25 and 56 in the N-S group 30-45-24-25-56. The orientation was E-W, with the chamber on the E side.</page><page sequence="101">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 34 83 The tomb gradually came to light during excavation of T. 25 (q.v.) when what proved to be its chamber was at first misidentified as a dromos niche belonging to T. 25. It was ultimately realised that its dromos overlapped the dromos of T. 57 which had been constructed 'back-to- back5. Much damage had been caused by the large robbing pit which also affected Ts. 56 and 57- The dromos fill was excavated as layers 1 and 2 (one basket each), though these were identical with the chamber fill in view of the numerous cross-joins between the two areas. Many fragments of 18 (large E Greek Wild Goat dinos) were found as well as a bronze pin, f35, several groups of fragments of bronze sheet, £31, 33-34, faience, £36 and an iron fragment, £38. A hint of the date of one of the disturbances, at least, came from fragments of glass, f32, 37 and a small piece of marble revetment, £39. At the outset, the chamber fill had been dug as T. 25, layer 3 (four baskets), a mixture of brown soil, powdered kouskouras and broken pottery. 25.3 (SM neck-handled amphora) was found in many fragments, followed by 2 (LO one-handled dish), 3-5 (LO polychrome pithoi), 6-7 (LO cups) and 8 = £40 (faience phiale mesomphalos). Other finds in what was in fact the N part of the T. 34's chamber were fi5 (fragments of bronze sheet), fi7 (part of a small polychrome larnax, the rest of which came from T. 56 (15)), fi8 (rock-crystal bead), fi9 (fragments of bronze sheet), f22 (roundel of kouskouras), £23 (fragment of painted stone), £24-26 (faience vase fragments). As the tomb's true identity became clear, the whole of the chamber was excavated (two baskets), including an inchoate mass of stone over the floor, perhaps connected with the original door-blocking. Near the E side were 9 and 13 (EPC oinochoai, the first containing an egg), 10-12 (O cups), 14 (lid) and 15 (EO skyphos). The coarse pithos 16 was found near the destroyed stomion. In addition were £27, fragments of bronze sheet, and £29 (plastic vase -owl) subsequently renumbered 26. Fragments of burnt bone were found here and there in the fill. POTTERY (PLATES 1024) 1. OLPE.

The W wall of the dromos was straight, the E described an uneven curve. The dromos rose a vertical distance of 1.80 from the stomion to its end at a mean gradient of 160, near the end was a 'step' 0.48 m high, at an angle of 52o. The bottom part of the blocking wall, two large stones set upright across the entrance (larger 0.55 X 0.60 X 0.10) and a smaller one, to their E, were in situ, but above lay many stones in disarray. The stomion was shallow and, despite the presence of door jambs, wide. There was a steep step 0.65 down to the chamber floor, which was at least 2.55 below modern surface. The corners of the squarish chamber were rounded. The roof was destroyed. In its hypothetical second phase it was at least 1.85 high; the restored first phase height was c. 1.40. The tomb was close E of the most congested part of the cemetery, part of the E- w line of tombs 1 06-26-40-1 12-28-18 across the S end of the site. The orientation was ESE-WNW. The chamber was on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found after mechanical clearance of topsoil. The chamber and the S part of the dromos had clearly been robbed from above and then, perhaps, backfilled. R glass fragments from an uncertain area of this tomb could mean the robbing took place no earlier than the R period. The N part of the dromos fill was sterile kouskouras backfill and may have been undisturbed since the tomb's original burials. The S part (Level 1) was filled with brown earth containing worn polychrome sherds and 1, anO pithos on its side, up to 1.00 above the dromos floor. Beneath the disturbed stones above the blocking wall was 2, a SM amphoriskos, possibly thrown out by the looters if they reached the real chamber floor. For 2.00 below ground surface the chamber fill was brown earth containing quantities of LG-LO sherds, including many polychrome pieces and a noticeable quantity of unburnt bone, perhaps thrown up from the original SM burial horizon. High in this fill were 3, a LO oinochoe and fi, fragments of a bronze fibula. Lower down a number of LO pots appeared ranged round the edge of the chamber, from NW to NE. Starting in the NW, these were 4, a large oinochoe; 5, a small lekythos; 6, an oinochoe; 7, a plastic vase (demon); 8, an aryballos and 9, plastic vase (cock). Below 8, and between 7 and 9, was at least one urn-sherd with a small quantity of cremated bone within its curve. Two fragmentary O pithoi, 32, 33, were later assembled from sherds, as well as an alabastron, 22, a pyxis, 27, and an oinochoe, 36, all LO. All these (including 3) probably represent two LO interments; 7, 8 and 9 must have been grouped together. Below this material was a level of fallen kouskouras, whose upper part contained O sherds and, against the centre of the chamber's back wall, the EO lekythos 10. The lowest 0.25 of the roof fall {kouskouras) covered a SM deposit. Though there was some disorder, it was probably due to successive SM burial parties, followed by the roof fall; the majority of pots was unbroken. 14, a flask, and 15, a stirrup jar, were near the N wall. To the E were a small oinochoe, 18, a cup, 19, and a stirrup jar, 20. Nearby was a confused heap of unburnt bone fragments and teeth, representing two perhaps three people, one a young adult, none very old. There were two scraps of burnt bone in this level. Also found were f2, gold leaf rosette with attached organic matter and £3, scraps of an iron pin. Close S of these were the shoulder- handled amphora 16, the stirrup jar 21 beside it. Another stirrup jar, 12, was equidistant from 11 and i6.fi2, part of a large iron fibula, was between 12 and the mouth of 11; fi3, another part of the same fibula, was just N of 16 and 21. Just inside the entrance were fs6, 7,</page><page sequence="105">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 40 87 many pieces of iron pin, and fio, from the sieve, could be added to them. Also from the sieve, belonging to the SM deposit, were fs, iron ring, £B, silver ring, f4, small gold wire hoop, fg, carved bone pin, fn5 another very small one. fi45 bone attachment, fi6, bronze fibula fragment, fi7, fragmentary iron fibula, all identified subsequently, may also have been SM. There SM finds do not separate clearly into individual groups, but a tentative reconstruction would be: earlier burial - 11, 13, 17-20, Í2-5 and heaped up bones; later burial - ?i2, 14-16, 21, f6 + 7 + 10, 8, 9, 11. The tomb was disused between the roof fall over the SM deposit and LG- 22- 46, repaired from fragments from the upper chamber-fill, included eight pithoi - one LG, 315 one LG/EO 45; three EO, 24, 30, 32 and three LO, 23, 33, 46. Perhaps LO users removed some of the later interments, for LO pots were in situ on the floor, while LG-O vessels were only fragments. They, too, must have been responsible for the blocking as found, and may have thrown 1 into the dromos. The later looters evidently saw, and smashed, the two LO urns, but did not notice the smaller LO items near the walls. POTTERY (PLATES 1057) 1. *COARSE PITHOS. PH. 62.

It rose a vertical distance of c. 1.00 from the approximate position of the stomion to its end and at a mean angle</page><page sequence="108">go KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY of 130. The blocking wall, stomion and adjacent part of the chamber had been obliterated. The chamber appeared to have been round. The roof had been destroyed; the back wall survived to a height of 0.60. The floor was at least 1.00 below modern surface. The tomb was the N-most of a line of four - 44, 48, 60, 61 - with similar lines to E and W, on the NW side of the main concentration of tombs. Its orientation was E by S, W by N. The tomb was first seen as a head of dark soil within its kouskouras matrix after hand- cleaning an area previously mechanically stripped of topsoil. Stomion, blocking wall and part of the chamber were destroyed by the enclosure of the mortuary church, the S-most part of whose W wall cut right across the tomb. The perimeter wall consisted of a thick pink plaster 'floor' supported on a layer of stones c. 0.50 thick,. Below these was a fill of brown earth right down to the chamber floor. The only find in the chamber was a bit of an iron knife. Tomb 45 SW (figs. 5, 24, plate 19 b-c) L. overall: 5.40. Dromos: L. 3.70. W. 1.36. Stomion: 0.25 X c. 0.65. Chamber: 1.80 X 1.50 This small, neatly cut tomb had a relatively broad dromos with parallel sides, sloping upwards evenly at an angle of 140. The stomion was preserved; there were two stages in its stone blocking. Four courses of carelessly piled field stones rested on a slab 0.75 X 0.44 X 0.16, lying flat, the latter probably part of the original blocking, but resited, the former from the final use. A step (0.25) led from stomion to the oval chamber, whose roof was lost, back wall preserved 0.80 high. The chamber floor was 2.00 below modern surface. The tomb lay within the N-S group 30-45-24-25-56. Its orientation was E by N, W by S, with the chamber on the E side. The tomb was found after mechanical topsoil stripping as a head of dark soil contrasting with the white kouskouras matrix. Two HL inhumation graves overlay it - T. 49 above and across the NE side of the chamber, T 55 in the W half of the dromos, cutting into its S edge. The tomb was much disturbed. The dromos was excavated as level 1 (four baskets). Though it contained much broken pottery, no numbered finds were recovered during excavation. In the homogeneous, disturbed fill (level 2 - two pottery baskets), on and above the floor were the remains of a coarse pithos, 1, two EPG stirrup jars, 2 + 5, 7, two fragmentary amphorae, 4, 6, and a bell-skyphos, 3. Only the last was found complete. Other objects included Í2, part of a silver pin, f4, remains of a bronze fibula, £5 + 6 + 7, an iron spearhead and £8, iron spearhead. POTTERY (PLATE 108) 1.

The dromos outline was slightly irregular. It sloped upwards at an even angle of 1 2.5o. A step (0.24) from dromos down to chamber floor must roughly mark the inner edge of the destroyed stomion. The back wall of the chamber survived 0.12 high. The remainder, and the roof, were destroyed. The floor was at least 2.00 below modern ground level. The chamber had evidently originally been oval in plan. Three courses of what remained of the blocking wall were in situ, 0.40 high, surviving width 0.70. The tomb was second in a group of four closely juxtaposed in a N-S line (Ts. 44, 48, 60, 61) immediately N of the N-S line - 30-45-24-25-26. The orientation was 50 S of E-W, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found after mechanical removal of topsoil as a head of dark soil contrasting with the kouskouras matrix. The NE side of the dromos and the NE side of the chamber were destroyed from c. 0.65 from the blocking wall by the foundation trench of the enclosure wall of the mortuary church. For most of its length there were relatively few finds in the dromos. At the W end, however, the fill of a robbing pit extended over the whole width of the dromos, from 1.80 from the blocking wall. In the area of the pit were found fi (glass fragment) and f2 (gold umbo) In the light brown pit-fill were bronze fragments (fia, 5, 7-8, 10) three fibulae (f2a, 3, 6) and a fibula spring (f&lt;)), £4 (a scarab) and pot sherds. Between the pit and the blocking, a stone, 0.71 X 0.18, may have come from the blocking; under it were a bronze fragment (fu), an iron spearhead (¿12), bronze fragments (fi3) and sherds. A dromos fill of light kouskouras survived</page><page sequence="110">g2 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY beyond the pit. That part of the blocking remained in situ may suggest that the tomb was emptied with some ceremony, not simply robbed. The chamber collapse probably predated the construction of the ECh wall. The area over the roof and immediately S was removed mechanically. Under the brown soil which had accumulated over the collapsed roof was kouskouras and brown soil in which a tessera (fi6) and a bronze fibula (£15) were found. This contaminated level overlay a cleaner kouskouras containing pottery, fi8 (broken bronze ring) and fi7 (bronze fragment). Two baskets of sherds were collected from the chamber floor, as well as 1, SM/EPG stirrup jar found on its side at the back of the chamber, with fragments of a krater, 3. A damaged skyphos, 2, was in the centre; in the N corner 4, a SM/EPG stirrup jar, was found, fi«), 20 (bronze fragments) and £21 (iron fragment) were closer to the front of the chamber.

Tomb 55 SE (figs. 6, 26; plate 19/) Extant L. overall: c. 4.00. Dromos: L. c. 3.00. W. 0.86. Stomion: destroyed. Chamber: 1.33 X 1.20. The dromos was poorly preserved; its sides appeared irregular. What remained rose a vertical distance of 0.35 from the stomion, at first almost level then at an angle of io°. No trace survived of blocking wall or stomion; there was a drop of 0.44 from the dromos to the chamber floor (at an angle of c. 65o). The chamber was almost square. In its floor were cut two small, approximately rectangular pits, one in the NW corner (0.60 X 0.44 X 0.20 deep), one in the centre (0.80 X 0.40 X 0.20 deep). Their longer axes were at right angles to each other. The roof was lost. The floor was at least 1.40 below modern surface. A cutting on the S side of the dromos c. 0.90 wide, 0.60 deep may have been a niche. The tomb was the S-most of the irregular N-S line of tombs - 219-14-13-19-55 - on the SE side of the area of the cemetery excavated in 1978. Its orientation was ENE-WSW. The chamber was on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found after mechanical clearance of topsoil. It was much disturbed. The HL T. 51 had probably destroyed the end of the dromos. The HL Ts. 35 and 50 had cut the N dromos wall, roughly at right angles. The dromos niche had been cut into by the S end of two</page><page sequence="112">g4 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY unnumbered possible HL/R graves. A large, shallow pit covered almost all the chamber and the first 2.00 of the dromos, extending beyond the latter, its possible niche and later graves (supra). This pit could have been formed and filled at almost any period after the mortuary church's destruction. But the tomb would have been discovered by the HL grave diggers. The upper fill of the pit consisted of many stones in loose brown earth, the lower of light brown earth and kouskouras lumps. Throughout were sherds of every period and scattered human bones, which were those of at least two adults (one elderly), one male and one female. Their comparatively good, dry condition suggested they had come from an ECh tomb rather than HL/R graves, fi, glass tessera, was also found. Beyond the pit some earlier dromos fill remained, in which were £2, a pierced clay strap, a boar's tusk, a small (?) horn and, at the W edge of the pit, an EPG stirrup jar, 2. 3 (EPG stirrup jar fragment) and 4 (piece of PG bell- skyphos) were among sherds from the fill, evidence of the tomb's use as early as the tenth century BC. There were no finds from the chamber, where the two pits were empty, their purposes unknown. In the dromos 'niche' was the EPG oinochoe 1, main reason for suspecting the cutting had been a niche.

Tomb 56 SW (figs. 55 19-20, plate 20 a) (See Introduction: Ts. 34, 56, 57) L. overall: 4.0+ Dromos: L. 2.40+. W. 1. 20-1. 30. Stomion: (largely destroyed) c. 0.25 X 0.65. Chamber: 1.70 X c. 1.20. The w end of the dromos remained unexcavated where it was overlain by masonry of the R T 58. The dromos sloped upwards from the destroyed stomion at an angle of, first, 8°, later 130. There was an irregular inset in the S dromos wall, near the stomion, 0.80 X 0.40. There was no step into the oval chamber from the stomion. The roof was missing, the rear wall preserved 0.60 high. The chamber floor was 2.30 below modern surface. The tomb was the last in the N-S group 30-45-24-25-56. The orientation was ESE-WNW with the chamber on the E side, and thus slightly S of the axes of the other four tombs in the group. The tomb gradually came to light during excavation of T. 34 (q.v.) when, thanks to the</page><page sequence="113">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 56 g5 confusion caused by the large robbing pit, it was for a time misinterpreted as a side-chamber on the S side of T. 34's dromos. The error was corrected following the mechanical clearance of a wider area of adjacent topsoil. The tomb had been much damaged, so that the original form and size of the dromos was only determined with difficulty, thanks to T 58 and the harm caused to the N side of the dromos by the robbing pit. In post-excavation study, vases and objects incorrectly ascribed in the field to T 34 have been reallocated to this tomb. £40-64, originally given to T. 34, 13 have been transferred to T. 56 unaltered with the consequence that there are no f. nos. for T. 56 from 5-39 inclusive. The disturbed dromos fill was excavated as layer 1 (two baskets) and layer 2 (one basket), composed of brown soil, kouskouras and sherds. Finds included numerous sherds of the E Greek Wild Goat dinos T 34. 18, a LO aryballos, 13, an EPC olpe, 2, a LO aryballos, 1, and O pointed alabastron, 5, an aryballos, 29, an E Greek Wild Goat oinochoe, 11, a LO polychrome lid, 14. Other finds include faience, £42-44, 46, 51-52, bronze pins, £41, 50, 53, a bronze ring, £49, groups of fragments of sheet bronze, £40, 48, and an iron object, £45 + 47. Excavation of the dromos was only finally completed after further mechanical topsoil removal. This was layer 1 (two baskets) where another group of vases and objects was identified, including part of the small O polychrome larnax, 15, the rest of which had been found in T 34 (f. 17), a LO aryballos, 3, an E Mediterranean lekythos, 10, the neck of a LO jug, 12, many fragments of which came from the fill of T. 34, a small vase, 7, and more fragments of the dinos T. 34.18. Parts of a LO polychrome pithos, 16, a pedestal base, a LO aryballos, 4, and many fragments of the Cretan O dinos, 18, were also found, as well as pieces of faience, £55-56, 58-59, bronze pins, £61, 62, a bronze disc, f6o, and a group of bronze fragments, £63. Also in the dromos fill was a large rectangular stone also, 0.56 X 0.44 X 0.16, which might once have been part of the door-blocking. The chamber fill was removed in three spits, layers 1-3 (three baskets). Though there was more kouskouras than in the dromos-ñll, this was indistinguishable from it, and contained many fragments of 18, the Cretan O dinos, the rest of which was in the dromos. Three iron objects, fi-3, nail and two knife fragments, were close to the floor. From the many sherds collected in the chamber a SM/EPG krater, 6, was almost completely restored. Although the ruinous state of this tomb qualifies any statement made about it, the presence of three SM/EPG vases (6 - krater; 38, 39 - amphorae) suggests it was first used very early in the DA. Perhaps 25.3, another SM/EPG neck-handled amphora (belonging in fact to T. 34), originated in T 56. POTTERY (PLATES 110-12) 1. ARYBALLOS (fig. 87). H. 9. Gaps in wall and handle, chips in rim.

Tomb 57 SW (figs. 5, 19, 20) (See Introduction: Ts. 34, 56, 57) L. overall: 2.50. Dromos: L. 1.30. W. 0.60. Stomion: destroyed. Chamber: 1.55 X 1.10. As preserved, the sides of the narrow dromos seem to splay from the point where the stomion originally was. There is no upward slope to the dromos. A line of three stones set against a step (0.15 deep) may have been in situ and mark the position of the door blocking, of which they would have been the lowest course. The chamber walls either side of the entrance were straight, at obtuse angles to it. There were angular junctions with the side walls, which then described a continuous curve to form the back wall. The roof was lost; the back wall survived to 0.80 high, while the chamber floor was 2.10 below modern ground surface. This may have been the final tomb to have been squeezed into the N-S line Ts. 30-45-24-25-56, after, that is, T. 34 had been slotted into the gap between Ts. 25 and 56. Its roughly W-E orientation, chamber on the W side (actually it was W by N-E by s) makes it very unusual in the cemetery (though, see T. 229). It was constructed so that the S side of its chamber cuts the dromos of T 56, while the E end of its dromos overlaps, and confuses the W end of T. 34's dromos (this area was further abused by the large robbing pit). The tomb's existence was only appreciated at an advanced stage in the excavation of T. 34's dromos, and the consequent mechanical removal of overburden which exposed the destroyed chamber and showed there had been two tombs back-to-back. The fill of what remained of the dromos was excavated as layer 2 (two baskets), but was indistinguishable from the fills of Ts. 34 and 56. Inside the chamber were fragments of mudbrick, scraps of bone and many sherds. 1 (E Greek bird bowl), 2 (LO oinochoe), 5 (LO aryballos) and 4 were identified in the chamber, with f± (bronze pin), £5-8 (terracotta objects). A number of other vases were subsequently made up, in part or whole, from the fragments collected.</page><page sequence="117">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 56-7, 59 99 POTTERY (PLATE 1 13) 1.

The grave was found when topsoil was stripped mechanically during the main search for other substantial chamber-tombs S of the N-S line 30-45-24-25-56. It lay rather higher than most of the DA graves. It immediately adjoined the atypical DA T. 80 (q.v.) and was for a time misinterpreted as side-chamber or dromos-niche of that tomb.

Tombs 60 and 138 introduction During excavation of the chamber-tomb T. 60 a feature appeared in the N wall of the dromos at its E end, beside the stomion, which was at first thought to be a niche, or side chamber. As work advanced, however, it was seen that this was, in fact, part of the chamber of a small chamber- tomb, T. 138, which had been dug at right angles to T. 60 so that the chamber partly overlay T. 6o's stomion and immediately adjacent dromos, while its own dromos took up most of the distance between T. 60 and T. 48, next to the N. The bottom of T 138's chamber was up to 0.80 above the surface of T 6o's dromos. Tomb 60 SW (figs. 5, 27, plates 20 c-d) L. overall: 8.85. Dromos: L. 6.62. W. 1.15-1.10. Stomion: 0.50 X 0.30. Chamber: 1.60 X 1.94. H. c. 1. 00. The long dromos was cut somewhat irregularly, the roughly parallel sides wandering one or two degrees s of their long axis. For 1.50 from the stomion the dromos rose at 70, thereafter more steeply, at ii°; there was a difference of 1.50 in height between the chamber floor and the mouth of the dromos. The stomion was partly preserved; a rather rough stone slab, 0.31 X 0.15 X 0.05 on its floor was probably the lowest stone of the original blocking rather than the threshold. The blocking as found was not built within the stomion, but immediately in front of</page><page sequence="119">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE -Ts. 59-60 I0I the jambs, covering almost the full width of the dromos. It was up to 0.50 high, made up of a miscellany of stone, chiefly in re-use, the lower stones lying flat, three upper stones, side-by- side, on end, the largest c. 0.45 X 0.30. A step 0.10 led down into the roughly oval chamber, much of the roof of which had fallen. The back wall however, was preserved to its full height. Towards the back of the chamber was an oval pit, 0.45 X 0.41, 0.10 deep. This tomb belonged to a N-S line of DA chamber- tombs, Ts. 44-48-60-61, with similar lines to E and W, on the NW side of the main concentration of tombs. The orientation was ESE-WNW. In the space between T. 60 and T. 48, next to the N, were the HL/R inhumation graves, Ts. 73 and 84, while the similar T. 88 was at the mouth of the dromos. The tomb was first seen as a head of dark soil within its kouskouras matrix after hand cleaning an area previously mechanically stripped of topsoil. The dromos was not only disturbed by T. 138 (q.v.) but by a robbing pit 1.92 X 1.90 close to the stomion, cutting earlier fill. A bronze coin (£7) in the dromos fill hints at an HL grave destroyed in the course of robbing. For most of its length the dromos was filled with a uniform light brown soil, containing many sherds deriving from pots which had evidently been cleared from the chamber. Inventoried finds, concentrated in the middle of the dromos, included a cremation pithos lid, 1, a skyphos, 2, fragments of an iron sword, fi, and a bronze fragment, f2. The robbing pit in the SE corner of the dromos (not kept entirely separate from the rest of the dromos fill during excavation) contained, as well as pottery, fs, iron blade, fli, bronze fragment, fj9 bronze coin. Some dromos fill remained undisturbed beneath the pit with a content of sherds and, immediately in front of the blocking wall, the lower half of an amphora, 5, and an aryballos, 4, in the NE and SW corners respectively. The robbing pit had partly disturbed the blocking wall. The chamber was excavated from above. The first metre of deposit was a dark brown soil, overlaying a level of kouskouras with patches of soil. There was G and O pottery in the upper fill, fragments of glass (fg, 12, 13), scraps of bronze (fio) and an iron O pin (fu). On the top of the kouskouras was a group of vases whose association must date from the robbing of the tomb. These were a pithos, 7 + 9, a bell-skyphos, 6, a lid, 10, an oinochoe, 11, a stirrup jar, 12, and part of another pithos, 13. The difference in the appearance of the fill is probably not of chronological significance as the lower kouskouras included a mixed group of sherds, PG-LG: a bell-skyphos, 14, and an iron fragment, fi4« Close to the entrance was an iron pin, fi55 at the back of the chamber was the rest (15) of the cremation pithos which joined 13, a feeding jug, i6, on the s side. There were some fragments of unburnt bone on the top of the kouskouras, but the date of any inhumation is uncertain. POTTERY (PLATES 114-15) 1. CONICAL LID. Frs. of centre and wall.

Stomion: destroyed. Chamber: 1.90 X 1.20. The dromos outline had a slight curve around midpoint. The dromos sloped upwards at angles varying from 5°-i4°. A step (0.14) from the dromos down to the chamber floor must roughly mark the inner edge of the destroyed stomion. The roof of the oval chamber was lost; the back wall survived to 0.60 high. The floor was 1.40 below modern ground surface. There was a small niche 0.65 X 0.45, oval in plan, its floor 1.0 higher than the chamber floor, immediately S of the chamber. Its relationship to T 61 is quite uncertain. The tomb was one of a group of four closely juxtaposed in a N-S line (T 44-48-60-61) immediately W of the N-S line 30-45-24-25-56. Its orientation was close to E-W, the chamber on the E side. The tomb was found after mechanical topsoil removal as a head of dark soil contrasting with the surrounding white kouskouras matrix. It was thoroughly plundered. The upper fill of dromos and chamber was dug as a single level, 1 (four baskets), a homogeneous brown soil mixed with kouskouras, containing little pottery. In the chamber this overlay level 2 (one basket), an incoherent mass of stone and roof tile. This feature might represent a HL or R tile grave cut into the upper chamber fill, destroying the stomion and its blocking in the process. Such hypothetical grave(s) will subsequently have been destroyed, perhaps during Ch building activity. Level 4 (two baskets), largely consisting of kouskouras, lay between the bottom of this debris and the floor. The pottery from the fills was heterogeneous including SM, PG, G and O. Several fragments of the same SM neck-handled amphora may point to the tomb's use early in the cemetery's history. The niche (supra) contained two small LG pots, 1 and 2. POTTERY (PLATE 1 16) i.

The group was placed on a layer of pebbles within its pit, suggesting deliberate deposition. T. 28 was disturbed, but not plundered, and its blocking stones were in position, so there is no reason to believe that this group was removed from the chamber. The PGB/EG-MG date of the group is late enough to be later than the last LPG-PGB material in T. 28. The pit contained a fragmentary urn, 5, over the top of which bone was found. There were also a skyphos, 1, a ribbed juglet, 2, a pyxis, 3, an aryballos, 4, a juglet, 6, and an oinochoe, 7.

'Tomb' 65 This designation was given to a shapeless head of dark soil visible in its kouskouras matrix a short distance SW of T. 61, investigated at the same time as Ts. 6o5 61 and 138. It proved not to be a tomb. The excavated area was roughly 5.00 square at the surface; tests reached over 3.00 into the filling. The upper level contained the familiar fill of brown soil mixed with kouskouras, including R debris, HL and earlier pottery encountered in all the pillaged graves. As work advanced in what continued obviously to be made ground, the anticipated signs of tomb construction(s) failed to materialize, while the cutting (if such it were) in the kouskouras remained formless. No change of level was detected. Deep in the fill, several displaced poros blocks were uncovered, briefly raising the hope that the feature might prove to be a much-destroyed built tomb. But the blocks proved merely to be a feature of the fill; nothing with which they could be connected underlay them. Excavation stopped before the bottom of the fill was reached, it being clear that, if there had ever been a tomb here, it had been totally destroyed by subsequent activity. A possible explanation for the feature is that it had been a quarry pit for the extraction of kouskouras, subsequently (perhaps in the lifetime of the mortuary church) refilled with the heterogeneous debris of which the disturbed topsoil over the site must by that time have consisted. Catalogued material recovered from the fill ranged in date from PGB to LO. POTTERY (PLATE 116) 1. JUG-ARYBALLOS (fig. 93). H. 10.3. Rim and foot chipped. Trace of cream slip. PGB. 2.

No features were positively identified- see general description, infra. The tomb interlocked with T 28, at the E end of the line of early tombs 106-26-40-112 -28-18 across the S end of the site. The orientation could have been NNE-SSW. The tomb was first noticed because it had destroyed the S end of the W wall of T 28's dromos. It appeared as a head of brown earth containing several fairly large stones, and a skull. It was later seen as a very irregular cutting in the kouskouras W of T. 28. It had one fairly straight edge (over a distance of c. 1.00) running WSW from T. 28's W dromos wall. At the S end was a narrow but distinct bulge in the tomb's outline and between this and the skull [supra) were some unburnt 'uninformative, gracile' pieces of bone. The distance between the skull and the bulge (c. 1. 80-1. 90) and its width (0.55) suggests here was the remains of a HL/R grave. Apart from this the tomb came down to a 'floor' 0.88 below surface, at the S end of which was a small, squarish pit, 0.45 X 0.40 X 0.35 deep, empty apart from a stone, and its purpose unknown At the N end was a cutting, possibly a niche, with floor 0.34 above that of the tomb. In it was 2, part of a LO pithos; i, a LO miniature cup, was 0.20 E of it at a slightly higher level in the fill. An O oinochoe, 3, was made up from sherds. The dromos fill of T. 28 was in two sections, the dividing line approximately from the point where T 69 cut T 28's W dromos wall to a point just N of T. 28.1 against the E dromos wall. N of this line was hard, stable kouskouras sterile backfill. Sherds were plentiful in the fill S of the line, and were taken up as part of T. 28's level 1, as were T. 28's Ó dromos pots 1-3. It seems likely that the SW outline of T 69 (supra) continued into and across the dromos of T. 28, and that the material S of the line in 28's dromos should actually be associated material from the T. 69 fill. This, in combination, might represent an O tomb, orientated NNE-SSW, with a possible chamber in 28's dromos to which 1, 2 and 3 (supra) actually belonged. The stones in the cutting in T. 28's dromos wall would then be explained as a destroyed blocking wall. No chamber was observed during excavation, however, and the E wall of T. 28's dromos was unaffected. The LO interment presumably represented by T 69's 1 and 2 may have been a deliberate addition to the tomb, or an unconnected, later pithos burial in a shallow pit.</page><page sequence="125">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE "IV 65, Ts. 69, 75 wy POTTERY 1.

Tomb 75 W (figs. 4, 29-30; plates 21 c-e, 22) L. overall: n.6o. Dromos: L. 9.75. W. 1.10-1.30. Stomion: 0.35 X 0.78. Chamber: 2.15 X 1.60. The dromos, whose sides narrowed slightly for 5.80 of its length, thence widened again to its mouth. It rose 1.64 from the stomion to its mouth at a slope ranging from 50 near the stomion to 150 at midpoint. There was a large door-slab, displaced, in the stomion, 1.20 X 0.50 X 0.10, canted at an angle of 30o in the direction of the stomion. There was a stone threshold-slab the width and depth of the stomion, on which stood two roughly square stones, the larger 0.20 X 0.20 X 0.15, perhaps once part of the original blocking wall. The sub-rectangular chamber had lost its roof; the back wall was preserved 0.60 high. The floor, which had been strewn with fine gravel, was 3.00 below modern ground surface. Two stone blocks on the floor (one evidently in situ) may have been stands for cremation pithoi. There was a niche on the N side of the dromos, 1.50 from the stomion, 0.90 wide, 1.10 deep, 0.68. high, its floor 0.40-0.55 higher than the adjacent dromos surface. Immediately above it was a second, later niche, 1.40 wide, up to 0.74 deep, 0.50 high, its floor 1.15 below modern surface. The tomb - one of the largest in the cemetery - was the N of a N-s series (75- 107- 132- 129) in the W centre of the necropolis. Its orientation was E by S-W by N, deviating by one or two degrees to the S of the mean orientation of the main groups of chamber tombs in the cemetery. The tomb was first seen as an inchoate head of dark soil against the white kouskouras matrix, uncovered after this area had been mechanically stripped. Though superficial damage was caused by HL grave digging {infra) the tomb remained substantially untouched from the moment of its final, LO, use. As such it is a paradigm of the comparatively chaotic conditions created in a tomb repeatedly used for several generations. Between 40 and 50 cremation pithoi were recovered; pithoi had been committed not only to the chamber and dromos niches but, at the end, to a pit in the dromos fill above the stomion. At some time, a large amount of pottery, including several cremation pithoi, was smashed and thrown out into the dromos. Excavation of the dromos located the remains of more than one HL inhumation. The first to be found had cut through a group of O vases at the E end, near the stomion. Only the leg bones remained, with which are to be associated the HL bottles, 2 and 4. The grave (not separately numbered) was orientated roughly NW-SE. Some 1.50 further w in the upper fill were traces of another HL burial, a lower jaw to which adhered (£4) a bronze drachma (perhaps a Cretan imitation of a coin of Rhodes of c. 200 BC). Nearby was £5, an HL terracotta lamp. The upper, rather hard dromos fill was removed as layer 1 (two baskets), quickly exposing the group of O vases damaged by the HL grave {supra). The deposit containing the group of O vases (layer 2-five baskets) consisted of brown soil and kouskouras, mixed with a little small rubble. There were 35 vases (including ten cremation pithoi) packed in very close together, in two tiers, of which part of the upper tier had been cut by the HL grave, in particular the O polychrome</page><page sequence="126">K)8 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY pithos, i and the EO jug, 5. 3 was a detached part of the polychrome pithos, 13 with, near it, the damaged O jug 6. The main group of pithoi comprised a nearly complete polychrome example, 7, containing an aryballos, i65 a small fragment of chipped stone, 0.005 X 0.004 (identified during study of the cremation) and a bronze pin, fig, an almost complete pithos, 8, holding the aryballos, 21. 10 was a polychrome pithos, as was 13 with its lid, 25, an O aryballos, 24 and a cup 26. 14 was a complete polychrome pithos. A last polychrome pithos, 20, was covered by the O plate, 9 and contained a polychrome lid fragment, 27 and aryballos, 28. Closely associated with these pithoi were a fragmentary cylindrical polychrome lid, 11, most of an oinochoe, 12 and much of a second, 15. Two very fragmentary black cups, 17, 22, were with 14; a complete O jug, 18 was at the E end of the group with a fragmentary O lid, 29. 0.40 w of the main group stood the MG pithos, 19, containing an aryballos, 30. Beneath 19 was the nearly complete jug, 31. 0.50 s were some fragments of an O jug. When this main group had been lifted, a second level, less well preserved, was found underneath, crushed in very tight together against the outer face of the upper (later) niche. These comprised a very fragmentary polychrome pithos, 32, containing a cremation and an aryballos, 37. 33, a complete kalathos, had the remains of a cremation below it. There was half a polychrome lid, 34, with 36, a skyphos fragment below it, and a fragmentary pithos, 35, other pieces of which came from the chamber and from layer 3, the pottery deposit in the dromos [infra). This group must predate the upper series; the vases, particularly in view of the cross-joins with the chamber, are probably part of the main dromos deposit of broken vases, whose series of cross-joins with material in the chamber argues strongly that the original source was in the chamber. In the shallow, W half of the dromos (layer 2 - three pottery baskets), several patches of burnt material - Premains of pyres - were isolated in the fill, in one of which was f6 - bronze pellets, perhaps melted droplets from some object laid on the pyre with its owner. More of the dromos fill was removed as layer 3 (three pottery baskets), which began to uncover, for a distance of 4.50 from the stomion, a deposit containing masses of broken pottery (including some whole, or nearly whole vases). The deposit was much confused by the construction of a ragged 'wall' across the dromos, in front of and at the level of the lower niche. Judging by the broken pottery either side of it, in its make-up and underneath it, this 'wall' must have been built during whatever process it was that created the massive dromos pottery deposit. For instance, the pithos 172 was reassembled from fragments that came from in front of the wall, in its make-up, and beneath it. The Praisos-type lekythos, 209, was nearly completely repaired from fragments in front of it, within it, under it, and from the chamber. The 'wall's' function is uncertain; perhaps it was to hold back spoil in the W part of the dromos while a space was being cleared in front of the stomion. Vases were isolated in the dromos deposit during excavation both on the W side of the dividing wall and the E. On the w side (layer 2, two baskets) were the MG pithos, 38, with fg, an iron knife fragment, the MG neck-handled amphora, 39 (more of which came from E of the wall, from the chamber, and from the niche fill), a lekythos fragment, 40 (which joined 43), a Parian LG skyphos, fragmentary, 41, a MG pithos, 42 (more of which came from the chamber and niche fill), the LG EO lid, 45, and a Creto-Cypriot lekythos, 43. Beyond this group, to the W, layer 2 (one basket) very largely comprised the original dromos fill of reworked kouskouras, with very little pottery. Still on the W side of the 'wall', layer 3 (one basket), below the main pottery deposit, contained more pottery, charcoal, and loose fragments of cremated bone, the objects fu (iron knife, spear socket, iron pins), fi3, 14 (fragments of iron swords)</page><page sequence="127">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 75 1 09 and fi5 (part of a small iron spearhead). In the equivalent deposit E of the 'wall' (two baskets) was fi6 (bronze fibula fragment). Identifiable vase fragments E of the 'wall5 were isolated in layer 4 - three baskets - comprising a MG cup, 46 (more of which was in the chamber), a lid, 47 (also partly in the chamber, partly in the niche fill), a nearly complete EG kalathos-lid (part of which was in the chamber), a pithos fragment, 49, a nearly complete O aryballos, 50, a fragmentary EG kalathos-lid (more of which was in the chamber), a large MG pithos fragment with rust-stain from an iron object, 52, a nearly complete lid, 53, two-thirds of an EG kalathos, 54 and a fragmentary O bird vase, 55. There were also a glass bead, fi7, an iron knife-hilt, fi8 and a bronze pin, £30. When the 'wall' was removed (layer 3 (B), one basket) much of a LG pithos, 56, was found, more of which came from further w in the dromos, and an iron javelin-head, £20. Below the 'wall' was a mass of cremated bone and several iron objects - £21, (knife, etc), £22 (spearhead, etc), £23 (spearhead or sword fragment). The broken pottery that had been covered by the 'wall' was removed as layer 3 (three baskets). With this was a bronze pin, £25, fragments of an iron knife, spearheads and a sword, f26, and some faience beads, £27. While fragments from this part of the deposit were subsequently found to join with other parts of the deposit and with material from the chamber, 196 (lid) and 214 (aryballos fragment) came from here alone. What seemed to be the last remains of this huge deposit were excavated as layers (two baskets). This contained the E-MG oinochoe, 57, other fragments of which were found in the chamber. f28 was a fish vertebra amulet, £29 a bronze spectacle fibula fragment. The last skin of soil over the dromos floor was dug as layer 5 (three baskets); material from it was subsequently found to join with the main pottery deposit, and it is clear that layers 3, 4 and 5 are different aspects of the same very large deposit. In the lowest part were fragments of bronze, £31, a bronze vase handle, £56, and an iron weapon tip, £57. The chamber was excavated from above after the mechanical removal of topsoil and fallen roof. Its fill was dug as layer 6 (eight pottery baskets). It contained over sixty vases and a large number of iron objects. It was certainly in disarray, with its roof collapsed, and the blocking stone of its doorway far out of place. Here and there, piles of broken pottery recalled the confusion of the main deposit in the dromos. Of eighty-one vases made up from fragments during post-excavation study from all deposits combined, sixty belonged in part or whole to the chamber, while twenty of those were made up from fragments coming only from the chamber. This evidence, taken with the very scrappy nature of the finds other than pottery, and the almost complete lack of precious objects, suggests that the chamber was rifled during the O period, that most (but not all) of the pots it contained were broken, large quantities being shovelled out into the dromos, which must have been completely cleared of fill at this time. The filling must have been replaced over the pile of debris, and the blocking 'wall' built in it, and on it. What is the connection between this activity, and the deposition of the complex of cremation pithoi and associated vases found in the upper dromos fill [supra)? The chamber contents were fairly evenly distributed over the floor, in some areas in two tiers, of relatively intact vessels, in others little more than piles of sherds subsequently to be recomposed as vases. From the centre of the E (back) wall, clockwise round the chamber were the following major items: pedestal base of a large MG krater, 117, subsequently completed from fragments scattered elsewhere in the chamber, a LG pithos, 68, containing the aryballoi 89-91, an iron pin fragment (L. 0.125) identified during study of the cremation; the fragmentary polychrome pithos, 67, and E-MG oinochoe, 58 + 65 (fragment in the niche fill) with the complete skyphos, 66, covering its mouth. Nearby were crushed remains of an O pithos, 63.</page><page sequence="128">no KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Just inside the doorway were the LG pithos 72, a lid, 64, over it, containing the lekythos, 87, and a lump of earth with cloth impression noted during study of the cremation. Adjoining it was a LG hydria, 73, and the MG pithos, 74 + 109, containing a lid, 84, and the two aryballoi, 85-6, a bead, £3ia, a bronze bracelet, £32, and a group of glass beads, £335 a fragment of another was identified during study of the cremation. At the other side of the doorway, in the NW corner, was a mass of broken pottery from which five more complete vases were mended:- a domed lid, 76, two kalathoi, 77, 80, and two MG cups, 78, 79. Beneath were found fragments of the earliest pithos in the tomb, the EG straight-sided no, other pieces of which were in the dromos deposit, part of a polychrome pithos, 106, a nearly complete MG cup, 107, and a complete lid, 108. On the floor, immediately under these vases, were several iron objects - two small javelin-heads, £20, a broad-bladed knife, £51 and two flat axes, £52, 53. Continuing round the chamber to the NE corner were found an EG kalathos, nearly whole, 61, the remains of a MG pithos, 62 (later largely recomposed by the addition of fragments from the dromos nearby). This pithos partly covered the MG lekythos, 69, a nearly complete lid, 70, and most of a LPG PGB flask, 71. In the NE corner beneath these last was the shattered bucchero pithos, 81, with its lid, 81 a, other fragments of which came from the dromos deposit. Below again, right in the corner, was an EG kalathos lid, 118. In the E half of the tomb (still moving approximately clockwise), in the lower level of pottery, under the large pithoi 67, 68, were a small PGB oinochoe, 105, two cups, ioi, 104, a complete jug, 103 and a juglet 102. Towards the centre of the tomb were the two skyphoi, 97, 99, a cup, 100 and an oinochoe, 98, both complete. Slightly lower, three vases, in, 112, 120, were nested, aryballos in LG cup, itself in LG cup, respectively In the SW corner, over the floor, were a G coarse lid, 92, three MG and LG cups, 93, 96, 96a, a complete PGB/EG ribbed juglet, 95 and an Attic MG skyphos, 94. Just inside the doorway, on or near the floor, were the pedestal foot of a polychrome pithos, 1 165 a polychrome pithos base, 115, a complete olpe, 114, and a miniature cup, MG or earlier, 113. The remaining objects were chiefly just inside the doorway (iron javelin-head and axe-adze, £48, 49), near the chamber centre (iron dirk, iron pin, £54) or in the E half of the chamber. From E-W these were £39-41, pieces of gold foil, £43, a bronze fragment, £44, iron javelin-head and dirk, £j5, two javelin-heads and a dagger, £|6, spear socket and knife, £47, an obelos, £37, iron pin fragments, £36, iron axe, £35, a bronze spectacle fibula,f38, bronze rivet. A reused stone bore core, £j2 and a serpentine conulus were also found. Among the vases made up during post-excavation study from fragments found exclusively in the chamber fill were lids (141, 145, 152, 183), a kalathos (161), an aryballos (157), an oinochoe (201), a pyxis (207), a flask (200), two skyphoi (170 and 212), a kotyle (158), a jug (197) and four cups (167-169, 199). The upper niche was excavated as layer 7, coming at once on a group of vases - MG pithos 121, containing LG lid, 123, an O aryballos, 124, and a faience bead (L. 0.048) identified during study of the cremation. There, too, was the LG/EO pithos, 122, with lid, 175, two aryballoi, 127, 129, and a small oinochoe, 128; within this cremation a small fragment of glass was found during study. There were also three lids, 125-6, 131, and a complete cup, 130. This group had been placed in the upper niche after the construction of the dromos 'wall'; it might have been done either shortly before the burial of the final group of pithoi in the dromos fill, or at the same time as that burial. The lower niche was found disturbed much in the manner of the chamber; perhaps the two processes were connected. It was excavated as layer 7 - one basket. On the niche floor were the bases of two cremation pithoi, 133, 135. Other vases were a miniature skyphos, 132, a LG lid, 134 (believed to belong to 56) and a EG bell krater, 136. There were also two iron javelin-heads, £58, 59.</page><page sequence="129">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SI IL T. 75 nI POTTERY (PLATES 1 17 29) 1. POLYCHROME PITHOS. H. 37. DR. 19.8.

Head in the form of a rough disc, D. 0.9, surmounted by a small protuberance; below it a smaller, then a larger swelling, before the shaft begins. The head element has L. 1.8; the shaft, circular in section, is 6.2 in L. , tapering from a Max Th. of 0.5 (corroded) to the point. 70. IRON PIN. Three pieces, joining to form a complete pin, of the same type as 69, but slightly smaller. L. 7.6. Head as 69, but less corroded. Shaft, also less corroded, has Max. Th. of only 0.3 below head, tapering to point. 70a. IRON SWORD-BLADE fr. L. 5.2. W c. 2. Th. 0.6. A fr. only, from well down the blade of a sword or dirk. 70b. IRON SWORD frs. Six pieces, in the form of three joining pairs comprising parts of a large sword. The first two frs. join to make up most of the hilt; L. together 9.2, W. originally 3.6; massive flanges projecting on both sides to a total depth of 2; two iron rivets arranged longitudinally at the (second) neck. The next two, L. together 8.5, W. 3.6, Th. at midrib 0.8, come from the upper part of the blade, but do not join the hilt-fragment. The last two, together L. 10.2, arc from near the tip and are appreciably narrower. A substantial length must be missing from between the last two pairs of frs. The section of the blade is a symmetrical ellipse. The weapon belongs to the standard type of iron cut-and-thrust sword of the Aegean Early Iron Age; its original length will have exceeded 50 cms. 71. IRON OBELOI frs. Six pieces from at least two obeloi, not apparently joining. Two of the pieces show two lengths of separate obeloi, corroded together, (i) L. 7; (ii) two pieces, L. 5.8 in each case, corroded together; (iii) two pieces Ls. 5.2 and 3.9, corroded together; (iv) L. 5.7; (v) L. 4.4; (vi) L. 2.2. The sections are generally squarish, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 in thickness; but fr. (v), and the smaller corroded length in (iii), show a more elliptical shape of section. The total preserved length is thus 40, but divided between at least two obeloi. One fr. (L. 4.3) has mineralized remains of a wooden haft. 72. IRON SWORD(S) or DIRK(S), frs. Five pieces from blade(s) of one or more weapons. Ls. 4.2, 3.6, 2.5, 2.2, and 1.9. None of these seems to join, or belong to 70b above, being somewhat lighter. There is also a javelin socket and one fr. of miscellaneous scrap. Two of the frs. preserve mineralized wood remains. 73. IRON STRIP. Two non-joining frs., one (L. 10) composed of two joining pieces. L. of second, 5. Mineralized textile remains on all pieces. 74. IRON BALANCE-ROD (?) Eighteen pieces of a long, flat rod or strip, of which two at any rate join. Total L. 67.5; section rectangular, c. 0.5 X 0.2. One piece, L. 6.1, joins on to a further piece which forms a sharply-hooked terminal, bending c. 1.8 downwards and then c. 1 up again to a pointed end, as if for the suspension of a weight. 75. IRON DIRK or DAGGER frs. Five pieces, of which four join to form part of blade; the fifth is from the hilt (containing one iron rivet, of round section).</page><page sequence="140">I22 KNOSSOS THE N Blade pieces together, L. u.8; flat, narrow section.

The tomb - if such it were - was c. 3.00 N of T. 40, in the crowded SE sector of the area of the cemetery excavated in 1978. Its apparent orientation was N- S. Found as a shallow, irregular cutting in the kouskouras after the mechanical removal of the topsoil. If there were a dromos, it had been destroyed by two HL graves, Ts. 74 and 77, which in turn had been almost entirely removed. Five LG-O vases were assembled from sherds, including two pithoi, 1 and 4, so that if indeed a tomb, it had as least two interments. POTTERY (PLAÏ1-; 130) i. *COARSE NECKED PITHOS. DR. c. 36.

The burial was cut into, and parallel with, the E dromos wall of T. 112, one of a group of early chamber tombs in the congested S part of the cemetery area excavated in 1978. The orientation was SE-NW, the mouth of the pithos to the S. The pithos was found after the mechanical clearance of topsoil. The upper half was missing, and must have been carried away by the plough. The pithos contained the inhumed remains of an infant. Dr. Musgrave diagnoses 'a handful of unburnt skull frs. and developing rootless deciduous teeth of a baby 12-16 months. The lower left first molar was almost calcified and about to erupt'. Some of the skeletal remains and most of the grave goods were still in and around the surviving half. Near the pithos' mouth was the bull's protome, 12; 2, a miniature hydria, was to the W, partly under the base. 6, a fragmentary oinochoe, 4 and 7, cups, were beneath, and 3, a cup, was in it. 8, a jug, 9, a miniature kotyle, 10, a cup and 11, an oinochoe (?) fragment were assembled from sherds from T. 112's dromos nearby, and were probably also associated. All these were LG or LG-EO. Finds other than pottery give a distinct impression of the dead child. They include f26, a gilt-silver hair spiral and fu, a glass 'rod', possibly a hair pin, and a pair of electrum earrings, fi3, 14. The greater part of a necklace, f6, lay just within the pithos neck, consisting mainly of glass beads, with one of rock crystal and one of amber, fij), 30, amber beads, £28, faience bead, fi7, 22, pendants of rock crystal and silver, and perhaps ¿23, rock crystal inlay strip, though scattered, may also have come from it. fs3, 4, 9 and 10 were small scarabs. f8, 24 were faience figures of Nefertum, f2O a faience figure of Ptah-Seker. There were four bronze fibulae, fs 7, 12, 16 and 18 + 25 + 27. fsis, 21 were gold foil scraps, f^9 an obsidian blade. All these were in the pithos. f2, silver ring, from T. 112's dromos, more probably belonged to an unnumbered HL grave cut into the dromos than to the pithos burial. POTTERY (PLATE 130) 1.

The grave was a shallow, shield-shaped pit, rounded, but with a straight edge to the N. The hint of a dromos on the SW side is misleading. The grave was found at the N end of the dromos of T. 112, between T. 76 to the W and Ts. 149 and 157 to the E, in the congested S part of the cemetery. It had no obvious orientation. The grave was identified after mechanical clearance of topsoil as a dark head of soil within its kouskouras matrix. The cutting on the SW [supra) was probably the remains of an HL grave (infra). From the condition of the ash-urns in the upper part of the fill, it seems that the top of the grave must have been ploughed away. In the upper part of the pit, 1 was a large HL flask, attributable to the unnumbered grave mentioned supra. To the N was 4, a LG-EO pithos with pieces of a lid, 3, in it. NW was a LG skyphos, 8, and to its S, the LG oinochoe, 7. 0.20 SW of 4 was the O polychrome pithos 5, with an EO polychrome lid, 2, to its N and an EO jug, 6, to its E. On the W edge of the pit was the fragment of a LG- EO amphora, 9. Most of these vessels lay only 0.35 below ground surface. The likely associations place 7 and 8 with 4, 2 and 6 with 5. In the last 0.20 of fill were two small horses and two dogs, whose bones were in order, but difficult to disentangle as they were much decayed and squashed. The obvious remains were two horses' skulls (teeth had already appeared on the E of the area on which rested the pottery groups) represented mainly by teeth, one on the E side, one on the W. In the centre were ribs, nearer the W skull, while the arrangement of legs in the S part showed the head was retorted. The somewhat scattered bones of the dogs were in amongst the horses. The horse with its head (the W head) retorted may have been the first to be placed in the pit. If the cremations were successive, the horses would have belonged to the occupant of 4, the earlier of the urns. But 5 would have been very little later, and the interments might have been contemporary. POTTERY (PLATES 130-31) 1. *FLASK, HL. 2. POLYCHROME LID (fig. ioo). DR. 23.6. Chips on rim and knob.

The original form was indecipherable. The grave lay near the SW edge of the main group of DA tombs, immediately adjacent to T. 59, 2.owofT. 80 (HL). The grave was found when topsoil was stripped mechanically during the main search for DA tombs S of the N-S lines of chamber tombs (44-48-60-61 and 30-45-24-25-56). There had evidently been a small DA tomb of uncertain form in the design of which two stone blocks each 0.40 long (see FIG. 26) may have featured. Two inhumation graves, Ts. 80 (HL) and 81 (also HL), orientated roughly NW-SE, were dug 1.0 apart, of which the former cut into T 80 (DA). Further confusion may have been unwittingly caused in the mechanical removal of topsoil. To the DA grave belonged the EPG stirrup jar, 1 and the EPG neck amphora, 2. Bones from level 3 (one basket) are likely to have belonged to the HL inhumation. POTTERY (PEATE 132) i. STIRRUP JAR. PH. 16.5. Two-thirds preserved, base missing. Cream slip.

Stomion/ entrance (largely destroyed): 0.60-0.70 X 0.60. Chamber: 2.40 X 1.90 The dromos was unusual in being stepped, slightly wedge-shaped, and asymmetric at its mouth. It rose 1.86 from the approximate position of the stomion, in three roughly cut steps of unequal length, with a mean angle of rise of c. 20o. The stomion and its blocking wall had been replaced by an (unnumbered) HL grave cut, on the dromos axis, partly in the dromos, partly in the stomion. The chamber was irregularly cut askew to the dromos axis, with straight walls either side of the entrance, from which the side and back walls formed a continuous curve. The chamber floor was over 2.00 below modern ground surface. On the E side of the dromos, close to the stomion, was an irregularly cut niche, 1.30 wide, 0.60 deep, its floor 1.00 higher than the surface of the dromos.</page><page sequence="145">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE Ts. 79 80, 82 l2y The tomb was close S of the N- S line of tombs 30-45-24-25-56, its chamber 4.00 from the chamber of T. 56, on the unusual orientation NNE-SSW, with its chamber on the N side, an arrangement otherwise only even approximately matched by T. 28, in the SE group. The tomb was found during mechanical topsoil stripping in the area s of the two chief N-s ranks of chamber tombs, when it first appeared as a head of dark soil within the white kouskouras matrix. It had been thoroughly pillaged, almost certainly when the HL grave was dug into the dromos and stomion. Other HL/R graves had further slighted it. T 83 had been dug over the chamber (though its floor did not penetrate it), while Ts. 143, 144 and 193 were cut into the dromos filling, at right angles to it. Dromos and chamber were first dug as a single level - layer 2 (one basket), of brown soil and kouskouras. The lower dromos fill formed layer 3 (one basket) at the bottom of which was 4, a large HL black-glaze bottle, making explicit the nature of disturbance in the stomion and adjacent dromos. In the chamber, layer 3 (one basket) contained potsherds and human bones in disarray, perhaps from the burial in the stomion. That the whole tomb has been turned completely upside-down was shown by layer 4 (two baskets) which overlay the floor of the chamber and stomion. This largely consisted of kouskouras with a little brown soil and quantities of tile as well as bone (including skull fragments), remains, no doubt, of the HL burial in the stomion. From the DA use of the tomb there survived a polychrome pithos, 1, at the back of the chamber, another, 2, close to the stomion, and an O nipple jug, 3, found in fragments in the fill. The dromos niche was empty, apart from a few coarse sherds, and bone fragments. Layers 3 and 4 contained Late Classical sherds including part of an Attic RF pelike - (B) - youths. There were no small finds of interest - numerous scraps of glass and pieces of sheet bronze were recovered. POTTERY (PLATE 132) 1. POLYCHROME PITHOS (fig. 99). PH. 32. DB. 1 1.5.

Within were two parallel rectangular compartments, c. 0.50 apart, of which the S was shallower and shorter than the N, allowing the indented corner of the outer cutting. The feature was found 3.00-4.00 SW of T. 14, c. 2.00 from the S circuit of the perimeter wall of the mortuary church, in an area somewhat isolated from the main group of tombs, to the N of the most congested part of the cemetery. The longer axis of the cutting was orientated E-W. The feature was identified after mechanical clearance of topsoil. The earth in the cutting above the compartments was brown and rubbly, suggesting pit-fill. It contained lumps of white plaster, a piece of marble facing and other church debris, and large, coarse sherds, including larnax frs. In the compartments themselves the earth was a rich light brown and exceptionally soft, unlike anything else on the site. There was nothing in the S compartment, but in the N were sherds of a LG pithos, 2, and from a LM III B larnax, 1. Nothing was really in situ, but several larnax sherds, including one with a handle, were right in the NE corner, while the urn sherds were towards the centre. In the SW corner of the compartment was a stone resting on the floor, and nearby what may have been a larnax foot in situ. The two compartments, therefore, may once have contained larnakes.

What remained was little more than a round pit; the original grave type was indecipherable. The pit floor was 1.00 below modern ground surface. The grave formed part of a confused group of tombs, including the SM chamber-tomb T. 121, and the HL/R inhumation graves Ts. 54, 96, 115 and 117 near the SE limit of the main group of HL/R graves, that had been sited in the area left vacant by the main N-S and E-W series of DA tombs. T. 86 may have been the earliest feature in the complex, for its circumference seems to have been cut by the corner of T 121 's dromos. The top filling (layer 1, one basket) was chiefly light brown soil, with kouskouras over a jumbled mass of stone (including broken dressed stone), mixed with R and Ch pottery The rubble was removed as layer 2 (three baskets) including brick, tile and pithos fragments as well as stone. The soil darkened as digging advanced. A large flat stone slab was removed; many fragments of Archaic pithoi were found. On the floor of the pit was fi, a bronze tracer, or graver. Also on the floor were slight remains of a human skeleton, including both upper arms, a collar bone and trace of the rib cage. With these were f2 (iron knife fragments) and Í3 (bronze pin). It seems the grave was found and largely emptied, perhaps at the time of building the mortuary church (when much of the skeleton was destroyed). It was subsequently refilled with building debris and debris from destroyed DA and later graves, probably including Archaic pithos graves. SMALL FINDS 1.

All shapeless - collected from the pyre? Tombs 98, 106, 113, 152, 163, 168 introduction This complex was exceptionally difficult to understand. The problems represented by the tombs' immediate juxtaposition was aggravated by the manner in which they had been cut into and built over by three HL/R inhumation graves (Ts. i6i, 162 and 167), and two R periboloi (Ts. 124, 156). At first sight, the DA tombs seem to divide into no more than three units - (1) Ts. 98 + 106 + 168, forming a large chamber tomb with stepped dromos and two very large side-chambers to E (T. 168) and w (T. 98). (2) T. 152, just cutting the N side of T. 106's dromos and the w side of T. 168's chamber. (3) T. 163, the latest in the series, dug over the top of the collapsed chambers of Ts. 162 and 168. Closer inspection makes it almost certain this explanation would be wrong. There are, in fact, five distinct DA graves - Ts. 98, 168, 106, 152 and 163, in order of construction. The place of the larnax burial, T. 113, in the sequence is unknown.</page><page sequence="148">!30 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY T. 98 seems to have been a sub-rectangular shaft dug into stereo; its primary use was SM (deposit over floor), but its type is uncertain. On one explanation it could have been a large pit-cave (cf. Ts. 186, 200-202), whose 'cave' was expunged when T. 106's dromos was cut. T. 168, a very irregular cutting in stereo, confused by Ts. 152 and 153, may originally have been a chamber tomb on the same general axis as Ts. 106 and 152, whose dromos and stomion were entirely subsumed by the subsequent cutting of T. 152, and the S side of whose chamber wall was broken into when the dromos of T 106 was cut. T. 106 was constructed after Ts. 98 and 168, handsomely designed with a facade at the stomion, and a stepped dromos. During its life, its large chamber was divided in two by a clumsy wall, perhaps inserted as shoring to avert roof-fall. T. 152 was cut later than T. 106, on a line several degrees off parallel, shaving off the NW corner of T. 106's dromos, and destroying part of T 168's chamber and, perhaps, its dromos and stomion [supra). T 163, probably no more than a large pit, was dug into the space over what must already have been the fallen chamber roofs of Ts. 152 and 168. T 163 contained the remains of a horse burial, other parts of which were recovered from Ts. 152 and 168, while further bones came from the intrusive HL Ts. 161, 162. The horse burial recalls the horse burials of T. 79, less than 10 m away to the NE, and the similar feature adjacent to Teke T.F, some distance to the N. T. 113 (larnax) was found over the top of the chamber fill of T. 106. It is not certain that it was in situ. So much for the internal sequence of this complex, and the damage mutually caused. The next round of damage came in HL and R times. Ts. 161 and 162 were dug into T. 163, seriously dislocating the horse burial; T. 162 must have continued across part of the dromos of T 106. It. may have been as a sequel to the digging of these graves that T. 152 was completely robbed of its contents by a rectangular pit down the N side of T. 106's dromos, breaking into the S side of T. 152's chamber. Nearby, T 167 cut into the S edge of T. 98. Finally, the second century AD burial periboloi Ts. 124 and 156 were built, the former over the W end of the dromoi of Ts. 106 and 152, the latter over T. 98 and, in the process, over T. 167 as well. Tomb 98 SE (figs. 5, 34; plate 24 c) (See Introduction: Ts. 98, 106, 113, 152, 163, 168) At floor level, 2.86 X 2.40 As preserved, this was a large pit, with straight sides, rectangular in plan except at its rounded SW corner. It appeared connected to the dromos of T. 106 by an opening 0.80 wide, at least 0.70 high, clumsily blocked by three rather irregular stone slabs. Nothing suggested the cutting had ever been roofed; on the contrary, it seems to have been cut straight down from the surface through stereo to reach its floor level (c. 1.80 below modern ground surface). This pit may once have been part of a SM pit-cave (cf. e.g. T. 186) whose 'cave' was sliced off when T. 106's dromos was cut. The grave was at the heart of the most congested area of the necropolis, close to several others with evidence of SM use. Its axis is roughly NNE-SSW. The complex of which it was part was identified following mechanical topsoil stripping of the main N-S ranks of chamber tombs. It was found in a very confused state, and not all its features can be explained satisfactorily. Remains of an undisturbed SM deposit over the floor, however, dates the first use and convincingly establishes its priority in the complex. Among the intrusions that contributed to the difficulty of interpreting this grave was the small R períbolos T. 156 partly cut into the fill, overlying the ER grave T 167, also partly dug into T. 98's fill.</page><page sequence="149">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 98 !3! Layer 1 (two baskets) was the uppermost fill of brown soil and kouskouras, and some bone fragments. Here 1, an isolated miniature HL vase, raised an unconfirmed suspicion that there had been an HL inhumation cut into the top of the pit, subsequently destroyed by later disturbance. At 0.25 into the fill, a large part of a coarse pithos, 2, was found with the complete O oinochoe, 3, nearby. In the same horizon were {3 (cow's tooth) and i^ (crumpled scrap of gold leaf). This could be the remains of a pithos burial that has been inserted into the pit fill, or, equally likely, a displaced pithos burial part of which ended up in the top fill. Layer 2 (one basket), brown soil and lumpy crushed kouskouras, contained most of a second coarse pithos, 21, and several objects which it had presumably once contained - f$ (bronze Pfibula), f7, 9 (fragments of bronze), ff65 10, 11 (fragments of gold sheet) and £8 (gold leaf). This group was 0.50 into the fill. There were signs of disturbance; the N half of the fill was softer than the kouskouras fill in the S. Three more baskets from layer 2 came from what may have been a robber pit on the E side, which extended as far as the floor, behind the blocking that separated T 98 from the dromos of T. 106, and in the NE corner where T. 98 and T. 106 (chamber) slightly overlapped (the former cut by the latter). Here was 4a, a LG/EO cup. At this point, Ts. 156 and 167 were successively excavated as intrusions. When work was resumed on T. 98, on the remaining fill in the s half of the pit, three isolated skulls were found (layer 2, one basket) at depths of 0.84, 0.72 and 0.90 respectively. Their presence is unexplained. Layer 4 (two baskets) was an apparently undisturbed area of reworked kouskouras excavated in the S part of the pit. From its contents of broken vases, five SM- EPG pieces were largely reconstructed - a bowl, 9, two stirrup jars, 10, 20, and two neck-handled amphorae, 11, 12. Of uncertain context are several larnax fragments on the floor of the pit, against the S wall, 19. Certainly two, perhaps three larnakes were represented. POTTERY (PLATE 133) 1.

The dromos rose at an angle of 90 from the stomion for a distance of 2.00,</page><page sequence="151">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 98, 100 I33 thereafter to the mouth at n°; the mouth was 2.10 higher than the lowest part of the chamber floor. The stomion was damaged, and no blocking remained in situ, though loose stones were found in the stomion and dromos; one appeared to have been worked with a toothed chisel. In front of the stomion a shallow step 0.20 led down to the stomion and chamber; this may have been the seating for the blocking wall. The chamber was sub-circular in plan. Though the roof was completely destroyed the rear wall survived 1.16 high. The chamber floor was 2.75 below modern surface. The tomb was at the N extremity of the three main groups of DA chamber-tombs in the central part of the necropolis, 12.00 N of T. 44, the nearest with which it could be said to be in line. The orientation was close to E-w. It was found as a head of dark soil within its kouskouras matrix after the removal of topsoil by mechanical means. The tomb had suffered great damage from the construction of the nearby mortuary church and its ossuaries. The W circuit of the enclosure wall of the church was constructed over the fill of the chamber, the built ossuary T. 191 was partly dug into the N side of the dromos and a second ossuary, T 158, was immediately parallel to the s side of the dromos. The dromos and chamber fills were a homogeneous mixture of soil, kouskouras and finds of many periods. At the mouth of the dromos was a coarse pithos, 6, an oinochoe, 7, and a coarse jug, 9, perhaps once in the chamber. Ten baskets of pottery, etc, were collected from this disturbed horizon. A skull and a coin (fi) at the W end of the dromos hint at a destroyed HL/R inhumation; a fragment of glass, f2, was found nearby. Fragments of glass, bronze and mosaic tesserae were distributed over the whole area of the tomb. Along the S dromos wall, between 2.50 and 3.50 from the stomion, a belly-handled amphora, 1 + 2, and a coarse-ware tripod cauldron, 3, lay on the dromos surface, whither they had been moved from the chamber. Later pottery and a glass fragment were also found in the lower dromos fill. From the fill over the chamber came a glass bottle (fia) and an iron fragment (fza). The chamber's contents were in great disorder, and there were signs of late material down to its floor. Nothing was in situ. £3, an iron obelos fragment, was 0.44 above the floor. Close by were fragments of a bronze rod-tripod (£4). A glass vessel (£5) and a bronze coin (£6) only 0.30 above the floor confirm the disturbance of the fill at that level, where a small faience whorl (£7), another bronze tripod fragment (£8), an iron obelos fragment (£9) and an iron knife with bronze rivet (fio) were also found, all of them, except fio, in the N half of the tomb. Many sherds were recovered. Still lower in the chamber fill, in the S half, were fu, a stamped loom-weight, a faience bead, fi6, and four iron objects: obelos fragments (fi3, 15), a knife (fi2) and a javelin-head (fi4). Across the floor fragments of bronze and iron weapons were strewn. In the N part were fi7, an iron javelin-blade, fi8, 20, fragments of iron knives, and fi9, part of an iron obelos. More fragments of the bronze rod tripod (f2i-23) were found at the back of the chamber. In the SW corner were a large piece of thick sheet bronze, £24, under which was £27, a faience bead, and £25, 26, two iron javelins. 4, a kalathos, lay against the N wall and there was a bell- skyphos, 5, by the entrance. At the centre of the chamber was an area of disc-shaped faience beads, £28 (cf. fi6, 27), and at the back, another spear-point. Many fragments of bronze were collected, as well as another piece of the rod tripod, £30. With the possible exception of the two groups of vases found in the dromos, no individual interments were recognized. The scattered finds suggest there had been both male and female interments.</page><page sequence="152">!34 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY POTTERY (PLATES 134-8) 1. BELLY-HANDLED AMPHORA. H. 45.4.

Tombs 104 and 134 introduction These two contiguous graves must be considered closely together. There is some uncertainty about their original form, which has no obvious counterpart in the cemetery. The analysis offered here differs from that made at the time of excavation, and one or two of the finds which were excavated as part of T. 104 are now seen to have belonged to T. 134. The complex lay in the SE part of the site. Each tomb appears to have consisted of a substantial but rather irregular chamber, perhaps originally roofed at least in part, opening from which, again in each case, were two niches, on opposite sides of the chambers. The niches of T. 134 were sealed by masonry, and contained the interments and their offerings. The niches in T. 104 were smaller, unsealed and empty of offerings, the mass of which occupied the floor of the chamber. The two tombs had been cut so close to each other that the W side of T. 104's chamber cut the E side of T. 134. The damage was made good by the</page><page sequence="157">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE Ts. ioo, 103 4 ^9 construction of a rough masonry partition between the two. T. 104 proved to have been very thoroughly disturbed in antiquity {infra), not only by the (unnumbered) HL inhumation grave that cut deep into its N side, destroying a part of the grave offerings. On this analysis, T. 134 is earlier, by however brief a period, than T. 104. It is possible that there may have originally been a single grave enclosure for these two tombs and for Ts. 135 and 159 as well (q.v.). Tomb 104 SE (figs. 6, 37; plate 25) See Introduction: Ts. 104, 134 L. overall: 2.80. 'Chamber' w (to partition): 1.08. NW niche: 0.40 X 0.25. SE niche: 0.76 X 0.60. The grave comprised a roughly oval 'chamber', to which niches were attached on opposite sides of the long axis, of which the S niche was larger and better formed than the N. The N side of the 'chamber' comprised a roughly built stone blocking, L. 1.75 (of which the largest stone was a slab 0.95 X 0.35) separating this chamber from T. 134, into which T. 104 had inadvertently cut in construction. An area 1.20 X 0.70 of the floor of the 'chamber' was paved with small stone slabs. It is unknown whether the whole floor had been covered. The surface soil had been removed mechanically. This tomb and T. 134 were identified when subsequent surface cleaning by hand revealed a shapeless head of dark soil within the white kouskouras matrix. The approximate orientation was NNW-SSE. An (unnumbered) HL inhumation grave on a N-S axis had been partly dug into the upper filling of the 'chamber', causing considerable damage. If 103, from the 'chamber' floor has been correctly identified as an Archaic vase, there must have been a major disturbance of this otherwise pre-O complex before the intrusion of the HL burial. Layer 1, the upper filling, was a light brown soil mixed with roots and small stones. A LG pithos, 3, was found near the SE niche; an aryballos, 7, was among its contents. A second LG pithos, 4, was found near the NW niche with, inside it, a Cypriot BoR lekythos, 8, and two iron pin shafts, £9-10; two more pin fragments, joining, were identified during study of the cremation. Under 4 were a LG cup, 5, and a LG kotyle, 9. Immediately under 3 lay an EG belly-handled amphora, 12, on its side with an E-MG skyphos, 13, in its mouth. Beside the neck of 12 was an EO straight-sided pyxis, 20 with 114 (LG jug) and 115 (MG olpe) inside it. The large EG belly-handled amphora, 23, was on its side near the stone partition, midway between the two niches. The larger of these vases lay partly in a harder, lighter soil with more kouskouras (layer 2) and partly in the rubbly level (layer 3). The uppermost vases in the main area of offerings in this very crowded grave were much disturbed by the intrusive HL burial, whose presence was not immediately appreciated in the first stages of excavation, as there were large fragments of G vases in what must have been the upper part of the HL grave shaft, above and helping to conceal the skeleton, including 44, fragment of a ?MG pithos base, and 14, an animal protome fragment. The HL burial, of which skull and long bones survived, had been extended on the back, head at the NW end of the grave. f$, a silver coin of Rhodes, or a Cretan imitation, had been placed in the mouth. Several vases (a larger number and more varied than customary in this cemetery's HL burials) were in close proximity to the skeleton but, because of the way the burial had been made, also in close proximity to the G pottery. Not all were immediately recognized as HL. They included 15 + 21, 31, 50 and 53. In the fill ofthat part of the HL tomb that extended beyond the limits of the DA tomb were found 45 and 46, M-LG juglet</page><page sequence="158">I4.0 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY and aryballos respectively, which must have been thrown up in digging the HL grave and then replaced when it was back-filled after the deposition of the body. The same happened to a bronze fibula, fi. The full effect on the DA grave offerings of the HL intrusion cannot be reconstructed, particularly as the extant profile of the grave within the DA filling was not defined at the time of excavation. However, it is clear that the grave cut in half n, a LG neck-handled amphora (the lower part lost), while an EO pyxis, 41, was sliced in two where it stood. Only fragments remained of an EG belly-handled amphora, 16, and a PGB/EG oinochoe, 51. Nearby was the bronze pin, £3. Other DA vases very narrowly missed damage - 17, a PGB-EG straight- sided lekythos, 18-19, two MG skyphoi, nested. In the narrow space between the left side of the skeleton and the edge of the grave (in approximate order N-s) were 40, EO pyxis, with 42, PGB-EG lekythos, inside, 28, EG skyphos, with the PGB lekythos, 55 inside. Underneath were 54, EG cauldron-skyphos, 43, PGB carinated oinochoe, 36, EG olpe, 22, PGB strainer, 35, E-MG skyphos, 30, EO pyxis lid, 43, LG tray, 33, PGB-EG lid, 49, EG skyphos and 52, small MG cup. The heterogeneity of shapes and dates must be noted. There were few vases in this horizon in the larger space between the right side of the HL grave and the partition - 26, pithos fragment, 27, LG neck-handled amphora, 47, MG skyphos, 48, M-LG juglet and 57, E-MG skyphos (under 26). The removal of the HL burial and the horizon of DA vases into which it had been dug showed that layer 3, now less rubbly, continued and covered another large group of vases. This deposit was in two parts, the N, occupying the NW niche and adjacent space, extending to the area over which the HL burial had lain, and a second, smaller group starting at the mouth of the SE niche and extending N. Two vessels, the smaller EG lekythos 79 and the PGB lekythos 80, lay in the otherwise empty space of 0.80 between these two groups. The foot of a plain larnax (not inventoried) lay at the N end of the second group which otherwise consisted of 81, a G coarse jug, 82, 83, 86, PGB and EG lekythoi, 84, PGB lekythos, 85, EG tray, 87, 88, E-MG cups, 89, EG omphaloid lid. In the N niche group over 20 vases were clustered- 59, 59a, pyxis, and lid, 60, EG kalathos, 61, LG cup, 58, LG neck-handled amphora, 62, 65, 68-76, M/LG juglets, 63, 64, 66, 67, MG skyphoi, 77, MG skyphos and 78, MG small hydria. A final series of 24 vases (chiefly small) was found under the cluster just described, packed into the niche and the floor space in front of it. Of importance for the tomb's history {supra) is the shattered 103, apparently an Archaic neck-handled amphora. The other vases were 90, 91, MG-LG small hydriae, 92, 93, 97, 98, 102, in, M-LG juglets, 94, 100, no, 112, MG or M-LG oinochoai, 95, 105-109, MG skyphoi, 96, 101, 113, LG cups. 116-129 were identified and inventoried during post-excavation study.

Traces of a cutting in the kouskouras may have been the remains of a chamber-tomb. Found on the w edge of the complex at the SE part of the cemetery of which Ts. 104 and 134 were the major elements. The apparent orientation was E by s- W by N. Fragments of G vases were recovered. Tomb 106 SW (figs. 5, 33, 34, 35; plate 26) (See Introduction: Ts. 98, 106, 113, 152, 163, 168) L. overall: 7.70 (at least). Dromos: L. 4.95 (at least). W. 1.10-1.35. Stomion: W. 0.70. 0.50 deep, c. 1. 00 high. Stomion facade: W. 1.50. H. 1.30 (at least). Chamber: W. 2.56. Depth 2.25. The dromos was somewhat obscured by the intrusion of other tombs and a robber pit, but it seems to have been wedge-shaped. It probably extended w beyond the point observed, but this was obscured by the R períbolos, T. 124. From the stomion the dromos was level for a distance of 2.40, then rose a vertical distance of 0.90 in a horizontal distance of 1.35 at a mean angle of 35o. The dromos ended at a carefully constructed facade cut in the kouskouras in the centre of whose vertical face was the well preserved stomion with blocking in situ, of which the largest stone was a flat slab 0.75 X 0.44, set on edge. At each angle between the dromos and the facade, cut into it, was a vertical recess 0.10 wide, 0.04 deep. The function of these recesses is uncertain; they could have been settings for some kind of wooden framework. There was a step 0.08 high from the dromos onto the stomion, and a step 0.25 down from the stomion into the very neatly cut rectilinear chamber, probably the largest found in the necropolis. The tomb was at the centre of the most congested part of the necropolis, on its s side. The orientation was ESE-WNW, with the chamber on the E side. The tomb was gradually identified and interpreted during excavation of the complex of which it formed a part, following mechanical clearing of topsoil. It was much disturbed by the intense funerary activity which had taken place in its immediate vicinity, just as it had, in its turn, intruded on neighbouring tombs. A robbing pit, 1.50 X 0.50, had been dug against and into the N wall of the dromos, from which T. 152 (q.v.) had been entered and pillaged. The upper dromos fill had been cut by the HL/R inhumation T 162. The S side of the dromos had probably subsumed part of the earlier T. 98 (if that grave has been correctly identified as a pit grave). There was in any event, a blocked opening giving access to T. 98 from the dromos. On the N side, close to the stomion, the dromos had cut into the chamber of T 168 (which was first identified as a side-chamber of T. 106). The breach was neatly repaired by stone and mud- bricks; the largest of the latter was 0.70 X 0.44 X 0.15. The loss of the chamber roof gives point to the presence in the chamber, on its E-W axis, of a crudely built shoring wall, suggesting that efforts were early made to avert a foreseen roof collapse. The SW corner of the</page><page sequence="164">!46 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY chamber had just clipped the NE corner of T. 98. Over the top of the collapsed chamber was the fragmentary larnax, T. 113 (q.v.). The dromos filling, layer 2, was relatively sterile hard brown soil made lumpy by its content of kouskouras. There was little pottery; no pots or finds were inventoried, nor were any subsequently recomposed; sherds included fragments of several G and O pithoi. After T. 113 (q.v.) had been recorded, the upper fill of the chamber was removed as layer 2, in which some fragments of bone and a miniature HL vase may point to an otherwise destroyed HL tomb, fi was a fragment of iron. Layer 3 was a harder version of the same kind of fill, in which a pyxis, 2, a krateriskos, 3, and a LG/EO cup, 4, were found, at 0.45, while a line of rough masonry appeared at 0.40, extending from the inside of the stomion to the back wall of the chamber. Three or four loose stones in the fill on the s side of this 'wall' may once have formed part of it. The 'wall' stood at 0.60-0.70 high, and rested on a lower chamber fill, not on the chamber floor. More objects were found in the fill either side of the shoring 'wall', including fragments of a larnax at 0.80 (SE quadrant), a R tile fragment, a worked stone block, two small schist slabs and, in the NE quadrant, much broken pottery. A Creto-Cypriot lekythos, 5, was found at 0.75. Following the removal of the shoring 'wall', another large larnax fragment was found protecting 6 and 7, E-MG cup and M-LG juglet respectively. The lowest part of the chamber fill, layer 3, contained more kouskouras. On the floor, and in layer 3 were several finds - 8, a cup, and 9, part of a polychrome pithos in the centre of the chamber, underlying the shoring wall, the rest of which was found in the NE corner of the chamber. A group of vases came from the SE corner of the chamber, including 10 and 11, two LG cups, and three smashed vases just at the point where the chamber corner cut into T. 98-12, a polychrome lid, 13, an aryballos, and 14, another lid. Close to the E wall, on the floor were an EO oinochoe, 15, part of a Creto-Cypriot oinochoe, 16, a kotyle, 17, a cup, 18, and an Attic LG skyphos. Close to the S wall was the LG anthropomorphic vase, 20, while the lekythos, 21, was on the opposite side of the tomb. £3, a large iron sword, lay close to the stomion; the iron piece, £5, was also found near by.

Tomb 107 W (figs. 4, 38; plate 27) L. overall: 8.85. Dromos: L. 6.55. W. 0.80-0.90. Stomion: completely destroyed. Chamber: 1.98 X 1.90. The dromos, whose original shape was obscured by the diversity of niches either side, was too narrow for its length. It rose in an even gradient of 70 from chamber to surface. No trace remained of the stomion or its blocking. The chamber as found, oval in plan, was unusual in being almost as deep as broad. The roof was lost. The back wall was preserved to a height of 0.64; the chamber floor was 2.45 below modern ground surface. There were three niches of very uneven shape and size on each side of the dromos, numbered clockwise 1-6, starting with the niche in the NW dromos face (FIG. 38). Niche 1 - sub-rectangular - 1.10 wide, up to 0.68 deep, floor 0.48 below modern surface, up to 0.60 above dromos surface. Niche 2 - irregular sub-rectangular - 1.95 wide, up to 1.28 deep, floor 1.65 below modern surface, up to 0.40 above dromos surface. The E end cut by niche 3. Niche 3 - sub-rectangular - 1.20 wide, up to 0.35 deep, floor level not recorded. Niche 4 - round - 0.90 at opening, greatest width 1.24, 1. 00 deep, floor 1.40 below modern surface, up to 0.70 above dromos surface. Niche 5 - oval - 0.54 wide at opening, greatest width 0.60, 1.00 deep, floor 0.84 below surface, up to 1.00 above dromos surface. Niche 6 - rectangular - 0.96 wide, 1.00 deep, floor 0.60 below modern surface, up to 0.75 above dromos surface.</page><page sequence="167">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 106-7 149 The tomb is one of an apparently isolated N-S group of four (75-107-132-129) in the W centre of the cemetery orientated E by S- W by N, a few degrees, that is, off the orientation of the main banks of tombs at the heart of the site. The chamber was on the E side. The tomb was first seen as a shapeless head of dark soil within the white kouskouras matrix after the surface of the stereo had been cleaned by hand, following mechanical clearance of the topsoil. While chamber and dromos showed every sign of repeated disturbance, some of the niches contained undisturbed groups of cremation pithoi and associated vases. In niche 1, very close to modern surface, was found in situ, the floor of a terracotta larnax, 215. Assuming an original minimum height of 0.50 for this object and, further, that its niche will have been hollowed in to the natural kouskouras from the face of the dromos, it is clear there has been gross erosion of the hill profile since the DA, at least on this side of the site. In the dromos on the edge of niche 3, 2, a fragmentary HL bottle suggest an otherwise destroyed HL inhumation grave cut into the dromos fill, perhaps removed by erosion. The tomb had evidently been in very regular use. Thirty-three cremation pithoi, two coarse pithoi and two larnakes represent a minimum of thirty-seven interments in a period extending from PGB/EG to LO. Layer 1, the first level in the dromos (familiar mixture of brown soil and crushed kouskouras) hinted at a disturbed tomb. Outside niche 5 was 3, part of a coarse pithos; high in the fill were a cup, 1, a bronze scrap, fi, and 2, the HL intrusion referred to supra. Layer 2, a second level of dromos fill, yielded four baskets of pottery , some of the fragments of which were subsequently found to join pieces from the disturbed chamber fill. Among inventoried finds were 5, LG-EO skyphos fragments, £2, a glazed pebble, £5, 7, fragments of bronze, and £6, a scarab of Egyptian blue. In part of the dromos, this level overlay a harder deposit of generally similar character, layer 3, which seems to have been a fragment of undisturbed dromos fill, containing little pottery (which included a larnax fragment), none of which joined the enormous quantities of fragments from layers 2, 4, 6 and 7. There were several bronze objects in layer 3 - pin, fu, rivet-head, fi3, a fibula, fi2, and a sheet scrap, £38. Elsewhere layer 2 overlay a more disturbed level, layer 4, which contained much broken pottery, among which were several cross-joins with layers 2, 6 and 7. In the dromos, near the chamber, some fallen stone might have belonged to the stomion blocking. Here were 64, a nearly complete MG pithos, and fna, a piece of R glass, as a reminder of the tomb's disturbed condition. Also in this layer were fg, glazed pebble, and fio, bronze pin. Layer 6 overlay the dromos floor in front of the chamber, a disturbed level containing quantities of broken pottery having cross-joins with layers 2, 4, and 7 - especially the latter. Layer 6 contained patches of dark ashy soil, fragments of bone and broken pieces of bronze. There were also a few pieces of the shattered Minoan larnax most of which was in niche 2. Also in the layer were a broken glass bead, fi4, an iron knife fragment, fi, and a small gold pendant in the form of a bee fi6. Layer 7, the chamber fill, though disturbed, was quite hard earth mixed with kouskouras, with much broken pottery and a number of complete, or nearly complete vases. (Fourteen baskets of pottery were collected.) Several pockets of ashy soil and cremated bone were identified, doubtless the erstwhile contents of destroyed cremation pithoi. With one such pocket was found a bronze fibula, £20, a scrap of iron, £43, a bronze pin fragment, £44 and a clay bead, £45. In the chamber mouth were fi8, a clay animal protome and fig, a bronze fibula. Nearby were 65a, base of an O pithos, 66, cup, and 67, Creto-Cypriot lekythos. Level with the approximate original position of the stomion and just inside the chamber were 68, aryballos, 6g, small LG/EO pyxis, 70, fragmentary EO amphora, 71, M-LG juglet, 72, Attic MG II pyxis, 73, LG skyphos, 74, bucchero skyphos, and 75, lekythos. With these was</page><page sequence="168">!50 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY an iron obelos fragment, £22. Further into the chamber, not immediately over the floor, were more larnax fragments, with pieces of bone, scraps of bronze, a clay whorl, £23, a pair of bronze tweezers, £24, and an iron dirk hilt, £25. Nearer the floor were a clay whorl, £26, a whetstone, £27, part of an iron knife, £28, two iron spearheads oxidized together, £29, obelos fragments, £30, and the socket of an iron javelin-head, £31. The EO pictorial pyxis, 76, was found in scattered fragments near a fragmentary dirk and part of an obelos, £33. In the final skin of fill over the tomb floor were two iron arrowheads, £34, 35, a MG skyphos, 77, an E M G oinochoe, 81, and the lower part of a jug, 82, with a clay whorl, £36, and an iron spearhead and obelos fragments. From the large amounts of potsherds collected in layer 7, over a hundred vases in varying degrees of completeness were subsequently recomposed, the fragments of seventy of which came exclusively from layer 7, the others from two, three and even four levels. Such reconstructions vary from the very large EG straight-sided pithos, 178, found in seventeen separate lots from four layers, and the PGB Potnia pithos 114, found in twenty- two separate lots from four layers, to the LG black cup 156 found in a single lot from a single layer. In what has been described so far clearly only layer 3 had escaped very thorough disturbance. The evidence of the niches presents a somewhat different picture. Niche 1 and its fragmentary larnax have already been described supra, where it was seen that what remained of the larnax was still in situ. Niche 2 was the largest, which had been cut 0.80 longer than the LM III Ai larnax, 214, whose fragments were found in it, much disturbed (excavated as part of layer 6). With it was a large iron pinhead, £17. High up in the fill of this niche, towards its W end, was the O pithos, 24, containing a LO aryballos, 25 (apparently in situ), with the EO hydria with bull's head spout, 8, lying immediately on top. This juxtaposition of pillaged and unpillaged deposits in the same niche is difficult to explain, except by assuming that interments of cremation pithoi continued to be made in the ancillary areas of a tomb, the greater part of which must have been known to be wrecked. Niche 3 seems to have been cut for the coarse pithos, 4, little more than the ghost of which was found lying on its side, mouth to the E. Niche 4, in which layers 2 and 5 were identified, was packed tight with forty cremation pithoi and accompanying vases. These were part of an EO pithos, 26, with the EO aryballos, 35, inside it, and EO polychrome pithos, 27, its lid, 38, and a lekythos-alabastron, 37, found inside it. 28 + 31 was an EO polychrome pithos and lid, inside which six more vases were found - a second lid, 39, O polychrome, three aryballoi, 41, 42, 86, a straight-sided aryballos, 40, and a Creto-Cypriot lekythos, 87. During study of the cremation in 28 a pinhead fragment was found, and part of a bone or ivory pin, L. 0.079. The O pithos 29, which joined 26, contained seven vases among its cremated bone - a lid, 465 lekythos, 43, small oinochoe, 44, miniature pyxis, 45, a MPC plastic vase (hare), 47, a miniature oinochoe, 48, and a cup, 49. The LG pithos and lid, 30 + 32, contained two LG-EO Creto-Cypriot lekythoi, 33-4, and a LG aryballos, 51. The material so far described rested on a second group that stood on the niche floor - 50, an O pithos, 52, a skyphos covering 53, a Creto- Cypriot lekythos, a kotyle, 54, a LO polychrome pithos, 57, lids, 58, 60, an EO pyxis, 59, containing an aryballos, 88, two oinochoai, 61-2, a cup, 63, and many fragments of a cylindrical Pglass bead, identified during study of the cremation. The crowded contents of Niche 5 were excavated as part of layer 2. Thirteen cremation pithoi and accompanying vases were found, made up of the EO pithos and lid, 6 + 7, inside which, among the cremated bones, were an aryballos, 9, and a skyphos, 85. 10 was part of an EO coarse straight-sided pithos, 1 1 (in which study of the cremation showed there had been</page><page sequence="169">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 107 ^i an obsidian blade, 0.011 X 0.008), part of a closed vase, 12, a pithos with lid inside, 23, and a bucchero aryballos, 22. A third pithos, 13, contained a polychrome lid, 83, and the EO bucchero aryballos, 21. 14 was a jug. A bronze pin fragment, f3, and a bronze fragment, f4, were also found. The large niche 6, also excavated as part of layer 2, was empty save a group of six small or miniature vases - mug, 15, small olpe, 16, small hydria, 17, lekanis, 18, cup, 19, and pyxis, 20.

Handle barred, the bars continuing to the lower limit of the body decoration. Under each handle, three fish in triple outline, and with various fillings for body; head marked off by curved bands; circles for eyes, open mouths. Figured scenes: A, nature goddess standing on wheeled platform between two trees with spiral branches. She wears a tall checked polos with upper fringe, wig-like hair indicated by hatching; outline face in profile, dotted circle for eye, curved line for eyebrow, ear and cheek; chin shown but nose omitted. Hatched neck; diagonal lines indicating shawl-like himation. Triangular torso with thick solid edge and traces of interior cross-hatching. Her arms, in hatched outline, are raised. Hands are not indicated, but in each she holds a small bird with bent legs and hatched body, and head indicated by a curved line with dot for eye. To her shoulders are attached sickle-shaped wings in hatched outline. Her waist is missing. Lower drapery indicated by a long double-outline rectangle enclosing two ladder patterns which flank a central column enclosing two long solid rectangles. Her feet, to L., are seen below the hem. The wheel platform is hatched, each wheel enclosing a cross with reserved centre. The trees grow from solid triangular bases, and above the spiral branches are palm-like fronds. On the L. tree, facing the goddess, perches a large bird with triangular body in gridded outline and with fan tail; a long hatched neck ends in an outline head with open beak and dotted circular eye. Above the head, a solid-painted apex, with long wavy crest, suggests a heron. Side B: again, a nature goddess on a similar wheeled platform flanked by trees. Missing are her head, neck, part of upper chest and R. arm. Her triangular torso has a hatched outline enclosing a solid triangular centre. One shoulder is preserved, whence a hatched sickle-shaped wing rises upwards. Both arms, bent outwards at the elbow, reach downwards; hands and fingers indicated. With the L. hand she releases a bird which flies down, wing raised. With the R. hand she still holds a bird by the neck, preparing to release it; each bird simplified as on side A. The trees, however, are markedly different: no triangular base, but trunks shown by double ladder pattern to L., single ladder to R.; short oblique strokes flanking both, as though indicating deciduous trees in winter. To L., large triangle-bird as on side A, but with the addition of a solid central triangle; head missing, but curved wings in double outline attached to apex of body, as though about to take flight. Traces of triangle-bird also on R. tree: outline neck, (helmet-?) crest, and body apex with wings as on L. The goddess's lower drapery, within double rectangular outline, contains millsail with curved edge, and gridded squares. PGB-EG. BICS 31 (1984) 95 ff.

Tomb 1 1 1 SE No dimensions (displaced). Pithos interment. Found close SW of the end of the dromos of T. 13, near the SE edge of the excavated area. No orientation. The grave was identified during hand-cleaning of the exposed kouskouras after the mechanical removal of topsoil. It overlay what must have been an HL/R grave pit, a position in which it was probably dumped when unearthed by an HL/R grave digging party. The few bones beneath it perhaps belonged to this grave, itself undisturbed. All that remained was 1, part of a coarse pithos, and fragments of O vases.

A shallow step led down into the irregular quadrilateral chamber, the roof of which had collapsed. The tomb was found at the SE edge of the most congested part of the cemetery. Neighbouring chamber-tombs were T. 16 (on the e) and T. 40 (on the w), both on rather different orientations. T. 112 was orientated SE-NW. The tomb was found as a head of dark soil in the kouskouras matrix, after topsoil had been removed mechanically. A later pithos grave, T. 78 (q.v.), was partly dug into the E edge of the dromos. An unnumbered HL/R inhumation had been cut into the dromos filling. In the upper dromos fill was a HL bottle and, nearer the entrance, a miniature of HL date, and the skull of a mature adult. These, with a silver ring, found close to the blocking wall, are to be ascribed to an unnumbered destroyed HL grave. Three baskets of pottery were collected in the dromos fill. There was kouskouras in the upper chamber fill which had been disturbed by tree roots; it contained virtually no pottery. On the floor of the chamber, in the SE corner, were two SM stirrup-jars, 25 3, with the bones of the primary inhumation. The skull lay close to the W wall. Assuming it had not been disturbed by the second interment, it must have been laid in a crouched position against the S wall with the stirrup jars at its feet. The bones were of a 25-35 year °ld adult. 1, a SM belly-handled amphora, was standing on kouskouras at a slightly higher level. It would seem to have held a cremation, and to have been the second burial in the tomb. Sherds were also collected in the chamber. Thus, this SM chamber tomb contained both an inhumation (the primary interment) and a cremation inurned. POTTERY (PLATE 165) 1. BELLY-HANDLED AMPHORA (fig. 121). H. 41. D. 33.

The dromos of this small SM chamber tomb was confused by its propinquity to T 86 (q.v.), so that its original shape and means of access remain uncertain. Though no stomion as such survived, a substantial blocking wall was found filling the 0.90 opening from dromos to chamber. It consisted of seven flat slabs set on end, two of which had collapsed into the chamber. One slab measured 0.56 X 0.22, another 0.35 X 0.20. A step led down into the circular chamber, whose roof had collapsed. The tomb was in the centre of the main area of DA graves, at a point much confused by HL/R inhumation graves. The apparent orientation was NE-SW, the chamber on the N side. The tomb was found during investigation of several minor heads of dark soil exposed within their kouskouras matrix, following mechanical stripping of topsoil. The immediate area was disturbed by the HL/R inhumation graves Ts. 54, 96 and 117. The relationship with T. 86 (q.v.) was very uncertain, though, on one interpretation, the E side of its pit had been cut by the W wall of T 121 's dromos. The fragmentary inhumation attributed to T. 86 [supra, and fig. 39) is difficult convincingly to explain. The dromos fill was a yellow to light brown clay, excavated as topsoil and primary fill. It appeared that a circular pit, 1.44 X 1.36, 1.55 deep had been dug into this fill, in which were found the disordered remains of a human skeleton, of uncertain origin. The chamber contained the remains of three inhumations, I, II and III. On the floor was II, the skull of a Pfemale of less than 25 years, and III, the skull of a child less than 6 years old. They lay against the E side of the chamber, II to the N, III to the S. A pile of bones was also found against the E side which, because of their fragile state, was removed en bloc. Associated with II and III were four vases - a small oinochoe, 4 (lying against II), a flask, 5, and a feeding bottle, 7, between the two skulls, and a handmade black- ware juglet, 6, by III. Two arch-bow fibulae, fi, 2, found nearby are probably to be associated with these earlier burials. The final burial, I, that of a male possibly no older than 35, was found in situ resting on the remains of his predecessors. He was on his left side, skull in the NW corner, feet on the S side. He was in a crouched posture, spine curved, legs tightly flexed; the right hand lay in the groin, while the left arm was extended beneath the body. Three vessels were found above the skeleton - a flask, i, above the pelvis, a stirrup-jar, 25 above the knees and another flask, 3, just N of 2. f3, a</page><page sequence="183">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE Ts. 113, 121, 123 ^5 glass bead, also probably belonged to this body, in which case it may have been worn at the wrist.

The tomb was found on the w edge of the complex at the SE point of the cemetery of which Ts. 104 and 134 were the major elements. It was immediately W of T 134, separated from it by a neck of kouskouras. On the side nearest T. 134 was an oval pit. There was no orientation. This seems to be the remain of a G tomb, whose contents had been smashed by stones. The 'chamber' was excavated as a single layer; two baskets of pottery were recovered.

This might be explained by supposing it had originally been of normal size, but was inadvertently enlarged in a botched attempt at cutting a niche in its N face. There was a small depression in its NE corner. The dromos rose in two stages, separated by a step, at io° from the chamber floor, at 70 beyond the step. The stomion and its blocking had vanished. The small, oval chamber had lost its roof; its back wall was preserved 0.80 high. The chamber floor was 1.90 below modern surface.</page><page sequence="185">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE Ts. 123, 125 x 67 The tomb was isolated from the main group of DA graves, in the W part of the necropolis, 20.0 W of T. 100, 29.0 E of T. 75 (chamber to chamber in each case). Its orientation was SE-NW, the chamber on the E side. The tomb was identified following mechanical removal of topsoil, when it was seen as an irregular head of soil in its white kouskouras matrix. It was thoroughly despoiled, perhaps thanks to its proximity to the mortuary church (though the usual signs of Ch. period disturbance were lacking). Despite spoliation, sixteen vases were recomposed from its contents. Layer i was an upper deposit of brown soil and kouskouras lying over and among a deposit of field stones, pithos fragments and finer pottery (joins with material in lower levels); fia (fragments of iron sword) was in this level. Layers 2, 3 and 4 consisted essentially of successive spits of disturbed burial deposit 0.25 thick, overlying chamber and dromos floors, containing quantities of smashed pottery. In layer 3, 1-4, in layer 4, 5-6 were identified in the ground. Only the base of 3 (pithos) was identified at the time of excavation; it was subsequently almost completely recomposed from fragments. The essential homogeneity of the fill was established by recognising fragments of the same vase throughout the four levels discriminated in excavation. Other finds on the floor included fi, glass bead and f2, fragmentary iron javelin- head. On the floor, an area of cremated bone no doubt represented the emptying of an ash urn when the tomb was pillaged. POTTERY (PLATES 166 7) 1. OINOCHOE. H. 18.7. Most of mouth missing, gaps in body.

Tomb 126 (plate 29 b) What remained was in two parts: (a) 1.58 X 0.70-0.90 in plan, (b) 1.82 X 0.78. The original form of this grossly eroded O tomb was not ascertainable. Little more than the floor remained, forming an irregular cutting in the rock, in two sections (a), irregular, (b) rectangular in plan. The tomb was found near Ts. 104 and 123, part of the complex at the SE part of the cemetery of which Ts. 104 and 134 were the major elements. There was no orientation. The tomb was found as a head of dark soil during cleaning by hand of the kouskouras surface, following mechanical clearance of topsoil. The NW side was damaged by a shallow Ottoman pit, dug between the tomb and the enclosure wall of the mortuary church. As much of the Ottoman pit was cleared as was necessary to determine the limit of the DA grave. It was up to 0.70 deep. Three baskets of pottery, etc, fi-3, 5-7 (bronze fragments), £4 (iron fragment) and f8, (a piece of marble opus sedile) were found in the filling of soft dark soil with few stones. The pit's full extent to the E and W was not recorded. In the E part of the grave, (a) supra, were the broken fragments of a cremation pithos, 1, its lid, 2, and a jug, 3, as well as a number of sherds. Under 1 a fibula, fg, was found in a patch of burning. In the w part, (b), in addition to three baskets of fragments were two separate deposits of vases. The first was against the NW edge of the cutting, comprising the tripod base of a cremation pithos, 4, on each side of which were 5 (closed vessel) and 6 (cup). 4 appeared to have been in a separate cutting in the kouskouras which extended 0.20 beyond the NW edge. 4 stood only 0.10 below the surface and the rest of the vase had been broken and borne away with the overlying soil. A fragment of pithos found just to the N may have belonged. The second group was in the opposite SE corner, at a deeper level (0.40 below surface), thereby escaping destruction. It comprised the O standed oinochoe, 7, over whose spout had been placed a cup, 8. No trace of an interment was found at the corresponding level. POTTERY (PLATES 167-8) i.

The short wedge-shaped dromos rose a vertical distance of 0.35 at a mean angle of 180, with a slight downward kick at its outer end. A curious ridge of red mud, or pisé, divided dromos from chamber, and formed a slight step down into the latter. It may have been the foundation for the (missing) blocking wall. There was no real stomion. The floor of the small oval chamber was at least 0.80 below modern ground surface. The roof was destroyed; the back wall of the chamber survived 0.45 high. The tomb was the S-most of a N-S group of four, 75-107-132-129, in the W-centre of the cemetery. The orientation was ESE-WNW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was identified as a head of dark soil within the kouskouras matrix after the mechanical removal of topsoil, and subsequent hand-cleaning of the surface. It had been robbed.</page><page sequence="188">!7o KNossos the north cemetery The fill, indistinguishable between dromos and chamber, was light yellowish-brown with kouskouras lumps. It contained both G and later pottery, a piece of black glass, some R or ECh plaster, many small scraps of burnt bone, and a few unburnt. Stones, presumably from the blocking wall, were in the upper chamber fill and scattered in the centre of the dromos. Near, and amongst the latter were many ash-urn sherds. Some may have been from i, base of a MG pithos, set in the centre of the back of the chamber, as though in situ. A MG aryballos, 2 + 3, lay immediately NE, and pieces of an E-MG cup, 4, were near, fi, a Minoan sealstone, was in fill just above 1; f2, bronze sheet fragments, were on the SW side of the chamber, and Í3, obsidian blade, came from the chamber's final cleaning. There may have been one other early interment, for fragments of an EG pithos and kalathos-lid were among collected sherds. POTTERY (PEATE 168) 1. FOUR-HANDLED PITHOS. H. 40.2. DR. c. 18.

The slightly irregular walls of the narrow dromos widened somewhat towards the stomion. The dromos rose a vertical distance of 1.00 from the stomion at an angle of, first, 120, then 170, to an almost vertical cut 0.50 high, reaching surface at an angle of 78o. The stomion was flanked by prominent, rounded door jambs. The blocking stone, 0.97 X 0.72, Th. 0.12-0. 16, was found displaced by the looters, its lower edge 0.70 above the dromos floor, leaning outward at an angle of 40o. There was no step down into the almost rectangular chamber. Its N wall was irregular, but it otherwise had straight sides and sharp angles. It was unusual in that its length slightly exceeded its width. Round the sides and back was a very low bench or platform up to 0.30 wide upon which the ash-urns presumably once stood. The central space was strewn with fine, water-worn gravel. The roof, much of which was preserved, was a barrel-vault, dropping away to a low (0.32) back wall. On the N side of the dromos, just outside the stomion, was a niche 1. 00 wide, 0.43 deep, 0.52 high, c. 0.65-0.85 above the dromos floor. The tomb was part of a N-S group of four - 75, 107, 132, 129 - in the W centre of the</page><page sequence="189">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 129, 132 ^ cemetery. Its orientation (like its neighbours) was ESE-WNW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was identified as a head of dark soil within the kouskouras matrix after the mechanical removal of topsoil and subsequent hand-cleaning of the surface. The tomb had been robbed from above by removal of the front of the roof and the dromos fill to the W end of the niche. W of the displaced blocking stone, the earth in the dromos (Level 1), particularly in its lowest part, seemed comparatively undisturbed, though three baskets of sherds were recovered, and many small lumps of burnt wood, but no burnt bone. Five scraps of unburnt bone may have come from the larnax [infra). Against the dromos^ N wall, 1.40 from its beginning, 0.72 below the top of the cutting (well above the floor) was a small (0.20 X 0.26) patch of carbonized, rather greasy-looking earth, suggesting the dromos back-fill may have included sweepings from the pyre. Three baskets of material came from the upper dromos-ñll between the blocking stone and the chamber, including rubbish of all periods - worn G sherds, HL and R pottery, bits of floor-tile of mortuary church-type, pink waterproof plaster, a marble chip, a sea-worm cast perhaps used as a bead, a bit of cockle shell, £5, scraps of cremated bone, and fi, sandcore glass fragment, f2, 3, glass fragments, probably R or later. Level with the top of the blocking stone, many sherds of ash-urns and lids appeared. There was a mass in the stomion area particularly, and they continued down to floor level. They were too smashed and mingled in confusion to distinguish individual vessels, except for the aryballos, 2. The back of the chamber was comparatively empty, only fragments of smaller pots remaining there (Level 2), and it seemed clear that the looters had thrown out the ash-urns. In the ten baskets of G sherds taken up from this level were pieces of the larnax, 38, (infra) and occasional later fragments; in particular two LR sherds provide a terminus ante quern non for the robbing. Scraps of both burnt and unburnt bone were also found with this mass of pottery. The dromos-niche contained the remains of a LM III tub-larnax, 38, which appeared to be in situ. 1, part of a LG-EO pithos, was in the dromos, near it. The tomb had once contained at least forty-two pots; excluding the larnax 38 and a straight-sided pithos and lid, 9 and 9a (heirlooms?), the tomb was first extensively used in MG, and continued sporadically into O. 3 and 4 were fragmentary MG ash-urns, and a pedestal krater, 41, may have been a third urn. 13 and 14 were MG lids (14 fitted 4). 15-20, 22-3, 39 were MG domed lids, 40 ?EG. The cups, 28 and 37, and an Attic oinochoe fragment, 27, were also MG. There were five LG urns, 5-7, 10, 12; the cups 26, 32 and the lid 35 were also LG. 1 was the only LG-EO urn; fragments of cups, 24, 25, and lids, 21, 42, were of the same period. 8, 29, 31 were parts of EO urns, 36 an EO lid. n, 30 were O urns; also O were the aryballos, 2, an animal tail, 33, and a juglet, 34.

(to partition) 1.22. N niche: 1.20 wide, 1.00 deep. S niche: 0.92 wide, 0.66 deep. The design is essentially the same as its immediate neighbour, T. 104, comprising a roughly oval central 'chamber', with a large niche/small chamber cut on opposite sides of the 'chamber'. The E side of the 'chamber' was broken into when T. 104 was constructed, the damage being repaired by a substantial but clumsy blocking wall (for details, see T 104). The two niches were sealed off from the 'chamber' by stone blockings. The N niche blocking included a slab 0.75 X 0.18. The tomb was in a very crowded section on the E side of the necropolis, going very closely with T. 104, and probably Ts. 135 and 159 as well. Its orientation was almost due N-S. The tomb was identified together with T. 104, as a large shapeless head of soil uncovered in its kouskouras matrix following the cleaning by hand of an area previously cleared mechanically of topsoil. It was not immediately separated from T. 104, and during excavation the 'chamber' and the S niche were misinterpreted as parts of T. 104, until the significance of the partition wall was appreciated. (This led to some temporary misnumbering of finds - see infra). There may have been HL disturbance in the area of the partition, and close to the S niche, where some loose long bones were found in layer 1, and other bones among the partition, perhaps to be associated with 'T 104', 2, a coarse ware oinochoe from the same area. There may, therefore, originally have been an HL inhumation roughly overlying the partition wall, parallel to the HL grave cut into the fill of T. 104 (q.v.). The only object found in the 'chamber' was 'T 104', 10, an EG hydria, close to the blocking sealing the N niche /chamber. In the S niche, almost filling it, was the coarse pithos 'T. 104', 1, lying on its side, 0.76 high. Tucked into the space between its foot and the side of the niche were several finds, all originally attributed to T. 104 - a PGB trick jug, 24, a bell skyphos, 25. Inside the pithos were 'T. 104' 6, LPG/PGB feeding bottle, fl&gt;, bronze fibula, f7, amber bead, fi2, pair of gold earrings and fi3, scraps of sheet bronze. The N niche was very confused, and probably only the larnax 77 was in its original position. Of seventy-seven inventoried vases, only forty four were recognized as such, planned and numbered during excavation. The remainder was identified and inventoried during post- excavation study of the sherd material from the fill. 1-20 were found in no significant relationship over the whole area of the niche /chamber, except in the NW sector - i, 4, 7, 10, MG/LG small juglets, 2, 8, 9, 17, 20 (LG/EO small cups), 3, MG lekythos, 5, MG coarse lekane, 6, LG lid, 11, M/LG aryballos, 12, EG coarse juglet, 13, M-LG small cup, 14 + i65 MG amphora, 15 + 21 + 23, MG neck-handled amphora, i85 19, MG pyxis lids. 22, MG miniature, was found in cleaning loose earth from the vases enumerated above. f2, 3, 5, 8, 9, fragments of bronze and fi, 6, 7, fragments of iron, were found in the same horizon. The larnax stood against the S wall of the niche/chamber; inside it was 24, M/LG juglet, and 25, M-LG pedestalled krater. Between the larnax and the main blocking stone was a group of sixteen vases packed very close together, nearly all small - 26, 31, 43, M/LG juglets, 27, EG small jug, 28, 30, 38, 44, EG and MG lekythoi, 29, EG oinochoe, 32, EG small jug, 36, 37, 39, 40, MG or LG small cups, 41, PGB feeding jug, 42, MG miniature amphora. 33, Cypriot BoR lekythos, 34, M-LG coarse jug, 35, MG kalathos-lid were found near the W wall of the niche/chamber, and obviously stand apart from the Larnax group in types.</page><page sequence="193">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 134 175 POTTERY (PLATES 173-5) 1. *JUGLET.

Tomb 138 SW (figs. 5, 27, 41; plate 31 a-b) See Introduction: Ts. 60, 138 (p. 100). L. overall (restored): 3.60. Extant L. 2.80. Dromos: L. 2.15. W. 0.78-0.94. Stomion: destroyed. Chamber: 1.50 (restored) X extant W. 1.50. This tomb's short dromos was of uneven width, the sides irregular in plan. There is no record of the dromos' angle of slope. Though the stomion was otherwise destroyed, two blocking stones remained in situ, one of which was 0.28 X 0.47, and stood 0.71 above dromos floor. Too little remained of the chamber to determine its shape, though its junction with the dromos was angular. The tomb intruded between Ts. 48 and 60, at right angles to their long axes, so that part of the chamber had been cut into the upper part of T 6o's dromos. The orientation was roughly NNE-SSW; the chamber was on the S side. The tomb was found in excavating T. 6o's dromos, when it was at first misinterpreted as a niche/side-chamber of that tomb. That part of the chamber which coincided with T. 6o's dromos had been largely destroyed in the dromos. The dromos fill contained 6, a pithos sherd, and a quantity of uninventoried pottery. On the floor of the undamaged remains of the chamber were a LG skyphos, 2, a substantial hexagonal stone for a cremation pithos, f3, under which was 3, a soft-baked larnax fragment, and f4, fragment of an iron sword blade; also more uninventoried pottery. Tomb 138 is, by definition, later than T 60. Yet datable items on its floor are LG, earlier than the group of O vases found in the mixture of earth and kouskouras with which the robbing pit cut into the remains of T. 6o's chamber was back-filled. T. 60 was first used in PG; pots 5, EPG amphora, and 16, LPG (?) feeder, although damaged, were both evidently part of the original contents., earlier than the LG group in T. 138. It was subsequently reused in G/O times, a reuse which destroyed all but a fraction of T. 138's chamber. Further damage took place in HL times, when a pit was dug in front of T 6o's stomion. FINDS The finds are catalogued under T. 60. Certainly from T. 138 are the pots 2, 3, 6 and the small finds £3, 4, 6. Tomb 146 SW (figs. 5, 41; plate 31 c-d) L. overall: 4.00. Dromos: L. c. 3.00. W. 1.10-1.20. Stomion'. W. c. 0.80. Depth c. 1.20. Chamber: D. 1. 00. The dromos sides were somewhat uneven, widening towards the stomion. The dromos rose a vertical distance of c. 1.00 at a mean angle of 150 to an almost vertical cut 0.20 high. The dromos contracted to form ill-defined, rounded door jambs; there was no stomion proper. The blocking had evidently been removed when the tomb was looted. 0.90 from the chamber entrance, stones that must have been from the blocking wall were neatly piled obliquely across the dromos, up to c. 0.50 high. At the bottom of the pile was a slab 0.67 X 0.43 X 0.18, which must have been the chief element in the blocking. There was a drop of c. 0.40 from the dromos into the small, round chamber, which projected slightly into the dromos. Nearly all the roof had gone; the back wall still stood 0.90. The floor of the chamber was at least 2.00 below modern ground surface.</page><page sequence="197">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 135, 138, 146-7 xyg The tomb was in the middle of a group of parallel chamber tombs (175, 146, 207) on the W side of the main DA cemetery. The orientation was almost exactly E-W, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found following mechanical stripping of topsoil in this crowded part of the cemetery. It had been looted; the greater part of the chamber roof and an adjoining part of the dromos had been dug away. W of the line of stones [supra) the dromos fill was undisturbed sterile hard yellow kouskouras back-fill. E of the stones, dromos and chamber shared a reddish-brown fill so typical of robbed tombs. It contained comparatively few sherds, including 1 and 2, fragments from a LO cup and oinochoe, indicating the date of the tomb's final use. fi, amorphous iron lump, was in dromos fill, f2, bronze strip fragment, just inside the chamber, otherwise empty, except for three rough stones (c. 0.25 X 0.20 X 0.18) probably from the blocking.

Tomb 147 (figs. 5, 41) The recovered dimensions are largely meaningless, so fragmentary were the remains of this grave. Greatest dimensions: N-S. 1.30; E-W. 2.00. Only shallow cuttings remained of this complex, which appeared to comprise a small, rounded chamber, D. 1.02, with the scrap of a 'dromos' 0.18 higher than the chamber, on its S side, 1.5 L. X 0.60-0.70 W, and a second 'dromos' on the W, 1.04 L. X 0.84-1.04, running out in a low scarp. The original plan was not ascertainable. The grave was on the NW edge of the main concentration of DA graves, 4.00 from the chamber of T 229, 7.00 from the mouth of the dromos of T. 100. There was no meaningful orientation. The area of the grave had suffered severe erosion. It was on the E edge of a major concentration of HL/R inhumation graves; it was even supposed that the 'dromos' on the S side of the chamber might have been the remains of such a grave, but no bones or offerings were found to support such an identification. Three worked blocks of C or later date were found in the chamber, together with, on the W side a pithos, 1, and, on the E, the base of another pithos resting on a stone. Throughout, five baskets of pottery and tile of all periods were collected, together with a sheep/goat humérus. POTTERY (PLATE 176) i. *NECKED PITHOS. H. c. 42. DR. c. 21.

The shaft was a very irregular rectangle in plan, with vertical sides, at the bottom of which offset from the centre, was a basically rectangular pit with the N end rounded. No cover slabs survived, though the design of the grave would have allowed them to rest on the ledges, 0.10-0.20, formed by cutting the grave pit into the shaft floor. The grave was found close to the SM T. 160, and is likely to have been of the same date. Its orientation was NNW-SSE. The grave had been completely robbed. It was found as a head of soil in hand cleaning the surface of the kouskouras after mechanically stripping topsoil. The shaft contained a fill of brown earth containing G, A and R pottery, as well as quantities of tile. Burnt bones were found near the top, attributable to a 'mature adult of unknown age'. The fill of the grave-pit was similar, though it also included broken bones lying in no intelligible order, identified as 'a young mature male of unknown age'. The shaft had evidently been refilled with alien material after robbing. The burnt bones certainly and the unburnt bones probably did not belong.

The stomion was too damaged for its original form to be clear; a line of four blocking stones remained, somewhat in disarray, of which the two larger were 0.50 and 0.40 wide respectively, each 0.80 high. The 0.50 step down from the stomion into the chamber was unusually deep; the chamber floor was 2.45 below modern ground surface. The roof had collapsed early in the tomb's history, for the resulting hollow was then enlarged to form the overlying T 163 (q.v.). The tomb was at the centre of the most congested part of the cemetery, on its s side. Its orientation was ESE-WNW, with the chamber on the E side. This tomb was much the worst affected of this group by the extraordinary congestion in this part of the site. It was found in the final stage of excavating the R peribolos T. 124, part of whose floor consisted of the upper dromos fill of T. 152. It was so close to T 106 that the S side of its dromos cut away part of the W end of that tomb's dromos. The E end of the chamber cut the W end of the chamber of T. 168 (whose floor was nearly 0.80 higher). The chamber had</page><page sequence="199">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 147, 149, 152-3, 157 I8I been entered at some point, and emptied, from a robber-pit dug down the N side of the dromos of T. 106. The dromos fill of soil and a little crushed kouskouras was excavated as layer 2. It contained fragments of bone, a horse's tooth and part of a horse vertebra (neither of which belonged to the T. 163 horse-burial) and a small number of G sherds. The upper part of the chamber fill (layer 4) may have been partly confused with the lower fill of T 162, which immediately overlay it; this seems probable as some horse bones were found. But some confusion could have been created by the robbing pit, supra. Apart from a number of G sherds, the only find was a clay Pbutton, fi. SMALL FINDS 1. CLAY BUTTON or BEAD (fig. 187). H. 1.4.

This was a subrectangular shaft with vertical sides, at the bottom of which was a smaller rectangular pit with rounded corners, in which the body had been placed. Two cover slabs, 0.70 X 0.37, 0.48 X 0.38, both 0.10 thick, were in place, resting on the pit's ledges, formed by the floor of the shaft. There should once have been a third slab. The grave was in the SE sector of the main concentration of DA tombs, close to several other SM graves (e.g. Ts. 40, 112, 121, 160). The orientation was NE-SW. The grave was found during hand cleaning of the kouskouras surface following mechanical topsoil stripping. It appeared to be undisturbed, despite the missing cover-slab. The shaft was filled with reworked kouskouras, doubtless upcast from the original digging of the grave. Nothing was found in the shaft-well. On removal of the cover slabs the cramped remains of a single burial were found. This had been an adult, aged 25-35 years. The skull rested against the E side of the pit, while the tibias were parallel with the opposite side. Thus the body had been fitted into the grave lying on its back, its legs tightly flexed. There were no offerings. 'Tomb' 157 (plate 31 /) No plan. No dimensions. N of T. 149; E of T. 117. What originally appeared to be a tomb chamber was later identified as a cistern, or the like.

This was an ill-defined, very irregular feature, probably the remains of a larger complex, 0.80 from the S niche of T. 134. Found in a very crowded section at the SE area of the cemetery. The existing long axis was roughly NNE-SSW. This irregular cutting in the kouskouras was found during a search near Ts. 104 and 134 for similar graves. As excavated, the outline is too eccentric for it to have been the original form of the grave pit. It may originally have been part of a grave of the same type as Ts. 104 and 134; T. 135 (q.v.) may have been another, and there may have been a single complex within a períbolos comprising Ts. 104, 134, 135, 159. The brown soil and kouskouras fill was dug as layer 1. Two fragmentary O pithoi, 1, 2, were found, their lower parts still in situ on the tomb floor, with 3, skyphos, partly concealed by one of them. 1 contained cremated bone and fi, 2, 3, O bronze pins.

C. 2.20 E-W, C. I.80 N-S. The tomb appears to have been an oval pit (the exact shape remaining uncertain) dug into a pre-existing hollow formed by the collapse of the roofs of Ts. 152 and 168 (q.v.). The tomb was in the most congested part of the cemetery, on its S side. There is no meaningful orientation. This grave, apart from creating confusion within the graves with which it was so closely juxtaposed, was itself confused by two HL/R inhumation graves, Ts. 161 and 162 which had been dug into it and - less certainly - by the robbing pit through which T. 152 had been pillaged, via the dromos of T 106 (q.v). Its distinct existence was gradually appreciated during the excavation of the adjacent complex. Close beneath the mechanically removed topsoil, in what was later seen as the E side of the grave (layer 2), was a group of six LG vases - 3, 4, pithos containing aryballos, 2, lid, 5, skyphos, 6, jug, i, aryballos. Further w, fragments of G vases were found with traces of R intrusion in brown soil mixed with kouskouras, and patches of black ash. In this matrix were the disturbed but unmistakeable remains of a horse-burial, parts of which had, quite understandably, become mixed in the fills of Ts. 161 and 162, 152 and 168. The animal had been buried on its side, head retorted on its shoulder, perhaps the body in the NW sector of the grave, the limbs towards the E. It was a five-year old, standing 1.36 m (thirteen hands). On the S side of the grave was 7, a coarse jar of uncertain date. POTTERY (PLATE 176) 1. ARYBALLOS. H. 7.8. Complete but pitted.

This is only part of a chamber tomb, perhaps oval in plan, whose original form and orientation are uncertain. If it ever had a dromos, no trace remains. No stomion survives. It was originally seen as a side chamber of T 106, reached from a blocked opening in the NE corner of T. io65s dromos; but it was later identified as a separate tomb, earlier than T. 106, the S side of its chamber broken into when the dromos of T. 106 was dug, the hole neatly patched with flat stones and mudbricks. The W side of the chamber had been cut away when the chamber of T. 152 was dug. Its floor was 1.70 below modern ground surface. The tomb was on the S side of the most congested part of the cemetery. Its longer axis was orientated roughly E-W. The roof had collapsed early in the grave's history, for it was partly overlaid by T. 163 (q.v.). It had been completely robbed, either via the patched break, or from the robber-pit on the N side of T. 106's chamber (q.v.). The surviving fill was excavated as level 8, but it is possible that parts of the filling had been removed when other features in the immediate vicinity had been excavated.

H. °'95- The symmetry of the relatively short, parallel-sided dromos was much diminished by two niches, one on the N, one on the S side. The dromos sloped upwards in three stages, differentiated by shallow steps, at angles of io°, 30 and 2° from the chamber outwards. The stomion and blocking wall were alike missing. The chamber, of irregular oval plan, was reached</page><page sequence="203">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 163, 168, 175 ^5 by a shallow step down, c. 0.15 high. Most of the roof remained, sloping down steeply at the back so that there was virtually no back wall. The floor was 2.10 below modern ground surface. On the N side of the dromos were two immediately contiguous niches, irregular in plan. The NW niche was 1.20 X 0.80, its floor up to 0.60 above dromos surface. The NE niche was 0.50 X 0.50, its floor up to 0.60 above dromos surface. On the S side of the dromos was a large niche or small chamber 2.00 wide, up to 1.15 deep. The tomb is the N-most of a group of parallel chamber-tombs (175, 146, 207) on the W side of the main DA cemetery, some 10.00 W of the enclosure wall of the mortuary church. The orientation was almost exactly E-W, the chamber on the E side. The tomb was found following mechanical stripping of topsoil in this part of the site, when it was seen as a head of dark soil in the surrounding kouskouras matrix. It had been thoroughly rifled, probably at the time when the HL/R inhumation grave T 192 was dug into the dromos fill, while the similar Ts. 205 and 224 were inserted immediately to the N. A further sign of disarray is that only twenty four of the tomb's seventy four catalogued vases were recorded during excavation; the remainder were subsequently recomposed in the workshop from the many baskets of pottery collected during excavation. The history of use was long, from EPG to O, without obvious prolonged periods of disuse. This long life is reflected in the addition of the three dromos niches. The absence of Ch building and other debris in the fills suggests that no further damage was caused when the church and its osteothekes were constructed. Layers 1 and 2 were much disturbed, mixtures of brown soil, kouskouras, some black ash mixed with cremated bone (perhaps residue from pillaged cremation pithoi inside the tomb). The remaining fill, which covered dromos, chamber and niches, was divided in two horizons, 3 and 4 (yielding sixteen baskets) and a lower layer, 6 (five baskets), all consisting of brown soil lightened by kouskouras, with quantities of broken pottery. In the layers 3 + 4 horizon, the EG skyphos, 1, and jug-aryballos, 2 were found in the S niche, the EG aryballos 3 in the dromos near the chamber, the E-MPG amphora, 6, in the NW niche, with the EG oinochoe, 7. 8, parts of a coarse red mug, came from the NE niche. 9, a pyxis lid, fitting the PGB-EG pyxis, 24, came from the mouth of the NW niche, within which was 10, an EO aryballos. A coarse PG pithos, 12, came from the junction between the two N niches. The small PGB bell krater, 15, was found in fragments scattered over the NE niche, which also contained the PGB-EG cups, 19, 2O, 21 and the pyxis, 24. In layer 6, 13, O aryballos, was found in the dromos, while the coarse red LPG-PGB cauldron, 22, and the coarse LPG-PGB pithos, 23, were up against the chamber wall. With the exception of the fibula, fi, a bronze disc, fia, an iron dagger, £2, and a bronze pin, £25, all from layer 4, all the remaining objects came from layer 6. These include fi5, 16, 17, iron javelin-heads, from the dromos floor. Other iron weapons included a sword, f4, and numerous spear- and javelin-heads, f7-n5 14, 19. POTTERY (PLATES 177-183) 1.

The profusion of spear- and javelin-heads in this tomb (thirteen entries in all) poses problems of numeration. No further joins can be established but, as in most of the tombs, the disturbed and scattered state of the finds makes it more than likely that widely-separated fragments will have belonged to the same, incompletely-recovered weapon. Of the four finds of spearheads (7, 14, 28, and 32), differences of measurement and profile make it certain that no two belong to the same piece; but the same is not true of the javelin-heads. Here the most economical hypothesis would be to assign the fragments as follows: The smallest tip (26) to the lower blade 16, and that to the socket 29; the next smallest (31) to the near-complete 8 + 9(i) + io(i) + 11; the next smallest (30) to the blade 9(ii) + io(ii); the long tip (17 + 19) to the socket and upper blade 15. In this way, the nine javelin-fragments break down to four heads, to be added to the four spearheads. These have the merit of being even numbers (see below, p. 582 for the significance of this), but the arguments are far from conclusive. 32a. IRON PIN frs.

This was a pit-cave with single chamber, its entrance placed low down in the E face of the pit, sealed by a poros slab cut flat, 0.32 X 0.28 X 0.06, in secondary use (neatly rounded top, bottom edge unevenly broken). The floor of the chamber was 0.10 lower than the neatly levelled floor of the pit. The little chamber, including its roof, was intact. The grave was on the SW edge of the most congested part of the cemetery. The orientation was NNE-SSW; the chamber was on the N side. The grave was found after excavation of the immediately adjacent HL/R inhumation graves Ts. 139 and 140 which, by great good fortune, had done no damage to T. 186. Both the pit filling and the little tomb chamber were undisturbed. This SM cremation grave, used on one occasion only, must be one of the earliest interments in the N cemetery. The pit was filled with a completely sterile deposit of kouskouras, perhaps from digging the pit.

Tombs 200, 201 202 SW (figs. 5, 43; plates 34-5 e) Pit 1.34 X 1.34. The entrances to the three chambers were placed low down in the W (T. 200), E (T. 201) and S (T. 202) faces of the pit. T 200 measured 0.70 X 0.70, its opening 0.43 high, the chamber</page><page sequence="210">I92 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY 0.55 high. T. 201 measured 0.54 X 0.50, its opening 0.45 high, the chamber 0.55 high. 202 measured 0.55 X 0.62. Its opening was 0.45 high. The chambers were all sealed by flat stones set on edge, a single stone for Ts. 200 and 202, two stones for T. 201. There was no step into the chambers from the pit, but they all sloped down inside by up to 0.20. The roofs of all three were intact. The complex was 4.00-5.00 NNE of the pit-cave T. 186, only 1.00 from the possible pit-cave T 98 (part of the complex at the centre of which was T. 106), and thus in the most congested part of the necropolis, on its S side. One axis, passing through T 202 and the blank pit-face opposite, was orientated nearly due N-S. The complex first appeared during excavation of the HL/R inhumation grave T 176, which had slightly cut the SW angle of the pit, and the ill-defined HL burial T 187, which intruded into the upper part of the pit filling, with which two skulls (but no other bones) and a lamp were associated. In the fill of T. 187 was a large patch of ash-blackened earth, at the time of excavation taken as the remains of a pyre - or pyres. With it was a fragment of what was later seen to be T. 200, 4, a SM neck-handled amphora with twisted handles, many other fragments of which were found in the undisturbed filling of the pit. The three chambers were all undisturbed; the condition of the pit-filling makes it very probable that the complex was used on a single occasion only. T. 200 contained the remains of a single individual (probably a woman). T. 201 had the remains of two adults (perhaps man and woman) and, less certainly, a child. T. 202 was empty except for tiny scraps of bone. It is possible that these three - perhaps four - persons were cremated on the same occasion, and their ashes were interred simultaneously. If that were so, why did T. 202 remain unused? Perhaps because two of those involved were burnt on the same pyre, so that their remains were inextricably mixed. They were therefore interred in the same chamber, and the third prepared chamber was left unused, though its opening was sealed like the others. The pit-filling proved to be less disturbed by the intrusion of T. 187 than had seemed likely. The undisturbed part of the fill consisted of crumbly yellow soil mixed with ash and charcoal flecks, continuing without change nearly to the pit-floor. A final skin of dried mud mixed with reworked kouskouras immediately overlay the pit-floor, and could represent the trampled walking surface formed during the preparation of the graves and their use. Two large SM stirrup jars, 1, 2, were found standing on the floor, in the NE and SE corners respectively. T. 200 (the W chamber) was sealed by a flat worked poros slab 0.38 X 0.28 X 0.08. The chamber-fill of root-permeated powdered kouskouras overlay a mass of loose fragments of cremated bone, belonging to a not very old person, possibly female (an identification made probable by the nature of the grave offerings). 3, a large SM stirrup jar, stood on the S side. Other offerings (found mixed with the cremated bone) were £2, faience bead, fj, fragments of two leaf-gold rosettes, £4, shattered ivory comb, fs, bronze wheel-shaped pin-head, f6, glass bead, £7, bronze droplet, £8, many small solid gold spherical beads, fg, faience bead, fio, gold ring, fu, fragments of blue glass, fi2, serpentine conulus, fi3, burned gold leaf. Other gold beads belonging to £8 were found in the workshop when the contents were sieved. T 201 (the E chamber) was closed by two stones, one, flat, unworked, 0.30 X 0.26 X 0.07, the other 0.10 X 0.17 X 0.08, unworked. Little kouskouras had fallen inside or filtered in from the pit. Numerous bronze objects were found lying among a mass of cremated bone, of which 2.388 kg. were recovered, probably representing two individuals, perhaps male and female, with the possibility of the presence of a third (child?), fi was a large group of fragments of an ajouré four-sided footed stand and ring support of bronze; many pieces of it were unrecognizably distorted by the heat of the fire. f2-6 were large arrowheads, £8, blade and</page><page sequence="211">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE -Ts. 200-2 !g3 socket of a large bronze spearhead, fj9 a Type II bronze sword, broken in four pieces. £9 was an iron knife tip, fio, a plain gold ring, fu, a slim iron shaft in several pieces, possibly a pair of pins. A number of organic objects were inadvertently taken up with the bone, from which they were separated during post-excavation study- fi 2, decorated ivory handle fragments, fi3, nineteen fragments of sliced boar's tusk, fi4a, triangular bone inlays, fi4b, rectangular bone inlays, fi5, ivory fragments -Pcomb. Post excavation study of the bronze fragments taken up as fi showed that a shattered bronze shield boss/phalara had been included with them, as well as fi7, large bronze arrowhead, fi8, bronze strip and fij), bronze rivet. T. 202 was closed by a flat ashlar poros block 0.40 X 0.30 X 0.10. The chamber was filled with kouskouras. The only contents were two unidentifiable scraps of bone. There was a stirrup jar in T. 200; there had been a stirrup jar in T 186 (q.v.). It is possible that 1 and 2, found on the pit floor, should severally have accompanied the two individuals whose ashes were found in T. 201. But the chamber was too small for the unexpected doubling of its contents, so that the stirrup jars were placed outside instead. The T. 200-202 complex must be one of the richest SM graves yet discovered; it is also richer than any SMyc. grave. It was one of the earliest graves in the N cemetery.

The stand was probably laid on the body, for it seems to have been at the heart of the fire. There are 43 pieces whose approximate position in the stand can be deduced, having largely retained their original form. There are 38 pieces which have completely altered shape by fire action, yet can confidently be assigned to the stand. The 43 recognizable pieces weigh 684 g (largest, 53.5 g). The 38 unrecognizable pieces weigh 240 g. The recognizable pieces include three feet, five sections of the vertical elements of the frame (one joining a foot), one transom- vertical junction (probably joining one of the vertical above), three transom fragments (one a junction with a vertical), one transom-and-strut-and- ring, eleven strut frs., one strut fragment combined with dangler ring, eleven pieces of the ajouré figurework, four triple rod mouldings, two five-rod mouldings (from the ring support?), one unidentifiable. The basic design consisted of a ring support resting on the four- sided frame. The vertical sides of the frame enlarged at their lower ends into feet (not zoomorphic); the vertical elements were trussed together by transoms in certainly two, possibly three registers. Struts, made as parallel rods, spring from each side of each foot and were attached to the centre underside of each of the lower (lowest) transoms. A suspension ring for a dangler was attached to the underside of the struts at each apex; no danglers were identified. The allocation of the fragments of ajouré human and animal figures to the design is impossible. Difference in scale, however, suggests that there may have been two figured registers each side, separated by transoms. Among the fragments can be recognized the lower part of a long robed human figure, standing birds, a quadruped (feline?), a raised wing (probably sphinx) and animal legs. The design of the ring support is also uncertain, but it may have consisted of an ajouré wavy band bounded at the top by a band of five horizontal ring mouldings, at the bottom, a band of three horizontal mouldings. The object was made in Cyprus in the later thirteenth - earlier twelfth century be. 2. BRONZE ARROWHEAD (fig. 163; plate 280). L. 11. 3. Tang L. 4.8. W. 2.2. Th. 0.45. Wt. 28.5 g. Complete; intact.

The E half of the dromos, at least, rose at an angle of io°. The total vertical distance of the dromos gradient was not recovered. The stomion was embryonic in that the door jambs projected only slightly and were not opposite one another. There was no blocking, but c. i .50 W of the stomion, a number of stones, some partly worked (Preused) was built into a neat retaining wall, with flat E face, 0.90 wide, 0.38 deep 0.58 high (largest stone 0.50 X 0.38 X 0.20), presumably originally in the blocking wall. The floor of the dromos continued into the chamber without any intervening step. The chamber was approximately rectangular, though all but one corner was rounded and the N wall convex; the roof was intact, springing from low walls; the chamber floor was at least 1.75 below modern ground surface. The tomb was on the S side of a group of parallel chamber tombs (175, 146, 207) on the W side of the main DA cemetery. The orientation was E by S, w by N, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found following mechanical stripping of topsoil in this crowded part of the cemetery. It had been looted by digging out the half of the dromos nearer the chamber. W of the retaining wall, what was dug of the dromos-ñll seemed to be plain kouskouras back- fill. The dromos to the E of the wall, and the chamber were full of broken pottery. The kalathos, 1, was near the retaining wall, as were fi, iron pin fragment, and f3, three faience disc beads. f2 (bronze scrap), 2, stirrup jar fragment, 3, agrimi-like zoomorphic spout were in fill in the centre of the dromos, while £4, bronze sheet fragment, was near the chamber entrance, fs, the same, was in loose earth. In the chamber, sherd numbers dropped abruptly; 4, an Poinochoe sherd, was near the front, together with a stone, presumably from the blocking wall. The top third of the chamber fill was reddish earth, while the lower part was yellow. A buttress of fill left at the back of the chamber as a safety measure to support the roof had to remain unexcavated. 5, a fragmentary oinochoe and £6, a hemispherical bronze bowl, lay in the far NE part of the chamber, 0.15-0.20 above the floor, in fill. There were no finds in situ. Seventy two vases were assembled from the baskets of sherds collected. The date-range is SM/EPG to LPG. As there are no pithoi, no estimate can be made of the number of interments. There were remains of seven SM-EPG amphorae (25, 30, 38, 43, 50-1, 58 and one Attic import, 52). No burnt bone was found; some bones in the dromos fill, among them the tooth of a 'young' individual were unburnt. The two kraters - the Attic 7, and the small 73 - may have gone with some of the bell-skyphoi, of which 49, 67 were for the earlier period, the MPG 35, 53 and the M-LPG 69 for the intermediate, and 23, 31-32, 54-56 not more closely datable than PG. There were three skyphoi, 6, 17, 44 and five cups, 13-15, 20-21, for the earlier period, two skyphoi, 27, 33, for the later, and eight more (45, 47-48, 62-63, 65-66, 68) and a miniature cup 75 were M-LPG.

A trapezoidal space was apparently accessible from a narrow opening (0.70) sealed by a cut rectangular stone slab 0.74 X 0.30 X 0.18. In the centre of this space was a roughly oval pit. The grave was immediately W of T. 182 (q.v.), on the w side of the most congested part of the cemetery, in an area with several SM graves. It could not be said to have a particular orientation.</page><page sequence="218">200 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY It was found after topsoil had been stripped mechanically, when the stone slab was first noticed, then the dark soil fill against the kouskouras matrix. The area was much disturbed by intrusive HL/R inhumation graves. The grave had been pillaged, and the intrusion was too severe to decide whether or not the pit had been an original feature, or was the consequence of robbing. The presence of the SM amphora, i, suggests this was an early grave. Perhaps it was all that remained of a SM pit-cave. The grave was filled with dark soil mixed with crushed kouskouras, dug as layers i and 2, which were probably one and the same level. Pottery and finds varied in date from G to R, emphasising the degree of disturbance. The filling of the pit was the same as the rest of the fill. The SM amphora with twisted neck-handles may remain from the original contents. Finds, none of which need necessarily belong to the use of the tomb, included fi, head of an O silver pin, £2, obsidian chip, £3, scrap of bronze, f4, 5, 7, iron fragments, £6, blue glass tessera and £8, bronze fragments. Scraps of R glass were also found. POTTERY 1. ♦NECK-HANDLED AMPHORA (fig. 128). H. 32. DR. 10.5. Three quarters preserved, one handle missing. White grits, airholes, smoothed pale orange surface.

Tomb 218 SE (figs. 6, 45; plate 36) Extant L. overall: 3.00. Dromos: almost completely destroyed. Stomion: W. 0.90. Depth c. 0.50 Chamber: 2.28 X 2.00. All but 0.35 of the dromos was destroyed. What remained rose at an angle of c. n°. The lowest course of the blocking was found in situ, 0.40 wide, c. 0.30 high, founded on the level of the chamber floor, set against a step 0.16 down from the dromos floor. The chamber was approximately square, the back wall convex, the NW corner rounded and bulged irregularly outwards. Towards the back of the chamber three rectangular stones were set flat as stands, from N-S, C-0.65 X 0.20; B-0.35 X 0.25; A-0.75 x 028. They were roughly dressed limestones, c. 0.12 thick. Care had been taken to place them symmetrically. After they had</page><page sequence="219">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 208, 218 2Oi been set in position, the floor had been surfaced with pebbles up to 0.02 diameter, set in mud. These were preserved between and behind the stands, and in the NW corner, but not in front of the stomion or in the entrance area. Remains of a niche were found immediately W of the stomion in what had been the S dromos wall, at least 0.70 wide and 0.62 deep. The tomb was solitary, 13.00 NE of T. 219, within the later mortuary church's wall and colonnade, on the E side of the main group of DA tombs. The orientation appeared to be due E-W, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found when the NE-SW foundation trench for the N wall of the S central block of the Medical Faculty building cut through part of its dromos, dromos niche and NW corner of the chamber. The niche was partly and the dromos almost wholly destroyed, as well, probably, as the upper courses of the blocking wall. As the floor of the chamber was a little lower than the bottom of the foundation trench, the floor deposit escaped. The upper part of the chamber roof had collapsed, probably in antiquity. The HL T 220 had been cut into it, without reaching the floor deposit. The E sides of the two tombs coincided, but the HL grave extended S of the limits of T 218. Human remains from the chamber fill well above the floor may have come from T 220. The tomb was in use from LPG to O. One hundred and eighteen vases were standing or lying round the walls, leaving a comparatively clear space in the centre. Pots had been disturbed and rearranged by successive burial parties, but there were no real signs of looting. Many smaller vessels were unharmed, and though the ash-urns were all broken, probably by roof-fall, their outlines were usually recognizable, and their contents were in some cases still within them. At least fourteen interments had taken place; remains of thirteen urns and at least one inhumation were found. Early pots unassignable to urns, and the presence of at least one niche make it likely the number was higher. In what follows, while it is recognized that the only finds that can be ascribed with perfect confidence to any particular interment are those from inside the urns themselves, it is nevertheless possible to make at least an attempt at reconstructing some of the groups in the light of the positions of the urns. An Inhumation Pieces of unburnt bone, chiefly long bones, were in the lower fill along the s side of the chamber, among them a young individual's molar. In the SE corner, just above the floor, was the iron dirk, fi5, with human long bones in situ either side, orientated E-W. Further N was a pair of iron javelin heads, fi6, 17, fortuitously adhering by oxidization to the O lid 765 it is likely the three weapons accompanied the inhumation. PGB and EG Interments There were three LPG vases, six PGB, four PGB-EG and nine EG. Some, such as the LPG jug 31, found on top of the LG urn 57, had obviously been displaced, and even those on or near the floor lay in no comprehensible order. None could be connected with any of the cremation urns. Perhaps they had accompanied the inhumation, supra and, possibly, others beside. The LPG vases were the jug 31 and the lekythoi 67, 94; PGB were the feeding jug 54, the lekythoi 71, 116, the oinochoai 82, 113 and the jug- aryballos 103; PGB-EG were the oinochoe 22 and the small lids 70, 78, 79; EG were the kalathoi 17, 97, the oinochoai 28, 32, 44, the hydria 53, the skyphoi 98, 100 and the lid 90.</page><page sequence="220">202 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY The MG Cremations The base of ash-urn 9 stood in the NW corner, apparently in situ. No pots were found in its remains, but the cup, 5, and the pyxis, 8, lay immediately on either side of it. But the LG aryballos 7 and the EO lekythos 15 may well have accompanied 10. 100, a skyphos, was equidistant between 9 and 23 {infra). 4, an M-LG lekythos, right in the NW corner, could have belonged to 23. Other associarle finds in the NW corner include the fragments of iron spits £2, 22, 30, two iron javelin heads £25, 6 + 24, a dirk, £26, an arrowhead £21, an iron ?rasp £28, bronze pin £29, and £27, an oxidized mass including a bronze ?stand foot and iron javelin head fragments. Somewhat further away fi, bronze fragment, £3, piece of bronze plaque and £4, iron rod were still nearer 9 than any other urn. It is less likely that they went with the EO urn 10, particularly as the metal objects, like 9, were together immediately on top of a patch of pebble floor. The four-handled pithos 23 lay on its side N of Stand C, as though fallen from it, mouth NW. The E-MG aryballoi 85, 91 looked as though they had fallen NW from inside it. The MG aryballos 87 lay within the area of 23 's broken and missing body. At the mouth of 23 lay the Attic MG skyphos 99, which may also indicate an earlier rather than a later date in Cretan MG for this group. The skyphos 98 was partly under the urn, the pyxis 104 wholly under it, while the skyphos 100 was equidistant between 9 and 23 {supra). The pithos 39 fell, perhaps from Stand B, onto its side, facing the back wall. It contained an adult cremation, possibly female, as well as 40, aryballos, 41, Cypriot BoR lekythos, fg, 11, fragmentary bronze fibula, fio, fragments of iron pins and fi2, spherical amber and gold ?pin-head. A domed lid, 42, was beneath 39, another, conical, 96, to its N, a third, conical, 92, just W of its base. An aryballos, 89, was just to its S. £23, iron spearhead fragments between the urn's mouth and the back wall are unlikely to have belonged to a female. The fragments of pithos 43 still covered the w end of stand B, on which it may have stood; among or beside them were the cups 45-46 and the mastoid lid, 47. A lid, 105, was just N, and may have belonged. The lid 92 {supra) was between 39 and 43. Pithos 50 stood almost upright at the E end of Stand A, its lid, 49, still in place. Inside was an adult cremation and the aryballos, 51. Under it were fi3, 14, fragments of iron pins; partly under it was a lid, 52. A group of pots in the SW corner, at the other end of Stand A, were not in their original position, as the EO lekythos 118 lay partly under one of them, the MG cup no. However, they may not have been moved far. As found, they were nearer 50 than any other MG urn, and might once have been with it on Stand A. They included no, 112, 115, cups, 107, lid, 114, miniature pyxis. Beneath no was the M-LG juglet in, which may also form part of the group. The LG Cremations Three of the LG urns had O pots partly or entirely beneath them, so must have been moved. Despite this, the groups were relatively intact. The sherds of 64 lay over the W end of Stand C, with the lid 65 and the miniature aryballos 63. Beneath them were the iron knife £20 and the bronze pin fi8; partly underneath was the EO lid 66. Urn 33 lay on its side facing the wall at the E end of Stand C. The small LG neck-handled amphora 27, jammed between 24 and 39 nearby, may have been associated. Inside were an adult- ?male- cremation, the juglet, 34, the small olpe, 35, the miniature aryballos, 36 and an iron arrowhead, £8.</page><page sequence="221">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 218 203 Urn 37 lay on its side between Stands A and B, facing N. Inside were an adult - ?male - cremation and the LG-EO pyxis, 38. The LG cup 48 and lid 69 a little way W may have belonged, as may a LG-EO lekythos 88 between urn and wall, though its position under the EG hydria 53 raises doubts. Urn 57 was on its side facing the SE corner, containing the cremation of a small person, the juglet 59 and the jug-aryballos 60; beneath was the lid, 61. 57 was not in its original position as it overlay the O 58, 74-75, 77. Urn 25, badly broken, had been moved, as it overlay the O 76. More of its sherds were to the NW and the small LG aryballoi 81, 108. The LG-EO lid 109 in the SW corner may have been associated. The LG-EO and 0 Cremations The LG-EO urn 29 lay on its side on Stand A, NW of 50, facing SE. It seemed the only urn associable with the numerous EO and LO pots in the SE corner (SE of it were the EO oinochoe 55, aryballos 75, lid, 77; the EO small amphora 73, cup 56, lid 76, aryballos 74, the LO lid 58 and its broken knob, 62. Below was the EO lekythos, 72, and SW, at the N edge of Stand A, were the EO lekythos 80 and skyphos 68. This was the nearest group for the EO lekythos 118 in the SW corner. The incomplete LG-EO urn 24 was on its side over Stand C, facing the back wall; it may once have stood on Stand C between the urns 64 and 33. Like 29, it seems associable with some EO smaller pots. The LG-EO oinochoe 83, close SE, may have belonged, as may 26, an EO lekythos among its sherds, another, 93, in front of its mouth, and a MO skyphos, 95, nearer to 24 than to either of the other late urns. The EO urn 10 was apparently set down on the debris of an earlier, MG interment, in the NW part of the chamber. It was broken, and small O pots were scattered all around it among the MG pots. The LO oinochoe 1 was even inside the MG cup 5. Inside the urn was the EO lekythos, 11. NE of it were the EO aryballoi 2, 3, the EO miniature olpe 13, the lekythos 6, the EO juglet 14 and the oinochoe 1 [supra). SE of 10, between it and the wall, were the EO lekythos i6, the EO skyphos 12 and the oinochoe, 101. S were the lid, 66, lekythos, 94, and aryballos, 86. Just below it were the EO aryballos 18 and lekythos, 19. Í5, part of a bronze tweezer, lay beside 10 as though spilled from it. 20, a coarse G pyxis, below 10 on the floor, belonged to it, or the MG interment in 9. Unassignable in the chamber were fy9 bronze stud, figa, iron arrowhead and £31, sword fragments and a knife, all in the entrance area. £32, half a steatite bead, came from floor cleaning. In the remains of the dromos niche was a MG cup, 119, which may represent a MG interment there. POTTERY (PLATES 188-98) 1. OINOCHOE. H. 1 1.5. Complete save gaps in rim and wall.

Tomb 219 SE (figs. 6, 47-48; plate 37) Extant L. overall: 7.50. Dromos: extant L. 5.90, W. 1.80. Stomion: W. 0.60-0.65, depth c. 0.40. Chamber: 2.84 X 2.05. This was one of the largest tombs in the cemetery, its chamber probably the largest. It was exceptionally well cut. The dromos walls were straight in plan, ending in precisely executed right angles, or near right angles, at the stomion. From the level of the chamber floor, the dromos rose a vertical distance of c. 0.90, at first at an angle of 70, then of io°. The dromos floor ended at a rectangular stone threshold (0.76 X 0.26 X 0.18) set outside the stomion, its base resting on the level of the chamber floor, so that it formed a low step (0.18) into the chamber. The narrow stomion had pronounced rectangular door jambs. Just before the threshold was a small depression in the dromos in which was set the lower edge of a large flat, almost rectangular blocking stone, 1.20 X 0.88 X 0.18. leaning inwards at an angle of 20o, and covering the threshold. It was clearly in situ. A packing of mud and small stones sealed its edges. The chamber was a smooth, fairly regular ellipse in plan, its greater dimension at right angles to the dromos. Its roof may have been higher than the restored section, FIG. 48, suggests. The back wall was preserved 1.10; the chamber floor was at least 1.85 below modern surface. Three</page><page sequence="229">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 218-9 2n stone stands were set on the chamber floor. In the NW part, just within the N jamb, was the circular stand A (D. 0.53-0.56, H. 0.15); on its underside, short chisel strokes running clockwise covered the whole surface; there was a small rectangular slot 0.035 x °-O25 near me edge in one place. NE of A was the rectangular stand B (0.28 X 0.23 X 0.10); its underside bore a mason's cutting. At the back of the chamber, opposite the entrance, was the rectangular stand C (0.34 X 0.24 X 0.12). Blocking stone, threshold and stands were alike of well dressed white limestone, suggesting reuse. The tomb was at the N limit of the main, S, part of the cemetery and of the straggling N-S line of tombs (219, 14, 13, 19, 55). It was, however, unlike these; its probable associate, if any, would have been T. 218, 13.00 NE. Its orientation was E by N, W by S, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found when the NE-SW foundation trench for the N wall of the W block of the Medical Faculty was cut through the dromos. The S edge of the 1.70 wide trench was c. 2.00 from the stomion. It had also suffered disturbance either at the building or destruction of the mortuary church when (1) a pit destroyed the end of the dromos wall on the N, (2) the church colonnade destroyed its S end, (3) a pit was dug in the dromos near the stomion, and (4) a large pit was dug above the chamber, destroying the roof; this may have robbed the church's perimeter wall, no remains of which were found, though its line crossed the chamber. The chamber was much disturbed. At the end of the dromos was a pile of fine gravel, just above the floor, perhaps intended for the chamber floor. What dromos-ñll remained undisturbed appeared untouched since the final interment. The earth was hard, pale yellow with chalky flecks (ancient kouskouras back-fill). Its few sherds were mostly from ash-urns; there were many bronze flakes and lumps of charcoal, some walnut-sized. These would have come from T. 310 (q.v), a pyre discovered later, just N of T 219. Sherds from this pyre joined some from the tomb. There were three groups of pots in the dromos, all against the S wall. From W-E these were (1) 4, 5, two O cups, stacked; (2) 6, a LPG-PGB jug-aryballos; 7, a PGB oinochoe; 8, a LPG cup; 9, a MPG stirrup jar; 11 a PGB cup inside 10, LPG cup and, upside down, 12 + 13, LPG double bird-askos with 15, LPG cup, beneath. To the NE was 14, a ?MG cup and, E, against the wall, 20, EPG bell-skyphos; (3) in the SE dromos corner were the LPG duck- surmounted lentoid flask, 16; a LPG stirrup jar, 17; a LPG-PGB pyxis, 18; an ash-urn fragment, 19 and an EPG bell-skyphos, 21. Also in the dromos-ñ'i were 1, fragmentary LPG bird-askos; 2, 3, bell-skyphoi; £2, fragment of a fenestrated kalathos. £4, faience beads and many bronze flakes, perhaps from a bowl, were under 7 (supra). £6, a faience bead, was with group (3) (supra), and fs, bronze vessel attachment, fi, another attachment, was in disturbed earth in the foundation trench. These dromos finds suggest that an EPG interment and a LPG-PGB interment had been removed from the chamber to make way for later ones. 14, the ?MG cup, may mean this happened post-MG. The condition of the chamber contents was chaotic, despite the undisturbed blocking. It must have been entered through the roof, either during building or demolition of the church's perimeter wall. There was a group of broken pots and other finds of very mixed date in the upper fill on and just within the threshold; the base of a coarse PG pithos, 34, was upside down in the centre, while groups of sherds, chiefly of ash-urns, were piled against the walls, continuing to the lower fill, on or near the floor. Here was a great mass of iron objects across the back of the chamber; in the NE were iron weapons, occasional PG and other pottery, £62, the faience lion between stands A and B, and in the centre of the floor, very fragmentary</page><page sequence="230">2I2 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY objects, chiefly metal. As well as Cremation A (infra), fragments of cremated bone recovered from the chamber fill and floor included evidence for an adult male, a middle-aged adult, perhaps not very old, and a small, perhaps adolescent person. When the blocking-stone and its packing were removed, fi4, 15, fragments of an iron spit were found on either side of the threshold, flat against the outer sides of the door-jambs. On or just inside the threshold, in the stomion, were £7-9, pieces of an iron javelin-head, fu, javelin- or spear-head, fio, iron nail, £13, bronze pin fragment, fi2, glass rosette, fi6, ivory roundel and 22, Cypriot BoR amphoriskos, 23, Attic MG II flat pyxis, 24, coarse G jug inside 25, Cycladic MG I skyphos, 26, LG lid, 27, MG cup, 28, LPG pyxis. Though fi4, 15 were almost ritually placed outside the door-jambs, perhaps by the last burial party, most of the rest must have got where they were found during later pillaging of the chamber. Just N of 34 (supra), in the centre of the chamber, was a patch of carbon and burnt bones of a youngish mature adult (Cremation A) perhaps emptied from 34 during looting. Amongst the bones were £21-25, a bronze Pearring, bronze sheet fragments, iron knife, a rock crystal and a glass paste bead. In the same small area, but lower, were £38, 49, glass beads and £iO5a, faience disc beads, on the floor, with which should be associated £89, 115, faience beads from the sieve. One of the PG interments almost certainly had had a necklace. Evidence indicates one of the PG interments, probably 34, was once in the NW sector, perhaps on Stand A. 47, part of 34's rim, came from the NE sector. Between Stand A and the stomion was fi8, group of glass beads; a rock crystal bead, £33, was on the stand. £82, 95 were two groups of faience disc beads E of Stand A, on or near the floor, close enough to have been one. In this area were the EPG 68, bell-skyphos, behind Stand A, 30, stirrup jar, on it, and 69, small Attic MG I lid, immediately E. Other PG vessels were 35 (EPG bell-skyphos), just within the chamber on the S of the entrance, 28, LPG pyxis on the threshold, 60, coarse PGB lid, c. 0.40 S of 34. In the SE sector were most of the fragments of the Attic MG II belly-handled amphora 33; to its W were remains of the Attic MG II krater 42; within the stomion was the Attic MG II pyxis 23 (supra). All these were from the same workshop, and were presumably part if the same MG interment. Bits of all three were scattered broadcast in the chamber. A piece of 33 ('61') was on 42; others ('44') were just inside the S door-jamb, or N of 34 in the chamber centre ('48', '49', '54'). Pieces of 42 were among these last ('50') and between it and 34 ('55'). Most of its lid, 32, was found in the N sector on top of '39', base of the LG urn 38, but a piece ('65') was close S of Stand A. What remained of the lid of 23 ('59') was across the chamber, near the S corner of Stand C. Among the sherds of 33 was the MG cup 37, safely assignable to this interment. Other MG items likely to have belonged are two cups, 27, 14, on the threshold and in the dromos respectively. Few other finds can even tentatively be assigned to this rich interment. fi7, bronze vessel fragment, fi9, iron knife, £28, part of a javelin head were near 33: another part of £28 (£26) was 1.00 W. Otherwise the S sector of the chamber, the 'territory' of the MG interment, was almost empty. The four Cycladic MG I skyphoi may perhaps have belonged to an earlier, PGB interment: 41, just N of 45; 35, from the threshold, with the coarse juglet 24 inside it (supra); 63, near the stomion; and 70, under a mass of finds in the centre, including parts of 33. In the N sector of the chamber, the LG pithos 38 was in fragments between Stands A and B and the wall. Under some of its sherds, behind Stand B, were the sherds of the LO pithos 58, and 51, its lid. In the later stages of the tomb's history 58 might have stood on Stand B, 38 on Stand A. But, 38's base ('39') was E of 58, and a large sherd ('53') was 0.40 s of the base. The LG 52, under 38's base, may have been its lid. With 38 was 56, a M-LG imitation of a</page><page sequence="231">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 219 213 Cypriot lekythos, which had probably been inside it. Possibly belonging was 43, a LG East Greek oinochoe whose neck, '46', was 0.20 SW of 38, between Stand A and the wall; 43's base was beside the internal N door jamb. Other items possibly associable with the LG 38 include 29, MG skyphos from the threshold, 40, Cypriot BoR lekythos near 38's base, and 62, small M-LG cup in the chamber's centre, a better chronological fit than with urns 33 or 45 [infra). 71, a LG Euboean pedestalled krater could go either with 38 or 45. Only the O cups 4, 5 in the dromos could be connected with the LO urn 58. Perhaps belonging to the LG 38 interment was a mass of metal and other objects found beneath the main fragments of 38 and the LO 58, all round the nether side of Stand B. These include fiO3, a corroded mass of iron javelin-heads and two bronze cheek-pieces from a bit. fiO29 a complete bronze bit with cheek-pieces was under the base of 38, with fii2, a bronze phalara, fiO7, an iron dirk, fin, an iron sword fragment, fno, a red stone and iron pommel/handle, fiO4, 108-109, ma, iron spear- and javelin-heads. Other possible candidates for this group are £85, bronze cauldron handle, near the SE corner of Stand B, £35, 27, ivory handles, from the sherds of 38, 58 and from the SW side of Stand A respectively, also £29 (sheet bronze fragments in 43) and fgo, iron dirk, W of Stand A, by the wall. Two exceptional finds may have belonged to 38: fgi, a gold cut-out (man and lions), w of the main group of 38's sherds, and, to the S of the main group, £62, faience vase in the form of a lion couchant in the outer angle between Stands A and B. Most of the sherds of the LG pithos 45 were between Stand C, on which it probably once stood, and the chamber wall. To it belonged '57', the lower sherds of the main pile, '36', just inside the stomion, and '31', from the main sherd-pile of 38 [supra). Amongst its sherds, and therefore probably once within it was 64, EO lekythos, suggesting this interment was at the end of LG, or a little later, and thus later than the 38 interment [supra). As part of the urn was near the stomion, the LG lid 26 on the threshold might have belonged. The 45 interment must have been very rich if all the neighbouring objects belonged to it. Mixed with its sherds were many fragments of iron rods, some jointed (£30, 43-44, 46-47), £j2, iron knife (another part of which was near the krater 42), while with and below the lower sherds were three fragments of an iron fire basket (£65, 78-79) and £88, bronze sheet fragments and a piece of a bronze vessel. £58, bronze skyphos, was just N of Stand C, and £84, fragments of a bronze vessel. Close N of £58 was £74, bronze vessel and decorated facing fragments. Under £74 was part of the faience bowl £83 (of which part, £114, came from the sieve). N of Stand C, near the wall, was fioi, fragments of bronze vessels and sheathing. £57 was the main component in a group of iron spits, fire dogs and bier-attachments that lay slantwise across the chamber, from the space between Stands A and B to a point SSW of the sherds of 45; it was in front of Stand C (on which 45 probably stood) and parallel with it. Though corroded, fragile and broken, the bundle appeared basically undisturbed; its lowest part was slightly above the lowest finds in the floor deposit. £57 included at least six, possibly as many as twelve, spits, a fire-dog and possibly some bier-attachments. £56 was another fire-dog which lay top to toe in the bundle, £94 was a scrap of one or other of them w of the main pile. A bier-attachment, £67, was on top of the pile, another, £70, was to the W, S of £94. Spit fragments included £60 and ?f76 (n end of pile); £52-53 were small pieces above the main pile in front of Stand C; fsg, 63 were mixed with the 45 sherds; £48, 64, 106 were scattered at the S end of the pile. Under the iron were found £80, bronze ?ring handle, £87, ivory Psleeve, £92, single bronze cheek-piece, £95, faience beads [supra); £86, g3, 100, 100a, 100b, 100c, bronze vessel fragments, fio8, iron javelin fragment and (much further s) £66, bronze fragments. SW was £68, part of a spearhead.</page><page sequence="232">214 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY The iron items probably belonged with either the LG urn 38 or the LG 45, the latter more likely in view of its probable original position on Stand C, from which it would have overlooked them. It may be significant that the fire-basket (£65, 78-79, supra) was mixed with 45's sherds. The relatively undisturbed state of the iron is consistent with it belonging to the second from last interment. In addition there were several finds W of the iron in the N central sector - the s sector was remarkably bare. Just above the floor was 67, fragmentary M-LG tripod cooking pot, £37, 40, javelin-head fragments, £72, fragments of bronze sheet together with a piece of iron (obelos fragment?), £73, body fragment of bronze vessel, f56a, egg shell. The objects on the floor, thoroughly flattened, in hard pale soil, rather unlike the loose fill may have been so scattered by the later burial parties rather than tomb robbers, and so belonged to one or other of the earlier interments. There were many bronze fragments (£96-97, 101, 101a, 105, 105b) possibly from one object, and £98, an iron double axe, £99, part of the iron spearhead £68, some distance away, near the irons.

Parts of two fire-dogs, one larger and one smaller, (i) consists of a main body-piece, L. 79.5, plus numerous smaller fragments and scraps. The central section is in the form of a thick bar, W. c. 1.7, Th. c. 0.6; but towards the preserved extremity (the 'bow', on the analogy of the ship-form which complete examples from elsewhere have), this section changes gradually to a squarish rod, W. 0.6, Th. 0.4, and then to a slim, upright rectangle, W. only 0.2, H. (or 'Th.') 2, and simultaneously curves upwards. Under the main, horizontal portion one of the two arched supports can be restored, several broken pieces joining the crown of the arch which runs across underneath the main 'hull' at right angles, and is still in situ. The arch is more massive than the 'hull' itself, section c. 2.7 by 1.6; the restored height, to the underside of the arch, is 11.

Consists of three different kinds of component: (a) a main, socketed arm which runs straight for c. 13 cms., then bends sharply down and is broken off at the point where it is turning upwards again; (b) two smaller 'side-arms' which are set opposite each other at the point where (a) begins to bend downwards, and which run horizontally in a curve such that the two of them, and (a), would all have eventually met at the same point and described, respectively, the rim and central axis of an open hemisphere; (c) a number of small cross-struts, also curved, which emerge from each side of the curved part of (a) and run up to join the side-arms (b). The whole thing, once mounted on a shaft, would have had the form of a large, open- work scoop or basket. The preserved length of (a), in three joining fragments, has L. 37.5 and D. 2.3 in main shaft, 0.9 in curved part, and is cylindrical. The stump of one of the side-arms (b) is preserved on one side and, with a joining length attached, has L. 13.7 preserved and D. 0.9, tapering to 0.6 at final break. Parts of three cross-struts (c) can be restored, one short one (L. 6) completely so; the others, further along, will have been much longer (up to 15 cms.).

The second enigmatic end and, it seems, otherwise unattested type of object in this tomb had the form of a giant pair of pincers, but with the two blades held rigidly in position relative to each other by a cross-strut, of a form resembling a large rivet. The object, once again, has a socketed shaft and was clearly fitted with a wooden handle. Apparently near- complete: L. 21; socket L. 12, D. 4.3; blades (one detached, but joining), L. c. 9, W 6, Th. 0.7, both are bent distinctly to one side (presumably downwards) in relation to the shaft; a small-cross-strut, L. 1.3 joined the two blades near the tips of their rectangular terminals, suggesting that some other object was clasped between them. 68 + 99.

Since, on a rough calculation, each complete object of this form will have required c. 2 m. in total length of such cross-struts, it will be seen that the sum of these fragments and those preserved under 47 and 65 above could all have come from one piece. 79.

Two are apparently pieces of side- arms, Ls. 7.6 and 5.5, D. c. 0.8; their addition to the pieces of side-arms in 65 and 78 is enough to suggest that there may have been more than one of these objects in the tomb, though (even without joins) it remains just possible to restore all the surviving pieces as part of one object.

A piece of circular-sectioned rod like 78b above, that is from a cross-strut of a 'fire-basket' of the type of 65. L. 5.6, plus thirteen very small scraps. These frs. are, once again, not enough to prove the existence of a second such object in the tomb. 128. IRON FIRE-DOG (?) fr. A bent section of bar, L. 7, section rectangular, c. 1.9, widening abruptly to c. 3.2 near break at one end, by c. 0.3. Perhaps from the arched support of a small-sized fire-dog, like 139 below. 128a. IRON FIRE-DOG (?) fr. A straight length of massive bar, L. 10.5, W 2.7, Th. 0.5, but tapering towards a point at one end. This could be from the 'hull' of a large-sized fire-dog, near the point where the section changes (compare 56 (i) above). 128b. IRON FIRE-DOG fr. This find is important in establishing the existence of a second, smaller size of fire-dog; on to it are corroded two lengths of OBELOI. The main 'hull' section survives to L. 27.5, in three joining pieces; W. 1.7; Th. 0.5, decreasing to only 0.2, this last dimension being very much smaller than that of a piece like 56 (i). Also preserved is part of one of the arched supports, correspondingly smaller: W. 1.8, Th. 0.5, H. to underside of arch only c. 6. (little more than half of that of 56 (i)). It is on to one piece of this that the two lengths of OBELOI are corroded. 129. IRON BIER-ATTACHMENT (?) fr. Five joining pieces, forming the socket of a further object like 67 and 70 above (see under 67 for interpretation). Socket L. 14, D. 4.7 - that is, somewhat larger than either of the better-preserved examples. Sixteen small scraps appear also to have belonged to this object. 130. IRON FIRE-DOG(s) frs. Two 'hull' sections from the larger(?) size of fire-dog (see 56 above), (a) in two joining pieces, L. 15.5, W 1.8, Th. 0.5; (b) L. 12.6, with piece of bronze sheet corroded onto it; same cross-section. The two pieces are very likely from the same object, but corrosion makes it difficult to establish whether the size approximated to the larger or the smaller variety of fire-dog. 131. IRON OBELOI frs. Twelve lengths of obelos, of standard square section; Ls. 27 (in two joining pieces); 18; 15.4; 14.5; 11, bent nearly double (for which practice cf. 285. £46-47 below); 9.5; 5.8; 5; 5 (a tip); 4-7; 4- 132.

The feature appeared in the s face of the S-most of two foundation trenches for the Medical Faculty building, c. 10.00 from the w end of the trench, c. 4.00 W of T 186. Little more than 1.00 of the ?dromos was traced, first seen as a dark lens in the trench</page><page sequence="243">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 219, 221-2, 229 22^ section. The upper fill contained coarse pottery, ?tile fragments, fi, bronze 'ring' fragment, an iron lump, the neck of a glass bottle and 1, ring handle. The chamber had, with the exception of the extreme S part, evidently been destroyed in digging the foundation trench. The material suggests that the dromos, at any rate, had been robbed. POTTERY 1.

Perhaps the back of a chamber tomb, the rest of which was destroyed by foundation- digging. The roof survived over what remained of the Pchamber. The fragment was found at the SE edge of the main concentration of tombs in the area excavated in 1978, immediately SE of T. 55. Too little remained to identify its orientation. The fragment was found in the N face of a Medical Faculty building's foundation trench, and investigated from the side ofthat trench. On the floor was a large stone (?pot-stand) and scattered, disarticulated human bones, unburnt, including a pelvis fragment with several long bones. There was so little pottery that the tomb was probably robbed in antiquity. POTTERY 1. KALATHOS (fig. 133). H. 9.5. D. 34. Half preserved. Deep orange clay, brown grits, red paint.

A 27 fig 4, pl. 15. Tomb 229 SW (Figs. 5, 46) L. overall 3.60. Entrance pit, 1.602. Stomion 0.70 X 0.50. Chamber 1.63 X 1.10. The straight-sided entrance pit was rectilinear. The long axis of the oval chamber was at right angles to the well-marked stomion, with its large rectangular jambs. Outside was the single remaining course of the blocking-wall, of moderate-sized unworked limestones. This extended the length of the W side of the pit. In the centre back of the chamber was an almost square stone stand 0.36 X 0.34 X 0.10. Chamber and pit floors lay 1.35 below modern surface; the stomion surface was 0.03 higher. This was the most NE of the ill-assorted group of four tombs (207, 146, 175, 229-SW-NE), W of the S part of the basilica's boundary wall. The orientation was roughly WNW-SSE. Unlike the great majority of tombs in this area, the chamber was on the W side. The tomb was found in August 1978 during mechanical excavation of an E-w foundation</page><page sequence="244">226 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY trench for part of the Medical Faculty building, which removed all but the lowest 0.20 of the chamber and much of the entrance pit (sliced diagonally). The chamber floor deposit, and the lowest course of the blocking-wall that had probably been in situ, were fortunately spared. When the undamaged part of the entrance pit s of the foundation trench was excavated, 22, a M-LG lekythos, was found just below the surface, near the W corner. The pit fill was reddish, and contained many scraps of bronze and sherds from ash urns and smaller vessels in the seven baskets from here (level 1). It was from these rather than the chamber's sherds in Level 1 (initial cleaning up after machine) that the numbered vessels 23-36 were recomposed. If they were once from the chamber, and not just rubbish brought from elsewhere to fill the pit, they indicate a longer and more continuous history for the tomb than its chamber contents suggest. An E- MPG burial may be represented by the necked pithos 24, a bell krater 25, an oinochoe 23 and a kalathos 26, all fragmentary. 30 was part of a coarse PGB-EG pithos, and 27, sherds from an early LG four-handled pithos. There are no smaller pots of these dates. 19, a fragmentary LG kotyle, 28, sherds from an Argive krater, and 22 (supra), may have been from a single LG group. There may have been another O burial, comprising 33 as the urn, the EO 32 and 35, the LO 31 accompanying it. The chamber contained three cremations in 1, 6 and 7; an earlier one may be presumed in 18. The urns were broken and their contents disturbed, probably by roof fall and/or reuse, rather than looting. The small LG two-handled pithos, i, was in the s of the chamber. In it was an adult cremation, perhaps male, the LG jug-aryballos 12, and the LG-EO skyphos 13. Between its mouth and the wall was the LG conical lid 2, and, below the latter, the domed lid 14, which fitted 1. Immediately N of 1 was the LG-EO krater 3. 13 suggests this was a cremation near the turn from LG to EO. In the centre back of the chamber, above the stone stand and the majority of sherds of the PGB-EO pithos was the LG/EO pithos 6. Inside were the LG oinochoe 15, the EO lekythos 16, the EO aryballos 17, a long silver pin, fi, a bronze statuette of a stag, £2, two small faience scarabs, ¿3-4, and four beads, £5-8 (all different). A fifth bead, quartz, D. 0.013, was identified during study of the cremated remains of an adult, possibly female. To the group probably also belong 4, an EO lekane, below 6's w shoulder, and 5, an EO lekythos between it and the W chamber wall. 19, a LG Corinthianizing kotyle lying between 6 and the next urn, 7, and rather below them both, is more likely to have been deposited with 6 than the later 7. 6, then, was a LG-EO urn containing, on the evidence of 16 and 17, an EO cremation. The EO polychrome pithos 7 lay broken on its side, in an almost central position, foot towards the entrance, between 6 and the stomion. To its SE was the EO aryballos 8, to its NE, the O lid 9 + 34, with the shattered aryballos 21 beneath it. Just beyond 7's mouth was the EO cup, 10. A piece of the PGB-EG 18 (numbered 20 in the field) was under 7's base. NE of the stone stand, against the back wall, was the Cypriot oinochoe, 11. It was close to the main body of sherds from the PGB-EG pithos 18, to the foot of 6 and not far from the mouth of 7. It cannot be assigned with certainty to any one of the burials. In the N face of the foundation trench, about 3.40 E of T. 229's chamber, two small pots (an aryballos and a juglet), lay together 0.48 below ground surface. No tomb was found to which they might have belonged.</page><page sequence="245">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 229 227 POTTERY (PLATES 208-09) 1. TWO-HANDLED PITHOS. H. 37.5. DR. 12.5. Nearly complete.

(restored) 1.00 The pithos lay on its side in an oval pit, the floor of which was at least 0.80 below modern surface. The grave was within the N-S line in the N group of tombs, equidistant between the dromoi of Ts. 294 (to the n) and 283. The orientation was ESE-WNW. The grave was found, and the N part of the pit destroyed, when the W foundation trench was cut for the N-most block of the Medical Faculty building. The mouth of the EG pithos, 1, faced ESE; it had suffered slight damage from the machine. Three small EG cups, 3-5, were clustered at its base, with another, 2, resting on it. Inside were 7-8, miniature cups, 6, a miniature jug-aryballos and 9, a skyphos, all EG. In the HL grave T 293 immediately to the S was an EG oinochoe (293.1), which must have come from T. 280. From sieving earth in the pithos came a large faience bead fi, a quantity of seeds (perhaps vetch, or the like), probably not ancient, and about twenty small scraps of bone, some of which could have been rodent rather than human. As the miniature pots also suggest, this was probably an infant inhumation, whose bones had scarcely survived. POTTERY 1. COARSE NECKED PITHOS. H. 78.5. DR. c. 37.

Glass badly corroded, creamy white with gold and black speckled surface, laminating outwards from centre. Tomb 282 N (figs. 3, 48; plate 38 b) Shaft Grave. Shaft: 1.75 X 0.90, at least 0.50 deep. Pit: 1.35 X 0.72, 0.60 deep. The shaft was rectangular in plan, the outline rather irregular. The sides were straight. At the bottom was a roughly oval pit, the W side straighter than the others. Two possible covers were found upended, up to 0.15 thick, one 0.70 long, the other 0.65. These would have rested on the ledge-surround at the top of the pit, at the bottom of the shaft. The grave was at the NE limit of the N group of chamber tombs, immediately E of the chamber of T. 292. The orientation was NNE- SSW. The grave was found following mechanical excavation of the N-most E-W foundation for the N-most block of the Medical Faculty building. It was largely undamaged by this process, but had been completely looted. The two possible cover-slabs were upended in the grave pit, while another, smaller stone lay on the floor. The handful of small, worn DA sherds found in the hard, light brown fill, were probably alien. The grave type suggests a SM date. Tomb 283 n (Figs. 3, 49; plates 38 c-d, 39) Extant L. overall: 4.90 Extant dromos: L. 2.90 W. 1.00-1.12 (stomion) Stomion: W. 0.82 Depth 0.40 Chamber: 1.90 X 1.50. The outline of the dromos widened slightly towards the stomion. What remained of it rose 0.50 in vertical distance from the chamber floor/ stomion at an even angle of n°. The stomion had large, well-defined rectangular door jambs. The entrance was elaborately blocked. Two large rectangular slabs of white limestone were set on end, the S block at an angle of 8° from the vertical, side-by-side, like double doors. The S block (0.90 X 0.50), very carefully cut with a rabbet c. 0.08 wide on one long and one narrow side, was clearly a spolium' the N block may also have been in reuse. Gaps between these slabs and the dromos walls, and between each other, were sealed by stone packing. The bases of the two slabs were well above the dromos floor; the N slab rested on two superimposed rough stones, the S slab on 0.25 of earth. The chamber was rectangular in plan, with straight, or nearly straight sides, and sharp corners; its longer axis was at right angles to the dromos. Three limestone stands were set in the floor, Stand A, unworked, but with a hole in it, in the NW corner, Stand B, also unworked, in the NE, Stand C, worked - or, at least, rectangular, just S of centre. Much of the roof was lost; what remained was 1.10 high. There was a niche (0.64 X 0.50 X 0.65 high) in the N face of the dromos, its centre 1.80 from the stomion. Two large blocking stones (0.50 X 0.40 X 0.20; 0.60 X 0.40 X 018) were apparently in situ, though there was a gap of c. 0.25 between their tops and their niche's high, domed roof. The tomb was in the middle of the rather irregular N-S line of chamber tombs (292-287-285-283-294-306) that formed the N-most element of that part of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was ESE-WNW, the chamber at the E end of the dromos. The tomb was found when the W end of its dromos was removed by the mechanical excavation of the W foundation trench of the N-most block of the Medical Faculty building. The chamber had been entered from above and looted in antiquity; it was in chaos.</page><page sequence="249">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 280, 282-3 231 Before the tomb could be excavated 0.50-0.80 of heavy, sticky brown earth was removed. This may have been a fill to support a ruined wall of apparently no great antiquity a little E of the tomb, which ran approximately NW-SE. A small patch of a possible water-worn pebble floor seen in the adjacent section may have been an associated courtyard surface. From this fill came fi, Turkish tobacco pipes, Í2, a bronze object (perhaps a mirror handle) and Í27, iron clamp. Although it contained some sherds and objects, the dromos-ñll of hard light brown-yellow earth with kouskouras lumps appeared undisturbed, echoed by the state of the blocking stones of both niche and entrance. Above floor level were £3, bronze stud, f4, small incised clay whorl, f5, steatite roundel, fl6, serpentine whorl or button. An almost complete LG oinochoe, 1, was high in the fill beside the s blocking stone. 2, base of Atticizing lekythos-oinochoe, was beside the niche's E blocking stone. £7, tiny bronze pin-head, was nearby. In the centre of the dromos, near the machine's cut, was a small patch of burnt earth, a little above the floor. Scattered throughout the fill were many bronze flakes. In the chaotic condition in which the chamber was found, no guess can be made as to the original position of anything; the only associations are lids found to fit pots once both were mended. Excavation of the chamber proper began at 1.25 above its floor, where some unburnt human limb bones were found. 0.40 lower, in the stomion, what seemed to be two skulls were found (perhaps parts of one and the same skull). Pieces of unburnt bone were found right down to the floor. There was no trace of an intrusive HL grave; so it seems that the tomb must have contained at least one inhumation. At least one adult, and one adult male were represented among bits of bone collected throughout. Two scraps of animal bone, one from a sheep/goat leg, were found near the floor. Still high above the floor (1. 18-0. 93) in the area behind the N door-jamb were fg, iron strip, fio, iron pin fragment and fu, iron spit fragment; f8, iron pin fragment, was 0.30 further SE. Behind the blocking stone (below the skull(s)), between 0.60-0.70 above the floor, was an area of tightly packed smashed pottery (8-14) and objects (£12-25). At its centre was a large rim sherd of the MG pithos, 12, surrounded by pieces of the EG pithos, 14. To the W was 10, neck of an E-MG oinochoe, with 13, EG jug-aryballos, next to it. SW of these were 8 (Corinthian MG aryballos) and 9, Attic MG I pyxis lid, later fitted to the pyxis 46, not recognized during excavation. Against the S door-jamb was a large piece of 11, PGB straight- sided pithos, other pieces of which were throughout the fill down to the floor; its lid, 31, was against the back wall at a lower level. Among the objects were fragments of iron spits (fi2, 14-15, ig-20, 24), a sword-point (fi8), a knife (f2i) and a spearhead (£25). fi7, 22-23 were bronze sheet fragments. The iron dirk fi6 was at the same level, but towards the SE corner. Beneath this group and some intervening earth the chamber was filled with a mass of broken pottery, from c. 0.50 above the floor. Only sherds of distinctive shape were numbered in the field. A LG-EO lekythos, 15, was in the stomion. In the NW corner were bits of an MG pithos and lid, 16, 17. Working clockwise round the chamber, 21, lower part of an EG pithos, was near mid-N wall; 23, 0.80 to the SE, was more of it. Next was the M-LG lekythos, 24 with, just to its N, 25, E-MG cup. In the NE corner were an EO cup, 26, and a M-LG hydria, 27. Sherds along the centre of the back wall included 23 {supra), a coarse, straight-sided EG pithos, 28, part of an O bird askos, 2g (the rest found scattered on the floor); a MG oinochoe, 30, and the lid, 31 {supra). With these vases were f2, 2g, 30 (bronze vessel fragments); Í32"335 36 (iron spit fragments); £46, fire-dog fragments taken up with 33 {infra), £34 (iron knife) and £35 (iron waste). An Attic MG I oinochoe, 32, was almost in the SE corner, while WNW was 33, part of an ash urn, close S of which were bronze sheet scraps, fji.</page><page sequence="250">232 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Near the centre was 18, part of a large PGB lid, fitting 52, the coarse straight-sided pithos later recomposed; £37, bronze pin, was close. Immediately SW was 20, part of a LG pithos; to the S, 19, part of a LG lid. NE of 18 was part of a MG bucchero pithos, 22. After the removal of this mass of pottery the floor showed in places. Parallel with the S wall was f39, large fragment of a fire-dog. Between it and Stand C were 40 (PGB-EG oinochoe), 43 (E-MG cup) and 36, head of an O bird askos (see 29, supra); 39 was another fragment by the N wall, with 37, remains of another bird askos and 38, EG oinochoe. Close, beside Stand A, was £40, bronze rivet from a weapon hilt. NW of Stand A were 42, a M-LG coarse jug and 41, EG amphoriskos, beside which was 45, a ?G conical cup. In the stomion were £41 (bronze rod), £|2 (Egyptian blue bead) and £82, part of a terracotta animal (?bull) figurine. In the SE corner £38 was a mass of bronze vessel fragments with the Attic MG cup 34 to the N; 35, miniature PGB-EG hydria, was against the centre of the back wall. Two conjectures can be made about original locations. First, in view of the positions of the EG or ?EG 38, 41 near Stand A, there may have been an EG urn on it; this might have been 23 (+ 21). Second, the concentration of metal finds in the E and SE, centred on £38 in the SE corner, points to a well-endowed interment in this area. Associable urns are 33, 11, 28 - or even 23 (+ 21). The evidence of the forty-five vases numbered in the field, combined with those subsequently repaired from sherds, shows sixteen pithoi that will certainly have been ash- urns and five more (three amphorae, a bell-krater, a pedestalled krater) that might have been. The first use seems to have been in PGB: PGB straight-sided pithoi were 11 (+ lid 31), 28, 52 (+ lid 18); other vases were the LPG-PGB hydria 92 (Pearliest item) and the PGB jug-aryballoi, 79-80, lekythos, 87, coarse jug, 97, and cups 105, 106. With these might go the PGB-EG pieces 35 hydria, 38 and 40 oinochoai, 51 and 58 coarse pyxides, 75 lid for the former; and the Attic MG pieces 9 + 46 pyxis, 32 oinochoe, 34 cup. There were three certain EG urns - 14, 21 + 23 and the coarse pithos 101. Other EG vases were 2, 13, 41 (supra) and 48 cup, 58 amphora, 63, 78 lekythoi, 90 kalathos; with them might go the Cycladic amphora 91. To E-MG belong 10 + 55 oinochoe, 25, 43 cups. There were three MG pithoi - 12, 16 and 22; other MG items were 8 (Corinthian aryballos), 47, 74 lids, 30 oinochoe, 85 aryballos, 96, 103 cups (the former Cycladic), 102 (Attic MG krater foot) and 108 amphora. M-LG vases were 24, 84 lekythoi, 27 hydria, 42 jug and 86 aryballos. LG urns numbered four - the pithoi 20, 49, 56 and 76; also LG were the lids 17, 57, 60, 68-70, the oinochoe 1, the lekythoi 83, 88, 93 and the cup 104. LG-EO were the fragmentary pithos 99, the lekythos 15 and the aryballos 94. EO is represented by a single urn, the pithos 53, the lids 61, 64-6, the cup 26, the bird askos fragments 36-7, the skyphos 62, the jugs 77 and 81, and the aryballoi 82 and 89. To LO belong the lid 67, and the oinochoai 100 and 107. Forty-two finds were numbered in the field, the remainder selected from the quantities of broken bronze and iron collected with the broken pottery. Bronzes included cauldron rims (f29, 80), vessel fragments (£38, 76-77, 81), tinker's patches (£74-755 78)&gt; sheet fragments (fi7, 22-23, 26&gt; 30-31, 79), a rod (£41). Iron items were fragments of spits (fi-12, 14, 19-20, 24, 28, 32-3, 36, 47, 49, 52, 55, 61, 69-71) with a total L. of 9.83. Fire-dog fragments were £39, 45-46, 48, 51, 53, 62, 68. Iron swords were fi8, 50 and 63 - nearly complete, but composed of seven fragments from as many locations. The iron dirks fi6, 54, 56-57 were all incomplete. Iron knives were £21, 34, 59 (?two), 66 (?two). Iron spearheads were £25, fs8-part (two), £64 (two), £72 (two). Javelins were fs8-part (two). The weapon numbers suggest there were three to four warrior burials in the tomb.</page><page sequence="251">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 283 233 FUHEKY (FLATES 2 111b) 1. OINOCHOE. H. 29.5.

Two small lengths of rod are corroded on to this. The total L. present is c. 45 cms., but the pieces are not continuous. It is certain that some, at least, of these pieces came from a different specimen from that represented in 39, and therefore that there was more than one fire-dog in the tomb (see also 51 below). 46.

Four pieces, of which one is from the very ruined hilt: L. 6.8, W at shoulders 3.8; one bronze rivet survives. The other three scraps are from a blade or blades; one at least appears to have come from the same weapon as the hilt, but there are no joins. 55. IRON OBELOI frs.

Stomion: 0.60 X 0.30 (including stone jambs) 1.00 X 0.25 (excluding stone jambs). Chamber: 2.14 X 1.50. H. 1.38. The unusually deep dromos was widest near the stomion; the N wall was slightly concave. It rose without a step from the stomion for a vertical distance of 0.70, at a mean angle of 50. There was a neatly cut rectangular door-jamb on the N side of the stomion. Against this and against the dromos wall opposite was set a stone 'jamb', rectangular in section (0.28 X 0.16), c. 0.62 high, a unique structural feature in the cemetery. There had been heavy kouskouras fall from above the stomion, before the last interments were made, for they stood on its debris. The entrance was sealed by large, flattish, unworked blocking stones, which leaned towards the opening at different angles (one of the two larger was 0.80 X 0.40 X 0.15, set at an angle of 38o to the vertical), so placed as to form a lean-to shelter for interments which could not be fitted into the chamber. The chamber was ovoid in plan, set off-centre to the dromos, the longer axis at right angles to it, the larger half to the NE, the narrower end on the SW. There had been some fall in the chamber, though the roof was partly intact. The floor was pebble-strewn; in it were set three irregular stone stands - Stand A (0.40 X 0.22) in the N, Stand B (0.48 X 0.26) in the NE, Stand C (0.38 X 0.30) just SE of centre. The tomb was part of the rather irregular N-S line of chamber tombs (292-287-286-285-283-294-306) forming the N-most element in that part of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was ESE-WSW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found when much of the top of the dromos was exposed in digging the N-most</page><page sequence="258">24O KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY E-W foundation trench of the Medical Faculty (here 2.50 wide). Both dromos and chamber lay sufficiently deep to have suffered no material damage. In antiquity the HL Ts. 289, 291 just impinged on the S side near the stomion. £T. 284', a pit full of animal bones cut the N side of the dromos at its W end. It was not possible to excavate the full length of the dromos. The fill suggested the tomb had been robbed. It contained recognizable pots and finds, as well as sherds, at all levels. The most significant was 7, fragments of a large PGB coarse straight-sided pithos, among very blackened earth near the floor, 0.80-1.50 from the stomion. Burnt bones (rare elsewhere in the dromos) included part of a jaw of a 9-10 year old. Within 7's base was a bronze pin fragment, £7; £8, another, was under it. Perhaps the other pin fragments in the dromos-ñli, £2, 5-6, 10, were also connected with 7. Among 7's sherds was the PGB-EG lid, 8; under them was the PG coarse tripod basin, 9. On the edge of the burnt area, near the N wall, was 10, part of the LPG ring kernos 68, later found deep within the chamber. 30, LPG lentoid flask, on the dromos floor under the kouskouras roof-fall covered by the blocking [supra) could have been part of the same cleaning-out operation. Other PG vases in the dromos, perhaps connected with this group, were 1, lid, 2, pyxis (PGB); just above the entrance, 3 (E-MPG coarse pithos), 4 (EG jug-aryballos). Loose in the fill were ft, 3 (javelin head fragments), £4 (terracotta animal's rump), 5 (bull's head spout), fg (stone bead), and a lump of burnt wood, pieces of obsidian, a piece of mudbrick/daub and scraps of bronze sheet. A LO oinochoe, 6, in the NE dromos angle could have been a late gift for the interment in 13 [infra). Below was fio [supra) and below again a LG oinochoe 11, surrounded by ?ash-urn sherds. Despite the debris in the dromos, the chamber was unrobbed, its later interments virtually undisturbed. It had apparently been in use from EPG to LO. Counting the possible child interment in 7, in the dromos [supra) there were fourteen interments, distributed among two E-MPG urns (58, 5g), two LPG-PGB (61, 7g), one EG (71), one MG (3g), four MO (33, 36, 40, 41) and four LO (12, 13, 25, 27). Of the two bell-kraters, 60 (EPG) contained scraps of cremated bone while 82 (MPG) also served as a container for funerary crockery. The LO pithos 12 stood on fallen kouskouras outside the S stomion jamb, protected by the blocking, its lid, 16, in place. It contained a mature adult cremation, perhaps female, an aryballos, 22, iron pin, fi2, two bronze pins, £13-14. At its feet were 14, LO oinochoe, 18-ig, LO lids, with the LO skyphos 23 inside 18. The LO pithos 13 was next to, but set slightly back from 12, still in the dromos, but behind the blocking, still on fallen kouskouras. It was sealed by its lid, 15. It contained an elderly adult cremation, possibly female, a LO aryballos 20. At its feet were 17, LO oinochoe, 21, LO cup. 6 [supra) may have belonged. The LO pithos 24 was within the stomion, next to the s jamb, 0.10 lower than 12, 13, but still on fallen kouskouras. Its lid, 25, was in place. It contained the cremation of an adult female, perhaps elderly, with a LO aryballos, 28, and bronze tweezers, £15. The LO lid 31 and MO cup 32 were half under it. A MO oinochoe 65 at the base of the E-MPG 5g may have belonged. The lidless LO urn 27 was beside 24, to its NE. It held the cremation of a woman of 26-35, or somewhat older, with the LO aryballos, 2g. The LO oinochoe 26, between 24 and 27, could have belonged to either. The urn overlay the MO jug 38, and just overlapped the base of the half-fallen MG urn 3g. The urn 33 was within the chamber, centrally placed just back from the two stone jambs. Its broken lid 34 was in place, with the base of a MO cup, 35. It contained a cremation, possibly female, c. 18 years, remains of an aryballos, 42, MO polychrome lid, 43, £23, bronze</page><page sequence="259">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 285 241 rings, f25, iron pin, f2i + 22, ivory and bronze spectacle fibula, f25a, bronze strip fragments, fi8-i9, 24, beads of gold, bone, rock crystal, glass, fossil shell; the fishbone f2O may have also been an ornament. The MO jug 38 {supra) may have belonged, as may have a large O cup 64 against the wall beyond 38, and perhaps 62, MO skyphos stacked in 63, O kotyle found under the MG 39. The MO urn 36 stood S of 33, its richly decorated lid 37 in situ. It contained a mature (over 35) adult cremation, possibly female, and the LO aryballos, 44. The MO urn 40 stood behind 33 and 36. It contained an elderly adult cremation and the MO aryballos 55. Its lid was 565 the MO oinochoe 65 {supra) was below, overlying the tray 81. The broken lid 72 lay partly over the base of the EG pithos 71 {infra), beneath which and 81 was the EO lid 130 with 131 (joined 72) next to it. Below again was the floor strewn with sherds almost certainly from 71. The MO urn 41 was NE of, and touching 40. Its lid was 53. It contained a not very old cremation and the MO aryballos 54. An iron spit fragment adhering by oxidization to 41's side facing the back of the chamber may have been part of the spit £28. The lidless MG urn 39 was in front of 41, beside 33 and behind 27. It tipped towards the back of the chamber. It contained an adult cremation and several vases:- 47, MG aryballos, 48, E-MG small oinochoe, 49, 52, Cypriot BoR II lekythoi, 51, MG aryballos, 46 + 50, joining fragments of MO jug (burnt - 46 was near the top of the urn's contents, 50 well down). There were also fi6, glass bead, fi7, bronze wheel-shaped affixes. (The only other MG vases are the Attic MG II oinochoe, 67, just inside the s door-jamb, and the upper half of a krater with horses, 153, repaired from scattered fragments.) Since there were no LG urns in this tomb, and only one LG vase, 11 (found in the dromos, supra), this may have belonged to the interment in the MG urn 39. The EG urn 71 was recomposed from sherds found all over the centre of the floor. Though there was only one other EG pot (jug-aryballos, 4), some of the small pieces of PGB (tray, 66, oinochoai 84, 120, 140-1, 1435 jug 144) or PGB-EG (cups 7, 87, in, 113, 133, oinochoai 132, 145) found scattered all round the chamber towards the walls may also have belonged. The remaining six urns were placed around the walls. With them was a number of smaller pots, some of which could be associated with them, but many which could not, and iron spits, fire-dogs, weapons and bronze vessels. Just within the N stone jamb were numerous small pots of mixed date, all within a space 0.50 diameter. Uppermost were the O 62-64 {supra), with the iron spearhead £40 near 62-63. To the W were the three LPG oinochoai 74-6. Between and below them were the MPG bell-skyphoi 83, 119 (stacked), 77-78. Between 76 and 64 were, one above another, the O lids 73, 117, the PGB plate, 118. Below again was 120, small PGB oinochoe. SE of this pile was the Attic LPG kantharos 121, with 122, LPG pyxis, E of it, the EPG oinochoe, 123, and the Euboean LPG amphoriskos, 124, to the NE. The coarse LPG-PGB pithos, 61, was set against the N wall, above Stand A, tilted to the W. It contained a mature, not elderly cremation, bronze pins £36-37, and gold leaf attachments £38-39, 66. The bronze cauldron £26 partly overlay 61, pieces of the spits £27-276 overlay both. Next to, and level with the rim of 61 were the high ends of three fire-dog fragments, £30-32, laid aslant in front of 82, ending near the back wall, beneath a bundle of spits £43-45. These metal objects could only have been so placed after 61 was in the position as found. This is unlikely to have been its original position as there were some small vessels beneath it-114, EPG amphoriskos containing 115-116, MPG bell-skyphoi; in, 113, PGB-EG cups; 112, EO cup. Lower, on and around Stand A, were 137, MPG bell-skyphos (on it); 135, LPG small lid (S of it); 134, Corinthian LPG pyxis (e of it); 138, its lid, 139, MPG bell-skyphos (n of it).</page><page sequence="260">242 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Among, and under this group were fragments of the EG 71 [supra). It follows that none of the pieces under 61 reached the positions in which they were found before 71 was broken. Because of the EO 112 (supra), 61 cannot have been placed where it was found earlier than EO. The LPG-PGB tub pithos 79 and 79a, its lid, appeared undisturbed, in its original position on Stand B. The Attic LPG skyphos, 57, also seemed in situ on the lid. 79 contained an adult cremation, probably male in view of £35, dirk, found with it, and two bronze studs found in the sieve, which may have been from it. An iron pin fragment was identified during study of 79's cremation. At the front of 79 was 136, a LPG 'bird' askos. A MPG stirrup-jar, no, was between 61 and 79. The large MPG bell-krater 82 was immediately S of 79, tilted slightly w. In it was the smaller EPG bell-krater, 60, containing scraps of cremated bone. Inside 82, beneath 60 were 91-109, 19 MPG small vases - oinochoai, jug-aryballoi and bell-skyphoi. 60 was thus a unique instance of a separate bone-container within a larger funerary urn. Part of the cauldron £26 and the spits £28-29 lay on top of 82. Fire-dogs £30-32 were in front of it. Other fire-dogs, £46-47, their ends under £30-32, were below the back of 82. 82 was not in its original position for, as well as metal objects (infra) there were found under it 133, PGB cup; 140, PGB oinochoe; 132, PGB-EG oinochoe. Beneath these and £30-32 (supra) were more sherds of the EG 71 (supra). The small East Greek SubPG krater 89 was jammed between 82 and 59. 90, LPG-PGB oinochoe, and £34, bronze vessel, containing f34a, faience beads, were inside it, but there were no bones. The spit £29 went over the top of 89. The bell-skyphos 128 by its foot (on top of Stand C) may have belonged; £42, bronze scabbard or quiver facing, was partly underneath it. The empty coarse pithos, 59, lay on its side, mouth facing the S wall. Between it and the back wall were 80, Cypriot BoR II lekythos, 126, PGB cup with 142, bell-skyphos, stacked in it; other skyphoi, 127, 150, were nearby. The skyphoi might have belonged to 59; 80 could not. The coarse pithos 58, SW of 59, was very like it. Standing upright, it contained an adult (not elderly) male cremation and 86, LPG pyxis. Between it and the wall was the pyxis, 125, which could have belonged. 86, however, shows this was a LPG interment, and suggests that 68, the LPG ring kernos at the foot of 58, might have been deposited with it - though part of 68 (10) was found in the dromos near the sherds of 7 (supra). Also at the foot of 58 were 66 (PGB tray), 69 (LPG pyxis), with 88 (Cypriot BoR I lekythos) inside, 70 PGB cup, and 87, the same (under 58). Between 68 and the S stone jamb lay the Attic MG II oinochoe 67, the PGB oinochoe 84 below it. 85, Cypriot BoR II lekythos, was next to 84, partly below the PGB tray, 66. After removal of the urns that lined the s wall there remained a complex of small pots and metal objects in the vicinity of Stand C. Between stand and wall were £43-455 a bundle of at least ten well preserved spits, beneath the centre of which was 141, PGB oinochoe. The NE end of the bundle rested on the small Attic LPG amphora 129, just NE of Stand C. £46-47 (supra), fire-dogs, lay across 129, their SW ends under the fire-dogs £31-32 (supra) whose SW ends underlay £43-45. As fragments of the EG 71 (supra) were below £31-32, not only was this complex of fire-dogs and spits interconnected, but it could not have reached its final position until after 7i's destruction. In addition to this main arrangement, £49 (spit fragment) was on top of £43-45, £48 (spit fragment) was parallel to 129, passing under £46-47. £50, spit fragment, was at right angles to £48 with 133, 144, 132, 140 (all, supra). The points of £41 (spear) and £54 (javelin) were under 129's neck. Between 129's mouth and the wall, £53</page><page sequence="261">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 285 243 was a mass of oxidized iron, including spits, spear- and javelin-heads. Under 129 were £56 (spear fragment) and £57 (fire-dog fragment); N of 129 were scattered faience beads, £55. Under £43-455 at the base of 129, was £52, javelin-head, overlying 143, PGB oinochoe. £51, spearhead, was under £31-32 (supra). The SE end of £j2 (supra) was on the NE corner of Stand C; it lay beside £32. Its other half, £60, was beneath it. £6o covered £6i, oxidized iron mass including six javelins and a sword/dirk hilt. 145 [supra) was immediately N of these. NE of Stand C, lower than 129, were the PGB-EG lid, 147, the PGB oinochoe 146 inside it, £58, iron double axe nearby. SW were 148-149, LPG bell-skyphoi with, beyond the SE corner of Stand C, a large fragment of a bronze vessel, £59. SW of this, against the wall was 150 (supra) beside 151, Cypriot BoR II lekythos. Just within the N stone door-jamb were £64, iron double axe and £63, iron knife. Near the wall, where 61 had stood, was £62, iron spearhead. Though the empty E-MPG pithos 59 may have held an EPG interment, the other E-MPG pithos, 58 did not, since it contained an LPG pot. The ?EPG pithos 7 in the dromos had the PGB-EG 8 among its sherds, and could also have been an older urn used for a later burial. Thus the earliest certain interment was in the MPG 82, after which came an LPG interment in the E-MPG urn 58, followed by the LPG-PGB 61 and 79. Then came the EG 71 (but no EG pots, so perhaps associated with PGB and PGB-EG pots and therefore early in EG). The next urn, the MG 39, contained several small MG pots [supra). It was found tilted, and evidently disturbed. Inside it also was the broken MO jug 46 + 50, which may indicate a reuse of the same urn after a long interval, leaving the original MG goods in situ. The probable order of the later cremations, based on position, would have been: in MO, 41, 40, 36, 33; in LO, 27, 24, 13, 12. Nothing can be proved about the original associations of the metal finds on the floor under the spits and the fire-dogs. But the spits and fire-dogs themselves may have belonged to one of the later interments. Their condition was so good that they must have been where they were originally deposited. The chief complex of fire-dogs, etc., overlay fragments of the EG urn 71, which cannot have been smashed until the first interment, after a long gap, in the O period. Moreover, the irons must have been placed where they were found after the LPG-PGB 61 was relocated; this can have been no earlier than the placing of the EO lid 112 under 61. The presence of 112 suggests that an EO interment may have been disturbed when the great rearrangement of the tomb took place. The earliest MO urn following that rearrangement, 41, was found with a fragment of iron adhering through oxidization to its back. Was this, then, the owner of the fine banqueting equipment, including the bronze cauldron £26, with irons above and below it? POTTERY (PLATES 219-30) 1. SMALL LID (FIG. 138). PH. 4.2. D. 6.8.

Thirteen main pieces, plus numerous scraps, all in a ruinous state, belonging to at least two obeloi. Total L. represented 145; section generally c. 1 squared. 28. IRON OBELOS frs. An unusually well-preserved, though incomplete specimen. Four joining pieces, to give L. 56; section generally c. 1 squared, but at one end it appears to thicken to c. 1.4 squared, and this may indicate the proximity of the head; at the other end, an unknown length towards the tip is missing, 29. IRON OBELOS frs. Another incomplete but substantially-preserved example. Made up of nine joining (L. 85) and one non-joining (L. 8.4) pieces. The total length, therefore, will have been at least 93.4. Broken at both ends. The uncorroded section is revealed as being, in this case anyway, only about 0.8 squared but, as with 28, there is a perceptible thickening towards one end. 30. IRON FIRE-DOG (FIG. 179). This, our best- preserved fire-dog, greatly facilitates the reconstruction even of such relatively complete examples as 2i9*f56(i). Six main joining pieces almost complete the 'hull', to a total length of 133.8; at both ends, the transition from the horizontal bar to the upright terminal is clearly visible, but the decorative elements of the actual 'bow' and 'stern' are not preserved. The main section of the hull has W. 2.4, Th. 0.6. Parts of both the arched supports are also preserved, the 'stern' one being still partly attached to the 'hull' and the placement of the 'bow' one being also identifiable. In the better-preserved stern support, the H. to the underside of the arch is 9.4. The measurements in general correspond rather to the larger size of fire-dog, as 2i9.f56(i), than to the smaller variety (compare 31/32 below). 31. 32. IRON FIRE-DOG frs. (fig. 179).

The two arched supports, though badly damaged, survive in large part. H. to underside of arch, c. 8.7 on the 'bow' example, which is the better- preserved, but has been violently twisted sideways in antiquity. The dimensions seem systematically smaller than those of 30 (ii) 'stern' piece, which corresponds closely in scale with (i) and proved to belong to it once conservation was undertaken. L. 10. 1; section here changes from W. c. 1.5 to upright rectangle corresponding in scale to the 'bow'-piece of (i). The extremity of the stern tapers to a tip, which is bent sharply back, simulating the shape of the stern of an early Greek warship. The restored length of the whole piece must thus be more than 107 cms. 33. Vacai 34. BRONZE BEAKED JUG WITH BUCKET HANDLE (FIG. 170; plate 285). H. 14. H. with handle raised 21. Max. D. 13.

These were our best-preserved obeloi; several are very nearly complete, and the heads are present in seven cases. The fact that each individual obelos is broken into several pieces, and that these pieces are often corroded on to pieces of other obeloi, makes measurement very difficult. But the best-preserved specimen can be joined up, in six pieces, to make it complete but for the very tip: L. 98.4. A second example, in five pieces, will join to a L. of 91.3, but this is missing a considerable length towards its tip and still has a section of 0.8 squared at its final break. A third specimen has the tip entirely preserved. The standard section is c. 1 squared; the heads, under heavy corrosion, appear to have a pyramidal form, Th. c. 1.6, but the least corroded example shows a slightly different form, with a rounded, almost hemispherical head, sharply off-set from the shaft. 46-7. IRON FIRE-DOG fr. A large part of the 'hull' of a fire-dog. Seven joining pieces, to give L. 101; the section shows, at one end but not the other, the transition into a square rod which shortly precedes the upright terminal. The section elsewhere is the usual horizontal bar, c. 1.6 by 0.5. Two pieces are visible where the arched supports may have been fitted; they are 66 cms. apart, but must have been asymmetrically placed, since one is only 13.5 cms. short of the break with the square section (and therefore was not very much further from the terminal), whereas the other is 18 cms. from the break with the flat section. The most interesting feature is perhaps that the object has been bent round into a U-shape, more or less symmetrically (cf. 2i9.fi38); this was done with the arched supports apparently on the inner side of the 'U'. 48-50. IRON OBELOI frs.

Tomb 286 N (figs. 3, 51; plates 44 a-b) L overall: c. 2.45 L. of dromos: 1.50 W. 0.80-0.70. stomion: W. 0.66 Depth c. 0.15 Chamber: 0.95 X 0.92 The outline of the short dromos was uneven. It rose only slightly from the stomion towards its end at an angle of 2°. The stomion was incomplete, a squarish jamb on the S side, vestigial on the N. No blocking remained. From the outer edge of the stomion to the chamber floor was a drop of 0.20, at an angle of 42o. The oval chamber had lost its roof; 0.36 of the back wall survived. The tomb was immediately N of the dromos of T. 285, part of the rather irregular N-S line of chamber tombs (292-287-286-285-283-294-306) forming the N-most element in that part of</page><page sequence="272">254 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was ESE-WNW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found as a result of the mechanical digging of the foundation trenches of the N-most building of the Medical Faculty. It was both small and shallow. The pit CT. 284' (full of animal bones) was cut into the dromos, almost at right angles, and suggested an HL inhumation grave (a fragment of an HL cup was found just N, in T 286's dromos). The tomb had been robbed. Two groups of pots, likely to have been actual interments, remained. Near the NE side of the chamber were 2, fragmentary EG pithos, and 4, EG aryballos. Opposite, in the S of the chamber, were 3, fragmentary EG pithos, and, extending in a line from it, 6, EG cup, 5, EG oinochoe, 1, EG aryballos, 7, EG pithos, and 8, EG shallow skyphos, were in fragments in the fill.

Tomb 287 N (figs. 3, 51; plate 42) L. overall: 3.80 dromos: L . 2.70 W. 1. 00-1.05 stomion: not preserved Chamber: 1.66 X 1.16. Preserved H. 0.94 The line of the dromos was interrupted by niches and side chamber. It rose from the step down into the chamber a vertical distance of c. 0.70, first at an angle of 130, then 26o. The step descended 0.45 into the chamber at an angle of 74o. Stomion and blocking were lost. The chamber was sub-rectangular, but its S and E walls were slightly curved and its corners rounded. The floor of the chamber was at least 1.85 below modern ground surface. Most of the roof was lost. A finely cut sub-rectangular side chamber (2 on plan, FIG. 51) opened off the S side of the dromos, 1.66 X 0.90, reached by a step down from the dromos of 0.45. It had narrow door jambs; one of the roughly rectangular blocking slabs was still in situ (c. 0.50 X 0.40), set on end, covering half the opening. Its roof was intact. Niche 1 was cut into the W part of the N dromos wall, 1.16 X 0.60; its floor was 0.40-0.16 above the dromos floor. Its roof was lost. Niche 3 was cut into the E part of the N dromos wall, c. 0.15 from niche 1, 0.86 X 0.95, its floor 0.24-0.32 above the dromos floor, on the level of the floor of niche 1. Its roof was lost. The tomb was part of the rather irregular N-S line of chamber tombs (292-287-286-285-283-294-306) forming the N -most element in that part of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was ESE-WNW, the chamber on the E side of the dromos.</page><page sequence="273">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE Ts. 286 7 2$$ The tomb was found when the foundation trench for the N central block of the Medical Faculty building passed over the W send of the dromos and the empty niche 1 , causing minimal damage. The chamber had been looted. The deeply cut HL T 288 lay at right angles to T 287, its N end impinging on the S side of the erstwhile stomion and the SW corner of the chamber, part of whose roof it cut. Its floor, however, was 0.57 above the chamber floor, and those who dug it may not have reached the floor deposit. 1 was a LG pithos partly overlying the E part of the side chamber, 1.00 above the latter's floor. It appeared to be broken in situ, and was probably a later interment, unconnected with this tomb. There were bronze flakes, part of an obsidian blade and a worked pebble in the dromos fill and upper chamber fill. A line of piled stones stretched across the dromos between niche 3 and the side chamber. The lowest stones were on fill 0.30 above the floor; among them were sherds (3) later joined to 11, PGB amphora, the bottom of which was on the chamber floor. The stones must have been from the blocking of the chamber, perhaps also from the side chamber, neatly stacked by those who had robbed the tomb. In the chamber, 9, a coarse pithos and 15, coarse cauldron, were against the S wall, with 13, amphora, smashed upside down on 15. The bell-krater, 10, was N of 9, while 11, [supra) was in the centre at the back. A M-LG pithos, 7, lay smashed near the entrance. All these were suitable as ash-urns; 9 had contained an adult cremation, 15, a quite young adult cremation. Most of the smaller vases were in the S of the chamber, but 22, 23, bell-skyphoi, in the N, and 2, cup, were high in the fill. 2 [supra), 8, a hydria, 17, coarse lid, 12, 12a, straight- sided pyxis and lid, 19, pyxis and 16, cup were perhaps associable with 11 [supra), the only PGB urn. The LPG oinochoe, 14, lay next to 15 [supra) of similar date; they may have been deposited together. 13, the earliest vase, was MPG, 9-10 were LPG-PGB - small pots of similar date were five PGB bell-skyphoi - 18, 20-21 (stacked by 9), 22, 23 [supra). The side chamber appears to have been looted; with the exception of f4 (bronze rivet ?) found in 30, only pots were found. Many of these were intact, or nearly so. This chamber was evidently intended for a single burial, a young person whose unburnt skull fragments were in a small bell-krater, 24, on its side near the E end. 24, and 25, oinochoe beside it, were LPG, as were 27, pyxis, 28, small lid, 29, 34, cups; the other small vases scattered round were PGB - 26, pyxis with 35, small lid; 30, 31, 3ia~33, oinochoai. The unburnt bones imply secondary burial - 24 was a theke rather than an ash-urn (n of the pottery, however, was a patch 0.50 X 0.30 of burnt matter, as though a token pyre). Niche 1 was empty. In niche 3 were the LPG cups, 4-6, obviously scattered when the niche was robbed. POTTERY (PLATES 231-3) 1. TWO-HANDLED PITHOS. H. 41. DR. 15. Half preserved. Concave inset lip, rising rim.

Stomion: 0.86 X 0.34 Chamber: 2.08 X 1.80 Extant H. 1.38 The dromos could not be fully excavated: it may have been long, in view of its gentle gradient and the tomb's great depth. What remained was narrow, widening gradually towards the chamber. The dromos rose 0.30 in vertical distance from stomion to the excavated limit, 2.35 below the modern surface, at an angle of 7.5o. The short stomion had small door jambs forming right angles with the dromos, but curved on the inner side. The two lowest stones of the blocking were still in situ; the upper (0.86 X 0.23 X 0.12) occupied the whole width between the jambs, and was upright; the lower (0.66 X 0.36 X 0.17) was flat, supplemented by chock stones, c. 0.20 above the top of the upper slab a very tall stone (1.00 X 0.46 X 0.40) was set in the N dromos- stomion angle. All these and many other blocking wall stones found displaced in the chamber or dromos were of local white limestone, and were probably spolia. There was a 0.30 step from stomion to chamber floor. The chamber was rhomboidal rather than rectangular in plan, with acute NW and SE angles. The corners were sharply cut, the sides straight. The surviving walls were vertical, with no sign of the spring of the roof, which must have been high. The floor, lightly strewn with fine gravel, was at least 3.00 below modern surface. Niches had been cut into the dromos faces at varying levels. 'Niche 1' proved merely part of the robber cutting above the chamber. On the SW side, close to surface, may have been 'Niche 2'; its outline was never clear, its floor uncertain, and it was empty. Immediately below was Niche 3, partly set back from, partly overhanging Niche 4, extant size 1.36 X 0.50, floor at least 1. 00 below modern surface. The floor probably once extended to the dromos edge. Its roof had been dug away. Niche 4 was below again (extant size 1.30 X 0.86, floor at least 1.58 below modern surface) and a small, unnumbered, empty niche between it and the chamber. Their floors were c. 1.00 above dromos floor. On the N side, near the chamber, was Niche 5, high up</page><page sequence="276">258 KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY (0.80 X 0.50, floor at least 1.36 below modern surface). Its roof was partly preserved; much of its blocking may have been in place. Niche 6 (not completely excavated; W. at least 1.46, depth 0.76, floor at least 2.48 below modern surface) began c. 1.00 from the stomion, its floor near dromos floor level. It was divided from the dromos by a neatly cut ridge of kouskouras, 0.20 wide, 0.12 high, on which remained four stones of the blocking wall it had once supported. The tomb was part of the rather irregular N-S line of chamber tombs (292-287-286-285-283-294-306) forming the N-most element in that part of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was E by S, W by N. The chamber was at the E end of the dromos. One of the most mechanically dug foundation trenches for the N-most building of the Medical Faculty passed over the tomb's chamber which, being so deep, was untouched. The tomb first appeared as a head of brown earth N of T 287, and was at first supposed possibly to be the spoil heap of the robbers of T. 287. It later proved a separate cutting, with ragged, formless outline, covered by a mound of hard, sticky brown earth, to which spoil from the Medical Faculty building foundation trench had been added, so that it was 1. 30-1. 80 above general ground level. This prevented full excavation of the dromos. Robbers had apparently dug the tomb from the top, destroying the edges of the dromos, the chamber roof, perhaps 'Niche 2', the roofs of Niche 3 (in whole), 4 and 5 (in part). The fill of the tomb comprised:- (1) Upper fill, over dromos and chamber (2) Remaining contents of niches (3) Lower dromos fill (4) Upper chamber fill (5) Chamber's floor deposit But this division was only perfectly reliable in the case of (2). The difference between (1), (3) and (4) was of location, not soil change. With (4) and (5), it was not always easy to distinguish pots on the floor when the tomb was robbed from those that fell or were thrown on it. The contents ranged from PGB-LO. Niche 5 was MG, Niche 4 LG-EO, Niche 3 EO-LO; Niche 6 may have been O. A MG niche implies the chamber was already crowded in that period. The LG-O niches indicate later interments were made in the niches rather than clear out earlier chamber burials. With the exception of the MG 45, 56 all the numbered pots in the dromos and upper chamber fill were LG-LO; many were ash-urns. They are very likely to have come from the niches. Though there were also numerous small LG-O pots on the floor, there were no late ash-urns. The three recognizable urns of the floor deposit were MG; each had a number of smaller MG and also PGB, PGB-EG pots near enough to suggest connection. The tomb's history was probably:- (a) PGB, PGB-EG pottery-? interments (b) At least three MG interments in the chamber (c) MG interment in Niche 3 - ? one other MG dromos interment. (d) LG-LO interments in niches (e) Looting, when niche contents were thrown into both dromos and chamber The upper pit-like fill was brown soil as in the mound over the tomb, mixed with very large kouskouras lumps, mistaken for bedrock. It contained fi-9, 9a, 10-ioa, 11-14 and the O lids 1, 2 as well as numerous bronze flakes and scraps of burnt bone. Just below Niche 3, as far as Niche 4's floor level, objects were found near the N side of the dromos, in front of Niche 5, including fi2a, 13a, 14a, 15, 18-22 and the LO kotyle, 16. As fi2a, 15, 19, 21 were glass</page><page sequence="277">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 292 259 beads, and Niche 4 had remains of a necklace, there may be a connection. The iron pin £25, the silver ring £26 and the MO cup 14 were on the same side opposite Niche 3; the PC kotyle 15 was c. 0.50 NW. £23, 28, javelin fragments and an iron ring, were in fill over the chamber. Also found were £24, terracotta horse fragment, £79, carved bone handle. In Niche 3, a large flat stone more or less upright in the fill to the E might have been part of its blocking. The lower dromos fill was similar to the upper, containing many sherds, burnt bone scraps and bits of bronze, including £78, rim of a phiale, near the foot of the stone 'pillar' by the chamber entrance [supra). More of it (£36) was found high in the chamber, near the entrance and (£46) with the sherds of the LG/EO pithos 41. £77, bronze bowl fragment, was among smaller displaced blocking stones behind the two in situ. Also found were £73 , iron knife, £74, bone attachment, £75, glass bead. There were some larnax fragments set upright against the dromos wall at the W end of Niche 4, partly overlapping its entrance, perhaps once in reuse as part of the niche's blocking. The character of the upper chamber fill suggested that the robbers, after taking what they wanted from the chamber used it as a dump during their clearance of the niches. Above and around the first pots that appeared was much loose kouskouras; beneath, the same brown soil that had filled the dromos. These pots were on a level c. 1.00 above the chamber floor. In the NW corner were the smashed LG pithos and lid, 31, the EO jug, 25; SE, the LO oinochoe, 26 NW. Under 26 were the EO lekythos 33, aryballos 34, and alabastron 35. In the NE corner were the EO oinochoe 32, the lid 28, perhaps belonging to the EO polychrome pithos 42, whose sherds were just beneath. In the SE corner lying facing the back wall was the only pithos to retain any of its cremation. This was the EO 27; the cremation had been 'poor', but was otherwise uninformative. Near 27 was the neck of the EO amphora 44, whose base was on a lower level in the SE corner. 20 was also near 27, W of which were the remains of a LO pithos, 29. Between 27 and the back wall was the LO aryballos, 36. At this level £35-44 were scattered in the centre of the chamber, unattributable - £35, silver mounted boar's tusk, was 0.30 from the centre of the back wall. £49, ivory haft, somewhat below 31 [supra), may have belonged to it. The chamber's centre below these pots was full of stones, probably displaced not only from the upper part of the blocking, but from the niches too. Centrally placed was a well dressed square slab of local limestone, 0.66 X 0.60 X 0.20, lying at an angle; below its NW side was a similar, not so well finished block 0.52 X 0.39 X 0.13; to the S was a piece of gypsum 0.41 X 0.40 X 0.24. Some of the smaller stones seemed broken from larger worked blocks. Taken with the larnax fragments in the dromos [supra), such spolia evokes a previous Minoan presence. These stones occurred from 0.95-0.45 above the floor. Beneath them in places were cavities large enough for the passage of a small pot. The brown earth gradually gave way to a paler type with small kouskouras lumps, though the demarcation was not clear. There were collections of sherds, some recognizable as pots, around and under these stones. The LO aryballos, 37, was between the square slab and the door. Close to the NE side of the slab were sherds of a LG/EO pithos, 41, with £46 [supra) on top. In the NE corner was 42 [supra) and its associated items. S of this group, against the back wall, was the LO aryballos, 46. In the SE corner were intermingled sherds of three ash-urns, the EO amphora, 44, right in the corner, the LG-EO pithos 40 to the N, the O polychrome pithos 43 to the W. Near 44 was the LO cup, 55; w of 43 were Pits lid 38, and the O jug, 39. Under the square slab were some of the sherds of 45, the only MG urn in the upper chamber fill; there were others to the W. Also under the slab were £47, two very small pieces of gold leaf. Under the next stone were bronze sheet fragments, £45. Just under the stones</page><page sequence="278">26o KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY were £50-51 (iron tweezers and bronze fibula), £52-53 (glass beads, perhaps belonging to the Niche 4 necklace, infra). £48 was part of a bronze tweezer toward the NW corner, 0.55 above the floor, the rest of which, (£58-9) was found further SW, 0.25 above the floor. It might have belonged to the LG 31 {supra). The iron knife £54 lay with a mass of unrecognizable sherds in the SW corner - £57, javelin fragments, was near, but lower (0.23 above floor). Near the E corner was a sandcore glass fragment, £56. The mass of broken pottery continued under the stones, particularly round the edges of the chamber, to 0.25 above the floor. The only other recognizable vase was 56, MG oinochoe near the entrance. On or near the chamber floor were pots of every period PGB-O, though the only ash-urns were the MG 57, 64 and 114. Although no earlier urns were recorded during the excavation, among over a hundred vessels subsequently made up were the fine PGB straight-sided pithos 144 with birds and trees (its pieces widely dispersed all over the tomb), a fragment of a PGB neck pithos 234, and half of an EG pithos 150. Many of the small early pots found in the excavation may have belonged to these displaced urns; some, however, seem to have been associated with the MG urns. There were four instances of early pots being stacked with MG pots. Most of the LG-O pots were also small, and were in clear spaces on the floor or in gaps between earlier pots. There were some instances where they were found under MG and earlier vases. The broken MG pithos 114 lay in the NE corner facing the back wall, with two lids, 123 (EG) and 125 (MG) between its mouth and the corner. On top of these was the PGB lid, 61, above the LG-EO aryballos, 54. Between 114 and the N wall was the M-LG oinochoe 63; round, or under 114 were the PGB lekythos 113, PGB-EG oinochoai 92, 115, 134, the PGB-EG small lids 120, 126. Under 126 was the LG-EO aryballos 133. The EO 118, 119 lekythos and miniature oinochoe and the LG-EO miniature jug-aryballos, 122, were in a clear space S of 114's base, perhaps fallen from the EO pithos 42 some distance above. Near 114's base were the bone ornament Í69 and a bit of obsidian. In the urn were pieces of two iron knives (£70), the other parts of which (£66, 68) were on the floor 0.60 and 0.40 to the W, suggesting that objects found in the same area as f66, 68 might also belong to 114's interment. Near £68 were the PGB lid, 79, and the G coarse tripod jug, 78. On their far side, f66 was among a group of pots and objects, including MG cups, 82, 91, 101, a MG oinochoe, 100, a Phoenician oinochoe, 80, a Cypriot BoR juglet, 96, ditto lekythos 62, a PGB lekythos, 81, the M-LG aryballos, 95, Among these were £67 (javelin fragments) with, just above, £64-65, pair of javelins, and £63, bronze spearhead. Near were £60, 62, bronze pin fragments, £71, iron axe. A MG oinochoe, 103, in the NW corner, 0.20 away, was almost certainly part of the group. A LG/EO hydria, 83, (on top of 101, supra) might have fallen from the LG 31 0.30-0.40 above. The position of the EG olpe 98 under the MG 82 {supra) lends weight to the homogeneity of this apparently comparatively undisturbed MG group, assuming that 114 originally stood beside the group and was displaced to the E during looting. In this case, the odd mixture of pots in the E corner would be unconnected with it. The broken MG pithos 64 lay on its side, base to the NW, close to the back wall. At and partly under its foot were the Naxian MG I skyphos 87, the PGB-EG oinochoe, 76 and the LG large lid, 65, covering the PGB lekythos, 99. Next to 65, beside 64's mouth, lay the Attic MG II skyphos 68, inside which were the two M-LG aryballoi 66, 67. Below 68 was the PGB-EG oinochoe, 104 overlying the LG-EO aryballos 105, whose position casts some doubt on the integrity of what otherwise appeared a coherent MG interment. Beside/under the E side of 64 were the MG lekythos 116, MG olpe 121, M-LG aryballos 130, the glass vessel £86, PGB-EG lid 112, oinochoe in and, stacked, PGB-EG oinochoe 109, MG cup</page><page sequence="279">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - T. 292 26i no and PGB-EG lid 129. £72, knife, was under 64. If the association of M-LG material with this interment is correct, it must have been late in MG. The later pottery near 64 could have reached position after the MG pieces were in place. These include the fine LG lekythos 106, between 116 [supra) and the wall. N was the MG cup 108 covering a LG-EO aryballos 131 and 132, half a Cypriot BoR lekythos. N of 108 were 107, 128, LG-EO aryballoi and 127, that joined 132. These may have been connected with 41 (supra), though it was considerably higher. An EO alabastron 93 was between 64 and 116 (supra)] another, 60, was against the back wall, somewhat above 64. Part of the rim of the LG amphora 117 was at the foot of 64; the rest was not recognized during excavation. It may have been the urn associated with some of the LG pots on or near the floor, but in view of their wide dispersal, and 117's condition, it is unlikely it was in the chamber originally. The largest piece of the broken amphora 57 was parallel to the S wall, its base toward the back wall. Between it and the S wall were: the Naxian MG II skyphos 50, the PGB-EG lids 58, 49 inside it, the Cypriot BoR II lekythos 48 on top; the same, 51, in a PGB-EG lid 52, itself in the E-MG lid 53 on top of the E-MG oinochoe 74; the M-LG oinochoe 59, Between 59 and the wall was the LG-EO jug-aryballos, 73. At and partly under 57's foot was a neat pile of little pots - PGB lekythos 69 within Attic MG II skyphos 70 on top of 71, PGB-EG lid inside PGB kalathos-lid 72. The LG lekythos 89 was in a clear space near the LG oinochoe 90, against the S wall. £61, bone handle, was near 90. 74, E-MG oinochoe, was on the other side of 89; the Cypriot BoR II oinochoe 94's sherds were in the SW corner. The EO aryballos 88 was in the centre of the chamber. In Niche 3 was a pile of O pots - 3, kalathos, 8, cup, 6, 9, skyphoi, 4, mug, 7, lid,beneath which were the O miniature cup, 11, and the EO lekythos, 10, lid, 12, and 13, MO miniature skyphos. Close N, on the edge of the remaining floor, was 5, EO hydria with bull's head protome. E of the vases were bronze fibulae, fi6, 16a, a small bronze spiral, fi6b, and a glass bead, fi*j. The E part was empty. Against the w wall of Niche 4 were the LG oinochoe 23, the O amphoriskos 22, and aryballos, 24. In the centre were the MG jug, 18, the EO cup, 17 and mug, 19. Near these were £31, bronze spectacle fibula, f33a, bronze fibula, £32, 33, glass beads. The beads may have rolled away from £27, to the s, group of yellow glass beads found as though threaded in Pgraduated sizes (cf. dromos fill beads fi5, 19, 21, 34 and £52-53 from 0.30 above the chamber floor, fi7 in Niche 3, perhaps, with £27, once all part of one necklace). Niche 5 was partly hidden behind the 'NE column' of the chamber entrance (supra). It contained the MG pithos 137 and lid 139, a juglet 138 and spouted skyphos, 140. £76, at the back, was a carved column fragment, presumably belonging to the fill above. The fill of Niche 6 was indistinguishable from that of the dromos. Near its roof were the LO jug, 135, cup, 136, and skyphos, 141. On its floor was f79a, iron rod fragment. POTTERY (PLATES 234-50) 1.

Micaceous red clay, thick and heavy. Poorly articulated disc foot. Six grooves at base of neck, nineteen grooves on body. EG: with pithos burial, T. 280. Tomb 294 N (figs. 3, 52; plate 44 c-e) Remaining L. overall: 4.28. Dromos: L. as excavated: 2.80. W. o.75-(estimated) 1.10. Stomion: W. (estimated) 0.80. Depth 0.24. Chamber: (estimated) 1.80. The dromos was narrow, but widened as it approached the stomion. It rose a vertical distance of 0.08 from the stomion to the limit of the excavation, at an angle of 1.50. The N side of the stomion had been destroyed; the s had a square door-jamb. There were no blocking stones. There was a 0.09 step from the stomion to chamber, much of which had been destroyed by the Medical Faculty foundation trench. The remaining chamber wall described a smooth curve, suggesting a circular or oval plan. Round the preserved edge of the chamber was a bench 0.07 high, 0.24 wide. The floor was strewn with very small pebbles. 1.35 from the stomion a side chamber was cut into the S side of the dromos. It was basically oval in plan; it extended a little way into the dromos. Its floor was 0.23 below the dromos floor, the step had a curious tongue of kouskouras in the centre. There had been a blocking wall founded on the side-chamber floor, on the line of the true edge of the dromos] the lowest course was in situ; the rest was represented by a pile of stones in the dromos opposite this point. The N and S niches were almost opposite each other, near the chamber. They were (or had been) rectangular; they were slightly off the tomb's orientation. The N niche was at least 1.00 wide, up to 0.40 deep; its floor was c. 0.70 above the dromos floor. The S niche, which contained a larnax (infra) was c. 1.60 X 0.50, its floor c. 0.85 above the dromos floor; the E and S part of its floor were in situ, but the N half, above the side-chamber, had tilted. The tomb was near the S end of the rather irregular N-S line of chamber tombs (292-287- 285-283-294-306) forming the N-most element in that part of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was ESE-WSW. The chamber had been on the E side of the dromos. The tomb was found when the N-S foundation for the w wall of the N-most central block of the Medical Faculty building complex was cut, destroying most of the chamber, a little of the dromos and half the niche. An HL grave, T. 295, orientated N by E, S by W, had just impinged on the remains of the chamber wall; it was full of G pottery. The dromos fill was hard reddish-brown earth, hallmark of robber activity throughout the cemetery. There were many sherds of the painted terracotta larnax which had been in the side-chamber, burnt bone scraps, the LG goat protome 9, bronze vessel fragment, f*j9 terracotta whorls, beads, fj, 6, 8. The last was among displaced blocking stones. Perhaps all these objects were originally in the side-chamber. Near the N niche was £2, squarish lump of glass. In view of the lack of blocking, the chamber had almost certainly been robbed - much of its contents may have gone into T 295 (supra). In the chamber, on the bench, were 12, Attic MG mug, 11, M-LG juglet (cf. those in the side-chamber, infra), with 10, MG lekythos, on the floor near them. A M-LG miniature coarse jug, 13, and fg, whetstone, were just within the entrance. The N niche was empty except for some egg shells, apparently ancient. The S niche contained 6, remains of a plain larnax. The larnax wall on the dromos side was missing; the others were more or less intact. The E half of its floor, supported by the niche's floor, was</page><page sequence="293">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE T. 294 275 intact. The N part (above the side-chamber) had tilted downwards. The larnax was 1.10 long, c. 0.50 wide. Within 6 were 5, an O coarse pithos, smashed, and within its remains the O pots 1 (cup), 2 (jug), 8 (aryballos) and fi, bronze object, f4, clay bar, £5, bronze earring. N of the E end of 6, at a level where the niche floor might have been expected, were the EO cups, 3, 4. After their removal, 7, LO plastic vase (hybrid siren-bull), appeared. Instead of the expected kouskouras floor of the niche, there was brown earth under and around 7, the upper fill of the side-chamber. NW of 7, the kouskouras (ie. the side-chamber roof) was intact; it was excavated to reach the brown stratum beneath, in which 7 was found. Here were 14 (sherds of a LO pithos), almost directly below 7 with, further S, 13a, LO lid and 15, sherds of a LO dinos, fio, 11, fragments of iron knives, fi2, terracotta animal head, all c. 0.32 above side- chamber floor. The miniature lekane, 22, was the only LO vase on the floor. In the upper fill were cremated bones, uncremated bones which might have been human or animal, a few sheep bones, and a tooth. In the lower side-chamber fill were very few sherds, except small pieces of 63, a painted larnax of different fabric from 6. Near the floor were pieces of unburnt bone. On the floor were two larnax feet in situ at the E end, and, between them, undisturbed, five M-LG juglets, 16-20. Two others, 23, 24, were on the W side. Against the SE wall were 21, LG small feeder, fi6, clay whorl/bead, fi7, collection of pebbles/gaming pieces, fi7a, shell, and 22, supra. Among the remains of the blocking were fi3, 14, clay whorls/beads and fi5, iron fibula fragment. The earth throughout the chamber seemed very disturbed. It is suggested that when T. 294 was being constructed, its dromos struck two larnakes, 6 where it was found in 1978, the painted larnax, 63, in the NE niche. The wall of 6 on the dromos side was then removed; it was subsequently used for the interments in the coarse O urns to which the single number 5 was given in the field. When the side-chamber was dug, the SE part of its roof struck the earlier cutting for the larnax so that the N part of the larnax formed part of the side-chamber roof. The cutting for the larnax had been slightly larger than the larnax itself, so that W of the larnax was a gap in the roof through which the top of 7 showed. 3, 4 had perhaps been thrown out of the 5 interment. It is further suggested that the painted larnax was moved by the tomb-builder from the N niche into the side-chamber, where its feet were found. The MG-LG 16-20 between the feet suggest re-use. The larnax would have been smashed by the tomb-robbers (hence its many sherds in the dromos, as well as side-chamber lower fill). The unburnt bones may have come from it, but whether they were original contents or M-LG re-use is unknown. It is difficult to explain how the LO 14, 13a, 15 and 7 got into the upper fill of the side- chamber. 22 on the floor may mean the side-chamber was re-used for this late interment. Perhaps they were removed for investigation, smashed, and then thrown back. Such a reconstruction explains the tomb's history:- (1) Larnax burials parallel to each other (2) T. 294 cut through them. First known, MG, use of the chamber. First known use of side- chamber, M-LG. (3) Larnax 6, used as niche for O interment (4) Side-chamber re-used for LO interment, including 7 (5) HL T. 295 cuts chamber (6) Tomb robbed (7) J97^ destruction of chamber That this is very much a minimum statement is shown by the restoration of twelve urns</page><page sequence="294">2yß KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY from fragments collected during excavation: three MG, five LG, one EO, one MO, one LO. Some of the smaller pots are as early as PGB. There is no evidence that a larnax ever stood in the N niche; there is no evidence to show how this niche was used. Editor's note: The features reported above are open to more than one explanation. There are numerous instances in the N cemetery of the re-use of antique terracotta larnakes, almost invariably in niches or side-chambers. In T. 294, two larnakes were so re-used, one in the S niche, one in the side chamber. The latter was probably earlier than the former. The S niche with its larnax was used for a LO interment based around the two coarse pithoi 5 (supra). The juxtaposition of niche and side-chamber is ambivalent, but that the s niche was made later than the side-chamber is as likely as the reverse, as is the hypothesis that 7, etc. fell through a hole connecting the two as that they were pushed up from below.

Extant dromos: L. 1.70. W. 0.90-1.00. Stomion: 0.74 wide, 0.28 deep. Chamber: 2.00 X 1.80. Only part of the dromos was excavated. What remains widened slightly towards the stomion. The dromos floor rose c. 0.02 in vertical distance at an angle of c. i°. The dromos and chamber floors were separated by a clearly cut ridge of earth 0.05 higher than the dromos floor, from a point 0.20 outside the neatly cut door-jambs to the edge of the chamber, whose floor was 0.18 below the ridge. A large, irregularly shaped limestone block (0.50 X 0.45, 0.12 thick) lay on top of the ridge, and may have been part of the blocking. The chamber was a well cut regular oval in plan; its floor sloped down 0.08 from front to back, at an angle of c. 2.5o. Part of a niche was excavated, cut into the N face of the dromos, 0.45 deep, at least 1.15 wide, its floor c. 0.94 above the dromos floor, c. 0.50 high. The tomb was at the S end of the rather irregular N- S line of chamber tombs (292-287-285-283-294-306) forming the N-most element in that part of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The orientation was ESE-WNW. The chamber was on the E side of the dromos. The dromos and niche were hit by a bulldozer clearing a temporary road, at this point attempting to grub out a tree root. As well as the tree disturbance, a Turkish or relatively modern structure had been built across the dromos, c. 1.70 from the chamber. The HL Ts. 307, 308 had been cut at right angles to its dromos, one either side of the stomion. Their floors were considerably higher than the dromos floor, and they may not have done much harm. The tomb had been looted.</page><page sequence="298">28o KNOSSOS THE NORTH CEMETERY Most of the tomb's pottery was in the dromos, next to the niche, just above and at the level of its floor, where a mass of sherds and the LG-EO aryballos i, the O lekythoi, 2, 4, the PGB oinochoe 3, and half a terracotta whorl, fi, were found. Under the pottery were fallen stones, perhaps from the niche-blocking; among and below them were sherds, a few bronze flakes, one or two chips of burnt bone, £2, half a terracotta whorl, f3, iron strip fragment, Í4, bronze sheet fragments, the last under the stone on the stomion ridge. The lower layer of sherds seems to have been pots removed from the chamber and smashed. Among them must have been a very large coarse pithos, other pieces of which were in the chamber, from the entrance to the centre. Near the entrance, N of these pieces, were £7, iron axe and fragments of wooden haft, and 12, miniature lekane. The O pithos 10, was among the coarse pithos sherds. At the back of the chamber were remains of five LG urns. 7 was against the wall opposite the entrance; SW was 8, then 13, 9, 24. With 7 was the LG lekythos, 11; just SW was fu, bronze object, fg, terracotta whorl, was beneath 8; f8, iron javelin, was in, or below, g. g and 24 were broken and partly mixed; below them was the LG-EO lid 15, and the M-LG tripod skyphos, 18. NE was fig, bronze spectacle fibula fragments; S was fi4, bronze fragments. WSW of 13, near the wall, was the LG lekythos, 19. Near the entrance, under the coarse fragments, was the EO aryballos, 20. 13 was between 8 and the chamber wall. In the N of the chamber, against the wall, was a small platform or bench, c. 0.50 long, 0.20 wide, 0.03-0.04 high. Its top was greasy and black, as though burnt. The earth of which it was made was also dark. By its SE corner were remains of a MG pithos, 14. Under the bench was f2i, bronze sheet fragments. Among 14 was a fragment of an iron javelin, £20. Between 14 and the bench was fis- Scattered W of 14 were G cups, 16-17, 21-23 and fi2, iron dirk fragment, fi3, javelin head fragment, fi6, dirk or sword fragment, fi7, bronze and iron fragments. £17 was below 7; the other cups and weapons were just SW, but all slightly lower, and perhaps therefore more likely to have belonged to 14. There were very many scraps of burnt bone in the tomb fill. The dromos niche was bare. POTTERY (PLATES 257-60) 1. ARYBALLOS. PH. 9.5. Body with part of strap handle. Trace of polishing. Flat base.

Tomb 310 SE This feature was identified as a pyre, perhaps to be associated with T 219. L. (N-s): 2.45. W. (E-w): 1.68. The pyre consisted of a Pi-shaped cutting with rectangular corners to NW and SW, straight N, W, and S sides. It may have been open to the E. The pyre was 1.00 N of the S side of the mortuary church's colonnade, and thus very close N of the dromos of T 219. The latter was the N-most of the irregular N-S line of tombs 219-14-13-19-55 - on the SE side of the area of the cemetery excavated in 1978. The pyre was first located and briefly investigated, but not fully understood, in 1978, when</page><page sequence="301">THE MEDICAL FACULTY SITE - Ts. 306, 310 283 its NW corner was clipped by a Medical Faculty building foundation trench. A larger portion of its SW corner was removed by a NW-SE foundation trench in 1979, and the remains partly excavated. The 1978 excavation was made from the trench side; it showed several burnt layers in the narrow exposed section, and produced a faience bead. The 1979 work found a rich reddish- brown topsoil which produced EC h and HL material including a large HL flask and lamp fragments. Below this were at least two superimposed layers of burning separated by c. 0.20 of fine, sterile yellow earth, slightly ash-contaminated. A section cut NE-SW across the feature showed the ash layers to be thickest near the W wall, tapering upwards from there towards the E, as though the cremations had taken place in a hollow beside the wall. The upper pyre was c. 2.00 long, stopping short of the SW corner, and a greatest width of 0.90. It was 0.42 deep, and the burning had been intense. The nature of the fuel, thick twigs and small branches up to 0.05 in diameter could be seen; they disintegrated upon touch, except one pieces (Sample 1). fi, bronze flakes, £2, 3, faience disc beads, came from this pyre. The lower pyre (0.22 thick) showed a slight division in the section, and may represent two cremations. It was a little narrower than the upper pyre. It was not completely excavated; its length is unknown. In it were £4, rim fragment of a bronze vessel, £6, piece of bronze, £5, many faience beads, and some burnt cereal grain (Samples 3 and 4). Sherds found were burnt. Some may have belonged to T.219.71, 80, and perhaps 31. Apart from the pyres, CT.' 310 was filled with hard, fine sterile, yellow kouskouras-type earth, which also underlay the pyres at 1.90 below modern ground surface. This level was excavated for some centimetres without finding other pyres; stereo was not reached. SMALL FINDS 1. BRONZE FLAKES. 2. FAIENCE DISC BEADS. D. 1.0-0.8. W. 0.2. Dh. 0.3. 3.

Several groups here have already been published.14 Traces of more appeared in 1963 when a new water pipe was laid E-w at the edge of an olive grove on the W side of the modern road, opposite the main entrance to the Venizeleion hospital (FIG. 55). The positions of seven possible tombs were then plotted and much pottery was collected from the pipe trench, including pieces of G cremation urns. With permission of the Greek Archaeological Service and encouragement from Dr. (now Professor) S. Alexiou, a brief excavation was carried out here in September 1967.15 The owner of the olive grove, Mr. I. K. Davelis, gave his consent on condition that no damage was done to olive roots. Operations were thus confined to a narrow strip of land c. 45m long and nowhere more than 6m wide, on either side of the water pipe between the olive trees to the S and the vineyard fence to the N.16 Only a brief description is required for the ten tombs discovered in this excavation. All had been thoroughly looted, some (e.g. nos. 10, 11) apparently in recent times. Nowhere was any deposit found in situ on a tomb floor, to justify the need for detailed plans. Very few whole pots were found, but the catalogue also includes a selection of sherds from each tomb, to establish its period of use. THE TOMBS F/67 Tomb 1 (fig. 55) No dimensions of component parts available. 1.40 below surface a kouskouras scarp may have indicated the wall of a chamber whose floor was found at 2.10 below surface immediately S of the pipe trench. The tomb was between 16.50 and 19.00 beyond the E limit of FIG. 55, where an area 2.50 was opened S of the pipe trench. The vineyard fence prevented exploration to the N. 0.60 above the floor, not in situ, and accompanied by pieces of Late Archaic stamped pithoi, was a small deposit - lid, 9; PC kotyle, 10; skyphos, 12; iron sword fragment, f2. Other catalogued pieces were in the upper fill, which included HL and R pottery. With the floor level were only two scraps of bone and a very few PG-O sherds. 14 KS2 nos. 52 and 56 with refs. ■5 Directed by J. N. Coldstream and G. L. Huxley.

The base of a substantial blocking wall was built across the sloping dromos floor 1.00 SE of the stomion, leaving a gap at the N side of the dromos through which the chamber could have been robbed. Three blocks, all worked, and perhaps reused, were on the dromos floor. Resting on them and leaning inwards was a slab 1.00 X 0.60 X 0.10, with a rubble stone each side of it. From there the dromos sloped gently to the stomion where a 0.40 step led down to the approximately rectangular chamber, its corners rounded. There was a buttress of unquarried kouskouras exactly in the centre of the back wall. The tomb was immediately W of T. 4, orientated SE-NW, the chamber on the N side of the dromos. The tomb had been found in 1963 when the pipe trench had crossed diagonally athwart dromos, stomion and chamber. In 1967 excavation to the N of the pipe trench (work on the S was barred by an electricity pole) uncovered the chamber and part of the dromos. An overall surface stratum, 1.20 deep, contained LR combed ware and many urn sherds, including a non-joining piece of T 4.5. Pieces of the SM 1, 2 {infra) were in a deposit resting against the outer face of the blocking wall, 0.40 above the dromos floor. There was part of a R tile on the dromos floor between blocking and stomion. In the chamber were two strata overlying the floor (1.80 below modern surface). In the upper fill was LR pottery and urn sherds, including the LG 3, 4. There was no R intrusion in the lower fill, but many urn fragments (pithoi - 6, EO; 8, LG and lid, 9) in the S part. Further N were the SM amphora, 1 and hydria, 2 [supra). No pottery was in situ on the chamber floor; there were bones of a child in the N part, in the area of 1 and 2. POTTERY (PLATE 262) 1.

No other component measurable. Only the chamber was excavated; its shape is not recorded. Stones on the S side of the trial may have come from a blocking wall. The tomb was opposite T 10, 2.00 S of the pipe trench. Its orientation was not recorded, but the chamber must have been on the N side of the unexcavated dromos. The tomb was found in a trial in 1967. The limits of the chamber were established by tunnelling into the N and S sides of the trial. A nearby olive tree prevented a search for the dromos. Though there were sherds of PG and G tomb vessels in the upper fill R tile persisted to 1.70 below modern surface. There were only burnt and unburnt bones and EIA pottery in the lowest stratum, immediately above the floor at 2.10 below modern surface. The SM stirrup jar, 1, was near the S edge of the floor in two pieces. POTTERY (PLATE 262) i. STIRRUP JAR. FIG. 152. H. 13. Parts of body restored. Spike on disc, airhole; low conical foot.

The tomb was 4.00 E of T. 8, and parallel with it. The orientation was SE-NW. The chamber was presumably on the N side of the dromos. The tomb was found in 1967 when the dromos was traced N of the pipe trench, up to the vineyard fence. No attempt was made to find the chamber N of the fence. There were a few scraps of EIA and modern pottery in the loose fill, which appeared to have been turned in recent times.</page><page sequence="309">CHAPTER 4 SPORADIC FINDS POTTERY 1. DOMED LID.
