David Duncombe's Pencilling In is a sombre read, with pain and loss (a son's imprisonment, an elderly parent) tending to smother the poems somewhat; there is genuine suf- fering here, but the sense of pain can shape some of the poems overtly, making for an inevitability in their endings. This is not a new problem - it is hard to be what Scott Fitzgerald called 'an authority on failure' and avoid it, but Duncombe's best work comes when he moves onto unfamiliar vistas. In the title poem, for example, the process of trying to write becomes a way of hinting at losses: I like gripping the pencil tight, turning it every line to catch a sharper edge, deliberate as a child who has just mastered the alphabet or the simple technique of telling a good lie. Here, everything has to be shaded in by the reader, rather than absorbed. The range of his imagery also widens when he tackles unfa- miliar subjects, like this description of faded tattoos in the long(ish) 'Tattooed Lady' : . . .a dark feathered peacock's tail could curtain a lost love's name pale cheeks could be pinked, and drained lips stabbed red again. Without being too genre specific, Hugh Dunkerley is a 'nature' poet. 'Good at the anthropomorphic stuff', I have facetiously scribbled in the margin of Walking to the Fire Tower. Dunkerley is good at show- ing animal 'otherness' (as the jargon would have it); giving human characteristics to nature deliberately heightens this difference, via incongruity. The result is a series of poems that stress the limits of human experience and interaction. The cheerily titled 'Killing Geese- Christmas 1985' shows this well: 'It made a hole in the day/where the bird had been.' Dunkerley's strength is the descriptive phrase: 'the wind's unstructured notations' ('The Tranquillity Maps') or the pic-</page><page sequence="3">1 00 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 2 ture of a marauding swift as 'the black gymnast already gone, /a high circling speck, /a fine scream thinning to nothing' ('Swift Mockery'). The non-nature poems are odd and interesting. 'Mouthpiece' refers to the act of self-expression in a self-lacerating tone: I must punish home, be brutal with my half-hearted brainblood, drag up this unknown, spitting clumsily, give it words, bones and nerves to live by, a luminous body. I fall away like a discarded skin, Still faltering, but spoken for. This is a curious mixture of confidence and doubt; the work as 'unknown, spitting clumsily' is countered by 'Still faltering, but spo- ken for', a more optimistic modern re-write of the end of Hardy's great poem 'The Voice'. If the ground that Dunkerley covers is well- trodden, it is always welcome to see it visited again effectively. Martin Edwards, the blurb informs us, 'was probably the first per- son to read a poem on Radio One' (excluding presumably the innuendo laden greetings-card stuff sent in by listeners). If poetry is the new rock n' roll, then Coconut Heart is the equivalent of the three-minute pop song; very little comes in over ten lines. The emo- tional heart of the volume is a closing sequence concerning the death and birth of children. To me, Edwards is best in intermingling the por- tentous and the mundane, as in 'Night of the Comet' : On the night of the comet around long tables in neutral cities, delegates were making obscene demands in the steady tones of careful translators. At ours my neighbour announced: 'I've always hated niggers myself.' The point is made devastatingly through the mock-heroic tone. Edwards would appear to be very cosmopolitan, from the distances travelled in these poems, and a common theme is the response to 'foreign-ness' of his Englishness. The mix of gravitas and bathos captures the contradic- tions of these differences; Captain Scott and the early century explorers are caught in 'Near the Pole' : 'Imagine them all limbo-dancing, /officers and men into the unexplored', where 'limbo-dancing' has just the right</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 101 weight to convey the emptiness of such futility and bravura. Similarly, a car wash abroad brings out colonial guilt: I wanted to leave him well behind but a fingerprint stayed, just beyond the edge of the wiper's arc, beyond our counterfeit exchange. A watermark. ('Car Wash') The detail, and its admittance of culpability renews the familiarity of the theme, with the 'watermark' pun calling up hundreds of years of capitalism's filthy lucre. There is a large-mindedness in Edwards's work, shown in his examination of his contradictory place in the countries changed utterly by this process of imperialism. ADAM ROUNCE</page></plain_text>
