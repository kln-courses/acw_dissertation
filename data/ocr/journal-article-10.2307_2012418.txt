I INTRODUCTION: TELEOLOGY AS A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM rT HIE tendency to interpret natural phenomena in teleological terms dates back to the very dawn of human thought. Mythology and primitive cosmology are largely an attempt to explain history as a progressive fulfilment of the purposes of the gods. Philosophy and science till recently laid special emphasis on motive and design. The earth was believed to have been created expressly for human habitation. Animals and plants were formed for the sake of min- istering to human needs. The abundance of air and water, the great excess of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen over other less important elements, was believed to have been predetermined on account of their peculiar utility to life, especially the life of man. In biology the adaptation of organs to their functions was too ob- vious not to suggest design and prevision. The periodicity of an- nual plants and the seasonal modifications of certain animals seemed prearranged to harmonize with the length of the solar year. Psychology discovered a pattern for all purposive relations in the voluntary activity of man. In human purpose the result to be at- tained is first pictured in consciousness, and the thinker then pro- ceeds by a series of acts to fulfil his preconceived aim. The past few decades have seen many of the traditional teleolo- gical interpretations of nature vigorously challenged. When cosmic history came to be read in terms of evolutionary progress, the earlier anthropomorphic conceptions of stellar and terrestrial creation were inevitably swept away. More recently, following the acceptance of biological evolution, the older teleological views concerning adapta- tion of living forms to their environment and of structure to func- tion have required drastic revision. Some biologists still cling to the teleological standpoint in inter- preting organic evolution, and are seeking to reformulate the old vitalistic philosophy in modern scientific terms. On the other hand, not a few earnest investigators, men of rigorously scientific ideals, 5</page><page sequence="2">6 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY are striving to banish the concept of purpose from biology alto- gether. They aim to interpret the evolution of species and organs in a strictly mechanistic manner. Among psychologists to-day there is a similar division into voluntarists and psychophysicists. The latter seek to minimize the efficiency of volition and to describe all human acts in terms of psychophysical activity. This would seem, in the last analysis, to involve an interpretation of purpose in physiological terms, as a series of physicochemical changes. These differences in standpoint can scarcely be attributed to carelessness of observation. They depend rather upon certain un- derlying concepts and modes of thinking which govern the scientist's interpretation of observed facts and determine the character of his world-view. Among these fundamental logical notions none is more deep-seated and persistent than the concept of Purpose. Notwithstanding the vigorous controversy that has recently waged between vitalists and mechanists, and the forceful argu- ments put forward in behalf of teleology and against it, neither side has so far given an adequate account of the nature of purpose itself. A thorough examination of its fundamental character might reveal a middle ground on which the two opposing parties could unite. If we rid teleology of its anthropomorphic accretions, as Hume removed the anthropomorphic notion of "necessity" from causation, there is no reason why the most thoroughgoing mechanist should not accept purposive events as a specific class of natural processes. It is possible, also, that when the scientific untenability of the traditional voluntarism is demonstrated, the vitalist will at- tach more weight to physicochemical processes in biological growth and activity. One obstacle to a thorough understanding of the nature of pur- pose is the present lack of coordination between the various sciences. Biologists for the most part assume an interpretation of human volition drawn from the psychology of a bygone generation. Psy- chologists still lay stress on the unscientific notions of "free will" and "responsibility" bequeathed to us by medieval philosophy. The data derived from cosmology, biology, and psychology have not yet been united into a consistent, scientific interpretation of volun- tary, teleological action. A thoroughgoing analysis of purpose is one of the prime needs of empirical science to-day. Every branch of natural science re- quires a clarification of this notion. The newer conceptions of change and growth induced by the evolution theory make it essen- tial to determine what scientific meaning shall be attached to the phenomenon of "anticipation" and the judgment of "fitness."</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 7 Psychologists and biologists alike are vitally concerned in the solu- tion of the teleological problem. Genetically, the notion of purpose arose from a certain definite type of human experience. The typical purposive experience con- sists in a thought of some future occurrence followed by a series of actions which culminate in the very situation which the original idea represented. Thus we have a temporal sequence beginning with an idea and ending with the perception of a situation or event corresponding to that idea. Whether or not the "idea" produces the "physical situation" in a causal manner, at least the temporal succession is a matter of common observation, and this order is the reverse of the usual sensation-memory sequence. It is experiences of this type that have given rise to our general notion of purpose, teleology, volition, means to end, adaptiveness. On historical grounds, therefore, it seems fitting to begin the study of purpose with an analysis of purposive consciousness. Whatever the scien- tific interpretation of the phenomena may be, the occurrence of conscious "forethought" and its subsequent "fulfilment" through human acts is not open to question. The biological problem of purpose is closely related to the psy- chological problem. Biologists find that certain responses are made to situations which do not develop fully till after the reaction is actually begun. In other words, a reaction may in a measure an- ticipate the situation to which it is a response. But apart from "conscious anticipations" such reactions are based upon organic structure which has slowly evolved in the species and developed in the individual. The biological problem of teleology, then, is to account if possible for the phylogenetic and ontogenetic rise of an- ticipatory reactions, and to determine their scientific significance. A further problem is concerned with the trend of cosmic and terrestrial evolution. The history of the stellar universe and of the earth itself may or may not admit of a teleological interpreta- tion. In the past it has generally been assumed that the universe was definitely planned from the beginning and that it is working toward a certain foreordained goal. What attitude shall science take toward this deep-rooted hypothesis? Can modern research throw any new light on the trend of cosmic history? Whether or not a scientific investigation of the problem will lead to a definite solution, at least it opens up a legitimate field for scientific study. Science to-day stands face to face with the problem: What is the place of "purpose" in the universe as a whole? Three distinct lines of scientific inquiry, then, are indicated: (1) The psychological analysis of purpose.-What are the distinc- tive features of purposive states of consciousness? (2) The biolo-</page><page sequence="4">8 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY gical history and meaning Of purpose.-How did purposive be- havior originate and develop in organisms? Does this type of ac- tivity harmonize with the physicochemical interpretation of vital phenomena? (3) The role of purpose in the universe.-Is there scientific evidence of a teleological sequence in the inorganic world? Shall the scientific thinker adopt a thoroughgoing mechanistic stand- point as his working hypothesis in interpreting the cosmos? Or, shall he assume the existence of an underlying entelechy, which di- rects the course of cosmic evolution? PART I. THm PURPOSIVE CONSCIOUSNESS A human act is said to be purposive when it is preceded by an idea representing the situation which the act itself brings about. The antecedent idea is termed the purpose or forethought, and the resulting situation is called the end or fulfilment. The whole se- quence from idea to fulfilment constitutes purposive activity. The peculiarity of purposive activity (as experience) is that the repre- sentation of the situation precedes the presentation, while in ordi- nary experience the representation of a situation follows the presen- tation. In analyzing the consciousness of purpose it is customary to select acts which involve a considerable amount of preliminary de- liberation. But many simple acts which are performed without deliberation contain the essential features of purpose and are quite as typical. The analysis is made easier if we select these simpler acts for study. For example, I am reading and it grows dark. I think of turn- ing on the electric light, and without hesitation the action is per- formed. The act here described is just as purposive as if I had deliberated and planned out every step in the procedure beforehand. In psychophysical terms, the experience involves a thought repre- senting a future situation, followed at once by the appropriate reac- tion. The characteristic of a conscious experience which distin- guishes it as purposive, is that the antecedent thought shall picture or symbolize a situation which subsequent muscular activity brings about. In psychological terms, the mental picture of the act pre- cedes the perception of the act as an actual occurrence. Whether the thought itself is to be regarded as the cause or starting-point of the chain of physiological events will be considered later. Purposive consciousness is observed directly only through per- sonal experience. But its presence in another individual, like the presence of mental data generally, may be inferred from the charac- ter of his reaction or from his verbal report. The psychological</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 9 study of purpose is therefore not limited to subjective investiga- tion. Upon examining the purposive consciousness we observe a num- ber of factors, some of which enter into all purposive experiences, while others occur only in special cases. 1. Every purposive experience begins with an idea of some future situation. This idea is the fundamental factor in every pur- posive experience. It may be termed the forethought. A fore- thought is the starting-point of a series of events which usually cul- minate in a perception corresponding to the forethought. The pur- posive character of the experience, however, is usually recognizable before the series is completed. 2. Another characteristic factor which appears at the beginning of the purposive experience is variously known as decision, wish, or assent. Assent distinguishes a purposive series from a sequence in which the idea is fortuitously fulfilled. An idea may chance to be followed later on by a sensory situation corresponding to it without there being any significant relation between the two. Day-dreams sometimes come true. A forethought is not purposive unless accom- panied by a consciousness of assent, either as a separate associated experience or as a feeling-tone of the forethought. 3. A feeling of potency is commonly associated with the fore- thought. There is a strong tendency to believe that the forethought itself has power to produce the result foreseen. 4. A further characteristic of purposive events is that the in- dividual himself is directly concerned in the outcome. One's pur- poses are not fulfilled by another. The consciousness of self may or may not be explicitly associated with the forethought; but the self is always implicitly involved in purpose. 5. During the progress of purposive activity there frequently appears a thought or feeling that certain thoughts or perceptions are suitable or fit. In contrast with this a feeling of unfitness is associated with other elements in the experience. The fulfilment itself is marked by a feeling-tone of fitness if the experience is in the focus of attention. The mental states which intervene between forethought and ful- filment may or may not include experiences of a purposive character. I think of turning on the light and proceed forthwith to perform the act without further thought of ways and means. This is typical of habitual actions. Here the intermediate phases of consciousness are not purposive. I perceive the changed positions of objects as I rise and move across the room. But these perceptions in no way tally with my forethought; they are no more purposive than the</page><page sequence="6">10 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY set of experiences which I have when some one else comes in and walks over to the switch. Where the act is novel or complex, experiences of a purposive character frequently occur during its progress. For example, many years ago I thought of making a life-work of psychology. Mean- while many thoughts have arisen representing certain phases of this work. These intervening experiences are purposive. They are forethoughts of which my professional goal is the fulfilment. The consciousness of purpose may be greatly syncopated. In simple, habitual acts, as we have seen, it consists merely of a fore- thought tinged with assent. Even where the act is very complex the accompanying experiences, however varied they may be, include no purpose factors other than the five already mentioned. Let us examine these characteristic factors in detail. 1. Forethought.-The forethought may be simple or complex. It may be either an image or a symbolic thought. For example, when I propose to turn on the light, the forethought may consist of a kinesthetic image of rising, an auditory image of my footfalls, a visual image of the electric switch, a tactile-kinesthetic image of turning the switch, a visual image of the flood of light, etc. Any one of these images may be present alone, or several of them together. On the other hand, the act of lighting may not be preceded by any image corresponding to the future sensory experience. Instead there may be a verbal experience of one type or another; I may have either an auditory or a vocal representation of the word "light." Here there is no resemblance between the forethought and the per- ceptions which accompany the fulfilment. But the two experiences correspond through the arbitrary symbolic association between word and image. To think of lighting in symbolic verbal terms is quite as purposive as to think of the result in terms of imagery.' The precise sensory character of the idea or image constituting the forethought is of no moment in this analysis. It varies with the individual, but these variations do not affect the character of the purpose-consciousness. The distinguishing mark of the forethought is its reference to some future situation. Regarded from the psychophysical standpoint, in purposive events an image or idea is the stimulus which produces the corre- sponding physical situation, whereas in ordinary events a physical situation is the stimulus which arouses the corresponding mental state. From a purely psychological standpoint, the image precedes 1 In order to avoid the problem of imageless thought, which is irrelevant to the present discussion, we may confine the term image to images which resemble the sense-perception of a situation, and use the term idea to denote symbolie verbal experience. The vaguer term thought will cover both image and idea.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 11 the sensation in purpose-experiences, while in ordinary experiences the sensation precedes the image. In other words, the usual tem- poral order of certain events is reversed. The photographic picture of a physical situation endures after the situation has passed away; the record of an event remains after the event has been completed. Neither the photograph nor the record anticipates its prototype. But in purposive phenomena the mental picture or record antici- pates the primary consciousness which it represents. Anticipation is the fundamental characteristic of the purposive experience, just as it is the distinctive feature of objective teleological events. In the analysis of purpose an attempt is frequently made to dis- tinguish between the final result and the means which produce this end. On the psychological side such a distinction does not appear justified. The idea of the means is a purposive thought of substan- tially the same sort as the idea of the outcome. I may think of ris- ing and of turning on the light. Each of these ideas is a fore- thought. I may think of the entire sequence of events beginning with rising, then walking across the floor, and finally turning the switch. Each member in the series is a forethought which is ful- filled in turn. The final outcome is distinguished only as being the last term in the series which is perceptualized. Sometimes the original end is transformed into a means for some ulterior end; or again, the means may come to be regarded as an end in itself. In the example given I may think of rising from my chair because I have finished reading, and without thinking as yet of any further action. Thus far the thought of rising is the end. But before starting to rise I may think of turning on the light. The act of rising then becomes a means and the act of turning on the light becomes a new end. Or, having thought of rising and turning on the light, I may rise and then continue pacing to and fro without completing the act. Here the means has become the end. Ordinarily we think first of the end, then of the means. In the example given, the first thought was to continue reading in spite of the gathering darkness. The next thought was to turn on the light. Last of all came the thought of getting up from the chair as a precursory step to the act of lighting. There is nothing especially unique about the end-thought or final purpose, as distinct from the idea of the means. Events continue to succeed one another indefinitely. The final result is not like the end of a chalk-line which is essentially different from all other points on the line. It is merely the furthest point that is considered in the series. In the given instance I may not at the time have a definite thought of any end beyond the act of continuing to read. But be- fore I started to read this particular book I had thought of acquir-</page><page sequence="8">12 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ing information on psychology; and many years before that I had definitely determined to pursue psychological study as an aim in life. Thus, taking into account not merely my mental state at the time when I think of turning on the light, but my whole mental history so far as relevant to the act, we discover certain experiences which may be considered as both means and end. The thought of reading the book is not merely an end, but a means to a broader outlook on life. Some forethoughts are never completely fulfilled. We have ideals which constantly attain partial fulfilment through our ac- tions; but since they do not represent specific acts, we experience time and again new situations to which they correspond. The con- ception of one's life-career is perhaps the best instance of a general purpose. An ideal is analogous to the general notion. But unlike the ordinary general notion it is not the outgrowth of a number of particular experiences which have gone before; an ideal arises before the particulars to which it corresponds. In the general purpose, as in the specific purpose, the usual time order is reversed: we par- ticularize a general experience, instead of generalizing particular experiences. The essential feature of the purposive consciousness, then, is the prevision or forethought of certain future events. We may picture the whole progress of events in rather minute details; or we may merely pick out one or more salient parts of the series to image or symbolize. The latter is more usual. In either case the distinguish- ing mark of the forethought is its "future reference." This is analogous to the "past-reference" which characterizes the memory image. 2. Assent.-Not every thought of the future is purposive. An additional factor, accompanying the purposive forethought, serves to distinguish it from mere imagination of the future. When I think of performing some act, such as turning on the light, my thought is sometimes followed by the act itself or by the beginning of a series of actions culminating in the result foreseen. In other cases the act is not initiated, although much the same thought is present. The fulfilment may be merely delayed, as when I think of reading Condillac, but take no steps at present to do so. Or the thought may occur without the slightest intention of putting the act into realization. For example, one may picture himself ascending the Matterhorn, and yet have no desire whatever to per- form the feat. Where the fulfilment is merely delayed, the fore- thought is still purposive; where there is no intention of actually accomplishing the result, the purposive character of the experience is lacking.</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 13 The differential mark is a certain conscious datum added to the forethought. It is a consciousness of intention, decision, or volition, -of wish, desire, or assent. This distinguishing factor occurs in many different forms and degrees. Usually it is not a separate ex- perience, but rather a modification of the forethought. The mental attitude in portraying the coming act is not wholly intellectual. It is distinctly affective, like the consciousness of "need."2 The nature of assent is observed by comparing a purposive idea with a mere imagination. Contrast the thought of perusing this paper with the thought of a journey to Mars. Each is an idea which refers to some future activity. But our attitude in the two cases is quite different. In the former experience there is a feeling of "actually fulfilling the idea," which is lacking in the latter. This affective datum distinguishes a purposive forethought from a non-purposive imagination of future happenings. In purposive ex- periences an affective element of this sort is observable even where there is no separate idea of decision. If we analyze the assent factor we find that it consists of kin- esthetic and organic data. When we think of an act in a purposive way there is an incipient tension of the muscles concerned in the movement, and of the finer muscles which produce an adjustment of attention. This is often accompanied by modifications of breathing and circulation. The sensory impulses set up by these kinesthetic and organic adjustments are usually too weak to arouse definite sensations; but they combine to produce an indefinite conscious at- titude. This datum is the assent. Assent to a future experience corresponds very closely to recog- nition of a past experience. The recognition element in an image is traceable to changes in adjustment brought about by repetition and facilitation; the sensory impulses which these changes arouse do not produce separate sensations, but form the recognition factor in memory. The origin of assent is analogous to this; in each case the datum is partly affective, partly ideational. Some psychologists assume that, in addition to assent, another factor immediately precedes the initiation of activity. This is known as the fiat. I do not observe any such factor, distinct from assent, in my own experience. The thought of turning on the light is followed immediately by rising, walking, etc. Nothing else is ex- 2 The term assent seems to express the meaning of the experience most nearly. It implies an affective consciousness, with or without a separate idea of initiating the action. Wish and desire emphasize the affective side overmuch, while intention lays too great stress on the idea. Decision and volition are used to designate complex purposes which involve reflection and delayed fulfilment; they imply certain dynamic experiences not found in simple purposive conscious- ness. I therefore prefer the term assent.</page><page sequence="10">14 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY perienced meanwhile but the assent. In cases of complex and de- layed purposes the assent factor is intensified and becomes more fully separated from the forethought. "I will write this paper." "I will begin it now." Whereupon my hand slips over to my pocket and I take out my pen. There is no intervening fiat consciousness. What distinguishes delayed fulfilment from immediate action? It is certainly not the degree of desire, for we find all degrees of de- sire present in each case. There is a minimum degree of desire asso- ciated both with turning on the light and with reading Condillac. The former is performed; the latter is not. There is a high degree of desire associated with writing this paper, which I am proceeding to do; and there has been for years a high degree of desire associated with making a trip to Japan, which I have taken no steps whatever to accomplish. The function of desire is only to increase the in- tensity of the forethought and thus render its accomplishment more probable. Nor is the delayed execution due to absence of assent. An act whose fulfilment is postponed may be assented to quite definitely. I assent to the thought of reading Condillac in the same way that I assent to turning on the light, although in the one case I have not proceeded to the fulfilment of the thought these many years, while in the other case the fulfilment is accomplished immediately. Whether or not the act follows immediately upon the assent de- pends on psychophysical conditions. The beginning of the act may be delayed by an inappropriate situation, by unforeseen hindrances, or by a long succession of thoughts while we plan how to act. When at length the act does begin it is not preceded by a new sort of factor. There is no magical fiat to squeeze the muscles or start a current down the motor nerves. The assent factor is the only differentia between purpose and sheer imagination. So far we have considered chiefly the purposes which find their fulfilment in objective situations and expressions of behavior. But certain purposes are concerned primarily with ideational states. I endeavor to think of the name of a former student. I propose to solve a problem in chess, to find the answer of a mathematical prob- lem, to arrange a schedule of hours, to perfect a laboratory device, etc. In such cases the solution, the fulfilment of the purpose, is a thought rather than an act. I do not propose to empty two real hogsheads by pipes of dif- ferent diameters, but only to obtain an idea of the result. I may or may not repeat the chess moves on a real board; but if I do play them out, my original purpose has already been fulfilled; I am now endeavoring to verify my solution, and this is altogether another purpose. I perfect my laboratory device in thought and then con.</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 15 struct the machine; here there were two purposes in mind-one ideational, the other having an objective sensory fulfilment. In ideational purpose the forethought does not exactly represent the outcome. I do not think of the student's name in the fore- thought of recalling it. The outcome is something more specific than the forethought. The forethought is a problem; the fulfilment is its solution. The intervening process frequently involves long- continued "hard thinking." So long as this thought-series does not serve to fulfil the purpose, the forethought remains focal; I am con- tinually aware of my purpose to solve the problem. The assent element usually appears later in subjective purposes than in motor acts. The formulation of the problem seems to entail one or more attempts at solution even before we decide to solve it. It is sometimes difficult at the start to distinguish between a train of fancy and a purposive thought-train. Apart from this delay in appearance there seems to be no essen- tial difference between the assent factor in thought problems and pur- posive behavior. The two manifest the same characteristics as re- gards attention. Where the purpose to be attained is something habitual, the assent becomes marginal whether the fulfilment be a thought or an act. The problem of determining the value of 2 + 3 is solved as quickly as the problem of rising, and the assent in both cases is marginal. On the other hand where the purpose is novel, and especially where it is fulfilled through trial and error, the assent is apt to remain in the focus of consciousness throughout the process. In fleeing from a mad dog, the thought of escape is vividly present during all my movements and is attended by a strong degree of as- sent, just as the thought of solving a chess problem remains focally present throughout the ensuing train of thought. One series is accompanied by muscular contractions and kinesthetic sensations, the other by cerebral activity and thought processes. The sensory basis of the assent consciousness is different in the two cases, but I find no distinction between the two types of assent so far as their relation to fulfilment is concerned. The psychological analysis of purpose has been seriously ham- pered by the complicated examples that are usually chosen for exam- ination. In an intricate, complex purpose, such as determining one's attitude toward a moral issue, there is apt to be a long succes- sion of thoughts, known as deliberation, and the assent which marks the final passage from central activity to muscular activity is often an epoch-making affair involving considerable readjustment of one's entire attitude toward life. Such crucial experiences are dignified with the name of decision or volition. I do not find in my own case that the purposive character of these complex experiences is</page><page sequence="12">16 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY different from that of simple purposes such as turning on the light. Simple purposive experiences occur hundreds of times in every-day life, while these complicated instances are rare. It is true the latter involve more intense consciousness, and the assent feature is sep- arated out into a distinct and vivid experience. But the assent ele- ment is the same; it is merely magnified. Volition has proved a serious stumbling-block in psychological analysis. The vague connotation of this term has too often led to mystical interpretations of mental phenomena. The notion of as- sent derived from simple types of purpose is less open to objection. It is readily freed from anthropomorphic exerescences. There ap- pear to be no difficulties in the way of applying it to the most com- plex purposive experiences. The usual connotation of assent em. braces the essential characters of "decision" as a psychological datum. On the other hand it does not include the dynamic factor, the feeling of potency in the forethought, which analysis shows to be a distinct element in the purposive experience. The failure to distinguish "assent" from the "feeling of potency" is largely re- sponsible for the unscientific character of the traditional theory of volition. The importance of this distinction will appear when we examine the third factor in purposive consciousness. 3. Potency-feeling.-In complex purposes which involve delib- eration, a certain dynamic feeling accompanies the assent. We feel that conscious volition initiates the activity itself-that the decision innervates the muscles. A generation ago certain states of consciousness were termed "innervation-feelings"; they seemed to demonstrate the power of thought to bring about an action which is conceived and desired. More recently these so-called innervation feelings have been traced to incoming excitations from the muscles. They prove to be kin- esthetic sensations due (a) to the state of the muscles prior to action, or (b) to changes in muscular tension during the activity itself; or (c) to memory images of such kinesthetic sensations. That these dynamic experiences are really of peripheral origin, that they are the result and not the antecedent of muscular activity, was demon- strated most convincingly by Professor Munsterberg in his " Willens- handlung. " Psychophysical investigation and introspective anal- ysis both lead to this conclusion. These dynamic experiences are closely related to the assent atti- tude. In motor activity the assent attitude is found to be an in- cipient kinesthetic sensation which is aroused when our muscles begin to be tense for the movement. When thought is succeeded by actual movement, this kinesthetic sensation becomes stronger. It appears as a sensation of power or force. A corresponding sense</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 17 of power is associated with the forethought even before the motor activity begins. This is found to be a memory image of former kin- esthetic sensations, which is aroused by association when the mus- cular activity is represented. Observation of the experience indi- cates that the data are the same at every stage. In other words, the feeling of potency or efficiency in volition is really a kinesthetic sen- sation or memory. Its presence does not guarantee that the motor consciousness is really efficient-that the thought of an action actu- ally has power to call forth the corresponding action. According to the ideomotor theory of action a motor idea tends to produce the corresponding act; it has an inherent power to select the appropriate activity from among all other possible modes. Pro- fessor Thorndike in his presidential address before the American Psychological Association3 argues forcefully against this view. There is no more reason, he maintains, that a mental image should be followed by an action which resembles it, than that the thought of an earthquake should be followed by an earthquake. His strictures apply to all purposive acts. There is no inherent reason why the thought of rising should be followed by the act of rising, or the thought of taking out a pen by that action itself. Nevertheless, it is a matter of observation that the thought of a specific act is fre- quently followed by the performance of the corresponding act. The sequence of a thought and the corresponding perception constitutes the fulfilment of purpose. How has this tendency toward fulfilment come to be, if not through some selective power in the forethought? Speaking in psychophysical terms, by that means does the thought of a situation tend to start physiological processes which lead to the actual production of that situation? Professor Thorndike explains this tendency solely on the ground of utility. A thought tends to be followed by the act which it resembles because such a sequence has proved biologically useful. The genesis of purposive behavior will be considered more fully in the second part of this paper. Our present analysis is concerned with the conscious accompaniments of purposive behavior. Here the problem appears in a slightly different form: How comes it that the purposive thought tends to be followed by the perception of its fulfilment, rather than by any one of a thousand other dissimilar perceptions? I believe that Professor Thorndike's answer applies equally well to this aspect of the problem. Mental association is based upon frequency and intensity. The associations between a forethought and the corresponding motor perception are strengthened through repetition and through the in- terest which attaches to them. If a sensation of seeing or smelling 3 " Ideomotor Action," Psychol. Review, March, 1913.</page><page sequence="14">18 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY food happens to be succeeded by a series of kinesthetic sensations, followed by a pleasant taste, the next time a similar visual or ol- factory sensation occurs it will tend to the same motor expression, and at the same time it will tend to recall the kinesthetic memories and the pleasant gustatory memory of the former experience. By repetition, then, not only is the association between the food-percep- tion and the food-getting act (with kinesthetic accompaniment) strengthened, but an association is built up between the food-getting thought (gustatory and kinesthetic memories) and the food-getting act, which is pleasurable; and each repetition serves to strengthen this association. That the original association is not due to any ideomotor potency is shown by our inability to produce a sneeze, however vividly we recall its motor sensations. That a motor asso- ciation requires some "cue" is shown by the fact that in certain in- dividuals the thought of moving the ears may be followed by the act (and its perception), while in most persons this thought, however vivid, never leads to fulfilment. The examples cited by Professor Thorndike seem to refute con- clusively the view that the forethought possesses an autonomic selec- tive power over kinesthetic experiences. If the thought of an action leads to the production of that particular action with all its kines- thetic sensory accompaniments, rather than to any one of the thousands of other kinesthetic experiences, the reason is that a defi- nite association has been already formed between this particular thought and this particular motor impulse. The origin and growth of such an association may be attributed to chance concurrence, fre- quent repetition, and value; it is not due to some mysterious and magical potency residing in the thought. The thought of a mus- cular action has no more power per se to produce the corresponding kinesthetic sensations than the thought of an earthquake has power to produce the sensation of an earthquake. A conscious purpose, as we have seen, may consist in the formula- tion of a problem which is to be solved in thought rather than action. Professor Thorndike does not examine this case specifically; but it is quite analogous to the other. Just as in the case of ideomo- tor activity, most of us have a very deep-rooted belief that the thought of solving a problem has a directive power which guides us to its solution. Does the evidence justify this belief? When I propose to recall a forgotten name, I sometimes suc- ceed in recalling it immediately, while at other times I fail com- pletely. In the latter case it frequently happens that if I abandon my purpose definitely after the vain attempt, the name sought for suddenly "comes to consciousness" in some apparently irrelevant connection. A conscious purpose to recall thought, so far from hav-</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 19 ing the power to accomplish the end desired, is often quite powerless to do so; indeed it sometimes seems to have an inhibitory effect. Forethought and afterthought are thus seen to be connected only through ordinary associative processes,-not by some directing po- tency. The result proposed may be attained, or again it may not be fulfilled in spite of our most earnest endeavors. Take a higher type of thought, where the result involves a process of reasoning. Let one endeavor to find the next prime num- ber greater than 47. Here the thinker's training in mathematics leads him to form certain associations. He examines in turn 48, 49, 50, etc. One number after another is discarded as its divisors are discovered, till the right one is reached. Perhaps the operator in- advertently omits one test and reaches the conclusion that 51 ful- fils the conditions. Here the purposive thought has led to a mistaken end. Such erroneous conclusions are by no means rare. Even the experienced mathematician and logician blunder occasionally. The ordinary man finds that time after time he has been satisfied with a conclusion which subsequent tests prove false. It appears then that the associations which follow a rational purpose may or may not lead to the result proposed. Rational thought, like any other thought, is capable of forming only the associations which experience has given. There is no inherent power in the forethought to induce a rational conclusion. Again, take the case of so-called creative thought, or invention. I propose to devise a laboratory apparatus which will record a choice reaction when the subject presses the right key, but will fail to complete the circuit and stop the chronoscope when he presses any one of the three other keys. I think of various ways of wiring the circuits, and find (in thought) several which will work for most combinations; but all these arrangements fail to work for at least one type of false reaction to one of the signals. I put the problem to my assistants and graduate students. We all work with the same end in view. One of the group solves the problem, but finds that in certain cases the clock will record when the sub- ject presses a right and wrong key together. Finally one of the group obtains a complete and satisfactory solution to the problem. In this example has the forethought been effective in producing the result? Obviously not for most of the group engaged in the test. One man did fulful the inventive purpose; but his solution was reached only after a great number of erroneous conceptions, all of which represented combinations of experiences familiar to him. Shall we say that this particular man's forethought was effi- cient while that of the others was not? Shall we not rather at- tribute his success to a greater facility in combining familiar ele-</page><page sequence="16">20 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ments into new complexes? If instead of the given problem he had proposed to himself the problem of squaring a circle, might he not still be engaged in the search for a solution? The only real potency that can be attributed to a purpose- thought is a strong tendency to continue thinking about the problem. To say that a vivid thought has the effect of inducing continued as- sociative thinking, may be a restatement of the traditional laws of association; or it may be mere tautology. The presence of a feeling of potency in any purposive experience does not insure the fulfilment of the purpose. Whatever the char- acter of the forethought, whether it refers to a motor act or to the solution of a mental problem, our belief that it actually has power to produce the result is an anthropomorphic interpretation of a psychological datum. The potency-feeling, like the assent factor, is a kinesthetic sensation or memory. Where the fulfilment is a motor act it may be traced to sensations of tension in the muscles concerned; where the fulfilment is a thought it is traceable to the finer tensions which accompany the attention process. This dynamic feeling attains peculiar strength and vividness in certain instances. In my own case the strongest sense of "volitional potency" which can be experimentally induced is observed when I lie in bed in the morning preparing to get up. The longer I lie the more I feel the effort and the power of my will to overcome the inertia. I tingle all over with the sense of dynamic potency. Yet when I focus the attention here and there, I discover no element but the kines- thetic data; the intense dynamic experience is due to the high degree of muscular tension all over the body as I prepare to spring up. At other times, when I jump out of bed immediately after waking with- out stopping to reflect, no feeling of potency is noted. The fore- thought passes over into action without the slightest dynamic sensa- tion. But in such cases there is no period of muscular tension before the act takes place. Examination of all classes of experiences indicates, then, that the feeling of power in a purposive thought to bring about the situation which it portrays is a datum derived from kinesthetic sensations. This feeling does not attach to every purposive experience, but only to vivid and rather complex forethoughts. It is most noticeable where considerable deliberation precedes the assent. The potency- feeling does not guarantee the actual efficiency of the forethought. A purpose may not be fulfilled in spite of the strongest feeling of potency; and it may be fulfilled equally well when the feeling of potency is altogether lacking.4 4 A word in regard to the implications of this view. It is objected that in denying "potency" (and with it "directive selection") to the forethought we</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 21 4. The Self-Factor.-The thought of an act is not purposive unless the thinker himself is concerned in accomplishing it. When I think of a friend's coming trip to Canada, no matter how detailed the representation, it lacks the character of purpose. I think of the completion of the Cape-to-Cairo railroad as an end to be accomplished; I may desire its completion. If I consider the future of the project merely as an outsider, my thought is not pur- posive. But if I think of some act of my own as concerned in the building of the road (if, for example, I desire to suggest a change of route), then there is a purpose on my part, provided I assent to the thought. We attribute a purposive thought to Cecil Rhodes in the Cape-to-Cairo project on account of the bequest provided in his will, though he died before the purpose was fulfilled. The be- quest is an objective indication of the self-factor. Again, if we endeavor to trace the steps that must be taken in order to complete the railroad, the thought series may involve a sub- jective ideational purpose on our part, like the solution of any mental problem. The purpose here is not to build an actual road in Africa, but to understand how it can be built. In every case the situation to which a purposive forethought refers involves the thinker himself. The fulfilment of one's purpose always includes an act on his part, or an objective situation in which he is concerned, or a subsequent thought of his own. The self-element does not usually appear as a separate factor in the experience. Only in complex cases of deliberation and so-called volition is there an explicit experience of self associated with the reduce consciousness to the role of an epiphenomenon. If purposive thought is not effective in producing mental or muscular activity, of what value is con- sciousness in the universe? Is it anything more than a passive spectator of the physical changes which constitute real activity and form the basis of history? The objection may hold as against the traditional parallelistic world-view, but it loses force if we adopt the double-aspect standpoint. According to this interpretation our thoughts and purposes are only our way of experiencing what an independent observer might perceive as physiological activity. One set of occurrences is as "real" as the other. Neither physicochemical changes nor con- scious activity is due to " compulsion," and in neither case is there indeterminate "selection" or arbitrary "direction." If the only "value" of phenomena were to "initiate" something apart from the orderly sequence of changes, then physical phenomena would seem to be quite as epiphenomenal and useless as mental phenomena; for they too are mere recombinations of preexisting elements. The criticism is really based upon an unscientific conception of natural events. We still incline to interpret nature anthropomorphically. We attribute power to causation and selective potency to purpose. These are distinctly "psychomorphic" interpretations which have no basis in the phenomena them- selves. We shall refer again to this psychomorphic tendency in the second part of the paper.</page><page sequence="18">22 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY forethought. But a self-factor is always implicitly present in pur- pose. The explicit self-factor may be traced to kinesthetic elements which arise during the process of fulfilment. It is something more than the mere fact that the purposive experience is my own. For this is true of every experience, whether purposive or not. I ob- serve the successive motions of a leaf wafted down to the ground; this series of perceptions forms a part of my experience, but they are not purposive. Neither is a train of fancy purposive, though it forms a closely united group of personal experiences. In every purposive act the motor functions of the individual or- ganism play a part. In every purposive consciousness some kin- esthetic data are present between the forethought and its fulfilment. The purposive self is based on these kinesthetic data. In ideational purpose the self-elements are merely successive ad- justments of attention, and are indistinguishable from the assent. In objective purpose, though more intense, they may fail also to appear as separate data, since the attention is usually centered else- where. When I rise and turn the switch my thoughts are focused on my reading, not on my movements. When I write, my thoughts are chiefly on the meaning of the words, not on the muscular con- tractions of my fingers. Yet in every case these kinesthetic elements appear to tinge the experience. This tone value is observed most clearly when we compare purposive with non-purposive experiences. There is a personal tone to the former which is lacking in the latter. The self-datum is the least important factor in the purposive ex- perience. It is less characteristic than the assent, less vivid than the potency-feeling. Still it should not be ignored in the study of purpose, since in some form or other there is always a kinesthetic self-reference in the fulfilment of every purposive thought. 5. Sense of Fitness and Unfitness.-When the purpose is fulfilled a feeling of satisfaction is frequently associated with the perception of the completed situation. This feeling is based upon our recogni- tion of the forethought in the fulfilment-experience. I propose to think of a forgotten name; when I do recall it I am pleased or re- lieved. I propose to find the word "purpose" in the dictionary; when I find it I recognize it with satisfaction as the word I was look- ing for. The feeling-element by itself does not seem to be in any way characteristic of the purposive consciousness; it is the same sort of experience as occurs in the satisfaction of any want or need. Neither is the recognition-element in itself anything different from that which attaches to a memory image. There is, however, a combination of recognition and satisfaction which is peculiar to the fulfilment of a purpose idea. When I meet</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 23 a friend whom I have not thought of for years I may recognize him and be glad to see him; but the attitude is different from that which I experience in meeting a friend whom I have been endeavoring to find for some special reason. In the latter case a peculiar feeling attaches to the fulfilment of the forethought. It attaches not so much to the perception as to the judgment of correspondence be- tween forethought and realization. It is a judgment of relation with an affective tone attached. This judgment, in which the affec- tive element is prominent, may be called the sense of fitness. The absence of fulfilment may in like manner be attended by an opposite feeling, which attaches to the judgment of dissimilarity between the forethought and the actual outcome. This is the sense of unfitness. In simple acts the sense of fitness is seldom present. When I turn on the light I do not experience the feeling at all. But the sense of unfitness is apt to arise if the fulfilment is hindered, even when the act is simple. I turn the switch, but the light does not appear. The lack of correspondence between my forethought of the light and the actual outcome is accompanied by a distinct feeling of dissatisfaction. In this example the act is habitual. I think only of the light and not of my muscular contractions; the kinesthetic sensations of turning the switch follow the forethought, but the visual sensations pictured in the forethought are lacking. The ab- sence of the anticipated visual sensations in the experience is the basis of the judgment. The feeling of unfitness is here associated with a certain portion of the experience, namely, the visual sensa- tions which accompany the kinesthetic data. The tendency of the sense of fitness and unfitness to appear in connection with both fulfilment and intermediate states is more noticeable in complex purposes. When I am in a strange room and think of turning on the light, the forethought is likely to be elab- orated: I think of some of the intervening processes, such as walk- ing to the center table or to the control switch near the door. Whichever action I perform first, if the result of this intermediate step is successful the final situation is apt to be accompanied by a sense of fitness-if unsuccessful it is accompanied by a sense of un- fitness. In either case the judgment and feeling may attach to the act of finding (or failing to find) the switch, as well as to the out- come. When I start to read Professor X's latest book on Telepathy, I am immediately conscious of its unfitness to furnish me with any useful information on psychological problems. On the other hand upon taking up Professor Y's Psychology, I judge and feel at once its fitness to broaden my psychological outlook. The point to notice in these cases is that the feeling, whether of fitness or unfitness, may attach to an intermediate experience as well as to the fulfilment.</page><page sequence="20">24 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Further, it should be noted that the feeling attaches in every case to the present perceptual or ideal experiences-not to the forethought, which is already a thing of the past. The most striking occurrence of the fitness and unfitness ex- perience is in connection with subjective purposes, such as the solu- tion of a mathematical problem. Take the example already men- tioned: What is the next prime number above 47? Following the habitual numerical sequence my first thought is 48. That is even, and therefore unfit. 49? That is divisible by 7. 50 is a ten; 51 is divisible by 3; 52 is even. An even number is judged unfit imme- diately; the process is so rapid that it is sometimes mistaken for an intuition or a self-evident, a priori judgment. The discovery of divisibility by 3 is nearly as rapid; the digits 4 and 8 added together are obviously a multiple of 3. The division by seven is a longer process. What about 53? I divide it successively by 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23; all of these divisors are unfit; the next eligible factor is 29, which is more than half of 53. Hence I conclude that 53 is prime, and the sense of fitness arises with the solution of the problem. Another person might proceed by some other process, attempting, for instance, to divide 53 by 5 or 9, which I should consider useless; a third might refer at once to a memorized table of prime numbers, which in my own case is not available. This example, however we set about to solve it, is typical of problem-working. The procedure is this: First, we set forth the problem; that is, we experience the forethought of the principal result. Next, we think in turn of certain associated steps, with each of which is connected the sense of fitness or unfitness. Finally, when a result is obtained in thought which tallies with the fore- thought, it is accompanied by a judgment of correspondence and a feeling of fitness. The fitness experience is both a judgment and a feeling. The judgment, like all judgments, arises through association. If the experience corresponds to our memory of the forethought, the asso- ciation produces a judgment of fitness. The accompanying feeling is due to the facilitation of reaction which this association brings about. The judgment of unfitness occurs only when the forethought re- mains in consciousness (or is recalled) and becomes associated with a different act of sensations. If the act goes wrong, the perceptions attending the performance no longer tally with the forethought. When a memory of the forethought is associated with these disparate perceptions the association produces a judgment of unfitness. The resulting inhibition of reaction produces certain physiological modi- fications which serve as a basis for the feeling of unfitness. Irrelevant</page><page sequence="21">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 25 acts are not associated with the forethought-they are not judged unfit and are therefore not inhibited. My morning bath is not ger- mane to my pursuit of psychology-it is judged neither fit nor unfit to that end. In subjective purposes the distinction between judgments of fit- ness and unfitness is not easy to account for. In mental problems the forethought does not represent the solution, but merely some characteristic of solution. How do we come to judge certain steps fit and others unfit? This problem hinges on the nature of rational thought. Reasoning is a particular kind of association of ideas, more re- stricted than casual association. The succession of thoughts in a logical train corresponds so closely to the succession of processes in nature, that the conclusion tallies with reality time and time again;-in other words, "rational" thinking is a type which leads continually to fulfilment of the forethought, while chance associa- tions may or may not lead to such fulfilment. This persistent cor- respondence tends to build up cumulatively, in connection with "rational" thinking, a judgment of fitness which we have no oppor- tunity to build up in the ordinary hit-or-miss associations. Compare the judgments 51 17 X 3 and 51 -16 X 4. The latter is a random association and has no objective significance, whereas the rational association 51 17 X 3 means that 51 objects may be separated into 17 groups of 3 objects, or into 3 groups of 17 ob- jects. To the adult this is so certain from past observations of na- ture that he does not actually stop to perform the operation. In in- tricate problems, such as the solution of a chess problem, one is more likely to spend time in "verifying the solution" by objective observation, to make sure that the association has been rational throughout. When we form an association of the rational type the resulting ideas (conclusions) tally with nature. If, however, we happen to make a mistake, that is, form a non-rational association, we sooner or later come upon some unexpected inconsistency. In subjective purpose, so long as the associative process is rational or consistent, it is accompanied by a judgment of fitness. When we lapse into casual association we may still experience the same judgment of fitness; but as soon as an inconsistency appears the disparity trans- forms it into a judgment of unfitness. This occurs, for example, when we endeavor to separate our 51 objects into 16 groups of 4 each. Our examination of the fitness factor indicates the following as its characteristics: 1. The sense of fitness or the sense of unfitness attaches to the</page><page sequence="22">26 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY final outcome and to certain intermediate steps in purposive ex- periences, both objective and subjective. 2. The sense of fitness or unfitness does not appear in all pur- posive experiences. In simple purposes I assent to the forethought and the act proceeds to its fulfilment, usually with no judgment concerning the correspondence between forethought and outcome. It is only in complicated situations, or where attention is focused on the experience for the sake of psychological or ethical analysis, that the sense of fitness becomes explicit. To read it into all cases of purposive action is an instance of the psychologist's fallacy. Similarly, the sense of unfitness appears only when the fulfilment is impeded. But an implicit "fitness" or "uinfitness" appears to characterize purposive experiences generally. 3. The fitness factor is psychologically distinct from the fore- thought. The characteristic mark of the forethought is its future reference, while the fitness-unfitness experience involves a sense of correspondence or disparity. It is not merely a judgment, but in- volves an hedonic element as well. This completes our analysis of the purposive consciousness. So far as the present writer can discover no other mental data enter into the experience. Certain elements, which at first sight seem to present distinct characters, on closer examination reduce to one or other of the five factors already noted. In particular, the sense of choice, volition, or fiat is really nothing more than assent rein- forced by the feeling of personal dynamic efficiency. The distinctive feature of the purposive consciousness is thus seen to be an inversion of the usual temporal order of certain members in a series of experiences. In the purposive consciousness the idea precedes the perception, the general precedes the par- ticulaf. The extent of this inversion is recognized in the judg- ment of fitness. HOWARD C. WARREN.
