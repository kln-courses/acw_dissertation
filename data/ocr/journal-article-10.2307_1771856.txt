In the nineteenth century, imagined violence was represented in the rituals of chiefs and in the complex forms of minkisi, fabricated objects which could be invoked to inflict retribution on others. The imaginative representation of occult violence in these objects and in the insignia of chiefship has earned many of them a place in the world's art museums. In recent years, vividly imagined violence has been central to the popular understanding of national politics, in Congo/Zaire as in many other African countries; it can in fact be regarded as a theory of political life, and compared as such with Western theories concerning the social ordering of violence. A man I saw sitting in a village jail in Lower Congo in 1966 had been convicted of murdering six people by witchcraft and sending their souls to Kinshasa in aeroplanes made of leaves. The local court had imposed the maximum sentence in its power, 30 days imprisonment. The village was shocked but not deeply disturbed by the incident, as far as I could tell; to them, this kind of killing was almost banal. I found their response to this and many similar incidents puzzling, and have been trying ever since, with little success, to feel that I understood it. One strategy might be to recalibrate my sense of 'murder,' given that most deaths and indeed most misfortunes, including illness, are usually attributed by BaKongo to 'witchcraft,' kindoki; 'murder' is thus life's normal accompaniment. It is also necessary to qualify an English-speaker's normal sense of 'witchcraft,' since kindoki, though mysterious and dangerous, is a power that almost anyone may have and which is necessary to society's leaders and defenders, such as elders, diviners and magicians. If that is so, perhaps my mental adjustment should go so far as to reclassify kindoki from the domain of belief and irrationality ('religion') and begin to think of it as a theory of power, a political theory. In a paper called 'From humanism to the science of man: colonialism in Africa and the understanding of alien societies' (1976), Professor Ranger traced a history of social scientific misrepresentations of Africa, in which the exoticism of the results seemed to confirm the pretensions of the discipline. He told his story optimistically, looking forward to a humane comparative science which would not objectify those whom, in the intervening decades, it has however become regrettably conventional to call the Other. Ranger has always insisted that African thought must be taken seriously, even after (perhaps especially after) it has been invidiously glossed by such terms as 'witchcraft'; in particular, he has repeatedly shown that conceptual boundaries between the religious ISSN 1369-6815 print; 1469-9346 online/00/010063-13 ? 2000 Journal of African Cultural Studies</page><page sequence="2">64 Wyatt MacGaffey (irrational, 'traditional') and the political (rational, 'modem') must be transcended. This dichotomy has by no means disappeared; African concepts of power are still dismissed as characteristic only of 'traditional' rural populations circumscribed by ethnic boundaries, although a growing literature challenges this assumption by showing the role of such concepts in today's national politics (Lan 1985; Comaroff and Comaroff 1997; Gru6nais 1995; Meyer 1995; Schatzberg 1997; Ciekawy and Geschiere 1998; MacGaffey 2000). Let us rescue the unfortunate prisoner from his jail and resituate him in a broader context, the inventory of politically relevant powers; in so doing, we relieve the incident of at least some of its burden of idiosyncratic irrationality. In its unmarked sense, kindoki is the power to cause harm for the personal and therefore antisocial benefit of the witch. But those who defend society from witchcraft must themselves dispose of similar powers, also kindoki, which together constitute what Schatzberg has called a moral matrix of legitimate governance (Schatzberg 1993). From the earliest recorded times, BaKongo have relied on both chiefs and minkisi (sing. nkisi) to seek out and punish witches. Chiefs were human beings, usually but not always men, and minkisi were (and are) objects, but their functions could be closely similar to those of chiefs, who often relied on them to help maintain public order. Both chiefs and minkisi were invested with exceptional powers by the fact of having successfully undergone a ritual that tramsformed their ordinary, material substance. The rituals, ngyadulu for chiefs and mpandulu for minkisi, were similar in form and purpose, the insignia of the chief corresponding to the 'medicines' of the nkisi. The chiefs themselves could be called nkisi. Political responsibilities were therefore in the hands, it would seem, of a figure that was not only 'religious' but perhaps an object rather than a human being. An nkisi is a container, taking any of many different forms from an anthropomorphic figure to a cloth bundle, empowered by animating medicines. The principal classes of minkisi were those that healed and those, called 'blood nkisi' or nkondi (sing. and pl.; 'hunter'), that hunted down and punished witches, thieves, adulterers, treaty-breakers and other wrongdoers. Minkisi of the nkondi class were sometimes carried in litters as though they were chiefs, and chiefs could be appealed to in terms usually addressed to nkondi. Chiefs themselves were primarily characterized by their exceptional violence; like chiefs throughout Central Africa, the Kongo chief was 'a leopard' and a killer. One is told, 'if the candidate could not kill his nephew with the sword of power we would know that he was not fit to be chief.' The traditions say, 'The chiefs killed many of those they governed, and so they became famous.' Under Belgian rule, both invested killers and nkondi were suppressed. This paper draws upon indigenous texts that describe chiefship and nkondi in the nineteenth century, before opening a discussion of the place of violence in modem African political thought.l Nkondi took various forms, but they included impressive anthropomorphic statues stuck full of nails, many of them now well known as masterpieces of African art. Sometimes the pose of the figure, with upraised knife and thrusting jaw, is clearly aggressive; others display a curious serenity, contrasting with the implied violence of the nails and other hardware driven into chest, belly, shoulders, even the neck and face. The figures represent neither an avenging spirit force nor its victim (the witch or thief which it was commanded to find and punish), but the relationship between the two. The nails were 1 What follows is based on an examination of all the texts in K.E. Laman's corpus of 1915 (written in KiKongo by native speakers) that deal with the rituals of chiefship and of nkondi. Citations of the KiKongo texts give the author's name and the number of the Cahier from which the text is taken.

The topic of this paper is examined at greater length in MacGaffey (2000).</page><page sequence="3">Violence in Central Africa 65 intended both to annoy the nkisi, arousing it to action, and to represent the pains that it was called upon to inflict. People seek out the nganga [operator; pl. banganga] of Nkondi to have him drive iron into his nkisi. When he has driven in spikes on account of the bad dreams the sick person is having, he tells the ghost [that animates the nkisi ] about those who are pleased to carry troubles to that house. If the witch does not desist from his hostility towards others at night... he will see in his dream his house on fire and himself trapped in a palmwine tapper's climbing loop. There will be a raging storm, and people fighting. That will make him think the dreams have come to set him on fire, his mouth will be dry: 'Nkondi Mukwanga has pursued me here, surely I will die in the same fashion.' Not long afterwards he will feel a burden on his back, a pain in the blood, blood will gush from his nose, and he will die of this affliction. People will say, 'Nkondi Mukwanga came to take him, because of conflicts in the night, but now it is over' (Kwamba 149). It is difficult to exaggerate the violence of the images comprised in invocations to nkondi; presumably they expressed not only the violence of storms and birds of prey but the anger and grief of clients who felt themselves to be under attack: Have you not heard, Mwene Mutinu, that something has gone missing here? it is a difficult matter, we have asked everybody in the village. Their denial is, that they did not do it, that we should look for the culprit and punish him only. Therefore Mutinu, lick your mother! Strike, destroy, do you not see the village? Slash and sweep. Afflict them with boils, with sores that never heal; spread skin diseases throughout the village, give them all headaches, twist their arms and legs, Lord Mutinu. Infect all the children with coughs and colds. Spread confusion and misery among them. Whenever they seem to get better, strike them down again. Enfeeble them until they seek out the diviner who will identify you, Mwene Mutinu (Kavuna 58). To me, the violence represented here is imaginary, although it corresponds to the kind of afflictions to which Kongo villagers were in truth vulnerable a century ago, including painful or debilitating illnesses, destructive tropical storms, and the attacks of dangerous animals. The afflicted, however, believed that their sufferings were induced by the real though hidden actions of relatives and neighbours, either witches or the clients of some nkisi, which would then have to be appeased. Nkondi's function was political; it was used very generally to control relations between localized clans. Even if the offender against which it was directed was an individual, nkondi held his whole group responsible, punishing any of them until restitution had been made. A legend traces the origin of Nkondi za Mafula, 'nkondi of the entrances to the village,' to the need to put an end to the primordial war of all against all: The people were numerous in the country, and anyone who went to a village where he had no affines nor members of his own clan would be attacked and put in stocks until ransom was paid. Thus they made it known that this was a strong clan. But the elders said, if we carry on like this what will happen to us when we travel to other regions? Ah, it is not good to imprison someone with no fault to his charge; therefore it would be a good thing to set up Nkondi in the midst of the clans. But within the clan you may not invoke Nkondi (Kwamba 139). This description accurately reflects conditions prevailing in most of Kongo during the period of the slave trade in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when large tracts between settlements were unpopulated and unregulated. Traders depended on cultic associations and treaties to guarantee them safe passage and a kindly reception; often it was considered advisable to carry protective minkisi and to perform special rituals before and after an expedition. Where no chief had arisen to control a given area, treaties between clans, forbidding war and permitting marriage, were commonly sanctioned by</page><page sequence="4">66 Wyatt MacGaffey Nkondi; the parties to the agreement invited the nkisi to attack anyone who broke it. According to an English trader (Phillips 1887: 161): These fetishes play a most important part in regulating the conduct of individuals or families - nay, intertribal feuds are settled by the same means, decisions enforced, disturbances. A large number of cases which, in the absence of fetishes, would be matter for governmental repression, are thus dealt with in a simple, private, inexpensive manner, never coming to the cognizance of [the European government's appointed] native chiefs at all. Though minkisi continued in covert use, spectacular nkondi with public regulatory functions had more or less disappeared by 1920 under the combined influence of government and Christian missions. Popular anxieties concerning witchcraft continued, together with sporadic movements intended to rid communities of its baneful effects. One of these, Munkukusa, which swept Kongo villages between 1947 and the early 1950s, recapitulated the essential elements of nkondi rituals, without the use of a central image, in an exploded or deconstructed form combined with Christian elements. Grave dirt was brought at night from the cemetery to the village church to be placed on the high table. When the ancestors of all the clans were represented by quantities of dirt, it was all dumped in a cross-shaped trench in front of the door of the church, called 'the cross of Jesus.' Into a second cross, of wood, each of the villagers in turn hammered a nail while swearing, 'If I am a witch, if I have eaten my elders, then let my sign be death!' Immediately afterwards he smeared mud from the cross of Jesus on his face; the name Munkukusa refers to this rubbing, which has the same function as medicines from nkondi applied to the body to establish a connection between the nkisi and the oath- taker (Janzen and MacGaffey 1974: 83). The nailing procedure, koma nloko, 'to nail a curse,' also described any of several standardized ways by which an individual could appeal for help by insulting or provoking a chief; the verb koma, besides meaning 'to nail,' also means 'to arouse, provoke.' In retaliation, the chief would seize the plaintiff and only release him after the offending party had paid a large sum amounting to a fine (this mode of arbitration is known throughout Central Africa). Nkondi, too, could be 'aroused' by insults referring for example to the genitals of the nkisi's mother-in-law or suggesting that it was the laughing-stock of the neighbourhood, not an nkisi at all but merely a piece of wood. The rituals for investing chiefs differed from district to district in Kongo, but everywhere the chief was transformed by them into a 'leopard' and a killer. 'Whoever is to be invested brandishes the sword of power and having brandished it he kills a nephew and licks blood from the sword' (Lunungu 159). Laman says that many of those appointed as ntinu refused to commit the required murder, but might submit to other tests of extraordinary capacities (Laman 1957: 140). Usually a hunt or mock battle followed the investiture, demonstrating by its success that the investiture had worked, that the power to kill had been induced. The investiture sequence exemplified the same principles as did the composition of an nkisi. It began with the burial of the chief's predecessor, from whom the candidate acquired power by contact: When someone had accepted the office, the Children took him and put him in the house with the corpse of the dead chief. They set him down on the wrapped bundle of the corpse and laid him out on it. While he lay on the nyombo, they marked him with red and white clay and sang this song, 'He has seen the leopard, the Spotted One, the frightful creature.' Then the Children took him and carried him on their backs to his house (Matunta 313). The leopard, 'the spotted one,' was the mummy of his predecessor, coloured in transitional red. Among the BaYanzi, east of the BaKongo, who along with other peoples</page><page sequence="5">Violence in Central Africa 67 of the region share the same ritual values, the candidate could not be invested until an actual leopard, believed to incarnate his predecessor, had been killed, indicating ancestral acceptance of his candidacy. At his own death the chief's nails would be cut and his teeth broken to render him less dangerous in his leopard phase (De Plaen 1974). In some parts of Kongo, the candidate might be obliged to seek the approval of the dead by spending the night in a cave, a rite analogous to that of leaving an nkisi in the cemetery; if the nkisi were still there in the morning, or the candidate emerged alive and mysteriously marked with red and white spots, the approval of the dead was assured. Investiture included the composition of an nkisi nsi, a medication of the domain (nsi). In a hole in the earth were placed items which, like the medicines of an nkisi, suggested by their names or association the attributes of the chief's power. Examples include a kinkanda monkey, known for its resistance to death; a double bell, used to make official announcements; leopard's claws and teeth; creepers, which by their ramification suggested the ever-expanding power and perdurability of chiefship; lusaku- saku, a plant, that the chief's reign might be blessed, sakumunwa ; mungodila, for strength, ngolo. Whoever is the one being invested - or two of them, as it may be - holds the sword of power which is to be put in the ground. The first chief is the principal to hold the sword, or there may be two principals. When they hold the sword that is to be put in the ground, the principal puts his hand uppermost, the others after him, and together they brandish it, so that the power is 'raised.' Then they thrust it into the hole so that 'the power stands forth.' Then other chiefs stick their fingers in the hole. The hole signifies two things: the chief who stood the sword in the hole has the power of execution, and those who held it after him and held it in the hole have the power to bury alive prisoners, or anyone who has committed a crime such as murder or disregarding the chief's law (Lutete 232). The insignia prepared for the chief included some of the finest products of Kongo art, which were expected to combine aesthetic merit with messages of violence. 'The man who carved the chief's staff and made it frightful received a slave as payment' (Lutete 236); the candidate also received: A cap with leopard claws, the whole thing sewn over with leopard claws; a necklace of leopard's teeth to go on his neck; and on his arms ivory bracelets - not those that come from Europe, but in this country they cut pieces of ivory and make bracelets of them. The bracelets were on his arms from the wrist to the elbow; both arms were full of bracelets. He also put two copper bracelets on his arms. The reason he wore ivory bracelets and leopard's claws and a necklace of leopard's teeth is this: that he might be respected as those animals are. He would be seen as frightening like the leopard and the elephant. When he put on the cap, the necklace and the bracelets, all who saw him would feel fear and respect. If they had a tooth of a lion also, they would attach that to the necklace (Kunzi 123). In the following account from Mayombe the arbitrary exactions of the chief are as evident as the fact that theatrically enacted violence celebrates his greatness and helps to keep the people terrified. The clan which ruled over all the clans that came from Ntandu was Ma Nsundi, who oppressed them greatly. He had a rule that no one might step over the legs of the wife of the king, Ma Nsundi, nor step on her mat [both actions implying sexual intercourse]. If people did not closely follow the commands of Ntinu Ma Nsundi they were made prisoner, that is, tied up; one who did not have 100 cloths with which to redeem himself would be executed by the royal sword. The king appointed one man to execute prisoners. The sword (mbele ya makenda) was made with an ivory handle, well carved in the form of a woman, showing her hairstyle and her breasts; it was very sharp. This knife could not be taken outside except on the day of execution (Babutidi 13).</page><page sequence="6">68 Wyatt MacGaffey The missionary ethnographer L. Bittremieux saw such a sword in Mayombe, probably in the 1930s. It was 70 cm. long, kept in a raffia bundle along with other insignia of the chiefship, and handled with reverence. Originally, it had been one of four, two male and two female, of which one was damaged and two had been taken by Europeans. The 'flawless' ivory carving showed a woman with her long hair dressed down her back and her hands crossed behind her; the reference of the image is to the execution, in the sacred forest, of a woman caught in adultery (Bittremieux 1940: 119-20). On the appointed day, all the people of the region came to watch. From all directions they brought palm wine for the king. They laid the prisoner on his [or her] back and pegged his arms and legs to the ground. Then they sang, 'Eh, Makenda, who executes people!' While they sang, ndungu drums, large mbuma drums, ngongi bells and wooden mpwanda trumpets sounded. Makenda, the man appointed to this work, danced with his sword in his hand.2 When he raised it to strike, he sang, 'I will cut, eh, let it cut!' Uttering this threat, he furiously attacked the prisoner, severing his head. The public applauded, 'E wewe!' The Children and Grandchildren of Ma Nsundi took up the head and soaked it in water until it rotted and the skin and the flesh fell away; then they hung the skull on one of the poles of the king's compound so that passing strangers might see it and know that this was the residence of a great king who executed people. The 'sword of power' (mbeele a lulendo) was also called kipaba, and in coastal regions (Ngoyo) in particular it might be made of wood; in that form it was a sign rather than a weapon (but there is no record of a MuKongo ever fighting with a sword!). When the chief Makonde Mambutu was to be enthroned, he would order a sword from the smith (ngangula). The kipaba was used as follows. If a man was sentenced by others but did not submit, they would appeal to Mambutu who, when he came, would stick his sword in the ground to open the trial. When the recalcitrant saw the kipaba he would immediately agree to pay his fine because the sword stuck in the public place of trial (mbazi a nkanu) signified that the chief had 'arisen.' The meaning of the kipaba is that anyone who rejected the decision of the chief would be arrested until his people ransomed him (Babutidi 18). Chiefly titles were both a reward for wealth and a means to increase it. Most of our authors emphasize the cost of titles; in Mayombe an important constituent of the investiture fee consisted of slaves. Lutete gives few figures, but Kinkela wrote that the investors would receive 'shackles of the day and of the night,' that is, ten slaves of each kind; those 'of the night' were handed over by occult means (kindoki), meaning that the corresponding number of individuals would be seen to die some time later. Doutreloux was told that these slaves were young women (Doutreloux 1967: 169-70). Besides the animals consumed at the feast, Kinkela wrote, 'I have heard that one candidate was charged 30 slaves, also goats, pigs, ducks, chickens and quantities of palm wine, no telling what the cost' (Kinkela 94; Doutreloux 1967: 169-70, 190).3 These payments amounted to physical announcements of the kind of powers over production that the invested chief was supposed to wield. Once invested, the chief could help himself to anything he fancied, including any woman; no one could object, because it was 'a rule of the title.' Moreover, his death would be an occasion for further levies, either through special rules obtaining at that time or simply because social standards demanded the expenditure of huge amounts of imported gunpowder and cloth, plus ritual fees and food for feasts. Invested chiefs were buried in the royal cemetery, minor chiefs at its edge; 2 Kenda, to decapitate. 3 The night people became a source of occult power for those who received them, exactly as an nkisi derived force from a victim imprisoned in it, and a witch accumulated witchcraft powers (makundu).</page><page sequence="7">Violence in Central Africa 69 commoners had their own cemetery, and the bodies of people of no importance might be thrown aside. The length and cost of the funeral varied accordingly. The rituals of investiture identify the chief with the leopard, and some of them required him to perform public acts of exceptional violence: to kill his nephew, to hand over ten or more slaves to the investors, to sponsor dramatic public executions, and so on. How much of this violence in fact occurred? Why is it specified in some rituals but not all? All of it seems quite likely, except that the same text that speaks of slaves handed over 'by day' mentions a like number 'by night,' by occult means. It is a commonplace of the texts that chiefs 'oppress and kill and make war upon other clans.' How much of this violence was part of the history of the times rather than of the essence of chiefship? What is the relation between model and 'fact'? The rituals of chiefly investiture were undeniably anchored in local politics and economics. They initiated wealthy men into what was effectively a title association whose members reinforced their oligarchic control over populations of slaves or potential slaves, and who profited from the initiation fees required of new members. In 1816, a tree stood outside the compound of the king of Boma, hung with the skulls of his enemies. In the vicinity of Mukimbungu, in the 1880s, local chiefs consecrated a trade pact by executing a slave whose body hung from a tree until it disintegrated. Ivory carvings from Mayombe show the chief, his munkwisa in his teeth, enthroned upon the body of a slave, bound and gagged, and a soapstone figure shows a chief driving a knife into the ear of a man upon whom he is sitting. 'When a chief [with the title] Kayi Ngoma first began to rule and took charge of his market, he buried a man alive and then entered the market' (Kimbembe 80). In 1929, in the vicinity of Kisantu (eastern Kongo), an official executioner admitted having killed six slaves at the funeral of the reigning chief's predecessor (Swartenbroeckx 1966: 171). The victims did not have to be criminals, though one who, on another occasion, had broken market rules might be executed in similar fashion. It is probably irrelevant to try to distinguish between 'criminal' and non- criminal victims; both established the chief s power. It is tempting, therefore, to suppose that the images of death in the rituals expressed the actual violence of nineteenth century chiefs, who achieved renown by fighting wars, enslaving the weak, publicly executing wrongdoers, and sacrificing others in political rituals. But the same rituals describe the chief's violence as 'imaginary,' a form of witchcraft, and suggest that chiefship was a depersonalized power whose principles, realized in the chief, were only 'contingently' (accidentellement) attached to his person (Doutreloux 1967: 199). Often enough, a community that felt it needed a chief for the mystical benefits that were mediated by the office had to capture some unwilling individual who would be no more than a living nkisi embodying in mythologized form the contradictions of Kongo society. Some traditions required that the chief be castrated or impotent. His function as a sort of animate nkisi-object is striking; usually, he and his followers, like the nganga and associates of any major nkisi, were subject to a number of restrictions, including some which emphasized that though the chief was a leopard he was also not a leopard, or should not be so to excess: The chief may not tear at meat with his nails, for to do so is to summon the Lord of the Country (Mfumu a nsi, the leopard); he must cut it with a knife. He may not scratch with his nails on the ground for the same reason; leopards will attack livestock in the village. He must not eat meat that is still bloody, as leopards do. He may not eat standing up, and he may not sleep in the village of another chief. He may not carry palmwine; that is for his slaves and the Children to do. He may not open the lukobe, the box of medicines that is kept inside his house, lest in a little while the leopard attack the livestock (Matunta 314).</page><page sequence="8">70 Wyatt MacGaffey Additional rules show the extent to which the chief was a creature of his clan's relatives by marriage, its Children and Grandchildren. The power of the nkisi to cure leprosy provided them with interesting means of disciplining the chief. He would contract the disease if he returned to the investiture site on his own, or if he ate the meat of goat, the harnessed bush-buck, or the striped mbende field-rat, and would have to pay the banganga to cure him by reconsecrating him. The Children kept the leopardskin itself: If the Children suffer an injustice at the hands of the chief or the clan of their Fathers, and are sad or angry on account of such an attempt by their Fathers, they speak as follows: 'Are we not your Children? If we are not your Children, show us the place of your investiture.' If the chief should argue with his Children he would contract leprosy. Until he paid a fine, the Children of the chief would hide the skin in the place where they kept it. When they put it somewhere in order to control the chiefship of their Fathers, the Fathers would have to pay them the fine of a pig, for they knew that the chiefship was in the skin (Lunungu 171). In effect, the restrictions could be no more than devices for controlling the chief and extracting wealth from his lineage. We are left, therefore, with a double ambiguity, insoluble on the evidence available: some of the powers of a given chief were no doubt 'real,' others can only have been 'imaginary'; some chiefs were apparently despots, but others were no more than puppets. These ambiguities, however, are products not so much of the data themselves as of my reading of them, since the distinctions between real and imaginary, person and object are ones that I feel I have to make. A traditional anthropological comment on the violence of Central African kings is that killing, like the incest sometimes required of the ruler, symbolizes the king's exceptional status with respect to normal society. The BaKongo indeed think that killing indicates powers that ordinary people do not have; one who could not kill as expected lacked what it takes to be chief, and one who could even kill a relative demonstrated that he would govern impartially. The concept of power is more complex than that, however; the obligatory horrendous deed is thought of as a real test, not a symbolic change of status. The witchcraft power (kindoki) that leaders and wealthy people must have takes the form of a sort of gland in the belly, called kundu , which in former times could be revealed by means of the poison ordeal, nkasa. The activity of the witch (ndoki) is to 'eat people' (dia bantu); the more victims one eats, the more makundu he accumulates. This expression is not a metaphor; actual bones found around someone's house may be adduced in evidence against him. It is true that the meal is supposed to take place in an otherworld, visible only in dreams or to diviners, who have four eyes, but it is none the less real. The chief, too, is supposed to 'eat' in the visible sense that he is expected to consume conspicuously, that he should also cause his followers to eat well, and that the cost of this benefit is a certain amount of occult 'eating' of nocturnal victims handed over by the chief to those from whom he obtains his power or with whom he is obliged to bargain for the good of his people. In Kongo thinking, an ordered society is one in which 'eating,' both literal and metaphorical (but for whom is it a metaphor?) is properly distributed. Identification of authority with violence did not mean that in fact the chiefs always ruled by force. The English sailor Andrew Battell reported in the seventeenth century, 'In Cases Criminall they proceed but slenderly, for they doe very hardly and seldome condemne any man to death.' From northern Mayombe we learn that a chief may be invested when it is seen that his deeds are remarkable, but only if he looks after people well and provides for strangers. 'Though he looks like a chief, but does not do good, he cannot be given chiefship' (Mvubu 343). Kindoki, the idiom of power, is also, by its ambiguity, a medium of negotiation, providing sanctions against chiefs as well as in</page><page sequence="9">Violence in Central Africa 71 support of them. The point was made some time ago by Karen Fields with respect to British rule in what is now Zambia. Where 'witchcraft practices' were part of the moral fabric of the community, District Officers were forced to rely on them as an alternative to less subtle forms of violence, and came to recognize that the official program to root out 'superstition' and create a fully 'rational' political system made no sense (Fields 1982). Though it is impossible to estimate how much violence occurred in Kongo during the nineteenth century (before Europeans penetrated the interior), it was probably not extensive, and in any case it was limited by a specific sense of its meaning as an indication or test of magical potency. During the first World War, BaKongo were appalled to hear of the continuing slaughter in Europe; their own wars, being essentially divinatory ordeals or trials by combat, ended after the first casualties: As soon as one or two people had died, they would halt and sound the ngongi so that the chiefs could negotiate, saying, 'Put up your weapons!' Everyone returned to the village. When they were ready they beat the great nkoko drum; the chiefs sounded ngongi at all the entrances, and the war was over. Those responsible for causing the deaths paid 'thousands' (mafunda, cloth bundles or the equivalent) and slaves; if two men died, they paid two people and two thousand. In their wars few died (Mato 280). Introducing a collection of papers on violence, David Riches remarks that the act of violence is always one of contested legitimacy, thus a sign of the presence of political competition (Riches 1986: 9). The essential personnel in the act of violence are the performer, the victim and 'the witness,' that is, the audience whose judgment is sought with regard to the legitimacy of the event. Violence, whether 'real,' as in stabbing, or 'imaginary,' as by sorcery, is both highly visible and highly comprehensible; its performance requires little more than the resources of the human body. The properties of violence, uniquely among social acts, 'make it highly appropriate both for practical (instrumental) and for symbolic (expressive) purposes: as a means of transforming the social environment (instrumental purpose) and dramatizing the importance of key social ideas (expressive purpose), violence can be highly efficacious' (ibid: 11). The aesthetic aspect is an important element of performances of violence before an audience, even when the violence is instrumentally real. The two functions of violence correspond to the actual use of violence, as in war and kidnapping, and to its dramatization in chiefly myth and ritual; clearly, the two are not independent, but neither does the one follow from the other. Moreover, the specific content, certainly of ritual violence, and to a considerable extent also of practical violence, is culturally embedded, that is, it conforms to a particular, local tradition. In the absence of the necessary historical data, we may tentatively resolve the apparent contradiction between the celebrated violence of Kongo chiefs and the apparent fact that at least some of them were mere figureheads, or were esteemed for the mild virtues of wisdom and hospitality, by the classic device of distinguishing between the king and the kingship.4 The office, in the abstract, was defined by its violence and also by its guarantee of continuity in the face of dangers natural and social. The incumbent, however, was the person most suitable at the time, 'suitability' being defined by his abilities in relation to the current political situation. This distinction would not coincide, however, with that between 'imaginary' and 'real' powers, since for the BaKongo the reality of 'imaginary' kindoki explains all exceptional, 'real' effects. The 'West' or the 'modern' tends to be seen in the eyes of its native inhabitants as quintessentially civilized in part because they represent it as a domain of reasonable 4 I owe this suggestion to Edna Bay, who encountered a similar problem with respect to the kings of Dahomey.</page><page sequence="10">72 Wyatt MacGaffey discourse from which violence is excluded; war is waged in other parts of the world, murderers are sent away to jails. Violence is thus exceptional, deviant, the fault of others, although in the 1990s it became more difficult to sustain this comforting image. F. Barth mentions the peculiar disparity in our culture between ethical principles supporting justice and security, and 'the known existence of crime, perversity, and war.' The codifiers of our Theory of Man live on the polite side of this dichotomy, while persons who pass across it are 'subject to elaborate rites of brutalization or rehabilitation,' in jail or the electric chair. In other societies, this privileged innocence is not possible. The New Guinea village Barth is writing about is 'a world where attacker and victim were known to each other as social persons'; guests at festivals were known individually as the agents of specific acts of violence (Barth 1975). Discussing the Piaroa of Venezuela, Overing reports that they believe that all deaths are murders effected and also avenged by sorcery, although Piaroa life is free of physical violence and, from an observer's point of view, very peaceful (Overing 1986). BaKongo, too, think of themselves as constantly subject to violent attack, although (in the twentieth century at least) they have had a reputation for 'pacifism' and physical violence among them is mostly the work of the police. I once asked a man what had happened to his first wife; with resignation, not anger, he replied, 'Oh, her parents ate her on our wedding night.' Such 'eating,' provoked in this instance by the parents' quasi-legitimate dissatisfaction over the amount of marriage money they had received, happens 'at night,' invisibly, but it is real, not metaphorical, in the minds of those who speak of it. The occult power that makes such violence possible is kindoki, which all elders have in some degree and which is also a necessary attribute of chiefs and banganga. The ambiguities of the capacity for violence - an evil in private hands, beneficial when exercised by the guardians of public order; a terrifying and ever-present reality which is nevertheless invisible - complicate any attempt to interpret the models and realities of chiefship in the nineteenth century.5 Given the wide distribution of the idea that 'the chief is a leopard,' we can say that authority itself, at whatever level, was and is understood in Central and West Africa as necessary public violence (MacGaffey 1986; Vansina 1991). In Benin, 'the right to kill is the defining characteristic of kingship' (Ben-Amos 1976: 246). The violence of chiefs is culturally much more complex than the familiar functionalist idea that a sovereign should monopolize the power of life and death, or that he is obliged to defend the polity against invaders. That the chief at his investiture kills his nephew may state by implication that he will rule impartially, or that he has ceased to be an ordinary human being defined by social bonds, but it also implies a very particular view of human life and its availability as raw material for 'symbolism.' Among the eastern Luba, every new chief was anointed on his forehead with blood from a man sacrificed for the purpose. The chief put his foot on the skull and drank the victim's blood mixed with beer; unless he could do this he was no true chief (Lucas 1966: 90). The royal regalia, including beautifully carved female figures, were regularly anointed with the blood of sacrificial victims. The drum played only at the funerals and enthronements of chiefs was covered with skin from the scarified torso of a woman sacrificed for the purpose. The Nyim of the Bushoong (Kuba) was believed able to transform himself into a leopard and among the BaTetela the assimilation of the lineage chief to the leopard was so strong that he abstained from 5 The BaKongo have been noted in modern times for the absence of violence among them. By contrast, in Northern Ghana, where I have spent some time, violence is never far below the surface.</page><page sequence="11">Violence in Central Africa 73 eating its flesh, for 'the leopard does not eat the leopard' (De Heusch 1985: 98). Such a lineage chief was said 'to destroy men as the leopard destroys goats.' The Kanongesha of the Ndembu in modem Zambia sat on lion and leopard skins and wore a bracelet made of human genitalia which was soaked in sacrificial blood at each installation. He was a sorcerer who could cause barrenness in both land and people should he touch his bracelet to the ground (Turner 1957: 318-21). The relation of violence to other values is quite complex. The Kanongesha of the Ndembu, for example, was a ritual figure unable to control his nominal subordinates. Discussing the role of the Tetela lineage head, De Heusch notes that although the ritual characterizes chiefship as violent, in fact the candidate chief must be generous with his gifts if he is to be allowed, once in his lifetime, to wear the leopardskin; the circulation of goods, linked to the circulation of women as wives and mothers, expresses the perpetuation of life itself. At the festival in which the chief became a leopard, his wives as well as the members of his lineage were also allowed to wear the leopardskin (De Heusch 1954: 98). Among the Shona in Zimbabwe, where the chief is a 'lion,' David Lan notes that although, by their very nature, the spirits of dead chiefs are conquerors, warriors, and killers, 'it is through their violence that the fertility of the earth is made available to their descendants' (Lan 1985: 152). The Tetela lineage head, like most Kongo chiefs, achieved his position by obligatory generosity, and De Heusch can only explain his identification with the leopard by drawing upon psychoanalysis. Rene Girard has included African examples of violence related to royalty in his Violence and the Sacred (Girard 1977). He ranges widely in search of illustrative examples, which he believes generate a theory of the nature of 'primitive religion.' Necessary elements of this theory include the sacrifice of a surrogate victim, and an oedipal association in royal rituals between the king's obligatory incest and his symbolic death. According to Girard, the king assures the well-being of his people by taking their sins upon himself. Examples of this complex are said to exist in eastern Africa, 'between Egypt and Swaziland,' but appear to be lacking in the west. In none of the rituals of Kongo chiefship, for example, can the chief be regarded as a scapegoat; blood is not poured upon him, nor is royal incest practiced. In Bantu languages generally, 'to eat' is often used to denote access to power. The elephant is a chief among animals because it eats more than others. 'These are images which depict access to power as ingestion/incorporation rather than occupying a position or territory, or imposing order.' Power is understood as a personal property, but is 'tied to concrete embodiments, person, and material symbols, rather than to abstract structures such as offices, organizations, and territories' (Fabian 1990: 24). The metaphor of eating dominates the political culture of sub-Saharan Africa in the late twentieth century, but the linguistic association between 'wealth' and 'eating' is centuries old. It is a premise of 'the politics of the belly' that people admired for their success achieve it by eating the substance of others, using means which, in lesser men, would be criminal. Presidents and politicians are expected to demonstrate a capacity for larceny, 'corruption' and violence, as well as princely largesse towards their followers. At every political level, however, 'eating' is polysemous: it means not only to feed oneself, not at all easy in an economy of poverty, wracked by 'structural adjustment,' but also 'to accumulate, exploit, attack, conquer or kill by witchcraft' (Bayart 1993: 269). President Mobutu Sese Seko appealed to traditional values in 1965, when he deliberately entrapped four well-known politicians into a plot against him and then publicly executed them. After that, everybody knew that the easy-going politics and musical-chairs govemrnmental changes that had prevailed in what was then the Democratic</page><page sequence="12">74 Wyatt MacGaffey Republic of Congo were no more. In the face of world-wide protests, Mobutu argued at the time that he was expected to conduct himself with the decisive violence characteristic of 'a Bantu chief.' There is no reason to think that Mobutu had any true understanding of the chiefly tradition, but the tradition itself is pervasive. In 1980, popular opinion explained the arrival of Ba'hai missionaries in northeastern Zaire by the 'fact' that, in order to pay for the expensive new airport in Kisangani, the President had had to admit a new group of traders in souls whose nocturnal activities would bring in foreign exchange. On the other hand, the execution did not earn the President widespread admiration; my neighbours in 1965 were stunned: aesthetically imagined violence is easier to live with than the real thing. The violence of chiefs, to earn public approval, must be a contained violence. The chief as killer in defence of the public good readily slips into the mode of the chief as sorcerer and cannibal. In popular opinion, the death of prominent politicians in Zaire was never 'natural,' but always the result of some kind of sorcery. Opposition to Mobutu in the 1990s included stories, widely circulated in the press as well as by word of mouth, which accused him of strengthening his person and his regime by witchcraft and by occult techniques obtained from all over the world. It was believed that he was obliged to hand over the souls of citizens to pay for these secrets, as witches do and chiefs did. When the opposition parties denounced 'the harmful influence of the marabouts and other occult, destructive practices that govern us' they were not employing metaphor. Social scientific recognition of this complex has been inhibited by the conventional treatment of 'religion' and 'politics' as separate substances, and by the 'anthropologization' of indigenous belief, treating it as though it were characteristic only of 'traditional,' rural populations circumscribed by ethnic boundaries (Geschiere 1997). The liberal ethnocentrism of foreign commentators also inclines them to pass by in silence beliefs which they cannot personally endorse. Faced with the incredulity of strangers, educated Africans, however, do not hesitate to invoke 'African realities not apparent to the Cartesian rationality of the North' (Gru6nais et al., 1995: 166). One should not recklessly generalize about 'Africa,' certainly not about the distribution of violence in it. Even Mobutu, though he did not hesitate to order executions, did not rule primarily by violence, and the incidence of violence in Zaire, before the collapse of his regime in the bloody events of 1996-97, was not high. It is my impression, after living in Kisangani and studying court records there, that among ordinary people there was a somewhat higher rate of violent crime in the northeast than in the southwest of the country. The BaKongo of the southwest were described to me by magistrates as particularly preoccupied with witchcraft; it may be that imagined violence, now recorded only in legends about great chiefs of the past and in the vitrines of art museums around the world, substituted for the real thing.
