There are frequent discussions of similar pat- terns of behavior in other penguins as well as in other birds. These increase the breadth of the work and make it more useful to the reader who may be interested in the more general as- pects of avian sexual behavior, rather than spe- cifically in penguin behavior. There is an un- fortunate paucity of references to European literature, but the difficulties in securing these publications in New Zealand are great and the author can hardly be blamed for his unfamiliarity with them. A unique feature of the study, aside from the many years it required, is the author's intimate knowledge of each bird. This was achieved by banding every individual with especially made bands which could be react with the aid of a telescope at considerable distances. The idio- syncrasies of each of the 88 males and 96 fe- males, in nearly 300 matings, are thereby fully known. The body of the book consists of ten chapters which in turn deal with the scope of the study, an analysis of the types of behavior, pair forma- 2 Richdale, L. E. 1951.

At the end of each chapter there is a very useful summary. The appendices are concerned with accounts of the behavior of individual birds, which are too detailed to be of general interest, but offer an insight into the thorough nature of the study and the material from which the gen- eral conclusions were drawn. The plates are an integral part of the work and illustrate, often strikingly, many of the postures discussed in the text. It is unfortunate that unskillful retouch- ing has marred a number of them. Anthropomorphism has been scrupulously avoided, although in glancing through the pages the reader will note frequent references to "sheepish looks," "glares," "divorce," etc. These have been used to describe particular actions and do not bear the strict connotations associated with human behavior. The choice of these terms appears unfortunate at times, but as they are defined rigorously and used consistently they do not detract from the work if one first reads the definitions presented by the author. In a short review it is impossible to do justice to the wealth of entirely new information found in this book. Without doubt it is one of the classic ornithological studies of the century and should maintain its high position for many years. RAYMOND A. PAYNTER, JR. PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOR This book is an extension of a series of lec- tures delivered by the author in 1947 under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History and Columbia University. His avowed aim in publishing this material is two-fold; to acquaint Anglo-American readers with Euro- pean research in ethology, and to attempt to frame a formally consistent approach to prob- lems of patterned behavior. Delay in publication has made some of the examples cited familiar to English readers through the medium of a recent-symposium on animal behavior published by the Society for Experimental Biology. However, much of the material presented is not readily available else- where and the framework of Tinbergen's argu- ment justifies what repetition there is. An at- 1 Tinbergen, Nicholas. 1951.

Fortunately the author presents his material lucidly and does not descend to the succinct vagueness of review articles. The first half of the book is a discussion of the characteristics of instinctive behavior and its endogenous and exogenous causal factors. This discussion leads to a tentative definition of an instinct "as a hierarchically organized nervous mechanism which is susceptible to certain prim- ing, releasing and directing impulses of internal as well as external origin, and which responds to these impulses by coordinated movements that contribute to the maintenance of the indi- vidual and the species." Each element in this definition is discussed, particular stress being laid on the hierarchical character of instinctive behavior. This aspect of behavior leads Tin- bergen to postulate a group of nervous centers responsible for the activation of a motor re-</page><page sequence="2">April, 1952 REVIEWS 317 sponse when "released" by an appropriate stimu- lus. This release also permits potential activa- tion of a lower-order center on presentation of its appropriate stimulus and so on until the sequence is terminated in the release of the con- summatory act. This permits resolution of the nagging question of the plasticity or rigidity of instinctive behavior, since the motor set con- trolled by each center is termed an instinctive act. Descent of the hierarchy is characterized by increasing rigidity while the highest levels exhibit great plasticity. This formulation of the hierarchical character of instinctive behavior permits the author to es- tablish connections with neurophysiology at two points. He points out that Weiss's concept of hierarchy in central nervous system organi- zation is coterminal with the formulation out- lined above. Secondly he cites the work of Hess who succeeded in producing complete patterns of fighting, eating, and sleep by artificial local stimulation of the hypothalamus of intact ani- mals. The remainder of the book consists of essays on the ontogeny, phylogeny and adaptiveness of instinctive behavior. A third aim, patent throughout the book, is a careful definition of minimum standards in ethological work. The complexity of the phe- nomena studied makes workers in this area painfully susceptible to the pitfalls of over- simplification. In standardization of conditions, both internal and external factors must be con- sidered. Further, results become meaningful only in the context of the totality of the patterned hierarchy. Throughout, the author's discussion of such considerations is lucid and compelling. This is a preliminary formulation of frag- mentary data clothed at points by a monolayer of fact. Its tentative and exploratory character is made explicit by the author in his preface. It is at the same time a formulation of power ample to compel careful and critical marshalling of evidence by both proponents and dissenters. It is further a formulation which is sufficiently precise to guide subsequent research. It is, finally, thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating reading. F. A. BROWN, JR. G. C.
