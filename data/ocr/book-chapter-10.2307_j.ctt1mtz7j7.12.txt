The study of this varied spectrum of  cultural practices allows us to understand how rituals,  regardless of their scale, produce and reproduce social Francesca Fernandini and  dispositions within a society (Bourdieu 1977). Mario Ruales Throughout this chapter we intend to move beyond  the dualistic distinctions that segregate ritual and  domestic as two apparently incommensurable realms  of social life (Angelo 2014) by exploring ritual as a  relational practice. In doing so, we propose that ritual  practices are better understood from a multi-scalar  approach that emphasizes the way meanings, social  rules, and relations are embedded within the recurrent  practices that produce and reproduce their material  habitus (Bourdieu 1977; Hodder and Cessford 2004). In  this way the nature of ritual can be seen as a process in  which repetitive actions socialize people into particu- lar dispositions; in turn, these dispositions establish a  recursive relationship with rituals in which social mean- ing is produced and reformulated through repetition. This study focuses on the multiple facets of ritual  practices at Cerro de Oro in an attempt to explore  how everyday mundane practices, such as disposal DOI: 10.5876/9781607325963.c008 169 </page> <page sequence="2"> activities, as well as sacred ceremonies, such as large-scale closure practices  and intrusive burials, form part of the ritual spectrum. Following this line  of argument, emphasis is placed on how the recurrence of these practices  defines ritual as a relational process that produces and reproduces social  meanings throughout time. Cerro de Oro, located in the Lower Cañete Valley, is a large monumen- tal settlement that presents continuous occupation from the end of the Early  Intermediate Period (EIP) (ad 500–600) to Early Republican times (ad 1540– 1600) (Fernandini 2015; Rostworowski de Diez Canseco 2004; Ruales 2000).  Its denser occupation is associated with a continuous period between the end  of the EIP and the start of the Middle Horizon (MH) (ad 500–800), a period  that has been labeled the Cerro de Oro occupation (Fernandini 2015; Fernandini  and Alexandrino 2016). The architectural and cultural contexts of Cerro de  Oro are concentrated over a large mound that spans 145 ha (figures 8.1, 8.2).  The majority of Cerro de Oro occupation contexts are located toward the south  and northeast sections of the mound, while the Late Intermediate Period (LIP)  (ad 1000–1475) and Late Horizon (ad 1476–1534) contexts are located more in  the north and northwest sections. Moreover, a late period intrusive cemetery  area intrudes the Cerro de Oro occupation contexts in the south. Though many archaeologists recognize Cerro de Oro as an important settle- ment for the development of social complexity on the Peruvian South Coast  (Engel 2010; Kroeber 1937; Menzel 1964; Ruales 2000; Stumer 1971), Cerro  de Oro has been markedly underrepresented in academic research. During  the early twentieth century, archaeologists such as Tello in 1923 (Kroeber  1937; Stumer 1971; Tello 1923) and Wallace in 1958–59 (Wallace 1963) per- formed sporadic excavations at the site without proper documentation and  with limited publications. It was not until the early twenty-first century that  investigations continued at Cerro de Oro with the Proyecto de Investigación  Arqueológica Cerro de Oro (PIACO), led by Ruales (2000), focusing mainly  on the Southwest Area of the settlement (ibid.). Following this investigation,  Fernandini (2013, 2014) led the Proyecto Arqueológico Cerro de Oro (PACO)  between 2012 and 2015, which centered on the Southeast Area (Southeast Plain  and Southeast Ravine; see figure 8.2). Both PIACO and PACO documented  EIP and MH (Cerro de Oro occupation) contexts, showing a continuous occu- pation between these periods. This continuous occupation was characterized  by a sequence of floors that extend from the modern surface to bedrock. The Cerro de Oro1 occupation revealed a series of changes in the artifact assem- blage as well as in the usage of space. Architecturally, this occupation demon- strated a radical increase in monumentality and settlement size. Numerous  170 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="3"> Figure 8.1. Map showing the location of Cerro de Oro and neighboring valleys  compounds, platforms, and monumental structures were constructed follow- ing a recurrent 240° orientation on east-west walls and a 60° orientation on  north-south walls with relatively regular sizes and shapes of adobe (ca. 10–15  cm × 10 cm × 3.5 cm), covering an area of approximately 80 ha. Most of these  walls were stuccoed, while several were painted white and yellow and included  numerous friezes (Ruales 2000). As a way to clarify the spatial configuration  of Cerro de Oro, the settlement has been divided into different sectors and  areas within those sectors. This study focuses on the South Sector, mainly on  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 171 </page> <page sequence="4"> Figure 8.2. Map of Cerro de Oro showing SW Area (PIACO) and SE Area (SE Plain  and SE Ravine) (PACO)  the excavations performed by Ruales on one of the compounds in the SW  Area and on the research conducted by Fernandini on two compounds in the  SE Plain and three platforms from the SE Ravine. Research performed in these areas has brought light to some of the activi- ties that took place in different spaces of the settlement. For instance, evidence  from excavations has shown a marked difference between activities that took  place in the compounds of the SE Plain and those performed in the platforms  of the SE Ravine. This evidence shows that while the SE Ravine was associ- ated mainly with food processing, cooking, and disposal activities, the com- pounds on the SE Plain point to storage and communal gathering and eating. Likewise, the ceramic assemblage pertaining to the Cerro de Oro occupation  shows a very standardized process of ceramic production in which paste com- position seems to present very small variations. However, as the spatial con- figuration of the settlement was reshaped, a series of ceramic innovations also  changed the ceramic repertoire. These innovations are reflected in the intro- duction of foreign designs and a new shape: the colador (sieve). New designs  seem to have been introduced as a process of hybridization in which local  ceramics were blended with elements from Nasca-, Chakipampa-, Lima-,  Estrella-, and possibly Cajamarca-style traditions. This process seems to have  been a local response to the highly interactive social context that characterized  172 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="5"> Figure 8.3a, 8.3b.

Moreover, coladores  are elaborate vessels with thin walls and fine pastes that always present some  type of decoration. Microbotanical evidence from residue analysis shows the  remains of non-local beans,2 reflecting the idea that these vessels could have  been involved in the production of an important drink or food. Situating Cerro de Oro within its cultural and geographic setting shows  that it was the largest settlement in the Lower Cañete Valley during the end  of the EIP and the start of the MH (Chavez 2006; Ruales 2000). During  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 173 </page> <page sequence="6"> Figure 8.4. Prehispanic settlements in the Lower Cañete Valley. Adapted from Chavez  2006.  this time there seems to have been an increase in the number of settlements  located 5 km or more from the Cañete River, with Cerro de Oro 13 km from  the river (figure 8.4). This change in the area’s settlement pattern has been  interpreted in association with an expansion of the canal system, allowing  for the enlargement of the agricultural frontier and the positioning of new  settlements. Given that Cerro de Oro was the largest site and was the farthest  from the river, it is possible that it could have been the prime mover behind  hydraulic investments. Neighboring valleys also experienced drastic changes in material culture  during the end of the EIP and start of the MH, which seem to be associated  with Cerro de Oro. Prior to this period, the Cañete, Asia, and Mala Valleys  showed a cultural affiliation or unity reflected in a similar material culture as  well as mortuary and settlement patterns (Ángeles Falcón 2009; Gabe 2000).  During the end of the EIP and start of the MH, these inter-valley affinities  became more noticeable, with Cerro de Oro playing a pivotal social and possi- bly political role. Ruales (2000) argues Cerro de Oro played this role given that  it was the only monumental settlement in the Mala, Asia, and Cañete region  that had a dominant presence in the landscape because of its location on a  high mound and its highly visible painted walls. Also, the population size of  174 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="7"> the Cerro de Oro occupation, calculated based on the number of domestic struc- tures at Cerro de Oro and compared with evidence recorded through surveys  conducted on the Asia and Mala Valleys (Ángeles Falcón 2009), seems to have  greatly surpassed that of any neighboring valley. While a ceramic production  center has yet to be recorded at the site, excavations by PACO yielded large  amounts of ceramics that repeatedly show the same type of decorations, colors,  and shapes. Based on this evidence, we suggest that Cerro de Oro maintained  control of ceramic production and distribution; however, only further research  will clarify this phenomenon. Furthermore, Ruales’s (2000) finding of a kipu  in a context associated with the main platform at Cerro de Oro hints at a  complex management of resources at the site. Excavations at Cerro de Oro have shown that the presence of Cerro de  Oro–style ceramics was recurrently associated with the construction of high  walls and platforms and the reorganization of internal divisions. Likewise, the  shift toward monumentality and possible mass production of ceramics was  also reflected in the Cañete and Asia Valleys through an increase in popula- tion, as revealed by a rise in the number and size of sites (Ángeles Falcón 2009;  Chavez 2006) (figure 8.4). Moreover, the Asia Valley presents evidence for a  hiatus in the use of the main funerary and ceremonial space, Huaca Malena.  This site was used from the EIP through MH 2 (ad 800–1000), until the Cerro  de Oro political organization declined (Ángeles Falcón 2009; Ángeles Falcón  and Pozzi-Escot 2000). Therefore, we suggest that Cerro de Oro grew as a  political center, with its presence resonating in the surrounding settlements. Thus, we argue that from the end of the EIP and beginning of the MH,  Cerro de Oro housed a ruling group that foresaw the enlargement of the set- tlement’s size and appearance and the increase in ceramic production and that,  to some extent, influenced the populations from the Cañete and neighboring  valleys. Cerro de Oro appears to have been a short-lived but well-organized  political center that exerted an important influence within the Mala-Asia- Cañete cultural unit. This influence has been recognized mainly through the  recurrence of settlement patterns and funerary and ceremonial practices in  contemporary contexts in these valleys (Ángeles Falcón 2009). Ritual pRactices at ceRRo de oRo Everyday Domestic Practices Cerro de Oro’s urban-like characteristics and possible mass production  of ceramics reveal a complex settlement in which people were organized  in a physically controlled landscape that reproduced hierarchical structures  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 175 </page> <page sequence="8"> through the maintenance of a systematically planned environment and a  consistent material culture. In this context evidence for homogeneous ritual  practices in different sectors of the site reflects a systematic organization of  ceremonialism. From excavations carried out by PIACO and PACO, it seems  that these ceremonies ranged from regularly occurring small-scale rituals to  closure or single-use ceremonies. A particular practice that has drawn our attention is the recurrent presence  of pits on cultural floors associated with cooking or disposal spaces, which  have been interpreted as part of a quotidian ritual practice. Ruales (2001)  recorded this type of practice in a compound located in the SW Area of the  settlement, while Fernandini (2015) encountered it in the domestic platforms  of the SE Ravine. Although Ruales recorded the majority of these pits in  Late Intermediate Period (ca. ad 1000–1300) contexts, a significant amount  of them are clearly associated with Cerro de Oro occupation contexts based on  their stratigraphic location and the presence of Cerro de Oro ceramics. The Cerro de Oro occupation contexts excavated revealed a pattern in which  materials seem to have been selected and placed intentionally in different  pits. We suggest that a type of organized disposal practice was performed  using specially selected material such as partial/complete animals, decorated  sherds, musical instruments, and frieze fragments, among others. For exam- ple, Unit 11 presents a series of pits with different combinations of organic  materials (e.g., human hair and a fish head). Unit 9 presents a pit with par- tial adobe bricks, organic remains, and an ocarina (a type of whistle). Unit 5  includes twelve pits filled with soil, clumps of clayish soil, fragments of white  plaster, and a piece of cloth with dark resin attached to it. Early stratigraphic  layers from Unit 18 reveal a pit that contained a complete pelican, while a  later context in Unit 23 shows a pit containing an adult guinea pig (cuy) and a  bag with unidentified non-organic white powder. Most noteworthy is a large  burning area in Unit 6, which shows successive burning events evidenced by  seven different pits or hearths (Ruales 2000). The events are labeled A–G  based on their stratigraphic location, with A the most recent finding. This  context is particularly interesting since the contents of each layer tentatively  show the remains of a large meal. Table 8.1 provides a description of these  contexts. All of these contexts seem to be intrinsically associated with the  presence of cooking and storage areas, establishing a particular link among  unconsumed, consumed, and disposed food. Likewise, the stratigraphic  record shows that this organized disposal practice was recurrent throughout  the Cerro de Oro occupation. Moreover, the size of these contexts seems to  reveal that while some of these pits show the remains of small meals, others  176 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="9"> Table 8.1. Stratigraphy of the burned contexts at Cerro de Oro Layer Description A Charcoal, partially burned shell, ceramics, and camelid bones B Very dense fill of ceramics, including the face of a figurine C Small amounts of charcoal and a large concentration of organic remains,  mollusks, and the remains of small animals D Large quantities of feathers, mollusks, and organic remains E Shells, small animal remains, different vegetal remains, and ceramic fragments F Small quantities of organic remains, which include hair, fiber strings, and  ceramic fragments G Small amounts of organic remains and some ceramic fragments H Earth-packed floor that had three pits, one with ceramic fragments and one  with organic remains; the other one was empty reflect large meals possibly associated with communal gatherings or feasts  (Fernandini 2015). Fernandini (2013) excavated a similar context on a domestic platform in the  SE Ravine (see figure 8.2) in which six different pits intruded into a thick clay  floor. These pits included small amounts of organic materials, clumps of soil,  and some ceramic fragments. Based on their paste and iconographic attributes,  these ceramic fragments have been cataloged as Cerro de Oro fine-ware. The  sherds recovered from these pits were the most finely decorated ceramics from  this platform. Similar to the contexts excavated by Ruales described above,  these pits were in close proximity to a delimited burning area that showed  successive burning events. The persistent practice of excavating pits close to cooking areas and fill- ing them with different materials has been interpreted as part of a quotidian  ceremonial practice. We suggest that this practice formed part of a routinized  domestic activity in which embedded meanings regarding the use of space  and the social practice of food consumption were recurrently reproduced in  different areas of the settlement. The rituality of this seemingly anodyne prac- tice is seen in its repetition and consistency throughout space, reflecting how  dispositions are socialized and internalized through the involvement of people  in the reproduction of their habitus (Bourdieu 1977). Moreover, the quantity of pits increases depending on the size of the cook- ing space, with large contexts such as those recorded for Unit 6 tentatively  suggesting communal feasting events. If this context in fact does represent a  communal event, then the quotidian domestic practice of pit disposal grows  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 177 </page> <page sequence="10"> in scale, becoming ingrained within a larger ritual practice. In this way the  scale of the ritual grows, yet the nature of the practice remains the same:  always establishing an inextricable relation between food and its disposal in a  recurrent and significant way. The recurrence of pits associated with possible  cooking areas has also been recorded in archaeological sites other than Cerro  de Oro. At Conchopata, an important Wari center in the Ayacucho heart- land, similar contexts were recorded in several domestic structures. Ochatoma  Paravicino and Cabrera (2000) distinguished the placement of cuys with  worked Spondylus shells in small pits within cooking or storage areas as a type  of ritual offering at the site. In addition, they reported a series of pits inside  a patio closely associated with the cooking area that were filled with burned  human and camelid bones, small figurines, obsidian knifes, and ceramic frag- ments. Rosenfeld (2012) also reported the presence of a complete young cam- elid and thirty-two complete cuys in a floor intrusion inside a cooking area in  Conchopata. Conchopata is also characterized by the presence of large-scale  and recurrent ritual ceremonies that involved sacrificing large ceramic vessels  as well as people within the sacred D-shaped temple as part of the religious  program (Isbell 2000). The presence of these two types of practices in this  important settlement is an example of the broad spectrum of ritual that ranges  from small-scale domestic practices to large-scale ceremonies. Closure and Abandonment Practices While the domestic practices mentioned above demonstrate evidence for  quotidian ceremonialism at Cerro de Oro, both Ruales (2001) and Fernandini  (2015) recorded archaeological evidence that reveals other types of ritual prac- tices. This second set of practices points to a ritual event that was recurrently  recorded in different areas of the settlement, seemingly embedded within the  process of its abandonment. Sealing practices are unique events that “prepare” spaces for their abandon- ment or reuse. The practices described below show how Cerro de Oro people  selected certain spaces of the settlement to perform a series of actions catego- rized as a “closure practice.” This preparation seems to have had the intent of  producing a deliberate, targeted, and systematic act whose main objective was  to prevent the further use of that specific space (sensu Capriata Estrada and  López-Hurtado, this volume). Based on stratigraphic analysis, it seems that the end of the early MH occu- pation at the site was marked by an intensive pluvial event. Evidence for this  climatic event has been recorded in different contexts of the SW and SE Areas.  178 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="11"> Table 8.2. Stratigraphic sequence for Unit 22W at Cerro de Oro Layer Description A LIP material culture B LIP material culture C Associated with dismantling of walls D Semi-compact layer with large amounts of human coprolites E Thin layer of sand and debris with no cultural material F Laminated clayish soil with no cultural material (40 cm) G Cerro de Oro (Early MH) material culture Based on Ruales 2001. In the SW Area this evidence has been found mainly in Unit 22W, where the  tops of the northwest and southeast walls had signs of water erosion and their  lateral surfaces showed signs of water runoff. Table 8.2 describes the sequence  of layers evidencing this major climatic event. Similarly, evidence for the atypical presence of water runoff on adobe  architecture has been found in the west sector of the compound, in Units  1, 12, and 23. These units had a very fine-grained and compact clayish layer  (20 cm thick) over the structure’s occupation floor. These sediments had  been deposited through a filtration process, evidencing the presence of large  quantities of water. Coincidently, evidence for this pluvial event could only  be found in contexts that were not part of the access routes leading to the  lower part of the settlement. This lower part has been associated with the  more consistent LIP occupation that reused earlier adobes in the construc- tion of new structural elements, such as rooms and ramps. Based on this  evidence, it can be argued that later occupations might have altered the  evidence of water erosion. Similar environmental phenomena have also been recorded in contem- poraneous settlements throughout the Peruvian central and North Coast.  For example, research at Cajamarquilla has demonstrated that settlement  construction was intrinsically related to an increment in water availability  in the Huaycoloro or the Jicamarca Quebrada (Mogrovejo and Makowski  1999). During excavations within Sector I of the Julio C. Tello architectonic  complex, Segura and Mogrovejo recorded a stratigraphic hiatus similar to  the one recorded at Cerro de Oro (Mogrovejo and Llanos 2000). This hiatus  showed clear signs of flooding temporally associated with Middle Horizon  1–style ceramics such as Chakipampa. Consequently, Narváez Luna attests  the presence of a layer composed of sandy silt covering a cultural layer with  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 179 </page> <page sequence="12"> ceramic remains pertaining to MH 1A, such as Lima 8 or 9 (Narváez Luna  2006), which he found while investigating a different sector (XI) of the Tello  complex. Tentatively, it seems that these authors date these events sometime  between MH 1A and 1B (ad 550–700). Similarly, recurrent flooding events  reveal an extremely wet period at Huaca 20 in Complejo Maranga that led to  the temporary abandonment of part of the settlement around ad 600 (Mac  Kay 2007). According to Mauricio (2011), the stratigraphic record shows clear  evidence for high precipitation rates that created flood deposits and aeolian  sand accumulation. Furthermore, Franco and Paredes (2000) present evidence  for similar contemporaneous events in Pachacamac, where they recorded thick  muddy layers over EIP occupational floors. We have interpreted the architec- tural modifications that occurred on top of these muddy layers as a shift in  cultural tradition and propose that these “heavy rains” marked the transition  between the EIP Lima occupation and the posterior Wari associated evidence. Additional evidence for a wetter than usual period between the EIP and the  MH has been recorded in several other archaeological sites along the North  Coast, such as Alto Piura, Pampa Grande, and Huacas de Moche (Dillehay  and Kolata 2004; Kaulicke 1993; Shimada et al. 1991; Uceda and Canziani 1993),  which further supports the hypothesis for an unstable climate between the end  of the EIP and the start of the MH. Moreover, paleoenvironmental records  from the Quelccaya ice cap, located in the southeastern Peruvian Andes, reveal  a particularly wet year in ad 572 followed by a wet period between ad 602 and  635 (Kaulicke 2000; Shimada et al. 1991; Thompson, Mosley-Thompson, and  Morales Arnao 1984). We see the evidence for this atypical environmental event as a temporal  marker that divided the activities associated with the abandonment of the  settlement from the actual occupation of these buildings. Within the events  that preceded the abandonment of the settlement, we recorded the recurrent  practice of dismantling architecture, filling previously used areas with the  dismounted materials as well as with other elements, and placing deceased  individuals on top of this fill (table 8.3). While excavating the compounds  placed on the main platform in the SW Area, Ruales revealed the recurrence  of this type of fill, with examples ranging in size from 160 cm to 50 cm. These  fills were composed of organic material, complete and partial adobes, broken  decorated vessels, and a higher than usual amount of decorated ceramic frag- ments. One of these contexts included the remains of two friezes (one black  and white and the other black and pale orange), while two other similar con- texts had clay blocks with leaf imprints interpreted as roof remains. These fill  contexts were constantly associated with dismounted architecture, particularly  180 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="13"> Table 8.3.

Conical adobes of thick, tall, slipped walls. Stratigraphic analysis shows that the fills were cre- ated concurrent with the dismantling and burial of preexisting structures but  before the placement of deceased individuals. The funerary contexts intruding these fill contexts had similar funerary  structures, while age, sex, and associations varied in each case. For instance, on  the headway of the main perimeter wall of the compound, Ruales recorded  five intrusive tombs that ran parallel to this wall. All of these contexts included  a rectangular or square adobe funerary structure with variable sizes that ranged  from 1 m × 1 m to 70 cm × 50 cm. Inside these structures, individuals were  placed in a fetal position with their heads close to their knees and oriented  toward the northeast. In one case, the individual had been tied with a thin  fiber rope, a diagnostic practice found in the Nasca Valley associated with  Middle Horizon tombs (Silverman and Proulx 2002). Further evidence for the dismantling of architecture, the preparation of a  closure fill, and the placement of a funerary context (table 8.4) was recorded by  Fernandini in different places within the SE Area, mainly the SE Plain and the  SE Ravine (see figure 8.2). In the SE Plain, Fernandini (2013, 2014) recorded a  fill composed of approximately 2 m of broken adobe, organic material, textile  fragments, and thousands of decorated and undecorated ceramic vessels, all  pertaining to the final phase of the Cerro de Oro occupation (Fernandini 2015;  Rodriguez 2015). Within this fill, two intrusive funerary contexts, CF06 and  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 181 </page> <page sequence="14"> Table 8.4.

CF07 was a  funerary bundle placed directly underneath CF06 and did not present a struc- ture. X-rays performed on these funerary bundles have revealed that the indi- viduals had modified elongated craniums. Likewise, CF06 revealed an uniden- tified metal object approximately 10 cm × 10 cm, recorded above the skull. Moreover, a similar context was recorded in the SE Ravine, yet this closure  practice was not intended to prepare a compound for abandonment; rather, it  was oriented toward the sealing of a domestic platform where food was pro- cessed and disposed of. Similar to the other contexts, this closure practice was  located close to structural walls. The fill recorded was 60 cm thick, covering  an area of 12 m2, and was composed of a series of complete and partial adobes  and high quantities of organic materials such as cotton, corn, beans, human  hair, and isolated adult and infant bones, including mandibles, crania, femurs,  and humeri. Over 3,000 ceramic fragments that included partial remains of at  182 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="15"> least six highly decorated vessels and hundreds of textile fragments had been  included in this fill. The textiles showed a wide range of techniques, such as  tapestry, sewing parts together, double fabric, and embroidery, among others.  Intrusive to this context was a partially complete individual with its cranium,  both femurs, and one humerus intact. The individual was found associated with  several plain ceramic fragments and an embroidered double fabric band. This  funerary context had no architecture; while no evidence of modern disturbance  was recorded, it is not clear if the human remains were placed while the flesh  was present or when only bones were placed as an offering. Very close to this  context, part of a leg and paw of a small dog was placed over a textile fragment. Taking this evidence as a whole, it seems that the dismantling of architecture,  the preparation of the fill, and the placement of intrusive funerary contexts  alongside walls demonstrate evidence of a methodically planned closure ritual.  The ritual practice of preparing these spaces for their abandonment seems to  have occurred only once yet was recurrently evidenced in different areas of  the settlement. Moreover, based on the particular contexts in which they were  recorded, it seems that the scale of these practices also varied from context to  context. While complete individuals placed in funerary adobe structures were  recorded within compounds, a partially complete individual placed directly  into the closure fill was recorded in the domestic area of the SE Ravine. This  evidence points to a practice that seems to have varied regarding the place in  which it was performed, showing that greater investment in funerary struc- tures and in the size of the fill was made in compounds, while the ritual was  reproduced at a smaller scale within the domestic SE Ravine. This varied set of closure rituals shows that while this type of practice may  have varied in size and place, its ritual nature is attested in the recurrence  as a social practice that represented the actions of a community. In a way,  the presence of this closure ritual in different parts of the settlement can be  extrapolated as a settlement-wide process that prepared the settlement and  particularly the community for the abandonment of their homes. Post-Abandonment After the structures pertaining to the Cerro de Oro occupation were aban- doned, a series of post-abandoned events was recorded in selected compounds  within the Cerro de Oro hill. Post-abandonment events at Cerro de Oro are  characterized by the construction of rectangular rooms that intrude into the  Cerro de Oro occupation. The floors of these rooms were found 2.5–3 m below  the surface. While some of the rooms lacked diagnostic material culture, the  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 183 </page> <page sequence="16"> act of constructing intrusive rooms seems to have been a recurrent practice  evidenced in different parts of the settlement. In the SW Area, PIACO  recorded several rooms with offerings, while PACO recorded three in the SE  Plain, located in the SE Area of the settlement. PIACO recorded rooms composed of four walls without any opening for  an access way. Most of these rooms had tall walls and were similar in size,  approximately 1.80 m × 1.20 m. The walls were mud-slipped and in some cases  painted white. While most of the rooms lacked diagnostic material culture,  two of them included offerings inside. The first of these rooms was painted  white and contained a camelid burial. The camelid was complete, but its cra- nium had been removed and placed backward and its legs had been switched,  placing the anterior legs in the posterior position and vice versa. The sec- ond room contained a textile bundle with attached metal plaques, which was  placed intruding into the pluvial layer mentioned above. The rest of the rooms  were excavated right next to this one, yet the only remains found in the rooms  were filled with only soil and partial adobe bricks. While no evidence of funer- ary remains was found in these rooms, they seem to have been contemporane- ous with funerary-related intrusions in the SE Plain. The rooms excavated by PACO in the SE Plain were located within one  compound associated with the Cerro de Oro occupation. Three rooms were  labeled A, C, and G based on the project’s labeling of internal divisions  within compounds. The dimensions of these rooms were Room A, 120 cm ×  80 cm; Room C, 255 cm × 1.75 cm; and Room G, 100 cm × 130 cm. Similar to  the rooms recorded by PIACO, these rooms also intruded into the Cerro de  Oro occupation’s sequence, had mud-slipped walls, and were located approxi- mately 3 m below the surface. yet unlike the rooms excavated by PIACO,  these rooms had entranceways on the northeast wall as well as a series of  niches. The entrances for the three rooms were sealed with a layer of adobe  constructed in a less polished manner, contrasting with the fine finishing of  the rest of the room. The entrance for Room C was directly connected to  three steps that descended from the top of the walls (40 cm below the mod- ern surface). This characteristic seems to point to recurrent reentering before  its closure. Furthermore, while Rooms C and G were found empty, they  record evidence that shows that they were once used as a funerary chamber  (Fernandini 2015), while Room A did present a complex funerary context  (figure 8.5). Among the evidence for their use as funerary chambers is the fact that  all of these rooms included a series of offerings directly associated with  their entrances. The offering associated with Room A was a deceased child  184 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="17"> Figure 8.5. Remains inside Room A  approximately 9–10 years of age (Boza, personal communication, 2013) placed  in front of the room’s entrance, on top of a Cerro de Oro occupational floor that  had been broken during construction of the room. The offering for Room C  consisted of a spinster’s spade, a metal ax, and a knitted bag filled with forty  camelid gallstones. Finally, the offering for Room G was a young camelid  placed directly on top of the bedrock in front of the entrance. Further evi- dence for the use of these chambers as funerary structures is found in the pres- ence of small fragments of tapestries similar to those found associated with  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 185 </page> <page sequence="18"> the funerary bundle in Room A. It seems that at some point in time these  contexts were intruded and their contexts removed, leaving only traces of their  remains in Rooms C and G and leaving a false bundle in Room A. When we performed excavations in Room A, the bundle we recorded  only contained soil, yet a reconstruction process performed after analyzing  the context in the lab has shown that this bundle originally contained an  individual (the imprints of its head and the remains from tissue decomposi- tion are clear in the textiles used to wrap him or her). This individual was  wrapped in a bundle with twenty-nine textiles; the final layer was an unku  (tunic). Moreover, based on the analysis of the associated remains found in  the context, we propose that this bundle had a false head, a turban, and a wig.  In association with this bundle were over 200 objects, most of them placed  in reed baskets. The most noteworthy funerary associations were (figure 8.6): A four-point hat made using knotted technique (figure 8.6a) A square hat made using knotted technique (figure 8.6b) A braided wig made of human hair (figure 8.6c) A pair of wooden ear pieces showing an anthropomorphic figure  (figure 8.6d) A pair of miniature leather sandals (figure 8.6e) A wooden feline figurine (figure 8.6f ) A tie-dye textile (figure 8.6g) Based on the materials associated with the funerary context in Room A and  the textile fragments from Rooms C and G, we have interpreted these rooms  as belonging to the later part of the Middle Horizon, or MH2, and the objects  particularly associated with Wari society. While only contexts in the SE Plain  present clear diagnostic material culture, the similarity in construction tech- niques and their stratigraphic location with contexts in the SW Area signal all  of these contexts as pertaining to this period. Moreover, evidence for intrusive funerary contexts has also been recorded  in the nearby Huaca Malena (Ángeles Falcón and Pozzi-Escot 2000), as well  as several examples from the Central Coast (Flores Espinoza 2005, 2013). All  of these burials also intruded into abandoned settlements and present Wari- affiliated elements. Thus, the recurrence of these contexts points to the repeti- tive practice of intruding previous settlements to place their deceased. The  common denominator within this recurrent practice is that all of these intru- sive burials present Wari elements—some exclusively (as was the case at Cerro  186 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="19"> Figure 8.6. Composition of funerary associations found inside Room A at Cerro de Oro  de Oro) and others within a wider range of foreign and local objects (as is the  case at Huaca Malena [Ángeles Falcón and Pozzi-Escot 2000]). Given that residential settlements for this period do not show evidence of  Wari presence, we propose that this practice of using abandoned settlements  A VIEW OF DAILy AND CEREMONIAL PRACTICES FROM CERRO DE ORO 187 </page> <page sequence="20"> to inter the dead with foreign emblematic objects can be considered a local  attempt to reappropriate abandoned yet once-important settlements. Thus,  this repetitive practice would be revealing a local reformulation of the social  landscape. In this context the ritualistic nature of these practices can be seen  in their recurrence throughout the area, showing that certain ritual disposi- tions can be shared and reproduced within larger contexts. In this sense, as  this practice is reproduced in different areas of the South-Central and Central  Coast, the dispositions of a regional shared ritual practice seem to have been  reformulated within particular historical trajectories. discussion This study has focused on describing and analyzing a different set of prac- tices with the objective of showing the permeable boundaries between the  mundane and the eventful. While moving away from the dualistic perspective  that segregates ritual from daily activities, we have presented a series of exam- ples in which the nature of ritual is centered in the way social dispositions and  meanings are embedded within repetitive practices. In this way we have shown how the recurrent disposal of elements in a selec- tive way can be considered a ritual practice in which individuals are socialized  into a practice particularly linked to the consumption and disposal of food.  Moreover, this simple yet meaningful practice of disposing has been recorded  in different scales, from disposing the refuse of small-scale meals to discard- ing the remains from repetitive communal gatherings. However, the contexts  show that regardless of the size, the rituality of the practice is evidenced in its  repetitive nature as a disposition that becomes embedded in the way people do  things throughout time, thus ritualizing everyday social action. Moreover, evidence associated with closure practices shows that this was a  ritual process, which seems to have been performed as a way to prepare the  settlement for its abandonment. While this practice seems to have selected  only particular spaces for sealing and invested more in compounds than in  domestic platforms, the practice in itself seems to have involved the commu- nity in a consistent process of abandonment. This process prepared both the  settlement and the community for abandonment. In this sense the ritualistic  nature of this practice is evidenced in the way these repetitive actions instilled  a particular reality into the population, integrating them in the process of  reproducing the closing of a life cycle. Finally, the final set of ritual practices focuses on the intrusive placement  of burials dressed with foreign objects in the abandoned settlement Cerro  188 FRANCESCA FERNANDINI AND MARIO RUALES </page> <page sequence="21"> de Oro. These burials were placed with a clear notion of where previous  rooms within the compound were located, establishing a possible connection  between the present action and the building’s past. Moreover, this practice has  also been recorded in other settlements on the South-Central and Central  Coasts, reflecting that it was a seemingly shared practice. We propose that this  recurrent practice reflects the ritual appropriation of abandoned settlements  by local populations. Following this line, this recurrent ritual can be seen as  an example for the large-scale reproduction of social dispositions through the  enactment of a shared practice. In sum, evidence from Cerro de Oro has been used to present a multi- scalar approach that understands ritual practices through the repetitive actions  that produce and reproduce social practices within a community. This view  explores the ways rituals socialize people into particular dispositions. These  dispositions can range from a community ́s reproduction of meanings estab- lished by the link between people, food and disposal practices, involved in  the abandonment of their homes, to the shared practice of reappropriating  abandoned settlements. conclusion In conclusion, this chapter has attempted to explore the wide spectrum of  ritual practices that took place in the settlement Cerro de Oro. This multi- scalar analysis has shown that the nature of ritual does not lie in the scale  of the practice or in the role of its actors; rather, it can be found in the way  its occurrence and recurrence instills a series of social meanings among the  people who participate in the rituals. In this sense, analyzing rituals through  their practice allows us to grasp often elusive meanings regarding a society’s  social orderings and actions. In this way the analysis of ritual practices at Cerro de Oro has allowed us  to introduce ourselves into the social context of the settlement, where we can  follow the ways people produced and reproduced their own social dispositions  through their participation. Thus, an exploration of the way people related to  food and its disposal, how they internalized their own process of abandon- ment or the shared processes that occurred after abandonment can lead to an  understanding of how people were involved in these practices. Thus, a focus on  the ritualized actions people do every day and their involvement in grand rit- ual ceremonies allows us to enter the realm of the archaeologically intangible.
