<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Comedy, Capitalism, and  a Loss of Gravity Alan Ackerman Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he  would say that gravity was an errant scoun- drel; and he would add,—of the most  dangerous kind too—because a sly one;  and that, he verily believed, more honest,  well-meaning people were bubbled out of  their goods and money by it in one twelve- month, than by pocket-picking and shop- lifting in seven. —Laurence Sterne, The Life and  Opinions of Tristram Shandy In 1932, the American economy plunged to its lowest point. Stock  prices fell to 20 percent of their 1929 value, a quarter of a million  families lost their homes, and Fleischer Studios,1 with Paramount  Pictures, released Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs, an animated short  that dramatized the housing foreclosure crisis. I want to use the  movie to make four basic points: (1) that the idiom of gravity and  levity points to meaningful connections between comedy and capi- talism; (2) that we should regard capitalism with a comic “attitude  toward history”; (3) that studies of comedy and of capitalism often,   Discourse, 36.2, Spring 2014, pp. 139–175.

These may seem to be excessive claims for an obscure  Betty Boop short, but another crucial idea underlying my analysis  is that the Fleischer brothers’ films—and this one in particular— merit such critical attention not only because of the brilliance and  insight with which they illuminated their own moment, circa 1932,  but also because of the light they can shed on ours. Betty Boop, a popular animated figure in the early years of  the Great Depression, has staged a triumphant return, through  merchandising, in our own day. Among relevant points of compari- son between the Fleischers’ moment and ours are the following:  In the economic crises of both the 1930s and the 2000s, housing  bubbles led to epidemics of foreclosures and evictions as inflated  asset prices induced a crash of debt and equity markets. Betty, from  the Fleischers’ day to ours, has been an icon of consumerism, a  floating signifier of desire. At the same time, technological inno- vations gave rise to experiments in new narrative media (motion  picture technologies in particular) with new ways of imagining the  material planet and our relation to it. New forms of art occasioned  new imaginary states of nature and new ways of being in the world.  Furthermore, dramatic demographic changes internationally, the  pressure of refugees on the American rhetoric of freedom, and  anxiety about borders provoked major debates on national iden- tity and immigration. A vital consequence of mass migration and  urbanization then and now has been to draw heightened attention  to the ethics and aesthetics of cosmopolitanism or global citizen- ship, which has pictured the globe as home to all creatures but also  as being degraded by capitalism, human industry, and mass society.  Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs, as I aim to show, is an important work  of modernist art that sheds light on these historical developments.  The film dramatizes homelessness in terms of an Earth at risk. A  close analysis of the film can therefore also contribute meaning- fully to the current eco-critical conversation. In my reading, Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs becomes an urtext of  what Ursula Heise calls “eco-cosmopolitanism” and an allegory of  de-territorialized, environmental world citizenship. Heise argues  that ecologically oriented thinking needs to come to terms with  the connectedness of societies around the world and, by extension,  with “the emergence of new forms of culture that are no longer  anchored in place.”2 In contrast to the anticapitalist, often antiglo- balization bias of much environmental rhetoric, the Fleischer film  </page> <page sequence="3"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 141 participates in the global economy that it also depicts as comic. The  film both critiques excessive investment in the local and celebrates  its own extraordinarily innovate narrative art, in surrealist imagery  and jazz music, using technology not simply as a means to an end  but as a revelation of a new way of being in the world. The film’s  comic themes of rebirth and qualified liberation give the work  a traditional comic structure. The plot centers on adaptation to  new—though by no means ideal or ever purely “natural”—environ- ments. The representation of Betty’s ups and downs enables a new  model of the local, or what it means to be at home. She becomes a  global citizen, an achievement that seems to promise happiness.  Like trees (chopped up rather than down), Betty is uprooted, yet  that dislocation leads to a new sense of place and specifically to a  new sense of the value of the Earth. Rejecting the pastoral fantasy  in which Disney indulged starting with shorts such as Flowers and  Trees (also 1932), the technologically sophisticated Betty Boop’s Ups  and Downs celebrates the creative destructive dynamic of capital- ism while orienting its artistic experimentation to encompass the  nonhuman world. Betty Goes Global Could we have a progressive ecology that was big, not small; spacious,  not place-ist; global, not local (if not universal); not embodied but dis- placed, spaced, outer spaced? Our slogan should be dislocation, disloca- tion, dislocation. —Timothy Morton, The Ecological Thought  At the beginning of the seven-minute film, Betty is evicted from her  rustic home, which has a large “For Sale” sign on a stake driven into  the yard.3 She emerges from the front door with a sigh. Tears fall  from her eyes, and she sings of displacement: “I can’t find a regular  place that I can call my own” and “There’s no place upon this Earth  that’s home sweet home to me.” Betty departs with her boyfriend,  the dog-eared Bimbo, in a cart drawn by an accommodating horse  to the sobs of barnyard animals. In 1932, the horse-drawn carriage  would have seemed nearly as antiquated as the horse’s chivalry  as he steps out of harness to seat Betty, bowing and covering his  eyes so as not to see up her skirt. Horsepower had given way to  automobiles. A cow, milked by a cat, consumes bottle after bottle  of its own milk, suggesting a depressingly unprofitable cycle—a  structural problem resulting in part from improved agricultural  technologies and made worse by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of  </page> <page sequence="4"> 142 Alan Ackerman 1930. In addition to signing the protectionist tariff into law, Presi- dent Herbert Hoover had sought to stabilize agricultural prices  by extending government loans to farmers, but the subsidies only  encouraged them to grow more, exacerbating surpluses and fur- ther depressing prices. In New York state, as the Fleischers’ allegory  illustrates, the dairy industry was the worst affected, with a surplus  of milk running from three hundred thousand quarts in mid-Sep- tember to a million in the summer months.4 Market imperatives, in  short, govern not only real estate but also food production. In Betty  Boop’s Ups and Downs, the vacant, anthropomorphic house starts to  collapse and to repair itself very imperfectly. It disintegrates piece  by piece: a rain gutter falls off, then the porch roof falls off, and  so on. The chimney reaches over to pull the items back into place,  more or less, until it too collapses in despair. The asking price on  the sign drops with each bit that falls: $10,000, $8,000, $4,000, and  finally “Or what have you?” The camera pulls back—or this is the conceit—to show that all  of the houses in town have “For Sale” signs and then pulls back fur- ther to show the continent and finally the whole world “For Sale”  (figure 1). In outer space, beyond the pull of gravity, the Moon  puts the Earth up for auction. By 1932, the Great Depression had  become a global crisis. The auctioneer Moon urges the other heav- enly bodies “Step right up, step right up” and sings “How much  is this big ball worth?” to the tune of “London Bridge Is Falling  Down.” The planets start bidding. Bristly Mars offers “$50,” and  lovely Venus, a flapper, squeaks “$40,” the bids falling rather than  rising in this topsy-turvy universe until, with a Yiddish-inflected  “tventy,” Saturn buys the Earth (figure 2). The lowest bidder gains  the cheapened plant. Muttering under his breath that the Moon is  a “gonif” (crook), Saturn rubs his hands together before handing  over a bag of coins. With his accent and his bulbous nose, Saturn is  a stock theatrical Jew and a mischief maker. The planetary shyster is  also a surrogate for the artist Max Fleischer, himself a Galician Jew,  an émigré born in Kraków to a violin-playing tailor who continued  to move the family, once in America, from one New York apart- ment to the next. Max was the head of Fleischer Studios, while  brothers Dave, Charlie, Joe, and Lou contributed their particular  talents, whether directorial, mechanical, electrical, or musical. The  anti-Semitic caricature, which here resembles a photograph of the  Fleischers’ own father, becomes a source not of gravity but of lev- ity, of fun and of creativity, both bound by and liberated from the  weight of history. This provocative image of the Jew at the nexus of comedy and  capitalism in 1932, while drawing upon the virulent cartoons of  </page> <page sequence="5"> Figure 1.

Saturn buys the Earth in Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs. </page> <page sequence="6"> 144 Alan Ackerman Nazi tabloids such as Der Stürmer, among other anti-Jewish publi- cations of the time, and evoking stories of peasants driven from  their farms by Jewish financiers, makes a curious intervention into  debates about what we now call globalization. Numerous editions  of the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fabricated docu- ment that was supposed to evidence a Jewish conspiracy to take  over the world, used similar images (figure 3). Henry Ford, who  funded the printing of five hundred thousand copies of the Proto- cols in the early 1920s, published a series of articles under the title  “The International Jew: The World’s Problem,” with a section on  “Land-Grabbing” Jews, in his newspaper the Dearborn Independent.  American nativism had flared with World War I and the Bolshevik  Revolution and culminated in the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act  of 1924, which put an end to the third great wave of U.S. immigra- tion that began in 1881 and brought more than twenty-three mil- lion immigrants, many of them Eastern European Jews such as the  Fleischers, to American shores. Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs interrogates attachments to different  kinds of space, drawing our attention frame by frame (and so, to  the very technique of framing) from the local to the regional to the  national and then on to the continental, the global, and the univer- sal. In doing so, the film questions—but doesn’t entirely subvert— a nation-based sense of identity and also suggests countermodels  of territorialization. Skeptical of rootedness, the film nonetheless  insists on the value not only of place but also of the Earth itself. In  this animated short, the Fleischers offer a practical, paradoxically  land-based response to the appropriation of Romantic symbols of  connection to the Earth as a source of identity, whether National  Socialist or American nativist, in the 1930s. Identity, as the film  implies, derives from relations to various kinds of space. Max Fleischer—one of the medium’s great early innovators  and the inventor of the rotoscope, a machine that enabled the art- ist to trace over film footage frame by frame—often inserted him- self in live-action scenes as Betty’s “Uncle Max,” drawing characters  such as Betty out of the inkwell. Fleischer had started exploring this  conceit in the Out of the Inkwell series with Koko the Clown in 1919.  The Fleischer persona, though Max was not the sole creator of the  films (and the studio employed hundreds of animators), appears  throughout these works as a quick-sketch artist, drawing the clown  who then rebels against the artist’s control. But as Michael North  points out in his fascinating analysis of the 1924 short Cartoon Fac- tory, “Max is just as much an animation as the drawings he seems  to create,” as Fleischer’s hand would move mechanically across a  drawing that had already been photographed and traced and then  </page> <page sequence="7"> Figure 3. Protocols of the Elders of Zion (English ed., n.d.; French ed., 1934). </page> <page sequence="8"> 146 Alan Ackerman would be gradually exposed to the camera. So, North writes, “the  clown’s actions . . . directed his creator’s and not vice versa.”5 In  their combination of animation and live action, the Out of the Ink- well shorts reflect on their own contribution to the evolution of  film technology; they raise questions about the ontology of the art- ist and the dialectic of freedom and constraint, which is a central  theme of this and the later work. Uncle Max does not appear in Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs, at  least not as a photographic image of Max Fleischer. This animated  film, cut free from an indexical relation to the real world—that is,  lacking a photographic trace of that external material reality—cel- ebrates artistic creativity in new media and new environments while  emphasizing the necessity of constraint on figures that otherwise  appear completely unconstrained. There is no reason that an ani- mated Betty or an animated Saturn need conform to the laws of  gravity, yet these figures must appear in consistent and recogniz- able environments, and drawing a new world, frame by frame, was a  hopelessly inefficient and wasteful production process. The realism  of animated films privileges coherence over correspondence to an  external reality. The approach of artist-inventors such as Fleischer  to the challenge of making animated films more lifelike reflects  their approach to a problem of necessity in finding ways to allow  the environment to work for them in the interest of efficiency;  this economical approach is typified by the development of cel- based animation, which retains the background environment on  one sheet of celluloid while characters move on other transpar- ent sheets that are superimposed on the first. Their trunks, limbs,  extremities, and even facial features, such as mouth or tongue,  may be drawn on different layers. This formal technique, layering  morphological figures and environments, enabled the animators  to specialize. The same cels could be recycled. In Betty Boop’s Ups  and Downs, the dynamic between novelty and naturalization is also  a major thematic concern, as Betty must leave the wasteful farm  and adapt to new habitats.6 The need to reduce waste in order to  speed up the animation process suggests, curiously enough, a way  that the new medium may serve as a model of adaptation in both  a technological and evolutionary sense (Fleischer’s thinking was  deeply influenced by Darwin), which acknowledges that human  experience of nature is never unmediated. As characters change,  the environment remains a vibrant yet continuous basis (at least  for extended segments) that also permeates the forms that appear  within it. Thematically, this film shows that self-constraint is the  ultimate expression of freedom; the resilience of both Betty Boop  and the planet will depend on it. </page> <page sequence="9"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 147 In Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs, it is the animated Saturn who  performs the central creative act that draws attention to the  power and limitation of the artist, particularly as it relates to the  mechanics of motion, not only in delightful business of the mov- ing pictures but also, here, in a much larger Newtonian or plan- etary sense. Saturn removes gravity from the Earth and thereby  produces an extended surrealist segment. “I’ll pull gravity out of  the vay,” he croons, “and see vat happens.” Then he draws a mas- sive “Earth’s Magnet” on a rope from the center of the planet,  releasing trees, houses, trains, and people from the Earth’s sur- face. Pairs of animals march off the peak of a mountain into the  sky, followed by Betty and Bimbo with their horse and cart. Like  the Flood, this cataclysm will allow for new beginnings. Betty, who  leaves the wagon in midair to pursue her belongings, which have  floated out of the back, takes to walking on her hands, upside  down in the sky, to keep her skirt “down,” barely, over her knickers  and garter. Saturn’s trick makes rain fall up rather than down. But  the life in the sky is neither a simple reversal of life on Earth nor  a free-for-all. The film asks the viewer to imagine relationships to  different environments, how particular environments literally and  figuratively work for us and which are best suited to human habita- tion. Floating free of Earth’s surface, people still manage to set up  house and hang the laundry out to dry. They manifest no anxiety,  though they are literally unbound. Urging the planets to “hitch your wagon to a star,” the Moon  cites Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay “American Civilization,” which  imagines a dynamic collaboration between economic and natural  forces. In Emerson’s animated universe, factories reach out their  arms to nature and vice versa: I admire still more than the saw-mill the skill which, on the sea-shore,  makes the tides drive the wheels and grind corn, and which thus embraces  the assistance of the moon, like a hired band, to grind, and wind, and  pump, and saw, and split stone, and roll iron. Now that is the wisdom of a man, in every instance of his labor, to  hitch his wagon to a star, and see his chore done by the gods themselves.  That is the way we are strong, by borrowing the might of the elements.  The forces of steam, gravity, galvanism, light, magnets, wind, fire, serve us  day by day, and cost us nothing.7 The resources of Emerson’s Earth seemed limitless; today we are  realizing that the costs of steam and fire anyway have been sub- stantial. Nevertheless, his vision of a burgeoning economy compre- hends a partnership between human imagination and the physical  </page> <page sequence="10"> 148 Alan Ackerman universe of wind and solar power. It is a relation not of exploitation  but of reciprocity: borrowing rather than taking. In an animated  as in a transcendentalist universe, gravity, like wind and light, may  be empathetic to human striving. Spirit is integral to matter. Like  Emerson, Fleischer dares to suggest that the pathetic fallacy may  not be a fallacy after all. Although the opening of Betty Boop’s Ups  and Downs illustrates a destructive manifestation of gravity as the  house collapses, in the end the Earth reaches up to restore the  magnetic field that extends from its interior to the upper atmo- sphere. As at the conclusion of a Shakespearean comedy, nature  reasserts a course that again can serve human interests, provided  that humans have learned to moderate their desires. Betty Boop’s  Ups and Downs depicts a comic renewal, like that of A Midsummer  Night’s Dream, in which rivers that had “overborne their continents”  and the ox that “had stretch’d his yoke in vain” resume their right- ful places. Shakespeare’s couples consent to love within bounds,  and “Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.” In Betty Boop’s  Ups and Downs, gravity returns and with it the rain—an image of  springtime—and all creatures come back to their natural home,  the Earth. This kinetic materialism of Shakespeare, Emerson, and  Fleischer might continue to serve as a useful model for connections  between people, planets, and profit, as the energy in the Earth and  sun and wind is not something to be extracted but instead is some- thing to be employed, the comic spirit being implicit in the notion  of renewables. In the film, the loss of gravity cuts loose a swinging jazz  soundtrack, with a syncopated solo improvised on the double bass  followed by improvisations on the clarinet and trumpet, each one  highly individualistic and full of rhythmic surprises. But then, the  Earth reaches up a hand to grab the magnet that has attached  itself to Saturn’s behind, allowing Saturn to stop his manic orbit- ing of the planet and to spin back off into space where he belongs.  Rain, houses, trees, animals, cars, and even the continent of North  America, which has somehow become an elephant, fall back to  Earth (the cartoon elephant, a ubiquitous political symbol in  October 1932 when the film was released, anticipates Republican  President Herbert Hoover’s fall in the election one month later as  well as Franklin Roosevelt’s “landslide” win and New Deal). And  so does Betty, who manages a soft landing on a blanket and pillow,  followed by one house or building after another over her. Then,  shooting up through them all, this time by the rational mechanics  of an electric elevator, she emerges from the elevator doors at the  top with a ding and sings “Any old place upon this Earth is home  sweet home to me!” </page> <page sequence="11"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 149 The ending is both happy and down to earth. Betty’s epiph- any discovers the possibility of happiness and home not simply in  her own backyard, like Dorothy in Kansas, but any place on this  Earth. She ends up not in the country but instead in the city— and a renewed “New World.” In the film’s system of images, down- ward movement—even into the Earth, which is where the magnet  returns—suggests the dying of the old world and the birth or rejuve- nation of a new. The image of the magnet’s return is one of burial,  but rather than bringing back the tears of the opening, the conclu- sion shows that Betty has found a greater prize than the one she  lost. The film ultimately eschews a conservative model of nature as  wilderness or old-fashioned farm that one can simply possess and  offers a reality that evolves with technology and within which every  creature must improvise. The music of the spheres in Fleischer’s  universe is jazz. Resurrected from the crush of buildings, Betty  pushes her head through the elevator doors, as if from the birth  canal, realigned joyfully between planet and heavens, concrete and  abstract, dramatizing a new deal as much as a finale. Roosevelt, the  self-declared standard-bearer “of liberalism and of progress and at  the same time of safety to our institutions,” pledged “a new deal  for the American people” at the Democratic National Convention  of 1932. Urging citizens to think beyond local concerns, the candi- date envisioned “not merely a Nation of independence” but also “if  we are to survive . . . a Nation of interdependence.” Roosevelt’s pro- gram of public works involved reforestation, land reclamation, and  perhaps the most famous harnessing of gravity for human use, the  Hoover Dam (though construction had begun in 1931). “Out of  every crisis, every tribulation, every disaster,” Roosevelt concluded,  “mankind rises with some share of greater knowledge, of higher  decency, of purer purpose.”8 Thus, the happy end of comedy takes  us from the brink of tragedy to social reintegration; it is not merely  a return to the status quo but rebirth to a brave, new world. Comic and Capitalist Poetics The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven . . . —William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream The surrealist device in Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs of turning  figurative ups and downs into literal ones illustrates two basic ideas.  First, it conveys a vertiginous sense of the economic times, the dis- orienting quality of capitalism’s creative-destructive dynamic. The  </page> <page sequence="12"> 150 Alan Ackerman culture of capitalism is weightless and ephemeral. “All that is solid  melts into air,” wrote Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in The Com- munist Manifesto, quoting Prospero’s description of the “insubstan- tial pageant” he creates for Miranda and Ferdinand in The Tempest:  “These our Actors . . . were all Spirits, and / Are melted into Air.”9  The air is as substantial as the pen-and-ink figures that rise and fall  in it—kineticism represented by lines of ink drawn into the sup- posed air in the footage of the film, frame by frame, creating a vivid  impression of force and motion. To melt solid things you need a  dissolving agent, just as, according to Isaac Newton, you need force  to change an object’s motion. Here, the impersonal force of capi- talism evicts Betty from her house, the Moon from its orbit, and the  Earth from its axis. In capitalism, economist Joseph Schumpeter suggested, “there  are prolonged periods of rising and of falling prices, interest rates,  employment and so on, which phenomena constitute parts of the  mechanism of this process of recurrent rejuvenation of the pro- ductive apparatus.”10 The gravitational idiom is essential to our  understanding of modern economics. Rising and falling are sim- ply manifestations of the invisible force that we observe operating  in relations between, proportionally speaking, extremely small  and extremely large objects, such as people and planets. Under- standing gravity enables us, as Newton wrote, to deduce “the forces  which keep the Planets in their Orbs.”11 Analogously, economists  have deduced laws for the movement of commodities within soci- ety, or of exchange relations between products. As Marx writes of  the “General Law of Capitalist Accumulation,” “Just as the heav- enly bodies always repeat a certain movement, once they have been  flung into it, so also does social production, once it has been flung  into this movement of alternative expansion and contraction.”12  The analogy in Capital seems a précis for the Fleischers’ film: “In  the same way, the law of gravity asserts itself when a person’s house  collapses on top of him.”13 More recently, in his book Freefall: Amer- ica, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy, Joseph Stiglitz  has written: In October 2008 America’s economy was in freefall, poised to take down  much of the world economy with it. We had stock market crashes, credit  crunches, housing slumps, and inventory adjustments before. But not  since the Great Depression had all of these come together. . . . But while  everything seemed to be falling apart at the same time, there was a com- mon source: the reckless lending of the financial sector, which had fed  the housing bubble, which eventually burst. . . . Such bubbles and their  aftermath are as old as capitalism and banking itself.14 </page> <page sequence="13"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 151 A poet could not provide a more richly metaphorical description of  the material consequences of the forces unleashed upon our world  by surplus capital. Then again, it is through poetics (literally “mak- ing”) that human beings discover a way of being at home on the  Earth. Poetics and economics, however, would seem to involve mak- ing of very different kinds; the former connotes the lofty heights of  the sublime, while the latter focuses on the nitty-gritty of everyday  life. In “. . . Poetically Man Dwells . . . ,” for example, an essay on the  romantic poet Friedrich Hölderlin, Martin Heidegger assumes this  opposition but provocatively inverts it. He suggests that poetry, not  economics, brings us down to earth: “poetry does not fly above and  surmount the earth in order to escape it and hover over it. Poetry is  what first brings man onto the earth, making him belong to it, and  thus brings him into dwelling.”15 Responding to a housing crisis in postwar Germany, Heidegger  couches his argument in an explicitly anticapitalist (arguably anti- Jewish) distrust of business and other forms of calculation or  instrumentalist thought. Yet as he acknowledges, his key distinction  between calculation and meditation is not absolute (e.g., “To write  poetry is measure-taking”),16 and all men, not only poets, have the  capacity to “dwell poetically.”17 Ultimately, the fact that poetics may  be a form of economics—and vice versa—is suggested not only by  the housing crisis that informs his argument but also by the con- straints on human dwelling, within the fluid temporal-spatial envi- ronment of the Earth, that are his subject. Schumpeter, who coined  the phrase “creative destruction” and viewed capitalism as an “evo- lutionary process,” added that it is “a form or method of economic  change and not only never is but never can be stationary.”18 So,  we think of our economy in poetic terms that emphasize irregular  motion, particularly ups and downs, generated by the application  of force. But this observation leads to the more challenging prob- lem of framing our tendency to burst into metaphor. How might  we comprehend the significance of the specific gravitational meta- phors they (and we) use by situating them in a particular narrative  mode or genre? These metaphorical ups and downs, crashes and slumps,  crunches and bursting bubbles assume that everyday life takes  the form of symbolic action, by which I mean that these terms  don’t just indicate random motion, whether up, down, or side- ways, but, as terms of action, imply agency and purpose. Here I  am paraphrasing Depression-era rhetorician Kenneth Burke. In  A Grammar of Motives (1945), Burke coined the term “dramatism”  to describe his study of human motives: “Being developed from  the analysis of drama, [the dramatistic method] treats language  </page> <page sequence="14"> 152 Alan Ackerman and thought primarily as modes of action.”19 Of course, there are  diverse kinds of drama, and Burke suggested that we tend to con- front the particular circumstances, conditions, and persons of our  times through what he called particular “attitudes toward history,”  and “saturating the lot,” he adds, “is the attitude of attitudes which  we call the ‘comic frame,’ the methodic view of human antics as  a comedy, albeit as a comedy ever on the verge of the most disas- trous tragedy.”20 I want to suggest that the structure of capitalist  symbolism, insofar as a process of endless creative destruction  has a structure, is best understood in a comic frame. As Burke  well knew, Marx in his critique of Hegel had already suggested  such a way of viewing historical processes: “History is thorough  and goes through many phases when carrying an old form to the  grave. The last phase of a world-historical form is its comedy. . .  . Why this course of history? So that humanity should part with  its past cheerfully.”21 Marx’s dialectical point is sarcastic, paradoxi- cally looking back, his own rhetoric less comic than melodramatic.  He expressed it more succinctly in “The Eighteenth Brumaire of  Louis Bonaparte”: “Hegel remarks somewhere that all world-his- torical facts and personages of great importance in world history  occur, as it were, twice. He had forgotten to add: the first time as  tragedy, the second as farce.”22 History has form, and the form  matters because, as Marx says, while men make their own history,  they do not make it just as they please but under circumstances  given and transmitted from the past. In his 1966 study Modern Tragedy, the Marxian Raymond Wil- liams nonetheless defined classical liberalism as an irremediably  tragic political outlook.23 In the self-interested individualism of  Ibsen’s protagonists, for instance, and the ideology of the free mar- ket, Williams found guilt, debt, self-victimization, and alienation.  He did not think that expanding markets generated freedom, and  he used the term “liberal tragedy” for dramas of middle-class life  that depict the loss of human connection at anything more than  a private level. Around the same time, ecologist Garrett Hardin  found alienation not only between human beings but also between  people and the land. He argued in “The Tragedy of the Commons”  that the universal yet placeless market was contributing to the deg- radation of fisheries and forests, directing us to think about the  real costs of doing business, the construction of value, and how  to balance a local habitation with a commitment to our common  Earth.24 Williams’s and Hardin’s critiques of the thinning bonds  of sociality in an era of liberal self-interest deserves much further  attention. More than ever, it can seem that we are on the verge of  the most disastrous tragedy. </page> <page sequence="15"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 153 Nonetheless, in what follows I want to reconsider the genre of  economic and philosophical liberalism by charting an alternative  genealogy of modernity in which individual economic enfranchise- ment and its dramatic representation might be imagined as comic  and liberating, writ small in Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs. Connection  to the land can be a version of the extensive social awareness that a  healthy capitalism demands. Performed in cities, comedy has long  been associated with the country and with fertility of both land  and people, whether in the festivals celebrated in ancient Athens,  the Roman Saturnalia that centered on the god of agriculture, or  Shakespeare’s Arden. Comedy’s depiction of the temporary break- down of authority in a putative state of nature was supposed to  serve the commons, or to restore common sense in relation to what  always imperfect, fractious communities share. In 1932 Franklin  Roosevelt conflated “common sense and business sense” in propos- ing a national land policy: “We know that a very hopeful and imme- diate means of relief, both for the unemployed and for agriculture,  will come from a wide plan of the converting of many millions of  acres of marginal and unused land into timberland through refor- estation.”25 Roosevelt’s liberalism does not look back to a utopian  nature untouched, like the “untrodden wilderness” Theodore Roo- sevelt imagined in Ranch Life and the Hunting-Trail, but instead pro- poses an escape from poverty through the Civilian Conservation  Corps. The project is not local, though it began for Franklin Roos- evelt at home in Hyde Park, where he started an annual replanting  regimen in 1912 that he continued until his death in 1945. Rather,  as he further explained, the project is national and even interna- tional, as it was to be modeled on European land policies.26 The comic-liberal worldview that I attribute to Franklin Roo- sevelt and the Fleischers stands in direct contrast to another  approach, nominally more serious and openly antimodern, to the  environment and to art, a view that sees technology at odds with  both. That model of ecological thought regards human industry as  radically opposed to an idea of nature that is undisturbed and fixed  in place. It calls for local knowledge and rejects cosmopolitanism.  It favors continuity rather than change. The Fleischers’ slight-seem- ing film resists the nostalgic sense that “the loss of the organic com- munity was the loss of a human naturalness or normality . . . in the  building of the industrial era,” as F. R. Leavis and Denys Thompson  put it in their 1933 book Culture and Environment.27 The Fleischers  weren’t going back to eastern Europe in 1932, nor was Betty going  back to the farm. There is, of course, much to sympathize with in  Leavis and Thompson’s hatred of the suburbs and mass culture, but  the pursuit of economic success (whether measured by increasing  </page> <page sequence="16"> 154 Alan Ackerman the gross national product, corporate profits, or personal enrich- ment) ought to return us to questions about the pursuit of hap- piness, enshrined as an inalienable right in the Declaration of  Independence. On the one hand, there is no going back to a state  of “human naturalness,” assuming it ever existed. On the other  hand, as economist Angus Deaton comments (paraphrasing Adam  Smith), although wealth cannot make us happy, the illusion that it  can has been a useful one, “which rouses and keeps in perpetual  motion the industry of mankind.” Without discounting the ravages  of capitalism and problems of inequality, Deaton argues that “eco- nomic growth has propelled millions of people out of awful destitu- tion.” His title refers to “man’s unquenchable desire for freedom.”  The world has done “much better than the pessimists predicted,”  Deaton claims.28 The tragedy of the commons is not a foregone  conclusion. Yet progress must be guided by constraints on hyper- individualism, and the goal of efficiency must be balanced with  the well-being of people and the planet. These subjects are funda- mental to both early writings about capitalism and the structure of  comedy, and they have returned to the forefront of economic and  environmentalist discourses. I think that we make a mistake in regarding capitalism as  either tragic in Williams’s sense or comic in Marx’s dark sense of  gallows humor or the dehumanizing terms of farce. In The Prot- estant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Max Weber cautioned that  whether regarding Benjamin Franklin’s professional success or  Christian’s rise from the farm to the Celestial City in Pilgrim’s Prog- ress, the Protestant ethos that he found essential to the develop- ment of capitalism is neither funny nor fun: “the spirit of hard  work, of progress, or whatever else it may be called, the awakening  of which one is inclined to ascribe to Protestantism, must not be  understood, as there is a tendency to do, as joy of living.”29 North  says that modernity is “governed by a comic rhythm, even when it  is not particularly amusing.”30 Yet comedy, as I wish to understand  it, is, like liberal economics, about the pursuit of happiness; it is  life-affirming and potentially joyful. And capitalism has produced  levels of prosperity that have increased human happiness, or they  did, up to a point. Happiness has long been a preoccupation of  the dismal science. The 2002 neoutilitarian book Well-Being: Foun- dations of Hedonic Psychology by Nobel Prize–winning economist  Daniel Kahneman attempts to assess what he calls “objective hap- piness”—what makes life pleasant or pleasurable—questioning  basic distinctions between quantity and quality that go to the heart  of both comedy and capitalism: how, in short, to link growing  wealth (getting the bag of gold) to quality of life, which in comedy  </page> <page sequence="17"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 155 often means a realignment of personal freedom and interpersonal  connection. The nominal happy end of comedy, whether represented as  the promise of marriage, social reintegration, rebirth, affirmation  of shared values, or, as Henri Bergson has it, the reassertion of  our humanity, is notoriously difficult to isolate, let alone quantify.  Bergson advances a version of the incongruity theory of laughter,  the notion that humor arises from a perception of the discrepancy  between expectation and actuality, which dates back to Immanuel  Kant, who writes, “Laughter is an affect that arises if a tense expec- tation is transformed into nothing.”31 This rapid transposition of  perspective, the pleasure we take in changes arising from the free  play of sensations, the sudden mix-up of conceptual categories,  gratifies us, Kant says, because it illuminates “our own mistake  in reaching for some object that is otherwise indifferent to us.”32  Incongruity is basic to the structure of modern humor, just as it is  to our consumer-driven modern economy. Happy endings tend to  point offstage and nearly always to reflect upon their own contriv- ance. Even in antiquity, characters jokingly invited the audience  to join an offstage feast. As Northrop Frye comments, “the happy  ending comes from the audience side of the stage,” because comic  endings signal the formation of a new society—often around the  freshly joined hero and heroine—for which the audience had long  hoped. “Happy endings,” Frye continues, “do not impress us as  true, but as desirable.”33 The slave will be freed, thwarted lovers  allowed to marry—later. It is the pursuit, rather than any particu- lar end, that characterizes the genre; the problem of ends is basic  to both comedy and capitalism. Liberalism neither guarantees nor  defines happiness but instead promotes the freedom of each indi- vidual to pursue his or her own happy end. Acknowledging it as  such may enable us to think fruitfully about the forces these atti- tudes have unleashed upon the world. Although capitalists dream  of happy endings in the form of profits—the creation of wealth  that can be put to any use, financial assets to be reinvested—those  endings remain undefined, abstract, or, like capital itself, fungible. The value of abstract media of exchange is that they provide  each agent or character the means and the freedom by which he or  she may pursue his or her own ends, understood in classical terms  as a mix of prodesse and delectare, profit and pleasure. For this reason,  comedies require that blocking characters (moralizers who want to  impose their own vision of the good) are eliminated and often pun- ished. So, the logic of comedy and capitalism both, for better and  worse, tends to press for the suspension, if not elimination, of legal  authority, “gravity,” and other forms of constraint. This feature is a  </page> <page sequence="18"> 156 Alan Ackerman crucial structuring principle of Shakespeare’s festive comedies. For  instance, in Twelfth Night the “devil of a puritan,” the rule-bound  steward Malvolio, attempts to crush the “uncivil rule” of Sir Toby  Belch and Feste; he censors their “manners,” critiques their “mis- demeanors,” and tries to silence their song. But his virtuous denial  of Sir Toby’s “cakes and ale” leads to comic vengeance: Malvolio’s  own removal from the stage and confinement to a dungeon. His  fall comes after he appears smiling and cross-gartered to Olivia.  Sir Toby admonishes him as a figure of gravity itself: “What, man,  ’tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Sathan.”34 Malvolio is a  grave man playing a child’s game, tossing cherry pits into a hole,  which may tempt the devil. So, Sir Toby, Maria, and Feste pull grav- ity out of the way and see what happens. Brought down (literally),  Malvolio becomes a subject of levity. The removal of gravity—here,  the blocking character—allows for the resolution of the romantic  comedy in which, as Frye says, the “hero’s character has the neu- trality that enables him to represent a wish-fulfilment.”35 Ultimately  the play won’t reinstate Malvolio, but it will require some form of  constraint to be imposed on the appetites of its characters, and  not only those below stairs. In Twelfth Night, it is the rhythm of the  natural world that restores a sense of order, as articulated in Feste’s  final song: “For the rain it raineth every day.” To speak of comedy in this way—teleological in plot and cycli- cal in performance—is to privilege form over content; the heroes,  the heroines, and their goals are generic (in A Midsummer Night’s  Dream even the characters can’t tell each other apart). Yet Frye’s  magisterial Anatomy of Criticism, which is explicitly a work of liberal  literary criticism (comedy promotes a “pragmatically free society”),  insists on situating its theory of forms and fictional modes within  the rhythms of the natural world. It is Frye who coins the famous  term “green world” when he calls Shakespeare’s type of comedy  and the tradition from which it derives “the drama of the green  world, its plot being assimilated to the ritual theme of the triumph  of life and love over the waste land.” It is the emptiness of comedy,  its use of stock characters, its openness to the stuff of fantasy and  dreams that is, as Frye acknowledged, formulaic. The hero’s real  life begins at the end of the play, and the audience credits him  with being more potentially interesting than he has appeared. The  comic plot overcomes what is fixed and definable; its logic is evolu- tionary, and creation is nearly always a central theme. Through the  dialectic of freedom and constraint, comedy represents the move- ment of one kind of society to another. “Something gets born at the  end of comedy,” Frye writes, “and the watcher of birth is a member  of a busy society.”36 </page> <page sequence="19"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 157 Comedy, like capitalism, is driven by the engine of desire and  thus is also moving or busy. Schumpeter, who was Frye’s contem- porary, suggests: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps  the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’  goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new  markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist  enterprise creates.”37 Comedy is not only a worldview that privi- leges newness but also a way of viewing that, in the very process of  shedding light on its object, changes its motion. So, the subject of  comedy, like Betty Boop or like Viola in Twelfth Night, is objectified  beneath our gaze, diverted from one orbit and spun vertiginously  through a topsy-turvy universe before achieving new equilibrium  in another sphere. (Olivia, who takes Viola for a boy, would rather  hear her/him speak than hear “music from the spheres.”) The  fact that spectators/consumers imagine or project their own ends  onto those of the characters also suggests the instability and sub- jectivity of the modern comic universe, a reality characterized  more accurately by Albert Einstein—who showed that gravity was  not an independent force but a property of space and time—than  by Newton. Fleischer viewed himself as part of Einstein’s universe, not  Newton’s. As he showed in his 1923 educational film The Einstein  Theory of Relativity, created with popular science journalist Garrett  P. Serviss, Einstein changed the way we understand everything by  showing not simply that the objects we observe are always in motion  through time and space but that we observers are too. The new  epistemology revolutionizes not just the physical sciences but also  society more broadly, as the title cards in this silent film explain: The word [Relativity] itself means “the relationship of” or “dependency  upon.” For instance:—Whether an object is long or short, large or small,  “depends upon” the object with which it is compared. This principle of  relating one thing to another (Relativity) is applied by Einstein to every- thing in the Universe. Einstein’s great Theory is built upon the same  scientific laws which inspired present-day inventions. We are all familiar  with these achievements——.38 Einstein, who “sweeps away every accepted notion,” is the genius of  the culture of creative destruction, the inspiration for new industry,  which the film vividly depicts in imagery of automobiles, skyscrap- ers, airplanes, telephone wires, and X-rays, all of which confound  old notions of time and space.39 At the same time, there is a limit  to the comic potential of unregulated capitalism. I will suggest, via  Fleischer’s own work, including his interpretation of Einstein, how  </page> <page sequence="20"> 158 Alan Ackerman this limit should bring us back down, not just to earth but to the  Earth. Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs illustrates, by means of the idiom  of gravity and levity, a meaningful connection between comedy and  capitalism. To begin with, the Yiddish-speaking, hand-rubbing Sat- urn is not only a figure for the artist, producer, and chief executive  officer of Fleischer Studios but is also a classical reference to the  Saturn of Roman myth, god of agriculture, liberation, and time.  Saturn was a god of abundance and, by extension, of wealth—a  down-to-earth god. “Saturn was first to come down from celestial  [aetherio] Olympus,” Virgil writes in the Aeneid. “Under his reign  was the Golden Age of which men speak.”40 The Temple of Saturn  in the Roman Forum also housed the state treasury, and Saturn was  celebrated at the most famous of the Roman festivals, the Saturna- lia, a time of feasting, topsy-turvy, free speech, gift giving, and rev- elry. Saturn, in short, is the god of capital and of comedy. Insofar  as Saturn in Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs is a figure for the artist, he  is also a figure for the capitalist and, again, for the entrepreneur- ial Fleischer specifically. Fleischer himself did little actual drawing  after 1920, and a 1923 cartoon shows him leading his company  from a building on East 45th Street to bigger digs in Times Square,  bearing a cash box with a dollar sign, like Saturn’s bag in the film.41  Fleischer takes the risk, like Saturn, to “see what happens,” and in  the early years of the Great Depression he seemed to defy gravity,  as Fleischer Studios thrived. The exchange of capital with the gonif  Moon (Paramount, with whom Fleischer contracted to finance and  distribute Fleischer Studio productions in 1929, turned out to be a  gonif indeed) and the uncertainty of the return are the conditions  that allow creative energy to be released. Since antiquity there has been a relationship between com- edy and economics; the latter is a term from ancient Greek, which  meant simply “management of a household,” the satisfaction of  material needs and private affairs. Comedy draws our eyes down  from the heavens. It is down to earth. We speak not of tragic busi- ness but of comic business, which is often synonymous with physi- cal humor but, above all, makes us think both of busy people and  of the market. Yet capitalism operates by translating our percep- tion of human labor back and forth between the concrete and the  abstract. One result of the supplementary relationship between  the concrete and the abstract, in comedy and capitalism, appears  as a basic paradox of the modern labor market, namely that wage  labor is “free” because modern workers, unlike feudal serfs, can  move and sell their work as they wish, but workers in an indus- trial economy often tend to be subjected to strict new disciplinary  </page> <page sequence="21"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 159 regimes that can render them “wage-slaves,” as Marx predicted.42  Thus, capitalism is viewed as oppressive by some and liberating by  others. The tricky slave, a central figure of Roman comedy, evolves  in the culture of capitalism, from Puck to Koko to Groucho Marx  and Bugs Bunny, to become a representative figure, an antihero,  of the modern world. A cypher, he or she attends to the appetitive  life of the body, reflecting the desires of others. A shape-changing  performer, often on the run from her pursuers, Betty Boop has fea- tures of this character type too. The shape-changing performer’s  own labor (often self-reflexively as a performer) is her or his only  asset, so the performer is at home nowhere and everywhere. A second key feature of comedy in the culture of capitalism  bears even more directly on Betty Boop. Many economic histori- ans have noted that speculative investment and paper credit, often  personified as a seductress, threatened male control of women and  generated anxiety (“hysteria,” according to J. G. A. Pocock) about  the masculinity of homo economicus.43 Starting with the South Sea  Bubble in the eighteenth century, the sense that stock could rise  and fall, following passion and desire, and that credit was insub- stantial—phenomena that gave economic opportunities to women  and the middling classes, who gained new access to markets— undermined the hegemony of the paternal land-owning aristocrat  and the stable value of land. Betty does not merely resist control,  like Koko; she also aims to seduce: “Made of pen and ink / She  can win you with a wink.” Less a figure of nature than of capital,  an asset over which Fleischer claimed ownership—an instance of  those “products of the human brain,” as Marx described commodi- ties, that “appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of  their own, which enter into relations both with each other and with  the human race”44—the frankly sexual Betty achieved peak popu- larity from 1932 to 1934, when Hollywood began to censor overt  representations of, or references to, sexuality; she was an icon of  the Great Depression, a time of intense debates about paper cur- rency and the gold standard, and has been reincarnated through  merchandising to become a paradigm of commodity fetishism.  In 1934, ownership of her “Boop-oop-a-doop” was the subject of  a $250,000 lawsuit. Moreover, far from propagating an essential- ist image of feminized nature or the so-called virgin land, typical  of American culture dating from John Smith’s Generall Historie of  Virginia (1624) to Disney’s Pocahontas (1995), Betty (though also  created by male artists) challenges the localized bias of Ameri- can environmentalist thought. Now any old place upon this Earth  is home sweet home to her, a fact to which I can attest, having  three images of Betty on my living room wall, each a framed postal  </page> <page sequence="22"> 160 Alan Ackerman stamp, one from Senegal, one from Mali, and one from Madagas- car. A kind of currency, an image of payment, Betty as postage, air  mail, becomes a medium for the transmission of culture. Betty’s  cosmopolitanism makes her a global commodity. She is a figure for  desire—the Fleischer cartoons graphically emphasize her body— yet explicitly two-dimensional and abstract. To understand the affiliation of modern notions of comedy  and capitalism, with their peculiar emphasis on abstraction, mobil- ity, and profit maximization, it is crucial to recognize the histori- cal centrality of money to comedy. Comedy, like capitalism, is the  product of specific social relations, and it evolves with them. Capi- talism arose, along with new forms of comedy, in sixteenth- and  seventeenth-century England as enclosures and “improvement” of  the countryside displaced peasants and led to the development of  a new relationship to the land. Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs basically  recapitulates the process of enclosure, displacement, and reclama- tion of the whole world via the creation of exchange value—“any  old place upon this earth is home”—as the basis of property, but it  might also remind us that our well-being is ultimately inseparable  from that of the Earth. The abstract and the concrete, dream and  reality, mutually constitute each other. Fleischer made this point  explicitly in The Einstein Theory of Relativity, which celebrates human  industry. Using many of the same tropes as in Betty Boop’s Ups and  Downs, Fleischer is not nostalgic. Title cards announce that “The  mechanical Demon has practically abolished the horse and buggy.  . . . The miracles of yesterday are the commonplaces of today.” But,  the point of the Einstein film is to imagine different perspectives  on human achievements. It fantasizes the eclipse of gravity with a  departure from Earth that anticipates Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs.  After showing the relativity of motion in live-action men at work on  Earth, an animated rocket shoots into outer space; the intertitles  read “Here in space, we stop and look back. Will our impression  of what happens on earth now remain the same?” “The first thing  we find,” in outer space, the intertitles continue, is that “we have  lost our sense of direction.” To the man on Earth, the North Pole  is always north. In outer space, “up” and “down” are meaningless;  all direction is relative. “Even the fall of a ball is no longer simple,  now that we have recognized that direction is indefinite.” Direction  is relative, and so is size. In outer space, even the Earth looks small  compared to the sun. In the Einstein film, concrete examples of relativity are not  only descriptive but also normative. They indicate both a need  to orient human industry in relation to a particular environ- ment in order to foster a coherent pursuit of happiness and the  </page> <page sequence="23"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 161 comic-liberal imperative to respect diverse perspectives and ends.  As another intertitle puts it, “So, up and down to you may be side- ways to me.” Einstein’s revelation that a “fourth dimension,” time,  must be included in measuring or describing every phenomenon  in the universe opens “an unlimited field for speculations, dreams,  and fantasies,” the most amazing of which is that man’s past may  become his future. The clearest indication of the normativity of  these assertions is the single historical example of the relativity of  time. As the conclusion of the film projects its creators’ imagina- tions back into outer space, the rocket races forward at tremen- dous speed yet backward through the centuries. The pilot reaches  1492, turns the ship around, and “Columbus is now in the act of  discovering America.” We are told that Einstein’s discovery of rela- tivity is the greatest since “Sir Isaac Newton gave us his Theory of  Gravitation.” Both are linked to that of Christopher Columbus and  then to the artist, Max Fleischer himself. It’s still the New World  in 1932. On the first page of his curious 1944 book Noah’s Shoes,  Fleischer claims that he “lived through the expedition” in 1492. “It  was I who discovered America,” he writes.45 In 1933, Einstein also  immigrated to the United States. In Fleischer’s universe, the theory  of relativity is liberalism applied to physics and physics applied to  liberalism. It reflects a cosmopolitan (citizen-of-the-cosmos) world- view, unanchored yet dependent upon particular places and con- crete relations. In short, the eco-cosmopolitan argument that I want to advance  situates the idiom of gravity/levity in a comic-liberal framework in  order to assert the importance of provisional points of view. Every  dreamer launches from and must return to (as Shakespeare puts  it in A Midsummer Night’s Dream) “a local habitation,” though new  technologies reveal that habitation to be not a single farm or vil- lage or state but the Earth and, perhaps, the cosmos. It all depends  on point of view. As Fleischer insists, size is relative, and from outer  space even the Earth looks small; recognizing the Earth as a local  habitation, a home potentially for sale, requires us both to free and  to constrain our perspective. The problem with vast and abstract  systems of thought, writes the cosmopolitan Bergson in La pensée et  le mouvant, is that they are “not tailored to the reality in which we  live,” a reality characterized by the “continuous bursting of unin- terrupted novelty” (jaillissement ininterrompu de nouveauté).46 In that  1934 book, Bergson also continued a famous debate that he had  with Einstein on April 6, 1922, at the Société française de philoso- phie. In effect, Bergson critiqued the theory of relativity for being  just such an abstract system in which observers are interchangeable  and completely objective. That scientific model of knowing failed  </page> <page sequence="24"> 162 Alan Ackerman to account, he believed, for the temporal experience of intuition.  Max Fleischer’s take on relativity, with his emphasis on lived experi- ence and novelty, though not a critique of Einstein, is Bergsonian.  (Einstein had written to the distributor of Fleischer’s film that it  was an excellent attempt to illustrate an abstract subject, though  Fleischer joked that Einstein had said, “Before this picture was  made there were only seven people in the world who understood  my theory of relativity. Now that Max Fleischer’s movie has been  made, nobody understands it!”)47 As Gilles Deleuze remarks, Berg- son criticized Einstein for having “confused two types of multiplic- ity, the virtual and the actual.”48 The conventional wisdom has been that Bergson, the philoso- pher, lost the debate to Einstein, the physicist. Einstein believed  that only physics could explain the cosmos, and he dismissed what  Bergson had to say about space and time because, in his view, Berg- son dealt with subjective elements, “the lived world, not the real  world.”49 But some have questioned whether science trumps phi- losophy in comprehending the facts of nature, particularly in light  of new ecological conditions. Bruno Latour, for instance, faults  Einstein for reinscribing a Cartesian separation of mind and mat- ter. Latour attempts to rehabilitate Bergson’s temporal, animated  universe, toward which the human mind could not remain dis- interested. According to this view, lived experience must inform  theory; physics always implies some metaphysics.50 Bergson did not  object to the theory of relativity in general. He praised Einstein  but argued that philosophy too had a place in understanding the  universe and that there was a relationship between psychological  and physical conceptions of time—and that the theory of relativity  represented an advance not only in physics but also in philosophy.  As Latour suggests, Bergson aimed to strike a balance between the  local and the universal, to inject life (l’élan vital) into the universe,  both to allow for novelty and to bring theory back down to earth. Bergson is the philosopher for the Jazz Age, of surrealism  and motion pictures, as he imagines spatial concepts in temporal  terms. In referring to “jaillissement,” which also denotes the shoot- ing up of novelty, he might have been thinking of Georges Méliès’s  1902 Voyage dans la lune, which features a cannon-propelled rocket  (anticipating Fleischer’s Einstein film) launched to the moon  from industrial Paris, smokestacks filling the skies with smog,  and then the first filmic image of Earth rising (a precursor of the  iconic “Earthrise” [1968], the first photograph taken from outer  space, on the Apollo 8 mission). Méliès, Bergson, and Fleischer  employ similar tropes of gravity-defying trips to other worlds (the  liberating force of rockets, the return to Earth), freedom versus  </page> <page sequence="25"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 163 mechanization, and the dialectic of capitalism in the service of  comic-liberal projects. The quintessential theorist of comedy in the  age of capitalism, Bergson was given to gravitational metaphors.  “So, from an immense reservoir of life jets must be leaping out  without ceasing, each of which, falling back, is a world,” he wrote in  Creative Evolution, where he traces all modern science to astronomy  and specifically to the problem of knowing the respective positions  of the planets and how to calculate their positions at any moment.51  His thought centers on questions of motion and materialism and  assumes an atomistic universe. The élan vital is like a rocket, the  extinguished fragments of which fall back to Earth as matter void  of spirit. In articulating his mechanistic theory of laughter in Le  Rire, two years before the release of Méliès’s film, Bergson argues  that comedy occurs, in effect, when we forget and then succumb to  the laws of gravity. Adaptation and the Happy End We thought we’d spun a kind of magic that would suspend the laws of  gravity. —Bill McKibben, Eaarth The question to which I want to return is that of the Fleischers’  Moon/auctioneer, “How much is this big ball worth?” The ques- tion itself may seem absurd, as if we could put a price on life, reduc- ing the Earth to an object in space. The Fleischers provoke us to  ask, how did we get into this ridiculous situation, and what ought  we to do? Like the comic subjects I’ve been describing, my answers  are pragmatic. Faced with a global environmental crisis, the notion  that “private vices” necessarily lead to “public benefits,” as Bernard  Mandeville put it three hundred years ago, seems more dubious  than ever.52 At the same time, the contradictions of our global  advanced market economy appear far less likely than they did in  the days of Karl Marx to lead to its downfall, largely because Max  Fleischer’s exact contemporary, John Maynard Keynes (they were  born six weeks apart), showed how capitalism could evolve beyond  crisis economics. We therefore live in an inescapably capitalist soci- ety and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. However,  while calling for the end of capitalism will, in my view, prove quix- otic, the choice between a comic or tragic frame of acceptance  seems immensely important. In short, my argument is not for or against capitalism per se  but instead aims to show that understanding the structure and  </page> <page sequence="26"> 164 Alan Ackerman poetics of this extraordinarily dynamic and decentralized eco- nomic system can help to orient us relative to the temporal-spatial  realities of our animated cosmos and enable us to better adapt  to our changing environment. This evolutionary process assumes  the form not of tragedy but of comedy. It implies a narrative of  renewal and survival. Comedy centers on life in the here and now,  or the challenge of adjusting to changing habitats, and rewards  adaptation, privileging the creative process rather than the final  result. A comic frame of acceptance implies that we can improve  our minds and our manners, just as we might improve our prop- erty, though it is easy to see how the capitalist ethos of improve- ment, with its connotations of profit and productivity, can quickly  come into conflict with the ameliorative nature of adaptation.  Capitalism is not essentially comic, but understanding capitalism  rhetorically, and specifically in terms of comedy, can enable us to  better comprehend its complexity; to recognize more responsibly  the ramifications of our own desires, errors, and limitations; and  to collaborate with others in the pleasure of (self-)creation. I have  used the word “poetics” and focused my analysis on Betty Boop’s Ups  and Downs because I believe that through its language, its econom- ical pattern of imagery, its symbolism and music, and its narrative  structure, the film allegorizes how this culture works and suggests  a pragmatic politics. The crucial, normative dimension of my argument is that cap- italism loses its effectiveness when it loses its comedic resiliency.  In advocating international free trade in the late eighteenth and  early nineteenth centuries, Adam Smith and David Ricardo envi- sioned a reciprocal interaction between human industry and the  Earth: freedom with constraints. Far from being asked to satisfy all  needs, each locality would employ the “peculiar powers bestowed  by nature”; the rhetorical aspect of these thinkers’ work empha- sizes “interdependence” (in the words of Franklin Roosevelt), or,  as Ricardo put it, relations mediated through “intercourse.”53 My  friends in business and finance increasingly acknowledge a larger  sense of what “improvement” means too. They use the phrase “tri- ple bottom line,” which was first coined about twenty years ago. It  is also known as “people, planet, profit” or “the three P’s,” and it  reflects a twenty-first-century reassessment of John Locke’s theory  of value—that labor improves land, guarantees property, and gen- erates profit. This method has been ratified by the United Nations  as a standard for urban and community accounting in public sec- tor full-cost accounting. As environmentalist Bill McKibben writes,  “The creeping recognition that economics, even in its ever-grow- ing mathematical sophistication, had become abstracted from the  </page> <page sequence="27"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 165 actual planet we inhabit has spurred the steady development of an  increasingly impressive new school of ecological economics.”54 The conclusion of Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs epitomizes the  comic pleasure of coming home to discover that home—or one’s  relation to it—has been made new. Max Fleischer returned to this  theme often and nowhere more explicitly than in his remarkable  book Noah’s Shoes: One week from this day the end will come, and here we stand where  I have so often pictured myself, in Noah’s shoes, seeing the things he  saw and trying to do the things he did. I become fully conscious of my  responsibility, too—the deluge will come and we must be ready. My task  is to build the Ark, load it with animals, provide food, set all hands down  on earth again safe and sound. Not the tiniest insect must be lost in this  undertaking.55 It is a peculiar and poignant statement for a Jew to have made in  1944, and the book concludes with an acknowledgment that “the  result [of the rescue operation] was far from perfect,” followed  by a memorandum listing “Animals Forever Lost to the World”  and a “short description of a few that will never see life again.”56  Today the environmental connotations resonate most strongly  (and Hollywood has returned to the Noah story). Yet Noah’s van- tage point—and Fleischer’s—is resolutely pragmatic (how to build  the ark, how to collect and feed the animals, how to weather the  storm), and it encompasses all living beings, not humans alone. As  Joseph Meeker contends, the comic mode is “a ritual renewal of  biological welfare in spite of any reasons there may be for feeling  metaphysical despair.”57 Perhaps it too can help us to reimagine the  slogan to think globally and act locally. The final segment of the  Fleischers’ film is, of course, oriented vertically rather than hori- zontally, and there is something ironic about Betty, who has just  fallen to Earth, shooting up into the air again and singing against a  backdrop of sky that any old place upon the Earth is home (figure  4). It is a spectacularly urban image and one that suggests a way  of being earthbound and skybound at the same time. If we pair  the final segment with the first, in which disconsolate barnyard  animals consume their own produce as Betty is evicted, we might  discover a suggestive parable, both comic and capitalist, related to  a recent trend that integrates agriculture into urban landscapes on  flat roofs and in empty lots in large cities.58 So, here is a lesson that I draw, perhaps a bit tendentiously,  from Betty’s triumphant emergence at the end of Betty Boop’s Ups  and Downs. It is not that what goes up must come down but rather  </page> <page sequence="28"> 166 Alan Ackerman Figure 4. Betty sings “Any old place upon this earth is home, sweet home,  to me!” to think of ourselves cosmically, constantly moving between the  grass beneath our bootsoles and the stars to which we aspire, grav- ity and levity, the concrete and the abstract, the Earth and the heav- ens. Every subject position is provisional, temporary, and relative  and thus not absolute. The middle position is a temperate one; it is  neither extremely high nor low. The image evokes Bergson as well,  not only as a figure of the living that bursts from the mechanical  but also as an allegorical figure for comedy, which, as he writes, lies  midway between art and life: [Comedy] is not disinterested as genuine art is. By organizing laughter,  comedy accepts social life as a natural environment; it even obeys an  impulse of social life. And in this respect it turns its back upon art, which  is a breaking away from society and a return to pure nature.59 Comedy marks the meeting place of industry and nature, rhetoric  and truth. Kant classed it as “more an agreeable than a fine art.”60  Comedy treats social life as a natural environment and nature as an  extension of social life. In a vital sense, the medium of animated  film involves an analogous reevaluation of the material world, leav- ing it and returning to it by means of new technology, which not  </page> <page sequence="29"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 167 only enables Betty to depart the planet and return safely home  but also animates the Earth and the planets. With a worldview  informed by Einstein and new models of subject-object relations,  the Fleischers intervene in the millennia-long conversation about  the realistic representation of the world. As the word “animation”  suggests, these films bring a recognizable reality to life by means of  a visual language of continuous novelty and fantasy that nonethe- less retains an iconic, if not indexical, relation to the natural world.  It is animistic. The vocabulary of animation is not opposed to real- ism, but it interrogates and returns us to the real.  Finally, then, it is useful to turn from physics to biology, from  the theory of relativity to that of evolution. In my reading this is also  a comic turn, from celestial bodies to animal bodies and their envi- ronments, from the heavens to the Earth and the material of life  itself and, with it, the basic theme of comedy: fertility and rebirth.  Along with Einstein, the crucial modern thinker with whose work  Max Fleischer directly engaged was Darwin. In 1923 in addition to  the Einstein film, Fleischer directed a second educational feature  titled Evolution. The five-reel film was produced by Inkwell Studios  with “scientific supervision” from Edward J. Foyles of the American  Museum of Natural History. Evolution begins with a question mark  followed by a title card that reads “A question you have often asked  yourself: How did we come to be upon this Earth?”61 This extraor- dinary and beautiful movie, again combining animation (of the  lithosphere, of dinosaurs and other things) and live action, also  celebrates human industry at first with images of smoky Manhat- tan, factories, giant turbines, flourishing orchards and farms, ships,  planes, buses, and airplanes. Evolution indicates that the conversa- tion about the realistic representation of the world goes back to the  “cave man [who] decorated his walls with pictures of animals that  lived in his days but are now extinct.” Yet the film does not pres- ent human industry as exclusively benign, and another intertitle,  followed by images of electrical towers, appears: “[Man] toys with  forces that could shatter the Earth in a flash.” For Fleischer, no mat- ter how high we rise, we cannot transcend our earthly condition in  the long run. This observation also refers to the fact that humans  and animals are made of the same material, a comic attitude that  animated movies continually actualize in animalistic humans and  anthropomorphic animals (not only Fleischer’s but also those of  Disney and Warner Bros.; in fact, it is a basic trope of animation).  In the animated world, dogs, cats, horses, and cows have selves too.  Animated movies enter into a long tradition of animal stories; their  comic thrust undermines human pretensions. In Fleischer’s work,  such comic debunking has a philosophical underpinning that  </page> <page sequence="30"> 168 Alan Ackerman speaks to the eco-cosmopolitan project. In the world of Betty Boop,  dogs and horses also have perspective on the world; their expe- rience too has purchase on our shared reality. The combination  of form and content in these shorts subverts the Cartesian dual- ism that privileges humanity’s capacity to say “I think,” separating  human from animal and mind from world. The animated presenta- tion of anthropomorphic animals, plants, and material objects also  challenges the Cartesian quest for absolute certainty in a way that  is pleasurable, not alarming. The biggest mystery of science, we are told in Evolution, is “Was  Man always Man? Or was he once a lower form of animal?” Civili- zations, such as the Aztecs, the Egyptians, and the Romans, rose  and fell. Then the time frame expands, and the movie goes back,  not only before life began but even before the world, to picture  space “with its countless stars when our Earth was not yet born.”  The sequence illustrates the forming of the planet from whirling  stardust, the cooling of the Earth’s surface, the emergence of “mis- shapen forms,” and the development of the atmosphere: “Rising  hissing vapors,—falling oceans of hot waters. The air is split by  lightning. The globe is rocked by thunder.” Mountain ranges form  in slow motion, the globe rotates in the dark sky, molten lava bursts  through the Earth’s crust, and life begins by chemical reactions in  “quiet pools of warm water.” The film illuminates the reproduction  of cells and then multicellular organisms beneath a microscope:  “a shapeless living mass—,” before life “takes more definite forms”  and evolves the instinct of “self-preservation or fear.” Jellyfish with- draw their tentacles from contact with dangerous predators. “Life  spreads in all directions . . . Endless varieties develop.” Creatures  emerge from the waters, make land their home, and so on. The  film implicitly subverts the scientific racism of the period by depict- ing African hunters, Pacific islanders playing ukuleles, Arabs sip- ping coffee, Chinese mothers, and aboriginals of Australia and  America all posing or performing quotidian tasks in their own envi- ronments. The nonhierarchical diversity, not only of races but also  of cultural practices and costumes, illustrates the common human- ity of the subjects and the film’s cosmopolitanism. Like space and  time, the film shows, culture is relative. Fleischer concludes Evolu- tion as he does The Einstein Theory of Relativity and Betty Boop’s Ups  and Downs by situating the spectator in this vast panorama of time  and space: “Like the cavemen and the cliff-dwellers, like Egypt and  Ancient Rome, we too add our chapter. Our cities will bear witness  for the ages to come of our part in the Endless story of Evolution.”  Then the film returns, like Betty Boop in her elevator, to midlevel  shots of skyscrapers. The story of evolution, like that of relativity,  </page> <page sequence="31"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 169 privileges (in Fleischer’s representation) the liberal-comic values  of multiplicity and motion. The dominant note is change. Perhaps, with Betty’s emergence from the elevator doors, we  can think of the classic German idea of Bildung in a new way, as ver- tical cultivation that rejects Romantic idealism. Friedrich Nietzsche  often used this kind of language for our untragic age. “This is what  perceptive knowledge means to me,” says Zarathustra, “all that is  deep shall rise up to my heights.”62 Humanity is not above or apart  from evolutionary biology, and neither is morality, but, as Betty’s  emotional relationship with anthropomorphic farm animals and  her dog-boyfriend suggests, humanity is part of evolutionary biol- ogy. A basic conceit of animated films has always been to regard  beings as people, even when they aren’t human. Betty’s own ani- mality is explicit in the evolution of the character; when she first  appeared in Dizzy Dishes (1930), she was doglike herself and only  gradually lost the jowls and teeth in succeeding films. She is an  emblem of adaptation. In its brevity and silliness, its continuous bursting of uninter- rupted novelty, Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs implies an alternative  to the tragic view of modernity with Betty’s survival of both eco- nomic crash and ecological disaster. The film provides a parable of  bonds not only between everyone on the planet, including ethnic  “Others” such as Jews, but also between species. “Like comedy,”  writes Meeker, “mature ecosystems are cosmopolitan. Whatever life  forms may exist seem to have an equal right to existence.”63 Equal  rights do not, of course, preclude eating and being eaten, but the  cosmopolitan environment may be more complex than the family  farm; the point is that humanity needs to recover a place between  the depths and the heights that doesn’t sacrifice complexity and  contradiction. In evolutionary terms, whether biological or social,  that means adaptation. The universe doesn’t care about us, but this  modest and playful film illustrates the lesson that humanity is part  of nature and is limited by it. The interrelationship between the  form and content of animation subverts the Cartesian duality of  self and world, body and mind. In a reality defined by persistent  dislocation, morality is a matter of finding a local balance. Betty Boop’s Ups and Downs gives us a strategy for living that privi- leges humility and endurance but does not imagine a return to  nature without technology. The 2013 film Gravity, a project that  director Alfonso Cuarón began shortly after the stock market crash  of 2008, not only dramatizes adversity and rebirth but also explicitly  shows that a return to Earth from space—and an evolutionary new  start from a quiet pool of water—is impossible without technology.  The central character, Dr. Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock),  </page> <page sequence="32"> 170 Alan Ackerman at zero gravity, 372 miles above the Earth, becomes detached from  a space shuttle. She tumbles through space, often beguilingly like  Betty in her underpants, but manages via high-tech thrills to return  to Earth in a capsule that lands in a lake. There she manages to  strip off her spacesuit underwater and swim ashore to take a few  steps on land, in full gravity, like a supposed first human from the  primordial sea. Betty Boop has a softer landing. But unlike Dr.  Stone, Betty doesn’t “hate space.” Made of pen and ink, she is com- posed explicitly of the same stuff as her universe. The animated  short offers a new idea of what environmental art might be. Nature has a human face because we find ourselves reflected  in it; we cultivate it as we cultivate ourselves. Thus, in Daybreak  Nietzsche writes, “Woe to the thinker who is not the gardener but  only the soil of the plants that grow in him!”64 I am particularly  mindful of Nietzsche’s metaphor because as I conclude these pages,  it is early spring. I am in the urban core of downtown Toronto,  and the April air is cool. Like most Canadians, I can’t resist the  lure of a slightly sunny day, and I have hauled a folding chair and  table onto the roof-deck of my house. I am shivering at my laptop,  between heaven and Earth, about three flights up, nowhere near  a pastoral ideal of “Nature” but, after a very long winter, feeling  it begin to pulse again in my blood and brain. I can’t claim any  special virtue, like Thoreau at Walden, for building our green roof  structure myself or living off the land without trade or barter. On  the contrary, my wife and I emptied our bank accounts to pay the  contractor. Gary, Al, and Mike built this structure sixteen months  ago, and last summer we harvested a fertile garden of chard and  cucumbers and ground cherries and tomatoes and green beans,  and the list goes on (figure 5). Now the soil is bare. We will have  to plant again. In spite of the countless ways in which our lives  are embedded in the global economy and implicated in its abuses,  this space epitomizes, for my family, the interrelationship of envi- ronmentalism, health, pleasure, education, aesthetics, sound eco- nomics, and socialization. Our harvest is useful and beautiful too.  We eat it together. I can vividly conjure the ghostly crunch of last  year’s cucumbers. The challenge of growing food within the struc- tural constraints of one section of the roof, a galvanized steel trellis,  guardrails, and a narrow planter box, and with limited irrigation,  epitomizes the negotiation of freedom and restraint that charac- terizes the experience of all living beings. That’s why the failure of  Betty Boop’s farm is so devastating to the animals, as she takes off  and they remain trapped in an agricultural vicious cycle. I can’t say whether building this structure on our roof, a “cadre  rigide” (rigid frame) in Bergson’s terms,65 has helped us to escape  </page> <page sequence="33"> Comedy, Capitalism, and a Loss of Gravity 171 Figure 5. The author’s daughter, up on the roof and down to earth. to a small degree the hazard of the mechanical encrusted upon  the living, exemplified by industrial agriculture. But it is a sort of  crystallization that both encloses and exposes us, suggesting ever  new sets of relations. In this frame, I become neighbor to house  sparrows as well as other humans. It represents a form of building  and dwelling that overcomes the divorce that Heidegger identified  in modernity of techneˉ from poieˉsis, technology from art.66 A comic  attitude does not deny that the world is full of suffering and depri- vation, but it tries to reflect on the problems of household man- agement in a way that privileges pragmatism and liberty. Comedy  educates us in our responsibilities simultaneously to each other  and to the planet. Notes 1.
