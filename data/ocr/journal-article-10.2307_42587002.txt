Réunis par Dominique de Courcelles avec la collaboration de of Jean-Pierre Bat (Etudes et rencontres de l'Ecole des Chartes, 24), Ecole des Chartes, Paris 2006, 296 pages For some time now both medieval and early modern studies have been marked by an interest in cultural constructions of 'nature'. Landscapes, topographical fea- tures, weather patterns, plants and ani- mals in art and literature are examined not merely as 'backdrop', ornament, or conventional imagery determined by a particular genre, but as more complex reflections of changing notions of hu- man subjectivity and its situation with regard to the intersecting realms of the natural, the social, the divine. This vol- ume brings together a series of papers presented at two conferences held at the École des Chartes, in 2004 and 2005, in which these issues are explored in a va- riety of French, Spanish, and Italian texts dating from the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. The visual arts also make an appearance, most no- tably in Lizzie Boubli's essay, which analyses ways in which the paintings of El Greco reflect reformulations of the self and the natural world in light of early modern scientific discoveries. Mercedes Blanco, though focusing on Góngora's Solitudes , addresses the knotty question of how, and in what ways, a literary work can be thought of as 'visual' and compared to contempo- rary innovations in the visual arts, in this</page><page sequence="2">Mediaevistik 22 • 2009 611 case Renaissance landscape painting. Arguing that both poetry and painting are informed by the cultural concept of an intellectualised Nature, she proceeds to identify ways that art, whether literary or visual, is a means of endowing the natural world with pathos, and of recon- structing it in an ethical framework. In different ways, the fourteen essays address ways in which concepts of na- ture contribute to the emergence of a modern subjectivity. The very notion of 'landscape' - as opposed to 'nature' or 'wilderness' - implies a subjective expe- rience of the natural world. Thus the construction of a landscape may parallel the constitution of a self; it may offer an allegory of political order or conflict, or of human domination over the rest of creation; it may take shape as the pro- jection of an interior world; as a form of transcendence, it may become a means of experiencing the Other or of access- ing the divine. Philippe Desan, in an essay on Montaigne's landscape descriptions, points out that the word 'paysage' emerges in the sixteenth century and im- plies the extraction of select elements from the natural world and their assem- blage within a framework, governed by human concepts of ethics and aesthetics. In Renaissance texts, 'paysage' is always a background for human activity, re- flecting societal needs and invested with allegorical implications. Desan shows that Montaigne offers only fleeting and formulaic descriptions of 'wild' nature, but that he is far more likely to give de- tailed accounts of framed and ordered visions of the natural world subjected to human use: gardens and cultivated fields, rivers serving as boundary mark- ers and commercial arteries, landscapes as viewed through the aperture of a win- dow. In itself this is hardly new to the sixteenth century; medieval and ancient visual and literary depictions of the natu- ral world certainly also reflected ethical and aesthetic values, human impact, and different kinds of political, moral and spiritual allegory. It is, however, fasci- nating to see how the treatment of 'na- ture' - whether broad landscapes or in- dividual elements such as birds or flow- ers - functions in early modern culture in the service of changing concepts of self, society, and cosmos. Danièle Duport, for example, argues for a Prot- estant implication in Marot's parodie use of allegorical landscapes in the Temple du Cupido , while Rosanna Gorris Camos contrasts the scientific and cartographic study of mountains in the sixteenth cen- tury with Marguerite de Navarre's more subjective use of mountains as a locus of sublimity, of the unspeakable and the in- effable. Frank Lestringant, in an inter- esting discussion of anthropomorphic models of landscape and geologic fea- tures, contrasts the classical legend of Dinocrates and his proposal to sculpt an image of Alexander on Mount Athos, with an early modern view of corre- spondences between the human (micro- cosm) and the world (macrocosm) that are already fully present and need only be discovered by the discerning eye. The final essay, by Chantal Caillavet, looks to the New World to discuss the impact of colonisation on the cultural constructions of a sacred landscape among natives of the Andes.
