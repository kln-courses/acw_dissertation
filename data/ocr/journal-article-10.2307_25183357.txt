<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews of Books 289 Anthropomorphism and interpretation of the Qur'?n in the theology of al-Q?sim ibn Ibrahim: Kit?b al-Mustarshid. Edited with translation, introduction and notes by Binyamin Abrahamov. (Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science. Texts and Studies. Vol. XXVI). pp. xvii, 152. Leiden etc., E. J. Brill 1996. NLG 88.00, US$57.00. With the edition and translation of the Kit?b al-Mustarshid, B. Abrahamov makes another theological work of the Zaydi Imam al-Q?sim b. Ibrahim (d. 246/860) readily available for scholarly investigation, thus adding to his previous editions of al-Q?sim's Mas*alat al-Tabariyyayn and Kit?b al Daltl al-kablr. Kit?b al-Mustarshid treats a number of questions raised by Qur'anic, on the surface anthropomorphic, description of God and reflects al-Q?sim's anti-anthropomorphist theology. Al Q?sim thus denies that God is only in the heavens, that he has a soul (nafs) or a face (wajh), that He is light like created lights, that His being a thing (shay*) involves any similarity with created things, that His being the One has numerical meaning, and that He will be seen directly by the faithful in the Hereafter. In the introduction, Abrahamov analyzes al-Q?sim's doctrine within the context of early Islamic anti-anthropomorphist theology. He then deals with the paramount importance of the Qur'?n in al Q?sim's thought, which is reflected in particular in some of his unedited writings devoted to the praise of the Qur'?n, and describes his method of Qur'?n interpretation. Throughout his discussion, Abrahamov seeks to show that al-Q?sim "seems to have followed the Muetazila with regard to both contents and methods" (p. 7). Al-Q?sim's anti-anthropomorphist teaching is certainly in substantial agreement with that of the Mu'tazila. But agreement does not necessarily entail "following" and dependence. Abrahamov concedes that the Mu'tazila "had forerunners" in their anti-anthropo morphist theology, "the Kharijites, the Qadarites, the Jahmites and even early Qur'?n exegetes, like Muj?hid" (pp. 7-8), who preceded the rise of the Mu'tazila. He argues, however, that Mu'tazilite influence on al-Q?sim is conspicuous in his method of Qur'?n interpretation that relies on linguistic "discussion of words, prepositions, and homonyms", quotations of ordinary usage of the language and poetry (p. 8). Yet this type of linguistic exegesis is even less specific to the Mu'tazila than the anti-anthropomorphist theology. It was widely practiced by the early Qur'?n exegetes. In the lifetime of al-Q?sim, the Basran Abu cUbayda and the Kufan al-Farr?\ neither of whom a Mu'tazili, employed it regularly in their Qur'?n commentaries. Abrahamov argues that in identifying God's "face" with His self (dh?t) al-Q?sim is following the Mu?tazili al-Nazz?m and most of the Basran and Baghd?d? Mu'tazila (p. 15). Yet this interpretation is already found in the Tafsir gha?b al-Qur'?n al-majtd of the early Zaydi Abu Kh?lid al-W?siti flourishing two generations before al-Q?sim and al-Nazz?m (Madelung, Der Imam al-Q?sim, pp. 57? 8) and was upheld by the early Zaydi kal?m theologian Sulaym?n b. Jarir (al-Ash?ari, Maq?l?t, p. 70). Quoting al-Ashcari, Abrahamov mentions that, aside from the Mu'tazila, the Zaydis, Kharijites, and most of the Murji'a "maintained that the visibility of God is impossible" (p. 16). In the next paragraph he insists, however, that al-Q?sim is "following the Mu'tazila" in upholding this tenet. Why should he be following here the teaching of any school but his own, the Zaydiyya? The edition is based on five manuscripts. In establishing the text, Abrahamov regularly preferred the Berlin manuscript (h) as "the earliest, the most complete, the most clearly written and the most accurate." Three of the other manuscripts are indeed derived from the same original as (h) and offer few useful variants. The fourth one (q), however, is evidently derived from another early manuscript. Occasionally it contains additions which fill gaps in the other manuscripts and which must have been part of the original text. This is particularly clear with respect to the addition quoted in n. 914 (p. 134). Without it the text is incomprehensible, and Abrahamov rightly used it in his translation (see p. 135, n. 169). Likewise the larger addition of (q) quoted in n. 906 (p. ii\,fa-innahum rez?fa-in hum) is certainly part of the original text. The additions of MS (q) are thus in general not secondary and</page><page sequence="2">290 Reviews of Books should have been taken into account in establishing the text. Among the numerous other variants of MS (q) quoted in the apparatus, many are evidently corruptions; some, however, seem preferable to the reading of (h). The text of the edition could evidently have substantially benefited from a judicious reliance on MS (q) in addition to (h). More care should also have been applied to the poetry cited by al-Q?sim. Abrahamov evidendy failed to recognize that the quotation on p. 60 1. 17 is a hemistich of tawil poetry (li read liya) and that the three quotations on p. 102 11. 1-2, 11. 5-6 (ya'udh read yuHdh), and 11. 6-7 are lines of poetry respectively in w?fir, rajaz, and tawil metre. Poetry should have been scanned in order to avoid breaking the metre. P. 56 1. 2 al-binya thus must be read al-baniyya (w?fir); p. 60 1. 13 wafadtu .. . qas?'ida: wafadat. . . qas?*idu (w?fir); p. 102 1. 14: wa-tatallab: wa-tattalib (tawil); p. 104 1. 7 asbahat: adhat (basit); p. no 1. 16 ra3?hu: r?hu (bas?t). Only a few other corrections, based on MS (h), or emendations (marked r.) can be given here.
