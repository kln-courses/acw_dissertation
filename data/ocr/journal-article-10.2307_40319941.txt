<plain_text><page sequence="1">T. L. Short Peirce's Concept of Final Causation Peirce's concept of final causation is unique. It has been compared to Aristotle's concept and also to the cybernetic theory of servomechanisms, but it is importantly different from each of these. Neither the unique- ness of Peirce's concept nor its central role in his philosophy have been sufficiently recognized. Yet the problem it was designed to solve is fundamental and is as old as philosophy itself. I. In the secondary literature on Peirce's philosophy, I have found only one extensive discussion of his concept of final causation. This is by Vincent J. Potter, in his book, Charles S. Peirce on Norms and Ideals.1 Potter's discussion is excellent as far as it goes. But while he brings out the similarities of Peirce's concept to Aristotle's, and also some of their dissimilarities, he does not mention their major dissimilarity. Like Aristotle, Peirce does not limit final causes to conscious purposes. "A purpose is merely that form of final cause which is most familiar to our experience" (1.2 II).2 In any case, purposes are not particular psychological events. Rather, someone's purpose is the ideal type which he wills to actualize. His willing to actualize it is what makes this type his purpose, but the purpose is the type, and not any particular act or acts of will. Nor do acts of will provide the whole explanation for why a given type is one's purpose; for these acts of will themselves need to be explained, and Peirce suggests that they are to be explained, at least in part, by that type which they make into a purpose. ". . . it is the idea which will create its defenders, and render them powerful" (1.217). For Peirce as for Aristotle, no final cause is actual; every final cause is a general type. Actual instances of this type might be produced in the future. However, it is at best misleading to describe teleology as the doctrine that the future exerts a causal influence on the present. For it is not to future actualities but to present possibilities that Aristotle and Peirce attribute such potency. From the mechanistic point of view this is every bit as paradoxical a doctrine as that the future affects the present; for this is the theory that mere possibilities have an influence on what actually comes to pass. Some possibilities are more likely to be</page><page sequence="2">370 T. L. Short actualized than others, just because of the possibilities that they are. ". . . every general idea has more or less power of working itself out into fact; some more so, some less so." (2.149). Also like Aristotle, Peirce argues that processes of final causation are observable. They exhibit striking empirical patterns which would be too improbably coincidental if there were no final causes that explained them. The nature of these patterns can be deduced from Peirce's clearest and most careful description of final causation, which he introduces as an explication of Aristotle's concept: ... we must understand by final causation that mode of bring- ing facts about according to which a general description of result is made to come about, quite irrespective of any compul- sion for it to come about in this or that particular way; although the means be adapted to the end. The general result may be brought about at one time in one way, and at another time in another way. Final causation does not determine in what particular way it is to be brought about, but only that the result shall have a certain general character. (1.211) Thus, if you place an obstacle across the path of a line of ants hurrying back and forth between their hill and some source of food, you will find that, after some random explorations along the edges of the obstacle, the ants will take a new path (if one still exists) between home and food. It follows that they are not simply led to food by the paths they take, but that they take those paths because they are led thereby to food. To explain why the means are varied so as to continue to result in outcomes of the same general type, we must suppose that that type is the final cause of the whole process.3 We notice in this that Peirce does not believe, any more than Aristotle did, that final causes can work without the cooperation of efficient causes. The legs of the ant must move to propel it forward, and once its legs are in motion, the ant is propelled, willy-nilly. "Final causality cannot be imagined without efficient causality," Peirce says; but he goes on to say that "no whit the less on that account are their modes of action polar contraries" (1.213). And, as we have already noted, Peirce believes, further, that final causes tend to create or find the efficient causes that are necessary for their realization (cf. 2.149). We turn, now, to what distinguishes Peirce's teleology from Aristotle's.</page><page sequence="3">Peirce's Concept of Final Causation 371 This can best be brought out if we reflect, briefly, on the role of God in Aristotle's philosophy. God is the Prime Mover, the unmoved mover of all else. But God is not a creator in the Judeo-Christian sense. God is pure activity, but no one of his actions creates or controls anything in the world of mortals. That would be efficient, not final causation. The influence of God is rather through his self-contained excellence or perfection. For this goodness creates in lesser things the desire to be like God and, thus, to imitate his activity as best they can, that is, to actualize in their own way the same general type or possibility actualized in the fullest possible way in God. In Aristotle's teleology a final cause is such because of its goodness. More precisely: a general type is a final cause because of the goodness that would characterize any actualization of it. Peirce, however, does not attribute the influence of final causes to their goodness. Perhaps it is for this reason that he felt constrained to invent a new term for the processes that satisfy his concept of final causation. Among such processes he included even those purely physical processes that are irreversible and "tend asymptotically toward bringing about an ultimate state of things. If ideological is too strong a word to apply to them, we might invent the word finious, to express their tendency toward a final state" (7.471). It is not unreasonable to main- tain that in a genuine teleology final causes are supposed to owe their potency to their goodness.4 From that point of view it is doubtful whether Peirce's philosophy is ideological. However, in what follows I will continue to speak of all finious processes as being teleological and of those types of final state toward which they tend as being the final causes of those processes.5 But if it is not by the persuasiveness of their potential goodness, then how do final causes exert an influence? And, especially, how can a mere type explain such irreversible processes as those studied in physics? Peirce's reply to the second question begins with the observation that efficient causation ("force") cannot explain irreversibili ty: Take, for example, the phenomenon of the diffusion of gases. Force has very little to do with it ... The result is due to the statistics of the equal masses, the positions, and the motions of the molecules, and to a slight degree only upon force.6 The random motions of the gas molecules (which, in an homogeneous gas, are of equal mass), and the small forces that these molecules</page><page sequence="4">372 T. L. Short occasionally impose, in various directions, on one another, tend irre- versibly toward the result that the gas is uniformly distributed. This result will come about (barring outside interference) regardless of the particular motions and forces contained in the system. We can prove that that will be the result, and we can prove it without knowing what the particular motions and forces are, beyond the fact that they are, as a group, more or less random. All that is required is a knowledge of some theorems in the mathematical theory of probability. Therefore, it is such laws, and not the particular forces involved, that explain the diffusion of gases. Such a law, being a law, and purely mathematical at that, is not a force. It is, as Peirce says later in the same passage, "an intellectual character." Irreversible processes in physics are explained "as due to chance-action among trillions of molecules" (7.471; cf. 6.73-81), which thereby permit applications of the mathematical theory of probability. "The idea that chance begets order ... is one of the cornerstones of modern physics..." (6.297). The same idea is illustrated in Darwin's theory of biological evolution. "Natural selection, as conceived by Darwin, is a mode of evolution in which the only positive agent of change in the whole passage from moner to man is fortuitous variation" (6.296). Of course, in biological evolution the principle of selection is not a purely statistical law. Nevertheless, that the fittest are most likely to survive, is, like the laws of probability, a tautology (given the assumptions re- ferred to below) . Both in statistical mechanics and in the Darwinian theory of evolution, random variation and tautology cooperate to pro- duce order. "Mr. Darwin proposed to apply the statistical method to biology. The same thing had been done in a widely different branch of science, the theory of gases" ( 5.364) .7 The point to notice in this is that in both cases the respective tautology defines the type of order that will result and is essential to the explanation of that result: it is an abstrac- tion, yet not devoid of power. It is, therefore, a final cause in Peirce's sense of that term. To avoid a common misunderstanding, it will be convenient to point out here that a ideological interpretation of biological evolution does not entail that the aim of evolution is a single, "highest" species. On the contrary, if a final cause is a general type, then it might be actualized in any number of different ways. As Darwin emphasized, the principle of the survival of the fittest entails a divergence of species to fill all of the available ecological niches.8 Similarly, an enormous number of different</page><page sequence="5">Peirce' s Concept of Final Causation 373 distributions of gas molecules will satisfy the definition of a uniform distribution. Again, a man whose purpose it is to become president might try to achieve that purpose in any of several different ways, and the sort of president he becomes, if he is successful, will be influenced by the route to the presidency that he took. Of course, much besides chance and tautology is presupposed both in statistical mechanics and in the theory of the evolution of species. In the first case, we must accept the existence of molecules, each of which obeys the laws of Newtonian mechanics. And in the second case, we must suppose some mechanism by which there may be a large number of more-or-less random but discrete variations in inheritable characteris- tics, as well as an environment neither too hostile nor too favorable to life. But physical laws, not being tautologies, are more in need of explanation than anything else; or so Peirce argued (6.12). Hence, he was led by the preceding considerations to try to explain physical laws themselves as being the product of a cosmic evolution from out of a primordial chaos (6.13). The operative tautology in this case is that in an unrestricted chaos there will occur certain fleeting sorts of order, among which will be some that are capable of reproducing themselves, and which thus constitute a "generalizing tendency" that gradually brings order out of chaos (6.33). Thus, the physical laws presupposed in our accounts of some finious processes might themselves be conse- quences of more basic finious processes that presuppose no physical but only mathematical laws. This last idea is perhaps more speculative than most of Peirce's ideas, but we are not concerned here either to criticize or to defend what he has said. Its implication, however, is that the type, "being an order that will reproduce and sustain itself," is the final cause of every physical law. For it is a general type which explains the existence of its own exemplars. Since Peirce identifies reality with lawfulness, it follows that for him reality itself has a final cause and that it is what fulfills that end. II. So far, we have discussed final causation in terms of ideological or finious processes regardless of whether these processes consist in the behavior of an individual organism or other individual entity or in the behavior of large populations. In both types of process we see the co- operation of two quite different factors: variation and a principle of</page><page sequence="6">374 T. L. Short selection. The differences between these two types of process consists in the nature and locus of the principle of selection. In the one, the principle is a tautology or statistical law applicable to populations that satisfy certain conditions; in the other, it is a principle by which an individual entity selects from among the alternatives otherwise possible for it. As long as both factors - variety and selection - are present, we have a ideological or finious process. There is a distinction frequently made in recent literature on teleo- logical explanation which should not be confused with the foregoing. This distinction is between goal-directed processes such as we have been discussing, and the functioning of an organ or artifact. The latter come under consideration because we apply teleological language to them, too: we say that the organ exists because of what it does or that the artifact exists because of what it can be used to do. Yet the organ or artifact may operate as it does in a perfectly mechanical way. What is being explained ideologically is not their mode of operation but their existence - that is, the existence of something having such a (possibly quite mechanical) mode of operation. From Peirce's point of view, as I under- stand it, such teleological explanations must refer, explicitly or im- plicitly, to some goal-directed or finious process. To say that an organ or artifact exists because of what it does or can be used to do is to say that it has been selected because the usual results of its operation are of a type that satisfies some general principle. Thus, all teleological ex- planation refers, at bottom, to finious processes defined by variation and selection.9 But now a complication emerges: some of the entities that have been developed in a finious process may operate mechanically or by efficient causation and yet others may operate by final causation. We have an instance of the latter type whenever we have a principle of selection grounded in an individual entity.10 Thus, ants are of such a nature as to try various routes around an obstacle placed between them and the food which they have previously located, until they chance upon a route that leads them to that food; but this property of ants had already been selected in the process of evolution. (As a matter of ordinary language, it seems that any organ or artifact that exists be- cause it produces results of some general description may be said to exist for a purpose, but only such organs or artifacts which themselves operate in a teleological manner (i.e., as principles of selection) may be said to act for a purpose. I leave the verification of this remark to</page><page sequence="7">Peirce' s Concept of Final Causation }7S the reader; Peirce's theory is not intended to be an explication of the ordinary usage of ideological language.) It is important to realize that a principle of selection grounded in an individual entity may consist in nothing more or less than its internal "machinery." It does not follow that the finious process which this machinery determines is a mechanical process. As a principle of selec- tion, it operates only in relation to a variety which occurs, relatively to it, by chance. Thus, regardless of the mechanism it might be identified with, it serves to determine a tendency toward a result of some general type; the mechanical steps that actually occur can be tremendously varied and they need not be considered in describing and explaining the process as a whole. Therefore, this determination of a tendency is a matter of final, and not of efficient causation. When an individual functions in some finious or teleological way, it is not to be thought that this instance of final causation reduces to that by which the capacity so to function was developed in the first place. Hence, even if the principle of selection that defines the tendency of biological evolution is a tautology, it does not follow that any principle of selection found in an organism is a tautology. Nor does it follow, because Peirce often put tautology in the place of persuasion by good- ness, that he always did. So far as I have been able to discover, Peirce provided no general account of how finious processes are possible. Per- haps there is no general account, but rather a different account for each such process. However, it does seem likely that, on Peirce's view, one or another tautology is the key to basic types of finious process, that is, to those processes by which entities that ground further such processes were developed. As we have already noticed, Peirce regarded the direction of conscious purpose as only the most familiar instance of final causation. Despite this, Peirce described his teleology as anthropomorphic, since in every case it involves causation by abstractions or general principles, and that kind of causation is typified by the control of his actions by a person's mind. "The mind works by final causation, and final causation is logical causation" (1.250). In effect, Peirce generalized the concept of the mental to bring out the continuity between the human mind and other types of teleological process: in scores of passages he spoke of the behavior of microorganisms, biological evolution, and even the growth of crystals as exhibiting mentality. He did that, for example, in 1.269, and concluded that "being governed by a purpose or other final cause</page><page sequence="8">376 T. L. Short is the very essence of the psychic phenomenon, in general." His point is not that there is some mysterious thing called *a mind' lurking behind such natural processes as crystal formation, but, rather, that human mentality is constituted by processes which may be found in lower grades elsewhere in nature.11 Since these other finious processes are admittedly natural, the place of the human mind within nature is thereby indicated. The mind is seen to be natural without being reduced to merely mechanical processes or, indeed, to any processes of a lower grade. Peirce describes these differences of grade as a difference in the degree of an organism's self-control. Finious processes of at least some types are in an obvious sense self -corrective: various trials are made until the results obtained come close to fulfilling some general idea or principle. When these self-corrective processes are grounded in an individual, they can be regarded as constituting that individual's self-control. "When the prin- ciple of self- correction is itself subject to correction, then we have a higher order of self-control. For Peirce, the highest degrees of self- control are found in man, in consequence of his ability to represent his guiding principles by signs which he himself creates and manipulates.12 What distinguishes the human mind from lower grades of mentality is the higher degree of self-control of which it is capable. Because Peirce in this way sought to account for the human mind as a natural phenomenon, it is not surprising that some scholars have concluded that his teleology is akin to cybernetic theory.13 For that is a theory which also seeks an analogue to human mentality, namely, in the "feed-back" processes of servomechanisms. But, while there may be some conflicting evidence, I think there is strong evidence that Peirce would not regard any of the usual examples of servomechanisms as genuinely self-corrective nor, hence, as displaying any intelligence at all, no matter of how low an order. In 5.472-473, Peirce argued that the action of a sign is triadic, not dyadic. By dyadic action he meant efficient causation, and by triadic, final. The latter he associated in these paragraphs with self- corree ti vi ty and with intelligence. He then wrote, "... if the thermometer is dynamically connected with the heating and cooling apparatus, so as to check either effect, we do not, in ordinary parlance, speak of there being any semeiosy, or action of a sign, but, on the contrary, say that there is an 'automatic regulation', an idea opposed, in our minds, to that of semeiosy." The device to which Peirce here referred is of course one of</page><page sequence="9">Peirce's Concept of Final Causation 377 the standard examples of a servomechanism, the thermostat. The reason its action is not at all intelligent is that it embodies no selective prin- ciple by which order emerges from variety. Instead, it reacts in a per- fectly determinate way to each bit of fed-back information, regardless of what the results of its action may be. Suppose that the control on a furnace breaks, so that as the room becomes warmer, the signal the thermostat sends to the control fails to turn the furnace off. In this situation, the thermostat continues to operate exactly as it had, regardless of the effect. Hence, its operation conforms precisely to Peirce's des- cription of efficient causation: "Efficient causation ... is a compulsion acting to make that situation begin to change in a perfectly determinate way: and what the general character of that result may be in no way concerns efficient causation" (1.212). Cybernetics claims to be an autonomous study of certain types of behavior, regardless of the material nature of that which exhibits such behavior (thus, the same theory might apply equally to computers and to the human brain).14 Nevertheless, there is at least sometimes the implication that the behavior that can be so studied can also be explained in purely mechanical terms. And that is part of the attraction of cybernetic theory: it promises to bring ideological processes into the familiar home of Newtonian mechanics, and domesticate them. But Peirce's teleology is not just methodological; it includes ontological claims. He quite clearly asserted that final causation cannot be reduced to or explained by efficient causation (e.g., in 1.213). On Peirce's view, final causes, if there are any, are basic and irreducible. III. As we have seen, Peirce believed that there could be no final causation without efficient causation. But he also held that "Efficient causation without final causation ... is mere chaos; and chaos is not even so much as chaos, without final causation; it is blank nothing" (1.220). This view is implied in Peirce's account of the cosmic evolution of laws of efficient causation. For the only efficient causation presupposed by that ideological process is in the lawless form of mere instantaneous random reactions. The eventual conformity of these reactions to general laws of efficient causation (e.g., Newton's mechanics) is due to the ideological process by which those laws have evolved. It follows that the conformity of particular efficient causes to laws of efficient causation is itself an example of final causation. "The relation of law, as a cause, to the</page><page sequence="10">378 T. L. Short action of force, as its effect, is final, or ideal, causation, not efficient causation" (1.212). This is a remarkable assertion, and yet it addresses a basic problem. How else are we to account for the conformity of particular reactions to general laws?15 Other variants of the same problem pertain to the influence of thought on action and of moral and political principles on human behavior. Peirce's favorite way of expressing his view is by this analogy: "... a law, by itself without the addition of a living reaction to carry it out on each separate occasion, is as impotent as a judge without a sheriff" (7.532). But the influence of the law or of the rulings of the court on the sheriff is not similarly a matter of efficient causation (1.213). This aspect of Peirce's teleology has been discussed in print at least twice, by John F. Boler16 and by Peter T. Turley.17 Both of these authors suggest that Peirce intended his "sheriff" to stand for that which imposes the law on particular reactions. Thus Boler: "Peirce's ultimate answer, so far as I am able to reconstruct it ... is that laws govern but are not in the discrete, actual events of secondness. What this requires, of course, is the intermediary of 'sheriffs' who are capable of both appreciating the subtle persuasion of Reason, and exerting an efficient force upon events."18 And Turley argues that Peirce may have identified the "cosmic sheriff" with God (who, however, Turley notes, is also the lawgiver) . But this interpretation of Peirce's view is open to at least two objec- tions. First, it interposes a curious kind of efficient cause between laws of efficient causality and the efficient causes that conform to those laws. And this is contrary to Peirce's clear statement in 1.212, already quoted, that this conformity is (just) a matter of final causation. Second, a cosmic sheriff who is both persuaded by reason and muscular in action only presents us with the same problem all over again. How, within this sheriff, does reason manage to win control over action? How is it, even in our human or divine sheriffs, that right commands might and law determines fact? If Peirce did propose such a cosmic mediator, he was not the first to do so. Plato interposed a spirited part between the reasoning and the desiring parts of the soul in order to explain (but not only for this reason) the control exercised by the former over the latter. In his ideal polis, this intermediary becomes the warrior class that will enforce the judgments of the philosopher king. And in his cosmology it becomes the demiurge, whose task is to shape the chaos of the sensible world into</page><page sequence="11">Peirce's Concept of Final Causation 379 images of the Forms. But the relation of law to fact must be imme- diate. If the connection cannot be made without an intermediate, it cannot be made at all; for if there were an intermediate, the connection would still have to be made - immediately - within the intermediate. It is preferable, then, to interpret Peirce's sheriff analogy differently. In fact, his point when he makes this analogy is that a law is not real except in the conformity of reactions to it. Hence, the sheriff is not meant to stand for an intermediary, but only for those reactions that do conform to law and which, by their conformity, give that law reality. The explanation of such conformity is another matter, and Peirce says nothing to indicate that an intermediary is called for. In the basic kinds of finious process we have considered, no further explanation is needed; for, as we have seen, it is a tautology that those processes will tend toward results of the given types. That, I believe, is the heart of Peirce's concept of final causation. Its strength is that in itself the idea is not at all mysterious or exciting. To apply it to this or that phenomenon - i.e., to an apparent tendency toward results of a certain general type - we need only find a relevant tautology - i.e., a tautology that would explain why the apparent tendency observed is not merely coincidental but is, under the given conditions, a real tendency. The importance of this almost humdrum idea is in its application, e.g., in the theory of biological evolution, in statistical mechanics, and, if Peirce is right, in the cosmic evolution of laws of efficient causation. Peirce's concept of final causation plays a central role in his philosophy: in his cosmology, in his philosophy of mind, in his semeiotic, and in his theory of inquiry. I do not have room here to defend or illustrate the last two assertions, and so I offer them only as suggestions which the reader may verify for himself.19 Kenyan College NOTES 1.

References of this type are to volume and paragraph of Hartshorne, Weiss, and Burks, eds., Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1931-58).

This observable pattern - which is also noted by others, e.g., Braithwaite in his "plasticity" theory of purposive behavior - is not identical with final causa-</page><page sequence="12">380 T. L. Short tion: it may be only coincidental in some cases. Therefore, the observation of such a pattern is only the first and not the last or conclusive indication of a genuinely teleological process. We will remain in doubt whether a process exhibiting such a pattern is genuinely teleological if we cannot find or at least imagine a plausible final cause that explains it. As to what these causes may be and how they explain the pattern exhibited, see below. Basically, the final cause is a principle of selection. It is a general type which something must satisfy, either in its own nature or in its consequences, if either that thing is to be repeated or the process is to terminate. How this final cause or principle of selection is made operative will vary from case to case; in each case, its operating explains why the process tends toward that type of result. Braithwaite did not make final causes qua explanatory part of his analysis of purposive behavior. Hence, he left himself open to Scheffler's objection that a process exhibiting "plasticity" may be defined in terms of any number of quite different goals: e.g., an infant's crying may be interpreted as seeking to receive cuddling from its mother or perhaps as seeking to hear her footsteps (the subsequent cuddling being merely tolerated as the price one must pay to hear those footsteps). On our view this "difficulty of multiple goals" is avoided; for the only type of result that may be called a goal of the process is that type which is the operative principle of selection. See, further, footnote 8. (R. M. Braithwaite, Scientific Explanation, Cambridge, 1953, Chapter X; Israel Schef fler, "Thoughts on Teleology," The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 1959, pp. 265-284). 4. In his article, "Teleology," in Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psy- chology (New York, 1902), to which Peirce also contributed many articles, G. E. Moore wrote, "it is only when a thing is supposed to produce an effect because it is good that it is said to be the final cause of that effect . . ." (Vol. II, p. 664). 5. Ilya Prigogine distinguishes between the "evolution," represented by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, toward a state of maximum disorder, and the biological concept of evolution, in which there is a tendency toward order. Prigogine raises the question, "Are these two different types of physical laws?" It may be precisely here that we should draw the line between the genuinely tei elogie al and the merely finious. We could identify final causation with the tendency toward order. Prigogine traces this biological type of evolution back to quite rudimentary types of chemical reaction. (Ilya Prigogine, "Unity of Physical Laws and Levels of Description," in Marjorie Grene, ed., Interpretations of Life and Mind, New York, 1971, pp. 1-13)» Notice that the products of that evolution - various types of order - are plausibly described as 'good'. 6. Carolyn Eisele, ed., The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce (The Hague, 1976), Vol. IV., p. 66. 7. In this quotation I have taken the liberty of replacing the word 'has' by the word 'had', which makes much better sense. Professor Max Fisch pointed out to me that 'has' in the Collected Papers is a misprint for 'had' in the original publication in the Popular Science Monthly. I must thank Professor Fisch for saving me also from many of my own errors. 8. Ernst Mayr argues that "Natural selection is never goal oriented. It is misleading and quite inadmissable to designate such broadly generalized concepts as survival or reproductive success as definite and specified goals." But every goal is general, and the way in which any goal is realized is just one variant of the general</page><page sequence="13">Peirce's Concept of Final Causation 381 possibility. Some goals are such that they can be achieved but once, others such that they may only be achieved to some degree of approximation, and still others such that they may be achieved repeatedly in different ways and/or to different degrees of approximation. Therefore, the difference in generality which Mayr cites is one of degree only. Survival as a species is a definite enough goal for us to determine when it has and when it has not been achieved to some specified extent. This is consistent with its being achieved repeatedly in quite different ways to quite different degrees of success. Mayr goes on, in the same passage, to say that "It is rather easy to demonstrate how ludicrous the conclusions are which one reaches by over-extending the concept of goal-direction. For instance, one might say that it is the purpose of every individual to die because that is the end of every individual . . .** But death cannot be considered a goal unless it is the principle of selection which explains the directionality of a process. (In fact, the death of individuals does have survival value for species that reproduce sexually and, therefore, although death is not itself a goal or final cause, it does have a teleological explanation.) See footnote 3 for further discussion of the critical importance of insisting that the goal of a process is also its final cause or explanation. (Ernst Mayr, "Teleological and Teleonomic, a New Analysis," in Cohen and Wartofsky, eds., Boston Studies in the Philoosphy of Science, XIV, 1974, pp. 96-97.) 9. As William Wimsatt says, ". . . the operation of selection processes is not only not special to biology, but appears to be at the core of teleology and purposeful activity wherever they occur." As Wimsatt also notes, this idea is not new. Again, referring to the work of D. T. Campbell, Wimsatt says, "In each case there are two correlative processes involved in selection, aptly named 'blind variation* and 'selective retention* . . .*' It should be clear that by 'selection* I have meant only what Campbell and Wimsatt call 'selective retention*. Thus, as I use the term, selection does not comprise variation but is correlative to it. Now Wimsatt, like Mayr (see footnotes 8 and 10), refuses to limit teleology to conscious purpose, yet flinches from ascribing teleology to classes of process that involve a "gradation from the . . . living to the inanimate.'* Therefore, he denies that blind variation and selective retention is an adequate analysis of teleology: "I think that it is not (presently) supported by 'ordinary language* conceptions.** But of what relevance is ordinary language? Wimsatt, like Mayr and like Peirce, is interested in the logical structure of explanations of biological and other phenomena. All three authors use the word 'teleological' because they see an analogy between some perfectly good explanations and Aristotle's teleology. Such ordinary locutions as 'in order to* occur in explanations exhibiting the same logic. But there is no necessity to limit the concept of teleology to the domain of the ordinary usage of teleological language. If explanations outside that domain employ the same logic it is important to notice that fact. (The arguments of Mayr - mentioned in footnote 8 - do not appeal to ordinary language but depend upon pointing out incoherencies in extending teleological language so far; but I believe I have shown that those incoherencies do not exist.) 10. This is precisely the distinction which Mayr (op. cit., footnote 8) draws between what he calls 'teleomatic* and 'teleonomic* processes. The former are mechanical processes which tend toward a determinate outcome, while a teleonomic process "owes its goal-directedness to the operation of a program'* (ibid., p. 98).</page><page sequence="14">382 T. L. Short Such a program is what I have called a principle of selection grounded in an individual entity. The only behavior that Mayr regards as genuinely goal-directed is teleonomic behavior. 11. There are times when Peirce himself uses 'mind' and cmental' in the narrow sense, as when he says that "habit is by no means exclusively a mental fact. Empirically, we find that some plants take habits. The stream of water that wears a bed for itself is forming a habit" (5.492). But we notice that the point is still the same: Peirce is trying to make us see that what we take to be characteristic of the human mind is also found, in simpler form, elsewhere in nature. 12. Peirce makes this point in several places but most effectively at 4.533-534. Here he maintains that self-control begins with "inhibitions and coordinations that entirely escape consciousness," proceeds through instinctive modes of self-control and training, to where "a man can be his own training master," and even beyond that to the test and correction of the rule he sought to inculcate by his self- training. Here we see thinking, as an element in self-control, emerge. But thinking is itself controllable, by making it a subject of thought. And this is possible because thought consists in signs and signs can be made objects of other signs (5.534; cf. 4.531). To pursue this point further, we would have to develop Peirce's entire semeiotic or theory of signs. (See also Richard Bernstein, "Action, Conduct, and Self -Control," in Bernstein, ed.

To suggest that it is by the physical structure of the things involved only begs the question. For structure can explain function only if structure already consists in how something would function under given circumstances. Nothing that is merely actual, merely what it is in the present, could explain what would be. That, at least, is Peirce's view, which he expresses in many ways, and especially by his insistence that Thirdness (which comprises all law, continuity, etc.) is irreducible to the other two categories (see, e.g., 5.88 ff). 16.
