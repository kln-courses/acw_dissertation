Wilson Adriaen Isenbrant and the Problem of his Oeuvre Thoughts on Authorship, Style and the Methodology of Connoisseurship Adrianus Isebrandus Brugensis, Gerardi Davidis pictoris Veteraquensis discipulus fuit, in nudis corporibus, et vultibus humanis delineandis egregius. Sanderus, Planària illustrata , 1624 Sanderus1 could not have known how heavily subsequent authors would rely on his words to define the oeuvre of Adriaen Isenbrant.2 Throughout the late nine- teenth and twentieth centuries, connoisseurs have invoked this description, 'dis- ciple of Gerard David', as a basis for attribution and attempted to link with Isenbrant numerous works evincing a wide variety of Davidian characteristics. Circumstantial evidence is repeatedly offered to support the probability of Sande- rus's assertion: for example, the fact that both painters were active in Bruges and that portions of their periods of activity overlap.3 However, documentary investi- gations have brought to light no piece of evidence which securely identifies an extant work by this painter, and none of the works currently attributed to Isen- brant bears a signature or even a monogram. In spite of this minimal documentation, an oeuvre for Isenbrant has been assem- bled and currently includes nearly five hundred works of many distinctly different styles. Further, new attributions continue to be advanced, thus expanding this already problematic body of works to even greater proportions. The disparate styles in evidence within the current oeuvre suggest that neither visual nor docu- mentary evidence has been carefully considered. It is the purpose of the present study to initiate the necessary reassessment of the works attributed to Isenbrant. The article begins with a review of the documentary evidence of Adriaen Isenbranťs life and of the efforts of connoisseurs which have been responsible for assembling his oeuvre. I shall further propose a method of evaluation of works attributed to Isenbrant which may enable a more successful reassessment of these works and will offer the results of my examination of certain works in the current 'oeuvre'. The study concludes with reflections on the art historical problems posed by the oeuvre of Isenbrant with regard to the issues of authorship, style, and the methodology of connoisseurship. The Life and Career of Adriaen Isenbrant Adriaen Isenbrant was not a native of Bruges,4 but he became a free-master painter in that city on 29 November 15 10. 5 Although minimal documentary evidence of his life and work prohibits a complete biography, we nonetheless possess evidence that reveals some of his activities. He owned a house in the Korte Vlamingstraat,6 yet the precise dates of his occupancy are unclear. Various records from the parish church of Saint Jacques7 reveal that he was married twice. His first wife, Marie, daughter of Pierre Grandeel, died in 1537. His second wife, Clementine, daughter I Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2</page><page sequence="2">of Jean de Haerne, was still alive upon her husband's death in 1 5 5 1. Four daugh- ters survived him: three from his second marriage and one illegitimate child born of his union with a barmaid, most likely in 1530. He apparently fathered three other children who died in their early years. Other documents disclose aspects of Isenbranťs professional life. Guild records8 reveal that he held the office of juror (vinder) for nine terms throughout his career and that he held the post of treasurer (gouverneur) for two terms in 1 5 26-27 and 1537-38. He registered his only apprentice, Cornelis van Callenberghe,9 on 26 June 1 5 20, ten years after his own receipt of free-master status. Civic records provide a closer view of his activities as a painter. In 1 5 20, Isenbrant was paid for his work on the decorations for the Triumphal Entry of Charles v into Bruges.10 From the records of litigation between the Bruges painters, Gerard David and Ambrosius Benson, we learn that David had at one time taken certain workshop patterns (patronen) from Isenbranťs house.11 Further, one month be- fore his entry as a free-master painter in the Bruges guild in 1534, the Bruges painter Jan van Eekele was ordered by the city aldermen to complete and deliver several small panels (tavereelkins) that Isenbrant had commissioned him to paint.12 From the records of litigation between the Bruges goldsmiths' guild and Isenbrant in 1 5 45 , we learn that Isenbrant had been commissioned to paint a new banner for the guild and in the process had ruined the old banner, which he had used as a pattern, with punchmarks ('met ponssene').13 Finally, it appears that Isenbrant may have sold his panels through the Antwerp salesman, Marc Bonnet, who had at one time received paintings from Isenbrant which were valued at 7 1. gr.14 Bonnet appears to have rented stalls in the Bruges pandt during the fairs for the period 15 20 -21 to 1531-32, a fact that suggests that although Isenbranťs name does not appear among those painters active in the pandt market sales, his works might nonetheless have been on display in that marketplace along with those of other Bruges' painters who may have had dealings with Bonnet. These documents constitute the only known records of Isenbranťs professional activity. Unfortunately, they provide no evidence that connects his name with an extant work. Indeed, what these records do reveal about his professional practices - that David took certain workshop patterns from Isenbranťs house, that Isen- brant commissioned another painter, Jan van Eekele, to execute works for him, and that Isenbrant may have sold his works through a dealer associated with both Antwerp and Bruges - indicates that even if a secure work were available, defining Isenbranťs oeuvre would be at the very least an extraordinarily difficult procedure. In spite of these records of Isenbranťs complex professional practices, various scholars have nonetheless attempted to define Isenbranťs production. Connoisseurship and the Formation of an 'Isenbrant Oeuvre' Isenbranťs name has not always been associated with the vast body of works currently attributed to him. The initial grouping consisted of three works and was at that time attributed to Jan Mostaert. In the first half of the nineteenth century, Florent van Ertborn of Antwerp had purchased three panels that appeared to him to be stylistically related: the Deipara Virgo 15 and two portraits that were identified by armorials as Jacqueline of Bavaria and her husband, Frank van Borselen.16 An inscription on an engraving17 which reproduced the portrait of Jacqueline further supplied the name, 'Jan Mostaert', as the painter of the portrait. In 1 847, Waagen18 accepted the grouping that van Ertborn had assembled and later expanded the grouping with a few additional works that he also attributed to Mostaert.19 The identities of both the sitter for the presumed portrait of Jacqueline of Bavaria and of its painter, Jan Mostaert, gradually came to be questioned and were found to be erroneous. It was argued that the portrait did not correspond with other 2</page><page sequence="3">I attributed to Adriaen Isenbrant, The Van de Velde Diptych , interior left wing, Brussels, Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Inv.no. 2592.

Photo IRPA I KIK, Brussels with permission of the church extant images of Jacqueline. Moreover, that Jacqueline died one century before Mostaert's period of activity further brought the attribution into question. Waagen acknowledged the error in the identification of the portrait, yet he con- tinued to attribute to Mostaert the grouping of works that he had assembled around the portrait. It was not until Gustav Glück's research on Mostaert20 was published in 1893 that a stylistic basis was established for the works of Mostaert. Thereafter, Waagen's grouping became known as the works of 'Pseudo-Mostaert' or 'Waagensche Mostaert'. The separation of Waagen's grouping from the name 'Mostaert' prompted a reas- sessment of the grouping itself. Van Ertborn's original grouping of the two por- traits and the Deipara Virgo was retained and came to be referred to as the works of the 'Master of the Deipara Virgo'.21 The remainder of the Tseudo-Mostaerť grouping was similarly renamed as the work of the 'Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin', after a major work in this grouping now divided and housed in the Musées Royaux des Beaux- Arts de Belgique in Brussels and the Church of Our Lady in Bruges (figs.i and 2). Resulting from the obvious debt this panel owed to the work of Gerard David, it was presumed that the 'Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin' must have been David's disciple. In 1864-65, W. H. James Weale22 had published a group of documents on the painter, Adriaen Isenbrant, which included Sanderus's quotation identifying Isen- brant as a disciple of David. However, at this time the works of the 'Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin' had not yet been dissociated from their attribution to Jan Mostaert. It is perhaps after Glück's work on Mostaert in 1893 that Weale's earlier documentary investigations of Isenbrant began to seem relevant to the works of the anonymous master. In their publications accompanying the 1902 exhibition of Flemish primatives,23 both Weale and Hulin de Loo suggested that the 'Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin' and Adriaen Isenbrant might be identical. Although each was hesitant to claim this identification with certainty, 3 Oud Holland J aargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2</page><page sequence="4">they nonetheless established an enduring link between the newly expanded oeuvre of the anonymous master and the name 'Isenbrant'. In 1905 , Bodenhausen devoted a chapter of his study, Gerard David und seine Schule , to the works of Adriaen Isenbrant and his workshop.24 He isolated a grouping of thirty works which he attributed to Isenbrant and twenty-three additional works that he believed were the products of Isenbrant's workshop. Although he was aware of the problematic evolution of the oeuvre, he adopted the suggestion advanced by Weale and Hulin de Loo and proceeded to expand and chronological- ly arrange the works which he believed to have been painted by this disciple of David. Max J. Friedländer25 essentially adopted the oeuvre assembled by Bodenhausen and further expanded it to one hundred and fifty panels. In a preface to his cata- logue of Isenbrant's paintings, Friedländer criticized Bodenhausen's efforts, not- ing that he neither took into account all the extant panels nor proceeded consis- tently with established standards for attribution. Friedländer stated that his own catalogue was neither definitive nor complete; however, he explained that he felt obliged to publish the entire list so that future scholars might 'disentangle this large store into several groups.' That the oeuvre presently includes nearly five hundred works suggests that this has never been successfully achieved or, indeed, ever attempted. Toward a Reassessment of the 'Isenbrant Oeuvre' Previous discussions of Isenbrant's oeuvre have focused primarily on questions of his style and thus have been greatly complicated by the nature of the origin of the oeuvre. Because the basis for attribution was a verbal description - 'disciple of David' - and not a secure visual example of the painter's actual pictorial style, connoisseurs have felt obliged to consider any panel that evinces Davidian features as a possible work by Isenbrant. In numerous instances, these Davidian features have comprised pictorial motifs, such as compositional designs, individual figures or figurai groupings.26 While these motifs certainly link many of these works to those attributed to Gerard David, they have frequently obscured the perception of the distinctly different manner in which individual works have been painted. Considering the documentary evidence of workshop practices in sixteenth-century Bruges - evidence that clearly reveals that painters such as David, Isenbrant, Ambrosius Benson, and possibly Albrecht Cornelis, variously had access to one another's models - the appearance of shared motifs among stylistically distinctive works can only be expected.27 From the perspective of connoisseurship and the reconstruction of individual painters' oeuvres, a clear separation must therefore be maintained between the issue of the application of paint onto the pictorial surface and the sub-surface invention or formation of motifs or entire compositions. In this approach, the painter of a given work is defined quite literally as the individual who actually achieved the colored surface; however, it cannot be taken for granted that the 'painter' is necessarily also the inventor or perhaps even the executor of the drawn composition or motif. Such a restricted definition of the term 'painter' is clearly necessary in light of the complex interrelationships of this group of late Bruges painters; here, careful attention to the manner in which paint has been manipulated to produce individual forms - and not the forms themselves - pro- vides the only reliable evidence of the painter's individual hand. Certain relatively insignificant features, such as many of those that Morelli28 isolated, further reveal additional signs of individualistic tendencies in rendering forms. By contrast, the repetition of figurai forms or compositions rarely constitutes reliable standards by which to evaluate a particular style. This proposed method of analysis, wherein attention to the pictorial surface is 4</page><page sequence="5">3 attributed to Adriaen Isenbrant, The Nativity , Basle, Oeffentliche Kunst- sammlung, Acc.no.

I hasten to add that whether or not this grouping can be considered to be the work of Isenbrant himself remains to be determined. Until a securely documented work emerges, this grouping must thus be understood as the product of an anonymous painter. The pictorial characteristic that distinguishes certain works as a stylistically coher- ent grouping is the tendency of the painter to create extremely smooth and evenly modelled surfaces and to enliven these surfaces and occasionally those in the surrounding areas with a series of delicate, curved lines or touches that serve as highlights or indicators of texture. This particular approach is not only apparent in facial and figurai features, but is also evident in architectural forms and landscape motifs. Although entire compositions or single figures are frequently derived from a variety of sources and, in some cases, are repeated in several variations, this distinctive method of applying paint is the feature that distinguishes the constitu- ents of this specific stylistic grouping. Female facial and figurai forms vary according to the dictates of composition, scale, and workshop models, yet certain tendencies in the construction of these forms are nevertheless apparent. As exemplified in two characteristic members of this grouping, the Basle Nativity 30 (fig. 3) and the Washington Adoration of the ^ Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2</page><page sequence="6">Shepherds ,31 (fig. 4), faces are generally depicted on rather small, rounded heads and are shaded at the temple, brow, cheekbone, nose, and upper chin. Prominent, rounded eyelids are enframed by faintly painted eyebrows, and shading beneath the eyes further defines their general roundness. Lips are proportionately small and gently curved in form. A deep shadow is placed beneath the lower lip that not only suggests the fullness of the lower lip but also defines a particularly rounded chin. Hands are somewhat smaller than the heads, and fingers tend to be rather long, thin, and individually highlighted. Fingernails are frequently not delineated. While heavy drapery often conceals each figure's individual forms in smooth masses of fabric which usually fold at the hemline in irregular, triangular shapes, general contours suggest bodies of average proportions. Male heads tend to be much longer and more angular than their female counter- parts, yet they are shaded and highlighted in a similar manner. The shading is however frequently more intense in tone and coloring. Hair on both the face and head is painted with broad flat tones that are enlivened by curved lines that suggest the pattern and texture of curls. Hands are proportionately small and fingers are rather stocky. Entire figurai forms are again of average proportions and are cloaked in masses of substantial drapery which fall in irregular angular folds. More striking than the forms of individual figures is the manner in which they are painted. As exemplified in the nearly life-size portraits of the Van de Velde family, which constitute the subject of the left wing of the monumental diptych commis- sioned by that family 52 (fig.i), the surfaces of flesh are extremely smooth, and the forms of individual facial features are rarely outlined (fig. 5). Rather, they are created through carefully blended shading and highlighting. The pigments have apparently been applied in extremely thin glazes, a technique that allows for a gradual build up of forms. The resultant contours of individual forms are excep- tionally soft and blurred, and their protruberances and recessions are accomplished solely by a skillful manipulation of light and shade. Brushstrokes are only apparent in the occasional defining lines that suggest eyelashes, eyebrows, or fingernails. Where line is used in abundance is in the rendering of hair and ornament which frequently enframe individual faces. The extremely wispy curls of hair and beards are created by thin, curved strokes that are delicately applied over the soft base tones that establish the general color and form of the hair. This distinctive approach to rendering figures is not only evident in the Van de Velde portraits but also appears in several of the full-palette scenes of the 'Seven Sorrows' wing of this diptych (fig. 2). Although the figures are much smaller in scale, they are painted with the same multi-layered glaze technique that allows for the smooth and intensely modelled flesh. Delicate overlays of line appear in the areas of the hair and translucent draperies. Occasionally, these lines also serve as highlights on the flesh, particularly on the bridge of the nose or on fingers. Even in the grisaille scenes, where the multi-layered glaze technique appears to have been abandoned, this same tendency to create evenly and intensely modelled flesh and to apply curvilinear accents is the dominant approach. Moreover, in both the full- palette and grisaille scenes, similar facial features recur. Both upper and lower eyelids tend to be rounded and framed by a thin wash of glaze that suggests the eyebrow. Noses tend to be long, ending in slightly highlighted tips above narrow, softly shaded nostrils. Lips are usually small with pronounced curves. Their con- tours are frequently blended into the surrounding skin while a faint line separates upper and lower lips. Certain figures of the full-palette scenes are less skillfully painted: for example, the Madonna of 'Christ among the Doctors' (fig. 6); the Madonna and St. John of the 'Crucifixion'; and the Madonna of the 'Lamentation'. In each case, the figures are not as intensely or smoothly modelled, and the brushstrokes that serve as high-</page><page sequence="7">5 Detail of Fig. i.

Photo IRPA/KIK, Brussels, with permission of the church lights or shadows are not blended into the surface of the flesh but rather retain their identity as separate strokes. The curls of the hair are likewise not applied with the same deft, curvilinear touch. These figures appear to be painted by a hand less adept at this particular technique, yet by one clearly attempting to work in the manner of the dominant hand. Although each constituent of this grouping displays this distinctive method of rendering flesh, hair, and ornamentation, two panels in particular represent highly developed examples of this approach. The figures in the Basle Nativity (fig. 3) and the Washington Adoration (fig. 4) exhibit richly modelled surfaces of flesh with especially intense highlights and shadows. The extreme delicacy with which the linear accents have been applied evokes a particularly soft texture of finely curled hair. Other panels that are noteworthy in this regard include: the Madrid Madonna and Child in a Nichel the Kassel Madonna and Childs the Munich Presentation in the Temple (fig.7);55 the Pittsburg Vision of Saint Ildephonsus (fig.15);36 and the Virgin and Child Unthroned Triptych .57 Massive architectural forms are also distinguishing features of this grouping of panels and frequently play a major role in compositions. However, these forms serve more as opportunities for ornamentation than as means to define space. Neither foreshortening nor perspective is achieved with particular mastery. For example, in the full-palette and grisaille renditions of the 'Seven Sorrows' of the Van de Velde Diptych and in the Madrid Madonna and Child in a Niche , an architec- tonic throne or a shallow niche fills the entire picture plane. In each composition, the Madonna is awkwardly foreshortened so that she appears to have been placed y Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2</page><page sequence="8">7 attributed to Adriaen Isenbrant, Presentation in the Temple , Munich, Bayeri- sche Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Alte Pinakothek, Inv.no. 1404. 8 Detail of Fig. 1 . Photo IRPA / KIK, Brussels, with permission of the museum against the niche rather than having been situated within a created space. Yet, in each case, the rich ornamentation of each structure initially obscures the percep- tion of the spacial distortions. The creation of standing or kneeling figures within interior spaces is far more successful, as is evident in the Madrid Mass of Saint Gregory 38 or the Munich Presentation in the Temple (fig. 7). Here, the figures comfortably occupy the space created by massive piers and archways. Yet, the sense of spaciousness is created somewhat more successfully by the verticality of the architectural features than by suggestions of spacial recession. The figures predominantly occupy the fore- ground of the picture plane, while immense piers virtually fill the space of the middle ground. The placement of additional figures that are properly diminished in scale in the middleground and background further enhances the effect of spa- ciousness. Deep spacial recession is minimally suggested by the vaults and win- dows that can be seen through the narrow archways. While architectural forms rarely suggest convincing spacial recessions, they do however provide ample surfaces for decoration. The surfaces of architectural forms are richly ornamented with intricately painted motifs that frequently include plants, vines, rams' heads, and grotesques. The tendency to juxtapose smooth surfaces and highly textured areas which was apparent in this painter's approach to painting figures is again in evidence. For example, the exquisitely rendered marble columns in the Prado St. Gregory and the full-palette 'Seven Sorrows' wing of the Van de Velde Diptych (fig. 2) are painted in thin glazes that evoke highly polished, multi-colored marble shafts. By contrast, the capitals and bases are highly ornate and richly highlighted. Deftly applied touches or linear strokes appear on the more intricate curvilinear forms, leaves, and anthropomorphic motifs. Not only is the Washington Adoration (fig. 4) an especially fine example of this 8</page><page sequence="9">9 Detail of Fig. 2.

Although this structure is again the dominant feature of the middleground, individual col- umns and piers are less massive than in other panels and thus evoke a greater sense of space. The particularly delicate forms of the ornamented elements of the struc- ture further create the illusion of diminished structural mass. A greater spacious- ness is also suggested by the expanse of the stone floor that is visible both in front of and behind the figures. This painter also achieves the illusion of pictorial space through his use of land- scape. Whether viewed through architectural elements, as in the Basle Nativity (fig. 3), or simply rendered in the upper register of the picture plane, as in the portrait wing of the 1 Van de Velde Diptych (fig.i) or the London Magdalene ,59 background landscapes tend to have fairly high horizon lines that allow for the representation of distinctive natural forms (fig. 8). The most striking feature of the landscape backgrounds is a type of rock formation that Hulin de Loo had aptly described as ťcactus-like' These clusters of rocks may be distributed throughout the space or may be grouped at either side of the picture plane. In each case, these clusters become progressively larger as the space recedes into the distance. These forms may have been inspired by the fashion of Antwerp landscape painting, most notably exemplified in the works of Patinir and Jan de Cock. Yet, the rounded or blunted shapes that are painted in very broad and flat strokes distinguish them from their Antwerp counterparts, which are instead richly textured and usually culminate in angular, ragged points.40 9 Oud Holland J aargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2</page><page sequence="10">Heavily foliated trees are similarly distributed throughout the space and assume the same rounded forms as the rock formations. Unlike the rocks, however, the richly textured trees and shrubbery are achieved with numerous touches of a lighter green paint which suggest individual leaves. Smaller versions of the tree forms serve as other types of shrubbery. In addition to these natural forms, farmhouses, figures, and animals are also dis- tinctive features of this landscape style. In a manner similar to that used in render- ing the rocks, the farmhouses are painted in broad, flat strokes, whereas the Staffage figures are virtually sketched in the lighter and more linear touch that is character- istic of this hand's approach to foliage, hair, and ornament. Although the 'cactus-like' rock formations and trees are frequently found in many landscapes, all landscapes do not necessarily contain both features. In the example of the 'Flight into Egypt' of the full-palette 'Seven Sorrows' wing of the Van de Velde Diptych (fig. 9), the entire composition appears to derive from Dürer's 'Flight into Egypt' of his woodcut series, The Life of the Virgin , executed in 1 503 -1 505 and published in 1 5 1 1 (fig. 10).41 Although the landscapes differ somewhat in form, the painter of the diptych has approximated the dominant tree form that appears at the far right in Dürer's print and has reproduced the general impression of a dense and lush environment. That this landscape is a product of the hand that I have isolated here is revealed in the manner in which the landscape has been painted. The juxtaposition of smooth planes and highly textured areas can be seen throughout the landscape. The richly textured foliage is particularly characteristic. Thus, influ- enced by his apparent source and having omitted the peculiar rock formation that he has employed frequently in other parts of the diptych, the hand reponsibile for the creation of the grouping under consideration is nonetheless clearly in evidence. Just as all landscapes by this hand do not contain the same recurrent forms, the presence of these forms does not necessarily constitute evidence of this hand. This phenomenon is clearly illustrated in the Antwerp Nativity (fig. 11), 42 an almost identical version of the Basle Nativity (fig. 3). Every landscape and architectural feature that is depicted in the Basle panel is repeated in the Antwerp version, including such minor details as the blades of grass that are rendered in the lower right corner of the window space. Yet, the execution of these motifs is distinctly different. The deliberate and precise touches of paint that create foliage in the Basle panel are much thinner and more irregular in the Antwerp version, the latter strokes having been almost carelessly and rapidly applied. The same deviation in the use of paint can be observed in every feature in the landscape, particularly the massive rock formations in the distant ground and the architectural structures of the middleground. Every attempt has been made to record each form, however, the careful juxtaposition of broad planes and richly textured areas has either been abandoned or, perhaps, gone unnoticed. A few works are related to the grouping under consideration but are in various ways problematic. The New York Nativity Triptych (fig.12)43 may well be, as Friedländer suggested, a relatively early work. The figures are somewhat stiff in pose, yet the surfaces of their flesh are softly modelled and particularly rich in coloration. However, the details of hair and costume are less carefully articulated. The series of curved strokes that evoke various textures appear only occasionally as indicators of curled hair. The foliage of the background trees, however, does exhibit numerous touches of paint that are applied with deliberation and regulari- ty. The predisposition to create extremely smooth surfaces and to contrast them with richly textured areas is thus in evidence, yet it appears here in a less developed form. By contrast, the figures in the grisaille exterior wings of this triptych (fig. 13) are much more skillfully formed and painted than are their full-palette counterparts. 10</page><page sequence="11">I I Oud Holland Jaargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2 II attributed to Adriaen Isenbrant, Nativity , Antwerp, Museum Mayer van den Bergh, Inv.no. 35 8.

The numerous curved lines and touches that define the curls of hair are particularly lively and delicate. The lines of the drapery and the individual brushstrokes that define shadows and highlights are similarly active. This mastery of form and confidence in execution makes it difficult to imagine that the grisaille wings of the Nativity Triptych are of the same date as the full-palette scenes or, perhaps, even by the same hand. However, these disparities may be the result of different stages in stylistic development. The Philadelphia Pietà (fig. 14), 44 shares many stylistic features with the full-palette wings of the New York Nativity Triptych and thus again presents the possibility that it is an immature manifestation of the style under consideration. Although the physical condition of the panel in its lower half is rather poor, the figures of the Virgin and Sts. John and Mary Magdalene display in both form and style the features found in the New York Nativity Triptych . The particularly rich tones of flesh and drapery are shared features of both works. Further, the individual leaves of the foliage are created with numerous brushstrokes in each work. Conclusion Since its appearance in 1934, Friedländer's study of Isenbrant has remained the definitive source for attributions to Isenbrant. The fact that he stated that his list was overlong, lacked homogenity, and should be separated into smaller groupings has been ignored in subsequent attempts at attribution. His acknowledgment of the difficulty in employing the name 'Isenbrant' has similarly been overlooked. The current scope of the Isenbrant problem - i. e., that although there is no secure basis for attributions, the oeuvre continues to be expanded - would thus appear surprising were it not for the fact that Friedländer himself neglected to consider these issues when he published his own assessments of the works. Although he was among the first to acknowledge stylistic discrepancies within the Isenbrant oeuvre, his approach paradoxically subverted the very notion of diversity that he ad- vanced. Friedländer significantly expanded the oeuvre that Bodenhausen had assembled with numerous works that were variously related to panels attributed to David. He took literally Sanderus's claim that Isenbrant was the disciple of David and as- sumed, as many previous critics had done, that these Davidian compositions pro- vided possible evidence of Isenbrant's production. Although he acknowledged the difficulty in using the name 'Isenbrant' and recognized the stylistic diversity within the oeuvre, he nonetheless published his list under the heading 'Works by Adriaen Isenbant,' thus fusing the diverse production under a single name. He further attempted to define Isenbrant's identity in individual essays devoted to the painter's works and to his character.45 In his essay on the works by Isenbrant, Friedländer isolated for evaluation a few works of 'value and distinction', yet he surveyed the entire body of stylistically disparate works in his essay on Isenbrant's character. In his pursuit of a single identity he not surprisingly inferred from this diverse production a stylistic personality whose 'nonchalance in borrowing, com- bining, and exploiting might be called almost cynical'... 'had it not been shaped against a background of modest and guileless craftsmanship.'.46 Evident through- out the catalogue and essays is Friedländer's belief that the aim of connoisseurship is biography.47 This conviction is clearly revealed in his persistent use of the name 'Isenbrant' and in his attempts to identify and describe this painter's works and his character. However, his fidelity to the enterprise of biography resulted in the creation of an 'Isenbrant' in spite of the absence of evidence that would reveal his identity. That there were no securely documented works from which to begin an assessment of Isenbrant's achievements suggests that Friedländer's essays on the nature and character of Isenbrant's style were at the very least premature. 12</page><page sequence="13">15 attributed to Adriaen Isenbrant, The Virgin Appearing to Saint Ildefonso , Pittsburg, Museum of Art, Carne- gie Institute, Inv. no. 64. 1 1 . 1 5 (Col- lection of Howard A. Noble) Both Isenbrant and his oeuvre are the products of traditional connoisseurship, in which the biographic impulse has been dominant. The terms 'artist' and 'oeuvre' are primary and interdependent within this discourse, and the recovery of both are the ends to which the enterprise of connoisseurship aspires. It is assumed that a painter's personality is revealed through his works. Hence, descriptions of stylistic features become characterizations of individual personalities. No more clearly is this in evidence than in Friedländer's characterization of Isenbrant and his relation to the painting of his time: 'The significance of Ysenbrant's successful output lies in its appearance in that place at that time, as the late flowering of the Bruges school, as symptom of the withering of its creative power, limited by self-imposed indolence and fatalism. Hans Memlinc and Gerard David had remained hesitant and abashed in the face of the crude and brazen world. Guardians of the temple, they had never bidden genre and secularism welcome. In place of Memling's bright and trusting innocence, David's lofty solemnity, Ysenbrant put a soft and graceful 'picturesqueness,' pro- gressively freezing into stereotype and professional routine.'48 From this type of description, it can be seen that pictorial characteristics have been anthropomorphically transformed and taken to represent the attributes of the creators' personalities. Yet, if style becomes the artist's personality, the artist's name similarly becomes a part of a given work's identity. As Foucault49 has sug- gested, the artist's name functions in many ways. The artist's name not only enables works to be grouped, thus providing a means of relating works or distin- guishing between works,50 but also serves to confer status onto objects by separa- ting them out from ordinary artifacts, claiming for them the status of 'art'.51 If we consider the Isenbrant problem from this perspective, it becomes clear that in order to bring both Isenbrant and the hundreds of anonymous works into the discourse of art history, it was necessary that the painter have an oeuvre and the works have an author. Isenbrant's reputation as the disciple of David provided the I 3 Oud Holland J aargang/ Volume 109-1995 Nr. 1/2</page><page sequence="14">ostensible link between the painter and a vast number of Da vidian works. How- ever, compelled to classify these Davidian works, connoisseurs have produced an 'Isenbrant' and an 'oeuvre' which distort the very phenomena that they have attempted to reveal. Isenbrant was surely a painter active in sixteenth-century Bruges, but it is not at all certain that we will ever know what it is that he painted. In an effort to remain faithful to both visual and documentary evidence, I have considered the works attributed to Isenbrant as anonymous productions. Because certain works attri- buted to Isenbrant evince specific stylistic features and thus do appear to form a coherent grouping, I have attempted to define those stylistic tendencies that these works share. However, until a securely documented work emerges, this grouping and other works that may subsequently be added to it cannot be said with certainty to represent the work of Isenbrant. As a temporary measure, the designation 'Master of the Van de Velde Portraits' might perhaps be usefully employed as a means of identifying the grouping defined in the present study, due to the aesthetic and historiographie importance of the Van de Velde Diptych. That this 'author' should however be understood at this time as a 'style' rather than an individual is, I believe, critical in this very early stage of the reassessment of the Isenbrant oeuvre in order that the careful visual analysis needed at this juncture might proceed as rigorously as possible; for it is without doubt far too early in the process to begin to craft an account of the character and development of this particular artistic person- ality or others that may be subsequently identified. Just as the earlier separation of the name 'Mostaert' from the initial grouping prompted a thorough reassessment of the works themselves, so too may the sepa- ration of the name 'Isenbrant' from the vast number of works now attributed to him provide a similar opportunity to review and reevaluate this complex body of images. As Friedländer noted many decades ago, the 'Isenbrant oeuvre' must be separated out into several smaller groups. The visual evidence amply demonstrates that the designation 'disciple of David' denotes a complex community of painters variously affected by his art. Adriaen Isenbrant was undoubtedly one of those painters. However, we can no longer accept that he was the personality that we have come to know or the author of works that currently bear his name. Indeed, to reconsider Isenbrant is to enter the world of sixteenth-century Bruges ateliers in which the making and marketing of paintings were fundamental and consequential activities.

Sanderus claims to have received information on the Bruges painter from Dionysius Hardwijn (1530- 1604/05), an individual who studied in Bruges at some point in the mid- sixteenth century (see Parmentier, 'Bronnen.. .IX. Adriaan Isenbrant,' R.B.A.H.A. 9(1939), p. 23 1 , nn. 4, 5). Isenbrant's reputation as Da- vid's disciple may thus be a valid one. However, even if a precise interpretation of the term 'disciple' could be determined, the literary source can in no way be substituted for a securely documented work as the basis for attributions to Isen- brant, for a 'disciple' might adopt any number of traits from his master's work. 2 No monographic study has ever been devoted to Adriaen Isenbrant. However, documents relating to this painter have been published by W.H. James Weale, 'Adrien Ysenbrant,' Le Beffroi 2(1864-65), 320-24; idem, 'Peintres Brugeois. Les Prévost,' A. S.

' David appears to have been active until his death sometime in 1523, approximately thirteen years after Isenbrant became a free-master painter. 4 The place of Isenbrant's birth is unknown. Recent archival investi- gations in Leiden have revealed an 'Adriaen Ysbrantsz.', who in 1 5 1 5 brought suit against another paint- er, Jan Jacopsz. (see Jeremy Bangs, Cornelis Engebrecht s^.' s heiden. Stud- ies in Cultural History [Assen, 1979], p. 89). It is possible that this 'Adriaen Ysbrantsz.' is identical to the 'Adriaen Isebrant' who entered the Bruges guild as 'foreign' in 1 5 10. Further research in the Leiden archives for the name of Isenbrant's presumed brother, 'Martin Ysen- baert', who purchased citizenship at the same time as Isenbrant himself did, might yield more definitive proof of this hypothesis. On Martin Ysenbaert, see Weale, 'Adrien Ysenbrant...', p. 320, 2n.
