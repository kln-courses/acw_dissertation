<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDEA OF A SUPREME BEING AMONG THE A OLD PEOPLE OF GHANA * BY C. R. GABA Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana, Legon Mawu is the ABlb name for the Supreme Being. This same word is used by other Eue neighbours to designate their Supreme Beings. In a wider sense Mawu is generic symbol for deity and is freely applied to the lesser gods which the AilJ1 people particularly refer to as Tr3. Whether Mawu originated from its use for the Supreme Being or from its generic usage for deity in general is not easy to say. However the A1l1 people believe that the lesser gods have taken on some divine attributes because the Supreme Being created them and delegated divine authority to them to represent him in the world of men. This belief and A1J31 attempts at etymological solution seem to support the view that Mawu originated with the Supreme Being and was later adopted as generic symbol for deity. Many attempts have been made to solve the etymological riddle of Mawu. The commonest among the AIl3 people themselves is Ema ye wu, "this is the One who surpasses all." Others think Mawu is rather a combination of two particles: a negative ma and a superlative wu. Wu for others is the Eve for the verb "kill." Thus Mawu in AI319 thought is, on the one hand, "the One who surpasses all," "the Omnipotent" and, on the other, "the One who does not kill," the bountiful, the merciful. Some other researches into the etymology of Mawu appear rather wild guesses which may safely be ignored here. 1) But one fact which emerges from all these attempts is that Mawu is a proper name and like some other proper names, its real etymology is long lost in the mists of time. Perhaps this is the outcome of the same unqualified reverence for the divine name that still makes a riddle of the Tetragrammaton of Judaism. However, all these suggested etymological solutions *) The outline for this article comes from a section of the author's un- published London Ph. D. Thesis. i) Smith, E. W(ed.), African Ideas of God (1950), 230-231.</page><page sequence="2">A Supreme Being among the Aylo people of Ghana 65 seem to converge on one point-to emphasise the immeasurable and the unsurpassable greatness and goodness of the Supreme Being. Mawu as a personal name assigns personality to the Being who bears it. So very sharply is the personality of Mawu distin- guished from that of everyone and everthing else that there is not the likelihood of any confusion in AIj1b thought. In a way, Mawu is considered a great power, the source of life. Side by side with this belief is that in the all-pervasive energy which is diffused throughout the world of nature. Unlike this natural potency, largely regarded as impersonal and non-moral, Mawu is a personal and a moral being. Then the personal Mawu is regarded as the Creator of the impersonal non-moral force. Moreover the AIjl witchcraft concept reveals that the witch-spirit is the im- personal force in action. When the witch goes to a night assembly the material body continues to show signs of life (though very faintly), because of the presence of the life soul believed to be the little bit of Mawu in every living person. Moreover, in AIg1 thought every living person has in him the life soul from the Supreme Being but everyone does not possess the witch-spirit. So that the all-pervasive impersonal power, perhaps the likeliest to occasion a confusion, cannot be the same as the personal Mawu in the thought of the Alo man. In emphasizing the personality of the Supreme Being, the Ailo people tend to anthropomorphize. Mawu has sex; he is male. As the creator and sustainer of the universe, he is father. Mawu can see and hear because men pray to him. He can act because he answers prayers and sits in judgement over the deeds of men. All these references are not at all unlikely to call into the imagination of the Ablo people vivid pictures of human form. Such experiences as they have of their Supreme Being are personal and contribute towards their concept of personality. And personality in AI3b thought does not go without anthropo- morphism. Indeed in every society the world over, the invisible is apprehended within the compass of that society's own under- standing of life and in attempting to describe the indescribable, human terms cannot be avoided. It is in these universal steps that the Aij1b people tread when they apply anthropomorphic terms to their Supreme Being. They do not at all take Mawu in his being to be human exactly like themselves. Nor do they Journal of Religion in Africa II, I 5</page><page sequence="3">66 C. R. Gaba regard him like the Akan NyaJkoploJ of Dr. Danquah's research 2) as once a great benevolent ancestor who has walked this life in human flesh and form and after his death became deified and later elevated to the position of supreme importance as a High God. In fact the invisible nature of Mawu is as much alive among the Ailb people, in their own way of course, as it is where deity is largely a philosophical concept. Many Aib people have claimed to have seen in dreams and even in waking lower spirit powers who have temporarily assumed human forms. But it is quite re- markable that no such allusions have ever been recorded of the Supreme Being. One Anaglate Afetogbo, an elder of the Bame clan in Ail9land once remarked "It is only Christians among us who have dreams about their Mawu. For us he is too big to appear in dreams. For this purpose he has given us the lesser gods and the ancestors." The Agb people can never put up with the idea of imagining a corporeal representation made of the Supreme Being let alone the thought of housing him in a building as the Christians do-so they understand it. That the Supreme Being is spirit (gbagba) with its implicit idea of invisibility thickly underlined, is too widely known and the belief firmly established in Aibland. It will, therefore, be the greatest disservice to a people like the Aibl, despite their strong emphasis on the invisible nature of Mawu, to construe their anthropomorphic references to mean the conception of Mawu as a human being. The Abla people can only feel and experience him through his activities which are personal and involve some human passions and senses. They, therefore, picture him as possessing personality, life and consciousness comparable to that of a human person. To the Aijl people, then, Mawu, as Supreme Being, though personal, has never been or will he ever be a human being. He is intensely spirit, with human personality where personality does not involve the possession of a form. In Aijl thought the Supreme Being is not wind (ya) though such references may commonly be heard. More accurately, he is spoken of as "like the wind." Like other anthropomorphic references, this is also a figure and it is heavily loaded with ideas. Like the invisible wind, the invisible nature of the Supreme Being is accen- tuated. Just as the wind is known and its presence felt through 2) Danquah, J. B., The Akan Doctrine of God, London 1944, 27.</page><page sequence="4">A Supreme Being among the Aylo people of Ghana 67 its activities, so also does the Supreme Being reveal himself and can only be known by what he does. As to whence and whither the wind blows, the AiJlo man confesses his ignorance. Similarly, in his thought, are the beginning and end of the Supreme Being. But he knows that the wind blows "where it listeth," detesting a vacuum. This always reminds him that the Supreme Being, like the wind, is everywhere and cannot in any way be localized. When, then, after deep reflection over the vicissitudes of human fortune, the Aj3lo man utters a prayerful sigh "Mawuli," essentially he does not mean "There is God." even though this may be implied. What he really means, even from the very nature of the circum- stances surrounding the utterance, is "God is near to succour." He therefore has no need at all to walk to any particular places before he can effectively call upon him as he should in case of the lesser gods and the ancestors. The following account very aptly stresses the already deep-rooted AIjl belief in the uniquity of the Supreme Being. During a formal interview on the Alo worship of the Supreme Being, the ninety year old Awlosu Avudzega of A13loga, the tradition- al capital, remarked: "My son! Mawu is too big to be put into a small room and worshipped only at that place. In all ABloland, it is only the Christians who do this. How can we put into a room a Being we can never see and who is like the wind blowing every- where? Our lesser gods we are able to house because they reveal themselves to us to see them and are locally connected with us just as other people also have theirs. Indeed I have my doubts if what you Christians worship in your churches is not the lesser god of the white man!" (This old man died a traditional believer rather suddenly, apparently from heart failure, two weeks after the eventful interview.) The quite unexpectedly pungent nature of the remark may make some consider it too refined to come from such a mind. But those who know the Aj13o people well, and espe- cially this old man who was widely respected for his intelligence, integrity and knowledge of traditional beliefs and practices, can only admire the comparative ease with which the remark was made and never doubt its source. At any rate the old man has put together very tersely here the Aj13 conception of the omnipresence and the invisible nature of the Supreme Being. A passing comment. This sharp allusion to Christianity demands serious thought especially from those who live by that faith.</page><page sequence="5">68 C. R. Gaba To this old man, the worship which Christians accorded their God, was nothing different from his own worship of his tutelary deities. Perhaps he might even have thought the AUlo Supreme Being higher in status than the God of the Christians! Of course he was justified. This indeed is the inevitable price of Christian over- emphasis placed on worship in special buildings-religiosity rather than true religion-in the backland villages of Africa among the thoughtful who do not look upon Christianity as a fashion in vogue for the civilized in a community, but who wish for a reasonable appraisal of the faith before making up their mind in favour of it. Though the Supreme Being is Spirit and, like the wind, is believed to be present here and now, yet he is also considered to be far away in the sky. The A~)1 man's prayerful sigh of "Mawu li," paradox- ically, may be accompanied by a spontaneous raising of the eyes at times together with the first finger of one had towards the sky-in his thought the highest possible point that can be imagined. "That big man up there" (pointing the first finger to the sky) is a remark from others when a person's suffering, especially that of sorcerers and witches in their last days on earth, is believed to be a punish- ment from the Supreme Being. This skyward reference is another anthropomorphic figure pregnant with ideas. To the Ar3b people the created have houses where they dwell. Why not he who has made homes ? He must therefore have his abode at a place befitting his status as the highest and the greatest Being. In short, while the Supreme Being as spirit, like the wind, demonstrates clearly the AUlo conception of God's immanence, his home far away in the sky accentuates God's transcendental greatness. It is worth noting that the Arb people are spared the trouble of confusing their Supreme Being with any of the natural phenomena of the sky partly because they do not use the same word for him and any of the natural phenomena (Nyygmo of the Gd of West Africa means both God and rain) and partly because the worshipful natural phenomena of the sky, like the Thunder-god, So, are referred to explicitly as the messengers of the Supreme Being (Mawu fe dolawo). Mawu, as Spirit, is considered the breath or life that sustains man. The Ajlo conception of the soul reveals that the real animating principle in the soul is the life soul (gb1gbZ) which is believed to be the little bit of Mawu in every person. When the life soul leaves</page><page sequence="6">A Supreme Being among the A ylk people of Ghana 69 the body death occurs. After death it returns to its source, the Supreme Being. In AUlo thought the universe took its origin from the Supreme Being. In prayers to the lesser gods and the ancestors the Supreme Being is the God who has sent man into the world (Mawu-/o-ame- ja). Also, he is the Creative Artist who has made hand and foot (AQayuwdtA w;) asi w;) aft) 3) In everyday language he is the Maker, (Wla) . The Supreme Being as Adayuwmtb sheds some light on the Aglo conception of the art of creation. In ordinary speech, adayuwatd describes creative artists-smiths, carvers, masons, potters even tailors-in fact all whom the Abl people regard as relying upon their own ingenuity or creative ability to evolve something beautiful and useful from an otherwise useless thing. Adayuwoto then points to the Supreme Being in general as a Creator, but more particularly as a moulder, a constructor, giving form to a formless matter as a potter for instance does. This formless matter is often thought to be clay. "What a durable clay has Mawu used in moulding him!" This is an apprecia- tive remark from others when the aged engage in activities not thought as normally possible at their age. Additionally the verb me in AJlo is used when reference is made to the Supreme Being as creator. This verb, in common usage, connotes the idea of the use of clay or soil. A potter is zemela, one who moulds pots and kpemela is he who moulds bricks. Finally when life ceases in man on earth, it is believed, the component parts of man go back to their sources of origin; the personality-soul to the post-earthly spirit world and the life-soul to the Supreme Being. The physical body, the AUlo people realise, decomposes into earth-clay-which logically speaking is its origin. What is the origin of this formless clay that the Aijl people suppose was used in creation? "As for this we can never know. However, as the Maker of everything, Mawu may have made this clay himself." This is the usual reply when the thoughtful are pressed for an answer. In fact the Arijl man can never give any more dubious answer than this to questions on his religion. This uncertainty concerning the origin of this primeval clay is unique not in the sense that it expresses doubt about the Supreme Being 3) Gaba, C. R. Unpublished London Ph. D. Thesis. App. A. Nos. 61 and 81.</page><page sequence="7">70 C. R. Gaba as its Maker. In fact to the Alj3 man everything that forms part of creation must have its origin from the Supreme Being directly or indirectly. Where the uniqueness lies is in the unqualified confession of man's abysmal ignorance in face of the wisdom of the Supreme Being "which passes all understanding." The AIlo people therefore, do not think creation was by a divine fiat. It is the works of the "hands" of the Supreme Being. At the same time it is ex nihilo if this cryptic phrase is understood to mean that the Supreme Being, as the Creator of everthing in the universe, himself created his own formless matter, clay, which he later used to fashion the universe. Creation is as the Supreme Being wills it. In Aj3loland, particularly among the illiterate folk who form the bulwark of traditional believers, anyone who, for example, wants to build a house just calls in a mason and shows him a plot of land. Without a set plan, the mason builds depending largely upon his own imagination. So also do tailors sew without taking any measurement. So, when the Ab131 people apply to the Supreme Being a word originally used for their creative artists, allied ideas may not be absent. It is the will of the Supreme Being that some are black, others white; some tall others short; some rich others poor; some honest others dishonest. Everything is known to him and predestined to some extent according to his wish. The soul in AIl3o thought may be referred to as the real person (amea yuto). This is a pointer to another strand in the A13jl con- ception of the art of creation. The Al31 people believe that the Supreme Being first made (wo)-a verb that is vague in its usage- the spirit counterpart of the universe. From this the material later evolved. Every person, more especially his personality-soul, is regarded as having lived a life in a pre-earthly spirit home prior to his birth into the material. A person's successful material existence must, as far as possible, reflect his pre-earthly spiritual existence. After death the personality-soul returns to the spirit world-presumably the post-earthly part of it. Thence, according to AJ13 conception of reincarnation, a personality-soul may come back into the material world. "We have come here (the material world) to sell our products. When anyone finishes, he must return home." This is one remark when a person dies. Implicit here is the view that it is the spirit world that is real and the material is a later and a shadowy reflection of the former. Perhaps it is</page><page sequence="8">A Supreme Being among the A Vl9 people of Ghana 7P worth noting too that the Ajlo name for the post-earthly spirit world, tsiefe, is, in the mind of some Alo people, a corrupt form of tsi nye fe "where I life for ever," that is, my real home. So that side by side with the Alo view which regards the Supreme Being as moulding the universe from clay is a more refined one which pictures the Supreme Being as first making an indestructible spirit world from which a material counterpart, the unreal, evolved. If these two views are both original to Aijlo thought, the cruder view of the Supreme Being as a moulder may be the earlier one. Then, later probably, the people reflected on the shortness of their life span in the material world, which indeed is comparatively very short-the obvious outcome of poor conditions of life prevalent in developing countries. Added to this is the idea of reincarnation which thinks of man's material existence as occasional visits from his real home in the spirit world. Thus the transitoriness of material existence and the idea of reincarnation may have played a part to establish at some time the view that the Supreme Being made a spirit world from which the material counterpart evolved. A "Biblical" view of creation is recognizable here-one much like the second account in Genesis and the other like the neo- platonic concept reflected in the Epistle to the Hebrews. While not rejecting the possibility of missionary influence-for instance the Belebele tradition of origin in Aijloland equates Belebele with Biblical Babel-it would be quite wrong to consider everything as the outcome of missionary influence. If well-informed scholars 4) nowadays consider the idea of a High God or a Supreme Being indigenous to black Africa and not the result of missionary activities, it does not make sense if an African people like the Aijlo is not considered worthy of an independent participation in the inevitable corollary of a High God belief; namely, to engage in the universal restless inquiry into the origin and purpose of the activities of this God. At any rate, two main views, as already noted, are now in existence in Aalo thought. So widely are they known and so easily are they referred to that they seem much earlier known in the life of the Aijlo people. There do not seem to be any creation myths in Aalo thought 4) See e.g. Parrinder E.G., West African Religion (revised ed., I961), 13-14. Also Smith, E.W. op. cit., Introduction. Modern researches have shown that the idea of God is indigenous to the Eve people who form the larger cultural unit to which the ArIlo people belong in West Africa.</page><page sequence="9">72 C. R. Gaba Stories which speak of creation and the fall recorded in some Eue reading books by German missionaries were probably collected from other Eue neighbours and generalization for Eue speaking peoples must naturally include the A1ijl Eue people too. 5) The elderly among the Alo people who are much nearer the distant past and who possess some reasonable knowledge of A131o traditional beliefs and practices could not recollect any such stories. Nor are there any details about the sequence and the way man, woman, and other things in creation came into being. The Supreme Being is the creator of all. This is enough. The details are unimportant, for they do not appear to affect the life of the A-loe man for better or for worse. But even if these myths and creation stories had ever been known in A3boland and were long forgotten in the history of the people; it only confirms that these details are trivial to them. However, the A1lo people think that the Supreme Being created the universe in a way that can make life possible for man. "If this were not so how could he have made herbs the knowledge of which prolongs life here ?" affirms the 84 year old Chief Adrakpanya II of Afife village, much respected for his knowledge of herbs. In A1lo thought the Supreme Being also created death. This is not just a logical deduction from the belief that the Supreme Being is the source of everything. It is categorically stated. Man is a trader away from home in the material world. He must return home, that is die, when his wares are sold out. A popular legend in A13oland affirms death as the inevitable gateway to the life beyond. Tsali, the deified ancestor of the Tsiame clan, was believed to be a supernaturally powerful man in his earthly days. So powerful was he that he attempted to enter the life beyond without first dying. It is believed he was turned back when he got to the bank of the river that separates the material world from the land of the dead. He came back and died before he was admitted into the society of those in the Hereafter. Moreover, the Ajl3o people believe that the last item in the destiny that a personality-soul brings to the material world is the manner of his death through which he returns home. And destiny comes from the Supreme Being who is Segbo, the Great Destiny or the Great Determiner of destiny. But death is also unnatural, not ordered by the Supreme Being, but brought about by wicked spirit powers and men. "That is 5) See e.g. WiegrAbe P., Evegbalexexle Akpa Enelia (Bremen 1938).</page><page sequence="10">A Supreme Being among the A b19 people of Ghana 73 not the action of any wicked human being. It seems his days on earth are ended." 6) This is part of a prayer during a minor stool festival in A0b1land and refers to the death of one of the prominent elders of the Euifeme clan. It succintly sums up the A0lo belief that death is both ordained by the Supreme Being and can be caused by evil spirits and men. The name of the Supreme Being appears in some personal theophorous names. Some of these names refer to the Supreme Being as the Almighty; Mawunyegd, "God is the greatest One." Others speak of him as the source of all goodness: Mawunyo, "God is kind." This name can also mean "God is just" that is, he is a moral Being on the side of fair-play. Others such as Mawuli point to God's existence and nearness to man. When Mawusi "in the hands of God" appears it testifies to the sustaining Provi- dence of the Supreme Being. Mawunya and Mawunu both mean "this is the decision of God." According to the 84 year old Chief Adrakpanya II, his grandmother was called Mawunu. The mother of Mawunu and her co-wife were both pregnant about the same time. The co-wife had her unborn baby magically protected with fuli and fuke, charms against abortion through the agency of evil powers. Mawunu yet unborn was not thus protected. At birth she survived and the magically protected was a still-born baby. Hence she was named Mawunu which means This is the decision or doing of God. In other words, even if all other powers fail, the Supreme Being can still succeed. He is also the great protector of the helpless. A Mawufe, "from the abode of God," is a child believed to be part of the parents' destiny. This name also points to the Supreme Being as in control of destiny with an implicit idea of omniscience. Some present day Ailo people consider Se as another name for the Supreme Being. This appears a peculiarity of the Christian element, for many traditional believers are not aware of this. In traditional thought Se is originally the deity in control of destiny, and, destiny differing from man to man, makes the worship of Se intensely a personal affair. Though Se appears in some Aijlo personal names- Sema@o, Sefe, Senanu-yet Ai1lo traditional believers strongly affirm that such names have reference to their personal destiny worshipped as a personal deity akin to a guardian angel. But 6) Gaba, C.R., op. cit. App. A No. 2.</page><page sequence="11">74 C. R. Gaba some Aijlo Christians remark that Se in the names they give their children stands for the Supreme Being. Of course Se, as applied in a transferred sense to the Supreme Being who is the dispenser of destiny (Se), may be pardonable. But this appears a recent develop- ment in the religion of the Arjl people and is much more common with the Christian population. Yet Se is used to refer to the Supreme Being in genuine traditional thought but in quite a different way from the use some Ajlo Christians make of it. Whenever this occurs it is always compounded with gbo and always appears in the phrase "Mawu Segbo Lisa." In all probability Segbo and Lisa are not original Aijl words, but acquired during the westward journey of the Aijlo people to their present home. In the Fon language 7) Se is soul and gbo great or big. Segbo in Fon means the big or great Soul, and the Arjl people use it essentially to connote the idea of Great Destiny or Great Determiner of destiny. Some are of the opinion that Se is the Aijl for law, boundary or order, and without giving the derivative of gbo these people end up by translating Se as Destiny. This may be true; but Segbo, as being of Fon origin, fits in better because of the original Fon meaning and the adapted Aijl usage. Others think the original Fon is rather Sogbo and not Segbo. Doubtless Sogbo is Fon but may originally refer to the Fon thunder god So. Probably careless pronunciation of Segbo over years away from its original home and the practice of the more organized cult of So in Ailbland (note that Se is a strictly personal deity) may have suggested to some people that Sogbo and not Segbo is the original Fon word. Dr. Parrinder, who studied the Religion of the Fon of Dahomey at first hand, observes in an article in African Ideas of God edited by Dr. Edwin Smith, that "Mawu, as creator of souls, is called Mawuse or Segbo-Segbo" (p. 232). Lisa is a rare AUlo word for chameleon and the chameleon itself is a symbol of transitoriness in Arjloland because of its protec- tive coloration. But the Ailo people know Mawu as a constant being. Lisa cannot have easily originated in this way. It may be a corruption of the Yoruba Orise which means "Head-source" if Professor Idowu's discovery is valid. 8) Of course Yoruba words that have crept into the Ailo language frequently have "r" changed into "1" and an initial vowel may be omitted. For example the 7) See e.g. Parrinder E.G., West African Psychology, London 1951. 8) Idowu, E.B, Olodumare, God in Yoruba Belief 1962, 171.</page><page sequence="12">A Supreme Being among the A yl people of Ghana 75 Yoruba Iwori is Woli in AIb3 "Afa" divination. Mawu Segbo Lisa may, therefore, be rendered in English as "God, the Great Determiner of destiny, the Head-Source." Indeed, Segbo and Lisa are more praise names for the Supreme Being than other names. They are rarely used; even when they are used, it is mainly by the priests. (In over a hundred ritual recitals collected in A13oland and preserved in the London unpublished Ph. D. thesis of the author the phrase appeared in only one and once only, while "Mawu" alone appeared more than ten times). This is mainly the result of the purpose which praise names serve in Ablo traditional life. They are invocational and presuppose an organized worship, and the Aijl Supreme Being is not accorded organized worship. In fact the Arlo for "invocation" (amlafofo) really means "singing or reciting praises" during worship. Thus in Abloland it is only the lesser gods and the ancestors who have names which may be conveniently described as praise-names by which their presence is invoked during worship. Praise-names like Afisiafinola the Omnipresent, IJusikatXto, the Omnipotent, Nusianunyala the Omniscient and Amenuvela the Merciful, as used to describe the Supreme Being, many tradition- al believers affirm, originated with the dawn of Christianity and, indeed, are used only in Christian worship. However it would be wrong to suppose that the Supreme Being has not these attributes in Aij1 thought in the light of personal names like Mawunyegd or Mawuli which have already been mentioned. Some sayings also help to reveal some facts about the Ailo conception of a Supreme Being. "Mawu medina na dzoquameto o," "God never helps a sorcerer," was the spontaneous remark of a priest in Ajloga when he overheard a suspected sorcerer calling upon the name of the Supreme Being. Here the Supreme Being is pictured as a being in ethical relationship with man. "Mawu medzia vi wuna o," ("God can never destroy his own child"), affirms that the Supreme Being is a loving father who pardons. "La mato asike Mawue nyda tagbatsutsu ne," ("it is God who drives away the troublesome flies from the animal which has no tail") points to the providence of the Supreme Being. In other words, the Creator is not in A131h thought, an absentee God who has wound up the universe like a clock once and for all and allowed it to work on its own. He exercises a constant supervision over the universe and is in an intensely personal relationship with man.</page><page sequence="13">76 C. R. Gaba If the Ablo people believe that the Supreme Being is an ethica Being, a Judge in control of the moral order, this means he demands certain conduct from man: "God does not help a sorcerer". A sor- cerer in AUlb thought is a wicked person who does harm to his neighbours in situations in which his action is legally as well as morally wrong. In other words, for the Ablo man to be right with the Supreme Being he must of necessity be right with his fellow men. Then another belief of the Arlb people is that the lesser gods and the ancestors are the delegates of the Supreme Being to help man on his behalf. They have to carry man's petitions in prayer to the Supreme Being and bring back abundant life to earth. 9) So that another demand that the Supreme Being makes upon man is to fulfil his obligations first and foremost to his own tutelary deities and ancestors. No wonder the devout Atjlo traditional believer can never give up completely his tutelary deities in order to adopt those belonging to other social groups. The highest he can do is to add foreign known deities to his own pantheon. But where he is faced with intolerance from any religion, the pious Ailj traditional believer does not hesitate to reciprocate with the saying "The customs of one people are not meant (by God) to be observed by another people" (Du bubu menyia du bubu fe ko o). If by worship is meant an organized cult which involves priest- hood, shrines and temples, prescribed rituals and ceremonies, feasts and sacrifices directly given God, then there is no worship of the Supreme Being among the Ailo people at all. The people lay a very great emphasis on the invisible nature and the omni- presence of the Supreme Being. He is Spirit like the wind and never reveals his form to man. The AUlo people therefore have no corporeal representation made of him, with the result that throughout the length and breadth of Arjlland no images of Mawu exist. It naturally follows that there can never be any Mawu shrines and temples since these are primarily intended in Agloland to house the symbolic representations of the deities to which they are dedicated. It should also not be expected that one should find any organized priesthood of the Supreme Being in Ajlhland nor any special ceremonies, rituals, feasts and sacrifices in his honour. Thus, whenever one finds a group of people or individuals engaged in any formal activities involving a supernatural being in Ajlhland, it is never 9) Gaba, C.R., op. cit. App. B. passim.</page><page sequence="14">A Supreme Being among the A lo people of Ghana 77 the Supreme Being but either the lesser gods or the ancestors that are the objects of such attention. But if prayer alone constitutes worship, however simple this prayer may be, whether a single word spoken at any time, at any place, and in any manner that best suits the worshipper, then the Ablo people give the Supreme Being direct worship. "God!" (Mawu!) "If God wills I will recover" (ne Mawu di nam mahaya). These are samples of direct prayer offered God especially when the Arjl people feel the power of the lesser gods and the ancestors are of no avail. In short, the Supreme Being is the last court of appeal-the universe's prototype of the AJ13 A weamefia, the Paramount ruler, who, in the olden days, was veiled from the sight of all and sundry and seen only in very serious cases when divisional rulers were at their wits' end. Incidentally this seemingly "disrespectful" worship of the Supreme Being is weightier and more sincere than any elaborate one offered the lesser gods or the ancestors. For such prayers to the Supreme Being are final and very desperate attempts the failure of which, it is believed, brings destruction from which nothing else can save. In the very figurative language of the people, direct worship is offered God when one is suddenly inter- cepted and almost completely overpowered by highwaymen (ne adzo tso wd). This explains why Aijl prayers, as communion with the Supreme Being, are largely personal and casual and need no special cultic persons nor acts, which might delay succour. After all, in desperation spontaneity is very largely, if not always, the rule. So that, though the lower spirit powers may receive more elaborate worship than the Supreme Being in Aj1oland, and though these spirit powers may use their delegated authority independently of the Supreme Being, all the same, God is still Omnipotent in AUlo religious thought. Omnipotence in this context connotes the idea of God as the sole source of that power which his deputies, the lower spirit powers, may independently use. It also involves the idea that it is God alone who has power to help the distressed and the helpless when all other spirit powers have done the highest they can do for man but without success. There is also an indirect worship of the Supreme Being in Ar31oland where sacrifices are offered him. "Take it to the abode of Mawu that it may become abundant life to return to us" (Tsoe yi Mawu</page><page sequence="15">78 C. R. Gaba gbse woanye /agbe na mi, nunyonamea na va na mi loo!). "He has come here with a very big bottle of gin and a big sum of money. He has asked me to give them to you to be taken together with all things that destroy life to the abode of Mawu, the Creator, leave them there and in return bring him life abundantly. (Etso aha gda de atukpa deka, todzihae hee; dza gda ee nye yi bo de ahaa yu wbbe matso na wb natso ayi Mawu-4o-ame-4a fee, madimadiawo natsi afima dzi, didiawo na va na ye kekeke). 10) These two extracts come from prayers offered to the ancestors and a lesser god respect- ively. They affirm that the Supreme Being also receives offerings. Asked why these offerings could not be given directly to the Supreme Being, the priest of the deity Sui of the Loife clan in AIJl3gd remarked, "Why don't you yourself give the gift you have brought directly to Mama (his deity)? But you have asked me to do it on your behalf. As I am the servant of Mama11) so is Mama too the servant of Mawu. And any gifts to Mawu must pass through her by all means." In answer to the question why part of the gifts worshippers originally intend for Mama should be offered to the Supreme Being, the same priest said "The abundant life you want through this gift is right in the abode of the Supreme Being. Just as you cannot come before Mama without a votive offering, Mama too cannot go for the abundant life from the abode of the Supreme Being with empty hands." Then the priestess Logosi of Woe village further explained that when the lesser gods and the ancestors appeared before the Supreme Being to demand blessings, the votive gifts represented the worshippers on whose behalf such demands were made for worshippers themselves could not appear in person before the Supreme Being. These two ritual specialists are not alone in this conception of worship accorded the Supreme Being through the lesser gods and the ancestors. They, in fact, represent the majority view-that the Supreme Being receives part of all sacrifices to and he is also prayed to through the lesser gods and the ancestors because it is from him that these lower spirit powers receive all the good gifts which they shower on man.

The lower spirits are more vicegerents than sovereigns. In the conception of the Supreme Being here recorded, the Ai3lo people may not put on the same level as their own any such Being among other peoples, even of the same Eue cultural group, who is not similarly regarded. He may have the same name "Mawu," but when he has a corporeal representation made of him as Dr. Parrinder discovered at Agbomey in Dahomey, 12) or when he is paired with a wife and has children begotten in the human way as J. Spieth noticed in the Agu mountains of the Republic of Togo, 13) to the AI3Jl people, he is a Being lower in status to their Supreme Being. When a shrine is dedicated to him, as Nyame of the Ashanti people, and worship directly given him in a shrine, the A3lo people may hesitate to place such a High God on the same footing as their own. The High God may even belong to the "higher" religions, but if the worship accorded him looks inferior to that which in their thinking must be accorded the High God, the A3lo3 people waste no time in condemning it even if it is Chris- tianity. Once they see worship too much confined to special buildings they conclude the Being worshipped there cannot be the same as, and must be inferior to, the High God they know. But anyone who excludes the A3lo3 people from the worldwide conception of God as one but differently apprehended by various peoples, may be overlooking the representative remark made by one of their number when he was speaking, with particular reference to dreams, on the relationship between the Christian God and the AUl3 Mawu "Both are the same but for us (traditional believers) he is too big to appear in dreams." 14) 12) Parrinder, E.
