<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mirror, mirror, on the wall ...: Effacement in Georges Rodenbach's L'Ami des Miroirs Joyce O. Lowrie A peine me connais-je en ce d6sordre extreme: Me rencontrant en lui, je me cherche en moi-meme. Rotrou, Les Sosies Ovid depicts Narcissus quietly adoring his own reflection in a pool, a chiastic diptych undisturbed. Narcissus I reads, or worships, his "text," which could be labelled Narcissus II, with unequivocal admiration and desire. That anything should have gone wrong, that he should have found within his "mirror" anything or anyone other than "un autre lui-meme" (another self-same self), would have led to a different kind of conclusion to the narration. As Ovid states it, the "strange madness which afflicted the boy" simply proved Tiresias' prophecy: the boy would live to a ripe old age so long as he did not come to know himself.' But he did come to know himself in his reflection, and pined away, longing to possess that mimetic, or reflexive representation of himself. In L'Ami des miroirs, or The Friend of Mirrors, Georges Rodenbach's 19th-century version of the myth, "Nar- cissus" succumbs, as did Ovid's young man, to madness. But Rodenbach's hero does himself, as it were, in, by running headlong into his mirror, believing he will penetrate it. He dies as a consequence thereof. He is both created and effaced in his own image. Rodenbach's short story, which appeared in a posthumous collec- tion of tales entitled Le Rouet des brumes, was chosen by Pierre-Georges Castex for his Anthology of French Fantastic Tales,2 and recent defini- tions of the fantastic lead one to ponder how Rodenbach's text partici- pates in the genre itself. The element of the uncanny is denied from the start, for the events narrated are explained away by the insanity that increasingly besets "l'ami des miroirs." Because the visions the protagonist sees inside his mirrors are clinically categorized as the product of a paranoid and self-destructive imagination, they could be placed under the Todorovian rubric of "le fastastique expliqu'."3 Far more important is Rodenbach's use of ambiguity and of proleptic discourse to undercut textual sequentiality and narrative progression. Rodenbach brings about, in various ways, the collapse of differences in both his enoncis (what is narrated) and in his enonciations (how the text is narrated). The short story begins with a universal principle: "Madness," the narrator says, "is frequently nothing other than the paroxysm of a sensa- tion that originally appeared to be purely artistic and subtle" (p. 313). The narrator had a friend who died dramatically in a sanatorium, we are told, in a manner that he will soon relate. "In the beginning" (4 forigine)," we read in italicized type, this friend loved mirrors, nothing more. But then he begins to be afraid of them, for they haunt him, they reflect him poorly, they take his life away from him. The narrator suggests to his friend that 63</page><page sequence="2">this is perhaps due to the fact that those mirrors were lying, that we are all ugly because of the mirror's ugliness. "Narcissus" (as I will name the protagonist, for he is called nothing other than "mon ami," by the narrator) concludes that the shop-front mirrors in which he sees himself reflected are poor in quality and that he should buy expensive mirrors that are "true." Acquiring a growing taste for exotic looking-glasses, he surrounds himself with a collection of the best ones he can find. He loves his Louis XV and Louis XVI mirrors, "dont I'ovale d'or fan6 cerclait le miroir comme une couronne de feuilles d'octobre la margelle d'un puits .... " (whose faded golden frames encircled the mirrors as a crown of October leaves surrounds the edge of a well .... p. 315). "Narcissus" seems to become content. He never goes out, but encloses himself within his house of mirrors. During a visit, the narrator asks him about women: does he not miss following them down the streets, as he sometimes used to? "L'Ami" replies that each mirror is like a street, that in each mirror he sees the image of women whom he does follow, although they never allow him to get near. After this conversation, the "friend" loses his sense of identity. He can no longer recognize himself in his mirror but tips his hat to his own image, as if he were a stranger. When the narrator visits him for the last time, "Narcissus" seems happy again. He is "surrounded by a crowd," he says, "-where everyone resembles me" (p. 317). Shortly thereafter, we are told, it becomes necessary to hospitalize him "pour quelques excentri- cites qui avaient caus6 des rassemblemments et un scandale a ses fen tres" (for several eccentricites of a scandalous sort that had caused people to gather at his windows.) He leaves quietly when he is made to go to the psychiatric ward. He misses only his collection of mirrors, but soon grows fond of the one that hangs in his hospital room: he sees therein the images of women who will love him. But his illness grows worse; he sometimes becomes hot, sometimes cold: "It probably feels good inside the mirror," he says. "One of these days I should enter it" (p. 318). Some time later he is found with his head smashed in, bloodied, gasping his final breath. He had lunged into the mirror, says the narrator, "in order to accost the women whom he had followed for so long, in order to mingle with the crowd where everyone resembles him-at last!" (p. 318, underlining added). The idea of effacement, which Dorothy Kelly describes as being the most constant element in Freud's, Todorov's, and Derrida's notions of the uncanny,4 means that the text puts its own pre-established limits into question: in Freud effacement occurs when the repressed and the con- scious intermingle; in Todorov it occurs when the outside and inside worlds are mixed (as in the themes of the "je"), or when societal or sexual laws are transgressed (as in the themes of the "tu"); and in Derrida effacement equals dissemination and the undecidable.5 In her own study of Charles Nodier's Inks de las Sierras, Kelly shows how all of the catego- ries of opposition in the text collapse or bring about "nondisjunctions" of dualistic differences. While the reader's inability to decide between fic- tion and reality is an initial state of affairs in Nodier's text, in the end, Kelly states, the ambiguous co-existence of both the canny constative and the 64</page><page sequence="3">uncanny performative discourse effaces the limits between the two (p. 53). Not only does effacement function in Rodenbach's text, but an appropriate metaphor for the structural disposition of effacement in L'Ami des miroirs is the serpent Ouroboros: he devours his own tale. The end of the tale is found in its beginning, and the beginning in the end (a chiastic statement in itself). The title of Rodenbach's short story already sets the stage for ambiguity. "L'Ami des miroirs," "the friend of mirrors," can be inter- preted as having the emphasis placed either upon the protagonist who becomes enamoured of mirrors, or upon the mirrors themselves of whom the protagonist becomes a friend. The mirrors attain anthropomorphic capabilities and adopt the protagonist as their friend: "l'ami des miroirs" is, at the same time, "'Tami des miroirs." A third possibility points the finger at the narrator, for it is he who refers, thoughout, to "mon ami," never once endowing his "friend" (or himself, for that matter) with a name. Like the mirrors he criticizes, it is as if he had vampiristically absorbed his "friend's" identity, his very name, into himself. Even the title of the collection resounds ambiguously: Le Rouet des brumes, (Mist's Spinning Wheel), evokes the image of fog, of uncertainty, of that which is neither dark nor light. After starting his text with the general statement about madness and its relationship to its having begun as something that is "artistic" and "subtle," the narrator tells us: "I had a friend who was placed in a sanatorium, where he died dramatically of an illness that I will soon relate, the origin of which began in a harmless way and by means of remarks that seemed to be those of a poet." Who speaks? Who relates things in an artistic, subtle, and dramatic way? Who makes remarks that seem to be "those of a poet"? The protag- onist, a rich dilettante who goes berserk, or a seemingly harmless and supposedly objective narrator who must earn a living by means of his words? The narrator is using auto-referentiality to call attention to his craft, to writing. He spins a tale that is contained, in fact, in miniaturized form, in the first paragraph: once upon a time the narrator had a poetic friend who went mad. He was sent to a sanatorium where he died an artistic, subtle and dramatic death. All is there, including the narrator's relationship to his "friend." The words "artistic," "subtle," and "poetic" are ambiguous in that they are used as referents to the "friend's" manner of being. But they can also be applied to him who narrates, for his friend died in a manner, he says, "que je dirai tantot" (that I will soon narrate). The narrator is a teller of tales, of tales in which fiction and "reality" are confounded, chiastically, as in juxtaposed sets of mirrors. Since a condensed version of the tale is contained in the first paragraph, the end of the text is thus contained in its beginning. Omega is found within Alpha's devouring mouth. But the narration begins again in the second paragraph. In its entirety the para- graph reads: "A forigine, il eut le goit des miroirs; rien de plus" (In the beginning, he liked mirrors, nothing more.) In the beginning was the word, or the narrative, and in the end the tale begins all over again. 65</page><page sequence="4">Creation and effacement meet when, first, the tale has been told, and second, when "l'ami" joins the crowd where "everyone resembles him": as he saw himself, in life, as part of a crowd, so is he also part of the great crowd of the dead in the end, when his life is terminated in his own image. Rodenbach's protagonist also lives again and again, each time the mirror of the text is contemplated by the reader. Effacement is the structural disposition of this text just as repetition, according to J. Hillis Miller, forms part of the structure of narrative.6 The stamp of madness and of effacement is placed upon this text from start to finish, for it begins with the word "la folie" and ends with the adverb "enfin." "Enfin" might well be construed as a pun: divided, "en fin" contains both a preposition and a noun that relate both to death and to the conclusion of the text. In "the end" effacement and dissolution are present, and disjunction between opposing or antithetical entities is oblit- erated. To say that "a equals non-a" is madness, but madness is both the subject and the object of this text. The relationship between the narrator and the object of his narra- tion is a symbiotic one. In order to explain, at the start, the fact that his "friend" had become afraid of staying alone in his house, where objects had turned hostile to him, and that he was, therefore, planning to leave town, the narrator says: "Since he was free as well as rich, it was only natural that he could afford to be capricious in his decisions." This seem- ingly guileless statement betrays a sub-text of jealousy on the narrator's part. The remark is double-edged. It reveals the protagonist's wealth, on the one hand, and the narrator's negative judgment, or jealousy, on the other. As a writer, he himself is doubtlessly not rich; he doubtlessly cannot afford to be capricious in his decisions. He is the chiastic, or mirror image of his "friend." In describing his fear of looking into certain mirrors, "l'ami" uses the following simile: "It was like water that was going to open up and then close in upon me!" Water. The horizontal axis of pool, well, or pond, is the medium contemplated by Narcissus. The correlation between mirrors and water is made several times in L'Ami des miroirs, the intertextual referent to classical Narcissus being obvious in the description of the Louis XV and XVI mirrors: their "faded golden frames encircled the mirrors as a crown of October leaves surrounds the edge of a well. .. ." Around Ovid's clear pool "was a grassy sward, kept ever green by the nearby waters; encircling woods sheltered the spot from the fierce sun, and made it always cool."7 Not only is classical Narcissus reflected in Rodenbach's text, but the words "faded" and the allusion to "October leaves" surround- ing, wreath-like, the edge of a well, denote cooler climes, the termination of the year, and, proleptically, the termination of "the friend's" life. To equate, metaphorically, mirrors that have hard surfaces, with water, whose surface is permeable, is a natural thing to do, for both are reflective media. But for the protagonist to confound the two and to think that the mirror will close in upon him, or swallow him up, is to efface the distinction between the tenor and vehicle of metaphor. Both mirror and water are the same in his mind, and the distinction between them becomes effaced. The hard and the soft surfaces melt, ambiguously, into one. 66</page><page sequence="5">The positive, or horizontal axis of water, a medium that is life- giving and creative, is equated with its opposite, a negative, or vertical axis in which Narcissus believes he will descend and be swallowed up. Mirrors are water; they will, he believes, "close up over him." As Gerard Genette says in "Complexe de Narcisse," "water is the locus of all betrayals and of all inconsistencies: in the reflection that it proposes, Narcissus is unable to recognize himself without disquietude, nor love himself without danger."8 The role the narrator plays throughout Rodenbach's text only helps "l'ami" to confuse the horizontal with the vertical axis. He is only too understanding of his "friend's" plight. When he comments upon his "friend's" initial decision to leave town he says: I was not surprised, knowing my friend to be sensitive, knowing, besides, what impressions can be created upon one's return to one's place, within closed rooms, amidst the dust, the musty odor, the confusion, the melan- choly one feels for things that seem to have died a bit during one's absence. Oh, the sadness of evenings of jubilation! Evenings of return, after the forgetfulness one experiences while being away. It seems as if all of one's sorrows that had remained at home come out to greet us.... (p. 314) Cheerful thoughts, these! What we do not know, for the narrator cleverly avoids telling us, is whether these words were actually uttered to his "friend." By means of rhetoric addressed in constative language, the narrator subtly evades this question and creates ambiguity. But we may surmise that since he, in fact, uses direct discourse with his "friend" in many places in the text, the lugubrious intonations of the statements quoted above were expressed to, or at least understood by, the returnee. Because his friend decides not to leave town, and upon a chance encounter claims to feel ill, the narrator wishes to express his good intentions by telling his "friend" that he looks amazingly well. The protag- onist replies that, on the contrary, mirrors of all kinds prove the opposite: "I go out. I think I'm well, cured even. But mirrors watch me. ... They live off of their reflections. They lie in wait of passers-by. ... It is perhaps they who steal from us our healthy coloring. It's from having given them our living color that we have become pale.... The health we possessed is lost in them like lovely make-up in water .. ." (p. 314). The vampiristic reversal between "friend" and "mirror," as well as between "friend" and "narrator" is revealed here, for these statements apply to both. Instead of returning a verisimilitudinous representation of health to the onlooker, the mirrors (and the narrator) become Dracula- like, draining the lifeblood from him who looks at his reflections therein. The narrator uses vampiristic language, reinforcing what he has heard his "friend" say: "Everyone," he retorts, "is ugly in those mirrors. One sees oneself deformed, pale, or livid, with bloodless or violet lips.... One perceives oneself as being knock-kneed or obese, too tall or too fat, as in the concave or convex mirrors of a fair. One is always ugly therein. But they lie. And we are ugly from their ugliness, and pale from their illness ..." (p. 315). The adjectives "deformed," "pale," "livid," "blood- 67</page><page sequence="6">less," "violet," and "illness" connote death. Using mortuary imagery, the narrator simply repeats, or reflects, what "Narcissus" had just said before. "Narcissus" reacts, but instead of becoming depressed, he buys expensive mirrors and surrounds himself with them. The narrator de- scribes them: "Some of them," he says, "had turned greenish with time. One looked into them as if they were sheets of water." The narrator himself is confounding the horizontal, or life-giving axis, with the vertical, or death-producing brackish color green in order to evoke immersion or a plunge into the dismal waters of effacement. Because "Narcissus" seems happy in his looking-glass labyrinth that communicates as if the mirrors were streets (and which consequently reflect the labyrinthian structure of the text itself in which one reflection leads to another), and because he seems detached and calm in his happi- ness, the narrator tests him by trying-to make him return to what he calls a "reality of the most prosaic sort." He does so by asking his friend about the opposite sex: "And what about women in this total confinement of yours, you who liked them, followed them, even, down the streets?" While "Narcissus" replies that his mirrors are full of women, of all types of women whom he does follow, it is at this moment that a crucial turning-point in the text occurs: "I'ami" loses consciousness of who he is. As he passes in front of his mirrors he no longer recognizes himself. Instead of seeing a reflection, he sees "the physical reality of a human being." A turnabout has taken place; his self, and the representation of himself in the mirror, exchange places. But this reversal leads immediately to dissemination: "And due to so many juxtaposed mirrors facing one another, it happened that the single silhouette of the solitary man was multiplied into infinity, it ricocheted everywhere, engendered, cease- lessly, a new counterpart, increased to the proportions of an innumerable crowd that was much more disquieting by being composed, in its entirety, of twins, copied from the original one who remained isolated and sepa- rated from them by who knows what kind of emptiness ... ." (p. 315) When the narrator visits his "friend" for the last time, "l'ami" seems happy, for he is involved in his multiple imagery that seems to reverber- ate, "like a voice in a grotto, into a thousand echos." Intertextual echoes occur here too, since Echo is one of the many nymphs who fall in love with Narcissus. It becomes necessary, soon after, to lock up the narrator's "friend" due to the "eccentricities" that had been occurring at the win- dows of his house. Although the reader is never told directly, one might assume that "l'ami" had been exposing himself to his neighbors. The transgression of societal and sexual laws forms part of the idea of efface- ment in Todorovian terminology. The Freudian implications of this text follow the reversals noted previously. They remain consistent with both the inonces and the enonci- ations of dyadic oppositions and ambiguities. The repressed and the conscious intermingle in the uncanny visions that are both seen as well as desired. While one would expect water to be a feminine principle, and for immersion to represent either immersion into femininity or into the satis- fying reality of alterity, the image of water is nefarious, instead. It becomes equated with death, with the imagery of being drowned or 68</page><page sequence="7">swallowed up. It becomes, in other words, an image of the vagina dentata. The question the narrator himself asks about women (a jealous, if not vengeful question, it would seem,) brings about a dispersion of the identity of "Narcissus." What "l'ami" had perhaps secretly wished to see was the beautiful image of a male. His hidden or repressed desire was for sameness, that is, for maleness. It is shortly after the narrator perversely asks his question about women that his "ami" loses his notion of what mirrors are about. "My friend," the narrator says, "no longer understood reflections. Not only did he consider his own reflected person to be a stranger, but instead of seeing a visage, it seemed to him that the mirror proferred the physical reality of a human being. And due to the presence of so many mirrors, juxtaposed to each other and facing one another, it happened that the solitary man's silhouette was multiplied into infinity." The series of alliterative and sibilant s, ch, and z sounds that the narrator uses to describe this diffusion of identity is striking: "I1 se trouva que la seule silhouette du solitaire fut multipliee A l'infini, ricocha partout, engendra sans cesse un nouveau sosie, s'accrut aux proportions d'une foule innombrable, d'autant plus inqui6tante que tous semblaient jumeaux, copies sur le premier qui demeurait isol6 et s6par6 d'eux par on ne sait quel vide .. ." We are reminded of Racine's Orestes. His madness, his loss of identity is expressed through sibilant s's. Shortly after asking: "Est-ce Pyrrhus qui meurt? et suis-je Oreste enfin?" (Is it Pyrrhus who is dying? And am I Orestes, after all?) (Andromaque, V, 1. 1568), he succumbs to total madness and wonders, in that famous line, what demons, what serpents Hermione is dragging behind her as she embraces Pyrrhus: "Pour qui sont ces serpents qui sifflent sur vos totes?" (For whom are those serpents destined that hiss above your heads? 1. 1638). Significantly, Orestes, too, uses the imagery, in his final words, of being devoured: "Better than you, thankless Hermione knows the art of ripping me apart/ And unto her I proffer, in order that she may, at last, devour it, my heart" (11. 1643-44). The function of the narrator in "L'Ami des miroirs" is a decisive one. Not only is it he who narrates, but every intervention he makes in what he wishes to appear as his friend's "behalf," provokes a reaction that leads "Narcissus" further and further down the abyss of final effacement. One of the last statements "Narcissus" makes to the narrator before being confined to the psychiatric hospital is: "You see! I am no longer alone. I was too lonely before. But friends, they are such strangers, they are so different from us! Now I am living amidst a crowd-where everyone resembles me" (p. 317). Is it possible that the sub-text of this short story is one of desire that is most "subtle" and "artistic"? "Narcissus" has, perhaps, come to desire the narrator himself, his own "friend," and is rebuffed by him (or the other way around). His "friend" turns out not to be his friend, for he asks pernicious questions and is also an alter ego, different from himself. He loses himself, therefore, in an imaginary crowd in which there are no opposites, in which there is no alterity between the "I" and the "you." "Narcissus" therefore exposes himself to a crowd of people who assemble at his windows, thereby creating a scandal. He can no longer tell the difference between the outside and the inside worlds. 69</page><page sequence="8">One might surmise that the narrator who had asked the question about women at the start of this mad adventure, was, himself, jealous of his "friend's" previous predilection for the opposite sex: previously "l'ami" had, in "fact," followed women down the streets. The narrator's revenge, therefore, is to lead "Narcissus," step by step, down the path in which he will desire sameness, and then frustrate that desire. It is shortly after this that "l'ami" is interned and becomes progressively ill. In a feverish state he will reflect physical ambiguity (an objective correlative of psychic ambi- guity), for one moment he is too hot, the next too cold. It is only within the mirror that it must "feel good," he says. Heat and coolness are intertextu- ally woven into the text from Ovid's description of Narcissus' pool: "encircling woods sheltered the spot from the fierce sun, and made it always cool" (The Metamorphoses, p. 85). But Rodenbach has his Narcis- sus become both hot and cold. As he states in another of his short stories, L'Amour et la Mort, Eros and Thanatos, heat and coldness are interre- lated: "If so many lovers wish to die and do, in fact, perish a bit more each day while they are still in love, it means that love and death are related by means of analogies, by means of subterranean corridors that communi- cate. One leads to the other. One refines and exacerbates the other" (Le Rouet des brumes, p. 17). The narrator is not only vampiristic; he is retributive as well. Of the inexpensive mirrors he had said: "We are ugly from their ugliness, pale from their illness." Because a mirror not only takes, but also gives back, it is as if the narrator had imparted his own "ugliness," his own "illness" to "Narcissus." The narration reflects its own function, for the narrative's 6nonc6 is about taking and, chiastically, giving back; it is about writing and speaking and interpreting and influencing. The reader reads the text as a mirror reflects and influences its reader. L'Ami des miroirs is auto- referential in that it reflects writing, for in the beginning the narrator refers to the story he is going to narrate; it reflects voices, for a mirror is compared to voices that resound in a grotto with "a thousand echoes"; and it reflects conversations that are as elaborate as a Louis XV mirror. To describe his "friend's" subtle ways of speaking, the narrator says: "He was a unique conversationalist . . . , abundant albeit precious. His words unfolded into the air with ornamented phrases that frequently ended up in the realm of the unknown" (p. 315). The narrator is describing his own baroque style. Although not abundant, his phrases are "ornamented and end up in the realm of the unknown." Effacement reveals itself, once again, in the fact that the style of the narrator and that of his subject are similar. Repetition as well as inversion are the order of this text. The end is in the beginning, male and female are confounded, mirrors not only give back but also imbibe images, and the very name, or identity, of the protagonist is "ingested" by a vampiristic narrator who takes the mirrors' side of the matter. He sucks in the identity of the protagonist so as to create a tale of his own. He becomes to his subject what Echo becomes to Narcissus, a voice crying in the wilderness, or in Ezio Pellizer's felicitous phrase, "an example of 'specular vocality."'' That the narrator does create a narrative of his own is the case: even 70</page><page sequence="9">though "l'ami" dies, the narrator lives on to tell his tale. While effacement is signalled in the very process through which Rodenbach has his narrator and his subject intermingle ambiguously, making of this a most modem text in which disjunctions cancel themselves out in a vertiginous interplay of dualistic mimeticisms and alterities, the process itself calls attention to both parts of the chiastic equations. Rodenbach could not have had his narrator do this if, in the beginning as well as in the end, the word were not there to build and sustain labyrinthian images and structures that do, in fact, make sense. Wesleyan University NOTES 1. Ovid, The Metamorphoses, (New York, Penguin Books, 1955), p. 83. 2. Castex, Pierre-Georges, Anthologie du conte fantastique franqais (Paris: Jose Corti, 1963), pp. 313-318. All translations in this paper are my own. Page references to L'Ami des miroirs are made, throughout, to the Castex volume because it is more accessible than is Le Rouet des brumes (Paris: Societe d'Editions litteraires et artistiques, Librairie Paul Ollendorff, 1901), pp. 27-35. 3. Castex, in fact, gives a clinical explanation when he says, in a brief introduc- tion to Rodenbach's short story, that the author of the text (compared to Edgar Allan Poe's William Wilson), "does not give the impression, as does the American writer, of participating in the folly of his character: he simply observes him and describes, clinically, with minute slowness, the successive stages of his pathetic decline." Castex first confuses author with narrator, then fails to see the role the narrator plays in the successive stages of his "friend's" mental deterioration. The same conclusion is arrived at by two other critics. In "La Folie speculaire," P. Pelckmans says: "Throughout the short story [the narrator] adopts the tone of a clinical physician which has him remain a stranger to the adventure he relates" (Cahiers internationaux de symbolisme, no. 42-44, 1981, p. 165). In "Le Monde imaginaire de Georges Rodenbach," Hiroo Toyama says: "Throughout the narration of this short story, the author is nothing other than a dispassionate observer of this con- duct: he describes his character as being mentally deranged" (Etudes de langue et littirature franqaise, vol. 42, March 1983, p. 59. 4.
