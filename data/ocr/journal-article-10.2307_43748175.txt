<plain_text><page sequence="1">Episcopal and Anglican History: 1968: An Annotated Bibliography Edited by Frank E. Sugeno THE historical of Anglican YEAR publications 1968 and Episcopal seem s in to the have history field harvested has of religion not a shared bumper but in the crop the study ex- of historical publications in the field of religion but the study of Anglican and Episcopal history has not shared in the ex- panding productivity. The trend of recent years to view religion within a broad social-cultural context in contrast to the traditional ecclesiastical-confessional focus continued unabated in 1968, judging from the publications that came under the scrutiny of the compilers of this annual bibliography. Matters Episcopal and Anglican did not go unnoticed within this trend but were subsumed under rubrics other than those traditionally applied to them. Publications of Epis- copal divines and traditional Anglican formularies were reprinted in anthologies that were compiled for college religion courses or repub- lished to stock academic libraries which have not until recently shown any enthusiasm for such items. Episcopalian faith and order came under the analytic scrutiny of ecumenically oriented students of history or the new sociologically oriented group of historians. The paucity of entries of a scholarly, historical character that deal directly with the Episcopal Church testify to the changing focus within which religion is being viewed by students of religious history. As in the preceding annual bibliographies the compilers have attempted to scan all the major periodicals and publications of the past year and to supplement the previous bibliographies with en- tries that escaped notice. Needless to say, the bibliography does not pretend to be comprehensive but aspires to provide sufficient coverage of relevant historical publications that it will serve as a useful tool for students of history.

New England Quar., June 1968. - In this excellent essay, Professor Goodwin criticizes the dominant school in American Puritan studies of Perry Miller, Alan Heimert et al, which sees Arminianism creeping into early eighteenth-century New England via covenant theology. For Goodwin who emphasizes the</page><page sequence="13">ANNUAL BIBLIOGRAPHY 189 continuity of Puritan thought and experience, Edwards and the "Great Awakening" are seen as the climax of Puritan Calvinism and its firmest fruit. Continuous commitment to Calvinism up to the mid-century mark is, doctrinally at least, convincingly argued. Arminianism is seen as a later and less threatening foreign import. The essay does not deal with the relation of this constant to changes in piety and polity. A lucid essay marked by close attention to pri- mary sources. j.f.w. Grimes, Alan P.

The writing deals primarily with Hazlitťs four years in the United States (1783-1787) during which time he engaged in theological debate with the Anglican priest, Samuel Parker of Trinity Church, Boston, and supported the cause of James Freeman of King's Chapel in his defection from Anglicanism to Unitarianism.

M.H.S.JR. Hollinger, David A. "Perry Miller and Philosophical History," History and Theory , Number 2, 1968. - The author shows the pro- fundity and sophistication of Miller's historiographical stance which rejected simple realism on the one hand the capricious relativism on the other. Hollinger notes Miller's fascination with the central problem of the relationship of the human spirit with "reality," the constant struggle of the conscious mind with the "Mechanical," the tensions between the subjective and the objective, the "terror" of deus absconditus and rational understanding. Miller emerges from this study as an artist for whom form held priority over content. Miller's art, however, is seen as "epistemologically and profoundly historical in character." "He, Miller, wanted a harder relativism in which the forms are vitally important and are rigorously constructed out of the historian's world view to help him perceive historical reality." This essay should do much to correct facile criticisms of Miller's great contribution to the history of religion in America. J.F.W. Holmes, David L. "Fathers and Brethren," Church Hist., Sept. 1968. - A thorough, fully documented argument shows how fondly American Protestantism, especially of the "low" variety, applied the term "father" to its ministers who were elders or founding fathers of congregations or movements, until the term became sectarianized [sic] by Anglo-Catholics and Romanists. If the argument is to be faulted, it is for cutting off the practice among Methodists too early; California Methodists reveled in it in the 1850's and later.

The author, by means of fresh and careful examination of the original sources, illumines the similarities and dissimilarities between these two celebrated antagonists. He discovers the main point of contention to have been "the central event in re- demption, Christ's incarnation." Both Cotton and Williams believed that correct exegesis could point the way to the New Jerusalem. For both men typology provided the means of prophesying this future in the light of the past. In the case of Williams it was a "spiritual- ized typology" which initiated their conflict.

New England Quar., Sept. 1968. - By a fresh examination of the journals, the author shows how Emerson's dynamic and dialectic concept of the universe as both spiritual and material provides the key to his epistemology as well as his metaphysics. Emerson emerges as something more than a Platonic realist, whose "spiderweb" system (rather than "skyscraper" system) is brought into much clearer focus by this essay. J.f.w. Peirce, David C. "Jonathan Edwards and the 'New Sense' of Glory." New England Quar., March 1968. - By means of an examina- tion of the Personal Narrative, the author notes two forms of piety in Edwards' thought: the way of order and the way of enlargement. The first is derived from the Puritan concern for conformity to the will of the Sovereign God; the second invokes nature and the God of space under the powerful influence of Newtonian physics. Not burdened by older restraints, though still within the Puritan frame, Edwards is seen as advocating a new sense of glory which is a spe- cific response to the "rapprochement between God and nature." The author claims that it is these two types of piety rather than discon- tinuity between theology and philosophy which mark Edwards' thought. J.f.w. Pilcher, George William (ed.).

It is a picture book with an ample text, based upon historical research. There is no mention of Nicholar Ferrar and Little Gidding, but there is note made of the king's piety. The author depicts the king, in prison, reading Hammond's sermons and Hooker's Polity.

University, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 1968. Pp. xi, 354. $10.00. - The Archbishop has writ- ten a fascinating biography of the son of Mary Stuart and the suc- cessor of Elizabeth Tudor. The author portrays James sympathetically and writes that "No more steadfast protector of die Protestant Church of England by law established ever wore the English Crown." He sees him as being strongly theological. "The idea of conversion warmed him." There are pedigree charts. There is a select bibliogra- phy. And a good index. j.e.b. McGrade, Arthur S. "The Public and the Religious in Hooker's Polity ," Church Hist., Dec. 1968. - It is convincingly argued that the entire Polity is a well-planned discussion of "the twin ques- tions: What does it mean for a community to be Christian? and What is involved in Christianity's becoming the religion of a com- munity?" (415) Book V, often accused of being rambling (Craig) or a commentary on the Prayer Book (Marshall), is shown to be an or- ganized discussion of the theme, "the place of religion in the ordinary world" (410). Thus conceived as a coherent whole, Hooker's argu- ment is said to bear on our own problems of religious unity and ideological politics" (420) indirectly but importantly. A must for literary, historical, and theological interpreters of Hooker. w.a.c. Pfatteicher, Philip H. "John Austin: A Liturgist Worth Remem- bering." Worship.

Pp. 596. $9.50. - Knox is characterized in this book as "one of the most ruthless and successful revolutionary leaders in his- tory." Ridley emphasizes Knox's power to effect revolution and the contribution he made, despite his intolerance, to the struggle for human freedom. "He taught the people that they had a duty to fight for the right irrespective of national allegiance and the orders of their governments. Modem democracy is grounded upon this principle which Knox deduced from the texts of Exodus and the Book of Kings." A detailed, scholarly readable biography with excel- lent bibliography and good index, j.e.b. Routley, Erik R. "Percy Dearmer: 20th Century Hymnologist." The Hymn, July 1968. - An expert assesses the contribution of one whom he says "managed to prise hymnody loose from the tradition of in-group vernacular . . . into a very healthy maturity." Particular attention to Dearmer's work on the English Hymnal and Songs of Praise, m.h.s.jr. Scarisbrick, J. J. Henry VIII. Berkeley and Los Angeles: Uni- versity of California Press, 1968. Pp. xiv, 561. $10.95. - This superb biography, scholarly and eminently readable, virtually displaces all former biographies of Henry Tudor. Its treatment of the royal divorce is noteworthy in itself and will be discussed for years to come. Its assessment of the Reformation is always interesting and fair. The portrait of Henry is full-scale, emphasizing the complexities of the individual and the importance of those around him. Scarisbrick sees Henry as both conservative and radical on religious issues, gradually moving towards Protestantism, but basically anti-clerical. Bibliogra- phy and index. j.e.b. Trueblood, D. Elton.
