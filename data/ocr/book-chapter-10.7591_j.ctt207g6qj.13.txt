<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  E I G H T   Early Texts :  "The Eye Altering Alters All"  Blake's early work, as we have suggested, approaches the relationship between text and culture in terms of an intertextual rather than  canonical model. But at the same time he conceives this work as 'labor'  and not simply 'dissemination. '  Thus, the earliest texts are characterized  by two apparently different tendencies. They invite us to see experience  through the eyes of an individual subject (be it 'Blake' or someone else) ,  and yet as intertextual constructions they make us aware that the insights  thus produced are perspectives. Taken together, these tendencies pro­ duce reading as a cultural critique that is still a hermeneutic , an applica­ tion of intertextual reading to the process of understanding ourselves  through others . This hermeneutic requires not only that 'Blake' reread  his own writing from the perspective of characters like Thel, but also  that we situate our more contemporary readings by experimentally iden­ tifying with 'Blake . '  The two tendencies , located in different subsectors  of the early work, put reader and writer in a position like the one articu­ lated by Kierkegaard in his Point of View. Though making the text a  transformational surface that generates constant rereading, they do not  allow intertextuality to become an impersonal semiosis in which we can  evade our position as subjects in the play of signifiers . Thus the Songs,  which bring together a multitude of small poems in a structure that  suggests complete relativism,  must be read in conjunction with early  poems like Visions and Thel, which focus on a single protagonist. Doing  so encourages us to organize them experimentally from subject positions  suggested by these narratives, so as to give a direction to the displace­ ment of one text by another. Conversely, the longer poems, which seem  to bring their stories to a conclusion and to tell them from a fixed point  2 2 1   </page> <page sequence="2"> 2 2 2  The Supplement o f  Reading  of view, must be read with a sensitivity to an intertextual construction  that puts any narrative writer or reader might construct out of them  under erasure.  Accordingly, this chapter looks at the earliest texts as  producing intersecting cognitive structures that reshape our reading of  the work as a whole. These structures in turn find an epistemological  basis in the early tractates. For although these texts are sometimes seen  as evidence of uncompromising idealism, 1 in their emphasis on "experi­ ence" and "experiment" they come closest to Godwin's sense that mean­ ing can be ascertained "only by experiment," to a paradoxically romantic  symbiosis of empiricism and idealism.  The Collection as Intertext: Songs of Innocence and of Experience  To read the Songs is to encounter difficulties analogous to those pro­ duced by the movement earlier described from signs to propositions.  Individually simple, they become ambiguous at the point where we try to  connect them so as to make them yield a narrative or an argument.  Instead of being an expression of the system, their very format as a  collection that can be put together from more than one perspective  raises the problem of system : of how parts are organized into wholes and  of how evidence is generalized into explanatory structures. Indeed, the  history of the Songs emphasizes the status of writing as 'text' rather than  'book,' and our reading becomes a further part of that history. For Blake  initially included three of the Innocence poems in his satirical An Island in  the Moon. He then published the more homogeneous Songs of Innocence,  which abandons contrapuntal construction to seal the vision of inno­ cence in the purity of lyric . But he then unbound the book of Christian  pastoral by adding the Songs of Experience and issuing the poems in  nineteen different arrangements. In adding the Songs of Experience and  then further poems like "To Tirzah,'' Blake himself seems to have read  his text in more than one way : in terms of the Swedenborgian pietism of  Innocence issued separately, in terms of the antinomian radicalism of The  Marriage, and in terms of a deeply pessimistic antinaturalism. That he  continued to issue Innocence separately and to reproduce his early texts  alongside Milton and Jerusalem suggests that he saw these perspectives as  displacing and not replacing each other.  Where the form of prophecy arouses our hermeneutic impulses , the  collection from the outset stimulates heuristic reading. Its title indicates  an issue we can follow in our reading, but the poems are not about  innocence and experience in the sense of having as their content an  1 Martin Nurmi, William Blake (London: Hutchinson, 1 975) ,  p. 52 .   </page> <page sequence="3"> Early Texts 2 23   answer to the question of  how these states are related. Rather, they are  about the schemas we construct to answer this question. Any book we  might construct to fit the poems into a canon ('Blake's' or ours) is thus  displaced by its inscription in the shifting combinatory network of the  collection.  Among the more obvious ways of organizing the poems is a  serial reading in which experience inevitably succeeds innocence, or a  static juxtaposition of matching poems which sees the two states as irrec­ oncilable ways of looking at life .  But the replacement of a linear struc­ ture by that of an array, along with the fact that the subtitle describes  innocence and experience as contrary 'states' and not as successive stages  of life ,  frees us from a mimetic submission to the way the text unfolds. It  thus allows the reader to assume a more active role in producing some­ thing not actually in the collection. What we produce may be the syn­ thesis elsewhere sketched by Blake as the culmination of a progression  through contraries . But it may also be a questioning of whether reading  can indeed re-form reality. Considering the poems from the subject  position of 'Blake, '  or from a more sceptical perspective, we are forced to  recognize the limits of subjectively constructed readings . On the other  hand, because of the identification with a speaking subject modeled for  us in other poems of this period, this very process of intertextual dis­ placement remains part of a hermeneutic in which different positions  are experienced and not simply textualized .  We can begin with a dialectical reading of the Songs that generates  from its static oppositions the synthesis that Blake later called "organized  innocence . "  Such a dialectic would have five stages. Beginning with a  naive reading of the Innocence poems as Christian pastorals that celebrate  a childlike vision, we would reconsider them from the perspective of an  experience, traces of which are already present in the Innocence poems.  The disclosure of innocence as a perceptual surface would then pro­ duce, as a pessimistic counterreaction,  a naive reading of Experience in  which it is identified with 'reality . '  But reconsidering the Experience  poems through their counterparts would similarly disclose experience to  be a state of limited vision. As in Platonic dialectic, the negation of our  various pictures of reality would lead finally to a higher innocence that  would be produced in the consciousness of the reader.  Our first reading of Innocence is vague and thus unorganized. Re­ sponding to the poems as songs and thus to their mood, we accept their  image of a world in which we are all children watched over by guardians.  The unsettling of innocence begins only with a second reading in which  we realize that the poems, far from being repetitive confirmations of  each other, fall into three categories . There are nonnarrative poems like  "The Lamb, ' '  which seem insulated from complication by their very  brevity ; longer poems like "The Ecchoing Green" and "Nurse's Song,"  </page> <page sequence="4"> 2 24 The Supplement of Reading  which already place innocence within the temporal cycle ; and social  poems like "Holy Thursday,"  "The Chimney-Sweeper," and "The Little  Black Boy," whose transposition of innocence from country to city dis­ places pastoral from the literal to the metaphoric . The first two catego­ ries protect the world of innocence, though only at the price of a certain  hermeneutic passivity . Thus, at first glance the world of "The Lamb"  seems one of lyric simultaneity , conducive to the sacramental identity of  lamb, Christ, and child . "The Ecchoing Green," with its construction in  terms of receding temporal vistas that move from the children to Old  John, differs in conceding the mutability of innocence. But even here we  are allowed not to question an innocent aesthetic . Conventionally pas­ toral , these poems are instances of a form that naturalizes innocence and  then absorbs its loss by suggesting that it can be recovered through  memory or through its recurrence in the lives of the next generation .   The figure of diurnal or life cycles in  which repetition i s  naturally or­ dained becomes in turn a paradigm that naturalizes pastoral representa­ tion as a repetition in which writing makes present what is known to be  impermanent. These poems are full of gaps in the representation of  innocence, such as the fact that the animals in "Night" have to die in  order to establish the existence of that protection which would not have  been necessary if it had existed in the first place . Inasmuch as children's  literature uses animals to gloss human situations , the gaps refer to gaps  in the social text supported by the conservatively pietist tradition of Isaac  Watts and Mrs. Barbauld on which the poems are modeled. But these  gaps , instead of stimulating a critique of pietism,  are seen as functions of  temporality , justifying a substitution in which writing or memory stands  in place of a real innocence . This supplementary use of pastoral as a  form of (re)-covering innocence will emerge as profoundly repressive,  perpetuating as it does a status quo that makes a heaven in hell's despite.  Dividing the poems into categories begins the work of breaking down  an unorganized impression of innocence into the minute and troubling  particulars that compose it. For in the social poems images from Chris­ tian pastoral are used of children in an environment beset by problems  like child labor and racism, so as to disclose the role of pastoral language  in an economy that depends on keeping children innocent. An innocent  reading of "Holy Thursday" might take it as promising that the meek  shall inherit the earth .2 But we pass very quickly to a reading like that of  Bloom, who points out that charity is a form of parasitism that perpetu­ ates poverty to congratulate itself for alleviating it, and that the radiance  2£ .

"3 In ''The Chimney  Sweeper," similarly, the sense of innocence is in the way the children  perceive their condition, and that perception is both touching and  ominous.  Dreaming of the day when he will be freed from his life as a  sweep ,  the younger child figures the dark, narrow chimneys as "coffins  of black" and imagines an angel with a "bright key" who will "set them all  free" (E 1 0) .  The conventional use of a figure to represent what is un­ pleasant (death) as pleasant (the angel) is oddly crossed here by the  image of a coffin, which represents the sordid working conditions of the  child in terms of something worse (his death) .  It  is as though the literal  referent buried in the first figure has resurfaced in the second, repro­ duced in the very process of its effacement. This reversal throws into  relief the role of imagination in the social economy, unraveling as text  the mythology of an afterlife that justifies present injustice .  A simple reading of the pure lyrics and pastorals is necessary to the  dialectic of experiencing our own complicity in limited vision. But by  organizing the poems in groups and then rereading the first two catego­ ries in relation to social poems linked to their counterparts in Experience,  we reenter the simpler poems from a different perspective. The sac­ charine flatness of the pure lyrics now appears as a form of defamiliariz­ ation that allows us to focus on the semiosis of innocence. Crucial to the  rhetoric of innocence is a metaphoric thought structure that confuses as  well as fuses. Thus the child in "The Lamb" creates an imaginary identi­ ty between child , God, and animal by blurring the antecedents of his  pronouns in a way that is foregrounded by the conspicuous repetition in  the poem :  Little Lamb who made thee  Dost thou know who made thee  Little Lamb I 'll tell thee ,  Little Lamb I 'll tell thee !  He is called by thy name,  For he calls himself a Lamb.  (E8-g)  The pronoun "He" stands in place of either Christ or the child, creating  a con-fusion of human, natural, and divine orders that is specifically  characterized as linguistic : a product of the activity of naming. The  blurring of the antecedent in turn elides an ambiguity within the open- 3Harold Bloom, Blake's Apocalypse: A Study in Poetic Argument ( 1 963 ; rpt. Ithaca, N .Y . :  Cornell University Press, 1 970), pp. 44-45.   </page> <page sequence="6"> 2 26 The Supplement of Reading  ing question. Seemingly a rhetorical question implying that Christ made  the lamb, the question is answered in such a way as to imply the conven­ tional answer, but only metaphorically. For Christ is present in the poem  only through a pronoun that may not refer to him, and through a  metaphor that seems to have no tenor: "He is called by thy name."  It is as  though we remain suspended in a world of signifiers in which the an­ swer to a question is a pronoun that stands in place of something that can  only be named in terms of another name. The tautologically circling way  in which 'Christ' is traced into the text raises the possibility of a different  answer to the child's question in which it is the child who constructs an  imaginary world of innocence through the language in which he  "clothes" the lamb. Metaphor and mythmaking are not pernicious here,  but the poem provides a stencil of the linguistic displacements to which  we should be alert elsewhere. For in a poem like "The Chimney Sweep­ er," where the child is again a 'lamb, '  we see how the clothing of experi­ ence in innocence can substitute dream for reality while disguising an  ideologically motivated substitution in what seems to the child an identi­ ty.  One of the more interesting examples of defamiliarization is "Infant  Joy,'' which is awkwardly brief and keeps repeating the child's name in  an annoyingly tautological way. The absence of significant content in the  poem foregrounds its form, or more precisely its structures of predica­ tion, so as to make us aware of how a grammar can create reality . The  poem begins by making the child a blank slate : "I have no name I I am  but two days old .-" (E i 6). The attribution of language to such a child  suggests that what we are witnessing is a process of cultural inscription.  For the child's relative lack of character makes it clear that the writing of  its identity constitutes it as a function in a social script rather than as a  person. I ts function is to perform the role of innocence regardless of the  actual circumstances of its life. This construction of the child , moreover,  takes the form of a hypostasis in which an adjective ("happy") ,  expressive  of a momentary feeling, is conveniently turned into a substantive ("Joy") ,   which then becomes the child's name: "I happy am I Joy is  my name,-"  (E 1 6) .  The endowment of the child with identity through a process that  is allegorical and not mythic, not the animating of a sensible object with a  god or genius, makes naming into a labeling by which identity is imposed  on what may be highly complex, so as to generate an ideological product  that is easily consumed . In parodying the simplicity of children's litera­ ture, thus subjecting it to a textual practice that requires readers to think  for themselves, the poem subtly criticizes the marketing of popular  forms for a mass consumption that encourages passivity.  A second reading of the poems, in other words, turns them in a  linguistically reflexive direction . But this is equally true of a second  </page> <page sequence="7"> Early Texts 2 2 7   reading o f  Experience. "Infant Sorrow" i s  spoken by a child who sees its  swaddling bands as shackles imposed on it by society . The hysterical  absurdity of this image, attributed to a child who may be no older than  its innocent counterpart, draws attention to the stereotypical nature of  the reaction behind it. Unlike the characters of Innocence, those in Experi­ ence are resentful and jaded . The nurse turns "green and pale" as she  watches the children playing, while the chimney sweeper describes him­ self as wearing the "clothes of death" (E23) .  At first the starkness of the  rhetoric overwhelms a critical reaction, as though its overstatements reg­ ister the intensity with which trauma has previously been repressed . But  gradually we become aware of a melodramatic quality in this rhetoric  that limits its claim to truth . Melodrama has two main characteristics . As  drama it is a dialogical form in which positions are staked out in relation  to other positions and have no absolute validity . It shows (as lyric does  not) how the emotions are generated by a social text, and it subverts its  own claim to unveil a world of primal passion and absolute truth . Sec­ ond, as a hypertheatrical mode given to black and white characteriza­ tion, melodrama is generated by a certain imbalance between signifier  and signified in which the speaker wears a mask that overstates and thus  distorts what it signifies. Thus the characters of Experience play roles in a  theater of frustrated revolt where the suppression of their uprising  dooms them to a self-consuming passivity . As the curtain is raised on this  primal scene, we seem to enter something more 'profound' than inno­ cence with its veil of metaphors . But the very fact that these characters  keep returning to particular linguistic strategies marks their perception  of experience, too, as a representation. Many of the poems are allego­ ries. "The Garden of Love" allegorizes the repression of the instincts in  terms of the building of a chapel in Eden. "The Sick Rose" uses the  flower to allegorize a process of internal corruption. The allegorizing  impulse does not succeed in creating a world of simple signifieds, but  rather conveys a desire to schematize, to see life in static ways . Again,  many of the poems are highly graphic in the way they are built around a  single gesture or image. In "London" the sweep is represented only by a  cry and the harlot by a curse. This simplifying reduction of situation to  tableau takes us beyond the content of Experience to the mental struc­ turing of this content in the rigid ways that, more than anything, make  experience a decadent state .  A second reading of Experience thus returns us dialectically to the poems  of Innocence. Some of them have no counterparts in Experience, perhaps to  dislodge us from the habit of rereading innocence in terms of experience.  To leave the embittered children of Experience and return to the little  black boy is to realize that we cannot just dismiss his desire to be "like" the  white boy so that "he will then love me" (Eg) . The concluding image of his  </page> <page sequence="8"> 2 2 8  The Supplement o f  Reading  stroking the white boy's hair may show how the future he imagines  replicates the social relations of the present. But it also shows his ability to  believe in the potential of those who have hurt him, a capacity that may be  necessary in revolutionary action if it is not to take the regressive form it  assumes in the Ore myth. Trust, on the other hand, can be abused.  Interplaying innocence and experience, the dialectical reader constructs  an 'organized' innocence that cannot be finalized in Blake's text because it  must remain sensitive to the details of different historical situations. Such  a reading is encouraged by versions of the collection that end with "The  Clod and the Pebble. "  Encapsulating the attitudes of innocence and  experience in the malleable clod and the hardened pebble , the poem ends  with an impasse in which the positions simply parody each other. The clod  builds "a Heaven in Hells despair" and allows itself to be trodden on, while  the pebble's cynicism creates a "Hell in Heavens despite" (E l g) .  Both  positions are defamiliarized by their association with inanimate objects,  and the reader, unable to identify with either speaker, is left to find a way  between the extremes.  Even as we construct a dialectical reading, however, it generates ques­ tions. One of its more troubling aspects is that organized innocence  exists only in the mind of the reader. We could say that its creation  through an applicative reading lends added force to it, because it  emerges from our experience instead of being a merely linguistic con­ struct. But its deferral beyond the written text also makes its achieve­ ment dependent on the reader and opens it to historical as well as inter­ nal sub-versions, such as those we have outlined in relation to the Lyca  poems. Bypassing the psychosocial problems so prominent in Experience,  these poems inscribe a simulacrum of Eden that may either serve as a  dialectical stimulus to the reader to break the grip of experience, or may  leave us wondering whether utopias do not always contain traces of the  unorganized . They thus inscribe as a reading any use of the poems to  bring about a hermeneutic completion of the Songs .   What has been sketched here is  not a negation of the dialectical read­ ing but a deferral of its closure. Such sub-versions are encouraged by the  collection itself, for the author enters the text only through figures that  do not quite represent him, like the piper and the bard . Indeed , both  introductions can be seen as staging the problem of reading. At first  sight the piper's song sustains an aesthetics in which writing preserves,  though inadequately, the presence of innocence, and in which reading is  correspondingly recuperative. The poem moves from the original vision  of the child , through the piped song that can only represent him, to the  song unaccompanied by music , and finally to the substitution of writing  for voice as the poet's pen "stain(s) the water clear" (E7) .  But as in the  figures of echoing and temporal repetition so frequent in the series ,   </page> <page sequence="9"> Early Texts 2 29   writing and reading are still representations ofa n  original presence. It is  possible, however, to read the poem very differently, beginning with the  grammatical ambiguities of the first stanza :  Piping down the valleys wild  Piping songs of pleasant glee  On a cloud I saw a child .  (E7)  In the text as opposed to the picture, it is far from clear who is piping  and whether the child or the piper is on a cloud.  Either the speaker is on  a cloud and sees the child piping down the valleys, in which case the  child is oddly beneath the piper, as if more in touch with actuality ; or  else the piper is in the valley and then sees the child on the cloud, in  which case the temporal relationship between the two events raises the  possibility that the 'child' is brought into being as illusion by the piper's  song. In both cases the piper's representation of the child lacks an extra­ textual origin, for either the child is his construction or it does not  correspond to his representation of it. Interestingly, the piper wants to  restrict his audience to children or to his figure of them, and writes  songs that "Every child may joy to hear." But the child in his final  instruction no longer mentions songs and asks the piper to "write I In a  book that all may read-," associating access to a wider audience with the  transition from voice to writing. This transition,  in turn, complicates  interpretation, not only because author and reader are no longer pres­ ent in the same space but also because the reading of words is a more  reflective experience than the hearing of music. As the child vanishes,  we stand on the threshhold of a further declension from writing done  with a "rural pen" to the printing press on which Blake's poems were  actually produced.  Conflating the oral and the textual as he insists on writing as some­ thing one 'hears' (l. 20) , the piper resists the complexities that result  from this expansion of the hermeneutic economy. But the piper's obvi­ ous anachronism in a collection that includes poems about racism and  child labor is the point at which Blake casts his own songs into the  expanse, printing them for all to read, and thus complicating the re­ stricted economies of both pastoral and prophecy. For the question of  restricted versus expanded audiences raised in the first introduction  necessarily applies to the bard of Experience, who merely substitutes one  form of orality for another, assuming that he can address a homoge­ neous entity called "Earth" and can use a single sign to represent an  immensely complex referent. "Earth's Answer" raises the question (as  Keats was later to say of Milton) of whether a lesser anxiety for humanity  </page> <page sequence="10"> 2 30 The Supplement of Reading  proceeds from seeing farther or from a vision limited by its very omnis­ cience. It is interesting that Blake makes Earth female , while counter­ pointing her view against the presumably male voice of the bard . Earth's  insistence that arguments for spiritual regeneration based on the natural  cycle of night and day do not apply within the profoundly unnatural  context of restrictive moral codes (E 1 8- 1 9 ;  11. 1 1 -20) contains contra­ dictions that might mobilize the stasis of her trauma. For instance, she  ends by wanting to be freed from her bondage, although she also dis­ misses talk of liberation as useless .  But the point is also that the bard's  easy optimism may be insensitive to certain specifics of the female expe­ rience : to the fact that recognizing one's manacles as mind-forged may  simply increase one's frustration if one's culture has constructed one as  helpless. In this respect Earth may represent not only women but other  marginal groups as well. The two introductions are a paradigm for the  collection as a whole, in that they not only make the bardic voice answer­ able to an audience but recognize that "all" do not read alike. The  counterpointing of bard and respondent creates a scene of reading  which concedes that interpretation is engendered by cultural differ­ ences . But these very differences, which make closure impossible, also  prevent impasses from being aporias, because they are historically spe­ cific. For the female reader may not feel bound to identify with the  Earth . The Earth, for one thing, uses an archetypal language that repre­ sents her situation as perennial and thus repeats that very inability to  think historically that she tacitly criticizes in the bard, but by making  culture the negation rather than the contrary of nature.  To return culture to its status as a contrary is to open dialectic through  its sub-version. But a further arrangement of the poems might challenge  the very notion of dialectic, not only as a movement toward synthesis but  even as a productivity , by replacing the dialectic between contrary states  with a dialogue within each state that suspends forward movement. On  returning to the Songs of Innocence, we again find that they fall into three  categories, and that the illusion of innocence in the pure lyrics is chal­ lenged by poems that explain its vulnerability in radically different ways.  In  poems like "The Ecchoing Green" the loss of innocence seems part of  a natural cycle . On the other hand , in poems like "Holy Thursday" it is  socially caused and thus unnecessary . At first sight, the impasse created  by these two alternatives seems to be mobilized by the Songs of Experience  into a linear progression. For we enter the second state through the  bard's song, which tells us that Earth has it in her power to change, and  we then come upon a number of 'diagnostic' poems that tell us how to  change by tracing the repressions of experience back to social codes and  to the institutions they generate . Foremost among these is "The Garden  of Love, "  in which the Miltonic view that the imposition of the law was  </page> <page sequence="11"> Early Texts 2 3 1  necessary because of humanity's fall is replaced by the 'Blakean' view  that it was the law that caused the fall . Picturing the fall as the erection of  a chapel in a garden where there were once flowers , the speaker at­ tributes his psychic disorganization to the institution of the church. In  "London" the bard attacks monarchy, child labor and prostitution. And  finally in "The Sick Rose" he diagnoses the rose's sickness as a psychosis  caused by the repressiveness of sexual codes . But if these poems repre­ sent the state of experience as kept in being by mind-forged manacles,  many of them also contain traces of the natural hypothesis that they seek  to efface. For the Songs of Experience fall into two categories, and the  poems that initially seem to ascribe experience to culture also turn out to  imply that it may be natural . Thus "The Garden of Love" sees the  binding of instinct as unnatural but describes this process through the  natural image of briars growing in a garden (E26) .  "The Sick Rose"  describes the deterioration of love through an image that is again curi­ ously natural, that of a worm in a flower (E23) .  If these subtexts bitterly  normalize experience, a poem like "London" arrives at the same fatalism  by a different road. On a second reading "London" no longer seems to  be spoken in the voice of the bardic introduction, which calls on the  fallen Earth to renew herself. It seems descriptive rather than hortatory,  helpless rather than prophetic, a poem whose con-text may be "Earth's  Answer. "  It is notable that the various people imprisoned in mind­ forged manacles are all powerless :  children, prostitutes, soldiers rather  than generals. 'Wandering' aimlessly from street to street, the speaker  may realize that a diagnosis is not a remedy and that the state of experi­ ence is so widely dispersed as to elude any centralized critique . In one of  the most striking lines of the poem, even the church is described as  'appalled' by the cry of the chimney sweeper: a powerful institution  helplessly traumatized by its own complicity in what it claims to be fight­ ing.4  In the reading process as described here, a progress in the first series  of poems from the 'natural' to the 'social' hypothesis is aporetically can­ celed in the second series by the disclosure that even the most politically  radical poems are disturbed by a certain fatalism about what is 'natural'  or at least inevitable. This arrangement of the poems, chiasmic where  the other one was teleological , frustrates any appropriation of the Songs  for political ends. If  the ending of the collection with "The Clod and the  Pebble" (copies B, C, D, E) encourages dialectical reading, the reading  suggested here is supported by versions that end with "To Tirzah" (cop- 4Jonathan Culler points out that critics have persistently taken the word "appals" in its  secondary sense of 'to cast a pall over' rather than in its primary sense of 'to horrify ' :  The  Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction (Ithaca, N.Y. : Cornell University Press,  1 98 1 ) ,  pp. 70-72 .   </page> <page sequence="12"> 23 2 The Supplement of Reading  ies L,  K, 0) : a poem in which the bardic speaker answers Earth by  turning away from her complexities and renouncing the optimism he  proclaimed before he had really been through experience . But although  Blake added "To Tirzah" relatively late as a pessimistic coda, he some­ times moved it to the middle of the collection, eroding the authority of  its bitter transcendentalism by situating it among other texts and letting  us read it as an overreaction to problems that only seem insurmountable .  Placed in dialogue with "Earth's Answer" the male speaker of "To  Tirzah" seems conveniently oblivious to the text and not to the subtext of  what she is saying. Where the bard of the introduction had assumed  change to be easier than it was , the speaker of this poem misogynistically  argues that the "Mother" of his "mortal part" is beyond help :  'Then  what have I to do with thee?" (E30) . Such a response fails to read the  complex cultural structuring of Earth's answer. For her very insistence  that the bard's advice does not apply to her conveys a desire for change  along with a feeling that it is too difficult, and her sullen refusal of help  is paradoxically a self-assertion :  a defiant compliance with the passivity  to which she has been conditioned . By setting the speaker of "To  Tirzah" in the midst of other social types, Blake allows us to see his Old  Testament rhetoric as out of place in nineteenth-century London. The  poem in this sense is a paradigm for the way the shifting of texts leads us  to reflect on the differences between readers : on the cultural engender­ ing of the texts we ourselves construct in reading the Songs.  That a pessimistic reading of the collection is no more complete than a  dialectical one is signaled by the fact that however many subcategories  we invent in organizing it, they fail to include everything that is there. As  we construct categories to account for new evidence , we also shift the  meaning of texts we have already placed in an interpretive schema by  putting them into new frames. Where , for example, does "The Tyger"  fit in? Bloom has worked out a dialectical reading of the poem in which  our naive identification with the speaker, who watches in terror as the  world of the tiger invalidates that of the lamb, must be overcome  through a cleansed perception of the tiger as energy rather than evil . 5  Such a reading, which paradigmatically makes the poem a contrary  rather than a negation of innocence , leaves unexplored the problem of  whether dialectic does indeed yield closure. Blake's ambivalence toward  energy is well known, and the poem does not tell us whether the tiger  forged on the anvil of imagination is a creation of Los, a Demogorgon,  or perhaps a rough beast slouching toward Bethlehem to be born. Elud­ ing a dialectical reading, the poem also thwarts a fatalistic reading that  sees experience as part of the nature of things, because it forces us to  5Blake's Apocalypse,  pp. i 3 7-39.  </page> <page sequence="13"> Early Texts 233  rethink the labels 'experience' and 'nature. '  It  depicts a fearful symmetry  in which the lamb and tiger coexist :  a world beyond good and evil , but  one that may be no easier to frame in terms of the values The Marriage  substitutes for the conventional ones. This world is hardly the paradise  regained of the Lyca poems, where the tiger and the child live in narcotic  peace . On the other hand, it is not corroded by the decadence and  repression elsewhere associated with Experience. It seems a world of  paradox and tension rather than synthesis, involving a symbiosis of op­ posites within the economy of what is better described as 'organized  experience' than as 'organized innocence. '   Perhaps the most significant aspect of  the Songs i s  Blake's use of  the  collection to unsettle the identity of the book or the autonomous lyric .  The diacritical nature of a collection registers an awareness that mean­ ing cannot be totalized, because it is produced by relationships that are  always shifting. Individual texts do not have a positive meaning: their  significance changes in relation to their con-text. The shifting of con­ texts is encouraged not only by the fact that the Songs exist in different  orders , but also by the history of their composition, as a diacritical com­ plex from which Blake generated texts that were then reinscribed in the  collection. This is not to say that the Songs ask us to renounce the idea of  totalizing knowledge or reaching conclusions. Indeed, the very project  of a collection,  a bringing together, holds out hopes of organization if  not of totality . But in contrast to a more linear form like the bi/,dungsro­ man, a collection can be entered at more than one point and usually is  not read in its entirety. Thus, the whole one assembles out of it will  always be an effect of one's perspective and will always be subject to the  arrest of what it excludes .  But it is not enough simply to describe Blake's work as diacritical. Both  the Songs and the other early texts we shall consider are instances of what  Kristeva calls "intertextuality ," a concept that turns the play of differ­ ence toward an interaction with social texts that makes literature what  she calls a "productivity . "  Elaborating an idea implicit in Bakhtin,  Kristeva sums up intertextuality as a critical practice that "situates the  text within history and society, which are then seen as texts read by the  writer, and into which he inserts himself by rewriting them."6 This defi­ nition perhaps needs to be expanded so as to include the reader as the  site where our own texts are reinserted, through what Kierkegaard calls  a dialectical reduplication, in histories we have forgotten. The compo­ nents of Blake's intertextuality are thus vertical as well as horizontal . On  the horizontal level of Blake's own textual network, his poems constitute  6Julia Kristeva, Desire in Language, trans. Leon Roudiez (New York: Columbia University  Press, 1 980), pp. 36, 65 .  </page> <page sequence="14"> 234 The Supplement of Reading  intertexts that are transcodings of shared thematic matrices . Meanwhile ,  the individual texts consist of mobile fragments that articulate their own  structurality by transcoding each other along paradigmatic or syntagma­ tic axes. In Europe, for instance, the preludium and the preface in which  Blake meets the fairy are different versions on a paradigmatic axis of a  scene of origination or creativity that tries to revolutionize how we per­ ceive the world. The prophecy itself repeats the concept of perceptual  revolution as historical revolution and develops it on the syntagmatic  axis of a narrative describing eighteen hundred years of European histo­ ry. In the Songs the syntagmatic axis has more or less disappeared, there  being no narrative : the individual poems rewrite each other by refigur­ ing similar situations in the experience of different characters . So far, we  have focused largely on the horizontal operation of Blake's intertex­ tuality. But in addition, his texts function vertically in relation to pre­ vious and future history. That he rewrites the social text, in the very  specific sense of analyzing how it is composed by perceptual or semi­ ological systems, has long been recognized. What has been less discussed  is the way this process reinserts his own scripts in that text which calls  them into being and also marks their limits . Moreover, this process of  mutual inscription is repeated with reference to future readers, in read­ ings whose content Blake could not have anticipated but whose possibil­ ity he allows for at the level of form. This vertical aspect of intertex­ tuality will be our concern when we come, by way of the early tractates,  to Thel and Visions .  Vision as/or Experiment: The Early Tractates  Blake's perspectivism ,  and hence his emphasis on reading intertex­ tually, arises from his early commitment to "experience" or "experi­ ment." These are vexed terms,  given his attacks on Bacon and Locke,  and we should understand them in an existential rather than a positivist  sense. For if Blake objected to empiricism for limiting us to what is  known through the senses , it is not clear that he disagreed with its  inductive emphasis on testing hypotheses through experience rather  than interpreting experience in the light of a priori truths. Nor is his  alternative a visionary idealism that bypasses experience entirely, given  the opening up of the latter concept implicit in its coupling with the term  "experiment" (E l ) .  Instead, in the early tractates Blake inscribes the  visionary within the empirical , articulating a highly idealistic series of  propositions in a format that displaces them. Blake's re-visionary empiri­ cism is in turn relevant to his hermeneutics , for it frees us from a theory  </page> <page sequence="15"> Early Texts 235  of reading as reproduction and allows us to see reading, too, as an  experiment with the text.  The first tractate "All Religions Are One" begins with the statement  "As the true method of knowledge is experiment, the true faculty of  knowing must be the faculty which experiences" (E l ) .  Although it is  often read ironically, we shall experiment with reading this "Argument"  as an introduction to what follows . Dialectically displacing a conventional  opposition between experience and the "poetic genius," Blake seems to  say that imagination, not reason, is the faculty that experiences and thus  accumulates knowledge, but also that imaginative wisdom is gained  through experience and cannot be put in the golden bowl of a protected  idealism.  This double transvaluation of the opposed terms is summed up  in the paradox from "There Is No Natural Religion" : "Therefore God  becomes as we are, that we may be as he is" (E3) .  The paradox promises  an identity of opposites through the mystery of the Incarnation. But the  reversals necessary to achieve that identity also raise the problem of a  permanent asymmetry between the terms : the possibility that once God  has been through experience, we may not be able to become gods in any  conventional sense of the term.  In both tractates the choice between reason and imagination is raised  in terms of the problem of perspective. Reason or the ratio of what we  already know limits us to our own perspective, where imagination allows  us to travel in what Blake calls "unknown lands" (E 1 ) .  It  is imagination  that therefore provides us with experience by allowing us to project  ourselves into perspectives other than our own. Moreover, in "All Re­ ligions are One" the unknown is linked to the problem of different  cultures increasingly prominent in the work of Herder and the Hum­ boldts . Difference, in the form of gender difference, will be a concern of  Thel and Visions, and the tractate thus introduces problems in cultural  hermeneutics relevant to these early poems. Like Wilhelm von Hum­ boldt, who saw each language as the unique expression of its culture,  Blake says that the "Religions of all Nations are derived from each Na­ tion's different reception of the Poetic Genius" (E I ;  italics mine) . Commit­ ted like Humboldt to a unity that will absorb cultural diversity, Blake is  nevertheless anxiously aware that different "sects of Philosophy" are  "adapted to the weaknesses of every individual" and that these perspec­ tives are all authentic, because "No man can think write or speak from  his heart, but he must intend truth" (E l ) . In other words, though the  tractate promises a dialectical synthesis of experience and vision, what it  discloses is a potential asymmetry between them. The uniformity of  vision associated with the poetic genius when Blake uses the analogy of  the biblical syncresis of old and new contends uneasily with a diversity  </page> <page sequence="16"> 236 The Supplement of Reading  allowed to 'genius' when he speaks of it in experimental rather than  religious terms ,  as the experiencing of different perspectives. This un­ easiness is present in the very title of the tract, which may reflect either  the syncretism of thinkers like Jacob Bryant who expands Christian  typology to the study of comparative religion and myth, or which may  imply a radical perspectivism. For "All Religions are One" may mean  that they all say the same thing. Or it may mean that they are equally  valid, because each is produced by people thinking and speaking from  their hearts.  In "There Is  No Natural Religion" Blake's attitude to 'experience' is  ambiguous in different ways. The text with which most of us are familiar  consists of two series of propositions (one negative and one positive) and  a summary ( printed in slightly different orders by Erdman and  Bentley) . In form, this text anticipates the contrary propositions of The  Marriage, in which two perspectives are given but one seems correct. The  "Conclusion" characterizes the two perspectives by maintaining the op­ position between the 'poetic' and the 'experimental' displaced in "All  Religions Are One" and valorizing the former. But is it entirely clear that  to desire something is to possess it (E3 ; b .g) ,  and that we are wrong to  doubt the existence of something we have not seen or experienced? At  one time Blake undoubtedly did construct the text as a hierarchical  confrontation of contraries, because he numbered the plates so as to  arrange them in two paired series. Even within this structure the reader  must recognize as overstatement the simple reversal of empiricism into  its opposite and must try to replace inversion with something more  dialectical . But what is interesting is that the Erdman-Bentley text is an  eclectic version that corresponds to no extant copy and that a reasonably  complete set of the positive propositions occurs in only one copy. The  remaining copies all have only three plates from the positive series, and  sometimes fewer. The summary is printed by Erdman as follows :  Application .  He who sees the I nfinite in all things sees  God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only .  Conclusion.  If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the  Philosophic &amp; Experimental would soon be the  ratio of all things &amp; stand still, unable to do other than repeat the  same dull round over again  Therefore God becomes as we are, that we may be as he is (E3)  But in the extant copies only the last of these summary propositions  occurs with any frequency , whereas the other two occur only once .  Whatever Blake may have intended when he engraved the full series of  </page> <page sequence="17"> Early Texts 2 37  plates, it seems that he dismembered his text, that he systematically  failed to print five of the seven positive propositions, and that in no  surviving copy do we have the visionary humanism of the summary as  impressively massed together as in the modern editions.  In the surviving arrangements, moreover, only one bound copy actu­ ally separates the plates into two series , whereas the other five intertwine  both series. The specific orderings have no authority , but they suggest  that Blake drew back from the defiantly visionary idealism of the text we  have. The position he wants to assume is evident: the negative series of  propositions is self-limiting, and the three positive plates that usually  turn up (3 , 4 , and 1 2 ) begin the articulation of a counterphilosophy. But  missing is the rhetorical force of an ideology refuted point by point and  then conclusively dismissed . Those arrangements that intertwine the two  series allow readers to move dialectically between empiricism and ideal­ ism, or to traverse an ellipse of perspectives in which we contemplate the  alternative to a purely empiricist position and then return (though un­ easily) to a recognition that humanity still may not be infinite. But most  interesting of all is what happens to the three-point summary printed in  modern editions. It seems that Blake had second thoughts about oppos­ ing the poetic and experimental characters, and issued the relevant plate  ( 1 1 ) only once. It also seems that the conclusive position assigned to the  paradox identifying God and human beings is an editorial construction  based on a canonical reading. In six bound copies this paradox only once  comes at the end of the verbal text. In that position the statement ab­ sorbs the discontinuity between finite and infinite revealed by the polar­ ized structure of the text and constructs a paradoxical circuit that allows  'Blake' to produce the propositions of series b as a dialectical reversal  rather than a simplistic inversion of series a. Displaced to the middle of  the text, the paradox still promises a resolution of contraries, but one  that seems more speculative, given its encirclement by the maze of con­ traries that a final placement allows it to transcend .  In short, the tractates disclose a writer uncertain about how we get  from the finite to the infinite and unclear about the relationship between  individual experience and visionary imagination. The full force of this  uncertainty is held in check by the fact that these texts consist of abstract  propositions unelaborated in terms of character and situation. But in  The Book of Thel and Visions of the Daughters of Albion Blake will put into  question the hope that all religions can be one even though we see things  differently. He will likewise explore the power of imagination to bring  into being the infinite. For Thel's conversations with natural entities who  see eternity in a grain of sand are experiments in imaginative projection.  But then so, too, is the vision in her grave plot, which likewise exceeds  the ratio of what she has seen and known.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 238 The Supplement of Reading  En-Gendering the System : The Book of Thel and  Visions of the Daughters of Albion  If the Songs foreground their intertextuality, Thel and Visions provide  inside views of a single subject whose experience we must live through if  we are to understand it. But the identity of this subject is less clear than it  might seem, for canonical readings of the texts have tended to subsume  the female protagonists into the voice of the male author, or rather have  used the 'experience' of the characters to legitimize the 'vision' of the  author. There is, in other words, more than one 'subject' in these poems,  including the reader. We shall therefore focus on those elements that  make us aware that the subject is already intertextual, that 'Oothoon' has  been partly written by others, and that 'Blake' cannot represent 'Oothoon'  without becoming inscribed in his difference from her. In the process we  shall see how a hermeneutics of identification both facilitates and impedes  a cultural critique.  For it encourages us to identify with perspectives  different from our own, and yet it also risks concealing difference in  uncritical identification.  Most readings of Thel identify not with Thel but with 'Blake. '  Thus the  poem has been read canonically in the light of Blake's later attacks on the  selfhood, as a critique of its virginal protagonist whose fear of losing her  identity prevents her crossing from innocence into experience. 7 In the  course of the poem a lily, a cloud, and a clod of clay reassure her that  what seems like death to her is, from an eternal perspective, part of a  regenerative process. For those who see Thel as wrong to flee back to the  vales of Har, she thus becomes a figure in the argument that the entry  into experience is a fortunate fall that will lead to organized innocence.  But whether the cloud and the clod adequately represent 'Blake' is far  from clear, given that the latter appears in the Songs as a figure not just  for generosity but also for na'ivete. Moreover, as the personification of  natural objects suggests, the cyclical construction of time that allows  Thel's conversants to imagine organized innocence is linked only meta­ phorically to a human world that may be irrevocably linear in its move­ ment toward decomposition.  Crucial to our sense that the poem can be read heretically as well as  canonically is precisely this use of metaphor or figure as transposition,  as  a perspective shift that tries to transform one position into another. An  initial example is Thel's description of how the lamb 'crops' the lily's  flowers, a curiously gentle term for what (given Thel's identification with  her) is actually the flower's death. In one sense the substitution of the cut  flower for the violated person asks us to change our perspective and to  7 An exception is Mitchell, Blake's Composite Art, pp. 78- 1 06.   </page> <page sequence="19"> Early Texts 2 39  see what is horrible to us as natural. But in another sense metaphor  suspends this cleansing of the doors of perception at the site of lan­ guage, making us aware that it is safe to change our perspective only  because the poem is a pastoral that constructs an artificially stylized  world. And pastoral, as Blake suggests in the Songs, may itself be a  political convention used to cloud our perception of social violence.  Some sense of a violence that exceeds the ability of Blake's system to  contain it emerges in Thel's final monologue, which is the scene not only  of her figures but also of ours :  Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?  Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile !  Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,  Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie?  Or an Eye of gifts &amp; graces show'ring fruits &amp; coined gold !  Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?  Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?  (E6 ; 6 : l l - 1 7)  Two assumptions have informed commentary on this passage . Although  the language is completely inconsonant with any she has used hitherto,  we assume that the lines are spoken by a self-projected specter of Thel  rather than by a collective unconscious that might lend them authority .  And we assume that Thel's questions refer to her fear of 'normal' sexual  experience, and that since virginity is 'wrong, '  her horror can be dis­ missed as hysteria. But the referent of the traumatic images is far from  clear, for a "thousand fighting men" may just as well refer to war as to  sex. In copies that eliminate the last two lines of the passage, with their  reference to the "youthful boy" and the "curtain of flesh," the lines point  more directly to some amorphous form of social violence the source of  which seems lost somewhere in the political unconscious. Although the  poem leaves us free to think that this unconscious is another figured  curtain ( perhaps a screen for Thel's sexual fears) , its obliteration of  precise referents also raises the possibility that our dismissal of her fears  may be a screen for our own fears . In other words, the passage also asks  us to enter the space Thel flees and to construct what might be there that  so violently negates the language of (un)organized innocence.  At the heart of this poem is a deep uncertainty as to whether there is  innocence after experience. This uncertainty can be located in elements  of the poem's discourse and construction that mark its indeterminacy as  deliberate. For one thing, there is the division of a relatively short text  into chapters that mark off different discourses from each other, a fea­ ture that limits the authority of each character to the chapter that it  dominates . What results is a juxtaposition of different perspectives on  </page> <page sequence="20"> 240 The Supplement of Reading  the poem's central problem,  rather than a continuous narrative that  builds up authority for the perspective of eternity and reaches a crisis at  which Thel denies that perspective. If Bogen and Erdman are accurate  about the chronology of composition, Blake may actually have written  the poem in segments marking his own shifts in perspective . Thus it  seems that chapter I I I  (on the clod and the worm) was executed sepa­ rately from the first two chapters , and that the final chapter was com­ posed later (no earlier than I 79 1 )  as an '"Experience' climax and com­ mentary attached to what may in I 789 have been more purely a poem of  ' Innocence' . "8 The perspectivism of the poem is further emphasized by  the motto . Providing us with questions rather than moral prescripts , the  motto does not valorize any one point of view. For although the eagle  cannot know what is in the pit in the way the mole does , neither can the  blind mole wholly see what is there . But although the eagle may see  more than the mole , that does not necessarily change the mole's world ,  which is constituted by its blindness .  That wisdom cannot be kept in a  silver rod suggests, moreover, that understanding must not be codified  in closed forms that provide one law for mole and eagle alike . Each  speaker, including Thel , claims such closure, although the dialogical  form of the poem belies it. For the lily and the cloud , having delivered  their message , retreat to a "silver shrine" and an "airy throne," respec­ tively. Only the clod invites Thel into her home, thus potentially opening  herself to another perspective that she, too , avoids by disappearing from  the poem thereafter.  By composing the poem in perspectival segments , Blake creates a text  that exists in different 'states, '  accommodating but always situating the  perspectives of both author and reader.9 As in many of these texts ,  variant orders for the plates are of symptomatic rather than determinate  significance. The existence of offset numbers for the plates that include  the narrative prevents us from literally rearranging Thel's history . But  the free-floating status of the text's margins (motto , illustrations, etc . )   has a suggestive function, reminding us that even fixed narrative orders  can be seen in more than one way : the entry into the grave plot can be  seen as a crisis in which Thel refuses wisdom, or it can be viewed as a  peripeteia that exposes the hollowness of what has gone before. This  sense of the poem as existing only in states is reinforced by the most  noticeable variant: the relocation of the motto from the beginning to the  snavid Erdman, Blake: Prophet against Empire ( 1 954;  rev. ed. Garden City, N .Y . :  Double­ day, 1 969), p .  13 r n . ;  Nancy Bogen , The Book of Thel: A Facsimile and Critical Text (Provi­ dence, R. l . :  Brown University Press, 1 97 1 ) , p. 3 .   9J use the term 'state' a s  Blake himself used i t .  But  the term i s  also used in  the graphic  arts to denote a particular 'state' of an engraving, and so it is worth noting that Blake sold  his plates in earlier states, thus allowing our philosophical and bibliographical uses of the  term to coincide.   </page> <page sequence="21"> Early Texts 2 4 1   end i n  copies N and 0. Those who see the motto as a 'moral' see i t  as  counseling Thel to accept experience (like the mole) , and not to protect  herself with symbols of privilege like the rod and the bowl. Shifting it to  the end would then reinforce a reading of the poem as a critique of Thel  and would place a space between us and the sympathetic impact of her  final speech. But we can also read the motto existentially and see it as  dismissing the visionary eagle in favor of the mole, who understands that  there is no 'vision' beyond 'experience . '  In that case Thel, who has en­ tered the darkness in which all transcendental consolations are dis­ solved, would actually have lived by the motto whose location at the end  would refigure it as a confirmation of nausea. As the significance of the  shifts depends on the meaning we attribute to the individual segment, so  the mobile structure of the text generates a radically perspectival read­ ing experience . Blake's new practice of reading has two unusual conse­ quences .  It creates a dialogue in which readers do not simply find an  ambiguity that is in the text, but open up from a different historical  vantage point possibilities that 'Blake' may not have entirely foreseen.  But by making us aware of how we construct the text from the perspec­ tive we bring to it, it also compels us to historicize that perspective and to  recognize it as constituted on the traces of other horizons of expectation  inscribed in the text and its reception history.  Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the text has to do with the  deferral of authority for the credal passages . For these passages are  either not spoken by the characters to whom they pertain, or are du­ biously authorized by an anthropomorphism that makes voice a figure.  Thus the conversation with the lily breaks up into two discursive seg­ ments, repeating itself so as to produce differences within the creed of  self-sacrifice, and displacing the enunciation of that creed between the  lily and Thel in such a way that it is finally spoken by no one . The lily  begins by pointing out that she , too, is vulnerable , but that God watches  over her, and when she "melts" in the summer (a pointedly gentle word  for 'withers') , it is "To flourish in eternal vales" (E4 ;  i : 24-25) .  The  notion of a lily's having an afterlife is of course a pathetic fallacy, and  that fact is registered in the transference of the discourse to Thel, who  sustains the fiction that death is not painful, but with complications that  betray an increasing anxiety. This time the lily's death is not part of a  natural cycle but is produced by others : by the lamb 'cropping' her  flowers (E4 ;  2 : 6) .  There is also no reward in eternity , nothing being  posited beyond the natural world . The continued pastoralization of  death masks a displacement, the significance of which Thel herself may  not grasp .  The consolation of 'eternity' has been dropped because it has  not satisfied Thel's desire for reassurance about this world . And the lily  has not dealt with the problem of unnecessary suffering implicit in the  </page> <page sequence="22"> 242 The Supplement of Reading  fact that the lamb eats the flower. In the second set of lines the lily is still  described as smiling in the face of her sorrows. But then these lines are  not spoken by the lily herself, but by Thel, nervously voicing what may  be the conventional wisdom. When Thel asks the lily to reconfirm her  aestheticization of suffering, the latter does not answer but refers her to  the cloud .  The cloud in fact does take Thel's suggestion for re-visioning  death as mutability to the appropriately pietistic conclusion. But the  cloud is also the only male character in the trio who speaks to Thel, a fact  that is of significance in terms of the gendering of voices that (as we shall  see) plays so important a role in this poem.  Perhaps the most disturbing of these deferrals comes in the final  chapter, where the clod, a female character, seemingly confirms the  cloud's wisdom. In response to Thel's identification of the worm with  unaccommodated man ("an infant wrapped in the Lilly's leaf") ,  the clod  assures Thel that God cherishes even the most ugly of things . Whether  the clod's reassurance that God values the worm who will eat her prop­ erly answers Thel's fear of becoming fertilizer is not something we shall  explore . But it is also notable that the worm, who lacks the cloud's airy  throne and lives in a house of clay, never adds its voice to the chorus of  reassurances. Instead, the clod speaks for the worm, who simply weeps .  Thus, when Thel finally decides to confront experience, she does so  from within a network of evasions and on the basis of what can be no  more than a representation of the worm's condition as a metaphor for  her own, the worm's silence marking a certain resistance to metaphor  and thus to the idealizing imagination. Or it may be that the clod does  not even claim to speak for the worm. It may be that because Thel has  addressed herself to the worm, she takes the clod's reassuring words as  applying to the worm and concludes that God cherishes it "With milk  and oil . "  (E6 ; 5 : 1 1 ) .  But while the clod is said to bend over the worm in  "milky fondness ,"  it is on the clod's head that God pours "his oil" (E5 ;  4 : 9 , 5 : 1 ) .  Whether the clod's words of wisdom refer to herself or also to  the worm is thus unclear. And functions like reference and metaphor  are in fact at the heart of this poem, which is set up as a conversation  with natural objects figured as speaking, and which thus brings to the  foreground the problem of how we perceive the world through lan­ guage. What is clear from the way discourses are juxtaposed and charac­ ters are made to speak for each other is that in the lived world reference  operates through metaphor and is thus fundamentally ambiguous . We  make one situation refer, by metaphorical extension, to another. The  ambiguity generated in the gap between the clod's words and Thel's  understanding of them raises a larger problem about the reference of  the abstract to the concrete . Can the clod's experience stand for that of  the worm or for that of Thel, and can credal abstractions refer to con­ crete existential situations?  </page> <page sequence="23"> Early Texts 243  The poem's self-reflection on its figures, and its operation as a semio­ tic screen on which readers must view their figures, is mobilized around  the central figure in the text, Thel. In both Thel and Visions Blake focuses  on female characters and both women use a language that is highly  figurative, naming their experience in terms of something else, as  though lacking unmediated access to their own lives. The depiction of  understanding as engendered through the intermediary of figures is  particularly striking in Thel, where the protagonist invents three figures  for herself-a flower, a cloud,  and a clod-and where she often speaks  of herself in the third person. The poem of course, is not about female  identity in the way Wollstonecraft's novels are . Rather, it is about an  aborted transition from innocence to experience that Blake represents  through a young girl . The questions it raises thus pertain first of all to  the semiotic status of woman in the economy of mythmaking. Or more  precisely, we can read woman as both a signifier, a figure for a certain  life situation,  and as a suppressed referent, someone who must be fig­ ured in certain ways to construct her as the appropriate signifier. This  crossing of figure and referent has the effect of interrupting the unam­ biguous functioning of the signifier, making it the site of a resistance to  any attempt to fit it into the system. The female figure-for she is always  a figure-thus becomes a mirror that reflects back the metaphors used  to compose her identity . And because she is a figure in an argument that  the poem puts into action but also textualizes, the text's reflection on its  own mode of production has two consequences . It draws attention to the  figures that support its argument, and it makes us consider the visionary  arrogance of using people as figures without regard for their experi­ ence. Using woman to promote a certain relationship between innocence  and experience, the poem raises the question of how we figure women,  and thus allows us to question the legitimacy of the way the relationship  is being constructed and evaluated.  In using a female figure to embody his 'myth, '  Blake therefore chooses  an overdetermined figure : one that is the site of cultural tensions, and  he thus engenders a dialogue between hegemonic and oppositional  readings of the myth. Blake would have been aware from Joseph  Johnson's radical circle that the rethinking of female identity was being  done partly in linguistic terms :  that writers like Mary Wollstonecraft  thought of women as constructed by language and reading, and of wom­ en writers as limited by the genres of experience available to them. By  focusing on a young girl at the point in cultural history when he was  writing, Blake suspends the ratification of any normative identity he or  we might construct for her through the use of culturally engendered  figures. It  is probably no accident that the poem is called "The Book of  Thel. "  The protagonist is on the threshold between innocence and expe­ rience , but also on the threshold between receiving an identity from  </page> <page sequence="24"> 244 The Supplement of Reading  others and constructing one for herself. As Thel proceeds through a  landscape that is obviously symbolic rather than real , and thus the scene  of various cultural inscriptions, she tries to read her identity in the book  of nature and thus to accept as natural the identity modeled for her by  others. But we are all the time aware that the book of nature is a revers­ ible trope : that the natural may be something written. Thel's behavior is  characteristically female . She does not assert her identity like the bard of  Experience, or even like the ungendered child of "Infant Joy,"  who says  with innocent directness, "I  happy am." Instead, she asks others to tell  her who she is and what she should do. This linguistic detour creates a  space between Thel and the identity offered her. Her own uncertainty  about accepting the prescription of the lily , cloud,  and clod is evident in  the fact that she must hear it three times . And because we are aware that  her passivity is gender-specific, we are hesitant to ask that she identify  with roles that she wants to assume yet projects as other. What is most  striking about the figures who try to reassure Thel is that they are all  feminine, behaviorally if not pronominally . The lily who suffers herself  to be eaten by the 'innocent' male lamb follows the feminine path of self­ sacrifice . The clod is associated with nurturing and pitying. Only the  cloud is male , and Blake's identification of him as such, in contrast to his  use of the figure elsewhere, 1 0  marks his desire to normalize a pattern  that demands the sacrifice of selfhood. It marks, in other words, the  difficulty of placing 'Blake , '  who seems to raise and suppress the ques­ tion of gender, who wants Thel to follow the advice she is given and who  also seems sensitive to her doubts . We should not minimize Blake's own  commitment to the 'message' of Eternity . Yet the very attribution of  gender to natural objects suspends this message in an anthropomor­ phism and raises the question of whether 'eternity' itself is not a cultural  construction. And paradoxically it is the fact that Blake makes one of  these characters male instead of making them all female that raises the  question of gender as a point of anxiety .  If  this approach to the poem constructs a feminist reader, it does so  partly as a paradigm for avoiding an archetypal reading that would  protect the text from any insertion into history . Blake's use of a female  protagonist allows him to experiment with a creed he could not other­ wise promulgate. The clod could not have offered the same advice if the  protagonist of the poem had been Ore. But insofar as the female figure  facilitates the articulation of this creed, the interruption of figure by  referent that occurs when we consider Thel as a 'real person' configures  ! OJn Visiom (iii : 7-8) Oothoon is a cloud rent by Bromion's thunders, and in Europe the  shadowy female is associated with clouds ( i : i  2). My point is not that clouds are female, but  that Blake does not always make them male.  </page> <page sequence="25"> Early Texts 245  a larger interruption of visionary argument by social and historical con­ siderations. To put it differently, 'Blake' argues for an approach to  experience that he seems to naturalize by associating it with traditional  female virtues, but he does so at a point when people are beginning to  question the nature of woman. He also makes his protagonist ambigu­ ously silent in the face of the female roles offered her by the figures she  finds in the book of nature . The result is that the text becomes a site for  the reader to produce a genealogy of its morals : an analysis of the  historicity of values that is not dissimilar from the one Blake himself  performs in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  Such a genealogy involves historicizing not only the poem but also  contemporary readings of it. The normalization of experience as some­ thing Thel ought to face comes from an effacement of its social dimen­ sion that makes it simply a temporal category, a stage of life .  This efface­ ment occurs through a placing of Thel's 'virginity' within a horizon of  expectations that is both male and modern. Thus, one possible reading  might reclaim 'Blake' as an advocate of free love by assuming the healthi­ ness of (sexual) experience, and thus the regenerative role of all 'experi­ ence' for achieving emotional wholeness. But how the reader is to place  herself in relation to Thel's virginity may well seem clearer now than it  did at the end of the eighteenth century, when 'sex' was interimplicated  in its social construction and had not yet been reconstructed as 'natural . '   Blake often does advocate an open embrace of sexual experience, and  yet the consequences of that experience in a poem like Visions seem to  justify Thel's fears. Insofar as virginity plays a symbolic role in the econ­ omy of the poem-which we literalize in using it to prescribe Thel's  conduct-Thel's desire to remain a virgin suggests that sometimes expe­ rience may be unavoidably, yet irrevocably, crippling. It does not dog­ matically suggest that, however. For Blake not only focused on Thel at a  threshold in her life that looks both backward and forward ; he also  focused on a female figure at a threshold in women's history. The semio­ tic function of the female figure is to be an open signifier in a way that a  male figure could not have been. Because of the increasing conscious­ ness among women writers about social conditioning, woman had be­ come a tabula rasa cleansed of previous cultural inscriptions and open to  new formulations of her identity. On the one hand, the liminal status of  woman at this point in history allows us to see trauma itself as socially  engendered rather than as a deep structure, a Freudian absolute. On the  other hand, the text raises the question of whether there is such a thing  as virginity, in the sense not of sexual innocence but of not yet being  written on. Already Thel seems inhabited by experiences she has not  had, by some collective unconscious that occupies the void of her not yet  having become anything. Her sense of nightmare is generated by a  </page> <page sequence="26"> 246 The Supplement of Reading  temporal metalepsis in which the future is already past. And in a larger  sense this metalepsis is a cultural structure that calls into question not  only virginity but any form of newness or origination, be it regeneration  in eternity or historical renewal.  In Visions of the Daughters of Albion Blake again contextualizes his re­ flection on organized innocence through a character whose gender  raises questions of cultural inscription. The narrative begins, like Thel,  with a dialogue between Oothoon and her figured self, in which the  marigold responds to her reluctance to pluck it : "  'pluck thou my flower  Oothoon the mild ! I Another flower shall spring" (E46 ; i : 8-g) . Most  critics see the hopes Oothoon projects onto the flower as enshrining the  poem's wisdom and assume that the world of experience will include  (re)generation.  Oothoon, as is well known, is raped by Bromion and  then rejected by Theotormon as soiled, on the basis of a classification of  woman as property. At first she internalizes the latter's standards,  but  then she counters them by refusing to treat him as property, offering  instead to procure girls for him and watch them copulate (E50;  7 : 2 3- 26) .  This generous offer supposedly marks her emotional regeneration,   for she has now entered the gift economy of feminists like Cixous ,  and  sees beyond the narrow perceptions of selfhood supposedly disdained  by Blake.   Given the way he later writes her into his dictionary of symbols , some  part of 'Blake' clearly does see Oothoon as achieving wholeness in a  poem that authorizes its myth by claiming to be a radically feminist  statement. But the early poem is also distinguished by an individual  focus that makes us see the system from the viewpoint of its participants.  As a mobile text that does not put wisdom in the "golden shrine" of the  marigold but exists only in its reading, the poem situates 'Blake's' per­ spective against its own margins. These margins emerge first of all in the  discrepancies between juxtaposed segments that repeat and displace  each other. Thus the argument might seem to duplicate the narrative.  But in beginning with Oothoon's love for Theotormon and ending with  her rape, it summarizes only the first seventeen lines of the narrative .  One way of viewing this discrepancy is to say that it juxtaposes the  merely factual account of Oothoon's experience with the much longer  inside view that focuses on what a person creates from the events that  bound her life .  Oothoon in the narrative deals constructively with the  rape, while in the argument she simply says, "But the terrible thunders  tore I My virgin mantle in twain" (E45 ; iii : 7-8) .  But then the fact that it  is the argument, not the narrative, that is spoken by Oothoon herself  raises the possibility that the narrative does not develop beyond line I 7  but continues the rape by dramatizing the rending apart of Oothoon's  psyche. Discrepancy is likewise the subject of the poem's motto : "The  </page> <page sequence="27"> Early Texts 247   Eye sees more than the Heart knows. "  Does this mean that the reader's  eye can see more than Oothoon's heart knows, and what in turn does she  know? Does the heart know only the pain of rape, while the visionary eye  can see beyond this experience? Or does the empirical eye see things to  which the heart, with its will to vision, is justifiably blind? To interpret  the motto is irrelevant, because we need to see it not as a hermeneutic  key but as a grammar of understanding. As such, it provides verbs that  lack predicates as well as personal subjects . It thus produces perceptual  positions that can be occupied by anyone and that will accordingly  change in the perceptions they generate. But it produces them in such a  way that the positions are diacritically constructed, and qualify or re­ verse each other so as to keep the meaning of the poem open.  At the heart of the poem's indeterminacy is Oothoon as a figure for  organized innocence. Damrosch is one of the few to note the Urizenic  images in which her generosity is described : l l   But silken nets and traps of adament will Oothoon spread,  And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold;  I 'll l ie beside thee on a bank &amp; view their wanton play  In lovely copulation bliss on bliss with Theotormon.   (E50;  7 : 2 3-26)  "Nets" and "traps," images even in this poem of dissimulation (E49 ;  5 :  1 8 , 6 :  1 0- 1 2 ) ,  mark Blake's awareness that there is something not quite  right in the representation of Oothoon as emancipated. Significantly,  several lines after she is thought to have unbound herself from Theotor­ mon's standards ,  she is still described as 'reflecting' his "image pure"  (E47 ;  3 : 1 6) ,  as culturally constructed by what she so passionately resists .  To oppose the designation of women as private property by becoming a  procuress is hardly liberated behavior even in terms of the ethic du­ biously described as 'free love . '  Not only does Oothoon still conceive  herself as an instrument of male pleasure ; she also visits on other women  a version of her own fate. We could (and to some extent we probably do)  argue that she is only a flawed type of organized innocence . But to  abstract from the material circumstances of Oothoon's response some­ thing of which it is a sign is a kind of essentialism.  Moreover, it is ques­ tionable whether a woman, once she allows herself to read as a woman,  would not see Oothoon's 'generosity' as a notion conveniently engen­ dered within a male discourse. Read psychologically rather than ty­ pologically, Oothoon's solution may well be a symptom of deep trauma.  One could speculate that her fantasy about other women copulating  1 1Leopold Damrosch, Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth (Princeton, N .J . :  Princeton Uni­ versity Press, 1 980), pp. 1 97-98.  </page> <page sequence="28"> 248 The Supplement of Reading  'openly' is a way of justifying to herself the enormous cost of her having  been open to the world of experience. Thus she imagines a scene in  which her openness is refigured so that it no longer opens women to  male compulsion, because their entry into the economy of pleasure is  voluntary. But it is significant that she does not participate in this scene,  marking both a silent doubt about her fantasy and the fact that she has  been emotionally crippled by the rape. Of significance here is the ambi­ guity raised by Oothoon's openness , as to whether she is actually raped  in a legal sense . 1 2  Oothoon had imagined a world in which that ambigu­ ity could not exist because there was no rape : a world in which she could  be open without opening herself to exploitation. At the end she reverts  to that utopia in a voyeuristic fantasy that sees exploitation as innocent  openness.   The problem of how to read Oothoon's cure throws into relief the  larger question of how the text's figuration of her discloses the geneal­ ogy of its own visionary morality . On one level the poem enacts a famil­ iar Blake pattern : the story of how a fall from innocence becomes the  dialectical ground for the imagining of a more genuine innocence. But it  is also a defamiliarization of that pattern, a pattern that operates by  substituting symbolic referents for literal referents , the spiritual story of  Oothoon's suffering and regeneration for the more disturbing physical  story of her rape. If the text dramatizes the power of imagination, it is  significant that the 'reality' it tries to transfigure is a rape, an event whose  sheer physicality thwarts attempts to read it figuratively . By figuring the  Blakean paradigm through the story of a rape, the poem calls into ques­ tion the very making of figures, crossing aesthetics with ethics and ask­ ing us whether it is right to use rape as a figure of something else. Blake's  own complicity in this displacement is marked by the curious fact that  Oothoon's rape is not simply refigured ; it is never actually named in the  poem. It enters the poem not only as a figure for other violations that  are similarly unnamed, but also through a figure : the figure of Brom­ ion's thunders , which Oothoon says tore "My virgin mantle in twain ."   Indeed, the narrator's repetition of this figure , "Bromion rent her with  his thunders" (£46 ; I :  i 6) ,  goes even further toward naturalizing the  event, effacing any mention of virginity or of the violent removal of  clothing. That the rape is from the beginning poeticized is what makes it  possible to compare Oothoon's loss of innocence to the plucking of a  1 2since it is Oothoon who plucks the marigold , it is not entirely clear that she is raped  according to then-prevailing legal definitions of the term, though it is clear enough that  Blake perceives what Bromion does as a rape, and most critics have accordingly treated it  as a rape. Leslie Tannenbaum, however, is an example of someone who takes the legal  interpretation,  thus opening the whole issue of 'openness ' :  Biblical Tradition in Blake's  Prophecies: The Great Code of Art (Princeton, N .J . :  Princeton University Press, 1 982 ) ,  p. 1 88 .   </page> <page sequence="29"> Early Texts 249  flower. And the fact that the unnatural is uneasily represented as natural  is what makes it possible to see Oothoon as responding positively to an  'experience' Thel could not see as normal .  This representation of Oothoon is in a sense a second rape : a linguistic  rape that repeats the original violation even as it criticizes it, by denying  Oothoon the right to speak her pain as it is. For Oothoon has not found  a language to express her emotions. Trying to articulate what she i.s in  her words, she also expresses that identity as something she is not  through the gaps between her words, through her cries and silences .   Though she speaks for most of the poem, unlike Thel who is repre­ sented by others, Oothoon's language is opaquely symbolic , as though  she has lost the literal referents of her words :   With what sense i s  i t  that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk?  With what sense does the tame pigeon measure out the expanse?  With what sense does the bee form cells ? have not the mouse &amp; frog  Eyes and ears and sense of touch? yet are their habitations .  And their pursuits, as different as their forms and as their joys :  Ask the blind worm the secrets of the grave, and why her spires  Love to curl round the bones of death ; and ask the rav'nous snake  Where she gets poison : &amp; the wing'd eagle why he loves the sun.  (E4 7 ;  3 : 2- 1 2 )  The hysterical crescendo of questions does not clearly say anything,  though valiant attempts have been made to explain them in terms of the  'system. '  In the first passage it seems that Oothoon is attributing to each  creature a sixth sense that makes it unique, thus asking Theotormon to  see her on her own terms by perceiving her through the organ of per­ ception unique to her. Yet the impression of a series of analogies ac­ cumulating conviction for this point of view is belied by the hetero­ geneous jumbling together of everything from chickens to snakes. Even  as we look for the common denominator in this chaos of analogies ,  we  are distracted by the resonances of individual analogies . Can Oothoon  praise the chicken for shunning the hawk, yet also view the fact that she  did not shun Bromion as a fortunate fall that allows her to see new  possibilities?  If  the "night is gone" that closed her "in its deadly black"  (E47 ; 2 : 29) ,  why does she image her new-found identity in terms of  poison and death as well as the wild ass refusing burdens? How we  construe the images is less important than the pathology of their form.  For Oothoon says nothing directly. Instead, she refers to chickens and  bees, creatures who do not so much provide her with useful analogies as  suggest that she cannot speak literally about what she feels. What she  feels is not of course clear, for the distance of her language from any  </page> <page sequence="30"> 250 The Supplement of Reading  literal referent is symptomatic not only of a distance between conven­ tionalized language and inward experience, but also of her alienation  from herself. Allowed to name her experience only symbolically,  Oothoon is cut off from her own body, not simply by a patriarchal order  but also by her own trauma, which leads her to seek figurative displace­ ments and ultimately to 'heal' herself in ways that perpetuate that order.  She has , as it were, a symbolic body,  a body of metaphors and  metonymies that we should not too easily take for truth. And the renova­ tion of that body projected by 'Blake' may likewise be symbolic, disem­ bodied.  The fact that organized innocence may still be unorganized is marked  for us by the movability of the frontispiece depicting Bromion and  Oothoon still invisibly bound together, with Theotormon on one side of  the entrance to a cave, his face averted. None of the characters face each  other, and the plate thus represents the traumatized stasis produced by  the rape, in which Oothoon's position is still determined by that of her  oppressors . Whether the transposition of the plate to the end in one  copy (A) and its repetition at both beginning and end in another (F) was  an accident is irrelevant. Clearly, these shifts represent someone's sense  of another way the poem asks to be read, and clearly , the way Blake  produces his texts allows them to exist in more than one version. Placing  the plate at the beginning seems to allow that the narrative develops  beyond its initial stasis. Placing it at the end gives a certain finality to its  bleak image of a psychologically frozen world . Because the plate in copy  A is actually more brightly colored than in some other copies, the pessi­ mism of the final placement is subject to revision . 1 3  But the point is that  its movability allows the meaning of the poem to be constructed by the  reader in a field of intertextual possibilities .  It would be easy to condemn Blake for imposing a male discourse on  the poem,  or to concur in what seems a celebration of free love. But the  author in this text is self-critically evasive . David Punter has pointed out  that the trauma is also Blake's : the trauma of a man who does not know  how to deal with what his culture has done to women . 1 4  It is interesting  in this context that Ortega y Gasset should relate metaphor to "the spirit  of taboo."  Metaphor, he says, "substitutes one thing for another-from  an urge not so much to get at the first as to get rid of the second . " 1 5  But  significantly , although Blake presents the rape figuratively , he does not  efface its violence. Indeed the tendency to naturalize rape is crossed and  1 3 In this copy the sun is rising, whereas in others it is setting, and in yet others the spaces  left for sun and sky are colored blue-black so as to efface the sun entirely.  14"Blake, Trauma and the Female," New Literary History 1 5 ( 1 984) :  475-90.  1 5The Dehumanization of Art and Other Writings on Art and Culture (New York: Doubleday,  1 956) ,  P· 3 1 .   </page> <page sequence="31"> Early Texts 2 5 1  suspended by a desire to dramatize other modes of exploitation such as  slavery and capitalism, by figuring them as forms of rape . The fact of  violence structures critically the space in which Blake must move as  reader of his own text. For violence constitutes its object as other, re­ moves it from the sphere of our own experience and thus of our under­ standing. In dealing with someone whose experience is unutterably  more painful than anything we ourselves know, the immediate response  is to find analogies from our own experience that will heal the rupture  created in cultural understanding. Not only must we explain an alien  experience to ourselves ; we must also explain ourselves to the other  person, contending with an obscure sense of complicity in her pain. This  complicity (which we also feel in the face of natural occurrences such as  death) may not stem from anything we have done, but simply from a  sense that we have hitherto been insensitive to what has now ruptured  our security . Breaking the social hermeneutic in which we all thought we  understood things in the same way, violence forces us to use language to  reestablish a sense of shared values, but compels us to recognize the  tenuousness of the bridges thus constructed. Blake is nervously aware  that images of plucked flowers and thunderstorms, with their attendant  promise of regeneration,  are analogies that do not identify Oothoon's  experience so much as refigure it as Blake wishes it were. This awareness  surfaces in the imagery of nets and traps, and in the fact that the front­ ispiece can be relocated as a coda. It also surfaces in the poem's recourse  to silence and cries. Oothoon 'howls' (E46 ; 2 :  1 2 )  and 'laments' (E47 ; 3 : 1 ) .   She i s  silent fo r  periods o f  u p  to a day (E47-48 ; 3 : 1 4 ,  4 : 2 5) and is  supported by a nonverbal chorus :  the daughters of Albion, who echo  back her "sighs" but not her words, as though her words are really  circumlocutions for sighs. It  is all too easy for us to read the poem  instead of hearing it, as the daughters do, and thus to reduce the dura­ tion of its silences from a day to a line . But these silences manifest the  gaps in the text where language cannot reach and force Blake's ideology  to know its own margins.  What I have suggested is a different perspective on the poem from the  visionary reading that we assume 'Blake' to want. But Blake may also be  uneasy about a reading that would incorporate Oothoon into his corpus,  fixing her in her symbolic body. As in Thel, the double reference of the  poem-both visionary (to Blake's system) and historical (to specific  events of the kind detailed in Stedman's narrative)-produces a crossing  of figure and referent in which the typological reading of Oothoon is  interrupted by a psychological and social reading that reconstructs her  as person rather than sign. This crossing becomes an occasion for us to  reconsider the kind of reading necessary to sustain Blake's system. Tan­ nenbaum suggests that for Blake typology is "synonymous with the ere- </page> <page sequence="32"> 2 5 2  The Supplement o f  Reading  ative process itself" and that by "defining Christ as the Imagination,  Blake adopts as his subject the typological process itself. " 16  Or to put it  differently , by placing Christ at the center of his phenomenology of  spirit, Blake represents imagination as typological and demands , for that  representation to be sustained , an archetypal reading that translates  individual experience into a central paradigmatic story. But the early  poems are too close to their social referents not to be aware of the  cultural imperialism that informs such reading as a will-to-power over  the text's own uncertainties. By writing for an audience composed of  men and women instead of sheep and goats, Blake calls into play instead  of effacing the cultural differences that the 'romantic imagination' tries  to dismiss. And inasmuch as rape is a metonymy in this poem for other  acts of psychic and political seizure, its resistance to being read figurally  marks a certain limit to the attempt to silence other forms of social  violation through imaginative transfiguration.
