R. Ammons, "Corsons Inlet" Martin Heidegger's phenomenological de-struction (Destruktion) of the Western onto-theo-logical tradition has shown that modern philosophy from Descartes to Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche, in completing the imperatives of a metaphysical or "logocentric" (and re-presentational) concept of truth, constitutes the "end of philosophy."l Simultaneously, in dis-closing the temporality of being which the logos as Word or Presence encloses, i.e., covers over and forgets, his destruction of the tradition points to a hermeneutics of being which is capable of the "surpassing of metaphysics" (Uberwindung), a post-modern hermeneutics of dis-covery, in which a dis-closed temporality is given ontological priority over Being.2 What I wish to suggest in this essay is that a destruction or - in Jacques Derrida's more recent, and, in literary studies, more familiar term - deconstruction of the Western literary/critical tradition will reveal an analogous significance: that the American New Criticism (and its recent extension in French Structuralism), in aestheticizing the literary text or, what really is the same thing, in coercing the experience of the text into a metaphysical hermeneutic framework, constitutes the completion of the Western literary tradition and thus the "end of criticism." To put it in a more immediate way, it will suggest that Modernist criticism, in fulfilling the traditional formal imperative to see the work of literary art from the end - i.e., as an autonomous and in-clusive object or, in the phrase adopted by most recent critics to characterize "Modern" literature, as a spatial form3 - has "accomplished" the forgetting of the processual nature and thus the temporal/historical being - the be-ing - of the experience it projects. As Derrida has suggested in his deconstruction of Heidegger's thought, Heidegger's late quest for originary language - "the one word" - tends to reappropriate the metaphysics he intended to overcome. His "hermeneutic" project in the essays on poetry, language, and thought, therefore, does not suggest an interpretive method radical enough to accomplish the task of breaking out of the impasse - the enclosure - into 422</page><page sequence="3">which the New Critical and Structuralist formalism has driven modern literary studies. It is, rather, his existential analytic in Being and Time, by which (through its hermeneutical violence) he intends to gain access into being, that points to a hermeneutics of literature commensurate with the crisis of contemporary criticism. In retrieving or, what is the same thing, in dis-covering the temporality of being that a recollective metaphysics covers over and forgets, it points to a hermeneutics of literature equivalent in its potentialities to that inhering in the open-ended post-Modern literature, which, in its iconoclasm, its breaking of the circle of closed form, is attempting to release time from form and being from Being and thus to activate the being of the reader as being-in-the-world. The quest for a new hermeneutics, therefore, requires a rethinking of Heidegger's existential analytic. This analytic, it must be remembered throughout, is a project in fundamental ontology, not in ethics. It is intended not to reveal the moral limitations of man but to provide access into the Seinsfrage, the being-question or, better, the question of what it means to be. In thus drawing this analogy between Western literature and Western philosophy, I am, it will be seen, in significant disagreement with Paul de Man's influential fundamental assumption - derived from Nietzsche's notion of art as the will to power and Derrida's apotheosis of writing over speech (dcriture over parole) - about the literary tradition: that literary texts, unlike critical texts - and myths - have never been self-deceived; that they have always been "fictional," i.e., characterized by a deliberate "play" that consciously takes the void and the radical difference between sign and meaning, language and empirical reality, for granted. Indeed, this essay is implicitly an effort to bring this assumption, which might be called a mystification of literary texts in reverse, into question, not to revalorize the authorless, the logocentric myth, but to demystify the literary text and the text of the literary tradition for the sake of hermeneutic dialogue. 11 What Heidegger "wrests" from the "falling" of everyday being - the derivative existence of the "they" (das Man)4 (SZ, 222) - in Being and Time is that Dasein is primordially a being-there as being-in-the-world or, to return to his source in Kierkegaard, as "interested" being-between (inter-esse). In the "beginning," in other words, he is an ontologically free and care-ful being-towards-death, thrown into the middle - both spatially and temporally - of an open-ended and thus uncanny (unheimliche) world, in which, as the etymology suggests, he finds himself not-at-home. As primordially free and care-ful, Dasein is a "being-ahead-of-itself" in the sense of "being-towards one's ownmost potentiality-for-being" (BT 41, 237; SZ, 193). Dasein's radical existential structure thus is his temporality. The existential analytic also discloses that Dasein as 423</page><page sequence="4">being-in-the-world "is" - comports himself toward things as they are - in two broad ways. He can "interpret" the "alien" and "uncanny" world - the Nothingness that his finitude, his being-towards-death, discloses - from a privileged logocentric vantage point so as to objectify or presence, and thus neutralize or annul by gaining distance from (by "over-looking"), its most threatening possibility - its temporality. This, which is the "natural" conduct of Dasein, i.e., how he comports himself "proximally and for the most part," is the mode of inauthenticity (Uneigentlichkeit): the derived not-my-ownness of everyday life and public interpretation which is in constant need of interpretation. Or he can acknowledge his finiteness and historicity and encounter or "meet" the things of the world as Nothing or, what is the same thing, as temporality, in pursuit of the ultimate meaning of being-in-the-world. This mode of standing-in occurs primarily when the instrumentalized world breaks down or, more appropriately, as we shall see, when a "rupture of reference" (Storung der Verweisung), a "break in the referential totality" (Bruch der Verweisungszusammenhi~nge), takes place (BT, 16, 105-06; SZ, 75-76). This is, of course, the mode of authenticity (Eigentlichkeit): the primordial my-ownness of individual life or of existential interpretation. In contrast to the logocentric mode of inauthentic comportment, it may be called, for reasons that will become clear, the ec-centric stance, the stance, for example, of Watt in the house of Knott, in Samuel Beckett's great postmodern novel.5 This distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity (and its relationship to the hermeneutic implications of the broken instrument) is at the heart of Heidegger's phenomenological analysis of the nature of truth and the problematics of its alternating concealment and disclosure, but it is too complex a subject to be treated directly here.6 It will suffice, for my purposes, to examine the fundamental and generic distinction within this broad antithesis - the authentic mood of Angst ("Anxiety" or, as I prefer to translate it, "Dread")7 and the mood of Furcht ("Fear"), its inauthentic counterpart - as a shortcut towards suggesting the thrust of Heidegger's destruction of the Western ontotheological tradition and its spatial hermeneutics, and the implications of his existential/phenomenological ontology and the temporal hermeneutics it calls for. If, further, we keep in mind the remarkable similarity between Heidegger's interpretation of Angst and Aristotle's "pity-and-terror," which it is the purpose of the tragic form to "purge," this analysis should also orient the reader as to the direction that the analogy with literature will take. The "rupture of the referential totality" discloses Dasein's primordial situation - his authentic Befindlichkeit (literally, "state of mind," but more accurately "the discovery of self as already in the world")8 - as one in which he finds himself in an alien and uncanny environment without reference points and boundaries. In this original 424</page><page sequence="5">realm, the fundamental mood of Dasein is dread, which, having temporality, has no thing or nothing as its object. Echoing Kierkegaard's definition in The Concept of Dread ("Nothing begets dread"),9 Heidegger writes: That in the face of which one has anxiety is characterized by the fact that what threatens is nowhere. Anxiety "does not know" [in terms of the propositional or derived knowledge of "calculative thinking"] what that in the face of which it is anxious is . . .[that] which threatens cannot bring itself close from a definite direction within what is close by; it is already "there," and yet nowhere; it is so close that it is oppressive and stifles one's breath and yet it is nowhere. (BT, 40, 231; SZ, 185)10 And again, in a passage from a later essay that both focuses sharply on the ungraspability of the nothing (or mystery) which is the "object" of dread and describes Heidegger's sense of the authentic phenomenological standpoint: In dread, as we say, "one feels something uncanny [unheimlich]." What is this "something" (es) and this "one"? We are unable to say what gives "one" that uncanny feeling. "One" just feels it generally (im Ganzen). All things, and we with them, sink into a sort of indifference. But not in the sense that everything simply disappears; rather, in the very act of drawing away from us everything turns towards us. This withdrawal of what-is-in-totality [this is the homogeneous and depthless world named and charted by the coercive logocentric language of assertion] , which then crowds round us in dread, this is what oppresses us. There is nothing to hold on to. The only thing that remains and overwhelms us whilst what-is slips away, is this "nothing."11 This dread that has no thing as its object and thus "nothing to hold on to" is, of course, a dread of being-in-the-world: "That in the face of which anxiety is anxious is nothing, ready-to-hand within-the-world." But this "nothing" of readiness-to-hand is grounded in the most primordial "something" - in the world. Ontologically, however, the world belongs essentially to Dasein's Being 425</page><page sequence="6">as Being-in-the-world [The reference to belonging here is a reference to the Dasein's intentionality as Care.] So if the "nothing" - that is, the world as such - exhibits itself as that in the face of which one has anxiety, this means that Being-in-the-world itself is that in the face of which anxiety is anxious. (BT, 40, 231-32; SZ, 187) Since, as we have seen, Dasein's being-in-the-world is a being-towards- death, we return to the inexorable conclusion that his anxiety about nothing is also and equiprimordially an anxiety about his temporality - and, of course, about his historicity: Anxiety thus takes away from Dasein the possibility of understanding itself, as it falls, in terms of the "world" and the way things have been publically interpreted [i.e., from the 'end']. Anxiety throws Dasein back upon that which it is anxious about - its authentic potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world .... which as something that understands, projects itself essentially upon possibilities. (BT, 40, 232; SZ, 187) The full ontological meaning of dread, and thus of its central import for Heidegger's destruction of the ontotheological tradition and his hermeneutics of being, does not become clear, however, until it is understood in the contrasting light of its inauthentic counterpart, fear. According to Heidegger (and in this he is virtually at one with every other existential phenomenologist since Kierkegaard), fear, unlike dread, has an object: "that in the face of which we fear is a detrimental entity within-the-world which comes from some definite region but is close by and is bringing itself close, and yet might stay away (BT, 39, 230; SZ, 185). Or again, in "What is Metaphysics?": "We are always afraid of this or that definite thing, which threatens us in this or that definite way. 'Fear of' is generally 'fear about' something. Since fear has this characteristic limitation - 'of' and 'about' - the man who is afraid . .. is always bound by the thing he is afraid of . ..."1 2 Since existence as such in the primordial not-at-home is intolerable, men seek to "flee in the face of death" and its ontological counterparts, time and nothingness, by "interpreting [these] publically": by transforming dread into fear or, since fear has its source not in no thing, but in some thing, by willfully objectifying (finding objects for) dread. They seek to transcend the uncanny not-at-home, in other words, by exerting the Will to Power over or, to use a term that postmodern writers have brought into question, by "humanizing" its nothingness.1 3 This coercive anthropomorphism, it is worth observing, is what Keats refers to as the "irritable reaching after fact or reason" of the man incapable "of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, 426</page><page sequence="7">doubts," in his letter on Negative Capability, a letter that, as Iris Murdoch's and Charles Olson's fundamental appropriation of its content testifies, becomes increasingly important for the contemporary literary imagination.14 This "solidification" of nothing thus domesticates (at-homes) the uncanniness (die Unheimlichkeit) of being-in-the-world, rendering it accessible or, better, ap-prehendable (i.e., capable of being taken hold of) by the mind. As Paul Tillich puts what Heidegger only hints at here, fear, as opposed to dread, "has a definite object . . . which can be faced, analyzed, attacked, endured. One can act upon it, and in acting upon it participate in it - even if in the form of struggle."115 If we recall that nothingness is synonymous with temporality, this reification of the primordial not-at-home suggests a further extension of Heidegger's phenomenological distinction, one which points significantly to the analogy with the Western literary/critical tradition, especially to its culminating Modernist manifestation. The impulse to reify dread takes the form of an imposition of a telos, an end, upon the nothingness of temporality from the beginning. As such, this impulse to "take hold of nothing" is also, and more fundamentally, an impulse to make the terrible mystery visible and thus pleasurable. This, of course, is what Derrida means when he speaks of logocentricism as a presencing of absence. Ultimately, as I shall try to suggest, the objectification of dread domesticates the not-at-home in the sense that it transforms the boundless temporality of being-in-the-world into a "world picture": 1) a flattened out, static, and homogeneous Euclidean space - a totalized and ontologically depthless system of referents (a map) - if the objectifying consciousness is positivistic or realistic; or 2) a self-bounded or sealed off and in-clusive image (icon or myth), if the objectifying consciousness is idealistic or symbolistic. In either case, this transformation allows Dasein to see existence from the beginning, i.e., all at once. In so doing it dis-stances him, i.e., disengages his Care, makes him an objective, a disinterested or care-less, observer of the ultimately familiar or autonomous picture in which temporality - its threat and its possibilities - has been annulled. To put it in terms that extend Heidegger's thought (but are in keeping with its spirit), what his existential/phenomenological analysis of the authentic/inauthentic structure of Dasein discovers is that the objectification of nothingness is the spatialization (and thus covering up) of time and, by extension, of being. None of Heidegger's commentators, as far as I know, has made the relationship between his phenomenological interpretation of dread as the objectification of nothing (in the sense of the spatialization of time) and his critique of metaphysics explicit. Nevertheless, this discovery made by way of the existential analytic is, I think, the ground of his destruction of the Western ontotheological tradition - of both its notion of truth and its understanding of ontology - which, though re-vealing an essential and continuing internal conflict between inauthenticity and authenticity, error 427</page><page sequence="8">and truth, concealment and disclosure, has nevertheless been characterized more and more by its "inauthentic" impulse. Thus, according to Heidegger, since the time of the classical Greek philosophers, the Western tradition has increasingly interpreted the word logos in the sentence "man is the animal who is endowed with logos (?woov oyov'eXov)" "as 'reason, 'judgment,' 'concept,' 'definition,' 'ground,' or 'relationship' " (BT 7, 55; SZ, 32), covering up and eventually forgetting in the hardening process its origin in XEyeLt ("to talk": Rede). And Rede, which in being equiprimordial with Dasein's Befindlichkeit (his original and inescapable being-in-the-world as thrown) and his Verstehen (his authentic understanding of Dasein's original being-in-the-world as potentiality- for-being), is radically temporal.16 (It is worth pointing out paren- thetically that in thus equating the logos as legein with temporality - Nothingness or Absence - Heidegger, at least in Being and Time, interprets authentic oral expression as a spontaneous existential act, as the "cry of its occasion,/ Part of the res itself and not about it,"1 7 as it were. As such it is a phenomenon quite different from Derrida's understanding of oral expression, which identifies speech with the oracular and thus with presence.) This "logocentric" interpretation of Dasein, according to Heidegger, resulted in the eventual acceptance of the derived notion of truth as correspondence - as agreement of the mind with its object of knowledge (Aristotle's homoiosis, St. Thomas' adequaetio intellectus et rei) - and its hermeneutic corollary - the propositional language of assertion (judgment) - as original and self-evident. Since judgment (i.e., correctness or accuracy of correspondence) is the goal of the relationship between the mind and its object, the epistemological impulse behind the traditional notion of truth is to take the object (thing or man) out of its existential/temporal context to render it a pure and shareable presence. In doing so Dasein as interpreter must transform his temporality into a series of "now points," must assume, that is, the inauthentic stance of that "awaiting [Gewairtigen] which forgets and makes present" (BT, 67, 389; SZ, 339) or, in the terms of this essay, which suspends and thus "spatializes" the temporal process. In this way, he achieves "objectivity": a distance from the originally experienced object which allows him to become a privileged "observer," one who "looks at" or, rather, "overlooks" (BT, 69, 413; SZ, 361) process synchronically. It is in this sense that the hardened traditional notion of truth as correspondence becomes static and visual and the hermeneutic expression of this truth (assertion) a "disinterested" representation (or, perhaps, re-collection) from the end. This is ultimately the hermeneutic point Heidegger makes in Being and Time when he contrasts the sentence "The hammer is too heavy" with the derived proposition (assertion) the sentence "The hammer is heavy." With this assertion, which, according to Heidegger, is in the 428</page><page sequence="9">"self-evident" mode of "common sense" (Husserl's "natural standpoint" prior to the phenomenological reduction), the primordial significance of the hammer undergoes a subtle but radical transformation. Grounded as it is on a "definite" and "developed way of conceiving" - as we shall see, the logos as presence - the assertion at the outset interprets the lived situation involving the hammer in such a way as to make it fit into (enclose it within) its pre-established "logical" structure. The hammer is reduced to a neutral object with a definite and fixed character: "the unexplained presupposition is that the 'meaning' of this sentence is to be taken as: 'This thing - a hammer - has the property of heaviness' " (BT, 33, 200; SZ, 152). Thus a concealment, a covering over, takes place. Something with which we act in the world (a tool) becomes a "what" about which we assert, or as Heidegger would say in amplifying Husserl's terminology, something as "ready-to-hand" (zuhanden) becomes something "present-at-hand" (vorhanden). The "hermeneutic'as' " dims into the "apophantic 'as.' " That is, something "lived" (experienced in circumspect concern) becomes something "observed" disinterestedly in the realm of "superficiality" (Ausserlichkeit) (BT, 68, 389; SZ, 339), i.e., in a timeless, static, and homogeneous space, "a worldless world": When an assertion has given a definite character to something present-at-hand, it says something about it as a "what" [This is the "apophantic 'as' "] . . . The [hermeneutic] as-structure of interpretation has undergone a modification. In its function of appropriating what is understood, the "as" no longer reaches out into a totality of involvements .... The "as" gets pushed back into the uniform place of that which is merely present-at-hand.... The levelling of the primordial "as" of circumspective interpretation to the "as" with which presence-at-hand is given a definite character is the specialty of assertion. Only so does it obtain the possibility of exhibiting something in such a way that we just look at it. (BT, 33, 200-01; SZ, 158. My emphasis.) In thus pointing to this "flattening" (Einebnung) or "levelling down" (Nivellierung) of the Lebenswelt of circumspect concern, Heidegger suggests that the traditional notion of truth as correspondence is not merely a derivative but also a "spatial-izing" mode of truth, indeed, that its derivative nature is precisely defined by its "spatialization" of temporal experience, its transformation of temporality into a self-contained "referential surface" (map) or self-reflexive surface (icon): When space is discovered non-circumspectively by just looking at it, the environmental regions get neutralized 429</page><page sequence="10">to pure dimensions. Places - and indeed the whole circumspectively oriented totality of places belonging to equipment ready-to-hand - get reduced to a multiplicity of positions for random Things. The spatiality of what is ready-to-hand within-the-world loses its involvement-character [existential-character], and so does the ready-to-hand. The world loses its specific aroundness; the environment becomes the world of Nature. The "world," as totality of equipment ready-to-hand, becomes spatialized [verraumlicht] to a context of extended Things which are just present-at-hand and no more. The homogeneous space of Nature shows itself only when the entities we encounter are discovered in such a way that the worldly character of the ready-to-hand gets specifically deprived of its worldhood. (BT, 23, 147; SZ, 112)18 Similarly, and by extension, Heidegger's destruction of the Western ontotheological tradition discloses that, despite the positivistic and idealistic variations, its essential character has been increasingly its impulse to close off and thereby spatialize time as a means of transforming the mystery of being (das Nichts or, later, die Erde) into certainty. For what he discovers in his destruction is that behind the "self-evident" and privileged logos as reason of the traditional notion of truth - and the consequent concealment of being - lies a more fundamental and inclusive "self-evident" ontological concept: the logos as eternal essence, the logos, that is, variously referred to in the history of Western ontology as "the Word," "the Beginning," "God," "The Omega," "the Absolute Idea," "the Unmoved Mover," "the Final Cause," "the Principle of Causality," or, as Heidegger has focused it for us, the logos as "permanent presence" (ovata).19 (This term is, of course, the source of Derrida's influential distinction between the logocentric tradition of "presence" and his phenomenology of "absence.") What Heidegger discovers, in other words, is that the Western ontotheological tradition, from Plato and St. Thomas to Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and modern science, has been essentially a metaphysical tradition, in which, according to its familiar medieval formulation, essence precedes (is ontologically prior to) existence. This implies, of course, that the tradition has "grounded" this meaning of being IetEt-ta-pVotKCi - "beyond-what-is as such"20 (the "what-is" being the concrete processual realm of things-as-they-are, of actuality), both in the related senses of after and above, from the distance of the end or telos. As such, it has been a tradition that has reified being, transformed verbal be-ing into nominal Being, into a super thing (summum ens) at rest, which contains and determines all other things (Seiende), thus "relegating becoming to the realm of the apparent."21 In the final terms 430</page><page sequence="11">of Heidegger's deconstruction of the Platonic turn (the reference to understanding should be marked): This transformation of unconcealment [a-letheia] by way of distortion to undistortion and thence to correctness must be seen as one with the transformation of physis [being] to idea, of logos as gathering to logos as statement. On the basis of all this, the definitive interpretation of being that is fixated in the word ousia now disengages itself and comes to the fore. It signifies being in the sense of permanent presence, already-thereness. What actually has being is accordingly what always is, aei on. Permanently present [according to the metaphysical tradition] is what we must go back to in comprehending and producing: the model, the idea. Permanently present is what we must go back to in all logos, statement; it is what lies-before, hypokeimenon, subjectum. From the standpoint of physis, emergence, what was always-there is the proteron, the earlier, the a priori.22 This fundamental disclosure of Heidegger's phenomenological destruction of the ontotheological tradition has, of course, often been noted. What needs to be thematized, however, especially in the context of the question of the relation between Heidegger's thought and the Western literary tradition and its hermeneutics, is that this reification of existence is a spatialization of time or, as the etymology of "metaphysics" clearly suggests, constitutes a coerced metamorphosis of temporality into image or picture, i.e., an aesthetic structure the model or prototype of which is the plastic or architectonic - visual - arts. It is no accident, as Heidegger implies, that the Western tradition has valued the eyes over the other senses ever since Plato gave them ontological priority. This extension of the meaning of the metaphysical reification of being to include the spatialization of time is implicit from the beginning in Heidegger's thought, especially, in Being and Time, in his pervasive equation of "inauthentic" covering up with sight.23 But it receives one of its most explicit and, because it recalls the phenomenological distinction between dread and fear in Being and Time, most meaningful expressions for my purposes in the important but little known essay significantly entitled "Die Zeit des Weltbildes" ("The Time of the World Picture"), where Heidegger speaks of the Cartesian Umkehrung (reversal) as the point in Western history after which the divine Word of the medieval dispensation becomes increasingly the willfully aggressive logos of human subjectivity in Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Nietszche, and Modern Science, thus pointing to the "end of philosophy." The domestication of temporal 431</page><page sequence="12">existence since Descartes, according to Heidegger, takes the form of "re-presentations" (Vorstellen) " 'placing' the ob-jectum before or out in front of the subject."24 In thus object-ifying the Seiende (the existent or thing as it is), in thus re-placing it in front of our eyes as objective presence whose relationship to us is determined in advance by us, the strategy of re-presentation transforms time into picture, immobilizes be-ing and renders it safe and utterly manageable. "This objectification of the Seiende," Heidegger writes, "is accomplished by a re-presentation (vorstellen) directed at making whatever exists present to itself in such a way that the calculating man can be sure, that is to say, certain, of it."25 (The strategy of re-presentation, it is worth pointing out, is remarkably similar in essence to Kierkegaard's decisive interpretation and critique of Platonic and Hegelian or, what for him is the same thing, "aesthetic" re-collection - and even reminds us not only of Wordsworth's but also of the Proustians' and, by extension, of the Modernists' methodology of "remembrance.")26 Under the aegis of the metaphysical strategy of the Vor-stellen, therefore, the temporal world at large becomes explicitly what I have suggested it is implicitly in Being and Time: a flattened out or depthless re-presentation of the world in miniature, an in-clusive "World Picture" (Weltbild), in which everything, including man, has been transformed into the derived, i.e., timeless and "worldless," mode of present-at-handness (Vorhandenheit). This means, of course, that the "things themselves" are in fact seen as a whole at a distance from their primordial context - are located (permanently fixed) within a system of mathematically or geometrically determined coordinates and thus made fully certain, manipulable, and/or pleasurable. The central passage from Heidegger's neglected essay deserves extended quotation for the suggestive possibilities it generates about the aesthetic/hermeneutic implications of the metaphysical spatialization of (temporal) being: What is that - a "world picture" (Weltbild)? Obviously an image (Bild) of the world (Welt). But what does "world" mean here? What does "image mean? "World" stands here as the designation of being in its totality (der Seienden im Ganzen). The name is not limited to the cosmos, to nature. History is also part of the world. But even nature and history, and both reciprocally interpenetrating each other in the process of transcending each other, do not exhaust the world. This designation means also the foundation of the world (Weltgrund), no matter how its relationship to the world is conceived. As for the word "image," it makes us think first of the re-production (Abbild) of something. A "Weltbild" would therefore be like a painting of being in 432</page><page sequence="13">its totality. However, "Weltbild" says more. We understand by this the world itself, being in its totality, as it imposes its binding norms on us. "Image" means here not a copy, but that which is understood in the idiom: we are in the picture with respect to something (Wir sind iOber etwas im Bilde). That is to say: the thing itself presents itself to us to the degree that it exists for us. To put myself in the picture means: to represent to oneself (vor sich stellen) the being itself as it exists in itself, and as so presented, to keep it constantly before one. But one decisive element is still lacking in the essence of the image. "We are in the picture" means not only that the thing is simply present to us in its representation, but we hold it before us in all that which belongs to it and constitutes it as a system. "To be in the picture" resonates with the idea of knowing the answers, of having a preconceived framework, of being oriented towards the issue in question. When the world becomes an image, being as a totality is conceived and fixed as that on which man is able to orient himself, which, therefore, he wishes to bring and to fix before himself and thus in a decisive sense to re-present to himself. "Weltbild," essentially understood, means, therefore, not a picture of the world, but the world conceived as picture. Being in a totality is now so understood that it is truly being only in the degree to which it is asserted and fixed by the man who represents and produces it. When a Weltbild emerges, an essential decision occurs concerning being in its totality. The Being of being (Sein des Seienden) is henceforth sought in the represented being of the being (Vorgestelltheit.)27 To put it succinctly, then, Heidegger's destruction of the Western ontotheological tradition discovers that its metaphysical orientation manifests itself in a coercive "permanentizing" of being (Bestand- sicherung), and this discovery reveals the platonic reality to be ap- pearance, eidos (Idea), to be, in fact, an eidolon, an idol or image.28 But we can be even more explicit than Heidegger and his commentators in thematizing the essential nature of this "permanent-izing." In "seeing" existence meta-ta-physika, in grounding temporal existence in presence, the beginning and the middle in the end, being in Being, the tradition's spatialization of time, we may add, assumes its ultimate iconic form in the auto-telic and inclusive circle, whose center is the logos as presence. Put in terms of this extension of the destruction, the assumption by the tradition 433</page><page sequence="14">of the ontological priority of Being over temporality recalls, of course, Plato's abiding circular image of history ("The Great Year"): the myth of eternal repetition, as reinterpreted by Greek speculation [Mircea Eliade says, with reference primarily to Plato] has the meaning of a supreme attempt toward the "staticization" of becoming, toward annulling the irreversibility of time. If all moments and all situations of the cosmos are repeated ad infinitum, their evanescence is, in the last analysis, patent; sub specie infinitatis, all moments and all situations remain stationary and thus acquire the ontological order of the archetype.... From the point of view of eternal repetition, historical events are transformed into categories and thus regain the ontological order they possessed in the horizon of archaic spirituality [in illo tempore, ab origine] .29 But it also evokes the circular image of time and history of Modernists like Yeats, Joyce, Proust, Woolf, and Eliot (and of the "new" critics, who modelled their poetics on it) - and, by contrast, the essential strategy of the postmodern literary imagination: the formal effort by contemporary writers like Sartre, lonesco, Beckett, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson to break or break out of the symbolic circle. In so doing it also makes explicit the logocentric parallel between the philosophic and literary traditions and suggests in what sense both are "coming to the end." Thus the implications of the ontotheological tradition for the hermeneutics of understanding become clear. In transforming the openness of existence into a closed circle, emptied of time, i.e., capable of being "looked at" synchronically ("object-ively"), the metaphysical standpoint negates possibility, the originary interrogative (dialogic) mood, in favor of a derived indicative mood in which the answer is ontologically prior to and determines the question asked of being. From the privileged vantage point of this "objective" distance from existence, interpretation, as I have already suggested, takes the form of suspending the temporal process, of transforming the time of experience (and text) into "a pure sequence of 'nows'... in which the ecstatical character of primordial temporality has been levelled off" (BT, 65, 377; SZ, 329). Interpretation becomes, in other words, an "awaiting [Gewartigens30] which [unlike the "anticipatory resoluteness" of authentic Dasein which is running "ahead-of-itself" in Care] forgets and makes present" (BT, 68, 389; SZ, 339). It becomes a forgetful presenting which is now seen to mean "envisaging" (Ver-gegenwartigen) (BT, 69, 410; SZ, 359), a "deliberative" (BT, 69, 410; SZ, 359) or, in Heidegger's later term, "calculating" awaiting 434</page><page sequence="15">that, on the basis of the logos, expects everything to cohere. Like the classical detective, one knows he will "get the picture," as it were, in the end, because it is ontologically prior to the process. But more important, since the iconic circle becomes increasingly the re-presentation of a subjective need for certainty, hermeneutics gets subordinated to the anthropomorphic concept of correctness, to the derived principle of truth as "adequaetio intellectus et rei," which, in beginning from the end, inevitably results in the willful coercion of the vital particulars into the circle - i.e., in the Will to Power over process. In spatializing time, the metaphysical perspective closes off the possibilities of existence and thus transforms the hermeneutic process into a vicious circle. The metaphysical is a genealogical perspective, the circle of which provides a spatial "insight" that at the same time shuts off - "blinds" - the interpreter to the more primordial and problematic temporality of being. Further, it has been the "fulfillment" of the metaphysical tradition and the achievement of an analogously absolute hermeneutic methodology in the "modern" period that, paradoxically, has disclosed the temporality to which the West has been blind and reactivated - remembered - the question of being that it has forgotten. To put it in another way, it has been the completion of the metaphysical "world picture" that has thematized the "lack," that has "ruptured" the referential surface, as it were, and given rise to the need to "surpass" both metaphysics and the vicious circle of genealogical interpretation of the "texts" of particular moments of history and of the text of history at large. 111 The implications of Heidegger's destruction of the ontothe- ological tradition for Western literary history should by this time have become explicit to anyone conversant with that history. It suggests that, despite the alternations between its idealistic and realistic manifestations - and the significant exceptions to its binary structure - the Western literary tradition from the classical Greeks to Proust, Joyce, Yeats, and Eliot has also been by and large, and increasingly, a metaphysical or logocentric tradition motivated by the Will to Power over existence. It has been a tradition, that is, in which the work of literary art, like its ontotheological counterpart, the metaphysical "systems" of Plato, of Aquinas, of Descartes, of Liebnitz, of Hegel, constitutes an increasingly willful objectification of the "mystery" (Nothingness) - a spatialization of the temporality of being - that has its ultimate raison d'6tre in the growing need (generated by "break downs") to gain (aesthetic) distance from the dreadful ambiguities, the uncanniness (Unheimlichkeit), of the immediate, i.e., original, Situation. Indeed, it is precisely the historical hardening of the impulse to spatialize time and the consequent 435</page><page sequence="16">"forgetting" of the primordial temporality of the being of the literary text that constitutes the "Western literary tradition." The essential validity of the analogy - and the enormously significant implications for literary history it discovers - may be suggested, even by brief reference to the broad continuity existing from Aristotle's poetics to that of Modernism, by exposing the "metaphysical" assumption that constitutes the ground both of Aristotle's poetics of mimesis (which, we must not forget, governed or mirrored the making of serious literature from classical Greece to the beginning of the twentieth century) and of the iconic poetics of Modernism. Thus, when Aristotle, using Sophocles' Oedipus as his ostensible point of departure, says in the Poetics that "the plot is the first principle and, as it were, the very soul [read logos] of tragedy," his structural model, in fact, is the teleological universe of his Metaphysics. Like that universe, the Aristotelian literary work is defined by a beginning that generates discords, a middle in which the discords intensify into crisis, and an end which not only resolves the discords but, like an epiphany (i.e., a simultaneous perception of the unified totality), reveals that the discords are, in fact, appearance, the result of partial or immediate experience. That is, like Aristotle's metaphysical universe, the Aristotelian literary work is grounded in a telos, an unmoved mover, a logos as presence, that determines and gives significance to the action- the events, the history, as it were - of the text from the end, meta-ta-physika. Since the Being (or Form) of the work is ontologically prior to its being (the temporal medium and the process it articulates) the essential formal imperative of the Aristotelian mimetic theory is thus the "spatialization of time." The structuralist demand to make time into an integral plot, "an action that is complete in itself, forming a whole of a sufficient magnitude or extent," is a demand to make an inclusive, self-bounded, or autotelic microcosm of the macrocosm, a "world picture" in miniature, that mediates the apparent nothingness of immediate, of existential, experience. In thus transforming time into an inclusive spatial circle, in thus letting us "see" the universe as an ordered and meaningful whole, the Aristotelian work dis-engages the anxious beholder from the world, generates aesthetic distance. As Heidegger might put it, Dasein as being-in-the-world is "disburdened" (BT, 27, 165; SZ, 127) of his existence and "volatilized" (BT, 25, 153; SZ, 117), becomes, like Kierkegaard's ironist, a "free floating" spectator (BT, 26, 160; SZ, 124).31 To interpret Aristotle's familiar terminology in the phenomenological light of Heidegger's destruction, by imposing an end (in both senses of the word) on being-in-the-world, the Aristotelian poetics of mimesis reconciles the opposing and dis-locating (or un-homing) motions of pity and terror - the anxiety of nothing which is the basic existential mood of Dasein's original Situation, his awareness of being thrown into the boundless and uncanny world or not-at-home - into a genealogical dialectic. In reconciling the 436</page><page sequence="17">antithetical energies of anxiety, in achieving equilibrium, as it were, the Aristotelian form then brings the "spectator's" restless soul into repose. This aesthetic spatialization and transcendence of temporality - this at-homing that arrests the motion of the anxious consciousness of being-in-the-world - is, of course, what Aristotle calls catharsis. 32 Seen in the light of the conventional interpretation of the "Aris- totelian" literary tradition, "Modernist" literature - by which I mean the literature of the Symbolist/Imagist movement and the critical theories modelled on the symbolist poem - appears to constitute a significant li- terary revolution. This appearance is enhanced by the pervasive Modernist reaction against the "Aristotelianism" of the positivistic or "well-made" fiction (and drama) of the nineteenth century, against what Virginia Woolf calls the "materialistic novel" in her famous essay "Modernist Fiction," and what T. S. Eliot calls "the narrative method" in his famous review of Joyce's Ulysses.33 Interpreted from the phenomenological standpoint of Heidegger's destruction of the ontotheological tradition, however, Modernism now can be understood as simply another, though in many respects more aggressive, "metaphysical" effort to repair the broken instrument or, to use the essential terms of this essay, the referential surface ruptured by the breakdown of the logocentric tradition. Indeed, as I have suggested, Modernism - and especially its critical/hermeneutic counterpart, i.e., the New Criticism and, more recently, Structuralism - can be seen to constitute a "fulfillment" - and end - of the Western literary tradition analogous to that arrived at by modern philosophy. Exacerbated by the breakdown of the Judeo-Christian and positivistic world pictures, that is, the Modernist literary impulse to perceive existence meta-ta-physika, to spatialize temporality into the closed or, rather, inclusive eternal (iconic) circle becomes, like theCartesian re-presentation, the Hegelian system, and the Nietzschean Will to Power, more or less absolute - and thus disclosive. This "end" of the Western tradition, from its most elemental to its most inclusive expression, is written in the following by now famous but still to be understood passages from the documentary history of Modernism: 1. T. E. Hulme (explicating Wilhelm Worringer's distinction between the "urge to empathy" of Western humanistic art and the "urge to abstraction" of "archaic," Byzantine, and oriental art in behalf of the neo-abstractionism of the Modernist revolution): This art ["Greek art and modern art since the Renaissance"] as contrasted with geometrical art can be broadly described as naturalism or realism.... The source of the pleasure felt by the spectator before the products of art of this kind is a feeling of increased 437</page><page sequence="18">vitality, a process which German writers on aesthetics call empathy (Einffhlung). . ... we can say that any work of art we find beautiful is an objectification of our own pleasure in activity, and our own vitality .... Putting the matter more simply we may say that in this art there is always a feeling of liking for, and pleasure in, the forms and movements to be found in nature. It is obvious therefore that this art can only occur in a people whose relations to outside nature is such that it admits of the feeling of pleasure in its contemplation. Turn now to geometrical art. It most obviously exhibits no delight in nature and no striving after vitality. Its forms are always what can be described as stiff and lifeless. The dead form of a pyramid and the suppression of life in a Byzantine mosaic show that behind their arts there must have been an impulse, the direct opposite of that which finds satisfaction in the naturalism of Greek and Renaissance art. This is what Worringer calls the tendency to abstraction.... It can be described most generally as a feeling of separation in the face of outside nature. While a naturalistic art is the result of a happy pantheistic relation between man and the outside world, the tendency to abstraction . . . occurs in races whose attitude to the outside world is the exact contrary of this.... Take . . . the case of primitive people. They live in a world whose lack of order and seeming arbitrariness must inspire them with a certain fear . . . The fear I mean here is mental, however, not physical. They are dominated by what Worringer calls a kind of spiritual "space-shyness" in face of the varied confusion and arbitrariness of existence. In art this state of mind results in a desire to create a certain geometric shape, which, being durable and permanent shall be a refuge from the flux and impermanence of outside nature .... In the reproduction of natural objects there is an attempt to purify them of their characteristically living qualities in order to make them necessary and immovable. The changing is translated into something fixed and necessary. This leads to rigid lines and dead crystalline forms, for pure geometrical regularity gives a certain pleasure to men troubled by the obscurity of outside appearance. The geometrical line is something absolutely 438</page><page sequence="19">distinct from the messiness, the confusion, and the accidental detail of existing things. - "Modern Art and its Philosophy," in Speculations (c. 1913) 2. Ezra Pound (defining Imagism): An 'Image' is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time.... It is the presentation of such a "complex" instantaneously which gives that sense of sudden liberation: that sense of freedom from time and space lim its. ... - "A Few Don'ts," Poetry, 1, No. 6 (March 1913) 3. James Joyce (or rather Stephen Dedalus, explaining the cathartic effect of his "iconic" or "epiphanic" poetics of stasis): - You see I use the word arrest. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emotions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing. - A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) 4. T. S. Eliot (extending the Image, the "objective correlative," to include myth): In using the myth [of the Odyssey], in manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity, Mr. Joyce is pursuing a method which others must pursue after him. . . . It is simply a way of controlling, or ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history. It is a method already adumbrated by Mr. Yeats, and of the need for 439</page><page sequence="20">which I believe Mr. Yeats to have been the first contemporary to be conscious. It is a method for which the horoscope is auspicious. Psychology (such as it is, and whether our reactions to it be comic or serious), ethnology, and The Golden Bough have concurred to make possible what was impossible even a few years ago. Instead of narrative method, we may now use the mythical method. It is, I seriously believe, a step toward making the modern world possible for art. ... - "Ulysses, Order, and Myth," The Dial (1923) 5. Cleanth Brooks (defining the ironic poetry of the "Metaphysical" Tradition - the poetry, as he observes repeatedly, in which "the structure of inclusion is the basic structure"): Compare the "tough reasonableness" of Eliot's poetry of wit with the invulnerability to irony of Richards' poetry of synthesis; the "alliance of levity and seriousness" with Richards' unification of opposed impulses; Eliot's "sensibility which devours any kind of experience" with Richards' statement that "tragedy . . is perhaps the most general, all-accepting, all-ordering experience known. It can take anything within its organization." One may suggest one more definition of metaphysical poetry, a definition based on Richards' terms: it is a poetry in which the opposition of the impulses which are united is extreme. Or, to base oneself directly on Coleridge: it is a poetry in which the poet attempts the reconciliation of qualitites which are opposite or discordant in the extreme. Such a definition of poetry places the emphasis directly on the poet as maker. It is his making, his imagination that gives the poem its poetic quality, not some intrinsic quality (beauty or truth) of the materials with which he builds his poem. The metaphysical poet has confidence in the power of the imagination. He is constantly remaking his world by relating into an organic whole the amorphous and heterogeneous and contradictory. - Modern Poetry and the Tradition (1939) 440</page><page sequence="21">6. Joseph Frank (summing up his definition of Modernism): Allen Tate, speaking of the Cantos, writes that Ezra Pound's "powerful juxtaposition of the ancient, the Renaissance, and the modern worlds reduces all these elements to an unhistorical miscellany, timeless and without origin"; and this is called the "peculiarly modern quality" of all the work we have before us - they all maintain a continual juxtaposition between aspects of the past and the present, in such a way that both are fused in one comprehensive view.... By this juxtaposition of past and present, as Allen Tate realized, history becomes unhistorical: it is no longer seen as an objective, causal progression in time, with distinctly marked out differences between each period, but is sensed as a continuum in which distinctions between past and present are obliterated. Just as the dimension of depth has vanished from the plastic arts [in the work of Modernist abstract painting and sculpture], so the dimension of depth has vanished from history as it forms the content of [the major works of modern literature]: past and present are seen spatially, locked in a timeless unity which, while it may accentuate surface differences, eliminates any feeling of historical sequence by the very act of juxtaposition .... The objective historical imagination, on which modern man has prided himself, and which he has cultivated so carefully since the Renaissance, is transformed in these writers into the mythical imagination for which historical time does not exist - the imagination which sees the actions and events of a particular time merely as the bodying forth of eternal prototypes .... And it is this timeless world of myth, forming the common content of modern literature, which finds its appropriate aesth-tic expression in spatial form. - "Spatial Form in Modern Literature" (1945) 7. Claude Levi-Strauss (analyzing "the small-scale model or miniature ... as the universal type of the work of art" from a point of view that becomes the ground of structuralist poetics): What is the virtue of reduction either of scale or in the number of properties? It seems to result from a sort of reversal in the process of understanding. To understand a 441</page><page sequence="22">real object in its totality we always tend to work from its parts. The resistance it offers us is overcome by dividing it. Reduction in scale reverses this situation. Being smaller, the object as a whole seems less formidable. By being quantitatively diminished, it seems to us qualitatively simplified. More exactly, this quantitative transposition extends and diversifies our power over a homologue of the thing; and by means of it the latter can be grasped, assessed and apprehended at a glance. A child's doll is no longer an enemy, a rival or even an interlocutor. In it and through it a person is made into a subject. In the case of miniatures, in contrast to what happens when we try to understand an object or a living creature of real dimensions, knowledge of the whole precedes knowledge of the parts. And even if this is an illusion, the point of the procedure is to create or sustain the illusion, which gratifies the intelligence and give rise to a sense of pleasure which can already be called aesthetic on these grounds alone. - La Pens6e Sauvage (1962) When, therefore, we consider that the American New Criticism (and, more recently, French Structuralism) finds its paradigm in the Modernist literature of "spatial form," in that modern literature, more specifically, which tends to model itself on the abstract plastic or iconic arts - of Cezanne, Picasso, Modigliani, Bromberg, Lewis, Gaudier- Brzeska, Epstein, and Brancusi - we begin to perceive the un- examined metaphysical assumptions that lie behind its fundamental commitment to the autonomy - the auto-telic (self-bounded or self-inclosed) status - of the literary work and thus also the spatializing imperatives of its exegetical frame of reference. We begin to understand, in other words, that the New Critical and Structuralist assumption that a poem is an object (Seiendes) or, to put it in terms of its best known formulation, that "A poem should not mean/ But be,"34 demands a hermeneutics which begins the interpretive process from the end - meta-ta-physika - and thus a methodological suspension, a making present or presenting, of the temporality of a text (its words) similar to that demanded by the metaphysical orientation of the Western ontotheological tradition. It will not require more than one reference to perceive that what Joseph Frank says unquestioningly about the exegetical imperatives of "Modern" literature applies equally to New Critical (and Structuralist) hermeneutics: Esthetic form in modern poetry, then, is based on a 442</page><page sequence="23">space-logic that demands a complete re-orientation in the reader's attitude towards language. Since the primary reference of any word-group is to something inside the poem itself, language in modern poetry is really reflexive: the meaning-relationship is completed only by the simultaneous perception in space of word-groups which, when read consecutively in time, have no comprehensible relation to each other. Instead of the instinctive and immediate [read "primordial"] reference of words and word-groups to the objects or events they symbolize, and the construction of meaning from the sequence of their references, modern poetry asks its readers to suspend the process of individual reference temporarily until the entire pattern of internal references can be apprehended as a unity.35 Thus, like its philosophical counterpart, the "objective" or "disinterested" hermeneutics of Modernism inevitably becomes, from a destructive phenomenological standpoint, a privileged "awaiting which forgets," a "deliberative" or "calculating" awaiting, which, grounded as it is in certain expectation that the "whole picture" will emerge, tends to coerce a temporal medium into an "in-clusive" object or a closed circle, and thus closes off, becomes "blind" to, the possibility of a more original - a phenomenological - understanding of the text, whether particular work or the tradition - an understanding, that is, in which meaning would be infinitely open.36 To be truer to Being and Time, perhaps, the reification of language, the transformation of words into image, by the mystified logocentric hermeneutics of Modernist criticisms - The New Criticism, the myth criticism of Northrup Frye, the "phenomenological" criticism of consciousness of George Poulet, and the structuralism of Todorov and Barthes - closes off the possibility of hearing the temporality of words, in which the real "being" of a literary text inheres. IV It should thus come as no surprise that in opposition to the derived and enclosed mode of "logical" interpretation, Heidegger calls for an originative and open phenomenological hermeneutics in Being and Time. What he means by this crucial distinction is fully articulated in his etymological analysis of the two components of the word "phenomenology"; the derivation of "phenomenon" from pal veaOat ("to show itself") and its roots, i.e., that which comes to light from hiddenness, and, especially, the derivation of the second component, logos, from X Cye(v, "to talk," "to hold discourse" (Rede). It will suffice for my purposes to draw the obvious conclusions from Heidegger's 443</page><page sequence="24">destruction of the tradition: that the literary hermeneutics suggested by Heidegger's "Existential Analytic" in Being and Time is an anti-metaphysical, phenomenological hermeneutics of dis-closure in which temporality is ontologically prior to Being (or Spatial Form). It thus demands a phenomenological reduction (epoche') of the metaphysical perspective, a "return to the things themselves," not, as in Husserl, in the sense of a recovery of a logocentric origin, an arch6 as source, but of recovering one's original status as being-in-the-world (in-der-Welt-Sein). Here, we recall, the actuality, the primordial Situation, into which the interpreter as Dasein finds himself thrown (Befindlichkeit); the Understanding (Verstehen), that which reveals Dasein's possibilities as Being-in-the-World; and, most important for my purposes, the Saying, the making explicit, of this Understanding (Rede, the logos as legein) - all are equiprimordial and radically temporal: un-grounded or, rather, grounded in Nothing, i.e., open. Here also - and because of his temporality - Dasein, as the hyphenated "being-in-the-world" suggests, is characterized, not by disinterestedness, but by Anxiety, which, "in taking away from Dasein the possibility of understanding itself ... in terms of the 'world' and the way things are publicly interpreted," discloses "its ownmost Being-in-the-world which as something that understands, projects itself essentially upon possibilities" (BT, 40, 232; SZ, 187) - discloses its being, that is, as Care, which, of course, is Heidegger's radicalized version of Husserl's definition of intentionality as "consciousness of." This distinction between Husserl's phenomenology and the phenomenology of Being and Time - especially Heidegger's identification of speech (Rede) with existential temporality and its "ground" in Nothingness - needs to be emphasized to counteract Derrida's and especially his followers' too easy but influential "structuralist" equation of "oral" with "oracular" expression, i.e., with presence and the logocentric tradition, and their devaluation of speech (parole) in favor of "writing" (6criture).37 In thus grounding itself on the ungrounded logos as legein ("to talk") in the sentence "Man is the Being who has logos," a phenomenological hermeneutics retrieves a more primordial understanding of the "truth" of a literary text than that afforded by the derived, i.e., spatial, notion of truth as judgment (the adequaetio): truth, that is, as 'a-Xr Oeta (that which gets un-concealed or un-hidden): The "Being-true" of the Xoyoc as 'aXrev ~tv means that in XEyetc as 'a7roga'veOat [Heidegger goes to de- fine "phenomenology" as "'arrocaruveoat tci atvopeva - to let that which shows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself"] the entitles of which one is talking must be taken out of their hiddenness; one must let them be seen as something 444</page><page sequence="25">unhidden ('aXqOe ); that is, they must be discovered. (BT, 7, 56-57; SZ, 33. Heidegger's emphasis.) The Heideggerian phenomenological reduction, that is, de-reifies the interpreter - re-establishes the primordial ontological difference in the sense of recovering his ec-static or ex-istential temporality, his openness to being. In thus abandoning the Will to Power over being, or, to put it positively (i.e., "phenomeno-logically"), in letting being be as it shows itself from itself,38 the interpreter also allows the "object" of interpretation to undergo a liberating or, better, an e-man-cipating metamorphosis: the reified text, the text that the privileged Medusa eye of the metaphysical interpreter "looks at" and petrifies,39 and thus turns into something present-at-hand - a "graspable" icon (or Euclidian map) - now emerges explicitly as verbal text - a text to be heard - from its context in the realm of deposited knowedge. It becomes, that is, an event in my temporal horizon of circumspect care, an event / experience hermeneutically, as event, in the sense, as the crucial privitive prefix of a-letheia makes clear, of dis-covering the temporal being that spatialization covers over or conceals. According to a phenomenological hermeneutics, then, it is not, as it has been "from ancient times," the static, presentational - and coercive - language of assertion that constitutes the " 'locus' of truth" (BT, 33, 196; SZ, 154). It is, rather, the kinetic, explorative - and generous - language of human speech, i.e., not the mystified orality of the Word of mythic man that Derrida restricts speech to, but the always potential "dialogic" process, which, in being temporal, precludes a definitive revelation of any being.40 To put it positively, this process "locates" the truth of being in the interpreter's continuous ecstatic awareness of the ontologically alternating rhythm of concealment and disclosure, appearing and disappearing, truth and error, continuity and change, or, to use de Man's antinomy, blindness and insight. To return to the spatial metaphor, in modelling itself on the logos as legein, in assigning ontological priority to temporality over form in Understanding, a phenomenological hermeneutics becomes a process of discovery in the sense of dis-closing - opening out - the hermeneutic possibilities that the inauthentic spatial impulse of the Western literary consciousness closes off, conceals, and ultimately forgets in coercing the temporality of the text into a circle. It is hardly accidental that, in contrast to the spatializing "awaiting which makes present and forgets," Heidegger's term for Dasein's authentic (i.e., temporal and projective) hermeneutic stance before being is vorlaufende Entschlossenheit, which means simultaneously "anticipatory resoluteness" and, as its etymology suggests, a running forward which "dis-closes" (BT, 60, 343 ff.; SZ, 297 ff.).41 It is, further, in the sense of a resolute opening out that remembers (repeats or retrieves) that phenomenological hermeneutics, unlike spatial interpretation, renders encounter with a literary text "fateful," that is, historically significant - 445</page><page sequence="26">and for "its time," i.e., time-ly (BT, 74, 434-39; SZ, 382-87).42 In thus sloughing off the old, the habitual, metaphysical frame of reference, the phenomenological interpreter loses his privileged status as "objective" observer of a sealed off and familiar or "domesticated" world, a world as formalized icon or, as Heidegger observes, as "useful chart by which we may find our way amid the various possible things and realms of things,"43 to become a Care-ful Dasein "inquiring into the extra-ordinary."44 He becomes, that is, Homo Viator, man on the way. In Charles Olson's equivalent terms (which I use to suggest that the need to retrieve the explorative temporal stance, i.e., to destroy the metaphysical circle of the Western literary tradition, is not restricted to contemporary phenomenological philosophy but is also felt deeply by the contemporary, the post-modern poet), the interpreter becomes a "Figure of Outward," a "Juan de la Cosa," who experiences the world of the literary text - even the reputedly most metaphysical or autotelic - with the "old measure of care."45 To appropriate Hans-Georg Gadamer's vocabulary, as privileged observer beyond history the reader questions the text to achieve mastery over it; as phenomenological interpreter he becomes a participant who risks himself before the text in the sense of generously letting the text as historical utterance and event also ask questions of him.46 It is this implicit imperative of the phenomenological hermeneutics of Being and Time to bracket our metaphysical assumptions and, having thus recovered our historicity, to read the literary text temporally (to hear the logos as legein, as speaking voice) that makes its temporal "structure" explicit. It is this phenomenological imperative, in other words, that brings meaning as being-saying out of concealment into the opening, that discovers, as Heidegger is want to put it, "how it stands with being" in a particular literary text. Further, as I have been trying to suggest, temporal reading of particular texts must constitute the first stage, the beginning, the point de d6part, of that destruction or deconstruction of the Western literary tradition which promises the paradoxically liberating double retrieval (Wiederholen). I mean the dis-covering not only of texts "buried" in and by the hardened tradition (i.e., their "meaning" for us in the present), but also of a stance before the Western literary tradition, especially as it has been formulated by the ontotheological New Critics and Structuralists, that opens up the possibility of a perpetually new - a postModern or an authentically modern - literary history, a history that, in focusing on dis-closure, both validates the inexhaustibility of literary texts (i.e., literary history as mis-reading) and commits literature to the difficult larger task of "overcoming metaphysics" - a history, in other words, that puts literature at the service of being rather than being at the service of literature.47 The recent emergence of a felt need to rethink the past of Western literature in behalf of de-mystifying and overcoming metaphysics 446</page><page sequence="27">- a need, it should be remembered, that has been made explicit by the breakdown of the tradition in the modern period - necessitates emphasizing this all too brief extension of the temporal hermeneutics implicit in Being and Time to include the "text" of literary history as well as particular imaginative texts. The literary application of the Derridian version of Heidegger's destruction, i.e., deconstruction, has indeed yielded provocative and fruitful initial results concerning the question of literary history. However - and here my comments apply equally, if in a different way, to the hermeneutic methodology underlying the later, the post-Being and Time, Heidegger's exegetical dialogues with Holderlin, Trakl, and George - it is subject to significant error - or blindness - in interpretation and even lends itself to willful misreading because it continues to begin the hermeneutic process from the end, i.e., to ground its deconstruction of the tradition on an unexamined tendency to read particular historical texts or oeuvres spatially. Committed to the ontology of absence (or difference) in its critique and revision of the Western literary tradition, the Derridian deconstructors nevertheless tend to begin more or less naively with the hermeneutic methodology of presence, thus inhibiting the possibility of existential encounter with the text's temporality, blinding themselves, that is, to its version of being, of how it stands with be-ing in that text. This is even the case, for example, in Paul de Man's remarkable and influential deconstruction of Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of Rousseau's Essai sur l'origines des langues. It is essentially by means of a reflexive reading, which in tending to perceive Rousseau's text as a mosaic structure tends also to disregard (over-look) its process or "time-structure," that de Man can "prove" with equal authority that Rousseau consciously fictionalized his affirmation of the priority of oral expression over writing (6criture) against Derrida's conclusion that Rousseau's blindness to what he in fact " 'knew,' in a sense," ("that his doctrine disguised his insight into something closely resembling its opposite"48) was the consequence of the pressure of the Western tradition's ontology of presence. Despite his assertion against a structuralist such as Todorov that "prior to any generalization about literature, literary texts have to be read, and the possibility of reading can never be taken for granted,"49 there is little evidence in de Man's interpretation of Rousseau, or in the practice of his other essays, that reading, for him, is originative or explorative, a temporal "inquiry into the extra-ordinary." There is little evidence, in other words, that he is conscious of the ontological implications of the temporal structure articulated in a particular literary text. And it is this blindness to the temporal being of the text, which, despite the brilliance of the argument, renders his account of Rousseau ultimately unconvincing and, in my mind, imposes limits on his extremely valuable Nietzschean project. It is, further - and more important - this spatializing tendency 447</page><page sequence="28">in reading particular texts that seems also to blind de Man to the essentially mystified nature of the imaginative literature of the Western tradition - to the pervasive teleological structure, the logocentricism of literary texts from Sophocles to the "Modern" period - and thus leads him to conclude that literature has never been self-deceived, that it begins with an awareness "that sign and meaning can never coincide,"50 that it "knows and names itself as fiction" (CC, 19), that, in other words, in imaginative literature "the human self has experienced the void within itself and the invented fiction, far from filling the void, asserts itself as a pure nothingness, our nothingness stated and restated by a subject that is the agent of its own instability" (CC, 19), and that, finally, "as knowing and naming itself as fiction," it is "demystified from the start" (CC, 18) and thus not in need of deconstruction. Temporal reading, that is, dis-covers phenomenologically that, like the philosophical and historiological texts in the ontotheological tradition, the literary text in the history of Western literature has, by and large - and increasingly until quite recently - been intent on holding a mirror up to one form of logocentric metaphysical universe or another. And it has done this not as de Man insists, to create "fiction" that, aware of the "presence of nothingness," "names this void with ever-renewed understanding" (CC, 18), but, like myth, to mediate, i.e., to spatialize immediate temporal experience for the purpose of securing its readers' always flagging faith in the logocentric order of that experience. To put it another way, temporal reading discovers that Western literature has by and large existed to fulfill, to certify and strengthen, the teleological expectations (the logocentric hermeneutics) of the readers, not to demystify them. This, in fact, is the essential testimony of postmodern literature at large - of the fiction of Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Barth, Pynchon; of the drama of lonesco and Pinter; and of the poetry of Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson - a literature that, in playing havoc with both the sense of an ending (i.e., linear narrative) and of symbolic form (circular narrative), exists primarily to deconstruct and demystify the logocentric or, as I prefer to put it, spatialized literary texts of the tradition, especially its Modernist allotrope, and thus to deconstruct, to phenomenologically reduce by violence, the traditional privileged logocentric or spatial frame of reference of the modern reader.51 This strategy of the postmodern writer, as I have all too briefly described it, is remarkably similar to de Man's Nietzschian account of Western literature at large. But in committing itself to deconstructing the "fiction" of the tradition, this emergent body of literature throws de Man's project into serious question. This failure to give the temporality of the literary text its due lies, perhaps, in the fact that de Man's (and his followers') domain is almost exclusively the critical essay rather than imaginative literature (it is revealing that his exemplary "fiction" is Rousseau's "philosophical" essay 448</page><page sequence="29">Essai sur I'origine des langues), where the temporality is more thematic than formal. Be that as it may, this blindness, I submit, inhibits - as it does in different ways in the later Heidegger and even in Gadamer - the understanding and articulation of deconstruction's full potential for literary history. Only temporal reading can disclose "how it stands with being" in a literary text, and only the disclosure of how it stands with being in a particular text can disclose how it stands with being in the literary tradition. Paradoxically, it was J. Hillis Miller, a recent convert to the de Manian project, who concludes, in a paper commenting on the Yale Colloquium on Criticism in 1966, that: The tradition in modern thought and art which rebels against dualism would also claim that spatial thinking is an abstraction from the concrete richness of experience. Human existence is fundamentally temporal, and even our experience of space is falsified if it is described in terms of geometrical abstraction. Among those forms which are falsified by spatialization, such thinkers would say, is literature. Literature is a temporal, not a spatial art, and should be described as such, in vocabulary proper to its temporality.52 And who, on the basis of de Man's invocation of Heidegger's Being and Time, looks forward to a new hermeneutics "on the basis of the swing to monism and temporality in twentieth-century thought."53 Having established the ontological priority of temporality in human understanding, the "next stage" is to account for the repeatability of reading or, to put it in another way, for the Whole, the Being or Form of a literary text. Space precludes developing this relationship - it is, of course, the hermeneutic circle54 - in full. But lest the reader conclude that I have not accounted for the concept of "the whole," it may be pointed out that it has always been present in the argument, though held in abeyance, and needs only to be made explicit. As Heidegger says at the outset and repeatedly, in opposition to Husserl's commitment to a "presuppositionless philosophy," all inquiry, "as a kind of seeking, must be grounded beforehand by what is sought. So the meaning of Being must already be available to us in some way [this is what Heidegger calls "the forestructure" of Dasein's understanding] " (BT, 2, 25; SZ, 57). The effort to avoid circularity, therefore, is not only a futile gesture; it also does violence to the truth. "What is decisive," he reiterates, "is not to get out of the circle but to come into it in the right way" (BT, 32, 195; SZ, 153). 449</page><page sequence="30">And the right way, as we have seen, is through the existential/ontological Dasein: The circle of understanding is not an orbit in which any random kind of knowledge may move; it is the expression of the existential fore-structure of Dasein itself. It is not to be reduced to the level of a vicious circle, or even of a circle which is merely tolerated. In the circle is hidden a positive possibility of the most primordial kind of knowing. (BT, 32, 195; SZ, 153) What I have hinted at throughout in referring to the New Critical and Structuralist tendency to perceive the temporal text as "autotelic," "bounded," "sealed off," "inclusive," that is, as a circular space, is that this kind of privileged spatial understanding and hermeneutics begins with a commitment to the ontolical priority of Form (icon, image, model, myth, etc.) over the temporal process of reading the text and, in so doing, is subject to vicious circularity: it "finds" or, rather, it confirms, what it already has - or wants - as a whole beforehand. I have also tried to suggest, on the other hand, that in giving ontological priority to temporality (a temporality grounded in nothing, we recall) - or, to put the same thing in another way, in grounding understanding in the existential intentionality, the Care of Dasein as being-in-the-world - the circularity of the new hermeneutics becomes, paradoxically, dis-covery or dis-closure. It opens up the infinite possibilities of the meaning of be-ing that reside in the reader/text (time/form) relationship, those possibilities which are closed off, covered over and forgotten, by the spatial/metaphysical imagination. In the terms Heidegger borrowed from Kierkegaard, entering the hermeneutic circle in the right way generates "repetition" (Wiederholen), which - unlike Platonic or aesthetic recollection, which "repeats backwards" - is a "recollection forward."55 In distinguishing between the Cartesian/Hegelian methodology of systematic doubt and existential doubt (and extending this distinction to include that between disinterestedness and interest and between recollection and repetition), Kierkegaard's seminal work, Repetition (unpublished in his lifetime), remarkably prefigures Husserl's and especially Heidegger's interpretation of the phenomenological reduction: the principle of intentionality (Care) and the hermeneutic circle.56 Hermeneutics as repetition, in other words, "is the interest [read Care] of metaphysics and at the same time the interest upon which metaphysics founders"57 - and, I would add, is overcome.

This translation was originally published asa part of Volume II of Nietzsche (Pfullingen: Verlag Gunther Neske, 1961). 2 I use the conventional capitalization only when I refer to the word "Being" as a substantive, i.e., as it is understood by the Western ontotheological tradition. 3 See Joseph Frank, "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," Sewanee Review, 53 (Spring, Summer, and Autumn 1945), 221-40, 433-45, 643-65; reprinted in The Widening Gyre: Crisis and Mastery in Modern Literature (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1963), pp. 3-62. It is of considerable importance for the task of deconstructing the Western literary tradition to observe that Frank and those who follow him in his use of the term "spatial form" as a definition of the modernity of the Symbolist-Imagist imagination do so without reference either to Henri Bergson's use of the same term in Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness, tr. F. L. Pogson (New York and London: Macmillan, 1910), to define and criticize the reality perceived by the positivistic consciousness, nor to T. E. Hulme's summarization of Bergson's analysis and critique in "The Philosophy of Intensive Manifolds," Speculations: Essays on Humanism and the Philosophy of Art, ed. Herbert Read (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1924), pp. 123-214. Proponents of "spatial form" thus inadvertently point to the ultimately logocentric ground of both the objective and subjective, positivistic and idealistic, realistic and symbolist, standpoints and thereby undercut the allegedly radical modernity of Modernism. They thus also corroborate Heidegger's account of the continuity of the binary ontotheological tradition. 4 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, tr. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (New York: Harper and Row, 1962), Section 44, p. 265. Further reference to Being and Time will be incorporated in the text in parentheses and will include the abbreviation BT, the section number, and the page number. I will also include abbreviated references to the original German version, Sein und Zeit, 7th ed. (Ti'bingen: Neomarius Verlag, 1953), as, for example, in this citation: (BT, 44, 254; SZ, 222). 5 Samuel Beckett, Watt, (New York: Grove Press, 1959). On his arrival, "in his midst at last, after so many tedious years spent clinging to the perimeter" (p. 41), Watt experiences "irrefragable" "premonitions .. . of imminent harmony" (p. 40), premonitions "that all is well, or at least for the best" (p. 41). He conceives of Knott's "establishment" as the timeless and abiding center of a Leibnitzian universe and Knott as its logos, its unmoved mover, its word. Then "something slips" (p. 42) and everything suddenly changes. A rupture in the referential surface of the circle occurs, so to speak, and Watt finds himself in a terra incognita "grounded" in a mysterious and elusive absence. His ec-centric predicament is symbolized by the picture hanging in Erskine's room: A circle, obviously described by a compass, and broken at the lowest point, occupied the middle foreground, of this picture. Was it receding? Watt had that impression. In the eastern back- ground appeared a point, or dot .... Watt wondered how long it would be before the point and circle entered together upon the same plane.... Watt wondered if they had sighted each other, or 451</page><page sequence="32">were blindly flying thus, harried by some force of merely me- chanical mutual attraction, or the playthings of chance. . . . And he wondered what the artist had intended to represent . . a circle and its centre in search of each other, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of its centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of its centre and its circle respectively... .

Macomber's The Anatomy of Disillusion: Martin Heidegger's Notion of Truth (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1967), for an excellent study of the subject. 7 Macquarrie and Robinson translate Angst as "anxiety."

Walter Lowrie (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1957), p. 38. The parallel with Heidegger is virtually absolute, except, of course, that Kierkegaard puts the argument in theological rather than ontological terms: In this state ["innocence"; Heidegger's term is "everyday-being," though in "Letter on Humanism," Philosophy in The Twentieth Century, ed. William Barrett and Henry D. Aiken (New York: Random House, 1962), III, 38, he speaks of man in this state as homo animalis], there is peace and repose [Heidegger's terms are "tranquility and familiarity"]; but at the same time there is something different which is not dissension and strife, for there is nothing to strive with. What is it then? Nothing. But what effect does nothing produce? It begets dread. This is the profound secret of innocence, that at the same time it is dread. In a footnote to his discussion of Section 40, "The basic state-of-mind of anxiety as a distinctive way in which Dasein is disclosed," Heidegger writes, "The man who has gone farthest in analysing the phenomenon of anxiety ... is Sdren Kierkegaard.

The relationship between Heidegger's critique of the humanist will to power and early Modernist literature has been made by Nathan A. Scott in Negative Capability: Studies in the New Literature and the Religious Situation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1969). See especially "The Literary Imagination in a Time of Death," pp. 59-88. 15 Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1952), p. 36. Though Tillich's analysis is existential-theological rather than existential-ontological, his way of putting the Dasein's impulse to transform dread into fear is illuminating - if "God" is read as "being": This human mind is not only, as Calvin said, a permanent factory of idols [read "images"], it is also a permanent factory of fears - the first in order to escape God, the second in order to escape anxiety: and there is a relationship between the two. For facing the God who is really God means facing also the absolute threat of nonbeing. The "naked absolute" (to use a phrase of Luther's) produces "naked anxiety"; for it is the extinction of every finite self-affirmation [read "anthropomorphic metaphysics"], and not a possible object of fear and courage .... (p. 39) In taking my lead here from Tillich, I am aware of extending Heidegger's analysis of dread and fear beyond his limits. Nevertheless, I think my interpretation of this relationship is consistent with the essential thrust of his thought in Being and Time. See, for example, BT, 40, 234; SZ 189: "Fear is anxiety, fallen into the 'world, inauthentic, and, as such, hidden from itself." 16 Because Heidegger puts the antitheses of these three phases - Gerede (Idle Talk), Zweideutigkeit (Ambiguity), and Neugier (Curiosity) - in terms of inauthentic everyday-being-in-the-world, his analysis of these in Being and Time does not lend itself immediately to the discussion of literary hermeneutics. In order to clarify the applicability of this triadic opposition to this field of inquiry, the antithesis to the authentic phases should be seen in terms of the systematized or "metaphysical" version of everyday-being-in-the world: Objective Distance, Calculation, Assertion. For Heidegger's account of Ambiguity, Curiosity, and Idle Talk, see BT, 35-38, 211-24; SZ, 167-80. 17 Wallace Stevens, "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," The Collected Poems (New York: Knopf, 1954), p. 473. 18 See also BT, 69, 408-25; SZ, 356-64. In his An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Ralph Manheim (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor, 1961), Heidegger puts the spatializing imperative of derived knowledge in terms of the historical transformation of physis (the "emerging power" or be-ing) into eidos (Idea, i.e., "appearance or what is seen"): From the standpoint of space, the difference between appearing [as physis] and appearing [as eidos] is this: appearing in the first and authentic sense as bringing-itself-to-stand in togetherness 453</page><page sequence="34">involves space, which it first conquers; as it stands there, it creates space for itself; it produces space and everything pertaining to it; it is not copied. Appearing in the second sense emerges from an already finished space; it is situated in the rigid measures of this space, and we see it by looking toward it. The vision makes the thing. Now this vision becomes decisive, instead of the thing itself. Appearing in the first sense opens up space. Appearing in the second sense merely circumscribes and measures the space that has already been opened. (p. 153) See also Macomber's The Anatomy of Disillusion: Martin Heidegger's Notion of Truth, p. 85. For a suggestive application of the phenomenologically derived map metaphor to post-Renaissance literary form and culture, I refer the reader to John Vernon, The Garden and the Map: Schizophrenia in Twentieth Century Literature and Culture (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1973). Using Husserl and, above all, Erwin Straus (Phenomenological Psychology: Selected Papers [New York: Basic Books, 1966]) rather than Heidegger as the source of his phenomenological analysis of the modern mind, Vernon inevitably restricts his critique to the "map consciousness" of the literature grounded in science or positivism. He fails to perceive that the idealist/symbolist "garden consciousness" he prefers, in beginning prior to the "fall," i.e., from a privileged origin, is also a spatial imagination and thus, like the map consciousness, inside the "metaphysical" tradition. 19 An Introduction to Metaphysics, p. 161. 20 "What is Metaphysics?" Existence and Being, p. 344. See also Langan's The Meaning of Heidegger, pp. 11 and 72. I use the word "grounded" ironically to contrast the traditional metaphysicians' pursuit of heights with Heidegger's phenomenological insistence on returning to the things themselves - to origins and depths - implied, for example, in the parodoxical title "The Way Back into the Ground of Metaphysics." 21 Theodore Kisiel, "Translator's Introduction" to Werner Marx, Heidegger and the Tradition (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1971), p. xxiv. 22 An Introduction to Metaphysics, p. 161. My emphasis, except for the earlier Greek and Latin words. 23 As W. B. Macomber observes in The Anatomy of Disillusion, "Heidegger rejects all conceptions of knowledge which are formed on the basis of an analogy with vision. In vision more than any other sense man dissociates himself from his world, and when knowledge [i.e., the knowledge of logos as reason or judgment] comes to be regarded as absolute or underived, its nature is invariably expressed in visual terms: Plato's eidos and idea, Descartes' 'clear and distinct idea,' Hume's 'representations,' Kant's Anschauung and Vorstellungen, Husserl's Wessenschau" (pp. 60-61). See also pp. 128, 143, 144, 35-36, 149 ff.

The relationship between the Platonic concept of circular time and Greek tragedy is brilliantly developed in Tom F.

It is an open question, however, as to whether or not Heidegger assumes this hermeneutic stance in his "exegeses" of the texts of Holderlin and Trakl. 39 I am, of course, borrowing the metaphor of the petrifying gaze from Jean-Paul Sartre.
