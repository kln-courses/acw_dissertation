ABSTRACT The phenomenon of colonialism must be understood from visual sources as well as written discourse. Examination of iconographic and cartographic evidence of late-eighteenth-century Amazonia reveals that the Portuguese often adopted/adapted indigenous knowledge into the construction of material culture, even while overtly speaking to a "project" of Europeanizing the local population. This example strongly suggests that reductionist global paradigms of imperial control may be strongly contradicted when the colonial process is analyzed in context. Keywords: visual record, "local knowledge," cul tural landscape, contextual analysis, pragmatism. INTRODUCTION The Portuguese not only colonized Brazil in the broadest political and economic sense but, in the eighteenth century, they attempted to shape and mold a new Brazilian cultural landscape1 in the Portuguese image. This necessarily involved changing the material culture of the region as well as the physical environment. Late-colonial administrators in Brazil understood that material culture served as a tangible metaphor for the colony's advancement; in the 1700s, the equation was widely presupposed that the more "modern" (read "European") the artifacts, lifestyles, and physical surroundings of Brazil's inhabitants were, the more "progressive" the colony had become.2 This mindset determined the shape of eighteenth century colonialism in the Amazon region. Yet, at the same time, as this discussion will show, colonially-generated solutions to material culture construction were not disparaged, even if this meant adopting or adapting local (i.e., indigenous) techniques. Using "local knowledge" did not immediately imply deviation from the official "project" of the metropolitan country; while solutions which incorporated local expertise might be considered compromises, they often represented the most expedient (and creative) use of local talent, as well as materials. Local knowledge, after all, implies that it has been "acquired in concrete practice,"3 and the history of the Amazon region in this time frame provides ample evidence of Portuguese willingness to incorporate styles, techniques and materials native to the region. Up to now, however, the notion that there might be some "give and take" between official Portuguese insistence on Europeanization, and the (presumed) inclination of the local population to retain its own way of doing things (as well as the contextually inherent advantage of local knowledge), have not shaped the debate on Brazilian history. Instead, the tendency has been to view cultural policy in the Brazilian colonial setting as a one-way flow of ideas and orders, a monolithic, "top-down," praxial phenomenon in Yearbook, Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers, 2000, Vol. 26, pp. 117-130. ? Copyright 2000, Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers._</page><page sequence="2">118 CONFERENCE OF LATIN AMERICANIST GEOGRAPHERS which "discourse," representing the unilateral, official position of the imperial power, assumes an almost reified presence. In this respect, Brazilian historiography is not unique but is firmly rooted in currently popular historical paradigms of how colonial "agency" operated globally.4 In the corollary paradigm5, researchers have assumed that resistance, either armed or passive, was the only method via which local peoples could counter monolithic colonialism; this assumption, however, does little more than confirm the very existence of hegemonic domination by ontological (if not explicit) implication and, again, is a position well represented in Brazilian colonial historiography6. By contrast, this paper addresses the discrepancy between a postulated direction of culture flow on the one hand, and the reality in which it was created and evolved on the other, by focusing on the specific context, or cultural landscape, of the late-colonial Amazon. I have focused on this region specifically because it was there, in the late-eighteenth century, that the Portuguese expended enormous energies in attempting to reconfigure the landscape according to metropolitan-generated precepts. Using "non traditional" sources (i.e., iconographic and carto graphic), instead of relying on written discourse to elucidate the cultural landscape, has resulted in an intermediate interpretation of the history of Amazonian colonialism, one which emphasizes the processes of cultural borrowing and selective assimilation, rather than reducing options to the twin heuristic categories of metropolitan/colonial dominance and subaltern resistance. Although this third interpretive paradigm has not charac terized historiography of colonialism in general (including that of Brazil), it is well represented in the anthropological literature on syncretism and in cultural geography studies which consider the pro cess of "transculturation" in the "contact zone."7 In this regard, historians can profit from the valuable insights of their sister disciplines; an examination of late-eighteenth century visual sources has made it clear that only the concept of "transculturation" can adequately explain how the cultural landscape of the late-colonial Amazon evolved. Such visual sources demonstrate processes of selective assimilation on the part of the colonized, as well as cultural borrowing on the part of the colonizers, ultimately resulting in the creation of unique, syncretized material cultures distinct from imperial as well as indigenous forebears. While perhaps born out of expediency, these hybridized syntheses contained their own inherent cultural logic: i.e., to the extent that both colonizer and colonized contributed to the crea tion of such "compromises" in the cultural land scape, they were rendered more acceptable, offering the prospect of wider application. CONTEXT To develop this theme of cultural borrowing in the historical context of the late colonial Amazon, I use the broad definition of "material culture," suggested some years ago by James Deetz, as encompassing not only "artifacts" in the traditional sense but "that sector of our physical environment that we modify through culturally determined behavior."8 Such "material culture" should not be viewed as a static inventory of artifacts but rather descriptive of an ongoing process. Thus, "the study of material culture is the study of creativity in context... [an analysis] of the dialectic of wills and conditions,...the reciprocal connections among individual desires, social orders, and environmental possibilities."9 It is this acculturative process, with its recombinant cultural mixtures of local and imported traditions and techniques and, perhaps, differential rates of acceptance, which should be viewed in the context of the contact zone. The remainder of this paper will, therefore, consider several instances of cultural fusion in the Amazon region which illustrate that "European" models of cultural construction were shaped by indigenous knowledge, resulting in highly original, adaptable solutions. The use of these maps and drawings as "data" allows for a measure of independence in interpreting historical evidence distinct from discourse; nonetheless, such objects "speak" to us as surely as a written record. And while it is true, as visual anthropologists remind us, that</page><page sequence="3">DELSON 119 renderings of these objects were "to some extent socially and/or culturally constructed,"10 and must therefore be understood as representing the viewpoint of the Europeans or Brazilians of Euro pean background who drew them, they remain the few images that we have of material production within colonial contact zones. Most of the drawings presented here are reproduced from the well-known account of the Brazilian-born naturalist, Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira, whose Viagem Filosofica is the outstanding iconographic source on the Amazon for this period.11 The town and house plans represent the work of military engineers. There is, unfortunately, little known evidence of indigenous renderings of these contexts. My concern here, therefore, is to move beyond the largely politically-driven discourse in determining whether the parameters of an emerging colonial material culture are necessarily predetermined by a normative ideology (in this case Portuguese), or are responsive to the inherent logic of cultural borrowing, grounded in the prospect of acceptance. It is in this regard that the modified "artifacts" and "spaces" of this late colonial period may be read as something other than just "things"; they may be seen instead as the phenomenological evidence of Portuguese influence and control or, alternatively, of willingness to incorporate local knowledge into newly created landscapes. We can be certain, given the paucity of written data on the subject, that attempts to measure the indigenous reaction to such cultural reconfigurations would not be very productive and would implausibly suggest that it is not only possible to reconstruct subaltern history in the Amazon, but that there was broad understanding of the colonial "project" by the colonized in the first place. If, however, instead of relying exclusively on written discourse (or drawing conclusions based on the lack of such writings), we substitute visual evidence of the adoption or adaptation of local knowledge into the Amazonian cultural landscape, it becomes obvious that a process of cultural borrowing was, in fact, the modus operandi in the region. Ultimately, such sources force us to rethink the phenomenon of colonialism and to tell a "different story." CULTURAL LANDSCAPES The origin of the thrust to modify the Amazonian cultural landscape can be traced to the 1690s' discovery of gold in the region of Minas Gerais, a windfall which necessitated a new, and explicit, Crown policy for controlling the development of the backlands. In response, the Portuguese projected sweeping plans for the eighteenth century which aimed to replace the uncontrolled or spontaneous landscapes of the previous two centuries with one that was visibly regulated and European in appearance.12 Beginning first in the backlands and extending later to the older, coastal cities, the Portuguese consciously attempted to change theproxemics or spatial arrangements of the way people lived within the colony, by mandating the construction of new communities.13 At first concerned just with the maintenance of a uniform physical presence in these newly constructed hamlets, the government would eventually mandate rules for "appropriate" lifestyles which, it was thought, the inhabitants of these new communities must eventually embrace. Indeed, while inhabitants of such backlands communities (including those of the Amazon) were derided as vagabonds, the Portuguese assumed that by decreeing that such folk live within structured, aligned com-munities, their collective behavior would ultimately manifest a more civil character. While some urban planning had been evident in Brazil from the founding of Salvador da Bahia, in 1549, the first real evidence of a planning mindset appeared in 1716, when legislation was drafted for the creation of townships in the northern region of Piaui.14 This new construction "code" mandated the creation of designated sites for a church, jail, and other public buildings; lots were to be distributed to future inhabitants on streets which had been delineated by surveying {a linha recta). Lastly, every effort was to be made to assure uniform fa?ades for the houses, so that the entire project would be, in the</page><page sequence="4">120 CONFERENCE OF LATIN AMERICANIST GEOGRAPHERS famous Italian phrase of the day, un bel composto (a beautiful composition). As the century unfolded, such regulations became even more explicit in regard to house style, color, and content, and they were often accompanied by precisely rendered towns plans. Significantly, the plans drafted for such new communities were to be implemented in context regardless of the ethnic background of the future inhabitants. Thus, residents of European and mixed background, newly arrived cagais (families from the Atlantic Islands and other overcrowded parts of the realm), African-born and local slaves, as well as indigenous peoples were now required to live in regulated settlements in the Amazon, often side by side. Elsewhere, I have referred to this scheme as the first step toward creating a Brazilian peasantry.15 Creating such planned minifundia, instead of permitting the mostly uncontrolled pattern of large landed estates which had characterized earlier settlement on the coast, was seen as a method of assuring greater Crown authority.16 This town-building program reached a feverish pitch after 1750 when the Marques de Pombal, as the Prime Minister, persuaded King Jose I of the need for broad-reaching reform in all areas of the colony. While Pombal's projections for Brazil are well-researched and need not be redeveloped here, it is critical to this discussion that one of his primary concerns was the expulsion of the Jesuits, a feat accomplished in the late 1750s. For the Indians now "liberated" from missionary control, Pombal formulated policy which sought to integrate them into the mainstream Brazilian/Portuguese milieu. The success of this experimental vision (known as the Directorate) hinged on modifying the material culture; i.e., "allowing" the Indians to live in a recognizably "Portuguese manner" and to marry Europeans, which Pombal reckoned would result in "Lusified" behavior.17 Indeed, one enthusiastic administrator predicted that Indians would rapidly flock to these newly created Portuguese settle ments, where they would be treated as "men like anyone else" and where they would be allowed the liberty of owning goods, unlike the Jesuits who would not let them "possess a single thing."18 To implement this clearly defined cultural agenda, the Portuguese created a cadre of specially trained individuals. I am referring here to the military engineers who not only came from the realm but who were also educated locally in Brazil.19 The graduates of these academies formed a corps of loyal technocrats who had the training and the intelligence to implement a mandated cultural policy, supported by modern technology. Yet, as will be seen below, such individuals were not averse to modifying metropolitan prerequisites and incorporating local knowledge when warranted by a specific context. Many of these engineers saw duty in the Amazon region. Unlike the previous century, when the Portuguese had confined their Ama zonian activity to Belem do Para and sent sporadic expeditions up the river system, in the eighteenth century metropolitan officials attempted to populate and control the entire region, efforts that were often under the direct control of military engineers. Through the course of the century, the contact zone between the indigenous population and Europeans widened, as the Portuguese pushed further inland to Mato Grosso and developed a trade route which linked the Guapore, Madeira and Amazon Rivers to the port city of Belem.20 In this newly opened region, the Portuguese preferred to locate and construct new towns on the vdrzea, or floodplain of the rivers; often these settlements were associated with a nearby fortification. Nor was this necessarily a deviation from the setting of Pre-Portuguese indigenous settlements; recent archaeological evidence suggests that early occupation occurred on the vdrzea as well as on terra firme (high ground or forest), with occasional settlements spreading over both geomorphic land forms.21 By contrast, it was during the missionary era that this pattern was substantially modified, as the religious orders preferred to located their missions on the bluffs overlooking rivers,22 rather than on the floodplain. Portuguese town-building activity in the region (which intensified after the 1759 expulsion of the Jesuits allowed the Portuguese greater</page><page sequence="5">DELSON 121 direct contact with indigenous peoples) visibly reversed the tendency of the missionary period and physically relocated the local and recently arrived settlers into newly constructed communities at water's edge. These new com munities were provided with casas de canoas to stow craft, rudimentary docking areas, and occasionally shipyards. Even former missions, which were now taken over by civil authorities, experienced substantial modification. Nonetheless, it is difficult to speak of the emergence of just one new cultural landscape; such riverine communities differed widely from one another, a fact which reflected accommod ation to local knowledge and conditions. Swampy areas necessitated the building of houses on stilts, while lack of what was considered "appropriate" construction materials resulted in houses built of thatched palm leaves (Figure 1) instead of the preferred taipa (mud bricks) or stone. Thus, notwithstanding the prevalence of uniformity internally in these towns, no one pattern of town layout nor house prototype can be said to represent a global model; each was devised in context. Even within single sites experimentation took place, so that the development of the cultural landscape must be viewed as an ongoing process, while lip-service was being paid to prefabricated "Lusification" directives from the mother country. Analysis of the construction of the town of Sao Jose de Macapa de Amapa (on the northern banks of the mouth of the Amazon River) provides an excellent example of how the process worked at one site. Sao Jose de Macapa Construction of a fortress and settlement at Sao Jose de Macapa was ordered in response to threats of foreign invasion; the Portuguese Crown hoped to protect the entrance to the Amazon river and its tributaries by creating human "bulwarks" (i.e., townships) composed of a mixed peasantry of Atlantic Islands cagais, their slaves, and "congregated" indigenous peoples. Toward this end, Thomaz Rodrigues da Costa, a Portuguese engineering graduate of the Royal Academy at Lisbon, was dispatched in the late 1750s to Figure 1. A small house constructed of palm leaves but with clearly European lines. This was probably located in a Miranha Indian village.

Each nuclear family was assigned a house, the floor plans of which are depicted on a contemporaneous plan of the settlement. Significantly, two house styles are represented, allowing us to interpret how the process of cultural modification evolved on site. The second house type (referred to as the "new house" in the plan's legend) seems to have prevailed, becoming the predominant house form (Figure 3). This was probably due to the fact that the plan of this bungalow provided for greater cross-ventilation, in this extremely hot climate, than is evident in the floor plan of the first house type (Figure 4). The interior space of the predominant house type was divided into three small rooms, with a narrow entrance corridor/foyer; each unit had three simple windows and a pair of doors aligned opposite each other to maximize ventilation. Significantly, the purpose of these rooms is not delineated on the</page><page sequence="6">122 CONFERENCE OF LATIN AMERICANIST GEOGRAPHERS Figure 2. Plan of the new town of Sao Jose de Macapa.

The device of adjoining walls with the next residential unit, as seen in a rendering at the bottom of the town plan, was common and employed elsewhere in Brazil; it not only lowered construction costs by eliminating one structural wall, but simultaneously provided the desired uniform (and Europeanized) fa9ade. We can observe, additionally, that the high pitch of the illustrated roof line, as well as the lack of indication of an attic floor, suggests that partitions (probably woven), rather than solid walls, divided the interior space. This was a building style common to indigenous dwellings. Iconographic evidence from Rodrigues Ferreira's A Viagem Filosofica confirms the use of partitions in dwellings inhabited by Indians in the "Euro peanized" town of Monte Alegre, as well as in contemporaneous indigenous malocas (round houses; see Figures 5 and 6). It is probable that the Portuguese selectively incorporated this climate-adaptive vernacular device after trial and error. This begs the question of the cultural origin of these new town housing prototypes. Can we consider this second house type to be purely European in derivation? If written discourse is accepted at face value, we would expect to find evidence of direct continuity of building styles from Portugal to the colony. Indeed, vernacular houses from rural Portugal today show similarity in plan and scale to the colonial Amapa exemplars. If we speculate that there is also a continuity of form of eighteenth-century rural Portuguese vernacular houses with those of the present then, by extending that continuity to Brazil, we can suggest that what appears to be replication of European forms in colonial Amapa was probably not coincidental. Superficially, we might be tempted to conclude that in Amapa cultural borrowing in toto from Portugal was the order of the day. But closer examination of the visual evidence suggests otherwise. For example, the divisions between rooms depicted in modern-day Figure 5. Interior of house in the Amazonian new town of Monte Alegre. Note the non structural partitions and the open space under the high-pitched roof. Source: From VF, plate 28.11 Figure 6. Partitions seen in floor plan of maloca, Amazonian indigenous round house. Source: From VF, plate 127.11</page><page sequence="8">124 CONFERENCE OF LATIN AMERICANIST GEOGRAPHERS house plans of Alentejo and Ribatejo do not show woven partitions, but thick, structural walls.25 Moreover, the rural Portuguese analogs lack the apertures necessary for cross-ventilation and, in this regard, resemble the unsuccessful first house type of Sao Jose, rather than the more pre dominant (and airier) second house type of da Costa's town. Moreover, the roof area of the rural Portuguese houses is invariably floored, functioning as a usable storage area, or attic, rather than remaining open for ventilation as in the Amazonian colonial examples. Colonial Amapa houses, therefore, repre sent only a partial adaptation or acceptance of the Portuguese house form. In other words, this was a selective application of European norms. Analytically then, this example from Sao Jose may be read as follows: the Portuguese engineer (da Costa) developed a prototype Amazonian bungalow that, initially based on a normative metropolitan vernacular cultural form, proved to be unsuccessful (uninhabitable?). He then modi fied the basic form, incorporating local climatic knowledge in a process of cultural borrowing, (likely following the suggestions of the indigen ous workers who formed the construction crews26) to produce a house type more suitable for this zone. From the outside these houses would meet administrative demands requiring locals to live in orderly (read "European-like") residences. But inside the houses there was room for local adaptations, such as partitions, cross-ventilation and open space under the roof. Was this a "superficial" take of the European culture, or a highly pragmatic synthesis born of experimentation and adaptability? I believe that the visual evidence suggests the latter interpretation, which is why the second house form prevailed. Parenthetically, one wonders what indigenous inhabitants made of the spatial arrangement of these new houses to which they were now assigned. We have no evidence of their reaction and there is nothing to contradict the notion that they may have assigned their own culturally-derived interpretations to the new communities and dwellings.27 Figure 7. Loom showing beginnings of hammock with geometric design. Source: From VF, plate 53.11 Textiles Paralleling the case of the houses discussed above, analysis of the Amazonian textile industry28 shows that the introduction of European technology (e.g., in the loom pictured in Figure 7) did not automatically signal the creation of a totally Europeanized product. Perhaps the Portuguese recognized that adaptation of European dress (or any clothing for that matter) would be easier if the fabric itself reflected local tradition; this makes sense a priori especially if the goal was basically to avoid nudity. The clothing worn by indigenous peoples, as depicted in the Viagem Filosofica, shows design patterns which were very much part of the local cultural tradition (Figures 8 and 9). While the cut is basically European, it is unlike clothing worn contemporaneously in Portugal or the Atlantic islands.29 But by allowing for such departures from European models, the Portuguese were rewarded with a clothed population as well as in an increase in consumerism30 (presumably the rationale for adopting more modern weaving technology). The same kinds of cultural fusions may be discerned in the ceramics produced in the Amazon, where local designs appear to have been grafted onto European (Arabic?) vessel forms.

S. do Pilar, an igarite or canoe body modified by Portuguese ship building techniques. Source: From VF, plate 34.11 survives to illustrate this syncretism, but it does so quite nicely (Figure 10). What is important is that, in the absence of written documentation, we can decipher these examples of cultural syncretism via the visual record. Transport In yet another facet of material culture in the Amazon, marine transportation, similar melding of local knowledge with European form occurred and suggests symmetries of purpose. Although master Portuguese shipbuilders were sent to the Amazon (and elsewhere in Brazil) in the mid-1700s expressly for the purpose of bringing their skills to the shipbuilding industry,31 and engineers often saw duty as naval designers, the bulk of the labor force in the Amazonian shipyards continued to be indigenous. These workers were undoubtedly more familiar with the construction of canoes, upon which riverine communities did (and still do) depend for their supplies. Thus, while Amazonian shipyards successfully produced brigs, brigantines, smacks, and other vessels of clearly European derivation, it was the everyday transport vessel, based on the simple, yet efficacious dugout form, that dominated construction. These canoes were transformed into sleek transportation vessels with the addition of rigging (both lateen and square sails), partial keels, stern rudders and "tumble homes," resulting in highly sophisticated fusion craft like the igarite (Figure 11), which was used for inland commerce; notwithstanding its exterior sophistication it remained a one-piece-hull canoe, albeit a "Europeanized" one, and it traversed the entire Amazonian riverine landscape. We can understand why the Portuguese would modify an indigenous cultural form of transport rather than insisting upon more European models if we reflect on the prevalence of cultural borrowing we have already seen in the Amazonian contact zone. Here again, it was the advantage of local knowledge that determined the shape of the cultural form; for the task of navigating the often treacherous waters of the Amazon river and its tributaries, the canoe was the ideal vessel in terms of stability and draft, as well as cargo transport.32 Moreover, the fact that for</page><page sequence="11">DELSON 127 riverine traffic the Portuguese were largely dependent on native mariners, to whom the canoe was comfortably familiar, undoubtedly played a determining role in the decision to adapt this quintessential local vessel, rather than insisting upon a more European form. CONCLUSION These modified canoes, as well as the house forms, textiles, and ceramics, demonstrate that the fusion of European material culture with local knowledge was not an aberrancy. While written discourse confirms that the Portuguese believed that cultural/structural reforms could reconfigure the cultural landscape, and perhaps really believed that their colonial subjects who adopted European culture would be better off, the visual data presented here suggest that this is too simplistic an interpretation for what is a complex process. Implementation of imperial policy obviously did not automatically mean eschewing local ways of creating material culture, as we have seen. The apparent enthusiasm which the Portu guese demonstrated toward experimentation, acculturation and even outright adaptation of local forms in Brazil might, in fact, be said to imply just the opposite; i.e., notwithstanding the pre requisites and die-cut solutions associated with the official "colonial project," it was possible for a colonial power to improvise and tailor material culture to meet the imperatives (physical and, perhaps, metaphysical) of the contact zone. Nor, apparently, was this process unique to the Amazon, nor to Portuguese possessions in America. Writing about material culture in Portu guese Goa, Urs Bitterli describes such objects as blankets, carpets, weavings and embroideries which "combine motif and ornament, form and technique, with no stylistic incongruity, in a successful syncretism of Eastern and Western traditions."33 If we accept the willingness of the Portuguese to adapt or outright adopt local cultural traditions, does this automatically imply that there was no local resistance to cultural change in Brazil? The answer is negative, as several recent studies have confirmed34 However, it is equally clear that the Portuguese were eager to avoid such confrontations. Wise counsel on this matter was voiced by the late-eighteenth century Viceroy of Brazil, the Marques de Lavradio. Writing about indigenous communities in the south of the colony, he suggested that "rather than by brandishing the sword...the Portu guese should win over the Indians by examples of piety and kindness."35 In the Amazon, as well, the same conciliatory mindset is evident: to entice inhabitants back to villages in the Rio Branco region following a devastating revolt in 1781-2, the Crown offered amnesty to the rebels, a policy that apparently was successful, according to on site observers.36 The Amazonian visual data examined here strongly suggest that the process of reconfiguring the cultural landscape included the input of the indigenous population (subalterns). Not only was "give and take" feasible, it may well have been perceived as desirable by avoiding confrontation. In demonstrating that compromise was possible, notwithstanding the hegemonic parameters of official policy, these examples of cultural borrow ing speak eloquently to a virtually unexamined arena of the Brazilian colonial historical experience. Clearly, we can no longer claim that cultural production in the late-colonial Amazon was uni-directional. While we may never be able to say with certainty that the Portuguese recog nized that they were giving tacit approval to a hybridized material culture, or even that they acknowledged the possibility of a dialogue between colonized and colonizer, the visual record of the late-colonial Amazon would seemingly support both possibilities by confirming the existence of frequent (and obviously acceptable) material culture syncretisms. In the final analysis, we are obliged to look beyond imperial domina tion and resistance to syncretism, if we are truly to understand the evolution of colonial cultural landscapes.</page><page sequence="12">128 CONFERENCE OF LATIN AMERICANIST GEOGRAPHERS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS An earlier version of this paper was presented at the conference on "Material Culture, Life Styles and Consumption in the Iberian World, 16th-19th centuries," University of Delaware, April 1996.

Un examen de la evidencia iconografica y cartografica de la region de Amazonas en la ultima parte del siglo decimoctavo muestra que los Portugueses frequentemente adopto o adapto el conocimiento indigena entre la construcion de la cultura material, mientras hablando sobre el "proyecto" de europeizacion de la population local. Este ejemplo sugiere, fuertemente, que las ezfuerzas analiticas que reduce la evidencia del poder imperial entre paradigmas globales podrian ser opuestas cuando el proceso colonial es visto en un contexto local. Palabras significantes: evidencia visual, "conocimiento local," paisaje cultural, analisis contextual, pragmatismo.</page></plain_text>
