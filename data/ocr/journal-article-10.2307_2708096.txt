<plain_text><page sequence="1">"OF DIFFERING AGES AND CLIMES" BY J. W. JOHNSON "Everybody talks about the weather. . . ." So begins Mark Twain's famous aphorism; and it might well be concluded, " either directly or indirectly," for so pervasive are the timeless myths of cli- mate and its effects that even those who deliberately avoid the weather as a conversational gambit nevertheless end up discussing it in one form or another. The modern science of climatology, with its precise measuring instruments and its charts and tables, has refuted many of the myths which mankind has long repeated about the weather and it has also confirmed some. But in developing such new fields as meteorology, scientists have clung to the mythopoeic practice of personifying natural phenomena-the wind " Maria," Hurricane Alice-and the ageless legends of climate tinge the sociologist in his investigation of the high rate of suicide and crimes of passion in hot weather and the historian in his theories of the pattern of cultural evolution and degeneration. Furthermore, the world of popularly held ideas tacitly acknowledges the ubiquitous strength of the cli- mate myths in its cant about the " inferiority " of dark skinned peo- ples and the White Man's Burden, the sexual precocity of Southern- ers, the bibulosity of Scandinavians, the " musical " quality of Italian and other Romance languages, the dictatorships and revolutions of South America and Africa, and so on. Twentieth-century man, for all his empirical knowledge about the warming of the Pacific Ocean seeding rain-clouds, and the melting of the Polar ice cap is a mere stone's throw from the myths of the antique past. The rhizome of all climatic myth was the primitive attitude to- ward the earth as the productive source of life in its varied forms, either as a fertile, self-contained generator (the autochthonous the- ory-" of earth itself ") or as the passive recipient of the procreative energy of the sun. In anthropomorphic form, the first theory became the legend of the Earth-Mother (Cybele, Lilith, the Magna Mater); and the second, that of Ra, Vishnu, Ouranos, Zeus (the Sky-Father or Sun). Whether theocentric or theacentric, both theories empha- sized the earth as the womb of all living things and the stuff of the earth as the matter comprising life forms; consequently, all of the dawn-legends depict the race of man as indigenes, formed from the earth or dirt itself. The primitive creation stories of the Assyrians and Babylonians, the Hellenic tales of Jason and the dragon's teeth and of Deucalion and Pyrrha, the legend of Aphrodite's birth from the foam of the sea, the " J " version of creation in Genesis 2:7-all of these reflect the view that flesh is dust. One primitive creation myth even explains the different races as the result of the varying shades of clay from which men were originally formed.' 1 See Sir James Frazer, Folklore in the Old Testament (New York, 1923), 1-15; C. Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks (London, 1951), 209-214. 465</page><page sequence="2">466 J. W. JOHNSON The legends of pre-historic time inevitably found their way into the works of the early historiographers. In his painstaking tracing of the races of the Mediterranean world, Herodotus stressed the idea of tribes " sprung from the soil," noting that such an origin was hon- orable for its dignity and longevity and was a source of pride to such aVTOXOovot as the Libyans and Aethiopians. Even those people like the Caunians, who wished to be thought of other origins, were con- veniently declared to be indigenous by Herodotus.2 As a result, an autochthonous beginning was considered a mark of prestige by the Greeks, especially the Johnny-come-lately Athenians, who were glori- fied by Sophocles and Euripides as earth-sprung and whose pride as such was mentioned by Isocrates and Plato.3 The scientific authority of Hippocrates, who implicitly supported the theory of indigenous peoples, also helped to glorify the concept among the Greeks.4 The Romans, however, placed less emphasis on being aborigines than the Greeks did, probably because their own migratory origins were well known. M. Porcius Cato, in his now lost Origines, declared that the first Romans were the descendants of Arcadian Greeks, who came to Italy seventeen generations before Troy under the leadership of Oenotrus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus generally approved of Cato's theory, though he also reported the common Roman claim of being aboriginal and autochthonous, and he unequivocally termed the Sicels and other barbaroi autochthonous.5 The sceptical Livy gen- erally discredited the idea of indigenes, remarking that city-founders are all too prone to gather an " obscure and lowly multitude " about them and then " pretend that the earth has raised up sons to them." " Still later, Tertullian caustically wrote of the so-called terrae-filii, or "C sons of the earth": '. . . where a man's parents were unknown it was easy for him to be called the child of sky and earth; we must all pass for their children." 7 In spite of the scorn of the rationalists, the popularity of the au- tochthonous hypothesis became widespread, usually taking the form of the theory which had been espoused by the Pre-Socratic philosophers. Lucretius expounded this view tellingly; but it was most flamboy- antly expressed by Diodorus Siculus (c. 40 B.C.). In his " universal history," Diodorus anthologized the prevalent theories of the origin of the universe and race of man, and then stated his own view as follows: Heaven and Earth were at first indistinguishable but then separated and took on specific characteristics. The fiery elements went to the highest regions and were caught upward in the " uni- 2 Herodotus, I.172; IV.107; IV.197. 3 See Paul Pezron, The Antiquities of Nations (London, 1706), 172-173; Herman R.

But as the sun's fire shone upon the land, it first of all became firm, and then, since its surface was in a ferment because of the warmth, portions of the wet swelled up in masses in many places, and in these pustules covered with delicate membranes made their appearance.... And while the wet was being impregnated with life by reason of the warmth in the manner de- scribed, by night the living things forthwith received their nourishment from the mist that fell from the enveloping air, and by day were made solid by the intense heat; and finally, when the embryos had attained their full development and the membranes had been thoroughly heated and broken open, there was produced every form of animal life. Of these, such as had partaken of the most warmth set off to higher regions, having become winged, and such as retained an earthy consistency came to be numbered in the class of creeping things and of other land animals, while those whose composition partook the most of the wet element gathered into the region congenial to them, receiving the name of water animals. And since the earth constantly grew more solid through the action of the sun's fire and of the winds, it was finally no longer able to generate [italics mine] any of the larger animals, but each kind of living creatures was now begotten by breeding with one another.8 As a corollary to this theory of creation, Diodorus declared that the Ethiopians were the most ancient people (7rpWTovs a1vOpwJVW abravrwv), because they dwelt under the noonday sun and thus were " the first to be generated by the earth (etwyovicat G0 Tqo i-- yX) . . . since, inas- much as it was the warmth of the sun which, at the generation of the universe, dried up the earth when it was still wet and impregnated it with life, it is reasonable to suppose that the region which was nearest the sun was the first to bring forth living creatures." 9 But though he personally furthered the title of the Ethiopians as the first-born, Diodorus noted that the Egyptians claimed this distinction for them- selves: Now the Egyptians have an account like this: When in the beginning the universe came into being, men first came into existence in Egypt, both be- cause of the favorable climate of the land, and because of the nature of the Nile. For this stream, since it produced much life and provides a spon- 8Diodorus Siculus, I.7. Diodorus' term is twoyovEZv (lit. "to produce or bring forth life "). Cf. Diodorus, I.8; Herodotus, II.15. Readers of an Associated Press dispatch from New York on Sept. 1, 1959, encountered a modern version of Diodorus' ancient theory. Dr. J. D. Bernal, of the University of London, was re- ported to have told the first International Oceanographic Congress, that " Life on earth began in muddy ooze and floating scum where rivers flowed into ancient seas.... Chemical reactions could take place in the continually forming mud.... And this mud could also trap a kind of scum of simple organic molecule swept in by tides and winds.... The clay could form them into chain-like chemicals to become the first proteins and other essential materials of living things." 9 Diodorus, III.2.</page><page sequence="4">468 J. w.

As proof that animal life appeared first of all in their land, they would offer the fact that even at the present day the soil of the The- baid at certain times generates mice in such numbers and of such size as to astonish all who have ever witnessed the phenomenon; for some of them are fully formed as far as the breast and front feet and are able to move, while the rest of the body is unformed, the clod of earth still retaining its natural character.'0 This impressive proof of autochthonous life was lasting in its effects."1 When the Augustan historians became models for the chauvinistic historiographers of the Renaissance, the chthonic origin of races was heavily drawn upon. Gildas explained the origin of the earliest Bri- tons by saying they were a " people bredd in the soyle," and Polydore Vergil accepted the same view.'2 Christopher Helvicus strongly echoed Diodorus in his statement that Adam had been created out of "the slime of the earth " 13 and Georgius Cedrenus, in the Renais- sance translation of his Annals, recounted tales proving the exist- ence of amazing specimens of life in the Nile region as late as the Vth century A.D.'4 A popular revision of Denis Petavius' History of the World (1659) explained the fertility and sweet taste of the Nile as due to " the extream force of the Sun beating alwayes on it, and making it the lighter, purer and simpler," though it also produced " an abundance of venemous creatures." 1' The theory of spontane- ous generation was widely held in the XVIJth century in spite of at- tacks against it in the earlier work of Bodin and contemporary assults by Paul Pezron and William Wotton, who contemptuously stated that only a " Libertine " could " think that Men, like Mushrooms, sprung 10 Diodorus, I.10.

Herodotus, II.15: " I hold rather that the Egyptians did not come into being with the making of that which the Ionians call the Delta: they ever existed since men were first made (cd o3 avOpw7rwiv y7Evo; eyeveTro) 11 Lucretius, V.803; Ovid, Metamorphosis, I.80. It is interesting that the scien- tific Pliny the Elder largely ignored the question of how mankind came into being, though his panegyric on Mother Earth retains something of the attitude which gov- erned the autochthonous theory.

Diodorus, Ovid, and Lucretius were constantly being cited ironically to insult rationalist and zealot alike.'8 Dryden, for instance, treated the Scottish Covenanters as: A slimy-born and sun-begotten tribe; Who, far from steeples and their sacred sound, In fields their sullen conventicles found.

In spite of his distaste for the autochthon- ous theory, Pezron was forced to admit that the East was the " Cradle of the hu- mane Race " and thus did hold races of indigenous origin. 17Jacobus Perizonius, Jgyptiarum Originum et Temporum Antiquissimorum Investigatio in 2 VA (Utrecht, 1736), I, 14. Perizonius' explanation for the autoch- thonous legend was that ancient men lived in caves, as did animals and reptiles, and tales of people sprung from the earth were an over-literal description of the emer- gence from caves.

JOHNSON Thus even after it was no longer credited as a scientific theory, the autochthonous concept was kept before the public by the poets until in 1859 in its refurbished form, it was restored to respectability by Darwin in his Origin of Species. Co-existent with the ancient chthonic myths and supplementary to them was the rather more scientific theory of geographical " zones." The first ideas of the earth as divided into discernible sections were advanced by Poseidonius, the Stoic philosopher who divided the earth into five main zones with the torrid band as the center and the two extremes arctic and antarctic, and by Polybius, who established six zones. Strabo, the earliest extant geographer, summarized the views of both Poseidonius and Polybius and added his own theory of the climata, geographical sections defined in terms of latitude, which were clearly established on the assumption that certain regions might be identified by their meteorological attributes and effects on flora, fauna, and genus humanis.22 Diodorus Siculus combined his myths of crea- tion with his conception of geography in the description of the earth as spherical and divided into three zones, which had been set up by certain wise men in Memphis." 23 Furthermore he made the con- nection between izones and climatic influence so definite as to tie them together permanently in the minds of his followers.24 The later Isi- dore of Seville divided the earth into seven zones, each of which was peculiarized by the customs of its inhabitants and the uniqueness of its natural life.25 These classical views and their variants became the basis for later theories by Renaissance geographers and historians, and ancient views of climatic influence remained significant in Renais- sance thought.26 The cross-pollination of the chthonic and zone theories produced many colorful mutations in classical and subsequently in medieval and Renaissance literature. Writers dogmatized about the effects of the sun, of heat and cold, of the air, soil, mountains, and water on min- erals, plants, and animals. In their simplest form, these climatic stories were still closely related to their primitive, anthropomorphic form. Justin, for instance, earnestly insisted that Nature, when she first distributed to different countries degrees of heat and cold, immediately produced in them animals fitted to endure the several climates, and generated also numerous sorts of trees and herbs . . .27 In their more sophisticated version, climatic views seemed very close to the Darwinian theory of natural selection: * . . in the case of plants and animals, the seeds have less power to main- tain their natural quality than the character of the soil and climate in 22Strabo, II.2. 23Diodorus, I.40. 24Diodorus, III.34 25 Isidore of Seville, Etymologiarum, III.xii.4. 26For typical Renaissance treatments of climate and geography, see Bodin, 86; Petau, 1; Petrus Justinianus, Rerum Venetarum (Venice, 1576), 399.</page><page sequence="7">" OF DIFFERING AGES AND CLIMES" 471 which they live has power to change it. Whatever grows in its own soil has great excellence; transplanted to another soil, its virtue being modified to suit that in which it grows, it loses its virtue.28 Thus wrote Livy. Varro and Pliny held similar notions.29 Whether obvious fantasy or crypto-science, climatic legends were rich and varied. Herodotus was fascinated by the horses of Scythia, which could stand cold that mules could not, and he speculated on the relationship of cold climate and lack of horns.30 Strabo also was con- cerned with the Scythian asses and why sheep could thrive where horses could not.3' Diodorus declared that such gems as emeralds, beryls, and topazes were to be found only where the sun was hot enough to produce them, and that the portion of Arabia nearest Syria "breeds" (Tp %Pa) such odd creatures as strutho-cameli (ostriches) and cameleopards (giraffes) to say nothing of the distinctly weird elephant: For it would seem that the land which lies to the south breathes in a great deal of the sun's strength, which is the greatest source of life, and that, for that reason, it generates breeds of beautiful animals in great number and of varied color; and that for the same reason there are produced in Egypt both the crocodiles and river horses, in Ethiopia and the desert of Libya a multitude of elephants and reptiles of every variety and of all other wild beasts and of serpents . ... 32 These African reptiles became especially popular with Roman writers. Pliny reported on them at length; and the historian L. Annaeus Florus solemnly wrote that during the first Punic War: the Romans had to contend not only with human beings, but also with monsters; for a serpent of wondrous size, which seemed to have been created for the defence of Africa harassed their camp on the Bogrados.33 Eventually, Africa became the reputed breeding ground of dragons, basilisks, unicorns, and other equally interesting wildlife.84 Even the early church fathers succumbed to the climatic fantasy. The vener- able Eusebius of Caesaria in the Chronicon described the concourse of the Tigris and Euphrates and listed among the inhabitants of the Babylonian plain a race of semi-humans with goat legs and horns on their heads.35 Isidore of Seville was similarly fanciful; and even as late as the VIIIth century, the Venerable Bede attributed the lack of 27 Justin, I.10. 28 Livy, XXXVIII.17. 29 Varro, I.6. 30 Herodotus, IV.28-29. 31 Strabo, VI.3.18. 32 Diodorus, II.51.52.

JOHNSON snakes in Ireland to special properties of the air.36 Moreover, Jean Bodin in the XVIth century triumphantly solved the problem of Herodotus' Scythian horses by his own theory of internal heat.37 As fascinating as climatic views of minerals, plants, and animals may be, it is those concepts about the effects of climate on man that held the deepest interest for past ages and which still leave their mark on the popular thought of today.38 The kernel of all " climatanthro- pological " thought is contained in Pliny's succinct summary: We must deal next with the results connected with these heavenly [i.e., meteorological] causes. For it is beyond question that the Aethiopians are burnt by the heat of the heavenly body near them and are born with a scorched appearance, with curly beard and hair, and that in the opposite region of the world the races have white frosty skins, with yellow hair that hangs straight; while the latter are fierce owing to the rigidity of their cli- mate but the former wise because of the mobility of theirs . . . in the latter country dangerous wild beasts are found, in the former a great variety of animals and especially of birds; but in both regions men's stature is high, owing in the former to the pressure of the fires and in the latter to the nourishing effect of the damp; whereas in the middle of the earth [the cent- ral zone], owing to a healthy blending of both elements, there are tracts that are fertile for all sorts of produce, and men are of medium bodily sta- ture, with a marked blending even in the matter of complexion; customs are gentle, senses elastic, intellects fertile and able to grasp the whole of nature; and they also have governments, which the outer races never have pos- sessed, any more than they have ever been subject to the central races, being quite detached and solitary on account of the savagery of the nature that broods over those regions.39 The chthonic and zonal bias of this passage is obvious; and it estab- lishes those areas of climatic influence on man which were all impor- tant to the Hellenic peoples and their followers: those of physical, intellectual, emotional effects on individuals with consequent results in national character, political institutions, and finally military and historical behavior. In general terms, the physical effects of climate took the form of speculation about health and life span. Herodotus believed the Egyptians had " a climate peculiar to themselves " which resulted in 36 Venerable Bede, Opera Historica, ed. and trans. J. E. King (Loeb Classics), 1.1. 37 Bodin, 96. 38 For partial summaries of climatic legends before and during the Renaissance, see Bodin, 85-152; William Falconer, Remarks on the Influence of Climate (Lon- don, 1781). For a comprehensive treatment of Augustan ideas of climate, see John Arbuthnot, An Essay Concerning the Nature of Ailments (London, 1731), and An Essay Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies (London, 1733). Buffon, Fontenelle, Montesquieu, Chardin, Du Bos, and Saint-Pierre in France held similar ideas. Cf. J. B. Bury, The Idea of Progress (London, 1928), 146-147; Carl Becker, The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth Century Philosophers (New Haven, 1932), 101; Paul Hazard, La crise de la conscience Europeenne (Paris, 1935), 12. 39 Pliny, II.lxxx.</page><page sequence="9">" OF DIFFERING AGES AND CLIMES" 473 their being " the healthiest of all men, next to the Libyans; the rea- son of which to my thinking is that the climate in all seasons is the same." 40 Hippocrates noted that the hot air of Libya and Egypt scorched and parched the people, thereby giving them certain states of health, just as the snows and cold winds influenced the health of the Pontic peoples.41 Dionysius of Halicarnassus recorded the ideas of Herodotus and Strabo that the Ethiopians lived to be 120 years old, the Indians 130, and the Hyperboreans 1000; but he insisted that men could not live to advanced ages like these in Italy, for " this length of life is not produced by our climes." 42 Climate had certain specific physical effects as well. The sun in the southern zones turned the Ethiopians and Libyans black, and it also caused thick skulls " because the bone thickens by exposure to the sun." 4 Climate could make the body generate lice, which even- tually consumed the flesh.44 Sharpness of air produced hardy bodies and constitutions.45 High bodily temperatures caused sweetly frag- rant odors just as a hot climate caused Arabia to be spice-bearing.46 And living on snow-covered mountains could have dramatic results: . . . the bodies of Alpine races, reared in a moist climate, have a certain similarity to their own snows, for as soon as they become heated in the fray, they immediately break into sweat and are dissolved by slight exer- tion, as snow is melted by the sun.47 This pastiche of folklore was dutifully absorbed by the Renais- sance. Machiavelli accepted the ancient view of health and locale and 40 Herodotus, 1.35; II.77. 41 Hippocrates, Airs, Waters, Places, XXXVII-XXXVIII.

The physical aspect of the climate myth became one of the bases for the ancient view of the Noble Savage.

The connection between the climate legends and the theory of bodily " humours " is surprisingly tenuous in classical literature. Hip- pocrates and Galen outlined the humours thesis in their works; but though its con- nection with the autochthonous myth is obvious, it was little referred to in non- medical literature of the Greeks and Romans. Pliny and Aristotle gave it passing notice, but the humours theory became widespread in popularity during the Middle Ages and Renaissance in a form largely divorced from climatic theories. Cf.

In fact if we examine the complexions of different countries, we shall find them darken in proportion to the heat of their climate; and the shades gradually to deepen as they approach the line." 54 In conjunction with the theory of climate and physique, there de- veloped the view that climate directly affected human sexuality. Herodotus, who had been there, said that Africans as a whole were of a highly sensual and passionate nature and were notorious for sexual promiscuity.55 Hippocrates equated cold climates with sexual impo- tence at worst and apathy at best, using the unfortunate Scythians as examples; and he reversed the coin by correlating hot climates and lustful behavior."6 Livy remarked that of all the barbarians, the Africans were the most " prone to sensuality "; and Justin wrote of Hannibal that he preserved such continence along his female captives 48 Niccolo Machiavelli, History of Florence (New York, 1901), 54-55.

"7 Even Saint Augustine in his Confessions gave covert support to the view of heat and sexual passion as integrally related. In the XVIth century when world exploration opened up a new interest in strange and remote peoples, the classical view of the Afri- can as sexually precocious gained new prominence. Bodin and his disciples popularized the old idea, which eventually found one literary shape in Othello, Shakespeare's "lascivious" and "dark-skinned" Moor.58 Linnaeus formulated in precise Latin the ancient opinions of the Negro's genitalia which Swift expressed in a self-conscious double- entendre and Goldsmith judiciously evaluated.59 A tracing of this phase of the climate legend during the past three centuries would be a full study of itself; but Goldsmith's appraisal is typical of the stereotyped notions that have been repeated since: In this slight survey, therefore, I think we may see that all the variations in the human figure, as far as they are different from our own, are pro- duced either by the rigour of the climate, the bad quality, or the scanti- ness of the provisions, or by the savage customs of the country. They are actual marks of degeneracy in the human form; and we may consider the European figure and colour as standards to which to refer all other variet- ies, and with which to compare them. In proportion as the Tartar or American approaches to European beauty, we consider the race less de- generated; in proportion as he differs more widely, he has made greater deviations from his original form.60 Running parallel to the physical concept of climate and enforced by it was the belief that hot and cold regions affected intelligence. Graeco-Roman authors generally agreed that hot climates produce an alert, imaginative, adaptable intellect and cold climates result in dull- 57 Livy, XXIX.23; Justin, 235-236. 58 Othello, I.1.139. 59 Cf. Goldsmith, II, 228. Swift, in his Remarks on Various Subjects com- mented, " Herodotus tells us, that in cold Countries Beasts very seldom have Horns; but in hot they have very large ones. This might bear a pleasant Application." Goldsmith considered the physique of African Negroes " relaxed " by the hot cli- mates which made them ugly in appearance and caused " those parts which among us are usually concealed by dress " to be " warm and languid." 60 Goldsmith discounted the story of the curse of Ham as the cause of the Negro's inferiority; but he maintained that the human race was originally all white and degeneration through climatic effects had resulted in the darker people. He "proved" this thesis-the reverse of that of Uncle Remus, by the way, who con- sidered the human race Negro until the discovery of a pond that bleached a few first-comers white-by citing the case of a Negro couple who produced a white child. This albino Goldsmith unwaveringly considers an avatar of Adam. See II, 235-240.

W. JOHNSON ness, apathy, stolidity; or in less complimentary terms, heat produced facile, volatile, capricious, and subtle minds while cold resulted in stupidity. Consequently, the people of southern zones were consid- ered crafty, insinuating, calculating, nimble of wit, glib, and ingeni- ous; whereas those to the north were ferocious, brutal, cold, dull, cruel, and animalistic.6' The ancient world even developed its own stereotypes to embody these qualities. In the north, it was the Scy- thians or the natives of Cyme, who were notorious for their stupidity even to the point of not knowing enough to come in out of the rain.62 In the south, it was the Carthaginians, whose " facile," " glib " char- acter became a synonym for faithlessness: the Punica fides was a graphic example of climatically controlled intelligence.63 The central zone- in which the Hellenic writers fortunately found themselves -produced minds temperate, controlled, sagacious, prudent, and clever.64 As inheritors of this aspect of the climate myth, French and Eng- lish writers felt somewhat discomfited, being " northern " by defini- tion. Holinshed, in his Chronicles, repeated the traditional idea of the British as " strong of bodie " and " full of bloude " because Bri- tain lay "farre from the equinoctiall line, where the soile is not so fruitfull "; but he attacked the southern races as " lesse of stature," "blacker in colour," and " fearfull by nature." Howbeit, as those which are bred in sundrie places of the maine, doo come behind us in constitution of bodie, so I grant, that in pregnancie of wit, nimblenesse of limmes, and politike inuentions, they generallie exceed vs: notwithstanding that, otherwise these gifts of theirs doo often degenerate into meere substiltie, instabilitie, unfaithfulnesse, &amp; crueltie. He was unwilling to concede that the English were " blockish, unciuill, fierce and warlike," despite Leland's assertion that they were.65 A happy solution to the dilemma was found by Bodin, who declared that the classical historians had meant the Swedes and Finns when they derided those of the north; actually, the northern European people came within the temperate zone which was notable for its in- tellectual graces.66 This shifting of the zones permitted the French 61 See Hippocrates.

Aside from the alteration of zones, writers after 1600-Bacon, Shakespeare, Browne-made few changes in the prejudiced notions of climate and intelligence. These views were especially common in the XVIIIth century, often being used to shore up post-Renaissance nationalism and justify dawning British imperialism. Sir William Temple rationalized popular feeling against the Dutch by calling them " naturally cold and heavy " and explaining that cold always makes spirits and imagination sluggish while heat makes them vola- tile.67 John Boyle, Lord Orrery, held the same ideas and wondered whether insanity in England was not due to the " variable and uncer- tain climate " and to an atmosphere " filled with clouds and sulphur- ous vapours." 68 John Dennis expressed a widespread opinion when he explained the paucity of English literature by the coldness of the cli- mate; this was a common explanation for what the Augustans felt was a reflection upon English culture.69 Swift, distressed at the sorry state of letters, thought the cold and heavy climate of England was responsible; and Fielding recorded his opinion that taste and benevo- lence were rare in northern climates with consequent deficiencies in art and science.70 Dr. Samuel Johnson, with characteristic icono- clasm, dismissed the idea of climatic influence as nonsense, but Bos- well persisted in deploring the dependence of wit upon weather.71 Eighteenth-century opinion of climate, which underlies modern views, is best seen in two anthologies: William Falconer's Remarks on the Influence of Climate and Goldsmith's History of the Earth. Both works stress the causal relationship between intelligence and climate, though Falconer mostly summarizes classical and Renaissance opin- ions and relies upon this ipse dixit.72 Goldsmith, on the other hand, " correlates " scientific material with myth and then makes some far- reaching conclusions about the inferiority of the dark-skinned races mentally as well as physically.

W. JOHNSON As their persons are thus naturally deformed, at least to our imaginations, their minds are equally incapable of strong exertions. The climate seems to relax their mental powers still more than those of the body; they are, therefore, in general, found to be stupid, indolent, and mischievous.73 [And of the Indians:] The Indians have long been remarkable for their cowardice and effeminacy . . . . The warmth of the climate entirely in- fluences their manners; they are slothful, submissive, and luxurious: satis- fied with sensual happiness alone, they find no pleasure in thinking; and contented with slavery, they are ready to obey any master.74 Written in the age of Warren Hastings, these words reflect a popular view which in time led to the Black Hole of Calcutta, General Kitchener, Cecil Rhodes, The War Between the States, and White Citizens' Councils, to say nothing of such literary results as Kipling's "Recessional," Uncle Tom's Cabin, and A Passage to India. As an inevitable offshoot of the belief that physique and intelli- gence are determined by climate there grew increasingly the popular- ity of national stereotypes. The classical world had left a legacy of these to accompany its climatic myths; not only the Carthaginians and the Cymeans had become famous for over-simplified attributes but the Greeks, Italians, Egyptians, Spanish, Gauls, and Germans had as well. So common were these epithets that Isidore of Seville was able to state them with encyclopedia terseness: Romans (serious- ness), Greeks (levity), Africans (craft), Gauls (ferocity) and so forth.75 The Gauls were notorious for their drunkenness, as were the Germans, Scythians, and other northern peoples. When Bodin shifted the climatic zones to effect new national personalities, corresponding qualities soon were attached to modern Europeans. From the XVth century on, the Italians were considered passion- ate, the Spanish proud, the French frivolous, the Dutch phlegmatic, the English cold and indifferent, the Swedes drunkards.76 Surging na- tionalism during the Renaissance exaggerated the used of these stereo- types until in the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries they became catch- words. Milton, Temple, Clarendon, Addison, Swift, Mandeville, Bol- ingbroke, Steele all exploited them for one use or another.77 Defoe's " The True-Born Englishman " catalogued the national archetypes, and Goldsmith's " The Traveller " repeated them later in the cen- tury.

The Neo-Classical period also produced a variant thesis of the con- cept of national physique and character: the belief that climate de- termined the nature of language. In its most simple form, the hy- pothesis was that in warm climates, men were willing to open their mouths wider so that languages such as Italian and Spanish contained more vowels, but in cold climates, the speech was more likely to be full of consonants because the Germans, Poles, Dutch, et al. did not want to chill their throats.79 Southern languages thus were " musi- cal," "sweet," and "smooth " while Northern languages were "harsh," "penetrating," " terse," and " severe." 80 The flurry of proposals in England for the establishment of a Royal Language Academy be- tween 1660 and 1710 were goaded by a British desire to legislate out of existence the roughness and crudity which the northern climate had inculcated in English speech.8' The failure of the plan was de- plored as a lapse into the barbarism which northern climates always produced.82 The final aspects of the climate myth-its effects on political sys- tems and military action-blossomed most fully in the XVIIIth cen- tury though the embryonic forms had been sown in the distant past. Herodotus, in cataloguing the governments of various peoples, had amassed the data which later served for such theorists as Plato and Aristotle. The Republic (IV.11), the Laws (III.677-680), and the Politics (VII) mentioned the role of climate in determining forms of government; and Pliny subsequently strengthened the belief that political customs were dependent to a great extent upon the heat or cold of a region.83 The first complete study of climate and politics was Bodin's, which equated warm climates with despotism and tyr- anny, temperate climates with balanced government and freedom, and cold climates with pure democracies or even communism, the exact opposite of the torrid oligarchies.84 Clarendon and Temple in Eng- 78 Arbuthnot was also influenced by the current use of le mythe animal.

JOHNSON land, and Chardin in France, popularized the idea; Arbuthnot and Falconer formulated it; and Montesquieu's treatises on the subject were so comprehensive as to become the locus classicus for future ages.85 Similarly, the notion that climate caused military action always from north to south-or from colder zones to warmer-was latent in Herodotus' descriptions of the Scythian conquest of Assyria and the Greek conquest of Persia as well as in Hippocrates' discussion of the migratory behavior of the overwhelming Scythians.86 Roman and Byzantine histories of the Gothic invasions implicitly supported the idea that fierce, rugged northerners invariably defeat indolent, com- placent southerners in battle; and Machiavelli and Bodin transferred the view into Renaissance thought.Y By the XVIIIth century, the truism had become a doctrine, so much so that the Scottish Rebellion of 1745 was nervously viewed by the English as an almost inevitable disaster since the attack came from the north.88 The advent of XIXth-century pragmatism and scientific empiri- cism did much to diminish the dignity of classic ideas of climatic in- fluence on men and nations, but it did not succeed in annihilating them. Even today the arcane myths keep popping up in some odd places. Such products of mass culture as comic strips and Hollywood " scare '2 movies thrive on Diodoran-like monsters which spring from the soil autochthonously. The sociologist's statistics do show that there are more murders when the temperature reaches a certain peak. Occasionally, respectable newspapers like The New York Times sug- gest that a shift in the earth's position is responsible for higher tem- peratures in northern zones which presage cultural and military strength in formerly backward nations like Japan and Russia. And, amazingly, the British Parliament in 1953 voted to lower the tem- perature of the House to 66 degrees because a climatologist had con- vinced them that chilly heads make prudent decisions.89 In one form or another, most of the pre-historic myths are still among us. University of Rochester. 85 Cf. Temple, I, 61-136; Arbuthnot, Air, 150; Falconer, 117-129; Montesquieu, Spirit of Laws. The belief that political freedom was inherent in chilly climates was a very popular one with English poets. Cf. Addison's " A Letter From Italy," Fielding's " Liberty," Thomson's "Winter," Goldsmith's "Traveller," Tennyson's "Of Old Sat Freedom," Robert Graves' " Rocky Acres." 86 Hippocrates, Airs, Waters, Places, XVII-XXII. One might wonder how the infertile Scythians managed to overpopulate to such an extent they could overwhelm the Mediterranean world. This logical contradiction is only one of many in the climate myth. 87 Machiavelli, 3; Bodin, 93. 88See Falconer, 184-187; Henry Fielding, A Serious Address to the people of Great Britain (London, 1745), 44. 89 Cf.
