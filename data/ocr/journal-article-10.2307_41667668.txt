<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RUINS OF PAJATEN BY PEDRO ROJAS PONCE Translated by Donald W. Lathrap It has long been known that there are ancient ruins in the basin of the Huallaga River, particularly in the vicinity of the Huayabamba, Jelache and Pa- jatén rivers, all tributaries of the Huallaga. This in- formation comes both from the authors of the early Spanish chronicles and from surveyors who have studied routes for access roads into the area. This re- cent kind of investigation will increase the accessibility of the region and afford fuller knowledge of it. The architect Victor Pimentel G., assistant director of the Peruvian Tourism Corporation, became aware of the archaeological significance of the rich basin of the Huallaga through data given by Sr. Carlos T. Torreai va J., of the community of Pajatén, who with others from the same locality came upon the ruins within the high forest at the juncture of the Jelache and Santa Cruz rivers, at an elevation of 2850 meters. At the time they were searching for new land to bring under cultivation. Until now it has been difficult to determine the precise location of these ruins or to get an adequate description of them because travelers through this zone have always been involved in other kinds of studies. The present expedition was organized through the direct intervention of Fernando Belaunde Terry, Presi- dent of the Republic of Peru, for the purpose of studying these Precolumbian remains. A group of specialists from several government agencies was in- cluded, and funds were provided by the Ministry of Public Education and the Peruvian Tourism Corpora- tion. This was the first time that several of us, each representing a different government agency, united for a single purpose, and the experiment worked out magnificently, as each one brought to bear the skills unique to his own specialty. Having completed all the required medical exam- inations, purchased provisions and arranged our trans- portation, we left Lima on November 11, 1965. Be- sides the government personnel noted above, the expedition included seven sub-officials and soldiers in charge of communications, health and safety - a total of fourteen persons. We reached the city of Trujillo by Air Force plane. Here we awaited a specially char- tered bus in which we departed for Huamachuco, where we spent the night. On the afternoon of the 12 th we arrived at the bridge of Chagual over the Marañón River. On the following day, after five hours' travel, we reached Patáz, where the inhabitants received us royally. The next day's part of the trip was a short (three-hour) journey to a place called Los Alisos. En route we saw a series of terraces ar- ranged in pyramidal form at the peak of a hill called Cuymuy. We could not visit them, since it would have been necessary to cross the valley and pass through the next valley, the Zarumilla. We heard that in the gorge of Colpar, about two hours' distance from Los Alisos, there were pictographs in yellow and blue with representations of the sun and the moon. From Los Alisos one can distinguish for a short distance an ancient irrigation ditch, now largely de- stroyed. Between Los Alisos and Manachaqui, where we spent the following night, we noted the remains of an ancient Precolumbian road (ca. 2.50 m. in 9</page><page sequence="2">MOUNTAINOUS REGION around Pajatén.

PAJATEN continued width), which proceeds in a straight line through very boggy land. Usually one could distinguish its retaining walls, built of cut stone. This road con- tinued to the Entrada al Monte ("entrance to the wilderness"). The region, at about four thousand meters' elevation, is covered, like a large part of the northern sierra, by enormous bogs. Horses that leave the track here wallow helplessly in the mud. At this point the landscape changes abruptly. From the Jalea region we passed rapidly into a forest of dense vegetation wreathed in perpetual fog which almost reaches the ground. From here on we had to go without the pack animals and carry all our equipment and provisions on our backs, following trails which were sometimes very narrow, often descending at an angle of more than forty-five degrees, or fording rivers. This kind of travel lasted for two days, the first bringing us to La Playa (2640 meters' elevation), where we spent the night, the second bringing us to the ruins themselves, situated at an elevation of 2850 meters. The ruins of Pajatén are located at longitude 77° 18' west and latitude 7° 43' south, in the drainage basin of the Huallaga River between the Jelache and Santa Cruz rivers. These are tributaries of the Pajatén and the Huayabamba, which in turn enter the Hual- laga River to the south of Juanjui. The region is part of a series of rugged mountain chains completely covered by the characteristic vegeta- tion of the upper forest, especially by gigantic cedars. The Santa Cruz River has its source in certain lakes southeast of Patáz and, with the Jelache and other rivers, forms a fan of tributaries which rapidly aug- ment the volume of the Pajatén River. In its middle course is located the ancient town of the same name, which was described in 1789 as having a population of two thousand. The spurs of these mountain chains extend toward the east. A superficial scanning of the crests reveals traces of terraces and slight undulations that are evi- dence of man's handiwork. We could not confirm these hints of human occupation since we had very little time to carry out our objectives, but I believe that it would be easy to do at another time of year (May-October) when the rainy season tapers off. The hill where the ruins of Gran Pajatén are lo- cated has the form of the letter C, most clearly so at the summit. Its extreme southern part connects with a huge outcropping of slate covered with vegetation, which rises above the top of the hill. In the vertical walls of this pinnacle can be seen rectangular cuttings, like windows, each with a small retaining wall on the 11</page><page sequence="4">BUILDING 2, part of the decoration showing through the foliage.

They seem to be tombs of a kind usually found in the northern Andes. The rocky pinnacle is flat on top; it is certain that there are remains of buildings on it as well. The lower slopes of the hill, from the point where it is bounded by the Jelache River to the Santa Cruz, are entirely covered with large agricultural terraces, and we imagine that all of the rest of this region is similar; that is to say, it was a great " 'granary" which could have fed thousands of people. The region is healthful. Its lower reaches, down to the banks of the rivers, are hot and abound in palm trees. The higher areas have an agreeable climate, suitable for all kinds of crops. There are no plagues of little creatures such as ants or spiders. Upon reaching the summit we experienced an over- whelming emotion, for we had never seen walls so magnificently monumental or so nearly intact. We saw a series of circular buildings, mostly of two stories with a projecting cornice between them. The build- ings were literally covered with geometric, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic decoration, executed in slaty stone. The green moss on the walls shone brilliantly in the light of the sun, contrasting with the somber background of enormous trees which hid the buildings. We managed to clear the dense vegetation from about 40,000 square meters, which led to the discov- ery of eight buildings, all circular in shape. The ma- sonry consists of long slabs of slaty rode of almost uniform size, bound with a mortar of very sticky black clay and wedged with smaller blocks, almost like inlay work. The buildings were constructed so as to take maxi- mum advantage of the terrain. Some are slightly higher than others. Between the buildings are passage- ways, stairways fanning out as they descend, and ter- races with large cornices. It appears that all of the architectural complex was paved with tile in order that the torrential rains might readily drain off. More- over, drains were noted under the pavement. The architecture of the complex gives the same impression of dormant energy as is generated by the surrounding wilderness. Wherever one looks there are corridors and angular cornices which give a sense of movement. On the upper part of the hill there was a fairly well preserved two-storied structure which we called Build- ing 1. The diameter of this structure is 14.75 m. and its height is four meters, equally divided between the two stories. It rises on a foundation of irregular form consisting of large slabs. It has an exterior stairway of ten steps (3.20 m. wide) on the northwest, leading to the upper story. This stairway was constructed sub- sequent to one inside the building ; it is not well made and the stones are without proper binding. Perhaps it was added to hide an entrance into the lower story. Part of this story appears to have had a tiled pave- ment which, because of the constant moisture and the action of tree roots, is disintegrating and turning into a very sticky black clay. The northwest side of Building 1 faces a plaza with a tiled pavement bounded by a large terrace. The roots of great trees have moved some of the stones from their original position. At a distance of 2.75 m. to the northwest of the stairway a vertical stone shaft was found embedded in the pavement. It is 1.20 m. high, with a rectangular base and with the upper portion in the form of a sharp-edged lance. It resembles various stelae, or "huancas," such as those in Chavin or Huaylas, which are markers for sacred localities or tombs. The outer surface of this building is richly deco- rated, although the interior is finished simply. The ornamented surfaces of the larger buildings (1, 5, 7, 8) face northwest and are more or less alike. Beside these buildings are others of smaller size, also circular (5-9 m. in diameter) with decoration completely en- circling the structure. The decoration of the upper part of Building 1 is geometric and is formed by slabs of stone which are embedded in the body of the wall and project about five centimeters beyond it. At both top and bottom of the upper story there is a row of triangles, while in the center are some maeander designs and closely spaced stepped triangles. The lower part of the build- ing is ornamented with seated human figures (each 1.18 m. high), five at each side of the stairway. Their arms and legs are flexed, with the fingers and toes touching those of adjacent figures. They wear crowns with large crests which appear to represent feather plumes. Sometimes these plumes are divided into two groups of five each, one on each side of the head ; in other instances they are arranged radially around the head. The heads, elbows and knees - that is to say, the parts that are carved - are of reddish sandstone. The heads are, in fact, tenoned and penetrate deeply into the wall. The tenons are much thicker than those of the well known tenoned heads of Chavin and Tiahuanaco. The height of the heads varies from 24 to 36 cm. They are much eroded; some have lost eyes, nose or other features. In general, the heads are elongated, with a prominent nose joined to clearly delineated eyebrows. The mouth is a small horizontal incision and the circular ears project at the level of the eyes. Some heads have a small crown with maeander deco- ration. This type of frieze with human figures is re- 14</page><page sequence="7">BUILDING 7, detail of the ornamental frieze. POTTERY found on the surface at Pajatén. peated on other buildings (5,7 and 8) . The humus and roots which covered the surface of the courtyard of Building 1 (also called the Building of the Huanca) were removed, revealing fragments of pottery. The humus layer which covered the other structures was not cleared away, in order to permit more careful investigation in the future. About 1.75 m. to the north of Building 1 there is a small circular structure, nearly buried, with fallen walls, which we designated Building 2 (or Building of the Condors). Nine meters in diameter, it has a remarkable relief frieze based on stylized figures of condors with wings and tails extended. The first condor figure which we cleaned is 60 cm. high and has a span of 95 cm. It is a powerful but simple representation. As we continued to clean its edges we saw that the frieze continued with other figures. On the south side was a seated human figure (66 cm. wide) with its arms and legs flexed, crowned with three crests on each side of the head. For some dis- tance the roots of a huge tree now serve as a support for the wall, but the frieze is seen to continue beyond this. Only the upper part of another condor figure is visible. It is similar to the first but has a more mas- sive head. Beyond can be seen the upper parts of other reliefs buried in the debris and the rubble from fallen walls. Topping this band of reliefs there is a frieze con- structed of reddish sandstone, with clear delineations of flowers, human figures and other elements. The stones are uniform in height (11 cm.) but vary in length (28, 33 and 35 cm.). In some sections of the frieze are gaps which were refilled at a later time with undecorated stones. Near the second condor a stone from the frieze was found built into the wall not in its original location, which suggests that ancient re- pairs had been somewhat carelessly made. Building 3, located to the southwest of Building 1 and about three meters distant from it, is completely covered with roots and humus. It is possible to see only a little of the exterior wall on the east side, and no decoration is visible. Building 4, to the northwest of Building 2, is of small diameter and covered with humus. Only a sec- tion of the southwest wall is visible up to the full height. It is in a fairly good state of preservation and, judging by its decoration, appears to belong to the class of important buildings such as Building 2. Building 4A is a small circular building adjacent to Building 4 on its north side. When the trees had been removed from its west side, it was possible to see a wall 1.80 m. in height. At the west side extends a small terrace (1.20 m. wide) which merges with the exterior stairway in the courtyard of Building 1. Building 5, east of Building 4, is a large circular structure of which only the lower part is preserved. It has decoration like that of Building 1, consisting of seated human figures. This structure lacks a second story and a stairway. The tenoned heads of the seated personages have disappeared, leaving gaping holes. 15</page><page sequence="8">PLAN of the buildings at Pajatén, made by the second expedition to the site, in June 1966, when eight more buildings were found.

PAJATEN continued In place of the access stairway there is a small circular structure which we designated Building 5B. Building 6 is in reality a terrace with a huge pro- jecting cornice along its northwest side. It is 1.50 m. high and was constructed upon another terrace which has an adjoining stairway connecting to the stairway leading to the courtyard of Building 1. Building 7 is a large circular structure made of slabs. It is situated to the southwest of Building 8. As the structure is covered with moss and roots, it is possible to make out only a little of its decorative re- liefs of maeanders and stepped triangles, which are like those of Building 1. The lower story is completely buried. Building 8 is one of the best preserved on the site. Its west side was cleared of trees, so that we could see the decoration, which consists of seated human figures and maeanders like those of Building 1. In the course of clearing Building 2 we found two mortars of reddish sandstone showing evidence of considerable use. Also found in clearing the building were several cut stones of irregular form. Some were 16</page><page sequence="9">as long as 39 cm., while others were 19 cm. wide and still others 8 cm. in width. At first we did not know what they were, but later we had the luck to find them in situ, embedded in the outside wall of the first story of a building, like huge spikes which could have served as attachments for ropes, thus sup- porting the roof. These stones were related in func- tion to other circular, spool-shaped stones which were founcHnside Buildings 1 and 2. A small tenoned head, like those of Building 2, was found when we cleared the rubble. In cleaning the courtyard of Building 1, we found a considerable number of potsherds, mainly household ware but including some ceremonial vessels. The utili- tarian ware is of a compact red and gray fabric with a rough surface. It is characterized by very thick everted rims with rounded edges, which come from large vessels. The pottery is well fired, of grayish tone shading into orange, red or grayish white. Some sherds of a delicate ware bear decoration painted in red and sepia in fine-line triangular motifs, similar to that on Inca ceramics. The forms are jars with nar- row everted rims and plates with ring-bases slipped in sienna or grayish white. Some horizontal handles of huge urns were also found. Three thick potsherds containing ground quartz show high relief decoration with triangular or wave motifs similar to those on the frieze of the Building of the Condors. Among the pottery fragments were two finds of particular interest. One is part of the neck of an aryballos with little ear-like handles; it is yellowish white in color, with a matt surface and a compact gray biscuit. It was associated with a tumi- type copper knife, typically Inca, which is illustrated here. It has a smooth shiny surface, blue-green in color. These two objects are strong evidence for contact with the Inca empire. Presumably this con- tact was of a commercial nature, since the architectural elements lack any trace of Inca influence. The buildings of Pajatén are typical of Precolum- bian architecture of the northern Andes, which is characterized by walls constructed of cut slate slabs embedded in mud mortar and provided with "pachil- las" (small stones arranged between large ones, like a mosaic). Such can be seen at Anay, Rupak and Chiprak, to the north of Lima, at Tantamayo, Yayno and other sites in the upper basin of the Marañón, and from there on to Chinchipe. At Yayno buildings of circular ground plan, some as much as fifteen meters in height, are associated with others of rectangular ground plan which have walls elaborately decorated on their outer face. The facing stones, carefully selected for color and texture, give the effect of inlay work. The interiors, on the other hand, are roughly finished. The ruins of Pajatén are similar to those encoun- tered throughout the basin of the upper Marañón. The influence of this ancient community must have been great, perhaps dominating a society which oc- cupied much of the upper forest land. Differences exist among the various ruins in respect to the details of wall decoration. A type which I have seen in Condorgaga (Jaén) and Chiguirip ( Cuter vo), on buildings of rectangular plan, consists of designs in the Huaylas style carved in high relief on large stone plaques. At Pajatén, however, decorative slabs are placed so that their ends penetrate deeply into the structure of the wall and are actually part of it. This is the first time, too, that we have seen buildings whose walls have similar decoration on both the upper and the lower story. In general, these structures seem to belong to the Huaylas culture. This is indicated by the architecture and its decoration of seated human figures, by the ceramic vessels with ring-bases, and by the presence of "huancas," or stelae. Our work thus far has been limited to establishing the precise location of the ruins, cutting the trees away from eight buildings, clearing one courtyard, two stairways and several streets which converge on Building 1. The work projected for the future will consist of making a careful archaeological investiga- tion of each complex. It may be possible to extract a great deal of study material, since the ruins do not seem to have been attacked by "huaqueros" (pot- hunters) . It is hoped that eventually a museum will be built on the site to exhibit the collections recovered. Such a museum would be a great attraction and would increase the value of the region as an archae- ological and tourist center. Note : In June 1966 a second short expedition was made to the ruins of Pajatén. The vegetation was cleared to a greater extent, which resulted in the dis- covery of eight more circular buildings, a total of six- teen. A study of the pottery found on the spot has led the archaeologist Dr. Ducio Bonavia to consider the complex as belonging chiefly to a late horizon. FROM 1935 to 1965 the author was Director of the De- partment of Painting and Drawing at the Museum of the University of San Marcos and of the National Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology of Lima. During this pe- riod he collaborated with Dr. Julio C. Tello, Dra. Re- beca Carrión Cachot and Dr. Jorge C. Muelle in archae- ological expeditions. At present he is concerned with providing information on museums and archaeological sites for the Peruvian Tourism Corporation. 17</page></plain_text>
