<plain_text><page sequence="1">Another contentious issue is the absence of bibliographical information - which would, admittedly, if not treated economically, take up a large amount of space. Some authors smuggle important literary works into the text, as Patricia Lopdell does in the entry Trivialliteratur, in which Killy's Deutscher Kitsch (195 I) is mentioned, a reference that would also have been relevant to Ernst Keller's entry Kitsch (see also the entries for Einbildungskraft and Einfache Formen). On the whole, lists of two or three of the most important critical reference works added to the more expansive terms would be of benefit to the user. These remarks are not meant to detract from the merits of this glossary. It can be read as a book and will be of great benefit to the student as well as to the lecturer at all levels of academic courses in German.D 1RICHARD SAMUEL UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE On Blackness Without Blacks: Essays on the Image of the Black in Germany. By SANDER M. GILMAN. Boston, Mass.: G. K. Hall. I982. xiv + I84 pp. $24.95. This volume gives us a further example of Professor Gilman's wide interdisciplinary interests. The eight essays, which appear here as part of a series entitled 'Perspec- tives on the Black World', trace the history of aesthetic and social perceptions of black and blackness from the twelfth century through to the twentieth century. Although the primary focus is on German literary sources, the author also draws widely on English and American thought and literature in order to illustrate the growth and persistence of stereotypes of the black in a world populated mainly by whites. In the preface Professor Gilman reveals that his primary interest is in the psychological function of negative stereotypes within a culture. Such images, he argues, 'hover in the abyss perceived by the observer between himself and the other'; these images of outsider figures, which include stereotypes of women, Jews, and gypsies, embody the fear of the observer and take on mythic features. Sometimes, as in the case ofJews, this mythic image can be altered by juxtaposition with reality. But in the case of blacks in German culture, Gilman argues, the stereotype never encountered such external control and consequently retained its mythic features, which are themselves a blend of soft and hard primitivism with Christian and neo- Platonic associations of black with sin and the Devil. The first essay traces the association of ideas of blackness and madness, in authors as remote from each other as Hartmann von Aue and Mark Twain. Stereotypes of the black and the madman are closely related, we are told, since both 'serve as the means by which the projections of anxiety in Western culture are made manifest'. This chapter includes an interesting historical section outlining nineteenth-century American arguments in defence of slavery. A faulty census appeared to show that the incidence of mental illness was eleven times as high among freed blacks as among slaves; this 'fact' was used to support the argument that slavery was the natural condition of blacks, and attempts by blacks to escape from slavery were themselves ascribed to illness. Thus 'Drapetomania' emerged as 'the disease causing slaves to run away'. The remaining seven chapters discuss images of the black in eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century literature and aesthetic theory. But since each chapter originally appeared separately, no overall argument is sustained and there is an annoying repetition of lengthy quotations and other theoretical material. The reader will find the same passages from Fanon, Kant, Wieland, Burke, and Lessing repeated twice or even three times in adjoining chapters; this lack of editing - plus an appalling number of misprints throughout - is a pity, since the material itself is of great interest.

In the course of the eighteenth century, Professor Gilman argues, 'racism gave way to the question of cultural relativism' and by the end of the century 'the anthropomorphism of darkness was completed and the Black stood as an individual, perceiving reality, rather than as the embodiment of a natural force'. The weakness of this kind of Geistesgeschichte, in the view of this reviewer, is its lack of a political dimension. In the light of the enormous proliferation of the slave trade during the same years which celebrated the spread of enlightened thinking, racism can hardly be described as having 'given way' to cultural relativism; different people subscribed to each view, and they continued to do so throughout the nineteenth century, as Gilman's quotations from Hegel, Nietzsche, and the colonial novel amply demonstrate. But on the whole the black continued to be presented as an emblem of barbarism: Herder's enlightened view that human nature has no hierarchy of colour lost out to Hegel's definition of the African black as 'the Unhistorical, Undeveloped Spirit, still involved in the conditions of mere nature'. Is the persistence of mythic stereotypes in relation to blacks peculiarly character- istic of Germany, or is it a shared feature of most European and American literature up to the twentieth century? Even in countries which offered more real contact with blacks, the existence of a stereotype often seems to have obscured actual perception of an uncomfortable reality. Stereotypes also travel fast: in the frontispiece Professor Gilman cleverly shows how a nineteenth-century American illustration for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin took on a new life in Germany as an advertise- ment for Liebig's Meat Extract. Professor Gilman's concluding point is both controversial and pessimistic: whereas German consciousness is now beginning to respond to the new outsider image of the 'Gastarbeiter', the black, along with theJew, seems condemned to exist only in the world of myth. But there is more than one tradition in German thought, and those who look to Lessing as their model will continue to fight for education as a means of substituting history for myth. Moreover, as black writers articulate their own experience through writing, they enable us to hear an individual voice and to forget a blurred stereotype. It is only by such efforts that we can begin to close the gap between self-consciousness and the fear of otherness. M. KAY FLAVELL BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA La Legende de Tristan au Moyen Age.

It is always difficult to do justice to a collection of articles by different authors on different (if related) topics, since some of the contributions are bound to be devoted to matters outside the reviewer's normal sphere of interest, and no contributor likes to see his name left out or less space devoted to him than to another. But precisely this invidious task is mine in attempting to review the fourteen very wide-ranging articles that resulted from a colloquium on the Tristan legend in the Middle Ages organized by the Centre d'Etudes Medievales de l'Universite de Picardie held at Amiens on 6 and I7 January 1982. Two of the contributors are concerned to put the story of Tristan and Isolde back onto the map of Cornwall. Of these the more arresting is Andre de Mandach's 'Le Berceau des amours splendides de Tristan et Iseut' (pp. 7-33), which is so alluringly detailed that every medievalist must needs reach for his Ordnance Survey map and drive off into the sunset immediately.
