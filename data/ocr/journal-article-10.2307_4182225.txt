<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rumpelstiltskin's Pleasures: True and False Pleasures in Plato's Philebus* DOROTHEA FREDE Everyone who is moderately familiar with Plato's dialogues will have the impression that pleasure according to Plato is a mixed blessing; often enough he refuses to regard it as a good - let alone the good - for mankind. It is easy to see the reason for this critical attitude: Pleasure (often paired with desire - "hdone kai epithymia" cf. Phdr.273d; Rep. 328d; 429d; 555d; 574a; Gorg.484d et pass.) is what lures the soul away from the straight and narrow path of virtue and entwines it with all sorts of conflicts and confusions. Pleasure is therefore often treated by Plato as a necessary evil; necessary because of our vegetative and material needs (cf. Tim.62-64; Rep.581e), an evil because it opens the soul to all sorts of dangerous and uncontrollable desires (I may merely refer to the unruly horse in Phdr.253c-255a, the anarchy of desires in the Rep.438dff; 562aff; 58le, and the discussion of the mortal part of the human soul at the beginning of the Phdo.64cff). I. The elusive nature ofpleasure But while it is clear why Plato holds pleasure in such low esteem it remains unclear what, precisely, he takes the nature of pleasure to be.' Sometimes it seems that pleasure (and its often neglected counterpart, pain) is just regarded as a function of the body which consists in the satisfaction of * This article is part of a larger project. I am currently working on a manuscript for a book with the title "Plato's Critique of Hedonism", with the main emphasis on the Philebus. Though Gosling/Taylor in their book The Greeks on Pleasure (called G/T from now on) have made great progress in clarifying the history of hedonism, not all issues have been settled or settled in a satisfactory way. 1 On a closer look at the relevant texts the picture is much more bewildering than my summary shows. G/T give a very good and extensive survey. On the problem of adequately rendering Plato's idiom in English, cf. esp. p. 175. Phronesis 1985.

And even when pleasure is expressly attributed to the soul, it is attributed to its lowest, mortal, part. In his often harsh rejection of hedonism Plato (and/or Socrates) reveals an otherworldly ascetism according to which this life is a life in prison and the body is the tomb of the soul (cf. "soma" = "sema" in Gorg.493a; Crat.400c; Phdo.65e-69e; Rep.442a/b). "Not to be born is best," Plato seems to have felt, in agreement with Theognis and other pessimists after him, and the philosopher, so we are told, is well advised to suppress the lowest part of the soul as much as possible while cultivating the spiritual part in a continuous process of purification for this life as well as for life after death (cf. Phdo. 67b; 69b/c and the myths in Gorg. and Rep.). That this picture of Socrates/Plato as an ascetic thinker for whom wisdom and pleasure are incompatible is at least one-sided can be seen in many passages both in earlier and in later dialogues. In the Protagoras, for instance, Socrates himself recommends a kind of "hedonistic calculus" in which virtue functions as the art of measuring pleasure and pain (35 1bff), a position which is nowhere corrected nor even questioned in the rest of the dialogue. In Rep.IX Plato distinguishes between lower and higher pleas- ures, and in the Symposium and Phaedrus the divine origin of philosophical Eros (and its satisfaction, one can suppose) is elevated, and some peda- gogical value is attributed even to what is beautiful to the senses because it leads man to the higher love of the true and the good. How this ambi- valence in Plato's treatment of pleasure can be explained is a much debated question which I cannot go into here.2 The main topic in the Philebus, the rivalry between knowledge and pleasure as candidates for the highest good, appears already in a central passage in the Republic, VI, 505b. As Socrates claims there, both the champion of the "many", namelypleasure, and the champion of the "more refined", knowledge, run into the same difficulty. The hedonists cannot maintain their candidate without a differentiation between good and bad pleasures, while the intellectualists have to admit that only knowledge of the good is good. In both cases the definition is circular and presupposes the definition of the good Socrates, as we all know, professes to be incap- able of giving more than a description of the offspring of the good and resorts to the similes of Sun, Line, and Cave to do so. The Philebus, thus, 2 An extensive discussion of the relevant passages of the Symposium and the Phaedrus will be part of my larger project. 152</page><page sequence="3">raises the very question that was left somewhat in mid-air in the Republic3 and (after a long discussion of the concept of pleasure and its different kinds) comes to the conclusion that neither pleasure nor knowledge deserve the gold medal in the contest about the rank of the highest good: in fact the best kind of knowledge obtains only third place, the best pleasures the fifth, in the final prize-giving (66aff). The Philebus is considered by most interpreters for various reasons to be one of the latest dialogues.4 If the passage in Rep. VI is not a later insertion, Plato must have seen the question of the relationship of both pleasure and knowledge to the good as unfinished business which he could not then deal with. On a closer analysis it turns out that the Philebus in fact picks up many loose ends from different earlier dialogues (and this accounts for the sometimes not immediately clear strategy followed by Plato and the longwindedness of the dialogue lamented by some commentators). That Socrates is back on the scene and his old whimsical self again is then easy to explain, regardless of whether the Philebus is an early-late or a late-late dialogue.5. Unfortunately the Philebus seems to raise more questions than it settles, and not only with respect to the attempt to determine what the nature Of pleasure is, what kinds of pleasures there are, and what criteria for their evaluation should be used. The first part of the dialogue, which is supposed to pave the way towards a better understanding of the complexity of the nature of pleasure by teaching us how to handle the unity and plurality of all kinds of genera and species ("forms"), already presents a major stumb- ling block. There is no consensus among the experts about the meaning of the two most relevant passages, 14c- 19c and 23b-28a, nor about their 3The passage in Rep.V, 505b5-d3 may very well be a later insertion since it does not contribute anything to the topic discussed before and after, i.e. that everyone in the case of the good wants what really is good rather than what appears to be good for himself. If it is a later addition then it points forward to the Philebus, since Rep.IX does not take up that issue. 4 This has been questioned by Waterfield (1), pp. 237-9, and I am inclined to agree with him. The Philebus obviously straightens out unclarities in Rep.IX and is closely related to the Symposium and its "Heraclitean" doctrine, so that one might feel tempted to regard the Phil. together with the Tim. as an earlier late dialogue than other scholars do. There is, of course, the possibility that Plato "shelved" problems for a long time without losing track of them. 5 I cannot share Waterfield's verdict that the Philebus is a "bad example of the earlier dialogue form" (I) p. 271/2. 1 think that the dialogue is carefully staged, the partners portrayed in a vivid enough way. The reader just gets lost in the many difficult passages and loses the perspective of the dialogue as a whole. 153</page><page sequence="4">connection, nor about the use which Plato later makes of the new dialec- tical method. The commentary by J.C.B. Gosling (1975) does not offer any final solutions but displays a battlefield of differing opinions.6 I refrain from entering that battle here but try to find my way around it by simply giving an indication of how, according to my interpretation, the dialogue is staged as a whole.7 Socrates contends that knowledge, understanding, etc., are the highest good, while Protarchus, his usually open-minded, cooperative, if at times slow, opponent, defends the position held by his friend, the beautiful but lazy and blas6 Philebus, that pleasure of all sorts deserves the first place. Socrates' demand for a differentiation and qualification of these global claims starts the whole discussion. At first Protarchus does not want to admit the necessity for any differentiation with respect to the goodness of pleasure (12d/e); this is the reason why Socrates points out the problem of the unity and plurality of such widely and variously used concepts as pleasure and knowledge and recommends a new kind of dialectical method (15dff.). As it seems, however, no use is made of this method; instead Socrates resorts to a fourfold division of "all things" that also seems to be new (23cff.). Again, the experts do not agree on the meaning and use of this division. For our purposes here it is sufficient to know that all things are supposed to fall under four headings, i.e. (a) into the category of peras, limit, measure or number; (b) the category of apeiron, what is unlimited, indeterminate; (c) the successful mixture of (a) and (b); and (d) the cause of that mixture, the underlying or active rational principle (26e).8 Even though this summary must seem cloudy to anyone but the most ardent admirers of the Philebus, it is not difficult to guess into what categories pleasure and knowledge must fall, namely pleasure into the unlimited (which seems fine to Philebus who is interested in the more and more) and knowledge into the causes of good mixtures. What interests us here are just the basic assumptions on which the further determination of the nature of pleasure is based. Pleasure and pain, while themselves indeterminate, occur (phainesthon, 3lb/c) in connection with the third kind of entities, the right mixtures, such as health and 6 Cf. esp. Gosling (3) pp. 144ff; 185ff; cf. also p. 81f. 7 Though I do not hold the view that the "dialectical pan" is only loosely connected with the rest of the dialogue, the question of truth and falsity does not depend directly on the reading of those passages. 8 In spite of the criticism by Gosling (3) (pp. 163-165; 191-196), I generally agree with Striker that while in 14c-19c Plato tries to work out what a genus ("form") is, the passage 23b-28a explains what kinds of genera of onta there are. 154</page><page sequence="5">harmony (3 lb/c). Such harmonious mixtures can be disturbed - and this is the point where pleasures and pains come in: pain consists in the disturb- ance, pleasure in the restoration of such a harmony. This definition is accepted by Protarchus without demur after Socrates explains it by an example of the most ordinary kind: hunger and thirst are processes of "emptying", of disruption or destruction, while eating and drinking are the corresponding processes of "refilling" or restoration (3le/32a). Plato sometimes uses other expressions as synonyms (such as "lysis" or "diacrisis" 32d/e) but most of the time he sticks to the "filling" metaphor.9 To the modem reader this theory must seem strange as soon as he turns away from the obvious classical examples of hunger and thirst. For a better understanding we have to take a look at the development of the notion of pleasure in some of Plato's earlier dialogues. This will show at the same time how the criteria for the evaluation of pleasure evolved. In the Protagoras Socrates makes no attempt to define pleasure at all; agreement about its nature seems to be presupposed, and Socrates, in a rather un-Socratic way, brushes aside Protagoras' attempt to argue for the qualification that only decent pleasures are to be regarded as good (35 1c). The only differentiation between different kinds of pleasures is the amount of pleasure achieved (356b), and virtue becomes nothing but the art of measuring the size of pleasure and pain. What kind of measuring it should be is deferred to 'elsewhere' (357b). It is a matter of debate (from which we have to abstain here) why Socrates professes such an unmitigated hedon- istic position without even positing the Socratic question about its nature.10 9 The "filling" denotes rather the natural process than an intentional act. Gosling (3) is right in pointing out that Plato here is not so much concerned with conceptual analysis as with the characterization of the conditions of the occurrence of pleasures (p. 75). (The conceptual analysis does become important in connection with the "true and false pleasures" later). I do not agree, however, with Gosling that Plato does not give us an account of the nature of pleasure in the Philebus. The problem is that there are as many different kinds of pleasures as there are kinds offillings. Socrates rightly warned us of the multiplicity of the kinds of pleasures (cf. 12c/d). I suspect that this is the reason why the new dialectic is not applicable in the case of pleasure (cf. 20c). 10 I am not persuaded by any of the arguments I have seen that Socrates or Plato who were so critical of the pleasures cherished by their contemporaries ever subscribed to an unconditional hedonistic position. In this connection I side rather with Zeyl, as against Taylor, Irwin (2), and G/T. From very early on Plato insists that there is a distinction between what is liked and what is good, as witnessed by the Lysis (where we already have the distinction between what is good, bad and neither good nor bad - and the intended but not accomplished solution is that it is the "in between" that is friend of what is good, cf. 218bff) and the Euthyphro where the upshot of the argument is that the hosion is not just what the gods happen to like (take pleasure in) but what is worth liking. 155</page><page sequence="6">The first attempt to come to grips with the nature of pleasure is to be found in the Gorgias. The need for something like a definition arises in connection with the question of what advantages Callicles' strong man (who in his natural superiority justifiably commits injustice in the con- ventional sense) can derive from his way of life (49 leff). Callicles, who had declared earlier that he would not pay lip-service to conventional morality and thereby get into Socrates' traps as Gorgias and Polus before him, does indeed speak with almost brutal frankness: the strong man can fulfil every one of his desires, revel in all sorts of dissipations, take all liberties imaginable (492c), in short, he can live a life of excesses. As he phrases it, "That is what living pleasantly consists in, that as much pleasure as pos- sible flows in (494b)!" And in the pursuit of the satisfaction of his desires he will not be impeded by considerations of other people's property or even their lives.11 Socrates, it should be noted, does not object to the determination of pleasure as the fulfilling of desire itself; his objection is just that such a life-style is comparable to the labours of Sisyphus, it is like filling a jar without bottom with a sieve, always driven by ever new needs and desires and hunting for their fulfilment (493a/b). Worse, Callicles also has to admit such pleasures as the scratching when one itches and all sorts of little ticklish perverted pleasures a pederast may dream of (Socrates: "only on the head?" 494el) - at which point even Callicles' unconventional feeling of decency makes him protest: "you are disgusting, Socrates" (494e). More important than the scruples of the unscrupulous is Socrates' serious objection that all Calliclean pleasures are connected withpain since desire necessarily implies pain. Eating-when-one-is-hungry is a pleasure mixed with pain, lypoumenon chairein (496e5), and when satiety has been reached both pain and pleasure have disappeared. Hence Callicles' strong man exhausts himself in the pursuit of ever renewed painful pleasures. I cannot go into the details of Socrates' refutation of Callicles' concep- tion of the goodness of the strong man's life.12 What is important for us is that it is the filling of a lack itself that is called pleasure and not an accompanying or resulting feeling as one might have supposed.13 It is eating-when-one-is-hungry, the activity itself, that is the pleasure, and as soon as the hunger is gone the pleasure is gone also. (In fact, as we all know, For a further elucidation of the problems contained in these passages in the Gorg. cf. Irwin (2) notes p. 195ff. 12 Cf. Irwin (2) pp. 196/7; 204/5; cf. G/T pp. 178ff. 13 On the omission of any terminology offeeling in connection with the elucidation of the nature of pleasure cf. Gosling (3) p. 75. 156</page><page sequence="7">eating when one is not hungry can be a pain.) Socrates does not go into any further discussion of the question of more complex pleasures, nor does he ask whether all pleasures are of this kind or how soul and body cooperate in this kind of "'filling".14 What is clear, however, is that already the simple case of the replenishment of a physiological need such as hunger is a complex process which is not adequately interpreted by Irwin in his commentary of the Gorgias (p. 202) as "I enjoy in one part and feel pain in another." There are no separate parts here, for pleasure and pain are inseparably entwined. In the final argument Callicles is brought to the concession that one must distinguish between different kinds of pleasures, better and worse ones (499b). For not only are Calliclean pleasures mixed with pain and include disreputable ones like the pleasure of scratching, but moral evaluations come in too. For Callicles has to concede that children, fools and cowards have their own pleasures, just as much as his grandiose strong man (497eff). As a consequence of this Callicles has also to admit that there is some kind of expertise in our choice of pleasures, an expertise, moreover, which is comparable to medicine, i.e. a real techne, not to a knack like coolking (cf. 501 a). Only knowledge guarantees success even for the hedonist. The necessity of a combination of pleasure and knowledge is not further worked out in the Gorgias nor are criteria for the moral evaluation of pleasures and pains introduced. It is clear that Plato must have regarded this state of the discussion as unsatisfactory and in need of further development. In Republic, IX, 180dff no rivalry between pleasure and knowledge is at stake; Plato rather attributes to each part of the soul its own kind of pleasure (580d) and lets Socrates convince his audience that the philo- sophers' pleasures and lives in general are not only the best but also the most pleasant (583a: hedy). That Plato here feels obliged to introduce a kind of 'philosophic hedonism' is not surprising if one remembers what purpose the arguments in Book IX are supposed to serve, namely to fulfil Socrates' promise to show that justice in and by itself is a beneficial possession for the soul of its possessor and that it guarantees his happiness. This has, in principle, already been achieved in Book IV, where justice was described as health and harmony of the soul, while injustice was seen as its sickness and disharmony. Pleasure, however, has not been mentioned in that connection and Plato seems to have felt the need to demonstrate the 14 Plato evidently does not take the gourmet's pleasures into consideration. Concerning the question of the connection between pleasure and perception cf. G/T p. 178ff. 157</page><page sequence="8">superiority of the highest kind of virtue even on the hedonist's own ground. Of the three arguments in Book IX only the third one (583b-587a) is relevant to this discussion. It is emphasized by Socrates that it is the most important one and he claims to have got it from "one of the wise men" (583b5). The doctrine that Socrates professes here in a way prepares us for what we find in the Philebus. That the passage at 583b-586c throws some light on the problem of truth and falsity of pleasure and pain in the Philebus has, of course, been seen by some of the commentators,'5 and Gosling/Taylor have devoted a whole chapter to it (cf. p. 97-128). Since I do not always agree with what others have said about it I want to indicate briefly what seems to me most relevant. Plato does not only differentiate between different kinds of pleasures for the different parts of the soul: he also introduces criteria for their evaluation, some of which reappear in the Philebus, i.e. that the lower kinds of pleasures are not really true (oude panaleths) or pure (oude kathara) but shadow-painted (eskiagraphemene, 583c).16 A little later it is also mentioned that they are mixed, and further epithets are introduced such as genuine (gnesion, 587b/c) and stable (be- baion,586a6). What Plato means by those epithets and how they differ from one another is far from clear, but we can draw some conclusions about this when we look at the way the nature of pleasure is depicted by Plato. The passage in Book IX consists of three parts, in which Plato uses different though related definitions of pleasure; as can easily be seen, the definitions refer only to different aspects and supplement, rather than supplant, one another. In the first part of the text (583c-585a) Socrates counters the opinion that pleasure is only liberation from pain (584b/c) by pointing out that there are really three states of the soul, namely pleasure, pain, and the neutral state of rest. Since both pleasure and pains are motions neither can be identical with rest. On the basis of this distinction Socrates can rule out the paradox (he calls it "trickery" - goeteia 584a 1O) that pleasure is merely the end of pain, and pain the end of pleasure. Since Socrates thinks that Glaucon needs such enlightenment ("so that you will no longer think that .. .") and the argument is mentioned again in the Philebus (44c, also with "trickery"), it must have been a position and conception that someone actually used. We do not have to go far to see 15 The connection was first discussed by Murphy; cf. also Waterfield (1) p. 297f. 16 Another important feature that Book IX has in common with the Philebus is the theme of the comparison of different life-styles. While in Rep. IX the philosopher wins even on the hedonist's count, a wedge is driven in the Philebus between knowledge and pleasure. What is still maintained in the Philebus is that the good person is more successful than an inferior one. 158</page><page sequence="9">what its basis is: the Calliclean pleasures presuppose such a circular motion where pain is resolved into pleasure and pleasure into pain. The definition of pleasure and pain as motion is introduced en passant and not further discussed here. The distinction between rest on the one side and pleasure and pain on the other allows Socrates to determine which pleasures are true andpure as opposed to those that are mere "shadow-paintings". What precisely does he mean by "true" and "pure"? On a closer look it turns out that he uses them in three different ways, depending on the aspect and explanation of the nature of the pleasures and pains in question. (1) In the argument that establishes the difference between true pleasure and liberation from pain (583c-585a) he metaphorically describes true pleasures, which start from the neutral stage, as a motion that is going truly "upward", while those that start with pain and end with the achievement of rest come from "below" (584d). He claims that they are regarded as pleasures because the soul from inexperience confuses what merely seems to be "up" with what truly is. The metaphor of the upward and downward movements and the epithet "shadowlike" remind us of the simile of the Cave and are very probably meant to do so. One cannot tell from the text whether the so-called pleasures according to Plato are simply not to be regarded as pleasures - as false friends are no friends at all.17 Plato gives somewhat conflicting messages with regard to this point. On the one hand the motion from below (liberation from pain) is treated like a pseudo- pleasure and the motion from the true above to the state of rest (end of pleasure) as a pseudo-pain (584d/e); on the other hand he also claims that they are not "pure" (584cl) - which seems to suggest that he does regard them as pleasures albeit impure ones. Even the eidola and shadows are somewhat like what they are shadows of. (2) A different sense of "true" and "pure" is used in the following part of the argument in Rep.IX (585a8-586c5) where Socrates drops the term "motion" and uses "'filling" instead (without any mention of a shift). A closer look at the text shows that it should be understood against the background of a special physiological theory - "if to be filled with what is akin to nature is pleasure (585d 1)". The reason for the shift in his ter- minology from motion to filling is, it seems to me, that in the present 17 If this were so a large group of ordinary everyday pleasures would be ruled out, i.e. all those where there is mere restoration as in hunger and thirst. Since this question is treated again, more extensively, in the Philebus Plato seems to have seen there at least an ambiguity that needed to be removed. On this issue cf. G/T p. 106ff, "modifications of the basic picture". 159</page><page sequence="10">passage it is no longer the direction, the up and down, that matters but the object of pleasure, i.e. what the person is filled with. And such filling, as Plato expresses himself, is "truer" the "more real" its object is (595b9/ 10). At this point obviously the "degrees of reality theory" comes in, as it has been established in Sun, Line and Cave, i.e. that a higher degree of being implies a higher degree of truth. So we are now told that "the more being (ousia) obtains, the more truth there is and the more filling with what is more truly" - and that only knowledge can bring that about.18 Plato does not, at this point, declare the pleasures of the lower parts of the soul to be false, but he winds himself through almost untranslatable formulations with the help of comparative constructions: "that which is more really filled with real things would more really and truly cause us to enjoy a true pleasure, while that which partakes of the less truly existent would be less trustworthy and less true pleasure"(585e). In this sense of "true" none of the pleasures that involve sense-perception are fully "true", not even pure smells that do not start with pain, i.e. which were "true" in sense (1). (3) The last paragraph (586b7-587a5) introduces yet another sense in which the lower kinds of pleasures are not "true": they are mixed with pain (memeigmenais lypais: 586b7 - truth is mentioned in this section at 586d/ e). Much of what Plato says here would suggest that he has reverted to the first kind since he calls them eidola of true pleasures, but it is clear that he does not have mere liberation from pain in mind. For in the mixtures he mentions here, the pain actually intensifies the pleasure and is described as an 'active', violent state in the soul, no mere emptiness as in hunger and thirst, but wrath, envy, ambition or greed (cf. 586c/d). Socrates is here not suggesting that these pleasures are not pleasures, in spite of the use of " eid3la" and "eskiagraphemenai" (586b8). They are "as true as they can be and truest if they follow the right principle" (586d/e). From what I have indicated it should be clear that the problems and unclarities and possible inconsistencies are due to the fact that the concept of true and false pleasures in Rep. IX is tied to the "degrees of reality" theory and needed revision when Plato revised that, together with a rev- ision of the meaning of the criteria "true", "pure", etc. What remains open is whether Plato noticed at the time that he used "true" in three different ways, namely as in (1), what really is a pleasure and not merely liberation 18 G/T have claimed that there is a "fatal ambiguity" which rests on the conflation of replenishment and repletion (cf. pp. 122ff): "In the Republic Plato shows no signs of seeing this ambiguity". I think that replenishment but not repletion would be the pleas- ure, i.e. motion but not its end. The end, rest, is seen as the desired good but what is enjoyed is the motion towards it, i.e. eating. 160</page><page sequence="11">from pain, (2) pure (in what it consists in) and (3) unmixed with pain. Whether he did or only realized it later, the Philebus clearly shows that Plato saw this as a loose end which needed to be tied up.19 What seems to be missing in Rep. IX is the propositional sense of "true". We can claim this, of course, only e silentio; but there is no indication that even the truth of the pleasures of the mind is considered under any other than the three aspects listed above. The Philebus thus breaks fresh ground. II. The physiology ofpleasure in the Philebus. It has not been denied in the recent literature that Plato makes a fresh start in the Philebus by working out the conceptions of pleasure and pain, that he introduces the aforementioned division intoperas, apeiron, mixture and cause for this purpose, and also tries to clarify the distinctions between the different kinds of pleasures and the criteria for their evaluation. But as to what, precisely, is to be regarded as the result of these clarifications the experts have not reached any agreement. This is especially true for the question of the notion of true and false pleasures. One reproach against Plato's treatment of this issue which has been raised time and again is that he works with an ambiguous concept of truth and that this leads to a not always clear and coherent theory. As Gosling expresses it, "it seems impossible to acquit Plato of the charge of rank equivocation" (Gosling (3) p. 212). Against this claim I want to maintain (without being able to discuss all the relevant questions here) that at least in the Philebus Plato is fully aware of the equivocation but distinguishes carefully between the different meanings and even indicates it terminologically.20 The long part in the middle of the Philebus (3lb-53c) falls into the following sections: (a) a 19 On the true and5 and the criterion for true pleasures cf. G/T pp. 320ff. Cf. "that in fact only the best man has any real pleasures" (325). It seems indeed as if only those who are nourished by the forms have real/true pleasures. For agnoia and aphrosyn? are kenotites (585b4). If only those pleasures are really good that fulfil all three conditions there is an "overkill effect" in Rep. IX, i.e. we have a very austere hedonistic position. I am not sure, however, how strongly this is meant by Plato. 20 Cf. 41a7 kat'allon tropon ..., where he is dealing with the estimated amount of pleasure; since this was a topic dealt with already in the Protagoras, a simple conflation with the "propositional" kind of falsity is very unlikely. Cf. also the third kind 42c5: pseudeis eti mallon . . . - these are "even falser" (as pleasures, not propositions), because they are not pleasures at all but liberations from pain. Waterfield points out rightly that Plato distinguished between the "true" of logical theory and colloquial usages of true - (I) p. 22. 161</page><page sequence="12">"physiology"21 of pleasure and pain (3 lb-36c); (b) truth and falsity of pleasure and pain in a propositional sense (36c41b); (c) partly true and false pleasures in the sense of "overrated" in degree (41b-42c); (d) plea- sures confused with the state of rest (42c-44d); (e) pleasures intrinsically mixed with pain (44d-50e); (f) pure and impure objects of pleasure and pain (50e-53c). Of these sections only (a) and (b) contain new doctrine; (d), (e),(f) correspond to what is said in (1), (3), (2) in Rep. IX, while (c) refers us back to the "art of measuring pain and pleasure" in the Protagoras. I have to confine myself here to points (a) and (b) and will just try to work out in what sense and on what basis Plato ascribes propositional character to certain kinds of pleasure and can, therefore, attribute truth and falsity in the literal sense to them. The question of the nature of pleasure is approached in a rather circumspect way and dealt with on a larger scale than in any of the earlier dialogues; the strategy Plato follows and the purpose of the distinctions made are not always clear and have puzzled modem commentators. This is partly due to revisions of older doctrine concerning the nature of pleasure (to which most commentators have not paid sufficient attention)22 but most of all to the almost surreptitious way in which Socrates paves the way to the "propositional" pleasures that Protarchus finds so hard to accept.23 What is at first sight surprising is that Socrates in this part introduces only two kinds of pleasures, (1) what I suggest we call the "immediate pleasures" of filling and emptying of the body (32b), and (2) the expectation of such fillings. This limitation is surprising, not only because later on in the dialogue we find other kinds of pleasures but also because Socrates presents the type (2) pleasures as representative of all kinds of pleasures since they are pure and unmixed with pain (32c) and can therefore be used as the basis for answering the question whether the whole genus of pleasure is a good as such or whether goodness is just a contingent property of some of them.24 21 "Physiology" is meant in the original sense and includes psychological features. 22 That the doctrine is new is indicated by the fact that Socrates almost dictates how the terms are to be understood: cf. tithometha (32b6); tithei (b9). 23 What adds to the impression of disorganization is the insertion of the passage on the "most divine" state of rest in 32e-33c2. I cannot discuss the change of position that it shows in comparison with Rep. IX nor the purpose it serves in the Philebus. There are three states mentioned that are in between or beside pleasure and pain: a divine motionlessness, as in this section, an intermediary human life (42a-43c), and the state between pleasure and pain discussed in 35ef. 24 In which sense pleasure and pain are not mixed in the pleasures of anticipation is not discussed here. It stands to reason that every expectation is pleasant only if it promises the fulfilment of a lack. 162</page><page sequence="13">Before we can turn to the question of what makes the pleasures of expectation so special we have to look at the definition of the "immediate" pleasures. In the definition that Protarchus accepts Socrates does not confine himself to the "filling" metaphor (cf. 32al) but gives a very wide definition that incorporates the new ontology of peras and apeiron: "When the natural state of a living organism, constituted, as I have maintained, of the unlimited and the limited, is destroyed, that destruction is pain; con- versely, when such organisms return to their own true nature, this reversion is invariably pleasure" (32a/b, Hackforth's translation). This definition in purely physical terms is nowhere questioned in the dialogue; but that even the immediate pleasures are not confined to the body but essentially constituted by the soul becomes apparent when the much more complex phenomenon of the pleasures of expectations of such fillings is unravelled. The somewhat impromptu order of Socrates' expla- nation of the nature and origin of such pleasures indicates that he is introducing new doctrine: all expectation is based on memory, but before this can be discussed sense-perception has to be explained, then the dis- tinction between memory and recollection must be observed, and finally the role of desire in the whole process has to be elucidated (33c-35d). Let us take a closer look at the details of Plato's explanation of how perception, memory and desire bring about pleasures of expectation. The first step is a clarification of what happens in sense-perception (33d-34a): a sense-perception is an affection of both body and soul, a disturbance (seismos) that affects each one individually and together (idion te kai koinon hekatera, 33d). Of those disturbances only those that reach the soul are perceived, i.e. only what the soul experiences counts, even though the primary experience is perceived with and through the body. Socrates does not explicitly say that the immediate pleasures are percep- tions but it is clear that he must have this in mind: perceived disturbances of the natural harmony are pains, perceived restorations are pleasures.25 Memory, so Socrates continues, is the preservation of such perceptions while recollection is the soul's capacity to recapture by itself what it has experienced with the body "as much as possible" (34b), and this does not only apply to perceptions but to all mathemata as well. Why does Plato go into these details? He gives us the reasons himself: it shows what the soul is capable of independently of the body, i.e. that (apart from the primary experience) it possesses an almost complete autonomy. 25 Concerning this point cf. the "mechanics" of the physical pleasures in the Timaeus, 64a-65b. 163</page><page sequence="14">For once the soul has undergone a seismos with the body it can retain that experience or re-experience it in an authentic way all by itself, since even in the primary affection only what touches the soul counts as the experience. We may perhaps want to object that no remembered toothache is as painful as a real one, but Plato would attribute that to incomplete memory or recollection. The more sensitive (and hypochondriac) among us are quite capable of recalling the horror to perfection.26 After this relative autonomy of the soul is established Plato turns to the question of the role that desire plays in the process of the generation and recollection of pleasure. The reason for Socrates' somewhat tortuous description of the desiring person's longings for the state that is opposite to the one he is presently in emerges only gradually. It is obscured by his inconsistent treatment of the notion of "thirst" and "being thirsty". Sometimes thirst is just the "pain of being emptied of fluids" (34e9-1 1; 35b4); then it is called the "desire for the filling with drink" (34d/e; 35al). On reflection it is clear why Plato wavers here. Hunger and thirst, eating and drinking, were the standard examples of pleasures and pains in Plato's earlier dialogues - "to lypoumenon chairein as we found in the Gorgias. Here Plato indicates that thirst is not just painful deprivation but contains a reference to the object the person is deprived of. Thirst in this sense includes memory of the previous experience of fulfilment. Before a person has undergone this kind of experience he would not know what he needs (as some pediatricians nowadays hold, newborn infants cannot distinguish between hunger and stomach-pain); but thirst for the experienced person always contains the desire for the appropriate fulfilment. Why Plato goes through this somewhat painstaking analysis is indicated in the summary in 35d: since it is memory that directs the soul towards what it desires, it is apparent that "it is to the soul that all impulse and desire, and indeed the determining principle of the whole creature belongs" (35d). The emphasis on the autonomy of the soul and the need for a link between the present state of deprivation and future fulfilment are not the only reasons why Plato includes an explanation of the nature of desire in the discussion of the "physiology" of pleasure. That its purpose is more specific and crucial for what follows becomes apparent in the passage that concludes the physiology and leads into the problem of true and false pleasures, 35e-36b. Socrates there asks Protarchus yet another puzzling 26 How soul and body interact in pleasure and pain was not investigated in the Gorgias nor in Rep. IX, where the different kinds of pleasures were merely assigned to the different parts of the soul. 164</page><page sequence="15">question: What happens when a person stands "in the middle between pain and pleasure", i.e. when he is in pain because of the deprivation but remembers the pleasures that would end it and desires them? Is this state as a whole a state of distress or of pleasure (35e/36a)? Protarchus answers that the person would be in twofold pain: in addition to the pathos on account of the body there would be "pain of the soul in desire for a (positive) expectation".27 Socrates' reply shows what is crucial in the role he assigns to desire: desire originates from a pain but does not itself constitute a pain. A further, second, pain only arises when the soul realizes that there is no hope for a fulfilment. The pain would be counterbalanced, however, if the soul had a clear hope that there was going to be a fulfilment (36a-b). What is the reason for this distinction between single or twofold pain and assuagement by positive expectation? Plato, so I want to suggest, takes this trouble in order to put the dif- ference between desire and hope into full relief. Both are related to the future and have the same object: that there will be fulfilment, that I will get what I need. To the unskilled "desiring that ... ." and "hoping that ... ." may almost seem to amount to the same thing. This Plato denies: hope, in the sense of "clear expectation", is a pleasure and can actively interfere with a present state of pain, while desire cannot. The distinction between immediate pleasure which is an aisthesis, desire, and hope seems to be new in the Philebus; in the Theaetetus pleasures, pains, desires and fears are all listed under the title of "aisthesis" (1 56b).28 With respect to the pleasures of hope Socrates raises the question whether they can be true or false. III. True andfalse pleasures in the propositional sense. That the discussion which follows the distinction between desire and hope is supposed to contain the central question in this part of the dialogue is indicated not only by the careful preparation in the "physiology" but also by dramatic means. Protarchus, who up to this point has followed Socrates' argumentation willingly, refuses to accept the distinction: how could pleasures be false (36b)? And he is not dissuaded when Socrates sugges- tively lines up pleasures and pains with fears, opinions and expectations. 27 The awkwardness of Protarchus' answer shows that he has not yet mastered the tools that Socrates' analysis provides, 36a: kata de tOn psychPn prosdokias tini poth. 28 Not too much should be made of the enumeration in Theaet. however, since Plato already in Rep.IX distinguishes different kinds of pleasure (not all of which would be aistheseis as, e.g., the pleasures of the mind). It is still significant that epithymia is classified as an aisthesis. 165</page><page sequence="16">Only opinions can be true or false, claims Protarchus. To convince him of "false pleasures" Socrates works out a rather careful analogy between opinion (doxa) and pleasure. After conceding to Protarchus, at least for the time being,29 that there can indeed be no doubt about whether one ex- periences pleasure or not, he suggests a distinction between the mental activity, i.e. the opining or being pleased, and the object of the activity, i.e. what the opining or being pleased is all about. In both cases it is clear that whether or not one jusifiably (orthos) opines or is pleased, one really (ontos) has an opinion or is pleased. But should, nevertheless, only opinions be true or false while pleasure does not admit any qualifications (37b)? Since they had been classified as apeira, as indeterminate, pleasures admit at least of degrees, of more or less, as was settled earlier. Should they not also admit positive and negative qualifications (37d)?30 In the case of opinions the "positive" consists in their truth, for if an opinion goes wrong it misses its object and cannot be regarded as right or as opining rightly. The analogue, so Socrates suggests, should hold for pleasures and pains. If they go wrong one cannot call them right or proper or useful.31 At this point Socrates, so it seems at least at first, commits a fatal mistake. Instead of continuing to stick to the analogy he supplies Protarchus with the decisive cue: do not pleasures often "go along" with false opinions (37e)? Protarchus readily snatches the cue: this is precisely it, the opinion is true or false but not the pleasure! Every interpreter must ask himself (and most actually have) why Socrates ruins his own analogy and does not claim that at least in a derivative sense one can maintain a distinction between true and false pleasures.32 This would seem sufficient at least for his main purpose, i.e. to 29 Whether this is meant seriously by Socrates or is just adopted for the moment has been questioned by Gosling, Kenny, and Penner. The reference to the possibility, discussed later, that a false pleasure may be something that is no pleasure at all, is invalid because the antihedonist's position is different; the dyschereis do not acknowledge any pleasures. 30 As mentioned earlier, the differentiation by degree is introduced in the Protagoras (356cfl) in the "art of measuring pleasure and pain", and the distinction between better and worse pleasures is (reluctantly) accepted by Callicles in the Gorgias (499b). But nothing further is said about these distinctions. 31 The frequent repetition of "ge" shows a certain defensiveness and cautiousness on Socrates' side (cf. 37a9; a12; b3; c4; c8; d2; el; e8; elO). 32 In 42a 10 Socrates refers back to the relationship between pleasure and doxa, using the expression "anepimplasan ": "the true and false beliefs fill the pains and pleasures with their predicament". Gosling ((I) p. 48; 53) and Kenny (p. 48) translate it by "infect", but that might be too weak because this may just mean that that they have an impact while a merger seems rather to be what Plato has in mind. 166</page><page sequence="17">establish that pleasure is not a good as such. For only a fool would readily enjoy what is not the case. If Socrates undermines his own analogy this must indicate that he himself is not satisfied with it but wants to establish the truth or falsity of pleasure in the primary sense. He attempts to do so in the lengthy argument which is the center of criticism of present-day scholars (38a-4 1a). I will just try to indicate what I see as its crucial points. At first Socrates seems only to elaborate further on the analogy between opinion on the one side, pleasure and pain on the other, in order to show how opinions come about, namely from sense-perception and memory when the soul in a kind of dialogue with itself or with someone else comes to an agreement about something (38cff).33 The soul thus receives logoi which it retains so that they are written into it as into a book and, if they are written in the appropriate form, the logoi can be true or false. Besides the scribe in the soul, there supposedly is also a painter at work painting pictures that correspond to the logoi; and these pictures are also capable of being true or false (39b/c). So far nothing has been said about pleasures and pains, but at this point they are drawn in and the whole argument is quickly brought to its end. The first step is that logoi and paintings can be about what lies in the future. As admitted earlier, the soul can entertain pleasures and pains through memory all by itself without the body; hence the soul can anticipate future pleasures or pains (39d/c). Furthermore, hopes are logoi or paintings about the future, some of which are true and some false (the god-beloved people are usually right, the wicked wrong).34 Now opinions may really opine but not about what is the case, was the case or will be the case, and the same should apply to pleasures (and pains): they are really pleasures but not about what is, was or will be. What applies to hope (one kind of pleasure) also applies to other emotions such as fear or anger. The end of the argument is reached (4la/b) when Socrates wants to know whether the falseness and the wickedness of a pleasure are one and the same thing. Protarchus emphatically agrees that they are different, hence we are to conclude that there is truth and falsity of pleasure as an acknowledged independent phenomenon. 33 The silent dialogue of the soul refers to the Theaetetus. The elucidation of false pleasures obviously presupposes the discussion of false statements. 34 Gosling (3) p. III sees this as a "moralistic digression." I just want to suggest one very simple explanation (though this may not be all there is to the passage): Protarchus had denied earlier that expectations (prosdokiai) are true or false. The divine backup would guarantee that there is antecedent truth and falsity. About the success of the god-beloved cf. Prot. 345c; Symp. 212a/b; Phdr. 273e; Tim. 53c; Laws 730c. 167</page><page sequence="18">Is Protarchus convinced? One cannot be sure. But it seems that he is at least somewhat restive; for when Socrates suggests that they should look for more false pleasures in a different sense he just replies "if there are any", but goes along with the further investigation, which we will not pursue here (cf. 41b). Let us look at the argument in detail. Many questions remain open and a lot of criticism has been ventured against it. Does the whole argument (suppose we accept if for the moment) apply only to pleasures of anti- cipation? What, precisely, happens in those anticipations? Why are the pictures included, and how are we supposed to understand the example Plato uses of someone who "often sees himself as receiving a lot of gold and great pleasures on account of that. And he sees himself painted as he is terribly pleased with himself' (40a)? The "picturing" has been especially focussed upon by the critics. It has been claimed that Plato confuses the picturing and the picture, and that while one might admit the truth or falsity of the picture, the picturing as such cannot be regarded in that way. Gosling in particular has come back to this point time and again, i.e. that Plato confuses the picture of a pleasure with the pleasure in the picture, that though picturing and picture are coterminous they are, nevertheless, to be distinguished.35 The interpretation which is most sympathetic to Plato's attempt to justify "true and false" pleasures has been ventured by Penner.36 He points out that Plato consciously makes use of the ambiguity of "opining" and "the opined", and "being pleased" and "what one is pleased about", and that Plato does so to establish a mental state that we would call a "propositional attitude". The scribe and the painter according to this interpretation are introduced to fulfil this function in the soul; what is acquired by them is not a momentary thought or pleasure but a proper communicable opinion that can be shared by other people, i.e. a proposition or objective picture. What justifies calling the propositional attitudes pleasures is that not only does the pleasure accompany the belief, i.e. is a pleasure with - but is a pleasure in - the belief, a pleasure taken in the things believed. The reason why Socrates lets his own analogy collapse is that he, as Penner expresses himself (p. 175), "redirects Protarchus in just this way, so that belief ceases to be what it was before, the believing and becomes the thing believed - the 35 Cf. "conflation" Gosling (l) p. 52; (2) p. 43; (3) p. 314; Kenny p. 52; "understandable mistake" Dybikowski p. 164/5; G/T p. 125; 188; 436; 438. 36 Penner somewhat wavers between ascribing to Plato a consistent enlightenment about the propositional character of true and false pleasures and assuming only an implicit understanding (p. 171-3). 168</page><page sequence="19">thing which is written or that which is painted. There is a shift in the meaning of opinion (doxa) from opining (doxazein) to the opined (to doxazomenon) in 39e lO." As far as Plato's own understanding of what he is doing is concerned, Penner suggests that there are three possibilities: (A) Plato does not see the ambiguity, nor the "in" - "with" - contrast, (B) Plato consciously exploits the ambiguity and the breakdown in the analogy is planned, or (C) Plato is unaware of the ambiguity of doxa but has a clear conception of the perceptual or cognitive analogy. Penner himself prefers (C) and claims that Plato with respect to the meaning of "doxa" was unaware of the distinction between doxa as a process and doxa as a product, and that the same applies to the notion of pleasure. As a process-word it signifies "enjoying", while as a product- word it signifies what the pleasure is taken in. Had Plato been fully aware of the ambiguity, so Penner claims, he would have chosen product-beliefs and product-pleasures and have realized that process-beliefs and pleasures are true only by extension. I prefer option (B) and want to claim that not only did Plato not commit the unforgivable sin of confusing the pleasure in the picture with the picture of the pleasure, as Gosling has it, but also that Plato did not commit the forgivable sin of conflating product- and process-word, which is what Penner assumes. There are, indeed, two different senses in which Plato uses doxa: at first in the active sense, i.e. = doxazein ("to opine"), and in this sense the opinion can "make a mistake" (harmartanein, 37aff) and that about which the mistake is made is called the doxazomenon, the "opined". This active sense of doxa = doxazein is maintained up to 38b9 (so far we have had only two things, (a) the active doxa and (b) what it is about; and the same goes for pleasure and what one is pleased about). But when the scribe and the painter are introduced they are taking over the active func- tion that the anthropomorphic doxa had so far, and "doxa" adopts the passive sense and is explicitly equated with the logos (38e). In the scribe and painter simile we have, thus, three things: (a) the author, (b) the writing or painting, and (c) what is written and painted, the subject matter (cf. esp. 39a).37 As I want to claim, (c) is what Plato sees as constituting the true or false pleasure in the primary sense, while (b) the writing or painting, 37 The minute description of the origin of the logos thus finds a natural explanation: the (passive) opinion, i.e. the product, has an independent existence and its truth and falsity Ire investigated here, not the "veracity" of the scribe or painter. 169</page><page sequence="20">though no doubt pleasant too, is true or false only in the derivative sense of "erring", writing or painting faultily. Since Penner did not pay sufficient attention to the fact that Plato quite deliberately and conspicuously dis- tinguishes between these three factors involved in the case of false opinions and pictures, he is not really able to reject whole-heartedly the reproach of confusion ventured by Gosling et al. but maintains only that as they present it, it is "disproportionate" (p. 177). What Penner and others seem not to have realized is why Plato in his argument focusses on hope as the crucial kind of pleasure. At first one would think that hope is not a particularly good example by which to demonstrate the truth or falsity of pleasure. For, granted that there is something pleasurable about hopes, they are often very vague, and while we do speak of false hopes we may not want to speak of true ones without further justification.38 I may hope that I will pass an exam but not yet expect that I will do so. But we should note here that Plato does not speak of any kind of hope but of those where there is definite expectation that they will be fulfilled, en elpidi phanera tou plertthiesesthai (36a/b). So Plato is not concerned with cases where the outcome is seen as a mere possibility, but with cases where certainty is assumed and what is written and pictured in the grammata or eikones are definite facts. That this is the salient point in Plato's argument is indicated when he tells us what the hopes in question are. They are called logoi: "there are logoi in each one of us which we call hopes" (40a6) - and, so one has to add, if they have the appropriate form they can be regarded as what we would call propositions and can, therefore, be true or false. What is presupposed here is, then, a definite commitment on the speak- er's (or scribe's or painter's) side, i.e. to the description of the pleasure. Only when I definitely expect "that I will pass the exam" can the anticipated pleasure be regarded as true or false. But if Plato was concerned only with definite expectations, why did he not stick to the expression "prosdokia" rather than "elpis", the sceptical reader might ask at this point. I think the explanation is simple. Prosdokiai can be pleasant or unpleasant and the addition of this qualification would give Protarchus opportunity to raise the same objection as he did earlier: that there are really two things, the expectation plus the pleasure or displeasure. "Hope" allows us to regard it as a unitary phenomenon. Is this interpretation borne out by the text? Plato's own example is difficult to evaluate since it is not prima facie clear 38 Protarchus has earlier rejected the possibility of true and false fears and expectations. So Socrates now has to argue that we in fact often do regard our expectations as certain. 170</page><page sequence="21">what, precisely, are the pleasures of the man who sees the painted illusions of possessing a lot of gold and many pleasures on account of that (40a). A lot hinges on the evaluation of the example, and different interpreters have read it in different ways. I therefore want to suggest a different example, where logoi are clearly implied, namely that of Rumpelstiltskin in the Grimm Tale. IV. Rumpelstiltskin's Pleasures Many a child has been amused by Rumpelstiltskin's triumph-song and remembers that by chanting it out loud Rumpelstiltskin committed a fatal mistake: To-day I bake; tomorrow I brew my beer; The next day I will bring the Queen's child here; Ah, lucky 'tis that not a soul doth know That Rumpelstiltskin is my name, ho! ho! Rumpelstiltskin, I take it, does not just entertain daydreams - he is taking it for granted that the Queen will not know his name, and that he will get the child. Not all hopes are of that assertive kind, some of them are very vague indeed, but Plato speaks of "clear hopes that it will be fulfilled". (The Greek future indicative is even more committal than the English).39 We have thus to distinguish between mere hopes and clear hopes. Since in discussions this distinction has created some confusion I just want to cite an example that shows how untidy our everyday language often is and what I mean by "mere hope". In a statement quoted in the New York Times (Nov. 28, 1984, B7) the surgeon DeVries said about the recovery of the patient who received an artificial heart: "We hope he can go home before Christmas, but I think that is probably very, very unrealistic". To return to Rumpelstiltskin. We have to ask ourselves, of course, what, precisely, Rumpelstiltskin does enjoy. Is he not just gloating, as Gosling 39 Gosling (1) p. 49 denied that such committments are what Plato could have in mind. I disagree. His example (1) p. 49, of the excited schoolboy who (falsely) thinks that he enjoys the greasy food he manages to steal from the larder while what he enjoys is the adventure, should be changed; e.g. the schoolboy falsely enjoys "eating up the headmaster's favourite dessert" (falsely, because it is not the favourite dessert or because there is more of it). Kenny thinks that the main point is that of a misclassification (p. 50): that we expect (like King Midas) that something will be pleasant while it will not. This does not go well with Plato's repeated assertion that pleasures in present, past and future are alike in this respect (cf. 40d). 171</page><page sequence="22">thinks about the man in Plato's example, picturing himself in the possession, revelling in it - as sometimes the mere thought of something pleases one or makes one shudder? His pleasures may be called well- founded or ill-founded but not true or false, as the objectors to this theory would retort. To answer the question what Rumpelstiltskin enjoys we would have to ask him whether it is the picture or the logos or whatever, so we cannot be quite sure. We can, however, make hypotheses about his mental state. What kinds of thoughts or pictures must he entertain to meet Plato's standards? We have to take a step back here and look at the "physiology" of pleasure again. A pleasure supposedly is the filling of a lack or restoration of the proper state. The soul can undergo such a process with or without the body; once the soul has experienced something, it can reproduce it all by itself- fill itself with what it lacks. Some such fillings can consist in definite logoi or pictures representing reality. It might at this point be objected with David Hume that reproductions in memory are "less lively and forcible" than the original experience, but Plato, as I said earlier, seems to think otherwise. At any rate, the vividness does not change truth or falsity (but perhaps the degree of pleasure). For Plato it only matters that pleasures are constituted by processes in the soul over which the soul has complete control. And if one reflects on the notion of the "filling", "restoring", etc., it becomes clear why Plato does not conceive of pleasure as an indistinct feeling of euphoria or elation that can arise at any occasion, an epiphe- nomenon, as Protarchus seems to have in mind. For Plato there is in each case of pleasure only one motion in the soul, i.e. the positive reception of what the soul desires. There is not (a) one motion - e.g. Rumpelstiltskin's thought that he will get the Queen's child, and (b) another one accompanying or succeeding the first one, something like an indistinct glow. "Pleasure" is for Plato, then, the name of a large variety of things; in the Philebus, I take it, it designates three classes, namely thoughts, per- ceptions and feelings.40 What all pleasures have in common is merely that they are positive processes, each one determined and qualified by the object enjoyed. More we cannot say before a certain pleasure is specified. Rumpelstiltskin's pleasures may consist in various objectives. He may just feel triumphant in a diffuse way, in which case his words would not be meant as a committal, and there is then no question of truth or falsity. We often do not mean what 40 I have to admit that this claim needs further discussion, especially as far as the notion and status of feeling (love, jealousy etc.) are concerned. 172</page><page sequence="23">we say. Or he may just muster with glee all the possibilities and enjoy talking about them; and talking the talk or picturing the picture is what the pleasure would be all about, and again there would be no truth or falsity implied (though the picturing may be very pleasant). The only way in which Rumpelstiltskin's pleasures can be true or false is when he enjoys what his thought is the thought of and when the thought consists in an assertion aboutfacts (present, past or future). We do make such commit- ments when we talk about pleasures in the present or past. An athlete when asked what he enjoyed most, the winning (when he ran through the finish line), the ceremony afterwards, the party, the girls, etc., might say - "I enjoyed most that I won", where the proposition is what the pleasure is all about. The same may be true in Rumpelstiltskin's case. We do not know why he wanted the Queen's child or what he wanted to do with it. But in order to have true or false pleasures he has to have definite expectations in the propositional form "this is going to be the case . . .", i.e. he must see it as settled. What he hopes for, in other words, must be "will-be's" and not "'maybe's". Besides the pleasures that consist in logoi, Plato also wants to include pleasures that consist in pictures, in visual representations. I think that we should grant him that extension as long as it is clear that what is meant is not the visualizing but the visualized (though the visualizing itself would also be pleasant, just as expecting can be enjoyed as well as the expected). Pleasures taken in what is anticipated are often the most intensive ones and so is the disappointment when they turn out to have been false. Our having been so sure somehow makes it worse.41 This is why. Rumpelstiltskin was seized by such a fury when his hopes where thwarted that he tore himself asunder. It is a commonplace that one should not be pleased too soon: the "false pleasure" seems to aggravate the disappointment. That not hopes of all sorts can be true or false is clear. Rumpelstiltskin must know what he wants and think he is going to get. How does one acquire such knowledge? Plato has explicitly provided the answer to this question. Firstly, in the "'physiology" he describes how the soul experiences a certain commotion and can reproduce it, "re-experience it", all by itself. Secondly, the functions of the scribe and painter in the soul provide the required knowledge/picture. As Plato has it, the scribe does not just jot 41 "Propositional" pleasures must be what in German is meant by "freuen, dass", not "freuen auf". "Vorfreude" does imply a certain amount of confidence but not certainty. It can therefore be disappointed but not falsified. In everyday language the borderlines are not always clear, it has to be admitted. G/T mention "precognition" without clearly explaining why that account should be considered as "extremely implausible" (p. 430). 173</page><page sequence="24">down notes about what happens nor does the painter just take something like snap-shots. What is written into the soul is the result of an often exercised dialogue of the soul with itself or with someone else, when from memory or sense-perceptions opinions or logoi are formed (the silent dialogue reminds us of Theaet. 189c-190a and is presumably meant to do so). The description of the painter's job makes it even more obvious that Plato does not have the simple intake of sense-perception in mind, for the text indicates that the pictures are pictures construed in accordance with the logoi, not photos of the world. The painter operates, as Plato says, when a person abstracts what he previously judged or said from sight or any other form of perception and, as it were, sees in his mind's eye "the images of what was judged and stated (39b/c)". Delight in such pictures may then be a rather complex affair, but this much is clear: that we take such delight only when we regard the picture as true. So far, only true and false hopes about thefuture have been considered. The parable of the scribe and painter suggests, however, that any kind of logos could provide us with pleasure. Furthermore, Plato does claim at the end of the passage that our pleasures also concern what is present or past, and can be false when what we take to be the case is not the case, was not the case, or will not be the case (40d; cf. 39c). I may, e.g., be very delighted when I am told that I have won in the lottery and someone waves a (false) check under my nose - and be almost as furious as Rumpelstiltskin when I find out that it was just an April fool's-day joke. But why, then, does Plato most of the time confine himself to future pleasures? Is it just because, as he says in 40d, most of our hopes are mistaken?42 I think that something more important is at stake and it is strange that this point seems not to have occurred to those of Plato's critics who do not want to accept his "false pleasures" of anticipation. It is this: in the case of things present or past it would have been much harder for Socrates, if not impossible, to persuade Protarchus that pleasures are anything but the direct apprehensions of the things enjoyed. That pleasures are events with propositional content would be hard (and is hard) to explain to anyone who is not trained in philosophy and does not have the appropriate voca- bulary at his disposition. What is special about future pleasures is not that only in their case do we have logoi but that we have only logoi. For what we have in our minds at that time is clearly only a logos, and what we enjoy - if we do not just enjoy the much criticized anticipation in the sense 42 The point would be that in the case of ill-founded and thwarted hopes the fabity in the direct sense would be most easy to pinpoint because a logos is all there is. 174</page><page sequence="25">of picturing - is the anticipated event as it is described or pictured in our minds itself. In addition, in the case of future pleasures it is quite obvious that often there is a wide discrepancy between what is enjoyed "as a fact" and what is in fact going to happen. Plato does not, and need not, confine himself to pleasures of "prognos- tication".43 It is easy to see that in the case of present or past pleasures "truth" and "falsity" in the same sense are possible. We do not have to go into the depiction of gruesome false pleasures like those of poor Thyestes at the fateful dinner, there are more delightful examples: several years ago there was a report in the newspapers that a German tourist had got off the plane en route to San Francisco in Bangor, Maine (where the passengers had to go through customs), thinking he was already in San Francisco. He managed to stay there for two whole weeks thoroughly enjoying himself in "San Francisco" until he found out the truth. Now, he did not "truly" enjoy that he "was in San Francisco", or the "beauty of San Francisco" etc., nor did he enjoy the "little town in Maine"' because he did not know that that was where he was. He might, in fact, have raged and fretted, had he found out the truth earlier. So the pleasure of "having seen San Francisco" was false while he was really enjoying himself thinking that he was in San Francisco. One can make up similar cases for false pleasure about the past, not just past pleasures. Someone may for a long time be immensely pleased and proud about alleged achievements in the past and find out one day that the achievements were not his or did not come about at all and that other people had just made fun of him. To placate the sceptics about true and false pleasures we have to admit that only such pleasures can be true or false where there is a clear and precise proposition or a clear and precise picture of the supposed facts. As stated earlier, many of our "positive expectations" are too vague to qualify. And such vagueness is the reason why we are often quite helpless when something comes true of which we had no clear conception. Someone who unexpectedly wins a million dollars in a lottery may at first be more stunned than pleased while his neighbour would have known what to be pleased about. The reason for this is that the scribe and the painter in the first man's soul have not worked out yet what it means to be rich. All qualifications of a person's pleasures do in fact depend on the quality of 43 The critics of Plato's doctrine about false anticipatory pleasures are faced with the consequence that if only the picturing were at stake the same would have to hold for present and past pleasures, in which case there would always be mere phantasizing, not enjoyment of what is or was. 175</page><page sequence="26">their work. So one may, in Plato's (as well as in Aristotle's)" sense, judge a person's character from his pleasures. They show what the scribe and the painter in his soul have been doing. Are these considerations sufficient to dispel our misgivings about Plato's notion of true and false pleasures? To judge from the critical comments on Plato's theory, in spite of Penner's explanation of the propositional cha- racter of the kind of pleasures in question, it does not seem so.45 What obviously stands foremost in the way are linguistic considerations. We have bcome accustomed to be wary of brushing the fabric of language against the pile. Plato however, seems to have been quite aware of the linguistic and conceptual awkwardness of speaking of true and false pleasures, as can be seen from the way Protarchus rejects various attempts to make it palat- able. Protarchus does not seem here to speak just for the naive everyday hedonist but as if everyone would agree with him (cf. 37e/38a), and I take it that everyone who holds that pleasure and pain are just epiphenomena that accompany ("go with") beliefs, sensations and activities would in fact agree with him. Plato, however, seems to have thought that not just a linguistic change but a revision of the ontology of pleasures should be made; and I see this as one of the main objectives in the Philebus. We have to choose, therefore, between Socrates' and Protarchus' analysis and ontology of pleasure. I cannot enter into a discussion of the advantages or disadvantages of such a revision here, but want to turn to one final point. It would be all very well, the opponents of such a theory will say, if pleasures were just propositions or pictures. They are, however, mental events, and how can mental events be true or false?46 This objection seems to be especially pertinent to an interpretation that claims (as mine does) that for Plato in the Philebus the basic model of pleasure is still that of a "filling". Fillings are, after all, processes and not propositions, even if propositions are involved. "Filling myself with propositions" can at best be 44 Cf. EN lI, 3, 1104b4: "We must take as a sign of character the pleasure or pain that ensues on acts. . .". 45 Gosling (3) and G/T mention Penner's interpretation with approval but insist, nevertheless, that Plato conflates the two cases and in the case of "future pleasures" just means gloating (cf. Gosling (3) p. 216/7; G/T 190; Appendix A p. 429ff.). In the case of Rumpelstiltskin there is certainly also gloating, but in many cases of "future pleasures" no mere malicious phantasizing need be in question. 46 Cf. Waterfield (2) p. 24 who doubts that event and belief are reconcilable; and G/T on the activity of picturing and propositional content p. 435f. 176</page><page sequence="27">understood metaphorically, if at all. So we would be back at square one and faced, once more, with Penner's own misgivings (p. 177). At this point it is important to note that the linguistic awkwardness has a rather harmless reason and that the metaphysical change is not nearly as drastic as it seems at first. For few of our so-called normal pleasures are propositional in the first place. Reading, writing, playing tennis, travelling, making money, engaging in politics, or smelling roses are activities and not true or false but edifying, relaxing, exciting, costly etc. They are immediate pleasures and consist in activities. But are the true and false pleasures of anticipation not also activities? We have to distinguish here between what the activity (and pleasure) consists of and what it consists in. In the case of the pleasures that are only activities, the activity is .at the same time the process and the intentional object of the pleasure. In the case of pro- positional pleasures, however, the filling, i.e. the thinking, believing, is what constitutes the pleasure but is not its intentional object. We have to be precise here: of course, there would be no "being pleased that . . ." if there were no believing, thinking, picturing. But these processes are only the necessary conditions, not what the pleasure is taken in - as it would be if the intentional object were just to "believe that. . .". In the case of Snow- White's evil stepmother we might be justified in saying that "she enjoys believing she is the fairest of all" but she herself does not enjoy the believing but the belief that she is the fairest of all.47 If we review our everyday pleasures we will find that few of our pleasures are of the propositional kind, hence our and Protarchus' initial astonish- ment that there should be false pleasures is quite justified as long as one thinks of examples like wine, woman (man) and song. There can, of course? be "someting wrong" with such pleasures but they are not true or false in the direct or even in an extended sense. Why then does Plato devote so much thought to those cases of false pleasures? One reason may be that they are intellectually most interesting since they concern the logical sense of truth and falsity. But, more importantly, Plato wants to draw our intention to the fact that the beliefs on which certain pleasures are based are part of the intended object, which becomes most obvious in the case of future pleasures where the logos is, after all, all there is. The importance of the description of a pleasure comes to the fore this way. Without the description the pleasure would not be 41 The queen is not at all interested in her mental activity, in her truly or falsely believing, but takes pleasure in her uncontested beauty. 177</page><page sequence="28">what it is, e.g. the evil queen may just admire and enjoy her own beauty, without any thought of Snow-White.48 But that is not all. The awareness of the importance of the description of a pleasure puts certainpsychological and ethical features into relief.49 Some people, e.g., can only enjoy gifts if they know that they are expensive or if someone else is thereby deprived of them. In comedy the ignorance of the true description of an alleged pleasure is often exploited, as Plato points out himself. Sometimes the result of such comic ignorance is tragic, as in Thomas Mann's story "Mario and the Magician" where Mario kisses the ugly old magician under hypnosis, thinking it was his sweet-heart. To be exposed thus in his most secret and sweetest pleasure causes the terrible rage in which he then kills the magician. More important are the ethical consequences involved in "pro- positional" pleasures. While it seems innocuous enough to enjoy the activities of reading, making money, looking at oneself in the mirror, under a certain description these are not innocuous. It is vicious to enjoy '"making the money that belongs to widows and orphans," or for the step-mother to enjoy her beauty "over Snow-White's dead body". Thus, when we evaluate our pleasures we should take into account what their intentional objects are, as given in the descriptions. Enjoying someone else's ruin, enjoying watching someone else make a fool of himself, are morally charged pleas- ures, according to Plato (48ff). That such implicit intended objects that come to the fore when one gives a complete description of a pleasure are more often involved in our everyday pleasures than we want to admit to ourselves is obvious. It is known that people who thoroughly enjoyed a beef-stew in a restaurant later felt nausea when they leamed that dog-food had been served. So there are hidden or implicit propositions contained even in immediate pleasures concerning the objects of the pleasures. It seems, then, that Plato has put his finger on something very important: that certain pleasures are specifiable, identifiable and evaluable only when their propositional content is taken into consideration; the pleasure is therefore not separable from its provenience, as Protarchus had wanted to maintain (cf. 38a; 12d7). This is quite a tum around, for it means that the 48 Even the Queen's simple pleasure in her beauty implies a proposition, upon closer investigation. Gail Fine has plausibly argued for the Theaetetus that ali knowledge, even that of direct acquaintance, implies knowledge of truth (p. 379). One can argue similarly that most pleasures involve at least the identification of the object of pleasure, i.e. a proposition. 49 This has first been discussed by B.A.O. Williams whose article has inspired all the interpretations that have been sympathetic to "propositional" pleasures. 178</page><page sequence="29">pleasure in question (in the relevant sense) is not to be identified with the elation, the ripple that the soul undergoes, but with what the pleasure consists in. The experiencing itself, the beingfalsely pleased, when it refers to the process, is then indeed false in a derivative sense. Plato himself points out what may happen in such a psychological process: the soul, i.e. the "active" doxa, makes a mistake (cf. 37e). What counts for Plato as the pleasure is not the seismos, the elation the soul undergoes, but what the pleasure consists in. This is what Plato, it seems to me, wanted to teach us in the part of the Philebus that was here under discussion: that what counts is what the scribe and the painter have been doing, not what I actuallyfeel at a particular occasion, though, perhaps, strange emotional reactions should make us go back and take a closer look at the the scribe's and painter's work and make revisions, if necessary.50 That pleasures and pains should be subjected to moral evaluation is suggested in earlier dialogues (cf. the "better and worse" pleasures in Gorg. 499b), but only "propositional" pleasures can be analyzed and judged in the same way as opinions and beliefs are. This seems to me to be the achievement of the part of the Philebus that was here under discussion. Centerfor Hellenic Studies, Washington 50 Do I want to maintain that Plato decidedly takes pleasure in the product- rather than in the process-sense all along? I am very hesitant to commit myself to this alternative, not only because Plato did not have an explicit conception of "proposition" in our sense (of which he would say that they are timeless, interpersonal etc.) but also because many pleasures are themselves intentional processes, as "the pleasure that I am getting richer every day". So a clear separation of process and product is not always possible. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES I only enumerate the writings to which I refer in the article.
