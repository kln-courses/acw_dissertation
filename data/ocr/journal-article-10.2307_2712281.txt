<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RESPONSIBLE CENTER: MAN AND NATURE IN PUEBLO AND NAVAHO RITUAL SONGS AND PRAYERS FRANCHOT BALLINGER University College, University of Cincinnati IN HIS ESSAY, AMERICAN INDIAN SONGS," KENNETH REXROTH CONTRASTS the Native American view of man's relationship with nature and the Western European view: the Native American, he says, identifies self and "other," man and nature, while the European sees man as a "permanent factor in a perishing world and the sole source of its value," asserting thus his separate- ness.' What Rexroth does not acknowledge, however, is that in the Native American view man does have a special role in the universal scheme. To speak specifically of the Navaho and the Pueblo, the focal cultures of this essay, man is seen as a creative factor in the eternal circle of the cosmos and as a source of value. Accepting this status, the Navaho and Pueblo clearly have not yielded their destinies to a "beneficent" nature. Rather they attempt to control both the natural and the supernatural.2 From their per- spective, these two realities interpenetrate in the human consciousness; the road through the natural to and from the supernatural is also the human road, a road beginning at the center, man. As one Zuni prayer formula puts it: "You [the Fathers] will pass to us on our roads." Without imposing on them a European humanism, we can see that in Navaho and Pueblo ritual songs and prayers, images of and references to nature show man's centrality in and thus control of the natural and the ' Kenneth Rexroth, "American Indian Songs," in Literature of The American In- dians, Abraham Chapman, cd.

By examining a selection of their ritual songs and prayers, I shall show how the Navaho-Pueblo conception of nature is shaped therein by the human perspective in order to affirm man's own creative control of the universe, a creativity corresponding to that of the natural world itself.3 There are four important limitations to this study. First, it is limited to the Navaho and Pueblo cultures of the American Southwest. Second, the materials, both literature and ideas, treated are traditional materials as re- ported in reliable, ethnographical studies. The reader may find that some of these ideas conflict with those expressed by contemporary Indian spokes- men. There are two factors at work here: the Pueblo and Navaho cultures are by no means dead; they are changing and growing as always, sometimes through loss, sometimes through the gain of outside influences. The most important of such influences, and the second factor, is the "Pan-Indian movement" within which ideas from different Indian cultures become iden- tified as Indian rather than as Navaho or Sioux or Pueblo. The third limita- tion is in the texts of the literature. We are dealing with translations, and until we can verify the English texts available to us, we must place our faith in the skill, intelligence, and imagination of the Bunzels and the Matthews. In brief, then, it would be foolish to attempt a close new critical textual analysis of the songs and prayers. Finally, my use of certain Anglo philoso- phies and psychology are not intended to suggest that Indians "believe" in those ideas. They are used for context and to give a ground in common human experience to cultures that are to most still unfamiliar and exotic. Although the purview of this essay is ethnopoetic analysis rather than the broader anthropological analysis of ethos or world view, it is necessary to clarify some aspects of ritual. Ritual articulates symbolically an attitude toward man, nature, and divinity, and their respective roles and powers; a rite is an enactment of man's beliefs about his obligations and powers within the natural universe.4 Erich Neumann argues that in ritual man "produces in his own soul that same creative process which he finds outside himself in nature. . . . [he finds] within himself the fruitful center . . . which . . is identified with the creative divinity and upon which the continued existence of the world depends. . . . the inner object is not the natural process, but the control of nature through the corresponding element in man."5 Ritual 3 Although I will analyze only a representative selection of songs and prayers from various ritual sources as I develop my theme, this perspective is, I believe, present throughout Navaho and Pueblo ritual, if not always explicitly, then implicitly as part of the ritual's context. 4 Susanne Langer, Philosophy in a New Key (New York: Signet, 1951), 138-39. 5 Erich Neumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness, 2 Vols.

The reader who finds this concept rather too mystical should</page><page sequence="3">92 American Quarterly prepares man to perceive the creative universe creatively and thus to act creatively. Clifford Geertz says, "the notion that life takes on its true import when human actions are tuned to cosmic conditions is widespread."6 We might alter this statement to emphasize that Navaho-Pueblo ritual songs and prayers manifest human life taking on its true import when cosmic condi- tions are tuned to and by human symbolizing, that is, when through ritual man attempts the reordering of the natural state to fit it to the human. Thus, the human perspective given to the nature images and references is not "only [a model] of what they believe but also [a model] for the believing of it." While man is believed the responsible center, this perspective also enacts the belief. By conceiving through ritual an active creative role for himself, man makes himself the responsible center. And as the responsible center man receives the flow of power from the universe. Perhaps more clearly than any other Native American ritualistic literature, Navaho songs and prayers exemplify Neumann's contention that the func- tion of ritual is to find the power in man corresponding to the creative power of the universe. The shaping of nature in Navaho songs and prayers through the human perspective reinforces this correspondence to show man as the responsible center, ordering and controlling. Creative human control is so fundamental to Navaho ritual that the ab- sence of control comes closest of any Navaho ideas to the Anglo concept of "sin" and "evil": what is not controlled by man or what is not susceptible to control by man, being out of order, is evil. Unlike the Anglo, who judges evil by some divine standard, the Navaho judge from a human context. Because the intention of First Man and First Woman was to make condi- tions suitable for Navaho habitation of the world, much Navaho cosmogony accounts for the realities of nature by relating them to man and his activities. However, the Navaho, with their chronic fear of evil, see that this arrange- ment does not negate the need for control. Man has had to discover the means, often under the tutelage of the supernaturals, to manipulate universal forces in order to direct their powers in his favor.7 Among the techniques of creative control is establishing order. A basic symbol of order among the Navaho is the hogan, the traditional dwelling, read Santayana, Interpretations of Poetry and Religion, especially Chapter IX, "A Religion of Disillusion," where the idea is presented in a more rationalistic light.

The fourteenth hogan song from the Blessingway conveys the conven- tional association of order, harmony, and beauty made by the Navaho. It is my hogan where, from the back corners beauty radiates, it radiates from a woman. It is my hogan where, from the rear center beauty radiates, it radiates from a woman. It is my hogan where, from the fireside beauty radiates, it radiates from a woman. It is my hogan where, from its side corners beauty radiates, it radiates from a woman. It is my hogan where, from the doorway on and on beauty radiates, it radiates from a woman, it increases its radius of beauty.8 According to the myth lying behind the Blessingway, the hogan and its surroundings must be put in order whenever the rite is planned. "The songs remind the occupants that orderliness should not cease with the close of the ceremonial and that man's appreciation of orderliness, beauty, regularity should not be confined to the immediate surrounding of his home. They must extend this appreciation to earth and sky, to cardinal points and their phenomena, to all things in the universe." (Wyman, 15) Such beauty and order established in the home and radiating from all points within, from the doorway to natural world without, has its source, the song tells us, in a human. Humanly controlled and creative ordering, particularly through speech, can be seen in the nature references of the following excerpts from Mat- thews' versions of the Mountain Chant and the Night Chant. In the first, the human speaker is the hero-prophet of the myth who has brought the Mountain Chant to men and is about to join the gods (but not as a deity himself). "Farewell, younger brother! From the holy places the gods come for me. You will never see me again; but when the showers pass and thunder peals, 'there,' you will say, 'is the voice of my elder brother,' and when the harvest comes, of the beautiful birds and grasshoppers, you will say 'there is the ordering design of my elder brother.'"' There is a unity with nature here, to be sure, but not one of those mystical unions that result in the de- struction of human identity; rather it is a union of a human creator and his 8 Leland C.

The harvest and the symbols of abundance (birds and grass- hoppers) are the reflections of a human design, the expression of will and control. Moreover, even the thunder symbolizes human control, specifically the uniquely human act of speech. Ritualistically, words are perhaps one of the most important Navaho techniques for establishing control through order: "The 'word' -that is the formation of sounds into organized speech-is of great ritualistic value, and in order to be complete, man must control language, the better his control and the more extensive his know- ledge, the greater his well-being." (Reichard, 34) Prayer works, there- fore, because it is order, human order. Speech as power and control in the natural world is present in this song from the Night Chant also. My great corn-plants, Among them I walk, I speak to them; They hold out their hands [leaves] to me. My great squash vines, Among them I walk. I speak to them: They hold out their hands to me.10 Here human speech manifests and stimulates that part of nature which directly sustains man's well-being, nature domesticated. Just as he has ordered a part of nature through his domestication of corn, so man controls through speech, in this instance, eliciting a friendly response from the corn, as ought to be expected from a nature serving man. Margot Astrov's essay, "The Concept of Motion as the Psychological Leitmotiv of Navaho Life and Literature,9111 suggests ways that nature imagery conveys the correspondence of creative powers in man and nature, a correspondence that man controls in his quest for harmony. As an expression of that correspondence, language, once again, plays an im- portant role as a controlling and ordering technique. Discussing the travel motif in Navaho myth and ritual, Astrov says that in the myths lying behind the curing rituals, "it is the Traveler who, in venturing upon unknown trails, absorbs all those healing powers that are believed to dwell in things simply because they have been encountered in places unfamiliar and far distant . . . the patient is made, ritual-symbolically, the traveler who re- "' Matthews, The Night Chant, A Navaho Ceremony, Vol. 6 (New York: Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History, May 1902), 293. 11 Journal of American Folklore, 63, No. 247 (Jan.-Mar., 1950), 45-56. Ref- erences to this essay are to page number in the text.</page><page sequence="6">Pueblo and Navaho Ritual Songs 95 enacts the journeys of the first patient-traveler."(51) This means that through ritual language man (singer and patient) is engaged symbolically in movement corresponding to the creative motion of the mythic traveler as well as of the gods and to the various kinds of creative motion found in nature. If Astrov's translation is accurate the nature images in the following song convey human identification with movement in the myth in order to achieve the wholeness synonymous with health in the Navaho view.12 This song identifies the singer and patient with the deity of the mythic journey in images of both movement and nature. Holy Woman I will be you. I will be going away ... Toward the East I will go. From the tip of my foot, There will spring forth lightning. I will be walking amidst tall flowers. (51) The movement of the "I" and his mythic identity, Holy Woman, is to the East, to the light of birth and creation. In movement, the speaker himself becomes a center of sacred dynamism, for lightning (and thus storms and rain) springs forth from the tip of his foot which in turn leads to life blooming ("Walking amidst tall flowers"). To be sure, these sacred powers come to the patient from a deity, but the vehicle is language."3 The most pervasive Navaho images treating the human element in nature are those which reflect the sexual dualism that characterizes much Navaho 12 The ceremonial preoccupation with shaping the individual's well-being through movement is reflected in the content of the songs by the travelling of the gods and men and also in the verbal structure which emphasizes action and the conditions of action. The role of language as human control in these songs would probably be more apparent if we could read them in the original Navaho, a language in which verbs and their inflections are important not because of tense, as in English, but because of their predication of the conditions surrounding action or movement. '" Astrov's ideas can be applied to the ritualization of other kinds of motion. For example, in the following song, commonplace human gesture is ritualized in the con- text of nature. The corn grows up; the rain descends. I sweep it off, I sweep it off. The rain descends; the corn grows up. I sweep it off, I sweep it off. From Matthews, The Night Chant, 85. As this song is performed, the singer motions with a grass brush as if brushing off some evil influence. The life-giving dynamics ol nature are substituted for evil forces through the human gesture of sweeping. The identification of sweeping with the dynamic powers of growth in nature exemplifies the healing virtue of ritualized motion.</page><page sequence="7">96 American Quarterly thought. In this dualism, the Navaho tend to identify what is forceful, vig- orous, or strong as male, what is gentle, fine, weak as female.14 Thus rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is male rain, while the soft, gentle shower is female rain. Such sexual dualism is not, of course, necessarily anthropomorphism. Nor do the Navaho perceive these phenomena in the biological sense; for example, the male and female rain do not reproduce themselves in further rain. Gladys Reichard points out, "the terms included more than the literal differentiation of sex, since two deities of the same sex may be paired and perform the same kind of functions as do the male and female in other cases." (Reichard, 176) In part, the conception seems to suggest the complementary yet opposite forces which operate in the universe and which must be understood and controlled for human success; only by the pairing of such forces can the unity desired in ritual be completed. (Reichard, 29) Furthermore, the sexual dualism reflects the nature in man and man in nature. The sexual opposites, which contribute to the rhythms of life, are aspects of the entire universe. From the pond in the white valley [alkali flat] The young man doubts it- He [the god] takes up his sacrifice, With that he now heals. With that your kindred thank you now. From the pools in the green meadow- The young woman doubts it- He takes up the sacrifice, With that he now heals. With that your kindred thank you now. In this song, the male is associated with the sterile, barren, alkali flat, the female with the lush, growing mountain meadow; the dualism reflects the contrast in the landscape and the beginning and end of a stream in Navaho country. The song emphasizes the cycle of barrenness and fertility, the cycles of being contained within the magic circle of the universe. The poet sees in these phenomena qualities reminiscent of human qualities and so he adopts human sexual identification as a way of defining one aspect of the natural world. The associations of male-female with nature are not made because the male is essentially sterile but because to the mind of the song's creator the images of growth and fertility are so compellingly suggestive of the feminine that the male references are necessary to complete the song ritualistically. The sexual dualism reflects the human in two ways then: the 14 Matthews, Navaho Legends (Boston: American Folklore Society, 1897), 235-36.</page><page sequence="8">Pueblo and Navaho Ritual Songs 97 vision of natural cycles through human sexuality and the ordering design of man's creative ritual.15 This conception of creative natural qualities and forces in equally creative human terms sometimes conveys complex ideas, as the following song from the Blessingway shows. Now as I am the child of White Shell Woman it enabled him to arise. It is the white shell moccasins of Blanca Peak, the same that are mine which enabled him to arise. It is the black bordered white shell moccasins of Blanca Peak, the same that are mine, which enabled him to arise.

By that means I was transformed into fabrics, which enabled him to arise. Now I am long life, now happiness, which enabled him to arise. Before me it is indeed blessed, behind me it is indeed blessed, which enabled him to arise. Below me it is indeed blessed, above me it is indeed blessed, which enabled him to arise. All around me it is indeed blessed, my speech is indeed blessed, which enabled him to arise. .16 (Wyman, 284-86) One of the remarkable qualities of this song is the movement to higher levels of abstraction through the joining of human and natural images. First of all, the imagery suggests the close identification of man, god, and nature which, in Navaho mythology, often makes separating man from god difficult. (The speaker is probably "Born of Water," one of the Navaho Twin Gods, said by some to be the child of White Shell Woman, but ritualistically the "I" is the singer and patient both.) Also, the inner forms of the mountains and their qualities are conceived of as human clothes and finery made of natural objects. But as the description moves through its "toe to head" pattern, we become aware that mere physical attribute is not what's important here, for voice and mind join images of well-being and health. For example, following the reference to mind, in which the mind of the human and the inner form have united, is a reference to voice, whose importance as the symbol of ordered words has already been suggested. 16 With some variations, this is repeated for Mount Taylor, using turquoise instead of white shell. The vagaries of comma usage are Wyman's. Blanca Peak is a peak in Colorado, north of Taos; Mount Taylor is northeast of Grants, New Mexico. "Blanca Peak in white shell apparel and Mount Taylor in turquoise apparel represent all mountains and their jewel ornaments. The suppliant dons the apparel of the inner forms of the mountain and this enables him to arise with the fabrics and jewels which are in the possession of the inner form. He will be transformed into these possessions and become long-life-happiness as the inner forms themselves are." Wyman's note, 284. The Navaho term from which "inner form" is derived means "one who lies within it" or "at its own interior an animate being lies." Wyman says that in them- selves natural phenomena have no life but that an inner form within them functions as a life principle; thus each phenomenon is vitalized and personalized. The inner forms were created from First Man's sacred soil bundle and became Holy People. Every human has a "wind soul" (in-standing one) which enters the body at birth and leaves it at death. As human in form, the inner forms have their own wind souls by which they live. By praying to the inner forms of various phenomena, the Navaho can obtain the blessings embodied in the phenomena. Wyman, 24-26.</page><page sequence="10">Pueblo and Navaho Ritual Songs 99 Furthermore, the voice of prayer is not the error-laden self-expression of Anglo notions about language; it is the voice of human and divine truth, as can be seen in the reference to rock crystal. "At creation a rock crystal was put into the mouth of each person so that everything he said would come true, a probable reason why a crystal is part of many pollen bags, especially the personal ones carried for safety; the pollen bag represents well-being, the crystal the prayer-that is the word that makes prayer come true." (Reichard, 212) In the Navaho mind, then, the rock crystal, symbolic of the truth of prayerful words, is associated with pollen, natural symbol of well-being. From prayer made true in images of crystal and pollen, the song moves to the "surroundings" of Mount Blanca, a ritualistic prepara- tion for the formulaic closing references to the cardinal directions which culminate in the "All around me," an image of wholeness and harmony. The harmony and wholeness are identified as "long-life and happiness," both a desired human condition and personified deities. In brief, human garments, human thought and language, the conception of space ordered by the human physical presence, and the animating human essence all shape the images of nature to reveal the presence of the creative human perspec- tive. These examples from Navaho ritual songs and prayers show man acting as the responsible center through various kinds of control: human design or order, language, human motion, the perception of nature in terms of human sexual dualism, and finally the human physical and psychic presence. Navaho religious beliefs and practices were influenced by Pueblo religion. It would be a misrepresentation of Pueblo belief, however, to argue that man' s creative control as the responsible center is as explicit in Pueblo ritual songs and prayers as in the Navaho. Perhaps a perspective just implicit in Pueblo belief was more compatible with and thus was made more explicit in the ritual of the more individualistic and aggressive Navaho. Nevertheless, the theme is present in much Pueblo ritual literature.'7 While in Navaho ritual the idea of man as the responsible center is manifested through var- ious kinds of creative control, in Pueblo ritual man's centrality and control are, paradoxically, manifested in identifying Rexroth's "the other" with the human. But the human is by no means lost as a source of value in this identification. On the contrary, human identity in various forms remains distinct. Speaking of Zuni cosmology, R. F. Kirk says, "In this system the starting point is man, who is the lowest because the most dependent and the least mysterious. In just so far as an organism resembles man is it related to "7Tyler, 174-75.</page><page sequence="11">100 American Quarterly him. Insofar as it is mysterious is it believed removed from man, further advanced and holy."'18 What Kirk says is no doubt literally true, but one purpose of Pueblo ceremonialism is to bring the mysterious and holy within the perspective of the human. Nature images are present in the ritual songs and prayers not only as part of the supernatural realm but also as a body of symbols of the boundaries of human experience (boundaries which are often extended beyond ordinary experience) and as a means of ordering the cosmos. As Byron Harvey points out in his essay, "An Overview of Pueblo Religion," the major Pueblo nature symbols-corn, seeds and pollen, clouds, lightning, water, sacred mountain, and directions-direct man's mind to his own existence; the Pueblo's natural surroundings reflect the condition and destiny of man.'9 Consider, for example, the Pueblo tendency to regard one's village as the center of all things, an aspect of the symbolization of the cardinal directions, which is nearly universal among Native Americans. North, South, West, East, and sometimes the Above and Below, are fundamental spatial symbols. All power flows from these directions, from the universe around man, to man at the center. (The old name for Zuni is Itiwana, the middle, both spatially and temporally.) Ritual references to these directions, along with associated animals or stones, are an effort to reassert and to sustain the flow of power to man. Furthermore, as the following song makes clear, man himself at the center is a source of power. Earth plant Earth plant Toward the north Your arm lies spread out, Toward the west Your legs lie spread out, Toward the south Your arm lies spread out, Toward the east Your head lies spread out.

Earth plant lies spread out.20 The central image of this song from Acoma pueblo is a geomorphic image which establishes an identity among man, vegetative nature, and the earth. Rather than being anthropomorphic, the identification symbolically reaffirms man's bond to and control of nature. The orientation of the Earth Plant to the four cardinal directions, as well as to the zenith and nadir, focusses on the plants and particularly on the people in the middle: the people are the sacred center from which is exhaled the breath of life and prayer. For the Pueblo ritualized breathing is a form of prayer. That particular reference is made apparently to the breathing emphasizes man's creative, life-express- ing presence. In the song, ritualistic imagination reorders nature with man at the controlling center. As the Earth Plant song suggests, a fundamental act of the ritualistic imagination among the Pueblo, as among most Native Americans, is to place man undeniably and rightfully in the physical world: man's physical and spiritual selves are extended through all space in the sacred image of four or more cardinal directions.21 Thus the macrocosm is symbolized by the microcosm, man. Other Pueblo songs, too, treat nature as an extension of man, again not anthropomorphically, but in the perception of man's creative control. In the following song, consciously sustained imagery from the human realm shows how the natural world is perceived to "fit" man like a garment. As a supplication, the song may seem to imply a world beyond man's control, but assuming that the basic metaphors are not simply the product of the translator's own sensitivity, the metaphors reflect perfectly man's discovery of a creative element in himself (the Pueblo have long been considered among the Southwest's most sophisticated weavers) that is part of his identity and that corresponds to a creative element in nature, the rain. Such a discovery transforms supplicatory dependence into ritual control through creative perception. 20 Elsie Clews Parsons, Pueblo Indian Religion, 2 Vols.

This natural garment nurtures man, covers him with life. But through the creative perception of metaphor, the natural phenomena also become part of his human identity, just as his woven dance kilts are part of his ritual identity, thus allowing him to walk "fittingly" in the natural world. This song "weaves" an image of man's destiny in nature. In the last two Pueblo songs the use of nature imagery is explicit. Among some of the Pueblo, there is a traditional though less explicit association of the human with the naturally creative through death. In Zuni and other Pueblo mythology, the dead ancestors are identified with the rain-makers who come back to the villages of the living as rain clouds, bringing with them life and fruitfulness. Bunzel says that the dead are part of the "great spiritual essence of the universe" but a part which is "nearest and most intimate" of all.23 (The old ones among the Zuni tell the children as the afternoon rain clouds gather in the New Mexican summer sky, "The Grandfathers are coming.") Such rain-makers are not gods but humans who in death have added an essential function of nature to their human identities. The following excerpt from a Zuni prayer to the ancients follow- ing harvest suggests how human responsibility continues even into death when man joins the natural and supernatural universe, and in doing so extends the boundaries of human experience and creative responsibility.

They will bless us with life.24 The current year's harvest may be completed, but next year's is by no means assured; therefore, the ancients must be reminded of the people's continuing need of rain. The prayer expresses the belief that the ancients will aid man by bringing life-giving rains because of the constraint placed upon them by human offerings, actions, and the words of the prayers. More important is that the fathers, even though now apparently part of the natural world, are made mindful of their continuing ties to humanity and share the human obligation to assure harmonious survival. That it is the humanity of the ancestor rain-makers appealed to in such songs and prayers is suggested in a Zuni prayer which accompanies the offering of prayer sticks to the ancestors. "This day," the speaker says, "with my warm human hands I took hold of them. I gave my plume wands human form." He then goes on to describe the "dressing" of these human forms. (Bunzel, Poetry, 625) Thus the human maker reminds the ancestors of their human ties through the "human" forms of the prayer sticks. Moreover, the speaker is a living human ("warm human hands") who recognizes his control over the life-giving dead through his prayer plumes. '&gt;` Ruth Bunzel, "Zuni Ritual Poetry," B.A.E.

I am on the way, traveling the road to where the spirits live, at Shipap. I look at the road, far ahead, down that way. Nothing happens to me as I am a spirit. I am a spirit, of course, I am, as I go on the nice clean road to Shipap. It is true that my spirit meets the others who come towards me. I am glad to see them and be with them, I have a right to be there. I cannot help it; I must leave because the spirit has called me back. I must go, I must obey. So I am going direct to my spirit. There are places down there where all the people live whom you have seen; they have gone, when the time has come. Now I cannot say what they will make of me. I may take the form of a cloud; I wish I could be a cloud. I take the chance of whatever is offered to me. When a cloud comes this way, you will say, "That is he!" When I get to the place of the spirits, I will hear everything you ask. You must always remember me. You have talked about me, And in Shipap I can hear everything you say. I am a spirit and I bless you. I thank you for all you have done for me in past years. I hope to see you some day. We send you many good wishes, many good things. Thank you.25 " Frances Densmore, Music of Santo Domingo Pueblo, New Mexico (Los Angeles: Southwest Museum Papers, 1938), 67-68. "Shipap" designates the place of emergence for the Keresan Pueblo. At death, the people return to Shipap.</page><page sequence="16">Pueblo and Navaho Ritual Songs 105 This song shares the Zuni belief that rain clouds are the spirits of the dead come back to help the living. What is particularly noteworthy about the song is the implied relationship among the living, between the living and the dead, and the living and creative natural phenomena. By the end of the song, the speaker, a dead child's spirit, no longer identifies with living humans but with rain spirits. However, this does not mean that the child's spirit has forgotten its human origins and bonds: the living will remember the dead in the passing of the clouds, and the spirit will hear the prayers of the living. After the child becomes a spirit, he thanks the living for all that they have done for him, and between the "thank you's," the spirit promises "many good wishes, many good things." These benefits brought by the rain are not given gratuitously; they are repayment for the pleasures and satisfactions of human relationships. Revealing an essential bond between the human world and the spirit-natural world, the song is an imaginative effort to extend human influence beyond human finitude. It is a recognition that all human activities have creative influence in the natural universe, for even human relationships affect the abundance of creativity and fruitfulness. Another way that Pueblo ritual songs and prayers sometimes place man at the responsible center of things is by transferring ceremonial terminology usually applied to divine natural forces treated in the rituals to the humans participating. The next prayer is made while presenting an infant to the sun for the first time. Now this is the day. Our child, Into the daylight You will go out standing. Our sun father Went in to sit down at his sacred place. And our night fathers, Having come out standing to their sacred place, Passing a blessed night We came to day Now this day, Our fathers Dawn priests, Have come out standing to their sacred place, Our sun father, Having come out standing to his sacred place, Our child, It is your day.</page><page sequence="17">106 American Quarterly This day, The flesh of the white corn, Prayer meal, To our sun father This prayer meal we offer. May your road be fulfilled Reaching to the road of your sun father, When your road is fulfilled, In your thoughts may we live, May we be the ones whom your thoughts will embrace, For this, on this day, To our sun father, We offer prayer meal. To this end: May you help us all to finish our roads. (Bunzel, Poetry, 635) In the work from which this song is taken, Bunzel tells us that an out- standing feature of Zuni ritual songs and prayers is the use of conventional metaphors for all things commonly referred to in prayers. For example, the Dawn Priests always "come out standing to their sacred place," a phrase applied to other figures, like the sun, as well. Such phrases are applied to the child in this song in a ritual cementing of the obligations owed each other by god and man and also as a recognition of the mutual interests and powers of man and Sun, for both "come out standing," both are seen in the context of the ceremonially sacred. Such sacred and ritualistic bonds be- tween man and Sun are reinforced by the references to the "flesh of the white corn, prayer meal," for the Sun as generative force contributes to the growth of the corn, which in turn builds the flesh of man, who presents the corn meal as an appropriate offering to the Sun. Thus the human element is made at least as responsible as the divine in this creative scheme of things. In the same vein as the Santo Domingan song, the Grandmother anticipates the time when the child's spirit will join the ancestors at Katcina Village (among other things, the Katcinas are associated with the rain-makers) by hoping that the child's spirit will remember the people: "in your thoughts may we live, May we be the ones whom your thoughts will embrace . . . May you help us all to finish our roads." Asking that the child remember the living in that far-off time, the Grandmother speaks as "we." She rep- resents not the individual woman who will herself be among the spirits by the time of the child's death but the timeless Zuni community. As a repre- sentative of this timeless center, the human community, she reaches beyond the limits of this time and this place in nature to establish certainties in an</page><page sequence="18">Pueblo and Navaho Ritual Songs 107 uncertain future. Thus, from the Zuni point of view, man is perhaps even a "permanent factor" in the universe. The songs and prayers cited in this essay evidence the Navaho and Pueblo belief that man is indeed a source of the world's value. In ways that perhaps they don't realize, the popularizers of Native American cultures are correct when they say these traditions hold ecological lessons for the Anglo world. The lesson of Navaho and Pueblo traditions is that man need not submit to nature's benevolence and that the human need not be denied in order for man to live harmoniously with nature. "Man," said Santayana, "cannot attain this happiness by conforming to that which is hostile to himself; he can thus attain only his dissolution. By using what is hostile to himself for his own ends, as far as energy extends, he can make an oasis for himself in Nature, and being at peace with himself, be at peace with her."26 Through a transforming and controlling spiritual energy, through that human crea- tivity corresponding to the creativity of the universe, these people have as- sured themselves of nature's benevolence and thus of man's survival. They have lived in peace with nature and with themselves. "From the middle out- ward breath is breathed." Through the human spirit, man's road is ful- filled.* "' Santayana, Interpretations of Poetry and Religion, 247. * The research for this article was made possible by a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend (1974).
