"? r r~ :' * fltIOK W, Saict DIACRITICS Your scholarly work is commonly associated with that of what we might term a "critical avant-garde," a constellation of critics, as it were, who are concerned with the philosophical questions encountered in interpretive activity and who are prone to draw on the difficult theoretical reflection which informs a major strain of continental criticism. In this conrlection, you recently expressed considerable sympathy for the deeply philosophical criticism of Harold Bloom, whose work strikes some readers as being not only recondite and arcane, but also otherworldly, submerged in poetry to the exclusion of the prosaic world, lofted into a prophetic flight toward an ultimate convergence with the literary text. No doubt you would find such an image of Bloom's work quite unfair. Yet one wonders how you respond to the general resistance which the writing of a Bloom or a De Man is prone to en- counter from readers who find it to be far removed from the cultural and political arena of our time-unlike your own work, which at the very least has to be read as a direct challenge to the ideological complicities of much academic criticism. EWS You raise some important points. First of all, let's consider your proposition about a critical avant-garde. No one to my knowledge has analyzed such a proposi- tion seriously, although there seems to be a general feeling about that literary crit- icism in the English-speaking world now can be divided into two kinds, French- influenced and non-French-influenced, the former being avant-garde, the latter traditional. This is a sloppy-but by no means passive-feeling, since the evidence commonly (and aggressively) cited for it is either crudely sociological or stylistic, if by style we mean only what kind of vocabulary, authorities, texts a critic employs. The critics you have called avant-garde belong, of course, in the French-influenced group, they are likely to be East coast critics and middle-aged, they get high salaries at famous universities, they are prolific-writers of essays on other critics, they either write about unfashionable authors (Pater, Shelley, Emerson) or about a handful of very fashionable ones (Rousseau, Nietzsche, Freud), they use words like deconstruc- tion and demystification, they are less likely to refer to Empson than to Barthes, their prose does not resemble Edmund Wilson's, and so forth; listing their attributes can be done as a sort of parlor-game, and one need only do it as a higher form of gossip-except that by and large the avant-garde critics have two or three serious things in common, so far as their audience, the student of literature, and the reception of their work are concerned. I shall leave aside for now the critical theoty-if one can talk about it in so unitary a way-that justifies us in putting them together; now I would like to discuss them as others see them. In the first place, their work angers a great many people who resent being asked by a critic to read sentences that a) do not make a "factual" point about the author's biography, the work's textual history, or some such thing; b) do not tell the reader what to think about a work or author or period; c) do not spend much time explicitly making value-judgments about the work; d) do not make a fetish of gross chronology; e) do not badger the reader either with catalogues of other critical opinions or with lists of works testifying to the critic's erudition, sense of tradition, humble place in scholarly life (perhaps "badger" is not the only word one can use here; "fortify" seems relevant too). Take these sorts of things together and you will see immediately that one novel thing about these critics is that their rituals and procedures differ from the ones fathered on academic literary criticism since the end of the nineteenth century. Their notion of what a text is, their addiction to terminological invention, their comparative disregard for biography, their alert- ness not to "traditions" so much as to "problematics"-all these set them apart. But principally of course, they are provocative critics, mainly because they turn the criticism of a text or author into a methodological and self-conscious issue of the first importance; thus the appreciation or valorization of a work or author, which we sometimes assume to be the goal of criticism, turns out here to be its point of departure, in some cases even a hidden point of departure. There is additional provocation in the position they take (and I am using "position" in a very literal way) towards the work; Swift used to say that the bad thing about critics is that 30</page><page sequence="2">because they come after a work, they can always rather nastily crowd out every- body else and ruin a work's reputation. For these critics, however, the work is a contemporary thing, along and within which they place their own; what they do is re- creative, in all senses of that word. For all its difficulty their work contains a sense of the pleasure taken in having tried at least to meet the literary text on some other level than the ruthlessly evaluative (which is one of the things Swift feared, since he was thinking-as we all do--of the tyranny of popular reviewers) or the flatter- ingly appreciative. The point is that critics are supposed to be commentators from below, as it were, to stand to literature as Howard Cosell stands to Mohammed Ali. If a critic tries to treat a text, whose principal characteristic seems to be its holy fossilization by time, with something resembling co-temporality, even deferential and respectful co-temporality, a lot of people suddenly see red. Intertextuality, which is what the avant-garde critic claims is the universal condition of texts (all texts, critical and "creative"), is not supposed to be true of criticism. According to the cant belief of those who think that a critic's main justification is to help the work to be better appreciated, which makes him extra-textual at best, the critic has no right to point out, for example, that literature is language, and that criticism is language too, with its own problems and limitations of course, but language nonetheless. I needn't elaborate too much here, since Barthes's Critique et verit6 marshalls all the debating techniques on both sides of the critical fence, and he illustrates too the degree of violence that a certain kind of new criticism produces in the rhetoric of its (usually) self-proclaimed enemies. For avant-garde critics of the kind I'm discussing seem rather mild-mannered when it comes to their opponents; all the ire comes from the other side; this is not a fierce, or combative, or rhetorically aggressive avant- garde; it seems more devoted to its work-rightly so-than to carrying on cam- paigns against the so-called old guard, which has been very energetic and diligent in going after the critical avant-garde. The latter, to be fair about it, does seem at times infected with a kind of clubby hot-house grandeur, as if all that mattered to it were Derrida and Heidegger and not at all the sweaty workshops in which much intellectual work is transacted. So anger is a common reaction these critics produce. Another-and this is a more important matter-is that their subject-matter is innovative and hence out- rageous to an audience that believes a critic ought to confine himself to canonical issues and techniques: explication, commentary, historical background, biography, and so forth. Amongst the Yale critics, for example, you can notice how the titles of some of their books actually deflect criticism onto new subjects: influence (a standard, perhaps the standard, concern in school criticism) is associated not with source studies but with anxiety; formalism and insight (two of the code-words of the American New Criticism) are tied respectively to transcendence and blindness. Everyone will agree that this avant-garde, like all avant-gardes, is preposterous to a certain degree. Its first order of business is not presence but deferred presence, or absence; for its purposes a text is more an activity than a grounded object-the reversal of expectations is a long and by now well-known list. Yet it is the work of the avant-garde that appeals to students; they seek it out as something that elevates the drudgery of graduate literature work to a higher, and if not to a higher then to a more interesting level. Why this feeling should exist amongst students is a complicated question; to answer it one would have to explain an apparent lack of vitality in historical or traditional scholarship (the extent to which Auerbachs and Spitzers can't be produced any more), the economics of the profession (which with few jobs available is paradoxically more prone to hire a structuralist-type new Ph.D. to teach traditionally conceived, or bread-and-butter, courses than not), and the teachability, marketability, technicability-Il'm coining a word for the conver- sion of avant-garde criticism by opportunists into a technical, pseudo-scientific criticism that pretends to stand for the new and the trendy--of avant-garde criticism itself. But even if we don't go into these matters the fact remains that students flock to the new criticism for the sustained excitement and dignity it communicates, and students feel (wrongly or rightly is not what I want to discuss here) that these quali- ties are lacking in the established curricular study of literature. The really interesting writing being done by the best people in their late twenties and thirties is directly indebted to the avant-garde. The danger of course is that avant-garde criticism is overesteemed for its comparative neglect of historical, you might say archival con- cern: I'll return to that problem a little later. dilcritics/Fall 1976 31</page><page sequence="3">Innovation stimulates anger more or less naturally. Besides, other feelings be- come engaged too: jealousy (why are those characters getting so much attention?), xenophobia (that isn't criticism, it's frogspeak), and a not unjustified hostility to a new coterie (there's Commentary, there's the New York Review, now there are Diacritics, NLH and Georgia Review: are they necessary?). But more fundamentally the avant-garde critics are literalizers, that is they take literature at its own word, literally, they treat it as language and so out-do (or over-do) the belle-lettrist old- guard that believes literature to be Literature, beautiful language, and so forth. One of the commonest refrains now is that people like Bloom, Hartman and de Man don't write well (I've made the observation myself, and had it made about me: a nice mess which I can't unravel). But what is at issue is not that they are influenced by a foreign tradition (since most df them had their ideas before the French influ- ence, broadly speaking, was felt). Neither is it that they have metaphysical concerns which get in the way of purely (and purified) literary criticism. What is at stake, and makes it possible for "style" to be used as a cosh with which to bang them around, is that their criticism takes language as language, and then proceeds to discuss literature as embroiled in the problems of language. "Style" is the weapon employed to bring literature back to the realm of ideas, humanistic testimonials and so forth, whereas for the avant-garde the profound question is the embedding of literature in language. That and the way in which language produces (rather than is produced by) meaning. In a certain sense, the radicalism of the avant-garde is a conservative one, keeping literature to language and the problems raised by language. And these can be intimate or embarrassing, as when Bloom speaks of an Oedipal struggle enacted between poets whose only spoils of war are lines of poetry. Perhaps one can also say that avant-garde critics of the sort I've been talking about here, are severe critics in the sense that Vico used the word. To a great degree their severity accounts for the difficulty many people experience in understanding their writing; it is a difficulty that comes directly, I think, from limitation, not from the ambition to do too much. So much for the reception at present of the embattled avant-garde you men- tioned. This is not to say that the avant-garde is the Yale school, since so far as I'm concerned there are many other critics in the U. S.-Girard, Fletcher, Crews, Fish, Riddel, Poirier, the early Sontag, Donato, and others-from whom I learn and who do very different things, but which I would also call avant-garde. Neither can one confine the avant-garde to critics of a certain age; there is Kenneth Burke, there was Blackmur (the greatest genius American criticism has produced) who belong to an earlier generation, yet whose work bristles with invention, brilliance and inde- pendence of the sort I have been talking about. I can't claim to speak, however, of what people think I do, and in what camp my work belongs, but I do feel that very often-too often in fact-the distinctions between present avant-garde critics and "other" critics are invidious, and don't serve any purpose except to stir up a little excitement. I think that my interest in what is now being written by critics, and what has been written, is very catholic indeed; a lot of the time I am drawn to scholars who do not belong to the avant- garde, since the latter do not seem to be interested as much as I would like in the sheer semantic thickness of a literary text, and that thickness cannot be completely served by psychoanalysis, semiology and the like. If you read a critic like Harry Levin on Shakespeare or on the novel you are getting a learned and sharp intelli- gence that can use much of what needs to be used (including Lukacs, Bachelard, Barthes, Freud, etc.) because it serves a serious critical aim. You will never need to fear that only some of the problems of Stendhal are being considered, or that a text by Flaubert is studied with no real knowledge of Second Empire France, and so on. So it is probably far too schematic to divide criticism into two hostile camps. In addition I think we should remember that many scholars who themselves write traditional criticism are sensitively alert to and sympathetic with what's being done in the theory of criticism by the avant-garde. We need to acknowledge that criticism is a very complex act: it involves performance, cognition, intuition, style, ritual, and charlatanry of course. All of us can tell a good critic no matter what banner he car- ries; similarly, all of us know that it is possible genuinely to learn from one critic and not from another. It's not a partisan matter finally. But you ask about Bloom; let me talk about him a little. I've already expressed my general opinion of his work in some detail, so there's no need to do it again here. I can add two observations of a different sort, however. Bloom is a critic who is not afraid of being theoretical; that is, he is willing to talk in abstract and general- izing language about patterns, forces, processes that inform the production and the reception of literature. Of course he shares this theoretical interest with many of 32</page><page sequence="4">the avant-garde, and it is something I find myself drawn to a great deal. The ob- jections to theory in literary criticism are so boring as to require no repetition now; but one thing that strikes many of Bloom's readers is the extravagance of his theory, or to use your expression, its prophetic quality. One's impression is that Bloom seems to have allowed his theory to take over his criticism completely, if by criticism one means the making of discrete judgments, rationalistic analysis, and so on. More- over the complex variety of literature appears to have been reduced by Bloom to an endless instance of the theory. Perhaps all this is a way of saying that Bloom is a hedgehog, not a fox. But all these objections are mainly, I think, a result of the difficulty that people have both with theory as such, and with the (to them) im- pertinent pose of a critic who believes he is getting to the very heart of the poetic process. Readers of Poulet, who has many of the same kind of problems with his audience, always say that he is too abstract, or that he hasn't any right to speak for really big authors like Stendhal or Hugo; what such comments reveal, however, is the inability to deal with theory on intellectual grounds. If one doesn't like 'Bloom's tone, or Poulet's for that matter, and if one feels that the whole idea of trying to penetrate into a poet's consciousness is ridiculous, then one ought to go on to show if and in what way the theory is falsifiable or false (I am using Popperian language purposely), either by proposing a more correct one or by demonstrating seriously-and not simply by pompous exhortation-that the theory is misapplied. There is nothing more indecent in criticism than someone who uses a lot of marginal nonsense (Bloom is too theoretical, or Bloom is reducing everything to his theory) as a substitute for serious refutation; it is total bad faith, on the other hand, to use the kind of third-hand language associated with high humanism to suggest that Bloom has defiled literature and literary criticism. A second general observation is that Bloom's criticism is semioclastic in a very extreme way. I use Barthes's word for what he was doing in Mythologies since the consequence of reading Bloom is that our image of what a poet does, how he works, what his poetry is, becomes shattered. There is nothing so sacred to literature and literary criticism as the mythology of creation. Bloom has made a shambles of that, first by associating creation with contraction and repression, second by turning the poet into a human being who is terribly mired (as Vico was the first to realize) in the difficulties of generation, parenthood, and family life. Latecoming for Bloom is primarily a biological and even sexual term; the affront to polite criticism that the term delivers is unmistakable, and seems unforgivable. For me Bloom's criticism, when I first encountered it in its mature theoretical form (I had read Shelley's Mythmaking when I was a student) as a critic was and still is extraordinarily invigorating. My whole interest in beginnings and origins sud- denly acquired a new dimension for me, and many confirmations. I found Bloom's re-working of the old influence topos powerful and elegant in the way that Berg's Violin Concerto re-works that old chorale and makes it disturbingly elegant and powerful. Most of all, however, I was impressed with the way Bloom showed that creation was a form of dealing with the past, re-doing it in an original or beginning way, so to speak, and since I was a devoted student of Vico the discovery of themes like knowing is making, and the heroism of early poets, in Bloom was quite an experience. I've always felt, nonetheless, that Bloom implies-without actually saying it- that creation is poetry, and vice versa. He has no discernible interest in the novel or drama, both of which have undismissable connections with history and society. And moreover, Bloom is primarily interested in the struggle between poets without showing necessarily that there are other struggles (as the one say between a poet and the language: Mallarm6's case) that play a role as well in poetic creation. But these are objections one might address to emphases in and applications of the theory. My principal theoretical differences with Bloom are of a different sort, which is what I took your question to be getting at. I don't think it is correct to criticize Bloom for ignoring what you call the pro- saic world, at least not from a theoretical point of view. He doesn't say he's not interested in it, or that it doesn't exist, or anything like that. All he says-and I'm not simply trying to defend him, but I'm trying to deal only with the theory-is that poets are primarily concerned with poetry, which is their element and their life as poets; furthermore, he says, creation is an active, anxious and highly patterned struggle against strong predecessors. For the description of this struggle Bloom has devised not only a complex and brilliantly inventive vocabulary but also a whole series of methodological doctrines. I sometimes feel that the vocabulary is perhaps too schematic or theological, and sometimes that methodologically Bloom refines his work too much in order to take account of figures he has discovered recently diacritics /Fall 1976 33</page><page sequence="5">(like Derrida for instance). But there is a whole side to Bloom's work which is ig- nored by his critics, a side which to me is at least as important as the maps, the terms, and the struggles he seems mainly to be describing. And that side is Bloom's ideas about literary history, and the transmission of culture from one generation to the next. Bloom is right to believe that culture doesn't get made ex nihilo, and right also to see the effort expended by poets in getting their poetry into existence. But I think he is wrong to think of poetic and/or cultural history as being either ex- clusively or preeminently a matter of dramatic struggle between strong and weak poets. A great deal of what matters in cultural history is not what you might call revolutionary but conservative; culture is not made exclusively or even principally by heroes or radicals all the time, but by great anonymous movements whose func- tion it is to keep things going, keep things in being, "elles maintiennent les choses dans l'etre" as Foucault says in his book on Roussel. Bloom nowhere takes account of the debt poetry owes to culture or history. The kind of thing that Curtius de- scribes, which is a process of orderly cultural transmission and canon-formation surely underlies most literary and cultural periods. Not all great or strong writers are rebels; most writers in fact are in fundamental harmony with what they identify as a prevailing culture (perhaps the modernists were an exception). But what at- tracts Bloom to the idea of poetic struggle and individuality is his notion that for the post-Miltonic writer, influence is almost always felt to be aggressively hostile. Once again I think Bloom ignores the fact that for a great many quite considerable writers, influence can be a benign thing: see, for example, Goethe's relationship with Hafiz (especially in "Unbegrenzt" and "Nachbildung" of the West-6sterlicher Divan). The impressive thing about Schwab's La Renaissance orientale is that he deals with exactly the periods of most concern to Bloom; only his findings are opposite. The great influx into Europe during the early nineteenth century of Orien- tal ideas and texts had a very fruitful effect upon such strong poets as Hugo and Goethe; Schwab's main insight is that there is cultural renewal and continuity be- cause poets positively welcome, seek out influence. Of course Bloom suggests the ambivalent feelings of poets towards their predecessors, the paradox of their attrac- tion to and their defense against them, both at the same time. But what Bloom does not spend much time with is the gradation within influence, the various degrees of influence and, congruently, the various kinds of influence, from benign to anxiety- producing. He also neither cares for sports like Hopkins, nor for self-consciously influenceable poets like Eliot. In any case, let me return to my argument. If you see literary history as quin- tessentially embodied in the work of heroic, radical figures, whose importance is that their work is epoch-making, you are not misreading cultural history, you aren't reading all of it. I think that is one of the things that Foucault discovered between Les Mots et les choses and I'Archeologie du savior. The early work had conceived of history as divided into discontinuous periods which follow each other in time the way (these are Foucault's examples) Sade is followed by Nietzsche. Later Fou- cault had to come to see that the enduring qualities of culture are precisely that it endures, and how it endures, not so much the contribution to culture of great cul- ture-heroes like Milton and Goethe. In short, Bloom's theory of poetic transmission conceals, I think, a radically mythologized conception of the individual determinants of culture, and a total disregard for culture's anonymous and institutional supports, which simply go on and on beyond individual efforts or life-spans. Instead of seeing culture as finally a more regular, and regularizing business than not, Bloom holds to a notion that delegates tradition (and culture, by implication) to individual figures; I am saying that poetry makes poets, whereas Bloom believes that poets make poetry. One of the things that I've admired and praised about Bloom's criticism is that he is consistently aware of how much more poetry entails than just the poet's lonely splendors, that in addition to the poet's agonies there are also his antagonists, and these exist in a relatively public domain which Bloom calls "poetry." But he doesn't ever go far enough in acknowledging the material side of this public domain: here I return to what I was saying earlier about the institutional supports of culture, and its roots in prosaic reality. Certainly the romantics were aware of Milton, but they were vitally involved also in the journals, reviews, and competing discourses of their time; how do these bear on the making of poetry, and how does a discourse for poetry common to all the Romantic poets enter the mainstream of their work? My point is that the debate, or the intertextuality that Bloom discusses with such insight and brilliance, scants all the materially productive agencies of the culture that contains, and enables, the romantic poets. These supports are collective, of course: they include social agencies of all sorts (the university, the press, the class system) as well as quasi-invisible agencies which Foucault has quite inventively called the collective system of archive-discourse-statement (enonc6). 34</page><page sequence="6">You will see that far from criticizing Bloom's specific insights into post- Miltonic poetry I am saying that these insights are so powerful as to have ravaged out of all existence the historical scene in which that poetry is set, or in which it takes place. His theory argues that poetry is produced as a result of poets interior- izing their relationship to the world, concentrating it into their psyche by making the predecessor's poetry a symbol of the great world. Poetry is the Poet's struggles with other Poets, and we must look to them for an understanding of all poetic production. Now even if we allow that that is an accurate view of Wallace Stevens or Hardy we must enjoin Bloom a) to set limits on the theory as an explanation of poetic production universally considered, b) to cite instances when his view is not an adequate account of poetic production, and c) to connect his theses about poetry with the historical circumstances of a poet's production. These are some of the theoretical and practical questions his theory raises for me. I've dodged the main direction of your question long enough. You raise an overtly political question which I couldn't reply to directly without first going into technical, or perhaps professional, critical theory presented by Bloom in particular, and the avant-garde generally. If we move out a little beyond the "field" so to speak, there are certain observations to be made candidly. Elsewhere I've said that I find the New New critics to be quietistic; their concerns and closures are textual ones, the issues that engage them are-from a historical, social or general point of view-very restricted. They seem uninterested in political questions. The life of so- ciety, or the life of society that bears centrally upon texts and literature, does not occupy their attention. I am speaking generally of course; people like Crews and Poirier, for example, do not at all fit what I'm describing. But the Yale critics (whom I talk about as symbolic of a fairly widespread critical community) seem to have willed upon themselves a pronounced askesis, a renunciation of everything but the literary work and its problems. This is not to say that what they have to say about literature provides no allusive or implicit comment on the life of society: Bloom's theory of poetry is valuable because he sees the poetic process as a social one, something that takes place between poets, although of course we cannot say that Bloom's poets act as part of a larger group than theirs. You find similar, and similarly limited, refractions of social and communal ideas in the criticism of Hartman and Miller, less so in de Man whose work contains evidence of a submerged, though powerful, sense of metaphysical crisis. Having said that, I feel I must stop talking about others and speak for what I think I should be doing as a critic; perhaps that is another way of saying that while I share a great many interests with the critical avant-garde I feel myself sep- arated from it on a great many other grounds. Bloom and I have discussed politics only once I think, and we both agreed-not without a good chuckle-that we couldn't be further apart. Until fairly recently I led two quite separate lives, which has always made me acutely appreciative of Conrad's The Secret Sharer. On the one hand I'm a literary scholar, critic, and teacher, I lead a pretty uncontroversial life in a big university, and I've done a fair amount of work which has always been plugged into the established channels. That's a function of a certain education, the appearance of a certain social background. Yet I lead another life, which most other lit- erary people say nothing about (and this is a kind of acrobatics which people who know me can manage, with my helping them along: I've been very good at this). It's as if it isn't there, although many of them know that it is. My whole background in the Middle East, my frequent and sometimes protracted visits there, my political in- volvement: all this exists in a totally different box from the one out of which I pop as a literary critic, professor, etc. Now the second, and older, life is encroaching fairly seriously on the other one, and this is a difficult juncture for me. I am as aware as anyone that the ivory-tower concerns of technical criticism-I use the phrase because it is very useful as a way of setting off what I and the others we've mentioned do from the non-theoretical, non-philosophically based criticism normally found in academic departments of literature-are very far removed from the world of politics, power, domination, and struggle. But there are links between the two worlds which I for one am beginning to exploit in my own work. Bloom's work is centered around struggle, and very restricted notions of power, domination and repression. Whatever his political beliefs (Republican or Democrat, Marxist or anti-Marxist) he's hit on something I find absolutely true: that human activity, and the production of work does not, cannot take place without power relationships of the sort he talks about in poetry. One doesn't just write: one writes against, or in opposition to, or in some dialectical relationship with other writers and writing, or other activity, or other objects. Foucault goes a step further, and says that writing cannot materially exist (remember the question that puzzles diacritics/Fall 1976 35</page><page sequence="7">one of Borges's characters somewhere: what keeps the letters and lines in a book from just sliding off the page?) without a network of agencies that limit, select, ar- range, shape and maintain writing in such a way as to make writing take on a par- ticular form at a particular time. For me Foucault strips out of Bloom much of the dramatic and overly-romantic quality I mentioned earlier as a distortion in Bloom's picture of things; Foucault shows how the struggle for domination can be quiet, systematic, hidden, all because discourse (which is always a symbol of victory in language) appears to be inevitable and systematic. Together, and writ very large, these two perspectives fairly describe the contemporary political scene, which itself encapsulates political history pretty much. There is an unceasing and meaningful interaction between forces-classes, nations, power centers, regions, whatever- seeking to dominate and displace each other; now what makes the struggle some- thing more than a random tooth-and-claw battle is that values (moral and intellec- tual) are involved. One seeks domination over another, in order to dominate and also to exist. You could call these systems ideologies but I think that's too con- straining a term: they are systems of belief and universes of effective performance and discourse. It's been said about Marx that he saw this struggle as something exclusively economic; that's a serious falsification of Marx, or at least of the Hegelian residues in Marx. He was perfectly aware that the struggle was materially expressed and economically characterizable, but he was, I think, enormously sensitive to the shaping dialectic, to the intangible but very real figurations, to the internal unisons and dissonances the struggle produced. That is the difference between him and Hobbes, who saw life as nasty, brutish, and short. I come from a part of the world whose modern history is largely intelligible as the result of colonialism, and whose present travail cannot be detached from the operations of imperialism. Now colonialism and imperialism are not abstractions for me: they are specific experiences and forms of life that have an almost unbear- able concreteness. What are imperialism and colonialism but phases of a protracted struggle of the sort Bloom describes as central to the poetic process? What is the ongoing life of a dependent or colonial people but the imposition on that people of a powerful and duplicitous system (discourse), of the sort that Foucault has studied in his work? I am making the transition from poetry and discourse to imperialism and colonialism very abruptly-but I think my gist is clear. Well then, in my other-than-scholarly life I do certain things which are fre- quently clarified for me by surprising and unlikely ideas, like Bloom's for example. I will confess to no utopian notions about the end of the struggles I've just talked about, but I guess that what moves me mostly is anger at injustice, an intolerance of oppression, and some fairly unoriginal ideas about freedom and knowledge. The great problem of course is sinking all these things, plus the two lives I mentioned, plus my empirical actuality, plus my profound interest in literature, criticism and teaching, in some kind of work; and that's where I think I am now, that is I feel I'm able to do that now. And politically it distances me rather a lot from the critics and colleagues whose work I've just been talking about, and which I greatly respect and admire. Perhaps we can discuss that. DIACRITICS In your book Beginnings (1975) you refer to a "radical displacement of tradi- tional thought" requiring a "new fusion between man and his activity," and then affirm that "Marx has cemented his own interpretive activity with man's human activity at a common revolutionary point of departure." The question which arises then is the placement of that point of departure, i.e., where in your judgment does it lie for the "committed" critic at the present time? EWS The context of those phrases from Beginnings is a brief discussion of Lukacs, which I'II recapitulate here. Without actually knowing them, Lukacs had divined the gist of Marx's views in the 1844 Manuscripts: that Marx had tried first to recog- nize, then to overcome the barriers separating man from his work. Out of that analysis, which aside from its perspicacity was a remarkable act of predictive intel- ligence, Lukacs devised his theses on alienation, reification and class consciousness. More controversially, however, Lukacs was attempting to show the extent to which a revolutionary gesture could be made as a metamorphosis from one sort of con- sciousness to another; he was attacked, and still is attacked, by many Marxists for what is considered to be his idealism on this score. We needn't debate that point here, of course, but we must acknowledge that Lukacs was demonstrating the im- portance, I think, of seeing that if you separate what you do from what you are, 36</page><page sequence="8">you are reifying, giving objectivistic form to things that in reality don't have that form; or if they do, have it in such a way as to require its overcoming. Thus to inter- pret man's work (as a laborer, literary critic, engineer, or whatever) as radically and organically connected with what man is and a whole entity (despite the fact that his consciousness cannot recognize or accept the connection) is the common and revolutionary point of departure both for the interpreter as interpreter and, Lukacs tried also to show, for the proletariat as re-interpreter and upsetter of bourgeois reification. My interest in these analyses by Lukacs is complex, but what immediately con- cerns us here is what they mean for criticism. I don't think one ought to jump sud- denly to prescriptions for committed critics. There is the matter first of what we mean by committed. I can go into that as a political issue later, although we need to specify what world we're talking about; indeed the whole notion of worldliness, so far as the literary critic is concerned, is very important and problematic for me. But we can use Lukacs's observation to assert that criticism is radically miscon- ceived if it tries to reify a) the critic, b) the text, c) criticism. To treat each of those as if detachable from the others and from society and history is to impose on them a status they have only in their weakest and most rarified form. This is not by any means to say that a text is interchangeable with a lawn-mower, or that a critic and criticism are equivalent to what factory workers do. But one of the consequences of the technicalization, systematization, and functionalism of con- temporary avant-garde criticism is the assumption that writing and reading can be truly separated from the circumstances that either enable or produce them. It is true that analytically they perhaps ought to be separated, but it is gross miconnais- sance to believe that the analytic exigency can become, or indeed is, the reality. On the one hand, you have the scientistic tendency in criticism. One can associate that with the strict semioticians, some stylisticians, theorists of the self- sufficient text, and anyone who believes that criticism, by virtue of its subject matter and its instruments, can acquire the precision of a science. Aside from being completely incorrect about the precision of science-all you need to do is to read historians of science like Bernal, Kuhn, Canguihelm, Holton as well as scientists themselves to realize that the human and social circumstances of scientific work are notoriously imprecise determinants of that work in ways that humanists (and even scientists) haven't adequately dealt with-this view mischievously arrogates to the critic and his system powers neither possesses. In fact to turn the text into a message-bearing or purely rhetorical system, and the critic into a scientist of such matters, is to create a fantasy whose main purpose is the aggrandizement of the critic in his own eyes. On the other hand, you have the more subtle tendency amongst avant-garde cirtics to discuss texts as something to be "deconstructed" from within. Derrida himself is a brilliant philosopher and critic, and he can't be responsible for what people have made of his notions. But to use the deconstructive techniques as a substitute for genetic analysis is, I think, a serious error in perception and judgment. Nothing in a text merely occurs or happens; a text is made-by the author, the critic, the reader-and it is a collective enterprise to a certain extent, as Goldmann used to say indefatigably. To an even greater extent than that, however, a text is a process, not a thing; this is one of the main arguments of Beginnings, especially as I was also trying to demonstrate the connection between a text's materiality (as process) and the human effort expended on its behalf. Now the "committed" critic must be willing to face these things, to deal with them intellectually, and in some ways to incorporate them within his work as a critic. To use words like "demystification" and "deconstruction" as if they applied to texts divorced from human reality, or to suggest-as Derrida has done since I'Ecriture et la diffrence-that myths such as "logocentrism" exist at large in West- ern culture, is to deny the very human ground from which these things spring. I do not think that what I am proposing is a degeneration either into vulgar Marxism or hortatory humanism. I feel that the whole notion of a beginning would be emasculated of its strength if it were taken as advocating a "pure" beginning that stood apart from the dialectical actualities and circumstances which surrounds us, implicate us, as human beings and as critics. Of course I believe that a critic must analytically be able to separate, demarcate, limit what he does, and detach the text from its surroundings. But our great failing as critics today is that we seem never able to re-connect, rejoin our analyses, our critefacts as I call them, to the society, agencies or lives from which they derive. One of the great tonic observations made by Vico is about what he called the vanity (boria) of the philologists and philos- ophers: both classes, he said, saw what they found in texts through a purely textual perspective, as if that perspective was the world. , ;*, ' i j7 ,-r ~ f4r Ot~ ?It Al It 1.4 ~1\16 IL IL ii'c v !f i Iti 1I r 1, [ Ill \(I , '? r .?~ii rr* it I ?i11 I, i f "-2 , !. . diocritics/Fall 1976 37</page><page sequence="9">DIACRITICS You appear to view the concept of world and worldliness as a potential mode or lever of articulation which would allow the academic critic to position his work on texts in relation to social and political questions. Can you elaborate on the use- fulness and/or polemical thrust of the concept of worldliness as you are using it? What is the importance of the ambiguity-worldliness as being-in-this-world, as mundane objectality, materiality, sociality, versus worldliness as the indice of urbane culture, secularity, sophistication-of the term? EWS If one has had any direct dealings in or intercourse with the real world of pol- itics, where power is what informs everything, one will realize first of all that the literary academic has no worldly political status to speak of. I would say in fact that a literary professional whose main base of operation is the university must realize that he exists in a condition of institutionalized marginality, so far as the system of political power is concerned. Of course we cannot deny that as teachers of literature, as disseminators of high culture, as transmitters of civilization (pick your favorite function) we do introduce and keep alive irrefutable things in the life of society. As Lionel Trilling once said, there is a mind of society, and it is this mind that we address, tutor, doctor, inform, evaluate, criticize, reform. Our role is highly mediated and subtle, insidious even, but as a class of people our impact on the on-going life of society in its day-to-day and even long-term affairs is very diffuse, hence minimal. Unlike social scientists, we cannot play-and there is no machinery for us to employ if we wanted to play-the role of consultants to busi- ness, industry, or government. No member of our profession has achieved political prominence. To some extent we are technicians doing a very specialized job; to a certain degree also we are keepers'of, kept by, and tutors to the middle and upper classes, although a great deal of what we are interested in as students of literature is necessarily subversive of middle class values. The point is that institutionally, uni- versity literary critics/scholars are de-fused, and held nicely in check. There are exceptions to what I have been saying. Recent-or post-World War One-history in this country during a few periods here and there shows literary academics enjoying greater political prominence than the low influence I've just described. Certainly during the period of dissent occasioned by the Vietnam War in the '60s some literary academics achieved national importance as part of a na- tional resistance to imperialist war. And MLA was forced to accept a relationship between worldly affairs and academic ones, but even then we worked by analogy; that is, since there was an announced revulsion from university complicity in such things as counter-insurgency, "scientific" and political warfare, literary academics tended to make an analogy between themselves and their colleagues in the social and hard sciences. The scientists' guilt was also theirs as teachers of literature. Certainly there were no publicly-known instances of literary people employed to practice counter-insurgency, and if there was a literary adviser to the electronic battlefield his name (or position) still isn't known: so there was contentment with arguments inculpating (or purifying) us by analogy, and there was much silliness since a general guilt could come and go with equal ease. One thing that did not get debated by academic literary people was the responsibility of an intellectual in a time of crisis, particularly his role in making or defining the crisis (I'm think- ing of such concrete matters as the connection between the CIA and Encounter, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, etc.). We have made the distinction between the profession of literature and intellectual life much too rigid. It's hard to tell now what the lasting results of the Vietnam period are. Some literature was pro- duced: the work of Kampf, Roszak, Ohmann, and a handful of others. But certainly also there was no contribution to a theoretical literature that treated the relation- ship between literary criticism and worldly politics, at least no contribution that has made a great impact. We seem now to have gone back to a time of quiescence. I very much doubt that anyone now will think of writing a book like Jonah Raskin's Mythology of Imperialism which, if you do not allow yourself to be sidetracked by its needlessly obtrusive rhetoric, is a very intelligent work. Not that imperialism has disappeared; it's gone away for the academic intellectual who has returned to writing within a fairly circumscribed political range. The contributions to theory in literary study have left out the role of institutions in literature. Even the semioticians have been extremely remiss about this. As for the rest of the avant- garde, literature for it has been a matter of texts, more texts, and still more texts. Most literary critics, particularly those of the avant-garde, think of themselves as technical critics, as technicians, if you like. It doesn't by any means go without 38</page><page sequence="10">saying that being a technical, advanced critic means that you think of yourself as an intellectual in the widest social sense of that word. Far from it. Indeed I think the extent to which-as I said earlier-the critical avant-garde is politically quietistic is a precise dialectical mid-point between, on the one hand, their political margin- ality and, on the other, their unwillingness to be general intellectuals. If we have not had a Gramsci or a Lukacs to analyze class consciousness or the intellectuals as a class, we have had (and still do have) Marxist groups within MLA and within the profession. (I am confining myself to organized groups.) I have a great deal of sympathy for what they are trying to do, but I think it is a fundamental misjudgment of reality to base one's political work on an unsituated effort to show that Marxism is principally a reading technique. To say that Marxism cognitively and analytically can produce excellent readings of important nineteenth century novels is not in question: how can one deny it? What I am saying is that the doing of Marxist literary analysis alone cannot constitute the basis of a political program in the great world. And to turn a literary or intellecual project immediately into a political one is to try to do something quite undialectical. But to accept the form of action prescribed in advance by one's professional status-which in the system of things is institutionalized marginality-is to restrict oneself politically and in advance. I'm not trying to be dogmatic about all this, but I do feel that we all have a tendency to closet ourselves amongst each other, and what seems important to us as a class gets promoted into an issue of world-historical importance. One of the arguments I was trying to articulate in Beginnings is that each critic needs in some way to fashion for himself a point of departure that allows him to proceed con- cretely along a given course of work. According to that notion then, such forms as the novel, such objects as "the text," such praxes as criticism, are constitutive meth- ods for creating work and "covering" their own beginnings with inevitability and a posteriori logic. I was also interested not only in the transformations of which the idea of beginning is capable, but also in demonstrating (at a very theoretical level) how concrete circumstances and highly abstract appetites (and even fictions) can combine to provide one with an intentional method of formulating projects for oneself. I was examining the way in which one launches himself from con- templation to a sort of worldly action, although I didn't then (and don't now) pre- tend for a moment that reading and writing are in themselves other-worldly; of course they're not, but the question is how are they in the world, and how can they be in the world-a terrifyingly complex question. Much of the answer to that is left very implicit in the book, although the last chapter (on Vico) takes it up overtly. I think it would be extremely presumptuous to try to spell out what critics, committed or otherwise, should be doing, so I won't try. But I can talk a little about these matters, in particular the notion of worldliness, as they appear to me, for me. In the first place, I think we must recognize the marginality of our roles and, more important, that for the first time we are facing some dramatic, explicit impositions on us that make us more marginal as a class. The university, in particular its liberal arts division, is shrinking. Worse yet, our graduate students cannot find jobs, they find themselves standing uselessly before a closed door. We find ourselves torn therefore: what we do as professional scholars/teachers/ critics narrows in its focus and its technicality, it is influential amongst students who in turn may not have jobs; what is our response to be? In the second place, the world itself is shrinking. This is a cheerful Mc- Luhanesque truism only if you think of the world as a problem of communications between its parts. But if you reflect that we face economic shortages of the most catastrophic sort, and that the great line separating the world today is between rich and poor, or North and South, or developed and developing nations, all com- peting for such basics as food and resource materials, the shrinking world appears rather a menacing place. In the U. S. we belong to a scandalously wasteful society, which consumes double and even triple its numerical share of resources. In addi- tion, we are the strong man of the world economy (incidentally the idea of a world economy-as Immanuel Wallerstein has studied it-is an extremely important one), and our sense of things (what we call the economic order) is supported by fantastic economic strength, a network of unimaginably powerful institutions (see Barnet and MUller's Global Reach, or Pierre's Jal~e's work, or Harry Magdoff's The Age of Im- perialism), and a complex system of forces for imposing ourselves on the world, thereby guaranteeing our economic well-being. If you read what Geoffrey Barra- clough has been writing recently you will see exactly what I mean. In the third place, we are--or pretend we are-universalists in our cultural values. In fact, however, we are ethnocentric to a fault. Everything we say or do as teachers of literature applies principally to the Atlantic cultures, which are under- diccritics/Fall 1976 39</page><page sequence="11">standably privileged for us. Our whole sense of literary and cultural history is based on what the Egyptian sociologist Anwar Abdel Malek has called the hegemonism of possessing minorities. Consider, for example, that between 1815 and 1918 European territorial dominion increased from about 40% to 85% of the world's total surface. Anthropocentrism is "naturally" associated with Europeocentrism. Today territorial control has been transmuted into economic and social control. In the fourth place, what goes on in the developing, or Southern, or Third or Fourth worlds scarcely occupies attention, or if it does we are unable to make it mesh with what we do as scholars/critics/teachers. I do not believe that we should become Regis Debrays or that the barricades are where we belong. The problem for us is much more dialectical than that, presuming of course that we don't a) turn our backs on the whole world and b) declare war on it. Perhaps the la- mentable Daniel Moynihan does speak for the literary academics: I doubt it, but surely he doesn't speak for all of them. Nevertheless, I think we must somehow take in the realities of the U.S.'s position in the world. Now it is very hard for a critic to assess the role or the place of his writing in "the world." I've just been speaking of "the world"-very quickly and schematically of course-and it doesn't require a Voltaire to tells us that as authors of books on beginnings, or Hardy's poetry, or Spenser's imagery, the world isn't too much with us at all. What is left to a critic's work if you take away from it in advance any serious impact it might have on the world? To a certain extent the critic will be left with worldliness, in the second sense, worldliness as the index of urbane culture, secularity, sophistication, all of which are signified by critical interchange, critics reviewing other critics, and so forth. In such a world the issues of greatest conse- quence will be what one critic says about another, the assertion of priorities, values, and imperatives that have the stamp on them of scholastic hermeticism. I haven't any doubt that a certain amount of this sort of worldliness is our lot as critics; the question is how else we can engage with the larger world, and do things there that our peculiar, not to say eccentric, capacities and training suit us for. If we disabuse ourselves of the idea that "writing" is something that can be reduced unilaterally, terminally and univocally to an "author" we open a new avenue of approach to the world. This has been Foucault's great discovery. Writing is not free, nor is it performed uniquely by a sovereign writer who writes more or less as he pleases. Writing belongs to a system of utterances that has all sorts of affiliative, often constricting relationships with the world of nations, as Vico called it. One can see this most clearly in scholarly writing, or writing that belongs to such disciplines as history, sociology, economics and philology, disciplines in which the individual writer is born very heavily upon by institutions, rituals, exclusions, pro- hibitions, and a highly particularized, even tyrannical conception of truth and the desire for truth. As I intimated earlier, such disciplines as literary criticism are policed and kept "authentic" by methods that limit what one can say and still be considered as doing literary criticism; it is not a matter of seemliness only, but also a question of the discipline's sense of its own identity, which it must fight- from within and without the field-to preserve. A critic who uses psychoanalysis threatens lit. crit. by stepping beyond boundaries, saying what shouldn't be said, and-if he is like Bloom-doing it with a kind of wounding intimacy. Let me be a good deal more specific, although I shall have to be confining myself to the limited area I know best. As I mentioned above i have been very concerned about our distance as professionals in this country from the rest of the world. It is too simple to say that most academic critics are lazy esthetes who prefer to contemplate Tennyson than to muck about with the issues raised by Fanon or Barrington Moore. If you have the fortune (or misfortune, depending on your out- look) to know another part of the world-in my case the Near Orient, Arab and Islamic society-you begin to wonder what, except for a mere caricature of that important yet exotic and distant reality, has filtered through into Western society. It's not enough to say that obviously a "foreign" and non-western part of the world can't be well-known; it's much more interesting and valuable to know how and why it is as badly-known as it is. In his book on Western knowledge about Islam in the Middle Ages, R. W. Southern makes a superb observation: there was ignor- ance about islam, he said, but it was a complex ignorance, and it can be studied actively as a form of positive knowledge about Islam. 40</page><page sequence="12">You can see where that leads-straight to the kind of observation Nietzsche made repeatedly, that knowledge and the will to knowledge are inseparable, and together they are interested, systematic, powerful interpretations. In the case of the Orient they did not take place in the abstract. I began to study the "Orient" or what I call the Orientalizations of the Orient. This led me to a study not only of Oriental- ist philology, but also of history, geography, religion, indeed all those branches of Western knowledge whose principal concern is the Orient. In so doing I was con- sidering such things as the relationship between the rise of Orientalism in the early nineteenth century, the growth of Orientalist institutions (societies, exploration and translation funds, academic departments), the increasingly powerful commercial, dip- lomatic and finally military colonial presence in the Orient, and the work of a number of major artists, including Flaubert, Nerval, Lane, Burton, Disraeli, Hugo, Goethe and so forth. You could pick up a text by Renan, for example, and see in it the network of predatory interests (interests by the way are always created: one should study how they are created, and for what reasons) that connected him with Gobineau, with the French diplomatic service, comparative anatomy, and so forth- all of them encroaching upon, then finally eliminating from the Western Orientalist mind anything but a schematic essentialization which was called "the Orient." A major part of my study has been the way in which Orientalist texts are attempts at textual reconstruction of the Orient, as if the "real" or actual Orient ought not by itself to be admitted into Western consciousness; one sees this in Napoleon's Description de I'Egypte, later in Sylvestre de Sacy's chrestomathies, later still in Lane's and Flaubert's tableaux. The focus of interest in Orientalism for me has been the partnership between a discursive and archival textuality and worldly power, one as an index and refrac- tion of the other. As a systematic discourse Orientalism is written knowledge, but because it is in the world and directly about the world, it is more than knowl- edge: it is power since, so far as the Oriental is concerned, Orientalism is the operative and effective knowledge by which he was delivered textually to the West, occupied by the West, milked by the West for his resources, humanly quashed by the West. From such Baconian realizations it is not difficult to see, for example, that most knowledge of something gets into texts according to historical laws, social and economic forces, worldly circumstances which make for important and urgent study. Particularly to a literary critic today, who because of his institutionalized marginality seems content with being a commentator from the outside on what transpires in the world. Our interpretive worldly-wisdom has been applied, in a sense, to everything except ourselves; we are brilliant at de- constructing the mystifications of a text, at elucidating the blindness of a critical method, but we have seemed unable to apply these techniques to the very life of texts in the world, their materiality, their capacity for the production of misery or liberation, their monumentality as Foucault has spoken of it. As a result we are mesmerized by the text, and convinced that a text is only a text, without realizing how saying that is not only naive, it is worldly-blind. To re-integrate himself with worldly actuality, the critic of texts ought to be investigating the system of discourse by which the "world" is divided, administered, plundered, by which human'ity is thrust into pigeonholes, by which "we" are "human" and "they" are not, and so forth. We will discover that even so innocuous a discipline as philology has played a crucial role in the process. Most important, we should be intent upon revealing the secrecy, the privatizations of texts whose circumstantial thickness and complicity are covered by the other-worldly prestige of art or of "mere" textuality. DIACRITICS In tracing the evolution of the concept of "philology" do you see a contradic- tion between the view that all nations are equal as human beings (Herder) and the hierarchical view of nations implied by the "language tree." EWS On the face of it, yes there is a contradiction. Isaiah Berlin has just written a study of Vico and Herder that claims for Herder the credit of being a cultural pluralist who was opposed to cultural nationalism and the hierarchical divisions be- tween cultures. That is only part of the truth. The early Herder was typical of the period in conflating the "Orient" with Old Testament history. Between 1769 and 1774 he was converted to a wider view of the Orient, which included Persia, Egypt and Phoenicia, and this world he identified with primitivity. Yet by the middle '80s, at a time when texts like Anquetil-Duperron's Zend and Sanskrit translations were being diffused, he became a defender of Greek art; in the Ideen he was saying quite specifically that the Hellenic aesthetic was preferable to the Asiatic for a European, and one can find numerous attacks in his later work on the theocratic and despotic practices of Oriental peoples. What I think we must note in Herder is the tendency diacritics/Fall 1976 41</page><page sequence="13">always to compare the Oriental unfavorably with the Occidental, and that is almost always the practice of universalizing sciences like philology and comparative gram- mar in the early nineteenth century. Both Schlegels did it, Humboldt did it, Renan did it, Bopp did it. Yet of course no comparison of that sort is innocent or value-free. My sense of the comparative tendency which led to the hierarchies of language trees and families is that it is rooted in a desire to valorize three things, 1) the present (or a particular aspect of the present) 2) Europe and 3) the science itself. Consider Schlegel. In his 1808 book on the Indians he shows the affinities between Greek and Sanskrit roots, then the affinities between both of those and modern European languages. His idea of the Orient is that it is a classical and immensely distant realm, yet whose influence lingers now only amongst the modern European lan- guages, and hence civilizations. The Orient is not at all a place where modern Orientals live, work, produce; it is a hypostasis cloistered away from the real modern world, but the prestige of its "originality" is transferred onto Europe, which has produced the thinkers whose techniques-in this case those of comparative philology- allow it to be appreciated and used. Thus the phrase Indo-European was made of two unequal parts: the first half is sunk in the past, the second is vital, enterprising, and resourceful. It is said of Bopp's disciples that they used frequently to quarrel over whether Indo-European ought to be changed to Indo-Germanic: one can see the pernicious nationalism involved, but it was inevitable, I think, once philology made qualitative distinctions between the various language families, and once modernity was associated with the European e'tat present. For Schlegel, and indeed for all the philologists in that tradition, Indo- European was distinct from Semitic: the latter was agglutinative (the language worked by a system of roots to which were added suffixes and prefixes), it lacked germinative power, it could not perform aesthetic functions. The former was lively, aesthetic, seminal, organic. In that linguistic distinction (if that is what it was) you have the seed of racial theory, since it was not hard to build racial types out of the linguistic discriminations. Every philologist during the nineteenth century made the same distinctions over and over again. In his The Aryan Myth Leon Poliakov has studied the symbiosis between racism and such notions as an Aryan type, whose features are those of a hypothetical Indo-European language "set." But Poliakov doesn't make enough of the fact that so far as Europe was concerned "the Semites" were not only the Jews but also the Muslims, and that the whole intellectual pro- gram devoted to proving Oriental (i.e. Semitic) degeneracy was practically effective in legitimating the colonial occupation of the entire Orient. But such is the intellec- tual fashion today that one simply closes one's eyes to that part of reality not in consonance with one's immediate goals. It's ironic too that a book like Poliakov's, which is an attack on racial theory, leaves out that part of history which shows how almost incredibly wide was the net used to gather in Orientals and Semites. But I'm digressing. If we return to your question then we can see paradoxically that notions of equality based on the idea of "different nations" and all the invidious qualitative judgments made about the inequality of nations and races, these two go together. To a large extent, the reason they go together is a matter of power, whose rhetorical symbol is the word "humanity." Whenever "humanity" or "mankind" was used it seemed immediately to reflect the truth that its user spoke for, could speak for, mankind, at the expense of most of mankind, which couldn't. There's an im- portant study yet to be done by critics on the deployment of generalizations, particularly anthropomorphic generalizations, in nineteenth century European lit- erature. I'm sure one will find that from the romantics on literary production and political discriminations of the sort I've been discussing, fortify and feed each other. DIACRITICS The figure of the Exotic in western thought has usually contained the "Caliban" problematic, i.e., the Exotic as a non- or marginally communicative being func- tioning in the super-imposed, dominant language. This inarticulateness can result in rebellion or submission, but never in the assimilation of the oppressed into the dominant culture. How do you view this question of language in the light of writers (such as yourself) who are forced to accept the language of colonialism as your/ their means of expression? 42</page><page sequence="14">EWS You've touched on a rich and complex question. One thing it reminds me of immediately is how at Joyce's funeral in Zurich the British ambassador there, Lord Derwent, patronised Joyce (perhaps unconsciously) by intimating that for an Irish- man Joyce gave the good old English language a glorious shaking-up-I think that's the expression Derwent used. How ironic, since from beginning to end of his career Joyce was troubled by the fact that (as he put it most memorably in The Portrait) Ben Jonson's language was not his, and words like "Christ," "ale," "master" did not come naturally or first to him. I remember also the remark made by Aim6 Cesaire that in praising him once Breton also commented on how amazing it was that Cesaire used French like a Frenchman: the barb was no doubt mainly in Cesaire's mind, but it was real. Fanon has had much to say about language as a symbol of power for the oppressed, principally in his early works, although it re- turns as a motif in Les Damnes de la terre. I might also mention a series of recent works in French (e.g. Balibar and Laporte, Le Franpais national, Louis-Jean Calvet, Linguistique et colonialisme: petit trait6 de glottophagie, various papers by Gillian Sankoff) that try to deal with the socio-cultural pressures involved in language use, particularly as they impinge from the center onto peripheral or colonial groups. The earlier work of Marcel Cohen and Henri Lefebvre is also important in this regard. The political problem of language has gone through two phases, I think. First you have the period when (as was the case with Algeria) the native writer was francophone (or anglophone) without any alternative: of course there was a native Arabic tradition, but that was not supposed to be for the world, but for such arcane subjects as the law, or the hadith, and so on. I mentioned above how carefully the colonizer made the colonial native speak his language either as an exhibit or as a sign of tribute to the strong or politically dominant society: I think we have to think in terms of making someone speak, in much the same punitive sense that Foucault has studied (in Surveiller et punir) the imposition of orthographic or penal disciplines upon European students and convicts respectively during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. When the local or native language was studied in the colonies it was always imprisoned within the perspective of a dead or classical language; what the untutored native spoke was a kitchen language, nothing more. Because of the educational system the bourgeoisie adopted English or French, with a good deal of self-conscious pride and also a sense of the distance that separated the class both from the colonial master and from the unfortunate peasant. The second phase can be sub-divided into two parts. First there is a gener- alized awareness that the colonial language can be used to attack the system of political control-Fanon speaks of this in much detail. Then, the second part, when an abrupt shift to the native language is a symbol of determined resistance to colonial oppression. In Algeria this took place when political agitation against the French included studying and then using Arabic. As a result Algerians today speak a kind of Arabic that is a sort of cross between a spoken dialect and the classical, or written, language. Most other Arabs-with the exception, I think, of the Pales- tinians whose experience is similar in many ways to the Algerians-move uneasily between the classical and the dialect, which are very widely separated. English and French today are world-languages. Arabic is either a local demotic or a liturgical language, but one of the great seminal moments in the history of modern Arabic politics was when Abdel Nasser used his speeches as the occasion to attack colonialism in the native Egyptian dialect. Not only was he avoiding the straight-jacketing effect of the classical (which Orientalism had legislated into a kind of other-worldly uselessness, so much so that even many Arabs believed the myth) but he was also turning on Britain and France on his own terms, on his own linguistic terrain, so to speak. This is much more impressive a thing than it sounds, particularly when you remember, for example, that the constitutions of at least two Arab countries were originally written not in Arabic but in a European language, and when you consider too that the historical archives of several of the Arab states exist only in London and in English. Add too the fact that there exists in Europe a vast cache of Arabic texts, removed out of the Arab world by the colonial powers during the nineteenth century. Here Foucault's theory of the archive and discourse acquires a very material dimension; the archive of much of modern Arab history resides unmetaphorically, has been deposited in, has been physically imprisoned by, Europe.

They obviously find it hard to deal with situations in which they are late-comers intellectually to Marxist or other ideas useful in attacking the same culture that produced both Marxism and colonialism. Originality takes on a rather different meaning in such a curious context than it would if one were "first": this is why I find Bloom's charts of influence, and his ideas about strong and weak, first-coming and ephebe poets so suggestive. There is no doubt that the great cultural and political question facing the Third World generally, and the Arab world in particular, is the articulation of inde- pendence-the verbal metaphor here is very central-and the struggle for intel- ligibility. As a world-language English has a rather menacing side when it is ex- ported, it can (and does) produce a new illiteracy, as Blackmur used to call it, which, when it is allied with the Third World desire for technical expertise and with the transistorization of intelligence, makes the language a new form of op- pression and enslavement. For if Orientalism was a language whose codes and grids filtered through a schematic Orient for Western consumption, it is also true that the West filters through what schematically ought to be known about itself to the Orient. That Third World and Arab intellectuals can attack these schemata today is a tribute to the trans-discursive power in Freud, Marx and others. My own work at present is focussed on situating, placing, materializing the discourse of Orientalism: revealing its structures, characterizing it as a language whose institutional and disciplinary presence eliminated, displaced the Oriental as human and put in his place the Orient Orientalized as specimen. I feel myself to be clearing the library of such possessing languages as those of Orientalism, making it possible for myself as an Oriental, and for other Orientals, to speak, using whatever language we feel we need to use. In short, I am writing a work that could be read in either English or Arabic. DIACRITICS As I see it, you seem constantly to emphasize that the basic error (more pre- cisely the ideological distortion) of Western thinking is its belief in a meaningless "Oriental" cultural heritage: Inferior language, underdeveloped mentality, no his- tory (or if there is an "Oriental" history, it is always one written by the Westerner for the benefit of the Oriental-who is incapable of writing his own) and finally no "Oriental" literary tradition. Is this last point historically true? Has here been an evolution in the literature produced in Arabic over the years (such as the European novel for instance)? Finally, what role is contemporary literary and artistic produc- tion playing in the recent social and political transformations of Arab consciousness among Arab societies? How does it reflect recent changes in the Arab context? EWS Actually I find the Orientalist turning the Orient into something overly mean- ingful, making the Orient say things, tell things about itself that no region, much less a people or a religion could signify in so schematic and cut-and-dried a way. Renan said that the Semitic mind was "une combinaison inf~rieure de la nature humaine" he didn't say that it, or the Orient that produced it, was meaningless. One of the dominant motifs in what Edgar Quinet called the Oriental Renaissance of the European nineteenth century was the over-estimation of the Orient; Benjamin Constant has some shrewd observations on that phenomenon in his Journal Intime. But it is true that the Orientalist, and indeed the European in general, got used to the idea of telling the world, including the Orient itself, what the Orient really meant, and I'm sure you'll find much the same thing happening as "orientals" to- day tell each other what the "West" is all about. The noteworthy thing about Orientalism was that interpreting the Orient very soon turned into speaking for the Orient (silencing it) as after 1798 the Orient was militarily an occupied territory. Of course all this went on for the benefit of the Oriental, as you put it, who was never consulted, much less involved in such interpretations. I think you must re- member that Orientalism thought of itself as doing what it did in spite of the Oriental. 44</page><page sequence="16">Most Arabs would agree, I think, that what has mattered most to Arab cul- ture, aside from Islam itself, is literature. The high point of that literature since the Hegira and until the late nineteenth century was the Abbasid period, between the 8th and the 13th centuries AD. Between the Abbasids and the modern period there are moments of some literary importance (18th century chroniclers, for ex- ample, specialized prose and poetry forms, etc.) but on the whole it isn't a stretch of time with much going on in it that is very memorable, not in my opinion at least, and my opinion is somewhat provincial and not that of a scholar on the subject. I can't possible go into the Abbasid period here; that would be like trying to talk about the European Renaissance in a paragraph. But yes, it was an extremely rich and stunningly innovative period in Arabic letters. The great difficulty for the Western reader, say a comparatist, is that in order to talk about the literature he would have to be paraphrasing and translating constantly, as so little of it is known. But that's only one problem. The other problem is that Orientalism for the most part has had very little to do with Arabic literature, or at least with literature as in some way an expression of Arab life. This is one of the most remarkable things about Orientalism as a doc- trine, and to a certain extent determined me to write my-study of Orientalism. One has the impression that every Orientalist has considered the Arabs as an exem- plification of the Koran, or what the Orientalists claim the Koran said: methodolog- ically, this is the equivalent of writing a history of the United States as an illustration of the New Testament. When you consider even the name of the field-Oriental- ism, or its subdivisions, like Islam or Arabism-you will not be able to find a sym- metrical field to it; no one professes Occidentalism for example, and no one will consider a study of Christianity to be a substitute for the study of Shakespeare, or of Saint-Simon, or of American history in the nineteenth century. But these are regular practises in Orientalism. Statistically, I am positive you will find literature to be the least represented of the Orientalist sub-specialities, for obvious reasons, since literature muddles the tidy categories invented for Oriental life by Orientalists. The plain fact is that Orientalists do not know how to read, and therefore happily ignore literature. When you come to the modern period, a much more serious distortion arises. As with all national resurgences the various movements of Arab revolution that begin in the post-World War era rely very heavily for their popular diffusion and mass mobilization upon literature; consequently there has been a tremendous development in all branches of Arabic literature. Read any book written in the West .on the modern Arabs and you will never find literature mentioned, much less studied. Most Middle East experts today are social scientists whose expertise is based on a handful of cliches about Arab society, Islam and the like, handed down like tatters, from the nineteenth century Orientalists. A whole new vocabu- lary of terms is bandied about: modernization, elites, development, stability are talked about as possessing some sort of universal validity, but in fact they form a rhetorical smokescreen hiding ignorance of the area. The new Orientalist jargon is hermetic discourse, whose wisdom cannot prepare one, for example, for what happens today in Lebanon, or in the'Israeli-occupied Arab territories, or all through the life of the Middle Eastern people. In short the presence of Orientalism means the absence of any interest in Oriental literature as an integral part of a society's development. You can get a much better idea of what is going on anywhere in the Arab world by reading five recent poems, novels or essays than by reading a whole shelf of publications put out by the Middle East Institute, or the Rand Corporation, or by any avowed Orientalist who teaches the Middle East in the various Oriental studies departments across the country. But this should not sur- prise you if you know anything about either literature or Orientalism. If you regard Orientalism as a system of representations of the Orient, then it should be clear why one of its functions was to avoid literature; such systems hide the human being who is the object of study from history-Sheila Rowbotham's phrase for what happens to women in bourgeois society is appropriate for the Oriental too. (The parallels between Orientals, blacks and women are striking of course). It has seemed to me useful to recall Marx's phrase for Louis Napoleon in the 18th Brumaire; speaking of Louis's claim to represent the underdeveloped small holding peasants, Marx says ironically, "They cannot represent themselves; diQcritics /Fall 1976 45</page><page sequence="17">they must be represented." This perfectly expresses the Orientalist's attitude to the Oriental, with the difference only that the Oriental was the victim of total political and cultural usurpation, and of military rule to boot. The banishment of literature is accordingly inevitable. DIACRITICS If it is (somewhat) true that politica manent, what about the volatility of pres- ent schools of criticism? They usually specify strong political concerns and sympathies, but their lifespan is brief and usually extinguished within critical strife: how is this situation compatible with the necessary duration of political action? EWS Doubtless political action and critical schools live according to different calen- dars, so to speak. Yet a political group or grouping (like a party) express its soli- darity with a cause and with itself in very explicit ways, and this is something literary schools today do not do. There are much looser affiliations between critics who think of themselves as allied than between members of a party or political action group, so the difference in time-span that you speak about is a function of that principally, and not necessarily of the duration of a political cause. A critic, even if he feels himself to be a member of a literary school or tendency, still thinks of what he does not as cooperative, but as something individual, and individualized. Of course this is a dilemma for the critic, this conflict between the larger ambience of which he is a part and the relatively isolated exercise of his gifts of interpreta- tion, intuition, or whatever: it is difficult to find a way out of it, and I'm not sure one easily can. A related problem is the extent to which criticism can be systematized; one of the fascinations with semiotics, for instance, is that the rules of analysis seem not to be dependent on an individual, but rather upon a community of interpreters. I recall Barthes speaking somewhere about an ideal of semiotic research as in some way cooperative and impersonal. Another aspect of systematic criticism is the problem of whether or not the critic ends up by doing his analysis in a fairly predictable way. You could take Northrop Frye's essay on Dickens as a case in point, and simply say of it that it is typically Frye-esque. But over and above such temptations as systematics dangle before us, there is surely a residual hedonism in every critical act, which may consist in going against oneself or one's system, or perhaps in quite deliberately freeing oneself of one's past attachments and habits and alliances. Barthes has made a whole career of this. I doubt that other critics would want to strip themselves of this privilege, even though it is very circum- scribed. Schools and systems often exist as a method for warding off such even- tualities, and that is why I am temperamentally anti-systemic and anti-school. I think that criticism is fundamentally an activity of discovery and cognition, not of contemplation or of rigid theoretical imposition. In the latter there is always the danger of overlooking, or of never finding and experiencing the stray bit of his- torical evidence; but perhaps this is another way of saying that I find it especially instructive to ransack the archives, as it were. Aside from the pleasure this gives me, there is the main benefit of allowing theory to feel upon it the impress of material (or at least archival) reality. And this in turn stimulates additional refine- ment in theoretical activity. DIACRITICS Discussing the nature of the discipline ("Anthropology: its achievements and future"), Livi-Strauss declared a few years ago that anthropology was the daughter of an era of violence: "its capacity to assess more objectively the facts pertaining to the human condition reflects, on the epistemological level, a state of affairs in which one part of mankind treated the others as an object . . . It is not an account of its mental endowments that only the Western world has given birth to anthro- pology, but rather as a consequence of the fact that exotic cultures, treated by us as mere things, could be studied accordingly as things." Isn't your forthcoming book on orientalism (or rather on the myth of orientalism), an effort to denounce the kind of "anthropological imperialism" analyzed by Levi-Strauss? If so, how do you characterize the myth of orientalism (ideology, mentality, etc.)? How do you go about demythifying this myth? and from where do you, Edward Said, speak (or rather write)? 46</page><page sequence="18">EWS Orientalism isn't a myth, it's a myth-system with a mytho-logic, rhetoric, and institutions of its own. It is a machine for producing statements about the Orient and it can be studied historically and institutionally as a form of anthropological imperialism. The main point to be made about Orientalism is that it isn't simply a scholarly or imaginative kind of writing (what form is?) with no particular impor- tance for anyone but other Orientalists: it isn't. It pretends to scientific objectivity, and it is today a perfect instance of how knowledge and writing can be brought from the text, so to speak, to the world-with force and genuine political conse- quence. The Orient today is not the equivalent of a disappearing pre-literate tribe of the sort studied by Levi-Strauss; it is a region of the world with major policy implications for the Western world, the U.S. in particular. So what one studies is the execution and administration of textual knowledge for direct, in some cases, painfully direct political purposes. The limits of my study are, on the one hand, Orientalism as a pre-modern (pre-nineteenth century) system of imaginative geog- raphy and two, Orientalism as a modern discourse whose contemporary relevance is to what Harold Lasswell calls the policy sciences. I am interested in the process by which the first is converted into the second. My study is divided into three main parts. The first, "the Scope of Oriental- ism" attempts to characterize Orientalism as a family of ideas that have been in existence in the West since Herodotus, and which culminate in the rhetoric of Cromer, Balfour, Kissinger and other statesmen. For there is a common element in such ideas as Oriental despotism, Oriental sensuality, Oriental modes of production, and Oriental splendor. My focus is on the dialectic by which the Orient was repre- sented on what I call the Orientalist stage in the West, which until the eighteenth century took Islam to be the main Oriental type. Oriental knowledge during this period is to be found in such works as D'Herbelot's Bibliotheque orientale, the Divine Comedy, some of the medieval chronicles and in the various sacerdotal attempts (Peter the Venerable, Guibert of Nogent, Luther) to deal with the problem of Islam and Mohammed. These essentially religious works are in striking contrast with the first modern and racialist Orientalist projects, which date from after the linguistic discoveries of Jones and Anquetil; the two projects that I focus on are the Napoleonic expedition (and its learned arms, the Institut d'Egypte and the Description de I'Egypte) and de Lesseps Suez Canal authority. In the second part, "Orientalist structures and re-structures," I study the main philological, historical and imaginative writers on the Near Orient during the nineteenth century; my point of departure is Baron Dacier's Tableau de I'6rudition francaise, and I move thereafter to Hugo, Goethe, Renan, Sacy, Chateaubriand, Nerval, Lamartine, Lane, Burton, Flaubert, Doughty among others. The striking thing about all these writers is the reservoir of knowledge, imagery and motifs on which they consistently draw, and the way in which each in his own way tried to control the Orient through devices like the tableau, the florilege, the library, the classroom, and so forth. These devices in turn are operated simultaneously by the various religious, educational and diplomatic institutions in and for the Orient. Thus the structure of the Orientalist imagination is directly projected onto a colonial administration which in turn is converted directly into a system of rules, exclusions, prohibitions placed upon Orientals in the Orient: the three feed each other in a self-confirming process. Finally the third part, "Modern Orientalism," which is an account of how the British and French schools of Orientalism passed their learned legacies and effective techniques onto the American school, and how its dogmas in turn are reflected both in the reward and teaching structure of government and the academy in the U. S. today, as well as in the conduct of U. S. decision-making and foreign policy. Throughout the whole study I am at pains to show the way in which Oriental- ism was an eclectic system that absorbed, without actually modifying itself, the influences of such "strong" philosophies as positivism, Marxism, Darwinism, psycho- analysis, Spenglerism, and so forth. My polemical intention is to demonstrate how Orientalism is and was a way of being in the world, a way of making statements with authority, and-crucially-a form of disciplined ideological presence. This allows me to deal with the problems of knowledge and imagination, politics and writing, freedom and oppression in the relation between the developed and devel- oping worlds. These things quite clearly define the process of demystification or demythifica- tion as you call it. I feel myself to be writing from an interesting position. I am an Oriental writing back at the Orientalists, who for so long have thrived upon our silence. I am also writing to them, as it were, by dismantling the structure of their discipline, showing its meta-historical, institutional, anti-empirical, and ideo- logical biases. Finally, I feel myself to be writing for compatriots and colleagues about matters of common concern. diocritics /Fall 1976 47</page></plain_text>
