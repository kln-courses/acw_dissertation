<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poetics of Pragmatism: Robert Frost and William James W. DAVID SHAW THE most valuable teacher I had at Harvard," Robert Frost once said, "I never had. ... He was William James. His books meant a great deal to me."' Although, as Richard Poirier has observed, James's works "are a treasury of images of which Frost freely availed himself,"2 the interest of the affinities between the two men has less to do with conscious influence than with temperamental preference. On that very topic, James has much to offer, for he reminds us that any metaphysical formula is at once futile and fasci- nating because-like James's own pragmatism and like Frost's poetry-each is mainly a projection of an idiosyncratic way of feeling and talking about the world. In turn, that formula confirms the philosopher or poet in his existing habits of feeling and need. I believe, then, that we can understand more readily the habits of both writers as well as the psycho- logical roots of their philosophic and poetic uses of language by considering affinities between Frost's poems and the four books by James that he knew best: The Will to Believe, which Frost read and admired before entering Harvard in 1898; the one-volume text Psychology: Briefer Course, which he stud- ied as a Harvard sophomore and later assigned to his students at the Plymouth Normal School; Talks to Teachers on Psy- chology, another text assigned to his Plymouth students; and, l Lawrance Thompson and R.

Certain similarities center on Frost's pragmatic definition of words, and this intersection of Frost's and James's concerns seems a convenient point at which to begin an inquiry. James's celebrated contest between tough- and tender- minded philosophies can further serve to illuminate the clash of temperaments that Frost dramatizes in his most successful poems of debate; in addition, the competing claims of deter- minism and free will and of the uses and abuses of religious monism outlined by James in Pragmatism and The Will to Believe are also reflected in the poet's work. Exploring the theology of The Masque of Reason and The Masque of Mercy with the aid of The Will to Believe's seminal chapter on "Reflex Action and Theism," I shall argue finally that Frost's acceptance of a meliorist theology, poised somewhere be- tween cosmic optimism and cosmic despair, allows him in many of his best-known poems to engender truth upon a world that, in James's pregnant phrase, is waiting "to receive its final touches at our hands."3 Despite temperamental affinities between the two writers, important distinctions must be drawn as well. When Frost borrows the pragmatic idea of "making believe" or of judging by consequences, he displays little aptitude or need to "think" these ideas. As Richard Wollheim says, "the lesson, to be learnt only very slowly, is that philosophy has virtually noth- ing to offer those who would rifle it."4 Poets do not borrow the philosophers' methods but find different ways of satisfying the same needs. In this respect, the present study can reveal both what is basic to the urge to create a meaningful construct of any sort and what relates more specifically to the individ- ual's choice of discipline. 3 William James, "Pragmatism and Humanism," in Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking (London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911), p. 257. 4 Richard Wollheim, On Art and the Mind: Essays and Lectures (London: Alien Lane, 1973), p. ix.</page><page sequence="3">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM I. "All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing": The Consequence of Names C. S. Peirce argued that to determine the meaning of an idea we have only to consider "what effects that might con- ceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."5 Peirce's care- fully worded definition of meaning is turned by William James into a pragmatic definition of truth: "The possession of true thoughts means everywhere the possession of invaluable instruments of action."6 Many of Frost's poems explore the consequences of this pragmatic definition. One of its most striking corollaries is the impossibility of having a philosoph- ically or critically interesting theory about the "essential" or dictionary meaning of a word. As Frost's farmer observes in "The Mountain," words are unstable, and "'all the fun's in how you say a thing.'"'7 There is nothing universal or helpful to be said about what makes a vocabulary effective, any more than there is something profitable to be said about what makes an action true or good. To define the word "home," for example, in "The Death of the Hired Man," Warren translates the noun into a verbal chain that allows him to predict future actions: "'Home is the place where, when you have to go there, / They have to take you in."' And when Warren's wife further stresses that the use of a home does not have to be earned, she also pragmatically substitutes for the conventional dictionary definition a blueprint for action. "'I should have called it,"' she says, "'Something you some- how haven't to deserve."' In identifying the meaning of "home" with its use, both husband and wife can be seen as illustrating James's assertion that "if I am lost in the woods 5 C. S. Peirce, "How to Make Our Ideas Clear," Popular Science Monthly, January 1878; cited by John Passmore, "Pragmatism and Its European Analogues," in his A Hundred Years of Philosophy (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, 1968), p. 109. 6 James, "Pragmatism's Conception of Truth," in Pragmatism, p. 202.

The proper name is the dying mother's gift to her child. It originates as what Frost would call a trivial or grace metaphor, perhaps as a mere injunction: "'Be a good girl-be like a maple tree."' Because the meaning of a name, like the testing of a good metaphor in poetry, depends on the use to which it is put, the very oddity of Maple's name helps her friends engender truth upon it. Hav- ing no antecedent symbolic meaning proper to itself, the proper name "shrinks shyly," in Frost's words, "from antici- patory expression."'0 Had the girl told her husband in ad- vance that her name was Maple, his love for her might have diminished. But his divination of her personal mystery, of her being like a tree, without having known her proper name seems to be less an accident than an uncanny premonition of some truth about her nature that both he and the girl must will into being. So Frost makes us aware of the investment we have in proper nouns. The "strangeness" of the name "Maple" "lay / In having too much meaning. Other names, / . . . Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning, / But hadn't as it went." Meaning cannot be dissociated from the arbitrary interpretive process that motivates even proper nouns, whose odd quality is that they merely seem "proper." No proper name can escape the pathos of the capital letter, which tries to divest even a word like "Maple" of its indeter- minate properties. In Frost's poem "The Mountain," many of the most idio- syncratic and memorable qualities of the old farmer's speech 8 James, "Pragmatism's Conception of Truth," p. 203. 9 James, "Pragmatism and Humanism," p. 254. 10 Robert Frost, "The Constant Symbol," in Selected Prose of Robert Frost, ed.

Substantives pet- rify action and block thought. They must be translated into chains of verbs that can then be used as blueprints for action. The speaker's confident use of nouns and of demonstrative pronouns-"'What town is this?' I asked"-is quickly chal- lenged by the farmer's surprising denial-"'There is no village"'-and then by his amusing demonstration that words like "village" are not inscribed for definiteness, only for rein- scription. "Village" has to be reinscribed to accommodate the novel fact that there are "only scattered farms" in the town of Lunenburg. Even a noun with an apparently stable refer- ent, the noun that gives the poem its title, is a man-made fiction for something too omnipresent, in a sense, to name. The farmer seems to realize that the mountain "Hor" can be made a sign for anything-for the farmer himself, his town, the lure of the limitless but he is reluctant to abet the speaker in his efforts to extract a definite meaning from the mountain. As both Peirce and James insist, a pragmatic definition does not require an actual experiment, merely a consideration of the consequence that would result if a hypothetical exper- iment were to be conducted. It is in the nature of Pisgah visions, for example, to take place on mountain-tops. But the latent dogmatism of the farmer's fiat, "'There ought to be a view . . . / From such a mountain,"' is subtly qualified by the conditional clause that follows. His afterthought, "'if it isn't wooded / Clear to the top,"' gives an important pragmatic turn to his pronouncement. By becoming a chain of causally connected actions, even his hypothesis about the existence of a spring upon the mountain-top allows the farmer to sub- stitute for the essentialist notion that it is the nature of moun- tain peaks to provide Pisgah visions the more pragmatic, because scientifically verifiable, notion that if there is a brook on the mountain, it must have a source. Like any good prag- matist, Frost's farmer establishes the conditions under which the truth or the falsity of his statement could be established. 163</page><page sequence="6">164 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY The spring "'may not be right on the very top,"' he concedes. But "It wouldn't have to be a long way down To have some head of water from above, And a good distance down might not be noticed By anyone who'd come a long way up." The delight the farmer takes in dissolving petrified nouns into chains of verbs abets a pragmatic impulse to graft novel definitions of truth upon a body of existing fact. In answer to the question, "how far is it around the mountain?" for ex- ample, the farmer turns a mere abstract number-five or six miles, say-into an entertaining account of how, if one were resolved to drive round Lunenburg, it would be barely pos- sible to encircle the mountain without crossing the township boundary. Equally playful is his observation that the water in the mountain brook possesses the apparently magical prop- erty of being "'always cold in summer, warm in winter."' This arresting way of phrasing the matter allows the farmer both to grasp the pragmatic truth that propositions are called true or false for reasons of convenience or use and to restate the old axiom that all experience of temperatures is relative. "I don't suppose the water's changed at all. You and I know enough to know it's warm Compared with cold, and cold, compared with warm. But all the fun's in how you say a thing." The immense delight or "fun" of "how you say a thing" is beautifully illustrated by Frost's playful definition of the me- teorite's cosmic origins in "A Star in a Stoneboat." The me- teoric stone used to build the wall is fancifully described as the "star" slipped "from heaven" that "softly" fell. Defining the "flying thing" with the "long Bird of Paradise's tail" in terms of verifiable scientific experiment, Frost invites the laborer to prove the hypothesis of the stone's stellar origins by considering such evidence as the heat of the soil and the stone's magnetic properties. As cosmic matter, the "star" in</page><page sequence="7">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM the "stoneboat" is a microcosm of the earth itself. It makes concrete the mystery of the planet's stellar origins. The fun Frost takes in how he says a thing seems sometimes to be a playful way of hiding James's influence even from himself. In "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," for example, the puzzled horse, thinking it queer that its master should drift into reveries, assumes the role of an inquisitorial William James. Frost would no doubt be surprised by the suggestion that his speaker's momentary surrender to the enchantment of the lovely woods is what James would call a form of"moral holidaying," a mental vagrancy or freedom to dream for which the horse can find no "cash-value" in his practical arithmetic. Equally playful is Frost's poetic parable "How Hard It Is to Keep from Being King When It's in You and in the Situation," a highly idiosyncratic gloss upon James's antideterministic essay, "Great Men and Their En- vironment." Human intelligences of a simple order, like Frost's surrogate king, are slaves of habit and "dry, prosaic, and matter-of-fact," James observes."11 The born king, by con- trast, is capable of unpredictable breaks in logic, of "abrupt cross-cuts and transitions from one idea to another," which his son calls "Freedom to flash off into wild connections." As Frost would say, the free man is not the slave of metonymy. Because he knows that "all the fun's in how you say a thing," he thinks and is educated by metaphor. II. Making Believe: Tough- and Tender-Minded Speakers In trying to secularize the metaphysical idealism of Ro- mantic precursors like Wordsworth and Emerson, Frost shows how every pragmatic critic of traditional philosophy faces a dilemma. If his language is too skeptical and tough, too purged of the idealist quest for essential "truth" or "good," he will not sound sufficiently serious. If his language is too 11 James, "Great Men and Their Environment," in The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy (London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1909), p. 247. 165</page><page sequence="8">166 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY transcendental, on the other hand, Frost will not be able to make antimetaphysical points in nonphilosophical language. James uses the term "tough-minded" to describe the skep- tical, empirical temperament that he favors over the dogmatic temperament of the idealists. "Always monistic" and guided by abstract principles, the Hegelian idealists are critical of the "typical Rocky Mountain toughs in philosophy" for start- ing from parts instead of from the whole.'12 Welcoming open- ness and risk, the tough-minded skeptic takes a different view of Hegel's teaching. In rejecting the Absolute, he seeks to be an active maker rather than a mere passive knower of essence. Tender-minded idealists see tough-minded prag- matists as callous skeptics, but what the fuzzy-minded mon- ists celebrate as spiritual truth, their tough-minded critics reject as mere whim or sentiment, as a "lady-land" of fancy, "As't were the country of the Amazons We men must see you to the confines of And leave you there, ourselves forbid to enter." As the quotation from "West-Running Brook" indicates, Frost usually associates the tender-minded temperament with women, but sometimes the callousness they detect tells us more about the "tender-foot" than about the "Rocky Moun- tain tough" they set out to criticize. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Frost's portrayal of the pain husband and wife inflict upon one another in "Home Burial." Accusing the husband of being insensitive to their son's death, the wife shows what James means when he says that "each type be- lieves the other to be inferior to itself."'3 Were it not that his wife's belief is so harrowing and self-destructive, the tough- minded husband might disdain or even dismiss her irrational conviction that the energy with which he builds the coffin shows contempt for their son. His impatience and exasper- ated sense of irony, attitudes James discerns in the tough- minded temperament, survive even in the midst of his ex- 12 James, "The Present Dilemma in Philosophy," in Pragmatism, p. 12.

And it's come to this, / A man can't speak of his own child that's dead."' We can presume that the wife would like her husband to verbalize his loss, to commemorate it in some less inscrutable way. If so homely an event as the death of a son cannot be domesticated, what is to avert the slide of life itself into some indefinite void? If her husband cannot properly grieve for their son, then not even domesticity seems safe. The assaults of the nameless, the incomprehensible, the indefinite spring from the very defenses of the familiar. And yet Frost seems to me to be gently critical of the inflexible wife. To demand that the father should articulate in words the meaning of his loss-though it is wonderfully intimated by his parenthetical aside, "'A man can't speak of his own child that's dead"'-is to apply a criterion to the testing of grief that is as "crude," in Josiah Royce's phrase, "as if one should argue that a razor is not as good a tool as a hammer, because, forsooth, the test of a tool shall be its weight, or the amount of noise that you can make when you use it."14 As Hopkins recognizes in his little lyric "Spring and Fall: To a Young Child," there is something so terrifying about "the blight man was born for" that there is no way to define or commemorate the blight without making the loss itself seem trivial. A pragmatist be- lieves there is no purely external test by which to assess desolation or loss. The best test may be Rilke's: if we have properly celebrated death, then we have also magnified life. But every action has to be judged by its own specific purpose. Even "ideas are like tools," Royce says. "They are there for an end. "15 "Looking back over her shoulder at some fear," the wife is appalled by an indefinable horror made almost tangible by the omnipresent "it," "that," and "what" ("'What is it- what?"') which migrate as unnameable terrors through this poem. Her use of the amorphous "some," the quality of 14 Josiah Royce, The World and the Individual, 2 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1899), 1:309. 15 Royce, The World and the Individual, 1:308. 167</page><page sequence="10">168 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY dullness in her terror, and especially the predominance of demonstrative pronouns that vaguely gesture clearly drama- tize the truth, more perfectly grasped by her husband than by her, that the meaning of their child's death cannot be stated. It can only be intimated by the all but uncontrolled emotion of the words behind the words. Because for William James, as for George Eliot, even the "quickest witted" of us "walk around well wadded with stu- pidity," the necessary stupidity of even our most intelligent judgments is a matter not for censure but for compassion. In his "Talks to Students," a text Frost taught his Plymouth students, James admonishes "the stupidity and injustice of our opinions, so far as they deal with the significance of alien lives."16 Hence there arises what James would call "the stu- pidity" of the wife's judgment when she presumes to reject and despise her husband's attempts to attenuate the affront of death by distancing and depersonalizing his loss. The dead child's bedroom is mentioned only in a comparison, as a means of indicating the size of the "little graveyard." The stones of slate and marble are alluded to only as a momentary distraction from the one harrowing impression of"the child's mound," which the father barely touches in passing, so pain- ful is the wound. But in trying to exorcise his wife's grief, which is unhealthily repressed in hysterical injunctions not to touch the wound-"'Don't, don't, don't, don't,' she cried"-the husband discovers that her own nightmare is not to be dispelled in the same way as his. Instead of "'making the best of their way back to life"' even as they "'make pretense of following to the grave,"' the wife insists on trans- lating their loss into some appropriately grieving act, some proper ritual celebration. She cannot be reconciled to the tragic insufficiency of all efforts to deal pragmatically with death. Unless death has some consequence for life, the do- mesticity that is shaken by death's inscrutable strangeness 16 James, "On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings," in Talks to Teachers on Psychology: And to Students on Some of Life's Ideals (New York: Henry Holt and Co., 1909), p. 230.</page><page sequence="11">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM seems too frail to survive. Ideally, the inscrutability of death should issue in some reformation of a callous and indifferent world: "'I won't have grief so / If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!'" Precisely in insisting that death must make a dif- ference, that it must be possible to wring some use or con- sequence from it, the tender-minded wife now seems tougher, more rigorously pragmatic, than her husband. Here Frost seems to be testing the pragmatic equation of meaning with use. Certain facts, like death, simply are. They are unaltered by anything we try to do or say about them. Perhaps the only intelligent pragmatism in the face of death is to accept the empty spaces, the frightening void of a soul assaulted and a loved one gone. The father reduces the mo- mentous loss to the manageable proportions of manual tasks like digging a grave and nailing a coffin. Even at the risk of seeming callous, he must seek distractions from his grief in trite reflections about the time it will take for the birch wood to rot. Though the husband wants to fill the silence by com- muning with his wife, he tactfully forswears words that bear directly on their loss. He is pragmatic enough not to be openly pragmatic. Such outward acts as his building a coffin, their attending a funeral, or even the wife's less perfunctory resolve to change the world's way of grieving are all, he knows, of no pragmatic use. Because words leave the heart of meaning untouched, the tough-minded husband knows that words "'are nearly always an offense"' and must come from the other side of silence. The death of their son contin- ues to draw the wife and her husband, even at the heart of their domesticity, into the orbit of the strange. Because there is no pragmatic lexicon in which they can look up the meaning of death, silence seems more natural than speech. A loss so intrinsic does not translate. "Death is a leveler," as Northrop Frye has said, "not because everybody dies, but because nobody understands what death means."'7 Frost's tough-minded speakers assert the claims of natural fact. They belong typically to James's first department of the 17 Northrop Frye, The Great Code: The Bible and Literature (Toronto: Academic Press Canada, 1982), p. 230. 169</page><page sequence="12">170 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY mind, which collects sense impressions for the second or reflective department to elaborate into formulas and laws. In a poem of debate like "The Generations of Men," Frost shows how, in confronting a mere gaping hole in the earth, a skep- tical young man of the Sark clan and his impressionable female relative start with the facts of sense in their most unpromising outward form. They then use the middle ground of reflection to urge these facts toward some practical conclu- sion. The hole's consequence for action is the young man's determination to bring about his marriage to the girl, to believe it into being. Inspired by such precursive faith, the girl insists that she sees visions and hears voices, which are projected like a "picture on a screen." "The desire for a certain kind of truth," James says, "brings about that special truth's existence.'"18 The lad, by contrast, even in surrendering to the claims of James's third department of the mind, which is defined as the claims of our volitional nature, insists that he is still a realist (if not in the strictly empirical sense, then at least in the visionary sense that his voices and visions are independent of the knower). The girl's "make-believe" tempts the skeptic's will and can literally make belief. Launched upon an experiment to transform faith in fact into the creation of fact, the young man is determined to "tell" his friend "'what the voices really say."' Behind the epistemological paradoxes the reader can also discern the first tactical maneuvers in a game of courtship. The voices, he predicts, will be about themselves, because his voices exist, in true pragmatic fashion, as a pure consequence of his faith in their future friendship and as a pure consequence, he implies, "'of our having been together."' The poem recalls the passage in The Will to Believe where James insists that there are "cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming." He is resolved to show, like Frost's speaker, that "faith in a fact can help create the fact."19 18 James, "The Will to Believe," in The Will to Believe and Other Essays, p. 24. 19 James, "The Will to Believe," p. 25.</page><page sequence="13">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM One of the purest forms of "making belief" is the language of baptism, which makes or calls into being what descriptive discourse merely purports to transcribe as an antecedent fact. Thus the young man's "'voices seem to say: / Call her Naus- icaa, the unafraid . . . / Call her Nausicaa."' This ritual naming initiates a whole series of performative acts in the poem, as Frost's speaker combines the petitions of courtship with the injunctions of a reinvented pastoral or myth: "'And come and make your summer dwelling here, / And perhaps she will come." Capable of creating its own verification, such faith in a future of shared summers in "a new cottage on the ancient spot" represents the kind of"will to believe" that even tough- minded skeptics must be capable of if they are to be genuinely open to human encounter, "'unafraid,"' as Frost's speaker says, "'Of an acquaintance made adventurously."' To remain in character, however, the skeptic must not become too lyrical. After surrendering to the spell of a soft pastoral voice, he subsides into the harsher personal tone of old Granny Stark, whose querulous rural idiom is hardly the kind of voice to create and sustain faith in idyllic visions. According to James in his textbook on psychology, the ability of mediums to shift voices abruptly is true only of the higher phases of trance. In the girl's lower phases of possession, "the normal self is not excluded from conscious participation in the performance."20 But if Frost's male speaker is a more accomplished medium than his female friend, he is still un- consciously the coauthor of his voices. As James observes in a passage from The Will to Believe which may well have suggested to Frost the title of his poem, "From generation to generation thus it goes, -now a movement of reception from without" as a tough-minded skeptic subverts a dogmatic precept by appealing to the facts, "now a movement of ex- pansion from within" as a tender-minded visionary opposes the skeptic's lazy subsiding into these same facts of sense.

In this poem a wife and husband's removal to a remote country house after years of urban living requires some emotional as well as practical adjustment. In order to fix visually the altered cir- cumstances of their lives, the wife begins to gaze obsessively from the window of her kitchen. Since the actual view from the window is as insignificant per se as the gaze down the cellar hole in "The Generations of Men," the husband senses that his wife sees "'More than you like to own to out that window."' When she proceeds to extol the virtues of dark- ness, the mercy of some middle ground that hides from men the knowledge of their ends and their beginnings, he wisely invites her to renounce visionary vagrancy for more pressing practical concerns. "'Come from that window where you see too much,"' he gently chides her, reversing Arnold's injunc- tion to his bride in "Dover Beach," "And take a livelier view of things from here." Though kind and solicitous, the man's tough-mindedness can be felt in his refusal to shrink from painful truths. How 21 James, "Reflex Action and Theism," in The Will to Believe, p. 128. James's theory of three departments of the mind-sensory, volitional, and theoretical, in that order-is recalled by the U-shaped structure of many of Frost's poems, which begin with the facts of sense, move into theoretical reflection, then end with some act of volition that alters the facts with which the poem began. The main difference between Frost and James is that Frost reverses the order of volition and theory, reserving James's pivotally placed volitional faculties for climactic treatment at the end of the poems. James's theory of three departments seems to be influenced by Peirce's doctrine of three sets of triadic relations. Triadic relations of comparison are based on the sign in isolation, like the facts of sense that are treated by James's first department of the mind. Triadic relations of performance, involving actual entities in the real world, constitute Peirce's second set. This set, which deals with two entities-the sign and its ground-corresponds with Frost's attempt to adjust the claims of theory and practice and with the efforts of James's second department of the mind to mediate between perception and theoretical reflection. Peirce's third set of relations deals with the triadic relations of thought and is less relevant to Frost's pragmatism because it is more concerned with abstract ideas than with entities in the real world.</page><page sequence="15">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM long is "the home stretch?" he wants to know. How many years does she see ahead of them? Reluctant to give an answer, the wife tutors her husband on the limits of knowl- edge, prompting him to formulate for himself the epistemo- logical paradox: "'I don't want to find out what can't be known."' The husband is either nervous about facing the limits of understanding or else he has no desire to be involved in the logical contradiction of trying to know the unknowable. But if origins, like ends, are unknowable, how can he ever know they are unknowable? His very affirmation denies the truth of what he tries to affirm. Though nostalgia for begin- nings and anxieties about ends may be "inseparable," as Dr. Johnson says, "from a thinking being whose life is limited and for whom death is dreadful," the wife realizes that both preoc- cupations may unfit her for love and use in life's middle years. In renouncing all fear of the "horror of concluding," she makes her faith about the future serve volitional needs. She wants her tough-minded husband to see that, since her tender- minded shrinking from the facts is simply a more consistent application of his own pragmatism, it is logically inconsistent for him to blame her. To justify her claim that "'Ends and beginnings-there are no such things. / There are only mid- dles,"' she affirms that the true break with the past occurred at a moment neither of them can now remember: "My dear, It's who first thought the thought. You're searching, Joe, For things that don't exist; I mean beginnings." Origins are places of fracture and collision. When novelties cannot be assimilated, life breaks apart. The strange can no longer be converted into the familiar, and even the things we know best become alien and unnerving. The truth about the wife's apparent break with her past is what she and her husband agree to say about it. Insisting that this break "'is no beginning,"' the wife is determined both to "'lean on old truth and grasp new fact."' There are "only middles" between absolute novelty and complete familiarity. An idea is truest, 173</page><page sequence="16">174 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY as James says, when it "performs most felicitously its function of satisfying our double urgency" to marry "old opinion to new fact," and in such a way "as to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of continuity. "22 If there are no absolute breaks in the woman's life, then there are no necessary endings either. "'End is a gloomy word,"' she insists, because when the end is seen ahead as an inescapable fact it can no longer have the appeal of a desired destination. Her future will make itself true, have itself classed as true, by the way her anticipations of it work. The wife's foreknowledge of the end is like her faith in her husband. Because it would take her "'forever to recite / All that's not new'&gt; in their love for each other, she is reluctant to say exactly what the future holds. People who love each other are shy of predicting, because their belief in each other "knows it cannot tell; only the outcome can tell."23 The wife's anticipation of the end is not the kind of communicable knowledge she can share with someone else, even with her husband, but the kind of personal foreknowledge that the pragmatist is able to believe into being and that begins, like all good poetry, "in something more felt than known."24 Perhaps the most affecting clash of tough- and tender- minded temperaments in Frost's poetry takes place in the exchange between the gently skeptical husband and the re- ligiously inclined wife of "West-Running Brook." Fred sadly acknowledges that the only reality he knows is the flux of his sensations as they slip away and seem to spend "to nothing- ness." "That is the sting of it," James laments, "that in the vast driftings of the cosmic weather," as in Fred's "'universal cataract of death,"' all life "'seriously, sadly, runs away / To fill the abyss's void with emptiness."' Although many a jut of shore and many a buoyant wave appear "long lingering" be- fore they "be dissolved-even as our world now lingers, for our joy-yet when these transient products are gone, noth- ?2 James, "What Pragmatism Means," in Pragmatism, pp. 63, 61. 23 Frost, "Education by Poetry," in Selected Prose, p. 46. 24 Frost, "Education by Poetry," p. 45.</page><page sequence="17">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM ing, absolutely nothing, remains," James bleakly says, "to represent those particular qualities, those elements of pre- ciousness which they may have enshrined."25 To avoid shipwreck and dissolution, while still refusing to take refuge in his wife's annunciations, Fred learns to cele- brate in "'some power of strange resistance"' to the cataract of death a principle of novelty and freedom. In such "'tribute of the current to the source,"' the skeptic finds a figure for his own pragmatic efforts to make something true, to find emotional and practical satisfaction in what he says and does. The common sense that resists the confidence of the mysti- cally vagrant wife helps Fred escape bewitchment. But his own appalling vision of a world on the edge, teetering on the brink of fragmentation and collapse, teases Fred out of his skeptical complacencies. Like James's pragmatic theism, that vision helps Fred discover and proclaim, in a principle of flux and freedom that "is most us," a cosmological theory of human promise and hope. III. Frost's Pragmatic Theism: Open, Plural, and Intelligible Frost believes, like James, that all attempts to ground practice in traditional theology or metaphysics are attempts to make a god-term of some useless wheel that plays no actual part in the cosmic mechanism. Instead, Frost chooses to argue that any workable theism or metaphysics must possess three qualities: it must be open and free rather than closed and determined; it must be plural rather than monistic; and it must be purposive and at least partly intelligible. Any study of Frost's revolt against earlier idealists must consider how far these three attributes of pragmatic theism permeate his poetic practice and thought. If traditional philosophy were ever to succeed in reducing rationality to a formula, then freedom would disappear. One could arrive at moral and scientific truth blindly merely by 25 James, "Some Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically Considered," in Pragma- tism, p. 105. 175</page><page sequence="18">176 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY obeying mechanical rules. But since poetry, like love, "begins in delight," and "runs a course of lucky events,"26 Frost be- lieves the poet must face new options at every turn. Only if choices are available can he know "the freedom" of his "ma- terial" and accept the discipline imposed by each new direc- tion he has chosen and by each "road not taken." Nowhere is the challenge of choice in an open universe more marked than in Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken." The claim that "ages and ages hence" the poet will be "telling . . . with a sigh" that the choice of the more solitary road "has made all the difference" may seem at first to exceed the facts. After all, "the road not taken" was almost as unexplored as the other road; "the passing there / Had worn them really about the same." If trivial choices are as arbitrary as Frost's choice of the less traveled road and if they nevertheless entail unforeseen consequences that reach down the ages, then, as James would say, do we not in fact inhabit "a sort of insane sand-heap or nulliverse, no universe at all"? To answer this question James tells a story remarkably similar to Frost's. He invites his audience to consider to what degree his route home after his lecture is a matter of choice. Imagine that he first walks through Divinity Avenue and that the universe is annihilated ten minutes later, setting him "back at the door of this hall just as I was before the choice was made. Imagine then that, everything else being the same, I now make a different choice and traverse Oxford Street." The strict determinist is forced to believe that one of these two universes-the one with James walking through Divinity Avenue or the other with James choosing Oxford Street-must "have been . . . impossible" from eternity. But James replies that there is "absolutely no criterion" by which we might judge the choice of one street "necessary" and "the other a matter of choice."27 By giving a pragmatic meaning to his own choice of roads that is based, consciously or unconsciously, on James's an- 26 Frost, "The Figure a Poem Makes," in Selected Prose, p. 18. 27 James, "The Dilemma of Determinism," in The Will to Believe, p. 155.</page><page sequence="19">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM ecdote of choosing Divinity Avenue or Oxford Street, Frost vastly magnifies the consequences of his choice. If the two roads are not identical in every respect, then the meaning of taking one road rather than the other can be discovered only by experiencing all the differences that result. To be sure, to have such an experience it is necessary to perform an exper- iment that, because we have neither world enough nor time to attempt a complete induction, must remain always hypo- thetical. But as Peirce had argued, the hypothetical nature of the induction in no way invalidates the pragmatic method it uses. It is sufficient to conceive of the experiment. There is no need actually to perform it. Like James, Frost believes that freedom exists only within the necessity of having to make choices that produce mutually exclusive results. But the choice of the less traveled road is no more a necessity ordained from eternity than is James's choice of Divinity Avenue rather than Oxford Street. Indeed, before his choice was made, each road seemed as natural for Frost to take as both streets seemed to James. In a strictly deterministic world, Frost would not be "sorry" that his choice of the more solitary road precludes his choice of the other road, which recedes enticingly from view. Though the panic of the closing door afflicts many people with the ad- vance of age, we would not experience that anxiety unless we had freedom of choice, since without such freedom there would be only one road each traveler could take and only one door each of us could open. An open universe, however, also exacts a price, for some forms of freedom risk suicide or death. In his essay "On Emerson," Frost is relieved to report that the story he tells of the disenchanted philosophy student, whom he advises to quit university, "has a happy ending. His departure was not suicidal."28 But the outcome of many of Frost's poems of departure, poems like "Bond and Free," "The Sound of Trees," or "The Impulse," is neither so happy nor decisive. 28 Frost, "On Emerson," in Selected Prose, p. 117. 177</page><page sequence="20">178 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY In "The Impulse," from "The Hill Wife," for example, the woman's wildness enacts the wrong kind of freedom. It was too lonely for her there, And too wild, And since there were but two of them, And no child, And work was little in the house, She was free, And followed where he furrowed field, Or felled tree. The shocking absence of constraints in this lyric-no ties, no labor, no child-generates the kind of terror that Frost can tame only with the help of a simple paratactic syntax and a stark meter. She strayed so far she scarcely heard When he called her- And didn't answer-didn't speak- Or return. She stood, and then she ran and hid In the fern. He never found her . . . As grammatical connectives fall away and the narrative con- tracts to a shrunken inventory of negative verbs, broken only by dashes, we realize that a poem that seemed to originate as a mere game of hide-and-seek between husband and wife is no playful exercise. When we are told that the husband, having forever lost his wife, thus learned "of finalities / Be- sides the grave," our expectations are fulfilled in a way that is as surprising as it is unforeseen, for we cannot avoid the temptation to read "Beside the grave" for "Besides the grave" and therefore to register both meanings-the finality of death and the finality of partings other than death-together. Freedom may best be pictured as the unconstraining taut- ness of the relenting ropes that Frost uses to describe the</page><page sequence="21">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM countless ties of love and thought in "The Silken Tent." Even this metaphor echoes James's well-known description of"aes- thetic union" in his essay "The One and the Many" in Prag- matism. "It is easy to see the world's history pluralistically," James says, "as a rope of which each fibre tells a separate tale; but to conceive of each cross-section of the rope as an absolutely single fact, and to sum the whole longitudinal series into one being living an undivided life, is harder."29 Like James's rope, whose fibers cohere only in the longitu- dinal direction, Frost's sonnet rides freely across quatrains, going slightly taut only at the nodal points of its gracefully subordinated single sentence. A second target of Frost's theological poetry is religious monism, which leaves insufficient room for a pragmatic faith that can literally "make" belief. Few of Frost's metaphysical lyrics are more openly critical of a despotic and predestinating monism than "The Lockless Door." The key to this poem is an obscure passage in James's essay "The Sentiment of Ra- tionality," which insists that every interpreter must bring to the lock his own key. "Nature," says James, "has put into our hands two keys, by which we may test the lock. If we try the moral key and it fits, it is a moral lock. If we try the unmoral key and it fits, it is an unmoral lock."30 In Frost's poem the "I" is the God of religious monism, whose universe "went many years" before its boldest resident, man, gathered enough courage to knock at the door, asking God for an interview. Afraid of being unmasked in the nakedness of his undeveloped "Alpha state," God blows "out the light" and prays to the lockless door in a gesture of abasement before escaping through a window. In leaving his mansion for the world of "dying generations," Frost's God gives up his iden- tity as a First Cause or Absolute. He becomes instead a destiny that has not yet arrived at its ultimate destination. He is what James would call a "still unfinished x,"31 the 29 James, "The One and the Many," in Pragmatism, p. 144. 30 James, "The Sentiment of Rationality," in The Will to Believe, p. 108. 31 James, "The Sentiment of Rationality," in The Will to Believe, p. 107. 179</page><page sequence="22">180 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY meaning of which God and man must grope toward together. This is the view of deity Frost sets forth in A Masque of Reason. In many poems by Frost one can see a wide and rough but genuine consistency of outlook between Frost and James. Some readers might ascribe these similarities merely to a shared penchant for certain American postures. In A Masque of Reason and A Masque of Mercy, however, Frost's two most sustained examinations of pragmatic theism, traces of a much more dynamic relation between Frost and James are difficult to ignore. In A Masque of Reason, his playfully subversive invention of a forty-third chapter for the Book of Job, Frost turns God into an apologist for the kind of monism that takes flight from the world. But curious features of Frost's God set Him unmistakably apart from the God of the Old Testament monists as well as from the amoral Absolute of a monist like F. H. Bradley. Whereas the God of the biblical Job is an omniscient despot who knows in advance how Job will be- have, Frost's God has to be tutored by his servant. Like the God of the pragmatists, He has "to wait for words like any- one." Though Job is God's teacher, from Frost's own point of view Job himself greatly overestimates the value of abstract thinking-even though he shows little talent for it. And he greatly underestimates the value of volition. "Data," as James says, are "gifts." To know data at all is to receive a gift we should be grateful for. But we should not expect these objects of our sense experience nor the mental operations which attend them in James's first department of the mind to disclose the secret of the universe. Too inclined to "dance in a ring and suppose," we need to be reminded, Frost says in "The Secret Sits," that the sphinx-like "Secret," like the "great Boyg" in Peer Gynt or the so-called Secret of Hegel, "sits" inscrutably "in the middle" frustrating all our efforts to walk around it and "know." In developing his own metaphor of the faculties, in which the will functions both as the motor and the brakes and the reason as "the steering gear," Job in A Masque of Reason forgets that reason itself</page><page sequence="23">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM must be guided by volition if James's third theoretical stage is to be held in check by the proper balance of reaction and response at the second stage of volition and "making belief." Until man has added his own volitional fiat to God's creative will, the universe is not fully intelligible. Its rationality and salvation depend in part on man's volitional powers. Impatient of being schooled by either God or her husband, who patronizes her as an intellectual lightweight, Job's wife has the important function of opposing to religious monism, which she takes to be a peculiarly male fallacy-"'You don't catch women trying to be Plato"'-the counter-truths of plu- ralism. In making an idol of the Absolute or the One, He- gelians and Platonists venerate an abstraction so remote from the facts of sense and the powers of volition that the conse- quences of the One's existing become hard to distinguish from those of its not existing at all. In a pragmatic universe, it becomes impossible to attach any truth or meaning to such a concept. It is a mere idol of theoretical speculation and demonstrates the danger of allowing James's third depart- ment of the mind to exercise a despotic control over the first two departments. Though Job's wife weakens her defense of Frost's own pragmatic theism by reverting to partisan issues like women's rights-it is still "'mostly women'" who "'Get burned for prophecy,"' she complains-she argues persua- sively that theology, properly conceived, consists of many truths rather than a single Truth. Religion should postulate a universe that is open, plural, and at least partly intelligible to men and women with the "will to believe." The clash of theological opinion is sharpest in the Shavian mix of banter and inner seriousness that enlivens Frost's companion poem, A Masque of Mercy. In this second masque the role of Job's deity is assumed by Jonas Dove's Old Tes- tament God, and the mediating role of Job and his wife, as they try to adjudicate among the different powers of the mind, falls upon the worldly but pragmatic Jesse Bel (Jezebel) and her husband, the Keeper. In his essay on "Reflex Action and Theism" James insists that all three departments of the 181</page><page sequence="24">182 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY mind must be satisfied. The perceiving faculties must defend the claims of sensory facts; the theoretic faculties must free the mind of inconsistencies; and the active volitional powers must retain an object to react upon and live for. In Frost's masque Paul's God threatens to betray the facts of nature, and Jonas's God gives too little scope either to man's volition or to love. Only the irrepressible Jesse Bel and the Keeper are able to judge and keep in balance the claims of the other two departments. They are the custodians or keepers of James's "department Number two," the pragmatic practition- ers of speculative thought, "always worked to death," in James's view, "yet never excused from taking the most re- sponsible part in the arrangements."32 Justice, for Frost, is law, decorum, convention (whether in theology, poetry, or ethics), while mercy is wildness, vio- lence, revelation. "The only thing that really counts," Frost's Paul says, "is the form / Of outrage-violence." By contrast, Jonas Dove's God is a deity of absolute morality who legislates the laws of a fixed and closed world. Law or convention for its own sake is an "irrational conception," according to James, because it says "to our most cherished powers, There is no object for you." This is why it is as important to a pragmatist like James, as it is to Job's God in the earlier masque, "'To stultify the Deutermonist / And change the tenor of religious thought."' Understandably, as the prophet of a predestinating God, Jonas Dove is a prophet without the will to believe. Opposed by a God who blocks his freedom, he finds that not only the literal door of his bookshop but also the "great door" of the kingdom, "'Beyond the storm, beyond the universe,"' has been "'locked against"' him. To purify the diseased imagination of a Jesse Bel or of a prophet like Jonas, Jesse Bel's resident bookshop annalist, Paul, must indoctrinate both of them in the paradoxes of the Gospels. As the Bible moves from law to liberty, Paul wants to show Jonas how relatively little justice matters. But prag- matists like Frost and the Keeper are also clearly critical of 32 James, "Reflex Action and Theism," p. 128.</page><page sequence="25">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM Paul. His riddling paradox that "'Failure is failure, but success is failure. / There is no better way of having it"' violates the law of contradiction. Since success and failure lead to different consequences, their meanings must differ. To blur that dif- ference is to dispense with the pragmatic criterion of truth and to indulge in a playfully perverse logomachy. The burden of correction devolves upon the Keeper, who must challenge the dogmatism of Jonas's God of law and justice without lapsing into the logical confusions of a God of mercy. If the world of the Old Testament God is totally closed and predetermined, the world of Paul's New Testament God seems totally anarchic. Jonas's God affirms that the justice of a carefully legislated and ordered world is securely founded on the causal relation between two events. But Paul pro- pounds the pragmatically preposterous doctrine that X is non- X and non-X is X. He imagines a universe so open that action, devoid of consequence, can produce no discernible difference or result. The strength of Christian theism is its genius for raising profound questions, but no straightforward and satisfjying an- swers are forthcoming. Resolved to preserve some proper object of belief on which he can continue to exercise his will, the Keeper is quick to reject Paul's subversive paradoxes. "'I won't deceive myself about success,"' he tells Paul, "'By making failure out of equal value."' In denouncing the liberal theologian, who, having got "'From many gods to Three, and Three to One, / Thinks why not taper off to none at all,"' Paul is deriding the Unitarians, the very sect to whom James delivered his original lecture on "Reflex Action and Theism," later incorporated into The Will to Believe. In his lecture James praised the Unitarians for restoring a concept of God that men could "react-on" and "live for."33 Indeed inspiring action is precisely the function of Frost's Unitarian Keeper, the champion of James's second or volitional department of 33 James, "Reflex Action and Theism," p. 125. This essay was originally delivered as a lecture to the Unitarian Ministers' Institute at Princeton, Mass., 1881, and was printed in the Unitarian Review for October of that year. 183</page><page sequence="26">184 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY the mind. As in Frost's poem "The Lockless Door," the Keeper realizes that Jonas must "Unlock the door" for him- self. If, as James argues, "the world may ... be likened unto a lock, whose inward nature . . . will never reveal itself to our simply expectant gaze,"34 then no door will open to us unless we can transform the quality of our thinking and feel- ing. The best theology, in Frost's view, is a pragmatic theism which by its well-placed vagueness and artful evasions allows the believer to fit the universe to human keys. God's truths can be experienced only as a series of promises, as offers of potential salvation, which men with the will to believe must then make actual. Because truth is what proves itself, not once and for all but continually, Frost hopes to affirm that a God whose world is at least partly intelligible, genuinely open and plural, will contrive to make His "injustice just" through "mercy." If the apparent injustices and forms of outrage are "the most sacred things of all," it is because God has ordained and sanctioned them to the end that the law of judgment should be mercy and the law of life an unceasing effort to will into being that salvation that, in James's words, is "neither necessary nor impossible." I have argued that Frost's pragmatic theism opts for a universe that has three qualities. It must be open and free, plural, and intelligible and purposive-a source of ultimate hope rather than despair. Without the freedom to choose, there would be no mystery and novelty and no feeling of regret for each "road not taken." A closed universe would be an inhuman universe, in which man would be a mere object, a spectator. For this reason Frost prefers a theism that in Peirce's words is "anthropomorphic" but "vague." If a theism is inhuman, it will be purged of that poetic instinct that, "purified by meditation, is the most precious contribution," Peirce concedes, "that has been made to philosophy for ages."35 But if our predications are not also vague, they will 34 James, '"The Sentiment of Rationality," p. 108. 35 C. S. Peirce, Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, ed. Charles Hart-</page><page sequence="27">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM not allow our statements to be statements about God. Vague- ness, as both Frost and Peirce conceive it, is a form of in- determinacy. The mysteries of indefinition are one means of keeping the universe open and limitless. Peirce tries to state this truth with more logical precision by saying that a sign is objectively "vague" if it reserves for some other possible sign the task of completing it. The vague "something" that sends up the sun in Frost's "West-Running Brook," for example, is in Peirce's sense religious, partly because it is indefinite and requires the idea of a first cause or source to complete it. As a "backward motion towards" a first cause and as "The tribute of the current to the source," Frost's "something" not only requires completion but also functions anthropomorphically. Precisely because it is a mir- ror in which "we see ourselves" most clearly, it is also a believable notion. "'It is most us,"' as Fred says. Less concerned with producing true propositions than with finding new vocabularies and metaphors to keep inquiry going, Frost resists any flight from the world that would bring inquiry to a premature end. What has been concluded, Frost would say, that there is anything to conclude? Even when the desire to end is strongest, when the pull into wintry oblivion in "After Apple Picking" or in "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" is hardest to resist, Frost continually fights against boundaries and limits. "Mending Wall" is a boundary or definition poem that minimizes neither the ad- vantages nor the dangers of setting limits. To set a limit may provide a stay against confusion, but a definition or a bound- ary may also seal off truth. And, as Frost's speaker says, "'Before I built a wall I'd ask to know / What I was walling in or walling out."' To "wall in" is to end the search for other signs that might complete the meaning. shorne and Paul Weiss, 8 vols. (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1931- 33), 5:496.

Monism fosters the dangerous delusion that a determining God or Absolute has grounded our present vocabulary and world view and de- signed man like a computer capable of writing and reading only one program. No poet better illustrates than Frost a dictum of Richard Rorty's. "In the end," Rorty says, "prag- matists tell us ... what matters is our loyalty to other human beings clinging together against the dark, not our hope of getting things right. James, in arguing . . . that 'the trail of the human serpent is over all,' was reminding us that our glory is in our participating in fallible and transitory human projects, not in our obedience"36 to the constraints and laws of a preordained world, a world intelligible at the inadmis- sible cost of being inhuman. Frost, like James, seeks a fully human world whose intelligibility cannot be worried into being but must unfold by surprise, like the risky and imper- fect art of writing poetry or making love. Frost's faith in the art belief, in the love belief, and in the God belief is not an exaggerated or immodest faith. The source of his qualified hope is his sense that, for better rather than for worse, Nature is really a human project, a product of theories man has shaped and of beliefs he has made malle- able. In traditional philosophies of religion, the statement "God exists" has the same philosophical grammar as the prop- osition 2+2=4, the truth or falsity of which is unaffected by anyone's believing or disbelieving it, but for Frost and James the truth depends on what their belief in the statement allows them to do with it. "God exists" has the same philosophical grammar as the statement "my poem has a design" or as the proposition "you like me," where belief in the design or in 36 Richard Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism: Essays, 1972-1980 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982), p. 166. Rorty's unidentified quotation is from James's Pragmatism, p. 64.</page><page sequence="29">POETICS OF PRAGMATISM the liking may make the statements true. Like love-making or the statement "God exists," poetic language does things with words. Instead of describing a prior state of affairs, poetry allows Frost to create rather than discover. It makes something happen. A world that is responsive to human performance, to ac- tions or gestures that are thrown out in advance of any knowl- edge, may itself be a fiction. Perhaps the meaningfulness of the world is the supreme fiction, but the alternative is a venture into darkness, which Frost rejects because of its undesirable consequences. If the world is meaningless, then each skid down the slope becomes a slide into the void predicted by the Second Law of Thermodynamics and into the burned-out world much nearer home that Frost's darkest poems explore. But even his bleakest "desert places" deny the essence of what they describe. They subdue the terror of the nameless, the boundless, the indefinite by supplying the refuge of a local geography, the refuge of a habitation and a name. If Frost's darkness and despair are the necessary corollaries of his optimism, it is because he understands better than most pragmatists the contradiction inherent in pragmatism. The pragmatist cheerfully argues that truth is what works. But this contradicts the pragmatist's depressing axiom that truth is unattainable because we can never get outside our beliefs to criticize them. And even if we could, we would soon discover that the contexts of interpretation are bound- less. Frost uses tender-minded critics of his tough-minded pragmatists to show why reflection upon the pragmatist's procedures is a necessary task. The wife's speculations in "Home Burial" may not lead to changes in assumptions and practices, but her demand that death should mean some- thing, that it should be of some use, is ironically a more consistently pragmatic attitude than that of her tough-minded husband. The wife's despairing conclusion that her husband can never stand outside of his axioms to evaluate them is like the relativist's conclusion that every truth is so true that any 187</page><page sequence="30">188 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY truth must be false. Such a conclusion is one result of the pragmatist's optimistic axiom that truth is what can be dem- onstrated within a defined framework. Frost believes it is the function of poets and eccentrics, of prophets and madmen, to keep open the possibility of other frameworks. We are educated by metonymy, because mean- ing is bound to a given context, but we are also educated by metaphor and by metalepsis, the rhetorical trope that attrib- utes a present effect to a remote cause or vice versa. As we are reminded by the distant stellar origins of the meteorite in "A Star in a Stoneboat," or by the prospect of telling "ages and ages hence" about two roads that diverged in a wood, the horizons of remote origins and distant consequences keep expanding indefinitely. What is given and made-what sim- ply is the case, whether anyone could understand and use it-is a necessary evil. Like death and grief, such a given is flat and final, unmedicable, incapable of being modified by anything we can do or say about it. True knowledge, for Frost and the pragmatists, is something we "make up" about the facts. It yields the kind of a priori truth that the mind pos- sesses only of its own artifacts and fictions. As one such fiction, a poem is a stay against confusion, because it opti- mistically grounds the truth in a knowable dramatic situation. But like the consequence of choosing the road less traveled by, the real context of meaning is boundless. As Peirce would say, it is reserved for some other possible sign in some other hypothetical poem to complete any given poem's meaning. We live in the best of all possible worlds, and everything that exists-everything that is given and grounded, that simply is the case, like death-is a necessary evil that makes despair as inevitable as the optimism that generates it.
