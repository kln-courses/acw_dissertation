<plain_text><page sequence="1">A FORMATIVE-PERIOD PAINTED POTTERY COMPLEX AT ANCON, PERU RAMIRO MATOS MENDIETA ABSTRACT The well-known archaeological site at Anc6n, Peru, represents the timespan from preceramic through the end of the Formative period. Recent investigations have per- mitted definition of five ceramic phases, of which Anc6n C is of particular interest here because it marks the appearance of zoned and unzoned painted decoration. These techniques were added to the preexisting ceramic complex, characterized by limited frequency of decora- tion by incision. A burial equating with Anc6n C con- tained a variety of grave goods, including a complete olla with zoned red decoration, covered with a basket and containing among other objects a wooden figurine with articulated arms. The estimated date is around 1200 B.C. These associations expand the definition of the cultural complex on the central Peruvian coast in the pre-Chavin period and raise questions about the origin and diffusion of the traits, which have also been reported from Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, and Mesoamerica. A NCON IS the name of a beach resort lo- cated on a bay 35 km. north of Lima, at 11?55' south latitude and 77 10' west longitude. The location is well known in Andean archae- ology as a result of the work of Reiss and Stubel (1880), Uhle (1912), Strong (1925), Willey and Corbett (1954), Tello (1960), Carrion Cachot (1948), Tabio (1965), Lanning (1960), Patterson (1966), and others. On the basis of existing information, it is possible to reconstruct the culture history of Ancon over the past 10,000 years and to demonstrate that this has been a strategic zone, a center of convergence and dif- fusion of cultural elements. In different periods, traits have been introduced from the highlands, the forests, and the northern and southern coasts (Matos 1962). The discovery of a ceramic phase with pre- dominantly painted decoration among the early pottery types and styles is of considerable impor- tance both in view of the cultural context and of its antiquity. Although the early pottery of the Central Andes is generally characterized by its monochrome color and plastic decoration, some sites have produced painted vessels in stratigraphic and typological contexts that place them much earlier than the diffusion of Chavin. From where did they come, and how were they diffused? We are not yet in a position to provide specific answers. Present distributional evidence shows early painted pottery to be absent on the north coast, sporadic on the central coast, and to attain its highest development on the south coast during the Middle and Late periods. The purpose of the present contribution is to describe a painted-pottery complex at Ancon, which stratigraphically precedes the spread of classic Chavin art on the central coast. Its antiquity can be documented by a brief discus- sion of the excavations, ceramic sequence, and a burial representing the painted-pottery phase. EXCAVATIONS A program of salvage archaeology was con- ducted by the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, under the direction of Jorge C. Muelle at Las Colinas de Ancon, to obtain infor- mation in danger of loss because of improve- ments in the highway, construction of parking lots, and reforestation. Several advanced stu- dents of the Department of Anthropology as- sisted with the work. Fourteen pits were exca- vated, the results of which can be summarized briefly. Trench 1, adjacent to a bulldozer-cut on the upper part of the site (Fig. 1), measured 6 m. long, 3 m. wide, and 8.5 m. deep. The strati- graphy, clearly defined by regular horizontal lenses of calcium formed by seasonal rains (Fig. 2), embraces the whole Formative period, from the end of the preceramic to the appearance of regional cultures. The trench was later extended (T-1A) over the area scraped by the machinery, in a 2 by 2-m. square, 1.5 m. deep. This zone revealed two clearly differentiated strata: (1) later preceramic, with twined and looped tex- tiles and evidence of incipient agriculture in the form of gourds, beans, achira, etc., and (2) ini- tial ceramic (Ancon A and B). Three additional pits adjacent to Pit VI of Willey and Corbett (1954) produced almost identical results. Work then moved to the area of the water tank, on the upper part of Las Colinas, where the surface has been scraped three different times. The first was in 1935 when the tank was constructed, the second in 1948 when the high- way was built, and the third in 1959 when the highway was widened and asphalted. During the latter disturbance, complete vessels and sherds with incised and painted decoration were revealed. Our investigation began with excava- tion of 8 pits, each 3 by 3 m. and separated by 226</page><page sequence="2">ANCON POTTERY FIG. 1. The site of Ancon, showing bulldozer cuts and recent excavations in relation to the earlier ones by Willey and Corbett (after Willey and Corbett 1954, Map 2). an unexcavated zone to improve control and permit examination of the stratigraphic profile. A complicated architectural situation was en- countered in the refuse accumulation, and exca- vation was terminated when the house floors were reached. The pottery here was character- ized by bichrome decoration and Chavin influence. Finally, two trenches (T-3 and T-4) were excavated near the tank. In T-3, architectural features were cleared only to the level of the floor. T-4, however, was excavated by natural strata down to sterile soil. A dwelling associated with bichrome pottery was cleared in T-3. It had a quadrangular plan, 2.5 m. on a side. The wall, which was 50 cm. high, was built of small stones set in seaweed and swamp grass, resembling Paracas construc- tions at Ocucaje. On the floor inside the house were 5 utilitarian jars. Adjacent to the north wall, in T-4, a simple burial was discovered with grave goods, the whole hardened by the action of salitre. Part of this offering consisted of a bichrome jar covered with a basket, which will be described farther on. The excavations in the tank area verified the existence of a clearly differentiable cultural stratum characterized by square buildings and bichrome pottery. A thick deposit above this stratum contains Chavin or Chavin-influenced pottery and typically circular buildings. BURIAL 1 In Trench 4 a simple grave was found, exca- vated in the earth behind a house. The body of an adult woman was wrapped in three cotton mantles; the outer two retained traces of several colors, including red, yellow, and white. The cotton is S-spun and the weave warp float, with two active and one passive element. The head was covered with cotton bolls containing seeds. The whole wrapping was badly deteriorated, adhering to the body and hardened by salitre penetration. Associated was a bichrome jar with zoned red painting (Fig. 3). It had a depressed globular form, 33 cm. in body diameter and 22 cm. high, with a constricted mouth 11.2 cm. in diameter. The decoration, typical of Ancon C, consists of broad incised lines defining a band around the mouth, and a row of concentric diamonds on the upper exterior. Inside the jar were frag- ments of cotton fabric to that wrapping the burial; balls of cotton thread; bast fibers (pos- sible junco); two gourd (lagenaria) tubes 10 and 12 cm. long containing lime, possibly for use in chewing coca; a small square cloth bag, 15 by 11 cm., with a draw string; two small orna- mented sticks, one of wood and the other bone, for removing lime from the tubes; a small gourd bowl on which was resting a wooden figurine; a bone needle 14.7 cm. long; and a Spondylus shell. The wooden figurine (Fig. 4) measures 12.3 cm. tall. Head diameter at the ears is 4.5 cm.; hip width, 4.0 cm. Length of the left arm is 5.7 cm.; that of the right arm, 5.2 cm. Body and arms were carved independently from chonta wood, and microscopic examination shows varia- tion in surface finish. The forehead is painted in red and black, like a diadem; lips and neck are also painted, and traces of paint are detect- able on the palm of the hand. Fingers and toes are carefully executed, and the ears, nose, eyes, and mouth are symmetrical. Marine-shell inlay enhances the eyes.

The basket that covered the vessel was made from junco and has the form of a bowl with a flat bottom and slightly insloping walls (Fig. 5). Base diameter is 25 cm.; mouth diameter, 18 cm.; depth, 12 cm. The technique is simple warp float. THE CULTURAL SEQUENCE Based on quantitative and qualitative analy- sis of the pottery from the various excavations, we have attempted a seriation of the Formative period at Ancon. Eleven plain types and 18 decorated pottery types have been recognized, and their fluctuations in popularity permit dis, crimination of five ceramic phases with temporal and stylistic significance. The phases have been given alphabetical designations. Ancon A is represented by the types Ancon Burnished, Ancon Striated Polished, and Ancon Polished. They reflect the introduction of a pot- tery to a sedentary population with a gathering and incipient agricultural subsistence economy. The superposition of phase A and its fusion with the preexisting culture is clearly evident in T-1 and its extension T-1A, as well as in the profile of the 40-m.-long bulldozer cut (Fig. 1). At Ancon, at least, there seems to have been a gradual evolution, with assimilation of new cul- tural elements by the resident population. This initial pottery is sparse and occurs in equal fre- quency to the twined and looped cotton textiles, which are the best indicators of late preceramic peoples on the Peruvian coast. Ancon B is defined by the types Ancon High- ly Burnished, Ancon Brushed, Ancon Striated Polished, Ancon Linear Incised, and smaller proportions of Ancon Coarse Red, Ancon Coarse Black, and Ancon Polished Black. The most characteristic pottery of this phase is plain, oxidized in firing, and thin walled (4 to 6 mm.), occasionally with floated surfaces. Sur- face finish is typically highly polished, striated or brushed, with prominent smoothing and polish- ing tracks. The principal vessel forms are con- stricted-mouthed ollas with ovoid or globular bodies and interiorly thickened or slightly bev- eled rims. Other forms include rounded bowls and bottles with long necks. Decorated sherds are rare, and techniques include red and white slip and broad rectilinear incision. This period is clearly defined stratigraphically in T-1, T-4, the three pits in the Willey sector, and pits I and VI excavated by Willey and Corbett (1954). Ancon C is characterized by the stylistic and cultural complex we have referred to as bi- 228 [ VOL. 33, No. 2, 1968</page><page sequence="4">coinciding with classic Chavin influence mani- fested in the appearance of feline motifs, relief decoration, long-necked bottles, stirrup, spouts, ring stamping, rocker stamping, zoned puncta. tion, etc., and the complete disappearance of painted decoration. A few transitional pieces have been recovered which exhibit Chavin influence on the bichrome style, including feline forms, ollas and bowls with painted and zoned punctate decoration, and bottles with both ring-stamped and painted ornamentation.

This phase includes the types Anc6n Zoned Red, Anc6n Red on Orange, Anc6n Cream Slipped, Anc6n Painted, Anc6n Modeled, Anc6n Fine Polished Black, Anc6n Coarse Red, Anc6n Coarse Black, Anc6n Linear Incised, Las Colinas Incised, and Anc6n Punctate. The walls are thin, but paste usually contains abundant sand and quartz temper. Surfaces are oxidized, leaving a dark gray core, and often polished or slipped. The most common vessel forms are globular jars resembling the Mesoamerican "tecomate," with a constricted mouth and interiorly thickened rim, comma-shaped in profile; short-necked jars with flat or rounded base and globular, elon- gated, or ovoid body; and open bowls with flat, rounded, annular, or pedestal base. Some ves- sels resemble the compoteras of the extreme north of Peru, with tall pedestal and shallow bowl. Dentate, scalloped, flanged, and beveled rims occur, as do zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and fitomorphic modeling. The most frequent type of decoration is broad deep incision com- bined in various ways with modeling and red paint to produce such effects as red-on-orange, orange-on-red, zoned red, zoned orange, red lined, red banded, red circles, etc. These can be grouped into three categories: painting bounded by incision, painting alone, and pigment applied to the bed of incisions. More detailed analysis should permit defini- tion of several subphases within Anc6n C. At present, at least two are clear: an initial period marked by introduction of painted decoration FriG. 4.

Ancon D corresponds to the dominance of Chavin art at Ancon, and Ancon E corresponds to its decline. The latter ends with the rise of regional cultures, represented at Ancon by White-on-red pottery in the variant recognized at the site of Miramar (Patterson 1966). The best evidence of phases D and E was encoun- tered in T-1, in the pits in the tank area, in pits I and VI of Willey and Corbett (1954), in our three pits, and in test I of Lanning (1960). DISCUSSION Reconstruction of the antiquity and diffusion of pottery at Ancon is facilitated by several radiocarbon dates. The first, obtained by Jorge C. Muelle from the upper part of the preceramic stratum, places the end of this period at 2250 B.C. + 80 (UCLA-968). The second date, which corresponds to Ancon A, with pottery and twined cotton textiles, is 1825 B.C. ? 220 (I- 810). The latter may be assumed to reflect the approximate time of introduction of pottery to the central coast of Peru. Additional dates are expected, but meanwhile a few ideas can be suggested on the basis of the two available and comparative evidence from other sites. During the preceramic period on the Peruvian coast, hunters-and-gatherers appear to have occupied the knolls during the winter season. When climatic change occurred and the wild faunal and floral resources were exhausted, they began to settle on the shore, perhaps attracted by the abundant seafood. About this same time, agricultural experimentation probably began. Refuse corresponding to the Late Preceramic period at Ancon is found on the northwestern slopes of Las Colinas. The evidence suggests that people of this time were already sedentary, with a combined gathering and incipient agri- cultural economy. They resemble the prece- ramic inhabitants studied by Bird (1948) at Huaca Prieta on the north coast, where pottery is also intrusive. Survival of preceramic traits in Ancon A implies continuity of habitation, with the addition of ceramics to the preexisting complex, rather than population replacement. The earliest pottery is rare, and vessel forms are few, simple, and utilitarian. Ancon B represents evolution from the pre- ceding phase. Pottery becomes abundant, and the definitive types have affiliations with the initial pottery at Las Aldas, Chira, and Culebras, all on the central coast. The pottery of Las Aldas has been described by Lanning (1960), and radiocarbon dates place it about 1390 B.C. Typological relationships with Ancon B are so close as to indicate the presence of the same cultural complex at the two sites. Ancon C, or the Bichrome period, seems to reflect outside influences on local ceramic de- velopment. No local antecedents have been discovered for the painted decoration, with the possible exception of a few slipped sherds. These Ancon C painted types resemble material exca- vated by Engel (1956) at Curayacu, and de- cribed by Lanning (1961). Lanning has estab- lished four phases: two initial, which are pre-Chavin, and two representing the Chavin period. Curayacu A is dated about 1200 B.C., agreeing with our calculations for the age of Ancon C. There are differences between the pottery of the two sites, however, that may reflect temporal as well as spatial differences. The pottery from Curayacu, for example, is more heterogeneous and more highly evolved. As many as four colors are distinguishable (red, yellow, black, and white), while at Ancon the tone differences are restricted within the red and orange range. In both cases, combination of in- cised and painted decoration is common. At Ancon, geometric motifs predominate and in- clude diamonds, circles, panels, triangles, paral- lel bands, etc., or areas complimenting a modeled figure, while at Curayacu these motifs are sup- plemented by figurative representations (Engel 1956, Fig. lid), which depict a fantastic animal, apparently a combination of bird and fish. More remote affiliations with the Ancon Bichrome phase are evident in the Chiripa ma- terial described by Bennett (1936) and in the cream-slipped pottery of Qaluyo (Rowe 1956), both located in the southeastern highlands. 230 [ VOL. 33, No. 2, 1968</page><page sequence="6">ANCON POTTERY Unfortunately, no description is available for the pottery of the Cajamarca region, although the brief notices provided by Carrion Cachot (1948) and Reichlen (1949) suggest that this region should produce comparable material. This probability is strengthened by the fact that recent investigations by Hemrnan Amat and Luis Lumbreras at Chavin de Huantar have disclosed bichrome pottery closely related to that of An- con C in levels predating classic Chavin (Amat, personal communication). This complex, char- acterized by open bowls, globular ollas, and bot- tles decorated with zoned painting, has been called the Ofrendas phase. Although the evidence is not yet conclusive, it does not seem probable that pottery originated in the highlands or coast of Peru. While natural and artificial frontiers are often significant, it is also important to take into consideration the evidence that is coming to light in the northern Andes and Mesoamerica. Thus, we do not want to overlook the development attained by Forma- tive cultures of the Guayas coast in Ecuador, where the Machalilla culture, characterized by painted d0eoration and dated around 2000 B.C., has been described by Meggers, Evans, and Estrada (1965). Other complexes with painted decoration provide stepping stones toward the north, among them Barlovento, Colombia (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1955); Monagrillo, Panama (Willey and McGimsey 1954); La Victoria, Guatemala (Coe 1960); and Tlatilco, Mexico (Pifia Chain 1958). The failure to encounter evidence of this decoration on the north Peruvian coast during the Formative period does not rule out the future possibility of discovery. On the other hand, the existence of this and other Formative traits outside the Peruvian frontiers cannot be denied. Among the latter are the Ancon type of compotera, the Ica cups and bottles with bridge spout, which have counterparts as far north as Colombia (Engel 1966), and the wood- en articulated figure from Ancon, which is paralleled in many later Mesoamerican pottery examples. How are these resemblances to be explained? The figure with articulated arms is not an isolated feature; it is associated with globular olla of a form known in Mesoamerica as "teco- mate," with red zoned decoration, with annular- based and pedestal bowls, and with maize agri- culture. In fact, the latter makes its appearance at this time. This situation cannot be accidental. Although there exist many instances of inde- pendent indigenous development in Andean culture, there is also much evidence of introduc- tions from other regions. To deny the existence of these two alternatives would be to limit the scope of investigation. In our view, the wooden figure from Ancon has a special potential significance in the recon- struction of Formative art and culture, both because of its form and of its antiquity. The execution of human figures is widespread in the New World, with a considerable variation in technique, style of representation, and material of manufacture. The oldest figurines yet discov- ered may be those of the Valdivia culture of coastal Ecuador, made first of stone and later of pottery, and dated between about 3000 and 2000 B.C. (Meggers, Evans, and Estrada 1965: 95-107). In Mesoamerica, figurine modeling reaches its highest development in such cultures as Tlatilco and other members of the Olmec tradition. In the central Andes, pottery figurines have been reported from Las Aldas (Ishida and oth- ers 1960: 196) on the central coast, and stone ones from the Kotosh phase at Kotosh in the north highlands (Izumi and Sono 1963, Pl. l la, 4-5). Figurine manufacture appears to reach its highest development and popularity during the Chavin period. Prior to this time, it is very rare, and the Ancon example is the more impor- tant because of the skillful technique and artis- tic execution that it exhibits, implying the exist- ence of a previous tradition. Whether this was developed within or beyond the Peruvian fron- tiers is as yet unknown. Acknowledgments. Field work was carried out with the valuable assistance of Lorenzo Rossello Truel.
