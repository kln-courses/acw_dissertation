<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES V vol. XVI No. 1 March 1982 Thorstein Veblen and His Socialist Contemporaries: A Critical Comparison Donald R. Stabile The relationship between institutionalism and Marxism has never been a clear one. Thorstein Veblen, as is well known, had a high regard for Karl Marx, and recently in this journal there have appeared several articles at- tempting to establish connections between current Marxism and Veblen and the Frankfurt School and Veblen.1 These articles have emphasized the lessons Veblen's works contain for Marxist thinkers in light of later criti- cisms of his works. Another, vital perspective on the relationship between institutionalism and Marxism can be gained, however, through a compari- son of Veblen and his contemporaries among the Marxian intellectuals attached to the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Veblen retained an avid interest in the prospects for socialism in the United States; his writ- ing carried intentional messages for U.S. socialist intellectuals concerning their own appreciation of those prospects. Specifically, Veblen thought U.S. Marxists to be wrong-headed for their reliance on a highly restrictive theory of economic determinism and the concomitant belief that socialism was inevitable. To provide an antidote to this socialist optimism, Veblen set forth an analytical framework that avoided a pure economic determin- The autihor is Assistant Professor of Economics, St. Mary's College of Maryland, St. Mary's City.

Stabile ism and so eliminated the theoretical conclusion that socialism was in- evitable. It is part of the tragedy of the SPA that its intellectual leaders were unable to appreciate the insights Veblen sought to provide for them. There was, moreover, a subtler tragedy which Veblen and the socialist intellectuals suffered in common: Their writings failed to win over a broadly based or powerful constituency. Socialism as a political move- ment in the United States has never been strong,2 while institutional eco- nomics remains singularly disconnected from the mainstream of U.S. intel- lectual discourse. In a recent article Allan Gruchy pointed out that an explanation for the low status of institutional economics "is that it does not have a sizable following or constituency in the world beyond academic walls as do other types of economics."&lt;3 Gruchy's comments are relevant here because the problem he describes is similar to that faced by Veblen and the early U.S. socialists. Any economic or social theory that propo- nents expect to have an effect on society must secure strong backing. To attain such support, institutionalists, Gruchy contends, should "nourish a following or constituency in the labor movement." He finds instead that in the past institutionalists, especially Veblen, have not analyzed the trade union movement "in a manner that would be calculated to attract the interest and support of the progressive and socially concerned labor leaders. "4 The group Gruchy has singled out for special appeal by institutionalists, organized labor, has, however, also been a part of the supposed followers of Marxian socialists. Marxians have long held that workers, even the so- called aristocrats of the craft unions, are all endowed with a potential for revolutionary action. It would seem that Marxists and institutionalists are on a collision course if both camps seek the support of organized labor; unless, of course, both camps agree to join in common pursuit of social- ism. At this juncture the relationship between Veblen and his contempo- raries in the socialist ranks can be perceived as raising a vital question. Veblen was interested in socialism, but because he thought them to be too much a part of the U.S. business system, he ignored organized unions as a medium for achieving it. In their early years, the Marxians at the SPA were often optimistic about labor's necessary support for socialism. What did Veblen learn from the socialists as to the necessity for winning labor to their joint cause? The answer this article provides-that he was not able to learn anything-stems not from a lack of dialogue between Veblen and the Marxists. Rather, it results from a common error in the theoretical sys- tems of both Veblen and the SPA intellectuals. Despite their divergent theories of economic development and the inevitability of socialism, Veb- len and the socialists agreed on the place labor would hold in a socialist</page><page sequence="3">Thorstein Veblen 3 system if it were installed. It was not a place to which organized labor would aspire. Before that place can be scrutinized, however, the ideas of Veblen and the socialists must be set forth and compared, starting with the socialists. Early U.S. Socialist Theory The theoretical framework set forth by U.S. socialists did not derive wholly from the works of Marx. While the basic elements of that theory and much of the associated rhetoric of the SPA had a direct tie with Marx- ist thought, there were two further influences on the intellectuals of the SPA, the revision in Germany of Marxian theory by Edward Bernstein and a native theory of socialism put forth by Edward Bellamy. The effect of these new ideas, however, was not entirely wholesome. Commentators on U.S. socialism have noted the large influence of Bel- lamy on the movement. Howard Quint, David Shannon, and Milton Can- tor all indicate that U.S. socialism "owed more for its inspiration to Edward Bellamy's Lookinig Backward than it did to Karl Marx's Das Kapital."5 Not that U.S. socialists ignored Marxism; they claimed to be Marxists and to practice within the Marxian framework. But the Marxian theory to which they turned for guidance reflected the ideas of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). As a result, where we might have ex- pected Marxism to act as an antidote to Bellamyism, SPD theory supple- mented it. Both German Marxism and Bellamyism reinforced the political bias of U.S. socialists. Their vision of socialism as a political reorganiza- tion of society derived from Bellamy's work; the theoretical strategy for accomplishing that reorganization evolved in Germany. To understand the directions U.S. socialist theory took, we must consider both these influ- ences, for the theoretical problems of German Marxism shed light on the practical difficulties that beset realization of the Bellamy vision. Bellamy and Nationalization In the early 1 890s there was a brief flurry in the popularity of the works of Edward Bellamy. Bellamy's writings, because they helped make a ver- sion of socialism respectable in the United States, long held the attention of U.S. radicals.0 Following Bellamy's direction, Nationalization Clubs sprang up throughout the nation, and 161 were chartered by 189 1. Even- tually, the movement petered out, but Bellamy's ideas retained a vitality among radical thinkers. In broad terms, Bellamy added a non-Marxist element to U.S. socialism. Under his influence the aim of socialism became</page><page sequence="4">4 Donald R. Stabile less lofty than Marx's vision of human liberation. As Bellamy put it, the primary goal of socialism would be to achieve "production for use and not for profit."8 In specific terms, Bellamy had two effects on U.S. socialists. First, he provided them with a model for the transition to socialism through polit- ical action. As control of the economy through trusts became held by a few capitalists, Bellamy wrote, the national government backed by the vast majority of the population nationalized industry and operated it col- lectively. As the people had achieved their political freedom, they would win their economic freedom. The version of socialism Bellamy presented, which was his second effect on socialists, operated effectively because under it political democracy extended into the economic sphere. The actual administration of the cooperative commonwealth Bellamy envi- sioned contained no localized democracy, however. Under the rule of a national council, the community's work force organized into an industrial army with twenty-four-year terms of duty for all.9 As Bellamy outlined his model, "the industrial duty of citizens has been placed on the same basis on which their military duty now rests." The efficiency and spirit of military organizations impressed Bellamy favorably, especially when he compared them with the anarchy of capitalism and the conflicts among the members of capitalist society over income. Under the new system, all members of society were required to work. With measurement of individual contribution impossible, all labor had to be paid equally. But to provide incentives, the best workers advanced through the ranks by demonstrating their ability.10 With a national council of elite workers planning the economy, Bellamy's system left little room for direct worker control over production. The need for efficient produc- tion outweighed considerations of worker alienation. After all, the regi- mentation and authority workers confronted under Bellamy's socialism reflected favorably when compared to the conditions they experienced under capitalism. U.S. socialists and Veblen retained a durable adherence to the Bellamy model as their guiding principle for socialist organization. The elements of SPD theory which U.S. radicals incorporated into their thinking did not contradict Bellamy's influence. Bernstein's Revision of Marxism Within the SPD, although it was officially Marxist and therefore com- mitted to working class socialism, Edward Bernstein's suggested revisions in Marxism awakened an interest in reform as opposed to revolutionary socialism. Acting independently of SPD leaders, Bernstein undertook to</page><page sequence="5">Thorstein Veblen 5 update socialist theory by reinterpreting class struggle with an evolution- ary approach. As part of that approach Bernstein described how trusts slowed the pace of social change; trusts had become increasingly impor- tant in producing commodities.'1 In Bernstein's view, capitalists avoided crises by employing the corporate form of business organization to pro- mote the large-scale coordination of production; capitalism could survive for a long time. Bernstein concluded that the best prospects for socialism lay in its gradual advance through reform.'2 Among orthodox Marxists, Karl Kautsky and Rosa Luxemburg se- verely criticized Bernstein's revisions of Marxian theory. Kautsky and most members of the orthodox SPD differed only slightly from the Bern- stein revisions. Indeed, as Russell Jacoby pointed out, the revisionists merely indicated the reality of SPD politics.13 But this congruent accept- ance of the worthiness of revisionism encountered a harsh challenge, for an incisive critique of Bernstein flew from the orthodox pen of Luxem- burg. Bernstein's supposition that capitalism remained viable had a nota- ble flaw, she insisted. The inevitable breakdown of capitalism marked the point of departure in the debate between the revisionists and the orthodox in Germany. The revisionists located the ills of capitalism in the anarchy of production; competitive capitalism could not coordinate national pro- duction. But that problem could be solved by corporate or state planning. So the revisionists sought a gradual state takeover of industry. Since cap- italists avoided a final collapse, socialists were foolish to await the right material conditions for a revolution. Let the capitalists organize produc- tion, the SPD reformers argued, and then have a socialist state take over the organized industry. In combatting this view, Luxemburg insisted that the transition to socialism had to be directly linked to the inevitable break- down of capitalism.14 Indeed, the collapse of capitalism made socialism necessary. No specific political strategy attached to Luxemburg's analysis of the breakdown, but she clearly recognized the revisionists' dilemma. If social- ism was not necessary as a follow-up to a collapsed capitalism, why strug- gle for it? In Luxemburg's view, the revisionists had reduced the inevita- bility of socialism to a desire.'5 Moreover, the revisionists had no well- grounded theory of how economic or social conditions inculcated the masses with that desire. Instead, they interpreted it as the outcome of a maturing ethical sense; the growing interest in socialism derived from the masses' perception of the moral correctness of cooperative production. But then nothing limited the claim of morality to the working class; all members of society were capable of developing a socialist morality. So the socialists in the United States learned no more from the SPD</page><page sequence="6">6 Donald R. Stabile than they gleaned from Bellamy. Socialism could be achieved easily when a majority of society desired it. But the U.S. socialists retained a seemingly contradictory theoretical perspective. While they accepted the Bernstein view that capitalist planning succeeded in eliminating the anarchy of pro- duction and avoided a final collapse, they retained their belief in the in- evitability of socialism. They interpreted the capitalist organization of production, as evidenced by the merger movement in the United States from 1896 to 1904, as laying the foundation for socialism. All that re- mained for establishing socialism was the nationalization of trusts by a popularly elected socialist government,'"i just as Bellamy argued. To make the outcome inevitable, socialists put forth a diagnosis that capitalist eco- nomic conditions spawned a socialist consciousness. An A mericanized Historical Materialism U.S. socialists were thus compelled to attain a theoretical analysis that replicated the Bellamy and Bernstein results yet rendered them a necessary outcome. In short, they were obliged to indicate how their proposed fol- lowers aroused a socialist consciousness directly from capitalist economic and social conditions. Certainly, Marxian theory was vital for mapping out the socialists' position. U.S. socialists chose to rely on Marxian his- torical materialism as adapted to U.S. conditions. They generally referred to their theory as economic determinism. In their exploitation of economic determinism, U.S. socialists often applied the version of that theory expounded in E.R.A. Seligman's The Economic Interpretation of History (1902) and Charles A. Beard's An Econiomic Interpretation of the Constitutioni of the United States (1913). Seligman clearly specified as his thesis that "to economic causes ... must be traced in the last instance those transformations of the structure of society which themselves condition the relation of social classes and the various manifestations of social life."17 U.S. thinkers, however, frequently equated economic causes with the economic interest in income and prop- erty of the various classes. The masses would espouse socialism because it increased their income. Seligman and Beard stated respect for Marx as a scholar, but Beard also attributed the class-economic theory to James Madison's statements on factions in the Federalist, number ten. Daniel DeLeon, Jeader of the Socialist Labor Party, also viewed Madison as an anticipator of Marx.', In his writing, Madison reduced social action to direct economic gain, especially from property ownership, so this version of him as a Marx-like class theorist was overdone. But in the hands of</page><page sequence="7">Thorstein Veblen 7 SPA theorists the reduction of social action to direct economic gain be- came a commonplace interpretation of historical materialism. For example, John Spargo, a prominent socialist writer and muckrak- ing journalist, reasoned that the focal point in determining class conscious- ness was class-economic interest, even in the face of other strong interests. "It cannot be denied," Spargo wrote, "that in certain circumstances those other interests [religious, racial, civic, and so forth] may become so accen- tuated that class antagonisms are momentarily lost sight of, or completely dwarfed in importance." Because of their special social needs, certain groups, and Spargo specifically mentioned blacks, lost sight of their class- economic interest. But special interests never dominated economic motiva- tion in "normal times."'9 This placing primacy on economic interest con- tained a large difficulty, because the period during which socialists wrote, with its main conditions being set by the growth of big business, could not easily be construed as a "normal time." U.S. conditions presented proble- matic elements that differentiated the United States from the European conditions upon which Marxian theory rested its case. Among the most important of these elements for socialists was the conservativism of the organized labor unions of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) under Samuel Gompers. Socialism and American Labor The United States never had a labor party. Organized labor, thought of by Marxists as a vital ingredient in a socialist movement, rarely worked for the overthrow of capitalism in the United States. The AFL, under the direction of Gompers, held to a conservative strategy; it avoided total de- feat by organizing only skilled workers and rarely participating in politics. Federation unions depended for their bargaining power primarily on the skills of their members. Although other unions, such as Eugene Debs's American Railway Union, experienced brief success in establishing indus- trial unions, only the AFL survived well-organized business attacks on labor. It persisted as a stronghold of skilled workers trying to win gains for its members within the framework of the capitalist system. Admittedly, those among the AFL's members who avowed socialism often threatened seriously the leadership of conservative unionists, but the majority of the AFL was definitely not socialist. The socialist unionists who remained in the AFL never prevented Gompers from openly attacking SPA leaders. In their efforts to attain a foothold in the trade union movement, so- cialists tried to replace Gompers with one of their own supporters among</page><page sequence="8">8 Donald R. Stabile the AFL membership or attempted to compete with and ultimately replace the AFL with more radical unions. Gompers resented their attacks on his and the AFL's power and resisted them. But after a decade of fighting off socialist attacks, in his presidential address at the 1903 AFL convention Gompers demonstrated that his antipathy went deeper than a mere dis- trust of tactics. In words that would often be quoted in the antisocialist press, the venerable labor leader informed socialist intellectuals of the SPA that he had studied their works and found them wanting: "Econom- ically, you are unsound; socially, you are wrong; industrially, you are an impossibility."220 In the debate over socialism that took place at AFL conventions from 1893 to 1912, few words were spent in substantive arguments on the meaning of socialism. Gompers rarely took the time to explain the under- lying discontent of his sharply worded attack, and SPA theorists never dis- puted them per se. What words were uttered directly against the socialists' proposals stemmed from the trade unionists' desire not to impose restric- tions on the rank-and-file members of the AFL. Thus in 1898, Max Hayes, the socialist AFL member from the Cleveland printers, proposed "no political parties shall be endorsed except those bearing on the class con- scious propaganda for abolition of the wage system"; one delegate coun- tered that the union could not force its members to join a particular politi- cal party.21 While this line of argument smacks of rationalization, its emphasis on individual freedom formed a backbone in the unionists' complaints against socialism. In its early state the argument centered on the issue of freedom of choice in employment. In the journals of organized labor various so- cialist ideas were well presented, mainly dealing with the excessive ex- ploitation of society by monopoly capitalism. The socialist common- wealth, in keeping with the theoretical position of U.S. intellectuals of the socialist movement, was depicted in Bellamyesque terms. The continual presentation of this version of socialism enabled one labor writer to claim with apparent truth: "I have never yet met a Socialist who could, or if he could who would say, whether the communal atom, male or female, would have the right to select his or her occupation. Or whether they would not have the right to accept such occupations as were selected for them, by someone placed in authority over them for that purpose."22 Quite bluntly, this writer worried that the hierarchical aspects of the model of socialism set forth by U.S. socialists held no secure place for organized labor. From the perspective of labor unionists the question of supporting so- cialism centered on whether they should sacrifice what little freedom they had under the capitalist system to throw in their lot with a cooperative</page><page sequence="9">Thorstein Veblen 9 commonwealth that seemingly had no place for unions. Bellamy never mentioned unions in his scheme, and the SPA leaders followed suit. One AFL convention delegate raised this issue, arguing that "the entire exer- cises of Socialism would eliminate trade unions and . .. it would be rather inconsistent and not very sensible to inculcate into trades unionism any- thing that would finally destroy it."23 Gompers went farther by advising U.S. socialists that to succeed in winning support from organized labor they must hide their "universal slave-pen cooperative commonwealth ... far back on the shelf among the unessentials to economic justice."24 Gom- pers justified his mistrust of the plans of socialists on the basis of his fear of the potentially abusive power of politics and the state. William Dick, in his treatise on labor and U.S. socialism, found that Gompers's concerns with the potential abuses of the state were fundamental to his antisocial- ism.25 Organized labor had suffered innumerable setbacks from govern- ment intervention in its affairs, quite regularly on the capitalists' side, as Gompers well knew. So his mistrust of the state in itself, whether in a cap- italist or socialist society, had legitimate grounds in labor's experience. The writings of U.S. socialist intellectuals did little to alleviate that mistrust. The quest for a solution to the tactical problem of the proper socialist attitude toward the AFL helped to foster a right and left wing split in the socialist camp. The right wing undertook to sway the AFL by proffering a socialist party platform containing planks designed to bring organized labor into the SPA. But these efforts were offset by the left wing, which thought such planks were unnecessary. Rather, the left wing believed that the economic strength of the craft unions declined as capitalism matured. It was this view with which Veblen concurred and which further alienated organized labor from the socialist camp. The antidote to the AFL antipathy toward socialism was to be found, the left wing asserted, in the craft worker's experience with machinery. As capitalism developed, it was argued, capitalists continually put into use the latest models of improved machinery. Quite often these machines ren- dered craft skills superfluous. Craft workers, because the demand for their skills declined, lost their secure income and relatively high status. This erosion of the skill levels of craft workers swept away the source of the AFL's strength. Lacking skills to organize around, deskilled and unskilled workers would turn to socialism. By introducing machinery, the capitalists created the means of their own defeat. Left-wing writers looked forward to enjoying this scenario acted out, and they cast automatic machinery in a critical supporting role. Beginning in 191 1, the International Socialist Re- view, the leading journal of the intellectuals of the left wing of the SPA, featured a series of articles to demonstrate that the introduction of ma-</page><page sequence="10">10 Donald R. Stabile chinery by capitalists established automated technology as "a progressive factor in industry and that its general use will necessitate a new mode of produc.ion and distribution."26 Between 1911 and 1915 the ISR pub- lished 23 articles describing the features of the elimination of the skill- based power of the AFL by automated machinery.27 A central figure in that camp, as Paul Buhle has documented,&gt; was Austin Lewis. In a long work published in 191 1, Lewis made a clear dis- tinction between a machine proletariat and other workers. Admittedly, Lewis granted, the Communist Maniifesto had pointed out the drudgery of machine work. Unfortunately, he asserted, Marx and Engels's emphasis on the need for creative work had only fostered a socialism that sought individual rights, the socialism of the petty bourgeois, and labor aristo- crats.29 But socialism required the joint action of a revolutionary prole- tariat that separated itself from middle class reformism. In highly mecha- nized terms Lewis described how that militant working class radicalism was inculcated among labor, even when attempts were made to subvert it: In spite of all, however, the worker became more and more dependent on the machine, and continually more subordinated to the movements of the machine. And the machine, though his tyrant, came in the long run to be his deliverer. Gathered about the machine he learned organization; trained and drilled in subordination to the movements of the machine he learned discipline for his own ends, so that the proletarian entering the factory, "an incoherent mass," passes out of it, still a proletariat it is true, but a proletariat who has learned the art of organization and of political expression.30 As the next section will establish, this line of reasoning followed by Lewis derived directly from his reading of the theories of Veblen. Even- tually, this perspective would lead the left-wing socialists to interpret scientific management, at the time organized labor's deadliest foe, as a progressive force for socialism. In seeking help in their struggle against machinery, organized craftsmen received no solace from socialists. In- stead, they learned that socialism promised even greater use of machinery. The socialists were not sympathetic at all to organized labor. The left-wing socialists' penchant for being so casual about winning the support of organized labor derived directly from their belief in the in- evitability of socialism. Since that outcome was pre-ordained, there was no need to pay special attention to the aspirations of organized labor. They were but a small speck in the sweep of history. Veblen shared this view, that the special clamors of organized labor should be ignored, but without believing in the inevitability of socialism. To understand why, we</page><page sequence="11">Thorstein Veblen 11 must consider Veblen's theories as they applied to the specific problems of the potential development of socialism in the United States. The Socialist Economics of Thorstein Veblen To offset their sanguine expectations about the inevitability of social- ism, the intellectuals of the SPA needed to hear a sympathetically pessi- mistic voice carping over the many obstacles inherent in a struggle to overthrow an established social and economic system. In the United States that voice found its tongue in the brooding skepticism of Veblen. Little effort has been expended by commentators on Veblen to understand the implications for socialism inherent in his ideas. Yet, socialist writings in- fluenced Veblen, and in his dissection of U.S. society he confronted analy- tical problems comparable to those encountered by socialist thinkers. Notwithstanding this commonality, Veblen purposefully challenged the Marxian theory employed by U.S. socialists on two grounds. First, while U.S. socialists' analyses used a one-way causation flowing from an eco- nomic base of society to a superstructure of ideas, Veblen interpreted society as an interaction of multiple causations back and forth between the economic base and ideological superstructure. Second, because the outcome of that interaction had no definitive determination, in Veblen's model the ideas of the superstructure were allotted the potential to prevail over the requirements of the economic base. The model Veblen elab- orated, a radical version of Social Darwinism, stressed the stability of a "capitalist consciousness" among all members of society. So he thrust a special burden on socialists and himself of locating an ideology to upset that stability and create a "socialist consciousness." Just because capital- ists organized production in a manner suitable for socialist takeover, there was no a priori reason to assume that the working class, or any class, aroused itself to usurp the power of the capitalist class. This logical deduc- tion from Veblen's theory, when considered as a social outcome, directly disputed the socialists' ascertainment of the strong desire for socialism among antibusiness forces stemming automatically from the contradic- tions of capitalism. It was derived from Veblen's theory of evolutionary economics. Veblen's Evoluitionary Econormics During the years when Veblen was forming his theories, U.S. intellel- tual life bristled with controversy, for a vanguard of adherents to Dar-</page><page sequence="12">12 Donald R. Stabile winian biology had upset the serene thinking common within academic circles. The struggles to supplant the old view of settled science with a new vision of evolution were hotly fought. But in one area of more concern here, Charles Darwin's ideas found quick acceptance; defenders of cap- italism promptly derived conservative social laws from Darwin's theories. Property rights in the United States had long been defended on laissez- faire principles. U.S. Social Darwinists bolstered this defense with their "scientific" proofs. The leading exponent of Social Darwinism in the United States, William Graham Sumner, by arguing that competition allowed only the fit to survive and that only slow evolutionary change was possible in society, articulated a strong defense of the existing cap- italist system.3" That system affirmed its value by surviving; attempts to foster rapid social change must always fail. Although Veblen had studied under Sumner at Yale and retained a life- long adherence to a Darwinian approach, he was not comfortable with Sumner's conclusions about the merits of businessmen. Moreover, soon after leaving Yale, Veblen came under a more radical influence. He never discussed what influenced him, but his wife thought their joint reading of Bellamy's Looking Backward had shifted Veblen's interest to economics and awakened him to his life's work.32 The whole of Veblen's work can be interpreted, as Stephen Edgall has said, as an effort to "recast Bellamy's indictment of capitalism in historical and evolutionary terms."33 But that effort required Veblen to demolish the two foundations of Sumner's thought: the notion that human nature is incapable of improvement and the idea that any impulse for social change must surmount the stiff resis- tance of the mores of society. Although he relied on a radical evolutionary theory of change to inform all his speculations about the course of cultural behavior, Veblen never set forth that theory in full articulation. Yet its thrust is clear. To counter Sumner's arguments Veblen was obliged to establish that human nature permitted modification and that social mores altered. The theory Veblen devised accomplished this crucial task by using the notion of the multiple interplay of instincts (human nature), institutions (social mores), and technology (knowledge of economic production). By assuming that instincts, a term Veblen employed to describe the forces that drove humans toward purposeful action, represented the inter- action of several human traits, Veblen posited a behavior pattern of com- plex reactions to differing stimulation. The pressure of variegated stimula- tion compelled the interaction of several instincts to encapsulate human behavior as a self-contained entity; no instinct operated separably in any behavioral situation. Within this framework, the multitude of possible in-</page><page sequence="13">Thorstein Veblen 13 stinctual responses incitable by diverging stimuli allowed for a widely dif- fering potential for human action. Human nature was flexible and adapt- able.34 For heuristic purposes, Veblen segregated human nature into two clusters of instinctual reflexes, a desire to perform productive work and a need to engage in self-seeking activity.35 Human survival, the ultimate goal of human nature, required economic production. Under the impulse of their bifurcated nature, humans satisfied this requirement through direct production (work) or predation (self-seeking). The degree to which human behavior inclined toward predation or pro- duction depended on the institutions of the society, "the settled habits of thought."36 Taking the cue from Sumner, Veblen argued that economic life conditioned which habits of thought dominated society. In a well- adjusted society, self-seeking activities sublimated into pride in work. But unlike Sumner, Veblen ordained as the economic sphere the gleaning of knowledge of the techniques of production. The problem confronting a society was how that knowledge, which Veblen called technology, would be applied. To be productive, Veblen asserted, technology relied on factual infor- mation about means and materials. Yet, nonfactual rationalizations often interfered with production. Technological knowledge could be infiltrated by institutional thought. Superstition, mythology, custom, and so forth, impeded the elaboration and application of technology.37 To support his contention of conflicting habits of thought, Veblen made a strong distinc- tion between empirical knowledge-the purely factual-and myth-the purely institutional. Human thought accepted both in viewing the world, but a society that avoided a reliance on fact by stressing unprovable insti- tutions severely restricted the use of technology. To combat Sumner's defense of the status quo fully, Veblen would contrive a theory delineating the manner through which the institutions of capitalism imposed restrictions on production and technological advance. But first he had to specify a source for technical innovation. Thus far, Veblen's model, with its potential for human adaptability, placed the bur- den for social transformation on technological change. New methods of production, by altering economic conditions, pressured superstructural in- stitutions to readjust. But what spurred technological innovation? To off- set successfully the appeal of Social Darwinism, and Veblen realized this, he had to devise a theory of technological refinement and improvement. Under the Darwinian premises to which he subscribed, two potential sources for technological evolution existed: cross-fertilization and muta- tion. Under the first view, immigrants, ignorant of the customs of their adopted area, implanted their different methods of production free from</page><page sequence="14">14 Donald R. Stabile the taboos that hindered the indigenous population. But elaborating a theory designed to convey the message that the capitalist structure could be supplanted, because that structure spread rapidly throughout all so- cieties, required Veblen to concoct a mutation methodology of internally derived development. To interpret the process of technical change as in- ternal to the economic system, Veblen postulated an instinct of idle curi- osity under the direction of which humans sought knowledge for its own sake when freed from practical matters.3T The intellectual curiosity of such individuals depended on their rising above the pressure of existing societal thought patterns. Throughout history, Veblen asserted, curious persons speculated on whatever ideas caught their fancy and perhaps created new ideas. But this theory could hardly be counted on to explain social evolu- tion, because the idle curiosity only acted as a random generator of ideas. Societies evolved only when some daydreamer pursued idly his own thoughts, without a care for their application, and then had them accepted. Yet the situation was not quite so hopeless, for in modern society idle curiosity received systematic elaboration as the scientific method. And the method of science, Veblen noted, was ripening into the dominant habit of thought of modern society.39 Under modern life the instinct of idle curios- ity operated under the formal logic of science. Since a proper scientific attitude never accepted experimental findings as final, the process of science continually fabricated new ideas. Translate those ideas into tech- nological innovation, and institutions fell under constant pressure for modification. This abridged version of Veblen's broad theoretical ideas, of course, does not fully convey the complexity of his thought. It overlooks some significant problems as well. For example, we may ask, with John Dig- gins, where did the predatory habits of thought originate?411 In Veblen's theory of cultural development, an early era of peaceful tribal life under the dominance of the instinct of workmanship was transformed into a more barbaric age of forceful aggression and tribal plunder. Although he wriggles around the answer by talking of contamination and self- contamination of the instincts, Veblen never responds with certainty as to why the age of predation set in. There is an answer lurking within Veb- len's analytical framework, and it is one that reveals a vital flaw in his whole argument. On the terms Veblen has provided, the only sure way for predation to enter a peaceful society is through the operation of the in- stinct of idle curiosity. At sorne time in prehistory, Veblen must admit, some idle daydreamer probably startled himself with the sudden insight of the predator's perennial question: Why should I work if I can compel someone else to work for me? This result of idle curiosity would have</page><page sequence="15">Thorstein Veblen 15 devastated Veblen, for it implies that science has its darker side. If idle curiosity leads to a creation of more efficient methods of production, it can also devise increasingly devious techniques for predation. Veblen never recognized this gloomy aspect of his theoretical perspective, so it remained a flaw which would not allow him to see why organized labor might resist the introduction of technological innovation. Not that this flaw detracts from Veblen's critique of capitalism or from the overall thrust of his method. It merely prevented the disclosure of another element of a complex situation. In considering the interplay of human nature, social mores, and economic production, Veblen never assessed any of them as dominating the others. This attitude evinced it- self clearly in Veblen's analysis of the class struggle theory of Marxian socialism. Veblen's friendly criticism focused on the Marxian notion that in society classes struggled over the "material means of life." Veblen claimed that Marx had nowhere established a relationship between the formation of class consciousness and the development of class interest and struggle.4' Marx should have considered that many forces operated in the formation of a class ideology; then he would have been led to elaborate a multicausal theory of social development on grounds similar to those Veblen adopted. The question of historical materialism would have been posed more fruitfully, Veblen asserted, by exploring the extent to which economic conditions informed human consciousness. Veblen judged the question of historical materialism to be more problematic than the ver- sion he imputed to Marx: "It is no longer a question of whether material exigencies rationally should guide men's conduct, but whether, as a mat- ter of brute causation, they do induce such habits of thought in man as the economic interpretation presumes, and whether in the last analysis eco- nomic exigencies alone are, directly or indirectly, effective in shaping human habits of thought."42 The correctness of Veblen's interpretation of Marx need not concern us here.43 More to the point, Veblen's criticisms accurately depicted the economic determinism U.S. socialists claimed to derive from Marx's writ- ings. With his more skeptical approach Veblen sought to infuse a balanced assessment of social development into U.S. socialist methodology. To ease the introduction of his Darwinian approach, Veblen even demonstrated that the reformism of the SPD resulted from its soliciting support within the context of German politics and not from an insidious shifting away from Marxian dialectics toward an evolutionary theory.44 Veblen's in- tended message was that evolutionary theory contained no reformist ten- dencies per se. At a theoretical level, Veblen evoked no response from U.S. socialists</page><page sequence="16">16 Donald R. Stabile through his critique of Marxian theory. That they quoted his statement, "the socialism that inspires hopes and fears today is of the school of Marx,"45 indicated that they had read Veblen's articles on Marx. That they employed the quotation to support their own adherence to Marxian tenets testified that they had not appreciated the lesson Veblen offered them. Socialist misunderstanding of the multicausality aspect of Veblen's approach especially cropped up when they ignored the manner in which his analysis of U.S. capitalism differed from theirs. Veblen's Plan of Research In general terms, Veblen's Darwinian approach to society involved a two-part sequence: Recognize the institutional elements structuring social stability, then identify an operative force conducive to breeding the ide- ological transformation indispensable to a massive upheaval in the socio- economic system. When he transcribed this approach into a research pro- gram for U.S. capitalism, however, Veblen produced uneven results. His great success was in his treatment of the ideological forces of U.S. business principles and the manner through which these trickled down through the nonbusiness classes. But while Veblen astutely identified technology as a force for social change, his efforts to pinpoint human agents capable of freeing technology from business values remained problematic. The key ingredient to Veblen's theory of the stability of capitalist in- stitutions was the leisure class. Many writers, including Sumner and Adam Smith, deplored the habit of the wealthy to spend their riches on unpro- ductive activity. Veblen captured this unsavory element of wealth for all time with his now-classic phrase, "conspicuous consumption," but he went beyond this view to a deeper insight. Initially, Veblen argued, wealth denoted efficient production and thus legitimate prestige, but now it conveyed prestige no matter what its source. "The possession of wealth," Veblen maintained, "which was at the outset valued simply as an evidence of efficiency, becomes, in popular apprehen- sion, itself a meritorious act."46 The phrase emphasized, "in popular apprehension," formed the core of Veblen's theory of the leisure class. The "value of the leisure class"-the stated aim of the inquiry-Veblen found in its effect on the rest of society. He would later establish that the income of the leisure class (that is, capitalists) depended on their preda- tory activities and not on their personal productive efforts, but he first established the crucial function of the leisure class in modern society: legitimation of the institutional framework of capitalism. For a variety of reasons, including economic interest, the leisure class</page><page sequence="17">Thorstein Veblen 17 professed conservative opinion; but their opinions greatly influenced the lower classes. Reduced to a simple form, Veblen's social equation stated: Wealth implied social prestige and conservativism; the prestige of wealth carried over to conservative ideas. The wealthy set the example of be- havior for society, and their model acted "to greatly stiffen the resistance of all other classes against any innovation, and to fix men's affections upon the good institutions handed down from an earlier generation."47 Because of this resistance, social change required more energy than it should. But the lower classes, the only groups capable of providing the operative force for social change, could not generate that energy because (1) the unequal distribution of income, by which the leisure class accumulated wealth, kept the lower classes too poor to have sufficient energy to struggle for change, and (2) even when the lower classes gained excess income, fol- lowing the lead of the leisure class, they spent that excess on conspicuous consumption.48 The lower classes, and here Veblen included the working class,49 spent their excess time and energy slavishly mimicking the extrava- gant consumption behavior of the rich. In addition to lending its prestige to conservative ideas, by bolstering the pecuniary values of capitalism through serving as a monetary model for the lower classes, the leisure class emplaced a large blockade before efforts to restructure society. "In the theory of the leisure class," as Robert Heilbroner wisely noted, "lies the kernel of a theory of social stability."50 Having examined the social features of the leisure class, Veblen turned next to its purely economic activities. In great detail he laid out the fol- lowing features of business in his day as relates to his theory of social change. (1) Businessmen, to maintain the value of their capital, turned to the restriction of production and the depradations of finance for their profits, hence they were no longer strictly productive. (2) In the process of restricting production, businessmen formed large combinations of capi- tal, hence they centralized industry. (3) Competition did compel the in- troduction of new technology, but only when businessmen thought it a propitious time. (4) Labor was not to be included in the business system as an active partner, so it retained the potential for serving as an operative force for social change.5' Points (1) and (2) were Veblen's way of estab- lishing the predatory aspect of the capitalist/leisure class, while points (3) and (4) indicated his view of from whence would come social change. Parallels with the Marxian socialists' analysis in terms of the trust move- ment and labor agitation are noticeably clear here. But a vital difference remained. Due to his Darwinian approach, before Veblen approved the working class as a force for overthrowing capital- ism, he needed to establish two points: This class alone was both compe-</page><page sequence="18">18 Donald R. Stabile tent and motivated to operate efficiently the industrial system, and this competence and motivation derived from the steady pressure of a perma- nent feature of the capitalist system. Here Veblen differentiated himself from the Marxian socialists by denying that any class had a propensity to struggle. The tendency to social conformity, raised by Sumner and elabo- rated by Veblen, necessitated unremitting pressure to cause its disinte- gration. All members of U.S. society held to the pecuniary values of capi- talism. If proletarians remained conservative, the proper inference for Veblen to make was that they accepted the dominant values of their society. The most important thing to be explained about a radical work- ing class consciousness, according to Veblen, was the socioeconomic force that instilled such a frame of mind. When he examined the social causes of labor unrest, Veblen noted an interesting relationship. All the rebellious workers were employed in fac- tories. Earlier writers had praised the salutary effects of factory discipline on workers. Veblen extended this argument to the unusual conclusion that factory work created the right conditions to interest workers in socialism. He achieved this result by asking what feature of factory work caused labor unrest. The answer he proposed, that direct contact with the ma- chine process of production promoted radical thinking among workers, stemmed from a correlation of worker unrest with factory work. This correlation, although prescient, omitted a crucial variable. As John Las- lett has urged, skilled workers compelled to work within machine produc- tion leaned toward radical socialist ideas in response to their loss of skills.52 To apprehend how this omission deflected Veblen's thinking into a fruitless quest for a science-bound socialism, we must follow along with his reasoning. Veblen erred despite his recognition that craft skills declined in importance as a result of machine production. Instead, he considered the generalized skills that machine production required to be a progres- sive change. As capitalists involved themselves with financial matters, they left control over industry to the industrial work force, retaining only a veto power over changes in technology.53 Only the work force in industry, with its general skills, acquired competence to use efficiently the machine process. Furthermore, and this was Veblen's crucial argument, working with machines motivated workers to overthrow the predatory system of business that hindered the efficient production of industry. Under machine production, workers no longer needed complicated craft skills. Instead, they acquired empirical knowledge about machines and materials and how these devices fit into the total production process. The outcome of this training was a general change in the workers' mental outlook. In a short descriptive passage Veblen outlined the features of</page><page sequence="19">Thorstein Veblen 19 that change. "The machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought. It compells the adaptation of the workman to his work, rather than the adaptation of the work to the workman. The machine process rests on knowledge of impersonal, material cause and effect, not on the dexterity, diligence, or personal force of the workman, still less on the habits and propensities of the workman's superiors."54 In short, their work within systematic process manufacturing indoctrinated workers with a skeptical, scientific attitude toward production. The scientific skepticism instilled in workers was central to Veblen's outcome. It served as a counter to business ideology, and Veblen was able to derive positive consequences for socialism from this widespread em- piricism. When workers scrutinized capitalism and its methods with scien- tific skepticism, Veblen asserted, they recognized that the prestige of the capitalist class was a sham. The capitalist class added nothing to produc- tion, skeptical workers realized, so should be eliminated from control over the industrial system and society as a whole. Their pecuniary status was swept away by the workers' empiricism. This scientific animus of workers matured as their work experience within the machine process eroded the pecuniary values long ago accepted by them in full faith. Here was Veblen's practical message for U.S. socialists. In seeking ad- herents to socialism they should consider not only wealth holdings, but also work experience. Those persons in the pecuniary employment of business retained a capitalist ideology, while the workers in industrial oc- cupations evolved a habit of mind more critical of capitalist values. Lack of property ownership and the existence of wage-earning status were necessary but not sufficient considerations in explaining which classes tended to have an interest in socialist ideas. So, Veblen concluded, the industrial work force alone represented the vital social force to whom socialists should direct their organizing efforts. In addition, Veblen had provided an explanation for the source of the desire for socialism among workers. The problem Luxemburg raised with the SPD received a solution. Where Veblen and socialists disagreed violently was over Veblen's rea- son for not perceiving an automatic transition to socialism-the capitalists had the capability to offset a socialist consciousness among workers. So- cialists never considered what opportunities capitalists had available to counter the socialists' attempt to win over the working class. At first glance, the theory outlined by Veblen also foretold the inevitable coming of socialism. To prosper, capitalists introduced machines; those machines influenced workers toward socialist ideas. Therefore, by spreading the use of machines, capitalists undermined the authority of their own ideology and created a climate for ready acceptance of socialism.</page><page sequence="20">20 Donald R. Stabile But Veblen never intended to imply that the workers' acceptance of socialist ideas evolved automatically and without efforts expended by capitalists to offset them, either deliberately or unconsciously. Instead, he outlined several possible approaches with which capitalists had sufficient power to offset the socialist bias induced in the working class by the ma- chine process. The schooling system and the press could be employed effectively to reinforce the pecuniary values of capitalism. Both these im- portant social arbiters of taste and human affairs usually promoted the ideological notion of earning money and encouraged conspicuous con- sumption. In Veblen's view, the business interests exercised too much in- fluence over these sources of popular education.55 Veblen pinned his hopes on the machine process because he thought that capitalists could not deflect its direct effect on the working class. Here was Veblen's largest error. Under his model, work within produc- tion inculcated workers with a positive set of social values. Any offsetting values stemmed from workers' experiences outside production; the insti- tutions of business had to impinge on the value structure created in indus- try. The capitalist class could not directly alter the effect of technology on workers. As a result of his holding to this perspective, Veblen never recog- nized that the capitalists retained sufficient power over technology to adapt the machine process to solve the problem of controlling workers. Nor could he be sympathetic to the plight of craft workers. If workers found their jobs distasteful, or irksome as economists denoted the term, that only resulted from the domination of the pecuniary values of the leisure class from outside production. Work carried the imputation of being irksome only when compared to the more glamorous pursuits of the leisure class. Because the leisure class avoided it, work carried no social prestige. Not that workers took no pride in their work-the instinct of workmanship enforced a personal satisfaction from providing for the community's survival; but under capitalist rules, work that had no element of exploit, that is, of making a sharp bargain, had no status. From this perspective alienation existed as the holding of values that derived from social experiences outside the workplace. Thus Veblen distinguished no features of the labor process that contained conditions detrimental to the free development of human consciousness. In this distinction Veblen was in accord with the left-wing socialists, who saw machinery as a progressive force for socialism, despite organized labor's protests. But Veblen did foresee an alternative outcome to the inevitability of socialism. No sooner had Veblen espoused the sanctity of the machine process than he identified another countervailing force in support of conservatism. Through formation of a social bias toward militarism, the business classes</page><page sequence="21">Thorstein Veblen 21 concocted a strong antidote to the injection of a dose of socialist con- sciousness among the working class. A country organized for war disci- plined its people to national solidarity and personal subordination to mili- tary leadership (the highest order of the leisure class). Patriotism exer- cised an influence among the working classes to an extent that they would possibly sublimate their socialist leanings. Certainly, members of the in- dustrial work force exhibited patriotic fervor. A well-ordered militarism accentuated that spirit of nationalism. Veblen specified two tendencies leading toward militarism in U.S. capitalism. The basis for the problems of the business society was the difficulty of selling at a profit the rising sur- plus product resulting from the increased efficiency of the machine pro- cess. Government expenditures, especially on armaments, provided one measure to eliminate that surplus. A second method, exporting the excess product, required the backing of an agressive national policy-more militarism. Full-scale militarism imposed a harsh rule on all society, however; al- though it destroyed the socialist aspirations of the working class, it also demolished the natural rights basis of business. Capitalists, too, became subservient to the military leaders. A totally status ordered society re- placed bourgeois democracy, in Veblen's alternate historical denouement; with no progressive force left in society, thus ended cultural growth and progress.56 Although his analysis purportedly hinged on the interaction of multiple causations, Veblen actually limited the shaping of events to two social tendencies, business or industry. Ultimately, the outcome depended on whether business principles or industrial values dominated social evolution. To avoid the determinism and teleology he criticized in others, Veblen posited two determinisms which led to two ends: Historical development in U.S. capitalism tended either toward socialism or militarism in Veblen's theory of evolutionary change. Now Veblen allegedly assumed these determinisms and teleologies as working hypotheses to be tested by experience, but they remained sep- arate determinisms. The dual outcome of the potential evolution of the U.S. business system, as Veblen presented it, allowed insufficient flexi- bility for a mediation between the two forces of business and industry. Had he strictly held to the interacting factors theory, Veblen would have allotted the business community mode credit for adjusting to the effect of the machine process and the threat of militarism. In particular, he might have learned that the capitalists, with the aid of engineers, employed the sacred machine as an implement for weakening the work force in industry. The idle curiosity could be employed in predatory endeavors. Despite this failing, the theoretical program initiated by Veblen con-</page><page sequence="22">22 Donald R. Stabile tained two direct challenges to U.S. socialist methodology. First, Veblen reduced economic determinism and teleology from attributes of worldly events to imputations by a theorist in the spirit of scientific hypothesis. Second, his evolutionary approach testified to more than one historical outcome of capitalist development. Both challenges aimed at promoting a climate of skepticism in socialist thinking, so U.S. Marxists would ack- nowledge the tentativeness of their own interpretations of the ripening contradictions of capitalism. The Socialist Response to Veblen The intellectuals of the U.S. socialist movement consistently praised Veblen's work, but they ignored his challenge to their methodology and never appreciated the theoretical implications inherent in his problematic analysis of U.S. capitalism. After reading Veblen, socialists retained their faith in the inevitability of socialism as the unidimensional outcome of the class struggle endemic to capitalism. They never acknowledged that non- socialist values maintained a fixed hold over workers' consciousness and threw the outcome in doubt. For example, A. M. Simons, editor of the International Socialist Re- view, in a review of The Theory of Business Enterprise, directly quoted with approval Veblen's arguments for adding work experience to socialist analysis. But Simons denied that any factor offset working class socialist consciousness. After discussing Veblen's dual outcome of socialism or militarism, Simons added: "To the socialist this conclusion is all that he could ask for. He has full faith the proletariat will see to it that no military regime perpetuates business enterprise or supplants the ruling capitalism."57 In a lead article in the International Socialist Review, William English Walling, a prominent socialist intellectual, proclaimed that Veblen pro- vided a new "philosophical backbone" for U.S. socialism. Walling con- sidered Veblen's theory of class conflict to be an advance over Marx's, because Veblen understood that although a majority of Americans owned no means of production, that lack of ownership by itself generated no groundswell of fervor for the socialist cause. But Walling then immediately drew from Veblen's advice the one-sided conclusion that the industrial workers, who evolved a socialist consciousness, increased in numbers as the machine industry spread. By never mentioning the other possible out- come of capitalist development Veblen predicted, Walling easily retained his belief in the inevitability of socialism.58 A similar misinterpretation was evinced in a critique of Veblen and</page><page sequence="23">Thorstein Veblen 23 Walling written by Robert Rives La Monte. By being the "greatest expo- nent, who has yet arisen, of the psychological effects of economic causes," Veblen advanced significantly toward explaining the medium through which the mode of production controlled consciousness. But La Monte omitted discussion of Veblen's critical appraisal of the reverse causation between institutions and technology. Instead, he concluded that Veblen proved "socialism is inevitable," and the type of socialism engendered by the influence of the machine process "is, of necessity, Revolutionary so- cialism." To Veblen's worrying about nationalistic countertendencies to widespread acceptance of socialism, La Monte replied that anyone who extracted truth from Veblen's depiction of the detrimental development of militarism was "devoid of a sense of humor."59 As the U.S. government's repression of socialism on national security grounds during World War I intensified, however, the humor proved to be black. The more moderate socialists also appreciated Veblen's work. The first edition of the socialist New York Sunday Call reprinted Veblen's article, "The Evolution of the Scientific Point of View."60 An editorial billed it as a serious intellectual article for the education of workers.61 Several months later, the Sunday Call published another of Veblen's articles. An editorial announcing it concluded that it testified to the inevitability of socialism, although "Veblen would not be Veblen if this conclusion were expressed in plain and unmistakeable language."62 Veblen's language was not incomprehensible; the socialists selected from Veblen's writings only those ideas that justified their own activities. For them, theory remained a fixed set of guidelines; they never considered it as a working hypothesis to be tested in practice. They only sought in- formation concerning which social groups voted for them. If socialist po- litical campaigns succeeded in winning more ballots, and the vote total for socialists rose in each election, U.S. socialist theory had been vindicated. Among the socialist advocates of machinery, Veblen exercised a more direct influence. These left wingers aimed at establishing a socialist base among unskilled workers, so they focused on the capitalist use of auto- matic machinery. As Paul Buhle has discussed, Austin Lewis, an eminent theoretician of this sect, incorporated Veblen's insights into the psychol- ogy of the machine process into his own formulation of the social effect of factory work. Lewis's faith in Veblen's analysis was high. After quoting extensively Veblen's writings on the cultural incidence of the machine process, Lewis boldly asserted: "It does not appear that any serious and effective attack can be made on the validity of these conclusions."63 That organized trade unions had indeed made an effective attack on these con- clusions escaped the notice of Lewis and was beyond the understanding of</page><page sequence="24">24 Donald R. Stabile Veblen's approach. It is little wonder Veblen's institutionalism made no headway among organized labor. Conclusions Veblen's following among U.S. socialist intellectuals also remained sparse. The height of his influence, even when it only served to reinforce socialist expectations about the inevitability of socialism, was reached in his salad days, shortly after publication of The Theory of Business Enter- prise in 1904. Thereafter it waned, and Veblen's works received scant at- tention in the socialist press. Primarily, socialists could derive his positive conclusions about the prospects for socialism from their own theories; his negative comments they would rather he kept to himself. No one likes a doubting Thomas, least of all the orthodox pillars of the one best way. U.S. socialists faced difficult tasks enough without having to explain away a pessimist in their camp. But the one area in which a dialogue between Veblen and U.S. socialists might have been fruitful, namely, their analyses of organized labor, re- mained barren. Neither Veblen nor the revolutionary left wing of the SPA offered the other any insight into the needs and aspirations of the trade union movement. Instead, Veblen and the socialists set out a theoretical slot for labor to fill. For the socialists, the labor movement would act as the revolutionary brigade that would carry them to power; in Veblen's schema, labor would serve as the empirically oriented human agents for freeing technology from business values. When the AFL did not meet with these theoretical expectations, it was abandoned as a force for socialism. That abandonment was unfortunate, because the members and leaders of the AFL had an important lesson to impart to Veblen and the socialists: Organized labor did not find favor with the hierarchical system of social- ism that these radicals were proposing. Veblen and the socialists relied heavily on the Bellamy description of socialism for their model. The Bel- lamy vision, however, which derived from the trust system, granted few important freedoms to workers as individuals or as groups. Everything went according to plan in order to maximize efficiency. Workers, the mem- bers of the AFL tried to tell the proponents of socialism, wanted to decide their affairs for themselves, especially affairs directly related to their daily work. That is a message institutional and Marxian economists must still take to heart. Institutional economists have a single policy that would be attrac- tive to organized labor, the notion of national economic planning. Present- day Marxists also believe in the need for an overall scheme for planning</page><page sequence="25">Thorstein Veblen 25 the economy. Both groups need to come forth with proposals for national planning that would include authentic participation by labor. The setting forth of such proposals would provide two important benefits. First, in devising such proposals economists would be wise to include labor leaders as part of the development process, thereby initiating contact between themselves and the leadership of the group they seek as constituents. This contact could lead to a joint effort wherein the ideas of unorthodox econ- omists could be linked up with the political clout of unions. At the same time, unions would have an alternative proposal to fight for independently of their present political allies. Second, the process of developing a pro- posal for national planning would open a dialogue between institutional and Marxian economists, a dialogue that has not existed since the days of Veblen, and not to any great extent then. Both these groups of unorthodox economists share perspectives, especially when compared to mainstream economics. Yet, they have never been able to put those common perspec- tives to common use. Agreement with labor on a proposal for national planning would go a long way toward fostering good relations between Marxists and institutionalists. Those good relations and the success of the entire undertaking will re- quire some reticence on the part of both groups of economists: They must not enter into the undertaking with preconceived expectations of what labor's role in the process will be. Labor's role must be worked out through joint consultation with organized labor. Whether the two schools of un- orthodox economists accomplish the difficult task of working as equals with labor is a question beyond the scope of this article. That Veblen and his socialist contemporaries were unable to work among themselves or with labor has been an underlying theme of this analysis. Whether that failure doomed Veblen and institutionalism to subordinate status in eco- nomics and rendered Marxian socialism permanently unpalatable to U.S. labor is a conclusion too bleak and speculative to be entertained, at least just yet.
