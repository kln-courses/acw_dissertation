Vivekananda and other Neo- Vedantins tried to reconcile all religions into "the infinite arms of Vedanta" as in an all-inclusive meta-religion. Radha- krishnan extended to all faiths the conception of samanvaya (harmony). But for Safikara, samanvaya is of the Upanisads only, although he may say almost casually that the one Atman is the ultimate referent of all human views and teachings. He rejects the pretention of Samkhya, Vaisesika, etc. to have issued from "omniscient" teachers and thus reliable teachers of liberation, and in general, any reliability of "unguided" reasoning or intuition. He is aware of the danger of relativism and his approach is conservative and restrictive like that of MTmamsa. The "qualifications" (adhikara) are determined by Veda; their list should not be extended. A man's intelli- gence is no adhikara. Unlike Ramanuja and other Vaisnava Vedantins, Sankara admits no revelation besides the Veda. Kumarila, who accepts the idea of "lost Vedas," neverthe- less rejects the idea that Buddhist teaching is a lost Veda, because it contradicts the known Veda. Yet he traces Jaina and Buddhist ahimsa to some Vedic rules, and some of their philosophy to arthavadas or Upanisads. While criticizing them, he seems willing to credit them with a relative and paedagogical usefulness and to find a value in the confronta- tion of different views. But, on the ground of Vedamulatva, he rebukes the objection that, if variety is acceptable, one should include all possible variations. The similar objection that the "word of the Lord" (as Nyaya views the Veda) may be found in other traditions is refuted by Jayantabhatta on the ground of the restrictive rule mahijana parigrhitatva (accept only what the majority-or the great-accept). Kumarila rejects this criterion as well as loka-prasiddhi (com- mon acceptance). Around A.D. 500, the BrahmaSabda Vedan- tin, Bhartrhari, had taught that the Speech-Brahman differ- entiates itself into all human views and teachings!

The Appendix presents notes towards the elucidation of the gankara or Pseudo-gahkara authorship of Yoga-sitra- bhasya-vivarana.

DE NOBILI COLLEGE, POONA The Decipherment of the Indus Script. By S. R. RAO. Pp. xxvii + 455, 72 figures, 39 plates. Bombay: ASIA PUBLISHING HOUSE. 1982. Rs. 500.00. The problem of deciphering the Indus script has engaged the concentrated efforts of scholars for the past fifty or more years. In spite of their intensity and persistence, however, these efforts have been attended by generally unconvincing results. Yet, as with a great archaeological excavation, where each spade of earth that is turned reveals some fragment of the whole picture, so each of these attempts has contributed an additional bit of knowledge, sometimes positive, some- times negative, that illumines some aspect of the whole or invalidates some view that has been fixedly held over the years. One such view to which almost every investigator of this enigmatic script has clung, seemingly without ques- tion, is that the enciphered language is a form of Dravidian, although there is not really a shred of tangible evidence to indicate the identity of this language beyond the universal supposition that the people who inhabited India prior to the coming of the Aryans and referred to in the Rgveda as Dasas or Dasyus-noseless, dark-skinned and of contempt- ible speech!-were speakers of Dravidian. The problem with the Indus script is closely analogous to that posed by the Linear B script of Crete, neither the script nor the identity of the language of the tablets being known. Here too, until the very beginnings of the decipherment there was the virtually impregnable notion, fostered by Sir Arthur Evans, that the language was Minoan, but surely not Greek. Michael Ventris, its decipherer, himself, though he dared for a while to think of Etruscan, expressed his surprise when he was compelled by the gradual results of his work to admit that the language was Greek, more precisely, as it turned out, a very early form of it now termed Mycenaean Greek. One of the difficulties that has continually impeded the decipherment of the Indus script is the determination of the exact number of its symbols. On this point scholars have varied greatly in their conclusions, some counting more than 400 separate signs, others as few as 150. The importance of this determination is very great, however, since the nature of the writing system-whether pictographic, logographic, syl- labic, alphabetic or mixed-is implicit in the number of symbols. The author, Dr. S. R. Rao, is of the opinion that the Indus script passed through several stages of develop- ment, the number of signs being much reduced in the latest phases, as exemplified particularly by late seals from Mohen- jodaro, Lothal B, Rangpur and Daimabad. He concludes that in Early Harappan (2500-1900 B.C.) the number of signs amounts to forty linear forms and twelve pictograms, but this figure was halved in Late Harappan (1900-1600 B.C.). This drastic reduction in the number of basic signs, as com- pared with the much higher totals arrived at by other schol- ars, is due to the fact that the majority of the signs in the inscriptions are modifications of the basic signs made by adding short strokes and by doubling or compounding two or more signs with or without the appendage of these strokes. These processes of modification of the basic signs are essen- tially like those found in ASokan BrahmT and KharosthT and inherited by all the later derivative Indic writing systems. Finally, then, because of its limited number of basic signs the 374</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books Indus script has to be classified as phonetic, partly syllabic and partly alphabetic. In assigning phonetic values to the twenty basic signs of Late Harappan, Dr. Rao is guided by the more or less con- temporary consonantal Semitic scripts of the Lachish and Ahiram inscriptions (c. 1600-1300 B.c.), seventeen of whose signs are shown to bear remarkably close resemblance to those of Late Harappan. One other sign is given the value a on the basis of its similarity to the Byblos sign for aleph- hamzah. On the basis of these and other assumptions are presented transcriptions and translations of about 200 short inscriptions containing only signs whose value has been deter- mined by comparisons with the Semitic letters. From these transcriptions it is concluded that the enciphered language is a very early form of Indo-Aryan. It may be objected that, while there do indeed appear to be some familiar Indo-Aryan words in these brief inscriptions, as, for example, maha 'great' (inscription #38, figure 17, p. 74) and dasa 'ten' (inscription #24, figure 17A, p. 75), other words, which are not readily recognizable as Indo-Aryan, are interpreted as such by a fancied likeness to late Vedic words of dubious currency. Some of these Vedic words are, moreover, artificial usages to be found in the Brahmanas and cannot, therefore, be said to have the status of actual words. Thus, the author interprets a recurrent ka as 'Prajapati' (p. 57), although ka in this sense is a later Brahmanical misconstruction of the interrogative pronoun ka occurring in the refrain of RV X. 121 and hardly admissible as a word, at least in so early a stage of Indo- Aryan as would be represented in these inscriptions. Simi- larly, ga (said to occur in the Maitrayani Samhita) is taken as a name for Brhaspati (p. 55), though alternatively also as 'singer'. Most of the words are interpreted as monosyllabic roots, used as nouns or adjectives, some of them in fairly common use in the Rgveda, where, however, they are gener- ally found at the end of compounds. Many of the interpreta- tions give the impression of rather farfetched analyses, as pah-itaha (inscription #3, figure 17A, p. 69), said to mean 'protector of the illuminated', from pah 'protect' (a root used as a noun), equated with Hittite pah, which, with loss of -h, gives pa (= Vedic vpa) + ataha (cf. Vedic a-vtan 'extend, penetrate, illuminate'). But apart from other questions that might be raised here, what grammatical form is ataha sup- posed to be? If it is a past passive participle, as implied in the translation 'illuminated', we would expect *atata in Early Indo-Aryan, as in Vedic. Moreover, pah-ataha would, by the author's interpretation, be a type of compound quite alien to nominal composition in Indo-Aryan as also in Indo- European. Dr. Rao endeavors to explain the doubling and aspirating of initial consonants as a means of emphasizing them, when the writing system was in transition from a syllabic stage to alphabetic, or alternatively to denote intensive formations. Examples of this peculiar phenomenon are: ppaka for paka 'protector', ppat for pat 'governor' (cf. Vedic pdti 'lord'?), ppara for para 'supreme'; phah for pah 'protect', dhaksha for daksa 'able'. There is also an interchange between ph and bh, thus: phadra for bhadra 'auspicious'. The signs for man and fish, which are of frequent occur- rence throughout the inscriptions, are neither equated with Semitic letters nor are they treated as ideograms, but as phonograms, to which are assigned the values r/r and s respectively. The procedure by which these values are arrived at, however, seems scarcely supportable: to the fish sign he gives the value s from the initial consonant of sakuld 'fish', in accordance with the acrophonic principle, rejecting as candi- dates for consideration the synonymous words jhasd, mdtsya and mTna, as the values jh/j and m gotten from these, would not yield meaningful words in the contexts where they occur and, furthermore, a sign for m comparable to the Semitic sign already exists in the system (p. 90). But all these words (sakuld, jhasd, mdtsya, mTna) are of different age, and of them only mitsya occurs in the Rgveda, in spite of the author's contrary assertion. To the signs for the numerals, which are expressed with vertical strokes corresponding in number to the number designated, are assigned essentially Vedic values: eka, dva, but tr or tra, and so on with various other deviations. According to Dr. Rao, some of these numerical signs were also used as phonograms; for example, the numeral three could designate either the number three or the suffix -tr (as in pdtr) or the root/noun tra/tri 'save; savior'. Thus an inscription transcribed tr-pa-ka (#6, figure 35, p. 146) is inter- preted to mean 'savior guardian' if dissolved as tr (=tra 'savior') + paka 'guardian' or, alternatively, 'pleased Ka (Prajapati)' if analyzed into trpa (cf. Vedic /trp 'be pleased') + ka (on which v. above). The numeral sas 'six', in the tran- scription of which he vacillates between seks and shash (p. 111), may serve as a phonogram for sas (sic!) or sas 'command, rule' or, as a noun, 'ruler'. Thus, an inscription transcribed shash-h-vrsha-ha (#6, figure 38, p. 158) is ren- dered 'ruler vigorous Ka (Prajapati)', although alternative renditions are given. A number of other pictorial signs regarded as depicting the leaf of the pipal tree (Ficus Religiosa), scorpion, bird, field, insect, hand, hill and horn are treated as phonograms and, on the basis of the initial syllables of the Vedic words selected by the author as expressing these ideas, viz., asvatthd, vrscikd, saktunta, ksetra (and ksatrd 'dominion'), mdksa,* hdsta, ddri and sirnga, these signs are allotted the values aiv, vrs, sak, ksh/ksha, makh (!), has, adr (but apparently adr is meant, to judge from the transcriptions given in the figures, as in 45, p. 177) and irn. * The author writes maksha, but Mayrhofer, Kurzgefasstes etymologisches Worterbuch des Altindischen (Heidelberg, 1953-76), II. 540-41, indicates that the two Rgvedic occur- rences of maksah (IV. 45.4 and VII. 32.2) should be taken as nominative plurals of a noun mdks, not mdksa. 375</page><page sequence="3">Journal of the American Oriental Society 105.2 (1985) The author points to clear archaeological evidence of the continued use of signs of the Indus script in widely separate parts of India down to c. 500 B.C. and even later, stray signs and graffiti having been found in the Ganges-Jumna doab (Lal Qila and Alamgirpur), Central India (Eran), in the valleys of the Tapti and Godavari (Theur and Chandoli) and in Gujarat (Rangpur and Machiala Mota). The basic Late Harappan signs, moreover, appear on the Jorwe pottery, unearthed at Daimabad, a chalcolithic site in Maharashtra. Formerly there had been an immense chronological gap between the latest known traces of the Indus civilization and the beginnings of traditional Indian civilization, and many scholars were inclined to regard the two as unrelated, the former having come to an end long centuries before the arrival of the Aryans and the commencement of the Vedic period. Scholars have in general tacitly adhered to the view set forth by Georg Buhler that the BrahmT script was bor- rowed from the North Semitic and subsequently modified and enlarged on Indian soil to fit the phonetic scheme of Indo-Aryan. But the possibility of its direct descendance from the Indus script in its final syllabic-alphabetic stage seems no longer so remote as previously envisioned. In this regard it is important to bear in mind that the peculiar characteristics of BrahmT, viz., its method of combining unvowelled consonants and expressing vowels other than a by means of subsidiary strokes, are shared with the Indus script, though quite absent from the Semitic system. Moreover, BrahmT, as seen in its full-blown form in the Asokan inscriptions, reflects a long period of evolution, both a simplification and a perfection of an older more complex system with similar characteristics. Perhaps also the many regional variations in Asokan BrahmT can be explained as a heritage from the local varieties of the old Indus script. There is an extensive chapter on the Harappan language and its structure (pp. 182-240), which contains a list of both the basic and compound signs and their modifications with the addition of vowel-indicators (pp. 185-198). In the section on nouns (p. 214ff.), while it is emphasized that the majority of the nominal stems are simply roots devoid of any suffix, a number of primary and secondary suffixes are discussed, and lists of words formed with them are are given. Objection may be raised to some aspects of this presentation, for example, that -ra and -da are regarded as secondary suffixes (p. 215), although they are really verbals employed at the end of accu- sative tatpurusa compounds, such as are a ubiquitous feature of Vedic and classical Sanskrit. Thus, Harappan asvada should be treated as asva + -da (vda) 'giver of horses' (asvan dadati iti asvadah). This point ought to have been brought into the section on compounds, p. 220ff. On the assumption that the author's transcriptions are in the main correct, the predominantly monosyllabic nature of Harappan poses a difficult problem, as Early Indo-Aryan ought to be close to its immediate forbear, Proto-Aryan, which, though a hypothesized language, could not have been monosyllabic. Among the case-endings that appear in the transcriptions, viz., instrumental -a, dative -ae/-e, a source of some difficulty is the genitive -ha/-aha (and its variants), but, in any case, although it may be that the presence of this -h- in the genitive is suggestive of a closer affinity of Harappan to Iranian, it cannot be equated with the Vedic-Sanskrit genitive ending -asya (of the a-stems), which is inherited unchanged from Proto-Aryan *-asya and represented in Iranian by -ahya. Perhaps these genitives with -h- should be taken back to Proto-Aryan *-as (from Proto-Indo-European *-es/-os), the appended vowel -a in Harappan being due to some ortho- graphic practice. The rare Harappan alternate ending -ao/-o could be from -o, the sandhi form of *-as. Possibly the end- ing -a, corresponding to Vedic-Sanskrit -ad/-at, which is referred to elsewhere and treated as ablatival (p. 242), ought also to have been included in this section. There are said to be no examples of duals or plurals and no nouns whose gender can be unassailably demonstrated to be feminine or neuter. Nominal compounds, which are much commoner than in the Rgveda, are for the most part tatpurusas and karmadharayas, but there are also a few iteratives and governing compounds. Finite verb forms are hardly to be found, a phenomenon not unexpected in view of the com- mercial character of the inscriptions which are limited to personal names, titles such as ruler, protector, savior, de- fender, etc., and various epithets like mighty, gracious, boun- teous. One or two past passive participles occur, but these fall naturally among the epithets. Not much can be said about the syntax of Harappan in view of the verbless character of the inscriptions and their brevity. Adjectival elements generally, though not invariably, follow their noun. Especially noteworthy are the use of the bare root without ending, both as noun and adjective, and the abundance of nominal compounds, some extending to more than three members. From all of this it is concluded that Harappan, while closely affiliated with Proto-Aryan, reflects a much earlier offshoot of Proto-Indo-European, which, like Hittite in Asia Minor, grew up in relative isola- tion in the Indus Valley and surrounding areas where its speakers evolved their own writing system, later, in conse- quence of numerous mercantile contacts with peoples to the West, drawing upon the Semitic alphabet as an adjunct to their system. That the seals were used for commercial purposes, as had long been suspected, is confirmed by the impressions of woven cloth, bamboo mat, reed and cord on the reverse of sealings made from the seals, found in the warehouse exca- vated at Lothal in Gujarat. The content of the seals or seal- ings bears this out, as they typically read 'of (so-and-so), the protector/ruler/governor', etc., (with or without epithets), 376</page><page sequence="4">Reviews of Books i.e., belonging to him, just as seen on seals of the early historic period. Instead of the possessive genitive, some seals have the dative, presumably to denote the consignee of the merchandise, or the ablative to designate the source. Much space is devoted to a discussion of the titles and proper names that appear in the inscriptions, and an attempt is made to equate them with Rgvedic names; thus, Papr of the seals is related to Rgvedic Pipru, a demon subdued by Indra. Many animals are depicted on the seals with great realism and excellence of workmanship, some of them real animals, others composite and mythical. The inscriptions above do not bear any relation to the animals, as shown by differences in the text when the same animal is represented (p. 263). The author regards these animals as emblems of different peoples, by whom they were venerated or deified, and he goes so far as to assign various regions of the country to the peoples who had this or that animal as their emblem (p. 270). It is suggested that the deification of animals by the Harappans may stem from a belief that they embody certain powers of nature, such as might, virility, etc., and this veneration of animals is correlated with the Rgvedic deification of nature, some passages being cited in which various gods are called a bull, horse or goat. It is even suggested that the paired deities like Mitravaruna and Indramarita correspond to the com- posite figures on the seals (pp. 271-72). In addition to animals there are depicted on the seals various anthropomorphic figures, the most remarkable among which is that on the well-known seal from Mohenjodaro, the so-called Siva-PaSupati, three-faced, seated cross-legged in a sort of a yogic posture, surrounded by a buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant and tiger, and adorned with a three-pronged head- gear. Figures with similar and also additional attributes are seen on other seals. They are considered by the author to be representations of the fire-god of the Harappans, called by them Arka (=Rgvedic arka) in the inscriptions, whom he identifies with Agni of the Rgveda. A good deal is said about confederacies of varying numbers of peoples, especially five and seven, and reference is made to the Five Tribes (or Peoples) of the Rgveda, but not all of this is crystal clear, and the inferences from scanty bits of evidence seem rather sweeping. Highly supposititious are the conclusions regarding geographic names and administrative divisions, as, for example, to say that the hills of the Panjab and Baluchistan were recognized as 'a separate province' ruled by a governor, just because on a few seals are found expres- sions interpreted to mean 'mountain', 'mountain king' and 'governor of the mountain'; or to say, in effect, that the land ruled by the 'ruler of Seven' (sapta sasa), called hapta dvappa (i.e., sapta dvipa), corresponding to Rgvedic saptd sindhavah, must have been 'holy land' because a seal from Kalibangan reads 'auspicious protector' and yet another from Mohen- jodaro mentions an 'auspicious region' (bhadrama dvappa, i.e., bhadrama dvTpa). Perhaps even more tenuous are some of the observations made concerning the administration of the Indus cities and outlying areas. In a separate chapter (pp. 294-98) are treated the religious beliefs and basic concepts of the Harappans as inferred from the inscriptions and depictions on the seals and from the fire-altars and remains of sacrificial victims that have been brought to light by excavations at Lothal and Kalibangan. There was a mother goddess called Nana, who, to judge from her epithets, occupied a high place, but Dr. Rao states that her worship was confined to the Indus Valley, probably because seals bearing her name have not been found else- where. But, curiously, scarcely anything is said in this chapter about Arka, the deity identified with Agni on the Pasupati seal from Mohenjodaro and elsewhere regarded as the chief god of the Harappans. That yoga was practiced by the Harappans is inferred from the yogic posture on this and other seals. A final chapter, intended for the more general reader, summarizes the method pursued by the author in his attempt to decipher the script, the nature of the results and the Indo-European character of the Harappan language and like matter. Many of the seals and sealings are pictured in the plates (pp. 311-54), which serve as an important adjunct to the work, as, apart from the inscriptions on them, they furnish excellent examples of the various motifs, principally the animals, that are so characteristic a feature of the Indus seals. Illustrated here also are the reverses of sealings, showing impressions of cord and packing material, as well as some remarkable artifacts from Daimabad (a bronze chario- teer on a chariot drawn by two bullocks, a bronze rhinoceros, buffalo and elephant, and potsherds with graffiti), fire-altars in Lothal and Kalibangan, a sacrificial ladle from Lothal and an altar with animal bones from Kalibangan. There is a glossary of 254 words extracted from the inscriptions with their normalizations, meanings and cognates in Vedic (pp. 356-85). Following the glossary are a useful grid showing the basic signs with their phonetic values, as they are modified by the vowel-indicators, a bibliography and various other appendices and indices. The decipherment of an unknown script, the enciphered language of which cannot be ascertained beforehand, is intrinsically bound to be a controversial matter, and it is especially so in the case of the Indus script because, as pointed out earlier, so many attempts by scholars of highest repute have gone before. This only conduces to increased skepticism that any fresh attempt will come nearer to the solution, ineluctably making a dispassionate evaluation of Dr. Rao's decipherment and his conclusions the more difficult. It would be undesirable and perhaps also inadvisable at so early a stage as this to say that his decipherment is correct or not correct. In matters of this kind the truth often lies in between, 377</page><page sequence="5">Journal of the American Oriental Society 105.2 (1985) and posterity may demonstrate rather that his general ap- proach is the right one, but that some or many of his infer- ences, interpretations and conclusions require modification. He has approached this difficult problem with praiseworthy impartiality as to the enciphered language and its implications to the historian, and he has given the reader all that he needs to formulate his own tentative judgments with so great an amplitude of charts, tables and lists as almost to afford an impediment to an easy perusal of the book. It is to be hoped that Dr. Rao's work, in which are concentrated immense labor and erudition, will be studied with all the care and minuteness that should be accorded to any scientific study and that his methods and the results he has achieved will be viewed and assessed with the same impartiality he sought to impose upon himself at the outset of his investigation. WALTER HARDING MAURER UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA The Sacred Thread: Hinduism in its Continuity and Diversity. By J. L. BROCKINGTON. Pp. ix + 222, 14 plates. Edinburgh: EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY PRESS. 1981. $10.50. The purpose of this book is to present in a fairly succinct form the history and development of Hinduism from its Vedic origins to modern times and, as partly implied by the subtitle, to show how Hinduism, in spite of the immense diversity of thought that has always characterized it even from its remote beginnings, has nevertheless retained a certain unity and vitality over the many centuries of its existence. Perhaps this notion of the unity and diversity of Hinduism is best epitom- ized in the author's final sentence: "Hinduism is ever the same, yet different." The difficulty inherent in this sort of enterprise is considerable, not only due to the long period of time involved, but much the more so because of the subtleties and complexities that have dominated Hinduism in almost all the numerous phases through which it has passed, the bewildering array of interpretations to which its principal doctrines have been subjected and the varied movements that have arisen within its ample bosom, some to challenge its firmest bases and others to modify them, all, however, ulti- mately to become absorbed and add new facets to an ever growing organism. In the first chapter characteristics popularly associated with Hinduism are discussed and evaluated in an attempt to formulate a definition of Hinduism, but are shown to be largely generalizations, oftentimes only stereotypes. A sketch of the religion reflected in the Veda is then presented, as being the earliest form of Hinduism of which record exists. In the succeeding chapters are taken up, sometimes in con- siderable detail, the many trends that developed out of the milieu of the Vedic religion, in the course of which the texts wherein they are embodied are discussed. Among these are the concepts of the Atman and Brahman taught in the Upanisads, the theistic trends also to be found therein and mirrored in part in the Bhagavadgita, the rise of Vaisnavism and Saivism and heterodoxies such as Jainism, Buddhism and Ajivikism, and the development of sects, such as that of the Linigayats founded by Basava in the 12th century, and finally the various attempts at reform made during the past century and a half or so by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Daya- nanda Sarasvati, Ramakrishna and his disciple Vivekananda, Aurobindo Ghose and many others, including Gandhi, al- though he may not strictly be regarded as a reformer or even as a religious teacher in the sense of the others mentioned. It is remarkable that in so small a compass it has been possible to communicate so much varied and detailed infor- mation, although some will undoubtedly be dissatisfied with the brevity of treatment of certain matters and yet others with occasional prolixity. It is not entirely clear, however, to what class of reader this admirable book is addressed: at times one has the impression, partly from the total absence of footnotes, that it is meant for the general reader who has little or no knowledge of Hinduism or any aspect of India, but at other times, where but a skeleton of a rather abstruse matter is presented, it is apparent that only a person equipped with substantial background in Indian studies could hope to absorb much. On these occasions it may be felt that the book is intended as a summary or recapitulation for one who is fairly familiar with the overall content. Inaccuracies are very rare indeed. One that may be men- tioned in passing is the implication on page 97 that in the Vaisesika system ether (akada) is an atomic element. In fact, however, only earth, water, light and air among the physical elements are atomic, whereas ether though also regarded as a physical element (the substratum of sound), is an all-pervading substance. There is, then, only one ether, but innumerable atoms of the four elements. Incidentally, the unique individualities or particularities (vigesas), by which one atom of the same substance is differentiated from another and all nine eternal substances from one another, ought not to be referred to as "individual characteristics," a term which is more appropriate to objects of everyday experience than to ultimate and imperceptible differentia. But these observations are not meant in any way to detract from a work that is so finely and compactly written as to merit the highest praise both for the great erudition and scholarship that emanate from every page as well as for the concentrated effort obviously required to produce it. Finally, attention should be directed to the very useful bibliography at the end of the volume (pp. 210-216), which, 378</page></plain_text>
