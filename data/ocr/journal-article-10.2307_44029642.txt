Despite the separation of time and differences in cul- ture, the two texts share, at crucial points in the drama and narrative of their female pro- tagonists, the metaphor of the devastated nest. This essay presents an extended analysis of this significant trope, which, in both texts, represents feminist protest against social conformity. Although Sophocles's and Bronte's literary modes differ, patriarchal forces in the tragedy and in the novel domesticate and suppress women's rebellion. The pas- sage about the devastated nest in Antigone offers a critically penetrating intertext to Bronte's novel. The two young women's situations mirror a joint dilemma that arises when individual identity is set against powerful social forces to conform. The shared metaphor of the ravaged nest focuses my discussion of gender and feminist dissent. This essay examines the rhetorical mode of this feminist dissidence, suggesting an intertextual play between the two works. The devastated nest metaphor Mosaic 41/3 0027- 1276-07/1 030 14$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">104 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008) works differently in each text, but I argue that the two texts address each other mean- ingfully across the gulf between the classical period and the mid-nineteenth century, between Greek tragic drama and Victorian romance fiction, and within the context of the pervasive cultural presence of Antigone in the European culture of the 1800s. Ultimately, patriarchal cultures influence the writers of the tragedy and novel to put down the female. This suppression in Wuthering Heights occurs as the devastated nest metaphor is repeated, the second time through the written rather than the spoken word. But it is Bronte's first use of the nest metaphor that asserts its powerfully mem- orable presence in the novel and that provokes the allusion to Sophocles's tragedy. A social desperate clairvoyance Catherine accorded Earnshaw, to those to whom whom Brontë society has judges granted as mad, the personal struggles and to social clairvoyance accorded to those whom society judges as mad, struggles to define her identity in her enigmatic ravings in the "madwoman scene" in Chapter 12, where she invokes the terrible image of a distressed bird and its ravaged nest, an image that links Catherine to the female protagonist of Sophocles's tragedy. The prelude to Catherine's crisis occurs in Chapter 9 of Wuthering Heights , where she faces an ago- nizing decision: she must choose to accept either Heathcliff 's or Edgar Linton's pro- posal of marriage. Edgar offers the lure of conventional gentility and pride of social position, whereas Heathcliff is - with all of the inscrutable force that the verb "to be" confers to Catherine's cry, "I am Heathcliff" - some inseparable part of what she calls "my own being" (82). She tries to explain her passionate difficulties to Nelly Dean. "I can't do it distinctly," she warns, "but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel" (79). How Catherine feels about her decision, which will determine her feminine and social identities, lies at the core of Bronte's novel. The novelist hides Catherine's subversive feelings by using seemingly obscure metaphors that are enclosed within the narratives of two conservative guardians of social convention, Nelly and Mr. Lockwood. No wonder then, that Nelly rejects Catherine's plea for understanding. With her usual antagonism, Nelly records but does not sympathize with Catherine's agonies. With the clear assurance of the tragic chorus, those other voices of conventional values, Nelly perceives "an unusual gloom in her [Catherine's] aspect, that made me dread some- thing from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe" (80). Bronte's use of "prophesy" and "catastrophe" here obliquely invoke the classical her- itage she will mine more explicitly when alluding directly to Antigone. The young women protagonists of Bronte's novel and Sophocles's tragedy make choices that determine their identities as they oppose the rules of their respective soci- eties. Antigone's decision to perform the prohibited funeral rites over her brother's corpse leads to her death sentence. Catherine's decision to marry Edgar is suicidal. She haunts the second half of the novel, despite Bronte's attempts to bury the disturbing</page><page sequence="3">Steve Lukits 105 consequences of her decision in the conventions of Gothic romance. Even the appar- ently comedie resolution of the novel's conflicts, which is projected into the future marriage of her daughter, cannot lay Catherine s ghost. Concerns about gender, identity, and social order converge with questions of narrative structure in Chapter 12 of Wuthering Heights. Brontë drives Catherine s pas- sionate temperament to extremes in this famous "madwoman scene": her utterances mix the lucid and discursive with the enigmatic, oracular, and metaphoric. This mix- ture finds frenzied concentration and interpretive difficulty in the first of her appar- ently delirious speeches in Chapter 12. Perhaps because of its seemingly wild incomprehensibility, this problematic speech remains an interpretive crux in the novel. Feminist critics have focused much attention on the passage, but they read it differently. None of them have noticed its relationship to Antigone. Chapter 12 of Wuthering Heights , like Chapter 9, finds Catherine and Nelly in conflict. Three days after participating in a violent quarrel between Edgar and Heathcliff, Catherine admits Nelly into her bedroom. Feeling betrayed by both her husband and Heathcliff, Catherine resolves to "die since no one cares anything about me" (120). Self-righteous Nelly, always allied to the master of the house, once again offers no comfort to her tor- mented mistress and eggs her on by falsely implying that Edgar is indifferent to her suffering. Nelly observes how Catherine "increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth" (122). This frenzy suddenly passes: A minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations. "That's a turkey's," she murmured to herself; "and this is a wild-duck's; and this is a pigeon's. Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows - no wonder I couldn't die! Let me take care to throw them on the floor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock's; and this - I should know it among a thousand - it's a lapwing's. Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot - we saw its nest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old ones dare not come. I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing, after that, and he didn't. Yes, here are more! Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are any red, any of them? Let me look." (122-23) Brontë embedded this passage into the narrative core of Wuthering Heights. Two outer, intermediary, and enclosing narratives, Lockwood's and Nelly's, surround Catherine's words. And her speech has an even deeper source, welling up from beneath her conscious psyche, heedless of and defying the historical linearity of</page><page sequence="4">106 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008 ) I Nelly s and Lockwood's narratives. In Catherine's "murmur [s] to herself," we overhear a discontinuous and metaphoric parataxis of personally significant images and events. The practical-minded Nelly can only "collect" (123) the scattered feathers but withholds narrative comment on what she calls, in the language of mechanistic psy- chology, Catherine's strayed "associations" (122). In what is among the most critically analyzed passages in Wuthering Heights, many readers have commented on Catherine's "madwomen scene." In Maggie Berg's reading, "Catherine wants, like the lapwing, to soar into space, owned by no one [...]. The image of the skeletons in the lapwings' nest thus combines Catherine's desire for freedom with her recognition that the men have prevented it. Heathcliff and Edgar have trapped her, have sapped her vitality. The nest reverie is therefore central to our understanding of Catherine, as well as being a turning point in the novel" (86). For the Freudian reader, Margaret Homans, Catherine's "stream-of-consciousness" speech "functions for Brontë as a return of her own narrative omissions, a return of her own repressed [. . .] ideal- ization of childhood" ("Repression" 18). The most detailed interpretation belongs to Stevie Daviess Emily Brontë: The Artist as a Free Woman. The chapter she devotes to her Jungian analysis of the passage contrasts Catherine's speech to Nelly's stern rebuke, "Give over with that baby- work" (123). Daviess intricate reading resists summary, but she argues from the premise that "beneath [Catherine's] tantrum is taking place a kind of work' which is mysterious and purposeful. This 'baby- work' involves an urge toward fundamental and radical order which underlies the common civilized' order and deeply criticizes it." Catherine is "involved in a sexual search, but sexual union is not the subject of the story" (96). Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in The Madwoman in the Attic discuss Chapter 12 in detail. But they remark only in passing on how "liberating feathers from the prison [of the pillow] where they have become objects of social util- ity, [Catherine] imagines them reborn as the birds they once were, whole and free" (284). Implicit in this reading is a feminist criticism of Catherine's imprisoned domes- ticity as "Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger" (125). Patricia Parker analyzes Chapter 12 in terms of narrative theory and detects an exam- ple of "conflation of times," a disturbing series of "textual recalls" of Lockwood's encounters with the ghost of Catherine in Chapter 3. Parker points out how "the two chapters [3 and 12] [. . .] contaminate each other preposterously, upsetting the ordered linearity of the narratorial text" ("[Self-] Identity" 109). All of these readings emphasize the conflict between individual identity and social conformity, the central concern in the novel and Sophocles's tragedy. Yet only two commentators, Northrop Frye and Terry Eagleton (100-101), have mentioned, in passing, the relationship between Wuthering Heights and tragedy. Frye comments that the novel seems to have "affinity with tragedy, and the tragic emotions of passion and fury [...] [and] so can the supernatural, or the suggestion of it" (304).</page><page sequence="5">Steve Lukits 107 Gilbert and Gubar ingeniously grapple with what Leo Barsani has called the "ontological slipperiness" (198) of Wuthering Heights by looking outside the novel with an intertextual reading of Paradise Lost, and arguing that Brontë offers a subver- sive re-reading of Milton's Eve (Gilbert and Gubar 284-308). But Sophocles's Antigone presents a more congenial intertext, indicated by the shared devastated nest trope, linked by the theme of feminist dissent against social conformity, and the widespread cultural interest in Antigone in European culture in general, and in Bronte's Victorian world in particular. George Steiner, in Antigones analyzes the subject in detail, although he does not mention Bronte's novel. Steiner points out that "Sophocles' Antigone held pride of place in poetic and philosophic judgement" throughout the nineteenth cen- tury, and that the drama and its heroine were "talismatic to the European spirit" (6-7). George Eliot was certainly alive to this force, and in her 1856 essay, "The Antigone and its Moral," she comments that "wherever the strength of a man's intellect, or moral sense, or affection, brings him into opposition with the rules which society has sanc- tioned, there is renewed the conflict between Antigone and Creon; such a man must not only dare to be right, he must dare to be wrong to shake faith, to wound friend- ship, perhaps, to hem in his own powers" (265). Although she uses masculine pro- nouns, and does not focus on Antigone's feminist dissent, Eliot identifies the conflict of the individual in "opposition with the rules which society has sanctioned," a con- cern that is essential to the drama and the novel. No direct evidence exists that Emily Brontë was influenced by reading Antigone. She and her sisters received no formal instruction in the classical languages or litera- tures. Yet there are sound circumstantial reasons to suppose that she knew Sophocles's tragedy. Her clergyman father certainly read the classics and so had her beloved brother Branwell. In one of his adolescent works, Branwell writes of a character who was "a devoted worshipper of the divine works that the Grecian tragedians have left for all succeeding ages to marvel at, particularly those of Sophocles the Majestic" (30). About Bronte's older sister, Christine Alexander writes: "Charlotte seldom refers to the classics or ancient history in her letters, yet her juvenalia shows that she was famil- iar with such figures as Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Aeschylus, Tasso, and Virgil" ( 1 50). The literary culture of the Brontë family would suggest that Emily knew Antigone. Her intense loyalty to her unfortunate brother and the strong-minded independent women in her Gondal poems indicate other sympathies with Sophocles's protagonist. It is within the critical, cultural, and biographical contexts, discussed and cited above, that I place Catherine's raving in Chapter 12 of the novel. Here, only the pigeons' and lapwing's feathers evoke extended responses. She wants to discard the pigeons' feathers because of the superstition that they have prevented her from dying. The lapwing's feather - "I should know it among a thousand," she exclaims - engages</page><page sequence="6">108 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008) more intensely personal memories about other deaths. Ornithological details are important here, as they are throughout Wuthering Heights , and only Davies has taken them into account. Bronte's knowledge of birds was extensive and gathered firsthand on the moors, from folk tales and books. Thomas Bewick's popular A History of British Birds was a lifelong favorite (Gerin 12-13). The entry about the lapwing, or Pee-wit, reads, in part: It is every where well known by its loud and incessant cries, which it repeats without inter- mission whilst on the wing. [. . .] The Pee-wit is a lively, active bird, almost continually in motion; [. . . ][the female] makes no nest, but deposits [her eggs] upon a little dry grass hastily scraped together: the young birds run very soon after they are hatched: during this period the old ones are very assiduous in their attention to their charge; on the approach of any person to the place of their deposit, they flutter round his head with cries of great- est inquietude, which increase as he draws nearer the spot where the brood are squatted; in case of extremity, and as a last resource, they run along the ground as if lame, in order to draw off the attention of the fowler from any further pursuit. (Bewick 80-81) Catherine's memory is first drawn to the "wheeling" flight of the bird. But its flight does not only exalt the freedom that Gilbert and Gubar suggest. As Bewick explains, the lapwing that Catherine remembers fears for its vulnerable nestlings, threatened by human intruders and the coming rain. The bird's winged freedom leaves it powerless against natural and human dangers. Similarly, Catherine's child- hood and adolescent freedom as a girl is constrained by the social pressure to conform to the gender expectations of her patriarchal society. Catherine perceives, and oddly confuses, two even more ominous threats to the lapwing. Hunters can kill it on the wing, in mockery of its supposed safety in the air. The particular lapwing that Catherine remembers, however, was not shot, she insists. The bird and its mate - "the old ones," as she calls them, using the same phrase found in Bewick - had to abandon their young because Heathcliff had set a trap over their nest. Catherine and Heathcliff find the nest in the winter, "full of little skeletons." Catherine makes Heathcliff promise "never [to] shoot a lapwing, [. . .] and he didn't." But why should she be worried about shooting the bird when it is the terrible image of the starved "little skeletons" that rivets attention in the passage? This confusion between hunting the adult lapwing and trapping its young is unexplained. Only the destruction of the bird family is certain. When Catherine finds more lapwing feathers in the pillow, she senses new dangers to herself. She is disturbed and uncertain about Heathcliff's promise not to kill any more lapwings. Questioning her trust in Heathcliff implies distrust of herself, especially</page><page sequence="7">Steve Lukits 109 in the light of what Patricia Parker calls the most radical copular or anagogie metaphor in the novel, Catherine's cry, "I am Heathcliff!" ("Anagogie" 53). Remembering the sight of the "little skeletons" suddenly threatens this identity. Division is also signalled by the change from first-person plural pronouns in Catherine's speech to first- and third-per- son singulars. She and Heathcliff saw the lapwing and its nest together as children, but Catherine pointedly recalls how Heathcliff has set the trap and perhaps shot what she possessively calls "my lapwings." Heathcliff 's exertion of male power destroys his shared identity with Catherine during their childhood. Catherine's possessive assertion of what she calls "my lapwings" also belies Heathcliff 's earlier boast: "When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted?" (46). But this boast was made when Catherine is first trapped at Thrushcross Grange. That conventionally domestic and patriarchal household, where matters of property are paramount, "wrenched" Catherine away from her childhood world at Wuthering Heights. After her first stay at the Grange, she eventually returns to become Mrs. Linton, a lady, wife, mother-to-be. She also comes to recognize in Chapter 12 that she has become an "exile" and "outcast" from her "former world," where Heathcliff had been her "all in all" (125). Her urgent and impossible wish to be "a girl again, half sav- age and hardy, and free [. . .] and laughing at injuries, not maddening under them" (126) confirms the fatal changes in her life. The germs of these recognitions of social pressures affecting female gender roles, which Catherine more precisely identifies later in Chapter 12, are metaphorically implanted in the images of the lapwing and its nest. Concerns about childhood and motherhood, home and estrangement, authority and submission, freedom and imprisonment, safety and danger, confidence and dis- trust, and above all, identity and gender, are interwoven in Catherine's metaphorical groping with the lapwing's feather. Thematic resonances, warning tremors and after- shocks, radiate backward and forward in Wuthering Heights from Catherine's first speech in Chapter 12. Yet it remains enigmatically resistant to precise interpretation. There is a long tradition of post-structuralist criticism, offered most notably by J. Hillis Miller, Barsani, Homans, and Parker, that accounts for the textual resistances that might otherwise seem strange in a novel whose narrative has yielded exact chronological tables of events, historically dated genealogies of its characters, and all manner of intricate structural dualities, schematic pairings, correspondences, and recurrences (Miller 42-47). All of these analyses testify to Bronte's rigorous care in constructing her book. But there are also nodes of interpretive uncertainty, paradox- ical, puzzlingly strange passages, as is the one about the devastated nest. The striking images of the lapwing and its nest in Catherine's speech suggest an illuminating intertext in a passage from Sophocles's Antigone, a work that also shares the essential, far-reaching concerns with gender and feminist rebellion in Wuthering Heights.</page><page sequence="8">110 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008 ) In Sophocles s drama, a sentry brings Antigone captive before King Creon. She had been arrested for performing prohibited burial rites to the body of her brother, the rebel Polyneices. The sentry and his comrades had been sent to guard the corpse and ensure that Creon s edict against its proper burial is obeyed. The sentry tells the king how a supernatural whirlwind of dust suddenly hid the body from their view. After the storm subsided, Antigone was seen beside her brother's body. As Steiner ana- lyzes in detail, the sentry's report of what he saw and heard is fraught with textual controversies (221-31). Here are two translations of lines 424-25; the first in prose, from the early twentieth century, and the second is in verse: The maid was seen; and she cried a loud and sharp cry of a bird in its bitterness, - even as when, within the empty nest, it sees the bed stripped of its nestlings. ( Antigone, trans. Jebb) [. . .] we saw the girl! And she cried out a sharp piercing cry, like a bird come back to an empty nest, peering into its bed, and all the babies gone. C Antigone , trans. Fagles) A young woman, a distressed bird, and a devastated nest are the most evident points of contact between Brontë and Sophocles's texts. A doubly desolate confronta- tion with death is common to both: each young woman is isolated in her grief (and each will eventually die); birds are distressed about their nestlings; wind or storm sig- nals trouble in the human and the animal worlds. In both texts, powerful men threaten Catherine and Antigone. Nelly and the sentry, the guardians of practical common sense and traditional authority, report on the women to their masters. These correlations bear closer examination. Like Catherine, who is eighteen years old in Chapter 12, Antigone is a young woman, a "girl" or a "maid," as she is called in the translations. Both women have isolated themselves from the dominance and pro- tection of men: Catherine from her husband, Antigone from King Creon. The women also share a special, defiantly held bond with a brother or semi-brother who is con- demned as a social outcast. Polyneices has attacked the city of Thebes and is refused its rites of burial. Heathcliff, the foundling, is an intruder to Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, yet Catherine cleaves to him despite his social inferiority, her marriage, and the hostile prejudice of her husband. The distressed bird in Antigone wails in embittered despair for its missing young and for its own desolation. Antigone's chance for motherhood will also be snatched away by Creon. She will die an unmarried virgin; her tomb will be her wedding bed.</page><page sequence="9">Sieve Lukiîs ill Catherine, like her lapwing, will lose her child because she will die two hours after her daughter is born. Where the sentry renders Antigones lament for her brother as an anthropomorphic, inarticulate cry of a bird, Nelly records the complex incoherence of what she takes to be Catherine s confused "associations." The sense of supernatural agency in the tragedy corresponds to the unconscious welling up of image and mem- ory in the novel. The other focus of attention in both passages is the ravaged nest. In Wuthering Heights only "the little skeletons" remain. In Antigoney the nest is empty, the baby birds are gone. But the celebrated choral ode in praise of man's mastery of nature, which precedes the sentry's entrance with Antigone, sings of the "blithe and free nations of birds" that man "hunts down and ensnares" (2.333-73). (Heathcliff is not the first man to set traps for birds.) The nest itself is only implied in the Greek text; Sophocles uses a word meaning "bed" or "couch." The "emptied nest," writes Steiner, is linked to the "'orphaned bed' [. . .] in human terms A,ex°§ *s a bed. It is an overwhelming infer- ence of barrenness, of solitude [. . .] for [Antigone] the nuptial and maternal 'nest/bed' shall be empty and generation laid waste" (226). Catherine invokes a similar terror in Wuthering Heights with "the little skeletons." Trapped, orphaned, and dead, they point to two generations of Earnshaw and Linton children in the novel, and as Homans suggests, "what [Heathcliff] does to the lap- wings is to separate parents from young and to ensure that the little ones die of their being orphaned. The action is a symbolic repetition of what he had himself experi- enced as a child" ( Bearing 79). The older generation all die, beginning with Catherine and ending with Heathcliff. Cuckoo -like, for Nelly tells Lockwood at the beginning of her narrative that Heathcliff 's is a "cuckoo's" history (33), he forcefully takes posses- sion of both houses - both family's nests, as it were - but he remains solitary and dies without surviving children. His final obsession is to be nestled beside Catherine in the grave, which recalls Haemon's suicide and burial with Antigone in her tomb. Davies has pointed out that Catherine, who is pregnant in Chapter 12, "is herself a nest" (101). But will her daughter, born into the house that had trapped her mother into conventional domesticity, escape a similar fate? Will her father, Edgar, and her other guardian, Nelly, who confine her to Thrushcross Grange during her childhood, ensnare her in the same domestic trap that killed her mother? The daughter's prospects, given her undiminished sense of independence with her future husband, Hareton, appear bright. But the young couple proposes to leave the Heights, the place of the older Catherine's liberty, and move to Thrushcross Grange after their wedding. Nelly and Lockwood's optimism for them places too much emphasis on what Frank Kermode has called the "civilized order" that pervades the novel (124). This "civilized</page><page sequence="10">112 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008) order," patriarchal and materialistic, destroys Catherine and Heathcliff. Lockwood's farewell visit to their graves follows his report of Nelly s bright forecast for the young couple. But Patricia Parker questions whether the visit to the churchyard, where peaceful nature is contrasted to the "unquiet slumbers" (Brontë 338) of the dead, might serve as "a defensive closure device [. . .] a desire to maintain the proper bound- ary lines" in a novel where she detects "a sense of something threatening to break down such partitions" (Parker, "Anagogie" 56). Antigone comes to bury her brother because she refuses to obey the tyrannical social "partitions" to her conduct imposed by Creon. She sets her individual will and her love for her brother against the dictates of the polis and its king. Her name, a com- pound of Greek words meaning "born to oppose or struggle," also signifies her fated, lonely rebellion and inevitable death. Similar forces move Catherine in Wuthering Heights. "Heathcliff and I are going to rebel" (18), Lockwood reads in her childhood marginalia. "'You forget you have a mas- ter here,' says the tyrant" (19), the entry continues as she writes about her brother, Hindley. Catherine, like Antigone, is in conflict with established social conventions and patriarchal authority. Catherines struggle merges with questions about her identity as a woman after her five-week stay at Thrushcross Grange, where she is domesticated, or as Nelly explains, "her manner much improved," and transformed from "a wild, hatless little savage," into "a very dignified person" wearing a "feathered beaver [hat]." Nelly confirms Catherine as "reformed" by "fine clothes and flattery" (51), the conventional bribes offered to adolescent women. Robbed of her natural feminine individuality and independence, she fatally decides to marry Edgar. Her efforts to define her identity as a woman lead to her death: she cannot live as a mother in her husband's house. But neither can she return to her childhood, to nest at Wuthering Heights, to be, as she wishes later in Chapter 12, "enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home." The unnamed "great grief," the "paroxysm of despair" (125) that she feels may arise from the memory of the "little skeletons" in the nest. Perhaps she senses that her coming death, which she wants to speed on by throwing out the pigeon feathers, was fated by her gender even in childhood. The "half savage" (126) hardiness and freedom she lived as a girl is utterly lost and changed when she becomes the adult "lady" ( 125), as the married Mrs. Linton. Note also that whereas Nelly has used the identical word "savage" pejoratively, for Catherine the word signifies the lost independence she had in girlhood. That Heathcliff placed the trap over the nest compounds her feelings of loss. The identical defiant freedom that she enjoyed with him when they were children makes her domestic confinement at Thrushcross Grange, and her own tormented sense of identity, unbearable. Heathcliff recalls to her the freedom and individuality she has</page><page sequence="11">Steve Lukits 113 lost as a woman, but which society grants to Heathcliff the man. These changes are also anticipated in her vision of the nest because it is Heathcliff, the aggressive and destructive boy, who sets the trap. He and Catherine notice the distressed lapwing, both see its nest in the winter, but only Catherine recoils in terror and makes Heathcliff promise "never to shoot a lapwing, after that." (The confusion between trapping and shooting lapwings may look forward to the other men who hunt in the novel, Hareton and Lockwood. The latter s chance return to Wuthering Heights ensues when he goes shooting "to devastate the moors of a friend" [305] and he visits Wuthering Heights for the last time.) When Catherine begins to doubt Heathcliff 's promise, she fearfully suspects that the childhood "separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff" ( 125) is completely unbridgeable in her adult life. "That is not my Heathcliff," she will disappointedly declare on the day before she dies; "I shall love mine yet - and take him with me - he s in my soul" (160). Her child- hood identity with Heathcliff, expressed in their joint insubordinate independence, is separated from the adult man and becomes a nostalgically spiritualized state of her soul. And in her last major speech in the novel, Catherine invokes metaphors that recall the trapped nestlings at the onset of her mortal crisis in Chapter 12: "the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all. I am tired, tired of being enclosed here. Tm wearying to escape into that glorious world" (160). The words "prison," "enclosed," and "escape" provoke Heathcliff, Catherine s alter-ego, to state the terrible truth about the self-betrayal that eventually kills her: "Why did you despise me?" he implores. "Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of com- fort - you deserve this. You have killed yourself" (161). Like Antigone, Catherine, as Nelly predicts with the conviction of a tragic chorus, "was fated, sure to die" (158). Like Antigone, who commits suicide and dies in her tomb with her betrothed lover, Haemon, Catherine will only be united with Heathcliff in her grave. Antigone suffers her tragic fate. As Sarah B. Pomeroy explains in her study of women in classical antiquity, "in the end, Antigone reverts to a traditional female role. She laments that she dies a virgin, unwed and childless, and commits suicide [. . .] [for the Greeks] a feminine and somewhat cowardly mode of death" (101). Catherine, however, continues to struggle. She fights to know and to realize her passion in speech, and to understand her fated self. The recurrence of the plundered nest metaphor in the second half of Wuthering Heights indicates important changes between mother and daughter, and more importantly, offers insights about the nar- rative structure of the novel. (I will call the daughter Cathy to distinguish from her mother Catherine. The confusion of identical names in Wuthering Heights is part of the novel's complex of problematic dualities and compels the questioning of all rela- tionships within the book.)</page><page sequence="12">114 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008 ) In the second half of the novel, Nelly hunts out a hidden trove of love letters that Cathy has secretly received from Heathcliff's son, Linton. Laying a trap for Cathy, Nelly removes the letters and waits to catch the girl's guilty reaction: "Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brim-full of chirping young ones, express more complete despair in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance" (226). Here, the metaphor of the plundered nest is appropriated and domesticated by the novel's principal narrator as a mere rhetorical trope and disarmed of its former lyric and dramatic power. We first hear of the devastated nest through Nelly's quotation of Catherine's frenzied speech, which corresponds to the performative aspect of Sophocles's drama, whereas Nelly's use of the trope is presented by Brontë as a writ- ten text. Where the bird invoked by Catherine in Chapter 12 cried for the loss of fam- ily and Catherine's sense of identity, here the cry is raised for some missing letters. Catherine's speech, although reported by the same narrator, is uttered outside what Eagleton terms the "dominative narrative control of Nelly herself" (Kavanagh xii). The passions of mother and daughter also are expressed in different forms. Catherine's impassioned speech and desperate actions contrast with Cathy's letter-writing and use of written words to communicate with Linton. Nelly describes Linton's letters to Cathy as "singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy way a schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart" (225). None of Cathy's letters is quoted, but her distancing of love into the decorum of written words suggests the general displacement and literate domestication of ardour in the second half of the novel. This change contrasts Catherine's disgust for Edgar's bookishness in Chapter 12: "What in the name of all that feels, has he to do with books , when I am dying?" (122). The "odd compound of ardour and flatness" in Linton's letters is repeated in the bipartite structure of the novel. The extended episodes that comprise the first half of Wuthering Heights give way in the second half to an accelerated narrative pace and increased movements between the two houses. The final promise of the happy marriage of Cathy and Hareton re-establishes the Earnshaw property rights to Wuthering Heights, but also foretells the couple's move to the conventional comforts of Thrushcross Grange. When Lockwood happens on the reconciled couple near the end of the novel (he had seen them quarrelling at the beginning of the book), Cathy is teaching Hareton how to read and correcting his pronunciation of the word "con-irary" (307). Catherine's active rebelliousness (here suggested by a word that recalls the compounds in Antigone's name) succumbs to a pedantic exercise in pronunciation. Nelly's optimism</page><page sequence="13">Steve Lukits 115 for them ("They are afraid of nothing," [337] she boasts in the last chapter), and Lockwood's final musings in the peaceful churchyard, have also worn down and flat- tened the high peaks of intensity in Catherine's half of the novel. "To narrate is to exercise power," observes Eagleton (xii). Whether or not one agrees with him that this power is Nelly s "sober bourgeois realism," the novel is rife with her many avowed prejudices against Catherine, especially her stern antipathy towards her desperate crises in Chapters 9 and 12, and her preference for her "mas- ter," Edgar Linton. (Ismene, in Antigone , shows similar disregard for her sister and advises her to acquiesce to Creon s authority.) Lockwoods final effort to "lock up," as it were, the entire narrative at the conclusion of the novel forces a comedie and romantic resolution, complete with the forthcoming marriage. But the "unquiet slumbers" (338) of the dead Catherine and Heathcliff, which Lockwood also wants to dismiss, and Catherines madwoman clairvoyance in Chapter 12, cast the narrator's concluding optimism into doubt. The "unquiet" at the end of Wuthering Heights , like Parker's "sense of something threatening to break down all partitions" in the novel, can be traced back to Catherine's metaphorically paratactic murmurings about the lapwing and its nest. Brontë has tensioned her novel between the desire, like Catherine's, to give a difficult, passionately complexed "feeling of how I feel," and the necessity to finally confine and domesticate these feelings about female identity within the context of a traditional romance narrative. Catherine and Cathy, the dissident mother and daughter in the novel, have been either killed or domestically compromised, and their rebellion is suppressed, as is Antigone's. The lapwing's circling cries are meant to distract intruders, yet the frantic bird also alerts them that they must be close to what is most precious, the hidden nest that contains its young. Even Nelly, the self-proclaimed "steady, reasonable kind of body" (61), recognizes the double meaning of the alarm sounded by the image of the bird and the nest. She remembers Catherine's words in Chapter 12, even as she disdains to under- stand them. The metaphorical energy of Catherine's speech, its cry of feminist dissent against constraining social order, and the terror and pity of her crisis of female identity, can be understood within its intertextual relationship to Sophocles's Antigone. The shared image of the devastated nest alerts us that the terrible dilemmas of identity and social conformity in Wuthering Heights transcend the novel's time period. The cry of a bird for its devastated nest, in the novel and in the tragedy, signals that the two young women, although separated by more than two millennia, share a common doom.</page><page sequence="14">116 Mosaic 41/3 (September 2008) WORKS CITED Alexander, Christine.
