<plain_text><page sequence="1">Britannia and John Bull: From Birth to Maturity Roy T. Matthews National symbols evoke powerful emotions. Deeply rooted in a nation's history, such symbols as the Eiffel Tower for France, Uncle Sam for the United States, and for Britain the graceful Britannia, whose origins date back to the Roman empire, and the sturdy John Bull, a creation of early modern popular culture—who are the subjects of this essay—can reveal a great deal about a society's heritage, its ideologies, its myths, and the values commonly held by its people.1 Mythic tradi tions from folk tales link national memories with artistic styles and literary con ventions. Symbols point the way to an emerging national identity. National symbols follow certain patterns; some are animals, others structures or coats or arms, but most evolve as personifications based on human stereotypes. Popular reactions to national symbols can be better understood when images are placed in the broader historical context. The origin and development of each national symbol in the Western political culture follows its own idiosyncratic path, but the image itself comes primarily from three sources: classical Greece or Rome, Christian iconography, or vernacular popular culture. Humans, animals (natural or mythical), birds, and emblems are the four most common forms. While some soci eties have turned religious symbols into secular images, most Western European nations have created their national images from classical sources or vernacular pop ular antecedents. Ruling classes initially looked to the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece or Rome to evoke prestige and power, and to suggest moral values. Others found their national symbols in the vernacular tradition, turning to folk tales, occa sionally borrowing a literary character, or more rarely, transforming actual persons into national stereotypes.

Their gods and goddesses were the protectors of citizens and community, whose images were placed in temples and shrines to pay homage to the immortals. Often devices such as an easily recognized landmark or local agricultural product were incorporated; people in regional dress or performing some local celebration came also to be depicted. Thus, a principal god like Apollo or a goddess such as Athena became appropriated as a local symbol. Athens, for example, symbolized the city on coins with Athena on one side and her familiar, the owl, on the other. As the Romans conquered their neighbors and rival tribes, minor deities merged with local images to symbolize a recently proclaimed province or newly conquered land. Roman coins usually carried portraits of the reigning emperor on the obverse, but regional symbols became common on the reverse of such coins, especially if minted in the provinces. Personifications of places became more common as the natural and specific images replaced the ideal forms.2 Coins were often minted to commemorate a notable event or conquest. For example, a coin commemorating the first century Roman Emperor Claudius's inva sion and occupation of southern Britain, shows the emperor on horseback above a triumphant arch on which is carved "De Britain." When the Roman Emperor Hadrian journeyed through the imperial provinces, a series of coins were struck per sonifying the occupied territories as a woman holding an object or surrounded by artifacts representative of the local region. Like Claudius, Hadrian recorded his vic tories in Britain on coins. On one coin featuring Hadrian's portrait on the obverse, Britannia is seen on the reverse as the female personification of this recently con quered island. Britannia is depicted in profile, sitting with head slightly bowed beside a small pile of rocks, possibly representing the wall the Romans built across the northern part of Britain. She is wearing classical robes and her pose is submissive, her spear cradled in her left arm, her shield at rest, armor cast off.3 More than 1,500 years later, a woman in this pose became the accepted symbol of England, and later, Great Britain. Miniers in the last years of the Roman Empire presented the island in a variety of ways: sometimes with Britannia next to a fortress, probably the Roman walled city of London, and sometimes as a loyal and obedient subject welcoming the emperor. Her image appeared on memorials and public buildings around the 2Percy Gardiner, "Countries and Cities in Ancient Art," Journal of Hellenic Studies 9 ( 1888) : 47-48,80 81; Jocelyn M. C.

But her image may have sur vived in some religious form among the Britons, later folded into Christianity and eventually emerging in the Middle Ages, along with the worship of the Virgin Mary. The few statues widely scattered around England, dating from medieval times, have generated a number of theories about Britannia's fate during these centuries.6 Britannia's uncertain passage from ancient to early modern times led to her emer gence as the first personified national symbol, although the path was never straight.

Poets and historians portrayed Glorianna, a female leader who emerged as a symbol of early English national consciousness. The Elizabethan poet Edmund Spenser, in his alle gorical epic poem The Faerie Queene, best summarized the themes of patriotism, honor, and idealism in praise of his queen. Glorianna expressed love for her subjects while shrewdly guiding them through many crises and raising her young country to new levels of power and prestige. Spenser's encomium for Queen Elizabeth elevated the ruler to a level above other mortals and pointed the way for future panegyrists who would conflate later English queens with Britannia, especially during the reign of Queen Victoria in the nineteenth century.7 Britannia also appears on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century emblem books and maps. Emblem books first appeared at the time of Europe's intellectual and cul tural reawakening, the Renaissance. By the opening of the seventeenth century, they had begun to lose their earlier mystical connotations and were read simply as homiletics or guides to moral behavior. The early seventeenth-century English writer Henry Peacham featured a Britannia in his 1603 Minerva Britannia, one of the first emblem books written in English.8 In this print, Britannia is shown in drapery and an armored breastplate, bare foot, confidently striding toward a ship, with a walled city, possibly London, in the background. As the text clearly states, the drawing is based on the old antique Roman model, when "Romanes overran her land." Now Britannia, usurping Rome, is sovereign, carrying a scepter instead of a spear. The ship symbolizes Britain's new maritime power, acquired under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The "Minerva" of the title is a reference to Athena, the goddess of Athens. By the end of the seventeenth century, such books educated children and amused adults. Here were to be found artists' sketches of Britannia along with other female figures personifying idealized values and morals, such as honor, fortitude, bravery, or justice. Maps, the pragmatic products of the Age of Discovery, were valued not only for their accuracy and detail but also for their visual appeal and aesthetic pleasure. Continental mapmakers decorated their works with swags of fruit, classical patterns and designs, the personifications of the four seasons, the seven planets, and, by 7Charles Moseley, Λ Century of Emblems: An Introductory Anthology (London, 1988), 1-33; Mario Paz, Studies in Seventeenth Century Imagery (Rome, 1975), 169-72; Jean Seznec, The Survival of the Pagan Gods (New York, 1953), 102-3; Rosemary Freeman, English Emblem Books (London, 1948), 1-36. 8Henry Peachem, Minerva Britannia (1612; reprint, Leeds, England, 1966), 108.</page><page sequence="5">Britannia and John Bull: From Birth to Maturity —v · j * • Mbritanniam.

She is shown again seated and in profile, wearing light classical draperies, much as in the Roman coin shown earlier, but her head is raised. Her spear and shield are at rest, like the Roman representation, while she holds a scepter in her right hand. In the background is the sea with small ships, in reference to Britain's maritime prosperity. Her familiar pose, reminiscent of the Roman coins, may be explained by Camden's inclusion in the text of Roman coins featuring Britannia.12 Two years later, in 1612, another English chronicler Michael Drayton put Britannia on the frontispiece of his Poly-Olbion (Albion).13 Here a very different Britannia is seated triumphally, facing the audience, under a Roman arch decorated with male figures who represent the history of Britain. The first figure on the left is Aeneas, who according to the Roman author Virgil was the founder of Rome, por trayed here as the predecessor to Britain's emerging empires. To his right is a Roman general, identified in the text as Julius Caesar, the first Roman conqueror of Britain. Below are paired a medieval king in armor with sword in hand and a shield bearing a device of "Norman leopards," intended to represent the Tudor line that was at the time still on the English throne. The final figure is a contemporary seventeenth-cen tury explorer with helmet and lance. Britannia, seated under the arch in a frontal pose facing the viewer, is bedecked and bejeweled, holding in her right hand a scepter 9Jeremy Black, Maps and History: Constructing Images of the Past (New Haven, 1997), 2-26; David Buissert, ed., Monarchs Ministers and Maps: The Emergence of Cartography as a Tool of Government in Early Modern Europe (Chicago, 1992), 26-98.

Britannia in this representation is not depicted as the guardian of the realm, but as a seated goddess of plenty, dressed in a robe reminiscent of classical design, but which is decorated as a pictorial map. Two cherubs are placing a wreath on her head. In the background ships sail the high seas. Here indeed is an image of Britain sovereign powers, flourishing economy, and world-wide ventures at sea. This triumphal yet bountiful pose, so different from Britannia's Roman stance as a conquered province, must have been influenced by the popular iconography cir culating in England in the early seventeenth century. For example, Henry Peacham published a female personification of "Public Happiness" striking a similar poise and holding a cornucopia, in Minerva Britanni. Italian Renaissance author and artist Cesare Ripa showed a female figure as "Abundance" in his Iconologie, where she is portrayed with a sheath of grains and horn of plenty surrounded by appro priate symbols of wealth and productivity.14 Ripa's version is similar to Peacham's "Public Happiness," although he could not have been familiar with the Britannia representation, showing that such a prototype of the figure was currently circulat ing at the time. In the seventeenth century Britannia showed up in some unexpected places and in several media. She could be shown as an object of ridicule by Britain's enemies, a pattern followed in the next two centuries as Great Britain's power and prestige rose and her enemies attacked her on the battlefields, the high seas, and through political prints in the press. In 1655, for example, a year after the end of the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch, who traditionally produced medals to honor their heroes, commemorate their victories, and revile their enemies, issued a medal sati rizing Britannia.15 Here Britannia is shown seated with a kneeling Oliver Cromwell, the Puritan leader who had come to power as a result of the English Civil War and in 1655 was the Lord Protector or ruler in the Commonwealth. But England had formed an alliance with France that the Dutch perceived as a threat, and they expressed their displeasure by showing Britannia, seated in her standard pose, in profile, cradling Cromwell in her lap. His posterior is exposed to the French and Spanish ambassadors while they politely defer to each other as to whom will have the honor of approaching Cromwell's buttocks—no doubt with ribald intent. 14Peacham, Minerva Britanna, 25; Cesare Ripa, Baroque and Rococo Pictorial Imagery (New York, 1971); Richard Helgerson, Forms of Nationhood: The Elizabethan Writing of England (Chicago, 1992), 117-22. 15Gerard van Loon, Métallique des XVII Provinces de Pays Bas (Hague, 1732), ill. 5</page><page sequence="9">Britannia and John Bull: From Birth to Maturity 807 LXX Charles II and Britannia on a commemorative medal. In contrast to this Dutch insult, Britannia's supporters treated her quite differ ently. The English king Charles II, who came to the throne in 1660 after the turbu lent years of the Civil War and Commonwealth, had a medal stuck with his image on the obverse and the elegant head of Britannia on the reverse, in conscious imi tation of the Roman practice. But this Britannia was no subservient provincial. The model for Charles II's Britannia was rumored to be Frances Teresa Stewart, the Duchess of Richmond and Lennox, one of the king's many favorites.16 Later, he placed her on the reverse of the halfpenny coin—where she has continued ever since. Thus, through the effort of royal patrons, Britannia, became part of the collec tive consciousness of the island kingdom. Soon she would be linked to a series of cultural movements and various historical incidents. Technological changes in printing would assure not only her survival but a spot in the hearts and minds of the English people. However, in the immediate future, during the later years of the Stuart dynasty under James II (1685-88), William and Mary (1688-1701), and Queen Anne (1702-114), Britannia was seldom seen. Britannia's plight must be understood in the larger context of state building in early modern Europe when the monarch represented the state. From the beginning of the nation state in the late fifteenth century, rulers in England, Spain, and France l6Charles Oman, The Coinage of England (London, 1967), 335; Julian Barnes, "Real Britannia," The New Yorker, 12 April 1993, 36-52.</page><page sequence="10">808 The Historian came to personify their countries—a trend strongly evident in sixteenth century England under Queen Elizabeth I and in the Spain of her contemporary Philip II. But the first two Stuart kings, James I and Charles I, largely failed to engage the sup port of the English nation. Although Oliver Cromwell captured England's reluctant allegiance through his personality and his promise of a republic, both faded fast in the late 1650s, opening the way for the Restoration of 1660. By the seventeenth century, Spain had lost its grip on Europe and was being chal lenged in the New World, while France moved to center stage in European wars and diplomacy under the dynasty of the Bourbon kings. As they promoted their own roles, personal influence, and public persona, kings and queens came to embody the early modern nation state; thus the French monarchs created a personality cult to fulfill certain political, social, and economic goals. While the personal cult of the ruler in the seventeenth century was a logical and effective step in the evolution of the modern state, when a venerated ruler died, the image either expired or had to be made over again for a successor.17 France set the standard for all the continental dynastic kingdoms that placed their rulers above their subjects in the seventeenth century. Henry IV, who ruled France in the early part of the century, hinted at what could be accomplished; and Louis XIV, the famous "Sun King," took the kingship to unprecedented heights that were often imitated by lesser monarchs in the next century.18 Louis XIV and his ministers implanted his image into the nation state's collective consciousness through a variety of media and public acts and performances. The illiterate masses easily identified the monarch while loyal courtiers envisioned Louis XIV in a classi cal context that they readily understood from their education, which stressed respect for ancient learning and art.19 Until the mid-eighteenth century, Western European rulers and their courtiers continued to look back to the Greeks and Romans and often used ancient leaders as models for monarchs, a tactic that proved effective in winning public support.

Spurred on by economic, polit ical, and social changes that would eventually sweep the aristocrats from power, this movement to introduce other forms of national images came from the lower classes. As social conflict intensified, the educated were unable to impose the classi cal models on the populace, who turned increasingly to vernacular images, local folk heroes and heroines, and regional traditions to create their national symbols. While Britannia was still depicted on coins and medals in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, she was obliged to share the national stage with a succession of English kings and queens. Meanwhile, John Bull, her future consort, was born. Although as symbols Britannia and John Bull sometimes played similar roles and served parallel purposes, their origins were distinctly different. Britannia's classical heritage would forever separate her from John Bull, and throughout her transformations, whether as a conflation with Queen Elizabeth or later appearing on royal coins, Britannia was tied to the ruling classes and destined to be always associated with lofty ideals. She was above the ordinary and daily routines of mere mortals. By contrast, John Bull, the first vernacular image, came from the people and personified many traits that Englishmen thought lay deep in their collective character. Moreover, he transcended his own era, for Bull proved to embody those sterling qualities, such as honesty, a zest for life, and a generous heart, that the com mon people wanted in their native-born national symbols. John Bull, who sprang forth in full form and personality in 1712 from the pen of the popular writer and pamphleteer John Arbuthnot, can best be understood in the context of England's recent intellectual and political changes. By the opening of the eighteenth century, Britain's intellectual outlook was being shaped by Francis Bacon's empiricism, John Locke's epistemology, and Isaac Newton's scientific obser vations.20 Thus, Bull would be free of any medieval constructs and untouched by any forms of mysticism. Moreover, he was the creature of the first great age of English satire and parody that owed much to the influential literary world of author Jonathan Swift, poet and essayist Alexander Pope, playwright John Gay, and the two political and social journalists Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. Like many of Arbuthnot's fellow writers and close friends, John Bull learned to live by his wits, charm, and instincts. His likeness and personality were attuned to the bustling and pragmatic English merchant. He would find supporters on Grub Street among the editors and contributors to the pamphlets, periodicals, and newspapers and kindred 20Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World: A History of Modern Sensibility (New York, 1983), 67 68, 80; Atherton, Political Prints in the Age of Hogarth, 29-30; Freeman, English Emblem Books, 227-28.</page><page sequence="12">810 The Historian souls in the theaters with the playwrights of the saucy comedies and bawdy reviews. Furthermore, Bull and his menagerie of animal friends and foes owe their existence, in part, to the revived popularity of Aesop's fables, a collection of folk tales featur ing animals attributed to the legendary Greek writer. Two popular authors, the Dutch Bernard de Mandeville and the French Jean de LaFontaine, used Aesop's sto ries and characters in their works to represent certain prominent persons whom they were thus able to criticize more or less indirecdy. Their witty attacks allowed them to escape the government and church censors. The educated class grasped the double meanings of these retold fables while the illiterate enjoyed them as folktales and homilies. Arbuthnot was a scientist whose oudook on the natural world was shaped by Baconian principles. His John Bull emerges simply as a representation of the bluff, down-to-earth Protestant Englishman—nothing more than what he is. Indeed, one can argue that for Arbuthnot to envision John Bull and the rest of the national char acters in his satire in any other way would be a refutation of Arbuthnot's scientific training and perception of nature. John Bull's birth can, likewise, be attributed to forces at work within the religious, political, and international milieu, where a growing sense of English national identity was manifested in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. England was overwhelmingly Protestant. In the first half of the eighteenth century, Britain became a military leader in continental wars while her expanding naval power was creating a commercial empire. Linda Colley has argued that this concatenation led to the creation of the idea of Great Britain, with its dawning sense of national purpose and unity. John Bull appeared at the time of a rising national consciousness, leading on to the next phase—modern nationalism.21 At the time John Bull's birth in 1712, three major crises confronted the English. First, Britain was engaged in a prolonged war in Europe; second, the future of the monarchy was uncertain; and third, the era was conflicted with religious bigotry and disputes. The English had been engaged in a war with France and her allies over claims to certain European territories for 10 years. They were fighting to keep the continental balance of power from tipping in France's favor, to guarantee the Dutch Republic's independence, to prevent any French supported Catholic pretender from returning to England, and to protect and expand their overseas empire. As taxes mounted, war profits found their way into the pockets of London business interests: arms manufacturers, military suppliers, and bankers. The landed aristocracy and 21Linda Colley, Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707-1837 (New Haven, 1992), 1-9; Liah Greenfeld, Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (Cambridge, 1992), 29-87; Gerald Newman, The Rise of English Nationalism: A Cultural History, 1740-1830 (New York, 1997).</page><page sequence="13">Britannia and John Bull: From Birth to Maturity 811 country gentry, who had formed a conservative political faction known as the Tories, grew increasingly suspicious that their political rivals, the pro-business London centered Whigs, were purposely prolonging the conflict. The Tories strengthened their political position by winning the 1710 parliamentary election, and a year later, in 1711, Queen Anne packed the House of Lords with 12 new Tory peers to facilitate talks with the French. Complicating England's military campaigns on the continent and her negotia tions to end the wars was the Queen's precarious state of health. The queen had no heir, and the succession was unclear. Soon two factions emerged to compete for the crown. Supporters of the 1688 settlement looked to the King of Hanover, a small Protestant Germanic state, as the Queen's successor. The Tories, however, turned to the former Stuart line of Catholic kings, promoting a Stuart pretender who, while he resided in exile in France waiting for a chance to return to England, was known as the "King across the water." The third issue, religious differences, was closely tied to political loyalties. A debate over the right of free speech intensified in 1709 when the Reverend Henry Sacheverell, a Tory leader, delivered sermons in London's St. Paul's Cathedral attacking the Dissenters, a group of Protestants who dissented from the Church of England on certain rituals and belief. Sacheverell also included in his attack the Whigs, the moderate Tories, and those who supported the low church clergy. The Whigs brought him to trial, and Sacheverell was found guilty and barred from preaching for three years.22 Arbuthnot wove together all three crises; however, his satire focused primarily on the conduct of the war and the pursuit of peace. The narrative is entertainingly sim ple. John Bull (England) and Nic Frog (the Dutch Republic) are drapers to Lord Strutt (the late King of Spain) who, upon deciding that he no longer needs their ser vices, turns to his grandfather, Lewis Baboon (France) for his goods. John and Nic sue Lord Strutt and hire Humphrey Hocus (the Duke of Marlborough who led the English armies in Europe) as their lawyer. Humphrey assures them that the case will be quickly settled. However, the suit drags on, forcing John and Nic to pay out large amounts of their wealth. Meantime, John's first wife (the Whig Parliamentary gov ernment leader Godolphin) dies, and her death reveals that she and Humphrey Hocus were robbing John of his worldly goods and carrying on an affair. Poor John is left to care for his three daughters: Polemnia, Discordia, and Usuria, plus his mother (the Church of England) and his impoverished sister Peg (Scotland). His family's behavior and escapades bring John untold grief and embarrassments. Realizing that the suit will probably continue for sometime, John, Nic, Lewis, and their friends meet at a local tavern to resolve their differences, but they cannot reach 22Geoffrey Holmes, The Trial of Doctor Sacheverell (London, 1973).</page><page sequence="14">812 The Historian an accord. John's debts mount and family matters worsen as Peg has an affair with Jack (Calvinism, the popular Protestant movement in Scodand). Bull, in desperate circumstances, strikes an agreement with Lewis Baboon, who is also exhausted by the prolonged litigation. In the settlement, John receives Ecclesdown Castle (lands eventually gained in the treaty that ended the actual conflict) where he celebrates his good fortune and proclaims that from henceforth, he will only trade and go to market, having learned his lesson about lawsuits and lawyers.23 Although Arbuthnot's clever satire is still amusing, his lasting contribution to his country and its national symbols is the character of John Bull, a model for all future John Bulls adopted by Englishmen to explain themselves to others and to justify their behavior. Arbuthnot so effectively established Bull's personality and appear ance that few writers, artists, illustrators, or cartoonists have been willing to make any major changes. Other than modernizing his dress, developing some minor aspects of his personality, and adding girth to his more than ample physique, few substantial changes have occurred in his persona for nearly 300 years. Although John Bull's roles have varied over the years, Arbuthnot's original written description of his personality has continued to be the standard image: For the better understanding the following History, the Reader ought to know, that Bull, in the main, was an honest plain-dealing fellow, Cholerick, Bold, and of a very unconstant Temper, he dreaded not old Lewis, either at Back-Sword, single Faulcion, or Cudgel-play, but then he was very apt at quarrel with his best friends, especially if they pretended to govern him; If you flattered him, you might lead him like a child, John's temper depended very much upon the Air; his Spirits rose and fell with the Weather-glass. John was quick, and understood his business very well but no man alive was more careless, in looking into his accounts, or more cheated by Partners, Apprentices, and Servants; This was occasioned by his being a boon-companion, lov ing his bottle and his diversions; for to say the Truth, no Man kept a better house than John nor spent his money more generously.24 Caricaturists and illustrators would, in the future, easily transfer Bull's personal ity, habits, and relationships with friends and enemies into visual images, but they 23George A.

John look'd ruddy and plump, with a pair of Cheeks like a Trumpeter; Miss [Peg] look'd pale and wan, as if she had the Green-Sickness; and no wonder for John was the Darling, he had all the good Bits, was crammed with good Pullet, pig, Goose, and Capon, while Miss had only a little Oatmeal and water or a dry Crust without Butter. John has his golden Pippens, Peaches and Nectarines; poor Miss a Crab-Apple, Sloe or Blackberry. Master lay in the best Apartment, with a bed-chamber toward the South Sun. Miss log'd in Garrett, exposed to the North-Wind.25 While Arbuthnot richly described John Bull's personality, physical features, diet, and living conditions, he did not hint at the source of Bull's name. Arbuthnot was apparently inspired by Aesop, L'Estrange, Mandeville, and other purveyors of ani mal and folk tales to borrow from their use of beasts to characterize human behav ior, and this may have influenced him in fabricating the name John Bull. Alternatively, Arbuthnot could have chosen from several well-known Englishmen named Bull, including a seventeenth-century musician, an engraver at the Royal Mint, and a bishop. Two other more prominent persons have been suggested as likely candidates: author and Tory activist Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke or "Bullingbroke," and Sir Richard Bulstrode, a writer and popular London personal ity. The origins of John Bull's name have never been satisfactorily documented, which may account for his universal appeal, combining the surname of several famous men alive at the beginning of the eighteenth century with an animal whom the English used in their search for national identity. However, what John Bull rep resented and how he motivated others to write about him and to draw him was of far greater consequence in developing English and British nationalism than the ori gins of his name.26 Historians, literary critics, scholars of caricaturing, and writers on English pop ular culture and nationalism have often argued that Arbuthnot hoped to bring together the Whigs and Tories through John Bull's character. Their interpretation of Arbuthnot's efforts might be valid for the immediate issues surrounding the War of Spanish Succession, but the composite John Bull proved also to be attractive and available to various later political factions that enlisted him in their causes. Thus, although John Bull's roles might change with political winds, his personality 25Ibid., 39. 26Beattie, John Arbuthnot: Mathematician and Satirist, 92-113; Bower and Erickson, eds., John Arbuthnot, lxiv-xvii; A.

For example, in the 1750s and 1760s the radicals used him in their cartoons and broadsheets to reinforce their written arguments for the rights of "Freeborn Englishmen" against the tyranny of the Establishment or those in power. Toward the end of the eighteenth century, government leaders, in their campaign to maintain law and order at home and in the patriotic struggle to defeat the French and General (later Emperor) Napoleon, turned Bull into a loyal supporter. The two political parties of the nineteenth century, the Liberals and Conservatives, enlisted John Bull during the reign of Queen Victoria to help them win elections, pass their bills, and confront Great Britain's enemies. By that time he, along with Britannia, represented no longer the English nation-state but the British national character.27 Bull and Britannia also survived changes in popular taste and innovations in printing. Britannia had been resurrected visually, first on medals and then on coins in the mid- to late-seventeenth century, while John Bull had emerged in the early eighteenth century in an age of prose, verse, and satire. By the middle of the eighteenth century both had crept into a few isolated corners of the collective English conscious. Members of the Court, the educated gentry, and some seg ments of the middle class enjoyed the written parodies and read the broadsheets and weekly newspapers that often employed John Bull or Britannia as devices per sonifying the emerging sense of nationhood. During this same time, the literate and politically attuned segments of society began to accept humorous and satiri cal prints as convenient and desirable ways to entertain and amuse themselves and to sway public opinion, and such prints quickly gained an appreciative and loyal audience. But the popularity of the humorous print is also indebted to the caricature, which had now become an acceptable form of ridicule. The introduction and spread of caricaturing from the continent, in particular from Italy, by the mid-eigh teenth century helped insure the continued appearance and evolution of both John Bull and Britannia. Established painters turned caricaturing into pleasant diversion by sketching their clients for their own amusement or as exercises in capturing their 27Beattie, John Arbuthnot: Mathematician and Satirist, 116-19; Bower and Erickson, eds., John Arbuthnot, lxxv-vi; Jeannie Surel, "John Bull," in Patriotism: The Making and Unmaking of British National Identity, vol. 3, National Fictions, ed.

John Bull's visual debut in 1762 came at a time marked not only by the arrival of caricaturing and the print but also by an atmosphere of increasingly free thought. For several decades, Londoners had been frequenting coffeehouses to gossip and to read about life at the Court and in Parliament. Now they were visiting the print shops to choose a caricature to rent and bring home to entertain dinner party guests or family members. At the end of the eighteenth century, James Gillray, the most influential Georgian caricaturist of what scholars call "the Golden Age of English Caricaturing," and his contemporaries incorporated John Bull into their engravings. Arbuthnot's creation thus was ensured a position in both popular culture and in history. Written and visual satire, carica ture, and national symbols were now fused together, never again to be separated. In "John Bull Taking a Luncheon," published during the British war with France against Napoleon, an obese and gluttonous John Bull is shown devouring con quered French ships. The ships are served up to him by a series of figures, the first of whom is recognizable as Admiral Horatio Nelson, the English naval hero who defeated Napoleon's fleet in two successive sea battles. Nelson has a list of captured French ships in his pocket. He is backed up by British lords of the Admiralty: Howe, Duncan, Warren, St. Vincent, and others, each offering the fruits of victory.29 John Bull always had an appetite and ate well, from Arbuthnot's first descriptions all throughout his existence. His size, of course, was a sign of plentiful prosperity for all Englishmen in an age that had never heard of dieting. In this cartoon, his glut tony symbolizes Britain's victories over the French. Britannia's changing functions during the Georgian Era (reigns of George I George IV, 1714-1830) usually mirrored John Bull's evolution, but her roles began to shift by the end of the eighteenth century. Earlier Georgian illustrators some times depicted her as being humiliated or assaulted by both friends and adversaries. 28William Fever, Masters of Caricature: from Hogarth and Gillray to Scarfe and Levine, ed.

In the period leading up to the American Revolutionary war, she became a particu lar target of the American supporters. Occasionally Gillray and others subjected her to awkward, though not demeaning situations. However, during the Napoleonic wars, from 1798 to 1815, she was in vogue, gently and slowly elevated from the mundane and satirical world into a metaphysical and allegorical firmament that foreshadowed her exalted place in the Victorian era. The numerous and far-reaching changes that marked Great Britain's transfor mation from Georgian to Victorian times and the flourishing of the Industrial Revolution touched every segment of British society and culture, including the publishing world and, in particular, the visual forms of expression, caricaturing and the national images. The transition into the Victorian Age was fashioned through the changes in the printing industry and new styles and techniques of artists and</page><page sequence="19">Britannia and John Bull: From Birth to Maturity 817 illustrators. In an accelerating processes of technology, lithographs replaced engrav ings; series and multiples were prized over single prints and broadsheets; bookstores supplanted print shops; and periodicals, magazines, and daily newspapers drove out the small private press journals and weekly papers. In addition, the railroad enabled individuals, ideas, and publications to travel faster and farther. The tastes of viewers and buyers began to shift. By the 1820s and throughout the 1830s caricaturists and illustrators transformed John Bull from the simpleminded rustic into an English country squire—although he never lost his open and honest nature. Britannia, meanwhile, was elevated to higher moral planes, echoing her Roman origins, shown as semi-divine and often clad in Greek robes. Such modifi cations were honed and formalized during the 1840s as a result, in part, of the grow ing popularity of weekly magazines, especially the very successful humor publication Punch, which first appeared in 1841.30 Bull and Britannia became widely recognized national images, whose functions and roles varied in response to specific events and the shifting political scenes. Although individual artists occa sionally fashioned their figures through their own eyes and pens, they were in their final stages of maturing into their respective distinctly recognizable identities. John Bull and Britannia were evolving into stereotypes.31 The characters shown in "A Plain Question" are Britannia, John Bull, and Benjamin Disraeli, who at this time was chancellor of the exchequer. John Leech shows Bull playing the role of the protective father watching over his daughter, "Miss Britannia." This relationship between Bull and Britannia defies the historical connections between the two national images. However, in this Victorian household with its fashionable decorations including the lion and unicorn (from the British coat of arms) on the mantel and a pet bulldog eyeing Disraeli, their roles seem appropriate and believable. The young Disraeli, later to be Queen Victoria's prime minister, was in Lord Derby's Conservative cabinet in 1852, admittedly knew little about finance. John Bull therefore has a right to be concerned over what might be the intentions of his daughter's "caller." Bull's admonition to Disraeli is clearly a play on words using the names of the Conservative leadership.32 30Beattie, John Arbuthnot, 188; M. H.

What are your Intentions towards Miss Britannia?"</page><page sequence="21">Britannia and John Bull: From Birth to Maturity 819 John Leech and John Tenniel, the two most famous illustrators for Punch, shaped these two national images in the nineteenth century. As cartoonist at the magazine from 1841 to 1846, Leech set the tone and standards of the publication. He was clearly influenced by his predecessors of the 1830s who had created a John Bull who was more cultivated and restrained than the Georgian model. Leech further refined Bull for his increasingly reverential Victorian audiences. He and other Punch artists depicted Britannia as an abstract symbol, personifying the virtues of the English middle class, who defended the British Empire, crusaded for noble causes, and lec tured unruly members of the lower social orders. Eventually she became conflated with Queen Victoria—a device artists increasingly used as the British connected their monarch with Imperial Britain's triumphs around the world. While John Leech completed the metamorphoses of John Bull and Britannia from the Georgian to the Victorian images, John Tenniel, Leech's successor at Punch, perfected the stereotyped national characters for the British nation state and, indeed, for the world. Tenniel succeeded so well that John Bull would continue to look like a member of the gentry long after that group's power had begun to wane and critics observed that farmer John Bull was an anachronism, out of touch with the realities of an industrialized and urbanized nineteenth-century Britain. Notwithstanding these debates and the rare illustrator who might have experi mented with a new version, John Bull continued to be modeled in the Leech Tenniel style into the early decades of the twentieth century. He and Britannia, now fully established images of the most powerful nation on earth, could not be changed, for they had become symbols of Great Britain's political and imperial presence. Thus, Britannia and John Bull evolved from early designs as their func tions changed over time to represent two sides of British—no longer English— identity: imperial idealism combined with down-to-earth practicality in the modern era of mass communication, an expanding public awareness, and a broader political system. This brief summary of the birth and maturation of the British national images of Britannia and John Bull provides a case study for other personifications of national ism that have evolved in many Western democracies such as Columbia and Uncle Sam, who represent the United States, or France's female symbol Marianne. Although each national image has his or her own biography, all share some common characteristics and experiences. For example, all are rooted in the rise of nationalism. As a people's sense of national identity emerges, these images play a significant role in the transitional stages leading to nationalism and the transformation of a state into a nation-state. Such images either come from the top, imposed by those in con trol, as did Britannia, or from the bottom, invented out of popular culture and folk history, as was John Bull. Like Britannia, they may be inspired either by a visual</page><page sequence="22">820 The Historian image or they may come from a verbal account, as did John Bull. Likewise, their roles often change due to shifting political, social, or economic conditions. They may be kidnapped by factions, political parties, or other interest groups and used to serve their particular ends, as was the case of young lady Britannia in the Leech cartoon, who served to question Disraeli's Conservative Party ambitions. Finally, the images take on a life and appearance that becomes embedded in the mind of the public and are so closely connected with the nation that they cannot be separated. Because Britannia and John Bull were among the first national symbols to appear, they sup ply clues to a nation's attitudes and identity and may be seen as barometers, indicat ing changing perceptions over time. Further studies of national images can reveal much about a country's past, present, and even future.</page></plain_text>
