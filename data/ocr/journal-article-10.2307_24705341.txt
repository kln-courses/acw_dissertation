L. Guicciardini, 1567 Descrittione de tutti i Paei Bassi Anne Hollander has reminded us recently that man's 'natural' state de mands some sort of clothing, so that nudity is always an artificial, charged condition.1 After a consistent reluctance by fifteenth-century Netherlan dish artists to portray nude human figures at all, the explosion of such forms in early sixteenth-century images, including a new repertoire of themes from Roman mythology, indicates a new and conscious pur posefulness on the part of an artist such as Jan Gossaert. The task of this essay will be to examine these nudes in light of the subjects they depict - and, to a lesser extent, with their ornamental and architectural settings — in order to analyze their significance and to suggest the connotational meanings of these new forms in the North Netherlands.2 I. Λάατη and Eve The obvious place to begin analysis of Gossaert's heroic nudes is with the theme of Adam and Eve, which remained a preoccupation through out his career.3 From his first realizations of the Fall of Man, Gossaert took pains to idealize the figures in an Italianate idiom. At first, the panel, Lugano, Thyssen coll. figures are virtual copies after Diirer prints, always a major source for Gossaert's Italianisms. The earliest instance seems to be the small, arched 2 Albrecht Diirer, Adam and Eve, panel in Lugano (fig. 1) that replicates the figures from Dürer's renowned 1504. engraving. 1504 engraving (fig. 2) 4 The striking element in this version, when com pared to later Gossaert Adam and Eve images, is its quiet calm. The massive figures stand in balanced contrapposto poses. This moment pre cedes the actual Fall, when neither figure has yet eaten from the forbidden fruit and become conscious of nakedness and sin. Both the subsequent woodcut by Dürer, from the Small Woodcut Passion of 1511, and Gos saert's emulation of it on the exterior of the Malvagna Triptych (fig. 3) show the Fall with the two figures quietly but tenderly interlaced beneath the tree. Gossaert's later figure groups of Adam and Eve will increasingly diverge from Dürer's example, particularly through their intensified physical action and interaction. Whereas Dürer rather than Italy had provided the model for these earliest Gossaert images, the artist's experience of antique statuary in Rome would exert an increasing influence on his heroic nudes. In particular, two figural drawings have survived as testimony of Gossaert's Roman 1 1 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, 1 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, panel, Eugano, Thjssen coll. 2 Albrecht Dürer, Adam and Eve, 1504. engraving.</page><page sequence="2">3 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, exterior, Malvagna triptych, Palermo, SILVER experience.5 The first, a Standing Apollo (fig. 4), records a Roman basalt copy after a Greek original, the Apollo Citharoedus (today in the Museo Nazionale, Naples; formerly in the collection of Canon Benedetto Sassi, Rome). Here the distinctive hip-shot pose, muscular torso, and upraised arm provided elements for several future Adam and Eves by Gossaert. As if to compete a sculpted form of Adam in the round, Gossaert's frog's eye view drawing from behind of a Standing Hercules (fig. 5) portrays an even more muscular image of ideal masculinity, based on the Hercules Boarium, discovered in the late fifteenth century hear the Circus Maximus (today in the Capitoline Museum).6 In this instance, Gossaert even records the apple of the Hesperides in the left hand of the hero, the classical motif closest to the fruit of Adam's transgression. Moreover, the tight curls favored by Diirer and already present in Gossaert are added to this drawing after a classical source. When Gossaert returned to the Adam and Eve theme in a series of draw ings during the late teens or early 1520s, he dramatically heightened the Galleria Nationale delta Sicilia. erotic contacts between his principal figures. The Chatsworth Adam and Eve (fig. 6), a presentation drawing on grey prepared paper with firm contours and hatched white highlights, can be compared in figure types to Gossaert's dated 1517 Hercules and Deianeira (fig. 22; see below).7 Dür er's 1511 woodcut of the Fall still provided the gesture of Eve's arm draped around the neck of Adam as well as the tightly crossed legs of Adam; however, this latter posture, together with the powerful body leaning forward from a tree trunk, stands even closer to the Adam and Eve (fig. 7) engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi in Rome (ca. 1512-14).8 The decorative, flowing, thick unbound hair of Eve owes a debt to Diir er's 1504 engraving, but its form and abundance more closely resemble 4 Jan Gossaert, Apollo, drawing, the engravings of II Robetta (Florence, 1462—1535), specifically his Al Venice, Galleria dell Accademia. legory of Carnal EoveS Indeed, this unfettered hair not only attests to a certain naive innocence on the part of Eve but also connotes sensual abandon. Unbound hair appears in Hans Baldung's sensual Adam and Eve woodcut of 1511 (fig. 8), in which Adam also fondles the breasts of his mate, and in Baldung's drawings of naked witches.10 Apparently, wild hair was to be equated with a wild nature, as though hair without re straint was a corollary of uninhibited nudity (appropriate to Eve before the Fall). In similar fashion, the body language of crossed legs suggests eroticism in both Cranach and Baldung paintings, including several Eves, as well as in Robetta engravings.11 Gossaert's Chatsworth drawing fur ther underscores its amorous point by drawing the two figures so close together, clasping one another. Eve's genitalia are made explicit, and Adam's open-mouthed, vacant stare crosses Eve's body towards her hair rather than towards the apple that is touched by both figures' hands. Perhaps the most impressive feature about the Chatsworth figures is their awkwardness, despite their massive bulk. Adam supports himself on his hip and buttock against the tree trunk and tugs Eve towards him, her standing leg leaning precariously into Adam's thigh. This arrangement serves to destabilize the dignity and beauty of these figures and to under 3 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, exterior, Malvagna triptych, Palermo, Galleria Nationale della Sicilia. 4 Jan Gossaert, Apollo, drawing, Venice, Galleria dell' Accademia.

Gossaert's Adam and Eve body types manage to incorporate, if not to reconcile, two contradictory aspects of the First Parents: on the one hand, their epic dignity, beauty, and importance; on the other hand, their fal lible concupiscence, leading inevitably to disobedience and lust. Dürer's 1504 engraving and Gossaert's Lugano copy after it present the dignity and majesty of mankind just prior to the Fall. By the time of the Chat sworth drawing, only the physical vestiges of that dignity that Dürer had accorded to the Italianate forms of the nudes remains, but that very physicality and fulness is bound up in the ardor of their sensual embraces. One might carp at such a reading of the Chatsworth drawing were it not for the presence of other Gossaert drawings and paintings of the Fall of Man during the 1520s. In a Frankfurt drawing copy (fig. 9), clearly re vealing its Gossaert prototype, the muscular Adam, supported only on one arm, lies hard upon the ground, pressed by a kneeling Eve who hovers over him.12 She extends the apple into his tentative grasp; directly above the fruit and Adam's hand, her firm breast and unbound hair visually equate the tasting of the forbidden fruit with the sin of lust.13 6 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, drawing, Chatsworth, Devonshire coll. 5 Jan Gossaert, Hercules, drawing, London, Lord Wharton coll. . \ ■■$»■■■■ - i.

SILVER Once again the source for Adam's twisted pose seems to come from Italy, specifically from Marcantonio's river god (reversed) in the lower right corner of the engraved judgment of Paris (fig. 10) A As Schwarz makes clear, these same poses of the Frankfurt drawing are repeated by Gossaert in a painting (Berlin, Schloss Grunewald; perhaps a copy) in which a sensuous Eve with her legs crossed lies upon the ground and reaches upward to Adam.15 Once more, Adam perches precariously against a rock and leans forward to embrace his mate. Eve holds the apple at the intersection of their lips. This same motif of a kiss between Adam and Eve was carried further by another Gossart drawing (fig. 12), where Adam's muscular torso can be compared to the Gossaert Man of Sorrows etching (fig. 11) A Eve ex changes the apple with Adam (significantly located between their res pective left, or sinister, hands, although possibly this drawing was in tended to be the basis of a woodcut), while she pulls their heads together in a kiss. Adam stares open-mouthed at his mate, as in the Chatsworth drawing. Eve's bow-knotted hair can also be found in the painted Gru newald and East Berlin Eves (fig. 16), as well as on the 1521 Brussels Venus (fig. 28) or 1517 Birmingham Deianeira (fig. 22), a pair of sensuous but threatening mythical females (see below).17 In addition, the two figures' legs overlap in the sexualized 'slung-leg' motif. If the Albertina drawing heightens the figures' sexual intimacy, then a Providence chalk drawing (fig. 13) offers an erotic climax to Gossaert's conceptions of the Fall of Man.18 Once more, both figures are seated, a position that seems tied to a suggestion of sin, specifically sloth or luxuria. The Providence drawing appears to be an amalgam of the Frankfurt drawing and the Grunewald painting. Both figures lean towards one another, groping for each other's genitalia. Eve reaches for the apple with her left hand, for Adam's crotch with her right hand, thereby ex plicitly equating Original Sin with sexual awareness. Adam's comple mentary gesture is a curious, unexplained motif (also found in the Adam of the Albertina drawing and in the Eve of both the Frankfurt drawing and the East Berlin painting, as well as in Marcantonio's Adam and Eve engraving): he clasps a branch of the tree. This gesture seems to redouble or reinforce the plucking gesture, even as it underscores the instability of the figure. It could indicate Adam's complicity in the Fall, underscore his physical weakness, or else recapitulate Eve's own prior disobedience. On the other hand, it could be taken in the opposite sense, that is, as the negation of Eve's action through a prolonged contact with the Tree of Life prior to the actual moment of the Fall. Schwarz suggests that Gos saert copied Adam's figure and pose from the Creation of Man fresco by Michelangelo on the Sistine Chapel ceiling; however, this portion of the ceiling is usually assigned by scholars to the second campaign of the Chapel decoration, i.e. after the scaffolding was moved in mid-1510 — thus considerably after Gossaert's departure from Rome.19 However, Marcantonio's Adam from the Adam and Eve engraving presents an only slightly altered variant of Michelangelo's Adam with outstretched right 7 Marcantonio Kaimondi, Adam and Eve, engraving. 8 Hans Baldung, Adam and Eve, 1511. woodcut.</page><page sequence="5">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands 9 Jan Gossaert (copy), Adam and Eve, drawing, Frankfurt, Staedel Institute. leg and bent (now crossed) left leg, and its torsion is much closer to Gossaert than the open figure of Michelangelo. Eve's body and pose resemble Italian nudes only generally, such as Marco Dente's Van and Syrinx and Marcantonio's 'dictionary' of female nudity, the Judgment of Paris (fig. 10).™ When Gossaert painted Adam and Eve, his overt eroticism was usually held in check more than in his drawings (the Grunewald painting being a notable, presumably late, exception).21 The large Hampton Court Adam and Eve (fig. 14) is arrayed like a Düreresque, full-figured variation on Marcantonio, with Adam leaning against the tree to the left and Eve echoing his cross-legged pose at the right (Eve also echoes Jacopo de' Barbari's engraving, Mars and Venus, fig. 15). Dürer's 1504 engraving still exerts a powerful influence on the figure types (and even on Eve's fig leaf), but the crossed legs, leaning bodies, and linked arms provide both instability and eros. Adam's open-mouthed stare and nervous nibbling of his forefinger suggest sexual tension; his garlanded 'loin-cloth' fore shadows the aftermath of shame, when the two figures cover their naked ness. A wisp of Eve's hair detours suggestively toward her sex. of Paris, engraving. Another large Gossaert Adam and Eve (fig. 16) adds a lively, if unsettling movement to the figures. Adam seems almost to be in flight from Eve, Μ w^° clutches the tree while proffering the apple. Both physiques closely resemble the Albertina drawing by Gossaert. The odd, dancelike pose of Adam clearly derives from Italian models, such as the nude executioner in Marcantonio's Massacre of the Innocents,22 Once more, Eve is an enli vened, Düreresque exaggeration of Marcantonio's Eve. The presence of an ape, symbol of animal passion, below Adam in the corner of the painting indicates the unhappy outcome of the event as well as man's 10 Marcantonio Kaimondi, Judgment 9 Jan Gossaert (copy), Adam and Eve, drawing, Frankfurt, Staedel Institute. 10 Marcantonio Kaimondi, Judgment of Paris, engraving. 1' iii *</page><page sequence="6">SILVER own kinship with the lesser animals.23 The ape, too, is eating a fruit. This is the only Gossaert painting where Eve's genitals are clearly visible, although Adam's anachronistically are still covered (assuming this sec tion to be unretouched); in contrast, the more erotic, later Schloss Gru newald Adam and Eve shows Adam conspicuously unclad. This covering reverses the biblical narration (Gen. 3, 7), where the two figures put on fig leaves to cover their nakedness only after eating of the forbidden fruit, sp it indicates Adam's modesty in contrast to Eve's sexual awareness. We are at a mid-point of the Fall of Man, where Eve has already eaten the apple, but Adam not yet. Once again, Original Sin and sex are inex tricably linked, and Gossaert presents us with tangible signs of Adam's reluctance and shame. 11 Jan Gossaert, Christ in Distress, etching. 11 Jan Gossaert, Christ in Distress, etching. .^£Ks •fc* • -</page><page sequence="7">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands 12 jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, Death is the other product of mankind's disobedience to God, and Gos drawing, Vienna, Albertina. saert continues the story of the Fall with a woodcut rendering of Cain Killing Abel (fig. 17).24 These figure types resemble the figure of Adam 13 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, in the Frankfurt and Albertina drawings, but both the twisted pose of drawing, Providence, Rhode Island clubbjng figure and the dense network of hatched lines in the wood School of Design. .

This same model served Gossaert earlier for the male figure in his woodcut of Hercules and Deianeira (see below). The significance of this subject of Cain and Abel is the same as in its appearance above the figure of Eve on the upper right interior of Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece — namely, the connection between Original Sin and the presence of this murderous evil within the world.26 Once more, man's animal nature dominates over his spiritual side, just as Adam and Eve's lust had subverted their in nocent state of grace. Lucas van Ley den's 1529 cycle of six engravings of the Fall of Man concludes with two scenes of Abel, the prototype of sacrifice: Cain Killing Abel (fig. 19) and Adam and Eve Earn enting Abel (fig. 20). In this light, Gossaert's woodcut Cain and Abel can be seen as the Old Testament antitype of the New Testament Passion of Christ and as the antecedent to his own etched image of the Mocking of Christ (fig. 11). 7 12 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, drawing, Vienna, Albertina. °™&gt;; " - -.'.4£—* 13 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, drawing, Providence, Rhode Island School of Design.</page><page sequence="8">SILVER (Reproduced by gracious permission of H.

In these Old Testament instances, however, no simple equation of beauty with holiness can be made. Gossaert takes pains to 16 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, make evident the lustfulness and violence that literally dis-grace our First Parents. We simultaneously behold man as made in the image of God — hence the physical likeness between Gossaert's Adams and his adult Christ in the Mocking — yet also motivated by animal passions and ener gies. Such a dialectical tension between opposites is inherent to the Ren aissance concept of man, midway between God and the beasts on the 'great chain of being'.27 Yet Gossaert's profound consciousness of mankind's Original Sin in the Adam and Eve scenes (or in the Cain and Abel or Mocking of Christ prints) accords more fully with Augustine's City of God, where the flesh begins to lust against the spirit: God, then, made man in his own image. For He created for him a soul endowed with reason and intelligence, so that he might excel all the creatures of earth, air, and sea, which were not so gifted ... And God was not ignorant that man would sin, and that, being himself made subject to death, he would propagate men doomed to die, and that 14 Jan Gossaert, Adam and Eve, Hampton Court, Royal Collection (Reproduced by gracious permission of H.

Esther Gordon Dotson's exegesis of the Sistine Ceiling has elucidated the Augustinian theological foundations of Michelangelo's masterwork, which underscores the dual nature and central placement of man within creation.29 The Genesis scenes are at once the typological antecedents of Christ's future redeeming mission, yet they are simulta neously the turning point of human history. Michelangelo's Creation of Eve was used also as the location of the chancel screen, thereby separating the Fall of Man and subsequent Genesis scenes of man's later decadence from the earlier creation scenes reserved for the space above the choir of the chapel. As for the bodies themselves, for Michelangelo, the human figure was the crown and the sum of creation itself as well as the op portunity to display artistic mastery of difficulta in complex movement: Venus, engraving. There is nothing more noble and pious than good painting because nothing excites and elevates devotion in persons of discretion so much as the perfection of a work that, surpassing all difficulties, approaches and is joined to God. For good painting is nothing if not an image of the perfection of God and a reflection of his own painting.30 Formal grace becomes the visible manifestation of spiritual beauty. This objective correlative is perhaps most tangible in the variety of move ments and posture of the ignudi of the Sistine Ceiling, intended in all likelihood to be understood as wingless angels.31 Even within Michelangelo's images of human perfection, however, the nude figures of Adam and Eve were seen to be subject to sin and a fall from grace (a pun appropriate to the awkward and 'graceless' figures of the Expulsion, now excluded from grace forever). Indeed, Michelangelo's Eve also implies sexual activity herself, as Steinberg's close reading of Eve's 'idle' hand, in line with her grasping of the fruit in her other hand, has made clear.32 As in several of Gossaert's later Fall of Man scenes, the sexual dimension of Original Sin is associated with a reclining position close to the earth. Adam, joining his mate, also reaches for the fruit while clasping the tree with his other hand. Gossaert's comprehension of these theological implications expressed through the idealized nude seems to emulate the achievement of Mich elangelo. Whether through intuition or through instruction during his visit to Rome, Gossaert acquired an awareness of the meaning of human beauty, wherein Christ and Adam conform to the same idealized physical canon, yet Adam falls victim to his own concupiscence, the 'lower nature' that wars with spirituality (1 Galatians 5, 16—21) and causes all mankind to be mortal and lesser in future. As Augustine declares: For God, the author of natures, not of vices, created man upright, but man being of his own will corrupted and justly condemned, begot corrupted and condemned children {City of God XIII, 14). 15 Jacopo de' Barbari, Mars and Venus, engraving.</page><page sequence="10">SILVER Unlike Michelangelo, Gossaert devotes particular attention to this sin, especially carnal sin, as the root source of future barriers ('the whole train of evil'; Augustine) that separate mankind from divinity - his theme in the contrasting figures of the Mocking of Christ. In similar fashion, it is postlapsarian lust and its attendant shame that refashions innocent Edenic nudity into 'nakedness'. Adam and Eve cannot afterwards inter act physically - nor can we, their descendents - with that innocent, though seemingly erotic, intimacy reserved by Gossaert for the Madonna and Child (see below), who restore the lost state of grace.33 II. Mythologies Just as witchcraft literature, such as the 1484 Malleus Maleficarum, could tie a proclivity towards evil specifically to women, beginning with the 18 Ugo da Carpi after Baldassare archetype Eve, so could Gossaert present a similar misogyny in his Peru^gi, Hercules Expelling Envy mythological subjects as well as in his Adam and Eve scenes.34 Gossaert's from the lemple of the Muses, interest in mythological figures and scenes began with his visit to Italy and copying of ancient statues: the Spinario, the Capitoline Hercules (fig. 5), and the Apollo in Kepose (fig. 4) are the surviving instances.35 Folie has rightly stressed the distinctive personal intensification of qualities that Gossaert adds to his models - the youthfulness of the Spinario, the muscular power of the Hercules, and the graceful elegance of the Apollo. Obviously many of these qualities were retained by the artist when he 17 ]an Gossaert, Cain Murdering Abel, woodcut. 19 Hue as van Hey den, Cain Murdering Abel, 1529. engraving. 10 17 Jan Gossaert, Cain Murdering Abel, woodcut. rr'-v's« l (ulUsL^^ 18 Ugo da Carpi after Baldassare Peruzri, Hercules Expelling Envy from the Temple of the Muses, woodcut. 19 Lucas van Ley den, Cain Murdering Abel, 1529. engraving. k i§ f f fit Wkfm mm Kef</page><page sequence="11">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands painted mythological subjects later in his career, but in these works, too, his use of the beautiful, idealized nude is usually allied with a heightened conciousness of the greater physicality of the figures and an attendant greater carnal implication of nakedness. Earliest and most neutral of Gossaert's mythological subjects is his 1516 Neptune and Amphitrite (fig. 21) Ν This picture was specially commis sioned by Gossaert's maecenas, Philip of Burgundy, as its inscription tells us: A-PLUS-SERA/phe + burgne. The subject, too, was doubtless chosen by Philip, who held the title of Admiral from October 1515 to 1517. Numerous scholars have pointed to the dependence of the two massive figures on Diirer's 1504 Adam and Eve engraving (fig. 2), already the model for Gossaert's Lugano Adam and Eve (fig. 1). In addition, Gossaert utilized the engraving Mars and Venus by Jacopo de' Barbari (fig. 15), who is 'documented' as having worked for Philip at his chateau at Souburg, near Middelburg, possibly alongside Gossaert.37 Gossaert's 20 Lucas van Leyden, Adam and Neptune essentially repeats the pose of Diirer's Adam, along with a turn Eve Lamenting Abel, 1529. engraving, of the head and an embracing gesture like Jacopo's Mars. Amphitrite closely approximates (acopo's Venus, especially in her stance and her broad hips as well as in her inclined head; her small breasts and broad shoulders echo the open stance of Diirer's Eve. Gossaert, however, has exaggerated the bulk of both figures to an almost ludicrous extreme, as if to underscore their mythic grandeur. In addition, the ivory lustre of the figures' skins suggests their otherworldliness, like the pallor of the heavenly Madonna in the Vienna St. Luke (fig. 35) or the Chicago Ma donna in Glory (fig.38). Herzog has devoted considerable attention to the carefully structured, correctly 'antique' architectural setting of the Neptune and AmphitriteA He concludes that this temple precinct is a fanciful hybrid, composed out of a combination of canonical ancient elements: bucrania, triglyphs, gut tae, bead-and-reel, and egg-and-dart motifs, all of which Gossaert could have studied from ruins in Rome. Gossaert's use of Roman Doric col umns and capitals is appropriate to the character, power, and importance of these divinities within such a space. Herzog éven notes that the floór of Gossaert's temple is covered with a layer of Neptune's watery element. The perspective of Gossaert's painting implies a low viewpoint or the elevation of these figures above the observer, another indication of their supernatural status. The significance of the mythological figures may not extend beyond a casual equation of Neptune with Philip of Burgundy, who indeed never married, so there can be no Amphitrite referent in his life. Perhaps the goddess could be understood as a personification of the sea, domesticated by her lord. Neptune's laurel crown clearly marks this lord of the sea as a Roman triumphator, another obvious compliment to Philip. Neptune, however, like his brother Jupiter, was a notorious philanderer.39 For tunately for him, his bride Amphitrite was a calmer spouse than the jealously vindictive Juno (except in the instance of Neptune's infatuation with the nymph Scylla, whom Amphitrite transformed into a frightful 11 20 hue as van Eeyden, Adam and Eve Earn enting Abel, 1529. engraving.</page><page sequence="12">SILVER 21 Jan Gossaert, Neptune and monster).

Trident in hand, Neptune presents a majestic and dec orative cult image within a classical temple, a painting wholly in the antyksche manier and a tribute to both the taste and the office of Philip of Burgundy. Although Amphitrite serves as Neptune's consort and complement in this large 1516 panel, a 1517 Gossaert painting (fig. 22) and subsequent woodcut of Hercules and Deianeira (fig. 26) heighten the sexual tension within a mythological scene.40 The painting is situated once more in a shallow classical niche, yet here the female figure occupies the central position. Reliefs under the bench seat represent Hercules' earlier acts of heroism: his conquest of Antaeus, defeat of the Nemean lion, and carry ing of the global burden of Atlas. Yet the deportment of the two seated figures offers an ignoble contrast; despite their mythic beauty, the two nudes are interlaced in an erotic embrace.

Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands both his seated posture and overtly sexual combination of both cross legs and the slung-leg motif indicate his erotic intentions (Possibly the ab sence of his protective lion pelt garb also indicates Hercules' abandon ment of heroic virtue). Deianeira sits upon a significant cloak, one she had soaked in the blood of the centaur Nessus, who had deceitfully as sured her that it would secure for her the love and fidelity of Hercules (Ovid, Met., IX, 101-280). On the contrary, the cloak would inflame Hercules' skin and stick fast to him, ultimately causing the death of his mortal body. Thus these beautiful and powerful figures offer a mythic parallel to Adam and Eve, whereby the blandishments of an evil and lustful halfbeast deceived the woman and brought death to her mate. Gossaert's painting equates their amorous liaison with this doom and presents such sexuality as the antithesis of Hercules' heroism (indeed, his victory over Antaeus can be taken metaphorically to be a conquest over the earthly impulses). Visually, the idealized nudes again carry for Gos saert implications of potential sexuality. In particular, Deianeira's knotted hairdo and flowing locks, trickling along the perimeter of her breasts, would later reappear in Gossaert's overtly erotic Eves: the East Berlin and Schloss Grunewald paintings and the Albertina and Providence drawings. Emotions of both love and jealousy, each engendered by woman, become the undoing of man. Thus, like the Fall of Man, does the neutral, upright calm of Neptune and Amphitrite give way to the fatal passions and erotic actions of Hercules and Deianeira. The forms of Gossaert's Birmingham painting again derive directly from Italian prints. The tightly-crossed legs and bent waist of Deianeira can be found in Robetta's engraving, Allegory of Mother Earth (fig. 23); in Robetta's Allegory of Envy (fig. 24) the same pose is made explicitly sexual, when the female figure sits in the lap of a male suitor and slings her legs over and between his.41 Hercules' bent muscular frame seems to derive from familiar Marcantonio engravings: the Mars, Venus, and Cupid (fig.25) or Adam and Eve (fig. 7). In similar fashion, the Hercules and 24 11 Kobetta, Allegory of Envy, Deianeira woodcut (fig. 26) closely copies figures from the Ugo da Carpi engraving. woodcut after Peruzzi, Hercules Expelling Envy from the Temple of the Muses (fig. 18). In this case, Gossaert's Hercules (like his Cain, fig. 17) emulates Peruzzi's Apollo in presenting a complex, twisting view that exposes both a muscular back and profile hips and face. In addition, Gossaert's woodcut Deianeira adopts the face, hair, left arm, and cloak over her lap from the muse in the corner of Ugo da Carpi's print. Once more situating the mythic figures in a classical architectural setting, this woodcut Hercules and Deianeira is even more sexually assertive. Her cules actually climbs onto the willing body of his mate, literally slinging his leg over her entire lap as he places his hand onto her (cloak-draped) thigh. Believing it to be a love talisman, Deianeira clutches her cloak nervously and tightly with her left hand; with her right hand she lightly caresses the shoulder of Hercules.

Deianeira serves, therefore, as a mythic equivalent of the Power of Women topos so P°Pu^r 4n the woodcuts of Lucas van Leyden.46 Moreover, among * the Power of Women paintings by Lucas Cranach, we find an analogous 25 Marcantonio Raimondi, Mars, scene, Hercules and Omphale, wherein the strongest of heroes puts on Venus, and Cupid, engraving. women's clothing and takes up the distaff.47 Love's dangerous power becomes explicit in the theme of Gossaert's tiny 1521 1Venus and Amor (jig. 28).48 Here, the goddess of love herself falls prey to the arrows of her all-conquering son. The poetic inscription reads: 'Shameless son, you who are inclined to torment men and gods, you do not (even) spare your (own) mother; cease, lest you be destroyed'. Gossaert's source for the gyrating, full-bodied, nude female figure of Venus is again Marcantonio, specifically the Venus and Cupid in a Niche (B 311; fig. 29); the contrapposto Cupid derives from Marcantonio's Venus after the Bath (B 297; an engraving also copied by Altdorfer, W 167). Consistent with other Gossaert mythologies, the setting is fully classical, a niche with columns, close in form to the Roman Doric of the Neptune and Amphitrite. The erotic associations of Venus take on a distinctly negative, moralizing tone by means of the secondary images adduced, as in the Hercules and Deianeira painting, below the main figures. Unlike the virtuous Labors of Hercules episodes that contrast with the erotic Her cules in Birmingham, these 'bronze' roundels (another echo of the Sistine Ceiling?) portray the adulterous union of Venus and Mars and their sub sequent discovery by the cuckolded Vulcan. The standing figures of Venus and Mars, echoing the Jacopo de' Barbari engraving (fig. 15) already utilized for Gossaert's Neptune and Amphitrite (fig. 21), appear at the right after the discovery scene at the left, thus reversing (perversely? as if deliberatley flaunting) the normal left-to-right eye movement of the observer. Thus are the portentous words of the inscription fulfilled as if spoken by Venus; and thus are the actions of the main figures made clear. The goddess twists, attempting to restrain the hand and the bow of her bold and dangerous son, yet she acts too late, as the roundels reveal. Lust leads to adultery and then to disgrace, even among the classical gods. Cupid's arrow vanquishes even the mighty god of war. The full-bodied, fleshy sensuality of Venus is crowned by her flowing hair, fluttering scarf, and top-knot, akin to the hairdo of Gossaert's Eves, seen above.

This scene, then, is fraught with unresolved and illicit sexual tension despite its formal dignity of both figures and setting, appropriate to the mythological sub ject.

Yet the instability of Gossaert's panel also finds its analogue here in Lucas's presentation of an uncomfortable twisted pose and anxious glance out of the image by Mars (whose own headband flutters actively around its knot on his brow) as well as in the dramatic separation of the figures by Mars's vertical central sword, on which he continues to lean. On Venus's side, a large ball connotes both the instability and the global dominion of this carnal passion. Lucas's architecture as well as his figures in Mars, Venus, and Cupid show evident dependence on Gossaert's woodcut of Hercules and Deianeira, and he has also adopted the same moralizing message of martial strength undone by the weakness of the flesh. Mars and Venus also serves as the subject of a Maerten van Heemskerck canvas of 1536 (Milan, Gavazzi collection) as well as the panel of Venus and Mars Surprised by Vulcan (ca. 1540; Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Mu seum).50 In the Venus and Mars, Cupid again urges on the amorous couple, nude and entwined, beside a lustful satyr fragment and within a ruinous vault, metaphors of the destruction caused by lust. As Veldman has made clear, the Vienna panel offers a reversal of the usual image of carnal indulgence and depicts the triumph of righteous moral indignation over luxuria (Prudence an Justice are the personified virtues presented in grisaille — along with a Dutch quotation from Proverbs 11 — on the reverse of the Vulcan panel). Again the mythological scene, replete with muscular and sensuous idealized bodies for the pagan deities, conveys a Christian moralizing attitude, founded upon the illicit sexuality inherent in the subjects. Indeed, Heemskerck's 1545 panel of Venus and Cupid (Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz Museum) shows the same theme as Gos 29 Marcantonio Kaimondi, Venus saert's 1521 Brussels panel: namely, Venus holding on to Cupid's bow and Cupid in a Niche, engraving. jn a vain attempt to restrain her son, even as Vulcan approaches from the background with the net that will later trap and embarrass Venus and Mars.51 Shortly after the telling of the tale of Mars and Venus in Book IV of Ovid's Metamorphoses comes the story of. Salmacis, which echoes the theme of manly vigor sapped by the enervating power of women: You are going to hear the story of a fountain Salmacis, with an evil reputation Because its waters make men weak and feeble, Whoever goes bathing there. The cause is hidden The fountain's enervating power well-known .. ,52 30 Vucas van Veyden, Mars, Venus, and Cupid, 1530. engraving. The tale of fifteen-year-old Hermaphroditus, named for his parents, Hermes and Aphrodite, recounts how the youth falls prey to the non chaste, non-hunting water nymph, Salmacis. Here it is the beauty of the modest boy and the lust of the nymph that set the tone of the tale, and the intertwining of bodies inherent in sexuality becomes a literal fusion here. Gossaert illustrates this myth in a small rounded panel (fig. 31), where the active struggling of the powerful bodies conveys clearly the opposed wills of the two figures.53 Salmacis, like a reversed figure of Gossaert's Brussels Venus, here clings to the resisting Hermaphroditus, who is clad with the same leafy loincloth of shame/modesty as Gossaert's 16 29 Marcantonio Raimondi, Venus and Cupid in a Niche, engraving. 30 Lucas van Ley den, Mars, Venus, and Cupid, 1530. engraving.</page><page sequence="17">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands 31 jan Gossaert, Hermaphroditus and Salmacis, Rotterdam, Bojmans van Bemingen Museum. Adams. Indeed Gossaert's unstable yet active, sensualized and inter twined figures grow out of his Birmingham Hercules (fig. 22), in contrast to his earlier balanced and stable Neptune and Amphitrite (fig. 21). At the same time, such figures presage his sexually responsive and physically mobile Adam in the later'Adam and Eve scenes. The painted Hampton Court Adam and Eve (fig. 14) offers analogous unbalanced main figures and figure types (plus Adam's leafy loincloth, also present for Eve but significantly lacking for Salmacis) with a pensive but willingly inclined Adam. Reluctance like that of Hermaphroditus can also be seen in the 'fleeing' Adam of the East Berlin Adam and Eve (fig. 16).

For the slenderer body type of Hermaphroditus as well as his upraised arm, Gos saert recycled his Roman drawing study of the antique statue of Apollo Citharoedus (fig. 4), a work then thought to be a hermaphrodite.54 Thus not only was the ancient canon consulted for the beauty of the figure itself, but also the very subject chosen was paired to an appropriate, specific antique model. All of Gossaert's mythological subjects (with the possible exception of Neptune and Amphitrite and the Hercules labors, all tributes to his noble patron, Philip of Burgundy) boil down to male-female confrontations centered on the theme of love. In most cases, powerful and heroic males - especially Hercules but also Mars - are disarmed and overcome by female beauty and their own lustful inclinations. Love of this kind proves to be vain, even destructive. Hermaphroditus alone offers resistance, but he, too, succumbs to a nymph's persistence and is 'weakened' by the fusion of their male and female natures. In Gossaert's remaining mytho logies, this basic warning against fleshly concupiscence takes on different forms and stresses the female side of things but still provides erotic voy eurism for the male viewer. Most striking as an erotic warning and display is the Rovigo Venus (fig. 32).55 Here the goddess of sensuous love presents herself in isolation upon a pedestal and offers only the classically-inspired pudica gesture as a token to suggest her modesty. The contrapposto stance of this Venus clearly derives ultimately from antique (or Renaissance) models and re sembles, in reverse, the Apollo Citharoedus of Gossaert's Roman drawing (fig. 4); however, the fleshy female forms as well as the pose also seem to depend on Dürer's Eve, reversed, from the 1504 Adam and Eve (fig. 2; note especially her feet, plus her sloping shoulders and high waist).56 From Jacopo de' Barbari come a number of other motifs for the Rovigo panel. Barbari's early Victory and Fame engraving (ca. 1498—1500; B. 18) not only provides the Diireresque frontal nude adopted by Gossaert but also suggests the theme of amor omnia vincit, made explicit in the painting by the trophies of war lying at the feet of Venus. A later Barbari en graving, Victory declining amid Trophies (ca. 1504; B. 23) continues this theme of love's triumph, akin to Venus's dominion over warlike Mars, by means of piles of arms and amor.57 Still another Barbari engraving, Nude Woman Holding a Mirror (ca. 1504; B. 12) introduces the traditional attribute of the vice of Vanity, into the hands of the goddess of love.58 Gossaert has enhanced the attributes of vain splendor and pleasure by adorning both Venus and her mirror with jewels and crowning her head with the familiar sensuous curls and long hair. In all likelihood, the prominent vase of flowers at her feet alludes both to beauty and to its perishability. An early inventory (after 1520) interprets this picture as a 'Vanitas vel omnia vanitas' while recording it as a 'standing nude female figure'.59 Yet the attributes of a helmet and armor at her feet, together with the adjacent winged quiver and bow appear to allude to both Mars and Amor and to identify the nude figure as Venus.60 Thus the figure is 18</page><page sequence="19">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands Munich, Alte Pinakothek. 32 Jan Gossaert, Venus (ν ana), Kovigo, Accademia dei Concordi. revealed to be both a Venus and a Vanitas (a Venus vana in the formu 33 Jan Gossaert, Danaë, 1527. lation of Sterk) - an ominous if sensuous use of the mythological nude to provide a warning to the perceptive viewer. Here the 'cheesecake' sumptuousness and soft modelling of the nude goddess is a deliberate appeal to the male viewer's voyeurism and prurience, but the Venus figure is accompanied with quite traditional attributes of Vanity (akin to the secondary scenes in the Brussels Venus and Amor) in order to remind the Christian observer of his own temptable sinfulness and his mortal venality. III. Madonna Pictures Gossaert's final mythological figure, the Munich Danaë of 1527 (fig. 33) offers the obverse of Venus's negative coin. Although nude above the waist, Danaë embodies the virtue of modesty (Pudicita) within her tower of Chastity according to allegorized medieval and Renaissance exegeses of her tale.61 Indeed, Danaë, visited by a golden shower from the king of heaven, could be seen as a type for the Virgin Mary herself (and her heroic son, Perseus, as a type for Christ).62 Gossaert seems to have fol lowed this earlier Northern tradition, in contrast to a later, recently re discovered 1603 Goltzius Danaë (fig. 34) that shows the venality of the 19 32 ]an Gossaert, Venus (ν ana), Kovigo, Accademia dei Concordi. 33 Jan Gossaert, Danaë, 1527.

Gossaert's setting of the Danaë episode places her within a nichelike, collonaded, hemicyclical chamber, parallel to his own, current panels of the Madonna, most notably the Prado Madonna and Child in a Niche (fig. 43', see below). Even the pearl diadem and transparent veil of Danaë link her to Gossaert's favorite motifs to adorn the heads of his Madonnas, and the seated figure on a cushion at ground level recalls the humility pose of the Virgin in the Prague St. Cuke Drawing the Madonna (fig. 36). The gold shower of the god's presence falls directly down onto this young virgin's lap, just as the Virgin herself miraculously conceived at the time of the Annunciation. Often this conception, too, is depicted in religious paintings by means of golden rays of light, as in Campin's Merode Altarpiece. Yet the dignity of Gossaert's Danaë figure receives reinforcement via her surroundings. Gossaert not only envelops Danaë within the antique Ionic hemicycle, discussed by Herzog, but also places her above and in front of an impressive skyline of buildings, including porches in both a classicizing Renaissance and a flamboyant Gothic style of architecture.63 Directly over the head of Danaë lies a domed circular building, whose geometrical perfection may be an allusion to the sanctity of the heroine and resembles both the traditional round temple of Je rusalem in Flemish paintings as well as the portal of Paradise on the exterior left wing of the Malvagna Triptych by Gossaert. If, as suggested by Herzog, Gossaert adapted the virginal rounded chamber of Danaë from the classical forms — Ionic columns on high dados in a round shape - of the Roman Temple of Vesta, then he clearly intended to match her surroundings to her chaste character, in emulation of the fabled vestal virgins. Should any of the more salacious viewers be stirred to lustful thoughts by the bared breasts of Danaë, then they are no better than lustful Jupiter, god of the pagans with all of the moral shortcomings afforded by Roman anthropomorphism. Such viewers betray the digni fied, moralized Christian message of modesty and humanity inherent in the preternatural beauty of both the figure and the architecture of the Gossaert Danaë. Once more Gossaert walks a precarious tightrope be tween an overt erotic appeal and a transcendent canon of beauty as the embodiment of a moral ideal. Religiously sanctioned figures, such as the Madonna (or her mythical type in Danaë), can be at once human, and thus physically intimate, yet beyond fleshly sinfulness. Lesser beings, however powerful or beautiful, however mythical or heroic, are never theless subject to conscupiscence and temptation to luxury, usually in the form of women or Venus herself. For mythic figures like Adam or Her cules such indulgence in luxury will eventually spell their downfall. With the typological significance of his 1527 Danaë, Gossaert equates the mythic maiden with the Virgin of Christianity. In the process, he utilizes both physical beauty and architectural classicism, based on the same It alianate canons, for Madonna pictures as well. The model of Dürer in the particular and of Italianism in general finds a parallel in the religious works of the artist's own signature, where the Latinized 'Malbodius' 20 mi00 34 Hendrik Goltyius, Danaë, 1603. Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</page><page sequence="21">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands replaces 'Gossaert'. This development is well summarized by the contrast between Gossaert's Vienna St. L·uke Drawing the Virgin (fig. 35) and the earlier Prague St. Duke (fig. 36).6A Krönig has emphasized the degree to which Gossaert's elaborate architectural spaces and decorations in both pictures attests to his ambitions to be thought of as an accomplished and learned artist.65 The later, Vienna St. Luke introduces a variant on the basic theme: that is, not Luke drawing the Madonna and Child from life, like Van der Weyden's traditional image from Brussels (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts), but rather the appearance of the holy figures as a vision, surrounded by a glowing cloud and accompanied by angelic attendants. This presentation clearly separates the realm of the holy figures from the level of existence of even a saint, such as Luke. The saint kneels in prayer behind a prie-dieu in the manner of Jan van Eyck's Chancellor Rolin; his shoes are removed to denote holy ground, as in the instance of Moses before the burning bush (Luke's shoes are also removed in the Prague panel).66 The distance of sanctity between the visionary holy figures and the saint is further underscored by the presence of an angel guiding the 35 Jan Gossaert, St. Luke Drawing hand of the artist as he works.

Gossaert's fully Italianate forms convey the same message as do these motifs. The Virgin and Child are now emphatically super-natural in their muscular fulness and ivory lustre of their flesh. Even the supporting cast of putti (who carry a crown of heaven above the simple linen cap of the Virgin) are paragons of cuteness. The closest visual source again seems to be Dürer, whose otherworldly Virgin on a Crescent with Crown of Stars (1511; Β 32) presents analogous round, firm bodies hovering before a glowing aureole. Gossaert, however, has exaggerated the fulness of both figures, whose physical perfection is the metaphor of their spiritual per fection in the same fashion as Michelangelo's nude religious figures con vey an ideal through their beauty.68 Much the same suggestion of otherworldliness and perfection emerges from the Renaissance vocabulary of architecture and ornament in the Vienna St. Luke. The rounded arches of the arcade and the surfaces of the pilasters are crammed with classical relief ornament: medallions with profile portraits, urns, figures (satyrs, tritons, putti, etc.), and scroll work.69 In short, the setting is Italianizing, consistent, and up-to-date, based on the latest fashions in Rome of revived 'grotesque' ornament, especially from the Golden House of Nero.70 Despite the coordination of its parts, the architecture once again perfectly supports the foreground figures, each of whom stands before his own arched opening. On the side of St. Luke sits a round aedicula under the arch with a sculpted figure of Moses on top. Combined with the classical ornament, Moses and his tablets of the law represent the two realms that gave way to the triumphant Christian faith, represented by Luke's vision. Both the pagan world of Rome and the Old Testament era of law are subsumed within this space, under grace, where we sense a blend of both palace and tem ple, akin to the Renaissance foreground setting and the Gothic back ground space, respectively, in the Prague panel. Like the vision vouch safed to the Emperor Augustus by the Tiburtine sibyl, St. Luke views an epiphany of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven in a setting that is at once richly exotic and fully classicistic.71 With this Vienna St. Luke, Gossaert proclaims his new aesthetic vo cabulary, derived from both Dürer and Italy, as the appropriate expres sion of the perfection of the Madonna and Child. He pursues this linkage of style and subject for the holy figures in most of the mature religious works of his career, eliminating the references to Flemish pictorial tradi tions or Gothic architectural spaces in favor of the new classicism. For example, the small 1527 Madonna and Child in Munich (fig. 37) presents a dynamically powerful young Christ akin to the classical Hercules.72 Here, the trampling of the serpent of evil by the infant Christ is referred to in the inscription on the back of the throne, derived from Genesis (3, 15): 'Mulieris semen IHS serpentis caput contrivit', a variant of the Vul gate, where a seed, i.e. Christ, will crush the head of a serpent. This precocious victory over the serpent of evil draws upon the classical myth 22</page><page sequence="23">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands Institute. 37 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child, 1527. Munich, Alte Vinakothek. of Hercules as a baby, strangling the life-threatening snakes in his crib. 38 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Gossaert's exceptionally muscular nude Munich Christ draws visual as Child in Glory, Chicago, Art well as moral inspiration from the model of power and beauty of Her cules (A decade and a half earlier in the Prague St. Luke he had expressed much the same analogy through the presence of classical sculptures - of Hercules, of the owl of Minerva, and of the eagle of Jupiter — behind his traditional Rogierian figures of Madonna and Child). In all likelihood, the source for both the squirming Child and the impassive, seated Ma donna (cf. especially her face) was the nearest authentic, Italian Renais sance classic: the Bruges Madonna by Michelangelo (1503), a work surely known to Gossaert. Gossaert has also used the rounded-arch shape of the Munich panel in order to create a classicizing throne niche, reinforced by the biblical inscription. The thickness of Mary's drapery as well as of the molding profile of the niche creates a heightened suggestion of am plitude and importance for the figures akin to Christ's heroic proportions and the model of Michelangelo. If Gossaert introduces Italianate architecture into a context of archaizing, traditional Flemish figures in the Prague St. huke, he also mingles his earliest Italianate, heroic figures within a Rogierian context of a devo tional diptych against a monochrome background in his 1517 Madonna of Jean Carondelet (Paris, Louvre).73 At first, it may seem paradoxical that the Child in the Carondelet diptych offers the athletic, muscular body 23 37 jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child, 1527. Munich, Alte Vinakothek. 38 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child in Glory, Chicago, Art Institute.</page><page sequence="24">SILVER that was to become the rule for Gossaert's religious works in a panel clearly intended to evoke comparison with fifteenth century precedents, made for noblemen like Carondelet who served the Burgundian court of Philip the Fair and Charles the Fifth. In addition to the full-bodied Child, the fleshy, full face of the Madonna can be seen to be another derivation from Diirer, specifically from the 1513 engraving, Madonna by the Tree (B 35).75 Our apparent paradox disappears, however, when seen within the experimental context of other Gossaert religious paintings of the teens. Whereas the Prague St. Luke presents traditional Flemish figures within a Renaissance architectural setting, the Carondelet Diptych, conversely, shows Italianate figures, derived from Diirer, within an archaic Flemish frame and format, derived from Van der Weyden. The novel forms of these figures then become the objective correlative of their otherworld liness and sanctity and distinguish them from ordinary mortals, like Ca rondelet (a point underscored for the donor by the broken skull alongside his own heraldic arms on the reverse of the panels). For the mature Gossaert around a decade later, this same supernatural beauty, in the forms of Christ's precocious muscularity and Mary's smooth, rounded fulness, remained the principal means to convey holi ness. Nowhere is this Italianate canon more transcendent than in his Chicago Madonna and Child in Glory (fig. 38), a work seemingly extracted from the Vienna St. Luke yet continuing the devotional diptych format of the Carondelet Diptych (although the pendant donor panel still has not been traced). In this instance, the glowing nimbus and solar rays serve to identify the Madonna as the Apocalyptic woman in the sun, a favorite visual object of prayer by donors, because it was an 'indulgenced' image, conveying remission of years in Purgatory for specific prayers said before it.76 Mary's preternatural beauty, with a patently otherworldly ivory whiteness of skin, contrasts with earthly reality, just as in the Vienna St. Luke, for the Christ Child reaches out of the frame to an obviously contrasting site of the worldly donor. In such an ensemble, the contrast between parts could not have been greater, and the direct access to the holy figures in the Carondelet Diptych has been utterly broken. Like most of the mature Gossaert religious panels, the Chicago Madonna in Glory is undated. Fortunately, among the rare prints by Gossaert comes a dated engraving, the 1522 Virgin and Child beneath a Tree (fig. 39), a favorite subject of Dürer, that establishes a forceful benchmark for Gos saert's works in an Italianizing idiom.77 This theme is an explicit New Testament fulfilment of the Fall of Man, as Christ clasps an apple and tenderly kisses the Madonna's lips. For purposes of dating, this 1522 print furnishes a terminus ad quern for the Vienna St. Luke and the Chicago Madonna in Glory, where the same fleshy Virgin with long, flowing hair under a linen cap complements a curly-haired, muscle-bound Child, nes tled within densely clustered drapery folds of sleeves and swaddling cloth. Slightly earlier, if we may judge by its more unsure and experimental burin technique, is Gossaert's engraving, the Madonna with the Cloth (fig. 24</page><page sequence="25">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands 39 Jan Gossaert, Virgin and Child 40).18 Gossaert has given these Italianate figures an energetic physical beneath a Tree, 1522. engraving. interaction, centered around Christ's playful sporting with the Virgin's veil. Thus far, no specific iconography for this motif has been identified, CV tl"" G°SSaert' Madonna mth the although in this engraving the Child appears to be seeking the breast (Mary, in turn, offers Christ an orb, which in visual shape and proximity echoes the rounded swell of her breasts).79 The motif of Christ tugging at the veil of the Virgin appears in Raphael's Madonna di Foligno (ca. 1511/12), available to Gossaert through a Marcantonio engraving (ca. 1515/16).80 Gossaert's print uses Mary's mantle rather than her veil; how ever, his later, often-copied painting, the Madonna with the Veil, stands closer to Marcantonio in showing Christ enfolding Himself within the Virgin's ample drapery.81 In the painting, the muscular, bent torso and upraised arm and extended legs of Christ recall the ignudi of the Sistine Ceiling (such as the figures around the Creation of Eve or, especially, the Separation of Earth and Waters).82 Of course, Gossaert would have had to depend on copies after Michelangelo rather than direct contact with the original, since these portions of the Sistine Ceiling were among the very last to have been completed. An alternative source might have been the Mars, Venus, and Cupid engraving of Marcantonio (fig. 25), allegedly based on a Michelangelo drawing, and already seen above as a possible model for Gossaert's Adam and Eve and mythological subjects. 25 39 Jan Gossaert, Virgin and Child beneath a Tree, 1522. engraving. 40 Jan Gossaert, Madonna with the Cloth, engraving.</page><page sequence="26">with the Veil, The Hague, Mauritshuis. SILVER In a number of Gossaert religious pictures, an explicit eroticism links the Madonna and Child, as in the 1522 engraving of the Virgin and Child beneath a Tree (fig. 39). Perhaps the most direct of these eroticized pictures is the Prado Madonna and Child in a Niche (fig. 43) Ρ Once more, the holy figures are ivory white and preternaturally beautiful. In addition, they are located in a fully classical niche. Christ holds an apple in one hand, and He stands erect in the lap of the Virgin, reaching behind her head as He clings cheek-to-cheek to plant a tender kiss. Mary, in turn, re sponds by clasping Christ's head an holding Him close. Her breast re mains exposed, although this does not appear to be an occasion of nurs ing (and the sturdy Child looks a bit old to be nursing still). That such amorous overtones were consciously intended by Gossaert is evident from several related compositions besides the 1522 engraving: a signed panel in Münster (fig. 45), where Christ clings lovingly to His mother's 41 Jan Gossaert (copy), Madonna exposed breast; a Berlin-Dahlem panel (fig. 44), with a draped Christ alongside the Virgin's proffered breast; and a lost (?) painting, known from copies, showing Christ clasping Mary's breast and gazing lovingly into her eyes as he clambers upward, while the two cling tightly to one another.84 In most cases, these paintings make explicit reference via the presence of a prominent apple to Original Sin and to mankind's downfall through such eroticism. Precisely this juxtaposition of Christ and Mary as the 'new' Adam and Eve determines the meaning of this eroticized image. The Berlin panel by Gossaert explicitly declares Christ to be both God and man, verus deus et homo, as it underscores the paradox of the Madonna, 'chaste mother and Virgin' (casta mater et virgo). Thus, the inscription confirms that remarkable combination of the human and the divine, the real and the ideal, which Gossaert's Italianizing physical beauty brings into view. Recently, Leo Steinberg has considered the sexuality of Christ and has re-established the importance during the Renaissance of the human as pects of Christ, including his sexuality: ^with {heCloth^Brusseh^Muse'es Because Renaissance culture not only advanced an incarnational theology (as the Greek Royaux Church had also done) but evolved representational modes adequate to its expression, we may take Renaissance art to be the first and last phase of Christian art that can claim full Christian orthodoxy. Renaissance art harnassed the theological impulse and devel oped the requisite stylistic means to attest the utter carnality of God's humanation in Christ. It became the first Christian art in a thousand years to confront the Incarnation entire, the upper and lower body together, not excluding even the body's sexual com ponent.85 With this background in mind, we can actually discover details, such as the extraordinary fact that the Berlin panel features the Christ Child with a distinctly visible erection! Christ's body, however, and by extension both His nakedness and His eroticism with the Virgin, was understood by definition to be free from the taint of sin pertaining to ordinary man kind in the wake of Original Sin. Yet it was equally important to assert the Incarnation, that is the adoption by Christ of human form and flesh. Steinberg furnishes a number of examples of the inverse theme of Christ 26 41 Jan Gossaert (copy), Madonna with the Veil, The Hague, Mauritshuis. 42 Jan Gossaert (copy), Madonna with the Cloth, Brussels, Musées Royaux.</page><page sequence="27">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands 43 Jatt Gossaert, Madonna and Child in α Niche, Madrid, Prado. fondling Mary, namely Mary fondling the Child or else displaying or protecting his genitalia.86 Indeed, the very nature of such unsettling eroti cism paradoxically underscores both Christ's human nature ('complete in all the parts of a man', according to Augustine's City of God, XXII, 18) and His exemption from sinful human nature. Steinberg rightfully calls attention to the 'defining traits of the human condition' in the com bination of nursing and sexuality associated with the Virgin's breast (so basic to Gossaert's religious panels).87 Thus, the overtly sexual and ideal images of Gossaert's fully physical holy figures can at once show their human and lifelike behavior through their actions yet also convey their otherworldliness through their beauty. Indeed, the intimate bond be tween Madonna and Child has both a literal and a mystical meaning: 27 I V / 43 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child in α Niche, Madrid, Prado.</page><page sequence="28">SILVER 44 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Passing between Christ and the Virgin, the gesture becomes an all-purpose sign for the Child, Berlin-Dahlem, Staatliche love bond between Christ and Mary-Ecclesia, between Christ and the soul, the Logos Museen. and human nature.88 Herein lies the essential mystery of the holy figures as well as their vital 45 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child, Miinster, Westfdlisches Landesmuseum. fink to the First Parents, Adam and Eve. On the one hand, both pairs are created in God's image, filled with the beauty and physical power that is the sign of their exalted importance. The difference between them lies in the holiness of the New Adam and Eve, Christ and Mary, who can at once participate in human passions and fleshliness yet still can transcend the accompanying weaknesses that were the undoing of Adam and Eve. Gossaert seems to have understood and to have exploited this very paradox. He shows us active and amorous holy figures, usually bearing the apple that is the sign of Original Sin, yet their very prurience is contradicted by their sacral identities. The gulf between sinful, mortal mankind and both Christ and the Virgin is exemplified by the fact that we fallen viewers of such images cannot avoid our own culpable associ ations of such interactions with erotic indulgence. Yet by definition, these holy figures transcend such fallibility, which is common to all other humans, including Adam and Eve and the gods of ancient myths. They stand distinct from fallen mankind just as surely as the Man of Sorrows in Gossaert's print (fig. 11) remains separate in His beauty from the grotesque ugliness of his tormentors. 28 44 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child, Berlin-Dahlem, Staatliche Museen. 9L. tV 45 Jan Gossaert, Madonna and Child, Munster, Westfdlisches Candesmuseum.</page><page sequence="29">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands IV. Style and Meaning What, then, does this Gossaert representation by means of Italianate forms tell us about his self-conscious utilization of classical nudes and architectural spaces? Derived from both first-hand experience of antiquity and the Renaissance in Rome (later supplemented by Italian prints, es pecially by Marcantonio) as well as from assimilation of the Northern creations of Dürer and de' Barbari, virtually all of Gossaert's Italianism appeared in the wake of his direct contact with the Italian expatriot, de' Barbari, at Souburg. Thus, we can assume that such assimilation of a Renaissance aesthetic was at once essential and comprehending. We must remember, in assessing the Italian trip and the Italianizing forms of Gossaert, how utterly 'foreign' and exotic such Roman contacts must have appeared in the Netherlands prior to the advent of a Dutch pope, Adrian VI (1522—23). Possibly, Gossaert was even one of the first wit nesses of the uncompleted Sistine Ceiling by Michelangelo; certainly, he seems to have held a deep interest in Michelangelo's model of ideal, heroic, muscular male nudes, even if he derived them second-hand from copies or prints. Like Michelangelo, Gossaert made the human figure the center of his art, and he focused on the Fall of Man theme with particular attention to its sensual aspects in the manner of the Sistine Ceiling fresco of the same subject. That man as observer can misjudge such beauty or tarnish it with his own carnality was well-known to Michelangelo him self: This Idea (of beauty) lifts my eyes to those high visions which I set myself to paint and carve here below. If men of rash and foolish judgment drag sense-ward (al sense) the beauty which moves and transports every right intelligence to Heaven, it is because weak and wavering eyes, and even eyes fixed steadily on things above, cannot pass from the mortal to the divine, for without grace it is a vain thought that one may rise thither.89 Michelangelo even went on late in his career to explore this contrast between a sensual and an intellectual attraction to beauty in his pendant 46 Jan Gossaert (copy), Christ in drawings for Tommaso Cavalieri: the Punishment of Tityus and the Rape Distress, Antwerp, Koninklijk 0j Ganymede.90 And if Michelangelo was uncomfortable with the un bridgeable gap between physical beauty and its transcendent ideal, how much more so would be the Northerner, Gossaert, inheritor of tradi tional Christian, ascetic fears of physical passion going back to Original Sin. Gossaert's native land lacked the local traditions of antique remains and revivals prior to his own trip to Rome. Of course, it was precisely this combination of the imported and foreign forms of the Renaissance along with a sense of the carnal, implicit in the physical, that informed Gossaert's beautiful and massive, yet unbalanced or discomfited heroic figures: Adam, Hercules, or Venus. Their huge bodies are both 'heavy and mortal' — even the perfect but broken body of the Man of Sorrows in Gossaert's etching (fig. 12) and paintings (fig. 46) shares these qualities, as it stands above grotesque tormentors.91 As previously discussed at length in this Jaarboek, Gossaert's colleague, Lucas van Leyden, shared much of this same ambivalence toward Ital 29 46 jan Gossaert (copy), Christ in Distress, Antwerp, Koninklijk Museum.</page><page sequence="30">SILVER ianate forms in his own late graphic works.92 Van Mander informs us that Gossaert and Lucas met and travelled together when Lucas was around 33 years old, some six years before his death (in 1533), i.e. in 1526—27.93 Lucas's art corroborates the influence of Gossaert from as early as 1524, although Gossaert's prints may well have preceded their direct personal contact.94 A particularly striking example is the massive figural canon and leaning postures of Lucas's Fall of Man drawing (ca. 1528; Hamburg), where even the curly hair and fuzzy beard of Adam are anomalies in Lucas's oeuvre but staples of Gossaert.95 We have already seen how Lucas's mythology of Mars, Venus, and Cupid (fig. 30) emulated Gossaert's own suspicion of sensuality through the forms of beautiful, yet adulterous figures. Like Gossaert, Lucas utilized Dürer prints and, later, Italian prints as veritable dictionaries of classicizing figures and poses. He willingly incorporated heroic nudes into images of the adult Christ, as in the impressive chalk Kesurrection, ca. 1530, recently acquired by the Rijksmuseum, or the immortal souls of ordinary mankind in the huge 1526—27 Leyden Last Judgment Triptych.96 That Lucas in his Leyden altarpiece can employ the same classicizing vocabulary for both the saved souls and the damned indicates that for him these strong and beautiful nudes denote spiritual importance but not a pure spiritual sanctity. Their dignity and majesty, like that of the First Parents, can be tainted by Original Sin, a favorite theme for Lucas as well as Gossaert.97 Indeed, the physical fulness of Lucas's figures implies, like Gossaert's, their greater potential for sexuality and sinfulness, unless they are exempted by religious grace. Unlike Lucas, however, Gossaert specifically developed fully Italianate surroundings for his large, heroic nude figures. Here, the essential strangeness of the imported architectural forms serves to distance such depicted worlds from both the everyday world of the viewer and the heritage of Flemish paintings. Thus, whether we take the classicizing niche of the Prado Madonna and Child in a Niche (fig. 43) to be part of a temple or a palace, it still offers a pointedly 'otherworldly' space to a Flemish viewer. Even a presumed temple precinct, such as the Vienna St. Luke, hovers, like its holy principals, between an earthly and a heavenly location. In the mythologies, archeologically informed use of antique models combines with the artifice of appropriate classical orders to accord with the subjects depicted and to reinforce their own ideality. Throughout this essay, we have argued by implication, derived from the unequivocal importance of these religious and mythic figures themselves, that Gossaert's physical nudes and architectural forms were intended to provide an 'elevated' style, especially in contrast to the prevailing natu ralism of the earlier Netherlandish heritage. This is an argument about the style itself rather than the cultural matrix or specific patrons and commissions underlying Gossaert's artistic directions. In particular, the role of Philip of Burgundy, as discussed by Sterk, could be supplemented by considerations of the broader Dutch and Flemish support for Italian ate forms, e.g. by the House of Nassau-Breda, later so supportive of Jan 30</page><page sequence="31">Jan Gossaert and the Kenaissance Nude in the Netherlands van Scorel, or by Margaret of Austria in Mechelen. Yet even within the arena of style itself, our analysis must remain indi rect. Neither Gossaert nor his predecessors nor his contemporaries in the Netherlands ever expressed a visual theory akin to that developed in Italy.98 Even in contemporary Germany only a few scattered lines from Dürer survive to suggest an analogue to Gossaert. We shall have to depend upon them in the absence of better evidence to sketch for Gos saert a rhetorical theory of art production that encompasses the 'high style' of such Italianizing. Humanist eulogists of Dürer utilized the parallel of rhetorical address to praise the painter for his elevated style.99 Following the model of rhetoric established by Cicero and Quintilian, these learned German authors dis tinguish between literary modes of discourse: high, medium, and low. Specifically, Philip Melanchthon in his treatise on rhetoric, Elementa rhet orices (1531), compares the art of painters Dürer, Matthias (Grünewald), and Lucas Cranach to these three levels of discourse, and he puts Dürer's art at the summit: It is also very useful, in forming a judgment, to distinguish the various styles of speaking, for the variation in personal talents has given rise, in speaking as in many other arts, to various types of works. And yet certain gradations, so to speak, have been distinguished, within which these types are contained: there is the Simple style, and its opposite the Grand... These differences may be readily discerned in paintings. For example, Dürer painted everything in the Grand manner, variegated with innumerable lines ...10° In similar fashion, Joachim Camerarius's preface to the Latin translation (1532) of Dürer's Four Books of Human Proportion extols the artist for the grandeur of his works: Albrecht, therefore, we most justly admire as an earnest guardian of piety and modesty, and as one who showed, by the grandness of his pictures, that he was conscious of his own powers.101 Elevated subjects, therefore, call for elevated style (granditate pictuarum), and the model of Dürer must have exemplified the grand manner for Gossaert and other artists of his day.102 Camerarius even credits Dürer with personal handsomeness akin to his depicted figures: 'Nature be stowed on him a body remarkable in build and stature and worthy of the noble mind it contained'.103 Dürer's own words underscore his adoption of this humanist viewpoint, namely that the Renaissance canon of beauty is the only fit idiom for rendering the most serious (usually, the holiest) of subjects: Just as they (Greek and Roman artists) attributed the most beautiful human shape to their false god, Apollo, so will we use the same proportions for Christ Our Lord, who was the most beautiful man in the universe. And just as they employed Venus as the most beautiful woman, so will we chastely present the same lovely figure as the most pure Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. Hercules will we transform into Samson, and with all others we will do likewise.104 31</page><page sequence="32">Dürer also states in his theoretical treatise his opinions concerning beau ty: 'True artists perceive at once which work is a powerful one, and therefrom arises a great love in the mind of him that understands'.105 Fitting appropriate forms to the level of a subject accords with a classical doctrine, derived from Horace (Ars poëtica, esp. 11. 153-78): decorum.106 According to this concept, each figure should receive the appropriate physique, gesture, and expression. For the mature Gossaert, presumably an appropriate classical space was also de rigeur for such elevated figural subjects. It should come as little surprise that Gossaert's religious figures are en visioned as ideal types and an elevated style, but the Italianizing forms may still need justification for a Northern painter. In the absence of documentation, we can point to a turn toward Italy in one other realm of visual production of the early sixteenth century: typography. For ex ample, in France Geoffrey Tory (1480—1533) developed a new humanist type on the Italian model to replace the gothic font of fifteenth-century French books.107 His 1529 Champfleury has a full title that outlines this new program: Champfleury, in which is contained the art and science of the proper and true proportion of Attic Letters, which one also calls Antique Letters or vulgarly Roman Letters, pro portioned according to the human body and face. Diirer himself had included in his 1525 treatise on geometry a portion at the end of Book Three on the geometrical construction of Roman letters.108 Such 'humanistic' type was intended to be printed for Latin classics, much as Gossaert's mythologies required a classicizing figural type. Indeed this contrast between Latin and the vernacular makes vivid the distinction between thematic material for printers of the Netherlands. It was chiefly for Erasmus and the other authors of classical Latin works that printers in the Netherlands employed Roman letters, even as they continued to publish Dutch texts in Black Letter type for several dec ades.109 Erasmus specifically declared his preference for Roman letters, based on a 'handwriting that is elegant, clear, and distinct representing Latin words by Latin elements'.110 Thus, the importation of Roman and italic types by printers in the North was tied to humanists' projects, especially the editing of Latin classics, and of the most serious and ele vated books, eventually including ecclesiastical texts as well. This visual distinction in type corresponds exactly to the importation and the 'rhe torical' elevation of a 'classical' style by Gossaert in his nudes and set tings. Despite the fallibility of his heroic nudes, who after all remain subject to the Christian view of Original Sin, Gossaert's figures conform fully to this notion, derived from both Diirer and Renaissance Italy (especially Michelangelo), of a visual 'high style' for epic religious and mythic sub jects. The long-term influence of his viewpoint led succeeding genera tions of artists from the Netherlands on an obligatory trip to Rome. One of them, Maerten van Heemskerck, spent a full three years in Rome, 32</page><page sequence="33">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands beginning in the year of Gossaert's death (1532). A measure of the in fluence and success of Gossaert's new formulations can be gauged by the remarks that Heemskerck allegedly made upon his return to his native Haarlem from that visit to Rome. Van Mander reports that Heemskerck was said to declare of his entire output of previous works (already Ital ianizing) in Haarlem, 'My son, at that time I knew not what I was doing'.111 Notes A.

This assimilation of a sexual gesture to religious imagery is analogous to the 'sanctification' of the erotic 'chin chuck' gesture in Madonna images (see Steinberg, n. 81, as well as his remarks on the Madonna and Child, 348-9).

A recent cleaning of the Chrysler Madonna and Child (Norfolk), a little-known late painting by Gossaert (and shop?), revealed a similar topknot hairdo for the Virgin, who exchanges and apple with the left hand of Christ (I am grateful to Thomas Sokolowski of the Chrysler Museum for informing me of this discovery). The Berlin half-length Madonna and Child shows a similar knot but in her linen head-covering rather than her hair. The muscular Chrysler Christ Child also toys with the veil of the Madonna.

Hartt, 'The Evidence for the Scaffolding of the Sistine Ceiling', Art History 5 (1982), 273-86. The fact that Adam reaches for the tree in Michelangelo's Sistine Fall of Man has been explained by E. G. Dotson as deriving from Augustine's texts comparing the Tree of Life to the cross as a source of redemption: 'God sent Adam out of Paradise lest he stretch out his hand to the Tree of Life and live eternally ...' (E. G. Dotson, 'An Augustinian Interpretation of Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling', Art Bul letin 61 (1979), 242, n. 105. Shoemaker, op. cit. (note 8), 188, no. 64; 146-7, no. 43. Schwarz op. cit.

Thus, despite the embarrassing neatness of such an evolutionary step-by-step development, Gossaert does seem to have added an increasing sense of movement and eroticism to his depictions of this subject from Lugano to Grunewald.

(note 3), 166) would identify the painter with the sinful First Parent. This portrait identification appears most plausible in the Providence drawing, the most overtly carnal of all Gossaert renditions of the Fall. Other persuasive instances are the East Berlin and Schloss Grunewald paintings, when compared to Wierix's engraved portrait and the alleged self-portrait in the Currier Gallery (Manchester, Ν. H.). 34 M. Summers, trans., The Malleus Maleficarum of Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger (London 1928), esp. 41-47: 'For though the devil tempted Eve to sin yet Eve seduced Adam. And as the sin of Eve would not have brought death to our soul and body unless the sin had afterwards passed on to Adam, to which he was tempted by Eve, not by the devil, therefore she is more bitter than death.' (47) Augustine, following Paul, also sanctions such a view of women by alleging that Satan 'first tried his deceit upon the woman, making his assault upon the weaker part of that human alliance ...' (City of God xiv, 11; also I Tim. 2, 14). Lust is seen as the 'penal consequence of sin' (xiv, 12). 35 See above, note 5. 36 S.

Perhaps the closest sources, allied to the Dtirer connection, are the two Jacopo de' Barbari engravings of Mars and Venus (B 20) and Victory and Fame (B. 23), suggested by Von der Osten (For all references, Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 133-34). 57 Levenson op. cit.

Klein, St. Lukas als Maler der Maria, Hamburg 1933, 69, 81-83. De Jongh, 52-53, also points out that the Virgin appears as a vision above the burning bush in Nicolas Froment's 1476 altarpiece (Aix-en-Provence, Saint-Sauveur); conversely, the figure of Moses appears above the aedicula in Gossaert's Vienna St. Luke. 67 I. Lavin, 'Addenda to "Divine Inspiration" ', Art Bulletin 56 (1974), 590-91. 68 Summers, op. cit. (note 30), 186-202, 285-96. 69 According to C. Aschenheim, Der italienische Einfluss in der vlamischen Malerei der Frühr enaissance, Strassburg 1910, 22-24, argues that the classical ornament on the middle pilaster of the Vienna St. Luke derives from direct contact with Italian painting in Rome, specifically from Filippino Lippi's Caraffa Chapel in Santa Maria sopra Mi nerva, Rome. Other sources include Italian decorative prints; see Oberhuber, op. cit. (note 9), 260-62 (no. 98), 270-80 (nos. 101-13), 478-85 (nos. 172-75). According to Sterk, op. cit. (note 36), 147-48, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (Venice 1499) also pro vided models through its woodcuts for both the pilaster and the decorated arches; roundels and medallions derive from Roman coins. 70 N. Dacos, La De'couverte de la Domus aurea et la formation des grotesques a la Renaissance, London/Leyden 1969. 71 The change in Gossaert's style of architecture can be measured by comparing the Vienna St. Luke with the signed Berlin drawing of Augustine and the Tiburtine Sibyl (Folie, op. cit. (note 5), 80-81, 88, no. 5; Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 239—40, no. 44). There a wealth of hybrid architecture, largely ogive flamboyant Gothic with decor ations of scrollwork, putti, and shields, forms a fantastic setting for the historical scene. The vision appears in clouds at the top center above a lacy spire reminiscent of the Brussels town hail. In general, both the architecture and its decoration as well as the fluttering, abundant draperies of emperor and sibyl create a fairytale atmosphere for the narrative that is a 'Gothic' version of the classicizing abundance of the Vienna St.Luke. One can also compare this drawing (not necessarily to be date4 before the trip by Gossaert to Rome, although its signature reads ΊΕΝΝΙ{Ν} ANWER'} to the St. Catherine page of the Grimani Breviary with a 'COSAR' signature and similar hybrid architecture (fo. 106). 72 De eeuw van Bruegel (note 40), 113, no. 115; for the Prague St. Luke references, see above, note 65, esp. De Jongh, 58-61. The figure of Hercules, as the quintessential 37</page><page sequence="38">SILVER 74 classical hero and martyr, was often typologically associated with the virtue of for titude as well as the figure of Christ in Christian thought (M. Simon, Hercule et le Christianisme, Paris 1955). For this 1527 panel, Gibson, op. cit. (note 21), 298, n. 22, has argued that Gossaert's muscular and athletic Christ Child is analogous to the infant Hercules who strangled serpents in his crib; see also M.-R. Jung, Hercule dans la littérature fran^aise du XVle siècle, Geneva 1966, 105-25. 73 Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 98-104, no. 11. The chief comparisons are to the portraits by Rogier van der Weyden, recently sur veyed by L. Campbell, 'The Portrait Art in the Work of van der Weyden', Kogier van der Weyden - Rogier de la Pasture, exh. cat. Brussels 1979, 56-67; also Ε. Panofsky, Early Netherlandish Painting, Cambridge, Mass., 1953, 289-98, esp. 294—96. A recent examination of Gossaert's revival of the Rogierian forms of portraiture, probably in conjunction with the request of a nobleman like Carondelet in emulation of his courtly predecessors, is L. Silver, 'The "Gothic" Gossaert' (in press). Gibson, op. cit. (note 21), 298, n. 28, asserts that 'the Madonna of jean Carondelet shows no trace of Dürer influence', even though he sees the influence of Diirer's 1512 painting, the Madonna and Child with a Pear (Vienna) on later Gossaert Madonna images (290-92). For this indulgenced image, S. Ringbom, 'Maria in Sole and the Virgin of the Rosary', JWCI 25 (1962), 326-30; Ringbom, Icon to Narrative, Abo 1965, 26-27. On the as sociations of this image of the Virgin in the Sun with the Immaculate Conception, see M. Levi d'Ancona, The Iconography of the Immaculate Conception in the Middle Ages and the Early Renaissance, New York 1957, esp. 20-28. Jacobowitz-Stepanek, op. cit. (note 24), 290, no. 122; Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 353-54, no. 72. The theme of the holy figures beneath a tree and the use of a tablet with the artist's signature are both anticipated by Dürer engravings (1511, 1513; Β 35, 41). Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 349-50, no. 71. Both the depth of the engraving lines and their coordination of shadows and lights are clearly more assured in the 1522 print. In a very general way, the enfolding mantle of the Madonna can be associated with the late medieval tradition of the sheltering Virgin, the Madonna Misericordia, subject of countless paintings and sculptures. See recently M. Baxandall, The Eimewood Sculp tors of Renaissance Germany, New Haven 1980, 165-6; the classic study is P. Perdrizet, Ea Vierge de Mise'ricorde, Paris 1908. Also see C. Belting-Ihm, Sub matris tutela. Unter suchungen %ur Vorgeschichte der Schut^mantelmadonna, Heidelberg 1976. According to the Meditations on the Eife of Christ, ed. I. Ragusa and R. Green, Princeton 1961, 33, the Virgin wrapped Christ in the veil from her head at the Nativity, anticipating the scene from the Passion (Ibidem, 333) where she covers the nudity of her dead son with her veil. Shoemaker, op. cit. (note 8), 114—19, no. 29. The more robust, Michelangelesque forms of the engraving are closer to Gossaert than the Raphael original. In Gossaert's image Christ gazes directly out at the viewer. Best version in The Hague, Mauritshuis: Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 81-82, no. 29; fine variant in Brussels, 89-90, no. 31. A related, later composition is known only from numerous copies (Friedlander, vol. 8, no. 38), emphasizing the veil of the Virgin. The 1508 Marcantonio engraving, based on a Michelangelo drawing, Mars, Venus, and Cupid (Shoemaker, op. cit. (note 8), 76-79, no. 13) could also have served as a visual model for Gossaert's Christ Child (as well as for the types of his female nudes; see above). Ultimately, both Michelangelo and Marcantonio offer variations and re constructions of the Torso Belvedere (W. S. Sheard, Antiquity in the Renaissance, exh. cat. Northampton, Mass., 1978, no. 56). Gossaert's 1509 departure from Rome presum ably precluded his direct experience of the ignudi of the Sistine Chapel ceiling; see above, note 19. Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 163-64, no. 25. Often dated ca. 1527 by comparison with the dated 1527 Munich Danaë, this picture was copied (from a Gossaert variant; Fried lander, vol. 8, no. 35a) by Hans Baldung in a dated work of 1530 (Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum; G. von der Osten, Hans Baldung Grien Gemalde und 38</page><page sequence="39">Jan Gossaert and the Renaissance Nude in the Netherlands Dokumente, Berlin 1982, 192-94, no. 68). The oblique glance of the Virgin out of the picture raises the question whether or not a pendant donor panel complemented the Prado image. Friedlander, vol. 8, nos. 34, 36, 40. The Berlin picture is inscribed 'Verus deus et homo, casta mater et virgo' (A true God and man, a pure mother and virgin). L. Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion, New York 1983, esp. 72. Steinberg, op. cit. (note 85), 23-24, 34-39, 72, 141-43, 150-54. Steinberg also glosses the erotic 'chin chuck' gesture between Madonna and Child (1-4,110-15) and nursing (as in the Prague St. Luke of Gossaert; 14—15): 'The image of the Maria lactans, popular since the mid-14th century, assured the believer that the God rooting at Mary's breast had become man indeed; and that she who sustained the Godman in his infirmity had gained infinite credit in heaven'. On Mary's covering of Christ's nakedness with her veil, see above, note 80. Steinberg, op. cit. (note 85), 14-15, 127-30. Steinberg op. cit. (note 85), 115. On Mary as the bride of Christ in Christian theology, see C. Purtle, The Marian Paintings of fan van Eyck, Princeton 1982, 37-39, 105-08, 115-22. Quoted (Frey, xciv) by A. Blunt, Artistic Theory in Italy 1450-1600, Oxford 1940, 69. Beauty stands opposed to the mondo iniquo e fello. Summers, op. cit. (note 30), 214-15, figs. 50-51. E. Panofsky, Studies in Icono/ogy, New York 1962, 213-18, figs. 158-59. The devouring of Tityus's liver lets the punishment fit the crime, for the liver was considered the seat of the physical passions in the Renaissance. For the print, Gossaert, 1965 (note 4), 365-66, no. 75; Jacobowitz-Stepanek, op. cit. (note 24), 291, no. 123. Field, op. cit. (note 4), 123, pointed out that Gossaert's con trasting figures are closely adapted from the 1511 frontispiece of Dürer's Large Wood cut Passion, while the pose of dismay, head on hand, derives from the title woodcut of the 1511 Small Woodcut Passion. The body type again was taken by Gossaert from Marcantonio's Mars, Venus, and Cupid engraving, with Mars reversed. The original painting is lost, but many of its copies bear the date 1527 (Friedlander, vol. 8, no. 14); a variant painting, Christ in Distress (Valencia, Colegio del Patriarca; Friedlander, vol. 8, no. 20) stares outward at the viewer while seated before a massive Renaissance column, attribute of fortitude in contrast to the stooped body and mournful coun tenance of Christ. There are several studies devoted to the theme of the Man of Sorrows and the related cognate of Christ in Distress (shown without the stigmata): G. von der Osten, Der Schmer^ensmann, Berlin 1935; idem, 'Christus in Elend', Real lexikon %ur deutschen Kunstgeschichte III (1954), cols. 644—58. A good recent discussion of the related narrative of the Mocking of Christ is J. Marrow, Passion Iconography in Northern European Art of the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance, Kortrijk 1979; and the Munich Grünewald Mocking is analyzed by H. C. Collinson, The Mystic Presence of Christ: Three Passion Panels by Mathis Gothard-Neithart, called Grünewald, unpublished Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1986 (I am grateful to Dr. Collinson for sharing his work with me).

Also for both print and paintings, Gibson, op. cit. (note 21), 292, tying the pose of the suffering Christ to Dürer's en graving of Melencolia I (1514) and correctly specifying the Gossaert subjects as Christ in Distress rather than the post-crucifixion Man of Sorrows.

The closest 39</page><page sequence="40">SILVER Gossaert comparison to Adam's twist and Eve's fleshiness by Lucas is the East Berlin painting, although the Hampton Court Adam and Eve still echo the frontality of the common Dürer model. 96 Silver-Smith, op. cit.

Filedt Kok, '"De Opstanding van Christus" getekend door Lucas van Leiden', Bul letin van het Rijksmuseum 31 (1983), 4-20. Lucas continues to use Dürer as his model in the Leyden altarpiece, particularly for figures such as the standing large female nude at the left foreground of his central panel, derived from works such as the Large Fortune engraving or the Eve from the 1510 Fall of Man of the Small Woodcut Passion. Lucas also utilized Marcantonio's multi-figured engravings for a variety of the Leyden figures and poses: the lunging and fleeing characters from the Massacre of the Innocents and the reclining or seated figures of the judgment of Paris. 97 Silver-Smith, op. cit. (note 2), 244—60. 98 A. Blunt, Artistic Theory in Italy 1450-1600, Oxford 1940; R. Lee, Ut Pictura Poesis, New York 1962, trace the development. 99 A fine overview of this doctrine in a later Northern context is T. Da C.
