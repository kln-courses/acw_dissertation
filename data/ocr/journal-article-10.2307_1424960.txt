Yet we cannot say that this view of architecture and its objects is wholly uncritical. Within its quasi-autonomous domain it is clearly a critical discipline which requires great sophistication, but the goal of its criticism is to stabilize pro- duction within a particular paradigm. Because the operative premises of such a discipline go largely unquestioned, the manifold complexity of objects in their involvement with the world is forsaken. This approach to the architectural object is predicated on its being the result of actions taken by a consciousness-cen- tered, authoritative subject, the classic Cartesian ego, the "I". The great instru- ment of the "I" is the "Eye," which, by vir- tue of its capacity to structure the visual field into foveal (central) and peripheral components, is the human receptor par excellence for knowing things at extreme separation from the body. The "I" and the "Eye" work in concert to hold the world at a distance and create the profound illu- sion of its passivity with respect to our interventions. It is curious that much contemporary architectural education, theory and pro- duction continues to seek legitimacy through this "I'"/Eye" synapse. Although it may indicate a nostalgia for when archi- tecture had more power in the affairs of the world, it appears also to be a paradox- ical, albeit figurative, return to the sup- posed "physics-envy" of earlier twentieth- century architecture; except now its terms are architecturally rather than scientifi- cally autonomous. But the formal, "classi- cal" physics of causality and certainty, which may have been venerated by some early moderns, was not really the physics of the twentieth century. This latter phys- ics of the elusive quantum is a tactile, one might even extend the metaphor to say erotic, science. Its discoveries, along with those in other fields, imply that objects come into being simultaneously with the discourse on them (Michel Foucault has examined this issue with respect to objects and the human sciences in The Archaeology of Knowledge), that our presence (as mind and body) in any situa- tion weaves us into it and it into us, and that the act of intervention in a situation actually alters that situation. These points have helped provoke a critique of the Cartesian conception of an ego-centered world composed of resolute subjects which operate on discrete objects. All of this has further had repercussions not only on what is considered to constitute any form of knowledge, but on how that knowledge is produced. Thus any attempt to know, understand or act in a given situ- ation is effectively a destabilization, a decentering of that situation's "objective- ness." In other words, the situation is thrown into crisis. Among other things this criticality or instability declares the obsolescence of searches for all new legi- timizing models for action, i.e., para- digms, which can supplant old ones. Human activity itself is therefore a critical process wherein each of us must, to para- phrase Jean-Francois Lyotard, "suspect the place from where we speak" and understand that our presence in any cir- cumstance, no matter how quiet, is not silent. Many think and feel that the human body in its full, ambiguous complexity and pro- found unsilence is a significant organ for the critical knowledge and understanding discussed above. Walter Benjamin in his essay of the 1930's, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction", seems to me to observe that the human body is perpetually becoming so involved in the workings of things. In this essay, which is primarily about film as an art form, he offers a vision of architecture quite different from the norms of his time or ours. The full implications of what Ben- jamin says I can only allude to briefly. He likens film to architecture because neither demands to be "appropriated" as an object of contemplation, i.e., "in terms of the attentive concentration of a tourist before a famous building," but in an unconscious, distractive, peripheral, bodily, "tactile" way. What I am trying to suggest here is far from the instrumentality latent in the con- ception of architecture as a device for making conscious the unconscious. Instead, I hope to have contributed mod- estly to a growing discourse on the archi- tectural object as something which is at once made and unmade by all our endeavors, as something which exists as much at the margins of our experience as at the center, as something noisily adrift evading always the silent snare of Rationalist theory. David H. Bell "There is no photograph of (the school at) Fagnano Olona that I love so much as the one of the children standing on the stair under the huge clock which is indicating both a particular time and also the time of childhood." -Aldo Rossi, A Scientific Autobiography This photograph is puzzling. Certainly the presence of people is unusual for an architectural photograph, but not puz- zling. Unquestionably it is carefully com- posed. The clock hands ephemerally embrace and caliper the entire scene. There is a precise, more permanent rela- tionship between this clock, the stairs and the two closed doors. However, in the world of this photograph there seems to be no immediate, forceful presence of the architectural object as something to be contemplated; certainly not in the sense that it conventionally appears in photo- graphs. There is a wall which holds, but cannot be said to circumscribe, the place. Because the photo is black and white, this wall could almost be the sky made surreal by the presence of the clock and doors. Two questions are posed here: What is the architectural object and can it be truly silent in the apparent sense of the Fag- nano Olona photograph? The architec- tural object, we all know, is not necessar- ily a material solid nor even its inverse, i.e., bounded space (both conditions are present at Fagnano Olona). It has some- thing to do with the complex interweaving of both matter and space. But this issue, although it forms part of the present dis- cussion's tacit framework, is not its pur- pose. A persistent notion of objects in much contemporary architecture and its theory is that they are entities which require or imply a center, are focal and capture and hold our conscious attention. In this sense, they are contemplative. The contemporary predilection for the production of photogenic architecture epitomizes this. This notion of the architectural object fundamentally purports it as something external to the perceiver and mediated to her or him through various devices of anthropomorphic and/or anthropometric similarity. Concomitant with this view is the normalization of architecture and architectural acts through the powerful conceptual devices of element, category, typology and the a priori imposition of values such as unity, continuity, hierar- Winter 1985 JAE 39/2 Reflection</page></plain_text>
