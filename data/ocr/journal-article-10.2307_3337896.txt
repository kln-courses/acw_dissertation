<plain_text><page sequence="1">M U SErs1E DAPPER New Directions for a Postcolonial Museum BENNETTA JULES-ROSETTE ~~O n a rainy afternoon in November 2001, I visited the new locale of the Musee Dapper at 35 rue Paul Valery in Paris. After considerable renovation, the museum had opened a year earlier with an inaugural show containing 150 pieces from several renowned European collections. Named after a seventeenth- century Dutch scholar and humanist who wrote about Africa, the museum boasts a history unique in the French art world. The private Fondation Olfert Dapper was organized in December 1983, spear- headed and financed by French indus- trialist Michel Leveau and his Antillian wife, Christiane Falgayrettes-Leveau. The couple share a passion for Africa and the preservation of sub-Saharan African arts, artifacts, and cultures. Their early work involved roundtables, lectures, confer- ences, and tours. The Dapper's exhibi- tion activities were launched in 1986 by two shows held at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, "Ouvertures sur l'art africain: This page: 1.

Cover of the museum's exhibition cata- logue Luba: Aux sources du Zaire, 1993. Bottom: 4. Cover of the exhibition catalogue Dogon, 1994. The museum has sponsored more than thirty exhibitions since its inception, often with com- panion catalogues. In its early years it focused exclusively on exceptional works of "classical" African art drawn from European collections. Les cabinets de curiosites au XVIIe siecle" and "Figures reliquaires dites Kota." In 1989 the Dapper inaugurated its first permanent space at 58 rue Victor Hugo with an exhibition on African kings and ancestors. Just a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the Musee Dapper was housed in a three-story classical villa sur- rounded by a tropical-style garden. This building now serves as the museum's administrative headquarters. A visit to an exhibition at the old Dapper was a must for any well-informed tourist, art histori- an, or student of African art in Paris. Its atmosphere was intimate, giving one the impression of a stylish mansion adorned with objects from the owner's personal collection, tastefully placed and creative- ly illuminated. The museum freed the artworks from the clutter of the usual ethnographic dis- play. Breaking with the tradition of Trocadero and Tervuren, it introduced contemporary gallery aesthetics and pre- sentation strategies into the exhibition of African art. Instead of crowding multiple objects into a single case as anthropo- logical artifacts, grouped according to ethnic and "tribal" origin, the Dapper re- spectfully showcased each piece. This approach took advantage of the best aspects of museum and gallery environ- ments. Occasionally the information about individual objects was only mini- mal, following the themes of a particular exhibition. While this absence of anthro- pological texts might have been a source of concern to Africanist scholars, it en- hanced the streamlined aesthetic effect that has come to be the Dapper style. Although four times as large as the original structure, the new Dapper, designed by the architect Alain Moatti, maintains the museum's signature style. The exhibition rooms are modularized so they can be adapted to displays of either traditional or contemporary art, preserving a sense of freedom and open- ness in each case. Minimal anthropologi- cal intervention sustains the elegance of the new displays (Fig. 1). Since 1986 the Fondation Dapper has sponsored more than thirty exhibitions, and the museum now organizes two (as opposed to its initial three) per year, each lasting approximately six months. Among the most memorable Dapper projects were the 1993 "Luba: Aux sources du Zaire," the 1994 "Dogon," and the 1996 "Magies" (Figs. 3,4). All were memorable for the power of the African objects, the cachet of their provenance, and the digni- ty of their display. The two ethnographic museums in Paris, the Musee de l'Homme and the Musee des Arts d'Afrique et d'Oceanie (MAAO), formerly the Musee Colonial, were fueled by the colonial enterprise, their curators assiduously stockpiling col- lections of African artifacts and display- ing them as icons of cultural difference. "Objets sauvages" have always fascinated European audiences, and the titillation of neoprimitivism continues to be an under- current in the display of old and new African art in France today. In this type of display, as Sally Price points out, "aesthet- ic experiences and beauty are not joined with ethnographic evidence and social curiosity, but opposed to them" (1989:87). The modernist approaches of these two institutions, which were innovative in the early twentieth century, contrasts with the Dapper's contemporary aesthetics. In the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, the Musee de l'Homme is an important stop on any tour of official monumental Paris. The MAAO, with its grounds next to a zoo, is an exotic touristic site that recalls France's former colonial connections. The dosing of the latter institution in January 2002 heralds the end of a nostalgic era of African-art acquisition and preservation in France. Under the government's new approach to so-called arts premiers, part of the MAAO's collection will be displayed in the Louvre, and other works from both the MAAO and the Musee de l'Homme will be conserved for research purposes. Certain objects are to be retained for occa- sional display. According to Bonny Gabin, cultural attache for the Musee Dapper, the government will decide which objects to keep and which to sell in order to upgrade standing collections and develop thematic exhibitions. As for the Dapper, Gabin ex- plained its goals to me as follows (inter- view, November 29,2001): We have the same objectives as any museum-to conserve and dissem- inate culture through objects and paintings. In particular, we have the specialty of promoting the pre- colonial arts of sub-Saharan Africa. Today, however, we live in a multi- cultural world, one characterized by metissage. Consequently, the Dapper is beginning to open up new vistas that include the cultures of the diaspora. All of this has its roots in a deep connection with the African continent. Thus, although the Dapper maintains a commitment to the display of fine "first arts" drawn from private, commercial, and public collections across Europe, its new approach to diasporic art and its sleek postmodern headquarters tell a dif- ferent story. In a recent interview (Merle des Isles &amp; Mensah 2001), director Christiane Fal- gayrettes-Leveau explained that the Dapper's projects are necessarily much african arts * summer 2002 22</page><page sequence="4">smaller than those of the state-supported Pavilion des Sessions (at the Louvre) and the Musee du Quai Branly, the latter scheduled to open in 2004. Although she serves on the organizing board of the Quai Branly project, Falgayrettes-Leveau views her museum, which in 2001 had a budget of only seven million francs, as occupying a distinctive niche that is "less political" and less research-oriented than the state institutions. Its more modest objectives have pushed her to increase the museum's focus not only on diasporic arts but also on contemporary work. From April to June 2001, the Musee Dapper exhibited Ousmane Sow's first three bronzes (Dayde 2001). The Sene- galese sculptor is renowned for his larg- er-than-life anthropomorphic works, which have been shown in both Europe and Africa. His neorealism captures the emotional turbulence of Africa in transi- tion (Fig. 5). Battle of the Little Big Horn, a series of thirty-five sculptures, was on display in Paris at the Pont des Arts, in front of the Louvre, in 1999. Seen by mil- lions of viewers, it has garnered the artist international acclaim. The Dapper rapidly followed with "Lam metis," an exhibition of historic paintings and prints by the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam (September 26,2001-January 20, 2002). This show marked the muse- um's entry into a new multicultural and postmodern era. In her preface to the cata- logue, Christiane Falgayrettes-Leveau (2001:9-10) states: Lam, the man of every country, real or imaginary, traversed with emotion, suffering, and hope, Cuba, China, Spain, France, Africa, as a shared land....Since its re- opening in November 2000, the Musee Dapper intends to be atten- tive to voices emanating from the diaspora. With his Hispanic, African, and Chinese heritage and insatiable interest in world art, Lam (1902-1982) was the perfect fig- ure to launch the Dapper's new dias- poric efforts. Closely connected to Picasso, Michel Leiris, surrealism, and the Musee de l'Homme, he epitomizes the interna- tional currents in the Franco-African art scene (Fig. 6). Lam's incorporation of multiple artistic strands, ranging in origin from Nigeria to Santeria to Picasso, made for a powerful exhibition. The African, Asian, and Oceanic influences on his paintings and drawings (Fig. 7) were highlighted by a display of works from around the world that were similar to those he himself had collected or whose cept of arts premiers, which became newly invigorated with the power of a contem- porary creator who reread them in his own work. Incorporation and reinvention are precisely what the Musee Dapper has achieved in the new space. By drawing together the old and new in an ultramod- ern setting, the museum reminds every- one that African art is in and of our time-an objective presently met in two concurrent exhibitions (February 13-July 21), "Afrique secrete" (Figs. 2, 11, 12) and 5.

The exhibition of work by the Cuban painter Lam, who was partly of African heritage, an- nounced the Dapper's intention to present the arts of the African diaspora. "L'Art en marche: Sculptures de Ndary Lo" (Fig. 13). The exhibitions are comple- mented by concerts and theatrical perfor- mances in the state-of-the-art theater. Recent programs included hip-hop, Afri- can dance, and African tales and fables for children. Workshops attract a public interested in learning about African art in its conventional and contemporary forms. This multifaceted approach to museum display is reinforced by guided tours to African sites and a variety of local educational programs that are part of the Dapper's expanding outreach activities. The museum has also devel- oped a world-class collection of African- art publications and has included African and diasporic literature among its pub- lished works. One has the sense that the Musee Dapper is on the threshold of important cultural innovations and is willing to take the risks associated with change. The museum has been transformed from a space of display to one of interaction and learning. Underlying all of this are the seeds of a new cultural movement that in its energy and dynamism re- minds one of the heyday of the Parisian journal Presence Africaine. For these inno- vations, the Dapper deserves a special place on the international roster of muse- ums of African art. Museums occupy a contested terrain in the history and discourse of Black Paris. They are both preservers of patrimony and agents of domination. Behind this con- testation is what V. Y. Mudimbe (1986:4) has termed "the meaning of integration" of African art into European epistemolog- ical frameworks. The Dionysian desire to see primal creative forces reflected in African art has a long history in the West and was recapitulated in the idealistic and essentialist orientations toward surreal- ism, cubism, and the Negritude move- ment. The idea of arts premiers offers a new Orientalist cloak for primitivism, but behind primitivism's reconstructed mask in France lies the political economy of the art world and its systems of patronage, protection, and exchange. Issues of political economy and social representation go hand in hand. Respond- ing to Senghorian essentialism in art, Frantz Fanon argued: "You will never make colonialism blush for shame by spreading out little-known cultural trea- african arts * summer 2002 24</page><page sequence="6">sures under its eyes" (1963:223). But nei- ther the availability nor the appropri- ation of African art objects is really at issue. More interesting questions revolve around the uses of these objects in cultur- al representation and cycles of exchange. Early encounters with contemporary African art, such as the 1966 World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar, opened up new possibilities for a revisionist Afri- can aesthetic canon in France. As this art emerged as a viable domain of produc- tion, consumption, and criticism in the festivals of the 1960s and '70s and the biennials of the 1980s and '90s, move- ments to re-examine and repatriate the continent's artistic treasures also gained momentum. During the 1980s, President Francois Mitterand's positive policy toward black arts, implemented by Minister of Culture Jack Lang and the support of the Agence de Cooperation Culturelle et Technique (ACCT), placed more resources in the hands of galleries, theater groups, and publications interest- ed in Africa. State-supported art acade- mies on the African continent also began to train a cadre of cosmopolitan artists ready to enter the European marketing loop. These academies also boosted the growth and circulation of popular arts. All of these influences, often glossed 7. Je suis by Wifredo Lam, 1949. Oil on canvas; 125cm x 108cm (49.2" x 42.5").

In 1988-89, the extravagant exhibition "Magiciens de la terre," under the direc- tion of Jean-Hubert Martin and Andre Magnin at the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Grande Halle de La Villette in Paris, epitomized a new direction in African art (Aareen 1989:3-14). Works of European avant-gardists and "world" artists were juxtaposed for their "magi- cal" qualities (Njami 1993:17). The pres- ence of contemporary African art within major French museum spaces trans- formed the symbolic and economic value of the work. Within a year after the exhi- bition, across the Parisian landscape new African art galleries opened and others were reinvigorated: Galerie New Black Arts on rue Hermel, Galerie Patras on rue Sainte-Anastase, and Galerie Est on rue Keller (Equipe du Guide Paris Mondial 1992:54-56). All of these galleries became important iconic and touristic sites in Black Paris. Although the trend was short-lived (for example, Galerie New Black Arts was closed by 1998), this moment of artistic effervescence marked a turning point in the interpretation and valuation of African art in France. With the constricted state resources of the late 1990s, the African art scene changed. The closing of ACCT removed crucial funding for galleries, African-art publications, and individual artists. The flourishing artistic and literary move- ments of the late 1980s and early '90s stagnated. African-oriented publishing houses such as Editions Silex went out of business, and other gallery outlets and publishers such as Presence Africaine engaged in serious restructuring and financial cutbacks. Throughout this period, the Musee Dapper continued to grow and thrive, becoming a focal point for some of the artistic activities of Black Paris. Falgay- rettes-Leveau engaged African and dias- poric artists in the museum's outreach events, theatrical performances, and edu- cational tours. Inclusion of contemporary art on the museum's roster of exhibitions became a logical step. Economic changes have brought into evidence the troubling ideological and social issues surrounding African art and artists in France. With globalization and rising south-north migration, more Afri- can artists have gone to France to per- form, to record, to sell their works, and sometimes to take up permanent resi- dence. Symbolically, immigration is one factor contributing to the cultural pres- sure to separate contemporary works, characterized by metissage and blending, from "pure" or "authentic" arts premiers, which can be reinterpreted as part of the cultural patrimony of a universal civilization. At this point, Fanon's dictum on the theories and practices of museology comes back to haunt us. The salvaging and safeguarding of African artifacts have the potential to distance them even fur- ther from their sources of creation. The Dapper's inclusion of contemporary and diasporic arts addresses this problem by blurring the boundaries between arts pre- miers and modem works. Ultimately, this strategic move may help to protect the old arts and reinvigorate the new.

Many of the artists showed their work in at least one of several exhibitions held in 1995 and 1996 locally and internationally. Thus Art in South Africa: The Future Present serves as an alternative catalogue of South African partic- ipation in these events: the first Johannesburg Biennial, two exhibitions at Cape Town Castle (a former military fortress and local headquarters of the South African Defense Force), the Venice Biennale, the Sao Paulo Biennial, the Havana Biennial, and Container '96 in Denmark. The obvious predominance of white male artists in Art in South Africa led me to the fol- lowing count: just over half are indeed white men, just over a quarter are white women, and just under a quarter are men of color; there are no women of color or Asians, male or female. This is surprising in a book steeped in the political and social questioning that fol- lowed apartheid. The omission is perhaps understandable given the reality of the immediate post- apartheid South Africa; my own introduction to the country was in 1989, when I co-curated a show on mail art by women, most of them white, which included both Sue Williamson and Marion Arnold. The imbalance in Art in South Africa, however, might have been miti- gated by extending the parameters to include artists who had participated in slightly less mainstream exhibitions. Arnold's call, in Women and Art in South Africa, for the rediscovery of unrecognized or underrecognized women artists is one that I support wholeheartedly. Their omission in Art in South Africa seems justification enough for the publication of such a book. As a sculptor who has been involved in the women's art movement in the United States, I appreciate the hardships and difficulties faced by women artists: they often work alone without the sup- port of an art community or much support at all, stealing time and space from social and family obligations and having little contact with prevailing art movements. I understand when Arnold writes about the back seat that white feminism took because of the urgency of apartheid. It is certainly time to pay attention to the concerns of women artists in South Africa. Women and Art in South Africa is about women as artists and as subjects of art. There is a good description of European male artists and their depiction of black women, and a contrast between early white colonists and African peoples. Arnold is careful to examine the difficulties women faced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and continue to face today throughout Africa. She is at her best in her concise history of the European settlement of South Africa told through the images and anecdotes of early European explorers, travelers, and settlers- and the artists among them. Arnold provides art historical support for previously undis- cussed paintings and information about the lives of the women and historical events in South Africa. 90 In her characterizations and analyses, how- ever, she often overstates her case in an effort to convince the reader of the importance of the artists, their motivation, their difficulties. On page 37, she tells us what female and male viewers will think when they see a given work. How does she know? Her heavy-handed opin- ions don't give us the evidence, or trust us to reach our own conclusions based on that evi- dence; it is often difficult to distinguish be- tween evidence and opinion. Arnold is often plodding, methodical, and too cautious, over- explaining very simple concepts. Mysteriously, she sometimes neglects others. On page 103, for example, she tells us that photo realism is not objective but constructed, but gives no explanation of what she means by "post-struc- turalist late twentieth century perspective." That most of the book is about white women is disappointing. Arnold seems to think that now that the apartheid government has officially gone, there is no need to address the sustained and continuing wound. Her dis- cussion of women of color is largely limited to their portrayal by early white male settlers and contemporary white women. Black women enter Arnold's text as artists very late, and few notes LOUGHRAN: References cited, from page 11 Gott, Edith Suzanne. 1994.

Siderberg has written separately on whistles, pointing out that they have often been mistaken for bottle-stoppers (Siderberg 1966). He misses the connection between whis- tles and both "hunting" for witches and sex; references to sex in these miniature sculptures he reads as reflecting a concern with fertility, which is not the same thing. Mwivi, for exam- ple, is an nkisi whose constituent medicines included whis- tles (zinsiba) and whose function was to bring its owner success both in hunting and in seducing women (Lwamba, Cahier 240). 6.

Their significance remains unexplained, although they are linked through smithing to the powers of simbi spirits. The besides Helen Sebidi are considered. The book might more aptly be called White Women and Art in South Africa. Like many mainstream white feminists, Arnold falls into the trap of assuming that all women have the same struggles, problems, and disappointments as white middle-class women. Assuming the existence of a kind of generic womanhood, they try to speak for women of color, just as white men try to speak for white women. In several places Arnold laments that the struggle against apartheid forced women of color to be of color first and women second. Yet she demands that women of color see themselves as women first and black second. This impossible demand divides black and white women. To write a parallel book on black women's cultural production may again require that we expand the Western definition of art and take up that tiresome high art/low art debate. And then it would require primary and historical research into what black women (and men) were producing while the women in Arnold's book were working as botanical and land- scape painters. I will be anxious to hear other voices as the legacy of apartheid fades. D "puffing" action of bellows (fula) is associated with the move- ment of spirits (mpeve). References cited Adams, M. 1989.

Brush Art Gallery, St. Lawrence University, Canton, New York, on November 2,1998. I wish to thank Obiora Udechukwu, Olu Oguibe, and Chika Okeke for helpful comments on early drafts of this paper. 1. I videotaped my interview with the artist in his study at Nsukka on June 4, 1994. Further quotations in this article are also drawn from that occasion. 2. Ndefo, the most influential secondary-school art teacher of his day, worked part-time at a number of schools in the Onitsha region. He also taught the artists Okechukwu Odita, Oseloka Osadebe, Chukwuanugo Okeke, Benjo Igwilo, and Paul Igboanugo (Ottenberg, forthcoming). 3. Not to be confused with the University of Nigeria, Enugu. 4. Although Udechukwu had seen body and wall uli as a youngster in his home town of Agulu, he had not paid atten- tion to it, perhaps because his art training at that time was not in indigenous art forms to any extent, perhaps because he was living in urban Onitsha. His initial scholarly contact with uli occurred in 1966, during his first year as an art student at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, when he wrote a term paper for the Humanities General Studies course. "So, for the first time, I went to the village [Agulu, his own] and took color photographs of wall paintings and spoke to the artists and came back and wrote the essay. By that time I did not even know that Uche Okeke's drawings, which I had seen, were influenced by those paintings" (Beier 1981:56). He had seen Okeke's drawings at the Mbari Centre in Enugu. In 1972 he wrote his B.A. thesis on uli from Agulu (Udechukwu 1972). 5. Among important non-Igbo artists who have drawn upon uli are the sculptor El Anatsui, originally from Ghana, where he trained, but who now teaches at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; and the watercolorist Tayo Adenaike of Yoruba background, who studied with Udechukwu at Nsukka. 6. Some art forms and performances did not survive the war. Most Igbo traditional art was destroyed or seized by federal troops, and important rituals could not be held nor customs followed during the war. 7. Though Uche Okeke had actually begun the uli and Igbo moder art movement before the war, it was only after the war, when he became head of the art department at Nsukka, that uli developed its contemporary style through his influence on other emerging artists. 8. Udechukwu told Ulli Beier that Okigbo's poetry "was very lyrical even if you did not quite understand what he was say- ing" (Azuah et al. 1993:21) 9. See, for example, Udechukwu 1975,1990, in which drawings and poems occur together. At other times the artist has used titles derived from the poetry of Okigbo and other Nigerians. 10. Former students of Udechukwu, particularly Tayo Adenaike, Chika Okeke, and Marcia Kure, have also made use of nsibidi. 11. This motif, a vertical rectangle intersected in the center by a horizontal and a vertical line, bears some resemblance to the wood-framed mirror found in Nigeria. See Ottenberg 1997: fig. 86 for Writing in the Sky; fig. 102 a, c, for Isinwaoji; fig. 80 for People of the Night. 12. But see his Mirror, Mirror (ink drawing, 1989) in Ottenberg 1997: fig. 79, and on the front cover of Udechukwu 1990, where the nsibidi mirror motif is the dominant image. 13. Udechukwu 1981b. For background on Li art see Rowley 1959, especially pp. 35-36; and Hay 1939. The last two cita- tions were kindly furnished by Jerome Silbergeld. 14. Also known as Ibrahim el Salahi. See Beier 1961, 1962, 1983, 1990; Hassan 1998; Kennedy 1992: 09.-113. 15. C. Okeke (1999:290) makes a further suggestion, that Udechu- kwu's art was influenced by contemporary Australian Aboriginal painting, which Udechukwu saw in Europe. Much of the Nige- rian's work has a similar linear quality and use of motifs. 16. He has illustrated numerous books and journals; his pen- and-ink and brush work is ideally suited to the printed form. 17. Originally composed of thirteen eastern Nigerian artists. See their annual exhibition catalogues since 1986, except for 1998. 18. He has worked particularly but not exclusively with Iwalewa-Haus, University of Bayreuth, and with Ulli Beier and Norbert Aas in that city. 18. For House of Four Trees see Conrfigura 2 1995; C. Okeke 1998:47-48; Ottenberg 1997:147, 159, 153. For The House of Truth see C. Okeke 1998:48-49. 19. For a more detailed analysis of Udechukwu's art since contributors articles ELISABETH L.
