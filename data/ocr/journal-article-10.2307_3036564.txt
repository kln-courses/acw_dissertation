In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin often appealed anecdotally to the behavior of other animals to show that each of the mental capacities supposedly unique to human beings can be found, differing only in degree, in our evolutionary precursors. His student and disciple, George Romanes, explicitly defended this practice. But is it defensible? That is the topic of discussion in the twenty-nine chapters in this volume. The cen- tral theme is stated succinctly by Frans de Waal in his elegant foreword: "The dilemma faced by behav- ioral science today, and the grand theme underly- ing the present volume, can be summarized as a choice between cognitive and evolutionary parsi- mony'' (p xiv). Although the book's origins are in a session of the 1989 meeting of the National Animal Behavior Society, fewer than half of the papers were pre- sented there. Despite its somewhat chaotic organi- zation, this volume contains many papers of value to ethologists, evolutionary biologists, and compar- ative psychologists. Virtually all of the papers focus on problems in the conceptual and methodological foundations of ethology and comparative psychology. The message is clear: these foundations are in flux. The contributors disagree on such fundamen- tal questions as how to define anthropomorphism and on the validity of ascribing human-like cognitive attitudes (beliefs, desires, emotions) and processes (thinking, evaluating) to other species. A number of authors help to clarify the conceptual and meth- odological issues involved in the attempt to under- stand the behavior of other animals in their natural environments. Ruth Garrett Millikan's characteris- tically clear analysis of purposive behavior (Chapter 15) is a useful philosophical introduction to the subject. On the dangers of anthropomorphism and how to avoid them, the contributions of Povinelli (Chapter 8), Lehman (Chapter 9), Bekoff and Al- len (Chapter 23), and Parker (Chapter 25) are all valuable. Part VIII, which contains three essays fo- cused on the question of the attribution of language to various species, can be viewed as case studies in the pitfalls discussed in these papers. The explorations of Mitchell (Chapter 13) and Byrne (Chapter 12), on anecdotal evidence, are es- pecially useful, and should be considered while studying the papers in Part VI, on the attribution of consciousness and self-consciousness to other ani- mals, where the perils of uncritical anecdotalism are rife. The editors contribute two guides to the reading in the first and last chapters, and 62 pages of references.
