<plain_text><page sequence="1">Myth: Its Meaning and Functions in Anicient and Other Cultures. By G. S. KIRK. ("Sather Classical Lectures," Vol. 40.) Cambridge: University Press; Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1970. Pp. xii + 299. $7.95. In this extraordinarily wide-ranging and ambitious book, G. S. Kirk does three things: he analyzes critically a number of definitions and theories of myth (pp. 1-56, 252-85), offers a comparative study of myth in a variety of cultures (pp. 56-152, 205-26), and attempts to reveal the distinctive qualities of Greek mythology (pp. 152-205, 226-51). With respect to each of his objectives he has performed an extremely valuable service. His theoretical and comparative pages are likely to prove the most useful guide available not only to the student of the classics but to anyone interested in myth. The sections on Greece may well seem to be a good deal more problematic and less useful to the novice, and that is only as it should be with a book in this series, by this author. But in the relatively few pages he devotes explicitly to Greek mythology, he presents the most penetrating and stimulating discussion of the subject I have seen. To be sure, the shallowness or quirkiness of most writing on the subject offers little competition, but his own contri- butions are no less original and important for that. K. is for the most part clear and cogent in his criticism of current theories that offer a</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 149 single explanation for all myth. Neither the restriction of myth to the sacred, nor a neces- sary association with, or even parallelism to, ritual, survives his scrutiny. At best such theories touch on only a part of the whole spectrum of myth.1 ". . . Myth as a general concept is completely vague . .. it implies in itself no more than a traditional story" (p. 28). Most theories define myth in such a way as to restrict it to a class in which the writer is interested and which is amenable to the treatment he wishes to apply. And when it comes to offering his own alternative views, K. avoids circularity no better than his pre- decessors. He is interested in "the more imaginative" components and leaves "the more legendary aspects" aside (p. 34). To the contrast between sacred and secular he prefers that of myth and folk tale. For the latter his "preliminary and incomplete definition" ex- cludes precisely those features he would appropriate for myth. In folk tales the "super- natural elements are subsidiary; they are not primarily concerned with 'serious' subjects or the reflexion of deep problems and pre- occupations; and their first appeal lies in their narrative interest" (p. 37). So long as we realize what he is doing, there is no great harm in this. In the varied body of traditional story, K. is interested in what is potentially "serious," supernatural and fantastic. Whether or not myth so defined is a separate reality to the degree that one can postulate a historical phase in which such storytelling was dominant and through which any significant culture (such as that of the Greeks) must have passed (p. 240) is another matter entirely. Furthermore the labeling of so much of all traditional story- telling as folk tale means that it is regarded as having purely or primarily narrative interest (i.e., it is narrative for its own sake), whereas intellectual and functional considerations are restricted to what K. has called myth. The larger phenomenon of verbal art that includes, in an overtly realistic narrative, the fantastic 1. K.'s comments, in passing, on religion and ritual seem unfortunately superficial and off the cuff, particularly since he does allow significant contacts between myth and religion. E.g., pp. 19 ff., and 31: "To religion ... intensity of feeling might be conceded as an essential property." and the speculative remains out of account, and this creates serious problems for Greece. Having, for instance, shown that the corollary to the Greek abhorrence of old age and disease is the notion of a swift and honorable death, K. notes that it "is implicit not in myths, curiously enough, but in the heroic ideal itself, and in exemplary tales like that of Cleobis and Biton" (p. 191), which is to say that the burden of the narrative of the Iliad and of the stories of Herodotus is necessary for a full view of the moral imagination of the Greeks. Again, K. describes the gods of Homer as "the metaphysical aspect of a primarily legendary narrative" (p. 33) and believes that largely because of the gods many human episodes in Homer "have acquired archetypal mythical status" (p. 34). On the contrary, it can be argued with more justi- fication that the narrative patterns themselves envelop the gods. So too the overtly historical (or legendary) stories of Herodotus fall into traditional (not to say mythical) narrative patterns which relate to the character of Greek culture and are more than universally "good stories." To the more important, and more difficult, theories of Levi-Strauss K. devotes a separate chapter. It will be illuminating to the many who share both his interest in the anthropolo- gist's ideas and his exasperation with their mode of expression. From L.-S. K. takes two concepts that are essential for his own analysis of Mesopotamian and Greek mythology in the chapters that follow, namely that the very structure of a myth, at various levels of meaning, can be a large part of its significance, and that myth represents a serious means of mediating polarities and contradictions within a society, especially those between nature and culture (in the societies L.-S. knows best). K. would avoid L.-S.'s insistence on the ab- stract, algebraical character of mythic structure and speaks rather of a tendency to reduce the diversity of experience to an orderly predict- able system; and where L.-S. seems to regard content as irrelevant, K. insists on there being "a structure of particular materials, and one that is partly determined by them" (p. 43). Nor will K. follow L.-S. and E. R. Leach in</page><page sequence="3">150 BOOK REVIEWS saying that the myth consists of all its versions and that it "remains the same as long as it is felt as such." Greek myths, for instance, he sees as "quite heavily polluted" by the "exag- geration of folklore elements at the expense of speculative and explanatory elements" (pp. 49-50). Against L.-S.'s emphasis on repetition as pointing to what is essential and all details as having significance, K. adduces the evi- dence from the study of oral poetry for the practical utility of repetition and the in- evitability of variation in detail. L.-S. "disregards the facts and circumstances of story-telling" (p. 73). All this seems eminently reasonable (it is certainly a lot clearer than the words of the master),' but I cannot suppress some qualms. For instance, K. attempts a compromise with L.-S. by limiting his acceptance of the unity of a myth to the time before the myth is corrupted or polluted but twits L.-S. for "coming perilously close to claiming that myths which do not accord with his idea of structure are not true myths" (p. 82); indeed, it is a peril hard to avoid. Again, for L.-S.'s a priori assumptions about the human mind, K. claims to give us empirical observations of the behavior of storytellers. One wishes he had pursued more fully their crucial role and the comparison with the oral poet. Attention to the storyteller or myth-maker might suggest that every version of the myth is a separate, created entity at the same time as the myth, qua Levi-Straussian myth, consists of all its versions. One may wonder if there is any gain over L.-S. in isolating "objectively" certain elements without considering whether they have any reality in the actual conditions of storytelling. Does K., in fact, provide us with more solid bases than L.-S. ? The assumptions about the functions of narrative and oral techniques (". . . the ordinary symmetrical and anti- thetical tendencies of simple narrative" [p. 58]) seem to me just as unexamined as L.-S.'s about the operations of the human mind. K. will grant that one cannot take refuge in saying a group of tales is "'about' nothing except a story" only to go on to say that ". . . many aspects of the myths are determined by the plain rules of narrative and drama-even, to put it loosely, by the operation of sheer imagination" (p. 81). Of course traditional, oral art behaves in this way, but why? In view of the serious, if controversial, arguments for underlying linguistic patterns ("deep structure") in the human mind being put forward by Noam Chomsky and others, L.-S.'s views on human predilection for pattern in myth are hardly answered by references to empirical observations of narrative techniques. Near the end of the book, K. allows more vaguely for the place of instinct in the forma- tion of symbolic patterns, and it may be the formalism of L.-S.'s views that he objects to. Still, what at first sight seems a welcome dose of English empiricism after excessive Gallic abstraction runs the risk of becoming a com- promise that satisfies no one. Still, the com- plaints I raise should not obscure the area of agreement between K. and L.-S. and the solid gains from K.'s clarification and de-mystifica- tion. They are seen to good effect in the succeeding chapters in which he analyzes important groups of Near Eastern myths. The value of this careful and intelligent treatment of the fiction of ancient literate cultures cannot be overemphasized. K. goes beyond the examination of Near Eastern myths for their influence on Greece, now thoroughly accepted, though he has much that is useful to say on the subject. The reader need not take a Hellenist's word for the accuracy and subtlety of K.'s work here; my colleague, Professor Ake Sjoberg, permits me to say how impressed he is, particularly by the treatment of the myth of Enlil and Ninlil. The achievement is to some degree a tribute to the work of the distinguished orientalists of our time from whom K. can draw his materials even if he disagrees with their inter- pretations. We have been living in a heroic age of scholarship. K. finds "the essential concerns that are the major impetus" of Sumerian mythology expressed "partly in their overt subjects but more conspicuously by their underlying nar- rative structure" (pp. 115-16). He shows in a number of myths the interrelation of human and natural fertility and the way in which a</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 151 special meaning is achieved by the juxtaposi- tion of themes. He finds a similar "two-stage character" in the Akkadian Etana myth which responds well to a Levi-Straussian view of a mediation between high and low, directed towards the maintenance of the institution of the kingship. So too, the Adapa myth, though simpler in structure, shows a parallel concern with the maintenance of an institution, that of the priesthood. The Gilgamesh epic, in both Sumerian and Akkadian versions, is analyzed at greater length (pp. 132-52) to bring out well the themes of nature versus culture and of the acceptance of disease and death. Brief summary cannot do justice to the richness of K.'s discussion.2 It is tempting, after the rewarding analogies of the contrast between nature and culture in Gilgamesh, to look for similar contrasts in Greek mythology. These K. finds in the Centaurs, both as a race opposed to men and in the exceptional, "civilized" Centaurs, Cheiron and Pholus, compared to their fellows. Particularly striking in the story of Pholus is Heracles' use of fire against the Centaurs and the cooked meat he eats, while Pholus (in this respect perhaps a typical Centaur) eats his meat raw (pp. 162, 158). That Cheiron and Pholus show the beneficent 2. Doubts about theory, however, remain. At one point neatness and compactness are seen as being closer to an original, to an "authentic core of myth" (pp. 110-11), though these are later, Akkadian versions. Further on, we see the juxtaposition of themes which had independently simple, "narrative" value, as producing the distinctively speculative qualities that are for K. the mark of myth (p. 118); then two pages later we are told of older, briefer versions which are "more mythical." Folk-tale elements in the story of Bilulu and Inanna ("a hymn or a lament rather than a myth" [pp. 114-15]) are excluded from myth. The flood story exists essentially for its narrative qualities, while the Creation Epic is so straightforward that it is "restricted in its implication" (p. 122). All these judgments stem from the desire to isolate the mythical as a distinct type existing in its own time. From K.'s own full and frank presentation, one can suggest that the notion of the juxtaposition of themes (p. 118) says in effect that greater thematic complexity results in a more complex meaning (which is not very surprising). K. notes that "the more elaborate Sumerian myths are . . . remarkable for the unimportance of their operative or charter aspects [which were] more important in local tales that did not gain wide currency" (p. 117). Here the social effect on the character of myth might be made clearer: "charter" myths validate characteristic institutions of particular societies; if such tales spread it is presumably because of qualities that concern a wider audience. rather than the violent aspect of nature (p. 160) is not so clear; it may be only that the contrast within the species brings out the essential qualities of the Centaurs more sharply. But beyond this point K.'s treatment is not revealing, although, as he says, the Centaurs are one of the few distinctively Greek mythological phenomena. K. is frank to admit the uncertainties that beset the problem. I do not even find the concept of the Centaurs as being imported from the north, where there were actual wild horses, "illu- minating as far as it goes." We cannot be sure that the name or the concept was always applied to the man-horses, so prominent in Greek art. The rich repertory of Minoan hybrid monsters might well have had an influence. The Cyclopes, however, form another contrast with men, but in terms of primitive versus developed society rather than of nature versus culture, as K. still sees it. For just as he rightly points out that the contrast in the case of the Centaurs arises from "Greek national consciousness" (i.e., not from the immediate consciousness of nature of L.-S.'s South Americans), so he might better have seen the treatment of the Cyclopes in the light of Greek consciousness of social variety. K. complicates the problem by assigning the "paradisical" side of the Cyclopes' life to "culture" and describing it as "supercivilized." Rather, the Cyclopes of the Odyssey seem to combine inconsistent versions of "primitive society," different ways of setting them apart from normal human society. When K. comes to deal with the whole range of Greek mythology in Chapter v, he is concerned to "define its total qualities" (p. 172). But since his understanding of myth stresses "the fantastic and imaginative quali- ties," much that both the Greeks and moderns have regarded as myth fails to qualify-the heroes of saga and their sagas (distinctively important for the Greeks), and much that has to do with the gods, who, as K. sees, exist in the first instance in cult rather than myth ("The mythical power of a deity may depend not so much on what he or she does as on what he or she is" [p. 178]). After</page><page sequence="5">152 BOOK REVIEWS assigning much to folk tale, he finds that "the fantastic elements ... are few" (p. 182) and is struck by "the thematic simplicity, almost shallowness of most Greek myths" (p. 187). An incidental observation of his might suggest a chronological distinction between "myth" and "saga": the more "mythical" stories are attached to the heroes of generations before the Trojan War (p. 177), but it is also most likely that "earlier" heroes such as the Greater Ajax and Odysseus were assimilated into the Trojan War and that generation of heroes. The whole problem of the impact on Greek fiction of the concept of an age of heroes and a "Trojan War," attached most conspicuously to places promi- nent in a brilliant, vanished historical period, is deliberately and (I think) regrettably avoided by an author who is exceptionally well equipped to deal with it.3 K. makes a suggestive comment on the presence of a violent and destructive side in even the best of heroes (about all that survives from his review of the thesis of Angelo Brelich) as perhaps representing "some kind of mediation between order and disorder," if not "little more than a projection of aristo- cratic materialism and love of power" (hardly an alternative to the former view). But the suggestion then founders on a basic un- certainty in the whole approach: K. sees "the ambiguity more as an accidental result of a complex tradition than as an intended contrast . .." (p. 187). Myth, he seems to suggest, lies in a narrow band between the entirely random consequences of a variety of factors and fully rational processes. This is a conception, never fully explored, that con- stantly causes difficulties. There are stimulating incidental remarks. Some myths of the gods "emphasize the ambiguous borderline between gods and men"; "[the gods'] presence so obvious that it can be overlooked is a fundamental component of the Greek mythological conception"; and 3. Problems which fall outside his definition are treated carelessly. I am not enlightened by the remark that Heracles' immolation on Mt. Oeta is "a familiar fire-ritual connected with fertility" (p. 185), nor do I believe that "many heroic figures of myth . .. just belonged to aristocratic families that traced their ultimate genesis to a god or goddess" (p. 176). "the very concept of anthropomorphic gods . . . not exclusively Greek, was one of pro- found fantasy" (pp. 192-93). "The implicit drama of family stress . . . permeates every kind of Greek myth" (p. 193), but to say that it is "a broad response to a continuing human characteristic" (p. 194) tells us nothing. Why is it so prominent in Greek mythology? "A response to a continuing characteristic of Greek society" would be nearer the mark. As K. remarks later (p. 226), the emphasis on it in Greece "is a natural concomitant of [Greek mythology's] vast development on the heroic side and perhaps also of its strong folktale character..." There are also in- teresting comments on a number of the themes K. distinguishes, such as on the role of fire in myth, even though the suggested sacred- secular contrast for the Prometheus stories is not seen convincingly in the Hesiodic versions. K.'s refreshingly frank uncertainty leads to theoretical chaos in the discussion of the theme of "The Displacement of Elders": historical, social, and psychological explana- tions are offered as equal alternative explana- tions, a procedure which strikes me as no better than the uncontrolled musings on mythology from which K. does so much to rescue us. The themes of Fire and of the Displacement of Elders are concerned with the linking of men and gods. A third emphasis, the theme of Fertility, is found "mainly in striking and unusual myth. It is surprisingly inconspicuous in the common and more folk- tale influenced types" (p. 202) when compared with the myths of other cultures. May this not tell us something about the place of folk tale in Greece, namely that fertility themes are closely connected with cult, specifically with cults that make use of secrecy, while folk tale occupies a more "social" area, concerned with the relations between men? K. provides a diagram which "symbolizes a pattern of preoccupations"; this, he thinks, brings out "the complexity and systematic quality" of Greek myth (p. 205), a quality which even with the diagram, I do not really see, except as it results from a long history. No doubt it is a good deal more evident to the author who patiently surveys and com-</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 153 pares Hurrian, Canaanite, Germanic, Egyp- tian, and Indian mythology in the following section. (On the relationship of Hurrian Kumarbi and Greek Kronos K. is especially helpful.) Among his conclusions he finds that "only the Greeks possessed a heroic mythology that blended . .. saga, folktale and divine myth into an elaborate and superficially consistent system" (p. 206). Is this a way of saying that it is hard to separate these ele- ments in Greece ? Is it that the system is consistent or that our distinctions are not fully valid? Only in the work of Hesiod among the Greeks does K. find a suitable candidate for his view of myth, and even then only with many qualifications. One may disagree on details but in general these pages (pp. 226-38) are extraordinarily rewarding.4 K. shows how structure and pattern embody imaginative and serious speculation which need not suggest solutions. Even more could be gained by extending the approach to each of Hesiod's poems as a whole rather than concentrating on the Prometheus stories and the Five Races. K. is clearly unhappy with the usual view of the Prometheus myth as "aetiological through and through" but he does not pursue the sources of his disquiet.5 It would be worth while to study the Greek use of the mechanical aition, such as the sacrificial trick of Prome- theus, which, I would argue, was not the justification to the Greeks of why they sacri- ficed as they did but says a great deal about Hesiod's view of the human condition. K. disagrees sharply with the common view that Hesiod is "transitional" from mythological to rational thought and that his work provided the stimulus for early philosophy (good re- marks on what may have been the stimuli, pp. 247-48). He thinks that the peculiar Hesiodic 4. E.g., not all will accept Vernant's analysis of the Five Races, nor do I follow K.'s thoughts on the relationship of Hesiod to his antecedents, such as his doubts that Hesiod was capable of injecting the subtlety observable in that myth. The alternatives, that either a more "careful thinker" [i.e., more rational?] or a "longer and more obviously mythological account" lay behind Hesiod (p. 237), seem contradictory. The evils that Pandora brings on mankind are not confined to diseases (p. 230 and WD 90 ff.). 5. M. L. West, Hesiod: "Theogony," p. 305; Kirk, p. 228, n. 30 and cf. p. 258. "mixture of personification, allegory, specu- lative myth, fable, literal statement, loose association, intermittent logic, and native shrewdness, was probably around in Greece for a long time before him" (p. 241). Possibly, but this neglects the particular social condi- tions of the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. and the impact of a degree of literacy. Any "mythological stage of Greek thought... when virtually all theorizing took narrative and purely mythological form may have been thousands of years in the past ... possibly far back in the Neolithic Age" (pp. 240-41). Whereas the usual reaction to the "rarity of deeply imaginative fantasy" is to congratulate the Greeks on their civilized and rational approach, or to suppose that censorship has been at work in Greek culture (and in the sense that we do not have certain kinds of popular storytelling this is surely true), K. supposes that the Greeks must have passed through such a stage in the distant past with- out which "they could never have become the people they were" (p. 244). I do not see why this must be true, nor that the Greeks or any other people must have passed through such a stage. But granted that the Greek forms of imaginative narrative had a long history, one needs to ask why this should have been so. K. by eschewing historical problems avoids the question entirely.6 On the other hand, he makes a useful distinction between the long stage of selecting and codification culminating in Homer and Hesiod and the reinterpretation of the great tragedians, on whom his brief comments (pp. 250-51) are most suggestive and make one look forward to what K. may write on tragedy in the future. For him, drama is far removed from "the genuine mythopoeic urge"; if, however, one sees each rendering of a myth as in a sense a new creation by a myth- maker, and one does not posit a stage of human thought when rational processes are excluded from speculation (that of "pure myth") and subsequent stages where rational processes are allowed, one is free to see the great dramatists as supreme fashioners of myth. 6. I do not see how K. can speak of his as "a primarily historical approach," p. 252.</page><page sequence="7">154 BOOK REVIEWS In the final chapter (vi) K. first provides an admirable summary of what he has accom- plished so far, adding some speculation on the function of myth as he has defined it, and then proceeds to consider the sources of imagina- tion and fantasy by way of a critique of the theories of Cassirer and Jung. From Cassirer he retains only the notion that mythical thinking is distinguished "as much by its concept of causality as by its concept of object" (p. 268). From Jung he would salvage tentatively the notion of archetypes, by seeing them as an instinctual tendency to form symbols and especially, following Piaget, as "the result of common processes of sym- bolic assimilation in childhood" (p. 276). Such an approach may help to explain the widespread recurrence of certain motifs, such as that of the separation of earth and sky, without resort to theories of widespread cultural diffusion. On the other hand, K. effectively rejects the universality of most symbols proposed by Jung and his school; and, for their notion of static symbols which in themselves give significance to myth, he substitutes one of complex, dynamic, and allegorical references, more in accord with the structural interpretation of myth. K. recognizes the importance of the individual storyteller (p. 282), but beyond that I am not persuaded by most of his speculation. He concludes that "in the end the firmest part of our study will continue to be the careful and sympathetic analysis of actual documents, surviving myths themselves" (p. 285). Certainly this is true of K.'s own work, and one hopes that others will follow his example and profit from the great progress he has achieved in criticizing and applying current theory to Greek myth. Undoubtedly, he has succeeded in showing the presence of Levi-Strauss's 'serious speculative or preoccupation-reflect- ing undertone" in Mesopotamian and even Greek mythology. My reservations concern what K. overtly excludes from consideration: social history, religion and ritual, "narration for its own sake," the role of the particular poet or myth- maker. K. would probably say that he wishes to isolate the "purely mythical." It is doubts of the value of such isolation and even more of the numerous unexamined assumptions about what is excluded that leave this reviewer unsatisfied with K.'s own theoretical contri- butions. What he offers by way of criticism and example is enough of itself to make this the most important book I know of for the student of Greek mythology. MICHAEL H.
