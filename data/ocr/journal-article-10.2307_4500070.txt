IIs emportent notre Or, laissent des Assignats. Nos cris sont 6touff6s par des Assassinats.1 A new character came on the scene, masked. It was the end of a certain kind of tragedy; comedy began, with shadow play, faceless voices, impalpable entities.2 (Michel Foucault) This article examines a distinct genre of images which emerged on the Parisian print market in the protracted period of uneasy consensus which followed the end of the Jacobin Terror. These images, such as Valeur des assignats et autres papiers monnaies, depuis 'e'poque de leur emission en France, jusqu' a celle ou ils ont cesse' d'avoir Cours (Fig. 1), represented the paper culture of the French Revolution, in particular its various attempts at a paper currency, as layered trompe-l'oeils, and the prints were issued in a range of formats. Although some examples, such as Valeur des assignats, represent the paper notes in mint condition, others, for instance Fran9ois Bonneville's Tableau d'assignats avec portraits de victimes et de profiteurs (Fig. 2), depict them as a dog-eared debris. The money represented in these trompe-l'oeil images, the assignat, had been withdrawn from circulation and destroyed in large quantities shortly before the images began to appear. At once successful commodities in a re-emergent market for luxury products and striking stylistic anomalies within the wider field of print production, I contend that these trompe-l'oeil images were also sites for the production of memory, and that they materialise a traumatic engagement with the revolutionary past. Valeur des assignats, produced at least six years after Bonneville's image, exposes the ways in which this engagement changed across time. Furthermore, as printed images which document the traces of other, recently defunct fragments of printed paper with an excessive clarity, a certain amount of temporal and conceptual slippage occurs between the trompe-l'oeil images and their subject matter, forcing the viewer to engage with the representative function of both. In an important recent article, Rebecca Spang contests commonplace assumptions about the ways in which money is remembered, the presumed existence of an 'economic unconscious', and the effortlessness with which historians have thought the French people to have been 'traumatized' by their economic past. 'Of what' Spang asks, 'are economic memories made?'3 Spang's approach to these questions covers different ground to my argument here, yet I believe that the images I discuss may be able to provide something else in the way of a response. The trompe-l'oeil images, usually presented as little more than novelties, or, confusing subject matter and representation, as 'ephemeral', represent an attempt on behalf of revolutionary artists and audiences to make something substantive of the economic past, to hypostatise memory, and by doing so, to 'think' the Revolution's relationship to history - its successes, failures and inheritances.

The trompe-l'oeil prints appear, to borrow Freud's formulation, to represent a kind of visual acting-out, or repetition, in the place of coherent, unambiguous remembrance, a practice we might consider part of a reparative process aimed towards accommodating revolutionary trauma.4 These contradictory and oblique images try, yet often fail, to articulate clearly the relationship between economics, politics, visuality and loss in the French Revolution. Last rites On 19 February 1796, 30 pluvilse year IV by the Republican calendar, a huge pile of money was set alight in Paris, on Place des Piques, formerly (and subsequently) known as Place Vend6me. As a large crowd gathered, an official lit the furnace with funereal ceremony, whilst nearby the plates, casts, watermarks and stamps with which the money had been made, thirty thousand pieces in total, were broken, burnt and melted down, to the sound of public rejoicing and cries of 'vive la libert' !s5 Given the sacrificial nature of this ritual, the processional devices which had preceded it, and the sense of communality engendered by the potlatch destruction of wealth - not to mention an accidental temporal coincidence with the banned pre-Lenten carnival - the characterisation of the ceremony by some commentators as the last great festival of the French Revolution appears justified.6 4.

The victim of this iconoclastic flourish was the assignat, the state bond turned national currency which in various forms since 1789 sustained the French economy, its value based on funds raised by the sale of clerical and, later, aristocratic lands reclaimed in the name of the Revolution. The assignat was also ultimately a symptom, and for some a primary cause, of that economy's failure. Although the hyperbolic eulogy given by Minister of Finances Ramel-Nogaret at the ceremony of the assignat's destruction, his claim that: 'The assignats made the Revolution. They brought about the destruction of orders and of privileges, they overturned the throne and founded the Republic,' smacked of political spin, it did point to the very real historical agency of the assignat.7 As early as 1792 Louis-Sebastien Mercier had similarly recognised the importance of the confiscation of church properties, noting how 'this unique resource consolidated the power of the National Assembly, in that it destroyed the hopes of those who desired its dissolution, in order to perpetuate the Ancien Regime and its abuses'.8 Initially conceived as a temporary measure, the assignat was an interest-bearing bond which was supposed to be withdrawn in 1791 after the first sales of national properties had raised enough for the revolutionary Caisse de l'Extraordinaire - set up in December 1789 to manage the sale of church lands - to repay in a manageable way the short-term loan owed by the government to the Caisse d'Escompte, the bank founded by Necker and Turgot in 1776.9 This circulation of arrears mirrored the transformation of land into paper sign, and ultimately the corresponding shift from clerical or aristocratic authority to revolutionary sovereignty.

Many bemoaned the inability of the assignat to compete with the value of 'hard' currency, the perceived flimsy materiality of the paper note failing to generate the symbolic authority of rare coinage, whilst the bad memory of John Law's ill-fated bank, based on a paper money scheme, still reverberated noisily in the claims of anti-assignat politicians and pamphleteers. The psychological inheritance of Law's disastrous issue of paper money in 1716, and the collapse of his bank in 1720 seemed to provide a premonition of the depreciation and iconoclasm which were to await the assignat itself.11 In the 1790s there are reports of Law's failed banknotes found still attached to primitive pillories in rural areas, an indication of the anthropomorphic potential of money, but more particularly, of the reproach and suspicion with which paper money continued to be held in France.N The assignat was a contested object, whose authority was conceived and received in visual terms, as a representation of a transformed and transparent polity, and many prominent artists, including Jacques-Louis David, who represented one as an attribute of the martyr Jean-Paul Marat in 1793, were involved in the effort to render the assignat immune to politically motivated counterfeiting.13 Inevitably perhaps, counter-revolutionary forces fighting in the Vend&amp;e soon appropriated the form of the assignat as a symbol of resistance, issuing notes which bore the Dauphin's profile and prominent fleurs-de-lys.14 Use of the assignat had signified personal patriotism, economic survival and the Revolution's successful transformation of signs, however, the financial strain engendered by counterfeiting, war and speculation, and the assignat's corresponding over-issue, brought about a calamitous depreciation. Thousands were ruined by the assignat's collapse and on 10 pluvi6se year IV (30 January 1796) the Council of the Five Hundred finally voted for the withdrawal of the assignat and the destruction of all remaining notes. At stake here is value, both economic and social. The post-Thermidorean period in France was characterised by a crisis in authority which frequently resulted in negative definition. Following the stark clarity of moral choice under the Terror, it was unclear exactly what a Thermidorean political position should be, as the Directoire sought to generate a compromise between oppositional political ideologies inherited from previous regimes. As Georges Lefebvre observed, despite the Directoire's desire to distance itself from the excesses of 1793-4, the Terror was unable to end, because it was 'too much in the interests' of those who followed to replay its crimes over and over again as a rite of self-definition.is In print culture, the vilification of figures such as Robespierre, his characterisation as an effeminate, degenerate blood-drinker, suggested both the lurking anxiety over the status of embodiment which typified the post-Terror climate of recriminations and revenge violence, and pointed towards a deeply-felt desire to promote shared practices and beliefs.16 Ideally, given the regenerative and communal aspirations underlying the issue of the assignat, it might have seemed to provide the ideal foundation for ideological consensus. But times had changed, and money was a major and predictably divisive problem, exacerbated in the year from 1795 to 1796 by widespread and debilitating famine, which intensified after the delegitimisation of the assignat and appeared to induce a correspondingly negative effect on the psychic state of the poverty-stricken. As Denis 10.

Yet it was the Terror period itself which was the main referent in most interpretations of these phenomena. Philippe Pinel's early psychiatric experiments drew direct links between the trauma caused by the Terror period and post-revolutionary mental health in terms which, as Ewa Lajer-Burcharth has shown, pre-dated Freud's work on mourning and melancholia, and the inability of the mourning subject to renounce a lost object.9 Pinel describes the case of a man, who, during manic episodes, recounted at length the events of the Revolution, with all the 'force, dignity and purity of language' one might associate with a profoundly knowledgeable person of 'the sanest judgement.' In all other circumstances, Pinel notes, this man was thoroughly 'ordinary'.20 Such outbursts, enacting revolutionary events in a repetitious and comprehensive manner, against a backdrop of habitual conformity, were, as we shall see, discernable symptoms in revolutionary visual culture, and might be specifically located in trompe-l'oeil representations of assignats. Although Pinel does not explicitly mention the devaluation of the assignat as a cause of mental illness, of the cases analysed at the Bicetre hospital in the year III, aside from those he explicitly attributes to the events of the Revolution, amongst which the assignat must be included, are those brought about by vaguer causes such as the sudden thwarting of elevated ambition (a speculator's malady if there ever were one) and domestic unhappiness; aetiologies which might in many instances have been derived from the effects of the assignat's devaluation.21 The trauma caused by the depreciation of the assignats was multiple, both a social and an emotional response to the deterioration of their economic worth, and, collapsing past and present, an alienated reaction to the perceived failure of the Revolution itself. In the assimilation of the ruin of the assignat with the process of Revolution itself, the traumatic response to the depreciation conflated both an uncomfortable delayed echo of the Terror's parallel debasement of revolutionary principles, and a paradoxically nostalgic response to the disintegration of a repressive regime which had at least, with the maximum and strict economic policing, attempted to stabilise rather than polarise wealth, something the bourgeois mandate of the Directoire had not been able to achieve. Patrice Higonnet has recently attempted to re-explain the Terror via a sophisticated reclamation of the 'Young Marx' theory of revolutionary violence. For Karl Marx, the Terror was a consequence of the Jacobin inability to reconcile individual bourgeois rights with universalist values, a response predicated on fear. Engels writing to Marx in 1870, reiterated this principle, stating that: 'We take it to mean the rule of the people who inspire Terror. On the contrary, it is the rule of people who are themselves terror-stricken [.. .] I am convinced that we can attribute almost in its entirety the reign of Terror anno 1793 to petit-bourgeois philistines who have soiled their trousers from fear'.22 For Higonnet, this disjuncture was traumatic, and a response to the violence which had pervaded French society since 1789, for 'the realization that the entire reshaping of the Revolutionaries' sense of self might have been useless or misguided was more than many Revolutionaries could bear'.23 The Terror was not only productive of trauma, it resulted from it too, and its aftermath could only be more 17.

Accordingly, loss had an established language in 1796, inevitably informed by the recurrent experience of Terror. The process of allocating blame for the demise of the assignat indiscriminately recalled horrors which were in the process of being forgotten, officially at least. The fire ceremony of February 1796 signalled a rupture. It was intended to register a self-conscious break with the past, a sacrificial renewal which would allow the assignat's successor as national currency, the largely identical (and equally ruinous) mandats territoriaux, to prosper in its absence.24 Yet if the legislative bodies responsible for the assignat's destruction thought a bonfire of notes could erase the memory of the recent past, neutralising the association of the national currency with deprivation and political violence - the self-conscious forgetting of previous ways of doing things is after all the great revolutionary conceit - they were mistaken. Forgetting was impossible in the first instance because the wholesale eradication of the assignat was in fact a fiction: the notes themselves were not demonetised straight away, continuing to circulate until at least July 1796, longer in practice, and at the point of their exchange for mandats territoriaux in May there were still known to be twenty-three billion francs worth of assignats in circulation. Secondly, the assignat retained a residual visibility, lingering to trouble the consensus which was the desired outcome of its orchestrated symbolic 'death', by way of its presence, and, I argue, significant critical potential as a subject of contemporary print culture. Afterlife In the months following the ritual incineration of the assignats a number of unusual images began to appear in the printshops of Directoire Paris, images which were only made possible by the assignat's demise, but whose motifs were to be recycled productively throughout the next decade. Directly derived from well-known and standardised practices of trompe-l'oeil, and making use of basic representational conventions for the two-dimensional depiction of paper fragments which persist to this day, these images depart nonetheless from the generic to engage directly with the specialised, emotive and self-consciously historical field of revolutionary politics. Valeur des assignats (Fig. 1), number one hundred and twenty-three of the famous sequential print series Tableaux historiques de la Revolution francaise is representative of this type of image, despite its decidedly uncanny presence in a publication which was otherwise devoted to narrative topography and portraiture.25 The basic format of this image is a high-end repetition of the numerous trompe-l'oeil designs of varying size and quality which had been reproduced on fans, labels for tobacco or makeup boxes and single sheet prints, sometimes featuring a calendar or a detailed account of the assignat's demise, or overlaid with a ragged peripatetic figure whose destitution bore witness to the financial wreckage brought about by the depreciation of the assignat. With this theme in mind one such image dramatically polarises the relative fortunes of a speculator, shown hoarding his cash on the right-hand side, with a well-dressed beggar, cap-in-hand, and a poverty-stricken citizen at a bare table on the left (Fig. 2). Yet in Tableau 123 the assignats, mandats and promissory notes of the Revolution are laid on top of one another on a black background, with no reference to objects or events outside the immediate frame of the image. As Norman Bryson has observed, trompe-l'oeil asserts the 24. On mandats territoriaux see: Judith A. Miller, 'The Aftermath of the Assignat: Plaintiffs in the Age of Property, 1794-1804', in: Judith A. Miller and Howard G.

The numbering of the Tableaux remained the same until the 1817 edition, at which point the prints were numbered through with the addition of nine tableaux prdliminaires, making this image number 132. 360 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007</page><page sequence="7">Trompe-l'Oeil and Trauma autonomy of the deteriorating objects which constitute its subject matter.26 In trompe-l'oeil, we are led to see objects as they 'really are', when our backs are turned. A haphazard impression is created by the overlapping of the notes, although a closer inspection reveals that the assignats (assuming we buy into the conceit that they ever existed as such) are clearly very carefully composed, their edges infringing upon one another but not to the extent that each note cannot be identified with ease. At the centre of the image the curled border of a seven hundred and fifty livres note articulates three-dimensionality, and provides the only point of bodily intrusion on the scene, the rolling of the note accomplished not mechanically, but by anxious fingers. Yet on this particular version of the print, a faint and illegible signature, scrawled across the note at a later date, adamantly re-asserts the flatness of the image, spoiling the illusion even as it emphasises a tactile register, and echoing in the process the numerous signatures printed on the trompe-l'oeil notes. Filling a greater proportion of the paper surface than its neighbours, and titled in a different typeface, of the 145 narrative prints and sixty-seven portraits published in the Tableaux between 1791 and 1817 this is also the only image to be consistently hand-coloured, emphasising further its difference from the other prints in the series. The total lack of recent and historical comment on Valeur des assignats is remarkable, and it is seldom reproduced alongside the better-known designs of artists such as Prieur, Berthault, Girardet and Swebach- Desfontaines in the Tableaux. As an anomaly whose diachronic title and subject matter contrast with the selection of synchronic pivotal events with accompanying explanatory texts in which the Tableaux traded, the image was not subject to direct piracy in the major derivative versions which circulated in Europe throughout the 1790s, the Tafereelen van de Staatsomwenteling in Frankrijk (1794-1807) and the Denkbuch der Franzoesischen Revolution (1817-1819).27 The atypical irruption of this image into the series seems to mirror the desired rupture effected by the assignat's destruction. Despite differences in subject matter, from battle scenes to executions, festivals to famous speeches, the plates in the series were produced according to a relatively uniform aesthetic, narrative action occurring within a perspectivally ordered scene, usually represented from a distance, and regulated by a panoramic background of identifiable architecture or landscape. Valeur des assignats also demonstrates a characteristic attention to the minutiae of daily life, albeit in far sharper focus, and, perhaps, in its massing of objects, a schematic reiteration of the crowd scenes so prevalent throughout the Tableaux. Yet the absolute removal of human context, explanatory narrative or background in the image, and the abrupt transition to a flattened, close-up, self-consciously illusionistic rather than ostensibly 'realistic' format, suggest that this subject could not be accommodated seamlessly, and that the assignat required a distinct representational lexicon to that used for all the other prints in the series. Prints which depict assignats were not an unknown quantity prior to 1796, although as the case of a young deaf-mute man arrested in a cake shop in the harsh winter of 1795 and tried early in 1796 for crudely drawing and attempting to spend assignats to the value of forty-five livres demonstrates, the copying of notes, however unsophisticated, was equated with counterfeiting, which was punishable by death.28 By virtue of legal proscription assignats already operated apart from conventional image-making, yet at the same time were intimately tied up with debates on the nature of representation, long before this self-awareness was reinforced by their reproduction in 26.

Since the start of the decade the assignat had been a staple of counter-revolutionary publishers' attempts to demean the Revolution, and they were often incorporated into caricatural attacks upon the revolutionary body politic. However, the existence of such images fails to account for the seemingly unmotivated appearance of Valeur des assignats in a publication sympathetic to the Revolution, and otherwise devoted to documentary truth to form, landscape structure and historical event. Tableau sixty-eight (Fig. 3), for example, Prieur and Berthault's representation of the removal of the statue of Louis XIV on the Place des Victoires, is a typically perspectival and geographically specific work from the Tableaux, which represents Revolutionary violence against images in a far more orthodox way than Tableau 123. As it happens, both these prints are, however obliquely, connected to the spatial politics of the life cycle of the assignat. From 1792 assignats had been made in reclaimed convents and monasteries on the Place des Victoires and on the former Place Vend6me. The transformation of church buildings into centres for assignat production replayed symbolically the appropriation of church property on which the original issue of assignats had been based, a symbolic transformation in the guise of financial compulsion which had by this point become familiar from projects such as a 1791 proposal to melt down the church bells of France into coins which could be used in exchange for small denomination assignats.29 Consequently, a train of memories was established, each one inverting a previously dominant code. The political authority of the original assignat relied on the memory of the reclaimed land for which it stood. The Revolution of 1792 employs the memory of the assignat's origins in its choice of site for manufacture, and four years later the revolutionary legislature return to one of these spaces, this time to destroy, not make, the once-precious currency. 29.

In contrast, the bonfire of assignats in the former Place Vend6me defies representation, its destruction of Revolutionary symbolism an admission of defeat, and all we are left with in images such as Valeur des assignats is a fractured distillation of narrative, devoid of reference to a specific time and place. Significantly, the actual destruction of assignats was rarely represented, and when such images did appear, they were some time after the event, and directed at an overseas print market, a repression which resurfaced in the fetishistic representation of the defunct notes in the proliferating trompe-l'oeil prints, and their subsequent incursion into more formal historical narratives. Mysteriously, the 1798 prospectus for the Tableaux historiques had announced that Tableau 123 would be a print representing the breaking of the assignat printing plates on 30 pluviose year IV, yet by the time of the print's appearance, its subject had been changed, replacing the painful and specific with the general and abstract.so It seems that despite the official joy occasioned by the ritual, it could not transcend the negative implications of the assignat's failure. A trace of this amendment remains, as late as the 1817 edition of the Tableaux, in the text accompanying the image, whose concise explanation of the destruction of the assi nat plates jars with the avoidance of the subject in the accompanying image. Valeur des assignats, and particularly its incongruous publication as number one hundred and twenty-three of the Tableaux historiques, are demonstrative of the complicated ways in which the shifting signifiers of revolutionary representations could be mobilised to articulate both the continuities and radical disjunctures of the revolutionary period. This is an image whose subject and site of publication address at every level the passage of time, and whose interpretation was inevitably dependent on the timing of the print's appearance. Although the publication of a print about assignats had been announced in 1798, the print was eventually issued in the 1802 edition of the Tableaux historiques. As a result, this is a print which is at once both a representative example of, and an image about, the trompe-l'oeil images (such as Fig. 2) produced in the immediate aftermath of the assignat's destruction. Viewed in 1802, and again in the edition of 1804, the year of Napoleon's proclamation of himself as Emperor, this image would have referenced not only a revolutionary past figured through its paper fragments - the subject of the print - but would have also acted as a reminder of the similar prints, by this point outmoded, which had populated the market some years previously and their attempts to represent in analogous fashion the economic course of Revolution. It is additionally unusual for this reason, for whilst a protracted gap between announcement and actual publication was customary for this series, imitation or replication of other prints was not. In fact, originality of design was vital to the marketability of the series, and the cycle of appropriation of themes and images tended to spiral outwards from the successful Tableaux to its European competitors. So, how to explain the reappearance of this image in the early nineteenth century, if it is to be anything other than pastiche or opportunism? In a recent book, Deborah Jenson isolates what she refers to as 'traumatic mimesis', a form of repetition (in this case literary) which results from trauma. The French Revolution's status as 'original' engenders anxiety amongst those who follow. As she explains: 'Traumatic mimesis is partly, for the inheritors of Revolutionary history, simply the trauma of experiencing 30.

This is a form of repetitive play with the conditions and signs of traumatic mimesis. Mimetic trauma, "borrowed" social suffering, performs the seductions of empathy with the trauma experienced by the social "other ". 33 Whilst Jenson's narrative, which seeks to explain the engagement of Romantic writers with the trauma of the revolutionary past, is defined by a significant temporal break between the primordial event or trauma, and its mimetic representation, the trompe-l'oeil assignats produced after 1796 are firmly entrenched within a more compacted history, but one that is mimetic across time nonetheless. The assignat, which encapsulates to a certain extent the originary myths and fantasies of the French Revolution, also operates as a space for imagining and empathising with the 'social other'. In other words, the ways in which the assignat mediated trauma and alienation for revolutionaries and royalists informed one another. However, the reappearance of this print-form in 1802 suggests that the utility of the assignat, and, more particularly, the image of the assignat, was not exhausted, and that we might think of it usefully as materialising 'mimetic trauma', re-rehearsing the traumatic repetitions of 1796 from a position of relative stability under the Consulate. This repetitious mimicry is one of the ways in which this image operates mnemonically, but it also suggests an entrypoint into a discussion of the suitability of trompe-l'oeil for this task. False impressions That this composite representation of the paper money of the Revolution is executed in trompe-l'oeil suggests that it is, at one level, a self-aware demonstration of artistic skill, an advertisement of technical proficiency in a recently resuscitated market, by Benizy, known as Dubuisson, its little-known designer and engraver. Indeed, the subject matter of Valeur des assignats appears to allude to such self-referential commodification; and certainly, the Tableaux were marketed to a relatively well-off bourgeois clientele who would have been particularly aware of the opportunities afforded by a more open economic climate, and alert to the extent to which the assignat had created as well as decimated fortunes. The image is in fact structurally similar to eighteenth-century English 'medley' prints, which likewise used the illusionistic representation of print to advertise artists and print retailers.34 Benizy, by whom few works are known (a portrait of Emmanuel Kant, and a bureaucratic vignette for the Depots Nationaux Litt.raires), produced no other prints for the Tableaux, unusual in a publication which encouraged artist loyalty. Whilst a 'Dubuisson' was in fact amongst the many signatories of assignats, in advance of the introduction of stereotype printing these signatories were commonly selected on account of especially beautiful handwriting, rather than in accordance to seniority or appropriateness to the task.3s The quotidian subject matter of the image conforms to standard conventions for trompe-l'oeil representation, popularised in France before the Revolution in small-scale paintings by artists such as Gresly and Doncre, and well-known at this time through the work of Boilly in particular.36 Identified with luxury trades, trompe-l'oeil was used to decorate a range of objects, and in keeping with its classical and Renaissance associations, remained a popular form of architectural embellishment. During the Revolution, trompe-l'oeil frequently 32.

Although a circumstantial conjecture that the artist of Valeur des assignats had been involved in assignat production at some level is tempting, a more likely candidate for the signing of the assignat is Pierre-Ulric Dubuisson, a Jacobin and sectional militant tried and executed as a Hebertist in 1794.

However, the use of trompe-l'oeil in this context was specifically criticised, as it corresponded to a deceitful and impermanent form of simulation with potentially anti-revolutionary associations - notwithstanding the impression given in the many printed representations of the event, where the fragile reality of the arch is rendered as if monumentally solid. 37 Susan Siegfried has recounted the criticism levelled at Boilly for his trompe-l'oeil designs, which, in the post-revolutionary art world, were attacked as representative of 'philistine' taste, appealing to a bourgeois market whose values were far removed from the high moral tone required by the Salon.38 To contemporary critics, trompe-l'oeil appeared remote in intention from the grand aims of history painting. Its small scale, humble subject matter and apparent lack of artistic imagination or design suggested an art form which could not aspire to the instruction of heroic citizens, whilst its association by default with a frivolous royal clientele rendered it politically suspect. Of course, neoclassicism was not immune from illusionism, its historicist verisimilitude peaking in David's 1799 private exhibition of his Intervention of the Sabine Women in front of a large mirror, placed, according to the critic Chaussard, so that viewers could imagine themselves part of the work. Male viewers of this painting are reported to have examined its unnaturally smooth surface through lorgnettes, whilst female viewers observed it closely through magnifiers hidden in fans, as if seeking to uncover the brushwork which would destroy the illusion.39 Nevertheless, the Sabines was conceived within very different traditions of artistic education and production from small-scale trompe-l'oeil designs, whilst their relative ownership and audience polarised the public to the private. Consequently, trompe-l'oeil, despite its survival during and after the Revolution, was not a genre considered suitable to the task of revolutionary representation. As a debased form of representation in 1796, at least according to the criteria which determined ambitious, classically informed and politically minded Salon painting, trompe-l'oeil would have nevertheless appeared eminently suitable to the representation of decrepit, two-dimensional objects. Trompe-l'oeil has an internalised representational strategy which conforms to a limited set of rules. Indeed, its formal conventions are so adamantly imposed that its practitioners have been accused of prioritising a hermetic form of regulated intellectual exercise over any notion of artistic independence or creativity, trompe-l'oeil challenging further representational convention by way of its disposable subject matter and simulative challenges to an external standard of the 'real'.40 Simultaneously drawing attention to the commodity status of both the image and its subject matter, whilst referencing a certain draining of exchange value in its defunct knick-knacks, trompe-l'oeil also tends to resist narrative, focusing on an obsessive, fetishised object, or set of objects, which are not figured as elements of a story that continues beyond the boundaries of the frame. Where a narrative is discernible, for instance via the representation of letters and other clearly 'possessed' objects, it usually takes the form of a highly conventionalised memento mori which conceals any deeper narratives beneath a formulaic one. Sometimes conceived as a 'portrait' of an individual via their possessions, the only temporally determined aspect 37. Richard A.

In these terms, Assignats would seem to provide suitable subject matter, having so recently passed into non-use. These images speak of passing, of death, although they do so, I argue, via the mobilisation of a rigid and seemingly repetitive style in the name of an unstable and topical social context. Jean Baudrillard has suggested, in an influential essay, that the generic structure of trompe-l'oeil functions as a means by which we are to 'hallucinate' our own deaths, its formal simulation prompting a metanarrative which can only be morbid and self-reflective, a materialisation of unconscious drives. Following the destruction of the assignat on the pyres of the Place des Piques, the trompe-l'oeil reproduction of the fragile objects Baudrillard terms 'ghosts that haunt the emptiness of the stage'41 could operate at a metaphysical level as a figuration of the transience of existence, or perhaps of the instability of existence as a concept. This is enhanced by the ironic representation of a former sign of exchange value in a format traditionally reserved for objects whose very lack of value is a mainstay of their visual rhetoric. But why assignats? Were they simply offered up as a conventionalised reflection on the futility of wealth in the face of death, their brief topicality providing a nice opportunity for printmakers to make some profit with a pretty straightforward image, the kind with which they were already familiar from migrations of the 'medley' format, or was something more at stake? Was it really possible for such overt visual meditations on mortality, money, obsolescence and personal history to remain value-free after Thermidor, as the unifying analyses of trompe-l'oeil put forward by Baudrillard and others would imply? I would say 'no'. In 1796 assignats were not any old litter, and the poignancy of their disappearance was not limited to the narrow frame of reference within which trompe-l'oeil traditionally constitutes its subjects. Assignats were unavoidably political, and inseparable from both the hopes and failures of the Revolution. Consequently, this immediate and continuing political relevance makes them a strange subject for trompe-l'oeil, whose formal consistency betokens a nostalgia born of conservatism, and an easy reckoning with the fragments of the past. I am not suggesting an iconographical reading of these trompe-l'oeils to counter the argument in favour of trompe-l'oeil's inherent adherence to principles of simulation and psychic economy put forward by Baudrillard, although I do believe it is important to contest the extent to which trompe-l'oeil does effectively simulate its subject, the extent to which it really fools the spectator. Trompe-l'oeil rarely exceeds the limits of pictorial convention, the placing of an image in a frame, failing when faced by a mobile gaze, whilst the spectatorial pleasure it imparts, like a game in which players play not to win, but for love of the game itself, is based more upon an acknowledgement that a deceit has been attempted, rather than the success of that deception.42 More importantly for my purposes here, I want to emphasise how, by virtue of their printed reproduction of print, with assignats often reproduced 'life-size', these images subvert, in any case, the illusionistic transcendence of trompe-l'oeil 'proper', whose effect is based upon the reproduction of an everyday scene or object in a different medium, most commonly paint on canvas. Inadequate trompe-l'oeils (though for convenience I will continue to describe them as such), these images are invested with, and unimaginable without reference to, the histories of the assignat, particularly the anxieties 41.

Indeed, death is inscribed in these prints in ways more concrete than stylistic or generic affiliation - only a few weeks before the production of these images their depiction of paper money would have been construed as counterfeiting, and would have cleared a swift path to the guillotine for the artists and publishers involved. I suggest that the signs of trompe-l'oeil were used in a strategic sense by artists precisely because they were aware of the power of its conventional associations, which serve to mask the real and present anxiety its subject had in this case provoked, and to perform its existence in the past. These are repetitions, not memories, which, by showing the assignat to be obsolete, and the Revolution it represented complete, aim to distance whatever traumas it might represent. This form of repetitive play with the image of the assignat is however active, rather than discretely commemorative, resulting from a proximity to the traumatic experience. As Dominick LaCapra writes: 'In acting-out, the past is performatively regenerated or relived as if it were fully present rather than represented in memory and inscription, and it hauntingly returns as the repressed' . Interestingly, in Valeur des assignats, the notes are pristine, 'fully present', returned to a mint condition which the use of trompe-l'oeil and its associations of desuetude only partially negate. This form of representation ultimately only served to enhance the contemporaneity of the assignat, by creating a dialogue between past and present which made forgetting impossible, and which accentuated an association with revolutionary politics, the Terror and its recriminations in particular. The 'accounting of loss' after the Terror is, I suggest, fundamental to the meaning of the assignats' synthetic reproduction - not without cause did de Sade remind us that one of the nicknames given to the guillotine blade was the 'planche aux assignats'." The cut-up surfaces of the trompe-l'oeil prints speak to this violent fragmentation and dismemberment. The connection between the assignat and the Terror operates nonetheless at a remove, at the level of association and inference, rather than direct correlation. The assignat, it may be said, following T. J. Clark's reading of its central but marginal presence in David's Marat ai son dernier soupir, functions as the repressed object of Terror, here configured as an ambiguous and far from conclusive memorial.45 Whilst themes of temporality and remembrance are inscribed at a stylistic level in an image such as Valeur des assignats, the mystery of the image's presence in the Tableaux is enhanced by its lack of an overt political message, perhaps unsurprising given the time-lapse between the different stages of the print's replication. This apparent intractability and lack of engagement with external issues - thought to be one of the defining features of trompe-l'oeil - contributes to a specious, but as I have suggested, artistically strategic impression that, despite its weirdly disjunctive effect, the commemoration of the assignat in illusionistic space is a logical and intrinsic conclusion to an apolitical material existence. Rather, the 'blankness' of this image expresses an inability, or an unwillingness to remember, to narrate, and exposes a traumatic encounter, not only with the failed assignat, but through it with the continuity of revolutionary history. The trompe-l'oeil designs, especially those, such as Tableau 123, which were part of marketable visual 'histories', demonstrate a desire on the part of artists and consumers to 'deal with' the assignat, to incorporate it fully into a narrative of Revolution and by doing so to neutralise it, 43.

Removed from circulation as a functioning commodity, in these images the assignat is reified as 'art', a subject, rather than means of representation, with significance for an art-buying audience far narrower than the millions who had circulated the assignat itself. Despite the impression of capitalist accumulation given by the 'hoarding' of currency in trompe-l'oeil representation, in this context the layering of the assignat signifies its removal from circulation, historicises it and conflates its many meanings, a removal which transposes the communal memory which the assignat represented to a private sphere of individual contemplation. Such a transition marks a difference from the self-conscious publicness of Jacobin culture, to one characterised by individuation and personal response, a tension dramatised half a century later in the introduction to Jules Michelet's Le Peuple, a plea for universal fraternity which begins with a personalised recollection of the author's father's work in assignat production during the Revolution.46 However, the impenetrable literalness of Valeur des assignats is set into sharp relief by some of the images produced directly after the burning of the assignats, which betray an attempt to make meaning against the specific cultural and political backdrop of the French Revolution. Despite the assignat's introduction well before the Jacobin seizure of power, many images, such as a small circular print (Fig. 4), featuring a grim reaper hovering above a sea of overlaid assignats and tattered portraits blown into disarray by diminutive putti, appear to explicitly associate the obsolescence of the currency with the destruction brought about by the Robespierrist regime, sharing the gothic vitriol of much post-Thermidor print culture. In images such as this we see a negotiation of the symbolic economy of the assignat in which death, mourning and loss are not referred to in an apolitical, non-referential vacuum. The figures of (mostly) dead revolutionaries whose portraits, reminiscent of those published in the Tableaux historiques, float above the assignats are drawn from across the whole range of the political spectrum, from Maury to Lafayette to Robespierre, whilst the constitutions of 1791 and 1793 join the defunct notes as part of the flotsam of Revolution. Yet it is surely not without significance, in the Thermidorean context of the image's production, that only the portraits of Marat and Robespierre, those 'exterminating proconsuls who spread death, mourning and devastation' 47as a contemporary play called them, are cut with the grim reaper's scythe?48 Just as the portraits here map a political history, so assignats, shown together like this, track the progression from Constitutional Monarchy to Convention, via the progression from king's head and fleurs-de-lys to revolutionary language and symbolism - eyes of surveillance, triangles, allegories of justice - printed on the notes. The trauma with which these images engage is polysemic and ambiguous, for the mutability of the assignat as a signifier of loss is such that they function variably as platforms for a range of political positions. The assignat in these images represents the passage of Revolution in all its contradictory aspects, depending on context of display and juxtaposition. For instance, the assignat could serve on one level as a symbol of revolutionary virtue (albeit a devalued one), signifying the collapse of a utopian system which in many accounts quite literally was the Revolution in ideal form. It could also, however, focus the imagination of those bereft at the post-1793 progress of a Revolution they had supported, as well as those for whom the Revolution was always an aberration. 46.

Made to adorn the lid of a tobacco box, the image is round, a shape which forces an ocular association exacerbated by the need for 'hard' looking. Only under the most intensified scrutiny does the image fully reveal itself. At the top left-hand corner of the portrait of Mirabeau, the top left-hand corner of that of Lafayette, the bottom left-hand side of Necker's portrait, and on an assignat between the portraits of Marat and Robespierre, at the torn edges of the frayed paper whose outline is further blurred by the shadow cast by the other fragments, are four silhouette profile portraits, Louis XVI unmistakeable, with the others presumably Marie-Antoinette, Mme Elizabeth or the Dauphin. Look hard, they are intentionally difficult to find. Suddenly every shadow, every rip and fissure, becomes a potential ghostly face, the royal profile emerging, watermark-like, to structure the meaning of the assignat. Royalist memorial imagery (Fig. 5), such as a German print where the silhouette profiles of the royal family appear alongside those of revolutionaries in the spaces outlined by the edges of a shattered Federative altar, complete with splintered fasces and toppled bonnet rouge-cum-jester's cap, repeats this trick - the opaque facial signifiers recalling Louis Marin's elision of difference between 'blank' and blanc.49 Approximately banknote-sized, this sombre print shares a striking formal 49.

Furthermore, it is likely that viewers would have known where and how to look at such images, as the rendering of silhouette profiles was popularly related as a mythical originary point for representation via the story of Dibutades, as well as appearing in illusionistic coptographs, or cut-out shapes, used in magic lantern shows and phantasmagoria, which shared a similarly gothic preoccupation with the dead. Indeed, silhouettes had been fashionable for some time through the technology of the physiognotrace, a popular means of producing silhouette likenesses invented in 1788. As early as 17 Thermidor (4 August 1794), the Gazettefran,caise announced publicly the distribution of a similar engraving, initially confusing, but revealing the 'perfect likenesses' of the royal family 'when you have been initiated into the mystery'.s 5 The large print run of this image - the paper claimed that more than fifty thousand copies would be distributed - and the open announcement of its publication, certainly suggest a degree of familiarity with the form. Between the trompe-l'oeil of 1796, and the trompe-l'oeil of the Consulate and Empire, then, we can see a lessening of direct political reference, or 50.

Certainly, the inclusion of hidden portraits of royal and revolutionary figures waned, although the technique remained fashionable well into the Napoleonic period. Louis-Sebastien Mercier, in Le Nouveau Paris, remarked on this decline in obscured political emblems, suggesting it was a symptom of fatigue with the Revolution itself: 'So many thousands of men who have fallen under it [the Terror] leave no traces; and even regrets for the old regime, if they are ever heard, are become so hackneyed, and aristocratism is descended so low, that no one carries any longer these fans dexterously strewed with flowers-de-luxe, nor those mysterious snuff and confit boxes, which, by a secret spring, discovered the proscribed insignia of royalty'. The assignat itself, though, as Mercier remarked, 'preserved its vital, vivacious character, even in the agony of death'.52 Net-works: Traps for memory To fully understand the meaning of the assignat's return as trompe-l'oeil, we should look elsewhere too, to other areas of visual culture similarly invested in a politics of mourning in the period between the end of the Terror and Napoleon's coup d'dtat. For the mnemonic potential of extreme illusionism, and a concern with the re-use or re-phrasing of medium and materials were not the sole preserves of print culture.

Maybe this is a clue explaining the arrested progress of the game and the desertion of the table? The use of trompe-l'oeil encourages us to supply narrative where it is absent, to fill in the blanks. The weight of symbolism finally destroys the illusion, as the severed card, in the centre of the 'image' is, of course, a king. After this discovery, the table begins to reveal itself, firstly, in terms of what is visible, then in terms of incongruities. The uppermost card of a pile to the top left-hand side carries a naively painted Republican symbol of the militaristic type, a cannon, arms and cockerel. This conceals a card whose legend is only partly visible, and we have to reconstitute the rest from memory or experience. 'Par Palloy' we read, followed by what may be 'dbmolisseur de la Bastille', although only 'de' and the last four letters of 'Bastille' are discernible. This small part of the table surface is layered with meaning, the invocation of the name of Pierre-Franqois Palloy, the builder responsible for the demolition of the Bastille and the commodification of its stones as sculptural relics suggesting a deeper context which closer examination confirms. The surface of the table is made from a polished slab of Bastille stone, upon which the cards are painstakingly painted to create a random effect, fooling the viewer into believing that they are real. This table, made explicitly for the playing of games, is a game in itself. The layering of meaning which this image/object performs establishes it as a site of spectatorial gratification, the construction of the table from an actual piece of the hated prison re-allocating value, and accentuating the utility of the material object itself as a site for the production of memory. The significance of the table's construction, combined with deliberate attempts to complicate, obscure or obstruct access to the meaning of the cards by partially covering over text and image indicate that the table is intentionally 'hard to get', instituting a mode of looking which forces the discovery of Republican symbolism. Repetition here occurs also at a material level, the reconstitution of the Bastille as furniture suggesting a simultaneous attempt to negotiate the past, and an inability to renounce it. Perhaps it is time to consider Edmund Burke's claim that revolutionary politics were transforming France into 'one great play table'," and to bear in mind that the backs of playing cards formed the material base for billets de confiance in advance of the initial issue of assignats. In the bottom left-hand corner of Tableau 123, a playing card, augmented with manuscript additions, can be clearly seen peeking beneath more conventional money forms. For playing cards read money, and vice versa. Palloy himself had used playing cards as commodified and transferable identity cards for his workers demolishing the Bastille. These cards were often counterfeited or sold, not least by Palloy himself, to tourists eager to view the cells of the Bastille by night.s4 In an environment characterised by speculation, corruption and depreciation, widespread gambling, profiteering and sharp practice of this kind found a ready market. Against this background of paranoia and double-bluffing, I want to make the case that the trompe-l'oeil images of paper money attempt a cross-media replication of a visual economy which had been established by the assignats themselves, and that this was essential to their processing of the alienation to which both the destruction of the assignats and the experience of Terror contributed. The significance of these prints is not determined by the passive image of the assignat, but the politicised ways of 53.

The formal, layered arrangement of the notes in these prints inaugurates a mode of looking which arrests the gaze, 'trapping' it in a net of fractured, compound subjects - rather than fooling, defeating or diverting it, as the generic categorisation as trompe-l'oeil might suggest. The viewer is encouraged to take a position, to identify with an assignat from a particular phase of the Revolution as a sign of their own allegiance. Such a formal 'layering' as a means of situating subjectivity had parallels in other areas of material culture around this time, for instance the incorporation of the woven hair of dead revolutionaries and royalists alike into elaborate reliquaries or jewellery which in many cases echoed formally the methodically superimposed fragments of the trompe-l'oeil images, the intertwined hair of the victim forming a lattice whose t*ihtness and resistance to separation rendered ephemeral fragments solid. Similarly, Alexandre Lenoir's subjective assemblage of sculptural and corporeal remnants (for many of the tombs contained bodies) at his Musee des monuments frangais in the monastery of the Petits-Augustins, approved in 1796, charged juxtaposed fragments with the task of representing collective memory. We might also consider the disturbing composite imagery of drownings, burnings and executions which illustrated the journalist Louis-Marie Prudhomme's encyclopaedic, if exaggerated audit of Terrorist violence in his Histoire gendrale et impartiale des erreurs, desfautes et des crimes commis pendant la Re'volution (Fig. 7), an account of atrocity whose main task, like the trompe-l'oeil prints, is a figuration of memory based on the model of a divided, politically partisan, revolutionary subjectivity.-7 The anthropologist Alfred Gell has observed how 'not designed to communicate or function as a sign (in fact, designed to be hidden and escape notice), the trap nonetheless signifies far more intensely than most 58 signs intended as such'.8 The tricks, ghosts and absences of the trompe-l'oeils, their hidden messages and lurking faces, are replete with meaning, not empty of it as their obsolescence might at first suggest, functioning as traps which detain the viewing subject, forcing a subjective, politically orientated identification with the recent past. Gell adds: 'Moreover, we are able to see that each [trap] is not only a model of its creator, a subsidiary self in the form of an automaton, but each is also the model of its victim'. Echoing Walter Benjamin's claim that 'genuine memory must [...] yield an image of the person who remembers', both viewer and assignat are trapped in the trompe-l'oeil, just as the notes themselves had ensnared their viewers. For entrapment was, of course, a characteristic of the assignat, in the 'deliberate mistakes' which enticed counterfeiters to produce copies more accurate than the originals, and in the complex hidden nets of the watermarks, designed to trick counterfeiters with a kind of legitimised dissimulation. This was an ambiguity embodied in the incitement to 'patriotic duplicity' printed on the surface of all assignats: 'the law punishes the counterfeiter with death/the nation rewards the informer'. In assignat production paper was no longer to be reduced to what Derrida termed 'the function or topos of an inert surface laid under marks, a substratum designed to uphold them, to assure their survival or subsistence'.61 Inlaid watermarks bearing patriotic inscriptions functioned as 'webs' to snare counterfeiters, the intricate wirefligranes often taking years to make, by which time, like the trompe-l'oeil assignats, their value was solely aesthetic.62 As a five hundred livres note from the year II, designed by Thibault and Pressavin (Fig. 8), reveals, their function was entirely dependent on spectatorial 55.

Ironically, this served to accentuate the fragility and ephemerality of the paper support, diminishing its authority as hard cash. In addition to the watermark, other technical features such as the timbre sec and timbre identique both subverted or altered the physical integrity of the surface of the paper rather than printing on it. These embossed inkless stamps were the primary site of artistic contribution to the assignat, and imprinted the absent coin on the new paper currency. Eager to replicate the prestige of the coin, the timbre sec performed a play at three-dimensionality which is echoed in the illusionism of the trompe-l'oeil. Assignats were designed for close examination, and it is unsurprising that the trompe-l'oeil images, particularly those small tabatidre prints which 374 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 30.3 2007</page><page sequence="21">Trompe-l'Oeil and Trauma Fig. 8.

In one print (Fig. 9) a pair of spectacles lie abandoned on an assignat and playing card trompe-l'oeil, as if the owner has momentarily put them down after a period of concentrated examination, only for the glasses themselves to become incorporated into the illusion. As a physiognomically informed obituary of Robespierre, narrated by James H. Johnson, suggests, the wearing of spectacles could evoke a politicised scopophilic anxiety very much in tune with revolutionary unease about hidden or masked subjects and meanings: 'He was crime incarnate. He covered his eyes with spectacles to keep people from looking into his soul'.63 The playing card on the right-hand side of the print, inscribed with a reference to the devaluation of public assets, 'Fortune public ruine', is an example of a 'bon' or promissory playing card, exchangeable, in this case, for food. 'Bon pour un dejeuner sur le carreau', it reads at the base. 'Carreau' which means a diamond card (and also evokes 'carreaux', vernacular for spectacles), directs attention to the illusory and ludic aspects of the assignat's value. Furthermore, to be left 'sur le carreau', an expression derived from Ancien-R'gime judicial procedure, signals that one has been put to one side, discarded, forgotten, or rendered unemployed.

In 1796, shortly after the performative staging of the assignat's demise on the Place des Piques, the terse statement of abandonment on this trompe-l'oeil playing card is an eloquent marker of the disenfranchisement which attended the assignat's destruction. One of the cards painted on Palloy's trompe-l'oeil table also employs this phrasing, although to more explicitly 'patriotic' ends - 'sur le * est I'aristocrate' it reads. However, the arrest in June 1798 of one Bevalet, a porcelain merchant on the rue de la Lanterne, for displaying outside his shop a print 'depreciating paper money' complete with 'a ten of diamonds on which was written - public fortune, ruined etc,' demonstrates how the ambiguity of the trompe-l'oeil format, and its prioritisation of interpretation, encouraged responses which were inevitably subjective, political, and historically contingent.64 The playful polysemy of these images, and the others like them, belies the extent to which they negotiated diverse political and historical positions, and how, for a relatively brief but highly significant period after 1796, trompe-l'oeil representations of paper money were prominent cultural mediators of revolutionary trauma. Reproduced in different forms into the early nineteenth-century, they provided a visual language for revolutionaries and those who opposed the Revolution to articulate, if not resolve, alienation and grief across a range of cultural products, offering, in the process, a privileged site to think through what it meant to be 'post-revolutionary'.
