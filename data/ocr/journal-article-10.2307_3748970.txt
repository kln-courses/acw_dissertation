<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS A Study of History. By ARNOLD TOYNBEE. Vols. VII-X (Oxford University Press, i7 IOs.) In the earlier volumes of A Study of History, Professor Toynbee defined the breakdown of civilizations as "failures in the audacious attempts to ascend from the level of primitive humanity to the height of some superhuman kind of living." He further spoke of such breakdowns in "non-material" terms as the "loss of creative power in the souls of creative individuals or minorities, which divests them of their magic power to influence the souls of the un- creative masses." However questionable may be the assumptions of this view- point, it nevertheless seemed apparent that the writer of the study deplored the breakdowns and failures, and did not invite us to rejoice at them. Yet even in an early volume [Vol. V, part 5] he had hinted at a view which regards the world as well lost and which cuts across the allegedly empirical definition of civilizations as a species of society: churches, too, he suggested, were represen- tatives of another species of society, as distinct from the species civilizations as the latter were from primitive societies. The concluding four volumes now before us are very much concerned with this new "species" and with the development of this second view. Thus in Volume VII, containing parts 6 and 7 on "Universal States" and "Universal Churches" respectively, Toynbee clearly develops his suspicions of merely material success. He rejects the claims of universal states to represent their respective civilizations at their apexes. Instead, they are a product of disintegration and decay, the last desperate throw of a minority which haslost its "creative power" and must now maintain itself by force. Yet however valuable the institutions which are the conditions for the widespread peace maintained by the universal state, these cannot absorb the "creative power" present in the warring parochial states of the time of troubles. Instead, the universal churches, creations of the "internal proletariat," whose development is favoured by the institutions and conditions brought about by the universal state, now absorb and receive new energy for creative action which the latter is unable to employ. It is characteristic of Professor Toynbee's approach that the example which he gives to indicate this transference is that men are now ready to die as martyrs for the new church. Universal states exist for the sake of the universal churches or "higher religions." Toynbee now decisively rejects the view he considered in the earlier volumes, namely that the main role played by universal churches was their provision of the chrysalis from which the offspring civilization was to be born, that their significance lay in the way in which they bridged the inter- regnum between civilizations, carrying over a precious freight so that some might start with a heritage which put them on a higher footing than their forebears. Though some churches have fulfilled this function, this is not their essential purpose and, indeed, they may compromise their higher goals by serving to bring more civilizations to birth. Interregna are now not to be deplored as unfortunate breaks in the onward and upward march of civilization -now they appear to Professor Toynbee as occasions for "flashes of intense spiritual illumination and bursts of fervent spiritual activity." [Vol. VII, p. 425]. The old terminology of "Dark" Ages, adopted by the eighteenth century philosophers of history, has now undergone a simple reversal of colouring. The cyclic rhythm of rise and fall of civilizations, allegedly dis- covered by the empirical method, is now interpreted as the revolutions of the 256</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS "wheel" which carries the "chariot" of religion farther and farther towards its goal. Why should the descending movement of civilization be the sovereign means for carrying religion forward and upward? Professor Toynbee answers his own question by saying that this is but an exemplification of a Divine Law whichdecrees that spiritual progress canonlybe achieved at the cost of material tribulation. "The circumstances favourable to spiritual and secular progress are not only different but antithetical" [Vol. VII, p. 425]. This may well reinforce our doubt as to whether Professor Toynbee is clear what he means when he refers to churches as a higher species of society. Surely the term "society" carries more mundane considerations along with it. Drawing his prophetic mantle closely around him, Professor Toynbee looks at our present situation-employing a strange trick of style whereby he refers to "Mid-twentieth Century Western Civilization" in the past tense. This suggests that he is speaking retrospectively, from a future where prophecies are already fulfilled and the issue of our present condition already a matter of historical fact. Thus he forecasts the rise of a new Higher Religion, which will employ the material means furnished by a world-wide western civilization, which unites the earth culturally and economically, if not politically. This is to be a syncretistic mixture of the four extant higher religions, Christianity, Islam, Mahdydna, and Hinduism. Our doubts as to the practical possibilities of this development are stilled by the following words: "On the longer view that was visible to the eye of faith, it could be forecast that the driver would master his team and that the chariot would continue to mount on the heavenward course that it had been following continuously since before Abraham was" [Vol. VII, p. 444]. The above extract, incidentally, is a fair example of Toynbee's style in these later volumes. He delights in expressing himself in the words of the Bible, and embedded in this rich impasto of Biblical phraseology, selfconsciously applied with footnote references, we find an encrustation of his own abstracta, entities like "Subconscious Psyche," plus further additions of mythological impedi- menta, taken from a syncretistic palette which includes Nirvana, hubris, the Yin and the Yang, Original Sin, and so on. Undismayed by the disquieting possibility that the disintegration or break- down of our own precariously balanced civilization might make impossible the material conditions for any kind of social life to be sensibly called civilized, the prophet continues: it might "be augured that, if a secularized Western civilization were to break down in its turn, having swept all its contemporaries into its net, the living religions would not only survive but would grow in wisdom and stature as the result of fresh experience of secular catastrophe" [Vol. VII, p. 448]. Here we feel that the apocalyptic vision has indeed blinded the eye of faith to all mundane considerations. It is evident that, with these concluding volumes, Professor Toynbee has vacated the field of philosophy of history for what might be called a theology of history. The former, as distinct from the latter, had its birth in eighteenth century optimism and rationalism, and rested on the presupposition that an empirical study would reveal laws of historical development, indicative of a generally progressive tendency, to be made smoother by the removal of reac- tionary individuals or groups which stood as temporary obstructions in the way. This Panglossian optimism never rested on very sure foundations; yet though keen minds never needed the evidence of the grim events of the E 257</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY Twentieth Century to shake their belief in the inevitable progress, nevertheless these have created the appropriate atmosphere for pessimism. So Spengler's Decline of the West, the pessimistic view of human history as inevitable revolu- tions of the wheel of a birth-death-birth cycle, of development inevitably followed by decay, was a natural cousin of the earlier view, still leaving its presuppositions uncriticized. Now Toynbee presents a third stage in this development. Spengler's pessimistic relativism is replaced by optimism- which is not that of the eighteenth-century originators of philosophy of history, but an apocalyptic optimism which harks back to the older theological view. This can be seen by the way in which the old central concepts are "spiritualized" by Toynbee. The unity of history and the notion of historical laws of development, key notions of traditional philosophy of history where their application was to social and political events, are now translated to a higher sphere. Just as "churches" replace "civilizations" as higher species of society, so the unity of history becomes the unity of the higher religions-with the ultimate, inevitable objective the syncretistic goal, now to be achieved in place of the mere "mundane" unification of civil society which Kant held out as the goal of historical development. Similarly, historical "laws" are taken up into God's laws to man. In Vol. IX, Professor Toynbee does make some telling rebukes against the antinomianist historians who repeat H. A. L. Fisher's dictum by rote. We may fairly agree that the extra information on civilizations, brought to light by the archaeologist, at least leaves it an "open question" as to whether the empirical data justify the employment of some concept of law in application to history. Indeed, Professor Toynbee does make a telling point against such metaphysical cartographers who would seek to draw a line upon the map which separates the law-abiding territory of the natural sciences from the anarchistic jungle of human affairs. Surely it is paradoxical, he suggests (Vol. IX, p. 205), that just when historians are extending their territory into those fields of everyday activity which supply the sociologist and economist with data for their "laws" relating to human affairs, the former should continue to deny the applicability of the concept. Yet when Toynbee continues by raising the question "Do such laws of Nature governing human affairs turn out, when we understand them, to be inexorable?" [Vol. IX, p. 2i8], then it is evident that he has been misled by the insufficiently analysed concept of law whose anthropomorphism he himself has admitted leads to unavoidable confusions. If he could have disabused himself of the notion that a scientific "law" is a commandment or in any sense inexorably decrees the actual succession of events, then it would have been unnecessary for him to have called in an appeal to the "Laws of God" to make good the dilemma of freedom versus determinism. For surely the claim that the historical "laws of nature" only "make sense" when they are pictured as the "wheels that God has fitted to His Own Chariot" is not a proposition that any empirical appeal to the data of history can either prove or disprove. It is the basic confusion of this imperfectly analysed concept of a law of history that blinds Toynbee to the inconsequence of statistics to the Prophet's Message, and, equally, the inappropriateness of Prophecy to the interpretation of statistical evidence. The dilemma of a Christian philosophy of history is that the crucial events of its Sacred History-the Fall, the Reincarnation, the Last Days-belong to a different order of things and lie outside the empirical history of the City of Man. The promised City of God, the apocalyptic Fourth Age, remains obstin- ately outside historical time, and only the heretical opinions of a Joachim de Floris can effect a junction, displeasing both to theologian and to historian. Toynbee notes Collingwood's warnings against the inescapable eschatology of 258</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS Christian philosophy of history and its tendency to look for the essence of History outside history itself "by looking away from man's actions in order to detect the plan of God." Yet he is confident that the criticism does not apply to his own view. I doubt whether many of his readers will share his confidence. His Christian critic, Mr. Martin Wright, to whom he has so generously given space in notes and appendix, on one occasion disputes his assertion that Christianity can make claim to be the carrier or originator of the ideal of individual liberty. Christianity, Mr. Wright suggests, is in fact capable of accommodating itself to any political regime. Here, surely, is an expression of the dilemma of any Christian philosophy of history. Its values are never wholly of this world, and events of a historical nature, social states of affairs, are only indirectly its concern. Finally, there is one last observation to be made on this attempt to see human history sub specie aeternitas-from a Pisgah height which approaches God's view. Traditionally, the heavenly outlook on human affairs has been thought to be marked by two characteristics-a concern for even the appar- ently most insignificant individual event, together with a compassion which is necessarily dependent on this concern. Professor Toynbee's report from his exalted eminence is singularly lacking in both these attributes, in spite of the vast amount of learning and factual erudition that illustrates his pages. Though he repeatedly claims, as an article of faith, that the significance of individual relationships is the root of all spiritual significance, very few features of individuals are discernible in the historical pages of his work. Civilizations, societies, armies on the march, the clash of sects and churches, the spread of systems of belief or institutions-these fill the pages with very rarely any glimpse of the individual faces of the marchers, the inner experience of the worshippers, or even the individual personalities of the "creative" power- wielders who appear only in their hieratic roles. Is it significant that one of the comparatively few occasions when a human individual does emerge from this impersonal record, is that on which St. Daniel the Stylite makes a brief descent from his pillartop in the year A.D. 475?
