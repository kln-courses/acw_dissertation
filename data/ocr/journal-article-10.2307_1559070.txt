The first of On all three objections, Levinson seems to these is due to Hubert Eiholzer (the essay, me to have met the challenge.

Is it obvious that this is not</page><page sequence="10">362 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism an account of the phenomenology? To press home the objection I have been considering in this paper, the opponents of the dispositional account would have to demonstrate clear cases in which all the elements and relations were present, but there was no experience of expres- sion. It is not clear to me that this can be done. In summary, the argument that the dispositional account cannot meet the externality requirement does not seem to me conclusive. Indeed, it meets it as well if not better than its rivals do. Of course, there may be other reasons why the dispositional account is unacceptable. What I hoped to show is that his objection-which is widely thought to be the account's most signifi- cant flaw-is not the problem that it has seemed to be.59 DEREK MATRAVERS Department of Philosophy The Open University Milton Keynes MK7 6AA United Kingdom INTERNET: d.c.matravers@open.ac.uk 1. 0.

I must admit to a slight worry about this talk of meta- physics. I regard the debate between those who believe in aesthetic properties and those who do not along the lines of the debate between realists and antirealists about color properties. That is, antirealists (of which I am one) do not want to revise the relevant discourse, nor do they need an error theory. They simply think the story can be told refer- ring only to less problematic properties and the experiences they cause. I am not sure everyone sees matters in this way.

David Velleman, "Colour as a Secondary Property," in Readings in Color, ed. Alex Byrne and David Hilbert (MIT Press, 1989; reprint, 1997). However, Wittgenstein's claim is that in the circum- stances he describes we would "talk of" pain patches, not that we would experience pain as a property of the patches (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations [Oxford: Blackwell, 1976], p. 312). That we would not experience pain as a property of the world (in the way we do color) seems to me entailed by pain being a hedonic state intimately connected to motivation. (Boghossian and Velleman agree that the use to which they are putting this passage might not coincide with that intended by Wittgenstein.) 58.
