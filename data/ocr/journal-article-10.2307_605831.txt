<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOUNTAIN DEITIES IN CHINA: THE DOMESTICATION OF THE MOUNTAIN GOD AND THE SUBJUGATION OF THE MARGINS TERRY F. KLEEMAN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA Since earliest times, mountains in China have been considered divine. Magnets for devout pil- grims and refuges for world-weary hermits, mountains have been sung of in poetry, prayed to by magistrates, Daoists, and Buddhists. Cosmologically they were pillars supporting the known cosmos, but also liminal realms of the Other beyond the confines of Chinese civilization. Although mountains were sometimes worshipped as gods in their own right, they were also home to a variety of divine beings. This paper will explore both the mountain as god and the diverse group of gods dwelling in or associated with mountains. All mountains, whether large or small, have gods and spirits X1 .1 -Ge Hong (283-343) THE MARCHMOUNTS PERHAPS BEST KNOWN of the mountain gods are the marchmounts or sacred peaks (yue /iff). These moun- tains, one in each cardinal direction, fix and define Chi- nese space. Their worship may go back as far as the Shang. The character yue occurs frequently in the oracle bone inscriptions as a pictograph of one range of moun- tains above another.2 This yue is the object of a number of sacrifices, including the offering of burnt sacrificial victims known as liao O, as well as the di i9 sacrifice 1 Baopuzi (Basic Sinological Series ed.; rpt., Taibei: Shijie shuju, 1969): 17.76. Cf. James Ware, Alchemy, Medicine, and Religion in the China of A.D. 320 (Cambridge, Mass.: M.I.T. Press, 1966), 279-80. 2 Qu Wanli summarizes a variety of opinions concerning this character and argues persuasively for the identification adopted here in "Yue yi jigu" Qif T, Qinghua xuebao, n.s., 2.1 (May 1960): 53-68, esp. 61-63. Qu estimates that the graph occurs more than two hundred times in the limited corpus of inscriptions available in 1960. Keightley notes that sacrifices to the yue are discontinued, or at least no longer recorded in oracle-bone inscriptions, toward the end of the Shang. See David N. Keightley, Sources of Shang History (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univ. of California Press, 1978), 177. usually reserved for the high god(s); announcements (gao t) are made to the yue and emissaries dispatched to it.3 The yue can curse both the king and the crops. It is, according to Qu Wanli's calculations, the most com- mon object of prayers for rain and the second most common object (after the Yellow River) of prayers for the harvest. Ding Shan concludes that this yue need not refer to any of the historical marchmounts; the character denotes, he maintains, a ritual performed on any rela- tively high mountain.4 Since, however, emissaries are sent to yue, the term must refer to some specific cult site or sites. We cannot be certain what mountain(s) were in- tended in these divinatory charges. Sun Yirang, the first scholar to address this question, identified this yue with Mount Song ilIl near Luoyang, the later Central Marchmount, and Sarah Allan has recently concurred, arguing that it had functioned as a cosmic center since 3 Inscriptions including the character yue are collected to- gether by Shima Kunio, Inkyo bokuji sorui (Tokyo: Kyfko shoin, 1971): 174.1-176.2. This character appears to depict one range of mountains on top of another, according well with the simpler graphic variant for yue, j. 4 Ding Shan TI-, Zhongguo gudai zongjiao yu shenhua kao ~cPSiXW~ Ft~r (1961; rpt.

Great Palace was also the name for the central hall in the ancestral Pure Temple (Qingmiao j* ) where the ruler communed with his ancestors and Heaven and the name itself should perhaps be tran- scribed Palace of Heaven (Tianshi 3i).7 King You of Zhou ,MqE (r. 841-830) is said to have convened the feudal lords and non-Chinese rulers at Great Palace Mountain, reflecting its function as symbol of the Zhou state.8 Qu Wanli has proposed a different identification for the yue mentioned in the oracle-bone inscriptions and the Shijing. He argues that the mountain in question is Mount Huo !IRj, also known as the Taiyueshan tLl or Huotaishan tSJLl.9 His best evidence is an incident recorded in the Discourses of the States (Guoyu ri ) and the Guanzi -T- and a passage from the Surviving Zhou Documents (Yi Zhoushu AFS ). In the first case, Sire Huan of Qi &amp; _ia speaks of the return of sacrifi- 5 Sun Yirang, Qiwen juli ~3~ffJ, cited in Qu Wanli, "Yue yi jigu," 62; Sarah Allan, The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China (Albany: State Univ. of New York Press, 1991), 99-100. 6 Shijing (Harvard-Yenching Index Series ed.), 70/259/1; Maoshi zhengyi (Shisanjing zhushu ed., 1815; rpt. Taibei: Yi- wen chubanshe), 18.3/lb; Arthur Waley, The Book of Songs (London: Allen and Unwin, 1937), 133. The term songgao #ig in this poem is a stative verb, "to be lofty and high," and the word "lofty" is sometimes represented by the graph A. Its use as the name of the Central Marchmount is founded upon the identification of the yue in this poem with that mountain. I have found no reference to this mountain as Songshan or Songgao prior to the Han dynasty. 7 The characters tian 5 and tai ~ are indistinguishable in oracle bones and early bronzes. It is unclear when the conven- tion of distinguishing them arose and how it was applied.

The passage in the Surviving Zhou Docu- ments tells of King Wu's establishment of the city of Luo MtE (modern Luoyang) on the reputed site of the Xia dynasty capital. He extols the commanding loca- tion of this city, from which "we to the north can gaze past the outskirts of the yue" (wo beiwang guo yu yuebi ~4tbL ~:@ 3).1 Although neither passage offers definitive proof that the yue referred to is Mount Huo (the distance from Jiang to Mount Huo is considerable and that from Luoyang even greater), it does seem the most likely candidate. Mount Song is southeast of Lu- oyang and nearly twice as far from Jiang as Mount Huo. Other texts of the Warring States era speak of a group of yue. In the "Canon of Yao" P 12 of the Book of Documents (Shujing f ), the Thearch Yao consults 10 The Tang commentary to the Guanzi, by Fang Xuanling ,ft1 (578-648), understands longyue to refer to Sire Huan and his state of Qi, who as members of the Jiang clan were descendants of the Four Marchmounts. The Guoyu passage; which continues, "None of the feudal lords bordering on the yue dared not come in submission," clearly implies a place near Jiang. In his translation of the Guanzi passage, Rickett inexplicably identifies the yue as the Southern Marchmount, Mount Heng YlI1 in Hunan. An alternate interpretation of this incident, which has the Sire Huan returning the ruler of Jin to his throne (zuo j) at the Jin capital of Jiang, does not alter its significance for the identification of the yue.

Allyn Rickett, Guanzi: Political, Economic, and Philosophical Essays from Early China (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985), 338, n. 114.

That the Four Marchmounts play such a central role in the main narrative events of this chapter suggests that they were part of this origi- nal stratum.

Although commentarial opinion is split as to the identity of the Four Marchmounts here, all major theories share common conceptions. Kong Anguo identifies them as the four sons of Xi He SI, each in charge of the feudal lords subordinate to one of the marchmounts.'3 Others take siyue to be a collective term for the feudal lords of the four directions, or to refer to the leader of the feudal lords in each quarter.14 All see the Four Marchmounts as leading or constituting groups of local nobility with ul- timate allegiance to the Zhou royal house but not under its direct control. Whatever the exact identities of these officials, they certainly had some relation to the mountains whose names they bore. When Shun accepts the abdication of Yao and accedes to the throne, he meets with the Four Marchmounts and local rulers, then goes on a proces- sion to each of the four marchmounts to offer sacrifice.15 Thus by at least the fourth century B.c. there was a com- plex of numinous mountains that were conceived as in- timately linked to the state and its well-being. The system of four marchmounts was based upon a center/margins dichotomy. The Tradition of Zuo (Zuo- zhuan ;~q) repeatedly links the marchmounts to non- Chinese tribes. At a great interstate summit held in 559 B.C., a leader of the Rong A people comments, "Sire Hui [of Jin] HB: , making illustrious his great virtue, considered us many Rong to be the descendants of the Four Marchmounts and not to be mistreated or aban- doned."'6 The four human marchmounts are analogues of the four regional hegemons (bo {f, lit. "elder brother"), originally non-Chinese (i.e., not at that time identified as part of Huaxia V ) regional leaders who assume responsibility for managing the tribes of their region and acting as a bulwark against foreign invasion in return for a privileged alliance with the Chinese rul- 13 Shangshu zhengyi (Shisanjing zhushu ed.), 2.19a. Kong Yingda's subcommentary explains that each of the feudal lords worshipped at the Marchmount in his quarter of the world and in that sense each was subordinate to that march- mount. 14 Ikeda Suetoshi, Shosho, 62, note. Ikeda notes that in the Tradition of Zuo the term seems to be used as the name of a non-Chinese people. 15 Shangshu zhengyi 3.9a/b; Ikeda, 68. 16 Zuozhuan (Harvard-Yenching Index ed.) 278/Xiang 14/1; Zuozhuan zhengyi Et1WIE% (Shisanjing zhushu ed.), 32.9b; cf.

In this system the marchmounts are defined as outside of or at least peripheral to the Chinese cul- tural sphere, an allied but still marginalized "other." The king is the center and axis of this spatial arrange- ment, liegelord of the marchmount-hegemons, and as such, he must have had his own mountain. This central mountain would have been the acme of a pyramid of sa- cred peaks, just as the Shang and Zhou kings held su- preme ritual authority over powerful regional leaders, upon whom they relied for military support. Whether this supreme central mountain was Mount Song/Great Palace Mountain, Mount Huo, or some other peak lost to history, the ordering of Chinese space was hierarchi- cal with a single focus exalted above its four supports. By the Han dynasty, at the latest, it had become com- mon to group the physical marchmounts into a company of five, adding the Central Marchmount, Mt. Song.18 Each mountain was now correlated with one of the Five Agents (wuxing ifij) and, through it, with the whole system of related colors, flavors, directions, stars, sea- sons, etc. Part of this system is the Five Thearchs (wudi ?.;), color-coded monarchs of the five quarters and their marchmounts. The earliest recorded instance of sacrifice to one of these gods is set in the eighth century B.C., when the ruler of the state of Qin institutes sacrifices to the White Thearch, god of the Western Marchmount or Flowery Mountain (Huashan ; LI). 17 Han etymologies of the character yue emphasize the ad- ministrative aspects of the role. The Baihu tong nbj8 of Ban Gu %f[] (32-92) defines yue as jue /Mf ("to compare") be- cause the marchmount "compares the achievements and vir- tues [of his subordinates]" and Ying Shao SWJ (fl. ca. 190) is even more explicit, saying "yue means to compare (jue) and examine achievements and virtues, demoting and promoting the benighted and enlightened" tW fiItI .

This may reflect a regional Qin systematization that did not catch on. 228</page><page sequence="4">KLEEMAN: Mountain Deities in China The circumstances are related in the Records of the His- torian (Shiji E,):19 Fourteen generations had passed since the Zhou con- quest of the Shang; generation after generation the Zhou house had waned and the rites and music had been abandoned. The feudal lords acted without restraint and King You was defeated by the Dog Rong. Zhou moved its capital east to Luo. Sire Xiang of Qin W*a (r. 777- 766 B.C.) attacked the Rong, saving the Zhou, and in recognition of this for the first time he was ranked fore- most among the feudal lords. Once Sire Xiang of Qin had been made marquis, and occupied the Western Ap- pendage iA, he concluded that he was the host of the god Shaohao ,O . He created the Western Sacred Pre- serve,20 offering cult to the White Thearch (Baidi i ). He is said to have used as sacrificial animals one each of red horses with black manes and tails, yellow oxen, and rams. Sixteen years later, Sire Wen of Qin $t3;' (r. 765-715) was hunting in the east, between the Qian and Wei Rivers. He divined about occupying this site and the response was auspicious. Sire Wen dreamt that a yellow snake hung down from the heavens, touching the earth, with its mouth reaching the lower slopes of Fu.21 Sire Wen asked the historian Dun C about this. Dun replied, "This is a summons from the Thearch(s) on High (shangdi J?). My lord should offer cult to them (him). Thereupon [the Sire] created the Fu Sacred Preserve and, using three sacrificial victims, performed the suburban sacrifice to the White Thearch there.22 19 Shiji, 28.1358. 20 Xu Shen defines a "sacred preserve" (zhi B) as a place where one "erects an edifice to sacrifice to the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth." Here I follow Duan Yucai's commen- tary in interpreting this difficult passage. See Duan Yucai, ed., Shuowen jiezi zhu (1808; rpt. Taipei: Lantai shuju, 1974), 13.46a/b. 21 Southeast of modern Luochuan county in Shensi. Xu Shen records an alternate tradition that this sacred preserve had been established by the euhemerized Yellow Thearch. Shuowen jiezi zhu, 13.46b. 22 Note that in the previous passage I translated the term shangdi ambiguously. Robert Eno has argued that the term di X in the oracle bones can be plural, referring at times to a group of divine beings. In classical times as well, the term shangdi V, usually assumed to refer solely to the high god of the Shang, is, at least in some contexts, glossed by Han com- mentators as a plural expression referring to the Five Thearchs. When the "Monthly Ordinances" qt preserved in the Record of Rites lists the objects of communal sacrifice, In this important passage the ruler of the state of Qin institutes sacrifices to the god of a mountain within his territory, the White Thearch, ruler and occupant of the Western Marchmount. "White," being the color of the west, places this god within the framework of the sys- tem of five directionally oriented deities known as the Five Thearchs. We cannot be certain if this grouping was part of a pre-existing belief, assimilated by the Qin, or represents the introduction of a Qin cult to the rest of China.23 The rulers of Qin were to build five more of these sacred preserves, two dedicated to the White Thearch, one to the Green Thearch (Qingdi WV), one to the Yellow Thearch, and one to the Fiery (i.e., red) Thearch (Yandi A.).24 The presence of a yellow snake in the above passage may imply a recognition of the Yellow Thearch associated with the center, but it seems that there was no attempt to establish within the borders of Qin a complete set of altars to the Five Thearchs. The dating of this passage is open to question (it follows immediately after a famous prophecy pre- dicting the rise of Qin, which is widely assumed to be late) but the very lack of systematization argues for an earlier rather than later date. The special attention di- rected toward the Green Thearch of the east, then, may reflect the east-west pairing of gods we see in later di- vine twosomes like the Queen-Mother of the West P3ETf and the King-Sire of the East *T'g or Rushou #a&amp; and Goumang 'E . Riegel places the origin of the association of every aspect of Chinese life with the Five Agents in the fourth century B.C.25 The Qin system may derive from this period, when these associations were known but not yet dominant. viz., "August Heaven, the Thearchs on High, famous moun- tains, great rivers, and the gods of the four quarters" ?_W_.StfL~JIIE9:;t;j_, Zheng Xuan identifies the Thearchs on High as the Five Thearchs of Supreme Tenuity. These five astral deities are, of course, correlated to the five march- mounts below. I believe that in the passage above, describing the eighth century B.C., shangdi is plural, and even though the yellow snake may be a symbol of the central Yellow Thearch, the ruler of Qin responds to a request for worship from the Thearchs on High by offering sacrifice to their representative assigned to his region, the White Thearch. See Robert Eno, "Was There a High God Ti in Shang Religion?," Early China 15 (1990): 1-26; Liji zhushu (Shisanjing zhushu ed.), 16.9b. 23 Mitarai Masaru, among others, makes the claim that these are originally Qin deities in his Kodai Chugoku no kamigami (Tokyo: Sobunsha, 1984), 347-86. 24 Shiji, 28.1358-60, 1364. 25 Jeffrey K. Riegel, "Kou-mang and Ju-shou," Cahiers d'Extreme-Asie 5 (1989-90): 55-83, esp. p. 69. 229</page><page sequence="5">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.2 (1994) By the Han the system of Five Marchmounts was firmly established. Emperor Wu retrofitted the ritual sites of Yong into this system by establishing another sacred preserve, cosmologically designated as the Sa- cred Preserve of the North (Beizhi Il*) and assigning one of the ritual sites to each agent.26 This change was in part a reflection of changed political realities. China had expanded until the marchmounts no longer marked the frontiers of Huaxia civilization. Instead, they were now part of the heartland and had to be brought within the confines of the imperial cult. As part of this program Emperor Wu took direct possession of all five marchmounts, two of which had been located in princedoms.27 There can be little doubt that in Warring States China the Yellow Thearch was considered at least a primus inter pares, if not a true high god, and this is reflected in roles attributed to him as ancestor of the Chinese people and patron of schools of learning as di- verse as political science, medicine, and sexual tech- niques-as well as in Han popular references to the Yellow God MIp.28 No such claims are ever made for the White Thearch, confirming that Qin did not try to establish its own pantheon centering on the Yong sites. The Han systematization integrated all five march- mounts into a system of mutual equality, with suzer- ainty passing from one marchmount and its associated thearch to another in accordance with the rhythms of the seasons. The Chinese tendency toward hierarchy made such a grouping inherently unstable.29 In place of the Central Marchmount we see, beginning in the Han, the rise of the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai, as ruler of the dead and arbiter of fate. Writing at the end of the Han, Ying Shao describes Mount Tai as the "leader (zhang A) of the Five Marchmounts.30 In post-Tang China, temples to the Eastern Marchmount SA were found in every major town and city, whereas temples to 26 Shiji, 12.452. 27 Shiji, 12.458. 28 On the Yellow God in Han tomb documents see Anna Seidel, "Traces of Han Religion in Funeral Texts Found in Tombs," in Doky6 to shuky6 bunka, ed. Akizuki Kan'ei (Tokyo: Hirakawa shuppansha), 714-678. 29 The same dynamic is responsible for redefining the earlier system of yin and yang, from a relationship of equal impor- tance and mutual need, to the privileging of yang and demon- ization of yin that dominated religious and philosophical thought in imperial China. 30 Fengsu tongyi tongjian, 10.77. the other marchmounts were largely confined to the mountain's immediate vicinity. GHOSTS, SPRITES, AND IMPS OF THE MOUNTAINS The marchmounts were only the most prominent of a variety of divine beings associated with mountains. Ar- rayed spatially according to cosmological theory and organizationally in parallel with the temporal adminis- tration, the marchmounts seem to embody the ancient civilization of China. There was, however, another side to the supernatural denizens of China's mountains. The Scripture of Mountains and Seas (Shanhai jing UllS4) describes the gods of many mountains, and they are a frightening collection of freaks and monstrosities. The gods surrounding Mount Min Illtl in Sichuan, for ex- ample, have horse bodies and dragon heads, while those of Great Palace Mountain have human faces on each of their three heads.31 Most of the beings that the ancient Chinese envisioned in the mountains had more in common with these semi-zoomorphic entities than the staid regional rulers of the marchmounts, but even the marchmounts reveal a more unorthodox aspect in later legend. This section will introduce some of these anom- alous entities. The mountains of China were a sacred realm where profane mortals entered at their peril. Those who did so were drawn by the floral, mineral, and transcendent treasures hidden therein. Ge Hong (A.D. 283-343), the fourth-century proponent of alchemy, was forced to en- ter the mountains to collect the numinous substances needed for his elixirs. He devotes an entire chapter of his Master Embracing Simplicity (Baopuzi tl+-) to the mountains, their wonders, and their dangers, begin- ning with the following passage:32 All mountains, whether large or small, have gods and spirits jSi. If the mountain is large, the god is great; if the mountain is small, the god is minor. If someone en- ters the mountain possessed of no magical arts, he will certainly suffer harm. Some will fall victim to acute 31 Yuan Ke Aa, Shanhai jing jiaozhu [lWflQt (Shang- hai: Guji chubanshe, 1980), 5.160, 150. The dating of the Shanhai jing is the subject of much controversy but it seems safe to affirm that the first five chapters are pre-Han. See R6mi Mathieu, Etude sur la mythologie et l'ethnologie de la Chine ancienne, vol. 1 (Paris: College de France, Institut des Hautes ltudes Chinoises, 1983), ci. 32 See above, note 1. 230</page><page sequence="6">KLEEMAN: Mountain Deities in China diseases or be wounded by weapons. When frightened and uneasy, some will see lights and shadows, others will hear strange sounds. Sometimes a huge tree will topple, though there is no wind, or a cliff will collapse for no reason, striking and killing people. Sometimes the man will flee in confusion, tumbling down a cavern or into a gorge; other times he will encounter tigers, wolves, and poisonous insects that attack men. One cannot enter a mountain lightly! Ge Hong goes on to list numerous magical preparations that can assure one's safety, including selecting auspi- cious days for the particular mountain to be ascended and for the substance sought. A typical example follows:33 There are forty-nine true, secret talismans of Lord Lao, the Yellow Court, and the Central Embryo. When plan- ning to enter mountain forests on a jiayin day (day 51), write them on a piece of undyed silk in cinnabar. That night, place them in the middle of the table; then, facing the Northern Dipper, sacrifice to it with wine and dried meat, just a bit of each. Pronounce your own surname and personal name, bow twice, and, taking the talisman, wear it inside your clothes to avoid the hundred ghosts and myriad sprites, the tigers, dholes, and five poison- ous insects of the mountains and streams. In Ge Hong's day there was already a plethora of mys- terious beings lying in wait in the mountains. Let us first consider the category of the "myriad sprites" (wanjing tjl). Ge Hong has this to say of them:34 As for the aged of the myriad beings (wanwu Mb), the spirit (jing t) of each of them can temporarily assume human form to dazzle human eyes, and they often test people. It is only in a mirror that they cannot change their true form. For this reason all the Daoists of old, when entering the mountains, would dangle a bright mirror nine inches in diameter from their backs so that devils (mei E1) would not dare approach. If one comes to test a person, he should examine it in the mirror. If it is a transcendent or a good god of the mountains, then when examined in the mirror it will seem to have hu- man form. If it is a bird, beast, or evil devil then its [true] form will be visible in the mirror. Also, if an old devil should come, it is certain to walk backwards when 33 Baopuzi, 17.81-82. Cf. James Ware, Alchemy, Medicine, and Religion, 295-96. 34 Baopuzi, 17.77. leaving. You can turn the mirror to reflect its back; if it is an old devil, it is certain to have no heels. If it has heels, then it is a divine transcendent. The belief in sprites (jing) is founded on the conception that as living beings age, they accumulate spirit (jing).35 Exceptionally long-lived beings, be they animals like the turtle or crane, or plants like the pine tree, could ac- cumulate enough jing to attain the power of transforma- tion. These are the creatures described above, and they were usually considered to be malefic in nature. Ge Hong equates them with mei, which I translate "devil" because of its common use in collocation with names of fearsome monsters like the wangliang (variously writ- ten as Mj or B ).36 At this early stage there seems to be no consistent differentiation between mountain gods (shanshen), moun- tain spirits (shanling), and mountain ghosts (shangui). All these terms are ambiguous and their semantic fields overlap. For example, one denizen of the mountains is noted for being just one foot tall. In the Guanzi ::, Sire Huan of Qi catches a glimpse of the god of Mount Deng SLL^Ui$$, who is said to be "one foot tall but possessing all the features of a human."37 The appear- ance of this supernatural being is auspicious, heralding the advent of a Hegemon. Ge Hong describes a moun- tain sprite whose "form is like a small child but with one foot."38 The fifth-century Record of Yongjia Com- mandery (Yongjiajun ji 7j8g3j&lt; ) provides record of a mountain inhabitant of similar stature:39 35 Jing seems originally to have referred to select, refined grain, then to the essence distilled from food and utilized by the body. As a concept, it is closely related to qi X,, which originally referred to the steam from boiling grain but came to be understood as a structive force in nature, and in this meaning is variously translated as "breath," "ether," or "vital force." 36 Xu Shen shared this conception of them, for he defines mei as "the sprite of an old creature" t" .

A story in Hong Mai's Yijian zhi I,, entitled "A Citi- zen of Zhang[zhou] Takes a Mountain Ghost as Wife," shows they were still feared in the twelfth century. The spectral bride in this tale resembles in all respects a normal woman except for having only one foot, a trait noticed only by the groom's younger sister [!]. The next morning the groom's parents break into the wed- ding chamber, only to find their son reduced to a pile of bones.40 Still, if properly propitiated, these mountain spirits could be powerful allies of human travelers. A Tang tale recorded in the Taiping guangji tells how a man be- friended a female imp (shanxiao lltf) with an appro- priate gift of cosmetics, in return for which the imp protected him from two ravenous tigers.41 Mountain gods were less purposefully evil than amoral, self- centered and egocentric. MOUNTAIN GODS AS BUREAUCRATS Ge Hong, like most men of his day, still saw the in- habitants of mountains as supernatural beings remote from mankind. They might assume human appearance to deceive naive travelers, but their true form was zoomorphic or semi-zoomorphic. Even individuals who attained the status of a divine transcendent were trans- formed into feathered creatures (yuren 1,) more akin to birds than men. Their identities and actions were as mysterious and unfathomable as their appearance. They could be propitiated with sacrifice or warded off with powerful prophylactic charms, but they could not be reasoned with nor could their behavior be predicted. The institution of a system of marchmounts in the Zhou, detailed above, was an attempt to integrate the primordial powers of the mountains into the Zhou cultural order that directly paralleled the establishment 40 Yijian zhi (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1981), jia 14, 1.119. 41 Taiping guangji, 428.2. of regional hegemons to unify and subdue unsinified tribes. Late Zhou and Han philosophical speculation transformed the marchmounts into abstract cosmologi- cal forces essential to the circulation of the pneumas of life. But philosophers could not sway popular devotion, and the sacrificial offerings that assured the march- mounts' protection continued to stream from all levels of society and the state. The Buddhist polemicist Zhu Daoshuang, noting this contradictory behavior, argued in his "Proclamation to Mount Tai" that the march- mounts, as cosmological forces, are due no cult whereas the true recipient of the bloody offerings to the march- mounts must be demonic:42 The true gods of the five marchmounts are phases of quintessence (jing zhi hou 1Z?1 ). Above they model the Jade Pivot (xuanji 3St, four stars in the Big Dip- per), below they succeed to Qian and Kun (hexagrams representing pure yang and pure yin, respectively). They are endowed with a Dao both pure and void, with neither sound nor echo. If one reveres them, they are not pleased by it. If one scorns them, they are not troubled by it. Through a thousand compliments or ten thousand insults the gods are neither augmented nor diminished. Yet you [demons]43 appropriate their titles and attach yourselves to the living. In the void you rouse [angry] breaths, your mouth full of murder and injury. If they obey, you bestow on them your grace; if they disobey, then they suffer calamity. The mixture of Daoist and Buddhist technical terminol- ogy in this document reflects the shared opposition of these two institutionalized religions to the sacrificial regime that was at the heart of popular (and state) cults. Once philosophical abstractions of the gods had been appropriated by organized religion as arguments against continued cult praxis, a new means of increas- ing the respectability of the mountain gods had to be found. The solution was to turn them into dead heroes. Through the following centuries, both folktales and government pronouncements sought to redefine these 42 Zhu Daoshuang 1qT , "Xi Taishan wen" ;tl13:, in Hongming ji 4Lt , 52.91c; Gumyishu2 kenkyi2u tiXW (Kyoto: Institute for Humanistic Science, 1973-75), 2:401-5.

See Gumyoshu kenkyu, 2:748, n. 1. 43 The editors of Gumyoshi kenkyu take the second-person pronouns in this passage to refer to human proponents of the cult rather than the demonic beings themselves, but this is in- consistent with the document as a whole, which is addressed to Mount Tai. 232</page><page sequence="8">KLEEMAN: Mountain Deities in China alpine gods as anthropomorphic figures possessing the same virtues and vices as humans. A governmental model had informed the Chinese sacred realm since at least Zhou times, but like government at that time, the sacred realm excluded certain portions of the empire.44 Just as the Zhou state and its feudal rulers maintained only nominal control of mountainous regions populated by unsinified or semisinified minority peoples, moun- tain deities possessed considerable autonomy, with only the awesome regional lords of the marchmounts being integrated into anything like an administrative hierar- chy. In tales of the Tang and Song, human foibles are increasingly attributed to these figures and, eventually, they come to suffer the same sort of institutional con- straints that the temporal official felt in his governmen- tal duties. The marchmounts were the first to evince this trans- formation. By the Han they were already assigned Chi- nese names, although these names might still have a symbolic aspect (e.g., the ruler of the Western March- mount is surnamed Bai b or "White," the color of the west in five-agents cosmology). The god of this march- mount appears in a Tang tale that illustrates the increas- ing bureaucratization of the Chinese sacred realm:45 During the Shining Clouds reign-period (Jingyun :5, A.D. 710-12) Madame Wang :E, wife of a certain Mr. Li - of Henan county, was famous throughout the Three Auxiliaries (sanfu, i.e., the capital region) for her beauty. Li had left for his office in the morning and had yet to return. Wang had finished her toilet and sat rest- ing, burning incense. Suddenly she saw several men from the royal gates accompanying a calf-drawn cart that descended from the clouds to her courtyard. Ma- dame Wang, startled, asked their purpose. One replied, "The Magistrate of Mount Hua has sent us to escort you to him." Not permitted to refuse, she was about to de- part in a rush when she said to a household member, "I regret being unable to take leave of Chamberlain Li in person." She left wiping away her tears, and died be- side the steps. In a moment variegated clouds bore the carriage away into the void. They grew more and more 44 On the bureaucratic nature of the early Chinese pantheon as a whole, see Mori MikisaburO .E_.-1iP5, "Shina no kami- gami no kanry6teki seikaku" ';ia3&gt; 1l t , Shinagaku 11.1 (1943): 49-81.

When Li returned from pre- fectural headquarters and found his wife dead, he stroked her corpse and wailed, fainting and reviving several times. After a short while, a man came to the gate, saying that he could resuscitate the wife. Li bent himself, half bowing to and welcoming him, and begged for his protection. The man sat on the bed and asked for vermilion with which to write a talisman. Be- cause the vermilion had not arrived, he wrote a talisman in ink and sent it flying off [in smoke]. When, after a moment, the wife had not arrived, he sent off another talisman. Smiling, he said to Li, "Do not worry. Soon she will be alive." Presently Madame Wang revived. Li bowed and thanked him dozens of times, exhausted himself presenting the man with gifts. The man laughed loudly, saying, "I have rescued men from disaster and aided the suffering. What need have I for material re- wards!" He then went out the door and disappeared. When Madame Wang had recovered, she said that when she had first arrived at Mount Hua and met the king, the king was very pleased. He had set up screens among the mountain peppers46 and, after drinking and banqueting merrily with several of his followers, was just pouring wine convivially when suddenly a man appeared riding a black cloud and said, "The Great One has com- manded me to summon Lady Wang." The god remained at ease, requesting that the man wait until the end of the party. Soon there was another man riding a red cloud, who said in great anger, "The Great One asks Mount Hua, why have you seized the wife of a living man? If you do not send her back quickly, there will be severe punishment." The god, extremely agitated, thereupon commanded that she be returned to her home. This tale asserts the authority of the Great One or Taiyi );Z over the marchmount, a subordination first officially accepted during the reign of Han Wudi. The Lost History (Yishi A ) of Lu Zhao Sa (fl. 847-60) records a simi- lar story with a human savior.47 There a man passing by Mount Hua leads his wife to pray at the main temple, where she falls dead on the spot. The local magistrate rec- ommends a certain Transcendent Master Ye X{lll1i. Ye ultimately effects her release, but only after dispatching a red dragon that seizes the King of Metal Heaven, lord of the marchmount, by the throat. In this story a mortal 46 Presumably, a variety of Zanthoxylum, but I have found no specific reference to it. See G. A.

Moreover, the marchmount is still a rather willful and unruly power, checked only by the oversight of still more powerful astral deities. To observe in more detail this ongoing process of bureaucratization we must turn to the scriptures and lore of a specific cult. A SICHUANESE MOUNTAIN GOD Many of the multiple aspects of mountain divinities discussed above can be found within a single cult. The mountain in question is Sevenfold Mountain -fll,tt, located just north of a town in northern Sichuan called Zitong 41ii. It is really more of a foothill, one of the first peaks leading to the great Swordridge |IJ-B chain that separates the traditional macro-regions of Sichuan and Shaanxi, but came to possess national significance because of its location athwart the main road connect- ing these two regions. The cult site on the mountain is ancient but first en- ters the historical record in the mid-fourth century A.D., when it was mentioned in the Record of the Land of Huayang (Huayangguo zhi 3[, ), China's earliest surviving regional history.48 The original cult site seems to have been a cave situated high on the moun- tain slopes. This cave was inhabited by a fearsome giant snake called simply "the Viper" (ezi -i), who, according to later legend, had shaped the seven twist- ings of the mountain through the sinuous slitherings of his gigantic form. The snake's primary attribute was the thunder it manifested by casting down "thunder shuttles" (leizhu -ff ), which the faithful gathered and returned to the giant serpent once a year in the spring. The cult was clearly associated with fertility and thun- der as a rain-bringer, but the thunder was also a potent weapon with which the god might smite his enemies. This early account of the cult already associates it with an important Sichuanese myth cycle, that of the wonder-working Five Stalwarts (wuding EiJT) who serve King Kaiming, the dissolute last ruler of the kingdom of Shu 9. These colossal siblings were re- sponsible for a series of misguided feats that eventually led the Shu state to its ruin at the hands of the Qin. One of these was the transportation of five Qin princesses to the Shu harem, where they were supposed to distract the King while Qin plotted his downfall. The stalwarts met the Qin entourage at Sevenfold Mountain. There 48 Chang Qu t (fl. 350), Huayangguo zhi *,,t (Ba- sic Sinological Series ed.), 3.22. they encountered the Viper, who brought the mountain down upon both stalwarts and princesses. Later versions of the tale portray the serpent's actions as a vain attempt to rescue Shu, but this earliest version is ambiguous. The Five Stalwarts were once popular in Shu, despite the tragic end they brought to themselves and their land. A shrine was established to the Five Princesses, and the Viper's mountain was sometimes re- ferred to as the Tumulus of the Five Stalwarts. All his- torical accounts of these men, however, portray them as unknowing collaborators with the Qin invaders in Shu's demise. The location of the cult site is, I believe, cru- cial in understanding the Viper's role in this myth cycle. Sevenfold Mountain is the first major cult site after passing through the Sword Gate 1lUr that marked the traditional boundary of the Sichuan region. Further, the snake is a traditional deity of Sichuan, associated in particular with the Ba state in eastern Sichuan, but also prominent in Shu iconography. It would seem, then, that by the fourth century the snake was already viewed as a protector of the region as a whole, a gatekeeper screening potential visitors as they descend into the Chengdu plain. Thus the god of Sevenfold Mountain already subtends a significant historical development, transformed from an amoral, fearsome predator that had to be propitiated to a still frightening but righteous pro- tector of his native land from foreign threats. There is a third aspect of this early stage of the god's identity. The cult site was sometimes called the Shrine to Shan Ban (Shan Ban ci WRSi ). This term has been the subject of much speculation, with Henri Maspero suggesting that shanban (lit., "good board") referred to the construction of the cult building.49 Liu Lin is closer to the mark in claiming that it is the name of the thun- der god.50 One name sometimes given for the god of the Western Marchmount is Shan Lei i .51 Perhaps 49 Henri Maspero, "The Mythology of Modern China," in Asiatic Mythology: A Detailed Description and Explanation of the Mythologies of all the Great Nations of Asia, ed. J. Hackin et al. (New York: Crescent Books, n.d.), 311. 50 Liu Lin I1r, ed., Huayangguo zhi jiaozhu t[,4 i, (Chengdu: Ba Shu shushe, 1984), 146, n. 3. Ren Naiqiang's suggestion that ban refers to a ledger (ji a ) of good deeds provides an intriguing link to the god's later role as keeper of the Cinnamon Record, but is unsupported by any evidence and inappropriate for a rural nature cult. See Ren Naiqiang fTf5, ed., Huayangguo zhijiaobu tuzhu ,inSt BIit (Shanghai: Guji chubanshe, 1987), 92, n. 5. 51 This name occurs in the Wuyue zhenxing tu tlW itB, quoted in Gujin tushu jicheng, ce 491 ("Shenyi,"juan 24), 2a. 234</page><page sequence="10">KLEEMAN: Mountain Deities in China Shan was a common surname for mountain gods in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border region. All three elements of the god of Zitong's identity sur- vive many centuries. Standard historical sources make no further mention of the Viper, indicating an elite dissatisfaction with this violent, primordial, thunder- wielding deity, but two tenth-century tales reveal that this aspect of the cult was still dynamically alive in the popular imagination. The first tells of an avatar of the Viper as Yuanying 7cf, the fractious eldest son of the Later Shu ruler Wang Jian 3- (847-918).52 The young man is said to have been "vicious, evil, vile, and lewd," and possessed of several serpentine characteris- tics, including nocturnal activity, bared teeth, and a swarthy complexion. He is eventually killed while re- belling, after which the god's spirit returns to the Zitong temple. The second tale identifies the god with a ser- pent/dragon of western Sichuan, famous for having in- undated an entire city in a fit of vengeful anger.53 The first tale was never repeated after the tenth century. Per- haps it was too scandalous to be acceptable to a signifi- cant portion of the cult. The second tale, however, was fully assimilated into the cult, receiving a permanent place in cult lore in 1181 (see below). Because the mountain god as regional protector was a role that met with the favor of the literati elite, we have considerably more evidence for the development of this aspect of the god's image. Our first source is a tale re- corded in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms (Shiliuguo chunqiu +7A1,;1t ).54 The god has now acquired a Chinese surname, Zhang X, and new powers as a wonder-worker. He appears and offers succor to a tribal chieftain named Yao Chang Af (330-93), an otherwise unremarkable military figure known for having killed Fu Jian "it , the proto-Tibetan ruler who had once threatened to unify all of China. The god thus claims the role of protector of all China, a role further expanded in the Tang and Song. During the Tang, two emperors were forced to flee the capital, Chang'an, for the safety of Sichuan. Both Emperor Xuanzong it (r. 712-56) and Emperor Xi- zong f (r. 873-88) came to the temple on Sevenfold Mountain to request the god's protection and each re- I have been unable to find this quote in Dongxuan lingbao wuyue guben zhenxingtu. 52 Sun Guangxian )f* , Beimeng suoyan It4SM, quoted in Taiping guangji, 458.11. 53 Wang Renyu iE-1i, Wangshijianwen IAR3Z;, recorded in Taiping guangji, 312.2. 54 Tang Qiu AF, ed., Shiliu guo chunqiu jibu tA-S\ itkf (Basic Sinological Series ed.), 50.379. warded the god with an official title. In the Song the god was credited with suppressing rebellions in 1000 and 1132.55 During the Southern Song, when non-Chinese people first threatened, then overran Sichuan, the god and his cult formed a rallying point for loyalist senti- ment, so much so that the cult was forced to go under- ground after the Mongol conquest of Sichuan. In his official pronouncements the god grieved that his thun- derbolts had proved ineffective against the barbarian in- vaders. Although the god, under the name Wenchang, was to become the god of literature and the premier rep- resentative of civil (wen 3Z) virtues, he maintained this martial reputation until at least the fifteenth century. The god's career as a mountain god is chronicled in cult scripture. Between 1168 and 1181 a series of texts were revealed in the name of the god of Zitong by a Sichuanese spirit-writing medium named Liu Ansheng. Foremost among these was a prosimetric autobiography of the god called the Book of Transformations (Huashu {t ), which traced the god through two millennia of incarnations and divine offices.56 As one might expect of what was originally a simple mountain god cult, many of these episodes shed light on mountain gods and spirits. In the Book of Transformations the god is provided with an astral origin and his final apotheosis brings him back to an exalted celestial office, but as part of his ter- restrial sojourn the god repeatedly takes up divine posts in the mountains. One of the most interesting episodes begins as the god is touring the mountains of northern Sichuan aboard a crane. He spies five local mountain gods, all seemingly completely human in form, who beg audience with him, saying:57 It has been almost a hundred years . . .that we have been without a king. Now Your Perfection is the de- scendant of a saint, is unsullied and resplendent in your person, has accumulated virtue and amassed good works, has maintained your principles of loyalty and 55 Xu Song ,, ed., Song huiyao gao 5*% (Beijing: Datong shuju, 1936), 20.55a/b. 56 The Book of Transformations survives in two major re- censions, the Book of Transformations of the Divine Lord of Zitong, in the Daoist canon (Zitong dijun huashu *jiie{fE{, HY 170), and the Book of Transformations of Thearch Wen (Wendi huashu 3{Jlt), preserved in Daozang jiyao and many free editions. See Terry F. Kleeman, "Wenchang and the Viper: The Creation of a Chinese National God" (Ph.D. diss., University of California at Berkeley, 1988). 57 Book of Transformations, ch. 31; Kleeman, "Wenchang and the Viper," 258-59. 235</page><page sequence="11">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.2 (1994) filiality, and has come here on a spirit-journey. There are times proper to serving and to withdrawing. Why not rest here a bit? Further, near Sword Ridge there is a huge beast with a white forehead, over a thousand years old. It lies in wait in the mountain crevices and feeds on people. Since Your Perfection was once the high officer of the Son of Heaven, all the spirits of the mountains and streams were once under your command. Further, a jade rescript has ordered you here. You can yourself summon the many spirits and, breathing forth transformation, dispatch nether forces to drive forth this tiger. This would both aid Heaven and show your love of sentient beings. Far from being violent miscreants who must be kept in line by superior authority, these gods long for the ad- ministrative leadership that political turmoil has denied them. One of their justifications for putting the god of Zitong forward as their king is his service during a re- cent incarnation as a high officer of state, further link- ing the temporal and sacred orders. But even a highly bureaucratized sacred realm has its miscreants and evil-doers. Here the problem is a giant tiger, who throughout a long life has accumulated tremendous spiritual power. The god of Zitong brings together all of the supernatural inhabitants of the moun- tains in a great safari to rid the region of this fearsome predator: I was persuaded to counterfeit a divine rescript sum- moning forth all the ghosts and spirits of the mountains and streams within a thousand li. All came to hear my commands. I said, "The Thearch has sent a jade rescript noting that the white tiger is taking human life, and or- dering me, as king of this mountain, to lead you many spirits in punishing and destroying it. Those who obey this command will enjoy bloody sacrifice for generation after generation; for those who do not, Heaven pos- sesses terrible punishments." All said, "Yes, we rever- ently obey your commands." I then looked up and gazed all about. Creating an image and transforming, I manifested a form as high as the mountain. Plucking out a lone bamboo I chanted a spell and transformed it into a long sword. Ping Yi summoned the Masters of Wind and Rain to clear the way. I waved my sword with a single shout and the echo rumbled through the valley. The tiger's angry breaths formed clouds and the light of his eyes shot forth lightning-bolts. It leapt back and forth, but I blocked it with my body. All the blades advanced together, and it died under the knives. In the midst of the blood and gore I found a round stone shaped like a fallen star. Gong Yuanchang examined it and said, "This is a 'tiger's potency' (huwei .)." When I wore it belted to my waist all the gods feared me. The deed completed, I memorialized the Thearch. First I confessed my crime in counterfeiting the sum- mons, then touched upon my achievements. The Thearch consequently made me Mountain King of the Northern Gate of Shu. Despite the god's breach of bureaucratic procedure, the message of this tale is that there is a civil order, en- forced through a variety of supernatural beings and legitimized through a supreme Thearch, that works to tame the wild forces of the mountains. The god speaks of his role as mountain king in terms that any temporal regional official might agree with: "I concerned myself with every flood, drought, good or bad harvest, good or evil portent, achievement and fault within the moun- tains and streams under my control." The zoomorphic nature-spirits of the mountains and streams were clearly the most problematic in this new order. In the story above, the tiger spirit had to be slain. In another episode two dragons engaged in a race inundate the area surrounding their rivers and must be restrained by threats of the Supreme Thearch's punish- ment and a solemn oath (chapter 51). But in another case (chapter 32, discussed below), a dragon follows proper bureaucratic procedure in reporting the im- proper actions of a colleague. Temporal officials must have experienced the same mixed results in domesti- cating the deep-rooted nature cults found throughout China both then and now. There are two other examples in the Book of Trans- formations of the god's interactions with other moun- tain deities, both of which shed interesting light on the new role of mountain gods. The first (chapter 32) con- cerns a corrupt mountain god within the new mountain king's territory. According to the report of a local dragon-god, this god had seized and ravished the soul of a maiden on her wedding night. The deviant god confesses, is given three hundred lashes, then cash- iered, and a filial young man who had copied the Lankavatara Suitra is recommended to replace him. Thus proper legal procedures are applied in punishing the otherworldly evildoer and a new official is ap- pointed because of his personal virtue rather than mag- ical power or self-cultivation. The second case (chapter 33) involves that most an- cient of Marchmount Lords, the White Thearch. The Western Zhou state was brought to its knees by a beau- tiful woman named Bao Si tXW, resulting in a brief in- terregnum and the movement of the capital to the east. The White Thearch was indignant at the havoc wreaked 236</page><page sequence="12">KLEEMAN: Mountain Deities in China by this depraved female and determined to punish her by destroying the town of Bao from which she hailed. The god of Zitong, whose territory bordered on Bao, heard of this and, concerned for the innocents who would die, remonstrated with the Thearch, who ordered the White Thearch to desist. Again, a bureaucratic model is applied to interactions among mountain gods. Finally, there is the question of the relationship of mountain gods to Daoism. Mountains were the site of grotto-heavens fjl, where transcendent beings dwelled in pure splendor. These were also bureaucratized to a certain extent, and supplied with a complement of other- worldly soldiers who could quash nefast influences. Pos- sessors of potent talismans like the Chart of the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts (Wuyue xhenxing tu 25Bg1Ef ) could count on each marchmount dispatch- ing five of these divine warriors to protect them; but these transcendent gods would also report on their sins.58 The Shangqing patriarch Sima Chengzhen drew a sharp dis- tinction between the transcendent inhabitants of famous mountains and the vulgar gods, saying:59 Now the sacred shrines to the Five Marchmounts are all to gods of the mountains and forests. These are not duly appointed, perfected gods. The Five Marchmounts all have grotto headquarters and there are perfected men of Supreme Purity who descend to assume these posts. The god of Zitong also has some experience with these transcendent abodes. After his first and second human incarnations the god retreats to mountains to gather his wits and prepare for his next incarnation (chapters 20 and 30). In the first case, he proceeds to the grotto-heaven under Mount Monarch gal in the middle of Lake Dongting. In the second, it is to Snow Mountain in the Himalayas that he flies for respite after a tumultuous life, ending in forced suicide and three days of haunting his slayer. In each case he is granted a high title, fitting for one who had held high office at court during his lifetime. These alpine experiences are strongly Daoist in char- acter; the god devotes himself to repose and contempla- tion rather than the duties and responsibilities that characterize his other mountain posts. But notice that they precede the god's postings as mountain king. 58 Yunji qiqian HtsB-Xf , 79.17a/b, citing a Rite of the Chart of the True Form of the Five Marchmounts (Wuyue zhenxing tufa i). 59 Tongdian &amp;,i , cited in Gujin tushu jicheng, ce 491 ("Shenyi," juan 25), 10b. National god cults like that to the god of Zitong, na- scent in the Song, promoted a new, unified sacred realm in which gods of the terrestrial administration and divine transcendents intermingled. The astral reaches at the top of the pantheon were beyond the reach of dead humans subsisting on a diet of bloody victuals, but earthly transcendents and terrestrial gods were not so clearly separated. CONCLUSION In conclusion, let us pass in review some elements of Chinese mountains and their gods. Chinese mountains are inhabited by a variety of supernatural beings. The most famous of the peaks are the marchmounts. Origi- nally there were four marchmounts delimiting Chinese space and ruling over the supernatural forces in their respective quadrants. There were analogous and epony- mous human officials who ruled over the temporal spheres of each marchmount. The four marchmounts surrounded a central sacred peak, Mount Song, which represented the Chinese emperor. During late Warring States and Han times the central peak was added to the marchmounts, yielding a system of five that was corre- lated to the Five Agents. All were defined as within Chinese space, and the central peak lost its primacy. To a degree this role was later assumed by the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai. Other denizens of the mountains include mountain gods, ghosts of the dead, demons, and sprites, as well as fearsome fauna like tigers, wolves, and dholes. In early accounts all these creatures are dangerous be- cause of their capriciousness, amorality, and supernatu- ral powers. Over time the class of mountain gods was redefined as dead human beings filling fixed official posts in the supernatural bureaucracy; ghosts, sprites, and demons were subjugated to their rule. In this way the order of civilized life was gradually extended to the mountains, which had once been defined as a marginal realm beyond the confines of the Chinese world. Many of these changes are concretely represented in the cult to the god of Zitong. The god was origin- ally a snake controlling thunder and was related to other mountain gods of the northern Sichuan-southern Shaanxi region. In part because of the geographical location of the cult site, the god became known as a martial protector, first of the Sichuan region, then of the Chinese cultural sphere as a whole; as a protector, the god was provided with a human identity. Revelations in the twelfth century further redefined the god's image, providing several tales of the god's experiences as a mountain god and his interactions with other mountain 237</page><page sequence="13">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.2 (1994) deities. These tales reflect the increasing assimilation of all aspects of the divine world to the temporal order. Because the cult was founded on an amalgam of Daoist and popular beliefs and practices, cult lore minimized the distinction between the sphere of the divine moun- tain official and the transcendent inhabitants of the pure grotto-heavens deep within the mountain's belly. The unifying force in these changes is a tendency toward integration. The mountainous regions of China were integrated into its cultural space, the gods of these mountains were integrated into the larger pantheon of popular worship, and Daoist transcendents were inte- grated into a continuous, though hierarchically arrayed, pantheon incorporating all aspects of the divine world- what I call the unified sacred realm. These changes in the understanding of Chinese mountains and their gods were part of a larger trend toward incorporation and assimilation that has resulted in the highly syncretistic Chinese religious world of today. 238</page></plain_text>
