Printed in Great Britain ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, 1983-88 INTRODUCTION The two sections of this report have not been combined before in AR. In compiling them, I have been acutely aware that it would have been possible and probably easier to devote the space I have for six years' work in two areas to every year in each area. I have, to put it mildly, been highly selective; and where selection is the result of human frailty, whether my own or that of others, I have not hesitated to bow to the inevitable. The two treatments I have prepared below are very different in character. SARDINIA is still essentially terra incognita to all but the most enterprising classical archaeo- logists. I have therefore paid particular attention to recent advances that illustrate the island's crucial role in episodes hitherto regarded as the exclusive preserve of Aegean specialists-notably the activities of the Bronze Age entrepreneurs from Cyprus and the Levant who (I believe) paved the way for the first Western Greeks of the 8th century. Greek SOUTH ITALY, on the other hand, has long been basically familiar in the outside world-and is more so now than it was when Professor Trendall inaugurated these Reports a generation ago. Accordingly, in the reduced space that I have allowed myself for the flourishing classical scene in Campania, Apulia, Basilicata and Calabria, I have usually refrained from summarizing information that is already published: abstracts can never be a substitute for the real thing, and least of all for scholars and students whose institutions (particularly in Britain) can no longer afford to subscribe to even the main journals. Where I have had a choice, I have opted for news of projects that illustrate the methodological kinship that is increasingly being sought between classical and non-classical archaeology: hence the pictures of urban rescue in Naples and notes on field survey around Croton. At the end of this odyssey, it is only too clear to me that I have not done full justice either to the achievements or to the kindness of my main suppliers, all of whom had better things to do than cater to the needs of an emissary from a country that was and is able to contemplate the closure of University Departments of Classics and Archaeology. Readers of the following pages have reason to be more than usually grateful for the informa- tion and practical help of all kinds that I have received from: E. Acquaro, M.S. Balmuth, M.

In addition, I gratefully acknow- ledge the award of a Small Personal Research Grant from the British Academy, which enabled me to visit Italy in 1987 and Sardinia in 1988, when a generous invitation from the Istituto Magna Grecia to read a paper at the XXVIII Taranto Congress permitted up-dating-and compelled yet further selection.

As a result of the increasing interest in the native centres of the later Bronze Age, evidence of the 'Mycenaean connection' (AR 1981-82, 82f.) continues to be found in both Sardinia and South Italy-and indeed far beyond, in Latium vetus (LH IIIB: M. Angle &amp; A. Zarattini, Archeologia Laziale 8 [1987], 250-52) and even Andalucia (LH IIIB/C: J.C. Martin de la Cruz, Revista de Arqueologia 8.78 [1987] 62-64). Presentation and discus- sion proceed, especially at conferences, of which the following three published proceedings are fundamental: Magna Grecia e mondo miceneo = Atti XXII Taranto 1982 (I985), with the associated exhibition catalogue edited by L. Vagnetti, Nuovi Documenti; Trafici micenei nel Mediter- raneo: Palermo 1984 (Taranto; Ist. Magna Grecia, 1986); SSA 3. On the ceramic front, the Fitch Laboratory of the British School at Athens is currently committed to a major programme of provenance studies, using petro- graphic and chemical analysis (L. Vagnetti &amp; R.E. Jones, PGP 335-48; R.E. Jones &amp; P.M. Day, SSA 3, 257-70). For an overview in English of wider issues, notably the Aegean impact on the indigenous communities, see A.M. Bietti Sestieri, DialArch 6 (1988), 23-51. SARDINIA In late 1986, the death ofFerruccio Barreca, Archaeologi- cal Superintendent in Cagliari (responsible for the prov- inces of Cagliari [CA] and Oristano [OR]), robbed the academic world in Sardinia and far beyond of a wise administrator and a generous scholar whose name will always be associated with the great Phoenicio-Punic centres of Monte Sirai, Antas, Sulcis and Tharros. He is succeeded by Dr. Vincenzo Santoni. Dr Fulvia Lo</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, I983-88 13I Schiavo, Superintendent in Sassari (responsible for the provinces of Sassari [SS] and Nuoro [NU]), continues to inhibit synthesis of the Sardinian scene by a series of extraordinary achievements both in the field and in the local and international diffusion of useful knowledge. The first of the six years reviewed here saw both Sardinian Superintendents participating in the First Inter- national Colloquium on Sardinian Archaeology, organized by Professor Miriam S. Balmuth at Tufts University, Mass. and later published as SSA 2 (in English, like its predecessor SSA I, compiled from earlier Tufts occa- sions). In France, too, the Sardinian dimension is given its due weight in M. Gras, Trafics tyrrheniens archaiques (Rome; Ecole Fran:aise, 1985: rev. D. Ridgway, CR 38 [1988], II3f.); and much was learnt on the Italian mainland from a major exhibition held in Milan during 1985, and from its excellent catalogue (SPNM, marred only by a hopelessly misprinted chronological table). In Sardinia itself, the Cagliari Superintendency has initiated a series of Cagliari Quaderni, primarily designed to carry preliminary reports. The proceedings of two of the three international conferences held at Selargius, near Cagliari, in 1985, 1986 and 1987 have already been published under the general title of Un millennio di relazionifra la Sardegna e i paesi del Mediterraneo (Selargius I &amp; 2). A new journal, NBAS, has been founded by Carlo Delfino Editore (Piazza d'Italia I I, I-07 00 Sassari), who has also published three new monographs (cited below) in his Studi e Monumenti series, six volumes of Sardinian excavation reports reprinted from NSc I876- 1968 (four of them containing the contributions, I903- 39, of A. Taramelli) as Reprints, and a number of small Guide e Itinerari on individual sites and areas. Two extensively illustrated books published by the benemerito Banco di Sardegna succeed in doing justice to the resources of Il museo Sanna in Sassari (ed. F. Lo Schiavo, 1986) and L'Antiquarium arborense [Oristano] e i civici musei archeologici della Sardegna (ed. G. Lilliu, 1988). Many new museums have been opened during the last six years, promoted by the Superintendencies in collabora- tion with what must be some of the most enlightened local authorities in Europe; and the National [Sanna] Museum in Sassari and the Civic Museum in Nuoro have been substantially renewed. Space does not permit reference to the pre-nuragic sequence. It now includes a Lower Palaeolithic com- ponent in the form of the Clactonian material recovered around Perfugas and Laerru (SS; Sassari Quaderni I2, 1982). Nuragic, Cypro-Levantine and Greek. In a new synthesis of the nuragic scene (La civilta nuragica, Sassari; Delfino, 1982), G. Lilliu treats the centuries between I8oo and 238 B.C. in five phases that can be correlated chronologically and culturally with developments on the Italian mainland (CAH IV2 [1988], 786), and thus effec- tively demonstrates the degree to which Sardinia was capable of relationships with the outside world (cf F. Lo Schiavo, Nuragic Sardinia in its Mediterranean setting, Edinburgh [Munro Lectures], 1985). Ironically, the recognition of indisputable Mycenaean contact with Sardinia has been followed by the decisive arguments against Mycenaean influence on nuragic archi- tecture that have emerged from a detailed investigation by W.G. Cavanagh and R.R. Laxton (University of Nottingham) of the structural mechanics of the corbelled vaulting employed in Aegean tholoi and Sardinian nuraghi (most recently: SSA 3, 39-55). Their findings accord well with the different functions (burial and defence) of the structures concerned within their respect- ive cultures, and with the demonstrable fact that 'the realities of life were too different in Bronze Age Greece and in Sardinia for simple imitations to flourish' (ibid. 45). For the visitor, a good introduction to the reality of nuragic Sardinia is now conveniently available 50 km. from Cagliari at Villanovaforru (CA), where the Igth- century Monte Granatico building has been sensitively converted into a museum devoted to the major excava- tion conducted for many years by E. Atzeni (University of Cagliari) at the nearby nuragic complex centred on the well-preserved trilobate Nuraghe Genna Maria (AR 1979-8o, 60). In the library, readers should turn to a collective volume of research papers concerning the Nuraghe S. Antine and the territory around Torralba (SS), where the new (1988) Museo Civico della Valle dei Nuraghi recognizes the position of this magnificent monument as the hub of a sophisticated system of co- ordinated and intervisible defensive arrangements. The S. Antine volume contains a major report by S. Bafico and G. Rossi (University of Genoa) that combines an account of their 1983-84 soundings with a catalogue and statisti- cal presentation of G. Maetzke's I965-66 excavations (A. Moravetti, ed., Il Nuraghe S. Antine nel Logudoro-Meilogu, Sassari; Delfino, 1988, 6I-i88). In the field, meanwhile, the excavation of major nuragic sites continues to reveal the awe-inspiring scale of the concepts realized almost as a matter of routine by the local Bronze Age builders. I have limited the selection of examples to the province of Nuoro. There, south of Orroli, F. Lo Schiavo and M. Sanges (Nuoro Museum) have exposed more of the vast extent of the mighty polylobate Nuraghe Arrubiu (Fig. I), one of the largest nuragic fortresses in the island. Two previously-known sites in the territory of Orune, newly and profitably investigated by M.A. Fadda (Sassari Superintendency), remind us that efficient hydraulic engineering was as essential to survival in Sardinia during the Bronze Age as it is today. The chamber in the original central tower of the Nuraghe Loghelis (Fig. 2a) contains a spring connected by a channel (Fig. 2b) that passes through the tower wall and debouches into an open quadrangular pool lined with stone slabs (Fig. 2c). On a smaller scale, the excavation and conservation of the temple erected over a 'sacred' spring in the remote area known as Su Tempiesu affords an exquisite example of structural refinement that already has its own Delfino guide-book (whence Fig. 3). Sites like these suggest that even if Sardinian nuraghi (c. 8000 surviving examples) were as thin on the ground as Scottish brochs (c.400), it would still be unreasonable to regard the culture that produced them as a necessarily inferior party to any exchanges with its contemporaries in the outside world. Under this heading, the time has surely come to think in terms of 'interactions between equals', and not of mere sporadic 'influences' exerted by the allegedly more advanced Aegean and Levantine cultures on a remote and strangely passive periphery-a geographical status that is in any case belied by Sardinia's crucial strategic position in the central Mediterranean. Predictably, much has emerged from the continuing</page><page sequence="3">132 DAVID RIDGWAY Fig. I study of metalwork in Sardinia (general accounts: F. Lo Schiavo, NBAS I [1984], 21-40 and SSA 2, 231-50; C. Giardino, SSA 3, 189-222). In this respect, landmark status must be accorded to a major treatment of Late Cypriot imports to the West and their influence on local bronzework there: F. Lo Schiavo, E. Macnamara &amp; L. Vagnetti, BSR 53 (1985), I-7I. Drs Vagnetti and Lo Schiavo returned in 1988 to the Late Bronze Age role of the Cypriots in Western trade, with a valuable discussion of new Sardinian finds (forthcoming in EJ. Peltenburg, ed., Early Society in Cyprus, Edinburgh Univ. Press, whence the following quotations)-to say nothing of the identification of a fragmentary bronze sword from the Ka§ shipwreck (Ulu Burun, Turkey) as a common type in Middle/Late Bronze Age South Italy and Sicily, and thus, even if only scrap, as 'perhaps the earliest object of Western manufacture found in the Eastern Mediter- ranean' (Vagnetti). It seems too that East Mediterranean seafaring could have been responsible for the introduc- tion of ferrous metallurgy to Sardinia: a fragmentary wish-bone handle of Late Cypriot II base ring ware (earlier than I200; BSR cit. 6, fig. 2, 5) from the Nuraghe Antigori (Sarroch, CA) was associated in an undisturbed level there with a fragment of worked iron. The latter is defined as 'the earliest evidence of iron in the Western Mediterranean' by Dr Lo Schiavo. She suggests that the search for iron, rare in Cyprus and ubiquitous in Sardinia, potentially 'constitutes a better explanation for</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, 1983-88 133 Fig. 2a Fig. 2b Fig. 3 Fig. 2c the Cypriot presence in the West than the exchange of copper between the two islands richest in copper ores' and also provides a context for the early introduction to Sardinia of the investment or lost-wax method of casting bronze, already available in the East and vital to the production of the well-known Sardinian series of figurines (see below). It is now clear that the miniature bronze tripod-stand from the Grotta di Pirosu, Su Benatzu (Santadi, CA), far from being 'datable to the end of the 9th or to the beginning of the 8th century' (AR 1979-8o, 6I with 60, fig. 8), 'may as justifiably be dated within the span of the Late Cypriot III period, that is c. 200-I050 B.C., or closely after that period' (Macnamara, BSR cit. 35)-a diagnosis that also applies to the specimen in the recently published hoard from S. Maria in Pauilis (Ittiri, SS; E. Macnamara, D. &amp; F.R. Ridgway, British Museum OccP 45 [I984], 2-7). Indeed, a Late Cypriot III tripod-stand actually exported to Sardinia from Cyprus (Macnamara, BSR cit. 36-40) has come to light in a private collection in Oristano that also contains a bronze double-axe of the type represented in the S. Maria hoard and elsewhere in the island, together with a pair of tongs and a charcoal- shovel-types of unequivocally smithing tool, also encountered elsewhere in Sardinia (but not in the Italian peninsula), that find close parallels in the 13th-century Enkomi Foundry Hoard in Cyprus (Lo Schiavo, BSR cit. 23-28). It is not yet possible to decide whether fragments of two more tripod-stands were imported from Cyprus or manufactured in Sardinia by imported Cypriot craft- smen: they were recovered in the preliminary rescue excavation, directed by Dr Fadda, of the nuragic sanctu- ary at S'Arcu 'e is Forras (Villagrande Strisaili, NU; brief report in Peltenburg cit.), which also yielded abundant evidence of foundry activity provisionally assigned to the Recent/Final Bronze Age (c.1300-900). There too, and from the nearby Nuraghe Corte Acca (and elsewhere), yet more fragments of ox-hide ingots must be added to the distribution map of the</page><page sequence="5">134 DAVID RIDGWAY category that currently has most to contribute to the definition of the Cypriot connection. The bibliography generated by physico-chemical and lead isotope analyses of ingots is already vast, and Dr Lo Schiavo has pleaded (in Peltenburg cit.) for caution in the evaluation of what are, after all, still preliminary archaeometric results. Accordingly, I limit myself to recording that the com- position of the plano-convex 'bun' ingots appears to match that of nuragic artefacts presumably made in Sardinia; the prospect of a Cypriot origin for Sardinia's ox-hide ingots, adumbrated in detail by N.H. Gale and Z.A. Stos-Gale (Oxford; SSA 3, 135-78; PGP 349-84), raises complex questions of interpretation. But there can be little doubt that resident Cypriot bronzeworkers were active and influential in Sardinia by the 12th/Iith cen- tury, and that Sardinia participated in long-distance Mediterranean exchanges during the immediately ensu- ing centuries (V. Karageorghis &amp; F. Lo Schiavo, RSF 17 [I989], i-Io; L. Vagnetti, BSA 84 [I989], in press). In the circumstances, it is not surprising that more than one authority has recalled the nuragic bronze figurines and their notorious lack of a firm chronology derived from secure contexts at home. Their undoubted manufacture in Sardinia is traditionally seen as one result of the arrival of Phoenician prospectors and colonists in the 9th and 8th centuries, an explanation apparently confirmed by the sporadic occurrence of nuragic bronzes in Villanovan and even Orientalizing contexts in Etruria. It will be interesting to see how long this chronological diagnosis will survive the addition to the Sardinian archaeological record of a substantial and decidedly earlier Cypro-Levantine component, demonstrably cap- able of stimulating an indigenous taste for (and the indigenous production of) technologically advanced lux- ury items. It has in fact already been suggested that some Sardinian bronzetti could have been made significantly earlier than c.900 (F.R. Serra Ridgway, SSA 2, 84-IOI; SSA 3, 251-55). True, the often-cited nuragic figurine from the Villanovan Cavalupo cemetery at Vulci in Etruria comes from a grave that is firmly dated to the second half of the 9th century: but there is no reason to suppose that this piece is early enough in the Sardinian series to constitute a terminus post quem for all the unassociated pieces in the Sardinian (and other) museums. Stylistically, indeed, the Vulci piece seems to be relatively late in its series, and its potential availability as a terminus ante quem merits further investigation. A telling addition to the arguments in favour of the high dating of at least some bronzetti comes from the Nuraghe Sa Mandra 'e Sa Giua (Ossi, SS), where in 1983 M.L. Ferrarese Ceruti (University of Cagliari) recovered part of a battered and broken figurine (Fig. 4) from a layer that is unlikely to have been sealed later than the ioth century (Studi in onore di G. Lilliu, Cagliari 1985, 5I-6I). The debate continues, with signs of a cautious raising of dates in some quarters. Thus a figurine from a grave in the nuragic cemetery adjacent to the 6th century Punic temple at Antas (Fluminimaggiore, CA) was assigned to 'the end of the 9th/beginning of the 8th century' in 1985 (SPNM 314f., ill. ic); following publication of its associ- ations (G. Ugas, Selargius 2, 255--6), it is now tentatively dated to 'the late ioth century?' (L'Antiquarium arborense cit. 220f., ill. IO). A close parallel (Fig. 5) comes from the important votive assemblage recently found by D. Rovina (Sassari Superintendency) in the nuragic sanctu- Fig. 4 ary of Serra Niedda (Sorso, SS; NBAS 3, forthcoming). For the moment, it needs to be stressed that not even the staunchest advocate of higher dates for Sardinian bronzetti is proposing to take them all back to the Final Bronze Age. That would be a most unlikely chronological collocation for several pieces, old and new-among them the charming lion(-cub?) (Fig. 6), now in a private collection in Nuoro and said to have been found at S'Arcu 'e is Forras (above), which finds close parallels in the imposing limestone beasts at Sulcis and Tharros, dated by Professor Barreca respectively to the late 6th/ early 5th and 4th/3rd centuries (F. Lo Schiavo, forth- coming). Non-combatants will have realized that the foregoing lines are not concerned with a wrangle about dates for their own sake. Put bluntly, 'aristocratic' (P. Bernardini, ParPass 37 [1982], 8I-IOI; NBAS 2, forthcoming) is the inevitable definition of the society that required and could commission so many sophisticated buildings and bronzes. Must we refrain from applying this label to the indigenous nuragic communities until the 8th-7th cen- turies and the impact of 'true' Phoenician colonization that they reveal? Or may we contemplate its application during the 12th-Iith centuries, which saw the zenith of interaction between the nuragic and Cypro-Levantine worlds and the consequent explosion of Sardinian metal- lurgy and trade?

Bafico, Selargius i, 91-93). The many Etruscan and Greek imports received by Sardinia between 620 and 480 have been collected and classified by G. Ugas and R. Zucca (II commercio arcaico in Sardegna, Cagliari; Viali, I984-usefully appraised by C. Tronchetti, AIONArchStAnt 7 [i985], 209-I9; and see now id., I Sardi: traffici, relazioni, ideologie nella Sardegna arcaica, Milan; Longanesi, 1988). Phoenicio-Punic. The fruits of the long-standing and exemplary working relationship between the CNR Istituto per la Civilta Fenicia e Punica in Rome and the Cagliari Superintendency are to be seen in the constant stream of Sardinian reports and papers in the Istituto's own journal, RSF, and in a wide range of other period- icals at home and abroad. New general statements have been made, too, notably in the Delfino Studi e Monumenti series: E. Acquaro, Arte e cultura punica in Sardegna (1984) and F. Barreca, La civiltafenicio-punica in Sardegna (1986; see also iid. in BdA 3 I-32 [1985], on 'Fenici e Cartaginesi in Italia'). General Western issues were treated at length in the first section of a conference held in 1982 at the Accademia dei Lincei (Fenici e Arabi nel Mediterraneo, 1983), and have figured largely in the scholarly output of A.M. Bisi (eg. Studi Urbinati/B3 59 [1986], II-34). At a different level, Professor Sabatino Moscati was the prime mover of a memorable Phoenicio-Punic exhibi- tion mounted in 1988 at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice. The 'book of the exhibition' contains a series of exten- sively illustrated and authoritative essays on the principal areas settled by Phoenicians and Carthaginians, and on the great variety of artefact categories they either brought with them or made in their new homes. The simultaneous publication of an English-language edition of this item (S. Moscati, ed., The Phoenicians, London; Murray) surely exonerates me from a detailed survey of one of the principal sources of the new information in it. Work continues however, and the revision of standard accounts proceeds apace. In I984, for example, excava- tions by the Sassari Superintendency revealed abundant Punic additions to the Nuraghe Sa Tanca 'e Sa Mura I (Monteleone Roccadoria, SS; R. Rivo, RSF 13 [1985], 269-73). The structural situation and the associated finds are clearly both the result of peaceful cohabitation rather than military occupation; this is a hitherto unattested feature of the northern hinterland. No less rare is the unequivocal evidence yielded here for Punic glass-mak- ing in Sardinia. To the south, 1984 also saw the inaugura- tion of a programme of underwater survey of the Phoenicio-Punic ports, co-ordinated by the Cagliari Superintendency in collaboration with an Israeli-Ameri- can mission directed by E. Linder (University of Haifa; Ricerca sugli antichi insediamenti fenici/Sardinian coastal study project [Cagliari Quaderni I], I986). Attention has been devoted initially to the ideal opportunities afforded by the Oristanese coast between S. Giovanni di Sinis and Capo Mannu-Tharros and Bosa. In a very different world, the British Museum's quondam 'Great Sardinian Collection', assembled at the former site, has been published by the distant successors of the Trustees who acquired it in 1856: R.D. Barnett &amp; C. Mendleson, eds., Tharros: a catalogue of material ... (1987). At Tharros (OR) itself, excavation by the CNR Istituto has continued, and so has the punctual produc- tion in RSF of annual preliminary reports and studies by Professor Acquaro and his colleagues in the University of Bologna, the Cagliari Superintendency and elsewhere. Notable finds and features of the last five years include the publication of 14 new Phoenicio-Punic tombs of the 6th and (mainly) 5th-4th centuries in the southern cemetery (F. Molina Fajardo, RSF 12 [1984], 77-IOI); the discovery in a 2nd-century context immediately outside the tophet of a remarkable terracotta represen- tation of a lion-headed divine being (E. Acquaro, ibid. 49-5 , whence Fig. 9); and the publication of the I6th- Isth century nuragic village of Su Muru Mannu (V. Santoni, RSF 13 [1985], 33-I40). Fig. 9 Finally, those primarily concerned with Sardinia's earlier periods will find much to interest them in Robert J. Rowland Jr.'s annotated typological inventory of Roman sites and material (including that encountered in nuraghi, domus de janas etc.): ANRW II.II.I (1988), 740-875. SOUTH ITALY The second section of this report is shorter than any previous AR treatment of South Italy. Far from denoting a decline in archaeological activity there, this reflects the ease with which current progress can now be followed by means of new instruments that have been designed for precisely this purpose. Foremost among these is the Bibliografia Topografica della Colonizzazione Greca in Italia (Pisa, Scuola Normale/Rome, Ecole Francaise, I977-), of which vol. VI (1987) classifies the vast 1981-85 bibliography by author and subject; the latest instalment (V, 1987) of the alphabetical site index reaches Crotone. Another source is, and has been since 196I, the success- ful series of thematic Convegni di Studi sulla Magna Grecia held annually in Taranto under the aegis of the Istituto per la Storia e l'Archeologia della Magna Grecia. Their proceedings also contain detailed illustrated reviews of</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, 1983-88 137 new discoveries compiled by the South Italian Superin- tendents and their associates. These are invaluable; so too are the thematic Cahiers and other publications of the Centre Jean Berard (Via F. Crispi 86, I-8oi21 Napoli) and a number of relatively new and now well-established national and local journals-especially the Annali (sez. Archeologia e Storia Antica; ed. B. d'Agostino) of the Istituto Universitario Orientale, Naples, and Taras (see Apulia). Scholars and students whose libraries do not possess at least BTCGI, Atti Taranto, AIONArchStAnt and Taras in addition to the older Italian and other periodicals (eg. BdA, DialArch, MonAnt, NSc, ParPass, MEFRA etc.) could not hope to be well-informed about South Italian affairs even by an annual full-length report on them in these pages. In the circumstances, my aim below is simply to indicate some of the main headings under which the discoveries and exegeses of the last five years in Campania, Apulia, Basilicata and Calabria have contributed more than ever before to the mainstream of classical archaeology. Sadly, I must record here the death of Paola Zancani Montuoro in 1987. Throughout her long and active life, 'Donna Paola' vigorously promoted all that was and is good in the archaeology of the Mezzogiorno, not least by her own magnificent example in the field (the Heraion at the mouth of the Sele, Francavilla Marittima in Oenotria) and in the editorial chairs of NSc and of her own ASMG. Her writings will long continue to inform and delight future generations, and it is good to learn that a collection of them is being prepared. Another collection is no less eagerly awaited in South Italy and elsewhere: the Proceedings, due in early I990 from the Oxford University Press, of the First Australian Congress of Classical Archaeology, held at the University of Sydney in 1985 to honour A.D. Trendall under the appropriate title of Greek Colonists and Native Populations -a field in which the honorand has subsequently published the major work on Paestan vases recorded below and the brilliant synthesis Red Figure Vases of South Italy and Sicily (London; Thames &amp; Hudson, 1989). CAMPANIA. The familiarity of Campania to English readers has been greatly increased by the publication of the late (and still sadly missed) Martin Frederiksen's Campania, edited with additions by N. Purcell for the British School at Rome (1984: rev. A.J. Graham, CR 36 [1986], 105-08). Another piece of major research has also been published by the British School: A.D. Trendall, Red-figured Vases of Paestum (1987). Treatment of the c.2000 vases available for attribution follows the scheme of RVLCS and RVAp, with a view to establishing the place of Paestan vases in the wider context of South Italian vase-painting-which, as Professor Trendall remarks with unique authority, 'is now in a somewhat less confused state than it was at the time when Paestan Pottery [1936] was published'. In the northern part of the region, the Archaeological Superintendency in Naples (responsible for the provinces of Naples and Caserta) was finally relieved in 1982 of the Roman cities around Vesuvius, which are now administered from Pompei by their own Superin- tendency (Dr Baldassare Conticello). The Superin- tendent in Naples, Dr Enrica Pozzi, was the driving force behind an exhibition at the National Museum in 1985- 86, its massive catalogue of saggi and schede (an indispens- able introduction to current research in Naples and around the Gulf from prehistoric to Roman times: Napoli antica, Naples; Macchiaroli, 1985) and a new bulletin series published by the Superintendency (Arch- eologia in Campania I [1987]). There is a good deal of raw material (from Capua, Suessa Aurunca, Cales, Calatia and Suessula) in W. Johannowsky, Materiali di eta arcaica dalla Campania (Naples; Macchiaroli, 1983), and much of interest in the conference proceedings edited by C. Albore Livadie, Tremblements de terre, eruptions volcaniques et vie des hommes dans la Campanie antique (Naples; Centre Berard, 1986) and in the collection of essays by F. Zevi et al., I Campi Flegrei (Naples; Macchiaroli, 1987). The almost limitless need for urban rescue archaeology in Naples itself (eg. Fig. IO: Via Carminiello ai Mannesi) Fig. IO was discussed at an international conference at the Villa Pignatelli there in 1983 (Archeologia urbana e centro antico di Napoli, Documenti &amp; Atti, Taranto; Ist. Magna Grecia, 1983 &amp; 1984). The problems reviewed on this memor- able occasion, and more besides, were encountered dur- ing B. d'Agostino's excavations in Piazza S. Domenico Maggiore (Palazzo Corigliano tra archeologia e storia, Naples; Ist. Univ. Orientale, 1985, whence Fig. II: a Hellenistic drain). At Pithekoussai (Lacco Ameno, Ischia), there is at the time of writing still no reason to apply the description 'in the press' rather than 'forthcoming' (AR 1981-82, 65) to G. Buchner and D. Ridgway, Pithekoussai I, submitted in 1979 to the Editorial Committee of the Accademia dei Lincei for publication as a MonAnt monograph. The Committee's chairman, Professor M. Pallottino, informs me in February 1989 that the edited manuscript will be despatched to the printers in 'late Spring or Summer 1989'; see meanwhile the present writer's general account of the first Western Greeks (L'Alba della Magna Grecia, Milan; Longanesi, 1984) and S.S. Leach's investigation of their Etruscan heirs (Subgeometric pottery from Southern Etruria, Gothenburg; Astr6m, 1987). Since these items have appeared, C.W. Neeft has added the Protocorin- thian aryballoi from the San Montano cemetery (Proto- corinthian Subgeometric Aryballoi, Amsterdam [Allard</page><page sequence="9">138 DAVID RIDGWAY Fig. 12 Fig. II Pierson ser. 7], 1987, index s.v. 'Lacco Ameno', nos. ii 8-I271) to the Pithekoussan categories treated in the thematic items noted in my last report and in his own earlier classifications of Corinthian LG kotylai (BABesch 50 [1975], 97-134) and the Thapsos class (MEFRA 93 [1981], 7-88); see too N. Kourou's useful observations on the enigmatic handmade Argive Monochrome vases (and their contents) at Pithekoussai and elsewhere (Procs. 3rd Symposium, Copenhagen cit. 314-24). Neeft's identifica- tion of two globular aryballos workshops at Pithekoussai is convincing, and their staff of expatriate Corinthian potters/painters (Aryballoi cit. 59-65) constitutes an inter- esting precedent for the Demaratean fictores-and perhaps a hint, too, of the commercial sector in which 'Demaratus' himself, prior to c.657, 'became possessed of great wealth' (Dion. Hal. 3.46.3). Of the vast array of ceramic types present in the acropolis dump on Monte di Vico, the second of the Centre Berard's new Cahiers des Amphores accounts for the East Greek, Attic SOS, Mas- saliot, Etruscan, Phoenicio-Punic and local amphoras (N. Di Sandro, Le anfore arcaiche dallo Scarico Gosetti, Pithe- cusa, 1986: rev. P. Bartoloni, RSF 15 [I987], 104-09, with extensive additional comments on the Phoenicio- Punic and unidentified pieces). Elsewhere, Dr Buchner has illustrated a selection of the painted Neolithic pottery (Fig. 12) from loc. Cilento, Porto d'Ischia, in a re- assessment of his island's volcanic history (Tremblements de terre cit. 145-88) that also sheds new light on the sources of the vulcanological letters that Sir William Hamilton wrote to the Royal Society in the i8th cen- tury. Lastly, all concerned with the role of Euboea in early East-West exchanges have been reminded that the homeland of the Pithekoussans was traditionally 'famous for its ships' (Hor. Hymn Apollo 219) by the discovery at Lefkandi of the sturdy sea-going vessel painted on a local pyxis c.85o-825 (M. Popham, Oxford J. Archaeology 6 [1987] 353-59; id., 'Preliminary Report', in this issue of AR, Fig. 21); on the somewhat later shipwreck scene from Pithekoussai, see D. Ridgway in Studies Webster II, Bristol I988, 97-To7. Pompei makes a rare appearance in these pages as a result of important developments in its pre-Roman (and pre-Samnite) history. In his definitive report on A. Maiuri's 1931-32 and 1942-43 Saggi nell'area del tempio di Apollo a Pompei (AIONArchStAnt Quaderni 3, I986), which includes a full catalogue of well-preserved poly- chrome architectural terracottas of the late 6th century, S. De Caro releases a great deal of much-needed informa- tion on the subject of Greek and Etrusco-Campanian artistic relations-as well as achieving the first proper critical edition of a public monument at Pompeii. There too, M. BonghiJovino has edited a detailed report on the 1976-79 investigation by the University of Milan of the structural development of insula VI.5, containing the so- called 'House of the Etruscan column' (Ricerche a Pompei I, Rome; L'Erma, 1984, 2 vols: revs. D. Ridgway, CR 37 [1987], II2f.; R. Ling,JRS 78 [1988], 222f.). In southern Campania, the Archaeological Superin- tendency in Salerno (Dr Giuliana Tocco Sciarelli) is responsible for the provinces of Salerno, Avellino and Benevento. Readers should already be acquainted with the published results of, for example, recent Austrian work at Velia (F. Krinzinger, RomHistMitt 28 [1986], 31-56; 29 [I987], I9-43) and of the French/Italian and American/Italian projects at Paestum: E. Greco and D. Theodorescu, Poseidonia-Paestum (Coll. Ecole Francaise de Rome 42: I [1980], La 'Curia'; II [I983], L'Agora; III [1987], Forum nord); and the brief reports by Professors J.G. Pedley (University of Michigan) and M. Torelli (University of Perugia) on their 1982-84 seasons (AJA 87 [1983], 292-303; 88 [1984], 367-76; 89 [I985], 53-60). In I986, a major exhibition on the sources of Neo-Doric architecture, understandably centred on the temples at Paestum, was shown in Italy and New York. A reduced</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, I983-88 I39 English-language version of the two-volume Italian cata- logue was prepared for the latter occasion: J. Raspi Serra, ed., Paestum and the Doric revival 1750-1830, Florence; Centro Di. In 1986, the Carlsberg Foundation supported the first season of excavations conducted by the Institute of Classical Archaeology, University of Copenhagen, at Pontecagnano. Professor I. Strom, co-director with Dr M. Nielsen, kindly informs me that four trenches were opened in loc. Avallone, of which two revealed ashlar walls running parallel to the long walls of the insulae excavated c.ioo m. to the west by Professor d'Agostino in I967. The pottery of the destruction level was mainly datable to the years around 300, but immediately above lay a bronze coin from the final minting period of Paestum, around or shortly after 40 B.C. Most of the material in the northernmost trench dates to the 4th-3rd centuries; the lowest levels reached the Archaic period, represented by 'Italo-Geometric' and bucchero. Work continues in i989. Previous work at Roccagloriosa has yielded import- ant evidence bearing on several aspects of later Iron Age life in western Lucania (AR 1981-82, 68; NSc 1980, 103- 09). Since 1982, a new Canadian project directed by Professor M. Gualtieri (University of Alberta) has con- centrated on the habitation inside the fortified circuit on the central plateau, of crucial interest for the study of the 4th-century settlement following the discovery of a votive area within a residential building and of evidence for specialized workshops (EchCl 28 [1984], 187-202; 29 [1985], 257-66). Further work in 1987 substantially clarified the chronology and layout of this significant group of buildings, and is reported in EchCl 32 (1988); a major element is the paved courtyard-portico complex, c. 8 m. long (Fig. 13), with a well-preserved stone shrine in the north-east corner. Professor Gualtieri suggests that 4th-century Roccagloriosa may have inherited the role of the archaeologically elusive centre known to Strabo (C 253) as Pyxous. The contemporary survey of the surrounding region, extending to the whole of the Mingardo valley, reveals an unprecedented occupation of the countryside from the later Classical period onwards, and also illustrates in detail the process of Romanization in the area after the establishment of the Roman colony of Buxentum. APULIA. The longest Italian Soprintendenza Archeolo- gica-delle Puglie, in Taranto (Dr Pier Giovanni Guzzo)-needs the shortest report, for the excellent reason that nearly all the appropriate information is readily available elsewhere. English readers will be aware that the Society of Antiquaries of London has at last produced the first instalment of its three-volume source-book for the pre- historic archaeology of the classical Daunia, first revealed in the late John Bradford's pioneer air-photographs over 40 years ago: G.D.B. Jones et al., Apulia I: Neolithic settlement in the Tavoliere (1987; new Italian work in the same area and period is usefully discussed by R.D. Whitehouse, Antiquity 60 [1986], 36-44). As in Fig. 13</page><page sequence="11">i40 DAVID RIDGWAY Campania, it is a pleasure to salute the completion in 1982 of another fundamental work on South Italian vase- painting: the second volume and the indexes of A.D. Trendall and A. Cambitoglou, Red-figured Vases of Apulia (Oxford). The first supplement has already appeared (BICS Supp. 42, 1983), and more are confidently expec- ted; see too the sumptuous account of Le peintre de Darius et son milieu (Geneva [Hellas et Roma, 4], 1986) by C. Aellen, A. Cambitoglou and J. Chamay. For the rest, readers should consult Taras, the indis- pensable archaeological journal edited in the Superin- tendency (and now published by Editrice Scorpione, Via Mazzini 5, 1-74Ioo Taranto). Since its foundation in I981, this has been a mine of information-with numerous prompt, detailed and well-illustrated reports on the rescue excavations in the Tarentine necropoleis and elsewhere (eg. the 1979 excavations at Madonna delle Grazie, Rutigliano [Late Bronze Age-Hellenistic], A. Ciancio &amp; F. Radina, Taras 3 [1983], 7-6I), as well as new syntheses of topics (eg. the archaeological evidence for cult at Taras: E. Lippolis, ibid. 2 [I982], 8I-135) and sites (eg. pre-Roman and Roman Arpi: M. Mazzei, ibid. 4 [I984], 7-46). In 1987, Dr Guzzo initiated the admir- able practice of publishing brief illustrated summaries in Taras of the work conducted in his area during the preceding 12 months in time for the annual Taranto Magna Grecia conferences. The first two of these Notiziari (also sold separately as estratti anticipati from Taras 7 [I987] and 8 [I988]) together amount to 257pp and I34pls; they follow the earlier reports on Apulian work in the Palaeolithic-Medieval range compiled by the former Superintendent, Professor E.M. De Juliis (ibid. 5 [1985], 7-36 on I970-77 and 177-277 on I978-84), whose own Gli Iapigi (Milan; Longanesi, I988) is written from an indigenous point of view-and is thus the first account of non-Greek Apulia since M. Mayer's classic Apulien (1914). Other useful publications promoted wholly or in part by the Superintendency include a handbook to the Necropoli d'Egnazia (Gnathia) by G. Andreassi and A. Cocchiaro (Fasano; Grafischena, 1987); and Profili della Daunia antica 1-3 (I986-88), permanent records of the 'extra-mural' lecture-programmes organized annually in collaboration with the uficio distac- cato in Foggia (Dr M. Mazzei). Somewhat invidiously, I have singled out one site in Apulia for individual men- tion, on the grounds that during the period under review it has yielded evidence for an important new chapter in the history of Italic anthropomorphic representation. The protohistoric settlement and its cemetery of col- lective rock-cut tombs at Monte Saraceno (Mattinata) have shed a completely new light on the Gargano, and indeed on northern Apulia generally, in the centuries that span the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. More than 200 tombs in the late Ioth-early 8th/7th-century range have been excavated since work was resumed there in 1981 under the joint auspices of the Taranto Superintendency and its 'Special' (ie. Pre- historic/Ethnographic) counterpart at the Pigorini Museum in Rome; I am most grateful to the director of operations, Dr M.L. Nava, for permitting me to consult a number of her forthcoming papers. As is now well- known in Italy, the Monte Saraceno tombs have yielded a considerable number of stone semata in the form of three-dimensional human heads, iconic (Fig. I4: tomb 22-1983, late 9th/early 8th century) and aniconic, and Fig. 14 stylized geometric shields; this extraordinary series clearly stands in a genetic relationship to the stele daunie of the 7th-6th centuries (AR 1981-82, 69f.). The personal ornaments (bronze, iron, amber, glass paste, bone and horn) in the tombs indicate that the status of the inhabitants of Monte Saraceno was compatible with a leading role in the complex social pattern of northern Apulia by the Early Iron Age; in addition, the coastal situation of this important centre is ideal for the trans- Adriatic commercial exchanges documented by the sig- nificant number of Illyrian items in the corredi. See further Dr Nava's introduction to the excellent catalogue of the exhibition of the Monte Saraceno sculptures recently mounted in the Castel Sant'Angelo, Rome (M.L. Nava, ed., Pietre del Gargano, Turin; I1 Quadrante, 1987); her edited volume on Le Stele della Daunia (Banca del Monte di Foggia, 1988); and, in English, the paper she read at the 1985 Sydney Conference. BASILICATA. Four important new books contain a wealth of detailed information on many sites and topics covered in my last report on this region (AR 1981-82, 73- 79): A. Pontrandolfo Greco, I Lucani (Milan; Longanesi, 1982); A. Bottini, Principi guerrieri della Daunia del VII sec.: le tombe principesche di Lavello (Bari; De Donato, 1982); I Greci sul Basento (Como; New Press, I986- catalogue of the Milan exhibition of Professor P.

The following notes on I983-88 work are / an incomplete reflection of the detailed summary prepared for me by Dr Angelo Bottini, Archaeological Superintendent in Potenza, and Dr M. Tagliente, to . ) whom my best thanks are due. For the protohistoric period, a total of c.ISo tombs have been excavated in two cemeteries near S. Maria d'Anglona: those at Valle Sorigliano are rich in bronze) )^ ornaments, weapons and utensils; the contemporary but poorer corredi at nearby Cocuzzolo Sorigliano suggest that this cemetery was used by a different class. At( L'Incoronata, high priority has been given to defining the extent of the settlement and the cemetery, and Y ) . clarifying the course of the 'pre-Metapontine' Helleniza- . tion of this important centre. It is now clear that a straight cobbled road, with drainage channel, divided the settlement from the cemetery in the second half of the ( 8th century; in close proximity to this significant feature, a grave that differs from the rest in both structure and rite must be that of a foreigner, honoured (but not com- pletely assimilated) by the local community; tombs 454 and 455 have been identified as belonging to local chieftains. A separate group of 23 burials, contemporary with Greek Incoronata, includes a number ofenchytrismoi in Corinthian amphoras and other large containers very n Y similar to those encountered at Siris. Two structures of / Fig. i6 the Early Iron Age on the acropolis of Toppo d'Aguzzo are defined respectively as a square store- rectangular dwelling with copious domestic pottery. Two Oenotrian centres in southern Basilicata are now particularly informative. At Alianello in the Agri val- \',' . . ... \ley, c.9oo burials (selection in BdA 24 [1984], ii-i6) A ~ A A~ have now been recovered in the period between the first half of the 7th and the beginning of the 5th century. At / A the early end of this range, a number of more elaborate depositions, mainly female (Fig. 15: tomb 286), are A L A A t Eespecially interesting; in addition to the bronze armour in AA8&amp; ose c g n o the male burials, they yielded considerable quantities (Fig. 16: tomb 234) of imported Corinthian sub-Thapsos F' halfcups and aryballoi of the 7th century and Ionic cups and Fig. 15 other table ware of the 6th, along with Etruscan bronze</page><page sequence="13">142 DAVID RIDGWAY vessels and (locally produced?) bucchero-confirming the existence of a relationship between this Oenotrian group and the Etruscanized centres of Campania (par- ticularly Pontecagnano) that may indeed have been one of mediation between the latter and the Greeks of Siris. Among the similar tombs excavated at Chiaromonte in the Sinni valley, a male corredo is clearly that of a late 7th- century warrior chief, with sword, complete bronze panoply of Greek type (Corinthian helmet, round shield, greaves), horse bit and drepanon; his princely status is confirmed by the associated banqueting equipment (Greek and Etruscan bronze vessels and iron spits and firedogs). In the centuries prior to the Roman conquest, the Lucanian presence is documented by four types of site: fortified centres, sanctuaries, rural habitation sites and cemeteries. Under the first and second headings, work has continued respectively at Serra di Vaglio and Rossano, which has yielded fragments of at least two life-size bronze statues. The sanctuary at Satriano, in the Potentino, was in use between the first half of the 4th and the end of the 3rd century, and consists of a rectangular building (defined as a banquet hall) with a facade preceded by a wooden portico, an oikos and a dry-stone surrounding wall; the finds include pottery thymiateria, votive terracottas, spits and an iron sword. Of the rural habitations, that of Cancellara includes a rectangular apsidal structure with robust stone foundations and a heavy roof, datable around the mid-sth century; its extension of c. i6o m.2 is comparable to that of the large and nearly contemporary oikoi of Serra di Vaglio. The 3rd-century house at Tolve-Valle di Chirico (Poten- tino) produced interesting ceramic votive material, redolent of domestic sacra. Small rural burying grounds such as those at Albano (Potentino) and Montemurro (upper Agri valley), generally ranging in date from the second half of the 4th to the early 3rd century, document the existence of scattered Lucanian farming communities. The cemetery at S. Brancato, half-way up the Agri valley, seems to indicate a larger centre-again with Campanian contacts, demonstrated by the presence of Paestan red-figure alongside the more frequent Lucanian version. By contrast, Apulian connections are indicated by numerous large red-figured vases attributed to the workshop of the Darius Painter from the 4th-century tomb 33 at Timmari in the Materano, which also yielded a bronze spearhead and the remains of a helmet and a cuirass, together with yet more 'aristocratic' banqueting equipment. The major Daunian centre of Lavello (Roman Fore- ntum) continues to yield impressive evidence that merits a more detailed exposition than is possible here: some of it is on show at the new National Museum in Melfi. Most notable, perhaps, is a 'palatial' structure of the end of the 5th century, with closed courtyard and covered vestibule decorated with gorgon antefixes; a potnios hippon akroterion and the nearby tomb of a horse afford signifi- cant indications of local priorities, and the Attic and colonial imports and bronze vessels and armour in other tombs confirm the elevated social status of the pro- prietors. On the acropolis, a public building complex of the 4th century is accompanied by yet another group of rich burials, in the contents of which the warrior element is frequently attested both in the form of actual panoplies and pictorial representations on vases. Of the Greek cities, Superintendency operations at Metaponto have been directed mainly towards restora- tion in the sanctuary and agora, in connection with the planned parco archeologico. Excavations at Temple C (probably of Athena) have shed light on its structural history, and have taken the earliest cult activities in its area back to the second half of the 7th century. I am grateful to Professor J.C. Carter (University of Texas at Austin) for the following account of a particularly interesting development in the chora:- 'During the fall of 1982 a large area of tombs came to light 3.5 km. from the ancient city along the north bank of the Basento and close to the rural sanctuary at Pantanello (AR 1981-82, 75). Three full excavation campaigns, 1983-86, brought to light 314 burials (and 45 ceramic deposits) in an area of approximately 4000 m.2, ranging in date from 580 (LC) to 280 (Gnathia). The particular value of this discovery lies in the fact that the necropolis was found practically intact; the entire area was thoroughly explored. The fortunate outcome of this salvage excavation was thus a statistically valid data base for burials, to complement that for an area of rural settlement furnished by the survey. 'Pantanello was 'rich' by the standards of colonial Greek necropoleis. In the late 6th and first half of the sth century, the stone sarcophagus was the preferred con- tainer. It is replaced later by a cappucina tile burials, simple earthern graves, and, in the late 4th century, by the massive stone cists and cremations. Grave goods included an unusually wide variety of ceramic vessels, with, however, the skyphoi, lekythoi and lebetes gamikoi predominating, as might have been expected (Fig. 17: tomb 212). There were many Athenian imports, by such painters as the Nikoxenos Painter (Fig. 18: Dionysos and Semele [c.S Io0 from tomb 292, of a female aged 30-40), the Berlin Painter and the Agathon Painter (from the circle of Polygnotos). In the second half of the sth century these give place to the Pisticci and Amykos Painters (15 vases), the Creusa and Dolon Painters and later Lucanian and Apulian masters such as the Darius and Underworld Painters. A study of the black-glazed pottery has made possible the reliable relative dating of most of the burials. Bronze mirros (Fig. I9: death of Actaeon [c.45o] from tomb 350, of a female aged c.3o), strigils and (in the late 4th century) coins are numerous; jewellery is less plentiful (Fig. 20: golden Erotes with scrolls [c.30o] from tomb 71, of a female aged I8-20). 'Similar material is known from other sites, such as the Locri necropolis. The unique contribution of the Pan- tanello necropolis is that, for the first time in Magna Graecia, the full range of information available from the study of the human skeletal material has not only been brought to light, but also brought to bear on the problem of the historical settlement of the territory. 'Information about blood types and genetically transmitted conditions such as metopism have been combined with observations about spatial arrangement and burial customs to determine family groups. A further result has been to confirm the suspicions, based on sparse documentary evidence and parallels with Poseidonia and other centres, that there was a change in the ethnic character of the population who buried at Pantanello in the second half of the 4th century. A case can now be made on archaeological grounds for at least partial Lucanization of the chora at that time.</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, 1983-88 143 Fig. 17 Fig. 18</page><page sequence="15">144 DAVID RIDGWAY Fig. 19 'In addition to basic information about age at death and sex of the deceased, there is full information on physical condition and disease. Thus a male aged 40-45, whose grave (Fig. 21) contained a tortoise shell lyre, a strigil and a cup by the Agathon Painter has been diagnosed as suffering from acromegaly, an enlargement of bone ends caused by the dysfunction of the pituitary gland. A number of cases of thalassemia, an indirect indicator of malaria, have also been identified, and there is strong evidence that a form of syphilis was widely diffused among the population. 'A full publication of the material from the Pantanello necropolis is nearing completion. Meanwhile, the survey of a transect through the heart of the territory of Metaponto between the Bradano and Basento, begun in 1981 (AR 1981-82, loc. cit.), was completed in I985. An area of 42 km.2 was completely covered and 536 sites were put on the map. The ceramics, which average just over 100 sherds per site and include a high percentage of black-glazed pottery, have permitted an accurate dating of the rural sites, which are predominantly isolated farms of the colonial period (6th through 3rd century). There are also a large number of small necropoleis, a further indication of the permanent nature of the rural settle- ment. 'Settlement began in the first half of the 6th century, though some rural sanctuaries, such as San Biagio and Pantanello, are slightly older. The large scale move into Fig. 20 the chora began in the second half of the 6th century, accelerating rapidly in the later decades. At first, farm sites were restricted to the river valley bottoms, but gradually the sandier soils of the marine terrace were occupied too. The population of the territory reached its first peak in the first half of the 5th century, as did burial in the Pantanello necropolis. It declined in the second half of the 5th century, and reached a low point in the first half of the 4th, when population was half what it had been at the peak. In the second half of the 4th century,</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SARDINIA AND SOUTH ITALY, 1983-88 145 Fig. 21 when the numbers are comparable to those of the early 5th, some sites (especially in the lower-lying areas) were abandoned; but many sites, abandoned during the pre- ceding century, were simply re-inhabited. There is a strong continuity through the 300-year life of the Greek chora. By the middle of the 3rd century, however, the territory was all but deserted; a minor revival took place in the middle of the 2nd century.' At Policoro, I am grateful to Professor G. Pianu for notes on the excavation conducted by the University of Perugia in 1985 at the sanctuary of Demeter (Atti XXV Taranto 1985 [1986], 472-74) and in 1986-88 in the vast sacred area to the south of the 'Tempio Arcaico', where a number of small buildings (naiskoi? thesauroi?), a stoa and a temenos were found, as was further epigraphic evidence for the cult of Dionysos-and similar indica- tions, too, that Aphrodite and apparently Asklepios were also venerated. CALABRIA. Dr Elena Lattanzi, Archaeological Superintendent of Calabria, has edited a detailed guide- book to II Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria (Reggio; Gangemi, 1987), to which she and her colleagues in the Superintendency have contributed substantial new accounts of the material from the Greek foundations (pp.3 2-145) and in the pre- and protohistoric, epigraphic, numismatic and underwater sections. Of these, the last- named provides a worthy home for the Museum's world-famous Greek bronzes, the Porticello 'philos- opher' and the Riace warriors (on which see Due Bronzi da Riace [BdA serie speciale 3, 1985; 2 vols.]: rev. J. Boardman, CR 36 [1986], 282-84). Another useful addi- tion to the literature on ancient Calabria is the first volume, edited by S. Settis, of a large Storia della Calabria (La Calabria antica, Reggio; Gangemi, I987), which contains important chapters (pp.65-303) by R. Peroni on protohistory, by P.G. Guzzo on the archaeology of the colonies and by G. De Sensi Sestito on the history, economy and society of Calabria in the Archaic and Classical periods. An important indigenous element is treated in depth in a collective volume edited by P. Poccetti, Per un'identita culturale dei Brettii (Naples; Ist. Univ. Orientale, 1988). The excavations at Broglio di Trebisacce (AR 1981- 82, 80), the associated exploration of the Sibaritide and latterly a variety of palaeobotanical investigations con- tinue to shed light on the nature and extent of the relationship between Bronze Age South Italy and the Aegean during the period that spans LH IIIA and IIIC. This singularly informative project has contributed much to all the Mycenaean conferences noted at the beginning of this report, where discussion has been greatly facilitated by the four handsome volumes in which R. Peroni and his colleagues at the University of Rome and elsewhere have published their considerable findings: Ricerche sulla protostoria della Sibaritide, i and 2 (Naples; Centre Berard, 1982); 3 and Nuove ricerche ... (Rome; Paleani, 1984). Rather than attempt to provide an abstract of their 945 far from repetitive pages, or even of those concerning the now vast assemblage of painted and grey wares, I refer readers to Professor Peroni's primo bilancio critico (Nuove ricerche cit. 317-28), which includes a characteristically incisive analysis of the social pattern reflected in the distinctions that are now being reliably established between imported pottery and local products like Fig. 22 (of LH IIIC type). A final volume on Broglio (R. Peroni, ed., Enotri e Micenei nella Sibaritide) is eagerly awaited, and so is further news of the excavations at nearby Torre Fig. 22</page><page sequence="17">146 DAVID RIDGWAY Fig. 23 Mordillo initiated in 1987 by F. Trucco for the Soprint- endenza Speciale, Rome. Dr Trucco reports evidence for indigenous occupation from the Middle Bronze Age onwards, and, as at Broglio, there is a range of Aegean and Aegean-type pottery that includes a high proportion of locally-made items. Dr Vagnetti kindly comments that this material is so far concentrated within the chronological limits of LH IIIB-C (Fig. 23); and that whereas the decorative repertoire at Broglio has a distinc- tively Cretan flavour, that attested at Torre Mordillo seems to indicate closer links with the Greek mainland. I am also obliged to Dr Vagnetti for details of two surface finds elsewhere in Calabria that must be appended to her most recent list of Italian sites with Mycenaean material (Traffici micenei cit. 7-1 I): a fragment of a stirrup jar from Francavilla Marittima (LH IIIB; L. Vagnetti, ASMG, 24-25 [I983-841, I58-60); and a fragmentary addition, from Capo Piccolo near Croton, to the relatively exiguous number of imported Mycenaean pieces on the South Italian mainland that can be securely identified as earlier than LH IIIA (LH I-II; L. Vagnetti &amp; R.E. Jones, Klearchos, 113-16 [1987], 37-44). Further investigations in 1983 at Le Murge di Strongoli by J. de La Geniere (University of Lille III) and C. Sabbione (Superintendency) revealed two circuit walls and an irregular stone structure that overlies part of the late 7th-early 6th century necropolis. By the end of the brief 1988 campaign, a continuous presence was attested from the end of the 8th century; the contents of the 5th-century graves (Fig. 24) are redolent of a sophistication that presumably derives from contact with nearby Croton, and supports the excavators' identifica- tion of their site with the Macalla of Philoctetes (ASMG, Fig. 24 24-25 [1983-841, 163-92: cf. Lycophron 9II-29; Ps.- Aristotle, Mir. ausc. 107). The XXIII Taranto conference on Croton in I983 coincided with the inauguration of what can only be called a Metaponto-style survey of the chora directed by Professor Carter, to whom my best thanks are due for the following account of progress to I988:- 'The area of the promontory south of the ancient city of Croton, a total of 270 km.2, was sampled in randomly chosen limits of I km.2; only the area of Capo Colonna was completely covered. At present 32 squares or c. 12% of the area has been covered, and 456 sites have been put on the map. They range in date from Neolithic to Medieval, with many occupied in two or more periods. A total of 228 sites had a Neolithic or Bronze Age component, 285 had a Greek occupation (600-250), 128 were occupied in the Roman period and 126 in the Medieval. The dense settlement in the prehistoric, late Roman and Medieval periods is in very sharp contrast to the situation in the chora of Metaponto (AR 1981-82, 74- 76), where the earlier and later periods are insignificant beside the massive Greek presence. 'In all periods, settlements line up along the ridges of the marine terraces which step up from the coastline. They are concentrated at the interface between overlying sands and gravels and the underlying clays, where numerous springs are still to be found. They are generally far more sparse in the flat central plateau. As in the chora of Metaponto, the presence of water is a fundamental determinant of the settlement pattern. 'Of the 200 + sites of the Greek period, 128 have been identified as isolated farms, similar on the basis of surface indicators to those in the chora of Metaponto. Another 36 are tombs, and the remaining sites are scatters of which the function could not be determined from the surface finds. The percentages of fine black-glazed pottery, tablewares, cooking and storage wares which charac- terized the farmhouses of Croton in the 6th and early 5th centuries are very similar to those of Metapontine farm- houses in all periods. A chora-wide shift, however, is clear in the 4th century from black-glazed towards the utilitarian coarse wares. It is accompanied by an enlarge- ment of the lots associated with the farmhouses (which were already considerably larger than the Metapontine lots), suggesting a shift towards agricultural production on a larger scale - made possible, perhaps, by the introduction or increased use of slave labour. 'Of particular interest, because of the pan-Hellenic sanctuary of Hera Lacinia, was the promontory of Capo Colonna. Although its natural beauty was celebrated by Theocritus, it was virtually deserted in the Greek period. The survey revealed only a handful of farmhouses, and a large Archaic Greek and later Roman site across a narrow point, I km. from the temple on the point itself. The flat 8 km.2 area of the promontory may be supposed to have been devoted to the goddess as Livy's description implies. In the Roman period, villas dominated the heights overlooking the vandalized (but still frequented) temple.' Professor Carter also reports that a programme of excavation was begun in I987 to test sites of the principal periods represented in the chora survey described above. The soundings served to verify the survey results, but did not provide any example of rural architecture that can be compared with that in the Metapontine chora.

On a smaller scale, progress has been efficiently synthesized by Professor Barra Bagnasco in a small book produced by the Calabrian Superintendency and the Turin Institute to accompany a Mostra documen- taria mounted in 1983: Locri Epizefiri: Ricerche archeolo- giche su un abitato della Magna Grecia; see too Quaderni CNR 112 (1985), 81 -216. She has also published a major study of the Protomi in terracotta (Turin; I1 Quadrante, 1986) from her site. Among the more important finds of recent campaigns are a dozen well-preserved sima plaques with lion-head spouts (Fig. 26); unusually for Magna Graecia, they are made of limestone. These interesting pieces had been re-used in a Hellenistic con- text; Professor Barra Bagnasco dates their manufacture to the second half of the 5th century on stylistic grounds, and attributes them to the contemporary reconstruction of the Marasa Ionic temple (BdA forthcoming). Fig. 25 credit side, a stone-built Neolithic structure at Capo Alfiere yielded a cache of fine polished stone axes (Fig. 25), as well as abundant quantities of obsidian blades and sophisticated Impressed Ware of the type named after the Sicilian site of Stentinello (and present elsewhere in Calabria: D. Aldridge, in A.J. Ammerman, The Acconia survey: Neolithic settlement and the obsidian trade, London [Inst. Archaeology OccP IO] I985, 39-55). And so, finally, to Locri, where the excavations directed by M. Barra Bagnasco (Institute of Archaeo- logy, University of Turin) have reached the stage of definitive publication: by the time these pages appear, Locri Epizefiri I (1977) should have been joined simultaneously by Locri Epizefiri II and III (Florence; SOURCES Fig. I 2 3 4-8 9 IO 11 12 13 I4 15 16 17-21, 25 22-23 24 26 OF ILLUSTRATIONS Source F.
