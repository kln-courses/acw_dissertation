<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Lerner (ed.) : Evidence and Inference. Glencoe, 111., The Free Press, 1959. 164 pages. $4.00. This volume of essays on scientific method and concept originated in the Hayden Colloquium of the Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology. Thoughtful consideration of the essays themselves is, unfortunately, seriously impeded by Lerner s shockingly unsci- entific introduction. Being clearly un- willing to permit the reader to weigh the evidence presented by the essays in a calm and objective fashion, Lerner obscures the issue by introducing a host of invalid inferences drawn only in small measure from the volume itself. The intention of the essays is laud- able. Six authors, representing as many areas of competence and interest, con- cern themselves with various problems of evidence and inference based on dis- cussions of their distinctive modes of scientific procedure. The essays are, in substantial measure, notable for clarity of presentation and the modesty of their claims. They neither attempt nor achieve new insights, being content rather to reveal the striking diversity of evidence-inference relationships in- herent in such fields of knowledge as medicine, law, history, and nuclear physics. Hart and McNaughton report, for example, that "the law has no single technique for connecting its conclusions with supporting data." "The general- izations of the law ... are prescriptive rather than descriptive." This is in contrast to Lazarsfeld's concern with studies which "are quantitative rather than qualitative." Nuclear physicist Martin Deutsch reports "no recipe, no rule of procedure which will permit the unimaginative experimenter to consider all . . . possibilities by applying system- atic logical analysis to all aspects of his apparatus." Indeed, he relies on "the symbolic anthropomorphic representa- tion of the basically inconceivable atom- ic processes." It is precisely this empirical demon- stration of the diverse character of sci- entific knowledge which Lerner is un- willing to accept. He betrays the unpre-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 185 tentious, scientific spirit of the essays by his attempt to transform this modest volume into a testament in behalf of what he terms, "with grand simplicity, Science." His quest for the Touchstone of Science leads him to differentiate "scientific from historico-clinical meth- odology"; he thus rejects as essentially nonscientific no less than two-thirds of the content of this volume, "With grand simplicity" and crusading fervor, he postulates a basically ideological understanding of Modern Science, which he associates with the rise of "a new middle class" and the destruction of the former, privileged social orders, along with their allies, "the powerful personnel of the magic and religion in- dustries." Linked with the enemies of democracy and progress are the dialec- ticians, whose knowledge is improperly castigated as "secret." Socrates, Talmud- ists, Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin - with the shade of Ludendorff bringing up the rear - are trotted out in an amal- gamated parade of horribles, to become a massive, if somewhat undifferentiated, Bogie Man designed to frighten back into the fold any "nervous intellectuals" whose faith in Modern Science may be wavering. His enemies dispatched via the reductio ad Hitler≈Øm, Lerner is then free to choose all good things for his position, all of the "more generous and human conceptions" which may have been "evolved by the modern #mind," "modern European" thinking, and so forth. Readers who survive Lerner s trial by fire and purple prose will discover in the essays themselves abundant evi- dence for refutation of his restrictive conception of a monolithic Science. No less clear is the implication that one who seeks scientific understanding in the spirit of ideological partisanship will blind himself to its vital function of liberating man's mind from parochial- ism and dogmatism. Lerners introduc- tion notwithstanding, the reader of this volume is well advised to draw his own inferences. Robert Horwitz Michigan State University</page></plain_text>
