In Egypt, Babylonia and in the pagan world in general, word and incantation were integral parts of the cult; act was accompanied by speech. The spell expressed the magical essence of cultic activity. In more developed form, pagan rituals might be accompanied by mythological allusions relating to events in the life of the gods. Speech thus articulated the magical-mythological sense of the rite.... P makes no reference to the spoken word in describing temple rites. All the various acts of the priest are performed in silence ... Not only have spells and psalms no place in the priestly cult, even prayer is absent.... Priestly speech is found only outside the temple or apart from the essential cultic act.... This silence is an intuitive expression of the priestly desire to fashion a non-pagan cult.... Though the detail of the priestly rites, magical in origin and essence, could not be done away with, the magical motivation made explicit in the accompa- nying utterances was eliminated. Therewith the Israelite cult became a domain of silence. The details of ritual lost their intrinsic meaning and became a vehicle expressive of human submission to the command of God. The silence of the temple cult served to heighten the awe of holiness.... The priestly cult in the temple of silence could not contain the abun- dance of popular religious sentiment. Around the silent sanctuary throbbed the joyous popular cult, all tumult and passion.... Prayer belonged almost exclusively to the popular religion; it is not men- tioned in P. Ordinarily, the individual prays for himself. When, on occasion, an intercessor appears, he is not a priest, but a righteous man or prophet.... The only prayer formulated in the Torah is the tithe-confession ... which is non-priestly.... 17</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Biblical Literature In harmony with this, biblical tradition ascribes the authorship of the psalms neither to priests nor even to prophets as such. The poet-king David and the heads of Levitical families . . .-singers and poets-are the chief psalmists of tradition. The Aaronide priests have no part in this creation. Psalmody is a creation of popular poets, and particularly of that body of pro- fessional singers who became part of the Levite class. It was not connected with priestly rites. There is no indication that psalms were a part of the sacri- ficial cult or any other priestly rite. Recitation of the psalms in the temple was a kind of extraneous, lay adjunct to the cult. The Priestly code makes no men- tion of it.1 The distinctions drawn by Kaufmann are discussed in the scholarly litera- ture. Nahum Sarna accepted his view in principle, attempting to explain the discontinuity between the psalmic literature and the priestly service in terms of the social gap between the elite priestly class and the circles of poets, who held a secondary status. Menahem Haran and Moshe Greenberg, even though they disagree in their evaluation of the position of prayer in relation to sacrifice, both accept the description of the priestly cult as a silent one. In his article on the law of the wayward wife, Michael Fishbane challenges Kaufmann's position, questioning his theory on the basis of those priestly texts which contain speech: that is, the confession recited over the head of the scapegoat (Lev 16:21) and the adjuration of the wayward wife (Num 5:19-22). He likewise questions Kaufmann's theory on the strength of evidence from the Second Temple period and from rabbinic literature relating to the song of the Levites and the prayer of the high priest on the Day of Atonement. Finally, Fishbane comments that Kaufmann obscured his own arguments by defining all of the words that accompanied ritual as "magic."2 In what follows, I wish to reexamine the biblical and postbiblical context of the issue of the "sanctuary of silence." Let me preface my discussion by stating that in my opinion the fundamental distinctions drawn by Kaufmann have a solid basis. However, the claim he has articulated pertains only to the inner circle of the priesthood. Beyond this circle, as Kaufmann himself has observed, there is no silence at all. Instead, we find there the songs of the Levites and the shouting of the people.3 Kaufmann wishes only to emphasize the contrast between the song 1 See Yehezkel Kaufmann, The Religion of Israel (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960) 303-5,309, 110. 2 Nahum N. Sara, "The Psalm Superscriptions and the Guilds," in Studies in Jewish Religion and Intellectual History Presented to Alexander Altmann on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birth- day (ed. S.

My own position regarding this question agrees with that of Kaufmann. Unlike Jacob Milgrom (Leviticus 1-16 [AB 3A; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1991] 18</page><page sequence="3">Knohl: Between Voice and Silence of the Levites and the prayer of the people in the outermost circle with the silence of the priests in the inner circle. As I shall attempt to prove below, not only does the reality of the Second Temple period not weaken Kaufmann's claims; on the contrary, it strengthens them. Nevertheless, Kaufmann's explana- tion of the silence of the priestly cult requires further examination. Fishbane's objection that it is difficult to define the entire verbal complex accompanying the Temple ritual as "magic" is justified. While the charms and oaths are clearly rooted in magic, this is not true of the prayers and hymns.4 If so, why are the lat- ter absent from the Temple of the Israelite priesthood? The Bible itself includes many prayers and hymns that give profound expression to Israelite monotheistic belief. The desire to separate the Israelite cult from paganism per se is an inade- quate explanation as to why the priests deleted these explicitly monotheistic texts from the holy service. Indeed, among all the cultic texts described in the Priestly stratum of the Pentateuch, it is precisely those two texts which are clos- est in external form to the pagan cult-namely, the sending away of the scape- goat and the giving of drink to the wayward wife-that are accompanied by verbal elements of confession and adjuration (Lev 16:21; Num 5:19-22)! Were things as Kaufmann claims, and the silence of the cult rooted in the wish to make 19, 60-61), I never claimed that prayer and hymn were not part of the activity in the Temple and its courtyards. My argument, like that of Kaufmann, refers exclusively to the silence of the priestly cul- tic act per se, as reflected in the laws of the Priestly Torah. Milgrom's objection (ibid., 19; Fishbane argues similarly) that this is an argument from silence requires a reply. It is true that the Priestly code contains no explicit statement barring speech during the time of offering sacrifices. However, the analogy to other ancient Near Eastern temples, by means of which Fishbane and Milgrom seek to refute the claim regarding the silence of the Israelite cult, is, if anything, a cogent proof in the opposite direction. As has been demonstrated by Fishbane himself, as well as by other scholars, the laws of the cult in the Priestly Torah are formulated in a manner remarkably similar to that of the priestly rules in the ancient Near East (see Michael Fishbane, "Biblical Colophons: Textual Criti- cism and Legal Analogies," CBQ 42 [1980] 438-49; Chaim Cohen, "Was the P Document Secret?" JANES 1/2 [1969] 3944). In the instructions addressed to the priests of ancient Near Eastern tem- ples, the rules regarding cultic activities include specific orders as to various recitations intended to accompany the cultic act: thus in the Egyptian temple (see the texts cited in ANET, 324), in the Mesopotamian temples (ANET, 331-42), and among the Hittites (ANET, 346-56). The evidence of the Ugaritic texts is more fragmentary, but note the two prayer texts, which, according to H. L. Ginsberg, were said during sacrificial acts (see H. L. Ginsberg, Kitve Ugarit [Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1936] 88-92). The fact that the corresponding instructions in the Priestly Torah, which are, as mentioned, similar in external form and in literary pattern to cultic rules in the ancient Near East, do not include any instructions concerning speech accompanying the cultic act cannot be viewed as mere chance. This is a silence that calls out for interpretation! Nor is the priestly blessing, invoked by Milgrom in his argument, any proof, as it was not performed accompanying the cultic act, but only after the completion of the sacrificial act (Lev 9:22, and thus also the opinion of the rabbis; see Maimonides, Commentary to the Mishnah [in Hebrew; ed. J. Kapah; Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1977) Qodasim: on m. Tamid, chap. 6, p. 282). 4 On the distinction between prayer and magic, see Greenberg, "Prayer," 915; idem, Biblical Prose Prayer (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983) 48. 19</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Biblical Literature a clear break from paganism, then it is precisely in those texts that we should have found absolute silence! In my book The Sanctuary of Silence, I analyzed the religious outlook of the school of the "Priestly Torah"-P. My study revealed that this school devel- oped a religious language that rejected nearly every aspect of personality or anthropomorphism in connection with God. The writings of this school contain no description of God, and the only action directly ascribed to God is that of speech and commanding. According to the viewpoint of this school, the rela- tion between God and Israel, and the cultic structure that expresses this rela- tionship, are completely separate from any anticipation of providence or divine recompense and are not rooted in a mutual covenantal system. The complex of cultic imperatives of the Priestly Torah does not contain even a single ceremony whose purpose is to infuse blessing and salvation or to directly ask for the fulfill- ment of any human request. Moreover, in the work of this school there is no connection of direct speech between God and Israel; only Moses himself hears God's word. Indeed, even the verbal connection with Moses is one-sided: God turns to Moses and speaks to him, but there is no speech of Moses to God!5 It seems to me that the holy silence of the priests becomes far clearer against the background of this religious outlook. In the absence of a relation- ship of providence or recompense between God and Israel, there is room nei- ther for petitional prayer nor for hymns of thanksgiving. By its very nature, the language of prayer and hymn is permeated with anthropomorphic language concerning God. Neither is it consistent with the spiritual tendency of the priestly teaching, which tends to reject anthropomorphic and anthropopathic imagery. The refusal to ascribe any kind of characteristics or actions to God makes any positive speech concerning God impossible. Hence, the sole alterna- tive open to one standing before the holy is absolute silence. Thus, unlike Kaufmann, I do not believe that the silence of the cult was brought about through rejection of magic or the like. On the contrary, the magi- cal outlook, which relates not to God as a persona but to impersonal forces act- ing within reality, is not that remote from the conception of the impersonal deity of the "Priestly Torah." For this reason, the "Priestly Torah" was able to present in the Temple the adjuration of the wayward wife in its original formula (Num 5:19, 20, 22), in which the holy water is represented as acting upon the woman without God's intervention.6 Prayer to a personal God, by contrast, which is 5 Israel Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995) 128-49. 6 Numbers 5:21, which breaks the original flow of the formula of adjuration, came from an additional editing. The redactors, who were suspicious of the quasi-magical dimension of the origi- nal formula of oath, inserted v. 21, which represents God as punishing the woman directly (see Sanctuary of Silence, 88). As mentioned, the second ceremony in which the Priestly Torah men- tions a verbal element was the confession recited by the priest over the head of the scapegoat (Lev 16:21). The verbal contents of this confession are not given by the Torah; however, it is interesting 20</page><page sequence="5">Knohl: Between Voice and Silence removed from magic but contains some elements of personification of God, is inconsistent with Priestly theology and, for this reason, has no place in the Temple. As we have said, silence reigns only within the priestly realm of the Temple. Surrounding it, in the sphere of the turbulent folk cult, one can hear the voice of prayer, melody, and hymn. As may be seen from the combination of the testi- mony of the Priestly Torah and that of the non-Priestly strata,7 the Temple com- plex was constructed of a series of circles of voice and silence distinct from one another. II In principle, this picture did not change even after the destruction of the Temple of Solomon and the building of the Second Temple. As Elias Bicker- man has noted, this is testified to by the Letter of Aristeas, composed during the period in which the Temple stood.8 The Letter of Aristeas states: "the min- istrations of the priests is in every way unsurpassed both for its physical endurance and for its order and silent service.... The most complete silence that the formula of confession by the high priest on the Day of Atonement, as documented in rab- binic literature, includes a definite element of adjuration by the "Name," which is close to the world of magic. See Gedaliah Alon, Jews, Judaism and the Classical World (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1977) 235-51; Saul Lieberman, Mehqartm bettorat Eres Yisra&amp;el (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1991) 88-93; idem, Tosepta' kepeshuta (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1967) 7.393. 7 This duality of circles of voice and silence may be seen in the book of Deuteronomy. As noted by Kaufmann (Religion of Israel, 303), the ceremony of bringing firstfruits described in this book is accompanied by a recitation by the one bringing the firstfruits to the priest, while the latter does not say anything but places the basket silently before the altar (Deut 26:1-10). One might also add to this the ceremony of breaking the neck of the heifer in Deut 21:1-9. The silent presence of the priests in this ceremony may be explained in light of the tradition of priestly silence. In the laws of the Holiness School (H), we find an attempt to break the priestly silence by means of the com- mand concerning the making of the silver trumpets (Num 10:1-10; on the connection of this passage to the Holiness School, see Sanctuary of Silence, 52-53). The Aaronide priests are here commanded to sound the horns on festive occasions and fixed festivals: "you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; they shall serve you for remembrance before your God" (Num 10:10). This commandment is characteristic of the general outlook of the Holiness School, which sought to combine elements of the priestly cult and of folk ritual, introduc- ing into the priestly rite of the Temple a dimension of anticipation of and petition for God's salvation (see Sanctuary of Silence, 195-98). The blowing of trumpets over the sacrifices became accepted as a fixed practice in the Temple; see 1 Chr 16:6; 2 Chr 29:27-28; Sir 50:22; m. Tamid 7:3, and my own remarks in "The Priestly Torah versus the Holiness School: Sabbath and the Festivals," HUCA 58 (1987) 105 n. 127. The text of the priestly blessing (Num 6:22-27) also derives, in my opinion, from the Holiness School (see Sanctuary of Silence, 89). In any case, as noted above, the priestly blessing took place after the completion of the sacrificial acts (see Lev 9:22). 8 Elias Bickerman, "The Civic Prayer for Jerusalem," HTR 55 (1962) 179. Bickerman empha- sizes the absence of prayer in the biblical sacrificial cult and the strict separation between the prayers recited in the Temple during the Second Temple period and the acts of sacrificial worship (pp. 177-80). In our remarks below, we shall expand Bickerman's distinctions. 21</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Biblical Literature reigns so that one might imagine that there was not a single person present" (92, 95).9 As we have said, a careful examination of rabbinic traditions concern- ing certain prayers recited in the Temple likewise indicates the care that was taken in principle to maintain the silence of the cultic act. Let us first examine a tradition recorded in Mishna Tamid concerning the ceremony conducted by the priests every morning in the chamber of hewn stone: They went along and put them [the limbs of the daily offering] on the lower half of the ramp, on the west side of it, and salted them; then they came down and betook themselves to the Chamber of Hewn Stone to recite the Shema'. The officer said to them, "Recite one benediction," so they recited a benedic- tion, and recited the Ten Commandments, the Shemac [Deut. 6:4-9], and Vehayah im shamoa [Deut. 11:13-21], and Vayyomer [Num. 15:37-41], and they pronounced three benedictions with the people: Emet va-yazib ("true and sure"), CAbodah (the Service), and the Priestly Blessing. (m. Tamid 4:3-5:1) I will not here discuss the verbal contents of this ceremony: the signifi- cance of reading the Ten Commandments prior to the Sema', the nature of the blessings mentioned there, etc. I wish to take note specifically of the external aspects of this occasion: its physical and substantive position in relation to the fixed daily service. In chap. 4 of Mishna Tamid, the process of slaughtering the regular sacrifice and the preparation of its organs for being offered upon the altar are described in detail. Once the preparations had been completed and it was possible to begin the act of offering per se, the cultic act is interrupted at its climax: the organs are not carried up to the altar but are left on the ramp. But not only is the continuity of action broken; there is also a break in terms of place. The priests abandon the altar, which stands in the center of the sanctified realm, and turn to the Chamber of Hewn Stone, located on the periphery of the holy area.10 This break calls for interpretation. Prima facie, the act of reading by the priests, whose purpose is evidently the acceptance of the kingdom of heaven and the renewal of the Sinai covenant, should have been performed near the site of the sacrifice. Such proximity would have connected the cultic act of offering the daily sacrifice with the verbal and ideational contents of renewal of the covenant. The reason for creating a break of this sort in the process of offer- ing the tdmid would seem to lie in the tension between the wish to conduct a ceremony of verbal reading, on the one hand, and the ancient priestly heritage of the "sanctuary of silence," on the other. The peculiar situation described in the Mishna emerges from this tension. As the recitation and blessings cannot be conducted adjacent to the site of the offering, the priests must leave the altar and 9 See APOT 2.103-4. 10 On the location of the Chamber of Hewn Stone at the edge of the sanctified precincts, see b. Yoma 25a. 22</page><page sequence="7">Knohl: Between Voice and Silence the sacrifice and go to the Chamber of Hewn Stone at the edge of the Temple precincts. Similarly, the prayers conducted on the Temple Mount on fast days with the participation of the priests take place at the periphery of the sanctified area-at the eastern gates (m. Ta'an. 2:5; t. Ta'an. 1.12). The only prayer uttered inside the Temple was that of the high priest on the Day of Atonement. But even this prayer is not conducted in the holiest place of all-the holy of holies-nor is it recited as accompaniment to the cultic act of offering up the incense or sprinkling the blood. The priest recites his prayer only after he has completed the sanctified ritual and left the holy of holies. Here, too, the prayer is sepa- rated from the cultic act.11 One could make the general statement that, at the end of the Second Temple period, prayer penetrated into the periphery of the priestly realm; however, at the heart of the system the silence of the holy place, which is the heritage of the "Priestly Torah," is preserved. As in the First Temple, so too in the Second Temple the verbal cult flour- ished in that sphere outside the priestly realm.12 The arrangements for levitical song took shape during this period, the Levites bursting forth in song at the conclusion of the fixed daily sacrifice (m. Tamid 7:3-4).13 The Temple court- yards also served as a worship site for the masses of the house of Israel who came to pour forth their petition in the holy place. As has been noted by schol- ars, the people were accustomed to reciting their own prayers at the time of offering the daily sacrifice and the burning of the incense.14 The Temple may therefore be described as a series of concentric circles. The inner circle is that of the priests, in which the sacred service is conducted in absolute silence; the outer circle is that of the folk prayers of the people; while in the middle is the circle of the song of the Levites. Despite the tension among them, these circles existed alongside one another and complemented one another. It is worth not- ing the distinction between the circle of the priestly cult (and similar to it that of the song of the Levites), which is entirely fixed and obligatory, and that of prayer, which was more on the order of a goodly custom and an act of piety, but did not carry the stamp of fixity and was not understood as an obligation imposed on every person in Israel.15 11 See Bickerman, "Civic Prayer," 179. 12 An exception to this is the testimony of the prophet Joel concerning the prayer of the priests that occurred between the vestibule and the altar (Joel 1:13-14; 2:17). On the reasons for fixing the time of Joel in the Second Temple period, see G. W. Ahlstroim, Joel and the Temple Cult ofJerusalem (Leiden: Brill, 1971). 13 On the antiquity of this custom, see Sara, "Psalm Superscriptions," 291-92. 14 Gedaliah Alon, Mehqarim bett6led6t Yisrd'el (2 vols.; Tel-Aviv: Hakibbutz hameuhad, 1957) 1.284-85; Sarna, "Psalm Superscriptions," 292-93; Moshe Weinfeld, " 7rn," TWAT 4.997-1000; Ezra Fleischer, "On the Beginnings of Obligatory Jewish Prayer" (in Hebrew), Tarbiz 59(1990) 416-17. 15 Fleischer, "Beginnings," 402ff. 23</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Biblical Literature III This combination of contrasting and complementary circles of silence and sound could exist only in the Temple, in whose center was conducted the silent service of the sacrifices, surrounded by the realm of hymn and prayer. Separa- tion from the Temple and from the sacrificial service upset the balance between voice and silence, and required a new type of confrontation with the various ritual components. At the end of the Second Temple period, the community of Qumran cut itself off from the Jerusalem Temple, whose cult was perceived by them to be unclean and degenerate. The Qumran congregation developed fixed prayer arrangements to substitute for the sacrificial service.16 Among the complex of prayers from Qumran, a special place is occupied by the work known as the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice. The title of this work is taken from the headings of its various songs: "Song of the Sacrifice for the Seventh Sabbath," "Song of the Sacrifice of the Eighth Sabbath," and so on. These songs depict the super- nal Temple, in which the angels serve as priests. The angels do not offer sacri- fices, but bless and praise God. Interestingly, the word "silence" appears there a number of times in relation to the songs of the angels. I shall cite here two outstanding examples: rcn: ]1n:m :n: nnni -Tpl ("[there is] a still sound of blessing in the tumult of their movements"); ::' [n]nnt o'1U'pu nrli nl: [Ip D'15R nnn 5i:' Dr,l5 ("the sound of glad rejoicing falls silent, and [there is] a stillness of divine blessing in all the camps of the godlike beings").17 This phe- nomenon calls for explanation. The song of the angels is mentioned in the Bible and in postbiblical literature,18 but nowhere do we find it performed in silence and stillness. On the contrary, in the Bible we find the sons of God shouting for joy (Job 38:7; cf. Isa 6:3). Carol Newsom believes that this silence is influenced by 1 Kgs 19:12, which describes the revelation of God to Elijah at Horeb: "and after the fire a small still voice."19 It is true that in the Aramaic translation of this verse we find "a voice of those who praise quietly," but in its literal sense this verse is not concerned with angels, and it is difficult to see it as the source for the silent song of the angels in the Qumranic scroll. Dale H. Allison has devoted a separate paper to this question.20 He points 16 Shemaryahu Talmon, The World of Qumran from Within (Jerusalem: Magnes; Leiden: Brill, 1989) 200-243. They may have been anticipated on this point by the members of the circle of the book ofJubilees. See n. 31 below. 17 Carol Newsom, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice: A Critical Edition (HSS 27; Atlanta: Schol- ars Press, 1985) 303, 306. Cf. the additional examples brought by D. N. Allison, "The Silence of Angels: Reflections of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice," RevQ 13 (1988) 193. 18 See S. N. Kramer and M. Weinfeld, "The Summarite Literature and the Book of Psalms" (in Hebrew), Bet Miqra' 19 (1974) 8-24, 136-60. 19 Newsom, Songs, 313. 20 Allison, "Silence of Angels." 24</page><page sequence="9">Knohl: Between Voice and Silence out that the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice never actually quote the contents of the song of the angels, and he concludes from this that the angels were entirely silent. He explains this as reflecting the recognition by the members of the Qumran sect of the poverty of human language to incorporate and exhaust the praise of God.21 In his view, this explains the special use of the word "silence" in connection with the song of the angels. However, this explanation seems prob- lematic to me, for two reasons: linguistic and substantive. First, the meaning of the word dcmdmwr is not absolute silence but a very quiet voice: ilpl r nrn7 1 p = "a still small voice." We must therefore conclude that the angels are not silent but sing in a quiet voice. The other difficulty is in Allison's assumption that the members of the Qumran sect thought it impossible to describe the praise of God in human language. The praises of God are in fact sung and celebrated in many Qumran hymns and songs of thanksgiving. Why, then, did they here specifically choose silence?22 It seems to me that the silent song of the angels may be understood against the background of the dominant image in this scroll: the supernal Temple, in which the angels are clothed in priestly garb.23 During the hundreds of years that had passed since the time of Solomon's Temple, the practice of silence in the Temple had become well established, until it became a necessary dimension of the priestly cult. Therefore, when one compared the angels to priests serving in the holy place, the obligation of silence became incumbent upon them as it was in the sanctuary of silence. On the other hand, the ancient motif of the singing of the angels is a central element in this scroll. We can likewise assume that the members of the Qumran sect saw themselves as participating with the angels in this song.24 The compromise between the conflicting elements of the voice of song of the angels and the silence of the cult of the Priestly Temple appears in the description of the angels, who bless their Creator with a still and silent voice.25 21 Ibid., 194-95. 22 Praise and thanksgiving to God are of the essence of Qumran prayer. On the place of peti- tionary prayer in the Qumran writings, see the appendix at the end of this article. 23 Newsom, Songs, 39-58. 24 See the discussion of the motif of the joint song of angels and human beings in Moshe Weinfeld, "The Heavenly Praise in Union," Mekor Hayyim: Festschrift G. Molin (Graz, 1983) 429-37. 25 It may be that the motif of the silent song of the angels also found its way into other works via the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, remnants of which have also been found outside of Qumran (see C. Newsom and Y. Yadin, "The Masada Fragment of the Song of the Sabbath Sacrifice," IEJ 34 [1984] 77-88). On this motif in ancient Jewish literature, see the sources cited by Lawrence H. Schiffman, "Merkava Speculation at Qumran," in Mystics, Philosophers and Politicians: Essays in Jewish Intellectual History in Honor of Alexander Altmann (ed. J. Reinharz and D. Swetschinski; Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1982) 37; see also Allison, "Silence of Angels," 195-96. A fur- ther source is the liturgical poem Aqddimtt recited on the festival of Sabic't. This piyyut, written in Aramaic, states that the angels "recite 'Blessed be his honor' in every language of whisper" (Kitrnb 1]2? LO nCp' 1("n'' 1'-ai). 25</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Biblical Literature The liturgical purpose of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is not clarified in the work itself, but the explanation of those scholars who claim that the people of Qumran saw the recitation of the song as a substitute for the sabbath burnt offering seems likely to me.26 It would seem that the song was recited in silence27 in imitation of the song of the angels who serve in the supernal Temple. IV Following the destruction of the Second Temple, the Jewish people as a whole needed to find a substitute for the institutionalized worship in the Temple. As has recently been emphasized by Ezra Fleischer, it was during this period that the idea of fixed prayer as a religious obligation incumbent upon every Jewish individual came to the fore.28 In this new form, prayer was patterned after sac- rificial worship: "Prayers were instituted corresponding to the daily sacrifices" (b. Ber 27b). From the moment that prayer came to be understood as a ritual obligation like sacrificial service, it took on certain fixed features similar to those of sacrifices-whether of a fixed text or of fixity in time. At the time that the fixed arrangements for prayer were established, it was decided that the cen- tral prayer-known as CAmidd or Semnneh CEsreh-would be recited by the community in a whisper. In one baraita in which the sages discuss the laws of prayer, they attempt to find precedent in the behavior of biblical personalities: "Shall it be that he makes his voice heard in prayer? It is expounded regarding Hannah: 'Hannah spoke in her heart' [1 Sam 1:13]."29 These remarks are rather surprising: from what may 26 This is the view of A. S. van der Woude ("Fragmente einen Rolle der Leiden fur das Sab- batopfer aus Hohle xi von Qumran," in Von Kanaan bis Kerala [ed. W. C. Delman et al.; AOAT 211; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1982] 332) and J. Maier ("Shire Olat hash-Shabbat: Some Observations on Their Calendric Implications and on their Style," in Proceedings of the Madrid Qumran Congress [ed. J. Trebolle Barrera and L. Vegas Montaner; Leiden: Brill, 1992] 553, 560). Carol Newsom opposes this conjecture ("He Has Established for Himself Priests," in Archaeology and History in the Dead Sea Scrolls [ed. L. H. Schiffman; JSOT/ASPOR Monograph Series 2; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1990] 110). In her opinion, the literary structure of the work, culminating in the seventh sabbath, proves that we have here a liturgical work intended only for the first quarter of the year. For this reason, Newsom argues, it is impossible to see the song as a substitute for the sabbath sacrifice, for if it were we would have needed to have had a work encompassing all the sabbaths of the year. However, as has been demonstrated by Maier ("Shire Olat," 542-43), there is no inherent indication in the language of the work that requires us to see the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as intended for the first thirteen sabbaths of the year alone. As is known, in the calendar of the book of Jubilees and of Qumran the year is divided into four periods, each one of which contains thirteen weeks (Jub. 6:23, 29). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the recitation of the song started anew in each period, while in each period the seventh sabbath was the height of the periodic cycle; see the reconstruction by Maier, "Shire Olat." 27 So Allison, "Silence of Angels," 194. 28 See Fleischer, "Beginnings." 29 The version is taken from t. Ber. 3.5 (ed. Lieberman); a similar wording appears in the par- allels in both Talmuds (y. Ber. 4.1 [7a]; b. Ber. 31a). 26</page><page sequence="11">Knohl: Between Voice and Silence be inferred from the biblical text, it would seem that prayer recited aloud was the accepted practice during the biblical period,30 whereas Hannah's practice was the exception, as indicated by Eli's suspicions: "therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman" (1 Sam 1:13). Why then did the sages see fit to decree that the 'Amcdd prayer be recited in silence, based on the singular case of Hannah, as opposed to the usual practice of prayer recited aloud, as suggested by numerous biblical passages and the literature of the Second Temple period?31 Another explanation for the practice of silent prayer appears in the rab- binic tradition: Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai: Why was it insti- tuted that the Prayer be recited silently? So as not to put transgressors to shame, for behold, Scripture made no distinction between the place of the sin-offering and that of the burnt-offering. (b. Sota 32b) But this explanation is also difficult: it may be a suitable explanation as to why confession is recited silently, but what reason was there to draw an inference from confession of sins to prayer?32 Hence, it would seem that the origins of the practice of silent prayer were already unclear during the late tannaitic period. The sages attempted to find a satisfactory explanation for this, but were unsuc- cessful in doing so.33 30 See Greenberg, "Prayer," 908, 912. 31 This difficulty was already raised by the twelfth-century Karaite Yehuda Hadasi, who, in his book Eskol hakkoper, objects to the practice of silent prayer fixed by the rabbis. He states there: "Eli the priest insulted and chastised Hannah for the manner of her prayer. He greatly rebuked her because she altered the custom of the prophets.... People saw this and wrought destruction upon Your prayer, based upon the allusion, 'and her voice was not heard' [1 Sam 1:13], and did not look upon the thousands upon thousands of allusions and verses which imply that the prophets and chiefs cried out [in prayer]" (Eskol hakkoper [Gozalow, 1836] 10d). See, e.g., Jdt 6:18-21; 7:19; 9:1; 1 Macc 3:50; 5:33; etc. 32 See Louis Ginzberg, Perusim wehiddtusm beyyerusalmi (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1971) 3.20. The positive attitude of Philo toward silent prayer must be understood as a result of the influence of the Platonic school; see P. W. van der Horst, "Silent Prayer in Antiquity," Numen 41 (1994) 13-14. 33 The Tosefta (t. Ros Has. 2.18; ed. Lieberman, 321) tells of a conflict between Rabban Gamaliel and the sages regarding the relationship between the prayer recited by the Leader (Saliah .Sbbtir) and the silent prayer by the public which precedes it. During the course of this confronta- tion, Rabban Gamaliel asks the sages, "If so, why does each one pray for himself?" to which they reply, "Because the Leader is preparing himself." The response of the sages to Rabban Gamaliel may imply another reason for silent prayer: the public worships quietly so that the leader may pre- pare himself for the public prayer recited aloud. But this is inadequate to explain why the prayer should be recited silently by an individual worshiping in the home. Another attempt to explain the silent prayer is the emphasis on the closeness to God and the confidence in God expressed by silent prayer: "One who makes his voice heard in his prayer is like those of little faith. One who raises his voice in prayer is like the false prophets" (baraita cited in b. Ber. 24b). Similarly, the saying of R. Pinhas in the name of R. Judah bar Simon: "[The object of] idolatry seems near, but it is none but far off... while the Holy One blessed be He seems remote, but there is none closer than Him.... 27</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Biblical Literature It seems to me that we may be able to clarify the practice of silent prayer on the basis of the matters that have been raised. As we said, prayer is now under- stood as a ritual act analogous to the Temple cult: "service of the heart."34 It would appear that the instituting of the halakah so as to require silent prayer was the result of a combination of the Priestly tradition of the silent sanctuary with the heritage of the circle of folk prayer.35 If prayer is analogous to the sacrificial ser- vice, then it must be performed in silence, just as the sacrifices were offered in silence within the Temple. On the other hand, prayer has no significance without its verbal contents, its very essence being the recitation of things before God. As in the case of the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, here too the compromise of reciting things in an undertone seemed called for. We therefore find that the con- gregation of worshipers standing36 in silent prayer is like the Priestly watch serv- ing in the holy place, while the synagogue is a kind of reflection of the silent sanctuary-a reflection that is passed down from generation to generation.37 A person enters the synagogue, stands behind the pillar and prays silently, and the Holy One blessed be He listens to his prayer" (y. Ber. 9.1 [13a]; cf. Yalquit Sim'on, Wiethanan, 825). How- ever, despite the ideational depth of these explanations (cf. Seder 'Eliyydhut Rabba, chap. 28, ed. Ish-Shalom [Jerusalem: Wahrmann, 1969] 140), it is difficult to see them as providing sufficient justification for abandoning the hitherto widespread practice of prayer aloud, which was common during the biblical and Second Temple period, and to substitute for it silent prayer. 34 See Sipre Debdrim, sect. 41 (ed. Finkelstein; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1969) 88 and parallels. 35 In this sense, the Pharisees and the rabbis after them continued the tendency of the Holi- ness School to incorporate folk elements within the Temple cult (see n. 6 above). On the overall relationship of the Pharisees to the Holiness School, see Knohl, "The Priestly Torah versus the Holiness School," 104-6, as well as idem, "Post-Biblical Sectarianism and Priestly Schools of the Pentateuch: The Issue of Popular Participation in the Temple Cult of Festivals," in Proceedings of the Madrid Qumran Congress (Leiden: Brill, 1992) 601-10. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the folk elements in the understanding of the Pharisees and the sages who followed them, one also finds various dicta among them emphasizing the religious problematic in the language of prayer. Particu- larly significant is the discussion in the Jerusalem Talmud (y. Ber. 9.1 [12d]; cf. the parallel discus- sion in b. Meg. 18a). The most extreme articulation of this position is the homily of Rabbi Jacob of Kefar Naboria cited in these sources (cf. Eccl. Rab. 5:1): "'To you silence is praise' [Ps 65:2]-the best of all is silence." This saying in effect rejects the possibility of verbal prayer, preferring silence in its stead. This is essentially the position of the Priestly Torah, as described above. It is interesting that the author of this saying was one who was suspected of heresy and taught halakot opposed to the halakic tradition of the rabbis but closer to the sectarian halakah (see A. Irsai, "Ya'akov of Kefar Niburaia-A Sage Turned Apostate" [in Hebrew], Mehqere YerZualayim bemmahsebet Yisrda'el 2 [1983] 153-68). It is also worthy of note that Ps 65:2, upon which R. Jacob based his homily, was invoked by Maimonides (Guide of the Perplexed 1.59), who also presents a critical position in rela- tion to the language of prayer. 36 The practice of reciting the silent prayer-'Amidd or gemoneh cEsreh-in a standing pos- ture also evidently reflects a certain connection to the tradition of the Temple service, which is per- formed entirely standing. See U. Ehrlich, "Modes of Prayer and Their Significance in the Time of the Mishna and Talmud" (in Hebrew) (doctoral diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1993) 18-23. 37 Over the course of generations, there became noticeable in certain circles a withdrawal</page><page sequence="13">Knohl: Between Voice and Silence Appendix Petitionary Prayer in the Qumran Writings The doctrine of predestination, which was dominant in the Qumran sect, does not allow for petitional prayer in the usual sense of the word. At most, the person who is chosen by God may ask God to deepen and complete the kind- ness which God has freely given. Thus, in the petition in the Manual of Disci- pline the author asks God to fulfill that which God had destined and decreed for God's chosen one: tt1r 51: p~'1 ' pn :i -: =n 5 nr*r nmn ' Int m '11:n Ah r.'-Dnu^D 0', -I.U rc') = nr nn^ D7 nmn: nmrn In k:D ronwn 1 C 7Dpm n: mn nt ': 'nl '1' 'TT nn ("Blessed art Thou, my God, who openest the heart of Thy servant to knowledge.

For without Thee no way is perfect, and without Thy will nothing is done"; 1QS 11:15-17).8 Similarly, the author of the Thanksgiving Scroll asks: = l"[orn 'Slb i n]nnr -r m-T: -i' 3 nrntlrw[ rnmD [U11] 1'-pOn 511)= I1p'n =rt l nb1 -71np mrn: r"rKs [:u]5 [19[]n] ['1]~' 'srrn [b:n31 p M: on] "nin ("Therefore I implore Thee, by the spirit which Thou hast given [me] to perfect Thy [favours] to Thy servant [for ever], purifying me by Thy Holy Spirit, and drawing me near to Thee by Thy grace according to the abundance of Thy mercies"; 1QH 16:12-13).39 Petitions and requests of this type would seem to relate to the idea stated in the hymn frag- ments: ;Ip L,t 'n 'Tnnn plnnnbi bL5nn9 ni'smnl minl ("Thanks and prayer, to pray and beseech constantly from the end to the end"; 4Q427 frg. 3, line 2).40 It is remarkable that, in the lengthy prayer recited by the chief priest on the eve of war given in the War Scroll (1QM 10:1-14:1), we find only one questionable line of petition (1QM 10:17).41 The invocation 'SN t M nmr' 1nn01 ("Rise up, rise from the renewed establishment of silent prayer and a return to the biblical model of reciting prayer aloud. This is already manifested in the practice of a number of Palestinian amoraim, as described in the Jerusalem Talmud (y. Ber. 4.1 [7a]; cf. the discussion in Ginzberg, Perustm wehiddufsm, 8-22), and became established and strengthened during the Geonic period. In the thesaurus of halakic differences between the Palestinians and the Babylonians, we read "[Among] the men of the East [i.e., Babylonians], a person recites the eighteen benedictions silently, while the people of Palestine recite it aloud, in order to make the people accustomed" (O$ar Hillip Minhdigim [ed.

Regular petitionary prayers do appear in some works found in Qumran, but these are evidently not explicitly sectarian works. Thus, for example, peti- tions appear in two of the pseudepigraphical hymns at the end of the Psalms Scroll.42 But, as has already been noted by Shemaryahu Talmon, these hymns are not Qumranic compositions.43 We likewise find words of petition in the hymns in 4Q380 and 4Q381, but these lack the explicit characteristics of Qum- ranic ideas, language, and orthography.44 We do find prayer that is explicitly petitional in the text known as Divrei ha-me'orot (4Q504-506); however, this text may be pre-Qumranic.45 In any event, the existence of Divrei ha-me'orot in three manuscripts, evi- dently copied in Qumran, suggests that it was used by the members of the sect in their prayers. That is, the religious norms here deviated from the strict and rigid theological principles. One should add, as noted by Esther Chazon, that the perception of Divrei ha-me'orot as a pre-Qumranic document implies that, already prior to the establishment of the Qumran community, there existed a group in Judaism that had fixed prayer arrangements.46 Isuggest the identifica- tion of this group with the circle in which the book ofJubilees was written. The members of this group, who advocated the use of a solar calendar, were doubt- less forced to withdraw from the service of the Temple in Jerusalem, which was conducted according to the lunar calendar. It therefore seems likely that the members of the Jubilees circle were the first in the history of Judaism to estab- lish fixed prayer services as a substitute for the sacrificial cult. The closeness between Jubilees and Divrei ha-me'orot is to be seen in the similar use of sev- eral theological motifs, such as the remembrance of the covenant and the viola- tion of the covenant.47 42 See J.
