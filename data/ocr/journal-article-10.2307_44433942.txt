ABSTRACTS</page><page sequence="2">650001-650007 650001 (948C) British Automo- tive Wind Tunnel Installation and Its Application. R. A. C. Fos- berry, R.G.S. White, and G.W. Carr, Motor Industry Research Association. This paper describes a full-scale wind tunnel which incorporates a 250 hp roller dynamometer, and a wind tun- nel for quarter-scale models. Tests show good correlation between aero- dynamic drag in the full-scale tunnel and the road, and between the roller dynamometer and the road, but cor- relation has not yet been established for other coefficients, or between model and full-scale tunnels. Results from the full-scale tunnel show that drag coefficients are tending to rise and the need for careful design is un- derlined. Results from model tests indicate that drag coefficients can be markedly reduced without sacrificing styling. Discussion: F. N.

Toti, Alfa Romeo S.p.A. The equa- tion for lateral motion of a car, accord- ing to the "two degrees of freedom" mathematical model, are developed, taking into account the contribution of the aerodynamic forces applied to the car moving in stationary air. Modifications introduced by aerody- namic effects on stability and steering control are derived and discussed, also in a first-order approximation. In addition, successively numerical examples are utilized to illustrate the conclusions of the study described. 650003 (949A) Theoretical Per- formance of Stirling-Cycle En- gines. G. Walker, Illinois Institute of Technology, Research Institute; and M. Khan, West Pakistan Univer- sity of Engrg. and Technology. This paper is supplementary to an earlier presentation of a generalized theoret- ical analysis of the Stirling engine cycle developed by Finkelstein. The theory is complex and the final equa- tions do not have closed solutions. Only one numerical result was given with the original presentation of the theory. Now, with the aid of a digi- tal computer a study has been made of the effect of the four principal de- sign parameters on the performance of an engine assumed to be operating with adiabatic processes of compres- sion and expansion. Typical values of heat exchanger thermal loading, net engine output, and thermal effi- ciency are presented for a defined reference engine configuration, show- ing the effect of variation in the tem- perature ratio, phase angle, swept volume ratio, and dead volume ratio. 650004 (949E) Philips Stirling Engine Activities. R. J. Mei jer, Philips Research Laboratories. In- tensive investigation of the theory of the Stirling engine system and of problems such as crank systems and gas and oil sealing have made possible the prediction of properties of a given design within a few percent. This paper describes a test system in which properties of engine with high power per cylinder can be measured ele- gantly and cheaply. The large num- ber of parameters determined over a large range now permit optimization programs to be run on a computer. Construction details are given and reversibility of the system is demon- strated. Discussion: M.J. Armstrong, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Labs. ; author's closure. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650005 (949F) Simulation of a Regenerative Reciprocating Ma- chine on an Analog Computer. T. Finkelstein, Rocketdyne Division, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The complicated energy conversion proc- esses in a Stirling cycle machine are simulated on an electronic analog computer. This gives the cyclic var- iation of all the time variables (pres- sure, temperature, torque, and so on) , and the integrated energy quantities (heat exchange, work, losses, and so on) and, hence, yields a complete heat balance. Operating conditions are defined by specified parameters, and changes can be made very easily for a wide range of solutions. One sam- ple solution is included, as well as graphs and heat-flow diagrams, show- ing the effect of changes in the regen- erator efficiency when all other factors are kept constant. This has led to a new understanding of the regenera- tive process. 650006 (951C) Study of the In- terrelationships Between Oils, Filters, and Engines in Passen- ger-Car Service. W. Hart, E. H. De Long, and J. L. Teeter, Kendall Refining Co. Full-scale engine test programs were conducted both in the laboratory and the field to assess the relative importance of the various fac- tors affecting filter life performance in passenger-car service. Both com- mercially available and specially pre- pared filters were used in the two test programs. The results from both in- vestigations confirmed that oil dis- persant level drain interval, engine design, and filter media all signifi- cantly affect filter life. It was fur- ther illustrated that individual effects can be magnified or diminished de- pending upon the combination of these factors. 650007 (952B) Diesel Design for Turbo Charging. S. G. Timoney, Dublin University. A novel design for a two-stroke-cycle diesel engine for traction purposes, having a me- chanically driven scavenge blower in series with an exhaust gas turbo- charger, is proposed. By driving the scavenge blower from the crankshaft, through a variable-speed drive, the quantity of charge air supplied to the engine can be varied independently of engine speed. Very high torque at 63</page><page sequence="3">650008-650014 low engine speed is thus possible, and an ideal traction torque characteristic results. To eliminate the problems associated with high peak cycle gas pressure under these conditions, a simple variable compression ratio mechanism is incorporated. Discussion: John M. Clark, Jr., South- west Research Institute. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650008 (954A) Use of the Two- Cycle Engine as a Power Unit for a Passenger Car. R. Mellde, J. Eklund, and K. Knutsson, Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget. The 2-stroke- cycle engine has a high output in re- lation to weight and displacement. Some special experiences from the power and reliability points of view are described especially with regard to driving at low-temperature condi- tions. The significance of suitably chosen inlet, exhaust and ignition sys- tems is treated, together with the test program undertaken to improve the reliability and life of the engine with regard to long, hard driving as well as stop-and-go driving in cold weather.

Wagner, Research &amp; Development Division, Standard Oil Co. In many locales fuel volatility is not based upon the accepted CRC test procedure. A field test of 153 cars shows that a part- throttle vapor lock procedure is an acceptable method of setting gasoline volatility specifications. Supporting evidence indicates that commercial vehicles are no more limiting than passenger cars in hot fuel handling problems. 650010 (958A) Constant Velocity Universal Ball Joints - Their Ap- plication in Wheel Drives. F. F. Miller, Spicer Division, Dana Corp. With front wheel drive automobiles becoming increasingly popular in Europe, engineers in the United States are eyeing the advantages claimed by the European car builders. This pa- per describes and compares the two different constant-velocity ball joints being manufactured in the United States. It illustrates what is avail- able in high angle steering joints, what is available in low angle telescop- ping joints, and illustrates how con- stant-velocity ball joints function. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650011 (959A) Present Status and Research in Mechanical Parts Made by Powder Metal- lurgy in France. M. A. Eudier, Consultant. This paper gives a few statistical values on the powder met- allurgy field in France. Differences with the United States in methods and results are outlined. Indications of future expansion of the industry are given, along with a few results of the researches made to create this expan- sion. Plants will soon be built to deliver sintered steel parts having comparatively high mechanical prop- erties which are a function of the density and, hence, of the production method. On laboratory testing, the hot coining seems to be the most promising way to fill the gap between sintered and machined parts. 650012 (960A) Flexible-Hub- Type Helicopter Rotor. R. Dor- and, Société Giravions Dorand. This paper discusses an improved control system for a helicopter or VTOL air- craft equipped with a rigid lift rotor integral with a flexible hub. The proposed method consists in suitably arranging the knuckle joints on the ends of the blade pitch control levers to create a complementary cy- clic deflection effect which is depend- dent upon the rotor's attitude and is superimposed upon the pilot's con- trol. The reduced dynamic instability of the helicopter with the control column locked, and the calculated improve- ment in the rotor's response to the control column facilitates piloting. The control of such a helicopter compares with driving an automobile equipped with servo-assisted controls. 650013 (960C) Determination of Breguet 941 STOL Aircraft Transition Velocities with Vari- ous Flap Deflections. H. D. Fow- ler, Aero Consultant. This paper presents an analytical method that was applied to the Breguet 941 STOL aircraft, reported in the Supplement of NASA TN D-2231. Flight data in this report include the propeller characteristics, which are never avail- able in wind tunnel or even in flight test research. The method solves the perplexing problem of calculating transitional velocities, of climb, take-off, and land- ing distances with highly deflected flaps. The method is interesting from the standpoint of integrating the high static thrust of 18,000 lb produced by four propellers into a 37,000 lb aircraft. It may be used with confidence when applied to an entirely new form of deflected slip- stream design. 650014 (960D) Control of Tur- boshaft Engines in Helicopters. O. L. L. Fitzwilliams, Westland Air- craft Ltd. Written from the point of view of the helicopter constructor, this paper attempts a comprehensive review of the experience accumulated by airframe, engine, and control sys- tems designers in the United King- dom in the course of developing a wide variety of first generation tur- bine engine helicopters. Some ex- perimental results are examined to illustrate and define the requirements for future engine control systems, and to show that the handling char- acteristics of free power turbine en- gines can be improved to equal the best characteristics previously experi- enced with fixed shaft turbines. 64</page><page sequence="4">650015-650022 650015 (961D) The GOER Con- cept. L. G. Harshfield, U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Center. This pa- per has been written to further the designer's understanding of the mili- tary vehicle design parameters, as they exist today, of the modern day field army's need for a new family of vehicles, which will traverse all types of terrain rapidly and efficiently with an increasing variety of cargo and weapons. The walking army of the past is yielding to the mechanized army on wheels. Since the design of automotive vehicles is at best a com- promise, the effectiveness of the com- pleted design depends largely on the talent and finesse of the designer. The GOER concept is such an ap- proach. 650016 (961F) Commercial Trucks in the Field Army. T. J. Bischoff, U.S. Army Mobility Com- mand. The Army is considering a four-category system of trucks for the field army, namely, military hi-mo- bility tactical, military tactical stan- dard, quasi military, and commercial administrative types, which are broadly described and charted herein. Commercial trucks are generally not considered adequate for field army use ; however this proposed overall four category system of trucks, po- tentially can offer real military effec- tiveness at lowest cost. The success of the proposed system will largely depend on well supported and thor- ough truck engineering system design and cost studies to insure effective product implementation. 650017 (962C) Machining Meth- ods Most Adaptable to Aerospace Materials. M. Field and W. P. Koster, Metcut Research Associates, Inc. The wide assortment of metals and alloys used for structural pur- poses in the aerospace industry is classified in terms of machinability. Applications of these materials to im- portant aerospace components, as well as major machining operations on these components, are indicated. The preponderance of metal removal is accomplished by conventional ma- chining methods. Recommended cut- ting conditions for milling, turning, and drilling of important alloys are presented. Electronic machining methods are applicable to special op- erations including applications, sur- face finish, and dimensional tolerance capability and practical rates of metal removal. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650018 (966A) Power and Cross Spectral Analysis of an Automo- bile Engine Mounting. I. Kane- shige, Isuzu Motors Ltd. A simple and easy calculation may be per- formed, using a three-mass vibration system model, to study the influence of an engine mounting on automobile vertical vibration. The advantage of an engine mounting of high damping rubber is confirmed by this calcula- tion, and is further verified by using power and cross spectral analysis of an automobile random vibration. The validity of the three-mass vibra- tion system is shown. 650019 (969A) Exhaust Valve Temperature - A Theoretical and Experimental Investigation. A. Stotter, Israel Institute of Technol- ogy; K. S. Woolley and E. S. Ip, English Electric Co., Ltd. This pa- per describes the calculation of the temperature distribution in a diesel- engine exhaust valve using an electro- lytic analog and a digital computer. Experimental verification on an en- gine showed good agreement between the calculated and measured values. The experimental work also showed that air/fuel ratio was the main fac- tor determining valve temperature when the engine was operated under naturally aspirated conditions. Ad- ditional experiments were carried out to determine the influence of super- charging on valve temperature. Cer- amic coatings and aircooling were tested as means of controlling heat flow to the valve. A detailed descrip- tion of the analog instrumentation is given. Discussion: Louis J. Daniš, Eaton Yale &amp; Towne Inc.; J. M. Cherrie, TRW, Inc.; authors' closure. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650020 (969C) Analysis of Ex- haust Valve Failure in Internal- Combustion Engines. A. Stotter and S. Afnaim, Israel Institute of Technology. This paper presents a theoretical approach to explain the valve failure process in diesel engines. Determination of transient tempera- tures and thermal stresses on an un- damaged valve face, and calculation of the increase of these quantities due to cracks, give a description of the process. Experiments support the validity of the computations. 650021 (971B) Economic Use of Electrodischarge Machining for Research, Production and Tool- ing - Through the Design and Construction of Low Cost Elec- trodes. E. W. Siegel, General Elec- tric Co. This paper discusses the use of electrodischarge machining in re- search, production, and tool work. Specific considerations determining the selection of proper electrode de- sign and construction particulars to fit a need are presented. Illustrations depicting the use of electrodischarge machining electrodes in production and tooling are included. Specific advantages to be realized by proper use of electrodischarge machining are outlined. A truly eco- nomic, high quality die can be ob- tained through use of this method when the tool engineer makes proper use of this technique. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650022 (974A) Investigation of the Mechanism of Surface Igni- tion in Internal-Combustion En- gines. J. 0. Becker, American Oil Co.; and W. L. Hull, University of 65</page><page sequence="5">650023-650029 Illinois. A theoretical model for the determination of surface ignition has been established on the basis of ther- mal and chemical properties of de- posits as related to heat transfer rates in an internal-combustion engine. It is used in conjunction with fuel igni- tion temperature and ignition delay, as obtained using an adiabatic com- pression machine. The model, in conjunction with the experimental data, has the flexibility of determin- ing the effects of various parameters which are prevalent in surface igni- tion. The fuels most prone to sur- face ignition were benzene, diisobu- tylene, toluene, and isooctane, in that order. The results agree favorably with those obtained by other experi- menters using actual engines. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650023 (975B) XLV Truck Cab - Designed for Low-Volume Pro- duction Overseas. K. P. Mazurek, E. D. Heins, and C. B. Hanssen, Chrysler Corp. United States auto- motive manufacturers, to maintain their pre-eminent position in world motor vehicle production, must ex- pand their operations overseas. Tooling amortization expenses for the highly sophisticated domestic models are exorbitant because of low produc- tion volume overseas. Therefore, it has been desirable to develop a vehi- cle which can be easily manufactured overseas for minimum capital ex^ penditures. Chrysler International's XLV truck cab has been styled, de- signed, and processed for low volume production overseas. This paper deals with the XLV program -from the original idea to production in Turkey. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650024 (977B) Etbylene-Propy- lene-Terpolymer Rubber De- signed for Automotive Applica- tions. P. A. Colgate, Copolymer Rubber &amp; Chemical Corp. The over- all scope of the paper covers automo- tive applications of ethylene-propy- lene-terpolymer rubber as viewed in relation to other elastomers. New information is contained herein which includes a presentation cover- ing various elastomers for a specific automotive use. The results indicate that in the foreseeable future this type of rubber will be a general purpose elastomer for the automotive indus- try. 650025 (978A) Some Problems Encountered in the Design and Development of High-Speed Die- sel Engines. C. J. Walder, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. This paper discusses some of the design and development problems experi- enced on high-speed diesel engines intended for use in passenger cars. The broad layout of a diesel engine required to give a performance com- parable to that of the gasoline-pow- ered vehicle is reviewed. Diesel combustion chambers suitable for high-speed operation are discussed, and the procedure adopted to select the specification of the injection equipment is outlined. The friction losses of diesel en- gines in relation to those of gasoline units and problems associated with thermal loadings of the cylinder head and piston are also reviewed. Discussion: A. E. W.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a method of stress and deformation analysis of body structures (sedan, station wagon, and so on). Many of these are rein- forced shell structures, but they con- tain enormous structural "cut-outs." An attempt is made to analyze them as structures consisting of both rigid frames and reinforced shells. In or- der to check the validity of this method, experiments are carried out on model and actual structures. In the former, comparison between the calculated results and the tests indi- cates that the agreement of stress and deflection is good, and in the latter, fairly good. Discussion: R. M. Studer, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. ; R. W. Heiney, Ford Motor Co. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650027 (979B) Road Noise Con- trol for a Car with a Tray Con- struction on Chassis. M. Shimizu. Prince Motors, Ltd. This paper de- scribes experiments to find the source of the road noise in automobiles and methods for correcting it. To find the major source of road noise, the time lag of the sound waves was mea- sured. Characteristics of a tray frame construction car were found by comparing the vibration modes of its frame with those of body-frame and unit construction cars. As a re- sult of experiments, it was found that the tray frame construction car com- bines desirable features of both body- frame and unit construction cars. 650028 (980A) Future of Auto- mobile Technique. F. L. Picard, Régie Nationale des Usines Renault. The quantitative expansion of the automobile, from now to 1985, is a mathematical certainty. "What tech- nical solutions will be adopted for the design of those cars" is an intriguing and thrilling question. This paper reviews new techniques being studied or tested by the various manufac- turers, or still in the laboratory stage, and he attempts in the light of already secured or expected results to ascer- tain their chances of success. He concludes with the success possibili- ties of these techniques, which in any case should bring improvements and more satisfaction to the users. 650029 (985A) Simple Model for Solid Surface Energy and Vari- ous Metal Interfaces. D. V. Kel- ler, Jr., Syracuse University. Mod- ern experimental techniques for the 66</page><page sequence="6">650030-650036 evaluation of the structure and prop- erties of the true vacuum-solid inter- face have led to the development of more exact models for such surface dependent phenomena as oxidation, catalysis, corrosion, adhesion and friction. An examination of the classical statistical theories of sur- faces is presented with particular em- phasis on the metallic state. The sta- tistical, or thermodynamical approach is then compared to a simple atomic model which is developed on the basis of some of the more recent experi- mental data. The atomic model is studied for consistency with such well established phenomena as surface energy and its variation with crystal- lographic orientation, adsorption, grain boundary formation and certain diffusion bonding systems. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650030 (986A) Use of Computer as Design Tool, J. H. Dunseth, Ternstedt Division, General Motors Corp. This paper discusses the com- puter support of the design process. Assistance in the areas of computer programs to perform general engi- neering calculations, mechanism ge- ometry optimization, and statistical analysis of dimensional tolerancing will be mentioned. 650031 (989B) Executive Opera- tor in Transition to Turbine- Powered Aircraft. D. A. Baldwin, Texaco Inc. Corporation top man- agement and their board of directors have progressed from the relatively low cost, war surplus aircraft for corporate travel, into the costly, high performance, turbine-powered air- planes during the past five years. Transition of the corporation's avia- tion department into the turbo prop and turbo jet field has been a difficult process because of the growing pains associated with new equipment and methods. However, the results have made the aviation department an im- portant and integral part of the cor- porate structure, and has provided the most efficient, comfortable, and safe air transportation ever experi- enced by these companies. 650032 (989E) Business Aviation Department Analysis. H. D. Ky- sor, Aeronautical Consultants &amp; As- sociates, Inc. Business aviation de- partment analysis can - and should be a positive constructive step to bridge the gulf that all too often exists between management techniques and aircraft operating practices. By bringing management and his chief pilot together in such fundamental areas as establishing policy and con- trolling costs, a business aviation con- sultant can help create a stronger, more efficient business aviation de- partment. This strengthening of business aviation departments by the application of proved management techniques is increasingly being de- manded by top management. It is proof that the airplane is, in fact, being treated as a tool of modern business. 650033 (990A) Radial Ply, Rigid Breaker Tires. V. E. Gough, F. B. Jones, and W. S. Udall, Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. Increased resist- ance to tread wear, improved road holding and safety, reduction of wander at ridges in road surfaces, lower spring rate, reduced transmis- sion of road roar generated on rough textured road surfaces and reduced fuel consumption, have all encour- aged the introduction of the radial ply, rigid breaker tire on the Euro- pean market to the extent that it is being used as original equipment on a number of modern vehicles. Al- though satisfactory endurance and standing wave performance have been reached, there are several areas which still present problems; and the need exists for high precision in manufac- ture. This new type of tire is prob- ably most suited to a vehicle designed to meet its specific characteristics. 650034 (993A) New IH 4*4 x 414 Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines. R. T. Mueller and L. H. Lacey, Construc- tion Equipment Division, Interna- tional Harvester Co. Two new high- speed, 4-stroke-cycle, turbocharged, compact, lightweight engines are de- scribed. These diesels are designed to meet the requirements of a wide variety of applications ranging from mobile to fixed installations. The design features and experimental test results of the DVT-573 and DT-429 engines are analyzed. 650035 (994B) Safety Aspects of Liquid Hydrogen. D. S. Allan, Arthur D. Little, Inc. The results of both research and practical experi- ence that have provided a working basis for the safe storage and han- dling of liquid hydrogen is reviewed. The hazards involved in the use of liquid hydrogen, including those re- lated to both its cryogenic character- istics and its reactivity with air, are discussed. General recommendations are made as to precautionary mea- sures which should be considered in the design and operation of liquid hydrogen facilities. 650036 (995A) Electroplating of Plastics. E. B. Saubestre, Enthone, Inc. Recent discoveries concerning chemical finishing treatments for plastics have brought about many automotive applications for electro- plated plastics. Plated plastic parts as such are not new, having been produced commercially for many years. However, surface deglazing was formerly required to secure plat- ing adhesion. This roughened the surface, resulting in dull-appearing electrodeposits. To obtain lustrous finishes, it was necessary to buff or burnish relatively thick copper elec- trodeposits. Economics of this proc- ess did not favor automotive ap- plications. New chemical surface treatments and improved copper elec- 67</page><page sequence="7">650037-650042 troplating processes, by eliminating mechanical operations required pre- viously, have led to production of plated plastics at costs competitive with plated metal castings.

Watanabe and T. Sakai, Keio University. Experimental com- pressors, with impellers having im- peller hub inclinations different from the rotation axis, and fitted with cor- responding vaneless parallel walled diffusers, were tested. The results showed that the 45-deg impeller had the highest total pressure ratios and slip coefficients, especially at large weight flows. The 60-deg impeller had only slightly lower values, and the centrifugal impeller had the low- est. 650038 (999C) Maintenance Con- siderations for Marketers of Ve- hicle and Industrial Powered Products Overseas. W. Webber, General Motors de Mexico. The principal factors affecting the efficient maintenance of mechanical equip- ment overseas are discussed. Qual- ity control problems created as a result of overseas local manufacture of replacement parts are explained and suggestions made for improving these conditions. The effect of low educational levels abroad with regard to maintenance of equipment is re- lated to the primary role of the engineer in industry, that is, the dis- semination and use of technical in- formation. 650039 (1003A) How Do They Die? Medical-Engineering Data from On-Scene Investigations of Fatal Automobile Accidents. D. F. Huelke, and P. W. Gikas, M.D., University of Michigan. On-scene investigations of 104 fatal accidents involving 136 fatalities has shown that ejection from the vehicle was the leading cause of the fatalities. The data indicate that the majority of these victims could have survived by the use of the simple lap seat belt. The steering assembly -the end of the steering column or steering wheel proper - was the leading cause of the fatalities among drivers. The ma- jority of these driver fatalities could not have been saved even with the sealt belt-shoulder harness restraint. Other than death by ejection, the in- strument panel was the leading cause of death of the front seat passengers, most of whom could have survived by using seat belts. Impacts to the door caused invasion of the occupant com- partment, and most would have died if restraints had been used. To de- crease the number of fatal injuries from automobile accidents future de- signs of automobile interiors must include crash attenuation features. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650040 (1005A) Piston Heating in Diesel Engines. L. Gross-Gro- nomski, Israel Institute of Technol- ogy. This paper deals with piston temperatures and their asymmetrical distribution. Experiments with a supercharged swirl chamber diesel engine were carried out. Results showed a logarithmic dependence of the relative piston temperature (with respect to inlet temperature) on fuel consumption per hour. This func- tion was independent of engine and blower speeds, as well as of fuel con- sumption per cycle. Increase of these three parameters resulted in higher values and in increased asym- metry of the piston heating. The above phenomena can be attributed to a combined effect of the gas stream from the swirl chamber, temperature and pressure of the cylinder gases, and piston velocity. Discussion: A. K. Blackwood, Inter- national Harvester Co.; A. Fei^nM. The University of Missouri at Rolla. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650041 (1005C) New Electronic Device for Measuring Torque. S. Ohigashi, Kyoto University ; G. Ono, Ono Measuring Instrument Co. Ltd.; and S. Machida, Gumma Uni- versity. A new torquemeter apply- ing digital technique has been de- veloped for measuring transmitted torque. Digital indication of torque can be provided by converting into a number of pulses the force of a torsion bar derived from a trans- mitted torque. Since the twist of the rotating torsion bar is detected with- out any contacts such as slip rings, the torquemeter is especially accu- rate and adaptable for use with high-speed engines. The instrument described here has been used success- fully to measure torque of a gas tur- bine operating at 20,000 rpm. Discussion: P. H. Schweitzer, Schweitzer &amp; Hussmann Engrg.

The three equilibrium equations governing the large deflections of thin plates are presented. A finite-difference over- relaxation technique is developed for the approximate solution of the sys- tem of nonlinear partial differential equations on a digital computer. To insure stability and speed up con- vergence of the numerical solution, nonlinear terms in the equations are treated as constants, which are eval- uated periodically as the iteration proceeds. This method gives stable solutions for practically all ranges of the overrelaxation factor; therefore, the overrelaxation factor is chosen to give convergence in the minimum number of iterations. Results ob- tained by using this technique on a simple plate bending problem and the corresponding results obtained by Levy and Wang are presented for comparison. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 68</page><page sequence="8">650043-650049 650043 (SP-261) Procedure for Assessing the Air Cushion Vehi- cle with Other Off -Road Vehicles. P. G. Fielding, Booz-Allen Applied Research, Inc. This paper presents the operations research, systems anal- ysis, and cost-effectiveness proce- dures used in comparing a new system concept with relatively conventional off-road Army vehicles. The com- bination of these procedures is indi- cative of the work that must be con- sidered in the development of new off-road systems. Of particular im- portance is the analysis of the wheel performance when it is off-loaded by a supplementary air cushion. Al- though much remains to be done in developing such procedures, it is con- cluded that until actual vehicles be- come available for operational test- ing, the procedures adopted will provide useful indications of the costs and effectiveness to be expected. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650044 (SP-261) Lunar Surface Vehicle Computer Evaluation Program. R. G. Eisenhardt and C. R. Murtaugh, Systems Division, Ben- dix Corp. A simulation program is established to determine the probabil- ity of success of a lunar surface vehi- cle in completing its primary mission, as well as various partial missions. This determination is obtained as a function of lunar surface conditions with realistic effects arising from equipment reliability and instrumen- tation accuracy. A Monte Carlo simulation technique accounts for the statistical nature of such variables as terrain and reliability without requir- ing real-time problem solution. The application of this computer program in the vehicle design phase facilitates trade-offs between subsystem per- formance and weight or power. The selection of operating strategy for normal and adverse lunar conditions (terrain or equipment difficulties) can be made. Of particular interest is the application of the program to the ranking of partial failures in terms of their criticality. On this basis, the most critical system ele- ments can be identified and appropri- ate attention given to their reliability at an early stage of design. Ex- amples of the program results are presented for a particular set of sys- tem constraints. This program is a useful and efficient tool for evaluating many complex and interrelated fac- tors in the vehicle system design. 650045 (SP-261) Overall Evalua- tion and Mobility Prediction of Ground Support Vehicles for Weapon Systems. C. N. Gardner, Professional Engineer (formerly with Sperry Utah Co.) ; B. H. Sutton, Sperry Utah Co.; and B. A. Lloyd, Sperry Phoenix Co. This paper is concerned with the overall evaluation and mobility prediction of ground support vehicles for weapons systems. These vehicles include those to trans- port the actual weapon, associated electronic equipment, spare weapons, and personnel. The paper reports on a study made at the Sperry Utah facility to assess the mobility capa- bilities of over 60 vehicles. It sum- marizes performance data and en- vironmental factors, and presents some graphical data. 650046 (SP-261) System Evalua- tion of Military Vehicle Con- cepts. R. A. Liston, U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Center. This pa- per proposes the treatment of vehicle concept evaluation on the basis of a systems analysis approach. The author suggests that vehicle param- eters be divided into predictable and statistical characteristics. These in- clude transportability, aerial trans- portability, weight, dimensions, pay- load, range, highway and off-road performance in the former category and initial cost, producibility, relia- bility, maintainability, and effective- ness in the latter. Descriptions of each characteristic are presented. 650047 (SP-261) Terrain Vehicle System Evaluation. M. G. Bekker and A. V. Butterworth, Defense Re- search Laboratories, General Motors Corp. The methods used in lunar surface locomotion analysis are ap- plied in a generalized manner to the evaluation of locomotion systems. First, the terrain-vehicle system is described as to mission, operation requirements, environment, and vehi- cle configuration. Cost effectiveness ratio is then considered from several viewpoints. An example is presented of how to evaluate the reliability of vehicle configuration to meet military needs. 650048 (SP-261) Vehicle Mission Analysis. I. R. Ehrlich, Stevens In- stitute of Technology; E. Markow and R. E. Dowd, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. A method is pre- sented whereby, using the predicted spectrum of lunar soil properties in terms of the land locomotion soil value system, the performance of various vehicle configurations are an- alyzed. From this analysis the mis- sion success probability is calculated from the standpoint of vehicle im- mobilization, fuel consumption, travel time, torque requirements, or inabil- ity to climb the required slopes. 650049 (SP-263) An Introduc- tion to the Nuclear Powered En- ergy Depot Concept. K. O. Lin- dell, Nuclear Power Division, U.S. Army Office of the Chief of Engineers. Because of increased mechanization, petroleum supply has become one of the major problems of military logis- tics, especially in Army operations where small, dispersed energy de- mands often necessitate an extensive, vulnerable fuel supply complex. The nuclear powered energy depot, con- ceived as a potential solution to the problem, will utilize a nuclear reactor to produce a chemical fuel for vehi- cle and aircraft engines. The energy depot, logistically independent for a year, would operate with or near the consumer in the field and consider- ably broaden Army capabilities. 69</page><page sequence="9">650050-650055 650050 (SP-263) Energy Depot - A Concept for Reducing the Mili- tary Supply Burden. A. B. Ros- enthal, Allison Division, General Motors Corp. This paper reviews objectives, approach, and current status of energy depot studies con- ducted by Allison. An evolutionary concept is described for near term applications wherein nuclear energy, air, and water can be combined to produce a fuel for use in conventional vehicle engines. Fuel manufacture and engine operation studies are dis- cussed. For longer term use, a revo- lutionary concept is described where- by a nuclear power source can be used to recharge an electric vehicle propulsion system. Both the evolu- tionary and revolutionary concepts are shown to provide important logis- tics advantages for military opera- tions. Discussion: R. J. Flannery, American Oil Co.; E. B.

The fuel logistics problem of the Army could be reduced or eliminated by the use of nuclear energy in this field. In this concept nuclear energy is con- verted to chemical fuels with locally available raw materials. Hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water with electricity from a nuclear reactor system. It can be converted to liquid hydrogen for ease of trans- portation. Alternately, liquid am- monia can be produced from the hydrogen and nitrogen extracted from air through liquefaction of air. These fuels can be used most effi- ciently in fuel cell systems. The elec- tric powered vehicles in these cases may have distinct military advan- tages. The fuels can be used to power modified combustion engines. Discussion: R. J. Flannery, American Oil Co.; E. B. Rifkin, Ethyl Corp.; T. O. Wagner, American Oil Co.; P. S. Myers and 0. A.

Mitchell, Re- search Laboratories, General Motors Corp. Studies were conducted using spark-ignited reciprocating engines to evaluate ammonia as an alternate fuel for certain military applications. Conventional engines were found to perform poorly on ammonia. Sev- eral practical methods for improving engine performance while burning ammonia are described including in- creased spark energy, increased com- pression ratio, engine supercharging and hydrogen addition to the fuel. Dissociation of ammonia was investi- gated as a practical means for supply- ing hydrogen to an engine. The study indicates that satisfactory en- gine performance can be obtained while burning ammonia. Auxiliary equipment and controls necessary for vehicular use will require develop- ment.

Strang, Aircraft Division, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Growth in computing ma- chine power over the last 15-20 years has permitted development of precise and rapid stress analysis techniques. The reasons for, importance of, and the precision and speed of such methods are given. 650054 (SP-264) Computerized Static and Dynamic Aircraft Structural Analysis System - Use of Computer Programs in Air- craft Design. M. Stone, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The increasing complexity of aircraft structures is creating new problems in structural analysis. The problems are in the areas of static and dynamic loads analysis, stress analysis, statistical methods, fatigue, flutter, acoustics, and associated fields including aero- dynamics and heat transfer. These developments are increasing the need for fully automatic computer pro- grams for design use. Such pro- grams must be technically sound, efficient in the use of computer time, rapid in providing answers for design and simple enough to minimize train- ing requirements. This paper re- views existing methods from the standpoints of technical requirements, personnel familiarization and ef- fectiveness. Recommendations are made for future developments. 650055 (SP-264) Computerized Static and Dynamic Aircraft Structural Analysis System - En- gineering Aspects and Mathemat- ical Formulation of the Problem. P. H. Denke, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The need for a comprehensive computing system for aircraft struc- tural analysis is discussed. Suitable criteria for such a system are pre- sented. The Douglas redundant force analysis, a general-purpose dig- ital computer method for static stress analysis, is described. Details of the method are presented, including the structure cutter routine for the auto- matic selection of redundants. The FORMAT system described is a com- prehensive computing approach that permits rapid programming by the engineer of matrix and pseudo matrix operations. The system provides a 70</page><page sequence="10">650056-650063 means for developing and extending structural analytical programs and for combining such programs with dynamic, aerodynamic, and thermo- dynamic programs in the solution of structural problems. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650056 (SP-264) Computerized Static and Dynamic Aircraft Structural Analysis System - Programming the System. J. K. Matlock, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. Douglas programming concepts, or- ganization, and details employed in structural analysis are presented. Procedures for identifying, storing, and retrieving matrix data are dis- cussed. The DEMON programming system for the IBM 7094, which in- cludes the monitor and the language of present redundant force analysis, is described. Since this system can only be run on an IBM 709, 7090, or 7094, and cannot be easily run out- side of Douglas, a new system called FORMAT is being developed. FOR- MAT is a matrix abstraction program written almost completely in FORT- RAN IV language. It provides the ability to perform matrix operations on very large matrices, which are stored on tape, and it contains pro- visions for the inclusion of user-coded FORTRAN IV subroutines. 650057 (SP-265) Truck Tire Economics - Tire Cost. W. L. Campbell, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper covers methods of determining tire cost per mile, plus the effect of proper scrap analysis and fleet logistics analysis upon tire cost, in a typical over-the-road dry freight fleet. The conclusion is that it is reasonable to expect a fleet of this type, operating under optimum conditions, to realize a tire cost of 0.7 mills per mile. 650058 (SP-265) Truck Tire Economies - Tire Selection. W. Denton, B. F. Goodrich Co. Two conditions must be fulfilled in select- ing truck tires for over-the-road ser- vice: tires must be adequate for the service, and tire costs must be mini- mal. Four types of truck tires avail- able for over-the-road service are: highway tires -usable for all high- way service except where extra trac- tion is required, "extra tread" high- way tires -usable to obtain higher tread miles when tire temperature is not excessive, "cross lug" highway tires - usable on drive wheels to ob- tain higher tread miles and extra traction, and special service mud- snow tires - usable on drive wheels to provide added traction in mud or snow or other limited off-the-road service. 650059 (SP-265) Truck Tire Economics - Effect of Tire Main- tenance. G. A. Kling, General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper describes how a proper maintenance program can increase tire life. The function of a maintenance manager is dis- cussed, as is the importance of keep- ing inspection and repair records. Several forms are illustrated. Main- tenance equipment and procedures are described, and repair procedures are also discussed. 650060 (SP-265) Truck Tire Economies - Effect of Vehicle Maintenance. L. L. Baldwin, Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper points out that some of the most im- portant factors causing reduction in tire mileage are the increase of horse- power, speed, and torque of modern tractors and trucks as compared to those in popular use 7 to 10 years ago. The importance of mainte- nance to the vehicle toward the end of reducing tire costs to a minimum is emphasized. These factors include front wheel alignment and loading, wheel and tire assembly concentricity, lateral and radial runout, balance, drive and trailer axle alignment prob- lems, suspension maintenance prob- lems ; wide-spread axle operation, tag axles, shock absorbers, warning systems, brakes, wheel bearings, belts, and seals. 650061 (SP-265) Truck Tire Economics - Considerations in Truck Tire Retreading. W. S. McDowell and C. I. Reynolds, U.S. Rubber Tire Co. The ability of a commercial truck operator to achieve a satisfactorily low cost per tire mile can depend in large part on the effec- tiveness of his retread program. An understanding of the factors affecting retreadability is a prerequisite to the establishment of such a program. A truck tire carcass has a certain amount of service built into it. The number of retreads that are both possible and practical depends in large part on the type and length of service during the original tread life, as well as the type of tire. A good record system is essential. 650062 (SP-268) Introduction to Surface Texture of Automotive Sheet Steel. J. E. Morgan, Steel Division, Ford Motor Co. The sur- face texture of automotive sheet steel is the pattern of peaks and valleys, or bumps, applied by means of the rolling process during the manufac- ture of steel. Summarized are the history of the process as it developed in the steel industry, methods of mea- suring texture characteristics, trends in surface texture, and cooperative ventures by the automotive and steel industries through SAE to resolve problems in instrumentation. 650063 (SP-268) Development of Procedures and Equipment for Determining Surface Texture Peak Count and Operation of Measuring Instrumentation. W. C. Harmon, Republic Steel Corp. The measurement of surface textures has long been a problem half-solved. Attempts to solve this riddle are dis- cussed. A new measurement con- cept is introduced which solves the remaining half of the problem. The result is a more explicit expression of surface finish qualities. Surface 71</page><page sequence="11">650064-650078 texture values can now be expressed in terms of numbers. A practical procedure and equipment are de- scribed. Operation of the measur- ing instrumentation is discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650064 (SP-268) Evaluation of Surface Texture Measuring Methods. F. A. Richards, Armco Steel Corp. A special round robin test program to evaluate the ability to measure surface texture of steel sheets with two types of instrumentation used by steel suppliers and automo- tive consumers is described. The in- strumentation used is intended for measuring matte finish by determin- ation of microinch roughness and peaks per inch density. Correlations between the two types of instruments are developed. Variations inherent in the surface texture of a single sheet, within the instruments and among instruments of the same type are determined. It has been possible from this study to establish limits within which results are reproducible. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650065 (SP-268) Correlation of Instrumentation with Painted Appearance. A. S. Kasper, Chrys- ler Corp. Definite relationships have been established between the visual appearance of painted surfaces and the surface texture of the underlying sheet metal. The sensitivity of this effect is shown to be quantitatively dependent upon the paint thickness and type of finishing system. It has been further established, for the first lime, that a combination of micro- inch roughness height and peak count readings of surface texture correlate better with final painted appearance of sheet metal panels than does micro- inch roughness height reading alone. Instrumented measurements of sur- face texture were also shown to be significantly more meaningful than visual evaluations of bare metal sur- faces in correlating with final painted appearance. 650073 (945A) Evolution of a Pacemaker. R. H. Freeburger, Army Mobility Command. This pa- per discusses today's 14 ton vehicle which has evolved from many years of design, test, production, and user experience. Its unique charac- teristics have appeal for civilian spe- cial interest. Military developments have advanced the off-road features which often are included in similar commercial vehicles. Development trends indicate the probable design of a future military or commercial 14 -ton vehicle. 650074 (945B) Four Wheel Drive Pleasure Vehicle. P. B. Hartman, Kaiser Jeep Corp. A new four- wheel drive automobile of contem- porary styling has been developed and produced which shows considerable promise as a passenger-cargo-utility vehicle, with on-the-road agility and off-the-road mobility for pleasure, fun, and work. Among its several unique and interesting features is the independent suspension of the front driving axle. 650075 (945C) Front Wheel Drive Components to Achieve Low Silhouette. O. E. Phelps, Dana Corp., Salisbury Div. The number of buyers interested in four-wheel drive vehicles for recreation is in- creasing, and a vehicle offering four- wheel drive and maintaining present automobile characteristics is of spe- cial interest to such buyers. Utility capabilities could make this type of vehicle even more attractive. It ap- pears that a larger market can be generated for passenger-utility type vehicles if the four-wheel drive is of- fered as an option, but the option poses numerous design problems. This paper presents some details of conventional four-wheel-drive power trains, and describes power trains in which independent suspension and low silhouette are emphasized. 650076 (945D) Four-Wheel Drive as Sportsman's Vehicle. S. In- tani, Toyota Motor Corp., Ltd. This paper explains the prewar and war- time history of the lightweight four- wheel drive in Japan and the postwar development originated since the Ko- rean War. The features of the Jap- anese four-wheel-drive Toyota Land Cruiser as a sportsman's vehicle are discussed. The items discussed are mainly concerning mobility over rough terrain, namely, power, weight, and size. Such comfort and con- venience items as riding, handling, and enclosure are described. 650077 (947A) Long-Life Con- siderations for Gas Air Condi- tioning Engines. H. P. Bullard, Continental Motors Corp. Natural gas burning engines, both large and small, are being applied to an in- creasing number of installations where operating cost considerations show an advantage over purchased electric power. Air conditioning and refrigeration applications account for a large percentage of these instal- lations. This paper reviews the con- sideration given to the development and application of a series of engines intended specifically for this type of service. The overall objective has been to reduce the cost of power by providing efficient operation, long service life, and unattended operation which fits the maintenance pattern of the other equipment in the installa- tion. 650078 (949B) Thermodynamic Analysis of the Stirling Cycle and a Comparison with Experiment. D. W. Kirkley, Northern Res. &amp; Engrg. Corp., Int'l. An analysis of the Stirling cycle has been carried out in which most of the assumptions made in previous theoretical studies have been discarded. The effects of nonisothermal expansion and com- pression processes, aerodynamic fric- tion, and imperfect regeneration are taken into account. Theoretical per- 72</page><page sequence="12">650079-650085 formance figures are obtained for an engine of a particular geometry and are compared to results obtained in a parallel experimental program. The experimental values of thermal effi- ciency and power output are found to be lower than those predicted by the theory. A better correlation is ob- tained if allowance is made for the increase in friction factor which takes place in fluctuating flow conditions. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650079 (949C) Thermal Design of Stirling-Cycle Machines. F. A. Creswick, Battelle Memorial Inst. This paper shows the design of the heat-transfer surfaces of Stirling- cycle machines which can be based on an ideal isothermal analysis of the cycle and the use of conventional heat exchanger design techniques, however, the use of Steady-flow heat- transfer data and expressions for ef- fectiveness as a function of Ntu may not he valid. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650080 (950B) Questions, Not Solutions, on Engineering Educa- tion. H. W. Iversen, California Univ. This paper relates the present trends of engineering education in California's public higher education system. General problems of mod- ern engineering education are dis- cussed, along with those inherent in the state's public supported system. The paper describes engineering edu- cation in several levels of higher edu- cation: the university, the state col- leges, and the junior colleges; and shows the interrelation among the three. 650081 (950D) Engineering Fac- ulty and Industry. N. A. Hall, En- gineering Education Commission. Engineering faculty members, to be effective in their educational activi- ties, must have a working familiarity with the real engineering tasks of their counterparts in industry. In- dustry has been cooperative in this respect by providing summer work experience and consulting opportuni- ties for engineering faculty, or con- ducting seminars and short courses. Experience has shown, however, that such involvement can be much more rewarding for engineering faculty and, ultimately, for industry, if it can be more directly related to the edu- cational activities of the individual returning to the classroom. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650082 (951B) Another Mile- stone in Motor Oils. C. C. Colyer and T. B. Tom, American Oil Co. Refiners have developed a new class of motor oils to meet requirements imposed by the longer intervals be- tween drains now recommended by carmakers. The long-life oil per- forms far better than the conven- tional MS oil and, ideally, retains its superior performance features throughout the long drain period. Development of the long-life oil is a milestone in motor oil technology. A long-life oil can be designed by relying primarily on three field tests: one which promotes sludge; another rust; and the third, oxidation. All three field tests provide an opportu- nity to evaluate antiwear properties. Conditions for laboratory engines can be chosen to simulate the field results. 650083 (952A) World Survey of Small Engine Developments. W. E. Meyer, Pennsylvania State Univ. Lightweight, aircooled engines of 10 hp or less manufactured in Europe and Japan are surveyed with an at- tempt to isolate general trends. Newer engines and their main fea- tures are described. Both gasoline and diesel engines (rated at 3000 rpm or above) are included in the survey. It is found that there are no startling novelties with the exception of the Sachs-Wankel engine which, how- ever, is not yet in production, but there are a number of interesting so- lutions to conventional problems. 650084 (953A) Body Design and Manufacturing Methods Used in Europe. H. R. Barber, Pressed Steel Co. Ltd. This paper analyses some of the main reasons for the fundamental differences, particularly in relation to size, among typical best selling cars in America and Europe. Economic conditions as well as other relevant factors are briefly discussed. Various models are illustrated, includ- ing the Rover 2000. One of the main features of this latter car is the sys- tem of applying painted and finished skin panel units by bolting to a base unit capable of carrying all required loads. 650085 (957B) Basic Nature of V ehicle Understee r-0 versteer . Walter Bergman, Ford Motor Co. A comprehensive analysis of vehicle un- dersteer-oversteer, utilizing theoreti- cal and experimental approaches, is outlined. It departs from the con- ventional by defining understeer- oversteer in the transient as well as in the steady-state condition under various types of inputs. The rela- tionship between understeer-oversteer and directional and oscillatory stabil- ity is stated within this concept. The paper introduces new definitions, based on transient condition analysis, for direct and indirect understeer, di- rectional and oscillatory stability, side-slip velocity, and others. It em- ploys a computer program evolved from the equations of motion, shown in the comprehensive Appendix, to analyze the basic nature of under- steer-oversteer. New procedures are outlined for quantitative determina- tion of vehicle understeer and stabil- ity. The relationships between un- dersteer, oscillatory stability, and the subjective "feel" of passenger auto- mobiles are discussed. Discussion: A. G. Fonda, Giannini Con- trols Corp.; A. D.

Oldberg and R. E. Stuem- ky, Eaton Mfg. Co., Spring Div. The development of the constant-velocity universal joint offers the twofold ad- vantage of correcting universal joint induced vibration in present-day pas- senger cars, as well as allowing greater flexibility in driveline design. This paper discusses briefly various design variables which entered into the development of the constant ve- locity universal joint as well as quali- fication tests undertaken in the lab- oratory to determine performance suitability. Future applications to powered steering axles and swing axles may well improve the competi- tive position of this type universal joint. 650087 (960B) VJ 101 Super- sonic VTOL. G. L. Bright, Entwick- lungsring Sud. The VJ 101 C is a high-speed research aircraft being de- veloped by the firms of Bölkow, Hein- kel and Messerschmitt for the West German Government. It is designed to investigate a VTOL capability com- bined with a high supersonic level flight speed. To date, two models of this aircraft have been designed and built. This paper presents a gen- eral description of their operation and capabilities as determined by an intensive testing program that is still in progress. 650088 (960F) Divergent Vibra- tion in Helicopter Tail Rotors. Y. Normand, Sud Aviation. Heli- copter tail rotors are subject to many types of divergent vibrations. A classification of these various types is presented, and a description given of those which have been actually ob- served. The means used by manu- facturers to predict and avoid such vibrations include various calcula- tions in the design stage and special test stands for development work. Substantiation tests accomplished on these stands enable flight tests to be undertaken with a tail rotor free from divergent vibrations€ 650089 (960G) Actuator Disc Theory for Shed Wake at Low Tip Speed Ratios. J. P. Jones, Mas- sachusetts Inst, of Technology. A model of flow through a helicopter rotor, suitable for estimating effects of shed wake in hovering and at low tip speed ratios, is described. With this method, the result for aerody- namic damping of blade bending os- cillations is in agreement with more elaborate theories. It is shown that damping of small natural oscillations is to a first order unaffected by tip speed ratio. Interharmonic cou- plings, which are neglected in more elaborate theories, prove to be quite important, especially if resonance oc- curs. Also, in the presence of strong interharmonic couplings, the effective lift curve slope cannot be considered independent of blade motion. 650090 (961C) XM-561 Cargo Truck - a Breakthrough in Mo- bility. R. E. Zimmerman, Army Tank Automotive Center. This pa- per presents a new concept in wheeled vehicle mobility which verifies the advantage of an articulated system over the rigid wheeled vehicle. It traces the history of the development of the XM561 cargo truck, and pre- sents the design configuration, ar- ticulation system, and mobility eval- uation as compared with other mili- tary vehicles. 650091 (962B) Attainment of Im- proved Material Properties by Hot Working Techniques. R. P. Daykin, Ladish Co. The generally beneficial effects of forging on pre- cipitation-hardened heat-resistant al- loys can be considerably increased by the addition of titanium and alumi- num to the material. These elements, however, cause complications in the casting and forging processes, but by applying controlled forging pro- graming, these disadvantages can be overcome. This paper describes the desirable and undesirable character- istics of a Ti + Al alloy and explains some of the principles involved in setting up programed forging cycles to produce improved material proper- ties such as optimum strength, uni- formity, and reproducibility. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650092 (963A) Retention of Di- rectional Control when Braking. R. D. Lister, Road Research Lab. (England). This paper describes ways of preventing the loss of direc- tional control which frequently oc- curs during emergencies, including special braking techniques, changes in brake distribution, balancing of brake reactions, and nonlocking braking systems. Details are given of a particular application of a nonlocking braking system; Test results at speeds up to 140 mph of the braking performance and directional stability and reduc- tions of up to 35% in braking dis- tances obtained on some wet surfaces. Considerable reduction in tire ad- hesion, which occurs when a wheel locks can be avoided by anti-locking braking systems. Discussion: D. F. Nordeen, Research Labs., General Motors Corp.; J. C.

W. A. Redmond and P. E. Beam, Jr., Allison Div., GMC. The mission capability of some gas turbine powered vehicles can be great- ly enhanced by the application of re- generation to the engine thermody- namic cycle. The application of re- generation to aircraft propulsion pre- sents many unique design problems to the designer as a result of the need for very lightweight components and high performance. The many design parameters that must be evaluated, and the many tradeoff studies that must be accomplished to arrive at the best regenerator and gas turbine de- sign are discussed. Also, the results of a series of studies are presented to graphically portray the fuel economy which results from the use of regen- erative engines. 650100 (973B) Regenerators En- hance Patrol Aircraft Capability. H. B. Crockett and R. E. Field, Lock- heed-California Co. This paper notes the large increase in fuel economy due to the use of the regenerative cycle, particularly at low partial pow- er. It then examines the striking ef- fect of using regenerative turboprop engines on the trade-off between vari- ous aspects of patrol aircraft design and mission capability. 650101 (973C) Application of Advanced Regenerative Power- plants to Present and Future Air- craft. G. P. Sallee, Bureau of Naval Weapons. The possibility of improv- ing aircraft range, payload, and en- durance through application of re- generative cycle engines is examined in this paper. Emphasis is placed on the reduction in propulsion system weight realizable for first and second generation aircraft of the future. Propulsion system characteristics of future regenerative and nonregenera- tive turboshaft, turboprop, and turbo- fan engines is estimated and dis- cussed. 650102 (975C) Review of Com- mercial Vehicles in Japan. M. Kawada, Tokyo Univ. Japan's truck production in 1962 accounted for 70% of total vehicles manufactured. Of this, 85% consisted of compacts and midget models for use by private enterprises and over congested nar- row roads. Because of severe oper- ating conditions on unpaved bumpy roads, large payloads require sturdier 75</page><page sequence="15">650103-650109 vehicles and higher ratios of power to weight than do those in other countries. Passenger bus transporta- tion is expanding and extending serv- ice distances. Practically all large vehicles are diesel powered, but small- er ones are gasoline powered. The modernization of highways will bring larger and speedier models with more engine horsepower for longer dis- tances. 650103 (975D) Present and Fu- ture Trends in the Construction of European Commercial Vehi- cles. M. Persia and G. Faraggiana, Fiat S.p.A. European road freight transport, already important in the late 1930s, had a great growth after World War II and a further one dur- ing the 1950's, following the increase in commercial volume inside and out- side the European Economic Com- munity, or Common Market. The strong and sometimes fundamental differences among regulations of the various European countries have up to now made possible the use of a specific type of truck for long-dis- tance haulage. After discussing the background of transport in Europe and examining present truck design, the major characteristics of the long- distance haulage truck or truck trac- tor are described. 650104 (975E) Component Stan- dardization for Truck Variety at Low Volume. H. H. Haas, Klöck- ner Humboldt-Deutz AG. European commercial vehicle manufacturers generally do not produce heavy-duty vehicles in very large unit numbers of one individual type, but rather they standardize parts, subassemblies, and assemblies that are used in many or all types. Thus they manufacture large numbers of identical individual parts that are adaptable to the vari- ous types of vehicles. This permits variety in small production runs. The method is described by detailed examples taken from the production records of the Klöckner-Humboldt Deutz AG Werk Ulm. 650105 (975F) Changing Trends in British Commercial Vehicles. G. A. Kozloff, Chrysler Motors, Ltd. The British commercial vehicle in- dustry is going through a period of major change to keep pace with mar- ket needs and to comply with the new Construction and Use Regulations in- troduced recently. The changes will involve new thinking relative to cab configuration, engine output, and gen- eral requirements involving higher tonnage vehicles. The designs will consider both home and export needs in order to achieve as much stan- dardization as possible. It is be- lieved the British industry will main- tain its highly competitive position in world markets as a result of these developments. 650106 (975G) VAL Bus Chassis and Some European Compari- sons. A. Williamson, Vauxhall Mo- tors Ltd. This paper describes the evolutionary design process which had to be traversed in order to reach a coach design solution that would satisfy the particular requirements of Vauxhall. It shows how an in- creased number of small tires will carry a given gross vehicle weight with a more efficient load distribution pattern than large single tires. The paper concludes that a twin-steer, small-tired coach carrying 50 or more passengers on a single deck is an ex- tremely safe, good riding, and highly maneuverable vehicle. 650107 (976C) Value Engineer- ing and the VTOL. D. M. Plumb, United Aircraft Corp., Sikorsky Air- craft Div. Thfe future acceptance and expansion of the VTOL, espe- cially in its newer configurations, lies in its meeting the economics of the user. The commercial operator is especially influenced by these con- siderations. The use of the function- cost-creative approach of value engi- neering is a valuable means to effect cost reductions with equal or im- proved value. This can and should be done at the conceptual as well as the subsequent periods. Actual proj- ects are presented to show the appli- cation of value engineering at the different stages. 650108 (978B) Developing High- Speed Direct-Injection Diesel En- gines. H. List and S. Pachernegg, List Res. Inst.; and H. L. Wittek, List- Rosen-Wittek Associates, Inc. Theo- retical and practical aspects of high- speed engine development are pre- sented including influence of related parameters upon theoretical cycle ef- ficiency; importance of good volu- metric efficiency; concept of "com- bustion efficiency" and its use in evaluating a system; required move- ment of the air charge and methods for inducing it. Performance data are given for a small cylinder at speeds to 4200 rpm. The actual rate of injection, obtained from different nozzle types, is compared with that theoretically required. Valve timing is analyzed with reference to volu- metric efficiency as well as to practi- cal considerations. Some causes of engine friction and actual friction curves are shown. Engine noise - its origin, measurement, and evalua- tion-is also discussed. 650109 (978C) Example of De- velopment in Automotive Small, High-Speed Diesel Engines. S. Tanaka, S. Seki, and H. Nakamura, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. This paper describes the designing points and the research results ob- tained during the development of 2-liter and 3-liter capacity diesel en- gines, and also reviews the develop- ment of small diesel engines. It com- pares the diesel engine with the same bore and stroke gasoline engine, si- multaneously developed, on the basis of their performances and structures. 76</page><page sequence="16">650110-650117 650110 (981A) Machining Data Concepts for Evaluating New Cut- ting Tool Materials. J. F. Kahles and J. Maranchik, Jr., Metcut Res. Associates, Inc. Cost data are pre- sented which provide justification for making systematic studies of all types of machining processes in order to select the most applicable tool mate- rials. Full tool life tests are suggest- ed for obtaining reliable machining data. Specific tool life test data are supplied for the drilling, reaming, and tapping of 4340 steel at 42 Rc, for the face milling of 32510 and 60003 grades of malleable iron, and for the comparative evaluation of T-15, and ultrahard high speed steels, C-8, titanium carbide base, and cera- mic cutting tools. Sources of machin- ing information are referenced along with a description of the Air Force Machinability Data Center. 650111 (981B) Cemented Oxides - Where, When and Höw to Ap- ply. R. G. Brierley, General Elee. Co. Cemented oxide cutting tool ma- terial (commonly called ceramic) has a place in the total machining effort. Its high hardness, abrasion resist- ance, low heat conductivity, and in- ert nature make it particularly well suited to some chip forming applica- tions. Compared to carbide, since ce- mented oxide is low in strength, shear, and tension, certain design and ap- plication considerations are manda- tory if this type of material is to be used successfully. Some of these con- siderations are discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650112 (983C) Development of the Low-Profile Passenger Tire. J. F. Hutchinson, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Inc. The development of the low profile passenger tire is described. This tire provides im- proved handling and stability, faster cornering, improved high-speed per- formance, and longer tread life, with no loss in noise level or riding com- fort. Tire characteristics described include improved tread design and tread rubber compounding, contour shoulder, and low profile carcass. The effect of cord angle on tire in- flation shape and speed are also dis- cussed. 650113 (986B) Practical Wind- shield Wiper System Design Package for a Small Digital Com- puter. V. J. George and P. F. Doer- ing, Delco Appliance Div., GMC. This paper discusses the method now employed by Delco to design wind- shield wiper systems on a small di- gital computer. The background information leading up to the devel- opment of the computer program is presented along with the complete computer program package and the relationship the subprograms have to it. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650114 (987A) New Small-Scale Method for Measuring Fuel Ther- mal Stability. F. Burggraf and M. W. Shayeson, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. A miniature single-tube heat exchanger has been set up for making precise measure- ments of the fuel-side, heat-transfer coefficient. Conditions of turbulent flow, temperature level, and heat flux are maintained to simulate high Mach number flight. The decay of the fuel- side coefficient, due to the deposition of a varnish film at high temperature, is measured over extended time in- tervals. The rate of decay of the co- efficient as a function of temperature is a quantitative measurement of fuel thermal stability. The device has been named Minex. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650115 (987B) Use of High Tem- perature Hydrocarbon Fuels in Subsonic Flight Environment. J. A. Hager, Air Force Aero. Pro- pulsion Lab. Studies on the effects of a subsonic flight environment on fuels refined for high Mach number application are reported. Require- ments and hydrocarbon composition for fuel to withstand high Mach num- ber stresses are cited and their com- patibility with conventional systems at low temperatures is discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650116 (989C) Business Aircraft Operator in Transition to Tur- bine Equipment. R. J. Hixson, Ford Motor Co. The business air- craft operator making the transition to turbine powered equipment will find new concepts and differences in operation which may be grouped un- der five major categories for discus- sion : the powerplant itself, differences brought about by fuel, swept wing effects, speed differences, and altitude requirements. Consideration is given to the unfamiliar aspects of operation which result from these factors. An understanding of these new ideas is not difficult, but will result in a smooth transition to the operation of turbine powered equipment. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650117 (990B) Vibrational Per- formance Differences Between Tires with Criss-Cross and Ra- dial Plies. A. Chiesa, Pirelli, S.p.A. In order to outline the differences in vibrational performance of cross-bi- ased and radial tires, the principal types of vibration present in a run- ning car, for which the tires are fully or partly responsible, were surveyed. Then the mechanical parameters which define tire behavior were stressed. Referring to two types of tires, one radial and one cross-biased of the same size, the values assumed by various parameters (such as verti- cal and lateral dynamic stiffness) and vertical complex transfer functions are presented, including the frequen- cy spectra of the oscillations of two different cars tested on the same road, alternately equipped with both types of tires. The frequency spectra clearly emphasized many differences between 77</page><page sequence="17">650118-650133 radial and cross-biased tires, and demonstrated the existence of tire- vehicle interactions which are de- pendent on the structure of the ve- hicle itself. This information should be useful to the car designer in order to adapt the structure of the car to the particular type of tire chosen. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650118 (994D) Structural De- sign Considerations for Storage of Liquid Hydrogen in a Space Vehicle. J. Sagata, Douglas Air- craft Co., Inc. The S-IV and S-IVB stages for the Saturn vehicles were designed to utilize the high specific impulse of the liquid hydrogen-liq- uid oxygen propulsion system. The use of liquid hydrogen presented spe- cial structural problems that led to the development of the reinforced foam internal insulation and the sand- wiched honeycomb common bulk- head. The major design problem in each case was the high thermal stress resulting from the steep thermal gra- dient across the depth of the struc- ture. For the extreme temperatures involved the thermal stresses were very high and were dominant factors in establishing the designs. 650119 (996B) Classification of Gas Turbine and Piston Engines for Competition Purposes. P. Spear, Rubery Owen &amp; Co. Ltd.; and R. N. Penny, Rover Co. Ltd. A for- mula is proposed to relate the power of a gas turbine engine to that of a piston engine so that gas turbine pow- ered automobiles can race competi- tively with equal opportunity. A re- view of past and present formulas is used to stipulate modern require- ments. The parameters are derived from a mathematical analysis of tur- bine principles and a statistical anal- ysis of recent engine data gives the final relationship. Draft regulations are presented that can be adopted by racing authorities. The formula re- lates the high pressure nozzle area of a gas turbine engine to the cylinder capacity of a piston engine, including effect of turbine compressor pressure ratio. Stimulus of competition could make a new contribution to the prac- tical application of the gas turbine to automotive vehicles. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650120 (998B) Tractor Earth Blading at High Speeds Now a Reality. E. T. Small, Engineering Consultant. Tractor dozers and bucket loaders require two exacting readjustments for every initial ad- justment of the blade to make a smooth cut. The necessary precision of these blade adjustments at fast speeds is beyond the human capabili- ties of anł operator. This paper ex- plains how the blade readjustments are now being performed automati- cally, producing smooth cuts and per- mitting high speed blading. The ac- curacy of blade control provided by this system opens new avenues of ap- plications and performance for trac- tor blading operations. 650121 (998C) Transportation and Handling of Large Solid Motors. B. M. Teague, Martin Co. Solid rocket motors for use in booster stages of launch vehicles in the post- Saturn era may be about 300 in. in diameter and weigh 6,000,000 lb. Machines to transport and handle such large weights do not exist today. This paper conceives and analyzes all practical devices that could be used, and identifies the most economical mode for delivering these motors through the logistic cycle from fac- tory to launch. Specifically exam- ined are pneumatic tire, crawler, and Hovair transporters, cranes, and barges, and associated buildings, roads, and docks. Also discussed is the cost of the logistic system for an assumed program. 650122 (1001D) Fusible Link. R. Pribish, Chrysler Corp. This pa- per discusses a new method of pro- tecting the automobile main food cir- cuit by the use of conventional wiring in the form of a fusible link. The new system is shown to be commer- cially practical and economically fea- sible. The fusible link has been in- troduced on all 1965 Chrysler Corp. cars. 650123 (1007A) Project Manage- ment - General Purpose Vehi- cles. Col. F. L. Havel, Army Mo- bility Command. New managerial procedures which emerged as a result of the U. S. Army reorganization in August 1962, were drastic departures from the traditional "chain of com- mand" management previously em- ployed. One of the most far reach- ing changes made along these lines was the appointment of project man- agers, each in full control of a par- ticular high dollar item important to the overall defense posture. One such class of specifically managed projects is general purpose vehicles. Through the employment of management prac- tices pioneered by this project man- agership, considerable savings to the Government were achieved. 650133 (946A) Influence of the Domestic and European Situa- tion on the Production Problems of Italian Automotive Industry. N. Morello, Fiat S.p.Az. This paper discusses the extent of automotive manufacturing organization and fa- cilities of leading European compa- nies and how American industry has influenced the types of manufacturing methods and equipment. A review of problems confronting the Italian automotive industry, represented chiefly by Fiat, is given, including the effect of governmental fiscal policies on car sales and wage rates. Finally, prospects for the automotive industry are outlined on the basis of recent years, output trends and of the poten- tial purchasing power of the domestic and international markets. 78</page><page sequence="18">650134-650139 650134 (948A) Aerodynamic Ef- fects on Automotive Components. M. W. Dawley, Chrysler Corp. The range of automotive components which are affected by airflow around the car is surveyed, with examples of the application of aerodynamic knowl- edge to brake and engine cooling, wind noise, dirt accumulation, wiper lift, body ventilation and air leakage. Air pressure distribution patterns over an automobile are shown along with airflow visualization techniques. 650135 (948B) Some Considera- tions of Automobile Lift and Drag. J. J. Cornish III, Mississippi State Univ. This paper presents the drag of automobiles in comparison to that of various ideal shapes, and the factors contributing to this drag are examined. It is shown that rough estimates of automobile drag coeffi- cients can be made from an analysis of the shapes of the vehicles. The problem of automobile lift is also dis- cussed from the standpoint of shape, proximity to ground, and boundary layer development. 650136 (948E) Effect of Unsym- metrical Wind Incidence on Aero- dynamic Forces Acting on Ve- hicle Models and Similar Bodies. R. Barth, Stuttgart Technical College. Unless conditions happen to be wind- less or unless wind direction is par- allel with the vehicle course, the wind acting on a vehicle will approach from a variety of angles relative to the longitudinal axis. This unsymmetri- cal incidence causes an aerodynamic force which is generally applied at some distance from the center of grav- ity and thereby also sets up a moment. As far as directional stability is con- cerned, it is the component acting transversely to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and its moment about the vertical axis which are of special interest. Accidents in which there are no technical defects or negligence on the driver's part to account for the vehicle leaving the road at high speed can, in many cases, definitely be at- tributed to the action of strong, gusty side winds, and to the unstable prop- erties of the vehicle shape. From this it is concluded that the effect of side wind merits examination not only in regard to racing and sports cars, but also mass produced models. Fundamental wind tunnel investiga- tions of rectangular objects and ve- hicle models are intended to throw light on these phenomena. This paper discusses vehicle model tests and the action of stabilizing fins, the effect of Reynolds number, and measurements of pressure distribu- tion. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650137 (950A) Engineering Ed- ucation - Cooperative Style. H. P. Rodes, General Motors Inst. The cooperative engineering program at General Motors Institute consists of alternating periods of classroom study and work in divisions of General Mo- tors Corp.

Salé, Institut Francais du Pétrole. In France there are two types of institutions of higher scientific education: the Faculties of Science and the "Grandes Écoles." The former train researchers and teachers, and the latter train cadres for industry. In order to train spe- cialists for the Petroleum and Auto- motive Industries, the Institut Fran- cias du Pétrole (French Petroleum Institute) extends its recruiting of students for the École Nationale Su- périeure du Pétrole et des Moteurs (Higher National School of Petro- leum and Engines) over and beyond these two traditional types of training. Its educational doctrine is based on the necessity of providing fundamen- tal knowledge as the only way of suc- cessfully tackling present-day and fu- ture problems. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650139 (951D) Modern Analyti- cal Techniques to Establish Real- istic Crankcase Drains. K. A. Frassa, R. K. Siegfriedt, and C. A. Houston, Mobil Oil Co. This paper presents two new test methods for used gasoline engine oil analyses. The differential infrared analysis pro- cedure permits rapid identification of inherent chemical changes in the used oil as well as amount and nature of foreign contaminants. The mem- brane filtration procedure measures the quantity of insolubles on various pore size filters. The application of these new techniques shows that these methods predict engine deposit for- mation and can be used to establish realistic crankcase drains. The pres- ent conventional used-oil analysis methods are shown to have serious shortcomings. These new test meth- ods are currently being applied in field tests covering gasoline and diesel engine trucks as well as railroad die- sel equipment. Discussion: W. W.

Moore, Shell Intl. Petroleum Co., Ltd.; and A. W. Evans, Shell Res. Ltd. Gaso- line and operating factors affecting the vapor locking tendency of Euro- pean cars have been studied. Three different test procedures were em- ployed: one, similar to the CRC pro- cedure, was shown by a consumer reaction test to induce vapor lock at ambient temperatures at least 11 F lower than required in normal ser- vice. The variation in vapor locking tendency for cars of a given make and model had a standard deviation of 0.61 lb Rvp. The tendency of a gasoline to give vapor lock was pre- dicted better by a combination of Rvp and front end slope than by some other volatility expressions. Discussion: C. F. Bona, Fiat Motor Co.; F.

R. R. Gay, Army Tank Automotive Center. The mili- tary problem of rapidly transporting 60 ton payloads over existing road networks in all parts of the world has yet to be solved. This paper presents a review of past history of transport- ers, both production models and de- velopment efforts. The basic mis- sions of the vehicles are explained and the major requirements are re- viewed. Several new and unique concepts for heavy transporters are presented. 650143 (961E) Military, Tactical, Eight-by-Eight Trucks. L. S. Moore, Army Tank Automotive Cen- ter. Tactical trucks are trucks that can travel where the conventional commercial trucks are immobilized by adverse terrain conditions and, for military use, must be able to with- stand misuse, abuse, and neglect, yet still perform their mission. The eight-by-eight configuration evolved from the mobility requirements. Swimming capability, with payload, is a new requirement met by the trucks, 2 ton, 8x8, XM410E1 and 5-ton, 8x8 XM656. Curtailment of military personnel has resulted in the availability of less maintenance and supply support. Consequently, these new 8 X 8's have been designed for a minimum of maintenance by using very durable components, sealed units, and lubed-for-life-bearings. 650144 (967B) Road Knock Oc- currence in Japan. K. Uchinuma and K. Nakajima, Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. A limited field survey was con- ducted to determine whether full- throttle acceleration from low engine speed is suitable for road knock tests of fuels in manual-transmission Japa- nese cars. Varying knock levels, fuels, cars, and drives were used on a route typical of average Japanese driving. Knock did occur most fre- quently during full-throttle accelera- tion from low engine speed. Part throttle knock was encountered, also. Maximum octane-number require- ments of four Japanese cars were measured and were as high or higher at 2 in. Hg manifold vacuum as at full throttle. Four typical Japanese fuels were rated in the cars at both throttle settings. These tests indi- cated that fuel segregation may be important at both full and part throt- tle. 650145 (970C) Pneumatic Tire Hydroplaning and Some Effects on Vehicle Performance. W. B. Home and U. T. Joyner, Langley Res. Center, NASA. Pneumatic tire hy- droplaning is described and related research and facilities are reviewed. Included are results from studies of conditions in the wet tire footprint area, a discussion of the influence of significant variables, and some effects of tire hydroplaning on vehicle per- formance. It is shown that present tire tread design techniques and pave- ment surface treatment can substan- tially alleviate hydroplaning effects on pneumatic tires over most vehicle operating speed ranges when the pavement is wet or slightly flooded. The results also show that when pave- ments are deeply flooded, neither the best tire tread design nor the best pavement surface treatment can pre- vent hydroplaning at the critical hy- droplaning speed; however, the use of air jets to remove fluid from the pavement in front of the tire shows promise as a means of alleviating hy- droplaning under this condition. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650146 (970D) Fleeting Tire Footprint. J. H. Cox, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The new ASTM- E17 Specification on the Standard Pavement Skid Test Tire is explained, along with examples of how the stan- dard tire is used today. Traction characteristics of the fire footprint and the adhesion - hysteresis concept of the mechanism of rubber friction is discussed. Examination of wet pavement traction test data, covering different designs and compounds on a wide range of road surfaces, dis- close that the basic road surface is far more important than any varia- tion in design or compound. 80</page><page sequence="20">650147-650153 650147 (971A) Ultrasonic Mate- rial Processing. L. Balamuth, Cavitron Ultrasonics, Inc. This pa- per presents a digest of recent work on metal deformation with the aid of high frequency vibratory energy, with explanatory material calculated to bring unity into the diversity of the many areas which are opening up. The work which is going on bears on three important areas of metal defor- mation, namely, wire drawing and material extrusion, forming from sheet metal, and forging. It has been found, for example, that for a suffi- ciently high injection of sonic energy, substantial softening of metals may be reached with consequent increased deforming capability. As long as the sonic waves have low amplitude, no irreversible changes are found in physical properties of metals after acoustic irradiation. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650148 (974B) Some Recent Re- sults Concerning the Reduction of Pollution by the Stratified Charge I.F.P. Process. J. Baudry, Institut Francais du Pétrole. This paper describes the reduction in ob- served unburned exhaust products when a spark ignition engine is op- erated with the I.F.P. process of vari- able mixture strength. The principle of the process is first explained; then the influence of the mixture strength on carbon monoxide and hydrocar- bons in exhaust gases is shown. A comparison of normal carburetion processes and I.F.P. process, based on a stratification of the intake gases, shows how the extension towards the lean mixtures of the limit of the mix- ture strength results in the reduction of unburned products in the exhaust gases.

H. Drell, Lockheed- California Co. A design evaluation is presented for four different propul- sion system approaches for a Direct Support Fighter in the 15,000 to 20,- 000 pound class. This includes three different arrangements for composite lift engine and main propulsion ar- rangements and one lift fan and wing arrangement. For a given payload range the factors considered are take- off weight, performance under single engine failure conditions, STOL per- formance, and cost. The results in- dicate that vectoring the cruise engine for lift is not necessarily optimum. V/STOL vehicles can be designed to sustain altitude after a single engine failure, for a small weight penalty. Reducing the number of lift engines has an insignificant effect on overall weapon system cost. 650151 (977A) Glass Fiber Rein- forced Rubber Products. A. Marzocchi and R. G. Henderson, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. The introduction of glass as a reinforce- ment for mechanical rubber goods for automotive applications repre- sents another milestone in the ever expanding uses of glass. This new- old material has basic properties which offer the engineer a new dimen- sion. Fiberglas reinforced tires will permit the automotive design engi- neer a greater flexibility in design of suspension systems since they offer stabilized tire characteristics which do not change with conditions of use. This paper covers the status of the development program aimed at the introduction of glass as a tire rein- forcement. 650152 (977C) Properties of a Propylene Oxide Rubber. D. A. Meyer and E. E. Gruber, General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. This paper describes the properties of a new rubber de- rived from propylene oxide and an unsaturated epoxide. Exceptional low temperature flexibility, excellent ozone resistance and moderate oil re- sistance are combined in this rubber with good heat resistance and flex fatigue resistance. Potential applica- tions include motor mounts, body mounts, windshield wiper blades, boots, hose and tubing, and various suspension system parts. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650153 (982A) Twin-I-Beam, A Unique Truck Independent Front Suspension. J. E. Heywood, G. H. Muller, and M. L. Jurosek, Ford Mo- tor Co. This paper discusses the new independent front suspension used in the 1965 Ford Light Trucks. The selection of the Twin-I-Beam concept is discussed against a background of desirable suspension objectives. For each objective the new suspension provides an optimum means of attain- ment. Design implementation of this new concept was attended by an exceptional increase in stringency of qualification criteria. Satisfaction of these criteria within Program cost and time constraints, required use of the most efficient techniques of en- vironmental measurement, testing and design. Specific examples of innova- 81</page><page sequence="21">650154-650160 tive areas are: Load determination over long routes using FM tape re- cording and automatic data process- ing, fatigue testing of systems in pref- erence to only component testing, extreme attention to correlation of laboratory and track testing and ex- tensive use of plastic models for rapid stress analysis of alternate design proposals.

This paper is concerned with "low aspect ratio" passenger car tires, the development and testing program prior to their acceptance for general use, and the overall characteristics of these tires from a vehicle manufac- turer's standpoint. The paper presents a general re- view of the evolution of the pneumatic tire, and the importance of the tire/ vehicle system approach in solving tire/ wheel and chassis development problems. The paper also gives a brief report of the progress being made to establish uniform, industry- wide standards for tires, and for rim uniformity grading machines. 650155 (984A) 1965 Ford Trac- tor Engine Family. P. A. Martel, Ford Motor Co. An integrated series of 3-cyl and 4-cyl gasoline and diesel engines have been developed for Ford tractors. Gross engine hp ranges from 39 to 65, déplacement from 158 to 233 cu in. Compression ratio of the gasoline versions is 8/1 and of the diesel versions 16.5/1. The gen- eral objectives were as follows: (1) One engine family for world-wide usage, presenting maximum inter- changeability of parts; (2) Both diesel and gasoline models to be avail- able, without sacrificing the basic re- quirements of one type to those of the other; (3) Optimum fuel economy bearing comparison to all competi- tors; (4) Extreme durability, extend- ing the life expectancy of our tractor engines to 6000 hr, with allowance made for replacement only of service- able components such as bearings and rings at 3000 hr; (5) Longer ser- vice intervals amounting to a twice yearly schedule covering such minor items as filters, generator brushes, points and spark plugs; (6) Poten- tial for future increases in displace- ment and performance. 650156 (984B) New Diesels for John Deere-Lanz. S. A. Olsen, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Wks., Deere Mfg. Co. This paper points out the design highlights and perform- ance features of two small displace- ment diesel engines designed primar- ily for tractor use. The description of the 152 cu in. (2.49 liter) 3-cyl and 202 cu in. (3.33 liter) 4-cyl engines shows a maximum interchangeability of parts and the use of common man- ufacturing equipment. Development tests indicate low fuel consumption, high torque reserve, and good cold weather starting ability. 650157 (985B) Importance of Material Surfaces to the Engi- neer. J. E. Field, Cambridge Univ. (England). Several material prop- erties, which are important to the en- gineer, and which depend on the physical condition of surfaces are dis- cussed. Recent experimental work involving surfaces is described. The asperity model for surfaces, which is basic to modern ideas of friction and conductance, is first considered, and it is shown that by measuring the distributions of the number, height and radii of asperities it is possible to evaluate the nature and size of con- tact for various surface loads. The effect of microdefects on the strength of glasses and their removal by etch- ing is described. The behavior of glasses is compared with that of hard polymers such as lucite, and it is shown that the distribution of defects in lucite, unlike that in glasses, occurs almost equally throughout the bulk as well as at the surface. Finally the property a surface has as a "free boundary" in stress wave propagation is considered with particular refer- ence to the fracture behavior of brit- tle solids in plate form. 650158 (989A) Service Operator Reviews the Transition of Per- sonalized Executive Air Travel to the Jet Age. B. F. Prusek and K. W. Schoening, AiResearch Service Co.

A service operator reviews the increased technical tasks associ- ated with this new generation of air- craft. Avionics, systems, and fuse- lage interiors have all undergone a change commensurate with the ad- vancing state of the art. 650159 (989D) Future of the Allison 250 Engine. J. M. Wetz- ler, Allison Div., GMC. The Allison Model 250 small aircraft gas turbine engines is briefly described and the development and field experience highlights are discussed. Recent de- velopment effort is outlined on engine response time, sand and dust toler- ance, cost reduction, performance growth, regeneration, and augmenta- tion. Variations of the free-turbine engine for a wider variety of applica- tions have been studied. Perform- ance of the 250 engine in fixed-wing commercial aircraft is compared with that of existing piston engines. 650160 (991A) Interstate High- way System Super Transport Truck. C. F. Maddox and J. G. Mc- Quaid, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes the design and construction of an experimental super transport truck for high-speed, long-distance freight hauling on the interstate high- way system of the 1970's. The trac- tor, powered by a 600-hp gas turbine 82</page><page sequence="22">650161-650166 engine, pulls two 40-ft tandem axle trailers at a G.C.W. of 170,000 lbs. One of the features of the super trans- port truck is the cab, which is de- signed for long-distance, nonstop, 2- man operation. It is provided with sleeping accommodations, washroom conveniences, food facilities, and a complete heating and air-conditioning system. The 13-ft high cab room is flush with the top of the trailers, pro- viding a substantial aerodynamic ad- vantage. Other features and compo- nents of the truck are described, and observations made during the 5500 mile national tour are discussed. 650161 (992A) Trends in Hy- draulics in European Mobile Equipment. R. G. Peach, Ham- worthy Hydraulics Ltd. The paper discusses development of the mobile equipment industry in Europe since 1946, and the resulting development of hydraulic equipment required for the actuation of larger, faster, and more efficient and reliable machines, and traces the emergence of manu- facturers specializing in hydraulics for these applications. Pumps, valves, and associated equipment in common use are illustrated and de- scribed briefly with notes on their de- velopment. Machines of various types are illustrated and described with circuit diagrams and analyses of the hydraulic systems of each, includ- ing crawler excavators, a backhoe, side-loader, truckmixer, concrete layer, and mobile crane. The paper concludes with a summary of prob- able future developments in hydrau- lics for mobile equipment applica- tions. 650162 (992B) European Farm Tractor Design. R. Brohm, John Deere-Lanz A.G. This paper de- scribes the progress and status of the European farm tractor design. It provides a broad picture of the re- quirements and of the economical and political factors which affected the design concept during the last 10 years and led to the present advanced farm tractor design. It concludes that there is little difference between the U.S. and European farm tractor design today because functional fea- tures, optional and special equipment are comparable with the exception of differences in legal requirements and tractor sizes. It can be expected that future U.S. and European develop- ment work on advanced features will coincide to a great extent. 650163 (995B) Chrome Plated ABS - A Breakthrough for the Automotive Industry. J. B. Mc- Namara and B. J. Sexton, Borg-War- ner Corp., Marbon Chemical Div. This paper describes a reliable bond- ing method for metal-plating plastics to be used for functional and decora- tive automotive parts. It examines the previous obstacles to achieving the long life adhesive properties neces- sary for commercial acceptance, the properties of plastics and metals, and the conditions under which these ma- terials show remarkable stability. Methods are described in detail and tables show the characteristics deter- mined by study and experiment in developing this new product. 650164 (999B) International Profile of Fleet Maintenance Practices and Equipment. J. K. Van Denburg, McGraw-Hill, Inc. There are more commercial motor ve- hicles abroad than there are in the United States, there are more com- mercial vehicles being manufactured abroad than there are here, and the commercial vehicle exports of foreign countries far exceed those of the United States. This paper reports on the maintenance activities, mainte- nance equipment, and parts purchas- ing patterns of 150 motor vehicle fleets in 32 foreign countries. 650165 (1000A) Noise of Auto- motive Diesel Engines : Its Causes and Reduction. A. E. W. Austen, CAV Ltd. ; and T. Priede, Southamp- ton Univ. A twelve year investiga- tion of diesel engine noise due to combustion, particularly in the high- frequency range, has indicated that changes in engine structure can achieve substantial reductions in noise. Test results obtained at the Research Laboratory of CAV Ltd. showed that the predominant noise in diesel engines of automotive size is produced by the rapid pressure rise resulting from combustion. Work directed toward "smoothing" the cyl- inder pressure is still in progress. At the same time, it has been determined that two forms of engine structure could improve structural attenuation. They consist of a separate load-carry- ing structure with attached highly damped outer walls and a construc- tion of great bending stiffness cast in low density material such as magne- sium.

Mac- Kay, Eitra Corp., Prestolite Div. Regulator voltage settings are a key to good electrical performance on most vehicles. The most important function, however, is that the regu- lator control the charging voltage to the battery. By keeping the battery at a proper charge, the entire electri- cal system will operate at maximum efficiency, assuming that other com- ponents of the electrical system are properly designed, properly pro- tected, and properly maintained. This paper discusses the need for bet- ter regulator settings, and includes recommendations for proper settings and how these values were obtained. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 83</page><page sequence="23">650167-650174 650167 (lOOlB) Advancing the Spark in Mexico's Automotive Electrical Industry. R. R. Lange and V. M. Barreiro, Ford Motor Co. S.A. Mexico is currently engaged in a major expansion of its automotive industry. The objective of the gov- ernment decree regulating this indus- try is that the automotive companies achieve a minimum of 60% local content, calculated on percentage of vehicle cost, within strict time limita- tions. The automotive electrical in- dustry in Mexico is playing a major role in reaching this required local content. This paper outlines some of the current activities of this industry and those of one of the major auto- mobile companies cooperating with the various suppliers. 650168 (1001C) Wiring: Past, Present, and Future. R. L. Simp- kins, R. H. Publow, and R. B. Young, Essex Wire Corp. This is a three part paper. The first part traces the growth of wiring from early days, through current and possible future trends. The second part traces igni- tion cable design from the past up to date. Some of the problems encoun- tered in today's ignition cable are pointed out and solutions are offered. A new magnetic core, suppressor type, ignition cable using a metal conduc- tor is described.

This paper reviews the sources and causes of gas turbine noise. Intake noise characteristics of different types of small gas turbines are discussed. Sound pressure level criteria is rec- ommended for the protection of oper- ating personnel and for avoiding neighboring noise complaints. The paper summarizes the development of the Donasonic intake silencer and its possible integration with air cleaning techniques - resulting is a significant space and weight saving. Conven- tional methods of controlling intake noise are also discussed. Combined air cleaner-silencer induction systems, stressing compact size and light weight, are described including test data from actual applications. 650170 (1002B) Gas Turbine Ex- haust Noise and Its Attenuation. L. S. Wirt, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona. This paper describes and illustrates the extensive research into gas turbine noise. This study has led to a better understanding of noise generating sources and transmission processes. Also described is the de- velopment of new high-temperature erosion-resistant acoustic materials. These materials led to the evolution of new exhaust noise silencers for on- board transport aircraft and for si- lencing ground support installations. Discussion: G. M. Backes, International Harvester Co. ; K. W . Porter, Boeing Co. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650171 (1003B) Human Toler- ance to Impact - Basis for Safety Design. L. M. Patrick, Wayne State Univ. Fundamental principles of crash safety are discussed from a qualitative and quantitative engineer- ing viewpoint. Categories of impact injury, together with the passenger compartment injury-producing com- ponents, are presented. Techniques used for establishing measurable pa- rameters of injury utilizing live anes- thetized animals, cadavers, human volunteers, and anthropomorphic dummies are outlined. Several types of experimental impact devices are evaluated with limitations and ad- vantages of each listed. Human im- pact tolerance levels based on mea- surable physical quantities, such as force or acceleration, are recom- mended with values given for fore- head impact. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650172 (1004B) Why Disc Brakes? F. E. Lueck, Ford Motor Co. A family of disc brake systems, capable of braking vehicles with gvw's from 3000 lb to 6000 lb, has been developed and is released on the 1965 Lincoln and Thunderbird with power brakes as standard equipment, and on the 1965 Mustang with man- ual brake as an option. These sys- tems, while retaining the desirable characteristics of current drum brake systems, provide significant perform- ance advantages in the areas of fade resistance, stability and serviceability. The disc brake systems, as released on the Ford products, consist of a ventilated rotor, in conjunction with a fixed, multiple-piston caliper utiliz- ing segmental brake linings. Duo- servo rear brakes are used with a hy- draulic proportioning valve which compensates for the non-linear rear brake output. 650173 (1005B) Evolution of Four-Stroke Diesel Engines with Light Alloy Blocks for Heavy- Duty Trucks. M. Serdá Torello, Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones, S.A. This paper describes the cul- mination of 16 years work directed toward the development of a 6-cyl, 4- stroke, direct- injection diesel engine with a light alloy block for applica- tion in heavy trucks. The resulting increase in power and improvements adopted are discussed, with special emphasis on the cylinder block and related problems. In conclusion, the importance of using a light alloy block, when the chief interest is in ob- taining engines of high power/ weight ratio and long life, is pointed out. 650174 (SP-259) Engineering Principles of Weight Equalizing and Sway Resistant Hitches. T. J. Reese, Reese Products, Inc. This paper reviews briefly the history of the use and development of hitches. Two basic engineering principles dis- cussed are weight equalizing and 84</page><page sequence="24">650175-650180 sway resistance of hitches. Also analyzed are stresses to the car and trailer under varying conditions, as well as developments in hitches to overcome these shortcomings. In its present state major towing problems have been successfully solved by proper hitch designs. With the correct size hitch for the tongue weight of the trailer properly in- stalled, anyone who drives a car can tow a trailer. 650175 (SP 259) Trailer Towing - A Challenge Accepted. J. R. O'Brien, Chrysler Corp. This paper investigates the many facets of trailer towing undertaken at the Chrysler Engineering Proving Grounds. Areas delved into are temperature and structural effects on the car, as well as ride and handling of the car while towing a trailer. Findings have led Chrysler to extend its "5 and 50" war- ranty to cover a car towing a trailer if the trailer is within defined weight limits for the car chosen and the car is equipped with the proper towing package as recommended by Chrys- ler. 650176 (SP 259) Travel Trailer Design and Construction - How It Relates to Towability. W. Korn, Airstream, Inc. This paper discusses the six design parameters which have most effect on trailer tow- ing characteristics. Effects of weight, balance, center of gravity, suspension system, aerodynamics, and construc- tion or rigidity of both the chassis and body shell are evaluated in terms of trailer towability. An important consideration is that regardless of how well a trailer is designed, its abil- ity to be towed effectively is depen- dent on the tow vehicle as well as on the type of hitch that is used. 650177 (SP-260) The Highway Truck Ride Problem. W. F. Le Fevre, White Motor Co. This paper discusses the improvement of truck ride, chiefly concerned with driver and passenger comfort related to road condition. It describes the kinds of natural vibrations in vehicles which determine the quality of ride, and the sources of forces, both outside and within the vehicle in operation, which initiate the vibrations and establish their magnitude of motion. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650178 (SP-260) Trailer Ride Effect on Tractor and Cargo. E. Chosy, Fruehauf Trailer Div., Frue- hauf Corp. New suspension springs offer the possibility of eliminating severe tractor pitch in a vehicle com- bination. Experience shows that, in some cases, reducing semitrailer sus- pension frequencies will accomplish this. Test data also covers the ride effect of semitrailer suspension on cargo and tractor cab. Effect on cargo at three points in open top van semi- trailer and tractor cab is covered. 650179 (SP-260) Frame Beam- ing, Fifth Wheel Location, Spe- cial Body Mounting and Loading Problems. A. R. Smith, Ford Mo- tor Co. The effects of frame beam- ing, fifth wheel location, special body mounting, and variable loading con- ditions on tandem truck and tractor ride characteristics are discussed. Some of the conclusions reached in this study are: If driver discomfort, due to frame beaming, is to be avoided, it is necessary to provide sufficient frame stiffness to avoid high amplitude frame vibrations. Where frame beaming is a decisive factor on a specific ride complaint, it can most efficiently be corrected by the addition of either a partial or full glove reinforcement to the siderails, extending from the rear spring front hanger as far forward as possible. The location of the kingpin must be an acceptable location which satisfies the following requirements : (a) Legal overall length limits with equipment to be used, (b) Sufficient kingpin offset to transfer adequate kingpin load to the front suspension to insure good front suspension performance and small enough to avoid the adverse affects of frame beaming and "strike- through." The use of special bodies or equipment is a factor in straight truck operations only, where extended wheelbases, long rear over-hang, or off-road operations are encountered. These conditions tend to increase the imposed bending moments acting on the frame, and these bending mo- ments, to a great degree, govern frame deflection characteristics. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650180 (SP-260) Drive Train In- fluence on Truck Tandem Ride. W. T. Trisler, Dana Corp.; and W. E. Rice, Rockwell-Standard Corp. Modern high-speed highway systems have made it necessary to improve the ride when tandem axles are in- cluded in a drive train system. This has called for an evaluation of new ideas concerning tandem axle suspen- sions, such as presented in this paper. Improving the ride will also require reduction of noise and light vibra- tions, so often ignored in highway trucks. This need for less noise and vibration will mean that greater con- sideration must be given to such fac- tors as: (1) Universal joint operating angles; (2) Support mounting char- acteristics, including axle, transmis- sion, auxiliary transmissions and axle mounts, as well as support bearing mountings; (3) Propeller shaft run- out and balance; (4) Concentricity of output and input shafts as well as their support flanges; (5) Slip spline construction and resulting forces; (6) Handling and shipping; (7) Ser- vice and maintenance instructions. 85</page><page sequence="25">650181-650188 650181 (SP-260) Elimination of Truck Cab Vibration Induced by Torque Variations of a Six Cyl- inder Diesel. D. F. Stimeling, Mack Trucks, Inc. This case history explains a practical test procedure which led to the successful solution of a cab vibration problem through the development of a new engine front mounting arrangement. It also sub- stantiates the importance of consider- ing the dynamic properties of mate- rials used in vibration isolation. The new engine mount provided the re- quired freedom for transverse vibra- tory displacement of the engine, thereby keeping much of the engine vibration out of the frame rails and the cab. 650182 (SP-260) Importance of Dynamic Testing of Elastomers. R. S. Auda and R. M. Cardillo, Enjay Labs. Certain dynamic methods of testing enable the characteristics of elastomeric materials for vibration control in terms of engineering data obtained on full-sized vehicle parts. These dynamic methods are discussed along with several of the traditional rubber test methods currently used in specifying rubber. The discus- sion emphasizes the usefulness and limitations of the various test meth- ods. Comparisons are made with different elastomers and rubber com- pounds showing how the more so- phisticated dynamic tests can detect behavior differences, whereas the tra- ditional test methods would have in- dicated equivalencies. Also, data are shown that correlate actual ride eval- uation with dynamic test results. 650183 (SP-260) Summary - Chassis Effects on Tandem Ride. R. N. Janeway, Janeway Engrg. Co. Special difficulties seem to confront the designers of truck tractors and semitrailers who face the question - how can we coordinate the suspen- sions of two separate but intercon- nected vehicles when each of them is going to be paired with a wide variety of mating vehicles? The analytical approach can anticipate the effects of any combination of suspension condi- tions. The basic method is to reduce the overall tractor-trailer system to a relatively simple equivalent form. In this way, all of the vehicle conditions can be correlated and their resultant ride effects quickly evaluated. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650184 (SP-260) Enveloping Characteristics of Truck Tires, A Laboratory Evaluation. S. A. Lippmann, W. A. Piccin, and T. P. Baker, United States Rubber Tire Co. This paper describes the enveloping properties of truck tires as consisting of two components of force, one in the vertical direction and another in the direction of travel. The re- sponses to irregular surfaces are mathematically accountable in terms of the response to a step in pavement elevation. Tires may therefore be readily characterized in general through their reactions to step func- tions. Curves display the differences in enveloping properties available in the 10.00-20 size on the open market. Discussion: B. D. Van Heusen and S. H. Backaitis, Chrysler Corp. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650185 (SP-260) Ride Character- istics of Wide Base Tires. R. P. Powers and W. E. Moore, Jr., Fire- stone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The rela- tively new wide base tire has a num- ber of distinct advantages over duals. One of these, improved ride, is dis- cussed. Data taken under static con- ditions shows the spring rate for the wide base tire to be substantially less than for duals under fully loaded con- ditions with less difference appearing under lightly loaded conditions. This, it is believed, partly explains the tire behavior as it relates to im- pact absorption and bounce under dy- namic loaded conditions wherein an exaggerated bump condition is intro- duced and also over rough concrete, the data shows greater impact absorp- tion for the wide base tires than for duals. 650186 (SP-260) Effect of Tire Uniformity on Ride - Wide Base and Regular Truck Tires. D. H. Carson, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The uniformity characteristics of wide base and conventional truck tires are established and the effects on ride of unbalance and radial runout in both types of tires are evaluated. Tire profile relationship - aspect ratio -is related to ride characteristics to establish the directional influence of a change in tire profile on vehicle ride. 650187 (SP-260) Factors Af- fecting Performance of Hubs, Drums, Wheels and Rims on Truck Tractors and Trailers. W. C. Long, Firestone Steel Products Co., Div., Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.

Current values and practices are shown along with hitherto unpublished data from major U.S. manufacturers. Discussion: B. D. Van Heusen and S. H. Backaitis, Chrysler Corp. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650188 (SP-260) Discussion of Effects of Tires on Tandem Truck Ride and Vibration Prob- lems. S. H. Backaitis and B. D. Van Deusen, Chrysler Corp. Vehicle dy- namics might be defined as the study and analysis of vehicle motions as they are affected by controlled inputs or random environmental perturba- tions. These motions are usually subdivided into the three areas of ride, handling and performance. In each of these areas the tire is a prime factor and has been a source of con- stant frustration since a complete mathematical description of the tire and the road-tire interface has never been successfully achieved. The pur- pose of making a tire measurement is twofold. First we must try to un- derstand and interpret the behavior of a pneumatic tire. Second we must devise models of the tire to transform 86</page><page sequence="26">650189-650195 our understanding of its behavior into design parameters which will al- low construction of tires to give more nearly optimum vehicle performance. Investigation of this problem is not new and constant progress has been reported over the last two decades. 650189 (SP-262) Dynamic Char- acteristics of Truck Driveline Systems. P. J. Mazziotti, Dana Corp. This paper reviews the func- tions, construction, and operating characteristics of truck driveline sys- tems. It shows the various types of universal joint-propeller shaft con- structions used in a wide range of ap- plications. There is discussion of conventional considerations, constant velocity joints, wheel drive installa- tions, and others. The dynamic characteristics are studied as to how they affect and are affected by the en- tire vehicle drive train. Experience factors are shown to establish prac- tical engineering guide limitations. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650190 Metal Forming by Elec- trical Energy Release - Trends and Applications. K. F. Smith, General Dynamics/Fort Worth. The evaluation of electrohydraulic and electromagnetic forming at General Dynamics/Fort Worth is discussed. Particular attention is given to cur- rent trends and applications of the two processes at GD/FW. Parts formed by EHF and EMF ranging in sizes from % in. diameter to 8^ in. diameter are described. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650192 Electrohydraulic Form- ing in Aerospace Applied to the Automotive Industry. L. M. Brown, Cincinnati Shaper Co. Use of the electro-hydraulic effect for metal forming is one of the significant advances in the high-energy-rate field. The Cincinnati Electroshape method of converting electrical energy to hy- draulic energy by discharging a high voltage spark across a transducer un- der water provides new production capability. This paper describes the Electroshape and discusses how new transducer developments provide an economic manufacturing method. Specific parts and related tooling problems are presented. Economic application of the electro-hydraulic effect to various parts and production rates are considered. The possibility of new quality standards and in- creased design flexibility are dis- cussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650193 Helicopters and Propel- ler-Type VTOL Aircraft in the Light of Technologies. W. Z. Stępniewski and M. I. Young, Boeing Co., Vertol Div. Pure and com- pound helicopters (including those with stoppable or stowable rotors) as well as propeller-type VTOLs are ex- amined regarding their possibilities and limitations resulting from aero- dynamics and structures. Trends in effective lift-to-drag ratio with flying speed and agility are discussed, along with other performance items. Aero- elastic, dynamic and structural as- pects of rotary wing aircraft are considered and specific limitations due to those phenomena indicated. An interplay between design concepts and gross and empty weights is illus- trated by the example of operations reflecting a combat type mission. The totality of these considerations indicates that a 200-knot pure heli- copter is feasible with the possibility of not exceeding cyclic stress and vibration levels of contemporary 150- knot helicopters. However, the ef- fective lift-to-drag ratio at speeds of about 200 knots would be quite low. Compounding improves lift-to-effec- tive drag ratio at such speeds slightly and moves the various aeroelastic barriers, up to speeds of 250 knots. However, this leads to higher gross and empty weights. Simple stopping of rotors brings little improvement in the speed and range capabilities at the expense of still higher weights. Folding is more promising as far as the performance is concerned, and gross and empty weight penalties are no higher than in stopping. Retrac- tion of the rotor improves aerody- namic cleanness to the levels of pro- peller type VTOL (tilt wing) aircraft, but weight penalties are the highest. Because of its superior performance, high level of agility and absence of fundamental aeroelastic limitations,' the tilt wing type is seen to be out- standing for the combat type missions considered. 650194 Research and Develop- ment of the Stowed Rotor V/STOL Concept. R. D. Leoni and T. T. Kaplita, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. This paper reviews the development of the Sikorsky stowed rotor concept for high speed V/STOL aircraft from its conception in 1949 to the present. The philosophy behind this concept is discussed along with its significant advantages and major problem areas. New design approaches and applica- tion studies of the stowed rotor against current high speed V/STOL missions are described. Results of recent flight simulator studies and wind tunnel tests are presented which confirm the feasibility of this concept. 650195 V/STOL Performance and Stability and Control from an Operations Analysis View- point. P. W. McDavitt, Kaman Air- craft Corp. ; M. V. Ciminera and R. J. Evans, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. This paper considers performance, stability, and control requirements in terms of their in- fluence on the mission effectiveness and program cost of V/STOL weapon systems; hence, their cost-effective- ness. Performance, stability, and control are among the characteristics that determine the size, weight, and complexity of an aircraft, and ulti- mately, therefore, its cost. These factors also affect mission effective- ness by their influence upon the avail- ability and survivability of the air- 87</page><page sequence="27">650196-650201 craft and accuracy of its weapons. "Operations Analysis" techniques are required for combining these interre- lated factors to evaluate cost-effective- ness. An application is presented for an armed tactical support V/STOL aircraft. Three types are compared: pure helicopter, compound helicopter, and tilt wing. 650196 Tailoring the Lift Fan V/STOL Concept to Mission Re- quirements. J. M. Peterson, Ryan Aero. Co. The U.S. Army's XV-5A has demonstrated vertical take-off with "cruise power" only, noncritical tran- sition maneuverability and conver- sions, low fuel consumption, high sub- sonic speeds, and minor ground erosion. In applying the lift fan to specific mission requirements, jet en- gine thrust can be augmented by 200- 400%. Fan installations can be either fan-in-wing, fan-in-fuselage, re- tractable fans, or various combina- tions of these. Comparison studies with other high subsonic and super- sonic V/STOL concepts indicate that the lift fan is competitive on a weight and volume basis and exceeds them with respect to low fuel consumption, minimum ground erosion, and mini- mum development and production time and costs. 650197 Experimental Investiga- tion of Inlet-to-Inlet Shock Inter- ference. D. L. Motyčka and J. B. Murphy, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Div. This report describes the experimental program conducted, and presents wind tunnel test data obtained during the compre- hensive study of supersonic pod to pod inlet interference. This test es- tablished, for a typical Mach 3.0 de- sign mixed compression inlet, the di- viding line between the regions of expelled shock interference and com- pletely stable operation and the total pressure recovery penalty imposed by operating with pod to pod interfer- ence. The penalty required in order to maintain stability during the initial transient of the onset of "buzz" was so severe that it cannot be considered practical. A plate placed between pods was found to be very effective in eliminating the interference penalty. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650198 Inlet Flow Field Studies for the Supersonic Transport. W. A. Reinhart and E. Tjonneland, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. The flow field in which the supersonic inlet op- erates will have important effects on the choice of inlet location, inlet type, and performance. Flow field proper- ties which include the effects of air- plane wing-body interference, wing camber and twist, and downwash from the wing for tail-mounted propulsion pods must be known. A 40 deg con- ical probe was used to map the flow field of two typical SST configuration wind tunnel models -Mach 2.5 and 2.7. It was found that the airplane wing and fuselage act as effective shields or flow straighteners for the inlets. Axisymmetric inlets with par- tial internal compression are shown to be practical in these sheltered flow fields. Inlet performance variations due to airplane maneuvers are esti- mated using the flow field properties measured. 650199 Propulsion Systems Siz- ing Criteria for the Supersonic Transport. H. Drell and E. L. Bragdon, Lockheed-California Co. The propulsion system installed weight has a significant effect on the Supersonic Transport payload. This fact necessitates careful analysis to insure the proper engine size that will meet operational and flexibility re- quirements without undue penalty. Operational and mission requirements which establish engine size are dis- cussed. It is shown that sonic boom, transition altitude, community noise characteristics, and altitude for maxi- mum L/D are the most important siz- ing elements. Trade-offs in each of these parameters are made to deter- mine effects on take-off weight or pay- load. The afterburning turbojet and duct-burning turbofan are shown to be quite competitive in payload and operational characteristics. 650200 Advanced Propeller De- velopments for V/STOL Air- craft. G. Rosen, United Aircraft Corp., Hamilton Standard Div. Ef- fective mission capability of future V/STOL aircraft demands significant propulsion system advancements in lower specific weight, higher specific performance, improved operational reliability, and improved structural in- tegrity. A five year development pro- gram conducted by the propeller in- dustry has resulted in several major design innovations: lightweight blades, integrated propeller and gear- box, variable camber, shrouded pro- pellers, and redundant control sys- tems, of which all are flight qualified and used in two major VTOL aircraft programs, XC-142A and X-22A. This paper reviews these develop- ments, defines their performance, weight, and functional potentials, and describes their current hardware status. 650201 Lift Engine Technology. T. Foster and H. D. Paget, Conti- nental Aviation &amp; Engrg. Corp. The following points, discussed in this paper, should be considered very carefully in all systems contemplating the use of lift engines for VTOL air- craft: 1. The rate of benefit to the aircraft decreases rapidly for engine thrust-to-weight ratios greatly in ex- cess of 20/1; 2. Working relation- ships are available for use in the aeromechanical design phase of high thrust-to-weight ratio engines; 3. The "installed" thrust-to-weight ratio of lift engines is the most important criterion for evaluation of alternative peripheral equipment design con- cepts; 4. The reaction control, thrust 88</page><page sequence="28">650202-650207 vectoring, and induction subsystems contribute most of the degradation of lift engine "installed" thrust-to- weight; 5. The rotating cascade con- cept is the most promising system for deflecting lift engine exhaust flow to achieve both vehicle control and STOL capability; 6. The jetevator, vane deflectors and spherical nozzle concepts are competitive within speci- fied deflection angle ranges ; 7. Scoop- type inlets with movable vanes in the upper surface can be devised to allevi- ate lift engine induction losses; and 8. Significant improvements in the lift engine installed volume can be ob- tained by potimizing the inlet lip and engine vertical location within the fuselage or engine pod. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650202 High Bypass Lift/ Cruise Fan: The State of the Art. W. A. Fasching and F. J. Asmus, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. The results of an investigation of re- mote lift/cruise fans characteristics that appear to fit them for V/STOL aircraft application are summarized here. The effect of varying gas gen- erator parameters and fan bypass ra- tio, pressure ratio, radius ratio, and installed drag coefficients, upon fan weight and performance throughout the subsonic Mach spectrum were studied. Verification of design as- sumptions was obtained in three 1964 wind tunnel test programs; a small scale low pressure ratio exhaust noz- zle research program in the Fluidyne tunnel; a rotating nacelle lift/cruise fan test in the NASA Ames 40 x 80 ft tunnel; and a 36-in. T58 driven cruise fan test in the NASA Langley 16-ft transonic tunnel. The results of these programs are currently being com- bined into a lift/cruise fan demon- strator which is described. This is the state-of-the-art in lift/cruise fans, which may be expected to be devel- oped for the upcoming generation of V/STOL subsonic aircraft. 650203 Propulsive Wing Turbo- fan V/STOL. B. R. Winborn, Jr., Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc. A V/STOL concept has been developed through adherence to a design philosophy of making each decision from the view- point of what is best for the overall airplane rather than for one system, such as propulsion. The acronym, ADAM, standing for ,4 ir Deflection and Modulation, has been applied to this concept. A typical design for a subsonic recce/strike airplane is described in detail and wind tunnel results are discussed. Performance data are given insofar as security classification permits. The airplane is characterized by a high degree of maneuverability and versatility. Ap- plication of the ADAM concept to transport types is treated briefly. 650204 Realizing SST Payloads. N. D. Foiling, Pan Amer. World Air- ways, Inc. The basic objective of the SST is to carry a maximum amount of payload at supersonic speeds at least 4000 miles at minimum cost. This paper discusses various ineffi- ciencies that occur in utilization of space within the airframe which may hinder this objective. Cabin interior arrangement must be realistic and practical. Points to be considered in achieving these goals are presented. Greater emphasis must be placed on the interior arrangement of the SST if the full payload-range-economic capability is to be achieved. 650205 Flight Simulator Utiliza- tion Tor System Design and Pilot Training. W. L. Holladay and A. S. White, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. The use of flight simulation is well established in the development of high-performance air vehicles at North American Aviation, Inc. and its contribution to the suc- cess of a program can hardly be over- estimated. Flight simulator utiliza- tion can be placed in three general classes: (1) as an engineering design tool on which the engineer can eval- uate the performance and safety char- acteristics of the total flight control system or any portion of it. He util- izes the simulator to corroborate his preliminary analyses conducted to ob- tain the initial design requirements verifying the importance of the com- ponent systems characteristics to the system's over-all performance; (2) as a tool for pilot training. The flight simulator, coupled with analog computers which compute the air ve- hicle dynamic motions resulting from control inputs, presents the pilot with the estimated responses of the air ve- hicle. With the flight instruments and visual displays, he is able to "fly" the air vehicle over a complete mis- sion and, probably more important, evaluate the idiosyncrasies of the con- figuration; (3) for demonstration of the air vehicle. A simulator pro- vides a good tool for establishing a common understanding between all persons concerned. The pilot and the engineer can demonstrate to each other characteristics of the air vehicle or control system which are pertinent. The contractor can utilize the simula- tor to demonstrate the air vehicle han- dling and performance to the cus- tomer. Problems and their solutions can be demonstrated, providing an excellent means of communication be- tween those persons involved. The XB-70 simulator was and is still being utilized for all of these. 650207 Air Cargo Handling - As- sociated Ground Support Equip- ment. S. R. Wallace, United Air Lines, Inc. Ground support equip- ment for the DC-8F jet freighter has been developed using a complete anal- ysis of air freight processing on the ground, as well as a study of func- tional requirements for handling of pallets. A systems approach for total dock-to-air-to-dock was employed by United Air Lines to assure speed and efficiency in handling expensive jet aircraft on the ground. This paper covers some of the statistical findings of air freight characteristics and the development of unique ground equip- 89</page><page sequence="29">650208-650213 ment using "off-the-shelf" component parts, assembled to load and unload 10,000 lb pallets in less than 1.5 min- utes each. A description of the O'Hare air freight terminal, which handles more than 20,000,000 lb per month, is included to provide an un- derstanding of total air freight han- dling procedures. 650208 Airport Compatibility with the SST - Problems of Ground Support Equipment. J. F. McDonald, Lockheed-California Co. The compatibility of a super- sonic transport with fifteen interna- tional U.S. - civil airports is examined in the principal areas of: (a) termi- nals, passenger handling and ground support equipment, (b) runway length and pavement strength, and (c) air- port and community noise. It is shown that some new support equip- ment and facilities will be required although they are considered to be evolutionary in nature rather than re- quiring radical departures from cur- rent design. Runways and pavement strengths are shown to be generally acceptable as they exist today. Noise, both in the terminal areas and in the surrounding community is expected to be equivalent to, or less than that of contemporary subsonic jet trans- port aircraft. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650209 Trends in Ground Sup- port Equipment Concepts. A. H. D. Roeser, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. The purpose of this paper is to point out in general terms how ground sup- port equipment has increased in size, quantity, and complexity from ear- liest civil aircraft days to the present, and to extrapolate these trends into the near future. It points out how relationships have developed between airlines, manufacturers, and vendors for design and procurement of equip- ment. It further notes the present status of such equipment and denotes at some length how this equipment will be used and expanded to satisfy the requirements of an SST program. 650210 Probabilistic Design Tools Promise Higher Levels of Initial Reliability. G. Reethof and G. W. Weber, General Elee. Co., Large Jet Engine Dept. The variabilities in the key parameter in the stress- strength relationships of a group of jet engines in their operational en- vironment is discussed, as well as the direct tie of these relationships to the probability of failure during an over- haul period. Two specific examples of the application of reliability tech- niques which have been used in prac- tice are presented in conceptual, non- mathematical terms to illustrate the thought processes, potential impact, and value. The major assumptions and techniques are described as well as the potential pitfalls and difficulties. The results of both studies are pre- sented in a practical manner so that the practical nature and applicability of the techniques is demonstrated. It is concluded that these kinds of re- liability techniques will contribute to the designing for high levels of initial reliability. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650211 Design Procedures for Improving Engine Operating Costs. J. C. Pirtle, General Elee. Co. This paper discusses some de- sign techniques for low gas turbine engine operating costs. These tech- niques are developed to insure long life of major operating components without sacrifice of low weight, high efficiency or operational requirements of the machine. The principle areas covered are new methods to reduce susceptibility to low cycle fatigue, avoid thermal fatigue and reduce susceptibility of turbine hardware to thermal shock. Effects of foreign object damage, mishandling of hard- ware, and manufacturing variations are discussed with attention given to reducing the ill effects caused by these items. Recognitions of and de- sign for repair requirements are dis- cussed as one method to appreciably reduce replacement costs for engine components. It is concluded that al- though the performance requirements are more stringent, the operating en- vironment is more severe and weight requirements are more stringent, the engine designer can hold parts op- erating cost down. 650212 Impact of Flight Operat- ing Techniques Upon Engine Maintenance Costs. S. L. Higgin- bottom and R. S. Stahr, Eastern Air Lines, Inc. When an airline finds it- self in trouble with an engine because of high cost, or poor reliability, or both, decisions frequently must be made long before a complete picture is available to the decision-makers. Experience and judgment play a ma- jor role in selecting the course of cor- rective action. This paper reviews these difficult decisions in a specific case history. The results of those de- cisions are analyzed quantitatively. The significance of the results is dis- cussed qualitatively. A relationship is then drawn between the operators' experiences and the design criteria established by the engine manufac- turer in the design of new engines. 650213 Community Noise Char- acteristics of the Supersonic Transport. N. Shapiro and H. Drell, Lockheed-California Co. Com- munity noise characteristics of pres- ent subsonic jet aircraft have resulted in stringent acoustical objectives for the supersonic transport. Achieve- ment of the 108 PNdB take-off objec- tive has constituted a significant por- tion of the total design effort on the SST. It is possible to provide an air- plane that produces less community noise than the present subsonic jets, by the use of engines with airflows of three to four times that of existing subsonic jet engines - but with low velocities resulting in low jet noise - and by providing the aircraft with outstanding take-off and climb-out performance. Properly planned ground maneuvers and available sup- pression equipment will result in satis- factory noise levels during ground operations and maintenance runups. 90</page><page sequence="30">650214-650222 650214 Operating Procedures Associated with Noise Generated by the Supersonic Transport. G. T. Gebhardt, R. H. Sawhill and R. J. Marhefka, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. The noise characteristics of The Boeing Company variable sweep supersonic transport are described. It is predicted that the noise levels of this airplane will be lower than those of current intercontinental subsonic jets. However, the noise generated by the supersonic transport could be substantially modified by the way the aircraft will be operated. The flexi- bility in operation afforded by the Boeing supersonic transport for achieving low noise levels, both air- port and in the community, is re- viewed. No major noise problems are anticipated because of SST oper- ations at present airfields. 650215 United States Supersonic Transport Program. J. K. Power, Federal Aviation Agency. Perform- ance objectives for the United States supersonic transport airplane pro- vide for minimum sonic boom levels, and engine noise levels no greater than generated by current large sub- sonic jet aircraft. A national pro- gram of sonic boom research has been pursued by the NASA, DOD and FAA. A National Academy of Sciences committee is now providing guidance and counsel for this effort. Major recent sonic boom flight re- search programs, which have yielded extensive data, were the study of pub- lic reaction to sonic boom in the Okla- homa City area last year and the structural response program recently concluded at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. Findings in these two sonic boom programs are presented. Engine noise, which has received attention since the inception of supersonic transport research and under design contracts, may be less for the SST than for current large subsonic jets under most conditions. 650216 Recommended Practices for Use in the Measurement and Evaluation of Aircraft Neighbor- hood Noise Levels. A. L. McPike, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Aircraft Div. SAE Committee A-21, Aircraft Exterior Noise Measurements, was formed in 1961 to develop recom- mended practices for use in the eval- uation of aircraft noise as it relates to airport neighborhood annoyance problems. The general areas of in- terest to the committee include the measurement, propagation, prediction and subjective rating of aircraft noise. This paper discusses the evaluation of aircraft neighborhood noise levels and describes the subjective measures by which comparisons can be made. Included in the discussion are the rec- ommended practices adopted by SAE and those that are being studied by Committee A-21. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650217 Application of the GEM Concept to the Amphibious Sup- port Mission. J. Maravel and T. Brazier, Republic Aviation Corp. This paper reviews the results of a re- cently completed test of the VA-3 air cushion vehicle. Special emphasis was placed in this test program on the evaluation of air cushion vehicles (ACV's) for missions in an amphibi- ous assault. An insight to the feasi- bility of this concept of their utiliza- tion may be obtained not only from these test results but from the defini- tive 5-ton payload ACV design study also presented as part of this paper. 650220 Hovercraft in the United Kingdom. A. F. A. Hassall, British Technical Service Corp. This paper attempts to review the likely develop- ments concerning Hovercraft that will occur in the United Kingdom in the near future. It does not attempt an exhaustive study of any one of these developments, but will endeavor to give some indication of the more significant points, the solutions of which will determine success or fail- ure for the widespread use of the Hovercraft principle. 650221 Can the Compact Jets Solve Both the Trunk and Re- gional Airlines Dilemma? F. T. Weisman, Bonanza Air Lines, Inc. The economic trends of our society and its population distribution assure the continued growth of the short- haul segment of the transportation industry. The improved surface travel, and demand for passenger comfort require sophisticated aircraft in lieu of "DC-3 replacements" and obsolete trunk equipment. Regional and local carriers' equipment selec- tion is often more critical than that of the larger operator due to the greater amount of flexibility required and proportionately higher invest- ment. The present offering of short- range jets for this important market, if successfully produced, will ease the dilemma of short-range being synony- mous with short profit for large and small operator alike. 650222 Maintenance and Relia- bility Requirements for Future Generation Aircraft. J. Vidal, West Coast Airlines, Inc. Today's traveling public demands a consist- ently high degree of: safety, comfort, and reliability of scheduled on-time performance. This has necessitated the close cooperation of the aircraft manufacturer and the airline operator in continuing efforts to achieve these three basic essentials to air trans- portation through ever increasing reliability of equipment. This can in large measure be realized through: steady improvement in airframe, en- gine and component integrity through design research and production qual- ity control by the respective manu- facturer ; easier access for compo- nents inspection through design of the aircraft; simplified methods of installation and/or removal; certain essential system duplication built in the aircraft; and close collaboration on training mechanical personnel en- abling them to cope with the sophistry of modern aircraft systems. 91</page><page sequence="31">650223-650231 650223 The Next Generation of Shorthaul Aircraft. R. J. Masiel- lo, Allegheny Airlines, Inc. The ad- vent of the SST aircraft makes im- perative the cooperation of industry and government in developing a sys- tem of local service air transportation, which will complement the speed and service of surface transportation and long range aircraft currently under development for use in the 1970's. It illustrates the urgency and need to merge the best of all technological developments in communications, computors and surface transport with the short range inter-city aircraft. 650224 Landing Gear of the Lockheed SST. K. S. Carter, Lockheed-California Co. The land- ing gear of the Lockheed Model L-2000 supersonic transport is de- scribed as a vital element of the over- all configuration of the airplane, con- sidering the sometimes conflicting demands for safety, simplicity, long service life, small frontal area, and low pavement loading. The choice of six wheels for each main gear is explained, as is the selection of tita- nium alloy and high heat-treat steel as the principal structural materials. The nose gear steering system and the wheel well cooling systems are de- scribed, together with criteria for tires, wheels, and brakes. 650225 Engine Air Inlet Com- patibility for the Supersonic Transport. C. E. Kepler, United Aircraft Corp. ; and F. W. Barry, United Aircraft Corp., Hamilton Standard Div. This paper is a sur- vey of the general requirements for the performance and control of super- sonic inlets for turbojet or turbofan propulsion systems for the supersonic transport. The first half of the paper discusses the interaction between in- let and engine performance. The effects of pressure recovery, bleed flows, and external drags on the en- gine thrust and specific fuel consump- tion are shown for design and off- design operation. The second half of the paper discusses the problem of controlling the inlet to obtain safe and efficient operation. The effects of control tolerances on the inlet geometry and terminal shock position on the engine performance are also shown. Possible approaches for simplifying or improving the inlet control system are discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650226 Environmental Control System Considerations for Super- sonic Cruising Aircraft. L. L. Christensen and J. A. Richards, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Weight and the thermal environment will be ma- jor considerations in designing su- personically cruising aircraft. Be- cause of aerodynamic heating, larger capacity environmental control sys- tems will be required. Techniques to help minimize their weight and drag are illustrated. Factors for selecting from among various environmental systems are outlined. Low air pres- sure and heat sink problems are caus- ing the air-cycle to grow in weight and complexity, but air-cycle prob- ably will be the most acceptable for the first supersonic transports. Fuel will be used extensively as a heat sink, but heat sink conservation practices will be required. Some XB-70 exper- ience, emphasizing weight control, is included. 650227 Design of Aircraft for Safety. R. J. Pennoni, Directorate of Aerospace Safety, U.S. Air Force. This paper reviews various types of deficiencies uncovered during the ser- vice life of USAF aircraft. Specific malfunctions and failures are pre- sented with illustrations to show that reliability and safety must be de- signed, manufactured and tested into all parts of the airplane. This ap- plies not only to mechanical linkages, hydraulic systems and electrical cir- cuits, but also to aircraft major com- ponents such as wings, control sur- faces and wings landing gear. Details of specific failures and the corrective actions taken, exemplify the design principles and policies required to improve reliability and safety of AF aircraft. 650228 Safety and Reliability Through Design. O. T. Wells, Cessna Aircraft Co. This paper pre- sents statistics indicating that the safety record of general aviation is steadily improving. Innovations and design concepts incorporated into Cessna aircraft, such as improved landing gear, wider visibility, and safer cabin interiors, are discussed. The primary aim of manufacturers of general aviation aircraft is the devel- opment of a safer, more economical aircraft to operate. 650229 Safety and Reliability in Commercial Transport Aircraft. W. J. Overend, Delta Air Lines, Inc. Safety and reliability is the base of economics for commercial airline op- eration. The maintenance of these factors to the highest possible degree is the aim of thousands of people in the airline business today. At the same time, each manufacturer, each vendor, and each airline must keep the safety and reliability aspect in mind in all phases of design, develop- ment, and operation. This paper ex- amines the past history, gives an as- sessment of present operation, and also gives a projection of future re- quirements for safety and reliability in commercial aircraft operation. 650231 1953 Paper Jet Opera- tions in Retrospect with Con- notations for the Supersonic Transport. R. D. Kelly and G. T. Henderson, United Air Lines, Inc. A first attempt to study civil aircraft operations comprehensively, prior to having the airplane, occurred before the initial operation of U.S. subsonic jets. One airline carried out a man- ual-simulated "paper jet" operation lasting fifteen months. Today, com- puterized simulation of machines, methods, and operations has become commonplace, and replaces the slide rule and tedious day-to-day inputs of 92</page><page sequence="32">650233-650238 aircraft operational criteria. Com- puterized simulations are also being applied to every aspect of the SST de- sign and operations. This paper de- scribes the initial investigations and the current methods of applying com- puter techniques for evolving ways of integrating supersonic transports into aircraft traffic patterns. 650233 Light Armed Reconnais- sance Aircraft Operational Con- cept. K. P. Rice and W. H. Beckett, U.S. Marine Corps. Operational considerations leading to the Navy COIN/LARA program are discussed and the need for an aircraft with the capability to operate in battlefield en- vironments is indicated. The kind of performance needed to achieve ade- quate survivability and effective op- erations is covered with particular emphasis on design trade-offs and tactical applications of performance characteristics which can be optim- ized at moderate speeds. 650234 Operational Employ- ment of the Convair Charger. E. E. Patrick, General Dynamics/Con- vair. The Convair Model 48 Charger was successfully flown in November, marking a major milestone in devel- opment of the first airplane built spe- cifically to operate from rough terrain in the forward combat area. Spon- sored by General Dynamics Corp., this new airplane complements exist- ing military systems by bridging the performance gap between helicopters and high-performance jets. It pro- vides a variety of missions capabil- ities, including surveillance, counter- insurgency, armed reconnaissance, utility, and cargo. 650235 Design Concept of a Jet Close Support Aircraft (Super COIN). J. J. Lusczek, Jr. and J. H. Martin, Air Force Dept. This paper presents requirements for, and design characteristics of, an aircraft to op- erate in the tactical-COIN warfare en- vironment of 1968-1970. The paper discusses the rationale behind the re- quirements for a tactical jet close- support aircraft engaged in earliest phases of special-air-warfare (SAW) through the lower spectrum of limited war. It shows the need for a new aircraft since present or planned sys- tems do not meet the defined mission requirements. A design concept of a jet close-support aircraft is included. The design characteristics illustrate that although tactical-COIN mission requirements are demanding they do not pose a serious state-of-the-art challenge in aerospace vehicle tech- nology. 650236 Northrop F-5 Tactical Fighter in the Close Support Role. W. E. Gasich, Northrop Corp., Norair Div. The nature of close air support and its operational criteria are defined, together with resultant aircraft design require- ments. It is shown that the proper approach toward evaluation of the cost effectiveness of a close support aircraft requires examination of acquisition costs, maintenance and operations costs, aircraft responsive- ness, effectiveness, and vulnerability, and that evaluation on the basis of payload and range alone can produce incorrect conclusions. The Northrop F-5 tactical fighter is examined for its close support capabilities. It is concluded that, because of the origi- nal design approach, the F-5 meets all close support fighter aircraft require- ments. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650237 Requirements for Logis- tical Air Support of COIN Oper- ation. R. C. Dennehy, Research Analysis Corp. The traditional ser- vice role of providing equipment for the use of U.S. forces world-wide is being expanded to include the provid- ing of more suitable and effective weapons and equipment for employ- ment by local forces of free world na- tions which are threatened by or ex- periencing insurgency or other forms of conflict in remote areas. Aircraft equipment and systems employed in counterinsurgency actions up to this time have been almost exclusively hardware available in the U.S. inven- tory and for the most part obsolescent or surplus to U.S. needs. A systems approach is just beginning to be taken in assessment of future insurgency threats, actions, and environments; analysis of counterinsurgency require- ments to counter such threats; and determination of preferred technical characteristics of potential counterin- surgency systems. Air transporta- tion of men and materials has the important advantage of quick reac- tion so important in COIN opera- tions, as well as a unique capability in underdeveloped areas where sur- face transportation is both vulnerable and inefficient. 650238 Air Mobility Role of the STOL Transport in the Light of Experience with the Caribou and Buffalo. R. D. Hiscocks, De Havil- land Aircraft of Canada, Ltd. Ref- erence is made to experience in the world-wide operation of existing STOL aircraft. The lengths of avail- able airstrips are compared with the performance of contemporary trans- port aircraft. The surface conditions appropriate to unprepared field oper- ations are described with implications in design. Low speed performance, stability and control characteristics with reference to short field, para- drop and LOLEX missions are dis- cussed with suggestions for appropri- ate measures in design. An estimate of the cost of small package and emer- gency shipments indicates that the STOL aircraft is less expensive than the offloaded conventional transport. The cost of establishing and maintain- ing an air logistic system is examined with results which show the system employing STOL aircraft to be the least expensive. The paper concludes with comments on complexity and safety. 93</page><page sequence="33">650239-650245 650239 The C-142A Role in COIN Air Mobility Operations. G. Delforge, Jr., C. R. McWhorter, and D. N. Ritenour, Vought Aero- nautics Div., Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc. System flexibility now afforded by V/STOL technology has direct ap- plication in many counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. COIN wars us- ually occur in underdeveloped lands with no finely marked battlelines. This paper discusses the C-142 capa- bilities as a transportation system for populace protection and control, non- combatant services, and improved mobility of counterinsurgency units. Data which illustrate the C-142 per- formance in these applications are presented. 650240 Pan American's Building Block Approach to Reduction in Landing Minima. F. L. Wallace, Pan Amer. World Airways. Even as jet minima were being lowered to 200 ft and 1/2 mile, or a 2600 ft runway range, requirement for still lower op- erating minima was recognized. A study of the problem showed that there were several combinations of airborne equipment which would re- duce the pilot's work load to the point at which this goal could be safely achieved. The FAA reflected this idea in AC 120-15, "Criteria for Ap- proval of Category II Landing Weather Minima." Therefore, Pan American endeavored to choose basic equipment for 1200 ft RVR operation that could be developed into a system capable of automatic touchdown - the next goal. 650241 Inertial Navigation Sys- tem and Equipment Designs for Commercial Aviation. C. D. Bur- dick, Sperry Gyroscope Co., Inertial Div. This paper describes design considerations that lead to the de- velopment of a commercial inertial navigation system, the SGN-10 to be installed aboard each of Pan Ameri- can World Airways' Boeing 707 jet transports. New techniques of align- ment and in-flight digital computation eliminate the requirement for initial heading set-up from external refer- ences. Also, world-wide navigation is accomplished with a single com- puter mode. Requirements for air- way-type guidance (return to a fixed path on earth with settable, selectable destinations) are satisfied, and guid- ance displays are tied into existing cockpit instruments. The paper shows that microcircuit digital com- puters and nonfloated inertial com- ponents are now practical for any commercial installations. 650242 Simulation Studies of the Supersonic Transport in the Air Traffic Control System. R. H. Sawyer, Langley Res. Center, NASA; and J. P. O'Brien, Federal Aviation Agency. The current joint NASA-FA A simulator program, de- signed to study the problems antici- pated in the integration of the super- sonic transport (SST) into the air traffic control (ATC) system, is ex- plained. The initial tests have con- sisted of simulated departure and arrival operations of a variable-sweep SST configuration in the New York terminal area under high-density traffic flow conditions with as many as six SST operations per hour. Sev- eral types of separation standards and handling concepts were investigated while using an ATC system based on present-day concepts and procedures. Results describing the operating prob- lems for the SST and the workload, delay, and capacity problems for the ATC system are discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650243 Operating Cost Objec- tives of V/STOL Aircraft for Commercial Airline Services. W. J. Hogan, American Airlines, Inc. V/STOL aircraft may offer a poten- tial solution to the short-haul losses of commercial airlines. This paper discusses operational and economic characteristics desirable in V/STOL aircraft designed for commercial ser- vice over routes of 150 miles or less. Current helicopter cost experience is analyzed and the results of a recent simulation of helicopter operations over a typical short-haul truck line route are reported. V/STOL cost trends are compared with comparable cost trends of fixed-wing aircraft in short-haul commercial service. Eco- nomic requirements are discussed and the sensitivity of V/STOL costs to change in various cost determinants analyzed. 650244 Current Financial Con- siderations in Airline Aircraft Acquisitions. J. P. Mitchell, Chase Manhattan Bank. Better profits, im- proved image on the stock market, and the better financing position with these basic conditions, are the out- standing financial considerations to- day. Other aspects include the bene- fits of investment tax credits, the continuing opportunity to benefit therefrom, with the substantial pur- chase commitments running into 1968 and 1969. Leasing as a vehicle is getting greater consideration, with advantages and disadvantages. Fi- nancing assistance by manufacturers is increased evidence of the strong competition in a buyers' market. A continuing strong economy is key to airline realization of potential heavy cash flow adequate to service the siz- able purchase commitments. 650245 Operating Expense Fore- casting for Scheduled Airline Services. W. E. Alberts and W. H. Seymour, United Air Lines, Inc. The overall schedule and profit plan- ning process in an airline depends, in part, on the availability of reliable and sensitive tools and techniques for forecasting operating expense. Lin- ear programming techniques may be a new approach for relating historical costs or manpower levels to casual volume variables. Two advantages over a multiple regression approach are that illogical or negative unit rates can be avoided, and the results of other studies or management judg- ment can easily be included. Logical cost-volume relationships developed by this technique can be used to rapidly develop operating expense forecasts with an expected high de- gree of accuracy, and to perform detailed analyses and comparisons of current cost or manpower levels. 94</page><page sequence="34">650246-650253 650246 Some Technical Aspects of Advanced Subsonic Transport Aircraft. A. J. Evans, Natl. Aero. &amp; Space Admin. The objectives for NASA aeronautical research on com- mercial subsonic jet transport aircraft are outlined briefly. These objec- tives embrace reduction of landing speeds to enable use of smaller close- in airports, advancement of technol- ogy for higher bypass ratio turbofan engines to reduce noise and fuel con- sumption, and increase in force-break Mach number to improve cruise-flight efficiency. If the foregoing are real- ized, advanced transports with signifi- cantly better profitability and effec- tiveness than the current jets can be realized, perhaps by refurbishment of the existing fleets. 650247 Aeronautical Progress in the Federal Aviation Agency. G. P. Bates, Jr., Federal Aviation Agency. This paper briefly reviews the magnitude, reasons for, and na- ture of FAA research and develop- ment programs aimed at advancing civil aviation. It includes considera- tion of aeromedicai programs such as effects of agricultural sprays on pilot flight capability and the devel- opment of survival equipment. The FAA programs to improve safety of aviation, including such efforts as crashworthiness, fire protection, noise suppression, and lightning studies are covered. The programs to modern- ize and automate the air traffic con- trol system and to develop all-weather landing systems are discussed. 65024S C-5A Cargo Transport Aircraft. R. S. Martin, Air Force Dept. The C-5A cargo transport air- craft is being developed by the Air Force to provide the means to deploy Army and Air Force tactical units rapidly to trouble spots world wide. The size of the C-5A will allow trans- port of almost all Army fighting and support equipment directly from the United States to support areas close to the point of employment. 650249 Army Aircraft Systems Development Program. J. Dib- ble, Jr., Office of the Chief of Res. &amp; Dev., U.S. Army. The Army's air- craft development efforts are directed toward six major systems. The prin- cipal thrust is in the vertical and short takeoff and landing concepts, rang- ing from low to moderate disc load- ing. The six major aircraft systems are: light observation, surveillance and target acquisition, advanced aerial fire support, utility tactical transport, light tactical transport, and heavy lift. Coupled with these ef- forts, the Army conducts a number of exploratory and advanced develop- ment projects not specifically directed toward any individual system, but which will result in improved small turbine engines, reduction of aircraft vulnerability, noise and vibration abatement, improved controllability, reduction of power train weight, and increased armament effectiveness. 650250 Angle of Attack as an Aid to Flying. C. H. Tuomela, Navy Dept. Application of the early ideas of Wilbur and Orville Wright, in regards to angle of incidence, has provided the Navy with an effective method of controlling airplane ap- proach and landing spaces. The cur- rent Navy angle-of-attack systems have commercial applications for use in landing, clear air turbulence, stall warning and other flight regimes. The most important application of the angle-of-attack, to date, has been its u e with automatic throttle for control of speed in approaches and landings. The angle-of-attack system provides optimum reference for auto-throttle operation regardless of aircraft weight, bank angle, flap settings, "g" loading and engines in operation. 650251 Operational and Design Considerations of Swept Wing Transports in Turbulence. J. F. Rudolph and R. S. Sliff, Federal Avia- tion Agency. Several loss-of-control incidents and three unsolved accidents in 1963, involving sweptwing turbo- jets, caused the FAA to become gravely concerned over what has sub- sequently become known as turbojet "upsets." The upsets are character- ized by uncontrolled dives with large losses of altitude and recovery by visual reference. Part I of this paper deals with design considerations and control limitations of the sweptwing transport. Part II addresses opera- tional considerations and highlights several research programs in progress concerning sweptwing upsets. 650252 Efficiency in the Use of Shop Space. R. B. Smith, Smith's Transfer Corp. A highly functional shop layout is described in detail. The layout is based on the use of two service lanes extending through the length of the shop, and takes into consideration the need for fast repairs as well as lengthy overhauls. The functional design of the shop, plus good operating procedure, allows for maximum maneuverability, efficiency, and cleanliness and keeps the equip- ment available for maximum work time. 650253 What Propane Engines Say About Spark Plugs. G. M. Galster, D. A. Garner, and E. D. Buck- ley, Champion Spark Plug Co. Spark plug and ignition voltage requirements were determined for a typical me- dium-duty truck engine in four con- figurations: production gasoline ver- sion; dual gasoline-lpg carburetion; full lpg conversion; full lpg conver- sion with compression ratio increased from 7.6 to 8.93/1. This paper shows that spark plugs only one range colder should be used when convert- ing from gasoline to lpg operation. Very cold running plugs are undesir- able because of the higher sparking voltage requirements. Cylinder-to- cylinder variations in spark-plug tem- perature were also found to be much greater using lpg. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 95</page><page sequence="35">650254-650259 650254 (949D) Highlights From 6500 Hours of Stirling Engine Operation. F. E. Heffner, General Motors Res. Labs. Since General Motors introduced the Stirling Ther- mal Engine to the American engineer- ing community at the 1960 SAE An- nual Meeting, the Corporation has accumulated 6500 hours operating experience with full-size, practical Stirling Engines. Most of this ex- perience has been in dynamometer operation which generated quantities of performance curves that define tin- operation of the engine under normal and abnormal conditions and which permitted critical evaluation and re finement of our computer analogs of the engine. Much knowledge has been acquired in development of the controls and peripheral apparatus needed to make the Stirling Engine a complete entity like the Ground Power Unit recently accepted and tested by the U.S. Army. Attention lias also been given to the study of Stirling Engine systems from five to five thousand horsepower for appi i cations ranging from below the sea to outer space. Discussion: A. R.

Quillian, Jr., Southwest Res. Inst. Under low temperature engine operation, sludge evidences itself in the lubricating oil or as deposits on various engine parts. The formation of sludge is initiated by liquid oxida- tion products, inorganic salts, and polymerized organic compounds that pass the piston ring zone. The liquid oxidation products undergo further chemical reaction in the crankcase oil medium forming solid "sludge binders." These "binders" are the essential ingredients that the oil must contain before the organic solids ( carbonyls, sulfur and nitrogen deriv- atives, polymerized hydrocarbons ) . inorganic salts, wear particles and soot can be deposited as sludge. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650256 (951E) Super Oils - A Qualified Success. M. W. Munsell and A. A. Schetelich, Enjay Labs. Enjay Laboratories has been conduct- ing a continuing test program in both the laboratory and field to determine the performance of the newly intro- duced high quality oils. Data from this program show that these oils rep- resent a substantial improvement over multigrade first-line lubricants avail- able in 1961-1962. However, the new oils have been found to differ widely in performance in some cases. Further, there are reservations as to using extended oil drain intervals with even the highest quality oils. These reservations include the effects of engine aging under extended drains causing rapid sludge build-up which could lead to engine failure. In ad- dition, the high insoluble load nor- mally carried by these dispersant lub- ricants can lead to increased wear as well as the phenomenon of sludge dump-out. 650257 (957A) Dynamics of Ve- hicle Handling. D. Hodkin, Hum- ber Ltd. This paper reviews the po- sition of vehicle handling analysis in Great Britain today, with reference to product design; points out areas for further progress; and describes facilities and developments in re- search meeting the present and future needs of the vehicle engineer. Equipment and techniques for mea- suring vehicle steady-state control characteristics and tire handling data are described in principle, and refer- ence is made to the radial ply tire, aerodynamic stability, and driver re- sponse behavior. 650258 (961A) Military Vehicle Testing. B. D. Sissom, Army Test &amp; Evaluation Command. One pur- pose of the Army's reorganization in 1962 was to consolidate and stream- line testing of its materiel. Objec- tives of the Army's new test organiza- tion, the Test and Evaluation Com- mand, are briefly discussed. The scope of testing on military vehicles, including test planning, type of tests conducted, facilities used, and report- ing procedures, are outlined. Eval- uation of test results is compared against military requirements. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650259 (964A) Recent Develop- ments in Cam Profile Measure- ment and Evaluation. J. H. Nourse, Camcheck &amp; Cam Design Co. New techniques are presented for cam profile measurement and evaluation based upon recently derived analyti- cal methods and electronic computer programs. The new methods include the mathematical refinement of profile raw lift data and obtain the following advantages over current practice: ac- curacy - cam profile lift data accu- racy is improved by a factor of ten to one hundred times; repeatability - the profile measurements and evalua- tions are repeatable within the new limits of accuracy; evaluation - "camcheck" computer programs yield new information which has optimum usefulness to quality control and engi- neering design development; and effi- ciency - the new analytical methods essentially eliminate camshaft manual set-up procedures for profile measure- ment - and also substantially reduce the engineering time required for profile evaluation. In conclusion, new acceptance criteria for cam pro- file quality control, and the direction for the further development of cam profile measurement and evaluation methods and techniques are sug- gested. 96</page><page sequence="36">650260-650265 650260 (966C) Ford's New 240 1-6 Engine. W. R. Smith, Ford Motor Co. The 240 cu in. 6 cyl en- gine replaces the 223 cu in. engine, which enjoyed a 12 year useful life. This paper describes some of the principal features of the new engine, such as: seven main bearings, sepa- rate intake and exhaust manifolds, hydraulic tappets, individual porting, short stroke, individual rocker arm supports, cast rocker arms, displace- ment growth, provision for heavy duty truck applications, exceptional smoothness and quietness, and re- duced weight and compactness. 650261 (970A) Variations in the Skid Resistance of Highway Sur- faces. J. H. Dillard, Virginia Coun- cil of Highway Investigation &amp; Res. Wide variations in skid resistance can exist on wet highway pavements. Locked wheel skids started from 40 mph may vary from 90' to over 200'. The principal causes of variation in skid resistance include: (1) polish- ing of the aggregate that comprise either portland cement concrete or bituminous pavements; (2) glazing of bituminous pavements; or (3) foreign films. The polishing of the aggregates constitutes the most wide- spread cause of low wet traction and is the most costly to overcome. Skid resistance tests by many investigators have shown that the limestone-dolo- mite type of stone is more prone to polish than granites, green- stones, diabases and siliceous gravels and sands. More extensive testing throughout the country is needed to determine the extent to which many other types of stone will polish under traffic. Unfortunately road surfaces with low skid resistance do exist and for the following reasons: (1) lack of awareness on part of some high- way officials; (2) lack of economical polish resistant aggregate within rea- sonable hauling distance; (3) use of those types of bituminous surfaces that although economical are never- theless, susceptible to becoming glazed; (4) increase in intensity of traffic that causes polishing of aggre- gates that did not do so formerly. The emergence of a standard test method from ASTM Committee E-17 on Skid Resistance will undoubtedly encourage more widespread testing programs. Once this information is available, engineers can encourage highway officials to go to the added expense of providing road surfaces with high skid resistance. This as- sumes, of course, that no appreciable changes in the interest of longer tire wear will be made in tire composi- tion. 650262 (972B) Standard Color- Controlled Alloys With Protec- tive Coatings for Automotive Ap- plications. H. W. Pender, Chase Brass &amp; Copper Co.; and V. M. Ex- ner, Virgil M. Exner, Inc. The cop- per industry has standardized on a new series of color-controlled copper alloys for automative exterior and interior applications. These alloys are described along with newly-de- veloped protective coating systems, and system test methods and proce- dures. A new experimental automo- bile in which these new coated alloys have been applied in exterior, in- terior and engine styling components is described and illustrated. 650263 (973D) Potential Effect of Regenerators on Army Air- craft. J. W. White and N. C. Kailos, Army Transp. Res. Com- mand. A comparison of high and low pressure-ratio nonregenerative and low pressure-ratio regenerative gas turbine engines of the early 1970 vintage has been made for a utility helicopter and a medium fixed wing transport application. Elementary cost and productivity comparisons have been made to reflect the poten- tial of regenerative engines in terms of the overall systems, including cost, maintenance, and fuel savings. 650264 (976A) Development and Flight Test Results of the Tri- Service X-19 V/STOL Aircraft. H. V. Borst, Curtiss-Wright Corp. A new vertical take-off and landing aircraft, designated the X-19, has been built with high load carrying capacity, high cruise speed, and ex- tended hover capability. It is a tan- dem-wing, tilt-propeller vehicle pow- ered by two turboshaft engines. The design meets the exacting perform- ance, stability, and control require- ments of hover and low-speed flight while maintaining high transport efficiency at cruise. The basic ele- ments of the design are suitable for a series of new operating requirements for military and civil uses. The flight test results of the X-19 confirm the performance and handling pre- dictions and, thus, prove that desired operating characteristics of V/STOL aircraft can be obtained. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650265 (976D) Method for Com- paring and Selecting Propulsion Systems for V / STOL Aircraft. R. H. Tindell and J. Lyttle, Republic Aviation Corp. A systematic method for selecting the superior propulsion system for a V/STOL aircraft is pre- sented. A relatively well-defined set of aircraft requirements and a pre- selected group of candidate propul- sion systems form the basis for the application of the methodology. The design and performance characteris- tics of the aircraft and the propulsion system are fully integrated. The propulsion system that yields the lightest aircraft capable of satisfying the specified requirements is con- sidered the superior system. Al- though extensive technical data and the digital computer are required for a comprehensive application, the fundamental logic of the method pro- vides a valuable tool for less sophis- ticated studies. The method can be effectively applied to the conventional aircraft as well as the V/STOL air- craft. 97</page><page sequence="37">650266-650272 650266 (981C) Design Engineer- ing With Carbide. D. G. Jones, Kennametal Inc. Hard carbide al- loys, or tungsten carbides as the vari- ous compositions are more commonly identified, are of significant value as engineering materials. This well- known metalcutting material has a unique combination of physical and mechanical properties that can pro- vide the solution to many difficult design problems. Although this pa- per primarily presents examples of the application of carbides in the metalworking field, it should be ap- parent to the reader that carbide is, in fact, an engineering material with dis- tinct properties that should be con- sidered for application to any product design situation. A brief summary of the range of properties of hard carbide alloys provides the reader with some insight into the design problem solving potential of this modern engineering alloy. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650267 (983A) Development of Low Section Height Passenger Tires. R. C. Brooker, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. The new 82% low section height passenger tire has been developed to attain the tire per- formance and durability require- ments of present-day automobiles. A new tire mold shape had to be de- vised to obtain an improved inflated tire flatness that had been difficult to accomplish in previous attempts to design low section height tires. With this development it was then possible to take advantage of inherent features such as stability and handling, high- speed capability, power consumption, and brake clearance. Additional improvements were found in tire treadwear, traction, and tire uni- formity. 650268 (985C) Solid Surfaces in Contact under Extreme Environ- mental Conditions. R. S. Davis and J. L. Engelke, Arthur D. Little, Inc. The forces of interaction be- tween smooth silica surfaces in con- tact has been investigated in order to contribute to an understanding of soil behavior in the lunar environment. The normal cohesion between two fused silica spheres (0.1 cm diame- ter) was measured under ultra-high vacuum conditions (10~9 torr) and in the presence of water vapor (10~9 to 18 torr). The values obtained (5- 25 dynes) are essentially independent of the environmental conditions and may be accounted for in terms of the van der Waals "body" forces. In the absence of physically adsorbed water the force required to separate two smooth fused silica spheres in tan- gential contact is significantly higher than the normal cohesion. The for- mation of chemical bonds across the unprotected contact interface as a result of microsliding is suggested by this observation. 650269 (987C) Aviation Fuel Safety. D. N. Harris, Shell Oil Co. This paper is based on CRC380, which is a report of the Ad Hoc Group on Fuel Safety. This group assem- bled and reviewed the technical in- formation available concerning the safe handling and usage of aviation gasolines, jet A (Kerosene), and jet B (JP-4), which are currently used as commercial aviation fuels. The consensus of the Group is that, while there are differences among the fuels, adoption of a single type of aviation turbine fuel by the entire industry would not significantly improve the overall excellent safety record of com- mercial aviation, and that safety is more a function of equipment design, proper handling techniques, and rig- orous precautions than of the particu- lar fuel type employed. The paper contains only the Introduction, Dis- cussion, and Conclusions and Recom- mendations of the original report. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650270 (988A) Concept and De- velopment of Ford Electrocoat- ing Process. H. N. Bogart, G. L. Burnside, and G. E. F. Brewer, Ford Motor Co. The structural designer of automotive components often is faced with a problem of paint applica- tion for which paint technology has not provided solutions. Hence he must solve his problems by changes in his design rather than by using an applicable painting system. The electrocoating system described in this paper clearly allows the designer greater latitude because it provides greater protection for inaccessible or severely exposed components. More- over, it provides more uniform coat- ings than can be obtained by older methods. Discussion: S. W. Gloyer, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.; T. A.

Trucking in countries around the world are in various stages of devel- opment and fleet operation and main- tenance practices vary with the condi- tions in the individual countries. Extreme conditions of temperature, altitude, dust, humidity, and in the quality of service available influence the equipment and accessories neces- sary for operation in different coun- tries. The heavy-duty American truck has earned an excellent accept- ance in rugged work but flexibility of production is necessary to provide the accessories required for unusual op- erating conditions.

Burke, American Motors Corp.; and E. E. Prather, Bendix Corp., Bendix Prod. Auto Div. The American Motors disc brake is a development which represents a significant step forward in automotive brakesģ This develop- ment was a joint program between American Motors and the Bendix Automotive Products Division, com- bining the engineering skills and ex- perience of both corporations. This brake system, incorporating dual pis- ton disc brakes on the front and non- servo drum brakes on the rear, was designed and developed against an ad- vanced set of performance objectives. The new objectives recognize the in- crease in highway speeds on modern turnpikes calling for an increase in brake system high speed capabilities. The design of the American Motors disc brake involves operating pres- sures and temperatures requiring a lining of special characteristics. The development of a proper lining was a vital part of the overall engineering program. The use of Non-Servo drum brakes in the rear was the result of a complete review of the principles and objectives in front-to-rear brake balance. The conventional servo drum brake did not lend itself to the combination disc-drum brake system. Lining life and brake noise presented challenging and unique problems ulti- mately solved in the final design brake system. 650275 (1004C) High Caliper Braking - Corvette Standard 4- Wheel Disc Brakes.

The 4- wheel disc brake system used on the Corvette was designed for 1 g de- celeration without power assist. Lin- ing temperature is kept at a reason- able figure by the use of 1-in. vented discs. Other features of the brake system include: splash shields, fixed calipers with floating pistons, separate parking brake system, and large reservoir master cylinder, with tai- lored piston diameter and travel. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650276 (S414) Capacitor Dis- charge Ignition : System Ap- proach to Extended Ignition Per- formance and Life. J. T. Hardin, Eitra Corp., Prestolite Div. This paper describes a new electronic igni- tion system which provides trouble- free operation, while extending spark plug life to a warranted 50,000 miles or more. Design considerations are discussed that led to the development of a high-voltage capacitor discharge system whose performance justifies its premium cost. It describes how output voltage, available energy and output voltage rise time (the three major properties that determine over- all ignition system performance) are used to establish the design features for new electronic ignition systems. Specific considerations are examined in detail, and appropriate mathemati- cal computations are reviewed; for example, it is shown how energy stor- age and time constant relationships can be used to derive conditions for achieving ignition at higher engine speeds. Engineering data, such as spark plug firing voltage as a function of pressure, characteristic response curves based on ignition frequency, and spark plug fouling rate as a func- tion of voltage rise time, are used to compare this new system with con- ventional ignition systems as well as with transistor ignition designs. Conclusions are drawn that relate the new ignition's performance capability to high reliability applications and extended warranty periods. 650277 (CRC380) Aviation Fuel Safety. The CRC Ad Hoc Group on Aviation Fuel Safety has assembled and reviewed the technical informa- tion available concerning the safe handling and usage of aviation gaso- lines, jet A (Kerosene), and jet B (JP-4), which are currently used as commercial aviation fuels. The con- sensus of the Group is that, while there are differences among the fuels, adoption of a single type of aviation turbine fuel by the entire industry would not significantly improve the overall excellent safety record of com- mercial aviation, and that safety is more a function of equipment design, proper handling techniques, and rig- orous precautions than of the particu- lar fuel type employed. 650278 (S415) Field Weighing - Problems - Solutions. R. L. Ges- sel, LeTourneau-Westinghouse Co. The weighing of heavy construction machines in the field involves a good many problems, but these are not in- surmountable. Accurate results can 99</page><page sequence="39">650279-650287 be obtained if proper procedures are followed, such as: • Weighing one axle at a time, rather than using single wheel weighing, which is a less accurate method. • Placing the scale on a firm, level surface flush with the ground. • Supporting the machine on and off the scale on a solid, level surface. • Releasing brakes completely, lining machine up perfectly, and applying no steering pressure, which are essen- tial if single wheel weighing is done, and desirable, even if weighing an axle is used. • Taking at least five loads, prefer- ably 10, and averaging them. • Taking empty weights. • Weighing should cover a long enough period, so that many loads hauled are not weighed and operators are working as normally as possible. Select loads at random. • Checking scales frequently and re- calibrating when necessary. 65027 9 ( S416 ) Off-Highway Trucks in Open Pit Haulage. R. N. Pratt, Kennicott Copper Corp. The haulage cycle as a factor in suc- cessful operation of a mining prop- erty is described. At Kennecott a changeover was made from rail to truck haulage as the best means for overburden removal. Factors deter- mining efficient ultilization of equip- ment in a haulage operation such as tonnage to be moved, grade and length of hauls, equipment capacity, maintenance, and weather conditions were evaluated. The method where- by computers were used to analyze these variables and to provide guide lines for optimum utilization of equipment is presented. 650280 (S417) Fiberglas Rein- forced Plastics : Cost, Perform- ance &amp; Design Trends Today. R. B. Bassler and W. H. Van Lanen, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. When properly designed and pro- duced by the best known techniques, products made of Fiberglas Rein- forced plastic offer performance fea- tures superior to metals, wood and non-reinforced plastic, and at a cost per unit of value less than that of other materials. The authors report on the nature of reinforced plastics, some successful applications in gen- eral in transportation equipment and specifically in earth moving equip- ment. In addition, the authors re- port on recently completed process studies which are best suited for the unit volumes existent in earth moving equipment. The report is concluded by outlining structural analysis and prototype activity planned for the near future. 650281 (S418) Engineering with Plastic. F. V. Wadley, I-V Die Mold Co. A brief review of the two classes of plastics, thermo-plastic and thermo-setting resins, is presented. The physical and chemical properties of each class are described, and re- spective molding techniques detailed. Plastics in combination with metals are discussed, and production exam- ples of this combination are described and illustrated. 650282 (S419) Aluminum Truck Bodies for Mining and Earth- moving Equipment. R. A. Es- monde, Aluminum Co. of Canada, Ltd. This paper outlines the rapid development of aluminum bodies in mining and construction equipment, since tests carried out on a prototype unit in 1959. It relates how units have behaved satisfactorily in a wide variety of both medium and hard rock mining operations. Examples are quoted to show how to take care of wear, how maintenance compares favorably with steel, and how the aluminum units proved more eco- nomical. These factors are assessed in relation to new designs of bodies in high-strength low-alloy steels. The conclusion is drawn that with the trend to larger capacity loading and hauling equipment, the use for alumi- num units becomes more favorable. 650283 ( S420 ) Unique Concept in Off-Highway Trucks. E. F. Moreno and E. A. Domes, Interna- tional Harvester Co. A study to define accurately and discover new parameters of productivity for the contractor has resulted in a new de- sign concept in off-highway trucks. This new concept has been first ap- plied in the International Model 180 Payhauler, a rear dump vehicle of 45 ton rated capacity. Function and form criteria are discussed by com- ponents and systems in terms of com- plete vehicle and job applications. 650284 (S421) Job Instrumenta- tion Key to Product Reliability. E. F. Gildemaster, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Utilizing suitable techniques and equipment, job operating condi- tions can be measured on an earth- moving machine. Recordings of these measurements are a guide to es- tablishing laboratory test procedures and aid evaluation of the results for predicting component life expectancy. With such information, the engineer has an effective tool for designing a reliable product. 650285 (S422) Reliability Analy- sis of a New Product in Early Design Phase. C. E. Vetter, Cater- pillar Tractor Co. A major short- coming of many reliability programs is that they are initiated after the product is in production. Reliability prediction in the earliest design phase of a totally new product is an effective means of assuring proper emphasis and direction of the development pro- gram. This paper discusses the ap- plication of failure mode identifica- tion and analysis relative to a new product without benefit of field fail- ure data. The procedure to accom- plish this purpose is explained and appraisal methods are also described. 650287 (S424) Self Cleaning Air Cleaners - Option or Mandate? H. M. Turner and M. G. Mund, Don- aldson Co., Inc. Piston engine air cleaners available today provide ac- ceptable engine protection. Justifi- cation of expensive self-cleaning or 100</page><page sequence="40">650288-650293 automatic air cleaners of the future must be on the basis of costs - total costs which include maintenance cost as well as initial or original cost of the aircleaner. This paper presents the broad facets of measuring total costs, relate them to present day air cleaners and project them to the self- cleaning air cleaner. It is concluded the self-cleaning air cleaner is needed and can be justified on the basis of lower total costs in certain applica- tions. In projecting the data, the field and lab performance and main- tenance experience obtained on the Cooper-King Self-Cleaning Air Clean- er was used as a bench mark. 650288 (S425) One-Wire Brush- less, Integral Charging System for Earthmovers. L. J. Raver, Delco-Remy Div., GMC. It is ap- parent that a new generator and regu- lator design is needed to supply the additional electrical loads and meet the requirements for durability, reli- ability, and environmental protection on earthmoving equipment. This pa- per discusses the d-c alternator type systems which have been used to sup- ply electrical needs. A detailed an- alysis of the integral charging system is presented. This system overcomes many of the shortcomings of the pres- ent electrical systems and, because it has a minimum number of moving parts, it is potentially the most relia- ble charging system in use on heavy duty equipment. 650289 (S426) Progress Report on the Interstate System. F. Far- rell, Bureau of Public Roads. A sea- soned and time-tested partnership arrangement between the United States Bureau of Public Roads and the State highway departments is a prime reason for the success in ad- ministering today's highway pro- gram. The role of the State is one of initiating and executing programs of projects; the role of the Bureau is one of reviewing and approving. Far sighted planning has provided the solid underpinning of factual data for practically every major action pro- gram involving highways at federal, state, and local levels over the past three decades. Congress has long given its full support to sound plan- ning. Time honored problems of design, construction, finance, and ad- ministration are daily becoming more complex. So-called "human values" such as scenic, recreation, and aes- thetic considerations, the dislocation of people, and the ever-present prob- lem of highway safety are receiving increasing attention at the highest administrative and legislative levels. Much work is already underway on the intensive and extensive studies necessary to insure a smooth transi- tion from the program of today to one that will meet the Nation's high- way needs of the 1970's and 1980's. 650290 (S427) Props and Im- proved CPM Technique for Product Planning and Control. W. L. Meyer, Illinois Univ. Two re- cent developments in the Critical Path Method (CPM) are presented and discussed. First, the advantages of a CIRCLE notation diagram for the presentation of CPM project plans are described. As opposed to the usual operation-on-the-arrow CPM diagram, a CIRCLE diagram requires no extra "dummy" operations or events to describe the logic of the project, and operation numbers can be assigned before the diagram is drawn. Second, the concept of al- lowing dependent operations to over- lap in time is introduced and evalu- ated. The operation overlapping technique allows the CPM analysis of a project without an excessive amount of breakdown of the project pieces. This idea seems to offer the link between the bar chart and the ordinary CPM diagram. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650291 (S428) Torsional Vibra- tions in Drive Lines. P. G. Jones, Illinois Univ. The critical speeds for torsional vibrations of an engine and its driven system are not influenced appreciably by small amounts of in- herent damping. However, if damped vibration absorbers, fluid couplings, and other components containing considerable damping are present, the peak amplitudes of displacement of the various masses of the system will not occur at a common frequency and the concept of resonance loses its usual meaning. It is recommended that the response of the damped sys- tem be investigated when large damp- ing mechanisms are present. 650292 (S429) Army's Maintain- ability Program. D. E. Breake- field, Army Supply &amp; Maint. Com- mand. Significant changes in the Army's maintenance program are dis- cussed. The most important is the emphasis on equipment reliability and maintainability. For new equipment under development, specifications such as MTBF or minimum periods between servicing are being estab- lished. For field equipment, for ex- ample, inspection schedules have been altered, test gear has been modern- ized, and new maintenance techniques have been developed. Equipment Service Criteria, the Army's gradu- ated pattern of maintenance support, the standards for such support, the Army Equipment Record System, and the Early Support Concept are also described. 650293 (S430) Computers - Tools for Decision in Equipment Management. J. H. Maxwell, S. J. Groves Co. This paper explores some of the actual and potential uses of the computer within the construc- tion industry. A detailed analysis of computer applications in the areas of accounting and control, equipment management and estimating, engi- neering, and job management are discussed. The feasibility and eco- nomics of renting a computer system or buying computer time is delved into. The most significant advantage of a computer system is that current, up-to-date information becomes avail- able upon which to base management decisions. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 101</page><page sequence="41">650294-650302 650294 (S431) AC Electric Drive for Off Highway Electric Vehi- cles. R. E. Hopkins, Army Engr. Res. &amp; Dev. Labs. An example of an alternating current electric drive sys- tem is described together with a dis- cussion of the control system. An estimate of current status of this type of drive system is presented together with future projections. Challenges exist for improvements which could alter the future projections and some of these are discussed. Only gen- eralized conclusions are drawn on the applicability of those drives for in- dustrial application. 650295 (S432) Theoretical and Experimental Research on the Importance of Excitation - Soil Tuning and Compaction Equip- ment Design. R. Kondner, North- western Univ. The results of theo- retical and experimental research are presented to demonstrate the impor- tance of matching or "tuning" the fundamental time parameters of the excitation characteristics of compac- tion equipment with the time parame- ters of the soil being compacted. This "tuning" is a very important economic factor in practical situa- tions where large masses of earth ma- terials must be placed and compacted very rapidly to desired specifications. The degree of tuning is expressed as the ratio of the time of loading or excitation to the characteristic time parameter of the soil compactor sys- tem. Operational response at proper values of the time ratio may well give maximum efficiency for compactive effort. Fundamental time parame- ters of the soil as well as the soil com- pactor system are needed for proper compaction equipment design. These parameters are presented using theo- retical analyses of rhéologie systems and comparison with static and dy- namic response spectra of actual soils. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650296 (S433) The Art of Com- paction. J. P. Moss, Moss-Thorn- ton Co. This paper describes the compaction of earth, rock, and na- tural local materials used in the con- struction of roadbeds for highways. A historical survey of compaction is presented, as are proper methods of compaction, proper amount of com- paction, and cost of compaction. 650297 Fuel for the Supersonic Transport. K. H. Strauss, Texaco Inc. The importance of fuel costs provide a strong incentive to operate the SST on existing jet fuels. Po- tential fuel system problems peculiar to the supersonic transport such as fuel boiling, spontaneous ignition, deposit formation, lubricity and com- bustion characteristics are reviewed. The significance of these problems is established and their severity is shown to depend on the particular environ- ment provided by the designer. The difficulties of defining fuel properties to eliminate these problems are cov- ered along wTith available ways of making satisfactory fuels. The paper shows that major steps have been taken to operate the SST on current quality jet fuels but all necessary fuel quality control tests may not yet be available. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650298 (SP-266) Human Simula- tions for Automotive Research. D. M. Severy, Univ. of California at Los Angeles. An extensive review of the literature covering methods of human simulation for automotive crash research, from the crude sand- bag down to the UCLA-Sierra trauma- indicating anthropometric dummy. Use of cadavers, mathematical models, animal subjects, and human beings, both voluntary and uninten- tional, is also discussed. Advances in muscle simulation indicate the pos- sibility of building and anthropomet- ric-automation dummy capable of simulating both voluntary and invol- untary movements of the human sub- ject. During a collision, a computer program would modulate his neck "muscle" activity according to the stretch reflex action for the human subject. The most important advance in human simulation may be the de- velopment of a mechanized equivalent man for studying mechanically in- flicted trauma. In this way we could study the effect of these forces on the various structures and systems of the human body. 650299 (994A) Use of Hydrogen in Fuel Cells. L. J. Nuttall, Gen- eral Elee. Co. A new entry into the field of electric power generation is the fuel cell. This is an energy con- version device which needs a supply of fuel and oxidant from external source. The greatest interest shown in the fuel cell to date is for use in marine propulsion; however, interest has been shown in its application to vehicle propulsion. 650301 (P-5) Design Terminol- ogy for Mechanical End Face Seals. K. Schoenherr, Crane Pack- ing Co., Seal Div. Seal design is still mostly a "state-of-the-art" knowledge. When the application transcends pres- ent experience certain theoretical considerations must be given to pre- dict end results. Often terms used are not clearly defined. Undefined statements for technical discussions are a relative thing and open to in- terpretation. Therefore, this paper explains the most commonly used terms of the seal designer's vocabu- lary. Seal balance and pressure-ve- locity values are emphasized from a mathematical viewpoint as well as a physical explanation given. Practi- cal examples from laboratory tests and field results are cited. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650302 (P-5) Carbon-Graphites for Aerospace Seals. R. R. Pax- ton and W. R. Shobert, Pure Carbon Co., Inc. The special demands of aerospace applications upon carbon- 102</page><page sequence="42">650303-650308 graphite seal components are dis- cussed. Carbon-graphite materials are divided into five major groups with the unique properties of each group listed. This paper describes the influence that environment, op- erating conditions and seal design have on the proper grade selection. Special materials are required to ob- tain reliable seal performance with high vacuums, cryogenic fluids, and high temperature gases. Suggestions for handling and using these mate- rials are included. 650303 (P-5) Aluminum Oxide and Beryllium Oxide Ceramics - Seal Materials of the Future. L. E. Ferreira and D. D. Briggs, Coors Porcelain Co. The tempera- ture dependence of various physical properties of alumina and beryllia ceramics are presented along with some important chemical and nuclear considerations. Properties in the cryogenic temperature regions are stressed. The data presented will be a composite of information gained in the Research Laboratory of Coors Porcelain Company and from litera- ture sources on cryogenic properties of alumina and beryllia material. 650304 (P-5) Saturn Y S-IC Stage Engine Gimbal Actuation System. M. A. Kalange and R. J. Alcott, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. The actuation system for the Saturn V S-IC stage is described and compared to the Saturn I system. The use of mechanical feedback actu- ators that result in a significant in- crease in system reliability and the damping of load resonance is dis- cussed. The unprecedented compo- nent sizes and system requirements are cited. The components of the S-IC stage engine gimbal actuation system are similar to and a direct evolution of those used in the Saturn I vehicle system. The major system components are the fluid supply, a filter manifold, lines, and the actua- tors. The system is the essence of simplicity. As a fluid power source, fuel is taken directly in a single path from the high pressure side of the engine turbopump. Flow from the actuators is returned to the fuel sys- tem rather than to a reservoir. Be- cause of the small number of com- ponents and the design concepts used, the reliability of this system is high. 650305 (P-5) Saturn S-II Stage Engine Actuation System. V. W. McGillen and M. R. Jacobs, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. This paper de- scribes the engine actuation system for the second stage (S-II) of the Saturn V vehicle. Four separate hy- draulic systems provide thrust vector control for the vehicle during S-II boost by positioning the four gim- baled engines. A summary of the resulting system and component de- sign and performance characteristics is included. Methods of controlling contaminants and controlling the tem- perature of the system in a cryogenic environment are also presented. 650306 (P-5) Design of a Hy- draulic Gimbal System for a Moon Mission Booster Stage. M. J. Hamilton, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Missiles &amp; Space Systems Div. This paper discusses the mechanical, hydraulic, and heat transfer aspects of designing a hydraulic system to gimbal the engine on the Saturn S-IVB Booster Stage. This stage re- quires restart capability after a mod- erate period of orbital coast. The design configuration which satisfies the overall functional and environ- mental requirements is shown. Spe- cific areas of discussion include: (1.) Design of a hydraulic pump assembly which must be mounted on an acces- sory pad which may be as cold as -297 F before pump operation and subjects the pump installation to ther- mal shock (-297 F to +900 F) dur- ing operation. (2.) Design of an electric motor driven hydraulic pump for operation in the vacuum of space. The results of certain laboratory tests conducted pursuant to the develop- ment of the system are discussed. 650307 (P-5) Development of Fluid Power Techniques for Lunar Environments. W. G. Nel- son, Boeing Co., Aerospace Div. Power-simplified actuation systems for space vehicles are becoming a necessity with the advent of manned, lunar-mission space vehicles. Vari- ous actuation system types must be elevated to appraise their ability to withstand the severe low-temperature and hard-vacuum environment that will be encountered. Problems must be solved through extensive analysis and breadboard test programs to en- sure optimum subsystem selection and prove reliability before detailed de- sign of space vehicles. This paper reviews a lunar-vehicle hydraulic sys- tem analysis and development pro- gram. The actuation tasks of many types of advanced space vehicles are determined. Subsystem trade studies presented for some of these tasks include evaluation of hydraulic, pneu- matic, and electro mechanical ap- proaches to control requirements determined. The problems of devel- oping hydraulic systems for long stay times in severe lunar environments are discussed. New fluids and elasto- meric seals for servo-actuation sys- tems operating in the fluid tempera- ture range of -150 to +275 F are discussed, as are thermal protection techniques to provide adequate per- formance in -240 to +257 F environ- ments. Development of a bread- board test system, designed to solve some of the problems, is presented with the plans for an extreme-low- temperature hard-vacuum system per- formance test program. Recommen- dations concerning the role that fluid power systems will play on future space vehicles are presented. 650308 (P-5) An Analytical and Experimental Study of the Vor- tex Subcooler - A New Concept in Mass Transfer Cooling. D. A. Fester and J. R. Wilde, Martin Co. A simple evaporation method for cool- ing cryogenic liquids to their normal boiling point, or lower, is presented. The method employs a relatively 103</page><page sequence="43">650309-650315 small, in-line device, known as the vor- tex subcooler, to accomplish rapid mass transfer cooling without the use of moving parts. The unit induces partial vaporization of the liquid in a vortex tube through localized pressure reductions. The performance of a small unit, based on the continuity, momentum, and general energy equa- tions, is developed and the theoreti- cal results for superheated water, liquid nitrogen and liquid hydrogen are shown. These theoretical results compare favorably with experimental results obtained from a proto-type unit, of comparable size, operating with superheated water. 650309 (P-5) Discussion of a Large Scale Slush Hydrogen Fa- cility. C. W. Elrod, Aero Propul- sion Lab., U.S. Air Force. The large scale slush hydrogen facility at Wright Patterson Air Force Base is the largest of its kind in the Country. The purpose of the facility is to simu- late operational scale equipment while maintaining the flexibility of small scale research apparatus. Although, ideally, this is impossible, various compromises in design have allowed for a generous portion of both to be achieved. The discussion, herein, will describe the equipment in the Air Force facility, the use of the equipment and some equipment de- sign considerations based on small scale observations. Before going further it should be stated that the program is a joint Air Force-NASA effort with Air Force personnel con- ducting the research. The purpose of this joint project is to obtain as much information as possible on the han- dling characteristics of slush hydro- gen. The information will then be integrated into functional and future design considerations for hydrogen using vehicles. 650312 (P-5) Metalto-Metal and Metal Gasketed Seals. F. O. Rath- bun, Jr., General Elee. Co. The parameters governing the leakage rate across metal-to-metal and metal gas- keted seals are discussed qualitatively and quantitatively based on experi- mental evidence. The sensitivity of the sealing phenomenon to the sur- face finish of the mating components is illustrated. The results of several experiments in which flat annular sealing surfaces of both 347 stainless steel and 2024 aluminum were mated together, either directly or with inter- mediate flat annular gaskets of in- dium, lead, aluminum, copper, or nickel are presented. Experiments in which helium was used as the pressurizing fluid and mass spec- trometer techniques were used to mea- sure leakage rates are described. Results of experiments which involved yielding of the gaskets, and/or yield- ing of the stainless steel or aluminum sealing surfaces and tests in which yielding of the sealing surfaces was not necessary are described. The amount of plastic deformation neces- sary, as well as the required stresses, to attain leakage rates as low as 10~7 atm cc/sec at internal pressures as high as 2000 psi is illustrated for dif- ferent sealing surface finishes. The reusability of the components is eval- uated based on experimental results. The character of the leakage flow, either molecular or laminar viscous, is discussed. It is concluded in this paper that, in order to ignore the surface finish as a parameter in the design of a fluid connector, (or the quality control of the surface finish) the normally applied stress to effect sealing must be approximately 2.75 times the yield strength of the weaker material in the system. For surfaces controlled, both in asperity magni- tude and direction, the required stress level may be considerably less. For extremely fine finishes having no measurable radially directed as- perities, repeated sealing is possible for stress levels less than the yield strength (even with accumulated dam- age from their assembly operations). 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650313 (P-5) Low Compression Set Fluorocarbon Elastomeric Seal Materials. R. E. Headrick, U.S. Air Force Materials Lab. The hydrofluorocarbon elastomers have been a bright spot in recent elastomer technology, particularly in the area of high temperature hydraulic seals. However, significant limitations have existed: poor low temperature char- acteristics, and poor compression set at elevated temperatures. This latter deficiency severely limits the useful- ness of these materials as seals at temperatures well below their normal thermal capabilities. The paper is concerned with presenting the latest advances in the experimental com- pounding directed toward improving the compression set of these elas- tomers. Compound recipes for low compression set and the data for short and long term aging at room tempera- tures and 400 F will be presented. 650314 (P-5) Integrated Design for Gastight Separable Connec- tors. R. H. Williams and W. S. Deacon, Harrison Mfg. Co. This discussion reviews connector design considerations including load condi- tions, thermal reactions, metallurgical compatibility, design restrictions for both flanges and seals. A basic de- sign approach is then set forth indi- cating the most effective way to meet the conditions existing for various common connector applications in today's aerospace industry. Sample hypothetical design requirements are solved by using formulae and a nom- ograph. The data contained herein has not been published previously nor has it been rejected by any other national conference. It is not being processed for publication elsewhere. 650315 (P-5) High Performance Single-Stage Servo valve. L. J. Williams, Moog Servocontrols, Inc. This paper presents a recent develop- ment in single-stage servovalve de- sign. The new concept offers unique performance capabilities which over- come some of the serious shortcom- 104</page><page sequence="44">650316-650322 ings of conventional single-stage ser- vovalves. In addition to the physical description of the new design, a per- formance comparison is made with existing single-stage and two-stage servovalves. Emphasized in this com- parison are closed-loop system accu- racy and hydraulic power utilization ; performance areas where conven- tional single-stage valves have been notoriously deficient. Hydraulic flow forces acting on a nozzle-flapper valve are utilized to advantage in the new design. This paper discusses these forces and presents empirical data on typical servovalve configurations. 650316 (P-5) Concepts to Extend Servosystem Life and Minimize Performance Degradation. D. M. Longyear, Jr., A. Blatter, and D. B. Porter, Bendix Corp. The search to improve the operational life of fluid power servosystems has led to a better understanding of the condi- tions which cause degradation of per- formance. A principle factor in- volved is the dimensional stability of the critical elements within the servo- valve itself. A combination of the application of all-fluid techniques with that of superior materials offers promise. This paper discusses work accomplished in the application of tungsten-carbide to critical metering elements in a servovalve. Labora- tory tests indicate an improvement of better than 50 times the life of con- ventional materials. The application of all-fluid techniques mitigates the critical nature of mechanical elements within the valve. A discussion of a closed loop all-fluid servo is pre- sented. 650317 (P-5) Hybrid Digital Hy- draulic Servo. E. N. Yount and P. M. Stiglic, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Autonetics Div. In many ap- plications, control system equations are being processed in a digital com- puter. Digital-to-analog (D/A) con- verters are then used to make com- mand signals compatible with analog final control elements. It is more desirable to design a highly inte- grated system which uses a digital servo and does not require D/A con- version. However, digital hydraulic servo valves have not yet been highly developed, and some types are quite complex. It was the object of this program to design a hydraulic digital servo which uses the standard, proven two-stage electrohydraulic servo valve. This was done by having the servo valve itself perform the function of a D/A converter. It accepts digital signals in computer format and quantizes actuator velocity. In- itial design studies were performed, followed by analog and digital com- puter studies. A breadboard unit was built and evaluated. Two main conclusions have thus far been reached: (1.) Performance compar- able to analog servo systems can be obtained with the hybrid. (2.) The basic concept provides inherent re- dundancy, thus high reliability; the hybrid servo operates at reduced per- formance with most single failures. Experimental as well as analytical data are presented in the paper. 650318 (P-5) New Servovalve Concept - The Ball Valve. R. D. Gustafson, Purdue Univ. The new type of fluid device described in this paper is closely analogous to a vac- uum tube cathode follower amplifier. It provides an output pressure equal to an input control pressure, but with a high input impedance and low out- put impedance providing a power gain. A string of balls moving in response to pressures acting on the ball surfaces provides the basic valve action. Because of its structure and the use of balls as the control ele- ments, this device is relatively easy to manufacture, does not require a lubricating fluid and can be operated at high temperatures. 650319 (P-5) Selection of a Least "Cost" Hydraulic System for Launch Vehicle Engine Position Control. D. R. Moody and M. Nakai, Martin Co., Denver Div. The general aspects of selecting an opti- mum or least cost hydraulic thrust vector control system is covered. Cost includes: 1) development cost, 2) unit cost, 3) the cost of weight, 4) the cost of failures, 5) the cost of low system response, 6) the cost of a short system life or operating time and 7) the cost of a long development time. This paper describes the de- velopment of a computer program for system cost investigations. The need for such investigations is discussed and results for a few specific systems presented. 650321 (P-5) SNAP 50/ SPUR Power Conversion System Objec- tives, Current Status, and Lunar Applications. R. D. Gruntz and R. A. Rackley, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona, Div., Garrett Corp. The SNAP 50/SPUR potassium Rankine- cycle power-conversion system tech- nology is described in some detail, including the status of development of the potassium boiler, potassium turbo- generator, condenser/ radiator, pumps, and control system. Current test results and hardware are shown. A discussion of a potential lunar appli- cation and associated problems is included. Conclusions reached are that the high-temperature Rankine cycle with potassium as the working fluid is an excellent choice for appli- cations of this nature because of the light weight, compact size, and sim- plicity inherent in this system. 650322 (P-5) Design and Devel- opment of a Zero-G Vapor Liq- uid Separator for Use in Cryo- genic Fluid Power Systems. J. F. DiStefano and S. Shiozawa, Borg- Warner Corp., Pesco Products Div. During long coast periods of zero- gravity, storage vessels for the cryo- genic liquids proposed for use in some power transmission systems undergo random distribution of the liquid and vapor phases therein. Thus, when heat flow into the vessel causes the vessel pressure to build-up requiring venting to maintain a safe value, the likelihood of venting the valuable liquid phase, as well as the vapor, 105</page><page sequence="45">650323-650329 106 results. To preclude this eventuality, various devices for separating the liquid and vapor phases and venting just the vapor have been studied and carried into the experimentation stages. This report presents the data obtained from the analysis, design and development testing of a specific, dynamic type vapor-liquid separator intended for use in a hydrogen stor- age tank. Testing completed and reported on herein was non-cryogenic. Model laws of similarity for two- phase operation in the non-cryogenic media were used for determining non- cryogenic test conditions simulating the intended cryogenic application. Extrapolated cryogenic performance is presented and also proposed meth- ods of testing in the cryogenic media. 650323 (P-5) New Design Con- cepts in the DC-9 Hydraulic Sys- tem. R. D. Rothi, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Aircraft Div. The newest addition to the Douglas family of air- planes is the short to medium haul DC-9. This paper includes a brief description of the DC-9 hydraulic systems highlighting special design criteria. Also included in a discus- sion of some of the new built-in de- sign features which have been incor- porated to assist the airlines in trouble shooting and maintenance. The at- tendant reduction in unnecessary component removals will not only reduce operating costs and overhaul time but will also result in a marked improvement in reliability. 650324 (P-5) The Self-Sufficient Airplane. F. Cracknell and C. C. Barker, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. Various methods of starting the turbo-prop engines of the De Havilland Buffalo are discussed. As a result of the evaluation, the sys- tem adopted results in an airplape which is self-sufficient, i.e., needing no ground power for its continuing op- eration anywhere in the world. It is shown that this is achieved with a weight saving over other types of start systems. Advantages, economic and otherwise are discussed, and the suggestion is made that self-sufficiency is a desirable end in itself and may be applied to airline operations. 650326 (P-5) Situation Com- pletely Fluid - Caravelle Jet Transport Hydraulic System, Op- eration and Maintenance. 0. A. Darcey, United Airlines, Inc. This paper is a brief review of one air- line's experience with a jet transport that uses only hydraulics for flight controls and services. The Sud Cara- velle is not a new airplane. But it does embody design concepts that are the forerunners of what we must anticipate in future transport aircraft. Discussion will include: Brief review of hydraulic system-circuits and the redundancy for complete flight safety back up: the need for operator con- cern over system integrity and inter- nal leakage; and the periodic checks and measurements used to monitor and control the system integrity. These contemporary problems and procedures give us some insight into the more sophisticated matters of the future that must concern the opera- tion of a supersonic transport. 650327 (P-5) Fire-Resis tant High Temperature Hydraulic Fluids for the SST. R. E. Hatton, Mon- santo Co., Organic Chemicals Div. Fire-resistant hydraulic fluids have proven their ability to provide safe, reliable and economic operation in the commercial subsonic airline fleet. These operational criteria will become even more critical in the supersonic transport (SST), and additional de- mands will be made upon the hydrau- lic fluid. This paper will describe the development of a new fire-resistant hydraulic fluid specifically designed for the SST. A satisfactory aircraft hydraulic fluid must meet many cri- teria, including fire resistance. All presently available classes of hydrau- lic fluids were reviewed in terms of such parameters. Because of the de- ficiencies revealed in this analysis, it was necessary to undertake a basic research program to develop new fluids. This program is discussed in general terms and the end products, fire-resistant polyaryl fluids, are de- scribed in detail. Physical, chemical, and performance properties are in- cluded. Thus, a completely new class of fire-resistant hydraulic fluids has been established. A formulation has been developed around the specific requirements of the SST and is avail- able for further evaluation. 650328 (P-5) Supersonic Fluid Evaluation Program. C. W. Gal- loway, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. With the imminent development of the United States Mach 3 Supersonic Transport (SST), aircraft hydraulic fluid state-of-the-art must take an- other step forward to meet system performance requirements combined with high temperature environments. This paper presents results of pump- ing tests conducted by Douglas Air- craft Company, Inc., on 18 different chemical types of proposed SST hy- draulic fluids comprising 50 different fluid combinations. Pump and fluid performance data are presented for all 50 fluids evaluated. A general discussion of fluid properties versus performance is also provided. Four specific fluid types are considered the best SST hydraulic fluid contenders: chlorosilicone, mineral oil (super re- fined), perfluoralkyl, and polyaryl. 650329 (P-5) New Considera- tions in Hydraulic Fluid Testing. M. A. Pino and N. W. Furby, Cali- fornia Research Corp. Some re- quirements imposed by specifications on aviation hydraulic fluids are un- justified in view of actual conditions to be met in application. Tests per- taining to stability, compatibility, and cleanliness are particularly prone to be conducted under conditions that are either too stringent or too lenient. Examples are given to show how stan- dard tests can lead to erroneous con- clusions. An appeal is made for caution in interpretation of test results and for a more rational ap- proach in establishing requirements.</page><page sequence="46">650331-650336 650331 (P-5) Value Engineering of Contamination Control. J. K. Van Loon, Bendix Corp., Bendix- Pacific Div. With the ever increas- ing competition among companies to reduce manufacturing costs without sacrificing product reliability, Ben- dix-Pacific has engaged the use of Value Engineering in establishing contamination control on manufac- tured components. The process of establishing contamination control begins before the contract has been awarded. The program proceeds along the following lines: First, a foundation of sound comprehensive methods and procedures fully docu- mented internally. Second, the ap- plication of Value Engineering to the Customer design and performance specifications. Third, the alternate proposal showing the logic and rea- soning supporting the proposal. Fourth, the implementation of the proposal to the contract. And fifth, the documentation of records for the program. The important factor to remember is that, "contamination control is mandatory for system relia- bility, however, unrealistic levels of contamination control can only result in a gold plated product." 650333 (P-5) Establishing Hy- draulic System Operational Con- tamination Limits. M. G. Hocutt, General Elee. Co. This paper pre- sents the method used for determin- ing the YJ93-GE-3 turbojet (XB70 Engine) hydraulic system contamina- tion limit. The most contaminate sensitive hydromechanical component (the control) is subjected to bench tests determining the level of system contamination which impairs proper operation of the components' servo valves. This empirical particle count data, per ARP 598, establishes the failure or improper operating level for the system from which safe oper- ating limits are set. 650334 (P-5) Servo Valve Inter- nal Leakage as Affected by Con- tamination. H. L. Huggett, Doug- las Aircraft Co., Inc. Servo valves are rejected in the field for internal leakage rates which exceed specifica- tion requirements during specified maintenance inspection. Some as- semblies are near this specification limit, which poses the problem of whether to replace the unit or wait until the next specified inspection period. The purpose of this investi- gation was to determine the rate of increase in internal leakage under simulated field conditions, and this rate of increase could then be used to determine remaining life expectancy of the servo valve. A definite cor- relation for internal leakage was established between contaminated fluid from tactical sites as balanced against less contaminated fluid di- rectly from new one-gallon cans. The presentation lists the material and equipment used during the test procedure, and discussion and con- clusions. Internal leakage versus time curves for both fluids are illus- trated. These curves show that the maximum useful life of a servo valve can be increased with hydraulic fluid which has a high degree of control in the level of contamination. 650335 (P-5) Pulsating Flow Hy- draulic Concepts. F. H. Pollard, Republic Aviation Corp. This papeř discusses an investigation that has been in process for over two years of the technical feasibility of the trans- mission of hydraulic power by the means of pulsating flow hydraulic concepts. A pulsating hydraulic sys- tem bears the same relationship to a continuous flow hydraulic system that an alternating current electrical sys- tem bears to a direct current system. The paper will discuss the basic sys- tem design concepts, components that are peculiar to pulsating hydraulic systems, and applications that may be considered for pulsating hydraulics. 650336 (P-5) Modular Hydraulic Servos. S. J. Gut, General Preci- sion, Inc., Kearfott Div. Modular hydraulic servos can be described as those that include an individual hy- draulic power source for each indi- vidual actuator. These are packaged in such a manner that the servo can be installed or removed readily by de- taching a few bolts and an electrical connector. The resultant high den- sity package retains all the advan- tages of the superior performance of a hydraulic servo and acquires the simplicity, ease of maintenance and reliability of an all-electric servo. Modular hydraulic servos have been developed primarily for short dura- tion missile control but have merit for continuous duty aircraft flight control. Since each modular servo has its own hydraulic supply, the de- signer is free of multi-channel cross- talk that has previously necessitated the use of a constant-pressure hydrau- lic system. Multi-pressure, multi- flow and other variations are now feasible. In addition to linear oper- ation, bi-stable and tri-stable opera- tion can be used to advantage. The density packaging requirements have resulted in various design techniques. Submerging all operating components within a reservoir is a particularly attractive approach. Access to re- move components in such a system is thus discouraged and contamination control is greatly enhanced. The modular servo is maintained by re- placement with a spare rather than serviced in the field. Modular servos generally incorporate load mounting shafts, bearings, and supports as part of the package so that the servo de- signer maintains full responsibility for the various load parameters, e.g., backlash, friction, elasticity, and others, as they intimately enter into servo performance. This responsi- bility normally is shared by various mechanical, electrical, and structural engineers with the result that many desirable servo techniques are often rejected prematurely. 107</page><page sequence="47">650337-650345 108 650337 (P-5) Grade A Hermeti- cally Sealed Hydraulic Servo Sys- tem. R. L. Krebs, AiResearch Mfg. Co., Div., Garrett Corp. The paper discusses the techniques which suc- cessfully achieved Grade A hermetic sealing of a complete hydraulic servo system. Design concepts are set forth; actual hardware is illustrated; and supporting data are noted. The system that was sealed included the motor pump, servo valves, relief valve, dump valve, the hydraulic side of the actuator, the filter, and all 0- rings. All these components were immersed in the oil reservoir and then sealed from the atmosphere by Grade A hermetic seals. 650338 (P-5) Stored Gas Actua- tor for the TOW Missile. H. A. Poole, Jr., Chandler Evans, Inc. This paper discusses the design fea- tures of an integrated actuator unit for positioning the aerodynamic fins of the TOW missile. The unit com- prises a high pressure nitrogen/he- lium container, explosively actuated cutter, pressure reducer with relief, die cast housing with distribution manifold, four high response sole- noids, 3-way valves, and four actua- tors. The unit is designed for high reliability, low cost, and light weight consistent with its application in a missile which must be carried by the troops and which must be manufac- tured in large quantities. 650339 (P-5) Pneumatic-Hy- draulic Power Converter. W. E. Jansen, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Missiles &amp; Space Systems Div. This paper presents the results of the de- sign and development of a reciprocat- ing free piston Auxiliary Power Sup- ply. The Auxiliary Power Supply is a gas-driven reciprocating hydraulic pump powered by a hot-gas source such as a solid-propellant gas gen- erator. The simplicity, rUggedness, response, design flexibility and low fabrication cost of the Pneumatic-Hy- draulic Power Converter should allow it to be competitive for future Auxili- ary Power Supply requirements on missiles, boosters and re-entry vehi- cles. The incorporation of this power converter into the control systems of future missiles will simplify the total power system, reduce volume require- ments and result in overall system reliability gains at a reduced system cost. The operation, performance, system advantages, growth potential, and some of the problems encoun- tered during the development pro- gram are discussed. 650340 (P-5) Controlled Pneu- matic Actuation System. T. T. Hadeler and T. P. Carey, Walter Kidde &amp; Co., Inc. This paper reports the results of a program to develop a pneumatic actuation system for an experimental ejection seat trainer. The device was developed under con- tract to the U. S. Naval Training De- vice Center, Port Washington, New York. A method of pneumatic open loop flow and pressure control is pre- sented which results in predictable load dynamics during the ejection process. Close control of maximum rate of acceleration and maximum acceleration is obtained for a wide range of load weights. System an- alysis and individual component de- signs are discussed. Test data and calibration procedures are also pre- sented. Although the present device is highly specialized, the design methods described in this paper are applicable to any high speed pneu- matic ejection system requiring close control of load dynamics. 650341 (P-5) Technical Consid- erations in Designing a Hydrau- lic System for the SST. R. W. Abshire, Boeing Co. Requirements which establish the Boeing SST hy- draulic system configuration are de- scribed. Development of materials and components, thermal and relia- bility study results, and weight reduc- tion techniques are discussed. Care- ful consideration must be given to hydraulic system design for an SST to assure economical performance, extended life, reliability in a severe environment, and weight control of a large and high powered system. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650343 (P-5) Operation and Maintenance Requirements for SST Hydraulic Systems. G. W. McKenzie, Trans World Airlines, Inc. A brief summary of considerations necessary for commercially suitable advance hydraulic systems with em- phasis on maintainability, reliability, and economyā Discussion includes testing, basic design, filtration and construction. Expanded testing is suggested to include development of new component inspection techniques. Mockup use is recommended to de- velop repair and maintenance re- quirements. Recommendations are made relating to filtration and fluid testing. Certain desirable basic de- sign features are cited. 650344 (P-5) Construction of a Controlled Environmental Area Utilizing Commercial Construc- tion Materials. J. P. Stechmeyer, Borg-Warner Corp., Pesco Products Div. With the growth of the missile and space industry, the controlled en- vironmental, or clean room has be- come an accepted and necessary facil- ity for assembly, test and inspection of critical components. The paper describes the construction of such a facility within an existing manufac- turing plant. Emphasis is on the use of readily available, commercial con- struction materials. The intent is not a manual defining exact proce- dures and methods of construction and maintenance, but rather a de- scription of the concept of one par- ticular clean room influenced as it was by existent circumstances. In- cluded are areas for hydraulic assem- bly and test, and Lox cleaning and assembly. 650345 (P-5) Control of Con- tamination in Rocket Booster Hydraulic Systems. M. Piccone, Martin Co., Denver Div. Control of contamination in rocket booster hy- draulic systems is of paramount im- portance if these systems are to oper- ate reliably. This paper presents a general summary of the problems associated with contamination control of rocket booster hydraulic systems</page><page sequence="48">650347-650353 and includes discussions of the nature of the contamination normally en- countered in these systems, the results of the presence of this contamination, and the cleanliness criteria currently in use. The results of an investiga- tion into the effects of various types of cleaning on contamination are given. The present methods of con- tamination control are discussed and some improvements in particle count- ing techniques, including automatic particle counters, are reviewed. 650347 (P-5) Development of a Failure Analysis Program for a High Reliability Missile Hydrau- lic Power Supply. H. P. Schmidt and C. J. Reed, Borg-Warner Corp., Pesco Products Div. This paper de- scribes a successful failure analysis program developed by Pesco Prod- ucts Division for high reliability mis- sile borne hydraulic power supplies. Although failure analysis organiza- tions are rare in smaller companies, the authors suggest that the facilities and personnel necessary for success of the activity are available and re- quire only effective motivation and organization. 650349 (P-5) Design Margin: Key to Lunarcraft Shock Ab- sorber Reliability. D. A. Hodg- kins, National Water Lift Co.; and J. D. Eggerman, Hughes Aircraft Co. Design margin of performance capa- bility over mission requirement is presented as a useful concept in relat- ing various elements of a reliability program. The shock absorber for a lunar landing vehicle is described in detail in relation to functional and environmental requirements. Pro- gressive stages of the reliability pro- gram for this complex mechanism are reviewed. Development of design margin is traced from configuration definition, through qualitative and quantitative appraisal by means of failure mode analysis and reliability prediction. Design margin is then further validated by rigorous assur- ance testing and finally carefully pro- tected during fabrication and assem- bly. 650350 (P-5) Hot Gas Servocon- trol System for Aerospace Appli- cations. J. G. Rivard, Bendix Corp., Res. Labs. Div.; P. L. Ochs, Eclipse- Pioneer Div., Bendix Corp.; and D. J. Wallick, Vehicle Power Div., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This paper presents a new concept for a solid propellant powered, hot gas, high performance servocontrol system for aerospace applications along with a discussion of the pro- gram presently being accomplished to develop and demonstrate this sys- tem. The system discussed is de- signed to provide operational flight controls for a two stage, air launched missile with goals of improved relia- bility, weight reduction, and increased range as a result of weight reduction. Two separate systems are discussed with the first stage system providing control of aerodynamic surfaces and the second stage gimbaling the pro- pulsion nozzle and also including reaction nozzle roll control. Both systems are supplied from solid pro- pellant gas generators providing a supply gas at 1950° F. This program has led to the conclusion that high temperature pneumatic controls will satisfactorily provide the necessary power and response to fly a missile requiring high accuracy and to ac- complish this in a severe environment with a reduction in system weight and complexity. The results of perform- ance testing and environmental test- ing of the system and components are presented to demonstrate the suitabil- ity of the system for aerospace appli- cations. 650351 (P-5) Control and Regu- lation of High Temperature Gas. D. L. Royston, Vickers Inc., Div., Sperry Rand Corp. The object of this paper is to discuss the analysis, design and testing of valves for con- trolling and regulating the flow and pressure in high temperature gas systems. The flow control valves have been operated in both ON-OFF and proportional control modes, con- trolling the products of combustion of solid propellant at 2000 F. The areas to be discussed in detail will be : (1.) Initial static and dynamic anal- ysis. (2.) Design and material prob- lems. (3.) Valve actuation methods. (4.) Resulting test data. Two types of pressure regulating valves will be considered those that maintain a constant gas pressure for varying gas flow by monitoring the gas pressure at the valve and those that sense pressure from a remote part of the system. An example of the latter type is a valve that is used to maintain constant pressure in a freon expulsion system that uses a solid propellant pressurizing source. The conclusions from this work are that it is feasible and practical to control high temperature gas accu- rately and reliably, as substantiated by extensive test data. 650352 (P-5) Effect of Contami- nation of Fluids and the Effect of the Ingredients of the Fluids on Contamination. T. N. Deane, Bray Oil Co. Today hydraulic fluids can be obtained that are clean, and if not abused, will stay clean for many years. Now it is up to the people who put the fluids into the system and service the system to keep them clean and dry. Contaminants, such as moisture, solvents, cleaning com- pounds, "just plain dirt," and even component materials, each affect the nature of the fluid in its own char- acteristic way and often produce addi- tional secondary contaminants, which in turn have their own effect on the system. In this paper the products and effects of many types of contami- nation are described with suggestions as to how they can be controlled. 650353 (P-5) Simplified Analysis of a Gas Powered Servo Actuator. R. E. Huber, General Dynamics/ Astronautics. Historically, gas pow- ered servo actuator analysis has been complex. A linearized analysis ap- proach is outlined for use in solving preliminary dynamic design prob- lems. The simplified mathematical description is developed and illus- trated to describe the inherent char- 109</page><page sequence="49">650354-650359 acteristics and limitations of the basic valve and actuator. The type of valve can be selected for the model by assigning appropriate values for port underlap and area gains. Inertial, spring and viscous friction loads can be examined separately or in any combination. The dynamics of a specific design condition can be esti- mated by use of the model to deter- mine applicability, then related sizes form the basis for system weight estimates. 650354 (P-5) Fluid Computer Elements - Digital. N. C. Sher, Honeywell, Inc. A preliminary pro- gram to develop fluid logic elements suitable for general use in digital computer circuits was completed. The fluid mechanics stability mecha- nisms available for implementing the necessary logic functions were re- viewed, and the attachment of a two- dimensional, incompressible jet was selected as the stability mechanism for memory flip/flops and OR/NOR logic elements. Functional require- ments were established, and corre- sponding design criteria were evolved. The basic element geometry was established, and compact logic cir- cuits employing as many as twenty elements were designed, built, and successfully operated using the devel- oped hardware. 650355 (P-5) New Fluid Ampli- fier Techniques for Speed Con- trols. W. A. Boothe, C. G. Ringwall, and J. N. Shinn, General Elee. Co. Fluid amplifiers are now receiving considerable attention by control en- gineers due to their potential for high reliability, ruggedness, and fast re- sponse. For applications such as speed controls for jet engines, steam turbines and other prime movers, fluid amplifier systems are now being studied that use both digital and an- alog techniques. This paper de- scribes several approaches to shaft speed control that differ from the above techniques in that fluid circuits analogous to A. C. carrier systems are used. Results of testing are pre- sented for three specific "a-c" fluid amplifier circuits. 650356 (P-5) Miniature Fluidic Oscillator and Pulse Counter. W. J. Westerman, Jr., E. R. Richards, and W. B. Depperman, Martin Co. This paper reviews some of the prin- ciples involved in the development of pure fluid analogs of electronic com- ponents for such applications as com- putation and guidance and control. It specifically discusses two devices that are in the developmental stage: a miniature fluidic oscillator and a pulse counter. The oscillator uses port sizes in the order of thousandths of an inch, making it possible to use the vibrator principle for stabiliza- tion. The counter is a reversible binary unit using stacked plane con- struction which enables packaging a 14-bit counter, with a capacity of 16,384 units in less than 1/2 cu in. 650357 (P-5) Fluid Amplifier- Controlled Medical Devices. G. Mon, K. E. Woodward, H. Straub, and J. Joyce, Harry Diamond Labs.; and J. Meyer, Walter Reed Army Inst, of Res. The fluid amplifier pro- vides a solution for certain design problems associated with modern military medicine. The military re- quires its medical equipment to possess not only a reliability and life compatible with its proposed use, but sufficient ruggedness to withstand the rigors of logistics and operation in the field. Where fluid amplifiers are used, these requirements are gener- ously satisfied. By reducing the number of moving parts involved, logistics problems are simplified and manufacturing costs reduced. In il- lustration, this paper describes a vol- ume-limited respirator, a pressure cycled respirator, an external cardiac compressor, and a blood pump all util- izing fluid amplifiers for control and designed primarily for the Army. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650358 (P-5) Developments in High Strength Tubing. J. J. B. Rutherford, Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., Tubular Products Div. The prime requirement of the space and missile industry is for reliability in compo- nents. Many of these components represent conventional articles used by engineers over a long period of time, and it is necessary to stop and review the developments which have affected changes in these articles. From water pipe to helium hydraulic lines in missiles is a long step. But, so also is the change from cast iron to vacuum-melted stainless steel. These changes in application and in basic material find a counterpart in the development of quality in tubular products, although this development has been given less recognition. Tub- ing is a critical part in hydraulic sys- tems and must measure up to the re- quirements for higher strength, lighter weight and great reliability. The beneficial weight-strength ratio of steel tubing was recognized in the air- craft industry forty years ago by the transition from wood to metal tubular frame construction - with doped-cot- ton skin. World War II saw tremen- dous strides in airplane construction, both by numbers and by size. The actuation of airplane components was extended from pedal and cable, to complex hydraulic systems requiring special quality tubing. The change from aircraft to astrocraft calls for still further upgrading in quality. The aeronautical engineer must be in- formed of the latest materials avail- able for his selection. These mate- rials can best be defined by their capabilities and limitations, with re- spect to tolerances of dimensions, quality and mechanical properties. This paper will attempt to up-date some of the technical information which the engineer normally seeks in the handbooks. 650359 (P-5) Search for a Re- liable Tube Fitting. E. J. Purcell and R. F. Davis, Imperial-Eastman Corp., Imperial Div. One of the more subtle problems that has haunted the space and missile industry from its inception has been the selection of a separable tubing connector (fitting) that would be acceptable for the se- vere service condition characteristic of this type of program. Many of the unknowns have to be eliminated by 110</page><page sequence="50">650361-650367 the costly method of "in service" trial and error. Methods of testing to de- termine fitting limitations had to be developed from the results of our fail- ures because we learned that the es- tablished test methods of the past, al- though adequate for their intended use, were not adequate for this type of program. It shall be our purpose to present possible approaches in de- sign and development procedures that would contribute to the production of a reliable tubing fitting for the var- ious pressure systems of the Aero Space and Missile Industry. 650361 (P-5) Redundant Damper Servoactuators for the F-lll Air- plane. W. J. Thayer, Moog Servo- controls, Inc. This paper describes the design of the self-contained elec- trohydraulic servo damper packages used for stability augmentation con- trol in each axis of the F-lll airplane. These servoactuators incorporate in- tegral error sensing and failure shut- off provisions through non-electrical means. Each actuator is supplied with three simultaneous signal inputs, together with dual hydraulic system pressurization. Hydromechanical er- ror comparisons are performed and these are used to control a logic net- work which shuts off a portion of the actuator should a sufficient error de- velop. The shut-off is accomplished automatically and with no significant change in actuator performance fol- lowing shut-off. The basic opera- tion, design and performance of these rather sophisticated actuators is de- scribed. 650362 Road Speed Governors. M. L. Smitley, Holley Carburetor Co. A road speed governor which controls the maximum speed of a vehicle is described. First, the operation of a basic governor is detailed, then the author traces the development of the road speed governor. The latter op- erates in conjunction with the engine speed governor, resulting in reduced maintainance, fuel economy, and fewer traffic violations. 650363 (P-4) Development of the Gas Turbine Engine Installa- tion in the North American Avia- tion Sabreliner. K. W. Hamilton, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los An- geles Div. The Sabreliner business aircraft is unique in that it is one of the first such aircraft to be powered by small gas turbine engines. Fur- ther, its military predecessor, the T-39A, is believed to be the first USAF aircraft to be designed and tested to FA A CAR 4b and to military requirements in many areas where these exceeded the FAA requirements. The gas turbine engine installation, as a result, was required to satisfac- torily pass unusually comprehensive tests, as reviewed in this paper. The commercial Sabreliner gas turbine in- stallation has benefited from this F A A/US AF scrutiny and from the many hours of T-39 aircraft military service that preceded its introduction. 650364 (P-4) Five-Point Pro- gram Designed to Eliminate Con- tamination and Corrosion of Fuel Tanks on Aircraft Using Jet Tur- bine Fuel. W. A. Boggs, Lockheed- Georgia Co. A general discussion of the problems resulting from the in- troduction of contaminated jet tur- bine fuel into integral fuel tanks and a five-point program designed to elim- inate the contamination problem are presented. Areas covered are as fol- lows: (1) Inspection of fuel sources for contamination to prevent contam- inants from entering the aircraft fuel system; (2) Decontamination of fuel sources; (3) Inspection and decon- tamination of the aircraft fuel system ; (4) Use of additives for the control of microorganisms; (5) Materials and methods, including a simple sys- tem for introducing the additives ; (6) Fuel tank sealing and finishing systems (the good and bad points of all systems now in use, and the intro- duction of a new finish system that is completely resistant to degradation by microorganisms) ; and (7) Simple means of controlling fuel quality en- tering the aircraft from uncontrolled sources 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650365 (P-4) Development of Turbine-Powered Pressurized Beech King Air. J. C. Wilson, Beech Aircraft Corp. An extensive effort for an all-new turbine-powered executive transport was undertaken in 1962. Improved performance is often given as a reason for the desir- ability of such an aircraft, but low weight, low maintenance costs, and high reliability are important tangible considerations. Paper discusses how these factors eventually led to the de- velopment of the King Air. 650366 (P-4) Testing Techniques for Aircraft Reliability. J. C. Dussault, Cessna Aircraft Co. This paper reviews the history of light air- craft development and the needs for reliability which were created by this history. Testing techniques are pre- sented which show an application of basic mechanical principles which are applied in a unique manner to assist in the search of a reliable product. The techniques used and the span cov- ered indicate that this portion of the industry has now achieved the stature required for producing a reliable product for customers of widely var- ied experience levels. 650367 (P-4) Beech Aircraft Re- liability Program. W. H. Chestnut and C. E. Miller, Beech Aircraft Corp. Each of the BEECHCRAFT family of airplanes now requires a Reliability Program Plan. A typical program with requirements similar to existing Military reliability programs is dis- cussed. Emphasis is given to design considerations, testing, design re- views, data feedback, vendor data and management. Examples of recent re- liability activities are included for subject clarification. Implementa- tion methods including reliability training programs for both manage- ment and design personnel are also reviewed. Ill</page><page sequence="51">650368-650376 650368 (P-4) Gulfstream Relia- bility. H. J. Schonenberg, Grum- man Aircraft Engrg. Corp. Reliabil- ity, as applicable to the Gulfstream, is defined as its readiness to go when needed. The program is unique, in that it is tailored specifically to cor- porate operators. To attain the goal, engineering and support personnel share equal responsibility. Accept- ance of the aircraft has proven the philosophy to be sound and practical. 650369 (P-4) Use of Off-the-Shelf Aircraft to Meet Army Require- ments. A. J. Rankin, U.S. Army Aviation Test Bd. This paper illus- trates the economics of Army pro- curement of commercial aircraft and the advantages to the non-military aircraft operator. The absence of significant compromise of military re- quirements, and the history of this procurement method is presented. Military airworthiness tests based Upon military and FA A standards, and the establishment of common standards, results in significant sav- ings to the government, commercial and private interests. The paper concludes that the majority of the Army's future aircraft needs could be obtained through off-the-shelf pro- grams with the FA A as engineering agency, eliminating problems created when the Navy or Air Force is the en- gineering agency. 650370 (P-4) An Abstract of an Analysis: The Effect of the Air- frame Manufacturer's Cost on the Cost of Aircraft Ownership. L. Bush, Aero Commander Div., Rock- well-Standard Corp. In most indus- tries, costs of operation are cut by standardization and increased unit production. The aircraft industry, however, has four unique factors, each of which enters into efforts to reduce the cost of airplane ownership. These are: The degree of federal reg- ulation, the high cost of handcrafts- manship even on an assembly line, the value of parts reduction, and ac- tivity of the airplane operator himself. 650371 (P-4) An Operator Looks at Business Aircraft Operating Costs. H. D. Kysor, Harley D. Ky- sor &amp; Associates, Inc. This paper provides a realistic look at the costs incurred by a company in connection with a business aircraft. It shows for the first time exactly what costs are involved in organizing, operating, and maintaining a typical large turbo- prop business airplane. 650372 (P-4) An Aircraft Manu- facturer Looks At Business Air- craft Operating Costs. C. C. Clark, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Los Angeles Div. An aircraft man- ufacturer is interested in airplane di- rect operating costs because they are of concern to prospective customers. The customer's interest in operating costs begins with the evaluation of various aircraft on the market when shopping for new equipment. It con- tinues after purchase for budgetary and reporting purposes. Airplane operating costs are of interest to the manufacturer during product plan- ning, design, development, and mar- keting activities. Standard airplane operating cost criteria must be devel- oped by a recognized organization or society for the sake of consistency to enhance communication between buyer and seller on this necessary but often confusing subject. 650374 (P-4) Management Ideas on the Real Value of Business Aircraft. C. A. McKinnon, Inter- national Business Machines Corp. Management is the group that ulti- mately must decide on the reál value of a business aircraft operation to a company in relation to its relatively high cost. This paper discusses sev- eral of the tangible and intangible benefits a company realizes by oper- ating its own aircraft and how these benefits offset the costs. 650375 (P-4) Aviation Spark Plug Operational Factors. R. L. Anderson, Champion Spark Plug Co. Aviation spark plug experience in commercial operations - particularly as to combustion deposit fouling prob- lems - is reviewed in detail, with lib- eral use of illustrations, for better readable understanding by non-tech- nical as well as technical personnel. Environmental conditions present within the engine combustion cham- ber as they influence spark plug oper- ation are reviewed. Engine opera- tional procedures affecting improved spark plug operation are described. The objective of this paper is to de- velop a better perspective of the many factors influencing both good and bad spark plug operation. Conclu- sions offer suggested areas of change in spark plug, engine, and fuel for possible further operational improve- ments to better meet the broadening demands of today's commercial air- craft operator. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650376 (P-4) F/ A by EGT (Mix- ture Control by Exhaust Gas Temperature). A. Hundere, Al- cor Aviation, Inc. After more than thirty years of effort to obtain a sim- ple and accurate fuel-air ratio indica- tòr for mixture control of piston en- gines, it was recently discovered that mixture ratios can be simply, accu- rately, and consistently defined by the use of an exhaust gas temperature indicator of high sensitivity and very fast response. The first mixture in- dicator using EGT was placed on the market in 1962, and there have been five such indicators advertised to date. There are presently over 10,000 air- craft engines that have their diets con- trolled with the ALCOR Mixture Con- trol Indicator. The development of the EGT method of mixture control is described and design requirements are presented and explained. Data are presented on the effect of fuel-air ratio on exhaust gas temperature, cyl- inder head temperature, horsepower and brake specific fuel consumption. Effect of etìgine variables is discussed and data presented. The use of an ËGÎ indicator as an engine analyzer for trouble detection is discussed and data presented. The question of "How lean is too lean?" is discussed. 112</page><page sequence="52">650377-650385 650377 (P-4) Accurate Power Checking of Production Aircraft Engines. W. R. Horak, Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. To assure the rated horsepower output of production en- gines, Lycoming has been accurately power checking every tenth engine of each model. The principle and cali- bration of the hydraulic torquemeter, for use with the geared engines, are briefly discussed. The development of an electronic print-out system, of speed and torque, was conducted for power checking direct drive engines. The development of the electronic sys- tem is discussed in detail. 650378 (P-4) Additional Design Performance and Growth Poten- tial Through the Use of a Syn- thetic Lubricant. R. S.

A. G. K. Mayo, Godfrey Engrg. Co. Ltd. Pressurization is a relatively new re- quirement for smaller utility, business and private aircraft. The necessity for simplicity and low cost in this market dictates the need for new equipment based on these principles. A range of positive displacement su- perchargers has been developed and is in service proving its reliability. The construction and performance of one type of positive displacement su- percharger is discussed and associated air conditioning systems are studied. Particular reference is made to the advantages to be gained in driving a supercharger rather than using bleed air for pressurization in the case of turboprop engines. 650380 (P-4) Turbochar ging Air- craft Engine and Cabin. R. L. Cholvin, AiResearch Industrial Div., Garrett Corp. Many advantages can be realized by utilization of direct bleed air from the engine exhaust- driven turbo-supercharger for pres- surization of the cabin on business and utility aircraft powered with pis- ton engines. Combining cabin super- charging and engine supercharging from the same compressor included as part of the engine package provides compactness and simplicity which leads to low cost and light weight. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650381 (P-4) Design and Devel- opment of the CJ610 Turbojet and the CF700 Turbofan Engines for Use in Business Jet Aircraft. B. H. Rowe, General Elee. Co. The design and development of the CJ610 and CF700 family of engines were started in 1959. These engines used as their basic gas generator the gas generator from the Military J85 en- gine. The design of the fan section of the CF700 engine is based on the design u ed in the large General Elec- tric CJ805-23 engine. The develop- ment of both of these engines is de- scribed and the special tests that were required for FAA certification. Some of the problems that were encountered during the installation of the engine into the Business Jet aircraft are dis- cussed, and also there is a brief dis- cussion of the continuing develop- ment program planned for the engines in order to give good customer ser- vice in the Business Jet field. 650383 (P-4) Oxygen Usage in General Aviation. A. E. Miller, Scott Aviation Corp. Private and business aircraft are the largest group of aircraft flying over our land. Private pilots and passengers are a very large and very important group of individuals in our economy and so- ciety. Cruising altitudes and service ceilings are steadily increasing, with a corresponding increase in the dan- ger of hypoxia. Hypoxic pilots are a menace to themselves and other air- craft. Hypoxic passengers as well as pilots can suffer severe after-effects from exposure to hypoxia. The in- stallation of oxygen equipment need not unduly penalize the aircraft weight-wise nor the owner cost-wise. To improve flight safety and to pro- tect the health of those who travel in such aircraft, oxygen equipment should be made available, and its use encouraged, in private and corporate aircraft. 650384 (P-4) Muffler Develop- ment for Light Aircraft and a Technique of In-Flight Data Ac- quisition and Analysis. G. A. Alther, Cessna Aircraft Co. This pa- per presents a summary of the appli- cation of basic muflier principles to the development of an efficient air- craft muffler. Simple expansion chamber and resonator silencers were evaluated. The automotive tri-flow principle was also investigated for possible adaptation. The resonator principle was found to offer the best attenuation of the engine firing fre- quency utilizing a minimum of cham- ber volume and low back pressure. Acquisition of in-flight noise and vi- bration data is discussed with some examples of what is believed the most reliable way of analyzing the data. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650385 (P-4) Search for Stability of the Roll Axis. G. A. Denhofer, Piper Aircraft Corp. The long sought desire, of airframe manufac- turers, to build stability in an aircraft about its roll axis, is herein dealt with. Stabilizers of various types, employ- ing a variety of sensors, are discussed. Bringing stability to the roll axis brings about a further desire, that of holding a precise heading. The ap- proach of one airframe manufactur- er's method to this dual problem is explained in detail. 113</page><page sequence="53">650386-650392 114 650386 (P-4) Justification of Computer Use by a Small Air- craft Company. J. F. Morehead, Aero Commander Div., Rockwell- Standard Corpģ The purpose of this paper is to show how a small aircraft company that has a computer justifies it's expense. Several examples are given of problems that make the com- puter worthwhile. 650387 (P-4) Flutter Problems of Business Airplanes. J. A. Mc- Killop, Engineering Res. Associates. Flutter problems of business airplanes may be separated into two main groups. First, there are the technical problems faced by the designer. These are becoming more important as the performance of the business airplane continues to increase. But also there are problems faced by the flutter analyst. Business airplanes have just as many components as mil- itary or commercial machines and are therefore equally difficult to analyse. The problem for the analyst is to com- plete this analysis in a minimum time and with minimum expenditure. Discussion of this problem is the prin- cipal object of this paper. It will be shown that with the aid of the modern computer, techniques that are consid- ered antiquated by today's technology are best suited to provide a high tech- nical standard at minimum cost. It is the mobilization of techniques that are not in themselves new that is con- sidered to be the primary contribu- tion of the paper. In conclusion, some typical design problems are briefly discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650388 (P-4) Airplane Vibration - A Practical Approach. W. H. Schultz, Cessna Aircraft Co. Flexi- ble airplane structures in the presence of excitation forces may oscillate with bounded or unbounded motion. Ve- hicle safety and durability depend on control and reduction of this vibra- tion. Designers can generally safe- guard against its occurrence by tun- ing the airframe. Supplementing the design function are experimental studies that identify and verify dy- namic response characteristics for aeroelastic and fatigue considerations. This paper will discuss an experimen- tal methodology which is based on fundamental engineering principles and basic laboratory instrumentation. Examples are included in an attempt to demonstrate the directness and effi- ciency obtainable. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650389 (P-4) Pressurization, Light Aircraft - Values and Con- trols. M. A. Wächter, Dukes Astro- nautics Co. Pressurized light air- craft are now out of the dream stage and in the experimental flying stage. It appears from the response of many pilots and light aircraft owners, that a sizable market for these aircraft al- ready exists. The only big problem that remains to be solved is how to manufacture these aircraft in order to give the greatest value for the most reasonable cost. 650390 The Science of Design. G. Nadler, Wisconsin Univ. The re- search methodology is appropriate for developing generalizations or theories, but may not be optimal for designing and engineering projects. A comparison between the present methodologies of research and design shows they are the same but that their purposes are different. Preliminary research supports the hypothesis that a design approach can provide solu- tions better than can result from the research approach. An empirically derived design approach is discussed in relation to its successful applica- tions for designing engineering and management systems. 650391 (SP-271) Surface Igni- tion and Rumble in Engines. L. G. Pless, Pure Oil Co. Res. Center. Surface ignition may be initiated by one of two mechanisms: mechanical hot spots or combustion-chamber deposits. Conditions determining whether or not surface ignition occurs and the surface ignition resistance of fuels are different for each mecha- nism. The occurrence of surface ignition may be detected by changes in engine noise, time of peak pressure, rate of pressure rise, or flame front propagation time. Surface ignition may cause decreased engine power, increased heat rejection, and, in severe cases, component physical damage and ultimate failure. In- creased compression ratio, speed, and specific output all increase the ten- dency of an engine to experience sur- face ignition. The composition and additive treatment of both gasoline and crankcase oil have large effects on the surface ignition tendencies of accumulated combustion-chamber de- posits. Minimizing the heavy aro- matic content of gasoline can reduce surface ignition, but a more effective method is the use of phosphorus con- taining, deposit modifier gasoline ad- ditives. Minimizing the bright stock content and metallic detergent con- tent of the crankcase oil reduces its contribution to surface ignition activ- ity. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650392 (SP-271) Effect of Changes in the Point Pressure Shape and Circularity of Com- pression Rings upon the Per- formance of a Four-Cycle Diesel Engine. A. F. Lonigro, Perfect Circle Corp. A 4-stroke diesel en- gine was employed to measure per- formance changes due to variations in the point pressure and circularity of the compression rings. A statis- tically designed experiment was used to control the testing and analyze the data obtained. Results indicate, with 90% assurance, that changes in point pressure and circularity do affect the performance of this engine and that an interaction exists between the two variables. All testing was carried out at 2200 rpm and 220 bhp. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS</page><page sequence="54">650393-650418 650393 (SP-271) Gas Engines Valve and Seat Wear. H. M. Wiles, Waukesha Motor Co. Follow- ing reports of valve wear encountered in the field on gas engine models which had given satisfactory service for many years, an extensive research program was initiated at Waukesha Motor Co. This program covered a study of measurement methods, ma- terials, and lubricating oil effects on gas engine valve and seat life. Some of the conclusions reached on the basis of the test results are described. 650394 (SP-271) Introduction to Digital Computing for Engi- neers. W. J. Nyback, Milwaukee School of Engrg. The automatic digital computer is rapidly becoming an important engineering tool. This paper covers the basic aspects of com- puter utilization for engineering problem solving. What a computer can do, how to utilize it, and how to get started in computer utilization are the primary topics covered. 650395 (SP-271) Engineers and Computers, A Heat Conduction Example. R. H. Billingsley, Jr., Smith/A. O./Corp. This paper pre- sents an introduction to the form of equations suitable for digital com- puters. The information given is not necessarily new or unique, and most good textbooks on heat conduc- tion will provide the same theoretical data as discussed herein. The tech- niques used to solve the particular example given are some which were generated by the author's company and, to this extent, the paper may be unique. 650396 (SP-273) Conformability - the Manufacturing Contribu- tion to Product Assurance. J. L. Kidwell, Lycoming Div., AVCO Corp. The purpose of this discussion is to consider the function of quality con- trol as it is related to the broad sub- ject of product assurance. In the writer's opinion, the best way to look at the problem is through a systems engineering approach that concen- trates on the realization of effective products. The subject that is cov- ered herein deals specifically with the manufacturing-quality control rela- tionship of assuring conformance of product with design requirements, the second phase of the systems engi- neering approach. The relationship of manufacturing degradation and in- spection escape probability to design and use quality for realization of specific systems quality is described. The paper contains specific proposals for the joint manufacturing-inspec- tion activities to develop adequate product assurance programs to assure conformability to design require- ments. 650397 (SP-273) Reliability and Quality Control - Conflict or Co- operation? E. M. Stiles, Chandler Evans Corp. Customer demands for high quality and reliability are steadily increasing. At the same time, product and production process complexity, and hence probability of failure, are also steadily increasing. To satisfy the customer demands and still produce products at competitive or acceptable prices requires new philosophies in both design engineer- ing and manufacturing. These new philosophies must be practiced with a minimum of organizational conflict to be fully effective at minimum cost. 650398 (SP-273) Value Achieve- ment and Quality Control. D. Shainin, Rath &amp; Strong, Inc. Ap- proaches have been developed to supplement the conventional practices of brainstorming, determining proc- ess and product tolerances, and con- ducting a "zero defect" manufactur- ing program. When integrated with current plant activities, the combina- tion can increase product quality and reduce cost simultaneously. The pa- per is intended to encourage certain firms to start developing skills with these new practices - firms whose management may not have actively realized that their achievable product values are substantially better than currently being obtained. 650399 (SP-273) Integrated Test Planning and Analysis. M. L. Hinkle, Jr., Raytheon Co. Many sta- tistical methods and techniques are available for planning the integration of special reliability and maintain- ability tests into a particular pro- gram. The overall philosophy of test planning propounded here provides maximum needed information in the shortest time at the least cost within the specified time, cost, performance, reliability, and maintainability con- straints of a particular program's requirements. General test planning methods are presented and illustrated. Special types of reliability/maintain- ability tests and some applicable life distributions are given. Three types of reliability-time tests for demon- stration test planning are given and discussed in some detail. 650418 New York City and the Air Cushion Vehicle - The Chal- lenge to the Engineer. J. B. Chap- lin and W. J. Eggington, Bell Aero- systems Co. This paper discusses problems in developing the air cush- ion vehicle for passenger transporta- tion, with particular reference to the New York City area. The stages of development of the ACV are traced from its conception, through its pres- ent status, to large-scale passenger operation. An analysis is given of the relative effect of engineering ad- vances in reducing passenger fares. Results of this study show that im- provements in craft durability and power requirements are the most promising and effective engineering fields of development. It is con- cluded that the engineer has the op- portunity of developing the ACV from limited operation on selected routes to a major means of transpor- tation. 115</page><page sequence="55">650419-650426 116 650419 Multipurpose Gear Lu- bricants - Some Considerations in Selection and Application.

Sig- nificant lubricant properties are enumerated for consideration by the equipment manufacturer and the user. Pertinent customer responsibilities are detailed to permit the proper utilization of today's high perform- ance equipment with modern multi- purpose types of gear lubricants. Significant lubricant properties and performance data, much of which is based upon extensive fleet test results, are offered for the consideration of equipment manufacturers and users. 650420 The Design-Development of a Mainline Diesel Hydraulic Locomotive. H. W. Schmidt, Aleo Products, Inc. The design and de- velopment of a 4300 hp mainline diesel-hydraulic locomotive, compati- ble and able to operate in multiple leading or trailing with existing die- sel-electric locomotives, and to be serviced and maintained with the same facilities and personnel as now exists. The ultimate possible goal is a locomotive providing higher ad- hesion, lower possible continuous speed than a diesel-electric locomotive of equal horsepower per axle, and with lower maintenance on the trans- mission system. The design includes maximum number of standard ex- pendable components such as wheels, brake shoes, oil filters, air filters, drawgears, etc. The design also al- lows the replacement of any compo- nent of the power train without de- trucking or removing either the engine or transmission from the loco- motive. 650421 Review of Fuel and Lub- ricant Practices in Diesel Loco- motives in Australian Railways. D. C. Cooper, BP Australia Ltd. This paper covers the fuel and lubri- cant practices used for diesel rail traction in Australia. A comparison is made between American and Aus- tralian operating and geographical conditions supported by relevant sta- tistics. It is thought that there may be a marked change in lubricating oil type to cater for increasing opera- tional demands. 650422 What's New in Numeri- cal Control Equipment and Meth- ods. R. C. Bevis, Cincinnati Milling &amp; Grinding Machines, Inc. ; and E. F. Schloss, Cincinnati Milling Machine Co. Consumer and industry buying patterns are effecting a gradual yet striking change on the productive ca- pability of the American metalwork- ing community. In order to meet this challenge, a fresh look must be taken at the means of production with a view toward maximum cost and lead time reduction, yet permitting in- creased product flexibility. This dif- ficult assignment is being met through numerical control. This paper high- lights the current state-of-the-art and indicates trends that can be antici- pated in future years. 650423 Utilization of Tape Con- trol Machine Tools at The Miehle Co. R. L. Hogin, The Miehle Co. Numerically controlled machine tools are being used by a manufacturer of printing equipment to produce accur- ate and precisely located holes in all kinds of metals. They are producing many savings, such as in labor, tools and jigs, floor space, and are making possible the attainment of a higher degree of engineering excellence through postproduction refinement. Numerical control was not introduced without problems. Old procedures had to be changed and new ones established. Conventional machine practices had to be modified. The tool design department had to take a new approach in tooling a job that specified numerical control process- ing. One of the biggest obstacles numerical control machining was found to be machine down time, which was caused largely by elec- tronic difficulties, but mechanical and tape troubles were also factors. 650425 Current Approaches to Driver Safety Training. A. J. McKnight and R. D. Behringer, George Washington University. This paper describes the status of efforts to improve the safety of motor vehicle operation through training. The fol- lowing types of programs are de- scribed: (1) the safety components of driver education and improvement courses, (2) the remedial training of traffic violators, (3) programs utiliz- ing simulation techniques, and (4) the use of mass media such as books and films. A general lack of con- clusive evidence concerning various training approaches is noted. A greater research effort should be di- rected toward (1) better identifica- tion of means by which accidents can be anticipated and avoided, (2) methods of coping directly with driver habits and skills, and (3) tech- niques of maintaining safe driving behavior through periodic evaluation and retraining. 650426 Human Vibration Anal- ysis. F. Pradko, T. R. Orr, and R. A. Lee, Army Tank Automotive Center. A new method has been de- veloped to study the effects of vibra- tion environments upon human beings. The method is usable to as- sess the effects of random vibration, transients, or sinusoidal wave forms. It is equally effective for synthesis or analysis of applied force, effective mass, impedance, displacement or ac- celeration. The linearity of human response to vibration is established. The procedure employs the transfer function technique. Data is pre- sented describing human response to vertical motion for voluntary toler- ance and low intensity acceleration.

This paper discusses gasoline properties which affect fuel economy. It deals with (1) the available energy in the fuel as related to fuel composition and (2) the chemical and physical characteristics of the fuel as they af- fect the conversion of this energy into work. It shows that (1) the energy contents of commercial gasolines falls within a narrow range, (2) increas- ing octane number of the gasoline will not necessarily increase gasoline economy, (3) volatility is important to obtaining good mileage, and (4) gasoline must be kept free of contami- nants. 650428 Good Gasoline Mileage Is a Team Project. 0. Blomquist, White Motor Co. Good gasoline mileage is a result of a carefully de- veloped vehicle, high quality fuel, and sound maintenance. A gradual im- provement in gasoline has permitted more efficient engines. Highest en- gine efficiency is achieved by utilizing the maximum useful compression ratio, and by meticulous tailoring of carburetors, distributors, cooling sys- tems, and other components to each engine model. Because these com- ponents are closely matched and are subject to deterioration in service, good maintenance is a primary part of obtaining all of the gasoline mile- age that was built into the fleet vehi- cle. 650429 Role of Fuel Properties in Diesel Fleet Economy. H. R. Hultkrans, Mobil Oil Co. The sig- nificance of diesel fuel physical prop- erties with respect to fleet perform- ance and economy has been reviewed. Relationships between certain of the key properties are discussed, and the importance of a balanced diesel fuel described. 650430 Factors Affecting Fuel Economy in Diesel Powered Ve- hicles. J. A. Joyner, Cummins En- gine Co., Inc. The cost of fuel is a major expense item for long-haul fleet operators. There are many factors which affect fuel economy. The fol- lowing are reviewed in this paper; the operational requirements, the en- gine, the engine installation, the gearing, the driver and the mainte- nance procedures. Each item is dis- cussed and specific recommendations are made on how to improve fuel economy. Discussion: D. K.

Moerk, Jr., Victor Mfg. &amp; Gasket Co.; and F. A. Robbins, White Motor Co. This paper indi- cates the significant physical proper- ties of a gasket for high performance sealing and how these properties relate to the sealing phenomenon. Included in the paper are both theo- retical derivations and results of experimental testing. The internal combustion engine cylinder head gas- ket is the most complex of all gasket applications. This is due to the variety of seals and sealing conditions which must be achieved in a single gasket. Some of the physical char- acteristics studied for such gaskets include, Spring Rate, Stress Relaxa- tion, Torque Loss, and Permeability of current materials and elements used in these constructions. The effects of temperature, sealing stress, thickness, geometry, and engine oper- ation on the properties of gaskets are discussed. In one of the theoretical derivations, a mathematical model of a visco-elastic material is used to ex- plain the results of certain experi- mental testing. Major emphasis is placed on the spring rate and stress relaxation, which are directly related to fluctuations of sealing pressure and loss of torque which must be con- trolled in order to achieve satisfactory sealing.

Inst., Ltd. A new fuel injection system has been developed to overcome the limi- tations of the existing mechanically operated jerk pump system. In the new system, a simple pump plunger is arranged next to the injection nozzle and is operated by a piston driven by fuel under pressure released from an accumulator. This arrangement per- mits control of injection conditions over wide ranges of engine speed and load. Two forms of the new system have been developed, one for large engines and one for small engines. Their construction, development, and performance are described. The re- quirements of fuel injection systems are defined, and the extent to which the old and the new systems meet them is considered. It is concluded that the new systems will improve overall engine performance and will prove even more valuable as load and speed ranges are extended. Discussion: A. K.

The process discussed is available for use by engineers in design of proto- type work and small run or high pro- duction castings. The purpose in the use of foam as a casting pattern is to reduce pattern and core box costs to a minimum when one-piece or low vol- ume parts are required. It should al- ways be considered when weldments are discussed. Additional advantages are apparent in the reduction of de- livery time required for a finished casting. The pattern is produced in a positive form and thus allows the designer to see the actual size, shape, and design before it is cast. 117</page><page sequence="57">650434-650440 650434 (SP-272) Kinematic Anal- ysis Method - A Computer-Aided Design Analysis System.

Selby, Dow Chemical Co. The correlation of ex- tensive engine cranking data obtained by the Coordinating Research Coun- cil (CRC) with equally extensive viscometric data obtained by ASTM has shown that the low-temperature cranking characteristics of engine oils can be predicted by two high shear viscometers, the Ferranti-Shirley and the Forced-Ball (corrected for gel viscosity). The data collected also show that the extrapolated kinematic viscosity of multigraded engine oils has little or no value in predicting the low-temperature cranking character- istics of such oils. The abilities of other viscometers to correlate with the engine cranking data are also con- sidered. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650442 Development of ASTM Low Temperature Viscometric Techniques. T. W.

The need for a vis- cometer to better predict the cranking characteristics of oils in engines at low temperatures led to the develop- ment of a Reciprocating Viscometer. This paper describes steps taken in the development of this viscometer including studies made using model aircraft engines to test the feasibility of the approach. Data are presented on various test oils to show the corre- lation between engine viscosities de- termined in full scale engines and corresponding data obtained in the model aircraft engines and the Recip- rocating Viscometers. The results show that this type of viscometer has the ability to predict the low tempera- ture cranking properties of engine oils in full scale engines. Discussion: S. W. Rein, Texaco, Inc.; W. E.

Stringer, Rohm &amp; Haas Co. The contribution to measured vis- cosity at 0 F of a variety of additives used in modern engine oils has been studied using a cone-plate viscometer which correlates well with engine cranking measurements. The major contributors were found to be the base oils, the ashless dispersant, and the viscosity index (VI) improvers. In the latter case, the contribution was shown to be related to the effi- ciency of the VI improver with VI improvers of low efficiency contribut- ing substantially more than those of high efficiency. Summing the con- tributions of the additives in a given base led to close prediction of the viscosity of 0 F. 650445 Effect of Engine Opera- tion on the Viscometric Proper- ties of Multigraded Engine Oils. J. P. West and T. W. Selby, Dow Chemical Co. It has long been known from various sonic and me- chanical shear tests that most com- mercial multigraded oils suffer from a series loss in viscosity during rela- tively short periods of use. These, except in special cases, were generally regarded as inadequate. In order to conduct a meaningful study of the effect of shear degradation on poly- mer-containing oils, the authors set up an engine test. The test, over a pe- riod of several months using three engines almost daily, proved reliable beyond all expectations. Tests of 15 different multigrade oils showed that seven did not qualify as SAE 30 oils after a running period equivalent to about 385 miles. All the remaining oils showed significant losses in vis- cosity in the same period. The effect of shear degradation on the 0 F mea- sured viscosity was varied. Most of the oils showed a proportionately lower viscosity loss measured at 0°F than at 210 F. Complicating factors indicate that the area merits further investigation. 650446 Role of the Engine Oil in Cold Weather Starting. G. K. Vick, Esso Res. &amp; Engrg. Co. An examination of the background his- tory and literature in the field of cold engine cranking is presented. As a result of this review, it is concluded that a maximum critical engine oil viscosity exists which, when exceeded, will prevent engine starting. The present SAE Viscosity Classification System, which covers W grades based on ASTM viscosity-temperature extra- polation, is applicable to straight mineral oils with respect to ease of engine starting but can be in error (too high or too low) for multi- graded oils containing polymeric VI additives. Any laboratory instru- ment proposed to serve as a new basis for the SAE W grades must be judged on its ability to predict engine per- formance. To date, it appears that the L-49-663 engine cranking re- search technique developed by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) represents the best approach for generating data on oils in engines which can be used to judge the ability of laboratory instruments to classify oils with regard to startability. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 119</page><page sequence="59">650447-650453 650447 An Analytical Method for Optimizing the Scavenging Process of Uniflow Two-Cycle Diesel Engines. Y. Hayashi, Nis- san Diesel Co., Ltd.; and W. E. Meyer, Pennsylvania State Univ. A mathematical model of the scavenging process of uniflow two-cycle diesel engines is proposed. It assumes that certain general characteristics of a particular engine type are known. With a number of simplifying as- sumptions, the scavenging process and engine performance can then be analyzed by means of a digital com- puter. Experimental results are used to demonstrate the validity of the analysis. A number of scavenging system variables are investigated and a combination is proposed which should give optimum performance. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650448 Study of Engine Breath- ing Characteristics. C. H. Wolge- muth and D. R. Olson, Pennsylvania State Univ. A nondimensional re- presentation for a four stroke spark ignition engine was obtained that in- cluded the transient charging and ex- haust effects. Two basic advantages accrued from this approach; the de- sign and operating parameters that evolved from the nondimensional ap- proach are truly basic in nature, which makes the computer solution more universally applicable to all engines. The inclusion of the tran- sient effects made the representation more realistic and of particular value in the study of engine breathing prob- lems. The effect of valve timing, cam design, valve dimensions, and inlet temperature on engine perform- ance were studied with the computer model. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650449 Diesel Engine Cycle Analysis of Relationships of Fuel Injection to Fuel Compression Ignition Characteristics and Best Fuel Utilization. H. A. Cook, Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc. Control of combustion by fuel injec- tion is a basic part of the original concept of the diesel engine. The analysis presented shows how a dig- ital computer engine with automatic compression ignition is used to in- vestigate some of the many factors involved in the control of compres- sion ignition and burning of fuels. The digital engine, including an auto- matic digital combustion process and digitalized fuel characteristics, ap- pears to be the only practical means to coordinate all the inter-related fac- tors involved in the simple diesel en- gine with no ignition system. This digital engine materially aids in prop- erly interpreting engine test data to show the correct steps for obtaining optimum engine development. This paper presents the progress made on one contemporary digital engine in the field of automatic combustion by compression. The achievement of this automatic burning feature repre- sents a vital step needed to allow the combustion process to react to the many interrelated factors, such as engine design, operating conditions, fuel physical properties, chemical fuel ignition delay characteristics, and the complex compression situa- tion resulting from injecting fuel over a period of time which may include the burning period. 650450 Computer Programs to Determine the Relationship Be- tween Pressure Flow, Heat Re- lease, and Thermal Load in Diesel Engines. G. Woschni, Mas- chinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG. A number of computer programs were established by the research depart- ment of the Augsburg works of M.A.N. to provide information on the development of diesel engines. This paper reports on two such programs. One of them aims at determining heat release flow from the indicated pres- sure diagram, the other at calculating pressure and temperature flow and thermal load from engine dimensions only, assuming a simple heat release diagram. Some results of these cal- culations are presented. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650451 Development and Evalu- ation of the Simulation of Com- pression Ignition Engines. K. J. McAulay, International Harvester Co., Constr. Equip. Div.; G. L. Bor- man, P. S. Myers and 0. A. Uyehara, Wisconsin Univ.; T. Wu and S. K. Chen, International Harvester Co. The first part of the paper deals with the mathematical model and computer program for simulating a compres- sion-ignition engine. The various assumptions used and the effects of these assumptions on the results are discussed. The second part of the paper evaluates results of the engine simulation program by comparisons with experimental data and with other simplified cycle calculations. The comparisons with experimental data include motoring, part load, and full load data for a speed range of 1400- 3200 rpm. The simulation results show good agreement with experi- mental pressure-volume diagrams. The computed trends of volumetric efficiency, heat rejection, and metal part temperatures show reasonable agreement with experimental data. Discussion: W. L. Brown, Jr., Cater- pillar Tractor Co.; F.

Tsao, South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Tech- nology; and S. M. Wu, Wisconsin Univ. This paper sets up a mathe- matical model for measuring end-gas temperatures in spark ignition en- gines and the compression tempera- tures in compression ignition engines. The model is based on a modified thermodynamic equation, for which the nonlinear least square method is used to fit the parameters. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 120</page><page sequence="60">650454-650461 650454 How Big Is Overseas? W. L. McGinnis and W. G. Dohan, Ford Motor Co. During recent years, America has relinquished its dominance in the world's automotive registrations. Now the combined areas "outside the U.S.A.," known as "overseas," possess a greater number of cars and trucks than contained within the United States. Projec- tions up to 1975 indicate growth po- tentials in automotive registrations overseas will continue being greater than in the U.S.A. The anticipated automotive growth overseas will necessitate maximum attention of qualified engineering personnel by which to achieve local content re- quirements. Local content require- ments are very important to the automotive industry because they are the tool by which many governments control automotive imports and man- ufacturing 650455 Development and Test- ing of Products for Export. E. D. Heins, Chrysler Corp., Export-Im- port Div. Many special items of equipment are required for U.S. vehicles in overseas areas in order to meet local operating conditions and laws. Foreign laws have placed heavy emphasis on locally manufac- tured parts. This paper deals with the role of the export automotive en- gineer as it relates to the development and testing of products for export. The many and varied problems which the engineer is called upon to solve are discussed. 650456 International Legal Re- quirements, Safety and Operat- ing Specifications. W. K. Schmidt, Daimler-Benz AG. The need for uniform legal requirements cover- ing motor vehicles is evident when one considers the existing disparities in regulations not only between na- tions but within the states comprising a country (for example, the United States ) . Some of these differences are discussed, including measures taken by manufacturers to conform with the laws of the countries to which they export their products. It is stressed that some degree of uniform- ity in this area would not only be economical to both the producer and customer, but would also result in additional safety for all concerned. 650457 Product Development and Testing in Latin America. A. D. Efthimides, Ford Motor Co. S.A. This is a presentation of auto- motive development and testing in Latin American countries now in the midst of an industrial revolution. It describes problems in testing which stem from shortages of technical per- sonnel in most categories, low levels of man-hour efficiency, and a scarcity of material and equipment. Methods used to solve these problems are given. Existing conditions relating to local content and commonization, and their influence on the techniques and improvisations required in those countries are discussed. The paper also reviews vendor philosophy with respect to the actual need for testing. 650458 Automation in an Engine Laboratory. A. Larborn, Volvo AB. This paper describes an engine laboratory where rationalization and automation is developed to a com- paratively high level. Function test beds are arranged mainly for accurate measurements and flexible conditions. Endurance test beds feature flexible programmed cycling, automatic data recording and test supervision. All test beds include extensive arrange- ments for automatic handling of emergency situations with maximum safety for test engines and equipment. Endurance test beds simulate road conditions to a high degree and show considerable savings in test time and running cost compared to vehicle testing of engines. Examples of cor- relation with road testing and statis- tics from equipment reliability are presented. 650459 Development and Test- ing of Vehicles in Australia. L. T. Bandt, Ford Motor Co. of Aus- tralia, Ltd. This presentation de- scribes the development and testing of automotive passenger and com- mercial vehicles in Australia. Infor- mation on roads, climate, local con- tent requirements, existing tax laws and the importation duty applicable to imported knocked down vehicles from the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan are presented. Australian industry production versus importation is dis- cussed. Included is a discussion of the unique requirements for vehicles in Australia and the testing tech- niques devised to assure achievement of satisfactory vehicles for this mar- ket. 650460 Gas Turbines for Emer- gency Vehicles. L. H. Williams and K. W. Porter, Boeing Co., Tur- bine Div. Gas turbines have demon- strated their practicability in trucks, particularly those needing high horse- power and light weight combined with agility and reliability. These are the primary requirements of emergency vehicles such as fire fight- ing pumpers and crash trucks. Sev- eral installations powered by Boeing gas turbines are described, and com- parisons to reciprocating engines are made. For vehicles of high power/ weight ratio, the built-in torque con- verter feature of two-shaft gas tur- bines provides the automatic trans- mission feature that is needed for high density traffic operation or for hilly terrain. Trends in gas turbine design are briefly mentioned along with other system requirements for emergency vehicles. 650461 Turbine-Powered Fire Apparatus - Vehicle Manufactur- ers' Viewpoint. R. W. French, Amer. La France Auto. Div., Sterling Precision Corp. Application to data of several turbine powered fire fight- ing vehicles has indicated that overall engine performance, starting, accel- eration, gradability, and pumping ability are beyond expectations. Sev- 121</page><page sequence="61">650462-650467 eral such vehicles which have been built and are either in operation or undergoing evaluation tests are de- scribed, including some of the major problems encountered during con- struction. Areas which still require further development are outlined. It is believed that with continued experi- ence and increased consumer demand the gas turbine engine will eventually replace the piston version as a vehicu- lar prime mover. 650462 Turbo-Chief - San Fran- cisco's Fire Department Turbine Powered Fire Apparatus. A. M. Flaherty, San Francisco City Shops. For the past four years the San Fran- cisco Fire Department has been oper- ating an American La France triple combination fire pump, which is pow- ered by a Boeing 502 gas turbine en- gine. The original cost of this power unit is higher than that of a gasoline engine of equal power, but the turbine unit does have advantages, such as: much lighter weight; better accelera- tion and high climbing ability; no choking or warmup period is re- quired - although the turbine re- quires 20-30 sec before the apparatus can roll out of the door, compared with 10-15 sec for conventionally powered apparatus; and no cooling system is required. Certain other claims for the turbine-powered unit proved to be something less than true. For example, the supposedly simpler ignition system caused some difficulty, until improved igniter plugs were de- veloped. In general, maintenance costs of the turbine units were high. It is felt that many of the bugs experi- enced in the first unit will be elimi- nated in the new engine being de- veloped by Boeing. 650463 Comfort Packages for Diverse Passenger Car Objec- tives. F. G. Olsen, Ford Div., Ford Motor Co. The vehicle concept dic- tates the size and motif of the interior package which, integrated with the chassis package, comprises the over- all vehicle package. Within this vehicle concept, the package engineer must package the driver and passen- gers in comfort and safety. Using an industry-wide approved manikin, the engineer designs the seating arrangement with optimum utility within the parameters as defined. This paper emphasizes the importance of the work of the package engineer within the ever increasing market for new concept vehicles. 650464 Automobile Driver Eye Position. J. F. Meldrum, Ford Motor Co. A driver eye position survey (involving over 2300 subjects and three 1963 convertible cars - Ford, Plymouth, and Chevrolet), was held to provide the automobile indus- try with standardized data on driver eye location. This project was sug- gested by the Manikin Subcommittee of the SAE Body Engineering Com- mittee, and was carried out as a joint industry effort with personnel from that Subcommittee. Coordinate an- thropometric measurements of eye position and top-of-head were re- corded on film, using a special photo- grammetric technique. Data were smoothed into ellipse-shaped tangent cutoff percentile contours referenced to car body inch-lines and to points on the manikin. Results revealed a new shape to the driver's eye position zone, compared to the area outlined in SAE J906, Glazing Manual. Discussion: P. D.

Results of a psychophysical experi- ment indicated that "jerk" (that is, rate of change of fore and aft accel- eration) associated with the clutch- actuated gear ratio change in an auto- matic transmission correlated well with subjective evaluations of shift- feel. A portable device, the GMR Jerkmeter, was constructed to mea- sure acceleration and jerk during on- the-road evaluations of transmission performance. Techniques for using Jerkmeter data in automatic transmission fluid research and development projects are discussed. Examples are given of the use of Jerkmeter data to: 1. Produce a detailed characteriza- tion of shift performance. 2. Measure effect of fluid on shift performance. 3. Study effect of changes in fluid characteristics with use. Discussion: C. Albertson, Borg- Warner Corp. ; author's closure. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650466 Tailoring Automatic Transmission Fluid Shift Quality in the Laboratory. N. A. Nann and F. H. Pinchbeck, Texaco, Inc. The influence of lubricant formula- tion and service degradation on auto- matic transmission shift quality was studied in full scale transmission cycling tests. Fluid frictional de- gradation was found to follow a well defined pattern. This pattern is in- fluenced by fluid formulation as well as transmission environment. Both fluid oxidation and selective additive degradation affect the rate of progres- sion through this pattern. 650467 Responsibility of Quality Control for Achieving Product Reliability. R. M. Miller, Ameri- can Motors Corp. The responsibility of quality control for achieving prod- uct reliability depends on communi- cation and motivation. The quality control engineer, using statistical probability, technical knowledge, and practical shop experience, must evalu- ate current performance against relia- bility goals and communicate his findings to all concerned activities. Then the entire quality control activ- ity must effectively motivate all mem- bers of the organization to meet these goals. 122</page><page sequence="62">650468-650476 At American Motors, incoming material control, manufacturing proc- ess control, and field failure analysis are being used to accomplish these objectives. Incoming material con- trol assures supplier maintenance of engineering specifications. Then, manufacturing process control as- sures maintenance of engineering specifications to preserve integrity of the design. Finally, field failure analysis determines the degree of suc- cess of the efforts. 650468 New Inspection Tech- niques. T. A. Luther, Sheffield Corp. New inspection techniques which increase reliability and reduce costs are being used today. The problem of fast, accurate cam mea- surement is being solved. The gage block, as a standard, is being re- placed. Operator errors in assembly matching are being eliminated. Vis- ual and audible inspections are being automated. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650469 So You Want Better Quality. L. W. Tobin, Jr., Ford Motor Co. The management tech- niques described show how quality can be improved on a scheduled and controlled basis. Key considerations are an understanding of what is meant by quality, what are the causes of poor quality, the means for "put- ting a number on quality," and the development of a system of numerical and administrative controls for man- agement's use. Management's role in supplying company motivation and utilization of the controls provided by the product quality problem con- trol system is discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650470 An Aerodynamic Look at Automotive Radiators. F. N. Beauvais, Ford Motor Co. An aero- dynamic approach to improving liquid-to-air heat exchanger fin design is described. Radiator fin models, 10 times size, are tested in a special low turbulence wind tunnel. Hot- wire anemometer techniques are used to measure air velocity profiles, boun- dary layer thickness, and turbulence within the fin passages. These data in turn are related to heat transfer coefficients. Visual studies of flows are also made, using smoke and china- clay. This system provides an un- derstanding of how a compact fin surface performs and gives a basis for systematic design of heat exchangers. Application of the technique has led to significant improvements in radia- tor fin performance. 650471 New Features in Recent General Motors Radiators. P. K. Beatenbough, Harrison Radiator Div., GMC. Advances in General Motors Radiator design over a ten year pe- riod are surveyed. Various changes affecting cooling performance have reduced radiator core volumes by as much as 50% and structural designs have been evolved to permit operation at higher internal pressures without proportionate increases in metal gages. A new cradle mounting con- figuration for certain types of instal- lations and a new crossflow radiator system particularly advantageous on larger engines have been introduced. 650472 The Ford Flex Fan. R. L. Cassidy, Eng. &amp; Fdy. Div., and T. Z. White, Ford Motor Co. An en- gine cooling fan having flexible steel blades whose pitch varies with engine speed has been developed to replace the viscous clutch used in many vehicles today. By controlling the geometric shape of the fan, maximum air flow is provided at low speeds, and noise and horsepower are reduced at high speeds. Extensive stress analy- sis and material development were necessary to insure adequate service life. The final design was proved out with over one million miles of in-vehicle fleet testing before release. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650474 Recent Developments in Penetration Resistance of Wind- shield Glass. J. C. Widman, Ford Motor Co. A twofold improvement in penetration resistance of laminated safety glass for use in vehicle wind- shields has been achieved.

Present windshield material and the new safety glazings are compared. Discussion: L. M . Patrick, Wayne State University. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650475 Citizens Band Radio Helps the Motorist. A. F. Under- wood, General Motors Res. Labs. The use of citizens band radio to help the motorist is discussed. The type of equipment available is described, with particular emphasis on transis- torized sets. The author explains how CB works and discusses some of the problems associated with its op- eration. 650476 H.E.L.P. for Motorists, A New Concept in Highway Safety. A. C. Doty, Jr., Automobile Mfrs. Assn. In early 1965, the automobile industry announced the Highway Emergency Locating Plan, or H.E.L.P., a cooperative nationwide program in the public service to pro- vide a means of communication for motorists in distress. Initial opera- tion of the H.E.L.P. program utilizes one of the channels assigned to the Citizens Radio Service and approxi- mately 1000 monitoring stations manned by more than . 20, 000 volun- teers are currently participating on a nationwide basis. A petition has been filed with the Federal Com- munications Commission asking for the establishment of the H.E.L.P. Radio Service, and for assignment of two "clear channels" that will assure interference-free communications, and will also allow development of new communications concepts which could lead to further increases in safety and convenience for drivers. 123</page><page sequence="63">650477-650483 124 650477 (SP-270) Powerplants for Industrial and Commercial Vehicles - A Look At Tomorrow. E. J. Gay, Thompson Ramo Wool- dridge, Inc., and Associated Octel Co. Ltd. Today, nearly all city and inter- city buses are diesel powered, as are many heavy-duty trucks. Heavy fuel taxes are also helping to make the diesel attractive in the lighter truck field. Gas turbines are being studied and developed for commercial and industrial vehicles by several manu- facturers. This increasing use of diesels and possible operation of tur- bine vehicles will change our nation from being a gasoline-burning coun- try to one that also uses large quanti- ties of kerosene and light distillates - already in demand for aircraft jet engines. 650478 (SP-270) Tomorrow's Spark-Ignition Engine. M. J. Tauschek, Thompson Ramo Wool- dridge, Inc. This paper deals with the commercial version of the spark- ignition engine. Methods are dis- cussed whereby future engines may be increased in horsepower output and reduced in weight and size. Variable compression methods, charge stratifi- cation, fuel injection, and turbocharg- ing are discussed as means of increas- ing engine output. Unconventional engines are discussed, but it is felt they do not have any appreciable ap- plication to commercial spark-igni- tion of the future. It is concluded that commercial spark-ignition of tomorrow will remain essentially as we know it today except that it will be more compact and will weigh less per horsepower or per cubic foot. 650479 (SP-270) Tomorrow's Diesel - What Will It Offer? H. G. Holler, Caterpillar Tractor Co. After reviewing the present state of diesel engine design art as applied to vehicle applications, the paper an- alyzes future application require- ments and outlines possible paths of engine development. In general, fu- ture requirements demand engines of higher output, lighter weight, better fuel economy, and smoke-free opera- tion. A better understanding of vehicle load demands and careful matching of engine and drive-line will be required. Reference to extensive recent research developments shows that the diesel engine industry will be prepared to meet this challenge to provide the customer the best possible engine in terms of return on his in- vestment. 650480 (SP-270) Gas Turbines in Future Industrial Vehicles. H. J. Wood, H. J. Wood &amp; Associates. In spite of dominance in aircraft and serious penetration of non-vehicle in- dustrial markets, gas turbine power- plants are now found only in a very few industrial vehicles. It has been necessary to evolve sophisticated tur- bines to challenge diesel and gasoline reciprocators on an economic basis, since no overwhelming functional ad- vantages can be credited to vehicle turbines (in contrast with aircraft en- gines). With progress in recent years, this "break-even" point has been reached in some market areas, and the next decade, with continuing increases in gas temperature and stage pressure ratios, will see a rapid broad- ening of the turbine-powered vehicle market.

This paper defines the important consider- ations facing the chassis designer in selecting a power plant for a heavy duty vehicle. An assessment of the merits and demerits of optional ap- proaches to the problem is made, and future trends in the factors determin- ing power plant selection are dis- cussed. 650482 (SP-270) Performance and Economic Objectives for Over-tbe-Road Powerplants of the Future. G. R. Beardsley, Ford Motor Co., Ford Div. This paper projects the performance and eco- nomic objectives of over-the-road powerplants in the decade of the 1970's. The influencing factors for this projection are trends in: intercity ton miles of freight, size and weight legislation, the interstate highway system maximum legal speed laws, and operating costs of interstate car- riers. These factors set the stage and establish the horizon for over-the- road vehicles of tomorrow. The ob- jectives for performance and eco- nomics of future powerplants may be projected with a crystal ball, or with a detailed reflection of the growth and trends of the transportation industry. To provide this reflection, as well as perspective, an historical review of the influencing factors will be de- veloped to establish the guidelines of the future. This study may give a means for measuring the value of fu- ture powerplants in terms of per- formance and economics; it will not present design advantages of various types of powerplants. The informa- tion presented deals with the major over-the-road applications, and no consideration has been given to spe- cialized vehicles that may well gross up to 170,000 pounds, in the period of 1970 to 1980.

J. M. Cherrie, Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc., Valve Div. Passenger car engine poppet valves operate in a critical temperature range by virtue of their function and environment. Certain engine design parameters such as the shape of the valve head, cylinder head valve layout, stem-guide relationship, fuel-air ratio, and compression ratio exert a direct influence on their tem- perature and performance. In opera- tion, abnormal combustion phenom- ena may further increase the normally high valve temperature. This paper describes the effect of these factors on valve temperature. 650486 Paints and Elastomers Require Better Protection Against Industrial and Organic Fall-out. A. J. Lapointe, Glidden Co.; and E. A. Petri, Ford Motor Co. Protective coatings have recently come into ex- tensive use for preventing damage to car finishes and other exposed areas of cars in transit or in exterior stor- age. Fluid leakage and many air- borne contaminants such as industrial wastes, insects and insecticides and mineral residues contribute to this damage. Spray coatings are very effective against iron base fall-out and other solid soils, but have a limited effect on other destructive deposits. This paper discussed the development of new coatings that give increased protection to paints and elastomers and which will be safer to use on incompletely cured finishes. 650487 Advances in Sunlight and Chemical Resistance of Textiles and Plastics. B. F. Faris, du Pont de Nemours /E. I./ &amp; Co., Inc. Re- cent automobile styling trends have accentuated the importance of improv- ing performance standards for the fibers used in the interiors and trim parts of cars. The complexity of the problem involved in predicting light durability and weathering of textiles and plastics used inside and outside of automobiles, by means of labora- tory tests, is discussed. The primary cause for light degradation of fibers is ultraviolet rays with wavelengths between 2900-4000 Angstroms. It is evident that UV stabilizers have not been developed to a degree which can render most plastic polymers imper- vious to sunlight. However, improve- ments in this area are being made and considerable work is being carried out to upgrade present tests so that they can predict the effect of any atmospheric severity-time relationship on a polymer. 650488 Instrumentation Tech- iques for Brake Noise Investi- gation. B. R. Teitelbaum and C. B. Sung, Bendix Corp., Res. Labs. Div.; and W. C. Suttle, Bendix Corp., Prod- ucts Auto. Div. Lining friction char- acteristics and brake structure vibra- tion modes were selected as critical areas to be investigated experimen- tally in a continuing brake noise in- vestigation. A friction test machine adapted from an industry standard design was constructed to provide friction data in the low range of slid- ing speeds and at elevated tempera- tures. The vibration instrumentation employed two methods: proximity pickups and small accelerometers. The latter method proved to be par- ticularly useful. The application of the vibration instrumentation to a case of drum brake squeal is de- scribed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650489 Studying Brake Noise with Ultra Slow Motion Photog- raphy. J. E. Gieck, World Bestos Co. By drastically slowing down and magnifying the vibration of compo- nents associated with brake noise, macrographic ultra slow motion pho- tography affords a valuable tool to study the causes of this phenomenon. In combination with tape recording techniques, results obtained substan- tiate the concept of a "slip-stick" con- dition producing noise, and suggest a mechanism, related to the natural frequency of the stationary elements of the brake system, to explain the cause of at least one kind of brake noise. 650490 Today's and Tomorrow's Automotive Glass.

R. N. Dodge, Michigan Univ. The prob- lem of the rotating cylindrical shell under the action of a stationary point load is treated in detail as a means of approximating the action of a tire while rolling. Comparison is made between calculated and measured load deflection curves, using a model very similar to the postulated cylindrical shell. There is reasonable correla- tion between such dynamic load de- flection characteristics as predicted from the model and obtained experi- mentally, so that some support is lent to the eventual application of this model as an analog for real pneumatic tire studies. 125</page><page sequence="65">650492-650499 650492 Plane Vibration Charac- teristics of a Pneumatic Tire Model. J. T. Tielking, Michigan Univ. An elastically supported cylin- drical shell is used to represent the motion of a pneumatic tire in the plane of the wheel. This is an at- tempt to utilize shell motion as an analog to the plane motion of the pneumatic tire tread. The idea is suggested by the constructional fea- tures of a pneumatic tire, both from the point of view of mass distribution and the distribution of elastic stiff- ness. The equations of motion for such a model are derived by reference to conventional energy methods. In this derivation, the influence of inter- nal pressure and elastic support of the shell is taken into account. The fre- quencies are determined as functions of the mode shape, and it is shown that nodes, as well as antinodes, ro- tate with an angular velocity some- what less than the angular velocity of the rotating pneumatic tire, to an ex- tent determined by the particular mode shape in question. It is hoped that these phenomena may be useful in explaining or understanding some vibratory or acoustic interactions be- tween a tire and suspension system. 650493 Rolling Tire Under Load. S. K. Clark, Michigan Univ. This paper presents methods for calculat- ing dynamic contact patch areas of an elastically supported cylindrical shell used to model the dynamic roll- ing of a loaded pneumatic tire. These areas are shown to be influenced con- siderably by rolling velocity, con- structional parameters of the tire, and its loss characteristics. Dynamic pressure distributions within contact patch areas are obtained analytically, and the techniques involved are given. The shell is used as a basis for cal- culating load carrying and drag prop- erties of a pneumatic tire so that various tire parameters may be ap- proximated. The results given here are typical of information obtainable from such a model. 650494 Corrosion of Automobile Bodies. G. F. Bush, Ford Motor Co. Corrosion of automobile bodies is caused by electrochemical action from a hostile environment. Preven- tion of corrosion is complicated by factors of environment, design, manu- facturing, and inherent characteristics of materials. These factors are dis- cussed in some detail, as are the prob- lems generated by new materials such as galvanized steel and zinc rich prim- ers. Various methods of imparting corrosion resistance are considered as well as those finally adopted. Elec- trocoating appears to approach the ideal protection. 650495 Proposed Legislation - Its Effect on Hydraulic Brake Systems. R. A. Goepfrich, Bendix Corp., Bendix Prod. Auto. Div. Regulatory bodies, both Federal and State, are currently very active in pro- posing new brake regulations in the interest of safety. Some have al- ready been enacted and many more are sure to come. They will contain many "firsts" in brake legislation. Some of it will be good and some bad. It is certain that some of it will neces- sitate a réévaluation of existing brake systems while others will require the development of new components. The automotive industry should do all it can to promote legislation which is based on sound engineering prin- ciples. 650496 Current and Proposed Legislation - Its Effects on Com- mercial Vehicle Air Brake Sys- tem Development. E. T. Andrews, Bendix-Westinghouse Auto, Air Brake Co. Many new air brake component designs and brake system develop- ments for commercial vehicles are a direct result of state and federal cur- rent and proposed legislation. Air brake systems are more complex where brake laws specify operating function of the equipment rather than vehicle brake performance. Steady improvement in brakes and brake sys- tems will continue as we establish performance standards of brake con- trol and braking effectiveness. 650497 Ford 427 Cubic Inch Single Overhead Cam Engine. N. W. Faustyn and J. Eastman, Ford Motor Co. The Ford 427 cu in. V-8 single overhead camshaft engine de- velops 616 bhp at 7000 rpm. It is based on a 427 cu in. push-rod engine already in production and the 255 cu in. 1964 "Indianapolis" engine with dual overhead camshafts. The hemi- spherical combustion chamber af- fords optimum valve size and ar- rangement, and provides the most efficient combustion process and port design. As far as possible, existing engine components were retained, being refined, when necessary. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650498 Transistorized Ignition for High Speed Gasoline Engines. J. W. Sharpe, Joseph Lucas /Electri- cal/ Ltd. The high-speed perform- ance of the conventional multicylin- der coil ignition system is limited bý the reduced contact dwell times with increasing speed, and by the mechan- ical limitations of cam operated con- tact breakers. The introduction of semiconductor devices, and their con- tinued development, has enabled a racing eight-cylinder contactless igni- tion system to be produced, capable of providing ignition for engine speeds up to 15,000 rpm. This sys- tem is described, along with a transis- tor assisted contacts system and a con- tactless system for conventional ve- hicles. 650499 Industrial Gas Turbine Fuel Controls. L. Andreoni, Wood- ward Governor Co. A group of in- dustrial gas turbine fuel controls has recently been developed which shows considerable promise for use on in- dustrial gas turbines. The basic de- sign philosophy was to provide fuel controls consisting of fuel metering valves and standard industrial gov- ernors to meet the majority of indi- vidual customer requirements. These 126</page><page sequence="66">650500-650506 new metering valves schedule fuel flow as a function of compressor dis- charge pressure, and include flow schedule biases by inlet temperature and turbine temperature, and adjust- ments for fuel specific gravity and Btu content. 650500 Propane Natural Gas Fuel System for Gas Turbines. D. J. Newton and B. W. Lancee, Trans Canada Pipe Lines, Ltd. Com- bustion tests utilizing liquid propane have sucessfully demonstrated that this fuel can be burned in a natural gas turbine combustion system, pro- vided the liquid does not vaporize in the fuel nozzle. Procedures for noz- zle design are given and modifica- tions of the existing natural gas fuel system for dual-fuel application are discussed. 650501 Requirements versus Cost - Small Controls. R. G. Moore and R. W. McGinnis, Bendix Corp., Bendix Prod. Aerospace Div. The problem of scaling down fuel control components for small (1000 hp or less) gas turbine engines and the tradeoff of cost versus perform- ance is discussed. A comparison of design approaches versus require- ments is presented to illustrate the type of compromises that must be considered. The effect of engine de- sign requirements is presented in terms of control complexity and cost. Specific examples of design and the effect on cost of various requirements are discussed in detail. The ex- amples of compromise versus cost are presented to illustrate "cost effective- ness" of performance requirements and a general method of how lower cost may be achieved. 650502 A Forced Vortex Pump for High Speed, High Pressure, Low Flow Applications. T. Lock, Borg-Warner Corp., Pesco Prod. Div. This paper reviews a simple forced vortex pump design that has demon strated usefulness in satisfying the unusual requirements of propulsion systems for aircraft and rocket mo- tors. A simplified theory of design is presented and expanded. Theo- retical and actual performance curves along with sketches and photographs of this type of pump are presented. This pump with its small size, light weight, high operating speed and simplicity of design establishes itself as a centrifugal type pump in a range of flows and pressures normally con- sidered to be the domain of larger, heavier, more costly and complex positive displacement pumps. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650503 A Mach 3 plus Aircraft Fuel Pump. R. W. Scott, Bendix Corp., Bendix Prod. Aerospace Div. The severe temperatures encountered in aircraft at speeds above Mach 3 have created a need for highly effi- cient use of the fuel supply on board the aircraft as a heat sink for the cool- ing system. Since the fuel tempera- ture limitations and the heat rejection characteristics of the present fixed displacement fuel pumps represent in- efficiencies in the system, the use of higher efficiency variable displace- ment piston type fuel pumps is an- alyzed. The effect of this on the heat rejection of each engine pump is shown to be a reduction 209,000 BTU during a typical flight. Because of the high temperature pumping capa- bilities of the piston type pump an increase in allowable fuel temperature to the pump to 500° F is suggested. This would make available a major increase in the heat sink capacity of the fuel system. The design of such a pump is shown to be practical and within the present state of the art. The effect of the change on the fuel control system is moderate and re- quires no new or untried techniques. 650504 All-Fluid Devices and Their Application to Gas Turbine Control. R. J. Reilly, Honeywell, Inc. This paper presents the basic operating principles of fluid sensing and control devices. A closed loop gas turbine control system utilizing these devices has been implemented in breadboard form. Since this control concept does not rely on pre-sched- uled control parameters, complexity is reduced. The feasibility of this con- trol concept has been demonstrated by operation of a General Electric J-85 engine on fluid control between idle and 100 percent power settings. Discussion: H.

Uyehara, Wisconsin Univ. The infrared radiation method of compression and end-gas temperature measurement was applied to the prob- lem of measuring gas temperatures up to the time of knock. Pressure data were taken for each run on a CFR engine with mixtures of isooc- tane and n-heptane under both knock- ing and nonknocking conditions. Main engine parameters studied were the intake pressure, intake tempera- ture, and engine speed. The rate and extent of chemical energy release were calculated from the temperature and pressure histories using an en- ergy balance. The computed rates of chemical energy release were corre- lated to a chain-type kinetic model. Discussion: A. R. Rogowski, Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology; C. Wal- cutt, Ethyl Corp.; J. T.

Knock in gaso- line engines is due to an explosion in the preflame gases. Records of si- multaneous light emission, pressure, and ionization signals require this interpretation. Before the occur- rence of the knock pressure pulse, the 127</page><page sequence="67">650507-650512 128 pressure-time curves for the knock- ing cycles showed the same mean values and variations in pressure and crankangle time as with the non- knocking cycles. The pressure pulse was accompanied by simultaneous emission of light from a window and the triggering of a nearby ionization gap. The pressure pulse appeared to attenuate while traversing the cham- ber at essentially sonic velocity to a remotely located pressure pickup. Discussion: C. F.

The composi- tion of a burned mixture of air and hydrocarbons must reflect the air-fuel ratio of the original mixture. This paper shows that the air-fuel ratio can be calculated by an equation that involves only fuel composition and exhaust gas composition. For this calculation, the hydrocarbon content of the combusted mixture has been measured with a flame ionization de- tector as a carbon counter. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650508 Effects of Multiple Intro- duction of Fuel of Preflame Re- actions in a Compression Ignition Engine. C. P. Gupta, Roorkee Univ.; J. H. Shipinski, P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Wisconsin Univ. Cylinder pressure change caused by preliminary introduction of fuel in a compression-ignition engine including introduction during the intake stroke is measured in both a prechamber and an open chamber engine. Values of AP and AUf obtained are pre- sented for variation of engine operat- ing conditions such as engine speed, intake temperature, intake pressure, and compression ratio. Cetane num- ber, volatility, and quantity of pre- liminary fuel were also varied. The results show that if the preliminary fuel is injected sufficiently early it passes through two distinct stages of exothermic reactions separated by an induction period during which the reaction rate is low. The prelimi- nary fuel, by virtue of its longer residence time, completes the re- quired sequence of physical and chemical transformations during the compression stroke. Disucssion: F. B.

Stark- man and H. K. Newhall, California Univ. The influence of nonequilib- rium in the expansion gases of spark ignition engines has been studied theoreticaly to determine how power output and exhaust gas composition might be affected. Comparing a gas which is frozen in composition dur- ing expansion with a composition which continuously is in equilibrium shows the difference in expansion work can be as large as 10%. Maxi- mum influence is in the fuel-air ratio range of chemically correct mixture. It was found that carbon monoxide and nitric oxide concentrations in the exhaust more nearly reflect the frozen composition than the equilibrium ex- pansion. This is particularly true for the range of mixture ratios - from lean to chemically correct. Discussion: D. B. Wimmer, Phillips Petroleum Co. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650510 Spontaneous Ignition of Iso-Octane Air Mixtures Under Steady Flow Conditions. W. C. Burwell, United Aircraft Corp.; and D. R. Olson, Pennsylvania State Univ., Mech. Engrg. Dept. The thermochemical changes occurring prior to spontaneous ignition were investigated for homogeneous mix- tures of 2,2,4 trimethylpentane (iso- octane) and air in a steady flow ap- paratus of unique design. Measure- ments were also made of the ignition times of these mixtures over a range of pressures, temperatures, and fuel- air ratios. Most of the observable thermodynamic and chemical changes occurred in the last 10-25% of the ignition period. Principal among these changes were thermal decom- position of the iso-octane to form iso- butylene and probably isobutane; the appearance of significant quantities of propylene, ethylene, methane, hy- drogen, carbon monoxide, and car- bon dioxide; and a temperature rise of from about 200 to 500 F. Most significant among the results was the observation that the preignition changes for the entire range of con- ditions tested correlate with a nor- malized reaction time. Discussion: E. B.

The properties of commercially available electrodeposited films, as well as films presently being developed in the lab- oratory, are discussed in this paper. New techniques being introduced to the electrocoating industry are also described. The properties of a one coat white electrocoat enamel over phosphate treated steel, presently under laboratory development are presented; this type of product is now in the process of scale-up. 650512 Thermal Crazing of Ano- dic Coatings on Aluminum. C. E. Michelson, Olin Mathieson Chemi- cal Corp. The effect of several ano- dizing variables on the development of crazing during heating of anodized aluminum was studied. Coating thickness, degree of hydration, and anodizing temperature were found to exert an important influence on craz- ing at a given temperature. Increas- ing the time and temperature of heat- ing the anodic coating increased the degree of crazing. Results demon- strated the adverse effect of crazing on the performance of the anodic coating in the CASS test.</page><page sequence="68">650513-650518 650513 Measuring Appearance Characteristics of Anodized Alu- minum Automotive Trim. W. H. Tingle, Alcoa Res. Labs., and D. J. George, Alcoa Process Dev. Labs., Aluminum Co. of America. In evaluating appearance of anodized aluminum, the most important kinds of glossiness are commonly termed distinctness of image, bloom, and haziness. To obtain a simple, mean- ingful set of quantitative numbers, the various kinds of glosses are re- lated to specific portions of a gonio- photometric curve. The technique is applicable to mirror-like metal fin- ishes, to etched and patterned metal surfaces, and to ceramic and paint coatings. This method agrees well with visual ratings, is sensitive to minimum visually detectable differ- ences within products, and provides a means for numerically classifying different products without need for material standards for calibration. 650514 Surface Variations in Body Steels as a Parameter of Automotive Primer Perform- ance. J. A. Gallagher and R. E. Moran, Enjay Labs. Div., Esso Res. &amp; Engrg. Co.; and R. J. Sundberg, Enjay Chemical Co. Leithauser demonstrated that lead contamination on steel causes premature corrosion failure when steel is phosphate treated. We postulate that such fail- ure results from oxidation of lead to plumbous ion with subsequent formation of soluble lead phosphate causing blistering by water absorp- tion, and that it can be minimized by forming insoluble zinc chromáte. Addition of zinc chromáte to automo- tive primers effects improvement in corrosion resistance if the zinc is tied up by free acid. This acid can be part of the vehicle or can be post added where a nonacidic vehicle, for example, hydrocarbon resins, is used. 650515 Variations in Axle Weights of Moving Trucks. D. K. Blythe, J. A. Dearinger, and R. E. Puckett, Kentucky Univ. This paper presents an analysis of axle weight data collected during the performance testing of the Broken Bridge dynamic electronic highway scale. Test re- sults are analyzed by comparing the in-motion axle weights as measured by the Broken Bridge scale with the corresponding static values for an in- strumented two-axle vehicle and for a sample of trucks diverted from an Interstate highway. Analysis of the two-axle test truck data shows that the actual loads applied to the high- way surface by the wheels of a mov- ing vehicle vary above and below the static equivalents in a manner that is typical for a specific location and range of speeds. For a random selection of different types of trucks, the variation of dynamic from static axle weight is further affected by axle position (front, second, third, and so forth) and spacing. It is generally concluded that dynamic scales should be used to collect large samples of axle weight data at various locations in the highway system and that such information should be evaluated and used in formulating future pavement design criteria. It is also suggested that further research be conducted in the field of vehicle dynamics to con- sider the variations in axle loads due to vehicular, driver, and environmen- tal characteristics.

Clark, Jr. and D. J. Skinner, Southwest Res. Inst.; and R. F. Dennis, Army Engr. Res. &amp; Dev. Labs. Present military requirements indicate a definite need for an auxil- iary power unit with high specific output. In line with this objective, an initial feasibility study was con- ducted to develop a high output Model 4A032 Military Standard En- gine. By incorporating advanced de- sign cylinder heads, pistons and valve train components, the maximum power output at rated speed was in- creased from the initial 9.8 bhp to 16.6 bhp with an accompanying re- duction in fuel consumption from 0.85 lb/bhp-hr, to 0.690 lb/bhp-hr, using military specification fuels and lubricants. These performance levels were achieved primarily by improved breathing and combustion character- istics of the engine. The results show the volumetric efficiency was in- creased from approximately 66% to 93%, an increase of 41%. 650517 Development of Heat Treat Stresses and Their Effect on Fatigue Strength of Hardened Steels. R. B. Liss, C. G. Massieon and A. S. McKloskey, Caterpillar Tractor Co. This paper proposes a theory which explains how high com- pressive surface stresses can be intro- duced into steels by severe quench- ing. Experimental data are pre- sented which show the effect of quench severity, hardenability, sec- tion size, tempering, and decarburi- zation on the surface residual stresses in quenched steel cylinders. Fatigue tests on small and large specimens of seven selected steels confirm the significant effect of residual stress on fatigue strength. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650518 New Technique of Steel Selection for Automobile Appli- cations. H. W. McQuaid. In steel for high hardness applications, heat to heat variation and inclusion char- acter are more important in fatigue test results than relatively large varia- tions in test temperature, analysis, or heat treating practice. This places the principal responsibility for per- formance of such steel parts with the steelmaker. The two important types of inclusions in steel which adversely affect performance of fully heat treated parts in service are discussed. The presence of silicates in the heat of steel, combined with the aluminum added for grain size control, is indi- cated as the major single cause of harmful inclusions. Elimination of 129</page><page sequence="69">the aluminum as a grain size control addition is strongly recommended, not only because it is the principal factor in forming crack nucleating re- fractory type inclusions but because of its adverse effect on sulfide inclu- sions. The substitution of vana- dium for aluminum as the grain size control addition is suggested. The resulting product is claimed to pro- vide a step forward in both perform- ance and overall economics. 650519 Correlation of Structure Characteristics and Resonant Frequency Measurements with the Engineering Properties of Gray Iron. G. H. Walter, Interna- tional Harvester Co. The purpose of this investigation was to learn more about the interrelations between the various physical and mechanical properties of gray iron. Particular emphasis was placed on exploring the factors which control the fatigue properties of gray iron. Four basic strength parameters - density, hard- ness, dynamic elastic modulus, and damping capacity - were evaluated and correlated with tensile strength and mean fatigue limit. The dy- namic elastic modulus and damping capacity were determined from con- ventional resonant frequency equip- ment. Several quantitative relations were developed which permit estima- tion of the tensile strength and fatigue limit of gray iron without knowledge of the specific chemistry or solidifica- tion rate. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650520 Vehicle Sensitivity to Tire Disturbances. L. M. Wal- lace, Chrysler Corp. Tires impose a variety of natural and forced vibra- tions upon a vehicle, which responds according to its actual sensitivity. This paper covers the significant tire and tire-automobile vibrations and design considerations to minimize such disturbances. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650521 Factors of Tire Design and Manufacture Affecting Uni- formity. J. A. Davisson, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Some of the fac- tors covering the effects of design and manufacture on tire uniformity are related. It is shown that the cur- rent level of uniformity is dependent on the continuous rigid control of all processes throughout manufacture and the constant evaluation of mate- rials, components, and finished tires for conformance to specification. The importance of correct design and selection of materials to minimize nonuniformities is presented and the effects of various factors of design and manufacture are illustrated on graphical recordings obtained from various uniformity measuring ma- chines. In addition, several funda- mental shape and dimension rela- tionships characteristic of conven- tional tire manufacturing are re- viewed to emphasize the significance of irregularities caused by some of the factors. 650522 Measuring Tire Uni- formity. C. Hofelt, Jr., General Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; H. D. Tarpinian, United States Rubber Tire Co.; and C. Z. Draves, Jr., Goodrich/B. F./ Tire Co. Tire uniformity measure- ments may be interpreted with some reservations to provide information regarding automobile ride disturb- ances at frequencies less than 60 cps (tire shake and roughness) and one type of handling disturbance (tire pull). A list of precautions and recom- mendations based on present or po- tential tire specifications is given in the first part of this paper, along with some machine and tire variables in- fluencing numerical force variation values. In the second part, the wave- forms of four uniformity measure- ments, radial force-variation, lateral force-variation, loaded radial runout, and free radial runout, are compared with the sites of splices in tires and substantial agreement is shown. A report on the capabilities and limita- tion of present day radial and lateral force-variance measuring as shown by the statistical analysis of a series of repeat measurements on two typi- cal lots of passenger tires is given in the third part. 650524 Effect of Hydrocarbon Type on Reactivity of Exhaust Gases. R. W. Hurn, B. Dimitriades, and R. D. Fleming, Interior Dept., Bur. of Mines. Unburned hydrocar- bons and other products of combus- tion are recognized as contributors to photochemical air pollution. The work reported here was a first ap- proach in finding an expression of exhaust gas quality - or composi- tional characteristic - that would as- sociate directly with the photochem- ical activity of the composite sample. Olefins, aromatics, and partial oxida- tion products have been cited as the principal smog precursors in exhaust gas. However, results of this study indicate that for the general case, collective determination of these classes provides an unreliable indica- tion of reactivity. Findings are ex- pected to be useful in further devel- opment of methods to measure - or predict air polluting potential of ex- haust gas with increased reliability. 650525 Hydrocarbon Emissions and Reactivity as Functions of Fuel and Engine Variables. L. A. McReynolds, H. E. Alquist, and D. B. Wimmer, Phillips Petroleum Co. The deleterious effects of hydro- carbons in the atmosphere results from their sunlight induced reactions with nitrogen oxides to produce pho- tochemical smog. The techniques commonly applied to reduce the con- tribution of vehicles to smog nor- mally take into account the overall quantity of hydrocarbons discharged to the atmosphere. This neglects the important fact that some hydrocar- bons are inert and others react to varying degrees. Therefore, the re- activity of hydrocarbons, in addition 650519-650525 130</page><page sequence="70">650526-650529 to the quantity, is an important vari- able in any study of vehicular hydro- carbon emission. This study was made to determine the effects of combustion and fuel variables on the relative amount and reactivity of vehicular exhaust and vented hydrocarbon losses. In order to minimize variables, several labora- tory simulations with CFR engines were used to represent limits of actual vehicle exhaust. A laboratory test chamber, which provided a suitable environment for the pertinent reac- tions involving a sunlit atmosphere containing nitrogen oxides, was used to measure photochemical reactivities of pure hydrocarbons, fuel blending components, and exhaust gases. Over the range of engine and fuel variables investigated, it has been shown that for gasoline engine vehi- cles there is no general relationship between quantity and reactivity of hydrocarbon emissions. Thus, the data obtained in this work support the thesis that both reactivity and quantity of hydrocarbon emissions must be measured in the assessment of the effect of emissions on photo- chemical smog. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650526 Factors Influencing the Effectiveness of Air Injection in Reducing Exhaust Emissions. D. A. Brownson and R. F. Stebar, General Motors Res. Lahs. Factors influencing the effectiveness of ex- haust port air injection in oxidizing the hydrocarbons and carbon monox- ide in engine exhaust gas have been investigated in order to establish guidelines for the engineering of vehicle emission control systems. Single-cylinder engine and vehicle studies have demonstrated that the temperature, composition, and resi- dence time of the exhaust gas-air mix- ture are basic factors determining both the effectiveness of air injection and the type of oxidation process which occurs in the exhaust system. Both luminous and non-luminous oxi- dation have been observed. These basic factors are affected by such variables as : engine spark timing and air-fuel ratio, insulation and size of exhaust manifolds, injection air tem- perature and air-flow rate, and the warm-up characteristics of the air injection system. The warm-up char- acteristics can he influenced particu- larly by spark timing and exhaust manifold design. By optimizing the operating and design variables, it has been possible to greatly enhance the effectiveness of air injection in reduc- ing hydrocarbon emissions. For ex- ample, with an experimental system, a composite hydrocarbon emission of 27 ppm has been measured on a vehi- cle tested in accordance with the Cali- fornia Motor Vehicle Exhaust Emis- sion Test Procedure. On the other hand, for the same system, the carbon monoxide emission was 0.76%. In- creasing the effectiveness of air injec- tion in reducing carbon monoxide emission has proved to be most diffi- cult. Although these experimental systems may not be amendable to product engineering, they do illus- trate the potential of air injection for reducing exhaust hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650527 Design Factors Affecting the Performance of Exhaust Manifold Reactors. E. N. Cant- well and A. J. Pahnke, du Pont de Nemours/E.I./&amp; Co., Inc. Exhaust manifold reactors have been designed which, with air injection, reduced hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions from unmodified passenger car engines to very low levels. These experimental reactors were tested on engines in the laboratory using the California procedure. The high effi- ciency of the reactors resulted from the exceptional thermal insulation achieved by circulating exhaust gases around the reactor core and by using multiple radiation shields. Practical application of the shielded, recircula- tion reactors is presently limited by the lack of durable materials of con- struction. Significant improvements in the effectiveness of manifold air injection also have been obtained through relatively small changes in the geometry of conventional exhaust manifolds. These developments give promise that exhaust manifold re- actors can offer nearly complete con- trol of hydrocarbon and carbon mon- oxide emissions in the exhaust of gasoline engines. Discussion: H.

The environment of a gas tur- bine engine poses severe challenges to the use of electronics in fuel control components. Nevertheless, fuel con- trol propositions can be resolved electronically and environmental problems of accuracy, life, and relia- bility adequately minimized when a quasi-digital approach is utilized such that the medium of intelligence is represented by the duty cycle of a saturated, switching waveform. Ex- ploitation of the full potential of this quasi-digital approach, however, re- quires a réévaluation of hardware and control philosophies in the light of the peculiarities inherent in their best use with this approach.

R. P. McCabe and R. P. Ca- nale, Holley Carburetor Co. This paper presents an analysis of a num- ber of methods of obtaining fast, stable governing of gas turbine pow- erplants while maintaining a narrow band of speed regulation. Special emphasis is placed on a fuel flow reset technique which allows accurate and flexible control of system dynamics. Two governor applications are studied: (1) the helicopter with a free turbine engine, and (2) the alter- nating current generator with a solid shaft engine. Both of these applica- tions present stability programs, but for different reasons, and both prob- lems are complicated by fuel trans- port lag. The studies, conducted by both analytical and simulation tech- niques, show that fuel flow reset pro- vides a practical means of meeting system dynamic requirements. Discussion: J.

McCarthy, United Aircraft Corp., Hamilton Standard Div. Since most jet engine fuel control development programs require work- ing to tight schedules, changing en- gine requirements, and in new areas of technology, the distinction between development and production becomes less apparent and the two activities, for a time, are carried on simultane- ously. A development test program must take this into consideration. Many problems encountered during the development period are straight forward and will yield quickly to the technical knowledge and experience of the engineer. When they do not yield to this approach, other more powerful statistical analytical tech- niques may be required. One such technique is "Random Balance." It is an experimental design which per- mits simultaneous study of the effect of many inputs with little added cost or delay in the program. It is a screening experiment that isolates the inputs that have the greatest effect on outputs under study. It assists in sorting the vital few from the trivial many. Furthermore, the technique does not replace the classical statis- tical experiment, but directs it to those areas where rigorous analysis is required. 650532 What Choice of Air Cleaners for Small Engines? D. W. Morton, Donaldson Co., Inc. There are many types of intake air cleaners available for gasoline line and diesel engines under 30 horse- power. Oil impingement, oil bath, and dry type air cleaners have major differences in performance. The selection of an air cleaner for a small engine involves an evaluation of cost vs. performance, based on the degree of engine protection required in the final application of the engine. 650533 In Air Filters It's . . . Small Engines (Large Appe- tites?) K. E. Humbert, Jr., Wix Corp. Close analysis of what occurs during the time of air intake in a small engine shows that the rate of flow of air is six or more times the engine's actual consumption rate of air. This high transient air flow places unusual requirements on air filters for small engines both from the standpoint of ruggedness and poros- ity. For maximum utility air filters for small engines must be easily ser- viced (cleanable and reuseable on the job even if only on an emergency basis) . 650534 Cleaning Induction Air - Small Engines. R.

The air cleaner and air cleaner systems mentioned in this paper are those intended for use with smaller engines covering an approxi- mate range of 1-60 hp and which have one, two, three or four cylinders, both aircooled and liquid cooled. The factors that must be considered in deciding upon an air cleaner sys- tem include the air cleaner system and engine requirements, the envi- ronmental and servicing conditions, and the cost value-engineering analy- sis. The relevant elements of air cleaner determination are presented; from these the engineer must decide the specific application. 650535 Determination of Form- ing Limits of Automotive Stamp- ings. S. P. Keeler, Great Lakes Steel Corp. Forming limits are de- termined by analyzing strain distribu- tions obtained from 0.2-in. to 0.05-in. grids imprinted on blanks by photo- graphic or electrochemical marking techniques. Failure generally occurs in a region of stretch forming where all strains are positive (tensile) in the plane of the sheet. Experimental results derived from laboratory speci- mens and production automotive stampings indicate a predictable critical strain level beyond which fail- ure is anticipated. The most effective method of increasing the stretching limits is the development of a more nearly uniform strain distribution. Factors controlling this distribution are material strain hardening char- acteristics, die design, stamping geometry, and lubrication. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650536 Control of Double Im- ages in Automobile Glass. M. J. Irland and V. L. Lindberg, Ford Mo- tor Co. This paper first examines the optical principles involved in the formation of double images so that glass may be evaluated for this prop- erty in the design stage of automo- 132</page><page sequence="72">650537-650571 bile windshields. It then describes a new instrument, the local curve and wedge meter, which has proved to be useful in determining the extent to which each of the three factors of curvature, inclination, and wedge has contributed to the presence of double images. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650537 Passenger Car Ventila- tion by Design. K. Wilfert and H. Goetz, Daimler-Benz AG. Favorable ventilating systems in passenger cars and their influences on the rate of air flow in the passenger compartment are shown. One example shows the pressure distribution along the cen- terline of the body and the differences in the pressure between possible body air inlets and outlets which deter- mines the rate of air flow with any particular ventilation system. Sev- eral ventilating methods are shown which satisfy the following require- ments: Increased air flow, reduced noise level and defined air flow in passenger compartment, prevention of water entry and elimination of drafts. In view of the increasing desire for a reduction of noise level inside the passenger compartment, the noise created by the wind when the windows are opened or when the doors and windows are insufficiently sealed should be eliminated by specific ven- tilation openings. 650566 (SP-269) Pros and Cons of Engineering Management. H. B. Van Hook, General Motors Corp. Selection of engineers for supervisory positions is not a science and prob- ably never will be. But, as discussed here, there are some criteria that can be cited as fairly reliable. Once a commitment toward supervision is made, a planned course of action, such as the one outlined here, should be followed. Either way, the engi- neer who makes up his mind early will probably help himself and his organization. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650567 (SP-269) First Principles of Engineering Supervision. J. E. Boyce, General Motors Corp. This report is a comprehensive guide of basic points concerning engineer- ing supervision and management. It is based on the practical experience of supervisors, supplemented by re- search findings of behavioral scien- tists. The purpose is to introduce this important subject in a practical and useful way to interested engi- neers, as well as to furnish a system- atic review for the further develop- ment of experienced supervisors. The first section covers the main responsibilities of technical work co- ordination and supervision. The second section covers the additional personnel and administrative respon- sibilities of the engineering super- visor. A selected reading list refers to further information on specific subjects. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650568 (SP-269) Basic Ap- proaches of Engineering Man- agement. R. B. Alexander, Ford Motor Co. This paper is written on the basic assumption that the reader is a member of engineering manage- ment, and so it offers advice as to sound principles while avoiding a standardized formula for achieving success. In fact, one of the basic points is that there are a variety of techniques and approaches which may be used, but that there is no substitute for success. The process of decision making is dealt with in some detail and includes the impor- tance of the manager being able to sell his decision. 650569 (SP-269) Scientific Man- agement Methods. F. M. Webster, Chrysler Corp. To help the young engineer decide between being a man- ager and an engineer, this paper at- tempts to: 1. Introduce him to the approach of the management scientist to the prob- lems of managing. 2. Provide him with some insight into the problems of the manager - allocating resources to the best ad- vantage to achieve the objectives of his organization. 3. Mention briefly some of the tools employed by the management seien- tist. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650570 (P-6) Fail-Operative Sta- bility Augmentation System with Self -Test Capability. H. Moreines, R. Sellite, and A. Kirchhein, Bendix Corp., Eclipse-Pioneer Div. A fail- operative stability augmentation sys- tem for the C141 jet transport aircraft yaw control axis is described. Triple-redundant sensors and signal- ling are used in conjunction with a dual-output, monitored servo system. Majority-rule voting logic, comprised of digital logic gates, operates directly upon conventional 400 cps sup- pressed-carrier data-modulated sig- nals for fault rejection. Self-con- tained means for semi-automatic preflight checkout as well as opera- tional failure warning and disconnect provisions are described. It is shown that the effect of redundancy is to reduce by several orders of magni- tude the probability of a hardover failure occurrence. 650571 (P-6) Boeing/ Bendix Automatic Landing System for the 707 Aircraft. R. L. Schoen- man, Boeing Co., Airplane Div.; and J. Doniger, Bendix Corp., Eclipse- Pioneer Div. Equipment that is be- ing added or retrofitted to the 707/ 720 airplanes to enable low approach and automatic landings to be made under conditions of low visibility as a part of regular airline operations is described. Its capability in safely providing such performance has been certified by the F A A. This certifica- tion is a significant advance toward all weather airline operations. The major elements of the system such as the autopilot, yaw damper, approach and flare couplers and auto-throttle 133</page><page sequence="73">650572-650577 system are described in relation to their effects on performance and safety. The safety aspects of the sys- tem are particularly important for this application and, therefore, the monitoring and automatic test sub- systems are described in some detail. The test procedures used to evaluate all aspects of the system design are also described. 650572 (P-6) Automatic Landing Systems Mechanization - Series or Parallel Servos? D. P. Hoff- man and H. Kawana, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. A review of several studies and their results, conducted in an effort to determine the most advantageous form of outer loop con- trol mechanization for use in high- performance flight control systems, has indicated that the series servo concept has considerable merit in contrast to the similar parallel servo mechanization. Results of both an- alytical and hardware tests with pilot- in-the loop evaluation in the area of system performance, failure tran- sients, malfunction protection, and physical characteristics have shown that for all autopilot functions and particularly for such critical outer loop functions as automatic landing systems, the series servo system mechanization is superior or equiva- lent to the parallel servo in all respects. 650573 (P-6) Development of Failure-Correcting Flight Control System. F. C. Neebe, General Elee. Co. A major increase in safety and reliability is required in many of today's applications of aircraft stabil- ity augmentation and/ or automatic flight control equipment over that which can be provided by nonredun- dant and some dual-type systems. Among those operations which re- quire high degrees of reliability are automatic landing on airfield or carrier, automatic terrain-following systems and stability-augmentation systems where loss of stability aug- mentation results in an unsafe condi- tion. To provide this major increase in safety and reliability, a redundant control system which has undegraded performance after the first fault is required. This paper describes the application of triple redundancy with majority logic voting in meeting this requirement. 650574 (P-6) Potential of Moni- torless Control Systems of High Redundancy Efficiency. E. A. O'Hern, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Autonetics Div. Increasing attention is being devoted to the application of various redundancy techniques to flight-control systems. The applica- tion of immediate concern in this paper is the important class of tactical military aircraft : its characteristics and its advantages. 650575 (P-6) Hydrologie Redun- dant Systems. D. Wood, Hydraulic Res. &amp; Mfg. Co. This paper con- siders redundant systems starting with overall flight control system re- quirements and then proceeds via various possible approaches through to a specific concept and typical ap- plications. The following are the highlights: (1.) the functional, relia- bility, and safety aspects of a flight control system must be carefully and intelligently considered if a good re- dundant scheme is to result; (2.) there are several possible approaches to redundancy, each having its par- ticular attractions and limitations; (3.) the HydroLogics approach of- fers a very simple, versatile, fast act- ing, and reliable system that is based upon both a sound concept and proven hardware; and (4.) only when full advantage is made of re- dundant systems will the true poten- tial of high performance vehicles be realized. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650576 (P-6) Pulse Operated Bi- propellant Reaction Control Valves. R. F. Bailey, Moog Servo- controls, Inc. Bipropellant reaction control systems require unique pro- pellant control valves. The response time of attitude control rockets for space vehicles is a function of the valve response. The minimum ob- tainable impulse bit is significantly influenced by the propellant valve characteristics. This paper presents design considerations fpr pulse oper- ated bipropellant control valves and gives design solution to these prob- lems. Four essential design pa- rameters are considered; these are: reliability, performance, material compatibility, and weight. Reliabil- ity is obtained by simplicity of de- sign. The primary performance re- quirements are fast response, zero propellant leakage, simultaneous op- eration of fuel and oxidizer metering, and contamination tolerance. Valve weight is minimized through use of a torque motor. Suitable materials are carefully evaluated for compati- bility with the propellants, while maintaining a structurally sound unit. 650577 (P-6) Compensation of Massive Thrust Chamber Posi- tioning Servomechanisms. D. A. Engels, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Compensation efforts directed at the stabilization and control of the Saturn S-II engine actuation system have given rise to nonlinear compensation philosophies that are also applicable to other types of hydraulic position- ing servos. The analysis presented in this paper shows by theoretical and analog simulation techniques that a lag-lead form of compensation is superior to the presently popular dynamic pressure feedback (DPF) for reducing system step position errors in the presence of a large stiction/ coulomb gimbal friction component. This result is important because nonlinear friction positioning errors are directly related to the mag- nitude of the resultant vehicle attitude limit cycle. An analog computer nonlinear system simulation was used to verify the analytical results dis- cussed herein. Using the ITAE cri- terion, step and ramp responses of the system were compared to evaluate the DPF and lag-lead networks. The gains and time constants of the com- peting networks were varied in a sys- tematic manner, and the superiority of the lag-lead network was clearly indicated. 134</page><page sequence="74">650579-650584 650579 (P-5) Balanced-Power Actuation Concept. G. R. Toomey, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The technological advancement in aero- dynamics, propulsion, and structures for manned air vehicles in recent years has placed an ever increasing demand on actuation systems in the form of function, power level, and en- vironment. A significant advance in actuation technology is necessary to improve vehicle mass ratio for high- performance vehicles. This paper describes the results of a parametric study which indicates a high level of confidence in the potential of the balanced-power concept for signifi- cant weight savings in aircraft actua- tion systems. The advantages of the balanced-power actuation concept are illustrated by a comparison between this concept and a conventional hy- draulically actuated system for an identical flight control actuation prob- lem. The balanced-power concept consists of mechanically actuated flight control surfaces, a mechanical servo, a flywheel and a motor. The motor may be electrically, pneumati- cally, or hydraulically powered. 650580 (P-6) Analysis of To- roidal Actuation Systems for Aerospace Vehicles. H. Dreher, Lycoming Div., AVCO Corp. This paper presents Lycoming's approach to a mechanical servo actuator for an all-mechanical flight control system. A history of traction transmissions and their effects on the toroidal actu- ator development is given. A de- scription of the actuator, with basic design criteria, is presented. Com- ponent and system test results, includ- ing parametric and theoretical an- alyses, substantiate the feasibility of the approach. Techniques for tailor- ing performance to a specific require- ment are discussed, including a unique approach to mechanical cas- cading for control power amplifica- tion. 650581 (P-6) Control System Aspects of an Analytical Investi- gation into Controlling the Struc- tural Modes of Flexible Aircraft. A. S. Mori and J. H. Wykes, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Disturbing pilot accelerations and structural loads due to structural motion are areas of increasing concern, both to the pilots and designers of vehicles for low-altitude, high-speed missions. Such aeroelastic problems can be alle- viated by a control system synthesized to effectively increase the damping ratio of the structural modes. The paper discusses the specifics of sens- ing, local force application, coupling, and adaptability of typical control systems, using the XB-70 as the basic study vehicle. It is shown that a relatively simple conventional control system can be designed to provide damping to the structure while adapt- ing to flight condition variations con- tinuously and guaranteeing phase and gain-stabilization of structural modes. 650582 (P-6) Difficulties in Con- trol System Synthesis for Launch Vehicles Exhibiting Severe Mode Interaction. R. L. Swaim, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. An inves- tigation was made of the problem of providing an automatic control sys- tem for a large booster subject to severe mode interaction. This inter- action is defined as a strong aerody- namic coupling between the rigid body motion and one or more elastic modes of the vehicle and can appear as a flutter phenomenon between rigid and elastic degrees of freedom as opposed to "classical" flutter be- tween two or more elastic degrees of freedom. For the booster con- sidered, the interaction resulted in a rigid-body mode static divergence for an aerodynamically statically stable rigid configuration in the uncon- trolled or forward-loop-only system. It was shown that preliminary control system design must include the sig- nificant elastic modes when mode interaction is present. A rigid-body- only synthesis will not yield "ball- park" values for the control element gains. The investigation revealed that the active control philosophy of using auxiliary control inputs to in- crease the frequencies of the elastic modes sufficient to reduce the mode interaction in the forward-loop is a false notion. It is the free-free bend- ing modes which interact with the rigid-body motion, and input forces cannot alter their mode shapes and frequencies. They can be altered only by mass and structural stiffness changes to the basic vehicle. The input forces result in changes to elastic mode coupled frequencies and damping ratios which do not affect the mode interaction phenomenon as defined herein. Analysis has shown that it is meaningless to specify de- sired transient response in terms of closed-loop short-period frequency and damping ratio as a criterion for control system synthesis when the vehicle is subject to severe mode in- teraction. 650584 (P-6) Attitude Control for Flexible Satellites. A. L. Greensite, General Dynamics/ Con- vair. An attitude control system for a flexible satellite is investigated. It is assumed that the satellite can be analyzed, at least to a first approxi- mation, as a thin circular plate. Cer- tain types of orbiting telescopes fall in this category. The modes of vibration of this system are deter- mined and their influence on the per- formance quality of a three axis con- trol system is studied. Essential complications in the analysis stem from the nonlinear gyroscopic cou- pling terms as well as the coupling of rigid body and elastic motion. It is shown that the elastic motions are re- flected on only one axis of the vehicle with proper location of sensors, and that the control system can be made insensitive to the two lowest vibration modes. Furthermore, the interaxis coupling has negligible influence on the system stability if the control system for each axis is properly de- signed. 135</page><page sequence="75">650585-650591 650585 (P-6) Future Sensing and Information Requirements and System Ideas that Apply to Flight Control. M. L. Lipscomb and W. G. James, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The paper deals with a general treatment of establish- ing the instrumentation and associ- ated system requirements for control of future flight vehicles, the challeng- ing pace of instrumentation tech- nology, what one can expect in the way of firm future requirements, what will be required of the instrument developer, and some typical problems of the future. It suggests that this is a fruitful product area, but will re- quire an all out imaginative effort with a high degree of flexibility to stay competitive. 650586 (P-6) Changing Empha- sis and Future Trends in Navi- gational Gyros. P. S. Lund, Honeywell Inc., Aero. Div. Although prime requirements for inertial sen- sors historically have been perform- ance and reliability, there is now sharply increased emphasis on cost factors. As a result, new concepts have been advanced at rapid pace. These are discussed briefly to point out development status and capabil- ity. Gas bearing and ESG concepts are discussed in further detail with respect to performance capability, design integrity, and cost factors. Comparisons are made in these areas to qualify these two gyro types as low-cost navigational gyro candi- dates. 650587 (P-6) Drift of a Quan- tized Attitude System Due to Vehicle Coning Motions. A. F. Schmitt, General Precision, Inc., Kearfott-San Marcos Div. A rela- tionship is derived for the drift of a coordinate transformation matrix of a quantized (pulsed) attitude refer- ence system on a vehicle undergoing a "coning motion." Several sources of limit cycle oscillations in missiles and spacecraft are studied to deter- mine the nature of such coning mo- tions. Typical transformation drifts are computed for these system effects. 650588 (P-6) Optimizing Ac- celerometer Orientations. T. L. Gunckel II, and D. R. Vander Stoep, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Auto- netics Div. Conventional acceler- ometer orientations obtain only a por- tion of the system performance avail- able from the accelerometers. There- fore, the use of optimum nonortho- gonal and redundant accelerometer orientations can result in significantly improved performance. This paper develops a general formulation of the accelerometer orientation optimiza- tion problem, presents solutions for certain special cases, and includes the results of examples to demonstrate the potential of nonconventional orienta- tions. 650589 (P-6) Float-Cocking Phe- nomenon in Single-Axis Floated Gyroscopes. R. E. Paulsen, Martin Co., Denver Div. Some single-axis floated integrating rate gyroscopes are designed with float suspension systems that have sensible radial com- pliance. When angular velocities are impressed about the output axis of these units, the resulting gyroscopic torque about the input axis causes the float to cock within the gyro housing. The amount of steady cocking is pro- portional to torque times compliance, but the time constant of the cocking motion is proportional to the viscous squeeze-film damping between the float and housing. The phenomenon was first noted when testing align- ment of this type of gyro by an oscil- latory method. This paper presents complete equations of motion for the single-axis floated gyro, taking into account the float-cocking degree of freedom. The previously observed test results are explained analytically. Implications of the phenomenon for gyro test, system application, and gyro design are discussed in terms of specific examples. Approximate expressions for the squeeze-film damping constant, not available in the literature, are developed in Ap- pendix B. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650590 (P-6) Trends in Air Data Equipment. J. P. Kemmer, Sperry Phoenix Co., Div., Sperry Rand Corp. Central air data computers will be- come widely used on subsonic com- mercial jets in the near future. Mili- tary and SST air data requirements will result in substantial reliability improvements, primarily through the introduction of digital techniques. Improvements in performance, size, and weight will lag until really good digital sensors are developed, at which time air data computers no larger than a common blackboard eraser will be feasible. An important new market will develop through the application of advanced air data tech- niques to the control of supersonic jet engines and intake systems. Of par- ticular significance to manufacturers of flight control systems is the general trend to widespread application of central air data computers, thereby eliminating the air data functions formerly included within autopilot systems. 650591 (P-6) General Consider- ations in the Selection of Attitude Control Systems. F. B. Woeste- meyer, General Elee. Co. To the great benefit of the spacecraft de- signer, there is now a broad spectrum of guidance and control techniques and components from which to choose. Thus, in the integration of the overall vehicle, he has consider- able freedom in selecting not only the preferred components but also the most advantageous modes of system operation. Guidance and control functions are usually interrelated, and the optimum choice may have a major effect on the vehicle configura- tion. This paper considers the con- straints affecting the choice of the basic attitude control system to be used and tradeoffs in the selection, sizing, and mode of operation of the components with which it may be implemented. The primary charac- teristics, both of the techniques and the hardware, are classified according to various criteria. The spectrum of 136</page><page sequence="76">650592-650598 vehicles is also classified according to characteristic requirements. Ex- amples are drawn from existing spacecraft. Other systems now awaiting suitable application, or under development, are discussed and characteristic advantages defined. 650592 (P-6) Technique for Lunar Landing Site Selection by Earth-Based Control. W. A. Fin- ley, Space Technology Labs. The report describes the results of a study of the techniques, system dynamics, and component characteristics re- quired to control the landing point of a lunar landing vehicle by manual control from earth. The controller is presented with a television picture of the landing area from which he selects the desired landing point and designates that point by transmitting an appropriate command to the land- ing craft. A vehicle-borne guidance system then controls vehicle attitude and thrust magnitude to cause a soft landing to occur at the desired point. System operation results in a soft landing even if no command is re- ceived. An important aspect of the study is the consideration of means of compensating for earth-moon transmission time delay. The study shows that a continuous prediction of the landing point can effectively sta- bilize the entire earth-moon control loop and that additional compensa- tion of the operator's display and controls will be required for precise accuracy. Various factors affecting stability and accuracy of the landing site selection system are evaluated. 650594 (P-6) Flight Control for a Manned Orbital Space Station. W. S. Hayes and D. C. Wensley, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. This pa- per discusses the factors influencing the design of a flight control system for a zero-g space station. The con- trol system is shown to be "sized," in terms of required impulse capacity, by the long term effects of gravity gradient and aerodynamic disturb- ances. The reaction control propel- lant required to counteract these dis- turbances is minimized by selection of attitude orientations which reduce external torques and by using mo- mentum storage devices to counteract cyclic disturbances. A number of momentum storage system configura- tions, using various combinations of inertia wheels and control moment gyros, are discussed for this purpose. The performance requirements for these equipments and methods of evaluating alternate configurations are presented. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650595 (P-6) Gemini Flight Con- trol System Performance during the Second Unmanned Flight. J. F. Hanaway, R. R. Carley, and J. A. Vernon, NASA, Manned Spacecraft Center. The second Gemini flight provided the first opportunity to evaluate the spacecraft flight system performance in its actual operational environment. The post-flight evalua- tion proved the adequacy of the sys- tem and removed one of the con- straints on the subsequent manned flights. This paper presents and dis- cusses the results of that evaluation. The flight control system is briefly described as are the special measures taken to permit operation in an un- manned configuration. The maneu- vers required of the system during the mission are described as are the data and analysis procedures utilized. Finally, system performance during each maneuver or stage of the flight is examined and compared with that predicted in pre-flight studies and simulations. 650596 (P-6) Attitude Control for a Radio Telescope Satellite. F. DeCanio, Republic Aviation Corp. A study has been performed which deals with the earth tracking dy- namics of a radio telescope satellite (RTS) for motion in the plane of the orbit. This paper presents the re- sults of this linearized dynamic sta- bility analysis which is based upon attitude stabilization by passive grav- ity gradient control. It is recog- nized that this analysis is preliminary in nature and merely represents a first, logical step in the analysis of the vehicle dynamics. Its principal value is that the model employed is optimistic and, therefore, if problem areas are found, they will, quite likely manifest themselves in a more com- plete study. This study has the added merit of providing some pre- liminary feeling for the problem with a relatively modest expenditure of effort. To obtain the desired mea- surements of low frequency radio sig- nals from outer space, the configura- tion is assumed to consist of a central spherical body with four tubular an- tennas extending 750 feet from it. Since the antennas represent ex- tremely flexible elements, the empha- sis in this analysis was placed upon investigating the potential stability problems caused by coupling between the rigid, central body motions and the relative motions of the flexible antennas. 650597 (P-6) Factors in Select- ing Digital or Analog Computa- tion for Flight Control. R. G. Buscher, General Elee. Co. Consid- eration of the factors involved in selection of the flight control compu- tation approach indicates that digital computation offers a degree of flexi- bility not inherent in analog systems. The purpose of the paper is to present to the flight control designer those factors which indicate the desirability of a digital flight control system. The similarity of the concept to ana- log systems is discussed as are the reliability and microcircuit advan- tages of digital computation. The basic point of the paper is that the techniques and components are now available to provide digital computa- tion for the flight control problem. 650598 (P-6) Functional Design of the Minuteman Flight Con- trol System. E. Andreosky, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Autonetics Div. The flight control system on board the Minuteman missile is a rate plus po- sition multi-rate sampled-data control system. This missile has the capabil- 137</page><page sequence="77">650600-650625 138 ities of withstanding long storage pe- riods in underground silos and can be launched on a moment's notice. Control of Minuteman I is achieved by vectoring four nozzles on each of the three stages. Minuteman II is controlled by vectoring four nozzles on each of stages one and three and by injecting liquid into the exhaust stream of stage two. To control the thrust vector throughout boost, the control system uses a general purpose digital computer, an angular acceler- ometer unit, three thrust vector con- trol units, and three digital resolvers. 650600 (P-6) Applied Fluids Technology. R. A. Evans, Honey- well, Inc., Aero Div. Beginning in 1958, much effort has been applied toward the advancement of "Fluid Technology." In early 1961, a step input occurred when the successful development of a fluid rate sensor confirmed the promise of obtaining complete fluid control and guidance systems without the use of moving parts. In the past three years, major strides, in the form of actual hard- ware accomplishments, have been made toward realizing this goal. In fact, simple stabilization and control systems were flight tested as far back as 1962. The "hardware" state of the art of "fluids" has progressed to such a point that military and com- mercial problems can now be solved by fluid systems, particularly those applications involving destructive en- vironments, long storage life, reliabil- ity, and low cost. Many papers have been presented dealing with fluid technology, usually in the form of theoretical analysis and/ or isolated component development. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650602 (P-6) Spacecraft Digital Controller. H. C. Daubert, Jr., Lear Siegler, Inc., Instrument Div. Because of the capability of extended accuracy, digital systems are indi- cated for guidance and control of spacecraft. Furthermore, by imple- menting these systems with integrated microelectronic components, substan- tial improvement in reliability can be expected. A study and experimental evaluation program was performed to apply such digital techniques to the spacecraft stabilization and control problem. Of major consideration were the selection of appropriate mathematical techniques for system analysis and the development of suit- able fabrication methods for hard- ware implementation. A discrete state model of a spacecraft reaction wheel and jet attitude control system was developed and computer simula- tions were performed. An electronic control unit for this system was de- signed, constructed with semi-conduc- tor integrated microelectronics, and tested on an air bearing simulator. The mathematical model of the system is presented and the experimental per- formance is compared with the com- puter simulation of the system. 650622 Application of Motor Truck Components. D. B. Wheeler, White Motor Co. It is im- portant that both the operator and ve- hicle manufacturer accurately analyze the operational demands of different type commercial vehicles. In order to insure satisfactory and efficient en- gine performance, each individual component comprising the vehicle must be compatible with the other. Several of the factors involved in the proper selection of such components as the engine, transmission, rear axle, and brakes are discussed in terms of the type of service required. Some of these components must be selected on the basis of experience gained either in a given fleet or similar fleets in the area where operation is in- tended. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650623 Vehicle Performance Prediction. M. A. Ordorica, Dana Corp. This paper describes a method of vehicle performance prediction which adapts readily to digital pro- gramming. A prime mover which may be a gas turbine or a reciprocat- ing internal combustion engine, a hy- draulic torque converter, and/ or a mechanical transmission, comprising the vehicle drive train, are trans- formed into numerical equivalents. The performance prediction itself is in three major parts, namely, the en- gine-converter compatibility, the con- verter range performance, and the lockout or direct drive performance. The computer transforms the engine data into equation form by curve fit- ting; predicts the optimum shift point as the intersection of the net tractive effort in converter drive with net trac- tive effort in direct drive; calculates; stores; interpolates; and prints a com- plete set of data. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650624 What is Expected of To- day's Power Take-Offs. R. W. Wagner, Chelsea Products. In view of the increasing varieties of equip- ment operated by engine power take- offs, it is desirable to have some method of estimating power require- ments before purchasing a truck. This paper offers a yardstick by which owners will be able to appropriate transmission capability of driving auxiliary equipment. The method is based on the pitch line velocity of the driving gear in the transmission and each step is fully explained and illus- trated. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650625 A Full Work Load From Available Power Sources. J. D. Smart, Vickers, Inc. The hydraulic industry, in order to meet the upward trend in size and mechanization of mobile type vehicles, has continued to provide increased horsepower per cubic inch of installed space in both pumps and motors and new control devices, such as pilot operated, sole- noid or hydraulically operated and electro-hydraulic servo valves. These features, which are required for the optimum transfer and control of power to do useful work, are discussed in this article.</page><page sequence="78">650626-650632 650626 Fuller Retarder - Design &amp; Development. W. S. Nagel, Eaton Mfg. Co. This paper describes the Fuller truck retarder and some of its development problems. The equipment is designed as a braking device for large on-highway trucks operating in mountainous terrains with steep descent grades. Since such braking accounts for most of brake lining wear, the retarder will considerably reduce cost of the relin- ing and downtime. Up to 5% grades the retarder effects 100% of the brak- ing; on steeper grades it contributes the major portion. Since new high- way restrictions limit grades to 5%, it may be expected that the retarder will drastically cut costs in this area. 650627 Development of a New Tandem Truck Suspension. I. Maxon, Dura Corp. This paper in- troduces a new tandem suspension suitable for trucks or highway trac- tors, with advantages in superior ride and lower weight. Multileaf steel springs are used in conjunction with unusually effective cams, producing a two- rate spring with the higher rate four times that of the lower rate. Newer materials such as nodular or ductile iron are used extensively. Rubber bearings are used to eliminate lubrication. Specific data are given with respect to selection of materials as well as stresses imposed in service. 650628 The Four-Spring Equal- izer Suspension. N. B. Chew, Freightliner Corp. Spring tandem suspensions fall into three basic cate- gories with reference to their attach- ment to the frame. The Freightliner suspension is the three-point, four- spring type. This type has definite advantages in drive line articulation and has a further advantage in frame loadings. This paper points out the importance of suspension articulation with reference to drive line spline slip rather than the more common atten- tion given to drive line angle parallel- ism. It further deals with the loads imparted into the frame by the sus- pension and deals specifically with the Freightliner three-point suspension. 650629 New Solution to High- Speed Over- W ater Transporta- tion. R. T. DeVault, North Amer. Aviation, Inc.; and V. B. Koriagin. The status of high-speed over-water vehicle design is reviewed and it is shown that no efficient designs exist in the speed range of 50-150 knots. Moreover, development of existing de- signs is not expected to produce sig- nificant gains since an order-of-mag- nitude improvement is needed. One concept shows promise of being de- veloped to an efficient vehicle, namely, the "ground effect flying boat." The theoretical and experimental basis of this concept is discussed. Presently available data from wind tunnels and test craft are presented, and develop- ment and employment of larger ve- hicles is considered. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650630 Practical Considerations of Water Jet Propulsion. M. M. Delao, Buehler Corp. Turbopower Div. The basic elements of water jet propulsion are developed with an ap- proach (somewhat analogous to the momentum concepts of compressible aerodynamics) which eliminates some inconsistencies of actuator-disc theory. The expressions derived form a simple analytical model, and pro- vide not only a rational basis for ex- perimental verification, but a basis for comparative evaluation between differing methods of water propul- sion. Experimental data from water jet propulsors, conventional propel- lers, and super-cavitating propellers are included to indicate the state-of- the-art, and to emphasize regimes where advancement is required to up date current technology. 650631 Commercial and Indus- trial Power plants - Future Pros- pects and Applications. E. J. Gay, TRW, Inc., and Associated Oc- tel Co. Ltd. Highlights of the papers and discussions contained in SP-270, "Powerplants for Industrial and Com- mercial Vehicles - A Look at Tomor- row" are given, along with the au- thor's personal opinions. It is predicted that engines 10 years from now will have to be almost com- pletely devoid of smoke and odor, and will have to meet various state and federal regulations in regard to emissions. It is possible that diesel and turbine engines will have to be designed to accept fuels much like JP-3 - a widecut fuel that should give good performance. Future prospects of the variable compression ratio engine, the strati- fied-charge engine, turbine engine, and hydrostatic and electric transmis- sion systems are discussed. A vast area of growth and change are said still to remain for the diesel engine. Specific future developments predicted include : 300-400 psi bmep, when 2-stage turbocharging and air- cooling are used, 1 hp per cu in. dis- placement, and higher rotative speeds. 650632 Piston-Turbine-Com- pound Engine. J. E. Witzky and R. F. Meriwether, Southwest Res. Inst. Exhaust heat utilization for in- ternal combustion engines has cen- tered around turbosupercharging in recent years, neglecting the promising field of compounding a piston engine with a gas turbine in which, unlike turbocharging, turbine power is fed back to the engine crankshaft. The piston engine can cope with high gas pressure and temperature, whereas the gas turbine can efficiently utilize the energy at relatively low pressure and temperature and large volume flows. By compounding, the piston engine will handle the high pressure, high temperature phase of the com- bustion cycle and extend the expan- sion ratio of the gases to atmospheric pressure by completing the low pres- sure, low temperature phase in the gas turbine. The marriage of the two engines will result in an outstand- ing power package with the highest thermal efficiency possible. 139</page><page sequence="79">650635-650656 140 650635 Modem Multipurpose Gear Oils and How They Got That Way. J. B. Stucker, Pure Oil Co. Res. Center. The development of multipurpose gear lubricants is traced from the time of widespread use of hypoid gears in the late 1930's to the present. The important role of the military requirements and the cooperative work of gear designers and gear oil compounders in the Co- ordinating Research Council is re- lated. Some of the possible reasons for the differences of opinion that have existed in the past are pointed out and explained in terms of minor variations in test conditions that may exert a major effect on the perform- ance rating of the gear lubricant. 650636 Modern Multipurpose Gear Oils. W. C. Brandów, Lubri- zol Corp. This paper reviews certain basic facts concerning gear lubricant additives, their character, and func- tion and why they are necessary in lubricants for heavy-duty equipment. The performance of modern multi- purpose gear oils in a variety of ap- plications as determined by a field survey and field service testing is in- cluded. 650637 Lubrication Require- ments of the Mack Heavy-Duty Power Divider. W. R. Alexander, Mack Trucks, Inc. A full-scale test procedure was developed utilizing the Mack differential power divider for the evaluation of gear lubricants. Test results indicate the superiority of MIL-L-2105B gear lubricants for heavy-duty rear axle carrier lubrica- tion. 650638 Development of a High Performance Oil for Mixed Fleet Service. D. R. Jones and P. I. Brown, California Res. Corp. This paper discusses the development of a new type of lubricating oil designed to give outstanding performance in mixed fleets powered by modern die- sel and gasoline engines. Its versa- tile performance characteristics were achieved by including an ashless de- tergent in the additive formulation. Extensive laboratory and field tests demonstrated the superiority of the new lubricant over conventionally compounded Supplement 1 oils under a wide variety of conditions in both diesel and gasoline engines. The oil was also formulated to meet the per- formance requirements of the MIL-L- 2104B specification, as well as car manufacturers' requirements for API Service MS. 650639 Cold Weather Operation of Fuels and Lubricants in West- ern Canada. W. F. Ellison and A. H. Scrimshaw, British Amer. Oil Co. Ltd. Within the scope of this paper we have endeavored to define the problems associated with achiev- ing acceptable performance of fuels and lubricants under sub-arctic con- ditions. Ingenuity in control of ma- chine environment has overcome many of the problems encountered over the years when operating in the arctic and sub-arctic areas of Western Canada. Clearly defined recommen- dations for lubricants and fuels to be used in these areas are required and equipment manufacturers would be well advised to widen the range of their recommendations to cover low temperature extremes likely to be en- countered in northern operation. 650641 Smog Chemistry Points the Way to Rational Vehicle Emission Control. J. D. Caplan, General Motors Res. Labs. The re- sults of studies of atmospheric chem- istry of smog formation serve as guidelines for determining a rational basis for control of vehicle emissions. These guidelines indicate the desira- bility of reactive hydrocarbon reduc- tion and the futility of nitric oxide reduction from vehicles. A system of classifying hydrocarbons as to their reactivity in smog formation is presented. Its application, in com- bination with gas chromatographic analyses, to both exhaust hydrocarbon and evaporative hydrocarbon vehicle emissions is illustrated. Utilization of this approach for determining the importance of exhaust versus evapor- ative hydrocarbon emissions, and for measuring efficacy of control by changes in both vehicles and fuel com- position is recommended.

A brief history of the origin of Sealectors and Sealraters, a description of the more popular mod- els of machines, their capabilities, and the improvements made since their conception is presented. Sealectors are air gaging machines for measur- ing the inside diameter and the lip opening pressure of lip type shaft seals. The machines are available as laboratory models or as semi-auto- matic bench type or fully automatic models for production testing of seals. The Sealraters are machines for en- durance and performance testing of lip type shaft seals under simulated conditions encountered in their appli- cation. The Sealraters are generally used as laboratory equipment for de- termining specifications to be applied to seals. 650656 Oil Seal Life - Good Loading or Good Luck. R. Brink, Victor Mfg. &amp; Gasket Co. This paper discusses some of the significant as- pects of oil seal radial load. Stress- strain relationships are dependent on time, temperature and lubricant. It is, therefore, important to know and control lip temperature if reliable sealing is to be achieved. The infra- red technique for observing lip tem- perature enables one to make difficult observations of transient and long term thermal behavior of a seal lip in a simple, routine manner. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS</page><page sequence="80">650657-650668 650657 X-15: Past and Future. J. E. Love, NASA, Flight Res. Center. The X-15 is a high-performance, manned research vehicle. The 125 flights made since 1959 have provided valuable research data on hypersonic aerodynamics, aerodynamic and struc- tural heating, the behavior of certain types of structure under aerodynamic heating, and the ability of the man - machine combination to perform as- signed tasks. It is planned to extend this work to greater speeds and to continue to use the vehicle as a test bed to lift various scientific experi- ments into the high-speed flight or near-space environment and return them to the scientists. This capabil- ity is almost entirely unique to the X-15. 650658 (SP-275) Variable-Stabil- ity Automobile - Concept and Design. L. Segal, Cornell Aero. Lab., Inc. The application of the variable stability and response auto- mobile for determining the dynamic characteristics of automobiles and for researching man-machine rela- tionships are described. As a design tool, the device permits realistic ap- praisal of machine behavior before advancing to the stage of prototype. It is in this application that the paper discusses two general categories, var- iable feedback and model reference systems, describing the design, com- ponents, calibration, utilization, and the various tasks required in the de- velopmental process. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650659 (SP-275) Variable-Stabil- ity Automobile - Use in Handling and Research. R. T. Bundorf, General Motors Res. Labs. The use of the GMR variable stability passen- ger car in a brief study of driver per- formance in a maneuvering task is described. The study was part of a pilot program for evaluation of test methods and equipment for future and more extensive human factor evaluations. In the simulation of three distinct types of passenger car directional control characteristics, each configuration was driven by each of six different drivers through a complex course. The results of the investigation are presented in terms of the average driver performance with each vehicle configuration. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650661 The "Aluminaut" - A Deep Submergence Vessel. E. E. Ellwood, Reynolds Metals Co. The "Aluminaut" is a well equipped scien- tific laboratory capable of working 15,000 ft under the sea for extended periods of time and with excellent maneuverability. Experience gained by its fabricators will be of assistance to designers and engineers of many projects which are only remotely re- lated to the "Aluminaut." The pur- pose of this paper is to outline the extent to which metal working arts were advanced and to point out tech- niques used which may be helpful to others. 650663 Dust Testing - Engine Development Tool. J. Decker and J. Bailey, John Deere Waterloo Trac- tor Works. This paper presents in- formation on development of engine dust testing procedures. These pro- cedures have proved to be a good en- gine development tool with high de- gree of sensitivity. Details of the procedure are given along with infor- mation on the abrasive material used. Comparative results are shown in evaluating design parameters. Some of the designs evaluated include oil ring expander and cam followers. It is proven that the oil ring expander design has a significant effect on the overall durability of the engine. A study was made to obtain correlation with laboratory and field results. 650666 Instantor Brake. N. R. Brownyer, Rockwell-Standard Corp. Tests show that the Instantor brake system successfully eliminates the need for power assist on both passen- ger cars and trucks equipped with four-wheel hydraulic brakes. In the case of the truck, the Instantor is built into the front brakes; in the passen- ger car, it is built into the rear brakes. The advantage of installing the In- stantor system in a vehicle are dis- cussed, particularly the enhanced safety features, lower initial and maintenance costs, and reduced space requirements. 650667 Lighting of Off-Highway Equipment. J. P. Welsh, Caterpil- lar Tractor Co. Lighting of earth- moving equipment is discussed with emphasis on providing adequate illu- mination for the rubber tired hauling units. As the vehicle speeds increase, the lighting problem becomes more critical. The techniques used to eval- uate sample lighting arrangements are discussed. Service life of the 12- and 24-v lighting elements is also of concern in the severe operating re- quirements imposed by earthmoving applications. Increased life can be obtained by using elements and lamp housings designed for off-highway equipment. 650668 Brake Capacity - What, Why, How. G. P. Mathews, Rock- well-Standard Corp., Brake Divģ This paper is a descriptive treatment of the fundamentals of brake capac- ity, but no formulas or rules of thumb are offered. It answers indirectly the question of how much brake capacity is needed, and attempts to indicate what brake capacity is, why it is a problem, and how it can be provided. 141</page><page sequence="81">650669-650675 650669 New Concepts in Hydrau- lic Controls for Mobile Equip- ment. W. T. Stephens, Borg-Warner- Corp., Warner-Motive Dev., and H. N. Underwood, Roy C. Inger- sol Res. Center, Borg-Warner Corp. Analyses and tests were made on various kinds of mobile equipment comparing open and closed center systems. The work cycle and maxi- mum horsepower were kept equal in the comparison of these systems. The closed center system surpassed the open center in both cycle time and efficiency of operation. New concepts of the closed center system evolved from this work. These concepts included: controlled acceleration and deceleration, selec- tive maximum volume control to pre- vent overspeçding, and a means of lowering the circuit pressure when the valves are in neutral. Gains with the integration of the hydrostatic transmission and the closed center hydraulic system are also demonstrated. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650670 Development of Suction Line Filtration Systems for Farm and Light Industrial Tractors. B. T. Gillis, International Harvester Co. Suction line filtration systems have been developed for tractors which use gear type hydraulic pumps. The seven major areas considered were pressure drop, efficiency, capac- ity, structural strength, bypass valve design, element change interval, and contamination level. Each area is discussed and illustrated with photo- graphs, curves, and charts. We be- lieve suction line filtration is best be- cause the entire hydraulic system is better protected. 650671 Fire-Resistant Fluids and Mobile Equipment. K. G. Henrik- son, Mobil Oil Co. The tremendous growth in the usage of hydraulic sys- tems during the last 20 years has brought about a need for improve- ments in fire-resistant fluids to mini- mize the dangers of combustion while in use under hazardous conditions. This paper discusses the properties, characteristics, and problems encoun- tered when using emulsions, straight synthetics, water-glycol solutions, and petroleum oil-synthetic blends in hy- draulic systems, and points out ad- vantages and disadvantages of each type of fire-resistant fluid. Such fluids are necessary for use in hazard- ous hydraulic systems to insure safety of personnel, property, and continuity of production. Overall economics dictate that a study be made of each application to determine selection of the actual fluid to be used. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650672 Military Hydraulic Sys- tem Requirements. J. T. Steven- son, Army Engr. Res. &amp; Dev. Labs. To meet the military hydraulic system requirements for construction equip- ment, the Engineer Research, and De- velopment Laboratories has initiated a hydraulic program to develop mini- mum standards of system and compo- nent acceptance through the media of performance specifications. The pro- gram will also establish a standardiza- tion of system types and of component mounting and port configuration. Such standardization, including hoses, tubing, and couplings, is intended to simplify maintenance and logistical support of hydraulic systems. 650673 Paraffinic Resin, A High Quality Lubricant and Newtonian V.l. Improver for Hydraulic Fluids. E. E. Klaus and R. Hersh, Pennsylvania State Univ.; and J. M. Perez, Kendall Refining Co. Paraf- finic resins derived from Pennsylva- nia crude oil are evaluated as viscous lubricants and as blending materials with mineral oils in the preparation of hydraulic fluids and lubricants. The oxidative, thermal, and shear sta- bilities of the resins and of blends of the resins in mineral oil base stocks have been studied in various rigorous tests from the standpoint of service applications. While the resins pro- vide thickening, the low temperature characteristics of blends show im- provement over those prepared with synthetic polymeric additives in that viscosities can be closely approxi- mated on an ASTM viscosity-temper- ature chart and are unaffected by shearing stresses. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650674 Application of Hydro- static Traction Drives to Garden Tractors. H. E. Bergren, Char- Lynn Co. Hydrostatic drives for garden tractors enable the user to en- joy the many advantages he finds in automobile automatic and power sys- tems, namely, no mechanical clutch, infinite speed range, dynamic brak- ing, and similar conveniences. This paper describes the outstanding fea- tures of these drives and portends their use as portable hydraulic horse- power for PTO operation of units such as generators, air compressors, and a wide range of implements. 650675 New Hydrostatic Drive for Small Tractors. R. H. Witt, Wheel Horse Prod., Inc. New hy- drostatic drives have found commer- cial acceptance on a family of vehicles where it is desirable to have complete control of ground speed, independent of engine speeds. These machines have common idealistic transmission requirements that can be met by hy- 142</page><page sequence="82">650676-650683 drostatic drives. To meet varying cost and mounting requirements, spe- cific uncompromised designs of the hydrostatic drive to meet individual requirements are indicated.

The technical evolution of the new Minneapolis-Moline G1000 tractor from the market analysis, preliminary design stages through the final design and testing stages is presented. The modification of an existing engine is described, with respect to the various engine parts. Technical features of the tractor, such as side rails, clutch, transmission, front end, PTO, and hy- draulics are also discussed. Finally, the testing and evaluation of the unit are described. 650679 Development of the 1200 Traction King. R. E. Dreyer, J. I. Case Co. The development of the 1200 Traction King is a result of changing farming techniques. It was developed to meet today's require- ment of producing more farm work with less manpower under a wide va- riety of soil conditions. A study of all the available machines and infor- mation led to the following basic re- quirements of the machine: (1) 4 wheel drive; (2) 4 wheel steer; (3) Drawbar pull sufficient to handle an eight bottom plow under most all field conditions; (4) Maximum operator comfort; and (5) Distinctive styling. 650680 Design and Application Considerations for Agricultural P.T.O. Drivelines. B. Reimer, Hayes Steel Prod. Ltd. Considerable progress is being made toward the development of a standardized agri- cultural power take-off driveline whereby the latter would be part of the tractor and could readily be at- tached to any implement by means of a quick disconnect. However, in or- der to establish a standardized design for an agricultural PTO drive line which would be universally accept- able, it must be made to suit all ap- plication requirements. This paper analyzes the interrelationship between the design of the drive line and its proposed application. The basic de- sign is discussed in terms of the uni- versal joint and center member. Ap- plication considerations are discussed with regard to drive line geometry, load cycle, and maximum torque. 650681 Design and Application of Universal Joints for Off-High- way Vehicles. C. E. Cooney, Jr., Borg- Warner Corp. The most im- portant design considerations which must be made when selecting or eval- uating a driveshaft application are discussed in simplified equations and tables. Stress formulas, S-N curves for various components, and universal joint bearing life curves are discussed and presented in easy-to-use form.

Drislane, Bendix Corp., Marshall-Eclipse Div. Many improvements have been made in re- cent years with regard to the applica- tion of ceramic metallic type friction material on clutches in tractors and farm equipment. The changes which have been effected on Cerametalix, a product of the Bendix Corp., are de- scribed. It is shown that the latest version of Cerametalix works in spring loaded clutches as well as in the overcenter types, and delivers out- standing performance in moderate-to- heavy duty service. T oday 's material has the benefit of 10 years of testing and experience concentrated in the clutch field, resulting in improved compounds, shapes, cushioning, and basic button design. 143</page><page sequence="83">650684-650691 650684 How to Improve Dura- bility of Tractor Final Drive Gears. T. C. Kulczewski, Interna- tional Harvester Co. The factors which affect the durability of highly loaded gearing at slow speeds are mounting, surface finishes, profile modifications, lubrication, and heat- treatment. These were taken into consideration in designing the final gear drive for the current line of In- ternational Harvestor large farm trac- tors. This paper deals with the treat- ment and evaluation of these factors, based on past and current experience and development work. 650685 Cumulative Damage Ap- plied to Combine Transmission Design. L. M. Delfs and A. M. Cuerington, John Deere Harvester Wks. The system used to propel grain harvesting combines is de- scribed along with its particular char- acteristics and power requirements. Because of the nature of the propul- sion requirements, use of cumulative damage theory in designing gears, bearings, and shafts is particularly advantageous. A procedure is de- scribed for reducing field load his- tories, laboratory determined torque- life curves, and the Miner and Corten-Dolan equations into a form directly usable in designing reliable, economical transmission components. 650686 Superiority of the Self- Loading Multi-Engine MultiPan Scraper. K. Harris, Harris, Inc. The development of the self-loading multipan, multiengine scraper is dis- cussed. Both the elevating scraper and the all- wheel drive are mentioned, the latter being described in greater detail. The advantages and disad- vantages of self-loading scrapers are explored, with particular emphasis on cycle time and versatility. 650687 Superiority of the Ele- vating Scraper. H. E. Stuller and T. J. Johnston, Hancock Mfg. Co. This paper discusses the new concept, design, and application of the elevat- ing scraper in the earthmoving indus- try. The elevating scraper is com- pletely self-loading and has attracted wide acclaim in the overall reduction of earthmoving costs. It has been proved by the thousands of units in the field today. 650688 Superiority of the Con- ventional Push Loader Scraper. E. E. Isgren, LeTourneau- Westing- house Co. This paper follows the evolution of the conventional scraper from a crude animal powered imple- ment to a modern earthmoving tool. At various stages of this evolution, such innovations as multipan, multi- engine, and an elevator were tried in the process of improving the produc- tivity of the machine. Today's con- ventional push-loaded scraper, retains several advantages over these refine- ments. One advantage is more ver- satile and efficient use of the available horsepower. 650689 Gear-Box Replacement Hydrostatic Drive. C. L. G. Worn, Dowty Hydraulic Units Ltd. ; and A. C. Walker, Dowty Technical De- velopments Ltd. The performance obtainable from a hydrostatic trans- mission is compared with current conventional tractor transmissions. Having shown that the present-day hydrostatic unit meets all vehicle re- quirements with the obvious advan- tages of true stepless transmission, the reasons for selection of a gearbox re- placement unit are considered and, further, the use of a variable dis- placement motor with variable dis- placement pump. The limitations of maximum pressure, speed, and dis- placement of both swash plate and tilting head units are discussed along with the specific design features of the Taurodyne. The latter represents a low cost reliable unit with wide per- formance characteristics. Alterna- tive forms of control which have been developed to suit various vehicle du- ties are described, and some details of typical installations and the ex- haustive reliability trials conducted on both test rigs and vehicles under extreme operating conditions are mentioned. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650690 Automated Techniques in Hydraulic Testing. C. J. Rick- etts, Hydro-Transmission Div., Sund- strand Corp. This paper covers im- proved and automatic methods for experimental testing in an engineer- ing department. Transducers, cen- tral acquisition, and a digital com- puter are the main components in the system. Test stands are set up, data acquired, monitored, calculated, and analyzed with a minimum of engi- neering time required. Special fea- tures and flexibility of the data col- lection system and computer programs are discussed. Advantages to the en- gineering department and plans for future expansion form the concluding portion of the paper. 650691 Effect of Speed on Soil Failure Patterns in Front of Model Tillage Tools. D. J. Olson, LeTourneau-Westinghouse Co.; and J. A. Weber, Illinois Univ. Tests of flat model tillage tools in two artificial soils indicate that soil failure break- out patterns could be predicted for slow speeds in loam-like soil but with increase in speed and change to a clay-like soil, the failure changed from breakout of soil segments to con- tinuous flow. High-speed movies of the failure patterns enabled calcula- tion of acceleration forces, shearing strain, and normal strain and also 144</page><page sequence="84">650692-650697 revealed reasons for increase in force with increase in speed. Variables were type of soil, tool angle of 15-90 deg to the horizontal, and tool speed of 0.5-2.5 mph. Discussion: J. K. McDonald, Hyster Co. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650692 Fundamental Properties of Compacted Soils. D. Hampton and E. T. Selig, Illinois Inst, of Tech- nology, Res. Inst. This paper re- views the state-of-the-art as regards the properties of compacted soils. In particular, the engineering proper- ties of compacted soil are discussed in relation to soil structure, moisture content, inter-particle (effective) stress, particle spacing, and particle orientation. The importance of com- paction moisture content is empha- sized because it is a critical factor in determining soil structure. In par- ticular the effect of the aforemen- tioned factors on the strength, volume change, compressibility, permeability, flexibility, and frost susceptibility characteristics of compacted soil are noted. 650693 Performance of Dual and Tandem Tractor Tires - A Model Study. J. B. Liljedahl, Pur- due Univ.; S. Clark, Colorado State Univ.; and D. Apple, Deere &amp; Co. The Purdue Univ. soil-vehicle labora- tory located in the Agricultural Engi- neering Building was used to study the effect of dual, single, and tandem drives on artificial soils. The dual versus single tire comparisons were made with 4.00 x 8 tires. Two tan- dem drive combinations were used. The first combination utilized 4.00 x 8 tires for both the front and rear wheels, and the second combination used a 4.00 x 8 tire for the front wheel and a 6.00 x 12 tire for the rear wheels. Dual tires performed better than single wheels of the same weight when tested on loose soils. The full advantage of dual tires was not obtained without lowering the in- flation pressure below that of a single tire of the same weight. A weight distribution of 60% of the total weight on the front wheel produced better performance for the tandem drive using equal size tires than did the weight distribution of 50% or 40% on the front wheel. The per- formance at a tire pressure of 6 psi was superior to that at 9 and 12 psi. The performance of the tandem drive using the smaller front wheel was nearly equal for all weight distribu- tions at higher tire pressures. How- ever, at a tire pressure of 6 psi the weight distribution with 25% of the weight on the front wheel proved to have a higher tractive coefficient than either of the other two weight distri- butions of 35 or 45% on the front wheels. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650694 Automatic Transmis- sions In Crane Carriers. A. W. Christy, Allison Div., GMC. In au- tomotive equipment, many new de- vices influencing productivity have appeared, and the automatic trans- mission is rapidly becoming one of these. Also, with emphasis on greater individual productivity, it has be- come necessary to broaden a man's skills. Automatic transmissions have contributed immeasurably to both of these factors in many types of appli- cations. For example, several large utilities have obtained experience with them in line construction trucks, dump trucks, line stringers, tractor equipment or warehouse trucks and other applications peculiar to public utility work. This experience with automatics has begun to provide data and results which are not only of in- terest to the utility industry but to other users of similar equipment in the construction industry. To eval- uate and understand these results re- quires an explanation of how an au- tomatic operates, a description of its components, and a discussion of typi- cal applications and their relation to crane carriers. Since the Allison transmission is the only automatic available at this time for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, the discussion of necessity will center around its de- sign, features, performance, applica- tion, and use. 650695 Torque Converters in Cranes and Excavators - Appli- cation Highlights. J. W. Gottwald, Harnischfeger Corp. This paper covers some of the important details of applying converters to cranes and excavators. The specific topics cov- ered include variable speed output shaft governor; stall torque; convert- ers without output shaft governors; output shaft tachometers ; output shaft sprag clutch; and controlled convert- ers. 650696 Modulated Clutch Torque Converter and Its Poten- tial Application to Power Cranes and Shovels. W. G. Gibson, Twin Disc Clutch Co. A study of the mod- ulated clutch torque converter and its various applications is presented. Specific areas such as lubrication, cooling, slip heat relationship to in- put speed, and power division rela- tionship are analyzed.

The role of vacuum treated (degassed) steels is discussed with emphasis on its im- 145</page><page sequence="85">650698-650704 146 portance to various engineering ap- plications. Descriptions of the vari- ous degassing units and principles of operation are outlined. Current vac- uum degassing techniques offer the consumer improved quality of so- called tonnage and other types of constructional steels, as a result of lowered gas content and nonmetallic inclusions - together with improved control of alloy composition. The end result is a more homogeneous product, with improved properties leading to greater service reliability for various engineering applications. 650698 Fatigue Life Character- istics of Ball Bearings Made from Vacuum Refined Steel. J. S. Adams and D. Troost, Federal-Mogul Corp. Ball bearing life ratings are being revised upwards to reflect in part, at least, the contribution that vacuum refined steel has made towards extending fatigue life. In this paper, typical fatigue test results at several Hertz stresses are presented for ball bearings made from SAE 52100 steel, vacuum treated both by the stream degassing process and by the D-H process. Life increases of three times present standard theoreti- cal ratings and higher are reported and discussed. Testing equipment and procedures are also described. In conclusion, the paper cautions against the indiscriminate use of lab- oratory generated fatigue life im- provements in selecting ball bearings for commercial applications. 650699 Air Transportation of Construction Equipment. A. J. Rutherford, Army Engr. Res. &amp; Dev. Labs. Increased reliance on air transportation to support widespread military operations has produced im- portant considerations for design of construction equipment. Character- istics of cargo aircraft, economics of transport, and design concepts for air transportable equipment are reviewed. Speed of movement, logistic economy, and unavailability of surface trans- portation in many regions are cited as factors that make air transportable equipment essential for future mili- tary operations. 650700 Considerations Affecting Vehicle Operational Require- ments. E. M. Szten, Research Anal- ysis Corp. This paper discusses vari- ous factors affecting the preparation of vehicle operational requirements. Major items that are difficult to define which affect vehicle design are envi- ronment, terrain features, and vehicle reliability. By utilizing a data bank established on information obtained from field and test reports, as well as adopting the practice of applying specific information and definitions, industry can produce vehicles more responsive to the intent of the require- ments. 650701 Engineering the Case 450 Crawler Tractor.

S. F. Wisnieff and H. Bardach, Lycoming Div., Avco Corp. Development of turbine blade cooling techniques have been prompted by the demand for in- creased power and efficiency from existing engine envelopes. Accurate determination of temperature profiles exhibited by the turbine blades dur- ing engine operation expedite the at- tainment of optimum design. This is accomplished by perfusing the blades with radioactive krypton -85 at 600 C, 1000 psi for 48 hr in a pressure vessel, installing the blades, and running them for 30-60 min. The blades are then cut up (Elox) into pieces (Ys in. x Ys in. mini- mum), and the temperature at which each piece evolves significant amounts of radioactive Kr-85 is noted. This</page><page sequence="86">650705-650711 temperature corresponds to the maxi- mum temperature experienced by the blade surface during the engine op- erating period. Temperatures have been determined for Inconel blades to 1800 F. Trials indicate a repro- ducibility of ±5 F at lower tempera- ture levels and ±20 F at the higher temperatures. Apparatus and proce- dures developed after considerable experimentation are described, and typical temperature evaluations pre- sented. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650705 Temperature Indicating Paints as They Assist in Gas Tur- bine Design Processes. W. H. Duffey, Allison Div., GMC. High temperature turbine technology de- mands new techniques in development testing as well as new design ap- proaches. The use of temperature indicating paint is an example of a test technique that has assisted sig- nificantly in the design and develop- ment of high temperature turbine and combustion hardware. Although temperature indicating paint is not a new device in industry, the applica- tion in high temperature, high force- field gas streams requires special techniques, which are described here and which have been used with a high degree of accuracy and reliability in the design and testing of combustion and turbine components. 650706 Application of High Temperature Materials For In- tegrally-Cast Turbine Compo- nents.

This pa- per reviews the more recent achieve- ments in the development of materials for 1200 to 2200 F service in the gas turbine: advances in creep strength of turbine disc alloys and the signifi- cance of low cycle fatigue to new disc materials ; and the recent develop- ments in wrought and cast turbine blading alloys, with discussions of sulphidation and thermal fatigue. The importance of chromium relative to corrosion resistance and the value of diffusion coatings as an alternative to built-in protection are evaluated. Finally, wrought alloys for hot duct- ing structures and the outlook for the dispersion strengthened alloys are discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650710 Delivering the Mail with Diesels - the Post Office Depart- ment Looks at Diesel Engines. G. C. Nield, United States Post Office Dept. To determine to what extent diesel power should be introduced into the 60,000 truck postal fleet, a comprehensive evaluation-type study was undertaken by the Automotive Division of the Post Office Depart- ment. The study encompassed the complete range of truck sizes from the large 65,000 gcw tractor-trucks to the small 14-ton three wheel scooters. Considered in the evaluation were such factors as reliability, noise level, driver reaction and vehicle perform- ance characteristics, in addition to the usual comparison of fuel consump- tion. Although the complete life cy- cle of the representative gasoline and diesel vehicles being studied is not complete, certain interim findings concerning vehicle performance and driver acceptance do support the trend to more general use of diesel powered vehicles. Discussion: D. W. Steltz, Mack Trucks, Inc.; A. E. W. Austen, C. A. V., Ltd.; W. L. Moody, Detroit Diesel Engine Div., Gen- eral Motors Corp.; P. H. Cerf, Waukesha Motor Co.; W. S.

This pa- per examines the potential application of diesel engines to school buses from the standpoint of technical require- ments and economy of operation. The importance of the question is pointed up by the fact that 200,000 school buses are now in use in the U.S., and replacements run to about 147</page><page sequence="87">650712-650719 25,000 per year. The study shows that the additional cost of a diesel vehicle can be recovered over the pe- riod of its useful life on the basis of fuel economy alone. The savings achieved through maintenance costs further offset the additional capital costs of dieselization. It is shown that the diesel bus is superior to gas- oline power in meeting the basic school bus requirements of maximum trouble-free life, acceleration char- acteristics adequate to keep up with traffic, ability to maintain the shortest possible route schedules, and to pro- vide safe and economic transporta- tion. The major disadvantages of diesel engines - noise and vibration - can be overcome using current tech- nologies. 650712 Development of the Air Supported Lawnmower. V. J. Worrel, Toro Mfg. Corp. The prin- ciples employed in ground effect ma- chines have been successfully applied to a rotary lawnmower. The devel- opment included that of a suitable fan and housing relationship to give a sufficient air pressure differential to support the weight of the unit. Efficiency of the fan, power available in the engine, air velocity at discharge from the housing, and flotation height above the ground were all considered to insure that the function of cutting grass was not lost. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650713 Snow Pup - The Light- weight Powered Snow Shovel. B. L. Ertsgaard, Toro Mfg. Corp. By analyzing the customer's needs, the shortcomings of present products and by employing a combination of lightweight metals and plastics, a new concept in snow removal equipment has been developed. 650714 General Motors Research GT-309 Gas Turbine Engine. W. A. Turunen and J. S. Coliman, General Motors Res. Labs. The GT- 309 regenerative gas turbine engine is the latest in the series of heavy duty vehicular gas turbine engines devel- oped by the General Motors Research Laboratories. This new engine in- corporates a major engineering ad- vance, which not only improves part- load fuel economy to the point that rivals the diesel installed economy, but also provides engine braking equal to the rated output of the en- gine. These improvements result from a novel system called "power transfer," which connects the gasifier and power turbine shafts through a controlled torque coupling. This pa- per describes the system, its several applications, and development and evaluation studies. Discussion: L. E.

Prueser, United Aircraft Corp., Pratt &amp; Whitney Air- craft. This paper evaluates the per- formance potential of industrial and marine gas turbines. The power- plants considered here include vari- ous open cycles with intercooling, regeneration, and/ or reheat. The concept "flow path efficiency" is used to evaluate trends in the aerodynamic efficiency of previous gas turbines. The results show that additional im- portant advances in the performance of gas turbines can be expected pri- marily as a result of higher operating temperatures. 650716 Emergency Braking Sys- tems for School Buses. R. K. Su- per, Rockwell-Standard Corp., Brake Div. This paper emphasizes the up- grading of basic brake systems on school buses resulting from recent agreement by manufacturers on a minimum level of performance by which they will certify the total ve- hicle brake system. A review of the current status of service brake sys- tems is presented, along with a sum- mary of the various dual and emer- gency braking systems available for both hydraulic and air braked ve- hicles. Although several of these systems will provide school buses with adequate dual or secondary systems, they must be intelligently engineered and applied to provide the adequate stopping capability. 650717 Static Load Test Code For School Bus Body Structure. W. C. Rumph, Blue Bird Body Co. A static load test code for school bus body structure was developed to fur- nish a method of ascertaining the de- flection of the body at several points. This offers to school transportation personnel on the state and national levels a code to use as reference in school bus body specifications for the purpose of restricting the maximum limits of deflection of roof assemblies, side wall assemblies, and floor assem- blies. The body manufacturer is provided with a standard base for de- sign purposes, without limitations of material types, material gages, or structural sectional shapes. 650718 Development of a New Line of Small Compact Heavy- Duty Engines. R. D. Beard, Wis- consin Motor Corp. The effects of improved material and design tech- nology when applied to the problem of a new engine design are illustrated. The S-7D and S-8D engines (7.25 and 8.25 hp, respectively) represent the use of fewer parts than those of an existing Wisconsin engine of sim- ilar horsepower rating while retain- ing the typical heavy-duty Wisconsin ruggedness. 650719 McCulloch Model 170 ARC Welder. J. H. Brooks and R. V. Jackson, McCulloch Corp. The McCulloch welder's weight of 55 lb and output of 170 amp result in hand portability with adequate power for most welding applications. The key elements of its design are a light 148</page><page sequence="88">650720-650726 metal, high-speed, two-stroke cycle gasoline engine and a high frequency, capacitor compensated, inductor al- ternator. Features of the single-cyl- inder engine, the power increasing muffler, and the double diaphragm "pressure" carburetor are described, and the effects of unit weight, rotary inertia, and cylinder compression ra- tio on cranking effort are noted. In addition, the inductor alternator's magnetic and electrical circuits are explained and the output character- istics given. 650720 Handling Characteristics of Tractor-Trailer Combinations* F. Jindra, General Motors Defense Res. Labs. A simplified, linear anal- ysis is made of the lateral motions of a tractor-trailer combination consist- ing of a tractor, semitrailer, and full trailer, and traveling at a constant forward speed. Equations of motion are derived for the combined vehicle, and solutions of the resulting equa- tions are obtained and discussed in terms of the steady-state and transient response to steering control. Results of exploratory calculations are pre- sented to indicate the manner in which the dynamic lateral response is influenced by various vehicle design parameters. Discussion: W. D. Noon, Truck and Coach Div., General Motors Corp.; E. Chosy, Fruehauf Corp. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650721 Off tracking Calculation Charts for Trailer Combinations. H. Stevens, S. C. Tignor, and J. F. Lojacono, Bureau of Public Roads. Offtracking characteristics of single unit vehicles and combination vehicles are described. Offtracking values were obtained with scale models of ve- hicles making turns on turning radii varying from 25 to 225 feet. Indi- vidual vehicle offtrackings are in- fluenced by three variables : degree of turn, length of vehicle wheelbase, and turning radius. Research found that the offtracking is greatest when the projection of the rear axle axis passes through the turning radius center; even though the projections of the other axles on vehicle or trailer com- bination do not, at the same time, pass through the turning radius center.

The power dolly is a self-contained power unit installed in a converter dolly that is used between trailers in a doubles operation. Its main pur- pose is to provide additional tractive effort plus additional horsepower for performance to assist in meeting schedules when adverse weather and road conditions prevail. It also has a purpose in providing extra power and traction when heavier loadings are encountered such as in the use of triples or two 40 ft trailers on the throughways. 650725 Design and Application of Tri-Drive Trucks. A. N. Schup- pert, White Motor Corp., Lansing Div. The tri-drive vehicle was de- veloped to fill a specific need by oper- ators (primarily construction opera- tors) , to allow them to take advantage of increased maximum gross vehicle weights permissible in several states. In order to take advantage of these increased legal weights and furnish adequate vehicle capacity and mobil- ity, new components and new applica- tion standards were developed. This paper describes the problems encoun- tered and what was done to solve them during the developmental proj- ect. 650726 Add an Axle by the Use of an Equalizing Air Suspension. L. D. Masser, Neway Equipment Co. Independent Equalizing Air Suspen- sions are being added to trucks, trac- tors, and trailers in order to increase 149</page><page sequence="89">650727-650734 150 their capacity. That is, independent air suspensions are being combined with standard production suspensions so as to economically produce ve- hicles with greater versatility. Axle load equalization is obtained by reg- ulating air pressure to the air suspen- sion, which controls the load on the the independent axle. This paper describes the design and application of the independent equal- izing air suspension as used by the trucking industry. 650727 Design Data For "Cock- tail Shaker" Cooled Pistons and Valves. J. E. Bush, Marquette Univ.; and A. L. London, Stanford Univ. Cocktail shaker cooling is the commonly used term to describe heat transfer in a reciprocating hollow cyl- inder partially filled with a liquid. The sodium-filled valve is a widely used application of this heat transfer concept. This paper presents infor- mation that may be useful in the de- sign of cocktail shaker cooled pistons and valves. The design data are pre- sented in nondimensional form using parameters typical of conventional convective heat transfer correlations. An illustrative problem for a piston is presented to show the application of the design data. Discussion: J. M.

The out- flow of the products of combustion from a two-stroke cycle diesel engine cylinder is examined and the numeri- cal analysis used hitherto supplanted by a direct integration method. It is found that the equations of outflow result in a nonlinear differential equa- tion capable of direct solution, thereby giving rapid computation of the ex- haust lead, one of the most important single criteria of the overall engine design. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650729 Development of a Shaft- less Submersible Motor. R. J. Flaherty, Jr. and W. C. Phillips, Jr., U.S. Navy Marine Engrg. Lab. A motor-pump combination is described that utilizes the rotor-stator surfaces as a water lubricated journal bearing.

The electric motor design is applicable to centrifugal, mixed flow, and axial flow pumps. 650730 Evaluation of the Alu- minaut Propulsion System. E. M. Briggs, Southwest Res. Inst.; and T. J. Gerkin, General Dynamics/Elec- tric Boat. With the advent of new interest in hydrospace, the manned, deep submersible has achieved a prominent place in oceanography and ocean engineering. Man-rated ves- sels capable of descending thousands of feet into the ocean have to be care- fully evaluated. A description of tests and evaluation procedures for the propulsion system of the Alu- minaut Submarine is given in this paper along with sample data ob- tained from these tests. 650731 Design Evolution of a Sea Water Filled Induction Mo- tor. F. D. Gaylord, Louis Allis Co. A squirrel cage induction motor has been designed for use while filled with sea water.

W. Henny, Hupp Corp., Hercules Eng., Div.; and R. Herrmann, Hispano-Suiza, France. Basic differences between the major diesel combustion systems are briefly discussed. Design details are given and the combustion process of the latest Hispano-Suiza combus- tion chamber is described. Develop- ment problems and their solutions of this combustion chamber in the DH- 3000 engine are summarized. The relatively clean exhaust, in compari- son with other engines, is a particular advantage of this combustion system and is demonstrated on the basis of test data. 650733 International Harvester- LABECO High BMEP Single Cyl- inder Research Engine. S. K. Chen and P. F. Flynn, International Harvester Co. This paper discusses the design and development of a sin- gle cylinder research engine which was used for combustion chamber development and for providing test data for cycle analysis. Two basic criteria for the International Har- vester engine were reproducible per- formance and freedom from mechan- ical problems. Three major designs were devel- oped to satisfy different experimental requirements, with the ultimate goal being the achievement of advanced combustion systems beyond present limits and reduction in the cost and time required for these developments. 650734 Factors Influencing Mea- surement of Tire Uniformity. D. L. Nordeen and R. E. Rasmussen, General Motors Res. Labs. Tire non- uniformities are a major source of vi- bration problems in vehicles. There is considerable disagreement on which tire uniformity parameters are impor- tant to vehicle noise and vibration problems, and on how these uniformity parameters should be measured. This paper is concerned primarily with the effects of the nonuniformities of the tire structure which cause contact patch force variations as the tire is rolled in a straight line at constant axle height. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS</page><page sequence="90">650752-650759 650752 Brazing and Diffusion Bonding of Titanium Alloys to Similar and Dissimilar Materials.

K. J. Miller and J. D. Nunnikhoven, AiResearch Mfg. Co. One of the most promising uses for the laser, to the welding engineer and to the designer of aerospace hard- ware, is its now proven potential as a fusion welding process. The use of the laser, in metallurgical joining, to join members which would be im- possible to fusion weld by any other fusion welding process with any de- gree of reliability are discussed. There are now indications that the laser process "begins" where the elec- tron beam process "leaves off" in the fusion welding of small components in close proximity to glass or ceramic seals. Details relative to the applica- tion of the process on various mate- rials, its effect on materials, and on various configurations which appear to be particularly adaptable for the process are given€ 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 6507 54 Joining Aluminum to Stainless Steel for Space Vehicle Applications. L. E. Gatzek, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The high per- formance, efficiency, and integrity de- manded in advanced aerospace mate- rials applications frequently require the metallurgical union of aluminum alloys to stainless steels. Salt-bath dip brazing and various plating tech- niques are currently used, but con- tinuing research and development programs will undoubtedly produce other reliable methods of joining the two intrinsically dissimilar metals. The limitations of this bimetallic couple have been overcome, and satis- factory bonding has been achieved. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650755 Future Aerospace Manu- facturing Educational Require- ments. A. S. Turner, Northrop Corp., Norair Div.; J. W. McKinney, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Rocket- dyne Div.; M. T. Chance, Douglas Aircraft Co.; and E. Richman, San Fernando Valley State College. An investigation of new design concepts and material technologies which are generating far-reaching changes in the educational requirements of the professional manufacturing man. The increasing complexity of the manufacturing environment has stim- ulated an examination of the antici- pated level of competence required in the diverse capabilities of the plan- ning engineer, tool engineer, indus- trial engineer, production engineer: all effort encompassed in the term, "manufacturing engineering." 650756 Electro-Optical Measure- ment and Alignment of Missile Systems. J. 0. Snyder, Air Force Materials Lab. A new optical align- ment system has been developed to obtain one arc-second accuracies to distances of 1000 ft. A solid state ruby laser as the system light source on a laboratory "breadboard" model demonstrated that desired accuracies can be obtained under adverse envi- ronmental conditions such as rain, fog and heat shimmer. This paper describes the development procedure, design problems and results of lab- oratory matching of the optical sys- tem and the power systems necessary to meet the accuracy requirements of extremely long/high rocket engines. The parameters for the development of this system cover the stacking and alignment of component sections dur- ing engine assembly, as well as precise alignment of the final assembled en- gine on the launch pad. 650757 Three-Way Vision via 3D Square. R. E. Brasier, Boeing Co. A recently developed three directional (3D) optical square establishes three mutually perpendicular lines-of-sight in one instrument setting. Since no realignment or rotation is required once it is aligned to a target, a sub- stantial savings in time and cost is realized in tool erection and routine checking. The instrument and its application at Boeing is discussed. 650758 Optical Thrust Chamber Calibration and Alignment. C. Kennedy, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Rocketdyne Div. The precise, in- stantaneous attitude control of a rocket in flight requires absolute alignment of both the true axis of thrust and the gimbal center relative to each other and to the vehicle axis. This necessitates checkout procedures on the completed rocket engine which accurately define and adjust the true axis of thrust in relation to the pivot center of the supporting gimbal. Op- tical metrological and alignment methods currently in use at Rocket- dyne make possible fast, as well as accurate, thrust chamber alignment checkouts. 650759 It Does Move None the Less - an Observation Of the Movement of Things that Appear To Be Stationary. D. D. Rhea, Northrop Corp., Norair Div. The effects of thermal instability in shop areas, static and dynamic loading, and floor movement are reported from the standpoint that, many times, the resultant structural movement ex- ceeds the allowable positioning toler- ance by a factor of ten, or greater. A logical relief from the prevailing method of expressing allowable toler- ance as an absolute value could be obtained by specifying an allowable deviation from the norm in the finished product (one part in ten thousand is suggested for major as- semblies). This, coupled with stan- dardization of shop temperature, would result in a superior product, produced at lower cost, than the cur- rent article. 151</page><page sequence="91">650760-650778 650760 Metal Deformation in Macrosonic Fields. B. Lange- necker, Naval Ordnance Test Station. With the powerful ultrasonic trans- ducers now available the apparent static forces necessary for plastic de- formation of metals can be markedly reduced; even high-strength metals can be fractured without application of an external static load. To use high acoustic power in large-scale forming processes, it is necessary to establish fundamental parameters such as acoustic energy density, heat- ing rate, and efficient coupling of sound and workpiece. Acoustic ra- diation is shown to affect material properties while aiding their plastic- ity, and limits can be determined within which sound can be applied without deteriorating properties. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650761 Vibrations - New Aid to Joining. R. Geliert, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Rocketdyne Div. Ul- trasonic energy is being used today to make solid-state metallurgical bonds without applying heat. Many previously unweldable metal combina- tions are now both easy and economi- cal to j oin. Fluxes, inert atmospheres, and elaborate cleaning procedures are no longer necessary. Ultrasonically assisted soldering makes it possible to solder to aluminum, silicon, ger- manium, and other metals, without the use of flux. The use of ultrasonic energy to assist fusion welding, arc welding, brazing, etc., is being investi- gated, and initial results show im- proved j oint characteristics and lower fusion temperatures. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650762 Ultrasonics as Applied to Metal Forming and Assembly Processes. L. Balamuth, Cavitron Ultrasonics, Inc. A review is pre- sented of recent progress on ultra- sonic metal deformation using high- frequency vibratory energy.

R. Friedman, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Rocketdyne Div. The success- ful application of adaptive control techniques to the drilling process will result in a reduction in drilling costs, and produce extra dividends in the appearance and accuracy of the holes drilled. The maintaining of closer tolerances, better finish, and improved entrance and exit condition are ad- vance indications that production drilling, particularly as applied to the tougher alloys, deep-hole drilling, and the drilling of small holes should be revolutionized by these techniques within the next few years. 650766 Manufacturing Large Production Quantities of Precise Solid Propellant Mixes. F. E. Skovgard and C. J. Barr, Lockheed Propulsion Co. Firing of four 156- in. diameter solid rocket engines for booster systems has required large quantities of solid propellant. This fuel -nearly two million pounds to date - has been mixed in 300-gal Baker-Perkins vertical mixers. This type of mixer was selected for the fol- lowing reasons:, (1) Maximum flexi- bility to permit changes in propellant formulation for various configura- tions; (2) Minimum capital invest- ment required to double capacity or replace; (3) Minimum schedule time required to put into operation; (4) More economical than a continuous mixer for production quantities up to 5,000,000 lb per month. 650767 Manufacturing Ablative Nozzles and Nose Cones. F. J. Rechin, TRW, Inc. A new process for the fabrication of thermal shields consisting of a continuous layup fab- rication process is presented. For this application a relatively new clan of materials called cermet ablatives is discussed briefly. The advent of large booster nozzles, while utilizing much of the current ablative process- ing techniques derived from smaller nozzles, created a series of joinery problems between metallics and non- metallics because of the size factor alone. 650770 Investment Castings in Advanced High-Strength Steels and Titanium Alloys. J. Ross, Misco Precision Casting Co. This paper discusses new technologies and alloys in the field of ferrous and ti- tanium alloy investment castings. It points out the advantages of proper management control and cites advan- tages of the investment casting proc- ess. There is a discussion on the subjects of tolerances, limitations, and new casting techniques. Finally a picture of what might be expected in the future for investment castings is presented. 650771 Research and Develop- ment Programs for Government and Industry. A. J. lier, Electronic Specialty Co. A survey of the vari- ous objectives, achievements, spon- sors and researchers associated with advanced founding development dur- ing the past ten years is presented. It, by no means, covers all of the sig- nificant effort put forth, but is in- tended to view, by broad perspective, the general field. The result aimed at is to focus attention to the impor- tance of casting research and develop- ment which is taking place during this time of transition, when casting production and utilization is chang- ing from the conventional to premium quality. 650778 Roll Diffusion Bonding, Potential Application to Aero- space Structures. C. H. Richard, Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab. The manufacture of sandwich-type 152</page><page sequence="92">650779-650785 structure by roll reduction diffusion bonding or "Jaffee-Metal" process is based on the solid-state diffusion proc- ess which occurs when two pieces of metal in intimate contact are heated and deformed simultaneously. De- tails of this process, its advantages, application problems, current status, and potential benefits are described. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650779 Press Bonding of Apollo Cold Plates. J. E. Collipriest, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Joining aluminum by diffusion bonding is be- coming a comparatively common topic for discussion. The application of diffusion bonding to the produc- tion of complex structures is more often discussed, however, than ac- complished. The Apollo cold plates are complex, they are made of alumi- num and are diffusion bonded on a production basis. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650780 Rapid Method for Diffu- sion Bonding Aerospace Struc- tures. F. K. Rose, International Harvester Co., Solar Div. A method is described for the rapid solid state diffusion bonding of sheet metal structures fabricated from refractory metals or dispersion-hardened metals such as TD Nickel. This process avoids the problems associated with welding or high-temperature brazing where overheating or fusion degrade or destroy the mechanical properties of the base metals. Lap joints and T- joints are made by this process in about 10 seconds through the appli- cation of pressure and heat while the workpiece is contained in a protective atmosphere. Joints, thus produced, are bonded over the entire faying sur- face and can be effectively coated for oxidation protection. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650782 Design for Airfreight Development - The Next Decade. M. A. Hiatt and K. C. Plewes, Boeing Co., Transport Div. The potential airfreight market is examined and found to be many-fold times the pres- ent level. Results are cited from a recent market forecast showing air- freight growth through 1975. The U.S. domestic segment is shown to involve cities of medium as well as large population, establishing the need for a jet cargo aircraft of medium size. A new design concept the QC (quick-change) convertible cargo/ passenger aircraft is described and an economic study of its application presented. Possible uses for a mixed cargo/passenger airplane are dis- cussed and the requirement for a ver- satile design capable of QC cargo, passenger, or mixed cargo/passenger interiors noted. Application of the QC concept will stimulate regional domestic airfreight and make possible profitable operation of regular jet air- freight into communities which now have only limited service. The QC airplane with its large earning power, low breakeven cost, and interior flex- ibility, is capable of developing the short-to-medium haul airfreight mar- ket while returning a profit to the airlines. 650784 Solution of the Airplane Minimum Time Problem by Huy- gen's Principle. H. Heermann, P. Kretsinger, and B. McCorkle, Lock- heed-California Co. The relation- ship between Huygens' principle in geometrical optics and the calculus of variations is examined. It is found that the calculus of variations is a straightforward generalization of the theory of geometrical optics. As a consequence, a new and simplified approach to the calculus of variations is obtained. This approach reduces problems in the calculus of variations to problems in ordinary maxima and minima in the calculus. The ap- proach rests heavily on the early work of C. Huygens, 1690, and John Ber- noulli, 1718, and its extension by W. Hamilton and C. Caratheodory. New numerical techniques, suggested by this approach are examined and com- pared and two of these are applied to the airplane minimum time problem. 650785 Cost/Weight Merit Func- tion for Aerospace Hardware De- sign. A. L. Kolom, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. An approach to opti- mum design employs a merit function of cost and weight for structural/ma- terial components and subsystems. Two steps are involved. The first is an analysis of the function and mis- sion of the vehicle so as to establish a trade-off figure of dollars versus weight. For a commercial vehicle, this is determined by economic anal- ysis of range, fuel costs, insurance, etc. For military vehicles, a win-loss gaming chart is used to illustrate the non-linear benefits of performance improvement through weight reduc- tion. For space vehicles, the value of weight will vary with the stage, from booster to orbit and to escape structure. The second step is the de- termination of both weights and costs of various structural/material con- figurations for any given design func- tion. Data obtained from company- funded research studies of over 50 structural/material designs are pre- sented for uniaxial compression and pressure panel applications. Meth- ods of using cost/ weight charts for determining optimum structural con- cepts are shown. A more general ap- proach to the cost/ weight merit func- tion based on application of various structural materials, is also presented. This points out the required weight reduction to justify employment of more expensive materials, such as titanium, beryllium, and boron com- posites. The limits on beneficial use of chem-milling or machining for weight reduction is also presented. The cost/ weight merit function ap- proach is a practical tool for optimi- zation of structural configurations of all fabricated hardware, from air- frames to engines and from subma- rines to space ships. 153</page><page sequence="93">650786-650793 650786 Meteoroid Design Cri- teria. J. F. Lundeberg, Boeing Co. The effects of meteoroid-protection weight requirements on space-explo- ration costs are examined. A basis is developed for selecting upper and lower bounds to the acceptable risk. The quality of present knowledge of the meteoroid environment and of hypervelocity-impact penetration is reviewed. This information is syn- thesized and criteria are developed that are suitable for selecting methods of designing simple and composite barrier systems. Techniques are established for controlling damage to spacecraft components. Short- and long-term goals are recommended to improve present design capability. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650787 Manned-Automatic Spaceborne Structural Assembly. P. Slysh and V. M. Andreone, Gen- eral Dynamics/Convair. The space- borne structural assembly technique named RATIO includes methods for dividing structures into structural modules capable of being nested and of configuring mechanisms for the automatic or semi-automatic assem- bly of the modules. The modules and mechanisms may themselves be rigid or expandable structures. The technique is applicable to deploying such structures as reflectors for anten- nas and solar concentrators, booms, extended-area solar panels, as well as to cylindrical, lenticular, and toroidal space stations and reentry bodies. Descriptions are presented of two ex- amples of the technique applied to deploying paraboloidal reflector an- tennas. 650788 Joining, the Real Chal- lenge in Use of Advanced Struc- tures. W. T. Barker, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The method of attach- ment and the effects of the joining method are of equal importance to the selection of materials. Exotic materials, sandwiches, composites, thin multilayered, and truss type con- figurations are presently being con- ceived, tested as simple beams and columns, and immediately converted into briefing charts. Joining design problems arising from inadequate consideration of practical factors are shown. Examples are given ranging from the WW II aircraft (a collection of holes held together with fasteners) to the present day space vehicles' fastening system. 650789 Challenge of Materials for Supersonic Transport. R. Carter, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. General technical requirements are presented which led to the selection of titanium alloys as the basic struc- tural material for a Mach 2.7 super- sonic transport. Discussion includes important material properties such as strength, toughness, corrosion and stress corrosion resistance, metal- lurgical stability, and fatigue. Fab- rication characteristics are briefly dis- cussed. 650790 Problems of Transition from Aluminum to Exotic Mate- rials in Aerospace Structures. E. W. Emmerich, R. L. Jones, and E. D. Jacobs, Norair Div., Northrop Corp. It is now necessary to imple- ment a systems engineering approach to structural design of aerospace ve- hicles in order to solve the interdis- ciplinary problems encountered be- tween concept and product. Higher temperatures and loads beyond the structural limits of aluminum alloys dictate exotic materials ranging from titanium through the refractory ma- terials to ceramics. This paper pre- sents an approach to transitional problems in application of these ma- terials, from basic material selection considerations across all of the de- sign, processing, and manufacturing technologies. Methodologies are summarized in the brazing of molyb- denum, the hot forming of titanium alloys, welding and machining of titanium, and adhesive bonding tech- niques. 650791 Radioisotope Power Sub- systems for Space Application. E. T. Mahefkey and D. F. Berganini, Air Force Aeropropulsion Lab. Space power requirements in the .1-10 kw regime are imminent. Ra- dioisotope power subsystems poten- tially satisfy these requirements. This paper examines the technical ad- vancements necessary to realize the potential utility of radioisotope power subsystems. Isotope heat source and conversion devices are considered. A survey of isotope production costs and rates is presented. Isotope heat source, cladding compatibility, and operational safety requirements are reviewed. The performance of the Brayton (argon) and Rankine (mer- cury and Dowtherm "A") cycles is outlined. Thermoelectric and ther- mionic converter performance is also reviewed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650792 Advanced Radioisotope Thermoelectric Space Power Sys- tem. D. Elias and I. Gray, Martin Co., Nuclear Div. A radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) us- ing curium-242 as fuel, developed as an alternate power supply, has been shown to be compatible with the Atlas-Centaur and Surveyor space- craft requirements. This power sup- ply provides a relatively low weight and highly reliable system capable of producing 25 watts output under lunar conditions for a mission life of 120 days. The system is unique in that it utilizes a thermal control sys- tem that maintains a relatively con- stant thermal input to the energy con- version components. Maj or program effort was focused on nuclear safety, thermoelectric generator develop- ment, converter development, and system qualification tests. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650793 SNAP 10A, First Reac- tor in Space. R. A. Johnson, W. T. Morgan, and S. R. Rocklin, North Amer. Aviation, Inc., Atomics Intl. Div. The first nuclear reactor space power system, SNAP 10A, was suc- cessfully flight tested in April 1965. 154</page><page sequence="94">650794-650801 This paper includes a description of the reactor-thermoelectric system and the development program that pre- ceded the flight. Special emphasis is given to the endurance test experi- ence gained from the nuclear ground test system. The flight test is de- scribed in detail and the knowledge gained from the test is given. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650794 Fracture Toughness and Crack Propagation Properties of Candidate Mach 3 Transport Ma- terials. P. H. Denke, C. W. Bentley, and R. T. Hunt, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc., Aircraft Div. Some results of the supersonic transport materials re- search conducted by Douglas-McDon- nell in the areas of fracture toughness, and by Douglas in the area of crack propagation, are presented. The re- sults of tests on centrally notched fracture toughness specimens of steels, titaniums, and superalloys are de- scribed. The crack propagation stud- ies show the results of testing cracked specimens under uniaxial and biaxial states of stress at room and elevated temperatures, and the extent of ma- terial deterioration in stiffened panels. Methods of analyses for crack prop- agation and residual crack strength are presented and comparisons are made between analysis and test. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650796 A New High-Tempera- ture Bearing Material. M. K. Mukherjee, Midwest Res. Inst. The failure of conventional bearing ma- terials used both in aerospace and high temperature automotive appli- cations can be minimized when an intermetallic phase or suitable alloy is used which has a crystal structure similar to that of a high temperature solid lubricant. Sintering appears to be the most suitable manufacturing process for the new material bearing. By intel- ligent selection of the desired alloy powder, and by sintering directly in the mold, the quality of the bearing should be improved, and a wide variety of materials can be used. Future advancement of the bearing lies in the possibility of using a suit- able precipitation hardenable high temperature material, thus ensuring good maintenance characteristics and reliability. Further improvement in high temperature performance may also be obtained through the use of solid lubricants like MoS2, etc. 650797 Challenge of Perform- ance Spectrum for Military Air- craft - The Meaning of Speed. H. Multhopp, Martin Marietta Corp. The relations of the speed of air- planes to their range, endurance, maneuverability capabilities are re- viewed with regard to their military value. For each task some optimum speed regime does exist which is sometimes higher or lower than tra- ditional requirements. It is usually worthwhile to design the aircraft for best performance in its functional speed regime, rather than for top speeds which see little use. A prefer- ence of extreme solutions is indi- cated: if fast action is needed hyper- sonic aircraft should be considered; for close distance combat, highly maneuverable subsonic aircraft ap- pear most effective. 650798 Technological Advance- ments Resulting from XB-70 Performance Requirements. D. B. Rogerson, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. Typical of the major tech- nological advancement and practi- cal applications evolved during the B-70 program are the application of the compression lift and folding wing tip concepts ; utilization of stain- less steel honeycomb, titanium, and high-strength tool steel in airframe structure; development of hydraulic systems components, such as pumps, actuators, and fittings with metallic seals to operate at 4000 psi and 450 F ; and development of high-tempera- ture, high-altitude a-c electrical com- ponents, such as true a-c coil relays and an all-electric throttle system. Experience accumulated during XB- 70 development and testing confirms their applicability to other current and future aerospace systems, such as the SST and the C-5A. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650799 Effect on Airplane and Flexible Pavement Design of Varying Design Tire Pressure from 60 to 360 Psi. R. C. Carter, Boeing Co. Landing gear weight, wheel well volume, and allowable traffic are compared for selected one, two, three, four, six, and eight wheel landing gears on 100,000 to 400,000 lb airplanes. The relative ground flotation capabilities of each gear type was determined by the California Bearing Ratio method of flexible pavement analysis. Tire pressure was varied from 60 to 360 psi. For equal weight and/or wheel well vol- ume the gears with four, six, and eight tires per strut had approxi- mately equal capabilities and were appreciably better than the one, two, and three wheel gears. Tire spacing rather than tire pressure had the most effect on flotation. 650800 Procedures for Use in the Performance Prediction of Proposed Aircraft Designs. J. E. Linden, Navy Dept., Bureau of Naval Weapons. An empirical method for predicting subsonic minimum drag, drag-due-to-lift, and subsonic drag rise of proposed jet aircraft designs is presented. The method is designed for use in the absence of wind tunnel test data on a model of the specific configuration of interest. Estimates, based on this method, have correlated well with flight test results. 650801 Reusable Space Launch Vehicle Concepts: Outlook 1965. R. Vaglio-Laurin and R. G. Finke, Institute for Defense Analyses. A critical review of the principal issues governing the feasibility of reusable space launch vehicle systems, that is, propulsion, structural weights, heat 155</page><page sequence="95">650802-650809 protection, and costs, is presented from the vantage point of 1965. The dependence on flight Mach number of the fuel specific impulse of airbreath- ing propulsion systems, that is, turbo- jets, ramjets, and scramjets, is re- duced to a dependence on staging velocity of effective specific impulse values, including flight losses, to pro- vide performance relations for pre- liminary design use. Reasonable configurations of rocket and air- breathing reusable vehicles are se- lected and the structural weights are characterized in terms of specific sur- face weights. Well-established sim- ple laminar and turbulent heat-trans- fer correlations and transition criteria are used to calculate the temperature histories and distributions on the windward side of slab delta wings during reentry. 650802 Economic Justification of Reusable Rocket Vehicles. C. W. Spieth, Martin Co. The eco- nomic feasibility of the all-rocket ap- proach to a reusable launch system is investigated. Comparisons of three classes of launch vehicles are made, and two of these types (the Titan IIIC and the partially reusable launch system) are also compared when the option of payload recovery through the use of a reentry vehicle is in- cluded. The economic influence of payload recovery capability is in- cluded in parametric form. It is shown that the economic feasibility of reusable launch systems is influenced strongly by the need for payload re- covery. 650803 Heat Transfer Unit Eval- uates Performance of Jet Fuels for Supersonic Aircraft. K. C. Bachman, Esso Res. &amp; Engrg. Co. Fuel used as a coolant in the super- sonic transport can degrade thermally and affect heat transfer surfaces. A heat transfer unit developed by Esso Research to follow the course of de- gradation reactions and to relate de- posit formation to heat transfer rates has been used under a Federal Avia- tion Agency program to study fuels varying widely in quality. Data re- veal that oxygen disappearance, per- oxide buildup, and deposit formation are interrelated and can be roughly correlated with fuel composition. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650804 Fuels for Advanced Air- Breathing Weapon Systems. A. V. Churchill, J. A. Hager, and A. E. Zengel, Air Force Aero Propulsion Lab. Properties and problems of jet fuels used in present military aircraft are compared with those intended for use in future high Mach number air- craft. Fuels are under development with improved thermal stability and heat sink capacity. These include conventional hydrocarbon fuels as well as those utilizing vaporizing and endothermic reactions to obtain higher heat absorbing capacity. Boron slurry fuels, high density fuels, and cryogenic hydrocarbons are be- ing developed for possible use in special applications. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650805 Economical Mach 3+ SST Fuel - Available Now. R. P. Foster and E. M. Sutphin, Gulf Res. &amp; Dev. Co. New refining processes, involving hydrogen and improved catalysts, have been developed by which high quality aircraft hydrocar- bon fuels can be prepared. The use of these processes will enable the petroleum refiner to produce such fuels in quantity at favorable cost. The physical properties and charac- teristics of several of these fuels are described in this paper. 650806 Stopped and Slow Rotor Aircraft Configuration. L. Cel- niker, R. M. Carlson and R. E. Don- ham, Lockheed-California Co. Fun- damental limitations on the forward flight speed of compound helicopters are of such a nature as to suggest that further increases in forward flight speed may be obtained by reducing main rotor rpm and altering basic rotor geometry. 650807 V/STOL Transport Air- craft for Air Cargo Operations. G. B. Pearson, Vought Aero. Div., LTV Aerospace Corp. V/STOL technology as existent in the next decade could provide an aircraft suit- able for use in commercial air cargo systems and which would be highly compatible with intercity freight movement requirements, and offer the shipper a clear-cut dollar benefit over transit systems absorbing that portion of the intercity freight market having the greatest potential for penetration. Unusual opportunities for private enterprise will exist during the imple- mentation of the V/STOL concept. An entirely new dimension will be added to the air terminal concept of today; the role of the air freight for- warder will be distended to encom- pass air cargo operations for 500 miles or less; and a new concept in real estate development pends public attachment to the V/STOL air park. 650808 Control Requirements and Control Methods for Large V/ STOL Aircraft. T. E. Lollar, F. J. Bus, and D. M. Dolliver, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. The control of large V/STOL aircraft presents an exacting design challenge. The effect of airplane size on V/STOL control requirements is examined in terms of maneuvering control vis a vis sta- bilization control. The penalties in- curred from designing to various con- trol levels are then shown. 650809 Human Factors Chal- lenges in Manned Space Flight. S. Deutsch, National Aero. &amp; Space Admin. This paper deals with a few of the important problem areas in- volved in a long duration manned space flight. Some of the problems discussed in detail that will be en- countered in an extended space voy- age are space vehicle maintenance and extra-vehicular activities, visual skill performance, and manual and automatic control of spacecraft sys- 156</page><page sequence="96">650810-650817 tems. Although some of these areas have been studied in the Mercury and Gemini programs, additional testing must be undertaken before successful extended manned space flights can be carried out. 650810 Enhancement of Space Powerplant Reliability by Crew Action. P. Duchon and L. K. Peter- sen, Aerojet-General Corp., Von Kar- man Center. The man-powerplant reliability interface is discussed with emphasis on manned versus auto- matic sensing and control. Judg- ment and recognition of powerplant performance and the ability to cor- rect abnormal conditions with man included in redundant-component systems results in higher system re- liability. An expression for a man- plus - automatic - redundant- component subsystem is presented that gives the subsystem reliability vs the reliability of its parts. 650811 Manned Control - Direct and Remote. A. M. Mayo, LTV Astronautics Div., LTV Aerospace Corp. Previous violent controversies concerning the value of manned versus unmanned space exploration are being resolved to a significant degree. Improved understanding of man's role in space exploration and more effective means of utilizing man as a part of "automatic," "remotely controlled," and "directly manned" space exploration systems are evolv- ing. The advocates of both manned and unmanned space exploration are making progress in a direction pro- viding mutual support. As a result, an overall increase in the rate and effectiveness of the gathering of knowledge from space is likely. This paper describes current developments. 650812 Biomedical Require- ments for Manned Space Flight. W. M. Helvey, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. The design and planning lead time required for future manned space programs requires that ade- quate biomedical data be acquired in the immediate future. American and Russian space experience is reviewed in terms of such factors as: weight- lessness, dynamic factors, ionizing ra- diation, cabin atmosphere contami- nants, thermal environment, biological rhythms, and psychophysiological factors. Recommendations are then presented for biomedical require- ments for second generation manned space flights. 650813 Man-Machine Aspects of a Four-Man Space Cabin Simu- lator. C. R. Adams, R. D. Dunlap, and R. L. Batterton, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. This paper recapitulates the major design, development, and management of a program for the engineering development of inte- grated spacecraft environmental con- trol and life support systems and for the solution of man-machine integra- tion problems. The different phases of the program are applicable to a family of manned space laboratories and manned interplanetary space vehicles. Simulation techniques in- clude the use of space-laboratory- types of life support subsystems hard- ware of flight type, but not neces- sarily of flight weight. Most of the preliminary results of the first phase of this program and future phases are discussed in this paper, and future phases are reviewed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650814 Extension of Drain Pe- riods In Gas Turbine Engines Using Improved Synthetic Lubri- cants. H. W. Reynolds, Jr., United Aircraft Corp., Pratt &amp; Whitney Air- craft Div. Increases in operating temperatures and the rapid advance- ment of time intervals between over- hauls has placed greater demands on the temperature-time capabilities of Type 1 synthetic lubricants used for airline operated gas turbine engines. The development of Type 2 lubricants with better high temperature capabili- ties coupled with an improved oil monitoring technique made possible rapid advances in oil use time and provided the airline operator with a potentially useful maintenance tool. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650815 Practical Approach to Jet Engine Lubricant Evaluation. N. T. Bartholomaei and H. T. Mar- shall, Texaco, Inc. ; and H. N. Taylor, United Air Lines, Inc. Using actual parts from a typical jet engine, a test rig was designed and constructed. Operating under typical jet engine conditions, the rig was capable of dif- ferentiating between oils on the basis of seal deposits and used oil data. The possibility also existed that dif- ferences in carbon seal wear rate could be determined. Final correla- tion of the results with field informa- tion will determine if the differences noted are significant. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650816 A Look At MIL-L-23699 (WEP) Lubricants. E. H. Weh- ner and A. G. Sundberg, General Elee. Co., Flight Propulsion Div. Laboratory, component, and engine tests have been conducted by General Electric Co. to evaluate the various lubricant properties important to the J79 jet engine. Such properties as elastomer volume swell, oxidation- corrosion, coking characteristics and lubricity were evaluated. Effects of these various properties on engine performance and how the laboratory results relate to component results and engine test results are discussed. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650817 Multipurpose Aeronauti- cal Lubricating Greases. M. J. Devine, E. R. Lamson, and L. Staff- ings, Naval Air Engrg. Center. A description of the use and limitations is provided for a range of aeronauti- cal lubricating greases specified for military vehicles and components. In addition, information covering the reduction of a number of grease types based on the properties of multipur- pose lubricants is shown in terms of consolidated requirements. The pos- sibilities for future consolidations by multipurpose grease development are also outlined. 157</page><page sequence="97">650818-650825 158 650818 Analog Versus Digital Data Analysis; An Introduction. D. N. Keast, Bolt Beranek and New- man Inc. This paper summarizes the various procedures for the an- alysis of dynamic data. Examples are given of analog and digital methods for selected types of anal- yses. The relative merits of analog versus digital processing in terms of reliability, speed, cost, flexibility, and accessibility are examined It is con- cluded that analog analysis methods have the advantages of low cost, accessibility, and flexibility; whereas digital methods have the advantages of high speed, reliability, and capa- bility for handling complex analyses. It is speculated that there are possible directions for combining the advan- tages and minimizing the limitations of both types of analysis. 650819 Digital Preprocessing Technique for Vibration Data. G. M. Moseley, Brown Engrg. Co., Inc. The technique used at the NASA, George C. Marshall Space Flight Center for digital preprocess- ing of vibration data is described. Preprocessing of vibration data re- sults in "quick look" oscillograms for use by vibration analysts in selecting time periods for digital analysis, as well as conversion of raw analog data to digital form. Discussion is limited to Saturn launch vehicle vibration data and the processes involved in preparing these data for digital anal- ysis. Some of the preprocessing problems that have been experienced during the Random Vibration Anal- ysis Program (RAVAN) are pre- sented, along with criteria for reject- ing questionable data. 650820 Detection and Correc- tion for Measurement Error. D. W. Lane, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. Measurement system error is considered from the standpoint of processing dynamic calibration data and applying corrections to measured test data. The sinusoidal and ran- dom modes of calibration are treated together with frequency and time do- main modes of correction. Examples of system noise detection are dis- cussed. Digital techniques for effi- cient and accurate analysis and synthesis, with examples of their effectiveness with actual measurement systems, are also presented. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650821 Digital Spectral Anal- ysis. L. D. Enochson and R. K. Otnes, Measurement Analysis Corp. Overall procedures to perform digital spectral analysis are described, in- cluding the necessary equations and analytical procedures to compute the power spectral density functions by the usually employed correlation transformation method. The details which must be considered to obtain proper statistical estimates of power spectral density functions from ran- dom data are discussed and statistical variability and bias of the spectrum estimates are reviewed. In addition to the basic statistical problems, a brief discussion reviewing measure- ment and data processing and reduc- tion problems are presented. It is apparent from the discussion that statistical variability due to finite record lengths, as well as many other errors can occur in the actual data collection and analysis. The many programming problems which arise in addition to those that occur in pre- paring the computational procedures are discussed. Also, some of the con- siderations necessary to prepare proper input and output programs are mentioned. These considera- tions constitute a roughly complete review of the overall problem of digital spectral analysis. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650822 Matrix Treatment of Waves in Mechanical Systems. L. A. Pipes, California Univ., and Aerospace Corp. The use of ma- trices in the mathematical solution of problems in mechanical engineering has become increasingly popular. The matrix formulation of the analy- sis is flexible and gives a broad and unified outlook on the problems discussed. In recent years it has been applied to the solution of tor- sional vibration problems, to the study analysis of mechanical filters, and to the study of the vibrations of beams and other structures. This paper is intended to show how the theory of wave propagation finds a very natural development in the lan- guage of matrices in mechanical sys- tems that have concentrated or "lumped parameters" and also in systems that have continuously dis- tributed parameters. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650823 Aero-Acoustic Excitation of Structures. A. Powell, David Taylor Model Basin. Two important sources or random aeroacoustic ex- citation of aerospace structures are the jets of both gas turbines and rockets, and turbulent boundary layers. Their dominant character- istics relevant to their loading of structures, such as the cross-correla- tion in narrow frequency bands of the pressure field, are outlined to- gether with those principal theoretical approaches to the estimation of the resultant response which are avail- able to aid the designer. 650824 Reflections on Random Vibration. C. T. Morrow, Aero- space Corp. A review of trends of thought in shock and vibration en- gineering over the past 10-15 years reveals many questions to which only partial answers are available and only partial answers may be expected in the foreseeable future. There re- main many situations where refined theory must be tempered with prac- tical judgment. 650825 Techniques for Measur- ing and Analyzing Random Data. J. S. Bendat, Measurement Analysis Corp. Techniques developed for measuring and analyzing random data in fields such as vibration, acous- tics, seismology, and oceanography offer possibilities for new improve- ments in design and performance of systems. Basic theory and recent work on these matters are discussed in this paper, including methods for characterizing and estimating various parameters of nonstationary data. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS</page><page sequence="98">650826-650834 650826 Keeping the Boeing 727 Self -Sufficient - A Year's Service with An On-Board Auxiliary Power Unit. W. Murray, Ameri- can Airlines, Inc. ; and A. F. Bullard, United Air Lines, Inc. This paper reports on the utilization and prob- lems encountered using a gas turhine engine as the power source for an aircraft mounted auxiliary power system. The information presented is based on a year's operation of the Boeing 727 by two major airlines, American and United. 650827 Progress in Constant- Speed-Drive Generating Systems. F. R. Cordon and D. J. Hucker, Sund- strand Aviation. This paper reviews the progress which has been realized in constant speed drives, generators, and control equipment for today's constant frequency electric systems for aircraft. Equipment evolution over the past twenty years is dis- cussed with particular reference to meeting the ever-increasing require- ments of the air vehicle, while con- tinually minimizing generating equip- ment weight. 650828 Integrated Secondary Power System (ADS). P. R. Wood and W. W. Spragins, AiRe- search Mfg. Co. Operational re- quirements point to the need for on- board APU's on both supersonic transports and VTOL-type aircraft. Three approaches for incorporation of an APU are described. In gen- eral, an APU with pneumatic output only provides an attractive approach for larger four-engine aircraft, par- ticularly were ground air condition- ing of cargo or passenger spaces may require a large airflow during ground operation. Approaches in which an integrated free-turbine-type APU or a fixed-shaft-type APU plus a torque converter are used are competitive for smaller aircraft. However, decisions in all cases must be based upon spe- cific aircraft requirements. 650829 X-15 Research Vehicle Auxiliary Power System. H. E. Louie, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. The auxiliary power system of the X-15 airplane represents a unique- ness in its application. It must op- erate continuously in flight, in a space environment, during zero gravity, during reentry heating, and for a period of time which often exceeds the X-15 rocket engine operation by 1400 sec. The X-15 auxiliary power system must provide both hydraulic and closely regulated 400-cycle elec- trical power for operation of various X-15 systems. This paper describes the system, its functions, and its major components. A brief intro- duction to an X-15 research mission is included to illustrate the integra- tion requirements of the auxiliary power system to the X-15 and the research system. 650830 Reaction Control Sys- tems for V/STOL Aircraft. W. K. Thames, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. A reaction control system is de- fined in terms of the source of power available, the working fluid of the system, the delivery system, the thrust producing devices and their point of application - the control point. The relationship of the propulsion and re- action control systems are identified as independent, partly dependent, and interdependent. Geometric configur- ations for reaction control systems are presented along with the classifica- tions of the power source. Results of a simple reaction control systems analysis are presented showing the progressive systems comparison with respect to the impact on the total system weight (includes the propul- sion and the reaction control system) . 650831 Lift Fan Propulsion Sys- tems - V/ STOL Aircraft Con- trol. E. F. Beeler and L. J. Volk, General Elee. Co. This paper dis- cusses aircraft control power require- ments provided by lift fan systems. Gas power transfer is described and estimated performance presented. A performance comparison is made be- tween the thrust spoiling system used in the present Army XV-5A flight re- search vehicle and a gas power trans- fer system. Gas power can provide adequate aircraft control forces. Thrust spoiling is not needed for fan dynamic response, use of a phase lead network in the control circuit of a gas power transfer system can pro- vide sufficiently rapid fan dynamic response. 650833 Challenge of Alternate Approaches to the Achievement of Lunar Exploration and Ex- ploitation. D. Paul III, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. The manned lunar scientific programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the time frame im- mediately following the Apollo and the Apollo Extension Systems pro- grams are considered and assessed. Advanced Earth-Moon transportation systems concepts, appropriate to the ensuing exploration phase of lunar activity, have been considered and applicable exploration concepts pro- posed. This paper concludes that a Mobile Exploration System for Apollo (MESA) concept provides an interim approach to lunar explora- tion and exploitation offering signifi- cant scientific accomplishments. Its compatibility with the longer range objective of lunar exploitation makes the MESA concept especially attrac- tive as the next step beyond Apollo applications toward lunar conquest. 650834 A Systematic Approach to Shelter Design For Lunar Ex- ploration. F. W. McRae and G. L. Mitcham, Boeing Co., Aerospace Div. Lunar exploration will move into reality with the initial landing of two men on the lunar surface through Project Apollo. While the major emphasis is now on the first manned landing, it seems not too early to take a closer look at what might possibly follow this initial landing. Any program of lunar exploration will require extended stay time of personnel. This paper will discuss the technical problems imposed by the lunar environment upon shelter 159</page><page sequence="99">650835-650844 160 design to house personnel and the necessary subsystems to support man in this environment. It also presents a modular approach to shelter design that could form the basis for ex- panded lunar operations as needed. The analysis of the environment and the preliminary design of a lunar shelter has clearly shown that a shelter can be designed to operate on the lunar surface for periods up to two years. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650835 Manufacture of Propel- lants for the Support of Ad- vanced Lunar Bases. S. D. Ros- enberg, R. L. Beegle, Jr., G. A. Guter, F. E. Miller, and H. Rothenberg, Aerojet-General Corp. The Aerojet Carbothermal Process for manufac- ture of oxygen from lunar resources has three essential steps: (1) reduc- tion of silicate with methane to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen ; (2) reduction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen to form methane and water; and (3) electrolysis of water to form oxygen and hydrogen. This cyclic process does not depend upon the presence of water or water pre- cursors in the lunar materials; it will produce oxygen from silicates regard- less of their precise composition and fine structure. Estimates are made of weight, power, and labor require- ments for the operation of three dif- ferent size lunar chemical plants for the manufacture of propellant oxygen from lunar raw materials. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650838 Surface Transportation Systems for Lunar Operations. S. Romano, General Motors Defense Res. Labs. This paper presents one possible approach to the development of standard vehicular systems for op- eration on the lunar surface. To establish a basis for design, a model of a lunar exploration program is de- veloped, including the assumption of certain types of lunar installations, their appropriate phasing in the total exploration plan, and a listing of vehicular requirements for each level of activity. The evolution of a po- tential family of lunar exploration vehicular systems is discussed, includ- ing a brief description of the develop- ment of a design concept for such sys- tems. 650839 Higher Propulsive Effi- ciency in Subsonic Aircraft. A. N. Clifton and J. Wotton, British Air- craft Corp. (Operating) Ltd. The effect of varying fan ratios 0-8 is examined, with particular reference to high subsonic transports. Front and aft fan ratios up to 5 show pro- gressive advantages in direct operat- ing cost. When mounted as a group of three, with the center engine in- gesting fuselage boundary layer, aft fan ratios up to 7 are worth while, and these values will rise as lower sizes, weights, and drags result from engineering developments, such as fan-turbine units optimized to suit particular aeroplanes and variable pitch fans incorporating thrust re- versal. 650840 Dynamic Measurements of Forward Gas Expulsion dur- ing High-Speed Stall of Jet En- gines. J. S. Afford and I. W. Vic- tor, General Elee. Co., Large Jet Eng. Dept. Dynamic measurements taken in a length of pipe mounted in front of a full-scale engine which was in- tentionally stalled at high corrected speed clearly demonstrate that gases hot enough to stall adjacent engines are expelled forward for a consider- able distance. As a consequence, the isolation length of the inlet duct and the provision of adequate stall margin is required to assure compatible inlet flow conditions in clustered engine installations. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650841 Meeting the Challenge of the Expanding Performance Spectrum : Xß-7 OA Propulsion System. E. S. Steele, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. This paper provides design and operational information on some of the components and sub- systems of the Mach 3 XB-70A pro- pulsion system, including the engine installation and servicing features, the sophisticated three-regime engine compartment cooling system, the en- gine starting system, and the electri- cally powered thrust control system. The mechanical drive system for the aircraft power accessories is described and results of integrated engine-drive system testing are shown. The paper is oriented toward providing informa- tion on some of the problems encoun- tered and solutions achieved in de- signing hardware for a Mach 3 environment. 650842 Air Transport Landing Gear Maintenance. W. W. Witt, United Air Lines, Inc. This paper presents the experience of an air transport operator with landing gear design and operation. Similar land- ing gear problems seem to recur with each new model airplane. These problems are explained from an air- line viewpoint in hopes of improving design for better maintenance and performance of future landing gears. 650843 Challenges in Landing Gear Design for V/STOL Ser- vice. W. C. Albach and K. J. Fewel, LTV Aerospace Corp. If operating restrictions are to be avoided in V/STOL service, features and capa- bilities beyond conventional landing gear requirements are necessary. Challenges imposed by longer strokes, drift landings, and take-offs without forward velocity, high ground flota- tion, and rough field operation must be met without exceeding exception- ally low weight targets. The general approach to the design of the XC- 142A, a V/STOL transport, landing gear system is described. Certain design features resulting from V/ STOL requirements are described in detail. 650844 Soft and Rough Field Landing Gears. W. W. Williams, W. C. J. Garrard, and G. K. Williams, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The frequent use of large transport aircraft on soft and rough airfields in or near battle zones requires that they be fitted with</page><page sequence="100">650845-650851 landing gears having increased capa- bility for ground flotation and shock absorption. Design and parametric studies of aircraft landing gears show feasible approaches to the problems associated with soft and rough air- fields. Landing gear concepts, an- alytical methods, and design parame- ters are presented for airplanes of 110,000-750,000 lb gross weight. Landing gear weights, sizes, and con- figurations are compared, and their soft and rough field capabilities are evaluated. Structural and dynamic aspects of rough field operations are discussed for bare soil fields and for fields covered with landing mats. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650845 Simulation of High Sink Speed Landing Gear. R. R. Dea- kins and C. L. Blackburn, North Amer. Aviation, Inc. This paper discusses the analytical simulations employed by Columbus Div. of North American Aviation in analysis of landing gear for A-5 aircraft, Apollo, and OV-10A. A brief development of the mathematical simulations with the basic equations of motion is in- cluded, along with methods used to predict the loads due to running over arresting cables or deck lights. The method of obtaining internal load distributions of the vehicle structure is also given. Where available, re- sults of the analyses are compared with experimentally measured data. Finally, a discussion of the validity and applicability of the methods to- gether with the conclusions based on the results are presented. 650846 Requirements for Run- way Lighting. R. Horonjeff, Cali- fornia Univ. This paper concerns itself with runway lighting require- ments, particularly for Category II operations. It deals with the pa- rameters that must be considered in designing an effective lighting system, and discusses the role of such factors as cockpit-cutoff angle and back- ground brightness. In addition, the paper briefly describes a test facility in which landings can be simulated and runway lighting systems, on a reduced scale, can be observed in artificially produced fog of any de- sired density. It also summarizes the results of extensive tests performed in this facility and describes an effective lighting system evolving from the tests. 650847 Care and Feeding of All- Weather Landing Systems in Air- line Service. W. T. Farrish, United Air Lines, Inc. All weather landing systems are currently being designed or proposed for U.S. airline transport aircraft. This paper suggests some areas of concern in the maintenance of such equipment as viewed by one airline engineering group. The basic design required by the operational and safety criteria can and must pro- duce a system that is readily main- tainable. The maintainability re- quirements need not be compromised, if properly considered in the initial layout of system components and associated safety monitors. 650848 Flight Testing the 707 Automatic Landing System. B. S. Wygle, Boeing Co., Airplane Div. The Boeing-Bendix Automatic Land- ing System has been certified by the FAA for visual touchdowns as a first step toward 700 ft RVR operations. To obtain this certification, the flight test program had to solve several op- erational problems in order to meet rigid FAA requirements. All rea- sonably possible failures, including hardovers just prior to touchdown, were introduced during the approach. Performance had to be tailored for satisfactory results on noisy ILS, as well as Category II facilities. 650849 Wet-Motor Fan-Heater for Cryogenic Oxygen. S. R. Phillips, Cosmodyne Corp. This pa- per describes a fan and electric heater unit that circulates and heats oxygen at 2400 psig and -170 F in a space vehicle storage tank. The motor, ball bearings, and all other parts of the unit are fully exposed to oxygen and are made of oxygen-compatible mate- rials. The paper includes an expla- nation of heat-transfer design meth- ods, a description of the unit and its parts, some performance diagrams, and a description of the brief develop- ment program. 650850 (P-8) Energy and Ther- mal Considerations in Weld Sys- tem Development. A. Koudou- naris and E. A. Silva, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. This paper pro- vides a means of estimating the energy distribution during a resist- ance weld between a round wire and a ribbon. It also shows that energy considerations are not adequate to predict the success of a weld system and that a consideration of the ther- mal nature of the materials involved is required to achieve a satisfactory heat balance. A ratio of physical properties is provided that can be used to predict the compatibility of a wire and ribbon before the extensive process of weld schedule development and qualification is begun. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650851 (P-8) Novel Approach to Microcircuit Interconnection and Packaging. N. I. Cohen, Sperry Gyroscope Co., Div., Sperry Rand Corp. As electronic components and circuits get smaller the problems of mounting and interconnecting ele- ments into a system become more difficult. This paper indicates how one packaging concept using a car- rier-mother board, rack approach, in- terconnected by wire-wrap techniques solves some of the problems imposed by these small components. Flexibil- ity, cost, reliability and their influence on the selection of the final configura- tion are investigated. The applica- tion of hot gas soldering for mounting flat packs to carriers is described along with the advantages gained by its use. 161</page><page sequence="101">650852-650858 162 650852 (P-8) Automated Flat- Pack Welding System. J. R. So- soka, Unitek Corp. The introduction of the flat pack as a circuit element stimulated development of techniques for attaching flat packs to mother boards. The problems inherent to this development program are sum- marized and discussed. Design and operation of a flat pack welding sys- tem is presented. Various approaches to automated flat pack welding are re- viewed, and the advantages and dis- advantages of each are discussed. The final design for an automated flat pack welder is presented with a dis- cussion on the operational functions of the major system components. 650853 (P-8) New Technique in Connector Evaluation. M. E. Peel, Burndy Corp. In todays' tech- nological work, the evaluation of elec- trical connectors for the electronic industry are many times based on an- tiquated specifications and unrealistic performance requirements. A new method of connector evaluation has been developed that is based on the determination of theoretical design, permanent set, cyclic and normal force characteristics which are eval- uated as to their significance as in- dependent entities and their inter- relationships. These data can be supplemented by normal force -con- tact resistance - separation force cor- relations. Proper interpretation of the data can lead to realistic specifica- tions and performance requirements. The data can also be used for the pur- pose of troubleshooting as well as an important guide for further design programs. 650854 (P-8) Reliability Control in Parallel Gap Welding. D. W. Grobecker and J. R. Shackleton, Hughes Aircraft Co. Parallel gap welding is a reliable method for join- ing integrated circuit flat-packs to printed circuit assemblies. Keys to the reliability of the process are the proper selection of materials, the in- herent precision of the equipment, and the amenability of the welds to visual inspection. Welds between gold-plated Kovar leads and gold- plated copper-land, glass-epoxy boards were visually inspected, and then either examined metallographically or tested for mechanical strength. Nor- mal distribution and extreme value statistics were used to evaluate the weld strength data. If proper con- trol is exercised, over 10,000 welded connections must be made to expect one weld with a strength value less than 0.5 pound. 650855 (P-8) Methods for De- sign of High Reliability Welded Electrical Connections. R. R. Tierney, Douglas Aircraft Co., Inc. The reliability of welded electrical connections is being improved: by applying the principle of worst-case design, and taking into account two previously neglected but important factors: encapsulation stresses and quantitative studies. It was believed that encapsulants protected welded electrical connections from stresses; however, studies have shown that there is no inherent limit on the stress to which an encapsulated connection may be subj ected. Quantitative stud- ies to date have not taken into ac- count extreme parameter variations, and further studies are needed to ex- plore and define such parameters. Geometric parameters of welded elec- trical connections are an example of such parameters which should be considered in terms of their extremes. Extensive tests were conducted to de- fine worst-case conditions for one such parameter, namely ribbon posi- tion during welding. 650856 (P-8) Weld Stress Eval- uation-Electronic Modules. H. Dorfman, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. Welded joints of elec- tronic modules are adversely stressed by some encapsulants, especially when subjected to temperature cycling. Weld joints of specific tensile strengths were developed, encapsu- lated with various resins, and tem- perature-cycled to determine failure caused by internal stress. Resins with high coefficients of thermal ex- pansion and high shrinkage values caused weld failures after cure. Stress reduction can be accomplished by proper spacing of weld interconnects. 650857 (P-8) Correlation of Mi- crostructure, Microhardness and Microchemistry in Resistance Welded Electronic Leads. J. E. Breen and P. K. Vahey, Raytheon Co. A study of the nature of the weld in- terface obtained in resistance welding of component leads used in electronic packages showed that : 1. There is little or no diffusion of one material into the other. 2. In welds having a weld nugget in the microstructure there was only a small amount of alloy mixing. 3. There is no significant solid state diffusion. 4. Microhardness in the single phase materials, nickel, Alloy 42, and Kovar, does not vary in any systematic man- ner at or near the weld interface. 5. The materials that were half hard prior to welding show some varia- tions in microhardness indicating partial annealing. 6. Beryllium copper has the hardness of annealed material at the weld in- terface. 7. There is little diffusion and only minor mechanical effects due to re- sistance welding these materials. 650858 (P-8) Evaluation of the Resistance Microwelding Process by Infrared Energy Measure- ments. S. Leonard and J. K. S. Lee, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. Data are presented from an experiment conducted to measure the changes in heat generated at the interface be- tween leads during electronic resist- ance welding as process parameters were varied. The objective was to establish the value of this type of mea- surement for determining mechanical strength of a joint. The experiment consisted of preparation of microweld specimens, infrared detection of the relative heat generated during weld- ing, physical tests of the samples, and statistical analysis of these data. Re- sults indicate that the amount of heat detected at the material interface dur- ing welding may be used for evaluat- ing the quality of the finished weld. Minimum weld strength can be pre- dicted with a confidence of 95 percent. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS</page><page sequence="102">650859-650865 650859 Laboratory Expressions for Motor Fuel Volatility and Their Significance in Terms of Performance. E. R. Morrison, G. D. Ebersole, and H. J. Elder, Phillips Petroleum Co. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of the significance and utility of sev- eral laboratory derived expressions for defining the volatility character- istics of motor fuel as related to hot weather performance problems. This evaluation showed the MRvp, a Reid type vapor pressure measured at a vapor-to-liquid ratio of 25 and at 130 F to be a promising simple, signifi- cant volatility expression having the following advantages:, Good correla- tion with vapor forming character- istics of fuels; superior reproducibil- ity and repeatability; adaptability to conventional blending calculation methods ; convenient means for direct interpretation of road test data and for comparison of fuels of varying composition and characteristics.

Niles, Ford Motor Co. In 1962 and 1964 the Coordinating Research Council evaluated the vapor locking characteristics of about 40 selected new model cars during centralized programs at Yuma, Ariz. Volatility tolerances were determined during ac- celeration following a hot soak at 100 F ambient using two reference fuel series with diverse front-end vol- atilities. Fifty per cent of the 1962 model cars tested had a limiting vapor pressure equal to or less than 8.4 psi with the high volatility fuels and 9.7 psi with the low volatility fuels. Comparable values in the 1964 pro- gram were 8.9 psi for the high and 10.4 psi for the low volatility fuels. Analytical results obtained on vehicle tank samples for the first time during 1964 showed that limiting tempera- ture at a given vapor-to-liquid ratio also was a useful parameter in defin- ing car volatility tolerances.

The rapid expansion of the superhighway systems will re- sult in a much larger percentage of car operation at sustained high speed. Car components associated with per- formance, convenience and comfort have a significant effect on fuel econ- omy during city traffic operation and on the congested highways of the past. On modern superhighways these components have a small effect on fuel economy. Major factor in high speed fuel economy is car size. Discussion: F. McGreevy, Champlin Petroleum Co. ; D. N.

Stahman, Robert A. Taft, Sanitary Engrg. Center, U.S. Public Health Service. These stud- ies cast doubt that fuel system devel- opment alone ever could render au- tomotive vehicle exhaust acceptably free of air pollutants. The road test results show that the measured reduc- tion of hydrocarbon concentration will be greater according to flame ion- ization analysis than according to in- frared analysis, thereby indicating that concentrations of species other than paraffins have been selectively reduced the greater amount. Ulti- mately, the question can probably be answered only on the basis of reac- tivity studies of engine exhaust, but these preliminary results suggest that the gross emission of combustibles other than carbon monoxide is still too high to satisfy future legal re- quirements. 650864 Ignition Systems Can Af- fect Fuel Economy. R. C. Teasel, G. L. Calcamuggio and R. D. Miller, Champion Spark Plug Co. Some of the ignition systems currently being developed for gasoline engines have widely different electrical discharge characteristics. By selecting certain of these systems and by modifying conventional systems, the authors un- dertook an evaluation of the effect of the electrical discharge characteristics of the ignition system on fuel econ- omy in current passenger car engines. It was found that changes in the elec- trical discharge characteristics from the present conventional ignition sys- tem could not improve fuel economy. However, a change in spark plug gap projection was found to be beneficial in the several makes of engines tested. Spark plug temperature recordings of typical vehicles in actual service indicated substantial low power op- eration. Tests based on low power accelerations revealed considerable losses in fuel economy and perform- ance due to malfunctioning of the spark plugs which was undetected by the driver. Discussion: J. R.

Study of the physical properties of oil contaminants and oil filtration show that present methods of filtra- tion have little effect on a lifter wear 163</page><page sequence="103">650866-650933 164 problem. Experiments prove that oil additives can influence the effective- ness of conventional oil filters, which are capable of removing particles con- siderably smaller than their pore size. Lifter wear, therefore, seems to be a function of extended oil drain pe- riods during which contaminants ac- cumulate in the oil and progressive smooth wear occurs. Although pres- ent filters are performing adequately, they could be improved by advances in design and in oil formulation so as to minimize contaminant accumu- lation. Discussion: R. L. Bowers, AC Spark Plug Div., General Motors Corp.; T. C. Sauer, Purolator Products, Inc.; 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650866 Filter Life versus Engine Wear. J. E. McClelland and S. M. Billett, Fram Corp. Filter evaluation methods using radioactive tracers have been developed which are capa- ble of measuring directly and quickly the ability of new and used full flow lubricating oil filters to protect auto- mobile engines from bearing wear. These methods have been used to de- termine that a large increase in wear rate is allowed by several types of commercially available filters when they have been used for relatively few miles on automobiles in typical use. This is in contradiction to in- formation obtained from standardized filter bench tests. The variables which were investigated include en- gine operating practices, dispersancy level of motor oil, amount and par- ticle size of test contaminant, and the effect of open relief valves.

Results of three closely controlled, "Aunt Minnie," passenger-car service field tests are described. The occurrence of rusting in this service and the in- fluences of fuel, lubricant and opera- tional variables are discussed. These results are compared with rusting levels observed in existing laboratory engine rust tests. Discussion: T. F.

Malfunction of pos- itive crankcase ventilation (PCV) devices can cause severe engine cor- rosion during cold-weather operation. Oil breakdown has been found to be the major factor in PCV malfunction. Steps are under way to improve cold- weather oil quality to prevent break- down and to improve engine corro- sion and wear resistance. 650930 Evolution of Short Haul Transport Systems. R. Scherrer and G. Sarames, Lockheed-California Co. The future of high density short haul transport systems seems assured if one considers only the ultimate de- mand for such service. Although the question of ultimate demand has a favorable answer this alone does not assure the origin and growth of short haul service. Considerations pre- sented in the paper indicate that there are at least three basic requirements for the evolution of short haul service and these are 1) a minimum penalty in direct operating cost of 40% rela- tive to fixed wing aircraft 2) VTOL capability so as to allow simultaneous initiation of interairport and inter- heliport operations between cities and 3) system capability to utilize cur- rently unused airspace. These re- quirements are used to select possible first-generation vehicles from those considered in the NASA-Lockheed Short Haul Transport Study and three candidates (with propellers or rotors) are discussed. Basic problems of the vehicles, rather than solutions are emphasized. 650931 (SP-277) Value Engi- neering and Analysis - An Intro- duction to Value Engineering. D. R. Taylor, Army Mobility Com- mand. Value engineering is a proved tool for reducing costs and increasing the value of your products. This has a direct bearing on improved com- petitive position in the market place and increased profit margins. This tool is an organized effort, is oriented to function, involves overall costs, and is interdisciplinary in nature. The paper takes you from selection of items for study, through functional analysis, to implementation of pro- posals. Reasons for high costs and suggestions for avoiding roadblocks to change are discussed because of the importance in understanding the human aspects of reducing costs and improving value. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650932 (SP-277) Value Engineer- ing and Analysis - Function in Value Engineering. A. E. Dillard, Army Mobility Command. This pa- per discusses an approach to better value through the recognition of the interfaces that exist between design parameters, item capabilities, item design, and an item's unit cost, based upon an objective definition of the primary function of an item. 650933 (SP-277) Value Engineer- ing and Analysis - Practical Ap- plication of Creative Thinking. J. W. Moon, Ling-Temco-Vought Aerospace Corp., LTV Michigan Div. The use of purposeful creative think-</page><page sequence="104">650935-650941 ing in business is continuing to grow because it is highly successful in solv- ing problems. Occasionally, how- ever, results are below expectations because either the wrong problem was solved or the ideas were not incorpo- rated. Through early and correct problem recognition and precise prob- lem definition prior to the "creative phase," the first pitfall may be avoided. Successful incorporation of feasible ideas may be assured by con- tinuing use of creativity in analysis, selection, development, implementa- tion, and follow-up of the best ideas. By showing how Value Engineering methodology organizes the use of creativity, this paper emphasizes one of the reasons why VE is widely recog- nized as the best medium for reaping unbelievable rewards of practically oriented, logically applied creativity. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650935 (S406) A Synopsis of Cold Weather Operation Prob- lems of Engine Powered Equip- ment Experienced in the North- ern States and Border Areas of Canada. David L. Raymond, Hupp Corp. Cold weather operations prob- lems of engine powered equipment are discussed. The topics treated include cooling systems and anti- freezes ; fuels and fuel systems ; lubri- cants, greases, gear oils, crankcase and hydraulic oils ; and materials and mechanical and electrical systems. The correct winterizing procedures for each item are detailed, and par- ticular emphasis is placed on main- tenance errors to avoid. 650936 (S407) Review of Some of the Fundamentals of Hydro- carbon Storage Stability. F. G. Schwartz and C. C. Ward, Bartles- ville Petroleum Research Center, U. S. Bureau of Mines. This paper summarizes studies of storage sta- bility of distillate fuels and gasolines. The effect of oxidation on gum solu- bility is shown, as is the effect of fuel type on the composition and properties of gums formed. Typical gum compositions from hydrocar- bon fuels are presented. Fuel com- ponents were labelled with radio- active tracers to measure gum forma- tion in 110F storage. Sulfur com- pounds, nitrogen compounds, and un- saturated hydrocarbons are the most reactive fuel components in gum for- mation. The effect of omitting sin- gle types of compounds from a 17 component synthetic mixture of pure compounds is discussed. A general equation for fuel deterioration is pre- sented. A computer program is used to fit curves to storage data for sim- ple mixtures, gasolines, and distillate fuels. 1966 SAE TRANSACTIONS 650937 (S408) Development of the Model 727 Airplane High Lift System. S. T. Harvey and D. A. Norton, Airplane Div., The Boeing Co. The development of the model 727 airplane high lift system is treated in two parts: aerodynamic^, and structural and mechanical de- sign. Part one explains the high lift requirements and traces flap de- sign evolution from a theoretical view- point. It discusses trailing edge flaps, leading edge devices, flap geometry, and transition flaps, and presents results of the flight test pro- gram. Part two describes design evolution from a mechanical view- point. Flap system configuration and construction are detailed. 650938 (S409) Manufacturer's Product Liability. H. D. Ander- son, Jr., Legal Dept., Chrysler Corp. A review of the past, present, and probable future law governing manu- facturer's liability is presented. The most common theories used in as- serting claims against manufacturers are negligence and breach of war- ranty. In explaining negligence, "things of danger if defective" and the extent of a manufacturer's respon- sibility are defined and illustrated by examples. Breach of warranty, the most common example of liability without fault, is also discussed. 650939 (S410) Practical Use of the Motion Picture as an Engi- neering Tool. R. L. Beard, Sci- entific Laboratory, Ford Motor Co. The major considerations of photo- graphic instrumentation as it applies to the motion picture have been pre- sented and briefly discussed. Spe- cific applications of photographic in- strumentation in the automotive industry, and its role in problem solving are outlined. Often photo- graphic instrumentation is called on as a last resort but it will only pro- vide maximum effectiveness when it is applied as an integral part of the organized research and development program. 650940 (S411) Learning ta Live With Engineers. A. A. Klautsch', General Motors Institute. This pa- per discusses the psychology of en- gineers as a group and presents vari- ous ways to cope with their prob- lems. Because the Engineer is gen- erally an introverted type of person- ality, and because he lives and works in a high state of tension, pressures build up which must be alleviated to allow him to function as a healthy, productive individual. Ten methods to reduce tensions and pressures are offered by the author. 650941 (S412) New Gasoline Ad- ditive Improves Engine Perform- ance and Durability. W. F. Schoen and R. L. Pontious, Sinclair Research, Inc. Nickel isodecylortho- phosphate is a unique and effective multifunctional gasoline additive which has been shown to be a com- bustion chamber deposit modifier, a surfactant, and also improves engine life. This compound reduces ab- normal deposit-induced ignition phe- nomena, equilibrium octane require- ments, and engine wear; prolongs ex- haust valve life ; functions as an effec- tive carburetor deicer and rust in- hibitor ; and modifies combustion chamber deposits without adding to the total amount of deposit accumu- lation. 165</page></plain_text>
