<plain_text><page sequence="1">Japan: Religion. Aston. 3 Sacrifice in Shinto. By the late W. G. Aston. The subject of sacrifice has been dealt with from various points of view by Robertson Smith, Dr. Tylor, Dr. Frazer, Dr. Sanday, and more recently by MM. Hubert and Mauss, whose instructive essay, "Sur la nature et fonction du "sacrifice," was published in the Melanges d'histoire du Religion in 1909. These writers have based their views on evidence drawn from the great Aryan and Semitic religions on the one hand, and from the religious practices of savage races on the other. A study of the old Japanese religion known as Shinto enables us to consider this subject from a fresh and intermediate standpoint. Though not a Primitive religion, if there be such a thing, it bad attained a far less degree of development than the religions of Europe and Western Asia. It is a nebulous polytheism with innumerable deities, few of which have defined functions or distinct personalities. Many are sexless and mythless. Some are at one time single persons, at another dual, triple, or even more. There are not a few traces in Shinto of that earliest FIG. 1. FIG. 2. FIG. 3. [5]</page><page sequence="2">No. 3. MIAN. E1912. stage of religious development in which the nature, power, or object is directly worshipped without the intervention of any antlhropomorphic personage. Thus in the rite called Ji-slidzume, or "eartlh-propitiation," performed to this day wheni a site is choseni for a house, or a plot of grounid brought under cultivation, there is no separate god of the earth. The earth is the god, sexless and mvthless. But a somnewhat more advanced stage of development is commoner, in which the nature power is confounded with an anthroponmorphic deity associated with it. The older Shinto worshipper did not forget that Amaterasu, the Sun-goddess, was in reality the suIn. Fire and the fire-god were to him convertible terms. It may be remarked that Herbert Spencer's well-known tlheory, which will admit of nio other origin of religion than the worship of ghosts, fails altogether to account for facts of this kind. Further instances of the rudimentary character of Shinito are its embryonic morality and the comparative neglect of the aids to religion supplied by the arts of painting, sculpture, architecture, and music. The most solemn and importanit ceremony of S1i1Dto is the Ohonihe or Daijowe (great offering) which was celebrated at the beginninog of every reign. It consti- tuted the religious sanction of the Mikado's rule, anid corresponds to our Coronation. The preparations for this rite were of so suimptuotus a character that in not a few reigns it was omitted for financial reasons. The leading feature of the Daijowe is the Nihiname, or "new-tasting," an annual festival of first-fruits, in whlich the Mikado in person sprinkled rice with sake' which he theni placed before the "Deity. seat," no one else beinng presenit but the Uneme or female couirt officials, who repeated a formula which was intended to rectify aniy irregularities or impurities in the preparation of this offerinig. The Mikado then bowed his head, clapped his lhands (primarily a sign of joy), and said, "6 (Yes, or Amen"), after which he joined the deity in partaking, of the food. The deity in question was no doubt the Sun-goddess. She was represented by a cushion 3 feet broad by 4 feet long. The Mikado's seat was placed to the south of it. There is evidence that in the most anicient times the Nihiname was a general practice not confined to the Sovereign only. The Nihiname is essentially a "grace before meat." As a modern Japanese says: "The Mikado, when the grain became ripe, joined unto him the people in sincere veneration, anid, as iln duty bounid, made retuirn to the gods of Heaven. He thereupon partook of it along with the nation. Thus the people learnt that the grain which they eat is no other thani the seed bestowed on them by the gods " of Heaven." A myth preserved to us in the Nihongi relates that on the death of the Food-goddess there weere produced in her head silkwvorms, in her eyes rice, in ber nose small beans, in her genitals barley, aud in her fundament large beans. These were brought to the Sun-goddess, who was rejoiced and said, "These are " the things which the race of visible men will eat and live." The Nihiname is therefore not traceable to any " reluctance to taste the first-fruits uintil some ceremony "' has been performed whicih makes it safe to do so," such as has been noted by Dr. Frazer in other cases. It is gratitude and not fear -wbich animates Lhe Japanese worshipper. There are no doubt exceptionis, meni of dense and sordid minds who, incapable of spontaneous gratituide, have to be shnamed or friglhtenied into conformity with the practices of their more generous fellows. It is difficult to reconcile the fact tha.t the cardinal rite of Shinto is an expression of gratitude to a beneficenit being with Herbert Spencer's view that all ceremony origiuates fromn fear or with the saying of the Roman poet Statius that "Primus in orbe deos fecit timor." Even the religion of the Roimnans was mainly based on somethinig different from the fear of angry deities. Jupiter was the father of his worshippers and the cult of " Alma Venus, hominuiim divomque voluptas," was [ 6 ]</page><page sequence="3">1912.] MAN. [No. 3. assuredly not prompted by fear alone. Renan in hiis hIistory of Israel agrees with Statius, but Robertson Smith points out that the Semitic deities were the guardians and protectors of their devotees. Schiller calls the worship of the Gods of Greece a " Wounedienst." Shelley, speaking, of the alicient Jews, says "A savage and inhtuman race Howled hideous praises to their demon God" which only shows to what strange extremes atnti-religiouis prejudice m:iy carrY one. Think of the 100th and the 23rd psalms beiDg called "bideous praises"! Perhaps the epithet "devil-worshippers" applied to tribes in other parts of the world may have little better fou1lndation.. Lafcadio Ilearn calls the older Shinto a religioni "of perpetual fear." But this gifted writer knew very little about Slhinto, and was only applying it to Herbert Spencer's statement quoted abovee. He describes Herbert Spencer as "the wisest man iu the world," differing, therein from Thomas Carlyle, who thought him "just a puir creatuire." Gratitude, however, is not the only emotionial basis of Shinto. The worship of the evil Fire-God is prompted by fear. There is aln old ritual in which offerings are made to him to induce him to refrain from transports of rage against the buildings of the Imperial Palace. But he is an inferior deity oni whom his worshippers waste little reverenice. The Japanese evideinee lends no support to Herbert Spencer's assumption that "rites performed at graves, becoming afterwards religious rites performed at altars in temples, were at first acts done for the benefit of the ghost, either as originally conceived, or as ideally expanded into a deity." The old Shinto record does not even mention ghosts. It abhorred everything conniected with the dead. Attendance at a funeral made a man temporarily unclean and unfit to perform Shinto services. The Nihiname lharvest rite is fully explicable as a natural expression of gratitude to a beneficent power and owes nothing to the worship of the dead. It is true that there is frequent mention of food-offerings or other honours to the dead. But it is the deceased man wbo is honoured. There is no expansion of a ghost into a deity. In Japan the deificationi of men, alive or dead, is a secondary phenomenon unkniown to the older cult. Not one of the older deities can be recognised as promotions from the ranks of dead men. They are, in so far as their origin can be traced, nature- powers or the servants or children of nature-powers. Gifts to living men were already familiar to the first worshippers of such deities and are far more likely to have been the prototvpes of religious offerings. Logicallv, of course, the actual gift-a transfer of valuable property for the benefit of the recipient-precedes in order of development the symbolical gift, the object of wvhich may be partly or wholly differeut. Gifts in token of homage or friendship are known to the most utter savages. I may also quote the gift of a ring to a bride, of earth and water in token of political submission, of a gold mohur by an Indian prince to the Viceroy, wbo touches it and gives it back again. When it is remembered that the older Shinto belongs to that stage of religions development in which the nature-power is the god, or at any rate has not been quite forgotten in the anthropomorphic beinog which is associated with it, it will appear highly improbable that the first Japaniese sun-worshipper intended his offerinigs for the actuial physical benefit of the deity. He was not such an idiot as to suppose that the sun in Heaven or the Sutn-oddess profited plhysically by his offering,s of a few grains of rice or a few drops of sake. These were not real gifts but onily symbols of love and gratituide. One of the norito has the expression " things of reverence," i.e., things offered in token of reverence. I ventuire the suggestion that offerings of food to the dead are equally symbolical and are not intended "for the benefit of the " ghost," to use Herbert Spencer's expression. It is true that in the case both of [ 7 ]</page><page sequence="4">No. 3.] MAN. [1912. nature-deities and of deceased men there is abundant evidence-not wanting in Japan- of a secondary and more vulgar current of opinion which holds in some obscure way that au actual consumption of the offered food does take place. This has its source in the minds of those dull-witted people, who, like Nicodemus, are uniable to penietrate the inner meaning of myth, mietapbor, and symbol, and are, therefore, constrained to receive them, if at all, in their literal acceptation. But such men are not the makers of religion. We should be on our guard against the idea that beliefs characteristic of a lower intellectual civilisation are always earlier in point of time than more enlightened faiths. The reverse is frequently the case. Compare the Vedas with the Brabmanas, the religion of the Tao-te-king with the congeries of magical beliefs and practices which constitute modern Taoism, Christianity with medireval witchcraft, or the religion of the gospels with certain modern Chlristian doctrirnes wbich it is needless to specify. The INrihiname is not a "totem-sacrifice." There is no totemism in Japan. But the commensal principle of communion is recognised, as has been seen above. There is another instance in the modern practice of pilgrims to Ise purchasing from the priests, and eating rice that had been offered in sacrifice. Other food offerings were fish, fruit, sea-ear, shell-fish, edible seaweed, salt, venison, wild boar. and birds of various kinds. There is frequent mention of offerings of horses. But they were not killed, only let loose in the precinct of the shrine or kept in a stable for the deity to ride out upon in procession on festival occasions. The god was then represented by his Shintai or material representative. In the older Aryan and Semitic religions, the slaughter of living victims before the altar of the god is universal. The Hebrew term zabah, slaughter, is the commonest word for sacrifice. It is, therefore, noteworthy that in the official Shinto from the seventh century onwards, there is no such slaughter of living animals. One reasoni for this is the comparative absence of domestic animals used for food. The ancient Japanese had no sheep, goats, or pigs. They possessed horses and oxen, but did not use them, ordinarily at least, for food. There is, however, some reason to think that, at an earlier period, the slaughter of animals was not uncommon. The Nihongi says, under the date 642 "The Ministers conversed with one another, saving, ' In accordance " 'with the teachings of the village hafuri there have been, in some places, horses " 'and cattle killed as a sacrifice to the gods of the various (Shinto) shrines without 'any good result."' The object of this sacrifice was to produce rain in time of drought. Now it is highly suggestive that the word hafuri, bere applied to Shinto priests of an inferior class, means " slaughter.' The high priest of one of the oldest shrines in Japan, that of Suwa, was styled the Oko-hafuri, or great slaughterer, and a feast, at which large quantities of venison was consumed, was one of the customary celebrations, the laity who took part in it being supplied by the priests with specially sanctified chopsticks. In the most ancient times there were humnan sacrifices to river-goods. There is evidence of a mock human sacrifice in 1699 to a Shinto god, the victim being apparently a scape-goat, but it may be doubted whether this is a case of survival from a real buman sacrifice. What Robertson Smith calls the "primitive practice" of sprinkling the blood against the altar, common to the Semites with the Greeks and Romans, and in(leed, with the ancient nations generally, is wholly unknown in Japan. Blood has no Dar- ticular v-irtue or sanctity, and is not even mentionled in the old Shinto records. The word "primitive " is, therefore, doubtfullv appropriate in this conniiection. Generally, it has the sanietion of our higllest authorities, but for mty own part, I am disposed to regard it as a damnosa hereditas from the pre-scientific stage of anthropology when the first chapters of Genesis were regarded as the beginning of everything. Next to in importance food offerings comes clothing or the materials for making, [B8]</page><page sequence="5">1912.] MAN. [Nos. 3-4. it. This usually took the form of pieces of cloth, the currency of those early times. The absurdity of ofering clothes for the actual use of the Sun, Wind, or other nature- powers must have been palpable even to those prehistoric Japanese who created Shinto. What attests very clearly the symbolical character of such gifts is the circumstance that leaves of hemp were frequently substituted for hempen garments, and scollops of paper (gohei) for the fabrics manufactured from the same material, namely, the inner bark of the paper mulberry tree. It was, of course, the priests who beuefited by these offerings, except perhaps in the case of purification offerings, which were thrown into a river to be carried down into the sea, where they were received and destroyed by certain deities whose sole function it was to do so. Other offerings were mirrors, weapons, slaves, and utensils of various kinds. The same objects were offered again and again-another proof, if any were needed, of their symbolical character. Most of our information relating to sacrifice in ancient Japan deals with the official form of Shinto. The followino incident, which is related in the Tosa Nikki, a diary of travel written A.D. 935, gives a glimpse of a more popular form of sacrifice. The author, a government official and a famous poet, essayist, and editor, writes in the assumed character of a woman, and was not so superstitious as he pretends to be. "Meanwhile a sudden gale sprung up, and in spite of all our efforts we fell gradually to leeward and were in great danger of being, sent to the bottom. By the advice of the captain nusa were offered, but us the danger only increased the captain again said, 'Because the heart of the god (a Sea-god) is not moved for nusa, neither does the august ship move, offer to him something in which he will take greater pleasure.' In compliance of this advice I bethought me what it would be best to offer. 'Of eyes I have a pair, then let me give the god my mirror of which I have only one.' The mirror was accordingly flung, into the sea, to my very great reg'et, but no sooner had I done so than the sea itself became smooth as a mirror." The nusa mentioned here were no doubt a mixture of paper, leaves of the sacred sakaki tree, and rice, which was carried in a bag by travellers and offered to the gods along their road. Shinto offerings are mainly gifts, but the commensal, bargain, and scape-goat principles are also recognised, although exceptionally. W. G. ASTON.</page></plain_text>
