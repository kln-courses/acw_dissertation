<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION A REINTERPRETATION OF HARRE'S COPERNICAN REVOLUTION* EDWARD MACKINNON California State University, Hayward 1. Introduction. Rom Harre's proposed Copernican Revolution in the philosophy of science is a very ambitious undertaking.' It challenges established views, proposes a radically new model for scientific explanation, and forces a rethinking of the foundations of the field. In his treatment of the natural sciences, Harre rejects all deductivist accounts of scientific explanation (whether these accounts are fashioned by rationalists or empiricists) basically on the grounds that such accounts seriously distort the methods of explanation actually operative in science. In the social sciences Harre, in collaboration with Secord, rejects mechanistic, positivistic, and behavioristic accounts of human behavior [5]. In place of these discarded inter- pretations he substitutes a new realism which stresses the role that models play in supplying accounts of observed patterns of phenomena in terms of the things and processes whose interactions are responsible for the manifest phenomena. This revolution, if successfully carried out, would indeed be a valuable contribution to the philosophy of science. Before evaluating this projected revolution we should summarize some of its more distinctive features. Foremost among these is the stress accorded models rather than deductive systems as the basis for scientific explanation. After distin- guishing models from symbols and iconic from conceptual models, Harre focuses on one class of iconic models, paramorphs, as the most basic model in scientific explanations. A paramorph is an iconic model in which the source of the model is distinct from the subject the model represents, as in the colliding billiard ball model of gases. The central role accorded such models is made unmistakably clear: "I now characterize again the Copernican Revolution in the philosophy of science, in the following ideas: theory construction is primarily model building, in particular imagining paramorphs" ([4], p. 46). The goal of science, as Harre sees it, is to explain phenomena in terms of the real but often hidden mechanisms responsible for their production. Iconic models not only serve to represent such hidden mechanisms; by a switch of attitude towards their status they can also become hypothetical mechanisms which bear hypothetically to their subject matter just exactly the relations that real mechanisms bear to the phenomena for which they are responsible. Such relations may be sorted into two general kinds. Through causal transforms one explains some state of observable phenomena in terms of the states of the mechanism causally responsible for their * Received September, 1973. 1 This is primarily in [4] and [5], building on earlier versions ([1], [2], [3]). A critical evaluation of [4] may be found in [13]. 67</page><page sequence="2">EDWARD MACKINNON production. A clock mechanism explains the regular motions of the hands. Electrons jumping orbits explain observed wave lengths of light. A complex of repressed experiences explains a pattern of hysterical behavior. Modal transforms serve in the existential identification of states of the model with states of the mechanism. Thus reflecting certain wave lengths of light is identified with being of a certain hue, or being a certain type of crystal is identified with being ordinary salt. An analysis of the way such modal transforms function serves as the basis for handling existential hypotheses concerning the reality of the entities and mechanisms represented by the models involved. The second distinctive feature in Harre's account of scientific explanation in the natural sciences is the role he attributes to power ascriptions. This is most simply characterized as the replacement of a Humean view of causality by an Aristotelian philosophy of nature. The entities which science invokes and describes to explain observed behavior are things with natures. A specification of what these natures really are should serve as an ultimate explanatory principle. Real natures, un- fortunately, are not often known, forcing the scientist to rely on nominal natures. But one aspect of natures can often be specified with some precision, the power by virtue of which a thing performs certain activities. Power ascriptions can be expressed in the general form: If C1, C2, C3,.. ., Cn then B in virtue of N. In this formula the C's specify the pertinent conditions, B describes some aspects of behavior and N ascribes a power to a subject. This general idea of an explanation in terms of natures serves as a background for Harre's philosophy of human nature. Thus Harre's stress on the realistic interpre- tation to be accorded models finds its realization in the anthropomorphic model of man summarized by the slogan: "For scientific purposes treat people as if they were human beings." If the basic function of a model is to represent things as they really are then the consciously oversimplified models employed by psychologists must be renounced. However, something of a tension emerges between the general Harre theory of the basic role of iconic models and the special status which Harre and Secord attribute to the anthropomorphic model of man. This is neither an iconic model nor a paramorph. It is not really a model at all in the sense Harre attributes to 'model' in his general account. It is, rather, a reactivation of the Aristotelian idea of explaining man's distinctive activities and properties in terms of his nature and powers. But it is presented in a linguistic rather than an Aristotelian mode. Follow- ing Strawson and Hampshire, the authors sketch a transcendental deduction of what man's nature and powers must be if he is essentially characterized as a language-using animal. Man is like other animals in having a physical body, a power to initiate action and a power to monitor his action. But man goes beyond other animals in his power to monitor his monitoring, a power that is probably identical with the power of speech. It is for these reasons that only human nature can serve as an adequate model for the study of human nature. This central role attributed to the individual as an agent who can monitor his 68</page><page sequence="3">DISCUSSION: A REINTERPRETATION OF HARRIS COPERNICAN REVOLUTION 69 actions through conscious awareness, and also monitor his monitoring through anticipatory comment and subsequent evaluative reports, leads to the conclusion that such first person reports should be accorded a primary role in any explanation of social behavior. The best way to learn why people perform the actions they do is to ask them why they acted and the meaning the actions had for them. No space is accorded to a consideration of the historical reasons that led psychologists in the early decades of this century to abandon the primacy accorded introspective reports in the formative period of experimental psychology. For the mythical man in the street the actions that require explanation are those that depart from the normal or expected. Since these are the actions for which reasons are generally given and meanings sought Harre and Secord explain abnormal behavior episodes by clarifying and describing the manner in which they depart from the paradigmatic episodes accepted as normal. 2. Prospects for the Copernican Revolution. I believe that Harre's general theory of scientific explanation is radically unacceptable in its present form. But I also believe that it makes some valid and potentially viable contributions that might be pre- served through a proper reinterpretation of Harre's fundamental theses. Since the primary purpose of the present paper is to indicate the main lines of such a re- interpretation, the difficulties involved in the original interpretation will be presented in a rather summary fashion under two headings. First we shall consider some objections to the role Harre's attributes to models in scientific explanation and then we shall consider the anthropological model of man. The core of the proposed Copernican Revolution is the idea that theory con- struction is essentially model building, in particular, imagining iconic models to explain hidden mechanisms and processes. Since iconic models are contrasted with sentential models it is easy to equate 'iconic' with 'visualizable' and assume that the basic purpose of such models is to supply imaginative replicas of things. But to do so is to oversimplify Harre's theory of models. As Harre explained it (in a private communication) the word 'iconic' is a deliberate reference to the use by the Greek Orthodox religion of pictures for both representational and conceptual purposes. In science, as in religion, conceptual thinking can be carried on in media other than language. Generally, though not universally, visualizable models supply the only serious alternative to language as a medium for conceptual thinking. Any other representation that might serve as a nonlinguistic medium of conceptual thinking must be perceptible, or at least imaginable. As Harre admits elsewhere,2 this stress on the role of iconic representations as a medium for scientific reasoning is essentially a revised systematization of Michael Faraday's way of doing science. Unfortunately, the primacy accorded iconic models cannot fit quantum physics. Because of difficulties associated with Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle it is impossible in principle to have an accurate iconic model of a fundamental system. Harre's way of getting around this difficulty is to focus 2 "Our conceptual system derives from the conceptual necessities of understanding Faraday's researches into electricity, magnetism, and light" ([3], p. 139). A similar reference may be found in [4], p. 313.</page><page sequence="4">EDWARD MACKINNON on the Bohr model of the atom as an illustrative example of how models function in explanation while dismissing the Copenhagen interpretation (sired by Bohr after he abandoned the Bohr model) as a muddled bundle of blunders.3 Second, Harre's attempt to turn the traditional view upside down, making iconic representations of mechanisms the essence of scientific explanation (while relegating the achievement of a deductive system containing basic principles, derived laws, and final conclusions to the status of nothing more than a desirable heuristic device) does not and, I believe, cannot come to grips with the role deductive structures play in scientific explanations. There are two aspects to this criticism. The first is based upon the role of mathe- matics in physical theory. In Harre's account such applied mathematics is accorded, at best, the supplementary status it had in the older Aristotelian-Scholastic accounts of science. Yet much of modern physics is essentially, rather than accidentally, mathematical. The second unfortunate aspect of his thoroughgoing rejection of deductivism is that it makes it almost impossible for him to incorporate into his system advances made by more traditional philosophers of science. And, in spite of his criticisms, there have been some advances. Third, the explanatory role he attributes to visualizable or constructible models does not seem to accord with the actual development of science where such models have often served only as props to be discarded when more formal theories emerged. As Duhem pointed out long ago, radically different models or pictures of reality can and often have been used to explain the same deductive system. This fact, Duhem argued, indicates that such models are dispensable rather than central to scientific explanation. Fourth, there are serious epistemological difficulties involved in invoking a doctrine of metaphysical realism as ajustification for the success of science. In doing so, Harre claims that he is simply making explicit the intuitions of the working scientist. But, as I have tried to argue in some detail elsewhere ([9], pp. 39-71), the realism implicit in the ordinary practice of science is a practical functional realism which does not settle, and need not even take a stand on, disputed philosophical issues. Fifth, Harre as a philosopher intends to be resolutely a posteriori, banking on the intuitions of practicing scientists rather than on a priori norms supplied by philoso- phers. Yet the unfolding of his own account of scientific explanation dictates what the ultimate structure of reality has to be. It is essentially the sort of field structure that Boscovich and Faraday imagined it to be.4 The deductivists Harre criticizes may try to impose forms on scientific explanations, but very few since Descartes have ever attempted such an a priori imposition of content on physics. The anthropological model of man basic to the Harre-Secord theory of explana- tion in the social sciences presents some special difficulties. Since it draws so heavily 3 The Copenhagen interpretation was not treated in [4], but was discussed in detail in an earlier work ([1], pp. 93-106). 4 Chapter 13 of [4] concludes an analysis of the ultimate level of physical reality with the assertion: "The upshot of the extended argument of this chapter is this: Every fundamental theory must, as expressed in the language of physics, be a field theory" ([4], p. 313). 70</page><page sequence="5">DISCUSSION: A REINTERPRETATION OF HARRE'S COPERNICAN REVOLUTION 71 on the Oxford tradition, especially Strawson's Individuals and Hampshire's Thought and Action, it may simply seem to be a further extension of descriptive metaphysics. Descriptive metaphysics, as Strawson explains it ([14], pp. xiii-xvi), makes explicit the conceptualization of things and persons implicit in the language we must use for intelligible discourse and the thinking such language structures. What the world is certainly conditions what we say of it. A significant change in the way things function should be reflected in language. Yet the descriptive metaphysician's concern focuses on our concepts and the underlying representational system they reflect rather than with the world itself. As Strawson once explained it, in answer to some criticism by phenomenologists, "The analyst's first job, nonetheless, remains that of describing the existing conceptual apparatus, and I do not think that from such an analysis one can get any interesting new information whatsoever about the nature of things" ([17], p. 325). Though Harre uses conceptual analysis and the results of the work done on descriptive metaphysics, his concern is with explaining what the world and its contents really are rather than with making concepts themselves objects of study. Thus he begins [4] by telling us what the world really is: "The world consists of numerous, fairly permanent structures, some compact enough to be called things, which are organized in various ways.... The constitutions of such units are what Locke called 'real essences', and their differentia constitute the natural kinds" ([4], p. 16). Just as the most basic features of the world, that it is a collection of things with distinctive natures, properties, and real relations, is, in Harre's view, known prior to, and independent of, anything science has to say, so too what people really are, as existing beings, is known prior to any theoretical account which psychologists or sociologists may fashion. What man really is is such common knowledge that it is clearly reflected in the language we speak. Therefore the results of descriptive metaphysics and allied conceptual analysis can be quarried to supply the basic building stones for any further theory of man. As the authors state it: The conceptual system embedded in ordinary language should provide the basis for the concepts employed in a realistic psychology, and should serve as a model for other logical connections, and new concepts introduced by psychologists. ([5], p. 10) In the view of Ryle and Strawson, the philosopher is primarily concerned with facts about concepts and only indirectly concerned with facts about objects which may be expressed through these concepts. Harre and Secord are primarily concerned with facts about a class of objects, men, and only indirectly concerned with the concepts themselves. When they summarize the explications of 'person' given by Strawson and Hampshire they do so to get a foundation for their anthropological model of man, rather than to analyze the concept for its own sake. The discoveries of psychology and the knowledge obtained through neurophysiology cannot replace or contradict this common sense image of man. Rather, Harre and Secord argue ([5], Chapter 12), they should serve to clarify the particular powers through which human nature acts.</page><page sequence="6">EDWARD MACKINNON What Harre and Secord are doing here is not really descriptive metaphysics. It is much more akin to a pre-Kantian type of Aristotelianism, a point that Miller has developed [13]. Yet if the dogmatism about objective human natures being known through a real rather than a nominal essence is dropped, what remains is an analytic explication of 'man' proposed as the necessary cornerstone for any scientific theory about man. The fundamental conceptualization of man implicit in ordinary language would on this account become logically immune to replacement or substantial revision. Yet, as Harre himself indicates in discussing modal transforms, openness to such replacement is an essential part of the strategy by which all the sciences advance. This is rather unproblemmatically manifested in the acceptance of a gas as a collection of molecules in motion, of light as electromagnetic vibrations, or of heat as a form of energy. Yet, openness to just such substantive replacement is effectively excluded in the Harre-Secord account of the social sciences because of the grounds of meaning implicit in personal ascriptions, descriptions, references, and reports. Operative here is a latent but functional image of man as a responsible agent acting through the specific powers that characterize his nature. This unwillingness to countenance any substantive replacement by the social sciences of the model of man implicit in ordinary language puts Harre, in particular, in a peculiarly awkward position. He has urged acceptance of his proposed Coperni- can revolution on the grounds that it explains the science of the scientists rather than the logical reconstructions which philosophers, seduced by the ideal of pure deductivism, would substitute for it. Yet the Harre-Secord approach to explanation in the behavioral sciences manifests an unwillingness to accept these sciences as they are. In place of the psychology of the psychologists it would impose an explanatory method derived from Harre's theory of explanation in the physical sciences. Psychologists are generally willing to use models of man different from the type of ordinary language model Harre and Secord explicate. For the purposes of psycho- logical explanation man has been treated as the locus of intervening variables in a stimulus-response process, as an inverse feedback servomechanism, as a binary digital computer coupled to sensor and effector units, as a reward-seeking vector, a stimulation-maximizer, a libido energy-converter, a utilities-maximizing game player, a mutual ego-titillator, and in other ways through the use of other functional models around which research, theorizing, and methodologizing practices cluster. To be sure, few if any practicing scientists give an adequate account of the conceptual and linguistic problems involved in relying on a model of man which is at variance with the model implicit in the language used to make reports and cite evidence. Yet as Sellars has shown [15], an adequate distinction between grounds of meaning and grounds of explanation provides a foundation for the requisite conceptual elucidation. Contemporary psychology surely stands in need of a conceptual clarification that would establish a basic consistency between its underlying presuppositions, its varied methods and the inconsistent and sometimes contradictory requirements used in evaluating success. But this need cannot be met by a priori restrictions limiting psychologists to the prescientific model of man implicit in ordinary language as the ultimate standard to use in judging the accepta- bility of any proposed revisions or replacements. 72</page><page sequence="7">DISCUSSION: A REINTERPRETATION OF HARRI'S COPERNICAN REVOLUTION 73 These objections will not be elaborated any further. The thesis that visualizable models buttressed by metaphysical arguments are central to scientific explanation is not a doctrine that many philosophers of science are likely to take seriously. The real problem here is not one of refuting Harre but one of finding some way of salvaging what is valid and potentially valuable in his treatment of scientific explanation. In spite of the strictures noted I yet believe that his interpretation of scientific explanation has much to offer, that what is valuable in his system can be salvaged by a radical reinterpretation of his central thesis. Such a reinterpretation is the burden of the present paper. 3. Copernican or Anti-Copernican. First, a pedantic point, but one that serves as a convenient introduction to more fundamental issues: what Harre calls "the Copernican Revolution in the philosophy of science" should really be called an "anti-Copernican Revolution." Kant introduced the term 'Copernican Revolution' to indicate a shift from explaining science in terms of how what objects are in themselves determines our knowledge of them to the prior question of how our way of knowing predetermines what objects of knowledge have to be for us. The deductivists, a blanket designation Harre uses to cover such unlikely bed-fellows as logical positivists and Cartesian rationalists, focused on the systems of knowledge, deductive systems, which we develop and then use to make things or events objects of scientific knowledge for us. This method, whether valid or not, is generally in accord with the spirit of Kant's Copernican Revolution. Harre is attempting to reverse this and explain our scientific knowledge in terms of what objects are in themselves, something grasped by imaginative intuition. This should be called an "anti-Copernican Revolution." Kant did more than fix the meaning of the term 'Copernican Revolution'. He developed a theory of knowledge in which the difference between perceptual and conceptual representings plays a fundamental role. Such neo-Kantians as Wilfrid Sellars and Stephan K6rner have shown how this doctrine of conceptual represent- ings can be redeveloped with the interiorization of language as the core of the conceptual order ([15], [7]). By properly utilizing these ideas it is possible to re- develop Harre's account of scientific explanation with conceptual representings playing the role he attributes to iconic models. This, I believe, would retain the contributions his systems offers while obviating the major difficulties it entails. In the remainder of this paper I wish to indicate in a rather schematic way how this might be done. 4. Iconic versus Conceptual Representings. The idea of a conceptual representing is not as familiar or as developed as the idea of an iconic representation or visualizable model. Two interrelated reasons for this imbalance are pertinent to our present problem. First, like the problem of meaning in language, the idea of a conceptual representing is difficult to get at because the practice is impossible to avoid. The language we use reflects and shapes our understanding of the world we live in. Our fundamental categorizations sort the objects of experience into things of different</page><page sequence="8">EDWARD MACKINNON types. Rules of semantic compatibility, few of which are explicit, govern the attribution of properties, powers, and activities to different types of things and processes. Such routine linguistic performances as referring, ascribing, narrating, and describing rely for their effectiveness on the efficacy of language as a tool for representing whatever we wish to discuss. Secondly, an iconic representation is, or can be, a relatively isolated unit. Whether we are considering a model airplane, a blueprint of a building, or Faraday's imaginative interpretation of magnetic fields in terms of lines of force, we can readily focus on the particular representation involved while prescinding from the back- ground. A conceptual representing draws its efficacy from the resources intrinsic to language. Even such a relatively particular representation as a description of the structure and working of some mechanism relies on such other factors as the sortal terms that specify types of things, the hierarchical ordering of categories these terms presuppose, and the meaning of the descriptive terms employed, meanings which generally presuppose a familiarity with paradigm cases. Supplementing these linguistic factors there may be such other factors as iconic models. Granted these and other limitations in our account of representations, we may nevertheless affirm that language as interiorized remains the basis of our ability to form conceptual representations, representations which express what things are, their properties and powers, their activities and interrelations. Such representations are functional rather than iconic. They function, not by picturing objects, but by supplying material rules of inference. Thus one argues, or presupposes, that because X is a Y it has A or does B, when such properties and activities are conceptually entailed by our notion, albeit a changeable one, of what Y's are. (This is developed in [14].) Harre's arguments concerning the role that specifications of natures and ascrip- tions of powers play in scientific argumentation really relies on such conceptual representations rather than on iconic models. Thus his rules invariably concern the interrelation of different classes of sentences rather than iconic models. His stress on the primacy of iconic models seems to come, not from reflection on his own practice, but from the idea that iconic models supply the only real alternative to extensional logic in explaining symbolic vehicles used in scientific reasoning. To indicate the role this plays in scientific explanation we wish to indicate briefly how conceptual representations function in atomic physics, the domain Harre obviously finds embarrassing. Though it is impossible in principle to have an accurate iconic model of an atom, a conceptual or linguistic model has an essential and irreplaceable function in atomic physics. Thus one says, or presupposes, that an atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons in different quantum states, that the number of orbital electrons is a characteristic of the type of atom considered, that the electrons are bound to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces, that transitions of electrons from one state to another involve the emission and absorption of radiation. This general information is supplemented by particular information proper to a special problem. The purpose of supplying such information is not to provide a prop for imaginative intuition but to supply a specification of the 74</page><page sequence="9">DISCUSSION: A REINTERPRETATION OF HARRE'S COPERNICAN REVOLUTION 75 items whose mathematical correlatives enter into the equations specifying the state of the system.5 This conceptual representation has been presented more on the level of popular science than through epistemological analysis, an approach that may seem to trivialize the point at issue. But its significance can be seen by noting two things. First, the attempt to explain what things are, their structures, properties, powers and activities, plays a fundamental role in science. Thus, contemporary astronomers are strenuously attempting to determine: what quasars really are; the processes that lead from supernova explosions to neutron stars and black holes; the mechanisms by which pulsars generate such powerful and regular radio emissions. Even in highly mathematical branches of physics the deployment of a mathematical system depends on the prior specification of the entities, mechanisms, and activities involved. Second, though such representations play an essential role in the actual practice of science, they hardly appear at all in standard philosophical reconstructions of scientific explanation. Here Harre has a strong case against those he refers to as deductivists. Accounts which take covering laws as the model of scientific explanation and extensional logic as the tool do not, and cannot, do justice to this essential feature of real scientific explanations. Scientific explanations do rely on representations of what things are, especially of theoretical entities and hidden mechanisms. Harre's insistence on this is surely correct and surely significant. Granted too that scientists often intermingle both iconic and conceptual representations, the point now at issue is which sort of representation plays an essential role in scientific explanation. In the remainder of this paper I would like to do two things. First I want to show that one can salvage, and even make more intelligible, Harre's account of scientific explanation by attributing an essential role to conceptual representations rather than iconic models. Second, I wish to show that doing this obviates the major shortcomings in his system. To clarify the first point, I wish to reexamine the role accorded models in Harre's account. The type of model to which he attributes a primary role in scientific explanation is a paramorph, a model of a subject whose source or exemplar is in a different class or category form the individual modeled, for example a representation of a gas as a swarm of billiard-ball-like particles. The significance he attaches to such paramorphs is clear: "I now characterize again the Copernican Revolution in the philosophy of science, in the following ideas: theory construction is primarily model building, in particular imagining paramorphs" ([5], p. 46). That iconic representations may play a role in such model building is beyond question. That this role is indispensable in a final account of scientific explanation is highly questionable. Rather than rehearse the long history of this issue I wish to reinterpret Harre's own account. There the prototype of the paramorph is the Bohr Atom. But neither in Bohr's development of the theory nor even in Harre's utiliza- 5 The role that a conceptual representation embedded in a physical language system plays in normal quantum mechanics (as distinct from a formal axiomatic reconstruction) has been treated in detail in [11 ], while the functional role that atomic models played in the development of matrix mechanics has been discussed in [12].</page><page sequence="10">EDWARD MACKINNON tion of this does a visualization of an atom as a miniature solar system play an essential role. Rather, one specifies linguistically, i.e. in a conceptual representing, that electrons move in orbits around the nucleus, and then one uses this conceptual representing as the basis for introducing and interrelating laws derived from classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory. In setting up such a paramorph, iconic representations may play a psychological role but it is conceptual representations that play an essential role. The utilization of paramorphs in scientific explanation is almost exclusively a question of conceptual or sentential models. Thus Harre explains different ways, not covered by de- ductivism, in which model-dependent accounts of what things are play a role in scientific explanation. There are existential hypotheses about the reality of postulated theoretical entities or processes; causal transforms explaining, for example, observed phenomena in terms of changes of state in the entities represented by a model; modal transforms, identifying such phenomenal properties as having a certain hue with such properties of postulated theoretical entities as having a certain wave-length; and there are other more complex usages.6 In each case Harre's analysis actually hinges, not on iconic models, but on how certain classes of sentences function: existential statements about theoretical entities; general descriptive statements about their powers or properties; conditional and bi- conditional statements linking the framework in which these theoretical entities are discussed to the framework in which the observed phenomena are described. Thus, even in this, Harre's own analysis, iconic models fade in significance while con- ceptual models, functioning through the sentences employed, play an essential role. This general confusion about the nature of models assumes some peculiar complications in the Harre-Secord account of the humanistic sciences. What they are explicating in their anthropomorphic model of man is a conceptualization implicit in ordinary language, not an iconic model. Yet from Harre's general account of the role of models in explanation they draw the conclusion that the only model that can play a truly effective role in psychological explanation is a realistic model of man's nature. As Harre and Secord insist, the behavioral scientist should accept man for what he really is. But this antecedent willingness does not imply that the scientist, and a fortiori the common sense realist, already has an adequate under- standing of what man is. The conceptualization of man implicit in the language used to make psychological reports is neither a substitute for, nor a contender against, the models of man developed by personality theorists and other psychologists. The underlying reasons for the distortions and confusions noted is that Harre, like many other philosophers, does not have a developed doctrine of what conceptual representations are. Accordingly, he tends to attribute any role that representations play in scientific explanation to iconic models. Conceptual representings enter as framework presuppositions for statements which, to be scientific, should be true. From this premise there is an easy inference to the conclusion that conceptual representations can fulfill their task only if they are both true representations of what things really are and also the functional basis for the statements we use to 6 Harre treats the ontological status of theoretical entities in [4], Chapters 2 and 3. I have given a radically different interpretation of the same problem in [10]. 76</page><page sequence="11">DISCUSSION: A REINTERPRETATION OF HARRI'S COPERNICAN REVOLUTION 77 refer to and describe the things in question. For other philosophers the failure to make a proper distinction between iconic and conceptual representings or to explain their diverse roles in scientific explanation may have no serious adverse effects. In Harre's account, which accords models a primary role in scientific explanation, confusion on these points has some very bad effects. It is, I believe, responsible for the fundamental shortcomings of the system. Unless these can be cleared up his proposed revolution will, I fear, remain unsuccessful and unaccept- able. Accordingly, I would like to indicate, albeit in a sketchy way, how a redevelop- ment of his system with conceptual rather than iconic models playing a basic role would obviate the shortcomings previously noted. First, there is the fact that quantum theory does not and cannot fit into Harre's account. If one accepts his norms of scientific explanation, according a primacy to visualizable models, then quantum theory must be considered radically incomplete and the Copenhagen interpretation a hopeless muddle. While the Copenhagen interpretation may have inherent difficulties, its abandonment of visualizable models should be considered an essential advance rather than a shortcoming. Second, his stress on iconic models leads to epistemological and ontological difficulties which are so interrelated that they are best treated in tandem. To make intelligible the idea that our knowledge of theoretical entities and processes is based on iconic models it is necessary to attribute to imaginative intuition an essential role in understanding. This entails some serious epistemological difficulties. Iconic models have a sort of one-to-one relation to the things they represent. If the models are like the things in the appropriate respects then they work; if they are dissimilar then they do not work. To explain the fact that many scientific theories obviously work well, Harre has a kind of immediate realism, a one-to-one correspondence between our ideas and what things are in themselves. This, in turn, leads to a re- introduction of Locke's distinction between real and nominal essence. The real essence of a thing is what it is in itself, a structured composition to be grapsed by imaginative intuition. Its nominal essence is what some relatively superficial theory or descriptive framework says it is. A realization that what are at issue here are conceptual representations modifies some of these points. While the world somehow determines the ideas we have of it, it rather underdetermines them. Our conceptual representations are mediated by a linguistic community and an ongoing culture. Hence there is no simple one-to-one correspondence or causal relationship between what things are in themselves and our ideas of them. While attributing explanatory primacy to imaginative intuition logically seems to entail some sort of private meaning doctrine, the same cannot be said of conceptual representations. These are explicitly language dependent and essentially public. The Locke-Harre distinction between real and nominal essences does not play a role in the revision I am suggesting. Any talk of essences has meaning only in terms of what some theory or conceptual framework says things are. The accept- ability of such a conceptual representation is not a simple matter of whether it really corresponds to the thing in question. The question of acceptability is a</page><page sequence="12">EDWARD MACKINNON complex issue involving a choice of competing frameworks and an analysis of the functional role a representation plays in a particular case.7 Within this more or less neo-Kantian approach I am suggesting that the only way one could speak of how things are in themselves, as distinct from how our theories represent them, is through some sort of transcendental reduction. Whatever status or validity such a reduction may have, it is certainly not a part of science or the usual philosophy of science. Next there is Harre's a priorism, dictating what ultimate reality must be. This follows, not from science, but from his reliance on visualizable models. If iconic models are the basis of scientific understanding, then intelligibility is inevitably linked to intuitiveness. What cannot be imaginatively represented cannot be real. Ultimate physical reality must have some sort of spatial and temporal continuity. The arguments that support this are essentially those that have long been employed to reject action at a distance as unintelligible. If some sort of spatial and temporal continuity must be attributed to whatever physical reality is ultimate then the only candidate that seems to meet this requirement is some sort of extended field. Fields, accordingly, rather than particles, must be the ultimate layer of reality. However, dissolving this reliance on imaginative representations exempts us from any requirement to accept spatial and temporal continuity as a criterion of intelligibility. With these requirements gone, we can look to the progress of scientists, rather than the speculations of philosophers, to determine the ultimate structure of matter. Finally, there is the anthropological model of man. Here again Harre and Secord have made a potentially valuable contribution in making explicit the model of man that is implicit in the language psychologists necessarily use to report and describe behavior. Yet here, too, the doctrinaire realism guiding the in- terpretation of models leads to an imposition of the substantive conclusions psychologists must reach and retain. A proper understanding of the functional nature of such conceptualizations obviates the grounds for such a priori impo- sitions. 7 The role of conceptual frameworks in judging the truth and acceptibility of scientific state- ments is treated in [8], Chapter 3.
