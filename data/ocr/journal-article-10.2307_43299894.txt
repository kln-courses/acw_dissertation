<plain_text><page sequence="1">Compositional Structure in Tibetan Iconography K.M. Gerasimova Translated from the Russian by Stanley Frye* Man is the measure of all things, of those which exist that they exist, and of those which exist not that they exist not. -Protagoras Hegel believed that the primary characteristics of Indian art as related to a stage of symbolic form, were excess, the fantastic and allegorism, whereas the art of Ancient Greece, being a classical form, expressed itself chiefly by means of a category of measure. This opinion is erroneous. Indian art, no less than the art of Ancient Greece, was based on a doctrine of measure. Moreover, both arts are related by a common simila- rity of aesthetic categories of measure, harmony, symmetry and anthropo- logical and cosmological understanding. This similarity does not, of course, necessarily imply borrowings. In order to explain what it does signify, it is essential to study the monuments of the Indian theory of art. During the past few years, Soviet literature on the theory of aesthetic categories has manifested some interest in art canons and systems of propor- tions.1 A.F. Losev's interesting work, Art Canons as Problems of Style , analyses the ancient canons- Greek and Egyptian, the medieval canons - Byzantine and Gothic, the canons of the Renaissance, the canons of Cennino Cennini, Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci and Durer, but says nothing at all about the Indian - Hindu and Buddhist canons- in spite of the fact that the Hindu canon has been described in detail in the works of Gopinath Rao, Jitendra Nath Banerjee and T. Bhattacharya.2 The Indian canons are worthy of the most intensive study and not solely for reasons having to do with the cultural history oï the peoples of Asia. This lacuna in Soviet literature is beginning to be remedied: the first of the seven-volume series of documents, Masters of Art On Art , is dedica- ted to the aesthetic thought of India, China, Japan, the Near and Middle- East, Byzantium and Medieval Europe up to the 14th century.3 India is represented by translations of the Tibetan version of an anci- ent Indian treatise, the Citralaksana, or "Characteristics of Pictorial Art", and Sanskrit texts from the Silpa sastras, treatises on graphic art and crafts of the 5th-16th centuries which have been published by Gopinath Rao. •From Trudy buryatskogy institūta obshchestvennykh nauk , BF SO AN SSSR, 1968, I, pp. 88-96.</page><page sequence="2">40 THE TIBET JOURNAL Clearly, none of this is sufficient to give the complete characteristics of the Indian theory of art. The study of the Tibetan Buddhist texts can greatly increase our knowledge of the Indian monuments on art theory, but the Citralaksana , at least in the form in which it appears in the series Masters of Art on Art , cannot be called a monument of systematic or exact formulae of iconometry because the latter had not yet been crystallised over the ages, or else a critical collation of the text must be made. Tibetan iconographical treatises are important in two respects. In studying the materials in these texts, we may assume that they provide us with a picture of further crystallisation of the theory of art in India itself, or that they give us an idea of the direction in which Indian theory was supplemented, changed and developed in Tibet, Am-do (A-mdo) and China. The present article is devoted to a review of three 18th century treatises on iconometry and composition. Tibetan iconographie treatises of the 1 8th century by two authors: Sumpa kan-po ye-shi pal-jor (Sum-pa mkhan-po ye-ses dpal-byor) (1704- 1788, Amdo), and A-kya-ku lo-zang tan-pai gyal-tsan pal-zang-po ( A-kya - sku blo-bzang bstan-pďi rgyal-mtsan dpal-bzang-po) (of Yung-ho-kun, a monastery of the Tibetan tradition in Peking), give an ordered system of Tibetan iconography and diagrams for the composition of the divinities.4 These are, in all probability, the results of many centuries of appropriation and adaptation of the classical Indian theory of art. Information on the Indian iconographie treatises which were translated into Tibetan has been given by Csoma de Koros, George Hu th, Isaak Jakob Schmidt, Bohtlingk, Berthold Laufer, Stella Kramrish and Giuseppe Tucci.5 Laufer published the Tibetan translation of the Citralaksana . Stella Kramrish published the Sanskrit text and translation of the Citrasutra , the third section of the Visnudharmottara. P. Bose published the Sanskrit text, the Pratimamanalaksana , a treatise on iconometry and diagrams for portray- ing the divinities attributed to Atreya and translated into Tibetan by Dharmatara, and the G rags-pa rGya-mtsan . Tucci, in his basic work, Tibetan Painted Scrolls , gives a general description of the Indian and Tibetan iconographie monuments and some of the principles of Buddhist iconometry.6 Tucci's position is characterised by a certain degree of doubt as to the possibility of any original artistic thought on the part of the Tibetan writers, in view of the fact that religious art cannot be an individual creation but must be a reproduction of established paradigms which are described by the canon. In the religious art of Tibet, everything was predetermined by the Indian tradition which was maintained without substantial changes inas- much as it had to do with the sacred canon of iconography and sculpture. Tucci himself dislikes these inflexible limitations and attempts to somehow</page><page sequence="3">COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE IN TIBETAN ICONOGRAPHY 41 expand them when he discovers that the Tibetan material does not fit, and sees that the departure from the Indian sacred tradition requires another key for its solution. The discrepancies between the iconometry of Pratimalaksana and the Tibetan iconographie treatises of a later period force the consideration that the history of the development of Tibetan artistic thought cannot be covered solely by Indian documentation. This problem can be solved only by a cautious comparative study of the Indian and Tibetan monuments and the appearance of later materials. In closing his review of the Tibetan iconographie treatises, Tucci says that it is not essential to go into the details of this Buddhist iconometry because it adds nothing new to the systems adopted by the Indian artists, systems which are now well-known thanks to the research of Gopinath Rao. A simple comparison of the various iconometric data given by Tucci, on &lt; the basis of his study of those Indian and Tibetan monuments which he had at his disposal, with the detailed and systematised tables, may be compiled from the materials in the treatises of Sum-pa kan-po and Lo-zang tan-pai gyal-tsan (which Tucci did not study), 6a providing a basis for a more optimis- tic conclusion. Firstly, we find a more complete system of iconometry and secondly, a movement of thought is sensed where, so it would seem, there should be none. Sum-pa kan-po and Lo-zang tan-pai gyal-tsan were not in accord with the traditional viewpoint concerning the origin of the Buddhist icono- graphie canon. Yet the latter did originate in India, but the Pratimamanalak- sana, the Atreyatilaka and the Dasatala (considered to be a revelation of the Buddha taken down by the disciple Sariputra) did not lay the founda- tion for the Buddhist canon. This was done in the Indian tantric system of the Kalacakra and in the Heruka Tantra which were supplemented in Tibet during both the early and later periods of the propagation of the Teaching (i.e. both before and after Lang dar-ma, gLang dar -ma; but before Tzong- k'a-pa, Tzong-kha-pa) with various commentaries compiled on the basis of the tantric treatises. Lo-zang tan-pai gyal-tsan is more critical than Sum-pa Kan-po and states that, in spite of the many references to these works (prior to Tzong- k'a-pa), he has doubts concerning them (their authenticity?) and therefore does not cite their titles. He considers the primary source for his two treatises to be a work attributed to Tzong-k'a-pa: The Mirror of Sym- metry and The Jewel of the Source of Line by the famous Tibetan artist Lho-dr'ag man-t'ang gi ka-pa man-la don-dr'ub ( Lho-brag sman-thang gi mkhas-pa sman-bla don grub) (the scholar Man-la Don-drub from Lho-dr'ag Man-tan, a province in Southern Tibet which borders Bhutan). From these brief remarks concerning the origin of the canon, it is obvious that the</page><page sequence="4">42 THE TIBET JOURNAL author feels no blind devotion to tradition or to the names of Atreya or Sariputra, although the Buddha Himself stands behind the latter. He affirms the priority of the tantric sources but does not attribute special significance to the iconographie commentaries which were compiled on the basis of those tantric sources and which were closely connected with the later Indian tradi- tion. The author prefers the works accepted by the church of Tzong-k'a-pa and unambiguously declares the purpose of his work to be cooperation in interdicting all incorrect methods and establishing uniform rules j&gt;f icono- graphy. It would be valuable to become acquainted with additional Tibetan monuments in order to establish which was nearer to the Indian original source: the "correct", uniform method, or the "incorrect" method; relation- ship between "Indian" theory and local practice; and the contribution of the Tibetans to Buddhist art and the overall civilization of Central Asia. Our position is as follows: the Buddhist icon should be considered as a nationally created monument of the Tibetans, Mongols, or Buryats, one which reflects a certain historical measure of the understanding of the beautiful and which tells especially of man and his relation to the world which surrounds him. In the given instance, religion is not an obstacle to the expression of the human because it itself is the product of human cons- ciousness and represents a specific stage of knowledge of the objective laws of nature and society. Tucci says that iconometry is the grammar of drawing, the science of mathematical proportions which imparts harmony to an image, but that this iconometry has a liturgical purpose: it serves ritual sacred acts and has nothing in common with the canons of classic antiquity. It does not reproduce a type of ideal beauty because the human has no meaning for this type of art which is totally transcendental and magical.7 It is quite true that the divine was considered sacred and beautiful, but the beautiful was created in the material of earthly images which were puri- fied and elevated to inconceivable heights. The concept of the sancity, wisdom and beauty of the gods was formed in accordance with the spiritual ideals of the times. The images of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas portray to us the qualities of the perfect man who is endowed with the might of know- ledge and ability and beauty of body and soul. The portrayal of the physical aspect of a divinity also mirrored the measure of man's knowledge of himself. The aesthetics of Antiquity found in -man the ideal canon of the beautiful: man measures all by himself, or all which is commeasurable with him. "The harmonically measured human body was seen by the Greeks as the universal measure of all aspects of art; not only of sculpture, but also of poetry."8</page><page sequence="5">COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE IN TIBETAN ICONOGRAPHY 43 Anthropometry, the study of the proportions of the human body was also the basis for Indian iconometry. It was not due to mere chance that iconometry was intimately connected with medicine and metric terminology with the "measure of man". The measure of man: face, palms, fingers, were the units of measurement in Indian iconometry. Face and palm are called the "great measures" and consist of 12 or 12.5 "small measures" or "fingers". The measure of man as a measure of geometric harmony in architec- ture is to be traced equally to Egypt, the world of Antiquity, Russia and India.9 The artistic thought of the peoples of the different countries of the world was created on a single gnosiological basis. This explains basic similarities in spite of the totally autochthonous originality of phenomena. The Indian canon of proportions has a great deal in common with that of the world of Antiquity, not only because it is constructed on the harmonic human type, but also because both were created during the "Golden Age" of the cultures of Greece and India which were characterised by the high level of humanism of that period. In the art of the "Golden Age" the gods were as beautiful as men and men as beautiful as the gods. This harmony of spirit is its historical explanation. In the Indian canon of proportions the ideal body-structure is given as "Dasatala" or ten great measures. If we convert the ten-fold Indian scale to the unit of measurement of Antiquity (length or head), we see that the Indian norm for the ideal body structure, as in the canon of Antiquity, assumes a length of body which is seven and a half or eight times that of the head. If we may assume that Vitruvius hands down the Greek canon of Polikletus or Lisippus, we find additional analogies in his statement: "Indeed, nature has so constructed the human body that the face, from the chin to the upper line of the fore- head and the beginning of the hair roots, comprises a tenth part of the body as does the extended wrist from the carpus to the middle finger."10 The Indian canon of proportions, however, does not limit itself to the quantita- tive characteristics of the ideal human form; it also gives several systems of proportions which occasionally diverge greatly from the ideal of beauty. The Tibetan iconographical treatises divide the Buddhist pantheon into seven categories according to which the overall length of the body of a portrayed divinity varies from 12, 10, 8, 6, to 5 large measures: (1) The Buddhas: Length of body ten large measures or a ten-fold scale; unit of measurement a large measure of 12.5 fingers. (2) Yi-dams and rishis of a wrathful aspect: twelve-fold scale which is reduced to a ten-fold one; two measures: 12.5 fingers for the body and twelve fingers for the pedestal and ushnisha. (3) Bodhisattvas: tenfold scale; according to Lo-zang tan-pai gyal-tsan's treatise, ten large measures of twelve fingers. (4) Taras, dakinis, guardians of the directions of peaceful aspect: nine-fold scale; unit of</page><page sequence="6">44 THE TIBET JOURNAL measurement - large measure of twelve fingers. (5) Wrathful divinities, yakshas, divinities of the plants of wrathful aspect: eight-fold scale, large measure of twelve fingers. (6) Minor local divinities: Six to five-fold scale with large measure of twelve finghrs.11 (7) Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, ordinary people: measure: the elbow; 3.5 in height, 4 in breadth. Speaking of the latter category, Sum-pa kan-po and Lo-zang tari- pai gyal-tsan refer all those interested to the above-mentioned categories of the divinities inasmuch as these proportions were compiled on the basis of the measurement of the human body. The first four categories, or the 12-, 10- and 9-fold scales give a system of proportions according to the general principal of the "square of the Ancients". This means that the overall length óf the body equals the span of the arms and that the length of the upper half of the body is equal to the lower. According to the 8- and 6-fold scales the length of the body equals the span of the arms, but the lower half of the body is shorter than the upper. The standard points of measurement of the body are the basis for all these systems of propor- tions or scales types. In all the scales, the face and torso are constant magnitudes and variability is created by height of the skull, length of the neck, femur, knee, shin and foot. The bases of the canon of proportions are real anthropometric obser- vations which have been reduced to a simple mathematical system free of superfluous information on individual deviations and discrepancies. Here, it is esssential to point out that in the iconographie metrics one must not expect to find standard units of measurement such as our centimetres, decimetres, or metres. Face, elbow and finger are relative measurements. What is of importance is the relationship between the units of measure- ment, as it is this which remains constant. The combination of the rela- tive with the constant' and of the concrete with the abstract shows the ability to regulate the particulars, thereby creating a regularity of the whole and this is a type of modelling. The iconographie canon shows a high degree of generalisation of anthropomorphic data, both at a level of actual regularities and a level of the specific problems of protrayal, i.e. a conscious distortion whereby beauty is the more highly idealised because it pertains to the category of the higher divinities, and defects are concentrated because the plebeian, stumpy, fleshy body-structure is relegated to the lower categories of the pantheon. The canon of proportions was so compiled that the iconographer required no numbered handbook ; it sufficed him to remember the general principle of relationship of the units of standard body measurement, in order to calculate, without special difficulty, the proportions of any port- rayed figure of any magnitude. Whereas the canon of proportions gives us</page><page sequence="7">COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE IN TIBETAN ICONOGRAPHY 45 the static formulae of anthropometry, the draft diagrams show us the dynamic proportions of the body in motion. The technical basis of the diagram is a grid of vertical and horizontal lines. The vertical lines are read off to the right and left on a vertical centre. The horizontal lines are drawn at points of standard measurements of the body, but in dynamic variation, i.e. with correction for raccours. There are two basic purposes for the draft diagrams. The first is to pro- vide a concept of raccours, of a system of dynamic proportions, i.e., an optical variation of static proportions of the body in motion. The second is to create a scheme of movement on the basis of the law of equilibrium of the parts of the body in relation to the line of the centre of gravity. The compositional structure of the figure is thus a formula of stability, of equili- brium of the body in motion. The line of the centre of gravity is the vertical. Of the nine draft diagrams of Sum-pa kan-po, two of these give the frontal structure of the standing or seated figures in which the centre verti- cal separates the figure into two identical halves. We also have three dia- grams of purely anatomical contrapposto (a model for the composition of the figure of Vajravarahi), and four which are conventional (a model for the composition of the figure of the wrathful Vajrapani). The compositional principle for the figure of Vajrapani we term conventional contrapposto because in this diagram which is contrapposto in movement, the rules of the proper shift of the centre of gravity, the shoulders and femoral axes, have been ignored. In these draft diagrams and the finished portrayals, there is a com- positional secondary problem which proceeds from the religious content of the specific figures of Buddhist iconography. The artist perfectly understood the means he would employ to obtain the requisite visual impression. The concept of the immobile peace of Nirvana is expressed by the closed har- mony of a triangular form drawn inside the circle of an aura. Portrayal of the ecstatic wrath of the active divinities, protectors of the Doctrine and punishers of evil is made on the dominant of the "difficult" diagonal from the lower right to the upper left. The figure of a dancing demonic goddess of the Vajravarahi type is composed on the basis of a zig-zag with pre- dominance of the "difficult" diagonal. The harmonic unity of activity and rest of the Bodhisattvas is realised by a contrapposto construction with dominance of the "easy" diagonal from left to right. Figures constructed according to the described canon of proportions and the compositional diagrams are outstanding in their expressiveness and perfection of plastic form. The 10-and 9-fold scales almost approach the figures in the Ajanta frescoes, i.e. the realistic plastics of the perfect human form.</page><page sequence="8">46 THE TIBET JOURNAL It is impossible not to observe how, in the history of Buddhist art, the sensual spontaneity of the Indian forms is gradually attenuated, giving way to the medieval mystical conventionality of form. But the Teaching itself had also changed and the content of the Buddha image was transform- ed from the concrete-human of the "Hinayana" to one which was transcen- dental in the "Mahayana". The "Vajrayana" created a vast mystic pan- theon which was removed from the common man by a barrier of exoteric ritual and the caste of servers of a religious cult. The portrayal of the divinities became ever more abstract, dry and lifeless, which has the result of ideological conventionality. The basis of Buddhist iconography was the abstract dogma which denied the independ- ent value of real earthly existence. Earthly life was valued as a favourable condition for final deliverance from it. Only the ideal existence of the gods, characterised by the immutability of peace was considered real. The Buddhist goal of salvation and moral perfection amounted to an overcom- ing of the mental and spiritual disturbance which resulted from the incon- stancy of the world which was the cause of man's suffering. It was these ideas which brought about the limiting ideal staticity of the images of Tibetan iconography in spite of all their phantastic brilliance and ecstatic intensity. Movement became extinguished, locked in a circle or square, or totally equilibrated by the repetition of linear directions. The aspiration for maximum perfection and extreme rigidity agreed with the philosophical mood of Buddhist art and, to a great extent, contributed to its future necrosis. Conventionality of content and dogmatisation of professional methods, even at the highest level, could not do other than lead to degene- ration in the workmanship of art and to a loss of the positive which was part of the canon of the Ancients, i.e. the realistic fundamental principles of real knowledge of the human body and single-minded application of graphic means. In Tibet, Mongolia and the Buryat, we see on one hand, that over a period of many centuries all iconographie images were constructed accord- ing to a single principle while, on the other, and just as characteristically they show a distortion of the classic norm, an illiterate imitation of the canonical principles and even a complete misconception as to the purpose of imagery, along with a disintegration of unity of form and content. Especially evident is the conventional decoration which occasionally reaches such extremes that it eclipses the very reason for the theological idea of portrayal. The loss of sensual spontaneity is counterbalanced by extreme decoration and naive narration. The concept of Buddhist salvation is tinted with all the hues of folkloric dreams of fabulous bliss. The emotional makeup of Tibetan iconography is as contradictory as the religion itself. The transcendental mysticism of the Teaching should</page><page sequence="9">COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE IN TIBETAN ICONOGRAPHY 47 not be overemphasised as it contains many unsophisticated earthly motives which meet the daily needs of the rank and file of believers, without the support of which no religion can hope for a long existence.12 Tibetan iconography may be conditionally classified into two groups : representa- tional and biographical icons. The representational icons are a special type of formal portrait of a single divinity or an entire hierarchical group of a specific cult. In its portrayals of the divinities, Tibetan art had no great perspectives in the sense of discovering human values because its pur- pose was not artistic knowledge of the world, although at its acme, it actually did create in the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas an ideal image of the beautiful man, possibly unconsciously. The iconographie treatises have to do with the regulation of this group of religious images. The construction of individual figures and decorative-ornamental combinations on a flat surface actually exhausted the entire problem of the organisation of space in the representational icon. Its compositional formula consisted in the quantitative establishment of the centre and a symmetrical grouping of the secondary comporients according to a principle of simple transfer. The treatises on iconometry bear witness to the realistic power of creative thought of the iconographers and to their understanding of the general laws of artistic perception. The iconographer, in spite of the depth of his religiosity and his devotion to sacred things, was guided not by in- tuition and mystic vision, but by an exact knowledge of the technical means to create the required artistic impression. The biographical icons of Tibetan iconography also originated in India. Along with the appearance in Buddhism of religious imagery there appeared an entire stream of biographical subjects. In the bas-reliefs of Bharhut, Sanchi, Amaravati and the frescoes of Ajanta, Kuchi, Kashgar and Tun-huang, we find many narrational subjects which testify to the people's worldly understanding of religious ideals. Tibetan icons which are devoted to the lives of the Indian siddhas or the Tibetan "fathers of the Church" may serve as sources for illustrative materials on the historical ethnography of the peoples of India and Tibet, but the importance of the biographical icons is not limited to motives of religious awareness of the world or folk- loric illustration; they are also interesting as documents of the further development of the artistic thought of the peoples of Asia. Buryat iconographers say that there were no canonical rules för bio- graphichal icons. A biographical theme was composed freely and in accord with the subject and the existing artistic traditions of one or several schools of iconography. For this reason there were many variations of artistic solu- tion for biographical themes. The line of the biographical icon is progres- sive. Of greatest importance is not the construction af the individual figures,</page><page sequence="10">48 THE TIBET JOURNAL but their relationship in the composition; not the scholastic summa of units of portrayal, but a more complex semantic organisation of space, an effective relationship of the components which is, of course, conventional, but which portrays the world of men rather than the world of the gods. In the artistic thought of the "Buddhist" peoples, biographical themes created an escape from the cul-de-sac of the conventional dogma of the canon and prepared a professional basis for the development of secular art. Several examples of compositional solutions to the biographical theme may be adduced (see below). Possibly these represent specific stages in the development of the artistic thought of these peoples: (1) Plane solution: the representative frontal figure of a divinity or saint is supplemented with a conventional frontal portrayal of one or two episodes which pertain to the subject. (2) Plane solution: two-dimensional space is organised along the grid of verticals and horizontals, the centre-vertical being isolated. The episodes pertaining to the subject are displayed along these horizontals and are usually group portraits of the main subject and the donors.13 (3) Plane solution: the representational portrayal of the central divinity is bordered by a square, the boundaries of which are the horizontal rows of episodes pertaining to the subject. These are separated from each other by a band of sky. The episodes are portrayed frontally, conventionally, in two dimen- sions.14 (4) Plane solution: the representational frontal image of the main subject is not limited by the background of the biographical episodes which are grouped freely. Here, the episode is not treated as a portrait of the main subject, but rather as an action or event which takes place in three-dimen- sional space and develops in time. The entire icon is a stream of events which are not connected by a unity of time, location, or action. This gives a picture of life from an exhalted, non-realistic point of view, naive in many respects, but exciting in its attempt to portray quantitively the phenomena of the surrounding world.15 (5) An embryo of qualitative comprehension of the events of life may be seen in instances where the episode is isolated from the subject-stream and is composed on a large scale in three-dimen- sional space in which a particular moment is intended to provide the idea of a whole, both in concept and mood. The episode tends toward a trans- formation into an independent picture, characteristic of which is the expression of a whole by means of a part.16 This is the moment of the emergence of the category of the typical. The biographical icon also shows the process of the discovery of three- dimensional space. The problem of portraying space is connected with the theory of perspective. In the biographical icons, space is portrayed by constructing an image along a diagonal which disappears into the depth of the surface. There is no inflexible rule as to where these diagonals go or where they converge - beyond [ the picture, or in front of it. Most fre- quently, however, the iconographer attempts to fill in the entire surface,</page><page sequence="11">COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE IN TIBETAN ICONOGRAPHY 49 assembling the framework along both verticals and horizontals, even when the central part is constructed on a diagonal within the framework of the horizon alone and makes no provision for a bird's-eye view. The biographical Tibetan icon provides materials for the study of the process of cultural exchange in the countries of Asia, and for acquiring knowledge of the local revision of spiritual riches and the historical discove- ries of a specific civilisation. It is quite obvious that the Indian theory of the compositional structure of the human form and the construction of three-dimensional space of Chinese landscapes played a role in the history of the art of Tibet, Mongolia and the Buryat, but it by no means supplan- ted the national creativity of these peoples. The concrete materials prove that it is impossible to equate the Tibetan biographical icon with Chinese landscape painting or the portrayals of the Buddha in the Ajanta frescoes; it is also impossible, without taking into consideration the overall cultural achievements of the peoples of Asia, to understand the specifics of the art of any individual country.</page><page sequence="12">50 THE TIBET JOURNAL notes &amp; references 1.
