<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMPOSIUM SANDRA HARDING'S SCIENCE AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY: FEMINIST AND POSTCOLONIAL ISSUES Thinking with a Good Heart JAMES MAFFIE "In order to weave and live a good life, a woman must 'think with a good heart,'" say Wixarika (Huichol) women in western Mexico (Schaefer 2002, 39). The relevant Wixarika word iyari translates roughly as heart, soul, heart memory (2002, 306), or I suggest, as heart-mind. Guided by a good iyari, a woman who follows the "path of becoming a master weaver or artisan," may "gain expertise in the many levels of Wixarika cosmology. She may then integrate these teach ings into . . . curing patients, communicating with gods, . . . creating textiles," and living an upright life (2002, 85). Sixteenth-century Aztec philosophy likewise claims that in order to think correctly about the cosmos, human affairs, and humans' relationship with the cosmos, one must think with a good heart (Maffie 2000, 2005a). Finally, classical Confucianism and Daoism embrace a similar epistemological-cum-moral notion. They speak of xi, which translates roughly as "heart-mind." Translating xi as heart-mind, according to Chad Hansen, "reflects the blending of belief and desire (thought and feeling, ideas and emotions) into a single complex dispositional potential" (1992, 20). These four traditions refuse to bifurcate what many leading modern North ern philosophies (such as Cartesianism, Kantianism, and logical positivism) standardly insist upon bifurcating:1 rationality and emotion, head and heart, thinking and feeling, and epistemology and ethics.2 The four maintain the indissolubility of reason and emotion, thinking and feeling, epistemically good cognizing and morally good cognizing, and facts and values. None rejects reason Hypatia vol. 23, no. 4 (October-December 2008) ? by James Maffie</page><page sequence="2">James Maffie 183 or rationality per se but only those views of reason and rationality that exclude emotion, feeling, values, and interests. They also claim that wisdom requires having a good, well-balanced heart-mind. I begin my discussion of Sandra Harding's Science and Social Inequality (SSI) with the notion of thinking with a good heart for three reasons. First, because I read SSI as arguing that Northern philosophers must begin "thinking with a good heart," and second, because I regard Harding as a philosopher who thinks with a good heart. Harding's thinking with a good heart is evident in her insisting that Northern sciences be refashioned from their current state as tools directed toward oppression, poverty, environmental destruction, "milita rism, profiteering, and social injustice" into tools directed toward "progressive" ends, such as universal democratic self-determination, human emancipation, human flourishing, mutual respect, cooperation, and environmental sustain ability (2006, 61-64). "The rise of new social values, interests, and the relations they direct," Harding argues, "requires inquiry practices and principles that can support and in turn be supported by these new forms of, we hope, democratic social relations" (156). She writes that "we appear to be in the middle of [a] shift in the dominant social formation, a shift that creates opportunities for the establishment of either Utopian or dystopian realities." Those committed to advancing social justice must consequently engage in critical self-examination, cross-cultural examination, and discussion of "the best strategies for distributing justly the benefits and costs of gaining . . . knowledge" (13). Harding also rejects Northern distinctions between epistemology and phi losophy of science, on the one hand, and moral, social, and political philosophy, on the other. "Our methodological and epistemological choices," she claims, "are always also ethical and political choices" (156). This too is consonant with thinking with a good heart. Although rarely questioned by Northern thinkers, these distinctions are, after all, neither self-evident nor universally recognized. Classical Confucianism and Daoism as well as many indigenous North Ameri can and Mesoamerican philosophies deny their very intelligibility. Thinking, reason, knowledge, truth, facts, and science are ineliminably interested and value laden, and these interests and values are always moral, economic, politi cal, and cultural. Science, epistemology, knowledge practices, and "the search for truth" are always already implicated in concrete moral, social, political, economic, and cultural projects. Future philosophical discussion of science and knowledge systems, therefore, must assess their adequacy in terms of "how [they] and others like [them] are used to shape future social practices" (156). I begin with the concept of thinking with a good heart for a third reason. There exists a rich body of "good-hearted" knowledge practices (involving mystical intuition, shamanic out-of-body journeys, dreams, and psychotropic substances, for example) that Harding discounts, if not completely silences, due to her selective focus upon what she regards as empirically based "ethnosciences."</page><page sequence="3">184 Hypatia Thus although Harding herself thinks with a good heart and urges others to do so as well, she appears unwilling to listen to those who do so in an insufficiently "empirical" manner. As a result, I fear we risk losing a wealth of potential benefits from such knowledge practices. Those of us striving to think with a good heart may well learn from the ideas and self-styled wisdoms of others who have sought to think with a good heart. What's more, as the Wixarika case shows, such knowl edges often fall within the province of the oppressed?that is, precisely those whose voices Harding's strong objectivity aims to incorporate and privilege. My countersuggestion is this: let us learn from whomever, whatever, and wherever we can without prior restriction. If "nonempirical" knowledge practices are not useful, we should make this judgment only after testing them, not before. Precis Harding's work is unique among contemporary Northern philosophies of science. She draws upon a rich and varied body of scholarship ranging from contemporary Northern and Southern feminisms; post-Kuhnian philosophies of science; science and technology studies (STS); studies of indigenous knowl edges; and finally, postcolonial studies. Harding takes her readers on a journey starting with pre-Kuhnian, Northern philosophy of science and STS, through Northern and Southern post-Kuhnian, postcolonial, and feminist philoso phies of science and STS, and ending with her own, strong objectivity-style, comparative evaluation of a "world of sciences" (2006, 5). Along the way, she challenges the hegemony and self-proclaimed universalism of Northern sciences and philosophies of science by localizing and decentering both. Northern sci ences become one collection of local ethnosciences among many; Northern philosophies, one collection of local ethnophilosophies among many. For Hard ing, "Eurocentric philosophies of modern science assume there is no reason to explore or reflect on any philosophical traditions but their own. They leave us blind in one eye that could be examining critically other traditions. And they leave us with a distorted vision in the other eye, which can see only the Global North and only from within its own self-serving mythologies" (65). She accordingly approaches "the world of sciences" with "both eyes open," that is, with "one on contemporary Western sciences and their philosophies and the other on other cultures' scientific practices and legacies" (51). In so doing, she seeks to "level the playing field" and thereby "gain a more accurate and comprehensive grasp ofthe strengths and limitations" of both Northern and Southern knowledge systems. This, in turn, will facilitate "our imagination to explore how our own knowledge systems and their relations to the economic, political, social, and cultural projects in our societies could be different than they are" (11). Thinking with a good heart, Harding asks, what are the moral and political values and visions that we "should want" informing our sciences</page><page sequence="4">James Maffie 185 and philosophies? (5). "What kinds of future relations can we imagine between modern Western sciences and these other knowledge traditions?" And what are "the possibilities and the value for everyone of living in a world of multiple knowledge systems?" (51) Science and Social Inequality avoids several common philosophical pitfalls. First, it avoids the coupled errors of "universalism" and "particularism." Uni versalism, on the one hand, claims that Northern science and epistemology transcend their origins and thus bear no social, political, economic, or cultural "fingerprints" (32). It also claims that Northern claims and values are universal and hence of import to all people, at all times, in all places. Particularism, on the other hand, "substitutes an insistence on" the particular and unique, and thereby, "abandon[s] the project of more accurately and usefully identifying shared conditions of human life and thought" (6-7). In so doing, it leaves us with a toothless, food court-style pluralism unable to challenge the North's global hegemony. Second, SSI avoids demonizing Northern sciences ("science bashing"), on the one hand, and romanticizing indigenous and other Southern knowledges as spiritually, morally, or ecologically pure or noble, on the other. Harding's sensitivity to the dialectical nature of knowledge practices enables her to argue that a culture's knowledge practices are both enabling and disabling, that is, both "prison houses" and "toolboxes" for the production of knowledge (153, 156). Third, Harding's "toolbox" approach to cultural resources allows her to cir cumvent epistemological relativism. On the one hand, there is no single, correct tool for every job in every set of circumstances. On the other, not all tools are equally good or useful (as relativism claims). Cluster bombs are not useful for drinking soup; backstrap looms are not useful for cooking food. Moreover, the concrete utilities of tools depend in large part upon the degree of fit between their structure and the structures of reality (contra relativism).3 Soliciting Encores Despite my admiration of Harding's project, I am worried by several aspects of SSI. These worries are not confined to SSI, seeing as they trouble me gener ally about recent Northern attempts to attain a feminist, multicultural, and postcolonial epistemology. I hope that by raising them here we may begin to allay them together. First, as an unapologetically Northern project, strong objectivity seeks critical input, novel ideas, and conceptual stimulation from Southern ethnosci ences. But what exactly counts as "science" and "ethnoscience"? In SSI, Harding defines "science" as "any systematic empirical study of ourselves and the world around us. . . . Thus, a knowledge system or set of inquiry practices will be referred to as a science if it is systematic and empirical, regardless of whether it</page><page sequence="5">186 Hypatia is Western or non-Western, contemporary or ancient, obviously embedded in religious beliefs or other cultural beliefs or not apparently so" (10). I question the wisdom of confining ourselves to empirical knowledge systems so defined when our goals are to learn from alternative knowledge systems and to stimulate our own imaginations "to explore how our own knowledge systems and their relations to the economic, political, social, and cultural projects in our societ ies could be different than they are" (11). Why not include the world's many nonempirical knowledge practices among the "variety of culturally diverse practices that have the perpetual possibility always of producing new insights and ways of interacting with the world around us" (48)? I worry that such a narrow focus encourages us to disregard (on the grounds of being insufficiently empirical or ethnoscientific) knowledge practices such as shamanism and mys ticism that may contain unimagined, life-enriching insights regarding human coexistence with nature and other human beings, as well as insights capable of radically challenging our Northern epistemic?and ultimately, social, political, and economic?practices. Can Northerners afford to ignore these? Indeed, many Southern knowledge systems maintain that what Northern philosophies regard as nonempirical modes of experience (such as dreams and visions) culled by nonempirical practices (such as out-of-body journeys, trances, and ingesting psychotropic substances) yield indispensable experiences of one ness, interrelatedness, awe, unity, and power. Such experiences standardly serve as the fountainhead of many of the very ideas of Southern wisdoms that many Northern thinkers find so appealing: for instance, the interconnectedness of all things in nature; maintaining sustainable relations with the environment; and human responsibility and respect for the environment.4 This being so, why not avail ourselves of the fruits of these practices when pursuing the self-criticism of strong objectivity? It would appear we have much to gain and little to lose. Similarly, if the adequacy of a philosophy of science "is to be measured by how it and others like it are used to shape future social practices" (156), why adopt such a narrow focus? Echoing Charles Saunders Peirce and Paul Feyerabend, why place this obstacle on the path of future inquiry?5 Harding rightly criticizes Northern thinkers for routinely dismissing the knowledge systems of other cultures on the grounds that they are "infused with superstition, magic, religion, and other forms of irrationalism and anthropomor phism" (5). But by focusing on the empirical at the expense of the nonempiri cal, I fear Harding upholds the selfsame Northern prejudice. She apparently believes we Northerners have little or nothing to learn from nonempirical knowledges. But why not? Buddhism, for example, clearly fails to qualify as an ethnoscience by Harding's criterion, yet recent exchanges between the Dalai Lama and Northern psychologists suggest that Northern psychologists have a great deal to learn from Tibetan Buddhist models of mental health. Other examples abound.6</page><page sequence="6">James Maffie 187 Ironically, in the eyes of many Southern philosophers Northern philoso phies' insistence upon what Southerners regard as an impoverished notion of experience is precisely what explains the latter's arrogance, foolishness, and environmental unsustainability. The late Sioux philosopher Vine Deloria, Jr., wrote: In an epistemological sense, there is no question that the tribal method of gathering information is more sophisticated and cer tainly more comprehensive than Western science. In most tribal traditions, no data are discarded as unimportant or irrelevant. Indians consider . . . their dreams, visions, and prophecies, and any information received from birds, animals, and plants as data that must be arranged, evaluated, and understood as a unified body of knowledge. This mixture of data from sources that the Western scientific world regards as highly unreliable and suspect produces a consistent perspective on the natural world. (1999, 66-67, see also 44 )7 Deloria, Jr., thus poignantly raises the question: Whose conception of experience is relevant when considering whether a knowledge practice is empirical? Second, although Northern scholars have long dismissed the astronomical, botanical, and medical knowledges of other cultures on the grounds they are "infused with superstition, magic, religion, and other forms of irrationalism and anthropomorphism," they have recently upgraded these to the category of ethnoscience. Although still unwilling to call them "science," Northern think ers reason that since they resemble sufficiently their Northern counterparts, they are, epistemologically speaking, more than "mere" religion, mythology, or superstition. On the other side of the coin, Harding contends that Northern sciences such as physics are properly viewed as ethnoscience. Her consequent leveling of the playing field between ethnosciences, Northern and Southern, is long overdue. She also defends the need to expand our understanding of ethnoscience from more obviously scientific, so-called "High Church" activi ties, such as physics, to include less obviously scientific, so-called "Low Church" activities, such as farming, cooking, navigating, tool making, and child rearing. Although perhaps less self-conscious, self-critical, and systematic than the former, the latter are nevertheless scientific.8 Yet I worry that Harding's selection of what to include among Low Church activities reflects a lingering Northern prejudice against not only nonempiri cal activities but also activities that are, by Northern lights, deemed merely symbolic, artistic, noncognitive, or expressive (for instance, ritual, ceremony, storytelling, speech, poetry, singing, dancing, painting, and musical perfor mance). But why not include these as ethnosciences? In order to make plau sible to Northern audiences her claim that "Low Church" activities are rightly</page><page sequence="7">188 Hypatia counted as ethnosciences, I suspect Harding feels obliged to pay homage to commonplace and tutored Northern understandings of "science" and "the practical." And while Northern audiences may be willing to admit tool making and navigation as ethnosciences, it is doubtful that they would go so far as to admit ritual, music, and dance. But by Southern lights, these activities are consummately practical, causally efficacious ways of acting upon, intervening in, and learning from the cosmos. I thus urge Harding to include these activities among what she calls ethno sciences. If calling them ethnosciences is too bitter a pill to swallow, I propose she abandon talk of science and ethnoscience and the Northern baggage they carry in favor of talk of ethnoknowledge and ethnoepistemology. While these are not baggage-free either, they are less so. By including both the "practical" and "nonpractical" in our purview, we further level the playing field. This issue is not fatuously terminological. At the end of the day, what is important is not what we call these activities but whether we are willing to examine them as potential sources of insight, self-criticism, change, and unimagined possibilities. And we shouldn't let the word science get in the way. I heartily applaud Harding for enjoining us to keep both eyes open. In light ofthe foregoing, however, I propose that we Northern thinkers open a third eye, one focused upon apparently "nonempirical" and "nonpractical" knowledges. These contain the lion's share of the world's wisdoms. The third eye has long been a symbol of wisdom in South Asian philosophies, and I invoke it here so that we do not lose sight of the world's many wisdoms, for it is precisely wisdom, that is, thinking with a good heart, that the Northern philosophical and scientific thought has long forsaken. Finally, chapter 3 of SSI surveys possible projects for constructing future Northern and Southern sciences and cultural traditions. They are integrating non-Southern sciences into Northern sciences, integrating Northern sciences into Southern sciences, delinking Southern sciences from Northern sciences, and using Southern sciences as models for Northern sciences. Surprisingly absent from this survey is a collaborative, polycentric project involving par ticipants from both Northern and Southern knowledge systems.9 This would seem an appropriate and timely project in the face of global environmental crisis. While presuming neither universality nor the ability to attain a "view from nowhere," such a project possesses the potential for radically challenging Northern prejudices as well as for overcoming the dichotomy between North and South itself. Is Harding silent about such a project because she (rightly) considers it obviously unacceptable to most Northerners? After all, such a project would require Northerners?from philosophers and scientists to policy makers and activists?to abdicate their de facto greater power, control, and privilege in deciding the future of humankind. But one needs to ask: Can</page><page sequence="8">James Maffie 189 humankind make any genuine progress toward the goals of universal democratic self-determination, human emancipation, human flourishing, mutual respect, cooperation, and environmental sustainability by any other means than a collaborative South-North undertaking? In conclusion, I hope the foregoing comments help progressives think with a good heart about the kinds of future democratic projects that SSI advocates. As Harding remarks, "The sciences we have are not inevitable. We could have created very different systems of knowledge. We can still do so" (49). Notes An earlier version of this paper was presented at the American Philosophical Associa tion Eastern Division Meeting, December 2006. I'd like to thank Howard Brick, Julie Greene, Kaplan Hasanoglu, Sandra Harding, Sean Waters, and an anonymous referee for their many helpful suggestions. 1. For simplicity's sake, I follow Harding and employ the binary North versus South despite its shortcomings. Other proposed binaries include West versus non-West and first world versus third world. None is without its problems. As Harding (1998, 203nl) observes, these terms refer to historically constituted schools of thought and discursive traditions, not to the ethnicity, gender, nationality, or residence of their practitioners. 2. For further argument, see: Hickman and Alexander 1998; Jaggar 1989; Lloyd 1984; Plumwood 1993; Railton 1991; and Rose 1994. 3. It is not apparent, however, how Harding's toolbox approach avoids the charge of Northern piracy lodged by Southern thinkers such as Shiva (1997) and Smith (1999). 4. M. Battiste writes, "A fundamental element in tribal epistemology (lies) in two traditional knowledge sources: from the immediate world of personal and tribal experi ences, that is, one's perceptions, thoughts, and memories which include one's shared experiences with others; and, from the spiritual world evidenced through dreams, visions, and signs which (are) often interpreted with the aid of medicine men or elders (quoted in Aikenhead 1997, 220-21).
