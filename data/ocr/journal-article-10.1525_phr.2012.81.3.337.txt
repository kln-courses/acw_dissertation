<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Modernism in the Borderlands:   The Life and Art of Octavio Medellín STEPHANIE LEWTHWAITE The author teaches in the Department of American and Canadian Studies at the  University of Nottingham. This article examines the life and work of Octavio Medellín, a Mexican-born sculp- tor based in Texas during the 1930s and 1940s. It argues that Medellín was not  simply a Mexican artist operating within the confines of an indigenist and na- tionalist art; neither was he a modernist primitivist artist committed to the search  for pure form. As an emerging Mexican American subject located on the margins  of both homeland and host society, Medellín synthesized the categories of Mexican  art, regionalism, and modernist primitivism to produce an alternative modernism.  Medellín’s art reflects the bicultural complexities of becoming Mexican American in  the United States—the appropriation and transformation of one’s ancestral heritage  while seeking cultural and political citizenship in a new land. Medellín’s artistic  journeying also underscores the multidirectional and transcultural origins of mod- ernism during the 1930s and 1940s. Key words: Sculpture, Mexican American, Borderlands, modernism, primitivism,  regionalism Behind them lies a store of traditions of another race, customs of past ages,  an innate love and reverence for another country. Ahead of them lies a  struggle in which they are to be the champions. It is a struggle for equal- ity and justice before the law, for their full rights as American citizens. . . .  They are the converging element of two antagonistic civilizations; they have  the blood of one and have acquired the ideals of the other.

Yet these dilemmas also manifested themselves in other cul- tural spheres, such as the visual arts. When Mexican-born sculptor  Octavio Medellín made a new life for himself in Texas during the  1920s and 1930s, he too integrated the “customs of past ages” with  the values of mainstream American society. Medellín negotiated  his pre-Columbian ancestral heritage and the struggles of the  Mexican Revolution with the dictates of a modernist, European  American art world. In the latter, the trend toward the univer- sal, rather than the celebration of difference or one’s individual  cultural and ethnic background, was prioritized. Existing artistic  categories and narratives have tended to obscure the complexi- ties facing Mexican American artists in the United States. For ex- ample, the dominance of Mexican muralism in studies of Mexican  American and Chicano art has positioned the latter as merely “de- rivative” of Mexican art. Meanwhile, as Lowery Stokes Sims has  noted, the “primitivist” view in art-historical discourse has often  “obscured the contributions of artists of color who have engaged  modernism in a fruitful dialogue that incorporates specifics from  their own cultures.”2  Medellín was not simply a Mexican artist operating within  the confines of an indigenist and nationalist art; neither was he a  modernist primitivist artist committed to the search for pure form.  As an individual with an emerging Mexican American identity,  he was located on the margins of both homeland and host soci- ety and therefore engaged multiple cultural and artistic spheres.  Medellín synthesized the frameworks of Mexican art and modern- ist primitivism, transcending their limits in the process, to produce  an alternative modernism that reflected the bicultural realities of  becoming Mexican American in the United States. Medellín’s art  reflects the complexities of this biculturalism—the appropriation  and transformation of one’s ancestral heritage while seeking cul- tural and political citizenship in a new land.

Medellín’s life and career Unlike the trained Mexican School professionals who secured  high-profile commissions from the East Coast art elite, sculptor  Octavio Medellín was an immigrant from Matehuala, San Luis Po- tosí. Born in 1907 of Otomí Indian ancestry, Medellín was the son  of a mineworker, Manuel, who died during the Mexican Revolu- tion after being imprisoned and then released by soldiers. After  migrating between different mining towns, the Medellín family  fled Mexico during the Revolution. Young Octavio arrived in San  Antonio, Texas, in 1920, along with his mother, siblings, and a visa,  but also with what he described as “very little school education and  no art training.”3  In 1921 Medellín began studying at the San Antonio School  of Art, taking night classes with Spanish landscape artist José Arpa  and Arpa’s nephew, Xavier Gonzales, both of whom had studied in  Mexico at the San Carlos Academy. Medellín, however, struggled  to secure formal art training and took a variety of jobs to support  himself, including working as a hardware clerk between 1922 and  1927.4 In 1928 he left Texas for Chicago where he worked as a bus- boy and took life-drawing classes at the Art Institute of Chicago in  the evening. At first, Medellín painted with very thick oils in order  to mimic a three-dimensional effect but quickly turned to sculpt- ing wood because it was less expensive and allowed him greater  creativity.5 He completed his first sculpture, Tehuana, in 1928 from  local pecan wood.  In search of training and artistic inspiration, Medellín re- turned to Mexico in 1929 but failed to secure a place at his men- tors’ alma mater, San Carlos Academy. While in Mexico, however,  he met Jean Charlot, José Clemente Orozco, Mexican-based  Colombian-born sculptor Rómulo Rozo, and, in the School of Plas- tic Arts, his “life-long friend” and mentor, Carlos Mérida.

Medellín returned to the United States in 1930. By 1934 he  had immersed himself in San Antonio’s artistic circles. In response  to the city’s failure to exhibit modernist and experimental works,  Medellín helped established La Villita Gallery in an old, declining  neighborhood with his new patron, Missouri-born artist and preser- vationist Lucy Madison Maverick, granddaughter of cattle rancher  Samuel Maverick, who had signed the Texas declaration of inde- pendence, and daughter of San Antonio businessman and lawyer,  George Madison Maverick.7 Medellín soon became associated with  Texan sculptors Bess Bigham Hubbard, Ione Franklin, Michael G.  Owen, Evaline Sellors, Allie Tennant, and Dorothy Austin, whose  art reflected the framework of modernist primitivism. The central  belief of modernist primitivism, Barbara Braun has noted, was “the  notion of artistic progress through formal and technical innova- tion informed by styles of the past.”8 Austin, Hubbard, Franklin,  and Sellors in particular were strong advocates of direct carving, an  offshoot of modernist primitivism that involved experimentation  with “archaic,” non-western art forms. Direct carving became asso- ciated with Constantin Brancusi and Henry Moore in Europe and  with William Zorach in the United States; the latter tutored Frank- lin and Austin at the Art Students’ League in New York, as well as  Medellín’s patron, Lucy Maverick. Medellín exhibited alongside  Tennant and Austin at the 1936 Texas Centennial, and the three  artists established the Texas Sculptors Group in 1943.9  Medellín’s participation in the 1936 Texas Centennial un- derscored his affiliation with Texas regionalism during the 1930s  and 1940s, which was, to quote proponent Jerry Bywaters, very  6.

While Medellín was not necessarily an outsider in the Dal- las Nine circle, the “stark, empty” landscape paintings of Hogue,  Dozier, and Bywaters have become the most iconic Texas regional- ist images. It might be fair to say that Medellín had a greater im- pact on Texas sculpture in a broader sense, and in 1943 he became  secretary of the Texas Sculptors Group, after the Dallas Nine circle  members went their separate ways in the early 1940s.11 Further- more, Medellín’s location in Texas and the flexibility of the Texas  regionalist group assisted his entry into a series of art worlds. Had  Medellín been operating out of New York, where transatlantic art  connections dominated, this entry might not have been possible.  In particular, Medellín’s location in South Texas and his proximity  to the U.S.-Mexican border facilitated his reconnection to the art  and architecture of his homeland.  Medellín’s second trip to Mexico in 1938, with Lucy Maver- ick’s assistance, involved six months researching Mayan-Toltec art  at Chichén Itzá and Uzmal, Yucatán. Having recently returned  from Latin America, Lucy Maverick convinced the artist to take  his wife and young family to Yucatán (at the time, Medellín was  working daily shifts in a lumberyard for $60 per week and at La Vil- lita Gallery during weekends to support his family).12 At Chichén  Itzá, Medellín made studies of relief carvings from the Temple of  the Tigers and the Temple of the Warriors; these were later trans- lated into eleven lithograph prints that appeared in the 1947 work  XTOL: Dance of the Ancient Mayan People, prefaced by Salvador To- scano, head of the Department of Fine Arts for Public Education  10.

He compiled numerous photographs of  seated and reclining figures, such as Chac-Mool, as well as stone to- tems adorned with human and animal forms, which directly influ- enced his monumental, cubic, and column-like sculptures during  the 1930s and 1940s.14 Further trips to Mexico and Guatemala in  1959 show that Medellín’s fascination with pre-Columbian art and  architecture persisted throughout his career. His travels influenced  his large-scale architectural commissions in churches, synagogues,  and temples after the 1950s, in which he integrated sculpture into  monumental architectural projects using ceramics, mosaics, deco- rative and molten glass, and bronze.  Between 1938 and 1942, Medellín had a teaching post as  artist-in-residence at North Texas College, Denton (now the Uni- versity of North Texas). Here Medellín reunited with Mérida, a  visiting professor from 1941 to 1942. He also won recognition at  the national level, participating in New York’s 1939 World’s Fair  show, “American Art Today,” and, three years later, in the Museum  of Modern Art’s (MoMA) touring exhibition of artists from nine  states, “Americans, 1942.” Medellín exhibited seven works in this  show, a “singular honor,” according to Rick Stewart.15 Despite the  MoMA show and many subsequent offers from galleries, Medellín  focused on teaching in order to support his wife and young family.  He later declared, “I would probably be sitting on top of the world  if I’d gone with a gallery.” Instead, he decided to become his “own  businessman.”16  After gaining U.S. citizenship in 1942 and working during  World War II as a plaster pattern-maker at an aviation plant, Me- dellín joined the DMFA where he gained prominence as a sculp- tor with the support of Bywaters, the DMFA director. Medellín  taught at that museum for twenty-one years, combining his posi- tion with teaching at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from  13.

Medellín spent a brief interlude in Men- docino, California, where he established his own sculpture studio  in 1964. In 1966 he resigned from the DMFA and established the  Medellín School of Sculpture in the Dallas Creative Arts Center.  He officially retired in 1980 but continued working into the 1980s,  residing at Bandera, Texas, until his death in 1999.  Most of Medellín’s work remains in Texas, principally at the  DMFA and SMU.17 Yet several key items were included in the Bronx  Museum of Art’s 1988–1990 traveling exhibit “The Latin Ameri- can Spirit: Art and Artists in the United States, 1920–1970,” which  recognized Medellín’s national and cross-border significance as a  Latino artist. In 1973 art historian Jacinto Quirarte paid tribute to  Medellín as an influential Mexican American artist whose work in  connection with the Mexican School presaged the art of the Chi- cano generation. Other critics have emphasized Medellín’s region- alist credentials.18 Although most of his papers are housed outside  Texas, in the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art  and at Syracuse University, Medellín is rarely mentioned in main- stream histories of American modernism or recent critical studies  of Latino art.19 Nevertheless, his artistic journeying tells us much  about the vagaries and varieties of modernism during the 1930s and  1940s, as well as the biculturalism of Latino artists in the United  States. By negotiating different artistic and cultural worlds— modernist primitivism, regionalism, and Mexican muralism—  Medellín produced a distinctive modernism that reflected the  complex realities of becoming Mexican American. Modernist primitivism and direct carving Medellín was influenced by the framework of modernist  primitivism and, in particular, by the American proponents of  direct carving, William Zorach, John Flannagan, and Alexander  17.

Rejecting the technical aspects of traditional bronze cast- ing and marble work, which necessitated the intervention of a  team of craftspeople to assist the artist, direct carving “required  that the sculptor alone be intimately involved with the entire cre- ative process.” This approach resulted in experimentation and  the simplification and abstraction of form.21 It was precisely this  quest for artistic freedom that shaped Medellín’s move toward  sculpture after 1928. “I cannot explain the dissatisfaction paint- ing had brought to me,” he declared; “here the struggle to grasp  the creative had been impossible.”22 Whereas Medellín found  that oil paint could not be manipulated, stone was a different  matter: “Stone is beautiful in itself and does not admit of any  tricks. It makes one desire to bend its surface into form but not  to take advantage of and destroy its character.”23 Importantly, di- rect carving allowed the artist to experiment with abstraction,  geometric simplification, and the monumental without jettison- ing figurative work. By focusing on the human figure and encouraging truth to  materials, direct carving established a perceived connection with  earlier forms of artisanship and so-called “primitive” or archaic  art.24 For example, Medellín drew on iconography from across  Asia, including Javanese reliefs, temples, and sculptures of Bud- dha. His relief-like Doe and Fawn (c. 1940s) bears a striking re- semblance to John Flannagan’s The Lamb (1939). The animals’  elongated eyes and gracefully twisted antlers mimic scenes found  on Indo-Sumerian seals and were probably inspired by the early  20.

By elevating Mayan-Toltec and Olmec art, Me- dellín followed European modernists such as Moore, who believed  that highland pre-Columbian art, and artistic expression within  “archaic” cultures more generally, emanated from a “primal” de- sire to create rather than from a considered drive to push the  boundaries of artistic convention.27  Medellín’s 1938 trip to the Yucatán to study and record Mayan- Toltec art suggests that, like Moore, he too engaged in a form of  primitivizing. Medellín explained that he “learned a little of the  primitive and creative way of life” during these trips.28 Not least,  he perceived the region’s art and people as one entity: “I went to  Mexico to see art. Actually, the art was the people.”29 Medellín’s tes- timony and the scrapbook of photographs that he compiled while  staying in Pisté, a small town three miles from Chichén Itzá, portray  a pristine, pre-modern village, a “kind of historical” place that was  immune to change and adaptation. He later concluded: “of course  now if you go [you] see Coka-Colas in everything, at that time there  was nothing like that.” Medellín recalled the hut built specially for  him and his family by Pisté’s residents: “We could sleep in there,  very primitively. There was another experience for both my wife  and I . . . and the children. . . . everything was so natural, we had  to take a shower outdoors . . . from the well, there was a shower like  25.

The trend toward formalist primitivizing within direct carving  influenced the artist’s pre-Yucatán works, such as Primitive Woman  (1931, Figure 1). The figure’s bust is monumental, bold, and flow- ing as the head poised in profile turns upward in search of tran- scendence. Although Primitive Woman’s hands and tilted head evoke  the gestural features of pre-Columbian deities, the ethnographic  context is subsumed by stylistic conformity, the eyes and nose be- coming formal devices devoid of expression. Primitive Woman is a  timeless figure whose blocky, frieze-like form mirrors the “impas- sive demeanor” of Henry Moore’s female nudes. Like Moore, Me- dellín transformed the pre-Columbian male deity into a female  nude, signifying the modernist sculptor’s loyalty to both neoclassi- cism and the search for the maternal, sensual, and exotic within  nature.31 Medellín believed that “sincere art must be elemental and  close to the earth.”32 His primitive woman motif reappears in Spring  (c. early 1930s), which is based loosely on the miniature terra-cotta  dancing figures “discovered” by Manuel Gamio at Teotihuacán,  Mexico, in 1922. Spring’s rhythmic, semi-nude form symbolizes fer- tility and renewal; it also illustrates the force of primitivism in shap- ing modernist aesthetics, such as modern American dance, through  formal expression and psychic energy. In this reading, Medellín’s  primitive woman lies closer to Paul Gauguin’s Polynesian figures  than to the pre-Columbian sculpture that first inspired him.33  As Barbara Braun noted, Moore appropriated pre-Columbian  sculpture because its “stoniness” mirrored church images from me- dieval Europe, thus supporting the notion that art was universal.  Medellín also imbibed the theory behind modernist sculpture that  all art practices, regardless of differences in time and space, shared  some intrinsic “unity.” The artist, he said, must “produce an experi- ence that becomes a universal statement.”34 Medellín’s commitment  30.

This commitment perhaps explains Medellín’s inclusion in  C. Ludwig Brumme’s Contemporary American Sculpture (1948), which  took as its mantra, to quote Zorach, that, “in this day of intimate  PHR8103_01.indd   347 10/07/12   10:26 AM </page> <page sequence="12"> 348 Pacific Historical Review communication, art is universal and tribal differences so slight as  to be no more than a flavor.”35 Within the international art world,  then, Medellín’s experimentation with pre-Columbian sculpture  was perceived as evidence of the “universal” language of form. Texas regionalism and pan-Americanism The quest for a universal art, however, obscured the multiple  references guiding Medellín’s work. Medellín’s art was not affili- ated only with modernist primitivism but also with Texas region- alism and pan-Americanism. While Medellín insisted that “sincere  art must be elemental and close to the earth,” he also suggested  that art should be “a symbol of the people.” He explained that  “The trend of my art is toward the common people and everyday  life, the kind of people and environment I myself come from.”36 In  many ways, Medellín expressed a central tenet of New Deal art and  its affiliate, regionalism: Art should express an egalitarian ethos  and the drive toward cultural democracy by reflecting a “folk” or  vernacular element and the relationship between humankind and  the environment.  Medellín found a foothold within the regionalist movement  because Texas regionalism was broader than the conventional  American Scene movement and “had more to offer than a shallow  artistic nativism.” The bleak and somewhat surrealist landscapes  of Bywaters, Dozier, and Hogue evoke a regional consciousness  without sentimentality.37 As art historian Martha Cheney noted in  1939, Texas regionalism fostered a haven for “independent mod- ernism” in the state where style was employed for itself, as much as  for its ability to articulate a regional consciousness.38 Bywaters and  others were quite prepared to move beyond “local subject matter,”  as Rick Stewart noted, and toward an “abstract regionalist  aesthetic.”39 Bywaters, Medellín’s artist friend, founding member  of the Dallas Artists’ League, and director of the DMFA between  1943 and 1964, affirmed this trend when responding to his critics:  35.

It has always  been the relationship of the artist to his environment—and that  environment may be in his head. We’ve got to have a balance be- tween supporting things familiar to us as well as bringing in things  from throughout the world to pollinate what is here.”40 Experimen- tation and flexibility were the hallmarks of Bywaters’s regionalist  aesthetic.  In this respect, Texas regionalists articulated a more fluid  sense of place than celebrated regionalists such as Thomas Hart  Benton, Grant Wood, and John Steuart Curry, whose representa- tional scenes of the Midwest depict the isolation and ethnic ho- mogeneity of small-town, rural America. The sparse, surrealist  paintings of Dozier, Hogue, and William Lester, with their images  of mobility, migration, drought, and loss, also differed from the  Romantic Regionalism manifest in the architectural revivals of  New Mexico and California, which emphasized roots, durability,  and harmony.41 Embedding their art in the landscapes, people,  and diverse cultural backgrounds that forged the state, region- alists also underscored that Texas was a “unique kind of meet- ing ground for several American cultures”—the Old South, the  plains of the Midwest and, most significantly, the “Hispano-Indian  past.”42 The “Hispano-Indian past,” however, was present in Texas  regionalism through the influence of both ancient and modern  Mexican art north of the border.  In addition to surrealism and folk art, Texas regionalists  drew on Mexican mural art and an evolving pan-American ethos  which, through Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and José Clem- ente Orozco in particular, expressed a hemispheric nationalism  counterposed to European modernism. Bywaters worked with Ri- vera in 1928 and was strongly influenced by the Mexican School’s  blending of European modernist form and indigenous content.  As director of the DMFA during the 1940s, Bywaters organized  a series of Latin American shows that included Rivera, David  Alfaro Siqueiros, Mérida, Rufino Tamayo, and Jean Charlot.43  40.

She became  an avid collector of Mexican arts and crafts and participated in  archaeological excavations in Central America. Her fascination  with pre-Columbian themes helped secure Medellín’s second trip  to Mexico in 1938.  These artistic crosscurrents shaped Medellín’s sculpture  and the reception of his artwork. Medellín’s History of Mexico  (1949, Figure 2) narrates the nation’s struggles from pre-Conquest  to the Revolution and beyond, through a series pre-Columbian re- liefs and registers. For DMFA curator Jerry Harwell, History of Mex- ico expressed the organic process of continental exchange rather  than the abrupt importation of distinctly un-American forces, à la  European modernism: “Some parts of the Southwest seem insepa- rable from Mexico because the people, the culture and customs of  that country have spilled over our border for hundreds of years.  Octavio Medellín has contributed to the enrichment of our art in  just this manner.”44 In this respect, Medellín’s work epitomized a  pan-American spirit, something that Dr. Cora Stafford, his next  patron and an enthusiast of Latin American art who studied and  taught south of the border, emphasized when she invited Medel- lín to teach alongside Mérida at North Texas College in Denton in  1941. Both artists contributed to what Mérida called “our . . . splen- did future of the Americas.”45 Just as modernist sculptors assumed ownership of “primitive”  art forms, Texan artists took special ownership of these sources.  They viewed them not simply as identifiably American sources, but  as specific to the region and central to the state’s unique contri- bution to a “Good Neighbor” policy based on cultural diplomacy  and transnational art flows. Harwell’s references to “our border”  and “our art” assumed ownership of these influences, mimicking  the artistic appropriation that underpinned modernist primitiv- ism.

Whereas Dozier and Bywaters employed the form of the  Mexican mural to shape their regionalism, Medellín went a step  further. He oriented his work not simply toward formal influences  from south of the border, but toward explicitly Mexicanist narra- tive content as well. Mexico’s “mestizo” modernism While direct carving, Texas regionalism, and pan-Americanism  facilitated Medellín’s experimentation with pre-Columbian and  Mexican iconography, he engaged what became “material” for  modernist primitivists not simply through a European American  lens. Although Medellín participated in his own form of primitiv- izing, he differed from mainstream modernist primitivists in sev- eral ways. His geographic and ancestral proximity to Mexico lent  his work an ethnographic awareness absent from Moore’s sculp- ture, for example. Unlike Medellín, Moore never visited the pre- Columbian sites that inspired his artwork. By contrast, Medellín  was “carried away with the desire to travel” after his first return  visit to Mexico in 1929.47 Although pre-Columbian art “was never  central to the ‘primitivist revolution,’” Braun has claimed, its influ- ence on Moore and André Derain in Europe was mirrored in the  work of Uruguayan Joaquín Torres-García and Mexican muralists  Rivera and Siqueiros. Medellín was more akin to his fellow Latin  Americans in his artistic journeying. He followed in the footsteps  of Rivera and Roberto Montenegro, who made similar pilgrimages  to Chichén Itzá and Uzmal in 1921 under the direction of José Vas- concelos, and of Charlot, who studied the Chichén Itzá murals and  produced drawings for the Carnegie Institution, just as Medellín  made studies of the relief carvings from the Temple of the Tigers  and the Temple of the Warriors.48  46.

His works, even those  produced prior to the 1938 Yucatán trip, exhibit some understand- ing of the contextual references and complexities of pre-Columbian  civilization. For example, Mixton (1930), one of Medellín’s few animal  sculptures, experiments with the formalist design elements of direct  carving. The jaguar’s hunched, rounded mass is hewn into large,  curved planes devoid of detailing, anticipating the squat stone forms  that Medellín would witness at the Temple of the Tigers in 1938.  Mixton also demonstrates specific ethnographic knowledge. The  piece captures the significance of the jaguar deity, which spanned  the Olmec, Toltec, Maya, and Aztec civilizations, and, by making im- plicit reference to the Mixton War in the title, Medellín underscored  the animal’s connection to both earthly and spiritual warriors.  Medellín replicated the vision of Mexican indigenists, who col- lapsed time and difference by equating contemporary indigenous  communities and “folk” art with ancient cultures and pre-Columbian  art. Yet the primitivizing gaze of Mexican indigenists and nation- alists worked in an opposite direction from that of European and  American modernists. The latter gaze, as Braun noted, challenged  the notion of western conquest by “revers[ing] the normal proce- dure in which the European assimilates the primitive by having the  primitive absorb the European, so that modern art would feed into  the native tradition.”49 Medellín also “reversed” this order so that  the modernist’s quest for innovation and formalist abstraction was  partly subordinated to an exploration of the content and thematic  concerns of pre-Columbian art and its historical significance for  translating contemporary Mexican realities.  The similarities between Medellín and the Mexican School  are unsurprising, given that he encountered several pioneers of  Latin American art in Dallas, Denton, and Mexico. These encoun- ters imbued Medellín’s aesthetic with traces of Mexican social re- alism, formalism, and a “mestizo” modernism. A Guatemala-born  artist of mixed Spanish and Maya-Quiche ancestry who traveled  to Paris, New York, and Mexico, Carlos Mérida was one of the  first artists to evolve a modernist vision based on integrating in- digenous aesthetics. While Mérida derived his interest in surreal- ism from Europe, he argued that his penchant for minimalism  49. Ibid., 186, 190. PHR8103_01.indd   353 10/07/12   10:26 AM </page> <page sequence="18"> 354 Pacific Historical Review and abstraction came directly from his Mayan heritage. Jacinto  Quirarte noted, however, that the Mexican School aesthetic “was  not the rebirth of pre-Columbian ideas or of a purely indigenous  sensibility or spirit as so often emphasized.” Indeed, both mural- ists and sculptors avoided any aesthetic “in which the motifs were  simply transcribed and their real artistic qualities and inherent  meanings ignored.” Instead, they worked to hybridize Spanish and  indigenous culture, Christian iconography, classical references,  and pre-Columbian forms.50 In doing so, they established what  Tace Hedrick has identified as a unique form of modernism in  Latin American art and literature during this period—a “mestizo”  modernism that blended indigenous, local, and vernacular sources  within a modern, hemispheric vision of the Americas.51 Medellín also blended pre-Columbian art forms with modern  national narratives, insisting, like Siqueiros, that art must not sim- ply replicate the past: “I live in a modern world as a sculptor and  I keep that heritage that I can’t deny. Neither do I want to copy it.  I don’t want to be an imitator of the Maya, or the Olmec, or the  Toltec.”52 Mérida, Medellín’s mentor and friend, underscored this  synthesis when he described the artist as blending “las formas llenas,  macizas, ciclópeas, de los escultores aborigines [the full, solid, gigantic  forms of the native sculptors]” with the popular style of artisans  in modern Mexico. Unlike European modernists, Medellín’s aes- thetic evolved “organically” and “intuitively” by way of his Otomí  ancestry rather than through the dictates of modernism’s formalist  enterprise. The result, Mérida concluded, was a new aesthetic that  involved “actuando paralelamente con el creador aborigen, asimilando el  espíritu, transformando la vida nueva y la vida antigua antes que tomar el  fácil, pero estéril, camino de la imitación o la similitude [acting in paral- lel with the native creator, assimilating the spirit, transforming the  new life and the ancient life rather than taking the easy, but sterile,  road of imitation or resemblance].”53 This aesthetic, then, synthe- sized form and spirit with an understanding of “el creador aborigen.” 50.

For  example, History of Mexico (1949) experiments with pre-Columbian  motifs, reliefs, and vertical registers to invoke an alternative, dia- lectical telling of time that is counterposed to a Eurocentric vision  of history. The circular, three-dimensional nature of Medellín’s  piece intensifies this juxtaposition.54 A narrative of the nation’s  epic struggles, from pre-Columbian times to the post-revolutionary  period, is constructed through a series of undulating, protruding,  and entwined figures representing different eras. Medellín deploys  an Aztecan understanding of time as cyclical and forged from “op- posing forces.”55 Vertical rather than horizontal registers narrate  this unique history, and the path toward renewal, transcendence,  and enlightenment evolves by engaging with chaos, destruction,  and sacrifice. Medellín begins with Coatlicue, the Aztec earth god- dess of life and death, and with Huitzilopochtli, the god of sun  and war; the final post-revolutionary stage of “Reconstruction”  links contemporary land reform, the nationalization of natural re- sources (namely oil), a critique of U.S. imperialism and the “de- cline of European influences” with a return to indigeneity and the  earth mother. Medellín’s final scene, “the corn harvest,” under- scores the centrality of maize as a symbol of regeneration and re- birth in Mesoamerica, suggesting that Mexican modernity involves  a cyclical return to origins in the material and temporal sense, a  trajectory in direct contrast to the flow of European history.  In many respects, Medellín replicated Rivera’s “material- ist” vision of Mexican history. As in Rivera’s similarly titled mural  series from 1930, The History of Mexico, time is rendered upward,  mirroring the pictorial modes of Mayan frescoes. Medellín’s vision  of history also reflects the dialectic between “progress and reac- tion,” a process captured in the figures of warriors, priests, and sol- diers who become, as in Mexican muralism and classical painting,  symbols redolent of key epochs in national history. Like Rivera,  Medellín employed these figures throughout his oeuvre to evoke  “thesis,” “antithesis,” and eventual “synthesis”—a process vital for  54. Quirarte, Mexican American Artists, 51. 55.

Spirit of the Revolution (1932, Figure 3) also blends different  timescapes—past, present, and future—and pre-Columbian and  Christian iconography with secular struggles. Mirroring the indig- enist, nationalist, and social realist strands of the Mexican School,  Medellín described Spirit as “the image of a people in a tragic out- cry for freedom from oppression . . .  [and a] revolt inflicted by for- eign influences and the power of the Christian religion against the  forces and spirit of their heritage.”57 This sculpture reworks time  and narrative, presenting the Revolution as a rerun of Spanish co- lonial conquest and evangelization, for in both epochs indigenous  culture was forced to battle external forces. Spirit establishes a lin- eage of oppression and violence in the figure of the revolution- ary soldier with his gun. Yet it is the presence of Quetzalcoatl, the  feathered serpent, creator god, and god of wind who presides over  the soldier and the series of pre-Columbian-inspired low reliefs  along the base that establish the indigenous heritage as a bridge  toward liberation and a modern, mestizo future.  The theme of sacrifice in Medellín’s work also evokes an al- ternative telling of time, by connecting disparate faiths and pre- Columbian history with contemporary Mexican realities. For  example, in History of Mexico the trauma of war, conquest, and evan- gelization is narrated by combining the Inquisition with the “Mili- tant Church” in the same column, as the Conquest period collides  with the Cristero Revolt. Similarly, in Penitentes (1940, Figure 4),  two crouching figures are stylized with the linear markings en- graved on the squat figures of Chichén Itzá while their clasped  hands and cubic form mirror the shape of Aztec deities and Toltec  standard-bearer figures. Whether the penitents cling to the Chris- tian faith or to a Mesoamerican religion remains unclear and un- important, for they symbolize an alternative, cyclical vision of time  in which the modern, mestizo future is created through sacrifice  and rebirth.58  The theme of sacrifice not only connects the pre-Columbian  past with revolutionary Mexico, but, in both a literal and meta- 57.

Unlike Moore’s emotionless and timeless reclining  woman, Medellín’s figures are representational vehicles that serve  to narrate specific historical and cultural meanings. Thus, like many of his Latin American counterparts, Medellín  espoused what Valerie Fletcher has called a “new syncretic mode of  PHR8103_01.indd   359 10/07/12   10:27 AM </page> <page sequence="24"> 360 Pacific Historical Review ‘multicultural’ modernism,” adapting European modernism to his  own context by drawing on nationalist, indigenist, and social real- ist content from his country of origin.59 Although Medellín’s work  mimics the formalist conventions of mainstream modernism, the  context shaping these individual works, their content and narrative,  and the forces that inspired his artistic journey differ considerably.  Medellín’s exploration of pre-Columbian forms derived first and  foremost from a desire to reconnect with the indigenous Mexican  heritage. Unlike the rationale underpinning European and Ameri- can modernism, Medellín’s artwork was neither “a visual expression  of primal urges extant in the subconscious,” nor a means whereby  past cultures were viewed simply as material to be appropriated in  the identification and fashioning of new artistic forms.60 Medellín’s  experimentation with specific cultural meaning, narrative history,  and social realism separate him from those modernists who went  in search of pure and universal form: Medellín’s sculptures empha- size the particular, namely the oppressive and exploitive realities of  Mexico’s pre-Hispanic, colonial, and revolutionary history.  Medellín’s art complicates the order whereby modernism ab- sorbs the “primitive,” and he became acutely aware of the appro- priative nature of mainstream modernism during his Yucatán trip  of 1938. Medellín returned to Mexico that year with the recommen- dation and financial backing of Lucy Maverick and the support of  the Carnegie Institution. Despite this patronage and her paternal- ism toward the artist and his family (“She was just like we were her  children”), Medellín asserted autonomy over the purpose and di- rection of the Yucatán commission. Although Lucy Maverick was  a “great inspiration,” Medellín’s earlier, self-funded “walking trip”  to Veracruz had already stimulated his interest in pre-Columbian  art, and it was during this first trip that he “learned to love [his]  heritage.”61 Countering the idea that he worked for money, men- tors, or the Carnegie Institution and archaeologist Sylvanus Mor- ley, Medellín claimed that “I was doing it to learn more. To get  59.

I learn more than anywhere I could have gone.”  While this suggests that he was indeed involved in the search for  new artistic forms, Medellín also learned something else. He re- called a telling incident during his visit to the Temple of the Ti- gers with the Fort Worth sculptor Charles Williams. On entering  the chamber of the temple, Williams exclaimed: “‘Oh, that’s Henry  Moore!’” Medellín replied: “And to him that was a Henry Moore.  I said, ‘No, Henry Moore copied him, ha . . .  ha . . .  ha.’” Medel- lín mocked the appropriative nature of modernist primitivism and  the failure of its adherents to acknowledge their artistic sources.  Moreover, he did so by using his own ancestral origins to lay claim  to this artistic heritage: “[T]he influence that I got was of course  my own.”62 If the artist’s recovery of his ancestral heritage demon- strates the multidirectional nature of modernist appropriation, it  also reveals a contradiction. Medellín’s quest to reclaim the origins  of modernist primitivism was much more complex, for he became  increasingly distanced from these “origins”; as a migrant subject,  he could never fully “return” to Mexico.   Mexican American modernism Medellín’s status as an “insider ethnographer” certainly dif- ferentiated his work from mainstream modernism.63 Yet Medellín  also differed from Mexican School artists because he worked out- side the confines of the Mexican nation-state. Although his artistic  rationale epitomized a similar quest for “cultural integrity,” un- like Rivera, he was not a nationalist, nor did he subscribe to the  radical politics espoused by Rivera and other muralists.64 Medel- lín described “the trend of [his] art [as] entirely away from politics  and sophisticated ideas.”65 Unlike Rivera, who idealized the pre- Columbian past, Medellín depicted pre-Columbian civilizations as  forged from conflict and imperialism; the lower registers of History  of Mexico, for example, depict the Toltec conquest of the Mayan  empire (a “Toltec leader subjecting Mayan prisoners”) and human  sacrifice among the Aztecs. Indeed, Medellín’s relationship to the  62. Interview with Medellín, 18, 56–57, 7.  63. Miller, Berlo, Wolf, and Roberts, eds., American Encounters, 512. 64.

The Revolution did not underscore Medellín’s nationalism  or his rootedness within one culture; instead, it generated disrup- tion, the uprooting of many families, including his own, and the  shaping of a Mexican American identity north of the border.  The 1938 trip to Yucatán demonstrated that Medellín could  not simply “return” to Mexico and “reclaim” his heritage, for he  was both an insider and an outsider, marked by his increasing af- filiation with the United States. He certainly assumed an affinity  with the community of Pisté. He recalled his “close” relationship  with the local Indian cacique, their shared understanding of the  Spanish language (he did not mention the indigenous tongue),  and his invitation to drink pulque and attend a rain god ceremony  barred to tourists. Medellín also stayed in a hut built specially for  his family by the residents of Pisté, rather than in the Carnegie- funded compound. The Medellíns, however, associated primarily  with Americans in Yucatán at the time, such as San Francisco- based artist David Slivka, a Works Progress Administration sculp- tor, painter, and later an abstract expressionist who accompanied  the family on sightseeing trips across the region. Pisté’s residents  were also initially wary of Medellín’s wife, Consuelo, whose pale  complexion convinced them that she was Anglo American rather  than Mexican.66 Furthermore, the family’s consumption of local  goods demonstrates the power dynamics and cultural assumptions  that separated them from rural Mexico’s indigenous communities.  Medellín recalled one particular photograph that he took of his  wife with two local women, all of whom appeared in “native dress.”  He remembered that the two local women asked to wear their  “American” dresses while Consuelo Medellín chose to be pictured  in full indigenous costume, bought locally for the occasion.67  The misappropriation of local culture also shaped his under- standing of pre-Columbian art. While Medellín’s testimony of the  1938 visit is peppered with references to Latin American artists such  as Charlot, Orozco, and Mérida, he could only grasp what he saw at  Chichén Itzá by framing it within the tradition of European art. “It  was a shock to see such beautiful buildings,” he admitted. Although  the relief carvings were in a state of disrepair, they had partly retained  66. Interview with Medellín, 13, 23, 36–38. 67. Ibid., 51; Medellín, photobook, 18.

For him, “this was  something amazing,” to the extent that he could only comprehend  the faces carved into the ceiling of the temples with reference to Mi- chelangelo.68 That Medellín’s primary reference for understanding  the carvings derived from European Renaissance art suggests his dis- tance from the homeland. But this wider sense of dislocation suggests  more—the emergence of a Mexican American subjectivity.  The view of Medellín either as simply a Mexican artist or as an  artist working within the confines of mainstream modernist primi- tivism occludes his significance as an emerging Mexican American  subject. If his artwork synthesized the stylistic referents of main- stream modernist primitivism with the subject matter and narra- tive codes of the Mexican School, it was not simply imitative. Holly  Barnet-Sanchez has noted that Mexican American/Chicano art is  often viewed as “derivative” of an earlier Mexican muralism when  in fact it is “appropriative” and suggestive of the changes wrought  by Americanization. To underscore this complexity and the transna- tional forces underpinning these processes, Barnet-Sanchez added  that the Mexican American/Chicano reality “is an American ex- perience—in both the national and hemispheric definitions of the  term.”69 In a similar vein, Carolina Ponce de León has argued that  Latino art can often be found “gravitating around the intersection  of North and South, of the vernacular and ‘high’ art. . . . U.S. La- tino art is also frequently both inside and outside of the art world’s  borders.” Mexican American and Chicano artists in particular, she  has noted, are “double outsiders,” sidelined from the “‘global’ art  world because of their alleged ‘folk’ aesthetics and politics . . . [and]  from the art worlds of their original homelands.”70 Although Barnet- Sanchez and Ponce de León were referring primarily to contempo- rary Latino and Chicano art, their analyses work equally well for un- derstanding Medellín’s position during the 1930s and 1940s.  Medellín struggled to gain acceptance as a sculptor on both  sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. In the United States, he was  often viewed as an “ethnic” artist whose work was described as  68.

Failing to secure a place at the capital’s San Carlos Academy in  1929, Medellín said: “I left Mexico City where I was confronted with  a worse experience than I had found in Chicago.”72 His experi- ences in the art world reflect the broader political, socio economic,  and cultural marginalization of people of Mexican descent  in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s—rejected by  Mexico as “too Americanized” (and often condemned as “or- phans,” or, worse still, “traitors”) and racialized in the United  States as “foreigners” without entitlement to citizenship, regardless  of nativity. These forces explain why Medellín faced the contradic- tion of having to reclaim and appropriate his own ethnic and artis- tic heritage. The ambiguities of Medellín’s transnational and bicultural  identity, and his struggle for recognition as a fine artist rather  than simply an ethnic artist, become evident in his references to  the local and universal trends shaping his work. While Medellín  proclaimed that his art was imbued with a “heritage that I can’t  deny,” he also invoked the concept of a universal art, so much so  that he once dismissed the significance of his ethnicity: “I reached  a point in my work that I was lost in a fantastic enormous field. . . .  I lost concept entirely of many things including my origin.” Yet, in  the same statement, Medellín acknowledged that “every once in a  while some one would . . . remind me that I was of Mexican origin.”  He established his acute awareness of these distinctions when he  juxtaposed himself questioningly with his mentor, William Zorach,  whose Lithuanian ancestry never precluded him from being con- sidered anything other than an “American” artist. “Once upon a  time,” explained Medellín, “I asked a well known sculptor William  Zorach why was it that every time that it was mentioned about my  work it was allwas [sic] Mexican artist. I knew perfect[ly] well and  [am] proud of what I am.”73 Here, Medellín alluded to the “deep- seated belief that Western artists must always transcend their par- ticular context and be representative of a universal perspective,”  while drawing attention to the ways in which “the same status of  71.

Jackson  Rushing has called a “critical cosmopolitanism.” Thus, Medel- lín critiqued modernism’s appropriation of pre-Columbian art by  asserting his ancestral origins and drawing attention to his own  tenuous status as a fine artist in the United States. In doing so, he  demanded that a so-called universal art open itself to “all of hu- manity,” instead of the privileged few.77  If this tension between the local and the universal challenged  modernism’s claim to be a universal art, it also rejected the con- fines of a nationalist art. Medellín’s assertion that “art belongs to  no nation” derived from his cross-border status and his belief that  art could function as a site for citizenship. When he spoke of forg- ing a “universal statement,” Medellín did so as a means of open- ing up the terrain of modernism for artists of color who shared his  insider/outsider status. The tension between the local and the  universal reflected his status as an emerging Mexican American  subject and, as Lowery Stokes Sims has noted in relation to other  artists of color, the “dichotomy between asserting the integrity of  one’s racial or cultural identity and being assimilated into the dom- inant culture.”78 If Medellín’s statements called for the citizenship  denied Mexican Americans in the United States, he called for a  type of citizenship that reflected the Mexican American condition  as bicultural, transnational, and “American” in both the national  and hemispheric sense, to reiterate Barnet-Sanchez’s point.  74.

This  is unsurprising, given that Medellín grew up on the U.S. side of  the border in South Texas, the “cradle of the Mexican-American  generation.” In 1921 Tejanos in San Antonio established La Orden  Hijos de América (Order of Sons of America), an organization  that merged with other Mexican American civil rights groups in  South Texas to create the League of United Latin American Citi- zens (LULAC) in 1929. Attorneys Alonso Perales and M. C. Gon- zales, LULAC’s main “organizer-intellectuals,” operated out of San  Antonio, as did La Liga Pro-Defensa Escolar (School Improvement  League) under Eleuterio Escobar. South Texas became the epicen- ter of LULAC’s expansion and maturation during the 1920s and  1930s as the debate over immigration restriction and the “capac- ity” of people of Mexican descent to become “good” citizens raged.  By claiming American citizenship and supporting the war ef- fort, Medellín followed LULAC’s demands. His artistic trajectory  also mirrored the biculturalism encouraged by many reformist  Mexican Americans who worked “to synthesize their experience  based on their relationship to their Mexican roots, their Mexican- American reality, and their search for an American future.”79  Roberto Treviño has noted that Tejano biculturalism involved the  persistence of a deep affiliation with Old Mexico alongside the  campaign for American citizenship, a drive that mirrored Medel- lín’s simultaneous quest for an indigenist and universal art. No- where was Tejano biculturalism stronger than in San Antonio, the  city that shaped Medellín’s formative years: San Antonio was most  heavily affected by the immigration flows of the 1920s and by the  nationalist indigenismo brought by recent Mexican migrants, a trend  evident in the Spanish-language press during the period. Medellín’s  artistic direction was therefore typical of this generation and re- flected a “transitional” phase toward becoming Mexican American.80  Although he did not appear to engage directly with Mexican Amer- ican politics in Texas during this period, he employed the phrase  79.

His art is stylistically variegated, multi- layered, and characterized by the dialectic between the local and the  universal. It is simultaneously archaic and modern; representational,  narrative, figurative, and abstractionist; and art historical and archi- tectural. It illustrates what Kobena Mercer has called “the multidi- rectional references of artistic practices in which memories of the  ancient ancestral past coexist with future-seeking aspirations for uni- versal freedom.” This simultaneity characterizes Penitentes and Holy  Roller. If the figures evoke universal themes, they also mimic Toltec  standard-bearer figures and Aztec deities. More importantly, they  symbolize the “genealogies of suffering, hopes, desires, confusion,  pain and loyalty” that shaped the Mexican American condition.83  Indeed, the conflicts of Medellín’s migratory reality—his  father’s imprisonment and death during the Revolution, the up- rooting and fragmentation of the family—imbue much of his  figurative work. Medellín said of El Ahorcado (1942, “The Hanged  One”): “[I]t treasures in spirit, a great part of myself as a kid, dur- ing the vast part of the revolution in Mexico.”84 The roughly hewn  and grainy-textured wood exacerbates the pained, almost emaci- ated, contortions of the crucified Christ-like figure whose skeletal  frame mimics the calaveras of Mexican illustrator José Guadalupe  Posada.85 Similarly, in At The Stake (1938, Figure 6), Medellín chan- nels his experimentation with pre-Columbian textures, lines, and  81.

The  dislocation of the literal and metaphorical body is represented by a  single torso, a strategy that Medellín repeated in later, increasingly  abstract works such as Moses (1951) and Fluid Form (1953), where  willowy, Giacometti-like figures are simultaneously inanimate  objects—crucifixes—with head, torso, and limbs being present yet  absent in one anthropomorphic form.

The recurring sacrifi- cial figure in his work is a symbol of the Mexican American condi- tion—the dislocation of the physical body and the emotional self;  the loss of one identity and the birth of another—as much as it is  a symbol of the Mesoamerican past, Mexico’s revolutionary nation- alism, or a “universal” Christianity. Perhaps Medellín’s sculptures  exude a greater degree of conflict and indeterminacy than Rivera’s  murals and Moore’s figures precisely because they reflect this very  process of becoming rather than being. Simultaneity, death, rebirth,  and the reconstruction of the self run throughout Medellín’s work.  It is no surprise to find the sculpture of a man cradling his young  child in Father and Son (1937) alongside El Ahorcado, or even in a sin- gle work such as The Struggle (1938), the imperceptible line between  fragmentation and wholeness, as two near-identical figures entwine  and couple in a cyclical movement, generating not the intermina- bility of struggle but the possibility of renewal and creation.  While Medellín appeared to imitate the forms of modernist  primitivism and the historical and social realist content of Mexican  muralism, he experimented with both in order to express a third  reality: his own cross-border existence as an emerging Mexican  American subject. Medellín did not necessarily solve the tension  between the local and the universal, or between the past and the  present, but he brought them together, evoking his ancestral her- itage through content and subject matter and his position within  the international art world through experimentation with modern- ist form. This synthesis better reflected the complexities—the pain  and the possibilities—of Medellín’s “dual cultural citizenship.”86  Conclusion In his study of Mexican American literature, John Morán  González stated that LULAC activism in Texas during the 1930s  and 1940s was “as much an aesthetic project as it was a legal or po- litical one.” Medellín’s output suggests that visual art was an equally  important vein of Mexican American “cultural critique” during this  period.87 Using art to explore his ancestral heritage and negotiate  86.

Medellín, however, did not simply appropriate  pre-Columbian art as a source with which to renew American mod- ernism, nor did he replicate the Mexican School’s nationalist and  indigenist art. His displacement, first as an immigrant subject and  then as an emerging Mexican American, distinguished Medellín  from both his European American and Mexican counterparts. Ulti- mately, he could neither “return” to Mexico nor claim an essential- ist “American” identity in the United States where citizenship was  based on whiteness. Medellín’s in-between status positioned him  at the crossroads of different art worlds—modernist primitivism,  Texas regionalism, and Mexican mestizo modernism—from where  he forged an alternative, hybrid, and “cosmopolitan” modernism.88  Harnessing European American modernism and a deep apprecia- tion of his ancestral heritage to the realities of becoming Mexican  American in the United States, Medellín’s modernism took an al- ternative pathway across space and time, for it reflected his own mi- gratory condition and emerging bicultural identity. As an artist, Medellín remains important not simply for “re- covering” lost or unacknowledged figures in the history of Ameri- can, Mexican, Mexican American, and Chicano art. Medellín’s  artistic journeying also reminds us of the multiple and circuitous  pathways to modernism, pathways that crisscrossed geographic,  ethnic, and temporal boundaries and that spoke of the trans- cultural journeys of early twentieth-century Latino artists in the  United States. Tomás Ybarra-Frausto has argued that Chicano art  during el movimiento revealed “a new story of amalgamation and  fusion.”89 Perhaps we should now begin that story of synthesis and  hybridity a generation earlier, with the work of Octavio Medellín.  88.
