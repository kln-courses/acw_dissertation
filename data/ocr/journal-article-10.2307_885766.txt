<plain_text><page sequence="1">New York and Dallas Painters of the Great Ming The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) marked a period of revival of Chinese native insti- tutions after the Mongol invasion and rule of China during the Yuan dynasty (1279- 1368). Especially at court, there was a desire to re-assert the national identity, and to re-establish the institutions of the Song dynasty, among which the painting academy was one of the models closest at hand. When the capital was transferred from Nanjing to Beijing in the north, pain- ters began to be assigned ranks in the im- perial bodyguard, ranks which carried no military duties, but which enabled their holders to be close to the Emperor, es- pecially in the reign of Xuanzong (1426- 35). Xuanzong himself was a painter of some distinction, whose work was rep- resented in the exhibition, Painters of the Great Ming (recently at the Dallas Museum of Art; closed 1st August), by two paint- ings, one a small album leaf showing two saluki hounds (Fig.44), the other a tall hanging scroll, featuring one of the imperial Pekinese under tall stems of bamboo, a depiction both elegant and quite clearly a source of relaxation and enjoyment as the inscription, with one invented character, a punning combination of the characters for 'dog' and 'laughter', makes clear. From dogs to all manner of birds and flowers, landscapes and human figures, this exhibition covered an impressive range. The paintings of this time and origin have long languished in obscurity, and the pro- cess of identification by connoisseurship is today still influenced by the long shadow cast by Dong Qichang (1555-1636) over works of the so-called Northern School (a category which in the Ming dynasty in- cluded both court painters and those of the Zhe School). Those who saw the exhi- bition at its Dallas showing, will have ap- preciated the more spacious surroundings, as in the New York showing at the Metro- politan Museum of Art there was not room enough for all the loans (the majority of Ming paintings are very large works).' In any case we may be sure that this exhi- bition and the accompanying catalogue2 will spark new interests and that many of the paintings will be shown again before too long. Besides the several chapters by Richard Barnhart, a substantial section of the cata- logue, by Mary Ann Rogers, examines the life and art of Dai Jin (1388-afterl460), well recognised as a leading master of the early Ming, as proficient in the blue and green style (for example the charming handscroll Spring clouds at Lianggu, cat.no. 45), as in monochrome ink landscapes (such as Solitary temple on pine cliffs, no.47) on a par with those by Shen Zhou (1427-1509), the doyen of the literati painters. Rogers deals admirably with the different accounts of Dai Jin's brusque treatment at the im- perial court, and also demonstrates the crucial importance of Chinese collecting records for the documentation of the influ- ence of a famous Yunnan collection in Dai Jin's career.

(no.42, in the Cleveland Museum of Art) was probably not painted by Dai Jin is quite persuasive. An exhibition such as this is above all an opportunity to compare at close quar- ters works that have become separated, in order to sort out what has come down to us into some semblance of order, and to determine what truly represents the genius of each succeeding generation. To do so is not easy: in the case of Ming paintings we must contend with three centuries of preju- dice which have relegated a large pro- portion of the works we see in this exhibition to collections outside China. Some, as I pointed out in this Magazine some twenty years ago,3 had their original signatures removed, in order that they might be passed off, particularly to foreign buyers, as the works of masters of an earlier age, generally of the Song dynasty. Recovering the true identity of such paintings is an exciting venture, which can bring real rewards in understanding, particularly where inscrip- tions and colophons are lacking or play but a small part, for these adjuncts to painting have in the Chinese mind be- come so integrated with painting itself that scholars and connoisseurs, guided by the spirit of Dong Qichang, almost instinctively prefer their presence, and may more easily have rejected the paintings in which they were lacking. Our hold on the distinctions between dynasties, in the matter of painting style, is still precarious, however. The enterprise is also not without its dangers, as in our zeal to assign identities in the chosen sphere, other works may be drawn in unnoticed, and end up, in a curious reversal of the situation which obtained before, by pur- porting to be Ming, when in fact they may be somewhat earlier. Fortunately there were not many such in this exhibition, in which the catagories of Ming court and professional painting, and the careers of its principal exponents, were fairly closely established: landscapes and figures in the style of the painting academy of the Southern Song (1127-1279); birds and flowers (es- pecially those by Lui Ji and Yin Hong) recreating in brilliant colours the achieve- ments of the Northern Song (960-1126) in this genre; large figures, often mythological or of legendary repute, and often framed by large landscape elements of tree or rock in rough ink and wash; and in the case of one artist at least, large bird or animal subjects, but rendered with the same rough ink and washes of the last. Not all the identifications proposed in the catalogue ring true, however. The most arresting case is the large hanging scroll of Mount Tai, China's Eastern Peak, one of the Five Sacred Mountains (to which the Metropolitan devoted an exhibition, curated by Professor Kiyohiko Munakata, a couple of years ago, though the excellent accompanying publication4 is not cited in the Ming catalogue). The huge monolithic mountain almost completely fills the entire scroll, over a metre wide and two metres high, leaving space only at the top right for the three characters Taishantu (Picture of Mount Tai) inscribed in seal script (Fig. 45). The attribution proposed for this im- pressive scroll is to one Ye Cheng, known by a single work in the Beijing Palace Museum. This painting, Yandang mountains (cat.figs.147a-b), though a topographical work of some distinction, lacks the monu- mentality of Taishantu, and is more in tune with other early Ming paintings such as the marvellous series of album leaves in the Shanghai and Beijing Palace Museums illustrating views of Mount Hua, by the physician Wang Lii.5 For instance, a small pavilion in the Beijing scroll competes with the mountains for the viewer's attention, so diminishing their sense of scale. Also, the anthropomorphic peak in the Beijing scroll, resembling a standing monk with shaven head and robe wrapped around him, betrays a different attitude towards the landscape from the straightforward description shown in the portrayal of Mount Tai. To begin with in Taishantu, figures and trees and mountain slopes are related on an exponential scale which serves to create the sense of monumentality and Ki .20's fzi .... ....... . .. .. ...

A gentleman is shown about to embark on the arduous climb by a path zig-zagging up the lower slopes towards the left. From this Barnhart assumes that the painting must originally have been more extensive, perhaps the right-hand element in a set of three scrolls each the size of this. Com- parison with the rubbing of Mount Tai engraved on stone reproduced by Muna- kata in Sacred mountains suggests, however, that the mountain was commonly depicted as a single massive peak. This is surely also the case here. The path to the summit reappears several times up the left side, sometimes only by four or five steep steps, obscured in photographs by the shadow cast by the wooden frame, which may conceal a further centimetre or so of silk on either side. While this is not the work of a great master, the numberless cun or modelling strokes, the contrasts of scale between figures and trees, between trees and the mountain, the turning of the peak to expose its flank, and the massive nature of the depiction that results from these techniques, all invite us to consider it as a Song painting, one not far removed in time and style from Li Tang who was active at the end of Northern Song and in early Southern Song, in the early twelfth century. Perhaps we should consider the possibility of its having been produced in the north under the Jin dynasty (1127- 1234). Among the figure painters, Wu Wei (1459-1508) is rightly regarded as a leading light, and the exhibition contains works to prove it, not least the British Museum's handscroll of wandering entertainers (no. 68) and the Indianapolis Museum's Lady carrying a lute (no.64), reflecting the artist's own experiences in Nanjing. An anony- mous painting of Two women looking at paintings (Fig.46) from the Dubois Schanck Morris collection in the Princeton Art Museum, is tentatively attributed in the catalogue to him, but I would like to draw attention to the striking resemblance be- tween this painting and Zhang Lu's Listening to the qin (Fig.47), formerly in the Ching Yuan Zhai collection and now in the Mu- seum ffir Ostasiatische Kunst, Berlin. Not only is there an affinity in subject-matter, but in each case the two figures are seen in close rapport, leaning over to appreciate the scroll or to catch the quiet sound of the instrument. The facial features, par- ticularly eyes, nose and lips, appear some- what angular in each case, and the drapery is rendered with incisive and rapid strokes, particularly in the ends of sashes or sleeves. The catalogue mentions the fur trimming to the robe of one of the two women, but one might also add that both are also wearing fur-trimmed caps, the fur carefully distinguished in tone and linearity from their own jet-black hair, and fastened in each case by a headband (on the left) or a hint of red ribbon. If this attribution to Zhang Lu is seen to hold good (and one should note his skill with groups of large figures engaged in admiring a painting, mending a fishing line, or bargaining for fish), then there would seem to be a good case for the British Museum's painting of Xi Wangmu and the phoenix (reproduced in the catalogue along- side Two women and likewise tentatively attributed to Wu Wei) being also by Zhang Lu. There are similarities in the subtle blend of pale colours in the neck of the phoenix and the ruff of downy feathers around it, in the jagged drapery lines of the scarves, as well as details such as ear- rings and headdress fastening. That the British Museum figure also holds a scroll is an intriguing coincidence. The previous attribution to Wu Wei was made by Arthur Waley, but the scroll itself bears no inscrip- tion, seal or label. At the monastery gate (Fig.48), also from the Morris Collection, is a truly delightful painting with rather more to it than many others. According to the catalogue, it bears a spurious signature of the Southern Song master Xia Gui, erased but still legible under ultra-violet light. With its use of the famous Ma-Xia 'one-corner' composition, an intervening stretch of water running obliquely across the painting to divide the foreground rock and boat from the opposite shore, the graceful lines of a weeping willow beside the enclosing wall of the cloister, partly hidden in mist, and distant 'eyebrow' mountains at the top of the painting, it makes abundant use of the Southern Song academic idiom. There is much of narrative interest in the painting too: in the boat a servant busies himself with a multi-tiered box of provisions, while the scholar in the bow turns from the scroll, incense burner and potted plant to watch two swallows disporting themselves over the water. The direction of his gaze leads beyond to the shore, where two pilgrim monks and their servants arrive at the main gate of a Bud- dhist monastery. In all this, the most resonant chords are with Ma Yuan rather than with Xia Gui: one is reminded of the Nelson-Atkins Mu- seum's handscroll Composingpoetry on a spring outing, particularly in the depiction of the boat, the water lapping gently along its sides, and the warmth with which the figures are described. Barnhart in the catalogue, however draws attention to the rocks, par- ticularly to the 'lightning-like' angular ridge, a distinctive feature of works by the mid-sixteenth century painter Wang Shi- chang. This is a by-product of the well- known 'axe-cut' stroke developed in the Southern Song and carried to new extremes of boldness in the Ming dynasty. One might also note, as a distinguishing feature of the Princeton painting, the clearly indicated lower contours of the rocks, causing them to appear to float rather than to be firmly anchored in the ground, and the 'nail- head' character of the strokes forming the figures, in contrast to Ma Yuan's generally straight and incisive strokes. I would note the somewhat taller proportions of other paintings by Wang Shichang (nos.79-80 and fig.5 in the catalogue), their shallower depth offield, and possibly also a less densely- 715 48.

This would still leave to be resolved the question of the erased signature. The usual reason for such an erasure is to add another signature by an earlier or a more famous master: in this case no substitute was added, so we have to assume that the painting once belonged to some enlightened collector who, aware that it could not be by Xia Gui the master, nevertheless recog- nised its intrinsic worth, and stopped short of supplying a further misleading attri- bution. An important afterword to the catalogue, by Richard Stanley-Baker, documents the influence of the Zhe school on Japanese ink painting of the Muromachi period; there is however no mention of the signifi- cant impact of the Zhe school in Korea, recently studied by Burglind Jungmann.6 It will readily be apparent that this enter- prising exhibition by Barnhart'and his colleagues provides ample materials for further study, and we should be grateful to him for the opportunity.
