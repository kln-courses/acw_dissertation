<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ULTIMATE AND THE MYSTERY A Critique of Some Neo-Mystical Tenets (Continued from JQR, M.S. LI [I960] 55-71) IV What are the characteristics of God who is "in search of man" (pp. I98, 286)22? (i) He is One, and His glory is one, and one means wholeness, in- divisibility (p. 312). He is not an object to be comprehended, not the sum of all facts nor a digest of all ideals. "He is the ultimate subject" (p. i6). His will is "eternal, transcending all moments, all events, including acts of revelation" (p. 217). "The will of God is in time and in eternity" (p. 265). "God is the great mystery" (p. 117). He is "a Being who is beyond the mystery" (p. I64). He is beyond the grandeur of nature (p. 97). "God is a Being beyond which no other exists or is possible" (p. 125). "Nature is not a part of God but rather a fulfill- ment of His will" (p. 97). He is not ultimate being of eternal mysterious- ness and total silence (p. 173). His speech is more than literally real (p. i8o), is a voice of silence (p. i86). (2) He is "a Being endowed with at least as much life and will as ourselves" (p. 128). "Time is the presence of God in the world" (p. 312). (3) He is more immanent in the Bible, in kindness, and in worship and sacred, sacrificial deeds than in nature and in space (p. 312). Mitsvot are of His essence (p. 289), are His "suppressed chants" (p. 290), are acts which He and men have in common (p. 287). He "is alive" (p. 126) and "in need of love and worship" (p. 28I.) He needs lives (p. 296). Prophecy and revelation are events in His life; revelation 22 Max Scheler (i874-1928) wrote four decades ago: "Man is the movement toward heaven, the tendency to the absolute, the transition to the divine, the corporal being directed toward God... He is the one who prays, even the prayer of life, through whom the universe reaches toward its Creator; he is the one who seeks God, nay, the one whom God seeks" (John M. Oesterreicher, Walls Are Crumbling [New York: The Devin-Adair Co., 1952], p. i62.-Cf. Fritz Heinemann, Neue Wege der Philosophie [Leipzig: Quelle &amp; Meyer, I929], pp. 348-369). And Simone Weil (Letter to a Priest [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, I954], p. 71), wrote in I942: "The idea of God going in quest of man is some- thing unfathomably beautiful and profound. Decadence is shown as soon as it is replaced by the idea of man going in search of God."</page><page sequence="2">I42 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW is His ecstasy (pp. I98-I99; 260o. He cries for man (p. 254). He has pathos (p. 252) and honor (p. 286). Man is His experience (p. 230) and His problem (p. 244). (4) He created man, and what is good in His eyes, is good for man (pp. 376-377). The rights of man are His sacred interests (p. 288). He is full of compassion for the distress of the soul (p. 403). He cannot act unjustly and, hence, clothes the naked, visits the sick, comforts the mourners (p. 289). He is "impressed by goodness" (p. 373) and waits for man to choose it (p. 412). (5) He discovered Israel and chose it. Israel is His mate. Judaism is His quest for man (pp. 424-425; 214; 260). He originated Israel's religion (p. I98). He became engaged to a [the Jewish] people (p. 214). The Bible is precious to Him (p. 243). (6) He hides from us, is not always at our disposal (p. 28), for there is a hierarchy of moments (pp. 129; 205). He gives man existence, wisdom and certain insights through "His direct, sudden grants" (P. 207). (7) "He plays a part in our acts of trying to understand Him" (p. 128). "He is not an enigma, but justice, mercy.... He is not the Unknown; He is the Father, the God of Abraham" (p. I64). He is "a father, not an absolute" (p. 126). "He is the Creator and Redeemer, Teacher and Lawgiver" (p. i6). Viewed in its entirety, this array is somewhat less than imposing. The deity's love, justice, needs, cries, chants, interests, will, are tinged not simply with impenetrable mystery "surpassing our power of com- prehension" (p. I86) and with trans-mysterious meaning (p. 194). An ineradicable streak of caprice runs through the picture, and amia- bility, at least as observable through the eyes of mortality, relates to shifting moods rather than definable principles of morality. Arbitrary, incomprehensible or supersensible hierarchies of moments, ages, persons, peoples, places, acts; sudden bursts of grants and favors; divine pathos, compassion, ecstasy-and it is hard to see why we should not also assume divine awe, wonder, amazement, and sense of the ineffable or why a community of feelings is less likely to unite God and man than a community of interests and of sacred acts-all these are doubtful consolations in the face of the obstinate reality of the un- redeemed. They fall short of mitigating the plight of uncounted millions of years and untold millions of human beings doomed to the shadow of grace. They do not still the tears of the naked who remained unclothed and unsheltered. They do not undo the tragedy of the sick who died for an abundance of "higher ignorance" and for scarcity of medical know-why-when-what-and-how. They do not account for the mourners who were not only comforted but also</page><page sequence="3">THE MYSTERY-BEN HORIN I43 created by the "ultimate subject," "father," "mercy," the "teacher" who is "impressed by goodness" in hierarchies of moments. What is callousness and abscondence (p. 132) to man, is hiding and not always being at our disposal to God. Beyond the mystery of the hierarchy of moments something be- comes visible which is neither justice nor mercy not fatherhood. There is more to "what is beyond the mystery" than what the romance of the ineffable elects to intuit. Beyond the hierarchy of chosen moments there is also the grimness of unfavored moments, ages, persons, peoples, places. There is the utter defenselessness of cis-glorial human beings whose years happen to fall into the hapless intervals between "mo- ments." The unpredictable spur-of-the-moment, parsimonious blasts of grants, mercy, love, interest, choice, justice are enveloped in long, loathsome, lean inter-moments which are governed by an economy of grace-scarcity, produced by either omnipotence or omnimpotence.22a These negative grants bespeak a divine "rugged individualism" lurking behind our author's sketch of the "ultimate subject," a free- dom for irresponsibility which amazementalism seeks to conceal behind this verbal cloud: "To assume that the world for all its immense grandeur is a little cymbal in the hand of God, on which at certain times only one soul vibrates though all are struck; in other words: to assume that the entire complex of natural laws is transcended by the freedom of God, would presuppose the metaphysical understanding that the laws of nature are derived not from blind necessity but from freedom, that the ultimate is not fate but God" (p. 211). Clearly, faithfulness to "moments" or "certain times" or "freedom" of the ultimate hierarchical regions is the concomitant of faithlessness with the lower estates, and free men must beware of a "freedom" which stands as a pseudonym for what may be called the dictatorship of the ultimatariat. There is an ominous ring to mystifications such as these: "Freedom means that man is capable of expressing himself in events beyond his being involved in the natural processes of living.... Man's ability to transcend the self, to rise above all natural ties and bonds, presupposes ... his belonging to a dimension that is higher than nature, society, and the self, and accepts the reality of such a dimension beyond the natural order" (pp. 4iof.; italics mine, M. B.-H.). The memory of those who in history's most recent "eclipse of grace" passed on beyond 22a See my "A Note on Faith," The Reconstructionist, vol. xxv, no. i i, October 2, 1959.-A statement on the Wrath of Yahweh, opy?] Oeo5, ira deorum, appears in Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy, ch. iv.

Selectivity, choice, preference are at the heart of moral conduct. By the same token, they are present in immoral conduct. It is the kind of choice-a choice of choices-that distinguishes one from the other. Hierarchy per se is neither divine nor normal. Neither "natural" nor "divine" selection, neither Darwinian nor a "super-Darwinian" type of "survival of the fittest," neither atmospheric-geographic con- ditions nor theo-esthetic or theo-axiologic inclinations will absolve mere humans from establishing and following principles of preferred conduct befitting their own most valid insights, possibilities, and pur- poses.23 They may come to favor a morality fitting all for survival or for self-fulfilment or salvation. They may learn to "choose" the chosen and the unchosen and to provide opportunities for all to achieve a life of human dignity, responsibility, and freedom through free inquiry, artistic expression, and the application of extra-human energies to the protection and promotion of living in the natural order. V Just as with fundamental probing the neo-mystical speculative structure about God, the world, man, and intelligence collapses in debris of contradiction and vacuity, so does its dialectic vanish into myth when exposed to basic challenge. This dialectic is one of seemingly naturalistic assertion, apparently pragmatic presupposition, ostensibly progressive and reconstructive principles. Closer examination, how- ever, reveals that these experimentalist allusions are traffic signals set to create immense congestion.24 23 For an orthodox and an existentialist defense of Israel's chosen- ness see Isidore Epstein, The Faith of Judaism (London: Soncino, I954), ch. xiv and Will Herberg, "The 'Chosenness' of Israel and the Jew of Today," Midstream, New York, vol. i, no. i, Autumn, I955, pp. 83-9I. Chosenness is critically examined by Mordecai M. Kaplan in The Future of the American Jew (New York: Macmillan, 1948), ch. xiii. See olso Karl Jaspers, The Origin and Goal of History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1953), pp. 19 f. 24 "...There are many religionists who are now dissatisfied with the older 'proofs' of the existence of God, those that go by the name of ontological, cosmological and teleological. The cause of the dissatis- faction is perhaps not so much the arguments that Kant used to show the insufficiency of these alleged proofs, as it is the growing feeling that they are too formal to offer any support to religion in action ... More- over, these religionists are moved by the rise of the experimental method</page><page sequence="5">THE MYSTERY-BEN HORIN 145 (i) Sacred acts and events rather than abstract ideas (pp. 213, 21, 130); experience (even of inexperience) rather than sheer symbolic thought; verification of the abstract in the concrete, historical situa- tion rather than timeless messages (p. 204); tools, instruments, deeds, the oneness of deed and thought (p. 296); the transformation of man (p. 3 II); "even evil should not be idolized but instrumentalized" (p. 415); "we should be pioneers as were our fathers three thousand years ago" (p. 424)-all these fundamentals of pragmatism are adduced to provide convincing authority for a position as remote from pragma- tism as is "consent of the governed" from the Fiihrerprinzip. The difficulty is that pragmatism does not readily lend itself to the performance of such functions. Meta-pragmatism does not work. "There are no sublime facts; there are only divine acts" (p. 40). If so, however, man's intelligence is a divine act, and it must be asked why one divine act should be beyond others and why the divine act of human comprehension should be, as Heschel has it, incompatible with the mysterious essence of subhuman creatures and things. Such a conclusion would markedly retard rather than accelerate the advance of amazementalism. (2) Heschel is concerned to re-reify the Deity, to re-personalize God, to de-idealize Him, to breathe into the Ultimate's nostrils the breath of life and humanity. He quotes Maimonides' injunction against in other fields. What is more natural and proper, accordingly, than that they should affirm they are just as good empiricists as anybody else- indeed, as good as the scientists themselves ? As the latter rely upon certain kinds of experience to prove the existence of certain kinds of objects, so the religionists rely upon a certain kind of experience to prove the existence of the object of religion... God" (John Dewey, A Common Faith, p. ii). -It may be pointed out here in passing that on p. I 8 Heschel quotes these words from A Common Faith: Rationalism 'precludes religious faith in any distinctive sense. It allows only for a belief that is unimpeachable rational inference from what we absolutely know.' This writer's perusal of the book failed in locating these words, and Dr. Heschel's own footnote on p. 23 does not give the page number. The fact is that, contrary to Heschel's insinuation, Dewey in A Common Faith advocates a religious faith (p. 87) in God which is the "active relation between ideal and actual," (p. 5I) a union of ideal ends with actual conditions. - J. Hutton Hynd, writing on "Mysti- cism and Ethics" in Stiernotte's already cited book Mysticism and the Modern Mind, goes as far as to suggest that Felix Adler in his Religion of Duty and An Ethical Philosophy of Life "and John Dewey in A Common Faith, approach the precincts of an ethical and truly religious mysticism, and even enter the precincts and bid others enter, open-eyed and erect, with all the ordinary 'senses and intellectual ope- rations at their highest pitch of discipline' " (p. 96).</page><page sequence="6">I46 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW anthropomorphism and rejects thinking of prophecy as a psycho- physical act (pp. i87f.). A moment later, however, he expounds what a sort of "depth-anthropomorphism": "What we see may be an illusion; that we see can never be questioned. The thunder and light- ning at Sinai may have been merely an impression; but to have sudden- ly been endowed with the power of seeing the whole world struck with an overwhelming awe of God was a new sort of perception" (p. I96). Yet the distinction between the act of seeing and the act of seeing something25 is spurious: we either see something or we do not see. To see "the whole world struck" etc. in "a new sort of perception" is depth-seeing or super-seeing, involving receiving and interpreting impressions of environmental occurrences. Hence, to have seen "the whole world struck with an overwhelming awe of God" may have been no less an illusion than the mere impression of thunder and lightning. Surely, seeing (a) "the whole world," (b) seeing it "struck with awe," (c) seeing it struck "with an overwhelming awe of God" is seeing a triple what, and-in Heschel's own admission-whats are notoriously illusory, as may be all interpretations of common sense and uncommon sense impressions. The whats derived from "a response of the whole person to the mystery and transcendence of living" (p. II4) or "from our inability to experience what is given to our mind" (p. II7) or from "our goal ... to ascertain the existence of a Being to whom we may confess our sins, of a God who loves, of a God who is not above concern with our inquiry and search for Him; a father, not an absolute" (p. I26)- these "whats" are anthropomorphic and illusory. What if not "a response of the whole person to the mystery and transcendence of living" was it when God advised Moses to cast the rod on the ground which turned into a serpent and to take the serpent by the tail whereby it became a rod-"that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee" (Exodus 4.2-5) ? 25 Elsewhere he writes: "We are free to choose between good and evil; we are not free in having to choose" (p. 4I2). This is in support of the contention that "from the viewpoint of naturalism, human freedom is an illusion. If all facts in the physical universe and hence also in human history are absolutely dependent upon and conditioned by causes, then man is a prisoner of circumstances" (p. 410). Heschel errs twice: Naturalism does not reduce human history, which includes thought and culture, to the physical-chemical aspect of the universe. Nor does naturalism postulate absolute dependence etc. Hence it need not advocate absolute independence of the physical universe which is not freedom but death. Naturalistic freedom is of both circum- stances and ideals.</page><page sequence="7">THE MYSTERY-BEN HORIN 147 There is little advance in essentials in this neo-mystical effort to undergird belief with a demonstration such as this: "I do not experience what is given to my mind-hence, He experiences me. I do not know Him-hence, He knows me. He is beyond me-hence, my Beyond is He." The point is that the anthropomorphic and anthropopathic26 fallacy is committed in ascribing to God not only features and functions derived from primitive natural science and study of man but in associating with Him patterns of conduct made intelligible by depth-psychology, sociology, history, and twentieth-century physical science. To describe God in terms of "total response" and "whole person," to regard Him as super-sonic and super-photic, as the meta-pragmatist and meta- experimentalist, the meta-ecstatic and meta-mvstic Co-Worker, Co- Father, Co-Judge, Co-Revealer of Law and Literature-is to resurrect anthropomorphic myths, is to propose a recrudenscence of faith. Its error lies not in riveting to supernatural Being qualities of self- social man. Its error lies in the allegation of extraordinariness to ordinary events. It lies in the imposition of arbitrary, "ultimate" dis- order upon the order of our relative disorder of being. Its error lies in the failure to concede that 7ve are human and nothing human is "beyond" us or from "beyond" us. To eliminate naive or sophisticated anthropomorphism from religion and to transpose religion from supernaturalist into ethical faith is to liberate man's sense of interdependence with his fellow men, with the concrete actualities of earth and universe, and with the ideal possi- bilities inherent in his powers to transform realities into values. (3) In Heschel's system, experience itself, time, history, and points in history, become infused, drenched, charged with divinity. Thus they function as immediate evidence, not for the reality of experience, time and history and historical moments, but as evidence for the realness of a deity which is claimed to be both in and not of these. In this fashion the man-experiencing God generates a God-experiencing man, and the same experience called revelation "proves" the former as it overwhelms the latter. This, then, is the heart and the method of pseudo-pragmatic valida- tion or the complete act of unthought: First, human historical experience, the inescapable starting point of all our affairs, is compounded, by un- historical interpretation, into an experience-interpretation continuum. Second, the interpreted experience is glorified and beyond-the-glory- fied. Third, the trans-enigmatic, super-ineffable, deity thus introduced is further experienced-interpreted as capable of "at least" human 26 See Louis Ginzberg, "Anthropomorphism and Anthropopathism", The Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. i, pp. 62I-625.</page><page sequence="8">I48 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW experiencing, acting, willing, choosing. Fourth, divine experiencing of man and like man is presented as evidence for man experiencing "almost like" God and of God. Fifth, God's experience is now inter- preted-experienced as prior and superior to human experience: "God's relation to man precedes man's relation to God" (p. I98). Henceforth Search is in search of searching, Possession owns the possessed, Need needs the needy, and Vision voices a numberless One.27 The pragmatist would agree that "there is no perception that may not be suspected of being a delusion." He would reject, however, the pseudo-pragmatic conclusion: "But there are perceptions which are so staggering as to render meaningless the raising of such a suspicion" (p. I96). His own conclusion would rather be that there are perceptions which are so staggering as to produce staggering delusions and as to require equally staggering doubts. The most amazing conclusion, far from being exempt from any evidence, rather requires the most painstaking validation. To equate proof with the shattering of all proofs is extravagant. Such "shattering" in itself may not be shatter-proof. Heschel's deity sings, chants, thinks (p. I60), hides, seeks, searches, grants, chooses, needs, mates, experiences, goes into ecstasy (p. I99), has pathos and initiative (p. I98), co-reveals, co-authors the Bible (pp. 260, 265), apparently even makes "realistic compromises" with the moral condition of ancient man (p. 27). Granted that as human beings, "we are born to be an answer to His question" (p. 4I6). But He awaits to be re-born in thought, not stagger. Men are no answer to a deity so poorly conceived. It should be clear beyond doubt that this criticism is not grounded in the belief that God is an illusion but rather in the belief that an illusion is here presented as God. The neo-mystical deity is less than divine. (4) The Ultimate itself is ultimate act: "This is the premise of faith: Spiritual events are real. Ultimately all creative events are caused by spiritual acts.... Either God is but a word not designating anything real or He is at least as real as the man I see in front of me" (pp. I42f.). This is, indeed, one part of pragmatic teachings: Spiritual acts are real. Ideas are as real and natural as are mineral, flowers, quadrupeds, 27 Lao Tze, presumably responding to the mystery with his whole person, put it this way: "The Portal of God is non-existence. All things sprang from non-existence. Existence could not make existence existence. It must have proceeded from non-existence, and non- existence and nothing are ONE" (Quoted from Robert 0. Ballou et al., editors, The Bible of the World [New York: Viking, 19391 P. 557).</page><page sequence="9">THE MYSTERY-BEN HORIN I49 bipeds. The thought of a stone is a real as the stone itself. However, pragmatism does not skid into the "amazemental" error to propose that, since thought is real like stones, stones-or the universe of physics and chemistry-are thoughts-in-disguise or allusion (p. io6) or "God's house" (p. 40), and that to penetrate the disguise is to become aware not of the thought of the stone but (a) of the ineffable or glory or mystery and (b) of love, mercy, the Father. To the ex- perimentalist, the sacred deed is sacred deed without being "the divine in disguise" (p. 312). To him, creation is not revealed "in disguise" (p. 58), history is not "the supreme witness for God" (p. 206), and time is not "eternity in disguise"28 or "but a little lower than eternity" (p. 206). Our questions about the stone, the universe, the divine, are not "answers in disguise" (p. I32). In fact, to the pragmatist, mystery is real and he knows that "everything holds the great secret" (p. 57). But he does not proceed to "pray the world's cry, the world's sigh" (p. I40).29 Rather, he rises to use that aspect of "all being... involved in the infinite mystery" (p. 57) called-science. He does not stop to be radically amazed at all facts and the very fact of thought but goes on to investigate, classify, organize and reorganize the mysteries around him so as to alleviate some of the mysterious effects of the mysteries. The experimentalist sees no need to deny mystery, nor does he fail to see it. The difference between him and the mystic, however, is that 28 Abraham J. Heschel, The Sabbath (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Young, I95I), p. ioi. - The idea that x is y in disguise is specious. Dewey in Creative Intelligence (New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., I9I7), p. I2, wrote: "To treat misery as anything but misery, as for example a blessing in disguise or a necessary factor in good, is disengenuous apologetics." Professor Boyd Henry Bode (How We Learn [Boston, D. C. Heath &amp; Co., I940], p. 202), discussing the fallacy involved in identifying continuity with identity, said: . . the assertion that colors and sounds are connected with motion is far from saying that colors and sounds do not exist at all. We might as well say that, since there can be no husband unless there is a wife, all husbands are really wives in disguise." 29 Paul Tillich (The New Being [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I955] p. I38) quotes Romans 8.26-27, "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words," and makes this comment: "The essence of prayer is the act of God who is working in us and raises our whole being to Himself. The way in which this happens is called by Paul 'sighing.' Sighing is an expression of the weakness of our creaturely existence. Only in terms of wordless sighs can we approach God, and even these sighs are His word in us."

God, to him, is the totality of cosmic powers, including those of love, reflection, ecstasy, and sense of reverence and mystery, by virtue of which man, himself a mystery, can render his mysterious life more humanly livable in the midst of incomprehended mysteries. The ex- perimentallist is persuaded that if all reality is mystery, including ourselves, we are attuned to all reality, mystery of its mystery, enigma of its enigma. Cheerful rather than sighful, he would proclaim: "All things are equally mysterious, only some are more so than others,30 and some may become less so than others. Mystery is the world's, revelation is the mind's." To him, "radical amazement"-"the per- petual surprise at the fact that there are facts at all" (p. 45)-is mystery as the infant's first look at a new toy. Mystery as mature man must transform ever new realms of outer mystery into-homes. Science, then, is a way of applying mystery to mystery so as to make it work to combat death, hunger, ignorance, superstition, and mysticism-that mysticism which is not "consciousness of illumination" (W. James) 30 "It would seem rather strange," writes Professor Harry A. Wolf- son, "that the Fathers, with all their belief in a God whose nature and whose actions are incomprehensible and in a world which had come into existence and is still governed by a power which is unlimited and by a will which is inscrutable, should single out these three beliefs [connected with the generation of the Logos, the conception of the triune God, and the incarnation] as special mysteries. There would seem to be no more mystery about the belief in the generation of the Logos than in the belief in the creation of the world; nor would there seem to be more mystery about the belief in one God who is three than in the belief in mutable actions proceeding from a God who is immu- table; nor, again, would there seem to be more mystery in the belief that the Logos was made flesh than in the belief that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam a breath of life. If, despite all this, the Fathers describe these three beliefs as mysteries, it must be because they considered these three beliefs to be unique even among all kinds of beliefs in things miraculous and mysterious." (The Philosophy of the Church Fathers [Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, I956], vol. I, pp. 287-288). The answer to the first problem is this: "The pre-existent Christ who is called the Son of God, and is himself a God, is generated from God indeed after the analogy of animal pro- creation, but it is unlike animal procreation; it is a unique kind of generation, the generation of an incorporeal being from another in- corporeal being, and since it is a unique procreation it constitutes a mystery." (Ibid., p. 295).</page><page sequence="11">THE MYSTERY-BEN HORIN I5I but elimination of consciousness or "utter deadening of the soul to the things of the world" (Saint Theresa). As Bertrand Russell has it, "Science is at no moment quite right, but it is seldom quite wrong, and has, as a rule, a better chance of being right than the theories of the unscientific. It is, therefore, rational to accept it hypothetically." 30a (5) "The world is itself hiddenness; it is a mystery" (p. 58). But the mystery is pre-creational. Nature, accordingly, is supernatural. It follows that we, as part of nature or supernature, live in the super- natural, are supernatural. "Nature," the world of ordinary experience apparently waits to be created, waits for its meta-history to come to a close. The act of creating it, then, seems to be left to man: the mysteri- ous, supernatural, not-yet-created, is called upon to create nature or "neo-nature," the world with intelligible meaning. The New Being is yet to come, and the mystery of man's mind, I suggest, is to be its maker. Instead of merely adoring a hiding God (pp. 28, 6i) and em- bracing hidolatry,31 we must act as agents of the world's creative urge. VI What is the distinctively Jewish and what is the nature of Judaism that emerges from our author's "philosophy of Judaism" ? (i) The Jewish people: "Israel remains the mate of God" (p. 424) and "Judaism is God's quest for man" (p. 425). "We have not chosen God; He has chosen us" (p. 425). "We are born to be an answer to His question" (p. 4I6). (2) Jewish history: "Out of the wonder we came and into the wonder we shall return" (p. 424) .32 "Jewish history has been a revelation of Israel's holiness to God" (p. 255). 30a Bertrand Russell, My Philosophical Development (New York: Simon and Schuster, I959), p. I7. 31 "I hide, therefore I am"-would have to stand as part of the "pseudo-pragmatic" proof of the realness of God.-Hidolatry is the worship of good and good in disguise or evil or supergood; mercy and brutality or brutality in disguise or hidden mercy. Cf. Meir Ben-Horin, "Martin Buber's 'Absolute Personality'," Judaism, New York, vol. 6, no. i, Winter I957, for a discussion of the "Supergood" and "the Absolute" in Buber's writings. 32 One must ask: Is human existence less wondrous than Jewish existence?

"One of the cardinal premises" of the Jewish "{way of thinking" is: "The source of truth is found... in unique events that happened at particular moments in history" (p. I97). "We believe that the Jew is committed to a divine law; that the ultimate standards are beyond man rather than within man. We believe that there is a law, the essence of which is derived from prophetic events, and the interpretation of which is in the hands of the sages" (p. 299). (6) Judaism: "Judaism is a link to eternity, kinship with ultimate reality" (p. 422). "We are a challenge to the sovereignty of any one value: whether it be the ego, the state, nature, or beauty.... Nothing is deified: neither power nor wisdom, neither heroes nor institutions. To ascribe divine qualities to all of these, to anything, sublime and lofty as it may be, is to distort the idea it represents and the concept of the divine which we bestow upon it" (p. 4I5). "To celebrate the Sabbath [expressing what is most characteristic of Judaism] is to express one's ultimate independence of civilization and society, of achievement and anxiety" (p. 4I7). "Judaism is the art of surpassing civilization, sanctification of time, sanctification of history" (p. 4I8). From this "sleet and hail of verbal imprecisions" (to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot's "The Rock"), these basic assumptions emerge: First, the State of Israel, Jewish statehood in our time, concern for Judaism's functioning as a majority civilization in its own country, problems relating to Jewish status outside of Israel, problems relating to Jewry as a political, economic, social, educational, and religious unit within the unity or disunity of nations are matters not treated in our author's "philosophy of Judaism." The State of Israel itself is not mentioned. Second, with the de-naturalization of Jewry and Judaism, with the remystification of Jewish history, literature, and religion, and with the attempt at retro-constructing Jewish life through mysticism, goes the de-Zionization of the Jewish community. If Zionism is the return of Judaism from its pre-occupation with the super-natural, neo-mysticism or amazementalism is the retreat from Zionist autoemancipation in Old-New Land to auto-exilism in No- Time Land. It is profoundly un-Zionist and anti-Zionist. It is "higher Galutism."</page><page sequence="13">THE MYSTERY-BEN HORIN I53 Third, Heschel's Judaism is basically undemocratic. He leaves no doubt about his conviction that "the sages" were, are, and should be the final arbiters of the law or the Jewish way of living, feeling, thinking. Unable to propose a prophetocracy, he clearly favors a rabbinocratic order, or a zaddikocracy, inspired and bound by Scrip- ture and its traditional exegesis. Thus God in search of man is church in search of control. To Heschel, Israel is a people of witnesses to events, not a people of originators of events. And since events, acts, being divine, carry their own divine meanings and interpretations, Israel is to be regarded as a people of witnesses to events and their inter- pretations and to interpretations which in themselves are events. Anchored to eternity, Israel is forever commissioned to sanctify history, civilization, society while remaining ultimately independent of them, forever challenging the sovereignty of any one of them as well as those of ego, state, nature, beauty, power, wisdom, heroism, -forever remaining counter-civilizational. To paraphrase Heschel himself: There are perceptions which are so staggering as to render meaningless the raising of a suspicion that they may be delusions. For if they are anything else, we indeed are not on earth, our sister (p. Ig2)33 but in wonder, our heretofore and our hereafter, but neither here nor now.34 'Where else, it must be asked, should we be able to furnish and produce sanctity to the hundreds of millions of votaries of Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, not to speak of the nationalists, the socialists, the adherents of democracy? Surely, men like Moses, Samuel, Nathan, Elijah, Amos, Micah, Isaiah, Jeremiah were not mentally deranged (p. 223). But what of Buddha (ca. 563-483 B.C.E.), of Confucius (55I-479 B.C.E.), of Lao Tze (604-ca. 5i8), of Zarathustra (ca. 570-520[?]), contemporaries of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel? What of the founders, visionaries, mystics of Christianity and Islam? Shall we presume, in the name of the biblical "inability to say more than Th-us saith the Lord" (p. 232), to surpass in sanctity all saints? This in itself would be rather unsaintly. Shall we be serious about assuming that God is present in Israel's scriptures only and not in other scrip- 33 The Torah is our mother and our life (p. 275). 34 Commenting on Genesis I.2, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch writes that the root of the word tohu (unformed, void, chaotic) appears again in Rabbinic Hebrew where it means "to wonder at," as in Baba Kama I I2: "Tahi Rabbi Yohanan," Rabbi Yohanan wondered at. (From S. R. Hirsch's Torah Commentary in Fundamentals of Judaism [Jacob Breuer, editor], New York, The Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch So- ciety, I949, pp. I3-I4).-In the context of the present paper this would suggest that to "wonder" is to invoke primordial chaos.</page><page sequence="14">154 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tures ? Jews will not and should not claim a sovereignty to challenge all values and all civilizations, any more than any other ethnic group on earth.35 Not ordinary men and women, but wondrous answers-to- God and questions-in the-flesh may do so. Heschel apparently speaks not just of Israel that stands above all civilization but of an Israel Eternal or Co-Eternal that stands above contemporary Israel. In short, Heschel's Israel and Judaism are figments of amazemental awe, wonder, higher ignorance, and-as a matter of fact,-of higher arrogance. William James's observation is relevant to this point: "To come from thence is no infallible credential. What comes must be sifted and tested, and run the gauntlet of confrontation with the total context of experience, just like what comes from the outer world of sense. Its value must be ascertained by empirical methods, so long as we are not mystics ourselves."38 Far from aspiring to a super-civilizational independence,37 Israel on earth must endeavor to strengthen the bonds of its international and intercultural interdependence. The Jewish State's Declaration of Independence is in fact a declaration of interdependence. It speaks of The State of Israel as one which would "endow the Jewish people with equality of status among the family of nations" and appeals "to the United Nations to... admit Israel into the family of nations." For in the modern world to be fully independent is to be cast out from the mutual responsibility of mankind, to be universally unwanted, un- needed, utterly superfluous. It is to be ready for annihilation. Or in our author's own language: "We must first peer into the darkness, feel strangled and entombed in the hopelessness of living without God, before we are ready to feel the presence of His living light" (p. I40). Our generation which has in fact peered into the darkness, has felt strangled and has been strangled, has felt entombed and has been entombed, is abundantly saturated with the experience. We are ready "to feel the presence of His living light" by staking our lives against a resurgence of mystical diabolics38 and, at the same time, by being what Theodor Herzl called "Servants of the Light." In his recent book The Role of Knowledge in Western Religion, Pro- fessor John Herman Randall, Jr., inquires into the place in our present- 3 For a similar view cf.

His epilogue which follows upon one of the most penetrating chapters on "Know- ledge, Intelligence, and Religious Symbols" currently aVailable to the student of contemporary religion culminates in the call "to clarify through intelligence the values to which we are actually consecrated" and in the declaration that "in that process we may even hope to extend and enlarge and deepen our vision of the Divine." None of the writings of the neo-mystics should be read without keeping in mind these lines from Randall's "Apologia pro Theologia Rationali": In the desire to regain for religion something of its lost power as a social bond, it is doubtless natural to try by subordinating intellectual values to make it as primitive as possible. Students of religion might well view with great approbation the success of our modern American religion in approaching such primitive mindlessness. If human morality and human reason are nothing in the face of the Eternal Judge, or of the Unconditioned, it is hardly surprising that if religion be taken as a crusade, it should be a crusade with little morality or reason in it. If the Christians in Germany had known God better, and had not come to despise thinking, I wonder whether it would have been quite so easy for "German Christians" to think of Hitler as his incarnation. If we had not insisted so strongly that theology is mythology, and must not try to be literally true, I wonder whether there would have been found such ready acceptance for the "myth of the twentieth century," whose chief claim to our attention was its complete lack of truth. If theology be not science, but a religious technique for expressing deeply felt emotion, if God be not the object toward which the religious life is directed, to be clarified by reflection, but part of its apparatus, to be used by that emotion, there can really be little objection if in Germany -and nearer home-theology and God have been patently used to organize popular hysteria with a perfection of technique.39 Solomon Schechter, in his celebrated lecture on Abraham Lincoln's religious mysticism, warned against the serious defects of its quality: "For, the superabundance of zeal and extravagant enthusiasm such as often accompany religious mysticism may, as experience teaches, very easily degenerate into fanaticism and lawlessness, brushing aside all legal restrains and occasionally ignoring even all human conside- rations. "40 From these Lincoln was preserved by his legal training and by his "divine humor." 39 John Hermann Randall, Jr., The Role of Knowledge in Western Religion (Boston: Starr King Press, I958), pp. I38-39. 40 Solomon Schechter, Seminary Addresses and Other Papers (New York: Burning Bush Press, I959), pp. I57-I58.-Some Spanish mystics taught that works of charity were to be avoided.

No founded critique of the ways of men with nature, with other men, and with the promise inherent in the universe will be unwelcome to the free mind who is in earnest about "what the Lord doth require of thee." No forms of experiencing and knowing the world-scientific, artistic, religious-will be alien to him. But he will take his stand with the proposition that to declare the obsolescence of the human mind is an act of idolatry. He will remember that an American President restored social, economic, and moral health with the ringing phrase, "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." And he will ask this question: In the current mood of neo- orthodoxy and neo-mysticism-are we to say, in the spirit of "awe, wonder, and mystery" -that we have nothing to fear but fearlessness ? Nothing to fear but-courage ?

We shall not reiterate here that the scrolls could not have been written by the Essenes nor by any other group before the destruction of the Second Temple. We shall endeavor to demonstrate that those who assign the scrolls to an early period do so because they prefer that they be of an early period.
