<plain_text><page sequence="1">HANS REICHENBACH: The Rise of Scientific Philosophy. xi + 333 pp. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, I95'. $3.75. In the concluding sentence of the Preface Professor Reichenbach states: "This book is meant to inquire into the roots of philosophical error and to present the evidence that philoso- phy has risen from error to truth." In a meas- ure, the spirit of this sentence sets the tone for the whole book and for its didacticism. The book, which is intended as "an introduc- tion to philosophy," is divided into two parts: "The Roots of Speculative Philosophy" and "The Results of Scientific Philosophy," respec- tively. As might be excpected, the first part is critical and negative throughout; the second is completely laudatory and affirmative. The execution of the whole, however, is uneven and, for the most part, assertive rather than eviden- tial. At times, elementary and obvious matters are discussed at great length, whereas crucial points are passed over with relative unconcern. The central issues of the critical first part include the repudiation of Kant and Hume. According to Professor Reichenbach, Kant's sys- tem "represents the last great construction of a rationalist philosophy" (p. 40); and, again according to Professor Reichenbach, the crux of all rationalism is "the search for certainty" (p. 32), its method nothing but deduction from premises which are regarded as absolutely * An extensive review of the Readings was published by E. G. Boring in Psych. Bull., I949, 46, pp. 57-63. certain (pp. 27-28). A truer reading of Kant, however, does not place him in the rationalist tradition proper, and his search for the grounds upon which the certainties of mathematics and Newtonian physics might be justified is hardly a matter of deduction. It is, rather, an analysis of the conditions which make experience of a certain kind possible. That Kant's conception of the "synthetic a priori" is untenable in view of modern developments in mathematics and physics is no argument to the contrary. But when Professor Reichenbach asserts that "the unwarranted assumption of Kant's system," "the undemonstrable premise on which his sys- tem hinges," is "the postulate that experience in the frame of the a-priori principles must al- ways be possible" (p. 48), he attributes to Kant a thesis which the latter never held; for to hold, as Kant did, that whenever there is experience of a certain type, it must conform to specifiable a-priori conditions, is not the same as to hold that experience of the type in question must always be possible. Because of this difference in basic contention it may well be false to assert, as Professor Reichenbach does, that Kant's "philosophy has nothing to say to us who are witnesses of the physics of Einstein and Bohr" (P. 44). Of Hume Professor Reichenbach says that "he [Hume] arrives at the result that all knowl- edge is either analytic or derived from experi- ence: mathematics and logic are analytic, all synthetic knowledge is derived from experience" (p. 86). All synthetic knowledge, furthermore, is derived from sense perception and, according to this interpretation, "scientific inference has the form of induction by enumeration" (p. 85). Such induction, however, far from being the core of "mathematical physics" (p. 85), can itself not be justified by reference to experience (p. 88). According to Professor Reichenbach, therefore, the Humean empiricist faces this dilemma: "Either he is a radical empiricist and admits no results other than analytic statements or statements derived from experience" (p. 88) (in which case he cannot make inductions and therefore cannot predict), "or he admits the inductive inference" (in which case he admits "a nonanalytic principle not derivable from ex- perience" and has therefore "abandoned em- piricism"). "A radical empiricism, therefore, denies the possibility of knowledge" (p. 89). At this point Professor Reichenbach faces essentially the same question with which Kant was concerned. "We ask," he says, "what must be the nature of knowledge of the future if statements about the future are to be justifiable" (p. 92)? Since any theory of "probable knowl- edge" is in principle "subject to a criticism similar to the one raised by Hume for a knowl- edge that claims certainty" (p. 94), Professor Reichenbach expects no help from this side. The solution, he believes, can be found only in the "hypothetico-deductive method" (p. Ioo)</page><page sequence="2">278 Book Reviews of modern science. I regret that I find in Pro- fessor Reichenbach's book no convincing argu- ment establishing his contention that his own solution is immune to the Humean criticism. When Professor Reichenbach says (p. 242): "We find a certain relative frequency for a series of observed events and assume that the same frequency will hold approximately for further continuation of the series," he is af- firming in all essentials Mill's principle of the uniformity of nature -a principle which is most assuredly subject to Hume's criticism. There are many other important and interest- ing points in Professor Reichenbach's book which invite comment. Space limitations, how- ever, make a detailed discussion impossible. I have in mind, for example, Professor Reichen- bach's idea of a "normal system" (pp. I34-I37) and the use he makes of it in connection with the interpretation of space (p. I37) and of the physical world (pp. i8o-i86). An examination of Professor Reichenbach's interrelation of the confirmation of hypotheses (which he calls "in- ductive inference") and probability theory (chapter 14) might be rewarding; and so would be a detailed analysis of his "functional con- ception of knowledge" (chapter i6). But the ideas which Professor Reichenbach sets forth here are in all essentials the same which he pre- sented at greater length in his earlier book, Experience and Prediction (Chicago, I938). A full discussion of Professor Reichenbach's basic ethical principle ["Everybody is entitled to set up his own moral imperatives and to demand that everyone follow these imperatives" (p. 295)] and its implications ["We try to pursue our own volitional ends . . . with the firmness of the man who trusts in his own will" (p. 30I)] would also be important but must be foregone at this time. In conclusion, one or two points of historical accuracy may be raised. Professor Reichenbach contends that "the decisive turn to modem scientific thought, emancipating it from the anthropomorphism of earlier periods," came with Copernicus; and that "Galileo gave to modern science the quantitative experimental method" (p. 98). It is true, of course, that we usually date the development of modern science from the time of Galileo; but the Copernican innovation would have remained a passing event of no particular consequence had it not been for Galileo's telescope and Kepler's persistent efforts to adjust the heliocentric scheme to the facts of observation. It was not Gassendi's ex- periment that cleared the way for Kepler. Moreover, Tycho Brahe repudiated Copernicus's views for exactly the same reason for which Hipparchus of old had repudiated the identical system developed by Aristarchus of Samos: It simply did not account for the observed plane- tary motions. Although Galileo made effective use of ex- periments, experimentation as an essential in- gredient of scientific inquiry was known to and practiced by Archimedes, Roger Bacon, Gros- seteste, and others. Even the quantitative aspect was not absent. The laws of hydrostatics, for example, could not have been discovered without reasonably accurate measurements. To ascribe, in the manner referred to above, the "decisive turn" to modern science to Copernicus and Galileo is therefore a misleading oversimplifica- tion. What was really decisive at the time was the transition from the traditional concept of substantial forms to the new concept of general laws-a transition which was well under way before Galileo appeared on the scene (although it is not really present in Copernicus's work), but which, in a sense, is metaphysical rather than methodological. It is equally misleading, I believe, to maintain, as Professor Reichenbach does, that "British empiricism mirrors the triumph of the experi- mental method in modern science, the method that addresses questions to nature and leaves it to nature to answer 'yes' or 'no'"' (p. 99). The second part of the quoted sentence is much more reminiscent of a similar statement in the Introduction to the second edition of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason than it is of anything Francis Bacon, John Locke, Bishop Berkeley, or David Hume ever wrote. The basic sensa- tionalism of the British empiricists, culminating, as Professor Reichenbach himself shows (pp. 86-94), at best in a theory of induction by enumeration, did not even understand aright the hypothetico-deductive procedures of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. Finally, Professor Reichenbach wonders why the mathematicians even in ancient times did not like the Euclidean axiom that "through a given point one and only one paraIel can be drawn with respect to a given line" (p. I27). The answer, of course, is that Euclid never formulated his fifth axiom in this way and that his own complex and cumbersome formulation presented indeed a problem. It was not until Wallace demonstrated the systemic equivalence of Euclid's formulation and our present version of the fifth postulate that the way was prepared for the development of non-Euclidean geome- tries. And, incidentally, although Gauss became convinced in I8o9 that a consistent geometry without Euclid's fifth postulate could be de- veloped, it was Joan Bolyai rather than he who, almost simultaneously with Lobachevski, de- veloped the first non-Eucidean system.
