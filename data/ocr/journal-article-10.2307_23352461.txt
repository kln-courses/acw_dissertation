The first god, the ancestor of all the rest, is the illusive Demogorgon. Described as nearly invisible, hidden by clouds and gloom, with a name too horrible to utter, Demogorgon will reappear in subsequent drama and literature, playing a decisive role in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound. This article traces the origins of Demogorgon, first to the Erichtho passage in Lucan [6.744-747], wherein there is a similarly awesome but nameless spirit. Boccaccio cited and quoted this very passage, as he did the similar passage in Statius' Thebaid [4.514-517], Boccaccio then cites Lactantius [Placidus], who has been credited with creating the name "Demogorgon," although the manuscript tradition does not bear reliable witness to the name until the twelfth century. Ultimately Demogorgon seems to derive from Plato's demiourgos, although his benign creator god underwent a severe transformation during the intervening centuries. Boccaccio seems to follow as well a second tradition derived primarily from Theodontius, himself illusive, which derives ultimately from the archaic Greek Arcadian tradition.

In Boiardo's Orlando inamorato [2.13.26-29] he represents the powerful force who controls the diabolical Morgana and Alcina, and in Ariosto's Cinque Canti [1.4.3] he governs the mighty Fairies, i.e. Fates, who meet every five years in a Himalayan Council.3 In the latter, in the words of Tobias Gregory's From Many Gods to One: Divine Action in Renaissance Epic, "...its supreme deity is not God but Demogorgon."4 In English literature Demogorgon in Spenser's Faerie Queene dwells at the opposite end of the spectrum of divine abodes, "Down in the bottome of the deepe Abysse...in dull darknesse pent" [4.2.47].5 Similarly, Milton [PL. 2.965] located "the dreaded name of Demogorgon" in the Stygian swamp as one of the demons accompanying the fallen Satan.6 And nearly five hundred years after Boccaccio's death, Shelley in the second and third acts of his Prometheus Unbound literally resurrected Demogorgon, the Gorgon of the demos, by raising him up from the depths of the earth and recasting him as humankind's liberator from the tyranny of god and religion represented by the 2 In the first prefacc of the Genealogy [GDG 1 .PI], Boccaccio tells us that his patron, King Hugh IV of Jerusalem and Cyprus, had requested that he compile a single genealogy of the pagan gods [tupis genealogiam deorum gentilium], and after eliminating such likely candidates as Jupiter [Zeus] (father of gods and men [e.g. Horn. II. 1.544: ttottip 0v5pv te 0ev te]), Ocean ("the source of the gods" [Horn. II. 14. 302: 0ev yfjVEOiv]), and Sky/Caclus/Ouranos [e.g. Hcs. Theog. 115-127], Boccaccio determined that it was Demogorgon who was the progenitor of the entire family of Greco-Roman gods. 3 "Demogorgone, che frena e regge / le Fate, e da lor forza e le ne priva" [Demogorgon, who bridles and rules / the Fairies, and bestows and removes their power]; cf. 1.30.1-2: Demogorgon, principe saggio, /del gran Consiglio. Jo Ann Cavallo, The Romance Epics of Boiardo, Ariosto, and Tasso: From Public Duty to Private Pleasure (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004) 65, describes Demogorgon as "the archen emy of the Christians and the equivalent of the devil." Tasso [Gerusalemme libérala 13.10] does not mention the name Demogorgon, thereby emphasizing his ineffability.

In contemporary popular culture's Dungeons and Dragons universe, our infamous 'Prince of Demons' is depicted as an 18-foot reptilian hermaphroditic humanoid.12 7 Shelley evoked some similar imagery of invisible and veiled supernatural cosmic spirits in his earlier collection published as Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude: And Other Poems (London: Baldwin, Craddock and Joy, 1816). But he may have derived the name Demogorgon specifically from a note by Thomas Love Peacock to his Rhododaphne, or, the Thessalian Spell, as quoted in David Perkins, ed., English Romantic Writers (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1967) 1000; for a summary of sources, sec O.

Most of the aforementioned authors do not offer a physical description at all. For instance, in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound [2.4], the scene which takes place at the "Cave of Demogorgon" begins with a description of his "veiled form." Then the aptly named goddess Panthea says, I see a mighty darkness Filling the seat of power, and rays of gloom Dart round, as light from the meridian sun, Ungazed upon and shapeless; neither limb, Nor form, nor outline; yet we feel it is A living spirit. The remainder of this study examines most of the sources, both direct and indirect, of this extraordinary spirit. This will take us through the medieval literary and mythological tradition back to ancient philosophical and theological contexts, and in the process we will observe that Demogorgon neither originat ed as nor developed into a typically anthropomorphic Greco-Roman divinity. He more closely resembled ancient Roman accounts of aniconic deities, partic ularly the Judean god, and we will observe at several points along the way that to a lesser extent the atypical primordial creator god Boccaccio identifies as Demogorgon bears a closer resemblance to the Florentine's conception of the celestial Christian god than he does to the likes of the several different euhemerized Jupiters of the Genealogy. In that Boccaccio identifies Demogorgon as the product of archaic Arcadian primitive peoples and as one of their culture heroes, we will find that some elements of Demogorgon's mythographical heritage date back to the earliest Greek poets. Far from being the result of a simple "slip of the pen," Boccaccio's Demogorgon represents a convergence of powerful and well established divine prototypes, and by using an array of unconventional Greco Roman sources while maintaining his Christian perspective, Boccaccio articulated for the first time a differential between types of ancient divinities. Boccaccio commences his Genealogy of the Pagan Gods [Genealogía deorum gentilium] with three prefaces [prohemia]. The first recounts how Boccaccio came to accept the commission from Hugo IV, King of Jerusalem and Cyprus, to produce a single genealogy of the pagan gods. The second then aims to discover "Who Was Regarded as First Among the Pagan Gods."13 Here Boccaccio reviews several accounts of the ancients who attempted to identify the first pagan divinity, but in his preliminary summary he reaffirms (as he frequently does in the treatise) his own belief in the Christian god by observing that even ancient theologians and philoso phers in their differing beliefs recognized: [1.P2.2] 13 "Quisprimus apudgentiles deus habitus sit?" £) Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int class trad (2012) 19:31-62 35 They offered the most worthy evidence of every truth, authoritatively asserting that there is one god whom no one ever sees, the true God, without beginning or end, omnipotent, the father and the creator of everything visible and invisible to us.'4 At the outset, therefore, Boccaccio makes it clear that in his own conception the Christian god is not seen by humans and is therefore either non-anthropomorphic or pointlessly anthropomorphic; he is the creator of all; and he is for all intents and purposes nameless in the sense that "God" is an honorific title, a job description, or a characteristically futile but noble human attempt at anthropomorphizing a concept, spirit, or being of greater than human capacity by using that word, particularly capitalized, to address it.15 This is a theological literary conceit developed by Augustine, who compared the Christian god to Platonic, Stoic, and Olympian con ceptions.16 Similarly, Boccaccio in the Genealogy [2.2.8] compares Jupiter and the Christian god: In this way [Jupiter] was elevated until he was reckoned as the greatest and a true god by even the more prudent men, and not undeservedly: to him alone was such an excellent name fitting, and, considering its significance, a Christian might not find it so dreadful if it had not been invented by pagans.17 Elsewhere Boccaccio [Expositions on Dante's Comedy, 2.1itl9] describes Jupiter as the equivalent of "god the father." Demogorgon shares many of these features. As an author Boccaccio continues with the fiction that he has learned who was thought to be the first among the pagan gods by conjuring up images of the Ionian natural philosophers Thales and Anaximenes as well as the Stoic Chrysippus. These three ancient Greeks represent ancient advocates of equally aniconic primordial elements, i.e. water, air, and fire, respectively. But as a scholar Boccaccio is drawing on such sources as Augustine, Cicero, Macrobius, and Theodontius to demonstrate the failed candidacy of all the usual suspects—water, earth, air, the sun, the ocean, Ether, and the sky. Interestingly, he omits Hesiod's Chaos from this list. We will return to Chaos later, but it will suffice here to point out that Boccaccio will indirectly make much use of the Hesiod-like, archaic literary tradition in providing Demogor gon with a female divinity by whom he could create the entirety of a single pagan divine lineage. He finally focuses on Demogorgon: [1P2.14]: Those who make the earth the mother of all things, as Theodontius maintains, prefer to name the divine mind intermingled with it Demogorgon.18 14 "cuiuscunque tarnen veritatis fidedignissimos testes, gravitate asserentes sua Deum unicum esse, quem nemo vidit unquam, et hunc verum esse principio fineque carentem, potentem omnia, rerum patrem atque creatorem tarn patentium quam non patentium nobis. " 15 Boccaccio frequently uses a relative construction, e.g. ille...qui ("he...who") [2.P.2], as a substitute. 16 E.g. De consensus evangelistarum 1.31. 17 "Adeoque in sublime conscendit, ut a prudentioribus etiam summo et vero deo ascriberetur, nec immerito; ipsi quippe soli tam egregium competit nomen, quod nec abhorreret Christianus considerato nominis significato nisi gentilium fuisset inventum." 18 "Qui autem terram rerum omnium productricem voluere, ut Theodontius dicit, inmixtam illi divinam mentem Demogorgonem nuncupavere." Springer</page><page sequence="6">36 Int class trad (2012) 19:31-62 This recalls the Stoic concept of the divine mind, Boccaccio's most likely source for which would have been Cicero's De natura deorum}9 He cites Cicero's treatise as a primary source in dozens of the Genealogy's entries, and there in the first book Cicero himself conjures up a philosopher, in this instance the Epicurean Gaius Velleius, to criticize Platonic and Stoic doctrine, immediately dismissing "the world's artificer and builder god of Plato's Timaeus" and "the old woman prophetess Pronoia of the Stoics, whom we can call Providence," as well as "the world imbued with a mind."20 However, there are a few significant problems with attributing Boccaccio's passage to Stoic sources. Boccaccio does not cite Chrysippus here, or Velleius, let alone Cicero. A little further on Cicero does cite Chrysippus for the idea that "divine power resides in reason and in the soul and mind of the natural universe" and "that the world itself is a god...operating in the mind and reason."21 Nonetheless, in this passage Chrysippus confuses Cicero by listing "a huge crowd of unknown gods [magnam turbam...ignotorum deorum]," which includes the aforementioned as well as celestial fire, fate, necessity, water, earth, air, the sun, moon, and stars, and even humans who attained immortality. In contrast, just above we saw that Boccaccio stated that Chrysippus believed that fire, not the mind, was the foundation of all things. Throughout the lengthy treatise Boccaccio is relatively careful about his citations, for which he accessed over 200 sources in total. Boccaccio does occasion ally make mistaken attributions, but those occur only sporadically amidst the hundreds of individual mythological entries, not in this prominent introductory essay establishing Demogorgon as the first of the pagan gods. Instead of Chrysippus, Boccaccio here specifies Theodontius as his source, a source that is available to us almost exclusively through Boccaccio.22 In this one locus it is possible that Boccac cio misrepresented Chrysippus in order to distinguish Greek philosophers who believed that water, air, and fire were the first divine elements, but this is unlikely. Lastly, we shall not let it go unnoticed that in the passage quoted above Cicero juxtaposes the Platonic artificer of the Timaeus and the Stoic divine mind, the former being the very demiurge [demiourgos] from which in all likelihood the name "De mogorgon" was derived, although, as we shall see, there is no evidence to assume that Boccaccio was aware of this etymology. Boccaccio completes this portion of his discussion with an embellishment: Then Theodontius...responded by naming no single person's opinion: It was the opinion of the most ancient Arcadians that earth was the origin of all things; 19 Landi, Demogorgone, 36-45, offers an extensive analysis of the divine mind, Demogorgon, Chaos, and Eternity in Stoic and Academic contexts. 20 1.8 (18): "opificem aedificatoremque mundi Piatonis de Timaeo deum"\ "anum fatidicam Stoicorum Pronoeam, quam Latine licet Providentiam dicere"; "ñeque vero mundum ipsum animo." Arthur Stanley Pease [M. Tulli Ciceronis, De Natura Deorum (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955) vol. I, 175] defends Cicero's use of opifex, in contrast with artifex, to describe the demiurge. 21 1.14 (39): "ait enim vim divinam in ratione esse positam et in universae naturae animo atque mente, ipsumque mundum deum dicit esse...qui in mente et ratione versetur. " 22 For Theodontius, see Marianne Padc, "The Fragments of Theodontius in Boccaccio's Genealogie Deorum Gentilium Libri," in Marianne Pade, Hanncmaric Ragn Jensen, and Lene Waage Petersen, eds., Avignon &amp; Naples: Italy in France—France in Italy in the Fourteenth Century (Rome: "L'Erma" di Bretschncider, 1997) 149-182. •ñ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int class trad (2012) 19:31-62 37 as Thaies said regarding water, they proposed that it contained a divine intel ligence which they believed produced and created everything.23 We will return to the Arcadians later, but here it is important to point out that Theodontius' referencing them will lead us back, as did the aforementioned Chaos tradition, to the archaic Greek epic tradition, and that the Arcadians' earth was as important for reconstructing mythological origins as was Thales' water for the scientific. Boccaccio then turns to Demogorgon himself. He begins each of the subsequent fourteen books in the Genealogy with a single preface. But the first book begins with three.24 We have just discussed the first two, which introduce the entire work. The third, like those which preface the subsequent books, applies specifically to the single book it precedes. Preface 3 offers the reader Boccaccio's vivid eyewitness description of the mythological landscape he "visited" while preparing to write the relevant parts of the genealogy. These passages are quite Dantesque, with eye-witness accounts of geological, topographical, and mythological marvels, descriptions of barely avoided disasters, and vivid imagery and language, Here in Preface 3 Boccaccio will describe divine chthonic intelligence in some of the most vivid—or in this case "morbid"— prose in the entire Genealogy. [1.P3.1] That languid forefather of all the pagan gods, surrounded everywhere by clouds and gloom and accompanied by the greatest majesty of darkness, appeared to me as I passed through the center of the earth's viscera, Demogorgon—the name alone is horrible—enveloped in a certain slimy pallor and relentless humidity, exhaling an earthy, foul, and fetid odor, acknowledging more in another's voice than in his own that he was the father of this wretched realm.25 If we parse this passage we find three elements typical of these Dantesque prefaces: 1) a description of a unique mythological being, 2) the author's terrifying encounter with the mythological being, in this instance Boccaccio's "audience" with Demogorgon, and 3) the gloomy trappings of the netherworld. Boccaccio does not really give us a visual description of Demogorgon himself: he observes that Demo gorgon moves sluggishly, smells foul, and sounds distant. Enveloped in a slimy pallor, he is hidden behind clouds, gloom, and darkness. While not invisible, he cannot really be seen, and he cannot really be heard either. Readers can enjoy Boccaccio's skill in rendering mythological prose, but they should not be fooled into thinking this is the "real" Demogorgon. Boccaccio's Demogorgon does not speak, is 23 "Theodontius vero, ut arbitror, novus homo sed talium investigator precipuus, neminem nominando respondit vetustissimorum Arcadum fuisse opinionem terram rerum omnium esse causam, eique, ut de aqua dicit Thales, mentem inesse divinam existimantes, crediderunt eius opere omnia fuisse producta atque creata." Presumably Boccaccio was introduced to Theodontius when he was a youth studying in Naples with Paolo da Perugia. 24 Boccaccio did not number these three prohemia, but Zaccaria's edition of the Genealogy [Vittorio Zaccaria (ed. and trans.), Genealogie deorum gentilium, in Vittore Branca, ed., Tutte le opere di Giovanni Boccaccio (Milan: Amoldo Mondadori, 1998) VII—VIII] does, hence the numbering [e.g. P2 and P3] I use in my citations. 25 "Summa cum maiestate tenebrarum...veternosus ille deorum omnium gentilium proavus, undique stipatus nebulis et calígine, mediis in visceribus terre perambulanti michi comparuit Demogorgon, nomine ipso horribilis, pallore quodam muscoso et neglecta humiditate amictus, terrestrem tetrum fetidumque evaporans odorem, seque miseri principatus patrem potius alieno sermone quam suo confessus verbo. " Springer</page><page sequence="8">38 Int class trad (2012) 19:31-62 never described, and, even more importantly, fathers no progeny. Despite Boccaccio's claim here that Demogorgon told him "that he was the father of this wretched realm," later in Book 1 Boccaccio will write that Eternity and Chaos are Demogorgon's companions [1.1-2], meaning that they are equally timeless and primordial, and that it is Chaos that actually produces Demogorgon's "children" Strife, the three Parcae, and Pan [1.3-5], while Demogorgon forms Polus from mud [1.6] and Phyton from a mountain top [1.7]. The birth of his daughter Earth seems to derive from Chaos as well, and the many children of Earth (Night, Fama, Tartarus, Tages, Antaeus, Erebus) are mostly from unknown fathers or created parthenogenetically [1.8-14].26 Boccaccio next employs the methodology of the natural scientist, as he will do in many of his scientific exegeses of ancient fables.27 He traces the origins of the belief in the cult of Demogorgon to the ancient Arcadian peasants, who observed the progression of plants blossoming, mountains issuing flames, springs turning into rivers, and tiny sparks flying upwards to create the sun and moon.28 "Those who came after them," as Boccaccio seems to call the second generation of Arcadian peasant worshippers, had a deeper understanding, hypothesizing that the earth had a divine mind which commanded the earth to take these actions. When the ancients held rituals in caves, [1.P3.4] religion used to steal into their minds along with their innate awe of such places and, in their ignorant fear, they imagined the presence of some divinity. Such peoples used to think that this supposed divinity was none other than Demo gorgon, since he was believed to dwell in the bowels of the earth.29 It is doubtful that Boccaccio employed the most prominent ancient account of the origins of religion, that in the fifth book of Lucretius' De rerum natura,30 In the Genealogy [12.16.1] he cites Lucretius only indirectly through Priscian, the gram matical work of Priscian does not contain this particular passage, and the essence of Lucretius' theory is that primitive humans had divine visions and respected the order of the celestial cosmos, which is quite different from Boccaccio's description of the origins of religion.31 The same is true for the De incredibilibus by the paradoxogra pher known as Palaephatos, cited by Eusebius, and a work known to Jerome and 26 Boccaccio does claim [1.14.1] that Erebus was the son of Demogorgon and Earth, but he cites only his teacher Paolo da Perugia, who he said had cited Chrysippus. There is no mention of this in Paolo's own genealogy (for which, see Teresa Hankey, "Un nuovo códice delle Genealogie deorum di Paolo da Perugia," Studi sul Boccaccio 18 (1989) 91); and in the next sentence Boccaccio equates Erebus with Tartarus, whom he had said [1.11.1] was "a son of Earth without a father." 27 E.g. GDG 2.3.5 and 2.53.2. 28 Cf. Lucretius 2.589-599. 29 "subintrare mentes cum nativo locorum horrore religio consuevit et ignaris presentie alicuius divinitatis suspicio quam a talibus suspicatam divinitatem, non alterius quam Demogorgonis existimabant, eo quod eius mansio in terre visceribus crederetur." 30 Lucretius 5.1161-1240. For an analysis of the passage, see Monica Gale, Myth and Poetry in Lucretius (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994) 130-133. 31 Nonetheless, Boccaccio was largely responsible for rehabilitating the Treccnto attitude towards Epicurus, whom Dante condemned to the Circle of Heretics [Inf. 10.13-15], and his reputedly hedonistic philosophy. See Zygmunt Baranski, "Boccaccio and Epicurus," in Jill Kraye and Anna Laura Lepschy, eds., Caro Vitto: Essays in Memory of Vittore Branca (Reading: The Italianist, 2007) 10-27.

But unlike Lucretius, who while believing in the gods uses physics to demonstrate the folly of fearing them, or Palaephatus, who for the most part rationalizes myth rather than religion, Boccaccio sympathizes with the primordial Arcadian naturalists for discovering the wonders of nature while criticizing them for misinterpreting the nature of the divinity who enabled them.33 Although he eloquently describes Demogorgon as a mostly invisible and inaudible being with a name that should not be uttered, and although this bears some resemblance to the conception of the Christian god opera tive throughout the Genealogy, Boccaccio frequently demeans the intelligence of what he calls "this dim-witted credulity" [huius insipide credulitatis] and does not hesitate to use the word stolide [1.P3.3] as well to describe their "stupid" thinking. The final descriptive passage in Preface 3 focuses on ineffability. Boccaccio suggests that by not uttering Demogorgon's name the archaic Arcadians were in creasing his majesty, whether they thought that mortal mouths were inadequate to utter a sublime name or feared that doing so would incur his wrath. [1.P3.5] Because he was of such chief importance among the most ancient Arcadians, they believed that by not uttering his divine name they were augmenting his majesty. Whether they thought it would be unseemly for such a sublime name to come into mortal mouths, or perhaps feared that by naming him they would incur his wrath, it was forbidden by public consent for anyone to utter his name with impunity.34 To explain the ineffability of his name, Boccaccio [1.P3.6] now turns to very familiar Latin sources, first Lucan and then Statius. He cites and quotes part of the necromancy episode in Lucan's Pharsalia [6.730-743], where the Thessalian witch Erichtho is conjuring up seriatim the Furies Tisiphone and Megaera and then Styx, Hecate, and penultimately Persephone.35 The passage culminates with the lines 32 Sec Nicola Festa, Mythographi Graeci (Leipzig: B.

Far from being anthropomorphic, the object of established cult, represented by a statue housed in a dedicated shrine or temple, associated with a specific ritual, or endowed with a function-specific power, this god is invisible, nameless, and endowed with ill-defined but extraordinary powers of evil. The mere utterance of his name can cause an earthquake, and he can look openly at the Gorgon and not turn to stone, whip the Erinyes who otherwise themselves lash their victims, and lie with impunity after swearing by Styx. And this nameless god dwells in a lower level of Tartarus in a sub-subterranean region. This part of the description is particularly important, for it marks a mid-first century terminus post quern for placing this nameless divinity with Demogorgonian features in the infernal regions.38 To a limited extent Boccaccio seems to have conflated his Demogorgon with Lucan's Erichtho. Like Demogorgon, Erichtho was difficult to see, her head covered in a "dry cloud" (as Martindale translates squalenti nube [625]).39 Another aspect of Boccaccio's description of Demogorgon can be found attributed to Lucan's Erichtho as well, the noisome odor: And when she breathes she poisons otherwise non-lethal air.40 36 "Paretis, an Ule / compellandus erit, quo nunquam terra vocato / non concussa tremit qui Gorgona cemit apertam / verberibusque suis trepidant castigat Erinem?"

He had begun presenting a series of public lectures on Dante in 1373, just one year after he had worked through a number of corrections and suggestions to his Genealogy sent to him by the Neapolitan Pietro Piccolo da Monteforte.41 Dante was in turn familiar with Lucan's poem and expands upon his Erichtho passage in particular in the ninth canto of the Inferno (9.22-103) in an extraordinary adaptation of ancient myth and literature.42 He begins with the claim that Vergil has traveled to the depths of Dis before. [9.22-27]43 It is true that I came down here another time, Conjured by that cruel Erichtho, Who could summon shades to return to their bodies. The flesh had just recently left me, When she forced me to enter inside that wall To retrieve a spirit from the circle of Judas. What appears to be a stunning neomythologism has been much discussed by scholars in the past two decades. Modern scholarship has proposed that Vergil's claim is the result of hermeneutic contrivance,44 or a reworking of medieval concepts of necromancy,45 or that it provides a pre-Christian narrative parallel to Christ's harrowing of Hell,46 or simply echoes Vergil's superior knowledge of Dis derived from the Sibyl in Aeneid 6.5 62-5 6 5 47 Be that as it may, Boccaccio recognized that the passage is a literary anachronism in that Vergil preceded by more than a half century the birth of Lucan, the artistic creator of Erichtho 48 In his Expositions on Dante's Comedy [9.17-18], Boccaccio says that "some like to say" [vogliono alcuni dire] that Cassius and Brutus had appealed to Erichtho and that Vergil had been sent 41 For details on the relationship between Boccaccio's Genealogy and his lectures on Dante (Esposizioni), see Michael Papio (trans, and ed.), Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009) 5—21. 42 For Boccaccio's exegesis on the names Dante employs for the netherworld, see Papio, Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy, 50-52 [Accessus 68-73], 43 Ver é ch'altra fiata qua giú fui, congiurato da quella Erítón cruda che richiamava I'ombre a' corpi sui.

Boccaccio then debunks this anachronistic variant by citing his most trusted historical source, Eusebius, as corroboration that Vergil was still alive at that time and would continue to live for many more years.49 Like Dante, Boccaccio may have drawn additional inspiration from Lucan. Dante's Vergil describes the "circle of Judas" (and of Brutus and Cassius) as the lowest circle of the netherworld, and he, too, refers to its great odor. [9.28-31]50 That is the lowest place and the darkest, And farthest from the heaven that encircles everything. This swamp which emits such great odor... As in Lucan [6.730], Dante's Megaera and Tisiphone dwell in the lowest subter ranean region and belong therefore to the same canto [9.46-48], although Boccaccio [3.6-9] subsequently will assign them a position further down the genealogical line.51 Similarly, the Gorgon Medusa appears here in Dante [9.52-56] as she had in Lucan. Generally one who looks at the Gorgon is turned to stone, but both Lucan and Dante pervert the tradition.52 Dante has his Vergil point out in an oddly phrased variant of the traditional mythological motif that Dante "will not return" [nulla sarebbe di tornar] if he looks at the Gorgon. As we have seen, Lucan allows his nameless subterranean power to look at the Gorgon with impunity, so perhaps this freed Dante from imposing the extreme but traditional penalty on himself. As we will see, someone else in the tradition, an anonymous author who lived considerably before Dante but well after Lucan, seems to have connected the Platonic demiurge with the Gorgon as well, producing the name "Demogorgon."53 Still following Lucan's progression, after describing these customary mythical denizens and the visage of Medusa, Dante then focuses on a more powerful divinity. We might anticipate a Demogorgonian presence. This powerful spirit makes the shores of the netherworld tremble [9.66], Nevermind Lucan's claim that he can swear falsely by the Stygian waters, Dante's unnamed spirit walks above them without even wetting his feet [9.80-81], He also has the power to brush away that signature, murky, netherworld air from his face [82-84], However, Dante's spirit turns out to be not Demogorgon but a celestial divinity—a divinity type which only rarely makes an appearance in the netherworld either in ritual or poetry. This celestial divinity might possibly be Mercury, for he carries a wand [verghetta (9.89)], or the archangel Michael, or a conflation of the two.54 Whichever Dante intended this nameless and 49 Papio, , Boccaccio's Expositions on Dante's Comedy, 676, n. 8. 50 Quell'é 7 piú basso loco e 7 piii oscuro, e 7 piu Ionian dal del che tutto gira: Questa palude che 7 gran puzzo spira... 51 Boccaccio [GDG 1.5] includes the three Fates as daughters of Demogorgon. 52 E.g. [Apollodoras] Bibliotheca 2.4.2-3, and Ovid Met. 4.655-660, 4.781, and 5.217. 53 Dante was familiar with the concept of the demiurge primarily through Boethius.

David Quint suggested that Dante "appears to have been aware" of the Demogorgon tradition; he identified and cited as evidence the gloss on Demogorgon in the twelfth-century commentaiy on Lucan by Arnulfus of Orleans.55 Quint then argued that by substituting the celestial messenger Dante consciously rejected the Lucanian tradition and reaffirmed the Vergilian. This reading was as ingenious as it is insightful, but it is not corroborated by Boccaccio. Despite the fact that within the last three years of his life Boccaccio both revised his Genealogy and wrote his Expositions on Dante's Comedy, and despite the literary parallels noted in the previous paragraphs, Boccaccio makes no association between this spirit and Demogorgon and makes no mention at all of Demogorgon in his commentary to this passage in Inferno 9.56 There are several possible reasons for this. Perhaps Boccaccio thought this was too erudite an interpretation for his lay Florentine audience, or perhaps he considered his commitment to Demogorgon as a powerful chthonic being to be an academic exercise unworthy of discussion outside the realm of pagan mythology, or perhaps he thought, like Quint's Dante, that a pagan deity was inappropriate for a predominantly Christian work. Whatever his reason or reasons, we are left with the realization that despite their familiarity with Lucan's passage, neither Dante nor his commentator Boccaccio recorded any association between this powerful chthonic spirit and the name Demogorgon. Finished with this Lucanian Erichtho passage, Boccaccio next cites Lucan's younger contemporary Statius [1.P3.7], In the fourth book of his Thebaid the aged and blind Teiresias has a vision of the netherworld [4.514-517]: For we know what you fear will be said and known: how to confound Hecate (if I feared not you, Thymbraean) and the greatest one of the triple world, an abomination to know— but I shall say nothing about him.57 In the lines immediately preceding these Statius makes it clear that he is alluding to Lucan's passage by referring to the "the Thessalian," i.e. Erichtho.58 Like Lucan's Erichtho and anticipating Dante (and Shelley), Teiresias is threatening to invoke a greater deity. His description of the nameless god is not visual, features again the ineffability of his name and the tremendous fear he evokes, and now adds that he is "the great one of the triple world," that is, of the heaven, earth, and netherworld.59 Statius here gives him an even greater realm of power in the cosmos, making him a masculine counterpart to the aforementioned heavenly/earthly/nether worldly female divinity known, respectively, as Selene-Luna /Artemis-Diana / Hecate (or Persephone-Proserpina).60 55 Quint, "Epic Tradition and Inferno IX," 203-204. 56 Boccaccio does not cite or mention the Amulfiis gloss in his Genealogy. 57 "Seimus enim et quicquiddici noscique timetis/et turbare Hecatem, ni te, Tymbree, timerem/et triplicis mundi summum quem scire nephastum; / ilium sed taceo." 58 Statius Thebaid 5.504-505: "An, rábido iubeat si Thessala cantu, ibitis?" 59 David Vessey, Statius and the Thebaid (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973) 255. 60 Cf.

But a large number of philosophers and magicians assert that other than the known gods worshipped in temples, there is in fact another chief and very mighty god who rules the other divinities much like the sun and moon alone."63 The manuscript tradition of Lactantius Placidus does not, however, offer a reliable source for reading Srjptouyóv, let alone the name "Demogorgon." The ultimate exemplar of all the preserved manuscripts (co), dating from perhaps the eighth century, offered "demoirgon." Sweeney prints Sr^iouyov and credits [Thomas] Gale and [Christian Gottlieb] Heyne in his apparatus, pointing out that their conjecturally restored Greek word was originally written "litteris Latinisdemiourgon.64 Else where he explains that it was [Friedrich] Lindenbrog, working from a manuscript owned by Francis Pithou but now apparently lost, who made the earliest restoration of the name in Greek.65 So the reading Demogorgon is not documented in the older tradition, and all of the subsequent manuscripts offering Demogorgon are roughly contemporary with Boccaccio or later.66 David Anderson, in his study of Boccaccio's glosses on Statius, confirmed that Boccaccio employed at least two manuscript versions of Lactantius [Placidus] : Laurenzi ana Plut. 38.6 [given the siglum m by Sweeney], dating from no earlier than the Xlth century; and an earlier, non-extant manuscript closely related to the sub-branch 61 Alan Cameron, Greek Mythography in the Roman World (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004) 313-320, analyzes the origins of his improbable name.

Demogorgon figures prominently in the anony mous twelfth-century De natura deorum found in the Bodleian Digby codex 221 published by Virginia Brown.72 There he appears first and as the father of all the gods; he lives in the depths of the earth. The brief quotation and partial paraphrase from Lucan [6.745-748] describes him as chthonic, invisible, fearful, and with an ineffable name. But this description of Demogorgon differs significantly from Boc caccio's in that the Digby author allows that either Demogorgon created the "spirits" [daemones] and earth ["Ge, idest Terram"] or that they created him.73 Like the Digby mythographer, the aforementioned Arnulf of Orléans also associates Lucan's un named chthonic divinity with Demogorgon.74 However, in his variorum commentary 67 David Anderson, "Boccaccio's Glosses on Statius," Studi sul Boccaccio 22 (1994) 1-31 and 38.

This twelfth-century genealogy differs considerably from Boccaccio's in that Boccaccio says Demogorgon produced Erebus, who in turn fathered Ether, who in turn fathered Sky. Also, Boccaccio, following Cicero's De natura deorum [3.42], identified and traced the lineages of three Jupiters, one a son of Ether, the second the son of Sky, and the third a son of Saturn. In her seminal article on Theodontius, Marianne Pade collects several four additional appearances by Demogorgon.75 These are found in an anonymous Lucan commen tary,76 in a gloss to Pharsalia 6.744 found in an eleventh-century manuscript,77 in the Fabularius of Konrad de Mure written in Zurich in 1273,78 and in a paraphrase of the same Lucan passage in the De oratione, ieiunio et eleemosyne of Gunther of Pairis in Alsace, also in the thirteenth century.79 The earliest she found was in Bernard of Utrecht's late eleventh-century Commentum in Theodulum, where he is suggested parenthetically as one of three possible fathers of Saturn along with Pollux and Caelius, (i.e. Sky). Nonetheless, once again the text does not offer the form "Demo gorgon" but "demorigon."80 Pade suggest that this is an alternate form, if not a corruption, of "Demogorgon," and given the degree of variation and/or corruption in proper names we find in medieval manuscripts, particularly in the Latin transliteration of Greek names, we must at least allow that Demogorgon, Demiourgon, Demoirgon, Demorigon, and perhaps even Omagion are all variants of the same name.81 This means that we would like to know not only when, where, and how Lucan's ineffable chthonic deity became known as Demogorgon, but also when, where, and how the 75 For a summary and brief description of each, see Padc, "The Fragments of Theodontius in Boccaccio's Genealogie Deorum Gentilium Libri," 159-161. 76 G.

Chance, Medieval Mythography: From the School of Chartres to the Court at Avignon, 1177-1350, 117-118, discusses the possible relationship between the Digby mythographer and Bernard's commentary on Theodulus, allowing for his name to be a confusion for "Theodontius" and accessible to Boccaccio through Paolo da Perugia. But Bernard makes it quite clear that Saturn is the progenitor of the pagan gods, even if he is thought [putatur] to be the son of Pollux, Caelius [Sky], or Demorigon. In contrast, Boccaccio [GDG 3.23.4] records that Saturn, whom he also calls Charon and Cronus, is the son only of Sky, whom he castrated, while Polus, or Pollux, is the creation of Demogorgon [1.6.1], Chance, Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, 396-98, discusses Bernard's description [3.35-37]—more elaborate than Lucan's—of two levels of the underworld, the lower ruled by Demorigon, "who was believed to punish the false oaths of the gods" [qui periuria deorum puniré credebatur], again recalling Lucan's nameless spirit "who swears falsely by the Stygian waters." 81 For Omageon, an orthographical variant of Omagion, see Hankey, "Un nuovo códice dellc Genealogie deorum di Paolo da Perugia," 131.

Of course we have too few exempla from which to draw a firm conclusion, but based on the evidence available we can say in response to the second question that the name Demogorgon becomes standardized in the twelfth century. Before then we have the "demoirgon" of the early Lactantius Placidus tradition and the "demorigon" from Bernard of Utrecht in the late eleventh century. Thereafter the variants disappear in the works of the twelfth-century Arnulf and Digby mythographer and then in the thirteenth-century Konrad de Mure and Gunther. In the fourteenth century we have not only Boccaccio himself but the remnants of the mythological genealogy compiled a generation earlier by his Neapolitan teacher Paolo da Perugia. The name is now (almost) uniformly Demogorgon.82 We have seen, however, that the descriptions of Demogorgon in the twelfth century Arnulf and Digby manuscript do not match those of Boccaccio, which means that a third set of when, where, and how questions must be asked as to the establish ment of the nature of Demogorgon himself. Two generations ago Rudolph Pfeiffer suggested that Boccaccio's description of Demogorgon derived ultimately from the non-extant work of Theodontius.83 Access to Theodontius came presumably through his teacher Paolo and the latter's Calabrian colleague Barlaam. But the remnants of Paolo's work, which allow that either Ovid's Chaos or Janus might have been the "first" divinity, do not directly match Boccaccio's bold assertion that Demogorgon was without question the original progenitor in the lengthy genealogy of pagan divinities.84 This would suggest that Boccaccio was the final arbiter in establishing the Demogorgon that would influence European poets and prose compilers of the subsequent centuries. Because Boccaccio claimed [GDG 15.6.8] that Paolo's widow Biella destroyed her husband's books, and because Theodontius himself, let alone the manuscript tradition of his works, remains a mystery to us, the relationship between Boccaccio, Paolo, and Theodontius and their hundreds of quoted, cited, known, and unknown sources remains complex and impossible to sort out with confidence. As Pade suggests in the ultimate paragraphs of her article, modern investigations into Boccaccio's use of Theodontius and other sources have helped reveal "a very widespread tradition" of mythographic writings and commentaries, much of which is lost or fragmentary.85 That which is extant can be unclear or contradictory, and this can be the result of erroneous transmissions, unorthodox opinions, or mistaken associations, not to men tion ignorance of the ancient Greek language. 82 That is, the name is always "Demogorgon," but the orthography can vary, e.g. "Demogaron" and "Demorgon," for which sec Hankey, "Un nuovo códice delle Genealogie deorum di Paolo da Perugia," 123. 83 Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholarship from 1300 to 1850, 21-22. Pfeiffer cites the corrupted name (including such forms as Daemorgoon, deus demorgon) in Karl Friedrich Weber, ed. Marci Annaei Lucani Pharsalia (Leipzig: Gerhard Fleischer, 1831) 498-499, who in turn cites Heyne for identifying the corruption. Pfeiffer pondered whether Boccaccio used Lactantius Placidus directly or derived the passage from Theodontius, but Boccaccio quotes Lactantius Placidus directly 122 times in the Genealogy, so I see no reason to doubt this one particular instance. 84 E.g.

Even if the name Demogorgon did originate with a "slip of the pen," the suspicion that the culprit had in the back of his mind Lucan's phrase qui Gorgona cernit apertam ["who looks openly at the Gorgon"] seems quite likely.86 Considering the number of times Demogorgon appears even in our scattered witnesses, and considering how many variations there were to his name, I would like to think it more likely that one of our unidentified scribes consciously made the association between the inherently obscure divinity, the Platonic demiourgos (to be discussed presently}, and the well known mythological monster to create the neologism which eventually became the standardized name for this previously named spirit. The opportunities for processes of these sorts were plentiful: Lucan's Pharsalia enjoyed considerable popularity throughout the medieval period, and at lest one commentary had been written already by the end of the fourth century.87 The extant glosses of an early commentator like Vacca, whose floruit, may belong to late antiquity or a few centuries later, frequently provide useful definitions, paraphrases of text, and the sort of etymological, historical, and grammatical information as well as variant readings that may have provided the material which a subsequent copyist might have conflated and produced a name like Demiourgon, Demoirgon, or Demogorgon.88 After the invention and promulgation of the printing press, the first scholar to apply the name Demogorgon to Statius' description was Lilio Gregorio Giraldi.89 In the 1548 introductory letter to his large work on the pagan gods, De deis gentium, he also becomes the first scholar we know of to make the tempting association between the name Demogorgon and the Greek word demiourgos. Boccaccio seems to have overlooked this association, no doubt misled by Leontius, his most direct but idiosyncratic connection to the Greek language. Here is Boccaccio's account of the derivation of the compound name. [GDG 1.P3.11-12] ...it remains only to explain why the sound of his name seems to means something horrid. I think his Greek name, Demogorgon, means "god of the earth": daemon means "god," as Leontius says, and gorgon means "land," or perhaps "wisdom of the land," since daemon is often explained as "knowing" or "knowledge," or, as others would have it, "terrible god," since it is said about the true God who lives in heaven, "Holy and terrible is his name." But he is 86 Cf. O. A. W. Dilke, "Lucan and English Literature," in Donald Reynolds Dudley, ed., Neronians and Flavians: Silver Latin (London: Routledgc and Kegan Paul, 1972) 100; and Landi, Demogorgone, 17. 87 At the end of the fourth century Jerome (Adversum Rufinum 1.16) wrote that he had seen a commentary on Lucan. For corroborating evidence, sec Marti, Arnulfi Aurelianensis Glosule Super Lucanum, xxx-xxxi. The earliest surviving manuscripts arc the ninth-century versions of the Commenta Bernensia and the twelfth-century Adnolationes super Lucanum. Shirley Werner, "On the History of the Commenta Bernensia and the Adnotationes super Lucanum," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 96 (1994) 343-368, rejects previous assumptions that these commentaries were written in late antiquity. 88 For the early date, see Berthe M.

We do not know his source for this particular derivation, but he says that "others" say the name Demogorgon means "terrible god." He may have been interpreting the word daemon in this way, or perhaps he was told that that the first two syllables derived from the word Seivós ["terrible"] and recalling the Greek epic application of the epithet to such gods as Apollo [Horn. II. 5.514; 16.789], Ares [Horn. II. 17.211], and Triton [Hes. Theog. 933], Trying to understand the concept of attributing terribleness to a divinity, Boccaccio seizes on this opportunity to cite the Latin text of Psalm 110.9 and notes this particular similarity between his Christian god and Demogorgon. Of course Boccaccio then takes steps to parse the dissimilarity in that the Christian god is genuinely and justifiably terrible to those who are evil while Demogorgon is terrible because of the ignorance of those who believed in him. Leontius tutored Boccaccio in Greek for nearly three years and assisted him in quoting and translating the nearly four dozen Homeric passages contained in his Genealogy. The results were often imperfect, as they seem to be in his etymological interpretation of the name Demogorgon. Here Leontius' "god of the land" [Saípcov + yecopyós] is admittedly appropriate since Demogorgon was a chthonic divinity. Nonetheless, although proper names, as David Anderson warned, are par ticularly resistant to secure analysis, modern scholarship has established that the word demiourgos subdivides into demos ("people") and ergos ("worker"). The word has multiple applications and a long history, but it lies at the foundations of our exam ination of the sources for Boccaccio Demogorgon. Our focus here begins with Plato, who used the word nearly five dozen times, usually in mundane contexts to describe a "workman" or "artisan."91 Plato tended not to differentiate or define his technical terms clearly, but in the Timaeus [e.g. 29c and 42e] he clearly uses the word to specify the artificer of the cosmos.92 Plato's Timaeus would remain one of the philosopher's most influential works; its mathematical and musical elements as well as its account of the creation and Atlantis have attracted numerous scholars and thinkers, as well as artists, for many centuries.93 Through this important vector of the Platonic tradition the demiurge, as the cosmic artificer, made his way into the philosophical, theological, and mystical thought of the Hellenistic 90 "...explicare quid nomen eius horridum sonare videalur tantummodo superest. Sonat igitur, ul reor, Demogorgon Grece, 'Ierre deus' Latine. Nam demon 'dens,' ut ait Leontius, gorgon aulem 'terra' interpretatur, seu potius 'sapientia terre,' cum sepe demon 'sciens' vel 'sapientia' exponatur, seu, ut magis placet aliis, 'deus terribilis,' quod de vero Deo qui in celis habitat legitur: 'Sanctum et terribile nomen eius.' Verum Iste aliam ob causam terribilis est, nam lile ob integritatem iustitie male agentibus in iudicio est terribilis, iste vero stolide existimantibus." 91 E.g. Republic 530a. For Plato's pre-Timaeus development of the demiurge, see W. D. Ross, Plato's Theory of Ideas (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1951) 44, 127. 92 Cf. Tim. 28a-29a, where he uses the term Sripioupyos (artificer) twice, once in the cosmic context, along with the terms rroiriTfiv (maker), iraTÉpa (father), and tsktcíivómsvos (architect). 93 Recent accounts include Richard D.

He remains important in the mainstream cosmological conception of Middle Platonist and early Neoplatonist authors, especially Iamblichus.94 But far from remaining solely a Platonic phenomenon, the demiurge served as a divine creator in influential treatises of Hellenistic Judaism (e.g. Philo of Alexandria)95 and Gnosticism (e.g. the Nag Hammadi texts) as well as the Corpus Hermeticum [1.9].96 This brings our investigation of Boccaccio's Demogorgon to a chronological era in which it becomes (appropriately) murky. Scholars in various sub-specialties have had considerable difficulty identifying securely and convincingly the demiurge tradition through the subsequent centuries as it becomes contaminated and gets reconfigured by a number of authors. In 1960, for instance, Antonie Wlosok argued that the original Platonic branch of the demiurge tradition was influenced by the Gnostic branch of the tradition.97 Her main assertions were shortly thereafter refuted by A. D. Nock, but Nock in turn asserts that the Gnostic tradition influenced Lactantius himself.98 Separately, subsequent scholarship has investigated a number of vectors of influence between pagan Gnosticism and Judaism.99 Hans Jonas in his standard book on Gnosticism stated that "the demiurge...is often painted with the distorted features of the Old Testament God," pointing out as examples the 94 Cf. John M. Dillon, The Middle Platonists: A Study of Platonism, 80 B.C. to A.D. 220 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977) 361-372; and Gregory Shaw, Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus (University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995). 95 Roberto Radice, "Philo's Theology and Theory of Creation," in Adam Kamesar, ed., The Cambridge Companion to Philo (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009) 131-132. Philo increased the grandeur and importance of Plato's demiurge by making his version of the demiurge responsible for creating not only the physical world but the world of Ideas as well. 96 For a summary essay on the relationship between Judaism and predominantly Hellenistic Hellenism, sec Erich S.

Although ancient Orphic treatises usually refer to its demiurge as Phanes, modern scholarship has labeled Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the Orphic adept who is a Gnostic" [Harold Bloom, Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds (New York: Warner Books, Inc., 2002) 307] and a poetic and spiritual "demiurge" [Bertrand P.

However, as we have observed in following Pade's conclusions, he did have access to some of the more obscure and unorthodox aspects of the Greek mythological tradition through his familiarity with the work of Theodontius, his collaboration with Leontius Pilatus, and his studies with Paolo da Perugia, through whom he had indirect access to Barlaam. In addition, some significant Jewish sources were available in Latin. This meant that Boccaccio found himself confronted with not just the traditional Greco-Roman pantheon but a number of different kinds of divinities from the Olympian, Gnostic, and Jewish traditions. Oftentimes when he discusses such Greek or Greek-speaking Jewish authors as Porphyry or Josephus, he tends to use them as corroboration of his Latin sources (e.g. 1.31.16, where Porphyry is used to explicate Vergil [Aeneid 6.893-896]), or he ridicules them when they disagree with his funda mental belief in the Christian god, for example at 4.68.12, where he ridicules Josephus for maintaining that angels had intercourse with mortal women to produce the Old Testament Giants Nimrod and Goliath: And then there were the giants, huge in stature, to which Holy Scripture bears witness. At least two of these are named there, although they were not of such a wondrous magnitude, namely, Nimrod, who devised the tower up to God, and the Philistine Goliath, who was vanquished by David with a sling and stones. Josephus, a man otherwise circumspect and learned, believed, as he writes in his Jewish Antiquities, that such giants as these were procreated by the angels of God having intercourse with mortal women. This is of course ridiculous...101 Boccaccio repeatedly insists in the Genealogy that the Christian god was the only true god, but the subject matter of the Genealogy forced him to differentiate at least three additional forms of divine figures and hypostases. The latter, following the example of Ovid in particular, he could simply treat as human protagonists in quintessentially human fables; any aspect of the characterization or fable that seemed supernatural Boccaccio regularly dismissed by applying allegorical, historical, scientific, or astro logical analysis. The major Olympian gods, following the example of Cicero in the De natura deorum, Boccaccio tended to categorize as Euhemerized oecists, culture heroes, law givers, and mentors of early human history and appropriated their various homelands, alleged powers, and narratives among several different homonymous figures (e.g. the three Jupiters). Demogorgon represents a fourth type of divinity, one which is chthonic, nameless, aniconic, powerful, and mysterious. 100 Jonas, The Gnostic Religion, 45; cf. his summary of the Apocryphon of John (205). 101 "Fuere igitur ingentes stature Gigantes, quod et sacra testatur pagina, ex quibus etsi non huius tam mirande magnitudinis fuerint, duo saltern in eadem nuncupantur, Nembroth scilicet, qui turrim in Deum excogitavit, et Golias Phylisteus a Davit funda el lapidibus superatus.

He did not set out to identify and differentiate types of ancient divinities, and it is possible that he was unaware of the importance of the distinctions he collected or intuited. To him they were all pagan creatures inferior to his Christian god, worshipped in folly, and distinguishable from one another more or less only by their positive or negative reputations; and, as I pointed out above, he made every attempt at dismissing through Trecento means of analysis any qualities that made them meta-human. But as a scholar who studied pagan myth through out his life and worked on this particular project over several decades, Boccaccio read about different divinities who once commanded the respect and reverence or fear of the ancients, and although he could not accept the fundamental tenets of their belief systems, he developed a rudimentary understanding and, at least insofar as he described Jupiter, as we have seen, appreciation for non-Christian worship. Demogorgon, because he had no Euhemerizable human accomplishments or properties other than a "mind," and because Boccaccio had learned through his Greek sources that there was no other primordial god who was so powerful, associated with an extended progeny, and parentless, was different. The only available comparanda for him were descriptions of the god of the ancient Judeans, another divinity who Boccaccio knew had no human elements to analyze and dismiss with ease. In compiling the Genealogy, the large and varied selection of Greek and Latin sources Boccaccio successfully amassed, cited, and quoted included the Latin sources which contained typical, albeit brief, Roman descriptions of the Hebrew god. Here the Romans struggled to describe not just a foreign god of the sort that was regularly syncretized with one of their own, e.g. Jupiter Ammon, but a god whose essence was foreign to the familiar, named, anthropomorphic, iconic, and functionally specific Greco-Roman divinity.102 These sources included not only the well known Lucan, who refers to Jewish "rites of an uncertain god,"103 but also Tacitus, who was still a relatively precious source in the third quarter of the Trecento.104 In his Histories [5.5], Tacitus offers a description of the irregularities he observed in connection with the Jewish supreme being. The Jews have a purely mental conception of a single divinity. They consider profane those who make representations of their gods from perishable materials and in human forms. They consider their god to be supreme and eternal, aniconic and imperishable. Therefore they erect no statues in their cities, much less in their temples.'05 102 Cf. Zeus Olympios, who was introduced by Antioehus IV to replace the Hebrew god, for which see 2 Maccabees 6.2; cf. Tac. Hist. 5.8.2. For a survey of scholarly hypotheses about the interrelationship between Zeus Olympios, Baal-Shamcn, and Yahweh, see John Day, Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan (London: Sheffield Academic Press, 2000) 83-85. For Jupiter Ammon, see Servius on Aeneid 4.196 and Lucan 9.518; cf. Boccaccio GDG 12.25.2. 103 Lucan Pharsalia 2.592-593:"c/e&lt;/ita sacris incerti Judaea dei." 104 Cf. Juvenal 14. 97: nil praeter nubes et caeli numen adorant ["they worship nothing other than the clouds and a spirit/deity of the sky/heavens."]. Boccaccio names or cites Juvenal five times in the Genealogy. 105 "ludaei mente sola unumque numen intellegunt: profanos qui deum imagines mortalibus materiis in species hominum ejfingant; summum illud et aeternum ñeque imitabile neque interiturum. Igitur nulla simulacra urbibus suis, nedum templis sistunt." Cf. Juvenal 14.102: "whatever Moses transmitted in the secret book [tradidit arcano quodcumque uolumine Moyses]."

However, Boccaccio [3.23.8-9] did cite the passage in Tacitus' Histories [2.3] in which the historian describes the visit by Vespasian's son, Titus, to the sanctuary of Paphian Venus.106 The focus of this sanctuary is the (still extant) aniconic stone, which for an "obscure reason" [ratio in obscuro] was "an image of the goddess in non-human form" [simulacrum deae non effigie humana]. In addition, Boccaccio frequently cites Augustine, particularly the De civitate dei, and in one passage in particular in which Augustine cites Varro [fr. 18 Cardauns], he suggests that the Jews as well as the early Romans worshipped their divinities without images and thereby avoided committing to a specific anthropomorphic shape a divinity more appropriately described by the quality of its divine reason: [4.31] The same very perceptive and learned author says that the only ones seeming to him to have perceived what God is, were those who believed him to be the soul governing the world by rational movement...He says also that for more than a hundred and seventy years the ancient Romans worshipped the gods without an image...He cites as a evidence for this opinion the Jewish nation, among others.107 Of course Boccaccio also had access to the writings of the Apostle Paul, and in Acts 17.23 there is mention of the "unknown god" [áyvcóoTcp 0e&lt;¡&gt;] who a century ago became the subject of the exemplary study by Eduard Norden.108 This particular "unknown god" was an atypical type of Athenian divinity similar to and to an unknown extent dependent upon the non-Hellenic concept of an anonymous god who is neither anthropomorphic nor iconic.109 Norden concluded that this concept was Eastern in origin, exploring in considerable detail the similarities and exchanges between Greek and Semitic thought and divine concepts in the early Christian period. The very concept of "knowing god," Norden argued, was the result of a kind of 106 Boccaccio inserted the Tacitus passage in the margin of his autograph [Laurenziana Plut. 52.9, 38r], He refers to Tacitus' Annates 12-15 in the "Literal Exposition" portion of Canto 4 in his Expositions in Dante's Comedy to describe the death of Lucan in the Pisonian Conspiracy [4.132-133] and the death of Seneca [4.344 and 351], In introducing the former passage [4.131], Boccaccio negatively evaluates the literary merits of Lucan's poetry, concluding nonetheless that Lucan had demonstrated that he was "marvelously intelligent" [maravigliosa eccellenzia d'ingegno dimostra]." i°7 eiialn idem auctor acutissimus atque doctissimus, quod hi soli ei uideantur animaduerlisse quid esset Deus, qui crediderunt eum esse animam motu ac ratione mundum gubernantem...Dicit etiam antiquos Romanos plus annos centum et septuaginta deos sine simulacro coluisse...Cui sententiae suae testem adhibet inter cetera etiam gentem ludaeam."

Recent scholarship has continued this Eastern emphasis, focusing in particular on ancient Semitic concepts of nameless and aniconic divinity.110 This is where our search has led as well, albeit through the crossroads of Olympian, Platonic, Stoic, Gnostic, Jewish, and Christian tenets that were filtered through Latin interpretations of both Western and Eastern concepts. In 1957 Gilbert Highet stated in The Classical Tradition, "The awful figure of Demogorgon in Prometheus Unbound apparently originated from Lucan."111 In the next decade Rudolf Pfeiffer in his History of Classical Scholarship from 1300 to 1850 disagreed, echoing Gilbert Murray's "slip of the pen" phrase.112 He criticized Highet for his misleading note in which the latter says that "Demogorgon has a complex ancestry. His name is evidently a blend of the monstrous terrifying Gorgons and the great Craftsman, Demiourgos, who Plato says made the universe."113 But I would like to think that both scholars have hit on individual pieces of the truth. Highet made the assumption that Lucan and then Statius were referring to the same unnamed myth ological being, which is certainly likely, given the latter's admiration for the former and their relative chronological proximity.114 They both make it very clear that their nameless god is chthonic in nature; indeed, Lucan's final line places him in a level lower than the rest of those dwelling in the netherworld. By placing the literary descendant of the Demiurge, the creator of the universe, in the lowest depths of the lower world, Lucan effectively perverts the order of the cosmos, putting a greater power in the netherworld than Greco-Roman antiquity had ever created. Satan, of course, did not belong to the Greco-Roman pantheon and was even a pagan object of ridicule against Christian apologists,115 and Hades/Pluto was usually portrayed as the Hesiodic and Homeric brother of Zeus/Jupiter and Poseidon/Neptune and therefore proprietor of the entire nether kingdom, not specifically the tormenter of Tartarus."6 Indeed, modern scholarship long ago recognized that one of the most important 110 See Chiara Ombretta Tommasi Moreschini's introduction to Eduard Norden, Agnostos Theos: Dio ignoto—Ricerche sulla storia della forma del discorso religioso (Brescia: Editrice Morecelliana, 2002) 9 122. 111 Gilbert Highet, The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1957) 421.

Apollo brings a plague to the Greeks in the first book of the Iliad, and Juno plays a wickcd role in the Aeneid. Even though Jeffrey Burton Russell, The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977) 122-173, insists [123] that the Greco-Roman gods were "ambivalent manifestations of the one God," he still maintains that among the Greeks and Romans "there is no one principle of evil." Divinities like Hecate and Hermes have evil and chthonic aspects, and Hesiod story about Pandora refers to multiple evils. Russell [126 and 142-143] also addresses Pan and spirits [daimones], which along with the three Fates and the rivers of the netherworld, particularly Acheron, would be associated with Demogorgon in Paolo's Genealogie [Hankey, "Un nuovo códice dcllc Genealo gie deorum di Paolo da Perugia," 91] and Boccaccio's [1.4-5], Springer</page><page sequence="25">Int class trad (2012) 19:31-62 55 aspects of Lucan's Pharsalia was his propensity to parody and invert Vergilian passages."7 This passage in Book 6 is one of the most notable, for it is here that Lucan introduces his readers to horrible denizens of the same netherworld which ultimately gave Aeneas, and therefore Augustan Roman readers, such an optimistic prophecy of Rome's great future. Instead, Lucan prophesizes the gloom that the establishment of empire would ultimately bring to the Roman state. By creating this more powerful nether god, who can stare at a gorgon, whip a fury, swear falsely by the Styx, and dwell in an even lower level, Lucan deepens and expands the cosmic extent of evil. Lucan was forced to commit suicide in 65 well before his 25th birthday, while his younger contemporary Statius lived twice as long and seems to have completed his Thebaid in the early 90s. This is the same decade in which Tacitus was writing his Histories and describing the Flavian conquest of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple of the Judaean god.118 Josephus' account was roughly contemporary as well, as were the last of the canonical gospels testifying to the life, passion, and death of Jesus Christ.119 Tacitus [Ann. 15.44] was the first pagan Roman author to mention Christ, and here, too, he misunderstood the belief in the Christian god, which he described as an "evil [mali]," and the nature of the religion itself, which he described as a "destructive superstition [exitiabilis superstitio]."120 Pliny's subsequent letters [10.96-97] to Trajan, written during the years he served as governor of Bithynia (111 to 113), asked for guidance as to how to adjudicate cases that involved Christian worship. Predictably, Pliny seemed to regard the nature and worship of god as entirely anthropomorphic in concept. At least two significant features of Boccaccio's description of Demogorgon derive from the Lucan passage—his subterranean presence [tenet... Tartara] and the terror he invokes [tremit...trepidant]. It is questionable whether Demogorgon's invisibility derives from the word indespecta [«unseen»] for two reasons. It is not clear whether this rare word applies to its grammatical counterpart Tartara or metaphorically to the subterranean divinity himself, and Boccaccio does not even include this line in his "7 For the Erichtho passage in particular, see Frederick M. Ahl, Lucan: an Introduction (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1976) 140; and Masters, Poetry and Civil War in Lucan's Bellum Civile, 180-196 and 205-215. 118 The extent portion of Tacitus' Histories ends during his account of the year 70, before the complete story can be told. 119 In the wake of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi texts there was considerable interest in finding Gnostic influences in the foundations of Christianity, particularly in the Gospel of John; cf. the thirteen papers in Charles W. Hcdrick, Harold A. Attridgc, and Robert Hodgson, Jr., eds., Nag Hammadi, Gnosticism, and Early Christianity (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1986); for a historical and bibliographical surveys, see Kyle Keefer, The Branches of the Gospel of John: the Reception of the Fourth Gospel in the Early Church (London: T &amp; T Clark, 2006) 21-26; and D.

Subsequent Johannine studies have for the most part abandoned this track. 120 Ronald Syme [Tacitus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958) II, 530, comments: "Tacitus appears to nourish in hypertrophy all the prejudices of an imperial race....The Jews asserted another kind of superiority and held aloof from the comity of nations, deaf to persuasion and recalcitrant even against armed compulsion. Their odium humani generis put them beyond the pale." In contrast, Rhiannon Ash, "Fission and Fusion: Shifting Roman Identities in the Histories," in The Cambridge Companion to Tacitus (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 2009), A. J.

We have seen that the foul odor Boccaccio attributes to Demogorgon recalls that emitted by Lucan's Erichtho [6.522: non letíferas...perdidit auras]. But this still does not account for the entirety of Boccaccio's description of Demogorgon. He begins by citing Theodontius and identifying ancient earth worshippers who name the earth's divine mind Demogorgon. Then he specifies that these earth worshippers were Arcadians. In the literary sphere the pastoral Arcadian theme, particularly as developed in Vergil's Eclogues, had provided literary inspiration for Boccaccio's Bucolicum car men}21 But as a scholar Boccaccio expanded and enriched the source pool by shifting from the atmospheric Arcadian setting to the historical narratives associated with ancient Arcadia. Of course Ovid set a number of the myths in his Metamorpho ses in a meta-historical Arcadia. The stories of Lycaon [1.163-252], Pan &amp; Syrinx [1.689-712], and Callisto [2.401-530] all take place in Arcadia. The story of Daphne [1.452-567], one of Ovid's most familiar and influential tales he actually set in Thessaly, but where Servius glosses the word laurus at Aeneid 2.513, he specifies that Daphne was the daughter of the Arcadian river Ladon and Earth and, contrary to Ovid's well known account of her metamorphosis into a tree, explains that she was swallowed by her mother Earth and that a laurel tree grew in that location.122 Yet, in the account of Ovid's predecessor, Parthenius [15.1], Daphne hunts with the maiden companions of Artemis in the Peloponnese, presumably in or near Arcadia.123 Boccaccio did not separate out the various elements of such a well-known Ovidian story, so when he recounts the fable very briefly in GDG 7.29, he simply declares Daphne, whom he calls «Danes» in accord with contemporary tradition, to be the daughter of the Thessalian Peneus River, as did Ovid. However, back at the beginning of Book 1, Boccaccio does mention the Arcadian river Ladon just a few chapters after his discussion of Demogorgon where he describes Pan, the second son of Demogor gon, and the Arcadian nymph Syrinx—whose story is quite similar in plot to that of Apollo and Daphne. And when describing the Ladon River in his detailed gazeteer of mountains, forests, springs, lakes, rivers, swamps, and seas, there he does cite the Arcadian variant to the Thessalian Daphne, probably following Servius (Ec. 3.63).124 It is no accident that many of these Arcadian mythological tales occur near the beginning of Ovid's Metamorphoses and Boccaccio's Genealogy. Ovid's poem and Boccaccio's treatise both proceed in an intended chronological order, and using the sources available to him, Boccaccio determined that the beginnings of Greco-Roman religion 121 For the origins of Vergil's Arcadia as a poetic symbol, sec John B.

He would not have received corroboration of this from the most trusted of his historical sources, the Chronicle of Eusebius. Instead he is clearly relying on mythological Greek sources, namely Theodontius and Leontius, whom he repeatedly cites in numerous relevant passages that describe some of the earliest events in human history, as when earth-worshipping Arcadian peasants discovered religion and the divine reason fl.P3.3-4], Later in his Genealogy Boccaccio cites Theodontius and Leontius as his sources for the story of Lycaon, King of the Pelasgians, «afterwards called Arcadians,» who hosted a cannibalistic banquet at which one of the guests was the young Lysanias, «afterwards called Jupiter» [4.66.1-6].125 Soon after, Boccaccio [5.1.1-4] again cites Theodon tius and Leontius for the information that Lysanias/Jupiter moved from Arcadia to Athens, established a number of civilizing institutions, and was worshipped as a god. In this account Lycaon, whose activities Cicero [De natura deorum 3.53] locates as well in Arcadia, seems to serve as a veritable hypostasis of Jupiter.126 The reference to the Arcadian Lycaon as king of the Pelasgians also suggests that the earlier stratum of the Theodontian and Leontian Greek source material may date back to Hesiod [frag. 161.1]. The fourth-century historian Ephorus [70F 113] (preserved in Strabo [5.2.4]) reports that Hesiod wrote that Pelasgus was the father of « godlike Lycaon.» uístq é^eyévovxo Aumovoc; ávxiGéoio öv TToxE tíkt£ n8A,a&lt;xyó&lt;;'27 Similarly, pseudo-Apollodorus reports in the Bibliotheca [3.96] that Hesiod said elsewhere that Pelasgus was « autochthonous,» i.e. earth-born. Although he does not specify the location of this particular « earth,» Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl thirty years ago pinpointed the vibrant Arcadian tradition of autochthony with which Hesiod was no doubt familiar.128 In addition, that Pelasgus was born from the earth suggests some relationship to the Earth goddess, whom we have already seen described as the mother of Daphne and the realm of Demogorgon. Demogorgon's first progeny, Strife [Litigium] reveals another relevant Hesiodic remnant.129 The genealogy in Hesiod's Theogony [116-123] begins with the succes sive births of Chaos, Earth, and Tartarus, the first of whom gives birth to Erebus and Night, the parthenogenetic mother of Strife [225], who in turn produces more than a 125 For a analysis of Jupiter in the Latin epic literary context, see Charles Segal, "Jupiter in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses,'" Arion 9 (2001) 80-81. 126 Cicero specifics that two of the three Jupiters were born in Arcadia.

Of course, there were parallels to the Hesiodic tradition; for a recent example, see Thomas Cole, "Ovid, Varro, and Castor of Rhodes: The Chronological Architecture of the 'Metamorphoses,'" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 102 (2004) 355-422.

Myres, "A History of the Pclasgian Theory," The Journal ofHellenic Studies 27 (1907) 170-225, esp. 185-186. 129 Dcmogorgon is not the biological father of Strife, the three Parcac, or Pan; he acts as midwife, extracting them from the womb of Chaos. Nonetheless, Boccaccio's rubrics at 1.3-5 label them as filii of Demogorgon.

The genealogical lineages are rather similar, of course, but of particular interest is Hesiod's description of his third divinity, Tartarus [119]: TápTapa t/ qEpóEvxa puxw x9°v°S EúpuoSeíqs [«gloomy Tartarus deep in the wide-wayed earth»] Similar to Boccaccio's Demogorgon, Hesiod's Tartarus [119] is gloomy [riepoevxa] and located in the innermost [M^X&lt;?&gt;] part of the earth [xöovös]. Elsewhere in the Theogony [720-721], Hesiod locates Tartarus far beneath the earth as a detached netherworld equidistant from the earth as the earth is from the sky.131 What makes this line particularly interesting for us is that it was omitted at some point in the Greek tradition and does not appear in either Aristotle [Metaph. 984b27] or Plato [Symp. 178B], or in the works of their followers.132 It resurfaces later in the Homeric Scholia A [1.312al], one of the works which Pade avers was known in the scriptoria of late medieval Calabria and Apulia,133 and in the Theologiae Graecae compendium of the Stoic Cornutus, who was a contemporary of Lucan and Statius.134 According to Suetonius' Life of Persius [De poetis 32a 73 (Ritschelio)], Cornutus and Lucan were acquainted, and contemporary scholarship has recognized him as Lucan's teacher in the subject of Stoic mythology.135 Tartarus reappears as a member of the initial Hesiodic trio also in Pausanias [9.27.3],136 130 A few of Hcsiod's first dozen evil children of Strife are comparable to the evils listed by Vergil in his description of the netherworld [Aen. 6.274-281], e.g. Toil (nóvov/ia*°'')» Hunger (Aipós/Fames), and Sorrows C'AXyta/Luctus). This passage must have been familiar to Boccaccio, who cites the bracketing passages (Aen. 6.259 [Gen. 11.40.1], 287 [Gen. 4.26.1], and 289 [Gen. 10.10.3]). Nonetheless, Boccaccio does not cite this particular Vergilian passage nor list these evils as parents or progeny in the Genealogy. For a parallel but dissimilar list, see Cicero De natura deorum 3.44. 131 Cf. Homer Iliad 8.13-16, where Tartarus, "the deepest gulf (pi0ioTOV...ßfjp60pov] under the earth" is again gloomy [qepoEVTa] and equidistant. 132 See West, Hesiod: Theogony, 194-195. 133 For the activity in Greek literature in the fourteenth ccntury in particular, see Roberto Weiss, "The Greek Culture of South Italy in the Later Middle Ages," Proceedings of the British Academy 37 (1953) 23-50, collected and reprinted in Roberto Weiss, Medieval and Humanist Greek (Padua: Editrice Antenore, 1977) 13-43, esp. 25-29. 134 Peter Busch and Jürgen K.

Boccaccio believed that Hesi od's contemporary, Homer, with whose texts Boccaccio had more immediate if not entirely accurate familiarity, was Arcadian. Citing Pronapides, who, according to Diodorus Siculus [3.67.5], was the teacher of Homer, Boccaccio in his exegeses of Dante says that Homer died in Arcadia.137 In each citation Boccaccio attributes Theodontius as his intermediate source for arcane information about primoridal (i.e. archaic) Greece, so the Protocosmus was his source for the story in which Demo gorgon functioned as a veritable midwife when Chaos gave birth to Strife and the Arcadian Pan.138 In addition, Diodorus tells us also that Pronapides was one of the first to use the alphabet the Greeks learned from the Phoenicians, and that this early Greek alphabet, also used by Orpheus, was known as the Pelasgic alphabet, i.e. named after the Pelasgians, whom Theodontius identified with the Arcadians.139 Lastly, there is another Arcadian strain of primacy that we read about in Polybius, an Arcadian by birth, who reports [4.20-21] that the primordial Arcadians symbolized the harmony of music and earthly nature, reminding us that it was the Arcadian Pan who invented instrumental music.140 Tracing the origins of variant archaic Greek myths is rarely a simple enterprise, and it often ends in futility. In this search we lose track at several chronological points. Modern scholarship cannot really recover the source of the earliest Pelasgian and Arcadian myths, and those mythical fragments quickly become scattered and obscured, only to be picked up again by Theodontius who himself is a chronological and prosopographical obscurity. Other fragmentary variants may well have passed from Calabrian scriptoria to northern Italy via Barlaam and Leontius. Nonetheless, enough chronologically and geographically similar, albeit fragmented, details have survived to suggest that Boccaccio accessed from his untraditional, primarily Greek sources a confluence of Arcadian creation and foundation myths which involve the earth goddess, the foundations of Greek religion, primordial human history, and culture heroes. One of Boccaccio's many achievements in compiling and writing the Genealogy was that he approached the Demogorgon-worshipping Arcadians from a historical rather than a literary perspective. Dependent upon Servius, Theodontius, and Leontius, he was able to revisit many myths and put them into a different context, one of the several reasons Boccaccio's Genealogy does not read like a compendium of myths familiar today from Hesiod and Homer, the Greek tragedians, Vergil and Ovid. Still, it is doubtful that the elaborate prose in Boccaccio's description of early Arcadian religion and Demogorgon derived from an author other than Boccaccio himself. A passage like the one referred to earlier and which I produce more fully here 137 Esposizioni sopra la Comedia di Dante 1 Iit.91 and 41it.96, 105-107. 138 GDG 1.3.2. 139 Pronapides resurfaces in twelfth-century Byzantium, e.g. Tzetzes Chiliades 13.496 and Galenus, Allegoriae in Hesiodi theogoniam, 365, which of course postdates the period in which Theodontius is thought to have lived. See also, Jenö Platthy, The Mythical Poets of Greece (Washington DC: Federation of International Poetry Associations, 1985) 218 and 252, who cites [G.] Sotiroff, "Koinéi and Idiai," The Classical World 62 (1968) 131-132, for the application of Cadmeian letters to the Pelasgic tongue. 140 For a fuller discussion, see Gerbino, Music and the Myth of Arcadia, 7-8. Although Boccaccio does not cite Polybius, he could have known some aspect of his work from Cicero, Jerome, Porphyry, or Livy; cf. Pierre Courcelle (Harry E. Wedeck, trans.), Late Latin Writers and Their Greek Sources (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1969) 75-76. ö Springer</page><page sequence="30">60 Int class trad (2012) 19:31—62 [1.P3.3] is typical of the sort of prose Boccaccio employed in all of the prohemia that precede each of the fifteen books of the Genealogy. {3} Theodontius says that the cause of this dim-witted credulity originates not with scholars but with very ancient Arcadian peasants. Because they were landlocked dwellers of the mountains and woodlands, and because they saw the land spontaneously produce forests and all kinds of bushes, blossom with flowers, fruits, and seeds, nourish all the animals, and then receive all of them back when they die, and because they saw the mountains vomit forth flames as well, fires chipped out from hard flints, and winds issuing forth from hollows and valleys, and because they felt it move sometimes and even emit roars as it pours out from its viscera springs, lakes, and rivers, as if ethereal fire and bright air rose out from it and, having drunk so much it urinated that huge sea of the ocean, and because they saw that from clashing fires tiny sparks flying upwards brought forth the spheres of the sun and moon, and, interwoven at the top of the sky, fastened themselves into stars, they stupidly believed them to be eternal. Including the citation of Theodontius, Boccaccio leaves his prosaic footprints here by referring to ancient peasants,141 condemning their ignorance in an otherwise golden-age setting,142 listing geophysical features and natural phenomena in a pro gressive series,143 inserting stark vocabulary,144 and concluding with a cosmic climax.145 This suggests also that some of the specifics of Boccaccio's descriptions of Demogorgon and his progeny did not necessarily depend upon the specifics of his sources. Having walked the reader through a number of sources, I will now sum up by reconstructing a hypothetical survey of Demogorgon's development. The human impetus to establish a cosmogony or divine genealogy produced both the initial chapters of the Book of Genesis and Hesiod's Theogony. These are not the earliest examples, of course. The Babylonian Enuma Elish, for instance, left its mark upon both works. The historical contacts between the first millennium Jews and eastern Greeks, including Hesiod's father, are well established,146 and although the historical sequence lays beyond modern chronological analysis, the first millennium Greeks believed as well in traditions that attributed cosmogenies to such mytholog ical, mystical, or elusive personnages as Orpheus and Pronapides.147 But local myths and genealogies were developed as well. Apparently by the end of the eighth century, for instance, Hesiod recorded the tradition that Arcadian Lycaon was the son of the autochthonous Pelasgos. In the sixth and fifth centuries the archaic poetic traditions were preserved and adapted by the likes of Acusilaus [cf. Plato Symposium 178b] and 141 E.g. GDG 4.20.3. 142 E.g. GDG 4.44.11; 5.30.6. 143 E.g. GDG 4.22.9. 144 E.g. GDG 4.24.1. 145 E.g.

Bremmcr, Greek Religion and Culture, the Bible and the Ancient Near East (Leiden: Brill, 2008) 11-18. 147 Homer [//. 14.303], of course, has Hera say that Ocean and Tcthys are the father and mother of the gods [úflKEavóv te 8Év yfjvEoiv Ka pr| Tripa tt|0Ov] &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="31">Int class trad (2012) 19:31-62 61 Aristophanes [Birds 690-704], and then Plato in the fourth century produced his cosmic Demiourgos, a discreet, fictional but non-mythological creator which by its secular nature could better endure the ultimate dominance of the Jewish creator god after absorption into paleo-Christian contexts. The complicated interactions between Gnostic, Jewish, and early Christian writers is well beyond the scope of this study, but it was during the late Hellenistic period and the first few centuries of the Roman Empire that profound and influential concepts of mythological evil were developed, and a considerable degree of negative spirituality was attributed to the primordial demiurge of the Gnostic creation.148 For sure, but to an uncertain extent, knowledge of some of these unsanctioned theological approaches reached the first-century Roman literati at approximately the same time as Lucan and then Statius were developing a new and influential tradition of subterranean evil in a literary, but not ritual, context. From the late fourth-century, a century which pro duced important definitions of the divine nature of the Christian god, a set of parallel texts appears, Augustine's De civitate dei and Lactantius Placidus' commentary on Statius' Thebaid, and these will be well known to and frequently cited by Boccaccio. The former articulated the non-iconic, non-anthropomorphic nature of pagan divinity which differed significantly from the vast array of iconic, anthropomorphic Greco Roman pagan divinities, and the latter, perhaps along with a robust tradition of medieval commentaries on Lucan's epic, set into motion the process of assigning a name to the powerful subterranean evil divinity described briefly in Lucan and Statius. The tradition itself becomes obscure for a few centuries as befits the qualities of invisibility and ineffability attributed to him by Lucan and Statius, and this continues as the name in the reconstructed exemplar of the Lactantius Placidus tradition appears as "demoirgon" and the late eleventh-century Bernard of Utrecht seems to have known him as "demorigon." This same period has produced our first evidence for the name Theodontius.149 The name Demogorgon then becomes fixed in the twelfth century (Arnulf, Digby 221). From the fourteenth century we find the name in the mythological genealogy compiled by Boccaccio's teacher, but the details are quite limited and there is virtually no description, exegesis, mythology, or history regarding Demogorgon.150 In fleshing out the history, description, and characterization of Demogorgon Boccaccio seems to have drawn directly and indirectly from a variety of Latin and Greek sources describing a powerful chthonic force whose image had not been rendered into stone or bronze, whose name was either too holy or too awesome to pronounce, whose age was primordial, whose parentage was untraceable, who was revered by primitive pagans, whose realm may once have been cosmic but ultimately settled into the lowest level of the netherworld, and whose functional capacity was 148 The bibliography is equally comprehensive.

We have seen that Boccaccio's familiarity with Augustine, Varro, and Tacitus could have familiarized him with the conception of an ancient, non-Christian invisible god, despite the predominance of contemporary anthropomorphic represen tations of Jesus. Visual iconography and written theological descriptions have differ ent and often separate traditions, but in this instance Boccaccio, judging by our investigation of his sources, was developing a pagan god that had not been previously described in detail. Rather than employ Dante's method of reconfiguring a mytho logical hybrid (e.g. Geryon at Inf. 17.1-27), or refurbishing literary descriptions of a prototypical divine personification (e.g. Fama (Rumor) in Verg. Aen. 4.173, Ovid Met. 12.39-63, Petrarch Africa 5.274-295, and Boccaccio GDG 1.10), Boccaccio created an historical account of an entirely different type of mythological divinity. Of course we do not know the text of Theodontius' account of Demogorgon, which by Boccaccio's own account was his most important source. But Pade, following Landi, is undoubtedly correct in identifying the eleventh- or twelfth-century Munich com mentary on Ovid's Metamorphoses as the terminus ante quem for Theodontius' floruit, yet none of our extent intermediate authors offers any sort of description which Boccaccio could have developed into his Genealogy text. Because the Platonic and Gnostic accounts of the Demiurge placed him first or very early in the creation process, and because these demiurgic variants were not mythological or personified characters, the Demiurge derivative known to Boccaccio would have had no ancestors, allowing him to declare that this was the progenitor of the genealogy of the pagan gods. When he tried to piece this together with additional information about the earliest divinities from unorthodox sources, these same features of the Demiurge presented a problem, that is, the non-mythological, non anthropomorphic creator who has no mythological parents also has no mythological children, as we have seen where Boccaccio writes that it is Chaos who actually produced Strife, the three Parcae, and Pan as well as Earth, and that Demogorgon fathers Polus and Phyton only insofar as he forms them from geological material.151 Nonetheless, Boccaccio thereafter treats Demogorgon as the grand progenitor of pagan divinities. According to Boccaccio's Genealogy, all the Olympian gods were descended ultimately from Demogorgon, mostly through his ninth son Erebus, who in tum produced the first Jupiter and Sky, who eventually generated the second and third Jupiters as well as Titan, Ocean, and Saturn, who will produce the lineage of all the remaining lesser homonymous Olympians.152 This turned Demogorgon into a pagan divinity sufficiently mythologized to make a significant impact on a number of subsequent monuments of Western mythological literature. 151 Boccaccio does claim [1.14.1] that Erebus was the son of Demogorgon and Earth, but he cites only his teacher Paolo da Perugia, who he said had cited Chiysippus. There is no mention of this in Paolo's own genealogy (for which, see Teresa Hankey, "Un nuovo códice delle Genealogie deorum di Paolo da Perugia," Sludi sul Boccaccio 18 (1989) 91); and in the next sentence Boccaccio equates Erebus with Tartarus, whom he had said [1.11.1] was "a son of Earth without a father." 152 Not included here are the primordial companions of Demogorgon, Eternity and Chaos, and Demogor gon's eight additional offspring.
