<plain_text><page sequence="1">Whalen Lai LOOKING FOR MR. HO PO: UNMASKING THE RIVER GOD OF ANCIENT CHINA Myths, as many scholars have pointed out, are polysemic. They always entertain-nay, even solicit-reinterpretations. Sometimes in the evolution of a myth, new meanings have been added to the old to the obscurity of the latter. This article seeks to peel away some of the layers of meaning encasing an oft-told legend of Ho Po, the River God of China. FROM THE RIDICULOUS TO THE SUBLIME In an entry under the topic "Things Ridiculous" appended to Ssu-ma Ch'ien's Historical Record, we read of the story often referred to as "Ho Po taking a bride," also known as "Hsi-men Pao throwing the female shamans (into the river)."' This is a precis: In the reign of Wei Marquis Wen (during the Warring period), Hsi-men Pao was made the official of Yeh (an ancient city by the Yellow River). Noticing the general poverty of the people, Pao inquired thereof and learned I See entries for these expressions in the Morohashi comp., Dai Kanwa Jiten (Tokyo: Teishukan Sh6ten, 1981-82), 6:116c, item 17245-221; and 10:301b, item 34763-561.

Were that not done though, the river would flood and the people would drown. On hearing that, Pao asked that he be notified when the female shamans made that marriage preparation the next time, for he too would like to attend. On that day, a crowd of people numbering two or three thousand gathered at the river bank. The head, female shaman turned out to be an old woman in her seventies. Behind her was an entourage numbering a thousand, all brightly dressed for the occasion. Pao asked if he could take a look at the prospective bride. When her carriage was brought forth, he took one peek behind the curtain and came out saying, "Surely Ho Po deserved better." He would personally see to it that a more handsome bride be found in a day or two. Meanwhile, he would trouble the shaman to go inform Ho Po of the slight delay. With that, he had the old hag thrown into the waters. Time passed. Pao could not help but notice that she was late returning. So he had one of her disciples go after her. Another female shaman was thrown in, until all three disciples went that way. There was still no sign of them coming back. "You simply cannot count on women to do things right!" Pao complained. So he had the three village elders go after the lot. Still they were late coming back. Pao was about to send in the next batch when the people, their faces ashen, begged him to reconsider. Waiting a while longer, Pao finally decided that the River God must have liked his guests so much that he had decided to entertain them till late. There was no reason for anyone to hang around and await their return. The people breathed a sigh of relief as Pao dispatched them home. Ever since then, no one ever dared mention getting a wife for Ho Po again. Later Pao dug twelve canals to divert the flood waters of the Yellow River and used it to irrigate the land, much to his fame and the prosperity of the people.2 I will show how behind the cannibal monster in this morality tale there lies a prince; behind the sacrifice of an innocent, a shamanic romance; behind the human hero, a chthonic beast. Why so? Because it appears that in the evolution of the myth, the primal symbols "that gave rise to thought" (Ricoeur) have been rethought and remade to serve newer, some say higher, ends. THE HAPPY BRIDE OF A DRACULA The above story celebrates an enlightened official's deed that put an end to a cult of sacrificing human life to appease the River God. As symbols gave rise to thought, myth gave rise to action. For centuries, whenever Confucian high culture spread into areas once dominated by shamans (Korea included), the high officials would reenact the 2 My precis and translation. 336</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions same campaign against the shamanic and proverbially licentious cult of the locals. Their triumphs would be told in dynastic histories and in local gazetteers. Even now seasoned Sinologists would cite the Hsi- men Pao story that started it all as historic fact, and as one more proof that Ho Po, an ancient god found mentioned already in the oracle bones of Shang, was once a man-eating monster. That Ho Po was part monster we would not dispute. To ward off the anger of the raging Yellow River (floods), live horses were still sacrificed to Ho Po late into the Han. But should that be taken as proof of Ho Po's barbaric nature? Not when Heaven itself also loved burnt offerings. Not when the lamb's blood should still spill at Yhwh's altar (if the temple is rebuilt). It is true that human sacrifice was abolished in the Hebraic faith with the episode of the aborted sacri- fice of Isaac, such that the story of Hsi-men Pao staying the hand of execution (as the angel did Abraham's) may just be the Chinese way of marking the historic end of such inhumane sacrifices.3 In practice, a surrogate for human sacrifice-a scapegoat of some kind-survives.4 To this day, on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, during the Dragon Boat festival and just prior to the boat race itself, sweet rice dumplings are still ceremonially dropped into the water to feed Ho Po or the river dragons. Memory of a human death survives. We are told that the dumplings are offered so that the river dragons would not dine on the body of Ch'ti Yian. Ch'u was the poet laureate of the state of Chu, alleged author of the Songs of the South, who so pined for his lord during his exile that, in a fit of despair, he threw himself into the Grotto Court Lake off the Yangtze, a sister river to the Yellow River and a domain of Ho Po still. (All rivers, streams, wells, and lakes in China are supposed to be connected by way of a subterranean ocean.)5 But was the cult of human sacrifice really stopped by a man called Hsi-men Pao? Did Pao really foil the shamans' treachery by insisting that Ho Po deserved a prettier bride than the one selected? There is a bit of a "Beauty and the Beast" half-truth in this storytelling. It is doubtful that Ho Po cared if his dinner was "the fairest of them all." King Kong prefers blondes only in our Hollywood imagination. 3 With a difference: Pao won his kudos for humanity, but Abraham earned aid (grace) for his faith in Yhwh. 4 Shamans remained active in China. They were still consulted by the court in T'ang. The systematic persecution of shamans really came with the Neo-Confucian campaigns after Sung. 5 Because the Nine Continents are supposed to rest still on water. See later discussion in this essay. For materials on this subterranean waterway, see Hung Chih-kang, Chung-kuo ti Sui-shen (Hong Kong: Lung-men, 1968), esp. for the adventures of Erh- lang shen. 337</page><page sequence="4">Looking for Mr. Ho Po Nonetheless, it is true that all gifts to gods should be blemish-free and all brides should be virgins or at least appear (dressed) snow white. And indeed it is true that brides are always the prettiest on their wedding day-if only because ritual etiquette dictates that no maiden, however fairer, should outdress the bride in her glory on what is to be her day. With that in mind, let us read the Hsi-men Pao story anew and figure out who the bride was. The reader might remember that on the day set for Ho Po's wedding, there were a good two to three thousand spectators. The whole village apparently had turned out for the event. Everything suggests that it was a time for joy; nothing indicates fear or mourn- ing. We are told that behind the leading female shaman, a train of another thousand gathered, "all brightly dressed." Of course, we can assume, not as brightly as the bride herself. Even when Pao reportedly fed the evildoers to the river monster, we are told this: First, the high priestess was thrown in. After her, went her three assistants. Then followed the three village elders.6 And had Pao not stopped, the implication is clearly that the whole one thousand "brightly dressed" entourage of the shaman would follow after. (Or be thrown in. Make a mental note of the verb "to throw"; we will see what it means later.) Any student of myth and rituals will see that the above is not a description of a single-victim sacrifice followed by a wake. People do not dress brightly at funerals. The scene is indeed that of a wedding. Ahead went the bride "in her glory," followed by a bridal train, all "brightly dressed." It was indeed Ho Po's wedding, except that in all likelihood, no female shaman was coercing a helpless maiden to her death because-as we will show presently-the bride, the one who went into the water first, was none other than the shaman herself. Far from being the ugly, old hag her enemies remember her as, she was the bewitchingly beautiful bride accompanied, in proper order, by her bridal train: three shamans as bridesmaids, then the three elders, fathers of the community giving the bride away, one thousand boys and girls, with the rest of the village, two to three thousand watching adoringly on the river bank. What we see suddenly is not the grim scene of some human sacrifice but rather an oriental Maypole festival. In the "Merrie Month of May"-summer solstice by the lunar calendar-a Chinese May Queen was leading the young men and women to a celebration of life, life's fertility, and sex. The numbers confirm this. With the 6 Witches often come in threes, as with Furies and Fates (to handle the exigencies of chance), but the san-lao or trio of elders in the story has more to do with a rural institution. 338</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions peasant Chinese household averaging around 3.7 persons each, the total village population of maybe three or four thousand yields about a quarter (one thousand) eligible, single males and females who made up the active players in the wedding game. As they frolicked in the waters, the other two-thirds to three-quarters, those too young (pre- puberty) or too old (married) watched on the shore. The Hsi-men Pao story might set Pao up as a critic of this licen- tious cult, but Confucius himself in the Analects would approve of an outing by "going down to the river in spring in the companion of a few, small boys" (too young to frolic) to watch the merry making.7 M. Granet's study of the Book of Songs has tied this passage in the Analects to the Dragon Boat festival: the river dragon would wake from his wintry sleep to cross the river at a fork in spring. Young boys and girls gathered then on the yang (sunny) and the yin (shaded) banks. The boys then "crossed the river with the live Dragon" (still a Chinese idiom) to meet with their waiting lovers on the other side. What the young ones did "in the bushes" afterward the Book of Songs can still remember.8 Until Granet so reminded us, most Con- fucians have chosen to read those "licentious" love songs in the moralizing, Han commentary style, that is, as allegories of "loyal officials pining for their beloved lord." Not unlike the fate that awaited the Song of Songs in the Bible. Or, as we will see, the Songs of the South. Granet's Confucius might watch these frolicking innocents and feel no need to intervene. Whoever rewrote the myth and the ritual of this Chinese Maypole festival into the story of Hsi-men Pao felt other- wise. Now instead of the story of a nubile May Queen "throwing" herself into the waves in an erotic fest, the female shaman-a virgin bride fit for a god-is now an ugly, old witch ("in her seventies") who was about to throw an innocent into the jaws of a monster-that is, before Pao turned the table on her and "threw" her in. From that 7 Confucius, Analects 11.26. Confucius approved of Tseng Hsi who said: "I would like, in late spring, with the spring clothes newly made, to go bathing in the River I in the company of five or six young adults and six or seven little boys to enjoy the new breeze on the rain altar and then to return home singing" (my translation). Spring is the marriage season; the new dress is for such an occasion; rain and cloud remain to this day metaphors of eros. See Granet's work cited in n. 8 below. 8 See Marcel Granet, Festivals and Songs of Ancient China (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1932); short except-from pp. 166-90-available in Laurence Thompson's selection of readings for his Chinese Way in Religion (Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth, 1979), pp. 25-31. The Dragon Boat festival, however, is found in the South; the Yellow River does not support such races, as noted by Thompson, Chinese Religion: An Introduction, 3d ed. (Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth, 1979), p. 124. But see Wolfram Eberhard, The Local Cultures of South and East China (Leiden: Brill, 1968), for its exact locale. 339</page><page sequence="6">Looking for Mr. Ho Po reconstruction, it would appear that a spring, mating ritual involving boys and girls has suffered Confucian redaction. Elements of the licentious story have now been retold. We are led to admire the judicious official Pao who routed the shamans and saved a pretty damsel in distress. In real life, we can imagine how Pao probably saved no one but his own discontent-a regular Mr. Killjoy, standing on shore, grumbling about the indecent goings-on in the river while everybody else was having a great time frolicking in the water. AN UNORTHODOX ADDENDUM TO THE Songs of the South I do not want to suggest that all festivals related to Ho Po were all fun and games. As the Yellow River was known to be both life-giving (like the Nile) and life-threatening (like the Twin River), we should expect two sides to this god's character celebrated on different occa- sions.9 Life is not all spring mating; there is always the fall sacrifice, and so on. Seasonal differences aside, that there was a gentler side to the awesome, flooding Yellow River is well attested to by the picture of Ho Po as a lover preserved in the Songs of the South. This is not surprising. The Yangtze River further south is less temperamental. The flooding there is more predictable. Or rather, it comes as fast- rising high tides, the grandeur of which is a spectacle to behold by eager watchers standing on the shores of the beautiful Grotto Lakes that act as the river's spillway. The South is also known for the beauty of its milder landscape. Its shamanic wu tradition has pro- duced the more personal "Nine Songs" in said anthology that still tells of the romance between men and gods. The shamans, male or female, seek ecstatic union with their divine lovers in the river and lakes. Here is the poem dedicated to Ho Po who, as Prince (Po) Charming, is anything but a man-eating monster. I wander with you by the Nine Mouths of the river When the storm wind rises and lashes up the waves. I ride a water chariot with a canopy of lotus; Two dragons draw it, between two water-serpents. 9 References in the following to the character of the river and its impact on religion are going to be brief, but they are meant to follow the analysis offered for the Nile and the Twin Rivers and the religions of Egypt and Mesopotamia; see Henri Frankfort et al., Before Philosophy: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Men (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1949). It appears that the Yellow River has a double character, the regularity in good years of the Nile and the threat of chaos in bad floods like the Twin Rivers. 340</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions I climb the Kun-lun mountains and look over the four quarters, And my heart leaps up in me, beating wildly. Though the day will soon end, I forget to go in my pleasure: Longingly I look back to that distant shore. Of fish-scales his palace is, with a dragon-scale hall; Purple cowrie gate-towers; rooms of pearl. And what does the god do, down there in the water? Riding a white turtle, he chases the spotted fishes. Let me play with you among the river's islets, While the swollen waters come rushing on their way! Eastward you journey, with hands stately folded, Bearing your fair bride to the southern harbour. The waters come racing up to meet me, And shoals of fishes are my bridal train.'? And here is the song dedicated to the Lady of the lake, Hsiang Chun, a picture of fair Ophelia floating on the waves on her flowery couch. The goddess comes not, she holds back shyly. Who keeps her delaying within the island. Lady of the lovely eyes and the winning smile? Skimming the water in my cassia boat I bid the Yuan and Liang still their waves And the Great River make its stream flow softly I look for the goddess, but she does not come yet. Of whom does she think as she plays her reed-pipes?'1 She is courted by male shamans as Ho Po is by the female ones. In China, mountains are associated with asceticism as waters are with eros. In the story of Hsi-men Pao, Pao was the hero who saved the maiden and denied Ho Po his bride. There is an earlier variation of this myth in the career of Archer I who also made a fool of Ho Po. A combination of Prometheus and Gilgamesh, the archer had stolen the fire from Heaven and taught men how to hunt. Later on, he would find the herb of immortality but then lose it to his wife, Heng O.12 In 10 "The River Earl," Songs of the South, trans. David Hawkes (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1985), pp. 114-15.

I shall be introducing this in a critical book review "The Chinese Frog Princess: Recent PRC Studies on Chang-o (the Moon Goddess)." 341</page><page sequence="8">Looking for Mr. Ho Po between, the archer supposedly seduced a river nymph. Since all nymphs are consorts of Ho Po, this made the River God angry. But the archer shot the jealous river dragon in one eye and turned him into a cyclops. The seduction is a variant of the shamanic romancing of nymphs; the wounding of Ho Po is a variant of Pao denying Ho Po his bride. These archaic gods need "food and sex" as much as men do. Their sustenance depends on having a meal and having progeny.13 Before moving on, there is this curious recurrence to attend to. We read that Pao "threw" the shamans into the river; that the shaman would "throw" herself (into the arms of Ho Po); and that Ch'ii Yuan also "threw" himself into the same. But did he? Now we are told the Dragon Boat festival commemorates Ch'u Yuan. This is not true. The festival predated Ch'ii, who was not the first loyal official to drown himself at the Grotto Lake. Wu-tzu Hsu preceded him and the Dragon Boat festival is said to commemorate him also. Hsii, however, was not a poet. That Ch'u was a poet is a fact; that he drowned himself might however be fiction. The fiction could have risen this way: the Confucians in Han had inherited the Songs of the South, but they had problems interpreting the erotic Nine Songs. Unable to accept them as songs of men wooing the gods into love, they did what they did best. As with similar songs in the Book of Songs, they read them allegorically, as poems of a loyal official pining for his beloved lord. One thing however leads to another. Pressed at the time to name an author to the collection, they settled on Ch'u Yian, the most famous of the southern poets and a known loyalist. Ch'i died in exile. But did he die by "throwing" himself into the Grotto Lake? Maybe not. It could well be that since shamans are known for "throwing" themselves into the water in search of their "beloved," the Han scholars had inferred that the author of the Nine Songs also threw himself into the lake out of an undying love for his lord. If that is the case, myth not only inspired history. It also helped to rewrite it.14 DE-EUHEMERIZING THE HERO OF MANY FACES While we are at it-deconstructing the Ho Po myth-perhaps we may venture further and also ask: Who really was Hsi-men Pao? So 13 The oblique reference here is to Kao-tzu's thesis that "desire for food and sex is (human) nature" in Mencius 6A.4. Early gods are the same. Ho Po needs his food and his bride. 14 It inspired history when it led Confucian officials into persecuting shamans; it rewrote history when it misled them to model Ch'u Yiian's death after a shamanic myth-ritual. 342</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions 4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6 FIG. 1.-The Lo Shu "River Diagram" far, we have followed convention and accepted him as a Confucian official. Actually there is no way to know if he belonged to the school of the ju scholars. He makes as good, even better, a Mohist. He found fault with ritual expenses. He was the people's hero who even killed off, to wit, the clergy and the ruling class (the shamans and the village elders). Pardon that overreading, but elsewhere the Mohist connection is indeed there. It is in the ending of the story: "Later Pao dug twelve canals to divert the flood waters (of the Yellow River) ... much to his fame and to the prosperity of the people." This reads too similarly to the career of the Sage-King Yii, the Mohist hero, who also stemmed the flood by deepening the canals, to be a mere coin- cidence. The myth of Hsi-men Pao could well be a variant of the myth of Sage Yii. The number of canals dug by Pao (twelve) may be our proof that it is. We now know that Sage Yu stemmed the flood of chaos and reestablished the order of cosmos by carving out Nine Continents in accordance to the Lo Shu or River Writing. The River Writing is the magic square of three: nine squares with the yin-yang numerical values and the rows, columns, and diagonals all adding up to "fif- teen" (see fig. 1). Bounded by the water of chaos on four sides, the nine continents are separated from one another by twelve canals.15 Apparently Pao followed this same plan. He is a later-day Yu. 15 Count the lines between the numbers, not the lines of the outer square which borders on the ocean. When Sage Yi banished the dragons of the flood beyond the Nine Continents, he was in fact sending them back to this sea of chaos from where they came. 343</page><page sequence="10">Looking for Mr. Ho Po If the reader would grant that Pao's defeat of Ho Po could well be a replay of Yii's triumph over the Great Flood, then this next pos- sibility might be accepted: that just as the Great Yu was once a prehuman fish-dragon (the name Yii is homophonic with "fish"; the picturogram Yii is that of a small "dragon") before he was euhe- merized, Hsi-men Pao might go back to some prehuman form once he is de-euhemerized. But what might this form be? To see that, we have to go behind the myth of Yii to the myth of his father Hsi. This is because although Yii might be the hero who pushed back the waters and divided the land into the Nine Continents, it is Hsi who created the land masses in the first place. Since I have analyzed this aspect of Hsi elsewhere, I will only summarize my findings.'6 Hsi is the "Earth Diver" in Chinese mythology. Earth Divers are divine beings or demigods who dived into the primeval waters and came up with a tiny bit of earth. This earth then expanded and created the first land. Hsi, a Divine Tortoise, did indeed gain pos- session of such a magical dirt and reclaimed land from the waters. Normally though, the Divine Tortoise should retrieve that earth from the bottom of the ocean or lake. However, with the rise of the Sky God in China, a new twist was given to the story. Hsi's earth-creating deed earned the wrath of Heaven. He was judged stubborn and proud. With Heaven overseeing and owning the earth, it is now said that Hsi had stolen the magical earth from the Lord on High. In this, he had the help of an accomplice, the Swallow.'7 The story of Hsi ends now with the Heavenly Lord discovering the theft and snatching the earth back from Hsi, thus dooming Hsi's attempt to push back the Flood (primeval waters) to failure. Hsi was then executed, and his son Yii was recruited to complete the task. The Hsi material is relevant for our study here because it reveals this: at one time, the basic conflict in the world was between Land and Water. Land and Water were the defining realities. It is only with 16 Whalen Lai, "Icons and Iconoclasm: The Earth Diver Hsi in Taoistic Recall," Taoist Research 1, no. 2 (1989): 28-36. On the Earth Diver myth-type, see Alan Dundee, "Earth-Diver: Creation of the Mythopoeic Male," in Sacred Narratives, ed. Alan Dundee (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1984), pp. 270- 94. On Hsi, see Mori Yasutaro, "Keiju genshi" [Origin of Yu and Hsi] within his collected essays, Kottei Densetsu: Kodai Chagoku shinwa no kenkyu (Kyoto: Kyoto joshi daigaku jimbun gakkai, 1970), now available in Chinese translation by Wang Hsiao-lien (Wang Hsiian), as Chung-kuo ku-tai shen-hua yen-chiu (Taipei: Ti-p'ing- sen, 1974). 17 The Swallow, a bird of the air, was not punished by the Lord of Heaven. As the Otter (an alias of Hsi) builds his habitat by diving for mud to build his dam, so the Swallow also builds his nest with mud carried in his beak. Do not take these species so specifically. The Swallow is the dark bird or hsiian-liao which is yiian-liao or ur-bird, just as Hsi is the Yuan-yu or ur-fish, the sum of all fishes. 344</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions the rise of the cult of Heaven that the two poles of reality are defined, even now, as Heaven and Earth. The rise of the anthropomorphic Sky Gods is often (not always) accompanied by the demotion of the zoomorphic chthonic deities. The aquatic demigods are counted now within the latter. An example of that would be the rise of the Olympians. With that, Neptune was banished by Zeus to ruling the waters. Likewise, it is conceivable that Ho Po, perhaps a major deity at one point, too was demoted. Now he has to be satisfied with being Po (Duke) under a Heaven that claims exclusive right to being Ti (Emperor). In this new divide of Heaven and Earth, very often the old conflict of Land and Water is forgotten. In China, the Taoists manage to keep the older memory alive when they revere the Three Officers or Origins as those of Heaven, Earth, and Water-not the triad of Heaven, Earth, and Man that most Confucians prefer.18 Many statements in the last paragraph are sweeping and have to be defended elsewhere in greater detail against possible challenges. They are offered only as linkages to what follows. It would appear that Land and Water, symbolizing two primal realities, were and still are represented by the icons of a land animal and a sea creature. The creature of the Waters, Ho Po, was at one point still subhuman or half-human. Nowadays he is usually associ- ated with the dragon, but the classic Chinese dragon is more a Han creation. The ur-form of Ho Po was more likely to be either a snake or a fish. The snake form is found in Shang bronzes, but the Book of History remembers the Sage Yu looking into the water one day and seeing a being with "the face of a man and a body of a fish." This, I believe, is an ur-form of Ho Po. And it is one captured in the Neolithic pottery shown in figure 2, the earliest form of Ho Po that I know. 19 In the binary structure and division of Land and Water, the watery fish (nowadays the Green Dragon) is placed in the East and a land animal (nowadays the White Tiger) is placed in the West. This forms the basic Life-Death or Spring-Autumn axis. Mediating the poles was the Tortoise, alias the Earth Diver, chosen because it is an amphibious being who could live in the waters as well as on land. The 18 The T'ai-p'ing-ch'ing observes the rites of the Three Officers. A person confesses his sins before these three lords of the universe. And there are still the San-yuan festivals in the Chinese year, the Middle Origin being China's "All Souls' Day" (over- laps with the p 'an festival, Japan's Obon). 19 No relative dating of these icons is being intended. The fish design on the red pottery may predate the snake motif on the shang bronzes, but the potter knew of meander (snake) motifs and the Shang bronzes fish (crocodile) designs. We also have very early sun-bird motifs in Chinese pottery. 345</page><page sequence="12">Looking for Mr. Ho Po FIG. 2.-The Fish with a Human Face or Sage Yu ("fish") in his prehuman (fish-body) form.

Note: Ch'i, the son of Yii, was said to be born with two tiny green dragons dangling from his ears. Compare that to the two fish nibbling at the side of the human face in this figure. The drawing in the figure is based on a photograph from Kwang-chih Chang, The Archaeology of Ancient China (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univer- sity Press, 1977), p. 110. Swallow, which as the sun-bird was affiliated with the Sky God, now shares the North-South axis with the Tortoise (see fig. 3). Since we are dealing with the earlier phase of Land-Water polarity, we may put this other axis on hold at the moment. Given the Land versus Water divide and knowing that Ho Po was the Fish, one would expect Ho Po's foe to be a Tiger of sorts. Is it surprising or just fitting that the name of our human hero, Hsi-men Pao, reads literally "the Leopard (pao) of the West Gate (hsi-men)"? This kin of the tiger falls neatly to the West. Not only that, the term "west gate" is a euphemism for the "portal of death."20 The conflict between a human hero Hsi-men Pao and an aquatic monster Ho Po may be known to most men as a social conflict between a Confucian 20 Later, Death is moved to North in the expanded, four-direction scheme, the direction of the Dark Warrior (tortoise-snake). 346</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions (Tortoise) Land Animal Watery Fish (Swallow) FIG. 3. The animals of the four cardinal directions official (faithful to Heaven) and the licentious shamans (still tied to chthonic gods), but before that conflict was euhemerized and moral- ized, it was at a more archaic level an ancient antagonism of Land and Water, Life and Death, Spring and Autumn, alias, Fish and Leopard. And just as Yii the Fish could become in time the dragonic Sage-King Yii, Pao the Leopard too evolved one day into Pao the Official. Can we unmask Pao the man and retrieve Pao the leopard? The possibility is there since most Sinologists are familiar with a cousin of Hsi-men Pao who began her career as a tigress but ended in be- coming a fully humanized goddess-namely, Hsi-wang-mu, the Queen Mother of the West. Before she became the matronly dowager we now picture her as, she was remembered as being "like man" (not yet fully human), with the teeth of a tiger and the neigh of a beast. Like other early deities, in pictures of her she is often dressed in leopard skins. Take away the apparel (a rationalization by the artist), and we should see her true form-a leopard. The exposed teeth mean an open mouth. This is none other than the "portal of death" because, as the Chinese Sphinx, Hsi-wang-mu is the Great Mother who eats her human offspring, not actually as a cannibal but in order that man- kind ("to dust") would be reborn anew ("from dust"). No scholar has made the following connection, but I believe we have a "photograph" of Hsi-wang-mu in the famous Shang Yu bronze shown in figure 4: a tender, loving, big cat of a deity, mouth opened wide, teeth exposed, gingerly holding between her jaws the head of a pygmy of a man who is clinging lovingly to her.

The iconic motif of that gaping mouth, symbol of the portal of death (hsi-men), is now better known to us as the mask of the t'ao-t'ieh, the Glutton, itself made up of, possibly, two leopards (pao) facing one another, found depicted prominently on Shang-Chou ritual bronzes but increasingly assigned in later times to being just decorations on tombs (see fig. 5). Demoted by Heaven, this chthonic beauty-monstrosity is a later perception-was once the source of all life. Now it survives only as an agent of death. It appears as the dog at the gate of Hades or as the winged griffin on Roman sarcophagi (Greek sarkos + phagien, "eater of flesh"). It is the Hindu Jalandhara, called also Kirttimukha, "face of glory," and it appears as the gargoyle on church steeples. It is often the guardian of the dead or made the guardian of temples, its awe- 348</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions FIG. 5.-The T'ao-t'ien animal mask, two leopards facing one another and the insatiable beast whose mouth (the portal of death) devours all. The drawing in the figure is based on a diagram in Joseph Campbell, The Mythic Image (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1974), fig. 109. some face there to scare away evil.21 In China, Hsi-wang-mu's cousin, our Hsi-men Pao, survived in his leopard form as the former, as the tomb figure known simply as the tu-ming beasts, life-size, sitting dogs or leopards with a human face and a single horn. To me, this is the last vestige of Hsi-men Pao as the "Leopard of the Portal of Death" found in T'ang before it disappeared altogether from even the store of Chinese grave goods. In conclusion, we have taken a seemingly improbable journey back in time, unmasking the two key players in the legend of Ho Po and Hsi-men Pao. If the two now appear anything but like the River God or the Confucian official we started with, that is due to the accretion of newer meanings overlaid on the ancient ones. What was once the myth of the rebirth of all life in spring symbolized by the awakened dragon and then the return of all life in fall to gates of death symbolized by an all-devouring chthonic beast22 (fig. 6) had become in later, creative review, the story of conflict between Land and Water 21 For a Jungian reading of this archetype, see Joseph Campbell, The Mythic Image, Bollingen Series C (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1974), pp. 104-40, which has great pictures. For a criticism of Campbell, see Robert A. Segal, "Joseph Campbell's Theory of Myth," in Dundee, ed. (n. 16 above), pp. 256-69. 22 Like Jalandhara, the T'ao-t'ieh is remembered imperfectly as another insatiable flesh-devouring glutton. It finally dined on itself, swallowing itself from the tail up, such that it is now an animal mask of half a face without a body. What that signals is a variation of the snake biting its own tail, an earth deity endlessly swallowing and regenerating life. 349</page><page sequence="16">Looking for Mr. Ho Po FIG. 6.-A Tu-ming beast is glazed pottery ware from a T'ang tomb and an eighteenth-century Ch'ing dynasty survival of it. Both are later images of Hsi-men Pao. From the "Son of Heaven" art exhibition at the Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus, Ohio, 1989. with a temporary triumph for the legged creature over its scaly foe. Until finally, in a still later conflation of autumnal sacrifice with the spring mating, we have the edifying tale of the defeat of the life- threatening Ho Po and his cohorts, the shamans, at the hands of a fully euhemerized and enlightened Hsi-men Pao, a hero of Confucian humanism. Such is the polysemic nature of our myth, rewritten and reinterpreted in time past, deconstructed and read anew in the present review. University of California, Davis 350</page></plain_text>
