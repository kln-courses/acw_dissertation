<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Advaita philosophy of Sankara. Professor Harnlal Ν. Dvivedi. It is more important to understand what Saitkara taught, than to detennine when he lived. Leaving, therefore, the questionofÄzn kara's date to abler hands, I content myself with the simple attempt of explaining, so fax as I can, bis philosophy and doctrines. Some of OUT principal guides for a thorough elacidation of the subject are the PaiichadaM, the Upadeiasahasii, the Advaita — Svdrdjya — and Naishkarmya-siddhis, the Veddntasara, the Vedanta- Paribkasha, the Chitsukhi and the many minor poems of 7أ،ءألعمح·،، and of his followers. But some of these are highly overburdened with the growth of later technicalities, and do not afford US ftdl scope for studying SanJcara in his original simple light. These, and all works bearing on the Ve dänta, are based upon, what are called the Prasthdnatraya — the Brahmaputras, the Bhagavadgita, the Upanishads. Every philosopher, to be called an achdrya, the founder ofareligion, has to comment upon these three, and to explain them in conformity with his philosophy, and without contradicting one another. äankara, VaUahha, Rdmänuja, Md dhva, and almost all founders of religions have done so. As Sams krita began to be displaced by the Prakritas, several religious inter preters interposed themselves between these masters and the public, and taught the old religion under a new name. Among these may Wiener Zeitschr. f.٥. Kunde d. Morgen!, n. Bd. 7</page><page sequence="2">96 Manilal ν. Dvivedi. be mentioned the names of Kabira, Dadu, Nanaka, Chaitanya, Saha jananda, and many others in succession. It is, therefore, possible to classify tbe apparently interminabie sects ofthelndianreligion, under three ΟΓ four principal heads, the Jainas and the Bauddhas complet ing the list. It is piain, then, that we shall be able to understand ٥ankara best through his commentaries on the Prasthanatraya, and chiefly through that on the Brahmasutras. It is impossible to proeeed in Our inquiry without trying, at the outset, to comprehend, the relation in which the Sutras stand to the general mass of religious literature. The Vedas are, indeed, the fountainhead of all that underlies Indian Society in its widest sense. The nature-worship of the Veda was, however, not sufficient to satisfy the wants of inquiring minds; and even in the redte period itself, hymns like the Purushasukta point to those early glimmerings, which proclaim the approaching dawn of Trath. The thought thus awakened crystallizes itself in the Upani shads, the end of the Veda (Vedanta), both historically and spiri tually; as the spirit of seeking after God beyond His works, becomes formulated into a System of ceremonial worship in the intermediate Brahmanas. Then follows a period, when, for ready reference and easy application, we find the Brahmanas reduced to short Sutras or mnemonic rules; and the Upanishads also must have obtained simi lar help at the same time. But by this time the great problem of life had engaged various intellects, and the DarSanas were gradually forming: chief among them the Mhrmrhsa or inquiry into the expla nation and force of Vedic texts. As the Mimdmsa of the ceremonial came to be caUed the prior or PurvaMimämsä, so the Mimdmsa of the final aim of all knowledge, obtained the epithet Uttara-Mimdmsd, or the final inquiry into the nature of the Godhead, — thus tacitly ad mitting between the two the relation of subordinate and principal. Clear ly, the teaching of the Upanishads had begun to influence the whole range of Indian thought; and religion, which, in India, means not theology pure and simple but philosophy, politics, morals and the like, was moulded in accordance therewith. It became diificult for the rays</page><page sequence="3">The Adv_ta PHILOSOPHY OF 97 .دسءسممح of Light to penetrate to the deep recesses of the populär mind; and the Smjitis and the Puraiias served as proper lenses for the purpose. It is remarkable that these rays, though partaking of the colour and form of the medium through which they pass, do not fail to con vince any observer of their unmistakable presence in the darkest chaos, or in the most pleasant and soothing scenery. Thus were the Smjitis an intermediate help to the understanding of the Vedic reli gion; as the Puraiias were to the Smjitis, but neither were free from the control of the Upanishads. The most populär of the Purdnas, the Bhagavata, for example, teaches in every Word of it the Aupaniskada doctrine of Brahma, but unfoids it in a manner best suited to the capacity of hearers in "this iron or kali age". This is not the place for it, or I would fain go into an analysis of this masterpiece of po pular religious exposition, explaining how the whole life of Krishna is but another way of representing the various phases of Brahma vidya. And such explanation would be no abnormal Stretch of the imagination, when we already have similar explanations of whole Puranas and poems, by commentators of no mean importance. If, again, the ceremonial govemed by the Spiritual has in this manner found various Puranas to explain the principal doctrines to the multi tude, the Upanishads also have a whole Purdna, the Atma-Purana, devoted entirely to them, giving a populär explanation of the higher philosophy. Thus all branches of Indian religious literature unmista kably point to the Upanishads as their guide, and we can now un derstand what place the Brahmasütras, which put forth a consistent explanation of the philosophy ofthe Upanishads, hold in the religious literature of India. In India there are so many works assigned to a Vydsa, that it becomes difficult, nay almost impossible, to determine which Vydsa is meant to be the author of the Brahmasutras. κ it is the Vydsa known as Vedavydsa in the Bhagavata, he is undoubtedly the same as Bddarayana, son of Paraiara. The Purdnas declare that he lived in the beginning of the Dvdparayuga, which we must, in this place, leave to represent what period of time it may. 7*</page><page sequence="4">98 Manilal ν. Dvtvedi. Iii the Sutras themselves we find the name Badarayapa men tioned at least seven times;1 and the Bhashyakära puts in several opinions in the name of a Vyasa or Vedavyäsa,2 frequently in his Bhäshya. The name Klishpa Dvaipayana3 also occurs many times, but the Bhäshyakära always refers to the author as Acharya.4 All these references prove that Vyäsa, the author of the Sutras, is none other than the Badarayaiia of the Bhägavata. The fact that he has men tioned his own name in his Sutras, need not puzzle US, after Our knowledge of the practice of old writers, in such works as the Apa stamba-Grihya-Sütras, of putting in their favourite, but comparatively new opinions in their own name, at places where similar populär opinions form the subject of dispute. Even ؛؛؛afikara's distinguishing the author as Acharya is not sufficient to disprove this fact after the positive manner in which he declares this acharya to be none other than Badarayana, in at least two places.5 We are thus able to say with confidence that the Sutras belong to none other than Bäda räyana Vyasa, and that, therefore, the arguments advanced in some quarters against this view are not sufficiently conclusive. Before trying to analyse what Sankara teaches, we must under stand his Position as a religious teacher. The Vedic religion was essentially a rehgion of ceremonial — a Karmakanda, confining itself to the philosophy of rewards and punishments commensurate to one's Karman, which if good would lead to Heaven. But several philosophers had already begun to meditate upon the nature of the surnmum bonum, and the way of attaining to it. To this spirit of in quiry may be traced the origin of the celebrated Darianas. We, however, do not find any clear denunciation of the Vedic ritual in any one of them,5 but in the Upanishads, which plainly declare all hap 1 I. 3. 26; I. 3. 33; m. 2. 41; in. 4. 1; m. 4. 8; in. 4. 9; IV. 3. 15 etc. ء XI. 3. 29; I. 3. 33; π. 1. 12; π. 3. 47; ΠΙ. 1. 14 etc. 5 χπ. 3. 29; m. 3. 32. ٠ XI. 4. 12; π. 4. 20; m. 3. 1; m. 3. 24 etc. ٠ Comm.

Still the revolt against the religion of Kaiman was not complete. It was reserved for Buddha to proclaim in un mistakable language the illusoriness of worldly possessions, including even that Heaven which the Karmakanda promised to its devotees and to establish instead, Νιτνάηα ΟΓ the total absence of all worldly illusions, as the State of perfect bliss. His was a Code of high mora lity and universal brotherhood not only of men, but of the whole creation from the tiny straw to the proud human lord treading heed lessly upon it The Gospel of Buddha found its adherents, but it was a breaking away from the religion of the Karmakanda, far too abrupt and perhaps too unpractical to reconcile all grades of intellect to its truthfulness. Kumarila tried to restore the dying Karmakanda to its former Position, but it was Sankara, who suppressed with a sure hand the rising revolt. He brought the Upanishads to the front, and indirectly accepting the sublime philosophy of Buddha, effected a reconciliation between Karman und Jiiana, by showing that the former is a fit preparation for the latter. While effecting this, he was not indifferent to the disaffection in his own ranks. There werc the various Dar&amp;anas, which though setting up an ideal slightly differcnt from the Vedic one, were, yet, allies neither of Buddha nor of&amp;aiikara. έαίύζαια paid the best attention possible to these, and his philosophy would appear in the sequel to be mainly evolved from them. Thus the hand of the Master restored peace throughout the region of philo sophy, by reconciling the cravings for a higher and truer ideal with the ritual of the Veda, and thus significantly showing that the Veddnta was really the Uttara-mimdiiisa sequel (Jiiana) to the Püwa-Mimämsä or preliminary (Karmakanda). In the extreme south where Buddha's voice had perhaps never reached, and iSailkara's teachings had not had any firm footing, the Karmakanda still continues in all its various forms, and several sects continue to abuse Saidcara as a Prackckkanna Buddha, a Buddha in a Brahmanic garb. No clearer commentary is necessary on the work of Saiikara. We are, now, indeed, in a Position to understand the philo</page><page sequence="6">100 Manilal ν. Dvivedi. sophy of the Upanishads as explained by ßartkara. In as much as £aükara's pbilosophy is an outcome of previous speculations, we shall bave to go, though cursorily, Over the whole field of Indian religious thought. We have Seen how the Vedic ceremonial was gradually yielding under its own weight, and speculations about the nature of life and happiness were monlding themselves into fresh theories of worship and conduct. The problem, then, was the same as it is now; and the fact no doubt bears ample testimony to the hopelessness of Our ever succeeding in an universally acknowledged Solution of its character. And yet who will not agree with Lessing when he says: 'If the all powerful Being holding in one hand, Truth, and in the other, the search for Truth, Said to me, 'choose', I would answer Hirn, 'o, all-powerful, keep for Thyself the Truth, but leave to me the search for it, which is the better for me.' The search for the Truth is thus perpetually pleasant; and we are now so nearer to the Truth than when we know that the Truth, which the keeps to Hirn seif, is not independent of Hirn. The problem roughly stated is an explanation of the phenomena of the objects of Nature, in their relation to or as contradistinguished from the almost inexplicable idea of life, and an enunciation of those principles of conduct which should lead to happiness true and real; in other words, the question of the much vexed inquiry into the nature of subject and object, spirit1 and matter, and the subsequent bearing of the results on the question of morals. I shall confine myself in this paper only to the first part of the subject. The followers of the Nyaya System of philosophy hoped, by cultivating the Instruments of knowledge2 — Perception, Inference, Analogy, Testimony — to reach final beautitude, by right inquiry. They generalized from the phenomena of life to an extra-cosmic Deity ١ This is a very misleading Word, but I have nsed it thronghout as syno nymous with that phenomenon of life which we distinguish from matter.</page><page sequence="7">The Advaita PHILOSOPH? OF ؛؛؛AÜKARA. 101 of superhuman powers commanding OUT homage and worship. The inanimate universe, including the soul and mind of man, they left to itself, and believed it to be the result of an act of Divine creatiom The VaiSeshikas accepted the generalizations of Gautama, but went ء Step further in analysing the nature of material existence. They acknowledged the existence of an extra-cosmic Deity, but like Gas sendi, nearly dropped the idea and busied themselves with the atoms and their nature. With them the universe began with atoms — in finite and eternal, moved by the will of the Divine Power. Thus as Gautama built up the metaphysics, Kanada supplied the physics of a philosophy which generally goes under the name of Nydya. It is enough for OUT purpose to State only these fundamental principles, for they enable US to understand what explanation the Nydya puts forth regarding the relation of matter and spirit. Α philosophy built upon mere abstractions and generalizations from phenomena, which can in reality never be individually generalized from, must result either in pure Atheism, ΟΓ anthropomorphic Deism. 'Generalization so far from apprehending reality, is a process, which takes US away from it, and the further it advances, the more abstract Our thought becomes, the further do we recede from the real objective truth of things.'1 If the Nydya and Vaiseshika, thus, represent the positive side of the method of abstract generalization, the Ckdrvdkas (and the ههسعر), represent the negative aspect. They were not far from the modern materialists when they maintained life) thought or energy to be the result of material Organisation, but their philosophy made few disciples and converted none. All experience is in favour of declaring that dead matter as such is never capable of producing life, and even the best representatives of modern physical Science stand confessed of their ignorance of the real nature of matter and energy per ءء, at the altar of eternal Truth. Observation has proved it beyond doubt that every atom of matter is full of energy in one form or another; and it is evident that the very fundamental the conception of matter Principal Caird, 'Pbilosophy of Religion".</page><page sequence="8">102 Manilal Ν. Dvivedi. must imply that of Mind. So that instead of postponing the appea rance of Mind to the last stage of material Organisation, it is more consistent with reason to regard it as the very beginning. The Nyaya had done this, but the intermeddling of a God isolated from His creation did not satisfy subsequent reasoners: such philosophy being subversive ofthat real knowledge, which must by the very conditions of knowledge or thought look upon thought and being as inseparable. It is in some such train of reasoning that we find an explanation of the Purusha and Prakriti of KapUa's Safikhya. The Saftkhyas had advanced further, if advance it may be called, than the Vaiieskikas in their analysis of matter, and had demonstrated a theory of evolution, anything more entirely novel than which even the Vedanta has not to teach. They postulated Prakriti or undifferentiated cosmic matter as the etemal basis of cosmic evolution; and they definitely enume rated the various evolving stages of this matter with its properties, being here upon called the Sankhyas. They were, however, conscious of the impossibility of postulating matter without mind, and they, therefore, laid down an etemal Union between Purusha or the Eter nal Mind, and Prakriti in all its stages of evolution. They attributed no functions to Purusha, thus avoiding the mistake committed by the Naiyayikas; and regarded the evolutions of Prah-iti for this Purusha who was ever in it but never of it, trying in this manner to satisfy the necessity of Philosophie thought. The Safdchyas will, thus, appear to be nearer the Truth, nearer because they were, by postulating two entities in the form of Prakriti and Purusha, both interdepende)it so to speak, indirectly precluding the possibility of Moksha, and ini tiating a principle which would lead to false results in practical ethics. Sattvaguna or purity, is after all a kind of material purity in as much as that guna is inseparable from Prakriti, and to set this up as the Standard to which man should ever try to reach, is only to point a way to re-incarnation or fresh evolution (of the individual seif), and misery. Contemplation of Prakriti can raise the contemplator no higher than Prakriti, the source of all mundane existence and pain. Patanjali not satisfied with the practical side of the Saidchya, set up a kind</page><page sequence="9">The Advaita PHILOSOPHY OF 103 ·م،أدءلمحعة of training, generally known as Yoga, for attaining the State of eter nal bliss, and postulated a kind of Iswara for purposes of contem plation. His Yoga led to marveUous physical results, but nothing beyond. It again landed the Student in Prakriti, only on a higher stage of it This difficulty is satisfactorily solved in the Veddnta, or the upaniskads, as explained by Sailkara.1 As already stated we shaU confine Ourselves chiefly to the Brahmasiitras and the commen tary of äankara, in deriving Our explanations.2 It is easy to understand the Position of Sahkara, and the basis of his philosophy after this introduction. Sailkara was truly the evo lution of his own age; and yet one cannot detect wherein his philo sophy fails to satisfy the requirements of the advanced thinking of the present Century. He grasped the Problem in all its clearness and understood the failures of his predecessors and contemporaries. He perceived that the conception of life and matter hitherto advanced by various thinkers was not endorsed by the Upaniskads, and was in no way logical or in accordance with the facts of the question. Prof. Tyndall was not aware that he was expressing, only in other words, a difficulty feit by a powerful thinker nearly one thousand years before him, when he Said in his address to the British Asso ciation 'Two courses and two only are possible. Either let US open Our doors freely to the conception of Creative acts, or abandoning them, let US radicallg change Our noticms ٠/ matter'. The Italics are mine.

Dvivedi. for human intelligence to attempt. It must remain an open qucstion whether Saikkara taught any practical method for an analytical view of life-organisation, but we are concemed onJy with the metaphysical aspect of the question. Sanfcara was certain 1 of the futility of having recourse to acts of special creation for an explanation of the pheno mena of life, for he looked upon such a theory as nothing short of an imbecile confession of the impossibility of that something inherent in the very nature of man, which compels him to inquire and search for God in His works. He was early conscious of the impossibility, demonstrated in recent times by Mill and other thinkers, of recon ciling the existence of evil with the existence of an extra-cosmic God, all-powerful, all-knowing, aJl-merciful, and all-good.2 Nor did he lend countenance to that theory of the relativity of human know ledge, which in the hands of Hamilton and more decidedly in those of his theological Interpreter Mansel, resulted in pushing aside reason from the domain of religion, and in those of H. Spencer led to the setting up of a negative 'Unknown', as the source of all creation and the origin of a religion based simply on the awe of a stupendous and impenetrable idea. The materialistic theory which denves all life from matter is, indeed, the main point of his attack in his com mentary on the Sittras.3 Even the monads of Leibnitz were not suf ficient for the practical ends قرaiikara had in view. To the mind of äafikara the very idea of relation implied something beyond relation, the very idea of a centre implied a circumference, the very Word outward implied an inward, the very thought of the mirage implied a substratum — ground saturated with Salt, the conception of matter implied mind, thought implied being. To think of the Infinite, some thing other than finite, something beyond conditions, is to think the unthinkable, in as much as thinking means nothing but conditioning. Such a conception of the Infinite with which several eminent Euro pean scholars have tried to explain the idea of Brahma is simply an .SrakmaSitrcu, π, 2, 37 a comm. et seq ،-.٠٠،:؛</page><page sequence="11">The Advaita philosophy of ،؛ANKARA. 105 impossibility, a contradiction IQ terms. Tboaght (Jiidna) can never transcend itself, and it is in thought that we find that something which is at once related and not related, conditioned and not con ditioned; and in which everything is lield together. That method of false abstraction which can result either in anthropomorphic deism or pure atheism, Sankara. completely renounced; and postulated a something, which I am afraid to call an Entity, and yet which is an Entity in all entities, in which all relations melt away, all conditions become annulled, the notions of matter and mind are held in one com pact unity. This something is nothing and everything, beyond thought and yet within it. It, indeed, is the very basis of individual consciousness, or individual consciousness is rather its manifestation in organised matter. It is the permanent substratum of material manifestations, with whose variety of changes it has, however, nothing to do. Thus though always in matter, mundane existence can effect no change either for weal or for woe, in it. He accepted material evolution in the widest sense of the term, accompanied even by psychical evolution, but all this had nothing to do with the unchangeable witness of them all — Atman or Brahman. In fact so indescribable is this ultimate factor that it may be noted even äa-äkara never describes it but by the impersonal It. Even the Upanishads, at their best, declare it to be, not this, nor that, nor that; and say that speech and mind are alike unable to lay hold of it. ^ankara directed the attention of man to his own consciousness, and taught that it is nothing but the universal con sciousness speaking through him, and that it has no share in the changes to which its material coil is subject, and of which it is conscious. The universe is Brahma — something very great, com bining all thought and being —; and this Brahma is ever free, ever happy, ever existent, ever enlightened. Thus to speak, even at the risk of being misunderstood, in clear language, Sankara recognises matter as full of life — a life on which all phenomena of matter are hung as upon a string;؛ life ever love and blessedness, never .،،Bh. Gi ,٢١٢ آأسآآآ</page><page sequence="12">106 Manilal ν. Dvivedi. affected by the properties of matter, which is its coordinate and not the cause. Of aU ignorance and its consequences, he leaves Prakriti — matter — to take care by its inherent properties, but the eternal, unchangeable Purusha, Brahma, life, has nothing whatever to do with it. Yet both never exist apart: but pure unalloyed happiness arises not from contemplating upon the changeful counterpart of Brahma, but upon its permanent and unique light which illumines all. We have, now, Seen that Brahma is the Highest Existence, of and through which is all knoxcledge — the essence of knowing. As all existence is, as it were, suspended from it. there can be nothing in the uni verse, which can be a stranger to anything, and which cannot be held fast to itself in a Union above aD worldly relations: hence Brahma in all love, which is the highest bliss. It is therefore des cribed, not defined, as ءهء existence, chit knowledge, and dnanda bliss. To define the real nature of Prakriti and Purusha, in the words of خailkara, they are both anadi, without beginning, and anirvachaniya1 — indescribable. No research can ever reveal to US the ultimate cha racter of either. Brahma is the real Ens, and its inseparable coordi nate prakriti, is ever changeful, never known in its full form, de pendent for its manifestation on Brahma, therefore, all Ignorance — ajiidna — and darkness. Hence in their pure technical language the Vedantins always argue, vainly as it may appear to some, against the Naiydyikas that ajiidna is a positive substance, and not a mere negation of jiidna. Separating the Word from the thought we can easily understand that the ajiidna of the Veddntins means matter, which cannot be the negation of anything in as much as its possible counter-entity Brahma (jiidna) is not apart from it. So, also adhydsa or false Impression, is but the influence of the two factors of the Totality on each other: — the one presenting the other as part and parcel of itself. The relation of Prakriti and Brahma is explained in yet another manner, highly illustrative of the capacity of the Aryan 1 This Word in its higbly technical sense means when applied to changeful Prakriti a something whicb is neitber eternally existent, nor nonexistent, but of which we are conscions only in the present viz matter (Prakriti).</page><page sequence="13">The Advaita philosophy of ة ANKARA. 107 mind, of condensing a whole argument in one Word, by what is called the vivartavada or what may roughly be described as the theory of assumption. The Upanishads declare that everything pro ceeds from Brahma, which Sankara interprets by this theory to mean that the universe is of Brahma just as the snake, which a rope is believed to be, is of that rope. It is no more a result of it, but it exists by it. The Adhyasa or false impression just explained, bom of ignorance which is a synonym of Prakriti and is therefore eter nal, is the cause of such false assumption. Right knowledge dispels this illusion, as sufficient light explains the nature of the snake؛ and all is Brahma — etemal love and joy. The Word illusion puts US in mind of the theoiy of Mdya, often laid at the door of äaiikara in its illogical, not to say absurd, aspect. Because äankara uses, though rarely, the Word Mäyä or illusion, and advocates as strongly as he can the vivartavada. Some have thought that he regards the whole phenomena ofmatter as an illusion, a phan tasm, not existing per se. They carry this kind of reasoning to its consequences and reduce even the substratum of such illusions or dreams to an illusion again; and confront the Vedantins with the im possibility of reconciling the two contraries Jüäna (Brahma) and سمحةز/بم (Mäyä), waking and dreaming as existing in one place at the same time. Safdcara teaches the doctrine of Mäyä no doubt, it is in fact the very corollary of his vivartavada, but he never teaches it with a vengeance. He says that Nama and Rupa, name and form, are Mäyä, and we should have no faith in them.

Here äarikaray apparently, appears to put forth a doctrine much in accor dance with the exoteric mäyäväda, and his iilustration of the snake in a rope, inirage on ground saturated with Salt, will appear to lend Support to such conclusion. But the words as an explanation of آسأآأم should be borne in mind, together with the words 1 of Vdchaspatimiira explaining ananyatva as آآوأ مأأجو؟يجممآمثآ ٩ أج (we do not by ananyatva mean to demonstrate any unity, but we simply deprecate all idea of con ceiving them apart from each other; thus will Our theory not be open to the objections consequent upon a belief in the unity — of cause and effect). There is no identity between subject and object, nor any other relation, but each can never be conceived as apart from the other, — Thought and Being being inseparable. This is the real meaning of the vivartavada, which we must regard Saiikara, on the authority of another of his commentators Govinddnanda,2 as enun ciating in the passage quoted above. With this explanation of ana nyatva in Our hands, we must grant that محلإث؛مم or Illusion has its province really restricted to name and form and nothing eise.

Dvivedi. lend some colour, that the universe is a development from Brahma, and is ananya in that sense. This is called the Parinämavada. The theory of parindma ΟΓ development is scarcely tenable without the help of that inverted logic which would evolve matter from mind. This attempt is the opposite extreme of materialism; and Vallaiha in Order to escape from the apparent inconsistency of explaining the universe as in and of ZJraAma, and maintaining at the same time the selfcontradictory and suicidal theory of rnäyä, which we have been trying to set aside, subscribed to the more easy but equally absurd theory of development or evolution, and preached his religion ac cordingly. There are others like Rdmanuja and Madhva who separate mdyd (Prakriti, Matter) and Brahma, as subordinate and principal, and not being by the very hypothesis able to explain the phenomena of individual life (soul)1 in any other manner than a part — an ever existent part — of Brahma, maintain in fact three realities as the basis of the Cosmos. But a truer explanation of the mdyd or vivarta vdda, which all these try to avoid by theories not quite consistent with the necessities of Philosophie thought, can be easily found be tween the terms of the problem, Brahma and Prakriti, which are inscparable, not one. We must, however, refer to yet another passage in Order to make Our ground more firm, for though it is clear that by ananyatva Sailkara does not mean anything but inseparableness, still it is not quite clear whether he has a belief in the existence of a substantial basis of the universe. This fact, if ascertained, will show US a way to the Position which must baffle all attempt at interpreting mdyd into illusion out and out, and thus, in a sense, turning the weapons of the vivartavdda against itself. In dealing out a reply to the kshanikavijiidnavdda,'1 a theory nearly resembling the Idealism of Ber KLEY, he says:ا تمحآآلآا,أآآأومواٌأآ؛٠٩٢٢^٠٢٢ آ؟ 1 In the theory of Sankara individual life as such is a chimera, and yet the differences in the conscionsness of different beings are explainable as due to the difference in the Upädhi ΟΓ accident — manas, __ etc. — whose evolution cannot, withont considerable digression be the subject of the present paper. ء Βι-ahina-Sülrtu II. 2. 28.</page><page sequence="17">The Advaita ph_osophy OF 111 .د،ممءمحدة سأآلآ ff ٠ أةآأ تأس :ص سأأأأأأ. πζ -أأآس ٩ آآم ِمآتيجص ٩ ارس ٠ ٩ ----- ا آآ1هأيبم س# ؟R؟f؛Tfسأ ص ١ ا#اأ أآُآ ج سسآو؛؟ -٩٠٨ 1آمح بجصس ص آس ٠؟ و ٩ م محأس آاو؛اأأبج وآ ؟مآيأ؛آ و ٠١٠١٩^٠٩ I - - - - · τ ٩ UTW f_rr^rrf؟w_ س آءس ا ١١٩١٩ _· WTjnr^ آجمآمجآأ ا| f؟RW -٠ 1آمح وأآ ٩٢٩ ا ا أآوأأبم1بآ؟ هوؤي1د1سأسٌ *It is im possible to demonstrate the non-existence of all objectivity, for we cannot, surely, get rid of it. In all acts of consciousness some objec tive substratum is present in the form of a post, a wall, a jar, a piece of cloth and so on·, and it is impossible to ignore Our direct perceptions. It may be argued that it is not meant to ignore the existence of objectivity, but it is only meant that it is not apart from its correlative mental impression. This may all be very well, for one who argues in this manner is free to make any assertion he Jikes, but there is hardly any logic in what is thus Said. The exis tence of objects apart from their corresponding presentation must be acknowledged; and for obvious reasons based on Our perceptions. No one, indeed, cognises his mental idea of a post or a wall to be the actual post or the wall, but all observers regard the post and the wall to be objects cognised by the mind. Nor, because the impression takes the form of the object, does the latter deserve to become nil; for if it were so, there would have been no impression; and objects do as a matter of fact exist without the mind (and give impressions). Hence even the concomitance of the mental image and the objective existence does in no way prove their unity but only their relation as subject and object'. Now let US revise our explanation of ananyaiua by the light of this passage. Sankara evidently recognises some ob jectivity which it is impossible to ignore, which cannot be an illusion, and says that it is Brahma, in so far as it is not separate from it.

Thus mäyä is again definitely reduced to nama and τήρα, and the consistency of the vivartavada clearly demonstrated. Even the com parison of mäyä to svapna, dream, need not mistead US, afiter re cognising some substratum of the dream. As the things {nama and τήρα), Seen in a dream to be real, are shown to be false on waking, so is mäyä shown be false after full knowledge — the residuum, so to speak, being Brahma, as jiiäna commons to dreaming and waking.' Thus mäyä or ignorance, or avidyä or illusion is now clearly ex plained. It is the cause of the universe. The nature of adhyäsa ex plained before will show where cosmic evolution begins. Let US con clude this discussion by one last passage from Vidydranya. While explaining this Mvladhydsa he says: ؟fw ا ٠٢ آبمآ؛أآآآجم ؟ آم ءآfa: ι ا ٠٢٢ أص ٠٨ 1 ٠٠٢٢ حأطُ PartckadaB ΤΙ, 191—92. 'From Brahma — ever existing, all blessedness, and eternal — arise ÄkäSa, Vdyu, Agni, «TaZa, Pritkivi, vegetables, grain, animal bo dies, in succession. In this Sruti, Brahma would appear to be the cause (of the cosmos), and the (cosmos) would appear real, — this is called mutual adhyäsa'. Even here Brahma becomes the cause of material manifestations which also appear real — but both concep tions are adhyäsa — false impressions. BraAma is beyond all con ception, and matter is not apart from it. It is ignorance or mäyä that works in the middle, being, a part or synonymous of material manifestation. έατ&amp;ατα's philosophy is thus a consistent and unique demonstration of the inseparable correlation of Thought and Being.' tbis unirerse to a dream See ؛0 the comparison ؛0 1 For tbis explanation ^^٩٢٩٩٩٢٩۴١٦ ٩٢۴٩ .29 .2 .end of tbe comm.
