<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lynn M. Louden "Sprezzatura" in Raphael and Castiglione The High Renaissance in Italy is usually understood to span no more than twenty years-i.e., the first two de- cades of the sixteenth century. In this brief period, Rome and the Papacy served as the focal points for an incredi- ble burst of creative energy in virtually all of the arts. But the furious pace of those years under the Popes Julius II and Leo X was to prove impossible to sustain. In fact, the sack of Rome in 1527 was, in one sense, anti-climactic. Despite the inevitable ravages of any invasion, one cannot point to this or any other historical event which might serve to explain the rather sudden collapse of one of west- ern Europe's most brilliant epochs. On the contrary, the High Renaissance had clearly exhausted itself well before Rome's walls had been violated. Of the major artists in this period, Leonardo had departed for France by 1517, Raphael was dead in 1520, and Michelangelo's eccentric genius was already moving in a strange and introspective direction which points more toward the fascinations of the later sixteenth century than to the self-conscious Hu- manism of the High Renaissance. Although the giants of this period left at their deaths certain assistants, students, etc., the world which they had fashioned for themselves disappeared with them. There was something peculiarly personal about the ideal which attracted them all and which defied transmission-at least with any retention of the original vitality. Very likely this failure cannot be ex- plained by the not uncommon inability of student to per- petuate the success of his mentor. The lengthy career of Michelangelo provided ample opportunity for the philo- sophic alteration alluded to above to reveal itself dramati- cally. But it is also true that Raphael's rather brief career indicates a redirection of attitudes which is not altogether incompatible with that of Michelangelo. The brilliant lu- cidity of the School of Athens and the Disputa vies in the Stanza del'Incendio and the Transfiguration with more expressive distortions and the visionary. In short, the frag- ile flower that the High Renaissance represents would seem to have carried within itself the seeds of its own de- struction. Therefore, like Achilles, the ideal of this uniquely dramatic period was doomed by its very nature to live a brilliant but brief career. One way to recognize the necessity involved in this self-destruction is to exam- ine the complementary attitudes encountered in the achievements and thoughts of two men who rather di- rectly embodied the special qualities of the High Renais- sance-Raphael and Baldesar Castiglione. The author is an assistant professor in history of art at Sacramento State College and was formerly at the Univer- sity of Minnesota where he is presently completing his Ph.D. degree. U The lives of these two were closely intertwined and it is as if it were clear to them both from the outset that they strove to achieve a common ideal. Castiglione first came to Raphael's home city of Urbino in 1503, when they were respectively, twenty-five and twenty years of age. But it probably wasn't until Castiglione's second visit in the fall of the following year that the friendship be- tween the two began.1 By this time, Raphael had already established himself as an important painter through such early commissions for Duke Guidobaldo de Montefeltri of Urbino as the Dream of a Knight (c. 1500-1504) and St. Michael and the Demon (c. 1504). Through these works Raphael had caught the attentions of the brilliant circle of Humanists who clustered about the ducal court at Urbino.2 Such men as Pico della Mirandola, Ariosto, and Pietro Bembo at one time or another had sought out the enlightened patronage of either Duke Guidobaldo or his father, Federico-and transformed what might have been an unexciting provincial capital into a lively center of civ- ilized refinement. Perhaps the most dramatic linking of Castiglione's career as a courtier with Raphael's as an art- ist occurs in 1505 when the latter was commissioned by the Duke to paint a St. George and the Dragon which would then be sent to King Henry VII of England as a token of Guidobaldo's gratitude for having been granted the Order of the Garter. This, along with many other ex- pressions of proud thanks, was to be escorted to England by the most admired of courtly ambassadors, Castiglione himself. Hence it is clear that even then the complemen- tary nature of these men's lives, which seems so clear from our perspective, was recognized. At about the same time that Castiglione left for En- gland, Raphael also departed for the artistic centers of Florence and Rome. The end of 1508 finds Raphael in Rome and beginning work in the Stanza della Segnatura the following year. The year 1509 also marks Castiglione's appearance in Rome and a resumption of the friendship between artist and courtier. There is even some feeling that Castiglione had aided Raphael in the School of Ath- ens as a scholarly advisor. (Castiglione's biographer also asserts that the figure representing Zoroaster in this work is a portrait of Castiglione.) Thereafter, Castiglione's am- bassadorial life takes him throughout Italy but the two re- mained very close until Raphael's death in 1520. For ex- ample, Pietro Bembo recalls in one of his letters the pleas- ures of travelling with Castiglione and Raphael on excur- sions into the Campagna to visit recently unearthed Roman antiquities. It ought also to be noted that this pe- riod seems to be the most actively creative of Castiglione's ' Cartwright, J. The Perfect Courtier. John Murray, Lon- don 1927. p. 107f (Vol. I). ' Fischel, O. Raphael. (Two Vols.) Kegan Paul, London 1948. pp. 54-6. 43 Louden: "Sprezzatura" in Raphael and Castiglione</page><page sequence="2">career. In these years Castiglione writes some of his most significant Latin poems and epigrams in addition to re- suming work on what has become the primary vehicle of his fame, II Cortegiano (The Book of the Courtier).3 Raphael's years in Rome were characterized by an enormous achievement in a wide variety of activities en- compassing virtually all of the arts, and the close contact between Raphael and Castiglione was maintained throughout. As an important illustration of this intimate blending of sympathy and efforts, one could point to the famous report to Leo X on the situation of ancient Roman sites and antiquities. The authorship of this re- port is not clearly established but the most frequently en- countered opinion is that it is a collaborative product of Raphael and Castiglione. Perhaps it was Raphael who supplied the content of the report and Castiglione who fashioned the vehicle in the light of his more extensive scholarship. At any rate, the ambiguity of responsibility here once more points toward the special relationship be- tween the two men and we ought not to dismiss as empty rhetoric the distress of Castiglione upon hearing of Ra- phael's sudden death; for Castiglione, Death was "envious of one who could make the dead bones of ancient Rome live again."' The historical evidence which relates these two men so intimately is more significantly confirmed by those works which they have left to posterity. In fact, when one examines the paintings of Raphael in the light of what Castiglione states concerning the ideal courtier in his Book of the Courtier, the shared principles are dramati- cally revealed. At the same time that this is made clear, so too is it perhaps possible to gain some insight into our original concern-viz. what it was about the nature of the High Renaissance which doomed it to an early death. Castiglione's Book of the Coutrtier represented an at- tempt to codify the High Renaissance ideal of the "uni- versal man"; that is, the perfect embodiment of excellence in all areas of human activity. In carrying out this pur- pose, Castiglione drew upon his experiences as a member of the circle of Humanists located at Guidobaldo's court at Urbino and in many ways acted as their Boswell. At any rate, it ought to be noted that the hypothetical cour- tier (and his court lady) described in the Courtier is not simply a figment of Castiglione's too vivid imagination. On the contrary, the ideal constructed in those pages was unmistakably a portrait of the author himself and the book was clearly regarded in the sixteenth century as a handbook for the practical direction of behavior, and not as merely an attractive illusion. The ideal of the Courtier was, of course, an aristo- cratic notion but certainly not one which accepted nobil- ity of family as sufficient demonstration of one's true worth. Although Castiglione respects the opportunities af- forded by familial lines, he is careful to point out that the true courtier is he who has actually demonstrated his su- periority in concrete acts. The potential in man is of no great value until it has been transformed into the actual. For example, the courtier ought to be capable as a classi- cal scholar and exercise this learning in relation to con- temporary intellectual affairs; he ought to be perfectly competent in the arts of war and their peacetime counter- parts (hunting, etc.); but these latter qualities ought al- ways to be tempered, or humanized, by the restraints of virtue and the tender effects of music and the dance. Whatever the form of activity might be, it ought to be conducted with sober restraint so that arrogance can never sour the value of one's achievements. Perhaps the single most important quality of Castiglione's ideal cour- tier is expressed by the notion of "sprezzatura." "Sprezza- tura" is the key to the grace of the courtier which renders his superiority as natural expression. "But, having thought many times already about how this grace is ac- quired (leaving aside those who have it from the stars), I have found quite a universal rule which in this matter seems to me valid above all others, and in all human af- fairs whether in word or deed: and that is to avoid affec- tation in every way possible as though it were some very rough and dangerous reef; and (to pronounce a new word perhaps) to practice in all things a certain sprezzatura (nonchalance), so as to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it. And I believe much grace comes of this: because everyone knows the difficulty of things that are rare and well done; wherefore facility in such things causes the greatest wonder; whereas, on the other hand, to labor and, as we say, drag forth by the hair of the head, shows an extreme want of grace, and causes everything, no matter how great it may be, to be held in little account. Therefore we may call that art true art which does not seem to be art .. ."5 (my underscoring). This ideal of the courtier then, in the final analysis, is an aesthetic norm. In fact, this cultivated aestheticism is what marks the shift from the earlier concerns of the Quattrocento. Neither the mathematical classicizing nor the Neo-Platonic tradition of the preceding century quite correspond to the self-conscious refinement of "sprezza- tura." The former attitudes represent the metaphysical, contemplative impulses whereas "sprezzatura" is a straight- forward attempt to mould human behavior as if it were so much marble or paint. Although the practical value of the courtier to his prince is always recognized, there is also the sense that this perfection of personality embodies a beauty, an intrinsic value which justifies its existence as an end-in-itself. It is precisely this quality, or feeling, 3 Cartwright, J. p. 369f (Vol. I). 'Ibid., p. 61 (Vol. II). " Castiglione, B. The Book of the Courtier. Anchor Books, New York 1959. p. 43.

In both of the latter, there seems to be the reten- tion (in different ways) of the earlier aim which uses art to pursue something beyond art itself. Although a com- mon sensibility for the beautiful lends a recognizable sty- listic harmony to the work of the three major artists of central Italy in the High Renaissance, Raphael seems to come considerably closer to Castiglione's aestheticism than either of the other two. For Leonardo, the enigmatic beauty of his Mona Lisa, Madonnas, etc. serves as a sym- bol for his depiction of the mysterious, elemental forces of creation, while Michelangelo probes the powerful gran- deur of the male nude in order to render his own intros- pective contemplation of the divine. In short, the subordi- nation of art to metaphysics or theology is considerably less, if not at times nonexistent, in Raphael's painting and in this sense then makes him a more nearly perfect representative of his time than either Leonardo or Michel- angelo. It also helps to explain why Raphael does not offer the same kind of powerful fascination to virtually all later ages that Leonardo and Michelangelo have. !i;_ : i)i~ii } :'l:: i iii-i:i~i~i~i :_::',':::: ::::........ ::: 'iiiiiiiiiiiiii.?iiiiiiiil iiiiiii; :ii::iii i.i i.::ii:-:::-i i::-:: ?;:i::;:iii-'ii~i~ii iii ..... ....... l -iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii::iiiiii iiiiiiiii~iiii iijii!ii i~iiii:ii llii l i jII Fig. 2. Perugino, The Marriage of the Virgin, Ca-1500, Musee des Beaux-Arts, Caen, France. This quality of "sprezzatura" reveals itself right from the beginning of Raphael's career in his first signed work The Marriage of the Virgin (Lo Sposalizio) of 1504 (Fig. 1). Inspired by his teacher Perugino's render- ing of the same subject (Fig. 2), Raphael's painting can be found to differ primarily from its model by its unique awareness of the importance of "sprezzatura." Perhaps the most specific illustration of this new sensibility is to be found when one compares the two Josephs in the Perugino and the Raphael (Figs. 3 &amp; 4). Although Ra- phael's Joseph is not youthful, he is considerably more idealized than that of Perugino. The latter's Joseph, despite his almost cloying sweetness in contrast to earlier depictions by other artists, retains a certain hardness of profile and angularity which Raphael has avoided by softening the anatomy of facial features and breaking the rigid profile ever so slightly. In addition, the poses and garments of the two also reveal a subtle transforma- tion which reflects the same deliberate alteration of attitude. For example, Perugino's Joseph exudes a rhyth- mic grace of pose which is insistently emphasized by the highlighting of drapery and body. The easy S-like movement from head to right toe is inescapably obvious. In the Joseph of Raphael's painting, the impression of 45 Louden: "Sprezzatura" in Raphael and Castiglione</page><page sequence="4">jiiiiiiiiiiiiii:iiiiiiii:iiii:iiii:iiii: "':~':':':":"" i:i~~irl i;iiiiili`.;_ii:_iiI'iiiiiiiiiil::lini li:i::i:iiiiiiiiiii~iii.iiiiiii:'l;i!':' iiiiiiiiiii iiii;iiiiiiiii:iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijl- i-i-i-i:i:iiiiii:ii- i-,iii:i-;iii:-iii:i:i:.il:si:': a '':a::i:s lri :::::::::::i::::::::::::'`::: :::::::::?::::::::::::??? ???'''::ir:'il' :::::-:::::::?-::-?:;:::::::i::i':?:"i" i:ii~`?-~-i ~~~'i~"~~'ll::.~r;:;iii:?:a':iiiii:i:ii :;i.~-iil:::,~~''.z'!iL;: ij:_:ll:-:- .j: ___i-jjijijij,;::::-::::::::::?:?::: :i:i:i:iil::::::::::::::::::::::::: i-:i::::::::::::::: ::iliiiiii i: :-i-ii-iiiri---iii-;ili i.i.i:i:ii-i: -i-.i-i ::::i ::: :i:::::::::::-::1:::::?:-:-:::::.:::iiil:,,:,::::::::,::: '~"''~:..'l~''i'~:i'''::i:''iii:i"iii iiii'i:i:i':i:iii:ilii~'i'"::::-iiiiiiii 4?-~C.~~i E~~'i.i'l?ixii:i'iiiiial.iiiii--~il?liii I::::?:.-?:i:::::-:::-"~~:8: -?::i:::::?:::-::i:i:-:::;:i:--:- :::::_:-:-::::::: *'~j~;~~~~~~~8 ~$ '?I:l:~:"'t~ii:iRiiii;i,,i~iiiigiii''j j~j::j::: ::::i:X:?::l:::l:i:i:l:;l :::::a:?::::?::::::::::::??::?:::-:i iiii:'iiiniili:i`l''iiilili:?:ilili~:i: -:;ili-ij'i~~:~iiiiijijiiii; i:i ':'i'i'i'::?~:~~j':~iiiii?'::''''::i?iij :i;`:'::::::::'~l.i.:_i!__:i:i:::::, iliiiiirili'i'ili:iiiiii:i :_.:::::::;::,,: ::::::-:liii:ii:i:i:iili'iliiijjjjjjjjj.ji,,,,, i::::i::l:i:l:r::?i:: ili.iB:i:-iiiiiiiiii:i::riil:rilii:l i:::::::::::?:::-: :':i:i:riiiirl:ii :?:j::::i:::l`'i::::::::::::::a ii:'i':?i!:ij'ii,,,,':,::::::'_iiliill. :::::::::::j: i'iiil::::::::::l:ri:i:;:,: r- I=~C:' i:i:"i:i::Ki~~`~3::3::1i~i(l:::::::::: P~i:':'~l~'''~'''"''''"'::"~i:~''':~?'- ,,,,~~ Fig. 3. Perugino, The Marriage of the Virgin, detail. grace is equally great but perhaps more affecting since the manner of its expression is less obvious. Once again Joseph's slight turn toward the viewer tends to conceal the easy flow of line which characterizes the figure over- all while he introduces any number of linear rhythms in the garment subordinate to the main movement of the figure. These variations, in addition to the deliberate avoidance of any dramatic highlights, help to explain why it is that we feel the "nonchalance" of Raphael's Joseph in contrast to the almost hieratic frozen grace of Perugino's. In the former we can detect that quality which Castiglione had in mind when he wrote: "There- fore we may call that art true art which does not seem to be art." Another instance of Raphael's personal understand- ing of Humanism can be noted in his Budapest Portrait of a Young man (probably also dating from 1504) (Fig. 5). The young man in question is dressed in a deep violet cloak and red cap and undergarment while grasp- ing a paper in his right hand. For these reasons, Fischel concludes that the sitter is a youthful Humanist. (He might also have pointed out the striking similarity of ................

Once again the stark rigidity of a directly frontal handling of the subject (or absolute profile) is rejected in favor of a three-quarter view. The slight alteration of pose permits a more casual glance to be rendered on the young man's face but yet it retains its revealing intelligence and pene- tration. Here, without question, is a representation of that careful ease of understanding that is one of the distinguishing marks of Castiglione's ideal courtier. In addition, the studied ease of bearing of the figure is echoed by Raphael's careful integration of the figure with the landscape-a feat made more impressive when one recognizes that there is virtually no middle ground. In such instances, we might expect there be a more dra- matic polarity established between the large figure in the foreground and the deep landscape background. But in this painting, Raphael has comfortably integrated the two poles of our vision into one harmonious composi- tion by softening the contours whenever consistent with reality (e.g. in the hair superimposed on the sky), re- peating the rhythmic movements of the figure in the landscape, and binding the two together with the road- ART JOURNAL XXVIII 1 46</page><page sequence="5">:.i:~:;::::l::::::":;il.liii;l:''':''':: ::: ,I:lil:::::::::::.:.:::. :::::.':-~ :::?::?:?:::;:::::j: ::.:::.:.:.: :.:::::::::::::::::: ::::::::~-::::::::i:::: ,.:::.:: :;-:;;~I~:~ :::::j::::j:::ii-~iiiMjj: "I:i:;;;lr:;:':-:-:' :-::::-:;:::::-:::::i _-?;:-: :::-::I-:-.

The collar of the youth is picked up on either side of the figure by the road in the landscape and its circularity echoed in the spur seen just to the left of the young man. All in all, what we have here is the "natural" man in a comfortable environment. The fruit of learning is integration of self and society. The same sense of cultivated and comfortable world- liness can be noted in that commission of Guidobaldo's mentioned earlier, St. George and the Dragon (1506) (Fig. 6). This is the painting which Castiglione took with him as a gift for the king when the former traveled to England in order to personally receive the Order of the Garter in Guidobaldo's name. It is interesting to com- pare this version of St. George and the Dragon which now hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washing- ton with an earlier handling of the same theme by Ra- phael (Fig. 7). The earlier version (in the Louvre) dates from only a year or two before the Mellon panel but is markedly different, indicating the important influences at work upon Raphael in the intervening period and focusing probably upon the Urbino circle of Humanists -including Castiglione. (There is a recent argument for reversing the dating of the two St. George's but the fol- lowing remarks lead me to accept the traditional chron- :? ::: 8?~i~~?~r: i~?:"~-~ii~i.i:~:?~~a~~~-??????-? ~ ''''''-':l:i:iil:iilil:l::i:::i::l?:.::l I:i:"i:i:li:1:l:i':l:i:'-il:l;i: :::::::j:::::::::::-?::::::::::_:::::::: I:l:;:i::::::j::::i:._?::i?:iii?:iiii~:i '.: :':::::::j:::::;::li:i:"-:':'":':i:-l:;- .? ?..:.:.:::;:?:?: :::::::::::::::::::::ii::i:i:i-::::::::: i~t c-::::::::::::::::::::::: i:ii:l:lli::iii:.::lil:ii::ii::?i:::: ?F,:::::a?,:n:jj::::::::::::a:::::::j:; ::?::::?-:?????'--???-?:,?:?::-:?::::::: ~ic;iiiiiijiiiir liiiiii.iiiiiiiii'Ii'?iiijii_'i?iiiiiili :-:_?i--:-:-:--;:::::::a_--1:1:;1:1::?: iiiiiliiiii-iiiiiiiiii:ii:::::,::,::,?:,:.:.:-,-.,:.;---;ei:,:i? ::::::::.::.:::::::::::::: Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii':ij ji:l:?l)i:iji.ji :iiii,'i:iiiiliiiiii?ii.~:~ ii~ ~~ii~i ::: iiiiii 'i:i:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::i i:3?,:~-iiiiiii?:??-~~i~ %D~;:-~ 'aiiiiiiii:i:iiiiiiS'":':':":':';~' :~~~E~1~9~ i)?:iii~:iiiiIi'?ii":i b~:~:it:l11~-il~j:;iiiiiiiRI:i:l:ii:iai ~Bld :?::::-::::::::::?:1B~rllj;ii:-:iia- ~i" :::::::::':::::::::?:::j:::::::::::::::: : : :::iii:l:i:l:i:i:iliii:::::::llif:.ii':i ::::~.i:::::::::::::I:i:::::::_::::::::? :::?:?:::::::::::: ::::::::::::::i:i:l:I:i: ?'illli:liiliiilli j:r:::::::::::::::::: ~ ;j Fig. 6.

In the Louvre version the Saint is dressed in golden armor, the Princess in a pinkish garment, and the broken spear is a bright red and white. In short, there is a colorism in this work which recalls the decora- tive quality of the Quattrocento as well as the sweetness of mood in Perugino. The composition too is different from that of the mature Raphael in that it tends to re- tain a certain quality of an earlier tradition wherein the observer moves with a rigid logic from the dragon in the left foreground through St. George and his horse to the princess in the right middle ground. In one sense the participants in this tale all are treated with equal respect and have been united into an harmonious rela- tion through careful rendering of perspective and linear movements. In addition, the work as a whole is given the air of the fantastic through the misty landscape, the suggestive chiaroscuro, and the equal reality of rendering in both the dragon and St. George. (In fact, one gets the feeling that the dragon has been endowed with a greater reality than the horse!) When we turn to the Mellon version, we cannot avoid the recognition of a distinct alteration in the expression. For example, the "prettiness" of color in the older work has been replaced by a more serious, primary scheme. One hesitates to use the term "somber" but the shift is more toward the gravity accompanying self-consciousness. In addition, the composition has been more completely stabilized in a triangular fashion with the figure of St. George dominating the whole. The subordinate figures of the dragon and the princess have lost their parity of im- portance which they possessed in the Louvre version. The defeated dragon writhes darkly beneath the quiet invinci- bility of St. George while the princess, who earlier hurries gracefully away from the action, kneels in grateful adora- tion with gaze fixed upon her rescuer. Finally, there is a heightened air of substantiality in the Mellon version in contrast to that in the Louvre. The trees and landscape in general have taken on a clarity, independence, and mater- iality which creates the impression that the event depicted is not that of the dream-world or the supernatural, but rather an instance of superior human power. This is the natural, perfected and idealized rather than replaced by some more spiritual force. All this is summarized by the halting of our eyes in the background by the very real tower of a distant city in contrast to the smoky haze of comparable areas in the Louvre version-a city whose in- habitants are very likely unaware of the significance of the event taking place not far from their walls but who will benefit from the special superiority of the victor. Here is the perfection sought for by Castiglione-viz. the excellence of the individual which is made manifest with an air of ease and who conducts himself in such a way that it benefits, rather than harms, those who are depen- dent on him. A rather striking summary of the difference of atti- tude which separates these two paintings can be recog- nized upon noting the treatment of the horse in each. In the Louvre version the horse is presented in a rather ordi- nary fashion without any real indication of Raphael's in- terest in him beyond the necessary and formal consider- ations. For example, the brawny strength of the animal could have been drawn from any number of models avail- able to the artist while the profile and direction of the head repeat that of the dragon and aid therefore in bind- ing the composition into whatever unity it possesses. The totally different presentation of the horse in the Mellon version is immediately apparent. Considered formally, the horse's pose has been altered so that it fulfills the different demands of Raphael's essentially triangular composition -e.g. the heads of rider and horse are closely juxtaposed and their separate directions of vision constitute an over- all angle of intersection of approximately ninety degrees. The effect of this is heightened compactness of the com- position which adds a certain depth and strength to the stark linear thrust of the spear. But most striking of all is the startling gaze with which Raphael has endowed this animal. The horse stares out at the viewer from the scene with a look that is almost too human. The danger or drama of the action in which he is intimately involved seems to have made no particular impact upon the horse beyond the purely physical and he(?) expresses a coy self- assurance that seems decidedly un-animal-like. In short, this horse seems to have been granted by the artist the quality of sprezzatura. Self-consciousness and self-confi- dence can evoke a variety of responses when encountered in men but one finds these qualities of soul somewhat ab- surd in horses. Any other number of instances suggesting Raphael's awareness of what Castiglione was setting down in his Book of the Courtier could be pointed to, especially the numerous portraits of Cinquecento luminaries in both Urbino and Rome. But the most dramatic summary that one could offer as evidence for the apparent philosophi- cal agreement between Castiglione and Raphael is the portrait of the former done by the latter dating from 1514-15 (fig. 8). (There is some evidence for a second por- trait dating from 1519 but if it did exist, it has since been lost.) We have an unusual opportunity to quickly recog- nize the significance of the Castiglione portrait since we can compare it with a faithful copy by Rubens (fig. 9). The differences between the two are striking and tend to clarify the special quality of "sprezzatura" which Raphael has captured and is missing from the Rubens. The general impression of the Rubens is that the sit- ter is a man of considerable complexity of personality and is burdened by the exigencies of his experience. The face is roughly haggard and slightly quizzical in its expression. There is an aura of melancholic isolation, an anticipation of the unknown. This impression of uneasy alertness is aided by the dramatic contrasts of light and dark ART JOURNAL XXVIII 7 48</page><page sequence="7">iiil ! ii~l!!!~ii i ii ii~::'"-':`"''I? .?-i i i i ii'~~::ii?~irr ii~ iiii::iiiiiyiiia_:i~i~iiii~iii i: .: ::l:,::,-:: :: ?::: ?::::: ?::iiai':iiiiiiii?iiiiii i .'::.::1 '.-::_'-:i--;?1 -:lrj :: Fig. 8.

In short, the personality depicted is one who is sutf- fering and tense as a result of his presumed superior awareness. The Raphael Castiglione exudes a totally different quality. In this painting, Castiglione lack any indication of the melancholic puzzlement captured by Rubens. The impression here is one of absolute self-confidence that falls short of arrogance or even pride. It is rather the as- surance bred of knowing of one's excellence but tempered by the subjection of these powers to virtue and tradition. In contrast to the sense of antagonism which separates Rubens' Castiglione not only from his environment but also from himself, Raphael's rests comfortably before the grey-gold of the background. It is almost as if Castiglione had materialized out of the anonymous atmosphere so sof- tened are the graceful contours of the figure. The kinetic jagged contours and dramatic chiaroscuro of the Rubens is not to be found in the Raphael. On the contrary, the melodic movement throughout the figure is echoed by the deliberate blending of the tonalities of the garment and cap. It is as if Raphael were illustrating Castiglione's re- marks in the Courtier (II, 27) concerning the proper mode of dress for the courtier: "... I prefer them always to tend a little more toward the grave and sober rather ~?i?~1~i~::':i~:iiiiii-"ilili:iiil' Iiiii~iilli ~iiiiiiitiiiiiii-ji~ii:iit:liii Fig. 9.

Hence, I think that black is more pleas- ing in clothing than in any other color; and if not black, then at least some color on the dark side."' Hence, the steady sure gaze on the slightly idealized face of Castig- lione is designed to pointedly embody that studied non- chalance to which "sprezzatura" refers. Perhaps now we may reconsider our original ques- tion as to why the achievement of the High Renaissance was incapable of a sustained existence. Very likely the Ra- phael Castiglione contains the clue. In this portrait we have an instance of the ideal taken as the real, or the at- tempt to render tangibly what ultimately is the product of the creative intellect. In this portrait, we perhaps do not have so much of a likeness as we do a likelihood. In the painting of Raphael and even in some degree in the career of Castiglione, we may discover this rare achieve- ment of the fusion of the ideal and the natural. But is such a goal one that can be frequently realized, or one that can be significantly generalized beyond such rare in- dividuals as Raphael and Castiglione? This is doubtful. In short, the ideal of the Courtier is an impossible one, by and large. Like Achilles who also was an impossible hy- brid of the divine and the mortal, the ideal of the perfec- tion of the natural was doomed to a brief career.

The answer must ultimately be too complex for consideration here, but we may possess a clue in one qual- ity fundamental to the Courtier and which is echoed in a letter from Raphael to Castiglione-viz. an attenuated Platonism, or more properly-Neo Platonism. The Neo- Platonism of Ficino and others at the close of the Quat- trocento was perhaps quite strange in contrast to the Pla- tonism of the Dialogues, but it was a seriously intellectual effort in the metaphysical as well as the ethical areas of inquiry. In fact, the Neo-Platonism of this group is almost exclusively intellectual in character. The aim is primarily that of satisfying a voracious curiosity. But in the hands of such figures as Castiglione, Bembo and the representa- tive Urbino circle, Neo-Platonism becomes something quite different. In fact the application of any such label as "Neo-Platonic" to the literary expressions of these men would be misleading since the implied systematic think- ing is simply not to be discovered in them. In the Cinque- cento the "man of the world" was seeking out some form of intellectual expression and justification for his manner of life. In short, the whole interest in the Platonic tradi- tion was very different for Castiglione than it was for Fi- cino. What the former saw in this body of philosophical material was not so much a metaphysic as a body of max- ims for the guidance of polite behavior. Hence, it is not surprising that the character of Plato's ideas often be- comes transformed by being trivialized, or at least misap- plied. The one general distortion which resulted was a transformation of what Plato had said in reference to the ideal realm of the Forms into a description of the actual world of nature. The Book of the Courtier is dotted with many examples of this but perhaps the most pointed in- stance is the speech by Pietro Bembo on love with which the work closes. Because Bembo transforms certain com- plex notions of Plato's in regard to "eros" in the Sympo- sium into descriptions of two people kissing, the effect is hardly more than ludicrous. "Hence, a man delights in joining his mouth to that of his beloved in a kiss, not in order to bring himself to any unseemly desire, but be- cause he feels that the bond is the opening of mutual ac- cess to their souls, which, being each drawn by desire for the other, pour themselves each into the other's body by turn, and mingle so together that each of them has two souls; and a single soul, composed thus of these two, rules as it were over two bodies .. ."7 Such cultivated under- standing may create certain fragile splendours, but can hardly withstand the sterner demands of reality. It is pre- cisely this confusion of the ideal with the real which helps to explain the peculiar anthropomorphism of the horse in the Mellon St. George and the Dragon.
