<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modem Science ? 407 IS PANTHEISM THE LEGITIMATE OUTCOME OF MODERN SCIENCE? BY W. T. HARRIS.1 I. Three Theologic Views of the World. In all theological and philosophical discussions it is necessary to go at once behind words to their meaning. In mathematics, natural science, and ethical science, it is of course equally neces sary to define terms and use them consistently; but, inasmuch as natural and ethical sciences relate to facts and phenomena of ob servation and consist in large part of an inventory of such phe nomena, it follows that there is much that remains of value after deducting careless and inaccurate reasoning, arid making allowance for confusion in the use of terms. In philosophy and theology we do not find a store of immediate facts that retain their value even when misused by reflection. These sciences deal with reflection and results of reflection. " Pantheism " is a term now very often used to name that view of the universe which, while it rejects the doctrine of a Personal First Cause of the world, on the other hand insists upon the de pendence of nature and man upon a substantial principle or an im personal Power from which everything emanates and into which it all returns. This use of the word " Pantheism " is comparatively a recent one. It was used by Toland early in the last century to denote a polytheistic worship of all the gods. Our present inquiry in regard to the outcome of modern sci ence doubtless requires us to employ the word in the meaning first defined. The question is, whether modern science leads toward a belief in a personal God or toward a belief in a blind unconscious power, or, finally, whether science finds only things and forces in the universe without unity in a first principle. For there are three hypotheses instead of two?atheism, pantheism, and theism. To him who finds no necessity for an ultimate unity of all things, there is only atheism. To him who sees the neces sity of unity, but finds it a mere essence or substance from which 1 Read at the Concord School of Philosophy, July 30, 1885.</page><page sequence="2">408 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. things in their multiplicity arise, and into which they return, there is pantheism. Finally, the theist sees the necessity of unity, but? more than this, sees too the necessity of the form of personality as the form of any ultimate unity or totality. Before discussing the ten ability of either of these views let us consider for a moment the practical interest involved in them. In the idea of God, man defines for himself his theory of the ori gin and destiny of the world. The whence and the whither of nature and of man are involved in this idea, and through it, there fore, are determined his theoretical views and*his practical activi ties. If he believes that this supreme principle is blind fate, un conscious force, or something devoid of intelligence and will, this belief will constantly modify all his thoughts and deeds, and ulti mately shape them into harmony with his faith. If, on the other hand, he regards this supreme principle as a conscious personality, as absolute intelligence and will, this view will likewise shape his thoughts and deeds, but with a radically different result. The former theory is unfriendly to the persistence and triumph of hu man beings, or of any rational beings whatever. It will not ac count for the origin of conscious beings, showing how conscious reason is involved as a presupposition of unconscious being, or how the unconscious must necessarily develop into consciousness as one among its potentialities; still less can that theory permit the persistence of conscious individualities, for that would admit consciousness to be the highest principle, and not a mere phase or potentiality of unconscious being. Even if conscious indi viduals could emanate from an unconscious first principle, they would be finite and transitory phases, mere bubbles rising to the surface and breaking into nothing. The activity of the First Principle?and all conceptions of the First Principle must regard it as active?must be in accordance with its own nature, must tend to shape all things so as to correspond to that nature. For activ ity is expression ; that which acts utters itself on that upon which it acts. It gives rise to modifications in an object by acting upon it, and these are its own expression; it again modifies, through its continued action upon the object, the modification which it had previously caused, and in all this continued action only secures a more perfect expression of itself. An unconscious Absolute would in the first place express itself</page><page sequence="3">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 409 in unconscious individualities. If we suppose that there were conscious individualities already existing upon which it could act, such an Absolute would produce modifications in them that would tend in the direction of an obliteration of the element of con sciousness. On the other hand, the activity of a conscious Ab solute would tend continually to the elevation of all unconscious beings, if there were any, toward consciousness. For its activity would tend to establish an expression of itself?the counterpart of its own being?in the object. If its created objects developed into consciousness, they would be sustained on that plane by the influence of the Absolute, and not allowed to lapse. To unconscious beings it is all the same whether the Absolute is conscious or unconscious. It may create them and destroy them without cessation?what is that to them ? But to human beings, or to any other rational beings, such a blind fate as an unconscious Absolute is utterly hostile and repugnant in every aspect. Their struggle for existence is a conscious one, and they strive ever to ward a more complete consciousness and a larger sphere of directive will-power over the world in the interest of conscious, rational purposes. But an unconscious First Principle would be an abso lute bar to the triumph of any such struggle. The greater the success of man's struggle for self-consciousness and freedom, the more unstable would become his existence. It would result in his being further removed from harmony with the activity of the un conscious absolute substance, and that activity would be more di rectly hostile and subversive of man's .activity the more he had developed by rational culture. Hence, with a belief in an uncon scious Absolute, rational beings find themselves in the worst pos sible situation in this world. Pessimism is their only true creed. Any sort of culture, development, or education for the so-called "faculties of the mind," all deeds having for their object the elevation of the race into knowledge and goodness?whatever, in short, is calculated to produce and foster human individuality? must have only one net result?the increase of pain. For the de struction of conscious individuality is attended with pain; and, the more developed and highly organized the individuality, the greater the pain attending upon its dissolution. Nor is the pain balanced by the pleasure of the exercise of human activity in its transient existence, for the negation and consequent pain is twofold?the</page><page sequence="4">410 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. pain of birth and growth from a lower to a higher order of exist ence, and the pain of decay and death. The conscious struggle, being in direct opposition to the activity of forces of the Absolute involved in the creation of the personal beings, is a struggle full of pain; finally, the beings vanish through the agency of the destruc tive forces of the Absolute, a second pain, still more terrible. On the basis of atheism there is utter indifference with regard to the ultimate origin and destiny of individual things. Inasmuch as immediate and independent existence is assumed for each and every thing, there is no origination, properly so called, nor any destiny. Everything is as it is, and absolutely so, on the strict atheistical basis. Each thing has always been and always will be: strict atheism is atomism. It is not atheism to hold that things and events are mere phenomena or appearances, and that behind them there are noumena or substantial beings or powers and forces. For such a theory implies a conviction that multiplicity demands unity, and this theory carried out results in the all-absorbing unity of pantheism. To remain on the standpoint of atheism it is requi site to deny relativity. According to atheism, there can be no essential dependence. All relations are accidental and each thing is sufficient for itself. Once admitting the principle of relativity, atheism is no longer logically tenable. Mutual dependence among things reduces them to unity.' This unity may be conceived as personal or as imper sonal?and the result is theism or pantheism. According to pan theism, each and every immediate being is phenomenal. It is apparent and not real. It is a " manifestation of a hidden and inscrutable essence," as Herbert Spencer asserts. Why " inscru table " if it " manifests" itself, we ask ? Because the essence in itself is devoid of all form and individuality. Individual things we can see and examine, but the essence which abides when all these things are destroyed, that we cannot perceive by any one of our five senses. The essence is abstract. It originates par ticular things, and it swallows them up again. They are not complete enough to reveal the essence. If one comes to the con ception of essence by discovering necessary dependence on the part of things as exhibited in the process of change (origination and decay), he conceives it as negative unity?in other words, as a unity existing on a higher plane than the things and existing after</page><page sequence="5">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 411 their destruction. Any force in its process of manifestation cre ates a series of states or conditions in matter each of which may be called a " thing." In the series the force abides and com pletes its manifestation through the creation and destruction of the states called " things," for force is a unity on a higher plane than that of the " things." Now, these forces themselves are not to be regarded as independent or as totalities, but as mutually de pendent and relative. Hence they reduce again to a still higher unity, the so-called " persistence of force." The particular forces are abstract as compared with the things which they make ; the ultimate force is an ultimate abstraction inasmuch as it retains neither the forms of things nor the forms of the special forces. Heat, light, electricity, gravitation, magnetism?all lose their char acteristics in the ultimate force. In view of this conception, there is no immediate being that can survive throughout the entire pro cess of the world. All must perish. Everything that has form and character must pass away. Things organic and inorganic, human beings and institutions, none are persistent. This is Pan theism. But if the standpoint of reflection upon the facts and processes of the world is that of theism, the outlook is entirely different. Instead of a formless highest principle which is hostile to the per manence of all particular individuals, a highest principle is set up whose nature is perfect form. Perfect form contains not only the forming principle, but also the formed ; it is self-determined and self-active, and hence subject and object. For theism finds the ultimate and absolute to be personality or perfect form instead of the negation of all form. IJence the world-process is to be inter preted rather as the evolution of this perfect form or conscious being rather than as a process of producing individualities with no purpose except to annul them. There is an ideal at the summit of the universe, perfect personality, the goal toward which crea tion moves. Hence with theism there is immortality for man and infinite progress possible. The divine Being is perfect form, and its influence gives a tendency in the universe toward the survival of whatever reaches conscious personality. It is understood here that personality implies consciousness and free will. Personality, according to theism, is not per se finite and limited, but is the true form of infinitude because it is self-determination, self-activity,</page><page sequence="6">412 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. and not something which is originated and sustained by something else. Imperfect creatures, like men, participate in this self-activity, and have the possibility of infinitely growing into it by their own free activity. In stating the practical interest involved in the three views of the world, we encounter here the chief*objection which is made to theism. It is held that personality cannot be the form of the ab solute or infinite, because limits and determinations are necessarily implied in the conception of personality ; theism is therefore re garded as anthropomorphism. Theism departs from pantheism just at this point. The absolute is conceived as negative by pan theism. It is devoid of all attributes and properties?empty of all determinations. But theism conceives the absolute as self determination or self-activity. Pantheism arrives at the void; theism arrives at the fullness of being. The substantial thought of theism?its road to the idea of per sonality?is this : Every being must be either independent or de pendent ; if dependent, it belongs to some other being upon which it depends. The independent being is a whole or total. The in dependent being is likewise determinate, possessing attributes and properties. That which possesses no properties or attributes neither exists for itself nor for anything else?it is a pure nothing. Hence such an absolute as pantheism conceives is a pure nothing, and no real absolute. On the other hand, there are two kinds of deter minate beings?those that are determined through others, and those that are determined by their own activity. Finite beings are, as Spinoza said, those that are determined through others?depending on others and, therefore, belonging to other beings. Infinite beings are those which are their own oth ers?depend on their own activity for their qualities and attributes. But the agnostic says: " I can form no idea whatever of a self activity ; it is only a word and means no more than 'round square' or'white black.'" This convenient method of disposing of an idea by pronouncing it unthinkable is, however, not available. It proves altogether too much. Herbert Spencer uses it to disprove the fundamental notions that form the basis of Theology, Self existence, and Creation. They are unthinkable. But he forgets his test of truth when he comes to the second part of his book and proves the persistence of force and matter. He admits that per</page><page sequence="7">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 413 sistent force is inconceivable, although he claims to be more cer tain of its existence that he is of any object of experience. Incon ceivability, in fact, is no hindrance to cognition at all for any agnostic, because the term means nothing but unpicturability. Not only is self-activity unpicturable, but any motion or activity whatever is unpicturable, either in the imagination or on canvas. " A thing cannot move where it is, and, of course it cannot move where it is not," said Zeno. All categories involving activity are equally inconceivable ? such, for example, as force, becoming, change, process, birth, and decay. So also are all categories of relation and dependence. But it may be said truly that all these ideas are conceivable if one adopts an adequate definition of " con ceivable" and does not confound it with " picturable." A con cept is not properly a picture at all, but, rather a rule or schema for the formation of pictures. Under the concept horse we picture to ourselves a particular horse, but we at once recognize the differ ence between our picture and the general schema which we think in our concept. The important element in a concept is the definition. Just as the unpicturable notion of " persistent force " is an ultimate truth according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, so, if rightly considered, self activity or self-determination is presupposed by persistent force, and persistent force is unthinkable except in the form of self activity. According to the idea of correlation of forces, one force in act ing passes over into another. Thus heat, light, electricity, and other forces vanish the one into the other. Thus forces, thought as a complete series, make up a circle of activity, the last of the series becoming the first. The persistent force is the energy com mon to all and underlying all. Each particular force is aroused to activity by the action of another, but the persistent force is not a particular force over against another, but the totality of energy as a unity. The persistent force is, of course, an energy, an activ ity, that is not derived from another. It is therefore self-active. It is clear, therefore, that persistent force is not happily named " force." A force is usually thought as existing in a state of ten sion with other forces; it is conditioned by them, and essentially a finite being. But the all-inclusive energy of the entire system of forces is a self-related energy, and hence a self-activity. 2 7</page><page sequence="8">414 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. We now can see the futility of the argument against theism that it involves anthropomorphism. Self-activity is not finite limit ation, but mastery over limitation. Self-activity, which belongs to the very definition of mind, is the essence of freedom and power to transcend limits. But it is surprising that while repudiating self-consciousness and will, the two forms of self-activity, panthe ism is ready to admit force or power as an attribute of the abso lute. Force or power, implying a tension of opposites, is an idea actually below the anthropomorphic idea, because it directly in volves finitude. Perfect form or self-existent being must necessarily be self-de termined being, and, therefore, have the form of mind or self-con sciousness, and, inasmuch as man has this form, it may be called anthropomorphic. All totalities, all independent beings, have the form of self-determination, and are subject and objeet of them selves, and in this sense anthropomorphic. To speak of anthropo morphism in this sense as limitation is like saying that the form of infinitude is a limitation. Persistent force, regarded as the totality of the complex of finite particular forces (or as an " ulti mate scientific idea"), is of necessity self-determined, and hence it, too, is anthropomorphic. II. The Method of Modern Science. Having thus considered the definitions of pantheism and the outcome of the generalizations made by the scientific mind in our time looking toward the ultimate nature of the principle underly ing the world of objectivity, let us turn our attention to the aspect of modern science that is least identified with philosophical think ing?namely, its empirical method. If we can learn by our inves tigation what it presupposes, we shall find ourselves in a position to determine the answer to the objection made to all philosophi cal and theological conclusions whatever?the objection, namely, from the standpoint of " positive " or empirical science to the effect that we cannot transcend experience, and that experience is only possible in regard to finite and relative objects, and in no wise possible in regard to an ultimate principle. On this ground it utterly repudiates what it calls " introspection " and the " method of introspection." Moreover, it declares against all generaliza tions not based on and derived from external experiment, claiming</page><page sequence="9">Is Pantheism the. Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 4l5 that all scientific knowledge is knowledge obtained through spe cialization and actual inventory of details. It thus rejects all inferences of a theological character and holds them to be unwar ranted by science. It is not the necessity of specialization for purposes of making an inventory of nature that militates against philosophy or the ology, for why should not both these exist as well as specialized inventoryingIt is the attitude of the scientists against all gen eral surveys. They assume that these general surveys are not only unnecessary, but vicious in all science ; hence they deny the exist ence of a scientific philosophy or theology. But tfyis assumption of scientists can be shown to be wholly grounded on a misapprehension of their own procedure in scien tific knowing. It is due, in other words, to an incorrect account of the processes involved in the scientific method itself. It is a simple matter to initiate and carry on some one of the scientific processes by which discoveries are made, but the system of science as a whole is presupposed as a sort of invisible guide or norm that makes possible the act of specialization. We have division of labor and the specialization of the work of the individual because of the system of collection and distribution which commerce carries on, and by which it supplies each with the needed food, clothing, and shelter that he does not produce, for the reason that he is engaged in his special vocation that furnishes only one of the many required necessities. The special scientist cannot confine his attention to one subject without definition and limitation effected by the collective labors of his fellows, not only in their special departments lying contigu ous to his own, but as well by their labors to state the relations of the special results to each other. In order, therefore, to discuss with profit this question of Pan theism as the outcome of modern natural science, we must first investigate the relation of specialized inquiry to its organization into a system, or, in other words, to a general survey of the whole scientific field. The specialist sometimes supposes that his industry is all that is required for the creation of science in its completeness. He con demns what is called the philosophy of his subject as though it were premature generalization and unwarranted systematizing.</page><page sequence="10">416 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. On the other hand, it must be confessed that the philosopher is apt to be impatient at the plodding toil and narrow gains of the specialist. But the fact that it needs both species of investigation becomes evident when we look to the practical field of human activity. Man must act as well as think. The will executes while the intellect surveys or analyzes. In the performance of a deed the will should act in view of all the circumstances, but this view of all the circumstances is an intel lectual survey. Hence human action demands a general survey of the circumstances before it in order to act rationally. Suppose we omit the philosophical activity of the intellect?leave out the generalization consequent on a survey of the whole?and try to act with the aid of the specializing intellect alone? Then the will resolves and executes in view of a fragmentary circumstance, and does not weigh one particular motive with another. The result will be lame and impotent, because it lacks considerateness and looks neither before nor after, but acts from one motive, and a trivial one, because it is an intentionally special view and not a general survey. The necessity of practical activity in any province, therefore, demands the intellectual activity of forming a general survey, as well as the intellectual activity of analyzing and specializing. It is important to see how these co-ordinate. Rational will-power is the will under the guidance of directive intelligence. This intelligence surveys various objects of action and selects one of them as desirable; it surveys likewise various modes of action and adopts what seems to be the best. Now, it is clear enough that analytical investigation may divide and subdivide objects and means forever; if the will waits for the completion of analytical investigation, it waits forever. The ana lytical intelligence can never arrive at a conclusion. Its analysis only serves to open up new vistas of further investigation. But at any point of its procedure it is possible for the intellect to stop its analytical investigation and unify its results by comparison, sum all up in a general conclusion, saying, " In view of all that is thus far discovered, this conclusion will follow." The trend is dis coverable when only two facts are ascertained; a third fact may reveal a modification of the previously discovered trend, or per haps only confirm it. The practical activity, whenever called upon</page><page sequence="11">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science? 417 to perform a deed demands a cessation of analytical investigation and the interposition of a general survey, in order to discover the trend that is revealed by the facts discovered ; with this provi sional view of the whole, it acts as rationally as is possible with its imperfect intelligence. Admitting that the increase of light by the further discovery of new facts by the aid of the analytical intellect is a never-ending process, we shall admit also that the will may act more and more rationally according to the quantity of analytical, specializing work of the intellect that has been performed. But there can be no direct step from the specializing activity to the will-activity of man. There must always supervene a summing up of those special results in a general survey before they become of any prac tical use. The jury must not permit themselves to decide until the case is closed. The case must be closed when only a part of the facts are in, because only a part of the facts can be ascertained. In any science the facts can never be all ascertained, because each fact is divisible by analysis into constituent facts, each process into constituent processes forever. This is evident from the infi nite divisibility of time and space. Therefore we may affirm with out contradiction that specializing science must admit the neces sary intervention of the philosophic activity which takes general views or surveys before its results can become useful in human activity. But this is not all: if we examine what constitutes a science we shall be compelled to acknowledge that mere specializing analytic al industry can never produce a science. Science is systematic knowledge. Facts are so united to other facts within a science that each fact sheds light upon all facts; and every fact upon each fact. From the special facts discovered by the analytical activity of the intellect, not only no practical use would ensue, but no theoretic use except through their synthesis by general surveys. A science results only after the particular facts obtained by analytic specialization are summed up. The case must be closed, and for the moment the assumption made that all the facts are in, if we are to discover the connecting link which binds the facts into a system. Without system no mutual illumination oc curs among the facts; each is opaque and dark. So long as a fact in a science does not vet help explain other facts, and receive 2 7 * XIX?27</page><page sequence="12">41 &amp; The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. explanation from them, it is as yet no organic part of the science. It is itself an evidence of the imperfection of the science. The science appears only when the general survey has become possi ble. Facts are united into a system by principles?energies that include forces and laws. Studying more carefully the function of the synthetic activity of the mind as seen in the general survey, its difference from the analytic activity becomes clear. The analytic specializing divides and subdivides the fact or process before it, and goes from wholes to parts. The synthetic discovers unities of facts by means of re lations of dependence. This phase or fact and that phase or fact are parts or results of one process, and so it concludes that they may be comprehended in one. Then, again, it steps back from the discovered unity and looks for relation to other unities and its dependence on a higher process, which unites it with co-ordinate processes. Each new generalization is only an element of a higher generalization. Science demands inventory, general survey, and experiment. Even in the matter of making an inventory, science avails itself of general survey under the form of definition. No definition can be made without such a survey, for it involves an attempt to grasp together a whole class under some common characteristic. Without the definition hovering in the mind, how shall one know which facts to include in its inventory and which to exclude? To take any and all facts without limiting the selection within a cate gory would be the purest futility. Inventory proceeds, therefore, by recognizing new individuals as belonging to a previously de scribed clasp. Within this class new characteristics are to be recognized arid new sub-classifications made. Experiment, too, starts from a principle already generalized or assumed as an hy pothesis?thus grounded in a general survey, like the inventory process, only far more explicit. A fact is to be found and identi fied by the inventory; but by the experiment it is to be con structed. The theory or hypothesis is derived from general survey, and it furnishes the rule for the construction of the fact. If it finds the reality accord with it, there is verifica tion of the theory or hypothesis?the principle is confirmed. If the reality does not result according to the theory, there is a refutation of it. The theory was simply an extension of the</page><page sequence="13">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 419 conclusion drawn from the general survey from what was before known. Analytical specialization is most successful in the form of ex periment, and is guided by hypotheses. Witness the immense fertility of biological research in recent science when its industry is guided by the Darwinian hypothesis. That hypothesis is, of course, like all theories, the result of a general survey, the syn thetical. activity of the mind. This is what may be called the philosophical activity of the mind. It closes the case, stops the process of analysis and inventory of new facts, assumes that all facts are in, and asks in view of them: "What unity, what prin ciple is presupposed ?" The answer to this question unites into a system what is known, and furnishes an hypothesis or provisional theory for further analysis and inventory of special facts. Thus the philosophical activity enters science as an indispensable factor, and alternates with the analytical activity that discovers new facts. But there is another phase of the synthetic activity of mind which transcends this hypothetic synthesis, this making of provis ional theories. It is the a priori synthesis that underlies all men tal activity. Intellect recognizes by an a priori act time and space as the logical condition of the existence of all nature?the entire totality of facts and events. What it knows of Time and Space is formulated in the science of mathematics as so much theory of nature that is known a priori. So much is not in need of experi mental verification, because it is certain at the very outset that nothing can. exist in the world unless it conforms to the mathe matical laws of time and space. Besides the mathematical ele ments of theory there are other a priori elements equally sover eign in their sway over experience; such are the law of causality, the principles of excluded middle and contradiction, the ideas of quality and quantity, the idea of the conservation of energy. The mariner ploughs the sea, looking from wave to wave, passing from horizon to horizon, but he holds on his course only by the obser vations which he makes ever and anon of the eternal stars. So the specialist lifts his eyes from the multitudinous seas of facts through which he moves to the fixed lights of mathematical truth or to the planets of provisional theory, and is able to go forward to a desired haven.</page><page sequence="14">420 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. III. Scientific Method presupposes Living Energy as First Principle. The synthetic activity of the intellect looks at the history of its object. It expects to find in the history of its growth and devel opment a complete revelation of the nature of its object. That which offers itself to the senses as the object perceived is not the whole of the phenomenon, but only one of its manifestations. We may call the phenomenon the entire process of manifestation, in cluding all the phases. In one moment some one phase is exhib ited, in another moment some other phase. The acorn which we see lyiDg on the ground is not the whole process of its manifestation?not the whole phenomenon. It is only a temporary phase in the growth of an oak. In the course of time this acorn would sprout from the soil and become, first a sapling, then a great tree, bearing acorns again. The acorn itself depends upon the whole process which forms the life of the oak, and is to be explained only by'that process. So likewise any other phase or immediate manifestation in the life of the oak?its exist ence as a young sapling, or as a great tree, or as a crop of leaves, blossoms, or, indeed, a single leaf, or blossom, or bud. Science sees the acorn in the entire history of the life of the oak. It sees the oak in the entire history of all its species, in whatever elimes they grow. It sees the history of the oak in the broader and more general history of the life of all trees, of all plants; and, finally, it considers plant life in its relations to the mineral below it and to the animal above it. To see an object in its necessary relations to the rest of the world in time and space is to comprehend it scientifically. The object just before our senses now is only a partial reve lation of some being that has a process or history, and we must investigate its history to gain a scientific knowledge of it. Its history will reveal what there is in it. No object is a complete revelation of itself at one and the same moment. The water which we lift to our lips to drink has two other forms%; it may be solid, as ice, or an elastic fluid, as steam. It can be only one of these at a time. Science learns to know what water is by collecting all its phases?solid, liquid, and gaseous?and its properties as re vealed in the history of its relations to all other objects in the</page><page sequence="15">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 421 world. So, likewise, the pebble which we pick up on the street is to be comprehended through its geological history?its upheaval as primitive granite, its crushing by the glaciers of the Drift Pe riod, and its grinding and polishing under icebergs. We must trace whatever we see through its antecedent forms, and learn its cycle of birth, growth, and decay. This is the advice of modern science. We must learn to see each individual thing in the perspective of its history. All aspects of nature have been, or will be, brought under this method of treatment. Even the weather of to-day is found to be conditioned by antecedent weather, and the Signal Bureau now writes the history of each change in the weather here as a progress of an atmospheric wave from west to east. The realm which was thought a few years since to be hope lessly under the dominion of chance, or subject to incalculably va rious conditions and causes, is found to be capable of quite exact investigation. This is all due to the method of studying each par ticular thing as a part of a process. When the storm-signal sta tions extend all over the world, we shall learn to trace the history of atmospheric waves and vortices back to the more general move ments of the planet, diurnal and annual, and we shall find the connecting links which make a continuous history for the weather of to-day with the eternal process of exchange going on between the frigid and torrid air-zones, and trace the relation of this to the telluric process of earthquakes and the periodic variation of sun-spots and their dependence upon the orbital revolution of Ju piter and other planets. Doubtless we shall not see a science of astrology, predicting the fortune of the individual man by the foreordained aspects of the planets under which he was born ; but it is quite probable that, when the history of the meteorological process becomes better known, we shall be able to cast the horo scope of the .weather for an entire season. This method of science, now consciously followed by our fore most men of science, is not an accidental discovery, but one which necessarily flows out of the course of human experience. For what is experience but the process of collecting the individual percep tions of the moment into one consistent whole ? Does not experi ence correct the imperfection of first views and partial insights by subsequent and repeated observations? The present has to be ad justed to the past and to the future. Man cannot choose?he</page><page sequence="16">422 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. must learn in the school of experience; and the process of experi ence, blindly followed upon compulsion, when chosen by conscious insight as its method, becomes science. The difference, therefore, between the scientific activity of the mind and the ordinary common-sense activity lies in this differ ence of method and point of view. The ordinary habit of mind occupies itself with the objects of the senses as they are forced upon its attention by surrounding circumstances, and it does not seek and find their unity. The scientific habit of mind chooses its object, and persistently follows its thread of existence through all its changes and relations. Science has not been conscious of its method to such a degree that it could follow it without deviation until quite recent times.. We might say that Darwin, of our own generation, is the first to bring about the use of the historical method as a conscious guide to investigation. And, indeed, although science has found the true method, it has not seen the ground of the method?its ultimate presupposition. It has much to say of evolution, and justifies its method by the doctrine of development of all that i3 from ante cedent conditions. Homogeneity and simplicity characterize the first stages; complexity and difference of quality and function characterize the later stages. There is growth in a special direc tion. By survival we learn to know what is most in accord with the final purpose of nature. But we cannot see this teleology or final purpose except by taking very large arcs of the total circle of development. The reason for this 'historical method, however, is to be found in the necessity already shown, to wit: All total or whole beings:? that is to say, independent beings?are self-determined beings. Self-activity is the basis of all causal action, all dependence, all transference of influence. Hence it follows that when we behold a manifestation, phase, or incomplete exhibition of something, we look farther to see the whole of which it is a part. We look back to its antecedents, and forward to its consequents, and by these construct its history. We have not found it as a whole until we have found it as energy that initiates its own series of changes and guides them to a well-defined goal. The oak as a living organism thus initiates its series of reactions against its environ ment of earth and air, and converts the elements which it takes up</page><page sequence="17">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 423 from without into vegetable cells, and with these builds its organs and carries itself forward in a well-defined method of growth from acorn through sapling, tree, blossom, fruitage, to acorn again as the result. All inorganic processes likewise, when traced into their history, exhibit the form of cycles, or revolutions, that return into the same form that they began with, thus repeating their beginning, or rather making a sort of spiral advance upon it. The energy that repeats again and again its cycle of activity is either life itself or an image or simulacrum of life. The annual round of the seasons, the daily succession of day and night, the cycle of growth of the planets themselves, or even of the solar systems? each of these is an image of life, as Plato long ago pointed out. All points back to an efficient energy somewhere that is its own cause in the sense that it originates its movements and changes and causes its own realization. IV. Three Stages of Scientific Consciousness. The reason why this presupposition of a First Principle in the form of a living energy is not seen clearly by all students of natural science is to be found in the repudiation of introspection?which we have discussed above as the boasted advantage claimed by the specializing analytical activity of science. In thinking there are three stages of culture or development, well marked, since the time of Plato. These three grades of culture in thought stand for three degrees of capacity to think the First Principle of the world. Or rather each of these grades has its View of the World peculiar to itself. The difference between the several stages of thought depends upon the capacity to see an object in its entirety. a. The lowest stage of thinking considers its objects as isolated and independent things, and ignores the importance of relations. As it isolates its objects and holds them apart or abstracts them from all relations, I call it " abstract" thinking. As it supposes that all relations are non-essential and due to merely external com bining of objects, it insists on thinking atoms as the ultimate ele ments of existence. It is the atom-stage of thought. As it knows by experience that bodies are composite, its theory sustains itself by holding that large bodies are made of small bodies. b. But a higher stage of thinking supervenes when the mind begins to become conscious of essential relations; when it discovers</page><page sequence="18">424 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. that one object depends upon another in such a manner that a change in the one modifies the other, it comes to see that objects are not independent existences, but that they are terms of ratios. Change one term of a ratio, or fraction, and you must change the other, or else,the value of the ratio or fraction will suffer change. To find that an object is a term of a ratio is to find that it is not a whole complete existence in itself, but that it is a portion of an including whole, and is what it is only through the activity of a process. At this stage of thinking it discovers that objects are phenomena and not essential beings. Take this stone under my feet. It seems to me at first to be something complete in itself, * but observation and reflection convince me that it is heavy and attracted to the centre of the earth and to the sun and to all the stars, however distant. Change the weight of the earth and you change the weight of this stone, and the relation of its gravity to its cohesion changes, and who knows whether a single quality of it would remain as it is ? Everything is phenomenal, a manifes tation of a sort of ratio of forces hidden behind the visible objects, and these visible objects reveal those forces in their properties and changes. Since the discovery of the law of gravity by Newton our studies of the world have been coming gradually to this stage. I call it the " concrete" stage of thought, because it thinks things in their concrete relations. c. But this is not the highest stage of thought. Even natural science has achieved a higher thought than this in its best minds. Plato long ago discriminated four stages of thought, and called the highest stage the one that thought things as a totality or as a whole, whose principle he called u self-movement." Looking not at any result in particular, but at the spirit of the scientific inquiry, or at the method it uses, we have found that its purpose is to study an object as a part of a process having a history. We have seen how it traces out the several stages of the process and finds the antecedent steps through which the object came to be as it is, and infers the steps that it will next develop. Any process is complete when its end produces its beginning again. Then each fact is explained by all others, and contributes in turn to their explanation. The First Principle, as seen by the most elementary stage of thought, is an atom, or rather a universe of atoms. For it looks upon everything as perfectly real, perfectly independent. If it</page><page sequence="19">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science f 425 thinks of the action of one thing upon another, it is in the habit of personifying things after the manner of Feticism. There is not One Supreme Person, but many co-ordinate personalities exist for it in accidental relation to each other. Each is an atom at rest, or a personal atom when in motion. The second stage of thought has begun to reflect profoundly. It has seen essential relation, or dependence. Since the discovery of dependence resolves what had seemed separate and plural into unity?for a dependent being is only a part of some whole that is independent?it follows that this second stage arrives at an all absorbing unity as the First Principle of the universe. It reaches a pantheistic view of the world. This is the prevailing stage of culture of those who are interested in natural science on account of its general surveys of the universe, just as feticism is the natu ral point of view of those who are interested in the mere inventory of the things of the world, the first stage of science and the first stage of thought. It may be well to remark here that even the highest religion, when seized by a mind incapable of any other than the atom-stage of thinking, will be lowered into some form of feticism. The third stage of thought arises in natural course by the growth of reflection up to the point where it sees the totality of relation. Relation traced out must return to the being from whence it started. This is to be clearly conceived only as self-activity. Even the doctrine of Persistent Force, upon which Mr. Spencer lays so much stress as the ultimate idea of science, involves this notion of self-activity, as we have already shown. For this per sistent force, which is neither heat, light, electricity, nor magnet ism, but is the underlying force, is certainly not correlated with any of the particular forces, but is a totality by itself. Hence it is not incited to activity by another force, but must be self-incited. It incites all the special forces to activity while itself is self-de termined. V. Theism the True Outcome of Science. To the question whether modern natural science is pantheistic, therefore, we are constrained to answer, Yes, in its middle stages of thought, because the second stage of thinking is in its very na ture pantheistic. But modern natural science is likewise atheistic</page><page sequence="20">426 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. when we view it as reflected in minds that have not got beyond the first stage of thought. They do not reach a thought of a unity transcending all finite individuals, but rest in the idea of an in definite multiplicity of atomic individuals. But science is theistic in all minds that see the trend of its method. The study of all things in the light of the history of their evolution discovers a progress toward " perfect form" or conscious being. Stated in the law of survival of the fittest, the universe is so constituted as to place a premium on the development of intellect and will power. This would be impossible on the basis of pantheism. In proportion to the degree of self-activity reached by any indi vidual, it achieves control over nature and possesses ability to make social combinations with its fellows. By this capacity for social,, combination, man of all animals is able to move against nature in an aggregate as a race, and infinitely surpass his efforts as an individual or as a multitude of individuals detached from organi zation into a social whole. It follows that in proportion as science directs itself to the study of human institutions it becomes im pressed with the superiority of spiritual laws over the laws govern ing organic and inorganic bodies. By intelligence and will man can form institutions and make possible the division of labor and the collection ana distribution of the aggregate productions of the entire race. Each individual is enabled by this to contribute to the good of the whole, and likewise to share in the aggregate of all the fruits of industry. AVliile material bodies exclude each other and do not partici pate, spirits, endowed with intelligence and will, participate and share in such a manner as to raise the individual to the potency of the race. This amounts to making the individual a universal. When each receives the fruits of the physical labor of all, each fares as well as if he were sole master and all mankind were his slaves; but as master he would be charged with the supervision and direction of all?an infinite burden ; this burden he avoids in free social combination, wherein each for his own interest works at his best for the sake of the market of the world, and thus bene fits all, though incited by his selfish desire for gain. The mate rial productions of the race are, however, of small moment com pared with the fund of human experience, which is first lived and then collected and distributed to each man, so that each lives the</page><page sequence="21">Is Pantheism the Legitimate Outcome of Modern Science ? 427 life of all and profits by the experience of all. The scientific man inventories nature through the sense-perceptions of all his fellow-men, and assists his reflections by the aid of their ideas. The life of the whole is vicarious; the individual gets its results without having to render for them the equivalent of pain and labor incident to the original experience. Participation is the supreme principle of the life of spirit?of intelligent and volitional being. Experience has discovered, by the mistakes of myriads of lives, what human deeds are conducive to the life of participation which endows the individual with the fruits of the labor and the wisdom of this experience of the race. Hence the will acts in the channels marked out as co-operative with the whole. This is moral action. As science widens its domain and correlates one province with another, it comes to realize in consciousness the spiritual principle of participation which makes science itself possible as the accred ited knowledge attained by the joint labors of the race. It comes to realize, moreover, that its method implies in another shape the same principle, because it makes each fact throw light on every other while it explains each in the accumulated light of all the rest. Using the symbol of society, and its principle of participa tion which is the essence of spiritual life, we may say that science spiritualizes nature by setting each of its individual facts in the light of all facts, and thus making it universal by the addition of the totality of its environment. Unless the universe were based on a spiritual basis, whence could come the significance of the universal as the illuminating and ex plaining principle? Just as the principle of the division of labor in the province of productive industry, so, too, the principle of specialization in the prosecution of scientific investigation is ren dered possible by the spiritual principle of participation. It pre supposes the collection and distribution of the results of all and to all. While material products diminish by distribution, spiritual products, in the shape of moral habits and intellectual insights, in crease by being shared. The more a truth is reflected in the minds of others, the better it is defined and understood. The investigator may safely trust himself on his lonely journey into details because he is sure that these details are fragments of the total process and organically related to the whole, so that he is</page><page sequence="22">428 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. bound to find the unity again when he ha$ completed the discov ery of the history of the fragment before him. The typical man of science,'Cuvier, can see the whole animal in one of his bones; Agassiz can see the whole fish in one of his scales; Lyell can see the history of a pebble in its shape and composition; Winckel mann sees the whole statue of a Greek goddess in a fragment of the nose or the angle of the opening eyelids. "All is in all," as Jacotot used to say. But not the fulness of realization of the highest is in the lowest. The lowest presupposes the highest as its Creator, of which it is the manifestation, although not the ade quate revelation. By so much as material bodies lack of self-ac tivity they lack of revealing the highest principle. According to the principle of Evolution, all things are on the way toward the realization of the perfect form. The perfect form is self-activity, as personal intelligence and will. While in the lower orders of being the individual is farthest off from realizing the entire species within its singularity, yet in the higher orders that possess intel ligence and will, this becomes possible, and each may, by continued activity, enter into the heritage of the race in knowledge and ethic al wisdom. The perfect form is that complete self-determination which constitutes Absolute Personality. Finite relativity is grounded on the self-relativity of such an Absolute. In the in vestigation of this field of relativity Science is discovering the pre supposition, and in this quest it is therefore on its way toward Theism.</page></plain_text>
