Daum* ABSTRACT Between 1830 and 1870 the infrastructure of civil society in Germany expanded signifi- cantly. In spite of the failure of the 1848 revolution, the culture of the Biirgertum, the middle classes, began to flourish through associations, educational efforts, and diverse media and institutions of public life. The study of natural history and the new natural sciences became an integral part of this seminal process. This essay examines the develop- ment of civil society through the interplay of science, religion, and politics, which is paradigmatically embodied in the biography of Emil Adolf Rossmassler. As a science teacher, free-religious activist, and democratic politician, Rossmassler became one of Germany's preeminent advocates of science as a civil practice, though one who acted out- side university science and the mainstream of academia. Rossmassler and many of his peers understood the study of nature as a democratic exercise and sought to integrate the natural sciences into the German concept of education (Bildung). Instead of associating themselves with the philosophical materialism of the time, however, they drew heavily on the thinking of Alexander von Humboldt and prolonged a reconciliatory understanding of nature into the public sphere. A look at their efforts reveals the richness and diversity of a civil culture of nature studies outside the realm of state-supported science and univer- sity research. INTRODUCTION IN 1830 POLITICAL UNREST swept over Europe. Barricade fights broke out in the streets of Paris at the end of July, and public protest forced the Bourbon king to abdicate. These events questioned the setting of monarchical rule that had been restored at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815, and they reverberated throughout Europe, stimulating similar movements from Spain to the Russian border. Though many of the revolutionary efforts failed in the short run, their underlying ideas of democracy continued to survive among the bourgeoisie, artisans, and workers.1 The * Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University, 27 Kirkland St., Cam- bridge, MA 02138; adaum@fas.harvard.edu.

DAUM foundations of the monarchist system swayed under the pressure of democratic de- mands, which were seen by many as preconditions for the realization of a civil soci- ety: the quest for individual freedom and a rule of law, for constitutional government and a participatory model of politics, for a market-oriented economy and an aboli- tion of social privileges based on tradition and birth. In the German-speaking territories, the realization of civil society still seemed a utopian project around 1830.2 Too segmented were the social strata that would po- tentially encompass the ideals of such a society, too diverse were their political inter- ests, and too fragmented was the social formation of the Biirgertum, the middle classes including the bourgeoisie as its core group, whose social position was based on economic position and educational merits. In spite of these factors, the set of ideas that had been laid out by social thinkers in the late eighteenth century, refined by early reform movements in the wake of the French Revolution, and expressed in the revolutionary movements around 1830 would continue to reverberate in Ger- many in the coming decades. Political energies aiming at materializing the ideals of a civil society-and thereby to create a society based on liberal norms, practices, and institutions-could, as historian James Sheehan has written, "be frustrated, in- hibited, or displaced, but they could not be destroyed."3 One stage on which the ongoing quest for a civil society unfolded between 1830 and 1870 emerged from a peculiar interplay of science, politics, and religion. A look at one exemplary biogra- phy, that of the naturalist and democratic politician Emil Adolf Rossmassler (1806- 1867), and an analysis of his activities as an agent of civil society both illuminate and explain the character and consequences of this interplay. A LIFE IN THE AGE OF CIVIL SOCIETY: EMIL ADOLF ROSSMASSLER In 1830, the same year Charles X was forced off the French throne, a young man in the southeastern German kingdom of Saxony became interested in politics.

In 1827 Rossmassler had abandoned the study of theology at the Uni- versity of Leipzig, Saxony's largest city, after only two years to become a teacher at a small school in nearby Thuringia. This position had allowed him enough time to devote himself to his favorite subject, botanical studies. In 1829, Rossmassler had successfully applied for a vacant teaching position at the Saxon Forest Academy in Tharandt4 and had been assigned to instruct the students in zoology, later to be complemented by botany. Four months after Rossmassler's official installation, in September 1830, the revolutionary wave surging over Europe seized the kingdom of Saxony. In Leipzig, young craftsmen revolted against the police, and in the city of Dresden activists stormed the city hall with the Marseillaise on their lips. Ross- missler, "deeply shaken to my core" ("im Innersten aufgeriittelt"), immediately left for Dresden to witness the events.5 Though focused on academic teaching and writing over the course of the next eighteen years, Rossmassler remained affected by the ideals of the 1830 revolution- ary movement and never lost touch with contemporary politics. He slowly began to develop his own ties to democratic forces in Saxony, becoming part of a growing communication network that articulated political concerns through associations, fes- tivals, newspapers, and journals. In the coming years, this network, which emerged from local settings, would extend outward to the regional level and eventually be- come a national political discourse in 1848.6 Despite his involvement, Rossmassler was not a significant political talent, nor would his political interests ever outweigh his scientific ambitions. From the 1830s on, however, political and scientific think- ing merged in his worldview, a conflation both facilitated and enforced, in a way, by a specific religious affiliation. This merger marked Rossmassler's thinking and activities until his death in 1867. The German revolution of 1848 turned the interplay of science, politics, and reli- gion into a public affair. Many of Rossmassler's contemporaries shared his funda- mental belief that any sound societal order had to be grounded in a scientific view of the world. According to this conviction, religious devotion had to be channeled away from the institutionalized churches and-through the mediation of science teachers-directed toward the admiration of the natural world. Consequently, free- thinking and politically engaged scientists such as Rossmassler tried to create demo- cratic political structures by cultivating nature studies. Their hero was a man whose affinities for democratic and liberal ideas were already well known, but whose close affiliation with leading circles of established scientists in Europe and with the royal court of the Prussian king made him, on first view, a rather surprising model to 4 William R.

Rossmassler himself wrote his name with two German fis (RoBmaBler). However, even among contemporaries and in bibliographies and library catalogs the spelling varies. To facilitate the spelling for tracing Rossmassler in both German and non-German catalogs, I therefore stay with the spelling "Rossmassler." 6 See Wolfram Siemann, Vom Staatenbund zum Nationalstaat: Deutschland, 1806-1871 (Munich: Beck, 1995), pp. 204-49. 109</page><page sequence="4">ANDREAS W DAUM emulate: Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), cosmopolite, traveler, and Germa- ny's towering figure in the field of natural sciences.7 Imbued with the spirit of Humboldtian thinking, Rossmassler and those sympa- thetic to his ideas left a remarkable imprint on postrevolutionary cultural and intel- lectual life in Germany, despite numerous obstacles and even open resistance by state and church authorities. They helped launch a broad movement to make science popular among the German population, although the legitimacy and potential intel- lectual authority of this field remained highly contested.8 The growing infrastructure of civil society shaped the efforts of Rossmassler and others; their activities, in re- turn, served to reinforce the very structures and ideological trajectories of this soci- ety: the emphasis on the value of education, the goal of enhancing an understanding of self-determination of individuals as well as social groups, the spread of free asso- ciations and print media, and the expansion of the public sphere as a crucial platform for civil discourse.9 The following article takes the life of Emil Adolf Rossmassler as a biographical prism for examining the interplay of science, politics, and religion as part of the project of civil society. Although far behind many university scientists in public reputation, Rossmissler was well known among contemporaries, yet later historians have barely paid attention to him.10 Casting a fresh look at such a figure gives us the 7 The most reliable account of Humboldt's life is still Hanno Beck, Alexander von Humboldt, 2 vols.

His biography reflects in a uniquely telling way how sci- ence, politics, and religion interacted in mid-nineteenth-century Germany.12 BETWEEN BURGERTUM AND BILDUNG: ARGUMENTS ABOUT GERMAN HISTORY FROM 1830 TO 1870 The years between 1830 and 1870, which coincided with Rossmassler's professional life, have long been accepted as a crucial period of social transformation and intel- lectual change in Germany as well as in Europe as a whole.13 Most of central Europe and England witnessed the breakthrough of industrialization, the rise of rationalistic, positivistic, and scientific thinking, and the emergence of the middle classes as agents of social change. These processes were accompanied by a rise in the working- class population and the persistent presence of the aristocracy in some areas of soci- ety. The precise connection between these processes and their overall relationship to political democratization and what has often been called modernization have long been disputed, nowhere more so than in the case of Germany. The potentials of civil society in Germany lie at the core of these debates. In the debate about Germany's road to modernity, the classic argument has been that Germany failed to establish the key values of civil ideology because it lacked a strong social formation, a Burgertum that would have been able to achieve the breakthrough of civil society (biirgerliche Gesellschaft). This was particularly the view after 1933 (and, indeed, after 1945) when historians and political scientists tried to explain the rise of National Socialism by looking for the long-term tenden- cies in modern German history that eventually led to Hitler. In Germany, they claimed, unlike in other Western countries, a gap widened over the course of the nineteenth century between rapid economic modernization and political democrati- zation, which allowed state authorities, the military, and old elites to dominate the political arena and deny claims for participation raised by the middle classes and workers. This vision of a German Sonderweg, a "special path," into modernity began to be powerfully challenged by a new generation of historians. They rejected the notion of a model trajectory toward civil society based on the English example and warned against seeing the German revolution of 1848 as a failure and a mere indica- tor of bourgeois (burgerlich) weakness. From different standpoints, David Black- bourn, Geoff Eley, and Thomas Nipperdey argued that throughout the nineteenth 1 As examples for such an approach, see Fritz Ster, The Politics of Cultural Despair (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1961); as well as Klaus Vondung, ed., Das wilhelminische Bildungsburger- tum: Zur Sozialgeschichte seiner Ideen (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1976); Rudolf Schenda, Volk ohne Buch: Studien zur Sozialgeschichte derpopuldren Lesestoffe, 1770-1910, 3d ed. (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1988); Adrian Desmond, The Politics of Evolution: Morphology, Medicine, and Reform in Radical London (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1989). 12 This focus on Rossmassler as a paradigmatic figure in order to delineate the character of civil society in Germany differs, therefore, from the systematic treatment of popular science in German history that I have suggested elsewhere; see Daum, Wissenschaftspopularisierung (cit. n. 8). 13 The best overview of German history across the century is provided by David Blackbourn, The Long Nineteenth Century: A History of Germany, 1780-1918 (Oxford and New York: Oxford Univ.

DAUM century Germany, rather than going through a backward process of feudalization, experienced a rise in civil values, attitudes, and societal practices-that is, a large- scale process of embourgeoisement, or Verburgerlichung.'4 Since then, various research efforts have scrutinized the complex fabric of Ger- man civil society and set it in comparative perspectives.'5 The classic argument about a "special path" has given way to a far more nuanced view. Recent accounts have shed a much more positive light on the strengths of German Burgertum and the power of the process of Verbiirgerlichung. Given the heterogeneous social com- position of the German middle class, however, historiography now tends to turn away from static social definitions of civil society and to view it more as a set of intellectual attitudes, material lifestyles, and cultural dispositions-that is, to see civil society as a social and cultural practice, an attitude of Biirgerlichkeit. Among its characteristics are the valorization of work and a rational and disciplined way of life; an appreciation of the family as the basis of that civil life; respect for high culture, the arts, and education (Bildung); the pursuit of the rule of law and urban prosperity; membership in free associations as vehicles for social self-organization and intellectual activity; and the free articulation of political beliefs in the media of the public sphere.16 This in turn facilitates an examination of the place of science, politics, and religion in the context of civil society in Germany. Between 1830 and 1870 contemporaries primarily conceived of "science" as the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften), a field only beginning to find its institu- tionalization in different branches at German universities.17 Science encompassed 14 See David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, The Peculiarities of German History: Bourgeois Society and Politics in Nineteenth-Century Germany (Oxford and New York: Oxford Univ.

One of the main challenges for promoters of both natural history and the natural sciences was how to cast these fields within the German conception of education. Harking back to the eighteenth century and the post-1800 educational reforms that led to the founding of the University of Berlin and the establishment of the Gymna- sium as the main vehicle for higher education, the concept of Bildung relied particu- larly on the historical, philosophical, and philological disciplines.'8 Bildung primar- ily meant intellectual and moral self-cultivation and was separated from practical education and mere utilitarian purposes. Contemporary terminology reflected this juxtaposition in the dichotomy between humanism and realism; the latter placed a heavy burden on the promoters of education in natural sciences, forcing them to struggle against all kinds of negative stereotypes. Moreover, from the perspectives of the state and conservative politicians, utilitarianism was believed to have politically dangerous and morally perilous effects, an argument that made the situation even more difficult for scientists.19 These were the obstacles Rossmassler faced as he sought to make science an integral part of civil life. The political stigmatizing of the natural sciences indicates that the realm of politi- cal discourses was, in fact, fundamentally broadened during the mid-century. This trend, which originated in the Enlightenment epoch, gained strength after 1848, when a distinct proletarian society and culture began to take shape.20 They were heavily affected by a growing interest in education as a means of achieving individ- ual freedom and enhancing the social progress of the proletarian population. But the early workers' movement was not as attached to the ideals of humanism as the de- fenders of the ideology of Bildung were. On the contrary, the movement put special emphasis on the study of natural sciences,21 thus creating alliances between proletar- ians and those members of the middle classes who saw the natural sciences as a Modell fur Wissenschaftspolitik im Europa des 19.

DAUM proper field for enhancing understanding between different social groups. One of the main goals of bourgeois social reformers and liberals was to incorporate prole- tarians into civil society by means of education, and Rossmassler himself became one of the primary advocates of this strategy. These kinds of alliances helped keep the lines between proletarian and bourgeois cultures blurred until the end of the 1860s.22 As to the question of religion in this equation, historiography, particularly in the case of Germany, is still approaching the topic of science in culture mainly from the perspective of the Kulturkampf. Most accounts structure their observations along a dichotomous model that is based on the ardent conflicts between progressive liberals on the one side and conservative followers of the-primarily Catholic-church on the other side, embodying the contemporary paradigms of modem education and ecclesiastical stubbornness. Recent studies, however, have corrected this dualistic view in regard to British and North American history and have underlined those historical instances in which science and religion reacted to one another in a more differentiated manner, leaving room for mutual respect, reconciliation, or even con- vergence.23 Similarities can be found in nineteenth-century Germany. Pluralization in religious life, which would reach its peak around 1900, had already led to a diver- sity of religious attitudes during midcentury.24 The diverging religious positions ei- ther remained within the confines of the established denominations, mainly those of the Protestant and Catholic Churches, or found expression in dissenting, nondenom- inational, and nonconformist movements that rejected organized religion but never- theless displayed religious attitudes or even created new religiously-imbued ideolo- gies.2 Amid these changes, scientific thinking could and did, as this article argues, find an integral place in the diverging strands of religious thinking and even infil- trated the dominant denominations.

The first argument concerns the way in which science has been situated in the overall context of civil society. A peculiar state-centrism and a concentration on university science have dominated our picture of science in German history from the nineteenth century on. The success story of the German university system still eclipses alternative narratives, which have scarcely been explored. In particular, the history of the natural sciences in Ger- many has been studied almost exclusively in terms of institution building at universi- ties, state funding, cooperation between state and industry, and the professionaliza- tion of scientists-that is, phenomena that undoubtedly contributed in an important way to the enhancement of civil life.26 The roles that individual scientists and scien- tific disciplines have played in the formation of the German nation-state and the German public have therefore attracted considerable interest.27 I would like to sug- gest a complementary approach. This article seeks to demonstrate that the commit- ment to science outside state-influenced educational institutions also played a crucial role within the culture of science in particular and civil culture in general; indeed, the field of nonuniversity science deserves further examination, including the vast array of lay activities in the field of natural history and what has been called amateur science in the British and American cases.28 My second argument deals with the ideological consequences of the interplay of science, politics, and religion in Germany's civil society between 1830 and 1870. Undoubtedly, our sense of the cultural impact that the natural sciences had on nineteenth-century society has been shaped considerably by our understanding of their role in the process of secularization and the "disenchantment of the world" 26 Charles McClelland, State, Society and University in Germany, 1700-1914 (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge Univ.

DAUM (Max Weber).29 Accounts of this era usually depict efforts to enhance and promote a scientific education as essential elements in the universal process of secularization. The natural sciences have most often been described in terms of their mechanistic and materialistic approaches to natural phenomena independent of nonphysical and nonmeasurable influences. It has often been taken for granted that those views served as catalysts in the spread of antireligious tendencies. This understanding as- sumes that those who spread scientific knowledge in the public-intentionally or not-helped undermine the cultural power of religion. Recent studies have complicated the one-dimensional picture of a linear process of secularization in which rationalization and materialistic thinking supposedly tri- umphed and swept away the power of religion.30 Revisionist accounts focus primar- ily on the fin-de-siecle in order to point out strategies of "enchantment" in the world of science and to show ambiguities in the contemporary reception of modernity.31 Both phenomena, however, are rooted in ideological traditions that go further back in history and, at least in part, emerged from the relationship between nonuniversity science, liberal thinking, and dissenting religion between 1830 and 1870. Taking Rossmissler's biography as a paradigmatic example, this article highlights those ideological currents based on a Humboldtian understanding of nature and aimed at a reconciliation between science, metaphysics, and even religion. This approach helps us to realize that many of the ambivalences and seemingly contradictory ele- ments of modernity in the late nineteenth century, particularly at the fin-de-siecle, were already present in the decades between 1830 and 1870-that is, during the breakthrough of industrialization and the rise of science as an institutional power. ON THE ROAD TO A "PEOPLE'S EDUCATION": ROSSMASSLER IN THE DEMOCRATIC AND FREE-RELIGIOUS MILIEUS A drawing, published at the time of his death in 1867, shows Emil Adolf Rossmis- sler as a small, sober-looking man. (See Figure 1.) He looks nothing like a political agitator or a revolutionary hero. Obviously, Rossmassler preferred to be represented with the instruments and objects-such as a microscope and forceps, a shell and botanical findings-that marked his primary field of interest, natural history. From this drawing, it is hard to imagine that Rossmassler ever left his study and exchanged his microscope for a political pamphlet. Yet he did, and scientific, political, and religious interests interacted in an intriguing way in this biography. 29 Max Weber, "Wissenschaft als Beruf," (1919), reprinted in Uber das Studium der Geschichte, ed.

During the 1830s and early 1840s, Rossmassler remained focused on his aca- demic tasks at the Forest Academy in Tharandt and published scientific treatises in all classical fields of natural history, in addition to writing textbooks for students. He also began to publish, in installments, an iconography of European mollusks, which eventually became the most comprehensive and reliable compendium of its kind.32 During this time, Rossmassler made several scientific trips; one led him to Berlin, where he gained the acquaintance of Alexander von Humboldt. 32 Emil Adolph Rossmassler, Iconographie der Land- und Susswasser-Mollusken, 3 vols.

DAUM Starting in 1840 Rossmassler intensified his contacts with democratic groups in Saxony. Like those in many other German states, Saxon democrats were increas- ingly organizing themselves through the formation of political parties, free associa- tions, public festivities, and discussions in periodicals and newspapers. Rossmissler joined a local Biirgerverein, an association of young democrats from the lower bour- geoisie. He also maintained contacts with members of the second chamber of depu- ties in Saxony and with the progressive Sanger (Singers) movement, a semipolitical association that grew out of the cultivation of patriotic singing.33 In 1843 Rossmass- ler, still teaching at the Forest Academy, joined two young lawyers in forming the core of a local progressive party (Fortschrittspartei); all three began contributing political articles to the press of Saxony's opposition forces.34 By this time, Rossmas- sler had already gone through the steps of political socialization that many of his contemporaries from the democratic and liberal strands of German society followed: membership in political and semipolitical associations, articulation of democratic beliefs in the periodical press, and concern with issues of law and self-organization on the grassroots level of German society. In 1845 Rossmassler took another step into the democratic milieu, one that al- lowed him to unite his heterogeneous interests in a nonconformist religious ideology. He left the Protestant Church and became a member of the so-called German- Catholics. The German-Catholics had split from the Catholic Church in 1844 in protest against pilgrimage practices and other rituals that centered around the au- thority of the papal church. They were heavily connected to a parallel movement on the Protestant side, the Lichtfreunde (Friends of Light); the two groups would offi- cially merge in the 1850s.35 German-Catholics as well as the Friends of Light en- compassed a heterogeneous set of beliefs ranging from ardent atheism and a reli- giously imbued socialism to a monistic pantheism and a so-called religion of humanity. Both free-religious groups also tolerated beliefs closer to Protestant and Catholic assumptions, but couched them in strong anti-dogmatic terms. In general, the free-religious movement turned against clerical orthodoxy, the authoritative claims of established theology, and institutionalized hierarchies, thus becoming a part of the democratic movement in Germany. German-Catholics and Friends of Light were joined by many members of the progressive camp, and they developed strong affinities for the natural sciences as the basis of a moder worldview and popular education.

Alexander von Humboldt and his Cosmos volumes, which were just beginning to appear in the mid-1840s, played a crucial role in this context and immediately at- tracted immense public attention. (See Figure 2.)36 Earlier, Humboldt had published specialized works on such topics as volcanism, the geography of plants, and galva- nism. He had written massive travel accounts and scientific documentations on his trips to South and Central America (1799-1804) and Russia (1829), encompassing sociological, economic, and historical observations, and he had also published a collection of scientific essays (Ansichten der Natur, or Views of Nature) with an underlying tone of aesthetic appreciation of nature greatly welcomed by many read- ers.37 Cosmos surpassed all of his earlier works and revealed all of Humboldt's strengths (and his weaknesses, such as his elaboration on details in the third to fifth volumes that appeared to many already outdated at the time of publication.) The first two volumes, published in 1845 and 1847, in particular provoked extraordinary interest among German readers. Here, Humboldt outlined his endeavor to "compre- hend the phenomena of physical objects in their general connection, and to represent nature as one great whole, moved and animated by internal forces."38 Humboldt's ambition in his first two Cosmos volumes was at least threefold: to provide readers with exact scientific data on a comprehensive physical description of the earth and the sky, based on precise measurements taken during his trips and extended through decades of correspondence with fellow scientists; to reflect on the impact that human knowledge, the historicity of this knowledge, and aesthetic views of nature have on constructing such a comprehensive image; and to give himself an appealing "delin- eation," or, better, "painting of nature."39 Cosmos enjoyed a particularly enthusiastic reception among members of the free- religious communities. This compendium of the natural world, imbued in the first two volumes with historical, philosophical, and aesthetic reflections, realized a much-wanted unification of scientific analysis and aesthetic appreciation of nature harkening back to Romantic thinking. Neither an encyclopedia nor a mere holistic essay, Humboldt's magnum opus sought to derive "laws that regulate the forces of the universe" from empirical observations and to delineate the "order and harmony pervading the whole universe," thus depicting a harmonious interplay of all natural phenomena.40 Free-religious authors quickly capitalized on the Humboldtian un- derstanding of harmony in nature to ascribe a religious meaning to the study of na- ture. Nature itself became the center of religious devotion and was depicted as a 36 Alexander von Humboldt, Kosmos: Entwurf einer physischen Weltbeschreibung (Stuttgart and Tiibingen: Cotta, 1845-1862).

He contributed significantly to the propagation of a "free natural Weltanschauung,"43 a philosophy based on a combina- tion of free-religious beliefs, scientific insights, and Humboldtian cosmology. In 1851 Rossmassler expressed his convictions in a "nature sermon to the people": propagating a "religion of fraternity," he used highly emotional and descriptive lan- guage to depict nature as the all-embracing "house of God" and as the "beautiful motherly home" in which humankind should seek reconciliation with itself and see the model of a sound societal order.44 The question of science as an object of public discussion and even as the basis for societal order gained more prominence when the revolution of 1848 brought several democratically minded scientists to the forefront of public life. A number of scientists as well as German-Catholics and Friends of Light were elected as mem- bers of the Prussian Parliament in Berlin and the first German National Assembly, which convened in the Hessian city of Frankfurt in May 1848. Voters in Saxony elected Rossmassler to the German National Assembly, where he joined a leftist parliamentary group and contributed to the deliberations of the committee for school affairs and the subcommittee for affairs of the elementary schools. On Germany's most prominent political podium at the time, Rossmassler made himself known as a fighter against any church influence on public schools. He vehemently argued for state control of Germany's entire school system, hoping thus to reject any pressure from ecclesiastical parties.45 His personal attitude toward religion followed this trajectory, setting a provocative example of anticlericalism in education. During his time as parliamentary deputy in Frankfurt, Rossmassler sent two of his four children to a Jewish school and joined other members of the National Assembly in a reform- minded, irenic association where Christians, religious dissenters such as the German- Catholics, and Jews convened.46 Although Rossmassler remained in the second rank of delegates, he was the most prominent scientist in the parliament with the exception of the geologist Karl Vogt, who later became even more famous as the advocate of a polemical scientific materi- alism.47 When several German governments ordered the delegates from their regions 42 Humboldt, Cosmos (cit. n. 36), vol. 1, p. 25; again, the English translation is not precise and misses some important nuances because in the German original, Humboldt talked about the "Gefiihl der freien Natur" and "d a s F r e i h e [sic] (wie wir tief bedeutsam in unserer Sprache sagen)" which could literally be translated as "the sentiment of free nature" and "freedom, as we say with a deeper meaning in our language."

DAUM to pull back from the parliament in the spring of 1849, Rossmassler and some of the other parliamentarians chose, despite immense pressure, to continue to convene at an alternative site, the Swabian town of Stuttgart.48 In mid-June troops ultimately forced the remnants of the National Assembly to dissolve, and its members were dispersed over the country or had to leave the German states. The dissolution of the freely elected national parliament in 1849 marked the end of the German revolution and the beginning of what contemporaries and historians have called the time of "reaction." During the succeeding decade, governments and state administrations introduced new restrictions on public life and systematically persecuted demo- crats.49 Shortly after the dissolution of the National Assembly in June 1849, Rossmassler decided that his quest for a democratic Germany should materialize in the fields he knew more intimately than politics: natural history and the emerging natural sci- ences. He turned "from an academic professor of natural science to a natural history teacher for the people."50 The subtle terminological shift from natural science to natural history indicated Rossmassler's ambivalence about finding a proper label for scientific education at a time when the natural sciences themselves were in the pro- cess of becoming institutionalized and still facing opposition as a field of instruction. Significantly, this shift also refers to the conception of natural history as a descriptive science and reflects the concern of many science popularizers that natural history represented the actual testing ground for a culture of amateur science and the partici- pation of laypeople in nature studies. The dichotomy between a (more popular) natu- ral history and the (more academic) natural sciences helped widen the gap between the popularizers of science in Germany and university scientists who did not neces- sarily dismiss a broader concept of education, but pursued the latter on the basis of their own empirical and specialized scientific research and from a more secure posi- tion within civil society. Rossmiissler himself began to reconceptualize Bildung as Volksbildung, a "people's education" addressing all social strata of the population, which he envis- aged as the key area in securing a future for a "morally" and "politically free" Ger- man people. Beyond the traditional understanding of Bildung, based on the ideology of neohumanism, Rossmassler's concept was particularly rooted in the natural sci- ences and asked for massively increasing technical, financial, and pedagogical sup- port for science teachers. This concept relied on the assumption that education in Offentlichkeit in der deutschen Gesellschaft: Zu den Anfangen einer Popularwissenschaft nach der Revolution von 1848" Hist.

THE POLITICS OF "NATURAL WELTANSCHAUUNG" Rossmassler's transformation from a civil servant to an advocate of science educa- tion without institutional security and a freelancer in the field of popular science occurred as much out of necessity as out of choice. In Saxony the Ministry of Educa- tion suspended him from teaching because of his political past, and the government indicted him for high treason. The court, however, found him not guilty of the charge. Instead of resuming his academic teaching, Rossmassler started touring through a number of German cities in the winter of 1849-1850 to give widely at- tended public lectures on natural history. The former professor was eager to spread his new "natural Weltanschauung,"53 to ingrain the spirit of Humboldtian thinking in the minds of the German population. In addition, he depended on honoraria to secure a living for himself and his family. Rossmassler shared this dual motivation with many of his colleagues who made the public sphere their field of professional enterprise.54 Following up on his promise to enhance the people's education, Ross- massler strengthened the didactic element in his presentations and put particular weight on the visual imagery. Thus he used large, spectacular charts (which he pro- duced himself) to show drawings of fossils and other natural objects, and he demon- strated the use of the microscope by putting enlarged slide preparations on display.55 Rossmassler's reputation as a democratic politician caused the police to closely monitor his lectures, but such scrutiny did not dampen Rossmassler's enthusiasm. Already part of the democratic network in Saxony before 1848, Rossmassler contin- ued to work for his ambitious goal of spreading people's education in Germany through the vehicles and media that were essential elements of the ongoing project of expanding the realm of civil society: the print culture of journals and books, public discussions such as those generated at his lectures, and the increasing num- ber of free associations. Beyond his public appearances as an "itinerant scientific preacher," as Rossmassler half-ironically labeled himself,56 the former professor de- veloped a broad range of activities. In 1852 he helped to found the first major journal in Germany explicitly devoted to popularizing science, Die Natur (Nature). Ross- missler even drafted the front cover of this journal: he put a volcanic eruption on display, a highly political metaphor for the power of unbound, dynamic forces.

Die Natur was meant as a general magazine for all branches of sciences, and it stressed the importance of natural sciences in post-1848 Germany and in- cluded specialized treatments of natural phenomena. The journal also offered infor- mation on the book market and on natural history associations. Rossmassler himself contributed numerous articles and illustrations; through its illustrations and visual features Die Natur contributed significantly to an increasing visual mass culture in journalism. (See Figure 4.) Between the lines, some of Rossmassler's articles could be read as political statements. For example, in his examination of natural and arti- ficial systems-a problem that biologists had long been struggling with in their attempt to find a proper classification for the natural world-Rossmassler left no doubt that "artificial systems" were "arbitrary" and "enforced" and that any true "order," following Humboldt's thoughts, derived from natural needs and the inner structure of the natural world itself.57 Rossmassler also published his lectures and wrote books on natural history for 57 Emil Rossmassler, "Kiinstliche und naturliche Systeme" Die Natur 1 (1852):110-1. 124</page><page sequence="19">Figure 4.

DAUM the lay public.58 Those books addressed well-known phenomena of the natural world-such as the forest and its animals, the four seasons, and water-in order to guide his readers into the realm of scientific knowledge. Rossmassler's Populaire Vorlesungen aus dem Gebiete der Natur (Popular Lectures from the Realm of Na- ture) of 1852, based on public talks given in previous years and devoted to Hum- boldt, explicitly asserted that the people had, as the author put it, a "property right" regarding scientific knowledge.5 In this and other books Rossmassler repeatedly asserted his firm opinion that the study of nature through an improved science educa- tion would be the only way toward a democratic renewal of Germany. He thus posi- tioned himself between the idealism of the early nineteenth century and the radical materialism of contemporaries such as Karl Vogt and Ludwig Biichner. Rossmassler went so far as to call nature the "great reconciler" of his time.60 Rossmassler knew that educating the people on the basis of science education as an innovative expansion of the concept of Bildung meant not only lecturing to a growing population, but also applying a more dialectical approach in order to induce this population, above all the middle classes and the workers, to actively cultivate their own interests in nature studies and create concrete opportunities to practice these interests. Teaching an audience and encouraging this audience to teach itself were two equally important sides of "people's education." It was against this back- ground that Rossmassler became the first person to promote the use of home aquari- ums in Germany. Following up on a wave of popular interest in aquariums in En- gland, which began in the early 1840s,61 Rossmassler published a widely read article on the "sea in the glass" in Germany's most popular family magazine in 1856; a year later he followed with another manual, which eventually became his most successful book, going through five editions by 1892.62 Rossmassler conceived of aquariums as a means of promoting lay interest in zoology and establishing nature studies in the daily life of the bourgeoisie. Rossmassler realized that both the domestic sphere of private households and the public sphere of popular media and educational insti- 58 E. A.

Consequently, he also agi- tated for the creation of a museum for "patriotic natural history" in Saxony.63 It hardly came as a surprise that in 1859 Rossmassler finally founded his own natural history magazine, Aus der Heimath (From the Home Region). He believed Die Natur, whose editorial board he had already left in 1854, was becoming too elitist, and he wanted to address ordinary people, particularly artisans, in a more direct way.64 Aus der Heimath, whose subscription price lay significantly below that of Die Natur, presented itself to readers as a "people's magazine for the natural sciences" and covered a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from technology to botany, often illustrated by excellent drawings. Because there were many teachers from ele- mentary schools among the subscribers, Aus der Heimath in fact served as a journal for the needs of scientific school education. But Aus der Heimath also vigorously advocated increased science teaching far beyond school education. The journal even called for reserving a place for the natural sciences in kindergartens and at popular festivals, and recommended scientific books and instruments for parents seeking suitable Christmas gifts.65 Rossmassler himself left no doubt that his journal was devoted to the specific mission of explaining the close interplay of science, politics, and religion in the postrevolutionary era. He neither hesitated to use Aus der Hei- math to write about the liberal-national movement, which gained new strength after 1859, nor shied away from addressing the highly disputed relationship between moder science and religion in its pages. Rossmassler explicitly warned against em- barking on the "ugly war between the church and the natural sciences" and often appealed to the reconciliatory metaphor of "mother nature." Again and again, Ross- massler invoked the image of nature harmoniously structured according to "natural laws" and based on the ideas of Alexander von Humboldt, who became the indisput- able intellectual point of reference for Aus der Heimath.66 While books and journals offered important outlets for articulating the concerns of educational reform and science education, the free associations were no less im- portant as avenues for organizing civil society and articulating its concerns.67 Natural history associations offered basic means of communication and incorporated even remote local and regional areas into a dense network in which information, journals, and specimens were exchanged and visits of itinerant public speakers organized. Open to nonscientists and scientists alike, these associations significantly contrib- uted to spreading knowledge, giving laypeople an opportunity to participate in this 63 Rossmassler, Volksbildung (cit. n. 60), p. 92. 64 Emil Adolf Rossmassler, ed., Aus der Heimath: Ein naturwissenschaftliches Volksblatt Amtliches Organ des Deutschen Humboldt-Vereins (Glogau, 1859-1866); not published with the subtitle until 1861. 65 "Die Naturwissenschaft im Kindergarten" Aus der Heimath 3 (1861): 529-32; "Die Naturwis- senschaft auf Volksfesten," Aus der Heimath 4 (1862): 787-90; "Naturwissenschatliche Weihnachts- geschenke," Aus der Heimath 4 (1862): 771-4.

DAUM knowledge, and practicing a sort of "science training"68 for those not professionally linked to universities. The natural history associations thus significantly helped both to preserve and to expand the role of amateurs in German society. Rossmassler had realized that associations and their work on the local level would provide him with an ideal means of enhancing the understanding of science in Ger- man society already by the early 1850s. On September 25, 1852, during the last session of the annual-and most prestigious-meeting of German scientists and physicians, the Gesellschaft deutscher Naturforscher und Arzte, a national associa- tion founded in 1822, Rossmassler had pleaded for a "generalization of the efforts of natural history associations." He had asked the professors and scientists present at the meeting to declare their solidarity with the concerns of the people, to share their knowledge with the local population, and-in pursuit of these goals-to form local natural history associations with scientific collections.69 This particular plea had not resonated with those assembled, but this negligence did not matter in the long run: the network of local natural history associations had already grown sig- nificantly during the previous years and continued to expand even more rapidly dur- ing the decades between 1850 and 1880.70 Rossmassler eventually added to this expansion himself. In 1859 he initiated local Humboldt Associations as "scientific people's associations"71 in memory of the uni- versal scholar who had passed away on May 6, 1859. Humboldt Associations soon spread through the border regions of Saxony, Silesia, and Bohemia; several succes- sors were established in other parts of Germany. The associations under the name of Humboldt embodied an ambitious attempt to organize lay scientific activities. They were designed as a new type of free association for naturalists. They renounced all distinctions of class and gender, and in contrast to the existing societies for natu- ral history, the Humboldt Associations were explicitly aimed at the lower social strata, particularly artisans and small business owners, and focused on lay activities in local settings such as the collecting of specimens, the common reading of relevant literature, and excursions into the countryside. In 1861 Rossmissler and some of his friends proposed a German Humboldt Asso- ciation in order to establish closer bonds between the small and dispersed societies and to create a popular version of the Gesellschaft deutscher Naturforscher und Arzte. As the German Humboldt Association took shape in 1861, the arrangement of festivities and celebrations-already accompanying the Humboldt meetings be- fore-moved into the foreground at the conventions. Humboldt Festivals, as Ross- massler and his supporters now called these conventions, began to orchestrate local elites, representatives of different professions such as teachers, and visitors from other regions into a dense program consisting of toasts, speeches, songs, excursions, visits to regional attractions, festive dinners, and such. This was in microcosm a culture of civil festivity that the Gesellschaft deutscher Naturforscher undArzte had 68 See Michael D. Stephens and Gordon W.

It connected the social world of natural history teachers and scientists with what was already an essential element of civil society: the public display of sociability that provided Burger with opportunities not only to articulate their immediate concerns and ideals, but also to define their identities as participants in a widening civil culture and symbolically state their political claims.72 The Humboldt Associations acted in close connection with other associations within the democratic and liberal political spectrum, such as societies for workers and artisans. This politicization of public science went hand in hand with Rossmass- ler's willingness to return to political activities and coincided with the political and national reawakening of the so-called New Era, which had begun in 1858. In the New Era, German state governments loosened political restrictions, new liberal ac- tivities unfolded, and the idea of a nation-state gained strength.73 Rossmassler's Humboldt Associations and the accompanying, annual Humboldt Festivals were part of this movement and had a clear national orientation, grounded in the democratic and liberal convictions of former supporters of the 1848 revolution. While his per- sonal interests remained almost exclusively devoted to botanical, zoological, and ecological issues, Rossmassler engaged in the political arena with the same objec- tives that the Humboldt Associations pursued in reaching out to the lower social strata. In Leipzig Rossmassler personified the policy of integration that leading members of Germany's liberal bourgeois movement pursued in an effort to harmo- nize the interests of the middle class, artisans, and proletarians. He became active in several associations for the spread of Bildung, and he insisted that knowledge about the natural sciences would be a key element in the reform movement that sought to integrate proletarians into bourgeois society.74 In the winter of 1862-1863, Rossmassler became the major opponent of Ferdi- nand Lassalle, the socialist agitator and later founder of the first socialist party in Germany, in the debate over the best way to organize the growing proletariat. While Lassalle sought to create a distinct workers' party on a national level, Rossmassler advocated continuing the educational efforts for workers and artisans by liberal asso- ciations and imbuing these efforts with the idea of nature studies and science educa- tion based on rational analysis.75 Both men agreed on the necessity of spreading scientific knowledge. Lassalle, however, called for scientific rationality in the articu- lation of a proletarian political program that clearly disassociated itself from liberal bourgeois policy and pursued a confrontational strategy; Rossmassler extrapolated 72 On the importance of civil festivities, see also Dieter Diiding, Peter Friedemann, and Paul Munch, eds., Offentliche Festkultur: Politische Feste in Deutschland von der Aufklirung bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg (Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1988); and Manfred Hettling and Paul Nolte, eds., Biirgerliche Feste: Symbolische Formen politischen Handelns im 19.

DAUM his natural science interests into a harmonistic vision of a just society in which the pursuit of nature studies per se would balance divergent social interests. In Rossmassler's view, every proletarian would and should become a "disciple of Humboldt."76 In the spring of 1863, the leading workers' committee in Leipzig opted for Las- salle's program and prepared a new institutional platform, the General German Workers Association, which was officially founded on May 23 of that year. Although Rossmassler's rather diffuse program did not succeed, one month later, opponents of Lassalle assembled around Rossmassler and other representatives of Germany's bourgeoisie to call a Convention of German Workers Associations (Vereinstag deutscherArbeiter-Vereine) into being. But Rossmassler had already begun to with- draw from politics. After 1863 he refocused on nature studies, the Humboldt Associ- ations, and his journal Aus der Heimath. Increasingly stricken by physical problems, however, Rossmassler could no longer pursue his projects; planned Humboldt Fes- tivities for 1864 and 1865 had to be canceled. In 1866 he rallied enough to join the socialists August Bebel und Wilhelm Liebknecht in founding the People's Party of Saxony, but that same year he saw his Aus der Heimath cease publication, no longer financially competitive in the expanding market for nature journals. On April 4, 1867, Rossmassler died in Leipzig. His fame slowly decreased in a society that- paradoxically-had absorbed his ideas and made them more fruitful than ever in the years after his death. Then, institutionalized science education and professional- ized popularization went far beyond Rossmassler's initial enthusiasm. Rossmissler remained well remembered by those groups who maintained a vivid interest in people's education, such as school teachers of natural history, and many of his books underwent numerous reprints and revised editions later in the century.77 Although Rossmassler remained marginal in terms of Germany's state-supported university system and many of his projects enjoyed only limited success, his efforts and those of his associates had a tremendous impact on Germany's cultural life. The history of nature journals is a telling example. To be sure, journals such as Die Natur and Aus der Heimath rarely had more than three thousand subscribers;78 but their true impact lay in the fact that they pioneered science journalism and created a print market that rapidly expanded, in Germany no less than in other countries.79 There was an extensive circulation of articles and topics, even on an international scale,80 and numerous authors wrote simultaneously for several periodicals.

In addition, many natural history associations started opening libraries, subscribing to popular science journals, and offering these journals to their members. BEYOND THE "RESEARCH IMPERATIVE": SCIENCE AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF CIVIL SOCIETY Rossmassler was certainly the most enthusiastic pioneer of a "natural Weltanschau- ung" based on Humboldtian views in mid-nineteenth-century Germany. But his ideas did not reflect only an individual disposition; their essential ingredients can be found among many of his contemporaries. Rossmissler embodied a new intellectual and social type in Germany, that of a public-oriented naturalist and advocate of sci- ence outside the institutions of science. This type deliberately replaced the "research imperative," which was essential to pursuing a successful career in university sci- ence,81 with an imperative in the public sphere. For Rossmassler and others, popular- izing science became both a vocation and a profession. These popularizers could mostly rely on their own training as science students at universities, but they were no longer embedded in the social and communicative network of universities. Pro- fessional popularizers could not rely on the security net and the social prestige that German professors enjoyed by virtue of their status as civil servants. Members of this group came from very different backgrounds and thus evade generalization. They included sons of Protestant preachers who had a strong amateur interest in science; religious dissenters searching for a new rationality in the reli- gious worship of nature; teachers at primary and secondary schools trying to extend their interests into the public sphere; political journalists who discovered that the reading public had a growing interest in pieces about science; medical doctors who did not succeed at universities; and democratic-minded scientists whose careers at state institutions had failed after 1848. Strikingly in the German case, no women figured prominently in this group.82 In general, this heterogeneous group can be seen as a generational cohort that was educated and politically socialized after the 1830 revolution, and thus exposed to democratic ideas, which they often embraced. A surprisingly high number of them had some commitment to the free-religious movement or became active during the political mobilization of 1848. Consequently, some suffered under the ensuing "re- action." Due to political or social reasons or from personal preference, hardly any of them maintained formal links to a university. They occupied, however, a crucial place in civil society. Two examples may illustrate this argument further. Like Ross- massler, his younger contemporary Otto Ule, born in 1820, had started to study 81 R. Steven Turner, "The Growth of Professorial Research in Prussia, 1818 to 1848-Causes and Context," Hist.

DAUM theology but switched to the natural sciences.83 During the early 1840s he became a supporter of the Friends of Light. In 1847 Ule began holding public lectures on topics in natural history and soon devoted himself to explaining Humboldt's Cosmos to the lay public in the town of Frankfurt (Oder). Ule supported the democratic left in 1848 and was sent to prison after the revolution because of his political opinions. After some weeks of imprisonment, he eventually moved to Halle (Saale). The city of Halle had a well-established reputation as a center of philosophical rationalism and nature studies, dating back to the Enlightenment and built on a firm tradition of Protestant educational institutions. In Halle, Ule became coeditor of Die Natur and involved himself in numerous urban associations, ranging from the local society for geography to the municipal fire brigade and the progressive party (Fortschrittspar- tei), where liberal-minded Burger came together. Ule also strongly supported Ross- massler's Humboldt Associations and joined the former zoology professor in propa- gating the Humboldtian Weltanschauung through numerous articles and popular books devoted to spreading the "cosmic view" of nature.84 While Otto Ule remained a jack-of-all-trades in Halle's Burgertum until his sud- den death in 1876, his contemporary Alfred Brehm, born in Thuringia in 1829, took up similar activities in a number of places. Like Ule, Brehm came from a strong Protestant family in which nature studies had always been cultivated. In fact, his father, the Protestant pastor Christian Ludwig Brehm, was one of Germany's most prominent amateur scientists and an expert in ornithology.85 After an apprenticeship as a craftsman and the study of architecture in Dresden, Alfred Brehm spent nearly five years on an expedition in Africa (1847-1852). Soon after his return, he estab- lished links to Rossmassler and the editor of the family magazine Gartenlaube and eventually became Germany's best-known zoological journalist. Brehm had already published accounts of his African trip and now continued to report on his subsequent travels, bringing the "exotic" to the private homes of his readers in Germany. Not surprisingly, Brehm tried his luck as director of the zoological garden in Hamburg (1863-1866) and afterward founded and directed the first public aquarium in Berlin. Brehm's fame, though, arose from the publication of his multivolume Tierleben (An- imal Life), which became a bestseller and a classic Christmas gift for children of bourgeois families.86 In his Tierleben, Brehm developed a highly anthropomorphic style of animal narrations, which became extremely popular with readers from all social classes. 83 See [Rossmassler,] "Otto Ule," Die Gartenlaube 6 (1858): 664-6; and Karl Miiller, "Otto Ule" Die Natur 25 (1876): 405-6, 416-7, 431-2, 442-3. 84 Otto Ule, Aus der Natur: Essays (Leipzig: Frohberg, 1871-1873), a collection of essays taken from Die Natur; idem, Ausgewdhlte kleine naturwissenschaftliche Schriften, 5 vols (Halle: G.

Beyond this group, however, were oth- ers who acted as public mediators and helped to place nature studies and scientific issues on the agenda of public discourses and make them relevant to burgerlich life. Among these were academic mediators, based at universities, who contributed to the lecture programs of free associations, supported educational institutions, and wrote articles in the nonacademic press. And there was a cohort of eminent profes- sional scientists who became opinion leaders in academia and acted as "public scien- tists."87 Above all this holds true for Justus Liebig (1803-1873), who reorganized chemistry as a laboratory-based professional science; Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), cofounder of modem medical pathology and cell theory; Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896), expert in electric physiology; and Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1894), exponent of modem physiology and physics, who was ennobled in 1883 and from then on could add "von" to his last name.88 Clearly, all of them greatly influenced the public perception of science and became prominent examples of a burgerliche elite, one that had made its way up on the social ladder toward success and prestige by pursuing key ideals of civil society: work discipline, educational merits, aca- demic training, and respect for a rational view of the world. But their motivations for the promotion of science were not the same as Rossmassler's, Brehm's, or Ule's. Their public appearances, as recent historiography has emphasized, were aimed at securing state funding for their research, legitimizing their new disciplines and insti- tutes, and pursuing their social interests as a new elite.89 It would be misleading, however, to equate the public promotion of science in general during the decades between 1830 and 1870 primarily with the social interest of this rising elite. Rather, Liebig, Virchow, Du Bois-Reymond, and Helmholtz formed one group-though un- doubtedly the best known-among the many scientists who reached out to the Ger- man public, and their social interest can be generalized only to a certain extent. It is telling that Rossmassler asked Rudolf Virchow for support in the plan to establish the Humboldt Associations but failed to persuade the Berlin professor, who in principle supported the idea, to attend any of the Humboldt Festivals. Professional popularizers and the eminent "public scientists" moved in quite different social circles and seldom met in professional contexts. The meetings of the Gesellschaft deutscher Naturforscher und Arzte offered them one of the rare opportunities to do so, but often Rossmassler and many of his colleagues could not afford to travel to the 87 1 borrow this term from Frank M.

Rossmassler did find himself in contact with someone who undoubtedly surpassed, in his mind, any living scientist. Remarkably, Alexander von Humboldt himself had corresponded with Rossmissler and praised him for writing "truly popular writings" with the "noble purpose of distributing useful knowledge and refuting the dogmatic axioms of an arrogant half- knowledge, accumulated for centuries."90 In 1855, in an enthusiastic congratulatory letter thanking Rossmissler for his book on the Four Seasons, Humboldt captured the essence of Rossmissler's democratic concept of science emphasizing the local context of nature studies. Humboldt explicitly lauded the nonacademic purpose of the book and subtly supported the political implications of Rossmassler's think- ing: "You have intended to stimulate, to extend knowledge, to be useful and restore the grace of local nature. Given the current condition of the German people this is gratifying in double respect: 'The Free,' ... the enjoyment of the 'free' nature, re- mains to the Germans, as they put it beautifully and significantly in their lan- guage."91 After 1860 university scientists became increasingly involved in the business of popularization. Many of them became contributors to nonscientific journals, sup- ported new and professionalized educational institutes for the general public, or started to give lectures at educational associations and natural history associations as in the cases of Rudolf Virchow, Hermann Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, and the astronomer Wilhelm Foerster, in order to promote the "civilizing power of science."92 Clearly, the general appreciation of science as an integral element of Bildung in Germany's civil society did not emerge from either the efforts by Ross- massler or the public statements by Virchow alone; rather it developed in a dialec- tical process that was neither a bottom-to-top ascendance nor a simple trickle down of knowledge. RECONCILIATION AND NATURAL LAWS: THE HUMBOLDTIAN VISION Most of the science popularizers of the pioneering generation between 1830 and 1870 left no doubt about the subtext of their nature writings. They depicted a world of harmony ruled not by human action, but by natural laws. In both subtle and ex- plicit ways, their writings voiced a plea for liberty and equality to "reverberate as a reminder in the field of science." They claimed that only devotion to nature would "heal the wounds" of political battles and that only science would be the "real repub- lican power" of intellectual life.93 For these men, anchoring the natural sciences in the infrastructure of civil society was a means of securing a democratic future. Some caveats, however, have to be kept in mind. Though democrats and liberals dominated 9 Alexander von Humboldt to E. A.

Presenting scientific knowledge to the lay public became the self-appointed task of all kinds of ideological and political groups. This forms an important background against which the role of religion and the polyvalences in the later reception of Darwinism in Germany have to be con- sidered.94 Investigating the concepts and images of nature that underlay the public represen- tation of science also reveals a diversity of contemporary views. Until now, histori- ography has concentrated almost exclusively on the most radical of these views, as articulated by the followers of scientific materialism, the so-called materialists. This meant essentially three authors: the medical doctor Ludwig Buchner (1824-1899), brother of the literary author Georg Buchner; the Dutch physiologist Jacob Mole- schott (1822-1893); and the zoologist and geologist Karl Vogt (1817-1895), who escaped to Switzerland after his term as a member of the German National Assembly of 1848-1849. These three men shared a radical antimetaphysical approach, one that reduced natural phenomena to mechanistic, physiological processes.95 Buchner and Vogt, in particular, expressed their convictions polemically and categorically dis- missed all religious beliefs. The publication of their most important books in the early 1850s led to heated controversies and forced all three out of the German uni- versity system. The three materialists certainly rocked the boat, and their writings were widely distributed. But they remained clearly in a minority position. Most popular writers, including Rossmassler and Ule, did not adopt the radical antimetaphysical view. They clung to the philosophical idea of science that Alexander von Humboldt had put forward in the first half of the century. They preserved Humboldt's cosmic con- cept of nature, which bore strong elements of Romantic nature philosophy. They revitalized the idea that empirical research had to go hand in hand with an aesthetic perception of nature and that it depended on a philosophical idea of unity. Otto Ule's immensely successful biography of Alexander von Humboldt helped to cast the emi- nent savant as a hero and a model for a "scientific people's literature"; Humboldt's Cosmos, according to Ule, had hit the "dull atmosphere" of postrevolutionary Ger- many like "purifying lightning." Its publication embodied the "liberation of the 94 For the latter, see William M. Montgomery, "Germany," in The Comparative Reception of Dar- winism, ed. Thomas F. Glick, 2d ed.

Science descended from its arrogant, laughable throne to arrange its place in the midst of the people."96 Alexander von Humboldt, not the radical materialists, inspired most of the nature- writing in Germany after the revolution. Much of this writing devoted itself to a "Real-Idealismus"97 that in the following years would even survive critics of religion such as David Friedrich StrauB and Charles Darwin. (Darwin's Origin of the Species appeared in 1859, the same year that Humboldt died.) This "real-idealism" endured well into the fin-de-siecle. Neo-idealistic concepts of nature enjoyed immense popu- larity at that time. Around the turn of the century, the two most prominent German science writers, Ernst Haeckel and Wilhelm Bolsche, developed pronounced antima- terialistic positions, and popular writers propagated what I would call a cosmic evo- lutionary theory that was inspired far more by Humboldt's static and aesthetic imag- ery of nature than by Darwin's more dynamic model.98 These observations on the schism between materialistic and cosmic thinking again raise the question of religion. The radical, anti-Christian materialists remained a minority in the discussion of science education from 1830 to 1870; among both liberals and conservatives, there were numerous attempts to go beyond a dichotomy of science versus religion, as already indicated in the case of Rossmassler. It is a persistent myth that "devout defenders of Christianity simply surrendered to the enemy the techniques of popular science."99 In fact, Catholics as well as Protestants began to use these techniques in postrevolutionary Germany. A striking example is provided by the Catholic journal Natur und Offenbarung (Nature and Revelation). Founded in 1855 as an "organ for the reconciliation between scientific research and faith," Natur und Offenbarung certainly differed from such journals as Die Natur or Aus der Heimath in fundamental ideological ways. The Catholic publishers re- nounced ardent materialism and Brehm's anthropomorphic animal narrations. But over time, their reports became increasingly similar to those published elsewhere in the popular science press and remained attentive to the newest research develop- ments.'1? Natur und Offenbarung eventually survived all of its competitors on the print market. The fate of this journal is indicative of the highly ambiguous stand Catholicism took toward the dynamic forces of civil society. No less important were the attempts by democrats and liberals to reconcile science and religious beliefs. Surprisingly, the cultural climate of the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s did not simply follow the Kulturkampf model, although there were, of course, bitter struggles between devout supporters of the Catholic Church and freethinking liberals. Yet significant intellectual space for reconciliation also existed. The case of Rossmassler shows that this is true especially for those groups commonly placed under the vast rubric of anti-Christian freethinkers: the German-Catholics and the 96 Otto Ule, Alexander von Humboldt: Biographie fiir alle Volker der Erde, 3d ed.

Rossmassler and those of his colleagues known as free-religious Humboldtians clearly urged the separation of church and state. At the same time, however, they refused to incite the obvious conflict between Christianity and scien- tific materialism. Through their interpretation of Humboldt's Cosmos, men such as Rossmissler and Ule tried to reach a conciliatory third way between religious orthodoxy and atheist materialism. They emphasized the idea of harmony, and-following the irenic at- titude Rossmassler had already demonstrated in his private life during his time in Frankfurt in 1848-allowed their audiences and readers to maintain a diversity of religious views and theological positions, including Christian beliefs. Therefore, the free-religious support for the natural sciences, as much as it aroused hostility from the established churches, did not result in a clear antagonism between science and reli- gion; rather, it offered an opportunity to blur the lines between these two fields. In light of these observations, a central element of the common model of modern- ization in nineteenth-century history becomes questionable: the assumption that the spread of scientific knowledge inevitably accelerated, perhaps even caused, the pro- cess of secularization. This argument might be true if one ascribed a purely rational- istic, antimetaphysical character to science in nineteenth-century culture. However, if we note the representations of scientific knowledge in the nonacademic public sphere, we are confronted with a much more complicated picture. Secularization does not exclude the creation of a new religiosity outside established denominations and even includes the integration of science into confessional thinking, such as that of Catholics. Science between 1830 and 1870 thus can be seen as a cultural good that represented empirical research and the Humboldtian search for unity, a cultural good that could include the Christian search for documenting the power of God in designing nature. Science certainly marked the cultural field in which the world became disenchanted by looking at cell structures and physiological processes in- stead of relying on philosophical narratives. Science, however, could also represent a cultural field that produced new strategies of reenchantment aiming at a harmonious picture of nature, accessible to and acceptable by diverse strands of society, includ- ing conservatives and churchgoers. Modernity, in other words, becomes more am- biguous. SCIENCE AS CIVIL PRACTICE AND CULTURE Natural history and the emerging natural sciences gained an important place in the infrastructure of civil society between 1830 and 1870; they reinforced the modes of civil sociability and became part of the ideals and practices of Biirgerlichkeit. Sci- ence became a civil practice between 1830 and 1870 as it was institutionalized at universities, transformed into a public good, and slowly accepted, while still dis- puted, as an element of civil culture and Bildung. Inspired by democratic hopes, which could not be realized during the revolution of 1848, new groups of public mediators began to incorporate the natural sciences into civil society and its institu- tions, thereby promoting the very project of Biirgerlichkeit. In particular, the inter- play of science, politics, and religion worked as a catalyst in this development and contributed to the expansion of the public sphere. In the biography of Rossmassler, these processes converged paradigmatically. 137</page><page sequence="32">ANDREAS W. DAUM Democrats and liberals, conservatives and churchgoers, free-religious individuals and atheists contributed to the new appreciation of science in civil culture. All of them helped create a new cultural market of scientific information and nature- oriented ideologies. This market was solely dominated by neither the small group of academic leaders and "public scientists" nor the fervent followers of radical mate- rialism. Instead, popularizers such as Rossmassler who pursued conciliatory strate- gies in the wake of Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos played a crucial role and formed new enterprises in the service of science education outside state institutions. These observations facilitate the integration of the history of science into the dis- cussion on the development of civil society and its public sphere during the nine- teenth century. In particular, they help to make the image of science in Germany less state centered, less bound to professionalization and academic institution building, and less framed by the establishment of scientific disciplines. Integrating the history of science into the history of civil society helps us to appreciate the immense array of nonuniversity modes that existed for the production, transformation, and con- sumption of knowledge in German society. The spread of this knowledge into local and regional spaces outside universities-even into leisure activities and local pubs'01-thereby becomes more visible. This approach allows us to take into ac- count the achievements of those mediators who were not only not supported by, but even excluded from universities, and who are therefore easily dismissed as outsiders and losers. A shift of interest from the state-funded system of science to nonuniversity at- tempts to integrate science into civil society helps us to contextualize the history of science in broader terms and to expose and further explore the close link between science in German history and political, social, and religious developments in gen- eral. As Roger Cooter and Stephen Pumfrey have rightly reminded historians, it is scarcely possible to draw a rigid opposition between popularization from above and public reception from below. Ultimately, then, we need a concept of science that acknowledges historically existent hierarchies of knowledge, but at the same time is less exclusive. There might then be more space to discuss what some have called "expository science," what Steven Shapin indicated when he mentioned the need to know more about the "ethnoscience" of our own, Western societies, and what Cooter and Pumfrey reflected on when they addressed the concept of "ethno-natural knowl- edge" or, even more encompassing, "natural knowledge." The latter concept would include everything from "genuine," "official" science to popular science, pseudosci- ences, and craft knowledge.102 This reorientation would also mean that we have to reconsider the umbrella term "science" when entering the sphere of popular culture, as it has been conceptualized by Peter Burke, Roger Chartier, and others.103 When Rossmassler showed graphics 101 As a case study, see Anne Secord, "Science in the Pub: Artisan Botanists in Early Nineteenth- Century Lancashire," Hist.

One might well as- sume rather that they relied on different layers of knowledge, some that came into existence as a result of learning from current academic research, others drawing on traditional learning experiences such as everyday-life observation. The exemplary biography of Rossmassler raises questions that are worth being discussed on a larger, transnational scale. How does knowledge acquire the character of public knowledge, and when, how, and under which methodological precondi- tions is science defined as a public endeavor? Recent studies, for example, have dealt with these problems in the treatment of how the new natural philosophy acquired authority and legitimacy in England from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centu- ries, establishing the experimental method and the notion of science as a "public science."04 If "claims to knowledge become accepted insofar as they are embodied in effective acts of communication" as Jan Golinski has aptly written,105 the require- ments for efficiency and the power of communicative strategies-their enabling fac- tors as well as restrictions-deserve close scrutiny. Rossmassler's successes as well as the limits of his resonance are cases in point and underscore the necessity of seeing the validity of public knowledge in the social context of those who promoted this knowledge.106 Finally, connecting the history of science to the history of civil society and the public sphere contributes to a reconsideration of some of the master narratives that have been constructed in both fields. A closer look at the interplay of science, poli- tics, and religion reveals the dynamism of a period long regarded as stable and reactionary. This view highlights the ambiguities of modernity, and it underlines the paradoxes of secularization. It helps us to see elements of reenchantment and religious worship of nature in a world that was disenchanted by rationalism and to the Nineteenth Century (Berlin and New York and Amsterdam: Mouton, 1984); Tony Bennett, Colin Mercer, and Janet Woollacott, eds., Popular Culture and Social Relations (Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire and Philadelphia: Open Univ.
