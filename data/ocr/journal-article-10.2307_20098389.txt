<plain_text><page sequence="1">KENNETH MEGILL GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST* The publication of Georg Lukacs' Aesthetics has been widely hailed as one of the most significant philosophical events of our decade.1 This major philosophical work meets the high standard which Lukacs set for himself - to "apply Marxism to the problem of aesthetics" (I, 16).2 Lukacs has effectively destroyed the argument of those who have claimed that there could be no Marxist aesthetics by producing an aesthetics which must be recognized as a significant work by both Marxist and non-Marxist philosophers. It is perhaps natural that the primary work of interpreting and evaluating this work will be done by those interested in aesthetics. Some of the explication and analysis has already begun, some in English, more in German.3 Important as Lukacs' latest work may be for aesthetics, perhaps of more general interest and of potentially much greater importance is the kind of philosophy which Lukacs has begun to do within the last ten years. He calls this philosophy 'ontology' and has entitled his forthcoming book, Zur Ontologie des Gesellschaftlichen Seins (On the Ontology of Social Being). According to Lukacs, the Aesthetics is just the first in a series of ontological works which will include an ethics and a systematic study of the nature of society, as well as the aesthetics. The fact that an important philosopher sets forth after he is 75 years of age to write ontological works is astounding. But to begin such a project in the 1960's appears to many as either a sign of senility or as a failure to keep up-to-date with current philosophical developments. The uniqueness of Lukacs' attempt requires a consideration of the place of the ontological works in relation ship to his earlier works as well as a tentative evaluation of the important elements of his ontology. Lukacs' interest in aesthetics and literary works dates from the beginning of this century until the most recent publication of his systematic aes thetics. As Lukacs points out in his introduction to the Aesthetics: I began as a literary critic and essayist and sought my theoretical support in Kant's aesthetics and later in that of Hegel. The first plan for an independent systematic Studies in Soviet Thought 9 (1969) 334-353; ? D. Reidel, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 335 aesthetics was made in Florence in the winter of 1911-12 and I developed this plan in Heidelberg in the years 1912-14. I still remember with great thankfulness the well intended critical interest which Ernst Bloch, Emil Lask, and above all Max Weber, showed in my attempt (I, 2). The 50 years after 1912 were filled with events which made Lukacs an important figure not only in philosophy but in politics and literary criti cism as well. The completion of the Aesthetics is really a completion of a life-long project, but the Aesthetics is more than a summation; it is far more the beginning of a significant new philosophical phase in Lukacs' life. One can distinguish three major periods in Lukacs' philosophical activity: (a) Philosophical and political activity until Geschichte und Klassen bewu?tsein (1923). (b) Literary and philosophical critical works (until 1956). (c) Ontological works (since 1956).4 In every period of Lukacs' life one can find philosophical, political, and literary critical works. Even in his earliest works on aesthetics which he wrote before World War I there is an 'ontological' tone and manner of writing. Although it would be a mistake to separate the three periods of Lukacs' life in any sharp way, one must recognize that Lukacs, as an historically important thinker, has already been influential in two separate fields. Among the students and the new left, particularly in Europe, the name of Lukacs is understood to mean the author of Geschichte und Klassen bewu?tsein. Even though Lukacs has repeatedly renounced this early work it has been widely read and discussed. In the introduction for the re issuance of this classic work as a part of the collected works, Lukacs has described how he judges his development to and beyond Geschichte und Klassenbewu?tsein. But no matter what Lukacs may say about this early work, it is nevertheless a book which has had and continues to have great influence. Among the students of the new left, Lukacs' Geschichte und Klassenbewu?tsein is considered to be one of the classics in the non Stalinist Marxist tradition and is the source of much of the theory of the new democratic movement. For these younger people who are in volved in both a political struggle and in the development of a theoretical position, Lukacs' discussion of the nature of orthodox Marxism, the strategy of the organization of the workers' movement and the concepts</page><page sequence="3">336 KENNETH MEGILL of 'Praxis' and ' Verdinglichung9 is still the best available. Geschichte und Klassenbewu?tsein is today not only an historically important work - it is one of the most important works for understanding the theory and practice of the new left in the 1960's. It is difficult to imagine that even when this work was published 45 years ago, Lukacs was already 38 years of age and yet that today its primary appeal is still among the younger generation. The works of the second period of Lukacs' career which deal primarily with literary criticism have already become classics. Both in Hungary and abroad, directly and through his pupils, his influence continues to the present day. In the United States and England the second Lukacs of literary criticism is far better known than the first of political theory and philosophy.5 During the 1930's and early 1940's Lukacs was forced to live in the Soviet Union and was not able to play any significant role in the political developments of his time. It was during this time and from 1944-56 when he was a professor of aesthetics at the University of Budapest that he was able to write and publish the great bulk of his literary and critical works. It is true that during this period he also completed the two philosophical critical works, Der Junge Hegel (written 1938, published 1948) and Zerst?rung der Vernunft (published 1954), but nothing of the systematic nature of either Geschichte und Klassenbewu?t sein or of his current ontological works was written. The appearance of the Aesthetics and the forthcoming publication of other ontological works marks the beginning of a third important period in Lukacs' life. After 1956, when Lukacs was forced to retire from the university and was expelled from the party for his role in the 1956 revolt, he had the leisure to devote himself to completing the long-delayed Aesthetics. Of course in this new period there is an obvious continuity with the earlier periods (particularly with the discussion of 'Verding lichung' in Geschichte und Klassenbewu?tsein and his classical study of the young Hegel), but the current period is distinguished by the fact that Lukacs has returned to writing general philosophical works. During the long domination of Stalinism and dialectical materialism, Lukacs devoted himself primarily to working out a theory of aesthetics within the Marxist tradition. The ontological works mark a return to philosophy by a great thinker who has lived and written enough during the 'interlude' to already merit consideration as an important thinker of our century. His return</page><page sequence="4">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 337 to philosophy is a demonstration (as was Geschichte und Klassenbewu?t sein) that philosophical work, political activity, and being a Marxist are not incompatible. Indeed it would seem that, at least in the person of Lukacs, this combination can produce the highest quality of work. To yield to the temptation to look upon the ontological works as historical works even before they have been completed is to miss their significance as the beginning of a new stage in Marxist philosophy. Lukacs brings the great intellectual and philosophical tradition of Marxism in the twenties to the philosophical problems of today. He is the only Marxist philosopher who was active and creative in the twenties and who is active and creative today. In his works and in his life we find the continuity necessary for developing a Marxist philosophy which can take its place in the philosophical life today. Although the Aesthetics is written in a style which betrays the fact that Lukacs received his philosophical educa tion before World War I, it is still a most important and creative contribu tion to the philosophical discussion of the 1960's. Precisely because the Aesthetics is the work of the sixties, it promises to produce yet a third generation of Lukacs adherents - the philosophical followers of Lukacs. Instead of undertaking an impossible summary of the Aesthetics, we shall focus here on two of the important concepts of Lukacs' ontology - the concept of the every-day and the nature of science and aesthetics - in an attempt to identify some of the important problems with which Lukacs deals in his latest period. I. THE EVERY-DAY Perhaps the greatest barrier to understanding the latest period is the use of the old-fashioned word 'ontology' to describe his philosophy. For Lukacs, the Aesthetics is an ontological work although he does not explicitly discuss the nature and function of ontology in this work. In a recent interview, Lukacs has said that We use the pretty word ontology, and I am getting used to it, although one really should say that he discovers the form of Being (Seinsform) .... The fact that new phenomena can be fundamentally genetically derived from their every-day existence (Alltagsdasein) is only one moment of a general context, namely that Being is a process of an historical kind. Being does not, in a strict sense, exist at all; precisely that Being which we like to call every-day Being (Alltagssein) is a certain highly relative determi nation of complexes within an historical process.6</page><page sequence="5">338 KENNETH MEGILL Lukacs is an ontologist who denies that Being, in a strict sense, exists at all. He is an ontologist who insists that to understand Being, one must investigate the nature of what he calls the Allt?glich, the everyday. Lukacs' ontology takes on a peculiarly practical and historical form which sets him apart from other ontological works such as Whitehead's Process and Reality or Hartmann's massive ontological works. For him the best ex ample of an ontological work is the discussion of the nature of money in Marx's Capital. An ontological work, because it is a discussion of forms of Being, must be an historical work. The every-day life of man must be understood as historically developed. An ontology cannot pro vide us with eternal categories which are revealed by reason, insight, or any other abstract philosophical method. The problem of Lukacs' on tology is to discover the Seinsformen which are revealed in our every-day experience and the forms of human activity which have been produced in the history of man.7 Since ontology begins its investigation by considering the nature of the forms of existence present in every-day life, the first chapter of the Aesthetics, 'Probleme der Wiederspiegelung im Alltagsleben' (Problems of Reproduction in Every-Day Life), occupies a particularly important place in Lukacs' ontological works. In the opening pages of the Aesthetics he sketches a theory of the nature of the every-day which provides the possibility for developing not only an aesthetics, but also a philosophy of science, an ethics, and a philosophy of religion. The conduct of man in every-day life (Alltagsleben) is most important, but this is an area which is to a large extent uninvestigated, despite its central position for under standing the higher and more complicated forms of reaction .... The every-day conduct of man is at once the beginning point and ending point of every human activity (1,13). Although Lukacs insists that the nature of the every-day has not been investigated, it is evident that the problem of every-day experience and language has been at the center of philosophical discussion in this century. If we were to look for similar problems which have been the focus of philosophical investigation, not only could we think of obvious examples, such as the late Husserl's discussion of the Lebenswelt, but also of the discussion of the nature of ordinary language and of the naturalism which has been widely accepted in the English speaking world. In the English philosophical tradition, those concerned with the problem of the nature of common sense have also dealt with what Lukacs calls the every-day.</page><page sequence="6">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 339 Although Lukacs may not be correct when he says that he is a lonely pioneer in treating the nature of every-day experience in contemporary philosophy, he is still one of the few philosophers to discuss the problem of the ordinary life as an ontological problem. Lukacs does not start from every-day life as some kind of given, but attempts rather to under stand how every-day life is constituted and how the products of man's activity change the nature of every-day life. The tendency among most other philosophers in this century who have approached the problem with which Lukacs deals has not been to take the forms of every-day life or every-day language as products of social development, but as products which have a fixity and certainty because they are every-day. The every day has priority for Lukacs only in the sense that it is the starting point and ending point for all human activity. Being is historical for Lukacs and one understands the forms which Being takes by an investigation of every-day life as a product of past human activity which changes in the course of history. By quoting Marx (a passage which is relatively un known, so that it is necessary to bring it here despite its length), Lukacs explains why the problem of the every-day has not been satisfactorily treated in the philosophical tradition: In his judgment of Ricardo Marx says: "Ricardo correctly (for his time) considered the capitalistic production as the most advantageous form of production and as the most suited form for producing wealth. Ricardo wants production for the sake of production, and he is correct in wanting this. If one wants to claim, as the sentimental opponents of Ricardo have done, that production is not the goal in itself, then one forgets that production for the sake of production means nothing else than the development of human powers of production, that is to say, the development of the richness of human nature for its own sake .... It is not understood that this development of the capacities of the species Man, although it is at first brought about at the cost of the majority of human individuals and certain human classes, finally breaks through this antagonism and coincides with the development of the single individual, and therefore that the higher development of individuality can only be bought by an historical process in which individuals are sacrificed." Here another reason becomes clear why we do not possess a philosophically based analysis of every-day life and every-day thought. This analysis must somehow take a stand, directly or indirectly, to the antagonistic duplicity of every-day life in capitalism which was sketched by Marx (I, 67). An adequate analysis of the every-day is possible, according to the Marxist Lukacs, when it is possible to have a perspective of a social system in which social and individual development proceed at the same rate. As long as society is organized to increase social production (and</page><page sequence="7">340 KENNETH MEGILL this includes the production in the sciences and arts as well as in other areas of human activity) at the costs of the individuals in society, then there will be an alienation of the individual from his products and the gap between the social products and man's individual life will become increasingly great. Until capitalism can be overcome, man's every-day life will always be split into two parts - man as a member of society and man as an individual who lives his own private life. There can be no every-day life in which alienation is overcome until this gap between human activity as a member of society and private life can be overcome. To discuss the nature of every-day life, for Lukacs, is not only to criticize the nature of the present-day society, but is also to gain a perspective on the life in which social production and the development of the human individual are complementary. The problem of how a meaningful every-day life is possible in a society in which social production has been tremendously increased must be at the center of a Marxist philosophy which is relevant to the social situation of the sixties. The problem today is not only to make the every-day life of man more meaningful, but to bring the every-day under man's control. In its historical development capitalism has been a system which has created tremendous social productivity but which has not yet been able to solve the problem of creating an every-day life of quality. Neither have the socialist societies which have suffered greatly, both theoretically and practically, from the long dominance of Stalinism been able to create a society in which man can control his every-day life. It is from philosophers such as Lukacs that we can begin to have an understanding of the correct relationship between man's great accomplishments, science and art, and man's every-day life. In the past Marxist philosophy has concentrated on the general development of society while ignoring the quality of life which is being produced. Marxists have traditionally been able to provide more or less convincing criticisms of social development, but have failed to develop how man can live in his every-day life. At one point in the Aesthetics, Lukacs states that the goal of his 'reconstruction' of the every-day ... is therefore a societal state without objectifications. This expression of course immediately requires a qualification; we should say: a societal state with a minimum of objectification. ... The real genesis of objectification must encompass the humani zation of man (Menschenwerden des Menschen umfassen) (I, 180).</page><page sequence="8">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 341 In Lukacs' more recent ontological works and even in some other parts of the Aesthetics Lukacs has ceased speaking of a state of society without objectification. Such a society is both impossible and undesirable. Throughout his discussion, however, Lukacs insists that the true purpose of objectification must be the humanization of man. For those who are familiar with recent Marxist discussion it is clear that in considering the nature of objectification Lukacs is concerned once again in a much more detailed and philosophically adequate way with the problem of alienation which he was one of the first to discuss. By raising the question of the nature of every-day life Lukacs is continuing in the non-dogmatic and non-Stalinist tradition of Marxism to which we could name the three great Marxists of the 1920's - Gramsci, Korsch and Lukacs, himself. Lukacs does not understand true human activity only to be possible by returning to a simple Utopian life. Objectification plays an important role in the humanizing of man. Like Marx, Lukacs recognizes that the develop ment of social productivity is essential for a humane society, but that this social development has until now only been possible by increasingly destroying the possibility for the human individual to develop. Objecti fication is a part of man's life; for example, work and language are forms of objectifications which are the two most important human activities in every-day life. But unless work and language can be used both to create a humane life and to produce social goods there remains a radical sepa ration between man as an individual and man as a member of society (which is one of the most important forms of alienation). To understand the nature of a society in which man becomes man, it is important to understand the structure of the objectifications of human activity. Although Lukacs emphasizes the nature of every-day life, he does not idealize the present every-day life or argue against objectification as an important part of human activity. Indeed, science and art are two im portant forms of objectification which he considers in the Aesthetics. The problem of the Aesthetics is to identify the forms of objectification and how they properly relate to every-day life. The every-day conduct of man is at once the beginning point and ending point of every human activity. That is, if one imagines the every-day as a great stream, science and art branch off from this stream as higher forms of perception and reproduction of reality, they differentiate themselves and build their own appropriate goals, reach their</page><page sequence="9">342 KENNETH MEGILL pure form in their own particular characteristics (which spring out of the needs of social life) and then, because of their effectiveness, flow back into the stream of every day life to affect the life of man (I, 13). Lukacs' discussion of the every-day is distinguished from others in this century in that he sees that the stream of every-day experience can only be considered by considering the reproductions which are an important part of human life. By discussing the nature of art in his Aesthetics Lukacs is considering only one of the forms of reproduction which have been developed by man. But a work of art is one of the most important forms of reproduction and art provides a way for man to understand important aspects of his every-day life. In the Aesthetics Lukacs sets out to specify the manner in which an art work reproduces reality and how art and science differ as forms of reproduction. The every-day remains the foun dation of the entire ontological system. One can only understand the structure of the every-day by considering the various forms of reproduc tion. What Lukacs says of the true work of art can apply to any of the important forms of human activity which reproduce reality. When we look at this complex of problems from the point of view of our conception of the aesthetics, then we can (well knowing that a static picture cannot possibly portray the real facts) look at the whole appearances of life as a hilly area out of which the works of art rise up as a mountain peak or as a chain of mountains. The fact that we can see countless transit points between hills and mountains does not change the fact that there is a qualitative gap which separates hills and mountains at all points (II, 530-531). The forms of reproduction of the every-day are 'mountain tops' which emerge out of our human experience. Lukacs takes the traditional Leninist theory of knowledge which holds that human activity mirrors reality seriously (although he emphasizes that such a mirroring is not a photo copy -1,269) and argues that all systematic human sciences and art works are reproductions of reality. Lukacs' realism is consistent both in his epistemology and in his aesthetics and is based on his understanding of the nature of the every-day and the forms of reproduction of reality which are a part of the every-day. II. SCIENCE AND AESTHETICS: TWO FORMS OF REPRODUCTION OF REALITY Although Lukacs does not give a detailed philosophy of science (a work which would require a study comparable to that of his Aesthetics), his</page><page sequence="10">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 343 discussion of the characteristics of the aesthetic is filled with comparisons of a work of art and a work of science. For Lukacs both scientific and artistic works are forms of reproduction of reality. As the motto for his book states, "Sie tun es, aber sie wissen es nicht" (They do it, but they do not know it) (Marx), the purpose of studying the forms of reproduction is to understand how it is that man reproduces his life and how this reproduction changes the life of man. The process of re-producing reality in art and science has been going on for centuries; the philosopher brings to consciousness the central characteristics of this process. The question of the kind of objectification which takes place in a scientific work becomes crucial both as a philosophical and as a social problem. Lukacs describes the difference between the form of objectifi cations in work and science as follows : Decisive is ... the level of abstraction, the distance from the immediate praxis of every-day life with which, of course, both science and work in their presuppositions as well as in their consequences remain bound. The relationship is, however, for science a more or less broader and more complicated relationship, while work, even when it is the application of the most complicated scientific knowledge, has primarily an im mediate character. The more immediate are the connections to immediate praxis,... the weaker, more changeable and less stable are the objectivations. Put more exactly: the more immediate are the connections, the greater are the possibilities that their ... fixation does not arise from the essence of the objective object, but rather has a sub jective ... basis. That means that the results of science are structurally models (Gebilde) which are much more independent of man than is work itself. The development is seen in the fact that in scientific praxis a model generally develops through emphasis on individual variations that are often expressly recognized (in capitalism) as market reasons. In capitalism work and the products of work approach the structure of science (I, 41-42). The fact that an increasing number of societies (and one might include some so-called socialist societies among them) have adopted the 'structure of science' instead of a structure of work as the basis for organizing human life has meant that human activity has become increasingly alienated. Lukacs' ontology assumes the important task of investigating the nature of an every-day life of quality and the proper relationship of objectifi cation to every-day life. In the Aesthetics Lukacs sometimes discusses science and art as if they were the only two forms of reproduction. In his latest work in which he discusses his ontology more explicitly, however, he has emphasized that other forms of objectification are an important part of human activity.</page><page sequence="11">344 KENNETH MEGILL Work, for example, is a form of objectification. Human institutions and laws are objectifications as well. In the Aesthetics Lukacs is concerned with human activity which reproduces reality through the great products of human activity such as art and science. These forms of reproduction do not simply reflect every-day life, but have a career and independence of their own. Lukacs' Aesthetics in its completed form would be a dis cussion of this separate career of art as a form of reproducing reality and the role art has played in man's development. The projected work on ethics is to be a systematic consideration of the ethical life of man and the norms which govern this life. Science is the attempt to discover general laws. Knowledge is discovered by the method of science and Lukacs suggests that art should not even claim to give knowledge (I, 513). Science, as we saw earlier, is at a higher level of abstraction from the every-day praxis than work (I, 41-42), but nevertheless shares many of its characteristics. Science, unlike art, is not anthropomorphic and the purpose of science is to understand at a high level of abstraction the world as an object apart from man. The de-anthropomorphising of science is an instrument by which man masters the world : it is a making-conscious, a raising up to a method, that form of conduct which, as we have shown, begins with work that differentiates man from animal and which helps make him into a man. Work and the highest conscious form which grows out of work, scientific conduct, is in this case not only merely an instrument for mastering the world, but in its very nature is a detour which enables a rich discovery of reality which enriches man himself and makes him more complete and more humane than he could be otherwise (I, 158). The detour which science makes is a necessary detour for the humani zation of man. Science always returns to the every-day and the knowledge gained through science, the knowledge of the world as an object of knowledge, is used to make the world accessible to man. To use the more traditional language of ontology, ... science focuses on Being as such and seeks to re-produce it in its purest possible form which is freed from all subjective additions, while the aesthetic focus is always on the world of man (II, 294-295). Science attempts to discover knowledge about the world as a totality. It tends toward monism and a final unity of all sciences (I, 671). The aesthetic mirroring of reality, on the other hand, is "essentially pluralistic" (I, 671), and is concerned with the world of man. Lukacs repeatedly emphasizes that he is not an expert in science, but it is important that</page><page sequence="12">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 345 as an aesthetician he develops an ontology which enables an adequate philosophy of science to be developed. A philosophy of science is one of the most important unfinished tasks for an ontology in Lukacs' spirit. Art, unlike science, "is and remains far more definitely than in every day life in reference to the subject (Subjektbezogen)" (I, 514). This does not at all mean that art, itself, is "subjective" in the sense that it is only the product of an individual person to be perceived individually. In art, "there arises an atmosphere of specialness" (II, 231). Indeed, art achieves a totality which is not relative. Science stands objectively in uninterrupted continuous interaction with its environment, through which its character of totality is constantly relativized. Subjectively such knowledge appears ... as mere approximation, postulation or correction. On the other hand the objectification of the aesthetic form of mirroring, the work of art, is an absolutely self-contained, completed totality (II, 232). The concept of totality has played a central role throughout Lukacs' writings, particularly in the classic Geschichte und Klassenbewu?tsein. For our purposes here it is enough to emphasize that Lukacs has recognized that the objective scientific knowledge of the world, precisely because it is general, will always remain relative. The objectification in the realm of art on the other hand is an objectification which claims absoluteness, completeness and specialness only because it does not claim to embody general laws. The completeness and specialness which is characteristic of art receives the major portion of Lukacs' attention in the Aesthetics. He not only shows how the specialness is present in the classical forms of art (such as literature and painting), but by discussing certain border areas, such as architecture, music and gardening, he works out the way in which art is an objectification of the 'special' in man's life. Art is not merely pleasant, but special in its claim for totality and absoluteness. For Lukacs, individuality (Einzelheit), specialness (Besonderheit), and generality (All gemeinheit) are not merely points of view toward reality, but are essential characteristics of objective reality, and without the knowledge of their relations and connections man could not even orient himself in the world, let alone master the world or put the world subordinate to the goals of man (II, 194). The special is seen as a mediator between the general and the individual. A work of art does not merely point out and present the special, but organizes it.</page><page sequence="13">346 KENNETH MEGILL What is specifically aesthetic is that the special is not simply postulated as a mediation between the general and the individual, but as an organized middle. The result is that the movement which brings about the mirroring is not merely, as is the case with knowledge, from the general to the individual and back again (or in the opposite direction), but that the special as the middle is the beginning point and end of the movement... (II, 206). The work of art, in its mediating role between the individual and the general, creates an harmonic synthesis between subjectivity and objectivity, between appearance and essence ... so that ... in a work of art individuality, as well as generality, must be transcended in specialness (II, 229). What makes art, art, is the concretizing of the general in the special and the raising of the individual to the special (II, 667). The world of art is the world of specialness and in art a unity of subject and object is achieved. We have said repeatedly: the world of art is the world of man. In this way the unity of subjectivity and objectivity is expressed ... (II, 226). Art is the specific form of human activity in which the special, rather than the individual or the general is expressed. Art raises the individual experiences of an author or a painter, not to a general law, but to something special which reproduces a totality. A work of art is a form of objectification important for the every-day, just as is a scientific theory, but it is a form of objectification which recreates the specialness rather than the general laws which govern our lives. In a scientific theory it is inessential who discovered the law or in what manner it was developed; in a work of art the individual personality and the life of the author or painter is an important part of the work (I, 790). As would be expected from the fact that the every-day is the beginning point and ending point of all human activity, the work of art returns to influence our every-day life. Instead of leading us away from the every day, the reproduction of an art work leads back to the every-day which is "truer, more objective, more exact, broader, deeper, more elastic, more comprehensive, etc." (II, 105). Without the detour of art, just as without the detour of science, man's life is not yet fully human. One of the most important influences of a work of art on every-day life is "the raising of personal culture, the deepening and preparation of receptivity for every thing which can bring about the enriching of the human species through</page><page sequence="14">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 347 the development of individuals" (II, 157). Lukacs has planned two further parts to his aesthetics, which are provisionally called, 'Kunstwerk und ?sthethisches Verhalten' (The Work of Art and Aesthetic Attitude) and 'Die Kunst als gesellschaftlich-geschichtliche Erscheinung' (Art as a Social Historical Appearance) (I, 14-15). Judging from the number of projects which he hopes to complete before finishing the aesthetics, it appears most unlikely that these two parts will ever be written. However, even in the two volumes which have been completed, the general outlines of the manner in which art influences the development of society is clear. For not only the entire artistic praxis is characterized by specialness, but also, its continuous streaming into life is an essential moment of human culture (II, 266). The reproduction of reality in science and art is not merely a reading-off from the data which are presented to man in his every-day life. There is a dialectical relationship between the every-day and the reproductions of reality so that the results of the investigations of art and science change the very nature of every-day life. Every-day life, art and science are historical. Lukacs does not glorify the every-day in opposition to the forms of reproduction, but instead understands that every-day life, as a human activity, is the result of the reproductions of the every-day working back on every-day life. The scientific and aesthetic mirroring of objective reality in the course of human development, work themselves out, make constantly finer differentiations of mirroring and find their final fulfillment in life itself. Their special characteristics are constituted by the direction in which they become ever more precise and fulfill the possibilities given as social functions. They therefore create in their relatively late developed purity on which rests the scientific or aesthetic generality the two poles of general mirroring of objective reality, whose fruitful middle is every-day life (I, 34). The reflections of reality such as science and art change the character and nature of every-day life which "is at once the beginning and end". The ontological works of Lukacs must not only describe the process of ab straction and reproduction which are characteristic of art, science, ethics and religion (I, 14), but must also show in what sense these reproductions have molded and shaped man's development. Ontology must not merely be a description of the various forms for mirroring reality, but must also be a history of the development of the forms of reproduction and how these forms change the nature of the every-day. Lukacs' ontology cannot be taken, as was the case with traditional</page><page sequence="15">348 KENNETH MEGILL ontology, as the working out of the fundamental structures of reality. His work must be understood as capturing the Seinsformen present at the present stage of historical development. But the 'only' does not mean a demeaning or relativizing of the philosophical task - instead philosophy (or ontology, to use Lukacs' word) becomes one of the most important tasks for developing society. The solution of theoretical questions, to which Lukacs has devoted much of his life, is not merely an interesting task, but has an immediate and important impact upon the life of man. Lukacs has not only been a philosopher, a great thinker who reflects upon the real nature of things, but has constantly been drawn into practi cal political discussion and action. Even more important, he has constantly served as an example of a Marxist philosopher who has remained true to the tradition of the working-class movement, while rejecting the Stalinistic and dogmatic forms which it developed. Lukacs' continued adherence to the Communist Party, even when it has not wanted to adhere to him, is based on his belief that philosophy is an activity which can take place only within the movement for democracy and socialism. No matter how abstract Lukacs' writings may appear to be, his entire life is an example for the kind of genuine Marxist philosophy which is neces sary if one is to understand the every-day life which is both the beginning and the end of all human activity. III. SOME CRITICAL COMMENTS It is hoped that this sketchy outline of the place of aesthetics and science in the ontology of Lukacs has given some indication of both the origi nality and the importance of this latest phase of Lukacs' life. It is doubtful if Lukacs will complete his entire ontology, and he admits that he is not capable of writing one significant part, a philosophy of science. The forthcoming work on the nature of social existence will focus on the questions of work, reproduction, ideology and alienation, as well as give a long and sometimes rather questionable interpretation of the major tendencies in current philosophy. The Ethics, which is to be the next major project in Lukacs' ontological works, will be concerned with the systematic consideration of the nature of human decision and human choices in every-day life. The every-day life of man is a life which is determined by the society and historical situation in which man lives.</page><page sequence="16">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 349 This does not mean that man is not free, but rather that man is determined. Man is free in the situation in which he lives to choose alternatives which are open to him and these choices will, in turn, determine the kind of future alternatives both for him and for others. In this situation, an ethics, through which men can come to an understanding of the criteria upon which choices can be made, becomes necessary. Ethics, like aes thetics, becomes a possibility in a Marxist sense when the nature of the every-day is properly understood. There are some intriguing comments on the nature of ethics in the Aesthetics which lead one to expect another important contribution to Marxist theory.8 Perhaps the development of an ethics, which Lukacs says is the "mediating middle between legality and morality" (II, 216), will go a long way toward correcting one of the major failures of Marxist theory which has concentrated on emphasizing a deterministic view of history. As Lukacs points out: The requirements of ethics always appear as demands of the day, as the moment of decision, as choice. In these moments the personality creates itself and achieves completeness or is reduced to disruption, to decay (II, 235). By developing the philosophical basis for understanding the nature of individual decisions, perhaps Lukacs can help Marxism to escape from the crude determinism which has made it such an unsatisfactory position in the past. The development of Lukacs' ontology is not only a philosophical event, but is also an important political event. By surviving the days of Stalinism, during which he engaged in what he calls a 'partisan war' against the Stalinistic system and devoted himself to the specialized task of developing a Marxist aesthetics, Lukacs is in a position to continue the great tradition of Marxist philosophy which began in the 1920's. His Aesthetics shows how much work must be done before an adequate philosophy for the twentieth century can be developed. His philosophical work must not be accepted as if it were a new textbook in Marxism, but as a prod for further real philosophical investigation into all areas of human activity. As he states in the opening pages of his first ontological work (and not in false modesty, but in the spirit which has motivated his whole life), "Hopefully impetus will be given by the presentation given here so that research will continue which will change much of what is said" (I, 37). Even in the moment in</page><page sequence="17">350 KENNETH MEGILL which his philosophical activity surpasses that of any of his associates in socialist countries and equals that of the great philosophers of our age, he insists upon seeing his work, not as the conclusion of a philosophical system, but as a prod for further research and thinking about the world in which we live. We are still too near to the creation of Lukacs' ontology to evaluate fully its truth and importance. We can already say that Lukacs' work is important now both as an example of Marxist theory and as a general philosophical work. It is important in the way in which true philosophical work has always been important - as a spur for further research and further development. Despite the fact that the first part of the Aesthetics encompasses more than 1700 pages, Lukacs has not given us a complete philosophy. The length of Lukacs' latest works does not only deter po tential readers, but also makes it difficult to achieve an adequate interpre tation. The notion of the every-day, which has played such an important role in our analysis here, is still neither clearly nor consistently developed. Lukacs points in the direction which one must go, but does not lead us there himself. Scattered throughout his work we find many interesting and provoking suggestions for an analysis of the every-day, but in the end it seems that one must understand art, science, religion and morality, both practically and theoretically, in order to give an adequate analysis of the every-day. Lukacs' monumental attempt shows us how a systematic philosophy is possible today and that such a systematic philosophy cannot be the product of one great thinker. A complete philosophy today is impossible, not only because of the state of knowledge, but also because of the necessity of combining theory and practice in order to produce an adequate systematic philosophy. The systematic aesthetics which Lukacs has already completed will undoubtedly be the most important part of his personal contribution to ontology, for it is the one field in which he can combine profound theoretical understanding with decades of practical work. The rest of his ontological works will necessarily fail to display the same combination of practical and theoretical competence. Lukacs as an ontologist has not written the ontology and one has the impression that neither he nor any other man could write an ontology of the kind which he sees to be re quired today. The failure to really achieve the goal of a general ontology is perhaps</page><page sequence="18">GEORG LUKACS AS AN ONTOLOGIST 351 best seen by the inadequate interpretations which he gives of some other philosophical positions (such as existentialism and positivism). It is true that his view of such philosophical positions is often much fairer than their view of Marxism, but it is clear that Lukacs has had neither the time nor the opportunity thoroughly to participate in important philo sophical developments of the last generation. The failure really to in corporate the progressive features of other philosophical positions leads to an oversimplification and, even more often, to an ignoring of positions which are important. The failure to see the place of his own work in the philosophical discussion today leads him to an attempt to give his opinions about all possible subjects. Lukacs the systematic philosopher is almost always superior to Lukacs the critic. The failure to understand other philosophical schools is particularly unfortunate in those areas in which Lukacs is not an expert, and where he still insists upon speaking. Particularly the discussion of the nature of science suffers from an insufficient break with the official dialectical materialism which has plagued Marxist philosophy. He still speaks of nature in terms of the formulations of Engels and other Marxist phi losophers of nature and, even more unfortunately, he has adopted much of the philosophy of nature of Nicholai Hartmann. In the end Lukacs has almost nothing of importance to say about philosophy of science except to point out the place which a philosophy of science can take in philosophical research. If this particular side of Lukacs' writings is em phasized it is possible to show that he is still a 'traditional' dialectical materialist. If this is really the case then it would be best to ignore him, just as most of the philosophy which has been done in socialist countries in the tradition of dialectical materialism is best treated by a lack of notice. The ambiguity present in Lukacs' writings enables two traditions to claim him - one which accepts his arguments in favor of realism in art and his dialectical materialism as the starting point, and the other which sees his ontology as a method for developing an open and critical Marxist philosophy. Lukacs provides a link with the democratic Marxist tradition and throughout his life he has worked for a Marxist philosophy of a high quality. In all periods of his life he has been influential on his associates and has sought out and encouraged others to do good theoretical work in the Marxist tradition. The development of philosophical life in Hungary</page><page sequence="19">352 KENNETH MEGILL since the end of the war is to a large extent the product of Lukacs' presence, either as a result of his direct influence or in reaction to his writings.9 He has shown by word and deed that Marxism does not need to be identified with Stalinism and that it is possible to be a good Marxist and to be a good philosopher. The most recent writings by Lukacs will play an important part in the development of philosophy in any country which claims to be following the Marxist position. Since his re-admission to the party, his works are appearing in Hungarian philosophical journals and we can expect a development of considerable interest in his proposed ontology in the Marxist tradition. The study of Lukacs must not only be a study of what he has done, but of what will become of his ontology as the basis for a Marxist phi losophy. Lukacs as an ontologist is an important philosopher who has indicated a program for philosophical work in the twentieth century. If he can escape the fate of other important philosophers who saw their doctrines adopted by a school which sought to maintain their purity and in the process became less and less interesting, the latest Lukacs will perhaps one day be regarded as one of the leading systematic philosophers of our century. If the followers of Lukacs continue in the tradition which he has set, both by personal example and in his philosophical work, then his works will not be treated as the philosophy, but as a spur to further research. If this is done, we can have hope that Marxist philosophy will once again become an important part of philosophical life in the world today.10 REFERENCES * An article similar to but not identical with this one appeared in the June, 1969, Serbo-Croation edition o?
