<plain_text><page sequence="1">artificial life art Tom Ray's Hammer Emergence and Excess in A-Life Art Mitchell Whitelaw Abstract Art using artificial life techniques is often founded on a desire for emergence, a desire to have novel, unexpected, or unpredictable results spring from a controlled, designed system. The author explores emergence, briefly tracing the history of debate around the term before using the work of Peter Cariani to discuss the problems involved in describing the results of computational processes as emergent. The relevance of these points to a-life art is illustrated through an imaginary software project in the form of an a-life "breeder." Finally, the urge for emergence is considered in its most general sense as a desire that leads outside art and human design, one that might paradoxically be fulfilled by cultural and social systems themselves, rather than by the artifacts they produce. D uring an interview, Rod Berry recounted a story about Tom Ray, noted a-life researcher. Apparently when he was cod- ing the first version of Tierra, an open-ended computational a- life experiment, Ray smashed the serial ports off his computer with a hammer to make sure none of his self-replicating code entities escaped. This image stayed with me in the following months. Like throwing a brick through a television, the gesture has the visceral appeal of a "hardware" solution to a "software" problem- a transgressive, category-error brutality. More signifi- cantly, the excess of the gesture indicates the excess it tries to contain. Ray's digital replicators were, for him, creatures of such potential virulence that they needed to be constrained in hard- ware. Ray's hammer blow protects against, and simultaneously projects, a basic transgression: a-life goes "out of control"; it escapes its isolated virtual pond and makes its way in the world. This is a basic moment in a-life and a-life art, the moment when the system exceeds itself, breaches its initial boundaries, surprises us; the moment of emergence. As it turns out the story is untrue- probably derived from Stephen Levy's account of Ray's plan to enclose the Tierra com- puter in a "containment facility," a steel cage preventing access to disk drives and ports [1]. While the image is less dramatic, the intent is the same. The cage defines a highly charged boundary between the computational inside and the worldly outside; the prison walls make us think of escape. This paper presents this will to escape, the desire for emergence, as a fundamental dynamic in contemporary a-life art. Here it's isolated, extrapolat- ed outwards and followed; it provides a useful theoretical per- spective on current a-life work, and at its limits it provokes more abstract questions about the edges of art and intentionality. Emergence in A-Life A structural commonality leads us towards this dynamic: a- life systems, whether "art" or "science," can be split crudely into two levels. The first is the concrete hardware and software of the work, its designed framework or substrate. The second con- sists of the phenomena generated or supported by this substrate, its results. This structure is unremarkable in itself- we can make a similar split in an everyday computer system between the hardware and software "machine" and its phenomenal products, the monitor display or amplified sound. One level supports and produces the other. The important distinction lies in the relation between these two levels: in everyday utilitarian computing, the relation is straightforward, causal; I type, and letters appear (with any luck). In a-life works, the relation is different. Consider the case of a "breeder" work, such as Karl Sims' Genetic Images (1993). This seminal image-breeder algorithmically generates a set of images from which one or more are selected Mitchell Whitelaw, 69 Pine St., Chippendale NSW 2008, Australia.

The system then "mutates" the equation gen- erating the selected image, producing a new set of variants for selection [2]. The software substrate here consists of the programmed processes of mutation and replication, the genetic algorithm and its rules of expression, the way the "geno- type" is rendered as a "phenotype." But interest centers on the phenotype, the image, as an emergent result that has some- how exceeded, or pulled away from, its mechanistic substrate. Whether the result of thousands of generations of careful aesthetic selection or miraculous "mutants," the results of these processes, at their best, seem to defy the boring determinism of our average computational experience. Robotic a-life shares this structure: after an initial enchantment, we take the simple causality of an automatic door for granted; the relationship between system and phenomenon, sensor and motion becomes transparent. Robotic a- life aims for a situation where the phe- nomena of interaction exceed this kind of transparency; the robot appears to have a kind of autonomy, it seems to "behave." It's this relation between phenomenal result and concrete substrate that defines the dynamic of emergence within an indi- vidual system. Collectively, this dynamic is reflected in the evolutionary desire pro- pelling both a-life science and a-life art towards increasingly emergent results, out- comes that increasingly exceed their sub- strates. Larry Yeager, discussing his 1993 Polyworld simulated ecosystem, lists emer- gent features of his simulated creatures, including response to visual stimuli (the creatures have simulated vision and neural net "brains"), food-seeking, and flocking. In projecting the system's future, Yeager anticipates that the move to a more pow- erful computational platform would allow "larger populations ... [and] more complex neural models, thus fostering greater spe- ciation and more complex behaviors" [3]. Kenneth Rinaldo, asked in an interview about his interactive robotic piece The Flock, similarly anticipates its future evolu- tion, including a switch from a Brooksian subsumption-architecture approach to behavior to a genetic algorithm method that would "allow a new Flock to evolve its own behavior" [4]. Rod Berry's Feeping Creatures is an immersive musical breeder whose inhabitants' melodic calls are also their genetic material; Berry described his goal as a "perpetual novelty machine" that maintains a diverse and evolving ecosystem, avoiding the homogenizing "hillbilly effect" of inbreeding [5]. In each case here, the artist anticipates changes to the substrate, the hardware or software system, that will produce an extra degree of emergence in the result. Each of these system builders is aiming for more com- plexity, more diversity, more evolution, a greater emergent excess. Emergences Emergence itself deserves some atten- tion here before it becomes meaningless through overuse or overloaded with hyperbole. Quickly retracing the history of debate around the concept will return us to a-life art with some useful questions. That history extends back to John Stuart Mill, who in A System of Logic (1843) talks about "heteropathic causation" [6]- the case where a joint effect of several causes cannot be reduced, or traced back, to its component causes. Mill uses the example of the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen: their interaction produces a substance that has properties neither of the elements possess themselves- "wateryness" is an emergent property. In the early zoth century, proponents of "emergent evolution" C. Lloyd Morgan and Samuel Alexander develop a notion of emergence that expands this physical account into an attempt to provide alter- natives to both mechanistic and vitalistic conceptions of life. They set out a materi- alist cosmology of levels, each one emer- gent from the last, where matter gives rise to life, life supports "Mind," and "Mind" produces "Deity" [7]. In reaction to this kind of expansiveness, later treatments are more reserved. Ernst Nagel argues that emergence is simply a property of a com- plex whole such that our models, or theo- ries, about the properties of its components are inadequate to describe the properties of the complex whole. He argues: "the doctrine of emergence ... must be understood as stating certain logi- cal facts about formal relations between statements rather than any experimental or even 'metaphysical' facts about some allegedly inherent traits of properties of objects" [8]. In other words, given a mod- el of hydrogen and oxygen that doesn't attempt to account for their interaction, the new properties of water are less magi- cally emergent than simply unaccounted for. Nagel's critique of the "inherence" of emergent properties implies a "weak" def- inition of emergence, which is simply the unmodeled, or unaccounted-for properties of a complex whole. More recently, Peter Cariani has pur- sued the implications of this epistemologi- cal approach for artificial life research. He presents a notion of emergence-relative- to-a-model comparable to Nagel's; it regards emergence as "the deviation of a physical system from an observer's model of it" [9]. Particularly interesting here is the result that under this definition, com- putational artificial life simulations must be nonemergent. Cariani argues: All computer simulations can be described in terms of finite-state automata, as networks of computation- al state transitions, as formal manipu- lation systems. As observer- programmers we can always find a frame which will make our simulation appear nonemergent. [10] In other words, given the deterministic nature of computation (even with chaotic mathematics and pseudo-random num- bers), a given initial state will always progress through the same succession of states and produce the same results. The key to Cariani's notion of emergence is the idea of the observational frame, the point of view that constitutes the observ- er's model of the system. Cariani's point is that however difficult it might be to access practically, given a model of the computer as a closed, deterministic sym- bol processor and complete knowledge of its (finite, symbolic) states, its activity will never deviate from that predicted by that model. Cariani refers to the emergent properties exhibited by such simulations as instances of "computational emer- gence," where emergence is simply the production of diverse, complex macro- 378 Mitchell Whitelaw, Tom Ray's Hammer</page><page sequence="3">scale phenomena from a few simple, micro-scale rules. Like Mill's account of emergence in matter, computational emer- gence arises through the interaction of elements, regardless of their relationship to the observer's model; we could call this ontological emergence. Cariani sets out a typology of devices that clarifies the structure of systems that meet, and fail to meet, his epistemological definition of emergence. The key features of an adaptive (emergence-capable) device are openness to the environment, some means of measuring and/or affecting the world outside, and reflexive flexibility (the capacity to adaptively alter itself). The types of alteration define two of Cariani's device types: "syntactically adaptive" devices can alter the rules that define their internal computations, while "seman- tically adaptive" devices can alter the mapping between environmental input and the internal symbolic representation. The latter corresponds to, for example, the formation of a new sensory organ, where a new kind of information from the environment becomes available to the device's computational processes. A device that is both syntactically and semantically emergent Cariani calls a gen- eral evolutionary device- one capable of altering the "meaning" of its environmen- tal measurements as well as the symbolic operations it performs on them. Even though such systems are highly adaptive, the fitness criteria that guide their adapta- tions are static and externally imposed. Cariani anticipates devices with even greater levels of autonomy, capable of "constructing their own performance- measuring apparatuses and hence attaining motivational autonomy." He muses, dead- pan: "Such devices would not be useful for accomplishing our purposes as their evaluatory criteria might well diverge from our own over time" [11]. Cariani's typology can be usefully linked with the binary of substrate and phenomena constructed earlier. Computa- tional emergence-which corresponds to a nonadaptive, "fixed computational" device in this typology-is a single-stage model: there is a static relation between a computational substrate and its emergent complex phenomena. The initial state and simple rule-set are a deterministic "seed" that grows a complex plant, but the same plant will grow from the same seed time and time again. There is a single moment of excess, a single jump from the micro- computational to the macro-phenomenal level, and no more. The device types that Cariani describes as capable of emergent behavior under his model-relative defini- tion are capable of ongoing emergence. Here the two levels, substrate and emer- gent result, form a feedback loop: the result loops back to effect changes in the infrastructure, which in turn alters the emergent result. The device types are determined by which parts of the infras- tructure are included in this loop. Imaginary Metamutants It is interesting to look at recent a-life projects (both "art" and "science") through Cariani's typology. Many of the systems we think of as evolutionary or adaptive begin to seem nonemergent. Breeder works, such as those mentioned earlier, seem to be what Cariani calls "fixed robotic" devices: they take an envi- ronmental input (choice of genotype to breed), subject it to computational pro- cesses, feed this back to the environment (or user) in the form of images of the mutant offspring, and the cycle continues. The system is open to its environment through the tiny portal of interface deci- sion-making, but neither the rules of its computation nor the semantics of its mapping of environmental input are sub- ject to mutation. Even more embodied, robotic a-life systems fall into this catego- ry whenever they use fixed computational rules and fixed sensor-effectors. So why bother with Cariani's formal, epistemological definition of emergence if it won't allow us to describe these appar- ently evolutionary or emergent computa- tional and robotic systems in such terms? Because it clarifies, even formalizes, the fulfillment of the emergence drive that was argued for earlier. Cariani's motiva- tionally autonomous, general evolutionary device fulfills this desire for increased autonomy, increased emergent excess; it is the absolute endpoint of this drive. As well, Cariani's definition allows us to locate the frustration evoked by many (particularly simulation-based) a-life works. Once the initial stage of computa- tional emergence becomes familiar, we are impatient for the next stage, another excess, another surprise. How can we explain this apparent dis- junction between a-life practice and the desire for emergence? What currently pre- vents this urge for excess and autonomy from being fulfilled? And what might a- life art be if it were? These questions can be considered in parallel as we perform some imaginary modifications on a-life art systems. Con- sider a breeder that produces a virtual three-dimensional phenotype through sim- ulated genetic processes. Such works have a simple, functional imperative of explo- ration of an aesthetic space, the generation of novel, appealing phenotypes. As such, applying the criterion of absolute emer- gence (as continual excess, continual varia- tion) seems logical; we want to explore the widest possible fields of form, be able to evolve any shape at all. Existing systems fall short of this goal; they are constrained by their fixed object-elements and combi- natorial grammar. These might have built- in zoomorphic biases or a more abstract vocabulary (such as William Latham's ten- tacle-shell-spirals [12]), but in each case this grammar limits the outcomes in a way that produces a kind of familial style. Latham's work is an excellent example because of the clear link between the for- mal vocabulary of elements and transfor- mations he has developed and the consistency of familial resemblance. In an art-world context, this emergent style is readily accepted as the style of the individ- ual artist but from the perspective of the exploratory, generative aims of these breeders it's a boundary, a limit. Imagining a breeder that is emergent by Cariani's definition seems simple enough, initially: instead of simply evolv- ing phenotypes using a predetermined genotype grammar, allow variation and evolution in the grammar and the rules of expression that link it to the phenotype. Mutant syntax, mutant rules, and metamu- tant phenotypes. The spiral-sphere tenta- cle-shell becomes a string of cubes, a lofted procedural "skin" covering the cubes, intersects with a 3D file sucked Mitchell Whitelaw, Tom Ray's Hammer 379</page><page sequence="4">from the Web, then re-uses the recursive structure that generated the initial spiral but applies it to transformations on ver- tices of the imported file, a trait which becomes linked to surface characteristics of the lofted skin. A mutant syntax evolves that can generate its own singular permutational consistency (or style). But programmers reading this will be crying foul, and rightly so. These syntacti- cal changes would have to have been pre- pared, in advance, anticipated by the system's designer. Build in the capacity to be open to 3D content from the Web and it's no surprise when the system ful- fills it. The same applies to all the other mutations- the system must have been designed to accommodate them: this is not emergence, just a larger permutational repertoire. For these traits to be emer- gent, they must have emerged sponta- neously from a general computational substructure, and it's difficult to imagine a computer program, however self-organiz- ing, happening upon the necessary code to deal with a network protocol, let alone the correct data structure for a 3D file. And if we withdraw all our handy bits of a priori knowledge (about how to write to video memory, make a window, access the disk) and instead hope for a com- pletely spontaneous result, it would be ludicrously optimistic to expect the result to even be a virtual-object breeder, no matter how many cycles of guided evolu- tion we subject it to. Other lines of becoming branch off everywhere; the breeder looks more like a virus or a net- work worm, or a disk utility, or most like- ly a spastic system-crashing monster, unexecutable code that takes its infras- tructure down with it. Mutant variability meets the formal brittleness of computational processes: to come into being, the mutant code must fulfill the (static) requirements of the interpreting and executing formal system. An analogous problem faces robotic a- life: how can we imagine a robotic device that evolves sensors and effectors? The rigidity or viscosity of the structure of our robots is such that any variation is more likely to be nonfunctional than functional: imagine a robot randomly evolving a sen- sory organ that transmits the well-formed video signal that its vision-system is expecting [13]. It seems likely that any such radically emergent device would be operating out- side the technological and formal gram- mars that define human-designed robotics and computation. We could expect an evolved infrastructure to be able to sup- port variation with relative robustness, like biological life; its structures, like biological life, might not conform at all to the anthropomorphic metaphors which shape our technologies. Recent work on evolv- able hardware indicates that the results function in a way completely unlike human-designed systems: the evolved devices use their circuit boards as physical artifacts with particular electrostatic prop- erties, rather than as transparent instantia- tions of formal computational processes. These evolved circuits appear to rely on physical interactions with adjacent compo- nents, and only work reliably in the tem- perature range they were evolved in. The circuit designs seem to use complex feed- back loops, though their creator admits "I don't have the faintest idea how it works" [14]. Looking for more efficient circuit designs, engineers using these processes get something else, a machinic alterity, a device that works beautifully but in a com- pletely unexpected way. Becoming Other Artificial life begins to peel away from design, intent, and human conceptual models and becomes alien, as alien as our own bodies and those of our fellow crea- tures. We attempt to codify these wetware systems, grasp them as knowledge, formal relations, biological causalities, but they slip away, resist prediction. If it succeeds, a-life will involve the same relation, but in reverse: the known, formal, designed, modeled structures of our single-stage, computationally emergent systems will give way to autonomous, mysterious, open systems. A-life as a scientific epistemologi- cal project relies, as Katherine Hayles says, on a kind of reverse reductionism: the cre- ation of the mysterious, excessive, ungras- pable from its knowable components [15]. Instead of dissecting the frog, it tries to build one- but the goal, absolute knowl- edge of the living thing, is the same. Artists, by comparison, embrace a-life with more synthetic, creative aims. As suggested earlier, the emphasis here is on the emergent result, the excess, rather than the known relation between the for- mal infrastructure and the emergent phe- nomenon. Inasmuch as it is driven by a desire for absolute emergence, endless excess, a-life art is a metacreative endeav- or: it wants to create creation, variation, otherness. In Deleuzean terms, it wants (in a very literal way) to begin a line of becoming, a line of flight. If a-life science is about knowing and understanding, a- life art is very basically about making and being, that is being and becoming other, becoming unknown. This becoming puts a-life art in tension with itself; currently, paradoxically, making increasingly sophis- ticated a-life systems demands increasing technical knowledge, an increase in willed design, control, intentionality; all towards an end which aims to exceed that design and knowledge. This approach leads to an a-life art which follows the explorations of scientific a-life, implementing its tech- niques in a different aesthetic guise. If it is to get what it wants, a becoming-other, an endless excess, it has to surrender at some point in this process. The question is whether this point of surrender, the point of emergence, will arrive when the technological infrastructure and formal innovation reaches a certain crucial point, or whether it might appear in another domain, on another axis altogether. Move the observational frame out- wards: aren't we already surrounded by emergent complexity? It's possible to see art in general as a system producing emergent phenomena. A work is only its concrete material self-paint, canvas, steel, electricity, plastic-but it is open to its environment in rich and multiplex ways: it affects individuals in ways that we can anticipate (cultural theory) and ways we cannot (the myriad particularities of an encounter or interpretation); it transmits itself to societies and individuals, them- selves involved in complex feedback rela- tions, and might reproduce or persist in various ways (quotation, critique, imita- tion, style). Considered diachronically, art gives rise to emergent phenomena (cul- ture, discourse) that inform the produc- 380 Mitchell Whitelaw, Tom Ray's Hammer</page><page sequence="5">tion of subsequent works- the feedback loop of ongoing emergence. A-life art begins to seem like a strange reflexive involution of this commonplace- it seeks to formalize emergence, wrap it up into a finite system (where ironically it is bound to fail), and then present it in a context where its results are truly part of something open, emergent, and unpre- dictable. Cariani, intriguingly, allows for this possibility when talking about com- putational emergence. Emergence here is in the mind of the observer: "The interest- ing emergent events that involve artificial life sim- ulations reside not in the simulations themselves, but in the ways that thej change the way we think and interact with the world" [16]. The frame shifts; these simulations are not emergent in themselves but like all other artifacts of human culture, and all other formed matter, are part of the complex system of all complex systems. The edges of all these categories start to blur. Art (and culture) are reflexive emergent phenomena, and a-life art is embedded in its own loops of cultural and technological feedback and discourse. Evaluating it against its own implicit drive towards emergent excess is less a critique than a tactic for tracing the wider implica- tions of that drive. Emergence exceeds the capacity of its host-system to contain it; it moves across domains. A-life (art?) that "succeeds" might be memetic, or cul- tural, as much as robotic or computation- al; it might be imperceptible, subsisting within and across existing structures but changing, adapting itself and them. If the coevolutionary processes observed in bio- logical life are any indication, emergent a- life would sustain itself in a niche formed by the transverse ecologies of media, cul- ture, technology, and biology. There is no reason why it should stay in the gallery, or in the computer- Tom Ray's urge to contain his replicating code followed that intuition. If a-life art were to fulfill its desire for excess, it would cease to be art, as currently defined, it would be more like a-human engineering: purpose and design are overtaken by raw, persistent functionality. "The functional question in ... desiring-production is not what is it for but simply whether it works: Does it make something happen?" [17] Current a-life art is contained by the rigidity of its technological substrates, its emergence channeled along designed paths. It only hints at the kind of abstract, transverse, machinic emergence considered above. But as much as it is involved in a desire for emergent excess, it projects that threshold beyond which the system con- tinually exceeds itself. This point, as a trope or a cultural value, is fraught with difficulty. It seems to participate in the worst kind of techno-utopianism or mysti- cal apocalyptic storytelling- it's reminis- cent of Vernor Vinge's "Singularity" [18], or Frank Tipler's "Omega Point" [19]. These tropes sit easily with the dominant drives of the West-increased prosperity and technological progress-and tend to treat the technological means to their cyber-transcendent ends as unproblemati- cally transparent and accessible. A-life art- works, however much they subscribe to such notions, pull back from this abstract hyperbole simply by being concrete imple- mentations. They involve a machinic prag- matics, a functionality; they deal with the real conditions of technological produc- tion, easily neglected in rhetoric. They are situated in a crucial gap between the desire for excess and its implementation. At a time when posthuman rhetoric is running high, a-life art can be seen as an empirical study in constructing a machinic, a-human "outside" from within the cultur- al and technological present. Rather than leap easily into a fantastic techno-future, a-life art provides an instructive example of the real difficulties involved in pursuing an absolute becoming-other. References and Notes 1.
