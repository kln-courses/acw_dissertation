Why are we so fascinated by them? What do they tell us about our past and about ourselves? We can come up with an initial answer to these questions simply by leafing through the pages of this magazine. Every image reproduced here is a nostalgic reflection of our history, an enjoyable way to revisit landscapes, historic moments and figures from the distant past. They may not be entirely accurate depictions, though they did respond to the historicist spirit of the time. All things considered, their beauty will never cease to amaze us. In issue 31 of Artes de México, devoted to the nineteenth century European traveler, one of the topics we examined was the role that many itinerant artists played in the creation of a national art tradition. They held up a polished mirror to our face, and we learned to see ourselves in it. As we recognized our own features in that mirror or saw that they were distort ed, these works became the basis for the construction of our self-image. Carl Nebel was a German architect who, like many other Europeans, was drawn to Mexico by his insatiable curiosity. But his interest extended far beyond simple exoticism: he wanted to explore this country and capture his impressions of it on pa per. In this issue, we took four different approaches to his life. The first was biographical. The coordinator of this issue, Arturo Aguilar, describes certain aspects of his life and his personality, while Leonardo López Luján analyzes this artists attraction to the enigmatic and sometimes terrifying images of pre-Hispanic art. He discusses some of Nebels finest work as well as some of the errors in his perception of pre-Hispanic pieces. He also ac knowledges some of his accomplishments, as the discoverer of Tuzapan, for example, and through his published work, as the bearer of news from this nascent nation. Pablo Diener guides us plate-by-plate through Nebels celebrated book Voyagepittor esque et archéologique dans la partie la plus intéressante du Mex ique, pointing out his technical precision when depicting the archaeological essence of our cities and the things that struck the European as unusual or that inspired strong emotions in him. Each of these plates masterfully communicates his sense of awe and wonder. Finally, Ron Tyler discusses Nebels images of the war between Mexico and the United States. They reflect the artists desire to re-create the battles as faithfully as possible, but what these images truly reveal is how important Nebels work was to upholding the Americans' self-image as a well uniformed, orderly, almost aseptic army. More than a great war, what the Americans got here was a beautiful book about their own greatness, thanks to Nebel and the huge number of people that participated in its making and helped overcome the obstacles to its publication. It isn't only in the twenty-first century that publishing high-quality books is a complicated process. Apparently, the problems faced when undertaking an ambitious editorial project in Nebels time were similar to the ones faced by any publisher today. Nebels work is the product of great curios ity and passion. It is the culmination of his desire to retain in his eyes and memory the intensity of the moment of encounter with the Other, with an otherness where through a fortunate historic and ar tistic paradox—Mexicans then and now have been able to recog nize our nation. These images, which began as a kind of appropriation of the Other, now belong to the Other. They form part of Mex ico's imaginary, like photos in an old family album. And each time we look at them, they produce the same fascination and the same lesson. Translated by Michelle Suderman. This page and previous: Hacienda-owner and foreman.

The country covered by the album—Mexico—was one of the most important in the barons eyes, since in addition to its natural wonders it boasted the further enticement of archaeological ru ins. Subsequently, Humboldt included sec tions of this letter in the preface he wrote for Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans la partie la plus intéressante du Mexique (A Pic turesque and Archaeological Voyage through the Most Interesting Part of Mexico), written and illustrated by the German architect Carl Nebel and published in Paris a year later. In the letter, Humboldt made the fol lowing observation: "Today, I direct readers' attention to Mexico's ancient monuments, in support of an enterprising acquaintance [Carl Nebel] who is devoted to the architec ture and arts of the people of Anáhuac—the Mexican Altiplano—and has been complete ly overlooked. [The author is] an excellent artist in terms of archaeological subjects, with an eye for the picturesque." Coming from Humboldt—an authority on the sub ject, having rediscovered the Americas, as it were—this was very high praise indeed. Dur ing his travels, the Prussian scientist regret ted not having his own draftsman, whose ef forts might have enhanced the authenticity of his descriptions, as had been the case of James Cook. Thus he encouraged any new effort such as Nebel's to raise awareness of the Americas and all its varied facets. The new generation of itinerant artists to which Carl Nebel belonged was no longer influenced solely by the Enlightenment as were their predecessors. Instead, their work swung from naturalistic expressionism to subjective individualism. Amidst this artis tic-literary current, there arose an even more urgent fascination with the exotic world. These artists wanted to preserve every far away locale for posterity, depicting it with all its unique features. They were equally concerned with portraying the ruins of an cient cultures, such as those of the Egyptians and the Maya, and also the traditional garb of cultures from outside the European fron tier—a virtual catalogue of human diversity that contrasted with the uniform style of dress that had overtaken the modern world. Nebel's artistic virtues are best appreciated against this backdrop. The architect, who thor oughly embraced the ideals of Romanticism, consciously chose to have his work published not just in Europe but in Mexico as well. In so doing, he faced a major challenge: although his acceptance was all but guaranteed on the old continent, here in Mexico anything that contained the slightest trace of criticism could prompt angry and dismissive reactions. Nev ertheless, the second edition of Carl Nebel's album—entitled Un viaje pintoresco y arque ológico por México (A Picturesque and Ar chaeological Voyage through Mexico) and published in Spain in 1840—was greeted with surprising approval by the Mexican public. A number of its plates were reproduced in Mexi can publications, on china figures, as photo graphs or even on ceramic dishes—a nod to similar scenes on English crockery. Few for eigners had experienced such a response to their work Not even the famous letters of Ma dame Calderón de la Barca, published under the title Life in Mexico, had gained such accep tance among Mexicans of the era. What was Nebel's secret? To answer this and other ques tions, we must analyze what made his work so distinctive, and find out something about his life. Since Nebel has only recently captured the attention of researchers, certain aspects of his biography and art have yet to be revealed. Arrival in Mexico Carl Nebel was born March 18, 1805 in the city of Altona, a suburb of Hamburg in what is now Germany. Little was known of his life and work. We now know from the artist's own documents that as a young man, Nebel first studied at the Berlin Academy of Architecture—founded in 1799 and one of the most prestigious in its field in the Ger man kingdom. Although he was trained as an architect, it's highly probable that he also took engineering courses, since the two disci plines were closely linked back then. Around 1823, when he was eighteen years old and still studying architecture, the Prussian govern ment deemed him qualified to oversee pub lic works projects. It was a common move among students of the era. They could pur sue their studies with the backing of the gov ernment agency in charge of building bridges, public buildings, highways and so on. Nebel loaned his services to them for four years, for which he received a modest wage. In his own words, Carl Nebel explains what motivated him to seek new horizons: "In 1827, my desire to see the world and hone my professional skills led me to leave government service. I traveled through the Netherlands on my way to Paris, where I was soon employed by the Vistier brothers, the architects who had worked on the Pas sage Delorme and later on one of Bercy's large wine depots." The Parisian ambience and the work opportunities he found in that city gave him new perspectives. After his stay in Paris, he got a job overseeing the construction of a building in Normandy, af fording him the chance to travel to Italy. Nebel spent two years in Rome studying the classical monuments of antiquity. Get ting acquainted with the remains of Greco Roman architecture and the works of the Renaissance masters was at that time con sidered an essential component of any art student's education. More than a productive endeavor, the trip to Rome was considered indispensable to any true artist. Indeed, from the eighteenth century onward, Euro pean art students were expected to take The Grand Tour, with Rome as the finale. As a magnet for artists from all over, Rome be came an arena for the exchange of ideas on new artistic tendencies, as well as a center of learning. Little wonder that another Ger man artist, Johann Moritz Rugendas, also made the trip to that city. In 1828, Nebel was offered the oppor tunity to go to Mexico. "Family matters obliged me to return to Hamburg, my hometown. I didn't care for the mansion in that thoroughly mercantile capital, and was on my way back to Paris when my father, who had connections in the New World, proposed that I take a trip to the Ameri cas. I took him up on his offer, choosing Mexico, since I had developed an interest in that country's history." It's safe to assume that Nebel's father was a man of some financial means, because otherwise he could not have backed his son's journey or archaeological interests. Quite possibly Bernardo Nebel had connections with firms in Prussia or other German terri tories that had established mining or manu facturing operations in post-Independence 67 Arturo Aguilar Ochoa</page><page sequence="4">Mexico. Indeed, the German community was among the most populous—if not the most important—groups in Mexico during that era. This is a very likely scenario, since the artist from Hamburg had requested several loans from these companies, and in almost every case his father had been the underwriter. Without a doubt, the artists knowledge of Mexico must have been another key fac tor in his decision to make the journey. Not only had he read Humboldt, but he would surely have been familiar with the writ ings of Henry George Ward, George Fran cis Lyon and William Bullock, to name but a few of the travelers who had tackled the subject of archaeology and whose views had echoed widely across Europe. The decision to go to Mexico was thus made toward the end of 1828, as Nebels writings around that time attest: "My entry into the Republic was met by a series of calamities. A serious ill ness debilitated my health and the looting of '28 deprived me of everything I'd brought with me." The German artist was probably laid low by vomiting and yellow fever in the insalubrious port of Veracruz. Yellow fever was a common affliction in the zone, and foreign visitors were among the chief tar gets of its devastating effects. The looting Carl Nebel referred to was the Parián mar ket incident, also called the Riot of La Acor dada, since it broke out at the prison of that name. The November 30,1928 uprising was an angry response to the electoral victory of Manuel Gómez Pedraza over Vicente Guer rero. To shouts of "Long live Lobato and Guerrero and everything I can 'borrow!'" the ragged mob of enraged criminals looted and destroyed warehouses, stores and even homes along the central streets of the capi tal. Apparently the architect had unwittingly stumbled into that part of town, and lost "everything" in the revolt. Archaeological Work: 1829-1834 The first thing Nebel wanted to do in Mexico was to practice his trade as an architect, and a number of individuals had requested his services. It is also likely that soon after ar riving in Mexico City he visited the Nation al Museum to copy codices, pre-Hispanic objects and sculptures such as the sacrifi cial stone (the Stone of Tizoc), the Teoy amiqui or Coatlicue which terrified anyone who gazed at it, and the Sun Stone or Aztec Calendar, at that time leaning against one of the cathedral walls. According to Justino fS Fernández, Nebel's copying skills did not do justice to the image of Coatlicue, but even so, it was undoubtedly one of the fin est graphic representations that had been produced up to that point. As it happened, the Sun Stone as well as the Coatlicue and the Stone of Tizoc had already been enjoy ing some popularity in Europe, thanks to William Bullocks book, Six Months' Resi dence and Travels in Mexico, published in London in 1824 and translated into French and German shortly thereafter. That same year, Bullock presented an exhibition at the Egyptian Hall in Picadilly, London, where he unveiled monumental replicas of the three aforementioned objects, along with some other pre-Hispanic antiquities. Since his arrival in Mexico, Nebel had been putting together his own collection of pre-Hispanic objects, which included Mexi can musical instruments such as flutes and drums called teponaztlis, as well as figurines from Teotihuacan. Purchasing these pre-His panic pieces was easy to do: there was a surfeit of shady dealers who would show them to any one who betrayed the slightest interest. Other Europeans, like the German Carl Uhde and the Swiss Lukas Vischer, also had collections which they exhibited in their homes. Some of the pieces in Nebels collection are currently on display at the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris. Although their artistic value is limited, these pieces were the basis for much of the artists work and reflect his personal taste. During his early years in Mexico, Carl Nebel met the artist Jean-Frédéric Waldeck, who shared Nebels deep interest in archaeol ogy and pre-Hispanic pieces. However, their friendship and affinities ended up being the cause of much friction, and finally, their es trangement. We know that the two were in close competition for the prize that would be awarded by the Paris Geographic Society to whoever traveled to Palenque and produced a full description of the site. In the end, it was Waldeck who made it to that remote locale in the middle of the Chiapas jungle; his drawings were revealed to the European public in 1838. But before the rift, Nebel and Waldeck probably traveled together to archaeologi cal sites like Teotihuacan and the ruins of Xochicalco near Cuernavaca. Later on, their paths diverged. Even though Carl Ne bel wasn't able make it to Palenque, around 1831, he made another archaeological ex pedition instead, to a less remote and less costly destination: El Taj in, Veracruz. After traveling to Nautla, he followed the Tecolut la River to Papantla, finding Totonac ruins on a ranch called Malpica along the way and more at Tuzapán. He described some of the "overlooked antiquities" that he had found in the undisturbed forest, noting that he in tended to make them known to the public. The cost of the journey was high, not just to his pocket but to his health as well: he came down with a tropical illness that put him out of commission for several months. But it was worth it. Some of his finest en gravings came out of this journey to El Tajin. His view of the Papantla pyramid (the Pyra mid of the Niches) in particular surpassed all previous depictions of the site, including one by José Antonio Alzate y Ramírez. Neb el had never shown much interest in formu lating theories about the origins of these pre Hispanic centers. Rather, his chief concern was to depict them as faithfully as possible. In the introduction to his own work, Nebel asserted that his curiosity did not extend so far as to conduct serious, fastidious re search: "The world is like a child. Those who want to be heard have to play with it and en tertain it," and so, "my pictures are the main thing, and the text provides a brief explana tion of the objects depicted." In short, rather than lengthy, erudite dissertations, he sim ply provided the image along with the most relevant details so "the merchant, artist and scholar can all find something to enjoy." Second Visit: 1840-1848 In 1833, following his trip to El Tajin, Nebel presumably visited the archaeological zone of La Quemada in Zacatecas. Once there, he sketched several buildings in a style that reflected his Romantic sensibilities. He left the country in 1834, planning to have his album published in Paris. He likely went to his native Hamburg first, and then sought out Baron von Humboldt to show him the project and invite him to write the prologue, which was dated March 1835. By that time, the printing process was well under way—or at least in the planning stages—under the di rection of the prestigious printers Paul Ren ouard, M. Moench and M. Gou. However, it would not be released until 1836. No doubt the long wait was due to the painstaking work involved in retouching each and every page with watercolors. Among those who participated in the process were renowned artists like F. Mialhe and F. Lemercier, the latter specializing in representational art. The work was probably competing against</page><page sequence="5">other "picturesque voyages" depicting coun tries like Turkey, China, Egypt, India, Russia, Brazil or even far-off Antarctica. During this time of growing capitalism and improving communication systems, European society felt a pressing need to know about every corner of the globe. Lithography had expe rienced a boom, due in part to the fact that it allowed artists to vividly portray towns and landscapes throughout the world and dis tribute their work with relative ease. Nebel's first album soon made the rounds of Mexico as well. With its superior aesthet ic quality, it was copied by several publishers, among them Vicente Garcia Torres, who in 1838 included views of certain cities, such as Aguascalientes, in a children's periodical called El Diario de los Niños. This motivated the artist to return to Mexico, to defend his copyright and promote and sell the sec ond Spanish edition, which met the print ing standards of the French edition. From documents of the period, we know that the architect reached the port of Veracruz in May 1840, and immediately filed a suit for plagiarism. His lawsuits have recently become the subject of study by several re searchers. One of them, Martha Celis de la Cruz, has reviewed the arguments made by Nebel's attorneys, which were duly report ed in Mexico City newspapers throughout the proceedings, which stretched out for months. Though it isn't known if the artist actually won the case, the second edition was a great success, despite the 100-peso price tag—an exorbitant fee at the time. Per haps its success was owing to the fact that Mexicans truly wanted to learn about their own country—its styles of dress, cityscapes, archaeological sites and many other details that were recorded in the album. This might also explain why they were willing to in dulge the author and overlook some of the more scathing comments he inserted into the explanatory text. For example: "Mexi co is a country where not much work gets done. Its inhabitants seldom think about work but often about pleasure, and as mar ket day draws to an end in any town or city, you'll find the road cluttered with drunken Indians of all ages and both sexes stumbling around or sprawled in the dust one atop the other. [...] The Mexican people, who spend freely and purposelessly, without re gard for much of anything besides satisfying their whims, love to wear new and luxuri ous clothing, and are often loaded with gold and silver even though they have no home or bed, spending the fruits of their labor on the vainest and most ephemeral things, fol lowing only their impulses." But the quality of the work put it beyond reproach. In these times of urgently needed identity and nascent nationalism, only the positive aspects were noticed. The groups who led the pack in this quest to build the nation—as represented by their writers and even their publishers—lobbied in periodi cals for the "nationalization" of images. The concept first took shape around 1837, when the publisher Ignacio Cumplido comment ed in the introduction to Mosaico mexicano, "Our land's natural wealth is so abundant, so plentiful in extraordinary phenomena, so richly endowed with brilliant landscapes, that it provides vast material for pictorial artists and the eternally sweet and harmoni ous song of Mexican poets." Faced with the reality of a fragmented nation in permanent disarray, priority was given to the building of a national identity based on Mexico's land scapes and cultures as expressed through literature and lithography. Nevertheless, the German artist's activi ties during his second visit to the country again revolved around architecture. In Oc tober 1843, Mexico City's governor asked him to join a commission devoted to evalu ating the structural integrity of a recently built theater on Calle de Vergara. One of the theater's walls had collapsed, resulting in the death of several workers and calling the structure's solidity into question. The ar chitect, Lorenzo de la Hidalga, was a Span iard whom the government had previously hired to build the Volador Market. He had taken offense at the fact that other foreign architects—among them the Frenchman Enrique Griffon, the Italian Cayetano Moro and Carl Nebel—were asked to pass judg ment on his work. In one document, Nebel pointed out that De la Hidalgas methods for obtaining projects were less than honest. He argued that Griffon should have been awarded the contract for building the the ater, even though the members of the San Carlos Academy had given it to De la Hidal ga. According to Nebel, it was De la Hidal gas maneuvering that led President Antonio López de Santa Anna to reverse the decision and pull strings so the Spaniard would get the job. The fact that he was married to a wealthy lady—Ana Garcia Icazbalceta—no doubt had a lot to do with it. Fortunately, this incident yielded a wealth of material on Nebel's life, since his criticisms and De la Hidalga's responses to the commission were amply aired in the press. At one point, the Spanish architect dared to cast doubt on the professional qualifications of some of the commission's members. Nebel responded by outlining his architectural achievements and stating his reasons for coming to Mexico. His com ments were printed by Ignacio Cumplido in an 1844 pamphlet entitled Observations by the Individuals on the Commission appoint ed by His Excellency the Governor of Mexico City for the analysis of the Santa Anna The ater, regarding their assignment. This docu ment adds to what we already know about Nebel's life, describing some of his other ar chitectural projects in Mexico, including a few that never came to fruition. According to Nebel, he had just arrived in the country in November 1840 when the government of Jalisco hired him to draw up plans for a large penitentiary with the capacity for 1000 men, along with two barracks. Besides the prestige it gave him, this project also earned Nebel a bit of cash. However, as a result of the rebellion in Guadalajara fomented by General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga in 1841, the penitentiary was never finished, and all plans for the city's beautification were put on hold. The event was far from earthshat tering in a climate where attempted coups and military uprisings were everyday hap penings. In any case, the governor of Jalisco, Antonio Escobedo, had been quite happy with the project, and commissioned Nebel to prepare sketches of the botanical garden that was to be built in that capital. Nebel later designed a poorhouse in Ve racruz for the tax minister, Ignacio Trigue ros—another highly praised effort. He also submitted a proposal for a facility for the disabled that President Antonio López de Santa Anna wanted built. He was the hands-down winner in this competition; among the participants was Lorenzo de la Hidalga. The paths that Nebel took in his bid to earn a living did not always lead to archi tectural projects but often to other areas. He invested in property, bought a brick factory and even owned a few sties for raising pigs. While perhaps not worthy of his talents as an artist and architect, these endeavors helped pay the rent. The German artist demonstrated clear intentions of putting down roots in his ad opted Mexico. In May 1841 he married Sofia Berthier, and they later had a son. 0</page><page sequence="6">The Mexican-American War Illustrated In 1847, everyday life in Mexico was torn asunder by the Mexican-American War. In early 1848, after witnessing some of the gravest tribulations of war in the capital, Nebel decided to leave the country. Based on accounts by U.S. correspondent George Wilkins Kendall, editor of the New Orleans Picayune, Nebel was apparently still in Mexico City on November 22, 1847. Colo nel James E. Duncan had written to Kend all saying he'd seen Nebel sketching in the street that day. By that time, Kendall had presumably hired Nebel to illustrate his writings, with the two agreeing to split the earnings equally. The collaboration resulted in a second album, entitled The War between the United States and Mexico Illustrated. Published simultane ously in New York and Philadelphia in 1851, the album featured twelve plates. Kendall had played a key role in the artistic aspect of the project, apparently providing Nebel with detailed descriptions of certain regions, such as northern Mexico, where the American journalist had spent most of the war working amid the occupying troops. Kendall was thus able to provide Nebel with visual references for his illustrations. Many authors have wondered how Nebel was able depict places he had never visited with such precision. They overlook the fact that there was plenty of pictorial material be ing printed in newspapers, magazines, books and albums—both Mexican and Ameri can—which he could have referred to. Ad vances in graphic techniques such as lithog raphy—which had become popular in the U.S. around 1820—had precipitated a boom in illustrated periodicals in that country. At that time, newspapers were being established specifically for a middle-class readership. These widely circulated dailies were dubbed the "penny press" owing to their low cover price. The same thing was going on in other Protestant countries like England, where Bible study had resulted in widespread literacy. The war only accentu ated the desire to read current news, com plemented by images. There is no record of their arrival, but it may be assumed that Nebel and his wife returned to Europe in 1848, possibly in the early months of the year. They likely went to Hamburg first so the artist could be re united with his family. The city they found would not have been the same: a fire had blazed through Hamburg for three days in May 1842, destroying almost half the port. There, Carl Nebel worked on his final project between 1848 and 1850, traveling constantly to Paris to meet with Kendall. It was printed by the same press that had done his first album. Nebel's fear of cholera—an epidemic that swept Europe in 1850—kept him from doing much traveling. This was a cause of exasperation for the US. reporter, who would have preferred to see the printing of the album move along more swiftly. But the final product was well worth the wait. The U.S. press sang the books praises from the outset. In an editorial, the Boston Atlas said that, "Never has any battle on the face of this earth been so well illustrated." In December 1850, the New York Herald asserted that, "the faithfulness of the landscapes and of every point where the battles took place can only be recognized and appreciated by top experts in the field." To be sure, the album fed the American hunger for a triumphant vision of history, which to a great extent explains the publications popularity. As for the aesthetic quality of the images, Nebel had done a fine job, so it was up to Kendall to launch the ad vertising blitz. The German artist apparently intended to produce another album on the same subject, judging from the watercolors that were not included in the first edition. Unfortunately this sequel was never pub lished, and the originals from the war album, as well as other works that were not included, appear to have been irrevocably lost. German and Mexican sources concur that Carl Nebel died in Paris on June 4,1855, though the French press of the time com pletely ignored the fact, making no mention of his passing in any newspaper. Translated by Daniel C. Schechter. ITINERARY OF STONE Mesoamerican Archaeology in Carl //Abel's Work Leonardo López Lujan For Marie-France Fauvet-Berthelot On December 6, 1825, a group of men assembled at the headquarters of the Paris Geographical Society to listen to David Baillie Warden lecture on the Description of the Ruins of an Ancient City: Discovered Near Palenque, a report that Capitan Antonio del Rio had submitted to the king of Spain in 1787 and which had been salvaged from de cades of oblivion and published for the first time in London in 1822. Wardens thrilling description of a city eight leagues long and possessing extremely advanced arts that had been swallowed up by the jungle had such an impact on the members of the Society that they unanimously decided to translate Del Ríos lecture into French and publish it. A few months later, they announced a con test to see who could elaborate the "most complete and precise" description of the mysterious Mayan capital. The announcement in the Society's cel ebrated Bulletin—a periodical which would later become Jules Verne's chief source of in spiration—promised to award a gold medal worth 2400 francs to the person who man aged to make his way through the jungle to the lost city and render picturesque scenes of the Palenque monuments, including plans and cross-sections, together with detailed drawings of the most exceptional sculptures. Participants were to excavate basements and aqueducts; find out about the people who had built the city, especially their cus toms and language; map out the boundaries of the ruined city, adding geographical and economic observations; and gather infor mation about the god Votan, who was "com parable to Buddha and Odin." In addition, they were also supposed to survey Yucatan and Guatemala, particularly around Mérida and Maní, as well as El Petén, Utatlán and Copán, because word had reached the Soci ety that the archaeological ruins there were connected to those of Palenque. In order to qualify for the prize, contestants had to turn their results in to the Society's headquarters by January 1, 1830. Such goals must have seemed overly ambitious or even impossible to most of the Bulletins readers, especially if they had taken one of the earliest entrants at his word when he told them that the explorers of the "American Palmira" would be facing storms, North winds, serpents, rattlesnakes, giant bats, tigers, lions, cannibals from the Lacan dón jungle, and worse still, the fearsome Mexicans, who were "uncivilized, envious and untrusting." The journey offered such terrifying prospects that this romantic call for submissions was met with a very poor response—both in quantity and in quality— and the closing date for the contest had to be deferred two years. With the extended period of time and wider circulation of the contest rules, the 70 Daniel C. Schechter. Leonardo López Luján</page><page sequence="7">situation changed radically. Many more ad venturers declared their intention to partici pate, including Francois Corroy, director of the military hospital at Villahermosa, along with his son and nephew; Abbot Henri Baradére; the multitalented Jean-Frédéric Waldeck; the ill-fated Ludwig Choris; the painter Johann Moritz Rugendas; and Juan Galindo, superior officer of the Republic of Central America. It was not long before an other name was added to the list: that of Carl Nebel, a talented German barely twenty-five years old, with studies in architecture and apparently in engineering as well. Through the agency of the French general consul in Mexico, Adrien Cochelet, this young man appealed to the Geographical Society to al low him to make the journey to Palenque. But perhaps because he had also requested financial aid, his application was kindly de clined in mid-1830. Even so, Nebel refused to admit defeat, as demonstrated by a sec ond letter that Cochelet sent to the Society near the end of the same year, which stated that the German planned to pay for the trip out of his own pocket, and would attempt to make it as far as Guatemala. Enclosed with the letter was a copy of Nebel's ambitious itinerary and program of activities, which included writing a brief history of ancient Mexico accompanied by drawings of origi nal sculptures and others taken from the codices, writing a study of pre-Hispanic mythology and another of the Piedra del Sol (the Sun Stone or Aztec Calendar, then known as the Calendar of the Mexicans), as well as descriptions and drawings of Teoti huacan, Cholula, Xochicalco, Papantla, Mit la and, of course, Palenque. Tenochtitlan and the National Museum By that time, Nebel was already a self-de clared enthusiast of Mesoamerican archae ology. During his first two years in Mexico, the country's pre-Hispanic heritage had exerted a great influence on his creative spirit, moving him to capture on paper any ancient artifact that crossed his path. This hobby would wind up producing some re markable results in his Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans la partie la plus intéres sante du Mexique, a lithographic album first published in Paris in 1836, containing twen ty out of a total of fifty plates that formed Nebel's contribution to archaeological knowl edge. This beautiful series of images reveals his predilection for architecture and sculp ture in stone, though he could not resist including a few lesser objects in ceramic or wood. The brief texts that accompany the plates—which were only meant for the readers "amusement"—reflect the thoughts and concerns of an architect who made a close study of materials and structural sys tems in order to speculate on the original dimensions, form, proportions and func tions of different monuments. We sense a common thread running through all these texts, which is the authors frank admiration for the beauty of these ar chaeological remains, in clear contrast with the ever unappreciative Alexander von Humboldt, who considered pre-Hispanic art to be utterly lacking in aesthetic value because it was produced by barbarian peo ples. But Nebel viewed these monuments as the handiwork of what he considered to be a civilization in every sense of the word, even comparing them to the paved roads, the Coliseum and other features of ancient Rome that he had seen during a trip to Italy prior to coming to Mexico. It would be reasonable to assume that Ne bel's first significant contact with Mesoameri can culture took place in Mexico City's central Plaza de Armas or Zócalo, where the Sun Stone and the statue of Coatlicue had been unearthed in the not-so-distant year of 1790. It is common knowledge that after its fortu itous discovery, the so-called Aztec calendar remained on public display at the foot of the Cathedral's west tower until 1885, as depicted in plates three and four of Nebel's album. It is easy to imagine the artist standing before this twenty-four-ton "zodiac," trying to re-create its complex iconography on paper. His atten tion to detail resulted in the impressive plate 49 of his Voyage pittoresque et archéologique. The illustration does contain a few errors, perhaps the most noticeable of which is the glyph cor responding to the date Eleven-Monkey, which he transformed into a human face followed by six circles. Even so, this lithograph was in finitely more precise than Francisco Agüeras engraving on copper which first appeared in 1792 in the Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos piedras by Antonio de León y Gama, and was then reproduced in 1810 by Hum boldt, in his Vues des cordilleres et monuments des peuples indigennes de l'Amérique. Nebel accompanied his illustration of the Sun Stone with a text based on León y Gamas work, re peating both his accuracies and his inaccura cies regarding the cosmogonic significance of the monument and its believed functions as a Xipe Totee. Plate 48, Voyage pittoresque... sundial and a device to mark equinoctial, sol sticial and zenithal passages. Nebel very rarely offered his own opinions on such matters, but made an exception when he pointed out that the two fire serpents framing the disk repre sent time as it devours human generations. Nebel must have also spent long hours working in the original National Museum building, which has since been torn down. In the central courtyard, he used both his eyes and his pen to analyze the Coatlicue statue, discovering in her features a sense of "ter ror and fear" that recalled the "strange trin ity" made up of the gods of war, death and hell. The accompanying text in this case was again based on León y Gamas descriptions. As Justino Fernández has correctly pointed out, the large-format drawing (which ap pears as plate 50) presents certain minor errors in the reproduction of the skull and the snake that descends between the god dess's legs. In the same museum, next to the Coatlicue, Nebel came across the cylindrical mass of the Stone of Tizoc. He realized de tailed drawings of the solar disc on the up per face (plate 46) and two sections carved with fifteen sequential scenes of the Aztec conquest up to and including the govern ment of the seventh Mexica tlatoani (plate 45), as well as an enlargement of the detail depicting the subjugation of Chalco (plate 44). In the explanatory texts accompanying 7\r Xipe Totee. Plate 48, Voyage pittoresque...</page><page sequence="8">these plates, the artist expresses his skepti cism that the Stone of Tizoc had ever been used for gladiatorial sacrifice, which had been the assumption of many others who had studied it before him. He correctly iden tified the toponymic glyphs as the "nations' coats-of-arms or standards," and the effigy of Tizoc as a "chief or grand personage" that wore a more elaborate helmet. However, he took the spearthrowers of the conquered warriors to be flowers or branches that they were presenting to their captors as a sign of submission. Nebel was also interested in the musi cal instruments on display at the National Museum. Plate 43 of his album featured a drawing of two drums known as teponaztlis that Guillermo Dupaix and Luciano Casta ñeda had documented in 1807 on the far side of the Sierra Nevada, during the Royal Antiquarian Expedition through New Spain. Both instruments were taken to the capi tal in 1819 at Fausto Elhuyar's suggestion, and following Independence, they passed into the museums hands. The first of the two drums was made of walnut in the city of Tlaxcala and represents a warrior. Cur rently on display in the Mexica Room of the National Museum of Anthropology, Daniel Castañeda and Vicente T. Mendoza called it "the National Museums most beautiful and best preserved piece, with the purest sound and perfect pitch." The second drum, from Tepoyango, Tlaxcala, has the date Five House carved into it (Nebel erroneously showed it as Four-House in his drawing of the piece), which may correspond to the year 1519 BC. It is a known fact that Brantz Mayer saw the teponaztli in the museum in 1841, but at some point after that, it was illic itly removed, reappearing in 1928 on the list of new acquisitions at the Heye Foundations Museum of the American Indian in New York. This explains why it is now found at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. The same plate also shows several ceramic wind instruments, all from central Mexico and all dating to the Late Postclassic Period (1325-1521 BC): a tubu lar transverse flute with one finger hole, a globular flute with one finger hole, a whistle, and two tubular flutes with flower-shaped bells and four finger holes. The Attraction of Collecting Almost immediately upon arriving in Mex ico, Nebel came into contact with a circle of people who were all antique enthusiasts. 72 They included Lukas Vischer from Switzer land, Jean-Frédéric Waldeck from France, and the Germans Maximilian Franck, Carl Uhde and Johann Moritz Rugendas. These foreigners had followed the lead of local dilettantes such as Luciano Castañeda, the Count of Peñasco and the Marchioness of Selva Nevada who had all begun putting together their own collections. They often sold archaeological pieces back and forth, or loaned them to each other temporarily to draw them. Even though Nebel was much younger than most of the other members of the group, his artistic abilities and the fact that his mother tongue was German must have helped him fit in very quickly. Reliable sources tell us that Nebel had an intense relationship with Waldeck that was both collaborative and competitive in na ture. They continued their friendship even after they had both left Mexico. Among other objects, we know that Nebel bor rowed the Waldeck's coyote and "Tonatiuh (or Apollo)," but gave him a crude ceramic replica of the Sun Stone, apparently with the idea of playing a practical joke on the Aus trian. Nebel also depicted some sculptures from Vischer s collection: a serpentine block that represented the "weaponry of Tezcuco" and a superb effigy of Xipe Totee (plate 48) made in Texcoco and currently on display at the Basel Museum der Kulturen. Nebels keen eye detected that the latter represented a priest dressed in human skin during the month of Tlacaxipehualiztili. He enjoyed collecting small, mass-pro duced archaeological objects like the heads from Teotihuacan (plate 49) and Aztec figu rines and seals (plates 46-48). He included many of them in his album "to demonstrate the degree of perfection [the ancient Mexi cans] had attained in this artistic field." He linked his figurines to different gods, priests and warriors, though not always correctly: for example, he confused Ehécatl with Tonatiuh and Xochiquétzal with Coatlicue. Near the end of his life, Nebel left a total of twenty-eight ceramic, stone and bone figu rines to an individual whose last name was Lohse. The small collection eventually made its way into the hands of his daughter, Mrs. Lohse-Boudet, who donated it to the Musée d'Éthnographie du Trocadéro in 1935. Only a few years ago, these pieces were removed to the Musée du Quai Branly. Of them, Ne bel had depicted two anthropomorphic fig urines in plate 46, two more in plate 47 and one more in plate 48. On the Other Side of the Mountains New horizons opened up for the young German when he left Mexico City to spend time in the Sierra Nevada and the Ajusco. In Cholula, he did a romantic engraving of the Tlachihaltépetl or "handmade moun tain," whose gargantuan dimensions were unmatched in Mexico (plate 12). Construc tion on this pyramid began in the Preclassic period, and after the arrival of the Spaniards, it was dedicated to the divinity Chicna huiquiáhuitl ("Nine-Rain"), to whom chil dren were sacrificed in exchange for rain. Compared to older engravings by Humboldt and Castañeda, Nebels lithograph is quite accurate. His vantage point was evidently a small pre-Hispanic mound to the west of the pyramid, known as the Cerro Cocoyo; it is now entirely surrounded by the town. Nebel captured the monument in such a way that it appeared to be a natural geographic for mation, with a misty sky in the background, and crowned by the Church of Our Lady of Remedios, whose south tower had not yet been built. In the distance on the left, we see La Malinche's snowy peak and the city of Puebla in silhouette. In 1831, Nebel visited the ruins of Xo chicalco, a site in the state of Morelos from the Epiclassic period (650-900 A.D.) whose existence was first reported by Fray Ber nardino de Sahagún around 1580, and then by Fernando de Alva Ixtilixóchitl in 1611. Though Nebel never mentions his sources, it is clear from his album that he relied heavily on a 1791 article by Joseph Antonio Alzate, a prominent intellectual in New Spain who had visited the site in 1777 and then again in 1784. This influence becomes clear in plate 29, where Nebel hypothetically reconstructs the Temple of Plumed Serpents based on Alzates premise that it had originally fea tured five superimposed bodies. Even so, Nebel must be given credit for having been the first to suggest that Xochicalco's famous underground observatory had acted as a zenith finder, as well as for having executed the most beautiful lithographs ever made of the site. As the subject for his plate 28, Nebel chose the northeast corner of the Temple of Plumed Serpents—without a doubt the most attractive angle from which to portray this building that would be reconstructed by Leopoldo Batres in 1909. Both Waldeck and Adela Bréton drew the same corner, and Leopoldo Batres and Antonio Peñafiel pho tographed it. In his lithograph, Nebel filled</page><page sequence="9">in missing blocks and reliefs, eliminated rubble, added some palm trees and left out the flight of steps, as if the southern half of the temple didn't exist. The scale—as indi cated by four nicely drawn visitors—gives the impression that the structure is thirty percent higher than it actually is. Nebel also reproduced details from the bas-reliefs carved into the blocks of tra chytic porphyry that form the temple, and identified certain figures in them that were similar to those of Palenque, which means that when he wrote the accompanying texts, he had access to either Del Ríos or Dupaix's work. Plate 25 shows one of the lesser per sonages from the southern slope (as2 or as8, according to Virginia Smiths nomenclature, as outlined in her publication of 2000), but Nebel transformed the speech scrolls into long feathers, the reptilian head on the head dress into plant motifs, and the cut snail into a kind of support. Similarly, plate 24 repre sents a figure from one of the panels, but it fuses elements from twi, TW2 and TN4 (ac cording to the same nomenclature). There, the headdress in the form of a year glyph has been transformed into a multitiered conical hat adorned with a snake, the goggles have been transformed into glasses, and the jaw appears without teeth or speech scrolls. Exploring Veracruz and Zacatecas Nebel spent months appealing to the Mexi can government and potential subscribers in an attempt to find funding for his long hoped-for trip to Palenque. But unlike the great response that Waldeck obtained, all of Nebel's efforts were in vain. He was unable to sell his archaeological drawings to the Prus sian consul, who felt that Nebel's asking price of ten thousand piastres was excessive. So the young architect had no other remedy but to send word to the Geographical Society by way of Cochelet that he was definitively with drawing from the competition. This was on December 30,1831. Around the time that he was making this tough decision, Nebel went on an expedition to the dense tropical for est of Totonacapan in Veracruz—a trip that would cost him 1200 pesos and a terrible ill ness. One of the places he visited was Mapilca, in the municipality of Tecolutla—which José García Pavón catalogued as archaeological site number 101. Plate 39 of Nebel's Voyage pittoresque shows a block carved in the style typical to El Tajin, making it contemporary to Mapilca. In his notes, Nebel mentioned the presence of several pyramids and pavements. n To these we must add the twenty houses (one that was seventy paces long and ten feet tall) that Dr. G. Schiede de Cassel and Mr. Deppe had counted during their expedition to the site in late 1828 or early 1829. From Mapilca, Nebel headed northwest and crossed the Tecolutla River to reach El Tajin. Immediately upon arriving, he had the trees growing around the Pyramid of Niches cut down in order to elaborate what is un deniably the most spectacular lithograph in his album (plate 37). He drew a geometric reconstruction of the eastern face (without errors or omissions, though with the inex plicable addition of a flight of stairs) that would allow viewers to calculate the exact measurements of any architectural element based on the lithograph. So the sandstone niches are seen to emerge majestically from among lush vegetation, elegantly placed one on top of the other until they reach nearly twenty-five meters in height. Nebel's explan atory text betrays a clear intent to take credit for the discovery of this majestic city which experienced its apogee between 750 and 950 A.D. He writes, "Though it has been men tioned by Baron von Humboldt and oth ers [...], it has never been drawn, nor has there been any precise account of it. Known only by reputation, no one has ever seen it except for some local Indians." This was far from the truth. An anonymous article from the Gazeta de México informed its readers Aztec Seals. Plate 48, Voyage pittoresque... that Diego Ruiz—a tobacco inspector in the Papantla jurisdiction—had stumbled upon the Pyramid of Niches in March 1785 while touring the area looking for clandestine plantations. The article in question contains a detailed description of the pyramid and is accompanied by a copper engraving signed "Garcia." Later, in 1804, Ruiz's information and a copy of the engraving were published in Europe by the Jesuit Pedro José Márquez in his Due antichi monumenti.... We should add that Dupaix visited El Tajin at some point prior to 1805, but his notes and draw ings were regrettably mislaid. Nebel made another discovery on the same expedition—one he could rightly claim as his own. That was Tuzapan, a site from the Postclassic period (1200-1521 A.D.) that few people have visited. Though many still believe the site to be lost, this center is clearly marked on the map. It is situated near the town of Chicualoque, in the municipal ity of Coyutla, near the Puebla state border. Archaeological site number sixty-eight in García Payón's catalogue, Tuzapan stands on a plateau a few kilometers from the San Marcos-Cazones River. It bears mentioning that it was also inspected in February 1939 by Wilfrido Dusolier and Enrique Juan Pa lacios, and by Humberto Besso-Oberto in 1987. It is currently being studied by the archaeologist Maria Rosa Avilez. She men tions that the dense forest that appears in Aztec Seals. Plate 48, Voyagepitloresque...</page><page sequence="10">Nebel's plate 34 has been clearcut to permit the cultivation of coffee and the grazing of livestock. This has obviously accelerated the site's rate of destruction and the looting of its temples, ball courts, walls, cisterns and canals, making its protection all the more urgent. The main pyramid features four tiers with a total height of seven and a half meters, and a flight of stairs on the west side. The roof of the chapel that can be seen in the lithograph has since disappeared, as has the image of Chalchiuhtlicue that was carved into the rock and functioned as a fountain (plate 35). The last archaeological site to be captured in a lithograph for Voyage pittoresque was the Epiclassic city of La Quemada, in the state of Zacatecas. Nebel also took the opportunity to visit the English silver mine named Veta Grande, whose director of workings was the Prussian Joseph Burkart, and whose super visor of construction and smelting was Carl de Berghes, of French and German extrac tion. These two engineers were very familiar with the La Quemada ruins, having written lengthy descriptions and made drawings and maps of them, as well as doing some excava tion there. With two such exceptional guides as these, Nebel reached La Quemada where he drew the majestic west flank of the so-called "Mountain of Buildings" (plate 21). In his lithograph, we can see the massive curtains of rhyolitic tuff that cover the mountainsides, as well as the step terraces that extend from the Acropolis in the south to the Citadel in the north. According to Nebel, the Acropolis served a religious function and the Citadel a military one. The second image from La Que mada depicts the fifth tier of the Acropolis, also known as the "Plaza of Sacrifices" (plate 22). This consists of a sunken quad with an al tar in the center, surrounded by large rooms and a five-tiered pyramidal basement. Inter estingly, the lithograph shows an individual wielding a pickaxe, perhaps in allusion to the explorations that Berghes was commissioned to do by Governor Francisco Garcia Salinas between the years 1832 and 1834. Finally, plate 23 reproduces one of four maps that Berghes did of the site between 1830 and 1856, two of which are now pre served at the Manuel Orozco y Berra Map Library. The one that Nebel copied is based on Berghess second map, though it is slight ly more precise in terms of topography, the groupings of structures and the plotting of internal avenues. A Disappointing Verdict Subsequent issues of the Bulletin informed its readers that Carl Nebel had been ac cepted as a member of the Geographic So ciety on December 20, 1833, and also that the contests closing date had been post poned two more times. The much awaited results were not announced until April 1836. Among other comments, the judging com mittee expressed its regret that "the skillful Mr. Nebel was not able to join Mr. Waldeck on all these excursions. The combined tal ents of the architect and the painter would have been equal to this immense task." It described his drawings of La Quemada as "careful and refined," and lamented the fact that no one of Nebel's stature had made the trip to Guatemala. It stated tersely that none of the participants had fulfilled the require ments, so the contest's closing date would be put off for the last time until December 31, 1839, increasing the medal's value to 3000 francs. Silver medals were awarded as con solation prizes to Baradére and Lord Kings borough for their respective publications on the expedition that Dupaix and Castañeda had made to Palenque. Galindo received another silver medal, Waldeck and Corroy were found deserving of bronze medals, and Warden received special mention for pub lishing Del Rio's report in French. In 1840, as was to be expected, the contest was declared null and void, and thus came to an end. Translated by Michelle Suderman. ITINERARY OF EXOTICISM ^Picturesque Mexico Pablo Diener The German traveler Carl Nebel was only twenty-four years old when he came to Mexico for the first time in 1829. Perhaps he was drawn here by the grow ing curiosity this country was arousing in Europe: Alexander von Humboldt had just published a showy volume containing an account of his expedition to America, and Robert Buford's firm had organized a spec tacular panorama on the Mexican capital in downtown London. We can follow Nebel's progress in those years through the journal entries of another celebrated traveler, the artist and archae ologist Jean-Frédéric Waldeck. In early 1830, Waldeck's comments gave the impression that Nebel was hoping to be hired to build some baths—in other words, that he was trying to find ways to earn a living through his trade as an architect. But with passing days and journal entries, references to Nebel spoke more frequently of his work as an illus trator. In January 1831, Waldeck wrote about their plan to collaborate on a publication for which they were trying to find subscribers. Though this project never got off the ground, Waldeck does indicate that Nebel had long been cultivating the notion of a publication based on his drawings. The book that Nebel finally wound up publishing in Paris in 1836—originally enti tled Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans lapartie la plus intéressante du Mexique—was first conceived in Europe, and contains glim mers of his wide-ranging motivations and opinions. This beautiful large-format volume contains fifty illustrations and an explanatory text for each plate. It pertains to the genre of the picturesque voyage, which is a kind of illustrated book in the tradition of travel lit erature that became quite popular during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Anything that could surprise a reader for its novelty, strangeness or magnificence was considered to be picturesque. In the language of classicist aesthetics, it was an idea that fell somewhere between the beautiful and the sublime, between a balanced sensation of harmony and the excitement of wonder. Its essence was constituted by strange realities— the more distant and exotic the better. Istan bul, Egypt, southern Italy and Spain were the first places to make their appearance in this genre. Over time, the picturesque voy age began to focus on any kind of curiosity, wherever it was found, though always try ing to evoke a sense of mystery and wonder. Even when offering tales and illustrations of travels to places in the heart of Europe—Co logne or Strasburg, for example—the way the cathedrals in these relatively familiar set tings were portrayed drew a connection be tween the architecture and certain fabulous phenomena of a primitive nature. Nebel was very clear about his intention to become a part of this tradition. "The New World, so rich in objects of curiosity and in terest for Europe," he wrote in the introduc tion to his book, "has frequently been visited by celebrated travelers who have provided us with valuable information in terms of statistics, natural history and so forth, but whether it is out of disdain or for some other reason, these gentlemen have neglected the 74 Pablo Diener</page><page sequence="11">picturesque aspect of this country, which I feel to be no less interesting than the scien tific aspect. Not everyone is a geographer, a botanist, a mineralogist or what have you, but everyone is curious." The Route and the Themes It was with this vision that the German artist and traveler published one of the first pic turesque works on Mexico to feature such a broad thematic spectrum. It included il lustrations of the natural world and differ ent kinds of settlements, views of a number of cities and archaeological motifs. The geographical area covered was divided into three regions: central Mexico, including the capital; Puebla and the archaeological site of Xochicalco; the Gulf side of the Sierra Madre Oriental, from Veracruz north as far as Papantla; and the mining region of north western Mexico, especially Zacatecas and Guanajuato. Two other isolated points are also represented: the ports of Acapulco on the Pacific coast, and Tampico in the Gulf of Mexico. Archaeological motifs predominate in the book, with a total of twenty plates, half of which are drawings of museum piec es—pre-Hispanic sculptures, reliefs and ceramics—while the remaining ten include eight views of archaeological sites and the surrounding vegetation, an idealized recon struction of the pyramid of Xochicalco and a ground plan of the archaeological site of La Quemada, near Zacatecas. Some of the pages that best express the book's purpose are those that represent ar chaeological remains amid vegetation that is as luxuriant as it is aggressive. This creates a feeling of dramatic tension as these historic monuments appear to be struggling to sur vive in the face of the relentless onslaught of the jungle. On the contrary, Nebel's views of cities have a purely descriptive purpose, animated here and there by human figures. He invari ably drew either a very detailed depiction of the main square or represented the urban panorama from a somewhat elevated point of view. They all seem to indicate that the artist relied on some sort of mechanical de vice in his work, whether that be a Camara Obscura or a Camera Lucida. Nebels way of perceiving town squares was based on a very common model, creat ing mainly symmetrical compositions that emphasize the vanishing lines, thus accen tuating the spatial sense. There is a clear in tent to meticulously document the architec tural essence of these urban centers. These drawings also exhibit an evident academic understanding of each city, whose essence may be seen in certain emblematic build ings that represent the centers of power—in other words, classic monuments. Nebel does not stray from that purpose in search of some urban curiosity—a fountain, an inviting alleyway, a chance observation of everyday life. His wide views taken from the outskirts of the city also follow a certain pattern, with the aim of providing a general impres sion of the city while drawing attention to any unique features of its skyline, as in the panoramic view of Mexico as seen from Ta cubaya, or of pointing out some distinctive aspect of its geographic setting, such as the view of Puebla with the volcanoes in the background, or that of Tampico, with the port in the foreground. Nebel's illustrations of everyday life are the third largest category in the album, with a total of ten plates. These scenes focus on human figures, with little scenic embel lishment. They are mainly typical Mexican figures, such as the rancher, the wealthy ha cienda-owner, the porter and the poblana, with an emphasis on the detailed represen tation of their costumes. But their physical attributes and the situations represented are idealized and unrealistic, utterly lack ing in spontaneity. Nebel's main source of inspiration in this case appears to have been the illustra tions of typical Mexican figures published in 1828 by the Italian artist Claudio Linati. On occasion, we can identify a more direct in fluence, as in the case of Las tortilleras (The Tortilla Makers), a composition that was quite clearly based on Waldeck's painting of the same subject, which he was working on in late 1829, during the period when he and Nebel were frequent companions. Some of the illustrations depict indige nous groups and their activities. The accom panying texts often border on social criti cism, speaking of these groups' increasing acculturation. However, such impressions are not conveyed by the images, unlike the work of other itinerant artists such as the Baron de Courcy and his portrayal of life in the mines, or Daniel Thomas Egerton and Johann Mortiz Rugendas, whose vigorous depictions of individuals in specific situa tions allowed viewers to better understand certain aspects of their existence. When leafing through the illustrations in this album, we find they evoke the ways in which the eighteenth-century artistic tradition approached rural life, similarly to Goya's initial designs for tapestries to be hung in Spanish palaces. The rural world is interpreted as an idyllic space, where one can play, converse, breathe fresh air and en joy nature, and sometimes even work a little. In the case of Nebel's book, that spirit was very likely imprinted on the images by the engravers, who cultivated a profoundly clas sicist tradition. Finally, landscapes only figure in this album when associated with archaeological motifs or cities: as an independent subject they do not form part of Nebel's repertoire. In this sense, the plate entitled Monte Vir gen—which is set in the middle of the tropi cal jungle—cannot really be considered an exception to the rule, given that it is in fact an idealized composition based on a study of local plant life, following a well-known para digm of American iconography created in the early nineteenth century by the French traveler Count Frédéric de Clarac. The ac tual mountains, rivers, cliffs and bays that the artist saw during his trip were only con sidered to be worth representing if they were in some way connected to a human creation. The more or less realistic manner in which each of the above subjects was de picted depended essentially on the artistic sense of the illustrator and that of his col laborators—the engravers who transformed his drawings into lithographs. Nebel did in fact visit all the geographical sites included in this picturesque journey, so all his illus trations could well have been based on first hand experience. Once again, it is Waldeck who comes to our aid in answering this question: a diary entry from 1832 informs us that Nebel had traveled to Veracruz with the idea of visiting Papantla. Our skeptical journal-keeper expressed his suspicion that the young German was in fact planning to go to Palenque, but had kept it to himself in hopes of gaining the advantage when it came to exploring this region he was so eager to learn about. It is unclear whether Nebel actually considered this possibility, but we do know that he never made it to the Mayan region. In a journal entry from September of the same year, Waldeck mentioned that he had had news of Nebel, who was then in Zacate cas and earning a decent living as a museum illustrator. 75</page><page sequence="12">Of all the places represented in this book, the one that was furthest removed from the three areas where Nebel had concentrated his attention was Tampico. One explanation for its inclusion is that it would likely have been his port of entry, having sailed diago nally across the Gulf of Mexico from New Orleans to the Tamaulipas city. Indeed, the Baron de Courcy was one of many travelers to take the same route in those years, having arrived in Mexico in the 1830s. The Conception and Production of Voyage Pittoresque et Archéologique As a kind of letter of intent, the final para graph of Carl Nebel's brief introduction to his album reads: "In my drawings I have represented objects in a conscientious man ner and with great precision, without allow ing fantasy to intervene in any way." But im mediately afterward, he stresses the fact that while his drawings were probably of interest to experts, his work was in fact destined for a broader public, and that his purpose was not to instruct but to entertain. This objective must have also had com mercial ramifications. Publishing an illus trated book of this caliber was an undertak ing that entailed considerable financial risk, of the kind that had already ruined more than one publisher. So it was important to make the publication attractive to the wid est possible spectrum of potential buyers. But the idea also responded to a long term pedagogical goal, like the one that had been championed by Alexander von Hum boldt in recent decades. In the Prussian sci entist's opinion, it was necessary to promote the study and knowledge of the American continent, and artists could make a fun damental contribution to that enterprise. While his studies and published works al ways emphasized physical geography, there were other points of interest such as history and information relating to the local popula tion. This was what had attracted him about Nebel's project, and he became the younger man's mentor while the album was still in its early stages. Between January and March, 1835—a year before the album was published— Humboldt offered the same article to the Berlin press three times. In it, he described Nebel's project in highly complimentary terms. The article opens with a few remarks on recent advances in archaeological inves tigation in the Americas, stating that it had been given quite a boost in recent decades. 7f He thus laid the groundwork for his asser tion that he would be discussing some of the burning questions of the time. He then went on to write, "I draw the reader's attention to ancient American monuments here, but only in order to publicize and recommend a project dealing with the architectural and artistic projects of the natives of Anahuac (the Mexican Altiplano), which—being the work of an exceptional artist—we predict will surpass all archaeological and pictur esque expectations." Humboldt's heartfelt endorsement of this album continued on in the same vein for more than five pages, mentioning some of the latest discoveries included in it and reproducing images and commentaries on certain archae ological monuments that had been practically unheard of until then. Quite familiar with his contemporaries' weak spots, Humboldt went on at length in his erudite comments, but also took the time to describe the efforts the au thor must have gone to, even clearing the veg etation from some of the pyramids in order to show them in their best light. Humboldt's own published works in cluded an album of plates published in 1810 under the title Vues des cordilléres et monu ments des peuples indigennes de l'Amérique (Views of the Mountain Ranges and Monu ments of the Indigenous Peoples of Ameri ca). This was undoubtedly a landmark work in the creation of an American iconography in Europe. Nebel turned to this traveler and scien tist for support and to ask him to write the introduction to his album—which was in fact only a brief summary of the text he had written for the press—because he wanted to consult the greatest authority on all areas of Americanist knowledge at the time. It comes as no surprise, then, that several of the ar chaeological studies in Nebel's album were of sites that had previously appeared in Hum boldt's works. Even the emphasis on archae ology may be attributable to his influence. So, the work of the young German art ist became a vehicle for the promulgation of major areas of scientific knowledge. It took material form through the technique of li thography—engraving images onto a stone block and then printing them on paper— which since its invention in Munich in the late eighteenth century had revolutionized the production of illustrated books. Humboldt's article stated that the book would be published in ten installments con taining five illustrations each. It was clearly a complex undertaking, given that the print ing was farmed out to several different Pa risian houses, relying most heavily on three of them (Lemercier, Benard &amp; Frey and Mialhe) and that a total of twelve engravers participated in elaborating the plates. Detailed observation of the lithogra phers' work becomes especially important here. Given that Nebel's original drawings on which the lithographic plates were based have not yet surfaced, an analysis of habitual practices among engravers is the only way to glimpse certain unique features of the artist's work. The engraver responsible for the larg est number of images in the album was Jean-Baptiste Arnout, one of the founders of lithography in France, who had traveled extensively throughout Europe and gained fame as an illustrator with his engravings of Paris and medieval monuments. In Nebel's book, he engraved cityscapes and archaeo logical sites. He had previously worked for Engelmann's publishing house, creating lith ographs of two drawings by J. M. Rugendas for Voyage pittoresque dans le Brésil, a well known work which the Bavarian artist com pleted in 1835. Given that the initial draw ings for these two lithographs have been preserved, we can get an idea of how the engraver "dialogued" with the originals. For the book on Brazil, Arnout engraved an il lustration of farm equipment and a study of a bridge. In both cases, the main subject has been depicted in detail, demonstrating the kind of work that was characteristic of an illustrator with technical skill. But Arnout simplifies the plant life and details of the ground's morphology—which is differenti ated in Rugendas's drawings—to the point of monotony. His handling of the human figure is schematic, as he applies academic models without much subtlety. Arnout's most striking lithographs of Nebel's work are those that represent cit ies, including a partial view of the Zócalo in Mexico City, the plazas of Veracruz and Zacatecas, and a panoramic view of San Luis Potosí. The precision of the engrav ings when it comes to architecture appears to have equaled that of the original draw ings, and the series of figures that create a lively setting for each of these spaces must have been provided by Nebel as well, as the engraver has depicted the figures more deli cately than usual. This confirms something that seemed likely from the outset: Nebel was able to capture the human figure more</page><page sequence="13">naturally than was common among his Eu ropean contemporaries, and even more sub tly than most engravers. Given Arnout's abilities as a technical draftsman, he would have been the obvi ous choice as a lithographer when it came to many of the plates of archaeological objects. Another important engraver in this al bum was Frédéric Mialhe, who also partici pated as a printer. He mainly collaborated on plates with archaeological subject matter, and created the engravings of a few views of cities. In 1837, immediately following his work on Nebel's album, Mialhe went to Cuba, where he remained for nearly twenty years. Here, he produced one of the finest collec tions of images ever done of the Caribbean island, recording views of the beautiful city of Havana and other urban areas, as well as costumbrista images, which depict local customs and manners. Perhaps some part of that desire to become an itinerant artist came from the curiosity that Nebels draw ings aroused in the French engraver. When it came to costumbrista images, the name that most frequently appeared in Nebel's album was that of Pierre-Frédéric Lehnert. Besides contributing six scenes featuring typical Mexican figures, he also worked on the Mexican edition, Viaje pin toresco y arqueológico, being responsible for representing human figures in certain cityscapes that had been engraved by other masters of lithography. Lehnert's biography mentions that during his career as a painter, he was most often seen showing work that featured animals at the Salon de Paris. Another important engraver—Alexis Victor Joly—only contributed one plate to Nebel's album, entitled Monte Virgen. As suggested above, this piece's significance lies in the fact that it is the only one devoted entirely to the tropical landscape. Here, we are most concerned with Joly's participation, because he also worked for the Engelmann publishing house on a volume of Rugendas's work, engraving two plates dealing with similar subject matter: Virgin Jungle near Manqueritipa, near Rio de Janeiro, and Li ana Bridge. In Mexico, Nebel must have heard Waldeck praise the way the natural world had been represented in Rugendas's work, and later, in Europe, he probably heard Humboldt comment that these images by the Bavarian artist were the finest record ever made of tropical plant life. These representations of lush vegetation were in fact idealized views, but the detail with which the plants were depicted and the overall impression combined to create plausible compositions. The intellectual au thor of this theme was Humboldt, through his writings Essay on the Geography of Plants (1805) and Aspects of Nature (1807), so it is easy to understand why, once Nebel had placed himself under the protective wing of the Prussian naturalist, it would have become fundamentally important to in clude an image of this type. Monte Virgen s composition may have been designed in Europe, so Joly's collaboration would have been vital. As the engraver, he was respon sible for making it look realistic. In fact, the illustration bears a striking similarity to Virgin Jungle near Manqueritipa, which was drawn by Rugendas and engraved by Joly. Furthermore, Nebel's comments in the text accompanying Monte Virgen are unequivo cally Humboldtian in tone: he emphasizes the incredible diversity of flora, identifies several of the plants in the foreground (such as bamboo and Guadua angustifolia), followed by the royal palm, and draws the reader's attention to the giant wild fig tree in the left background, whose presence is as majestic as the text, which states that its trunk forms "a mass capable of holding up a cathedral." This example demonstrates that the role of the engraver should not be seen as a kind of interference (in the negative sense of the term), but rather an interaction with the artist that can contribute to the overall im provement of the composition. And so, when leafing through a copy of Nebel's album, we can detect the involve ment of many sets of hands. When we compare copies, we find that they don't all feature the exact same combination of black and-white and color lithographs. The plates don't even respect a fixed order, and bear no numbers or any other kind of marking that would indicate the sequence in which they are to appear. With the exception of a more or less clear relationship between cer tain series of two or three illustrations, they appear in a fairly random order that varies from one copy to another. In this sense, they do appear to have been arranged more to delight the senses rather than to suggest any kind of overall scheme. Furthermore, Hum boldt himself stated that in a pictorial atlas, the variety of images could make up for a lack of order. Besides all such formal concerns, the prestigious Americanist's article was a true panegyric for Nebel's work. Well aware of the significance given to his opinion and persona, Humboldt praised Nebel's book highly, going so far as to state that he had long hoped to see someone continue and improve on the work he himself had begun more than twenty years earlier with the pub lication of Vues des cordilléres. He went on to express a wish that some talented artist would come along and provide substitutes for what, with overstated modesty, he called "my own drawings of little merit." This wish would finally come true with the publica tion of Carl Nebel's Voyage pittoresque et ar chéologique dans lapartie la plus intéressante du Mexique. Translated by Michelle Suderman. ITINERARY OF A BATTLE A Great ^merican Book The War between the United States and Mexico, Illustrated Ron Tyler It is not certain when journalist George Wilkins Kendall first thought of doing an illustrated history of the war between the United States and Mexico (1846-1848), but that he would write a book was almost a foregone conclusion. He was a best-selling author, the editor of the New Orleans Pica yune, and a correspondent with the Ameri can Army in Mexico. "If no other advantage to the country is derived from his enlistment in this most just and holy war," a reporter for the New York Herald had predicted after Kendall's first despatches from the front ap peared, "literature will receive a valuable ad dition, and K[endall] will write a book." But the history of the Mexican war would be particularly important to Americas self image. The practice of history has rarely been held in higher esteem than it was in America in the mid-nineteenth century. If it was true, as the Romantics held, that the survival of the republic depended upon the wisdom and virtue of its citizenry, which would be strengthened by knowledge of the past, then an episode of this significance had to be placed in its proper context. It has been obscured to most Americans because of the devastating Civil War (1861-1865) 77 Ron Tyler</page><page sequence="14">which followed it by only a few years, but the conflict with Mexico was Americas first foreign war and was seen as a defining mo ment for the United States. Kendall wanted to show it in this context, as "the opening of a new volume of American history." Insofar as Kendall was concerned, the history also had to be illustrated, and he chose German artist Carl Nebel to provide the pictures for his book. Nebel was a uni versity-educated architect and engineer, born in Altona, Schleswig-Holstein, on March 18, 1805. Inspired by the great Ger man naturalist Alexander von Humboldt to travel to Mexico, he spend the years from 1829 to 1834 making the sketches for what became his monumental Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans la partie la plus intéres sante du Mexique, which contains fifty hand colored lithographs of the people, places, and ancient monuments of Mexico and was published in 1836 by Moench &amp; Gau in Par is. It is possible that Kendall first met him in 1842, when the journalist was in Mexico City as a Santa Fe expedition prisoner. At any rate, he was aware of Nebel's great work, for he adapted one of the images—Pobla nas—to illustrate his 1844 Narrative of the Texan Santa Fé Expedition. The resulting book, The War between the United States and Mexico, Illustrated (1851), was a work of art, one of the most beautiful productions of the nineteenth century and on a par with other great illustrated works by artists such as Karl Bodmer, Daniel Thomas Egerton, Pedro Gualdi, and Carl Nebel himself. In October, 1847, while the diplomats gathered around the conference table in the hamlet of Guadalupe Hidalgo, three miles north of Mexico City, to work out a peace treaty, Kendall sailed to Europe to find craftsmen to produce his book. Nebel remained in Mexico, where he continued to work on the twelve scenes that he and Kend all had agreed upon for the book: the battles of Palo Alto, Monterrey, Buena Vista, Vera cruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, two of Molino del Rey, two of Chapulte pec, and Scott's entrance into Mexico City. A friend provided Kendall with a progress report on November 22: "I see Navel [sic] on the street [;] he says he is getting on well with his pictures—now that I am in limbo I cannot go to see them, or I should give you some account of them." To reproduce the paintings, they chose the Paris firm of Rose-Joseph Lemercier, which had done a number of lithographs 78 for Nebel's Voyage pittoresque. The era of the aquatint engraving—which the Havells, father and son, used to produce John James Audubon's magnificent The Birds of America (1826-1839) and Karl Bodmer employed in the atlas for Prince Maximilian's Reise in das inner Nord-America in den Jahren 1832 bis 1834 (1839)—was coming to an end, be cause lithography was less expensive and improving in picture quality. Lemercier was known for the new processes and technical innovations he had developed, including a method of spreading powdered lithograph ic crayon on a warm stone, then working it with a brush or a dabber to obtain delicate shadings for skies and water. Lithographers also struggled with how to make a gradu ated tint, and by the early 1840s Lemercier was experimenting with what he called his lavis lithographique, or graded washes on stone. The result was similar to that achieved by aquatint, which by the time Kendall and Nebel began work on this portfolio was a vanishing art because lithography offered a simpler and more aesthetically competitive alternative. The work proceeded more slowly than expected. The lithographers could not begin their work until they had finished with the paintings from Nebel, then, as one journalist noted, Nebel "discarded every stone which on trial showed the slightest defect." His be havior exasperated Kendall, who, while on a trip to London in May 1849, complained to his old friend Thomas Falconer, who had also been a member of the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, "that Nebel, the German with whom I am engaged with the lithographs [...] is a most strange man, and were it not that I am in so deep I should cut loose from him at once." Before Kendall concluded the letter, however, he received a note from Nebel saying that he had "fixed every thing right with the lithographers" and returned to Hamburg. Finally, one of the skilled lithographers at Lemercier's—Adolphe Jean-Baptiste Bay ot—copied all twelve of Nebel's pictures on stone, getting assistance from Louis Philippe Alphonse Bichebois only on Storming of Cha pultepec—Quitman's Attack. Kendall later claimed that more than sixty workers were involved in the process of printing and col oring the lithographs and that the process was so demanding that only 120 copies could be finished each month. Kendall then returned to the United States to finalize the arrangements for pub lication. He did not want to delay any longer, because a spate of books about the war had already appeared and some general histo ries were now coming on the market. Three even included the sort of illustrations that Nebel had prepared: Captain Daniel Pow ers Whiting produced the Army Portfolio (1847), while Lieutenant Henry Walke pub lished the Naval Portfolio (1848). In London, meanwhile, John Phillips and Alfred Rider joined forces to produce Mexico Illustrated in Twenty-Six Views (1848). These illustra tions are all based on eyewitness images, but none contain as much text as Kendall's did, nor were as well promoted as his work would be. Landing at New York, Kendall went first to Harper &amp; Brothers, the publisher of his Narrative of the Texan Santa Fé Expedition, to arrange for the distribution of his book, but he negotiated a more favorable arrange ment with D. Appleton &amp; Company. Then he proceeded to New Orleans, where he showed an advance copy of the work to his colleagues, made arrangements for agents to sell it up and down the Mississippi, paused to share his enthusiasm with his sister ("Ev ery one here speaks in the highest terms of my book of illustrations. I know that it will go off") and returned to England, where he contracted with artist George Frederick Rosenberg to color fifty sets of the twelve battle scenes—"as well, in every respect, as the models furnished him"—for three shil lings per print. Once these matters had been taken care of, Kendall returned to Paris and en tered into an agreement with Nebel which formalized the arrangement that they had probably worked out in Mexico City: to be "joint and equal partners in all the profits arising from the sale of the work." They also agreed on a second and much larger work that Kendall had in mind, but it was never published (this manuscript is in the Special Collections Division, University of Texas at Arlington Libraries). Reporters began to comment on Nebel's prints even before the book was finished. The Paris correspondent for the New York Herald got an early glimpse of what he called "one of the most superb works of art ever achieved in Paris." In December 1850, he reported that "the fidelity of the landscapes, and the truthfulness of every point introduced into the pictures, cannot but be at once acknowl edged and appreciated by the best connois seur." When the first copies reached New</page><page sequence="15">Orleans, the Picayune advertised it in three different formats: text and plates in paper covers for $34; in "elegant portfolios" for $38, and half-bound for $40. Those prices would be the equivalent of $795.98, $889.62, and $936.44 in 2003 U.S. dollars—not an inexpensive book. According to newspaper accounts at the time, Kendall published 500 copies of The War between the United States and Mexico, Illustrated. The pictures also encourage the viewer to take them to be accurate records, for they look real. Nineteenth-century artists and viewers alike valued accuracy in their pictures. Artist-historian William Dunlap wrote that, "If the historian or the graphic historiographer' cannot tell the whole truth, he must not at least violate the known truth," and a writer for Graham's Magazine conclud ed in 1843 that, "To falsify the truth of his tory in paintings is no less a crime, if willful, no less proof of total incapacity, if acciden tal, in an artist, than the same defects would be in a writer." The fact that the viewer can easily interpret the events of these battles by referring to Kendalls text only adds to their credibility and makes them appear to be a straightforward and comprehensive effort to instruct the viewer as to the actual events themselves. Indeed, according to the Knick erbocker, the "strongest testimony to the cor rectness of the position of the troops when in 'battle-array'" came from the "participa tors in the bloody conflicts described." Kendall no doubt influenced Nebel to paint seemingly forthright pictures that de picted pivotal moments in the battles, and he immediately set out to convince the reader of the artist's accuracy. He pointed out that "the greater number [of pictures] were drawn on the spot by the artist. So far as regards the general configuration of the ground, fidelity of the landscape, and correctness of the works and buildings in troduced, they may be strictly relied upon." Concerned that his own inexperience with military terms and procedures might be evi dent, he claimed that "every attention has certainly been paid to costume" and that his research was based on firsthand experience as well as the official reports and memoirs of various field commanders. Finally, he reminded the reader of the "impossibility, in painting a battle scene, of giving more than one feature or principal incident of the strife." He might well have noted the warn ing that the exasperated editor of the North American—a newspaper published in Mex ico City during the American occupation— had offered to those who might get carried away with the ability of artists to capture the ultimate truth about an event. Following a prolonged debate over the roles of Generals Gideon Pillow and John Quitman as shown in one of artist James Walker's paintings of the attack on Chapúltepec, the editor urged that "these good people understand that we described a picture—not a battle" Two recent books have called attention to other aspects of Nebel's work. In Las lito grafías de Karl Nebel: Version estética de la invasion norteamericana, 1846-1848 (2004), José Luis Juárez López documented Nebel's affinity with the Romantics in such ele ments as the characterization of heroes and hero types in the tiny details of each print and in the accurate depiction of natural el ements—palms, cacti, landscapes—in each of the scenes. A writer for the New Orleans Delta agreed: "I have never been to Mexico, but the peculiarity of the light, and the gor geous coloring of the vegetation, forcibly re minded me of some oriental scenes, whose beauty both poets and painters have delight ed to dwell upon." The "glowing, yet mellow light" imbued "even the rudest objects" with a "warm, dreamy hue," he concluded. Both Juárez's book and Fabiola Garcia Rubio's La entrada de las tropas estadunidenses a la ciudad de México: La mirada de Cari Nebel (2002) point out that the famous scene of Genl. Scott's Entrance into Mexico—based on Nebel's 1834 composition (published in 1836), Plaza Mayor de México—is, more or less, the personification of the American vision of Manifest Destiny. This interpre tation is confirmed by the large American flag being hoisted over the National Palace and by General Scott's symbolic meeting with General Quitman in the image's cen ter-right, as if to invest Quitman with his new responsibility as governor of the city. Both authors also call attention to the ap parent resistance of several of the Mexicans depicted on the left-hand side of the print, from the lépero bending to pick up a pav ing stone to those armed with rifles on the roof of the building. Kendall's and Nebel's book was a mas terpiece of printing and typography. The success of Lemercier's experimentation is apparent in the sophisticated lithographs that he produced based on Nebel's paint ings, all ranging in composition size from 10 13/i6 to 11 V8 inches high and 16 7li6 to 16 15/i6 inches wide. The illustrations for this "magnificent work," said the Montgomery Advertiser, "should be more properly called splendid paintings" than prints. And the ed itor was not far wrong. Close examination of the prints suggests that Lemercier printed the essential elements of the picture in only two colors—black and grayish sepia—and that he carefully and delicately manipulated the black to make it appear in various tones, from dark to light. The outlines of the fig ures, equipment and other prominent ob jects, such as large clumps of brush or trees, have been lithographed in black. All of the other colors other than black and grayish se pia and many of the landscape features such as the mountains in the background were clearly delineated by hand. In most of the prints, Lemercier litho graphed the battle and scenery in black. He printed the grayish-sepia tone over the en tire plate, including the sky, then painted the sky lightly in white to fill in clouds and to distinguish the highest mountain range from the sky. In the Battle of Buena Vista, for example, the entire bottom half of the print and the mountains on the left two-thirds of the composition were lithographed in black and sepia. The tonal definitions from the plateau to the first range of mountains and then to the highest peaks are in the litho graph rather than the coloring. The sky and the mountains on the right were created by first painting the sky with white to outline the mountains; all the other colors were added by hand. The Battle of Palo Alto, Cap ture of Monterey, both Molino del Rey prints and The Assault of Contreras feature similar mountains, made from painting the gray-se pia color with white. Both Iztaccihuatl and Popocatépetl were created in this manner in Molino del Rey—Attack upon the Molino. Capture of Monterey contains a hand-paint - ed mountain at the far right. A close exami nation of some copies of the Battle of Buena Vista reveals at least three different shades of brown, one painted on top of the other in the foreground in some instances. The intricate figures have been carefully detailed, with solid swatches of color sometimes completing the drawing; touches of pig ment are apparent throughout the composi tion. Darker colored areas of the print have been varnished to intensify and protect the rich color. Lemercier's ability to print tones greatly aided the colorists' work, but in the end, the success of these images is due to the masterful and painterly coloring that Kend all demanded. 79</page><page sequence="16">The variation in the hand-coloring is most obvious in the print of Genl. Scott's Entrance into Mexico. Some versions have thin, windblown clouds in the sky, while the clouds in others are large and puffy. In another instance, the mountains in the backgrounds of some copies of Molino del Rey—Attack upon the Casa Mata are quite beautifully layered, suggesting foothills that lead up to the larger mountains in the background, while in others the mountains have been painted in a much less detailed and careful manner. All of the prints seem to bear Nebel's and Bayot's names; some of them are also labeled "Imp. Lemercier r. de Seine 57 Paris" in the lower center, and many also bear a U.S. copyright notice within the image, either in a line of type or an arrange ment of type within an oval ring. The French typography used for the text is equal to the illustrations. The editor of the Mobile Advertiser wrote that the book was "simply as a masterpiece in the typographical art [...] clear and graceful type, impressed upon the fair and Vellum-like expanse of the page." Nor did the reviewers overlook Kendall's text. "The literary part of the work, comprising very careful and particular ac counts of these events, is excellently writ ten—so compactly and perspicuously, with so thorough a knowledge and so pure a taste, as to be deserving of applause among models in military history," the editor of The International Magazine commented. The critic for the Mobile Advertiser concluded, "The first impression on beholding this book is expressed by the word grandeur, as aca demically applied to works of art and com position of the severer kinds." Kendall published a prospectus for the book, which he and Appleton &amp; Company apparently sent to newspapers and book stores throughout the country He pur chased advertising and successfully promot ed the book by showing advance copies to his many friends who were editors around the country. In a society that is constantly bom barded by images, it is difficult to imagine the excitement that accompanied the pub lication of such a spectacular set of hand colored pictures. Some early subscribers placed their books on public display as soon as they received them. Others took them to local newspaper offices to show the editors or simply wrote letters to the editors. Sometimes retailers like Little &amp; Brown in Boston brought the book to the SO attention of reviewers, and in at least one instance—that of the San Antonio Ledger— the editor wrote a positive review based on the recommendation of a friend who had seen the book at the Picayune office in New Orleans. Some criticized Kendall for pro ducing the book abroad, but the Daily Na tional Intelligencer in Washington, D.C. de fended him against this "unintelligent and narrow criticism," claiming that while the United States had native artists capable of such work, there were not enough of them to produce the desired number of copies. The editor of the Intelligencer conveniently neglected to mention that the large major ity of American lithographers were Euro pean immigrants. In many ways, Kendall's and Nebel's work was the perfect combination of jour nalism, history and art, and reached a large audience because it personified the mood of the country. It was truly deserving of the ep ithet bestowed by "Acorn," a correspondent for the Boston Atlas, who called it a "great national work." Bibliographic Curiosity Roberto Mayer All the illustrations from the album Vi aje pintoresco y arqueológico por la República Mexicana (1829-1834) that have been reproduced in this issue of Artes de México were taken from an out-of-series copy without a cover, title page, text or colo phon, and with a handwritten list of illus trations. The binding is similar to the one used for the Mexican edition, and it bears the title Viaje pintoresco de Méjico de Carlos Nebel in gold. The album was first published in Paris in 1836 under the title Voyage pit toresque et archéologique dans la partie la plus intéressante du Mexique, and there ex ists a great deal of bibliographic confusion around it due to the fact that there are so few known copies in existence (only three made it to the auction block between the years 1975 and 2003) and because it has been frequently plagiarized. There are cer tain differences between the plates in the copy we have used and the ones that appear in the facsimile album published by the Manuel Porrúa Bookstore in 1963 (with an introduction by Justino Fernández), which was based on an 1839 copy of the Mexican edition (though some other copies bear the date 1840). There are also variations in the descriptions that appear in an 1839 copy owned by the Bank of Mexico, as mentioned in the book Imágenes de México: Colección de grabados y litografías del Banco de México. Briefly, there are discrepancies in the lithog rapher's and printer's names, in the number of colored plates, and in the dates on plates in the above copies and those described in other bibliographies, such as those of Sabin, Palau, Lipperheide, Bernal, Brunet, Colds and the Porrúa-Robredo catalogue. There are two major differences between the copy we used and other ones: first, our album in cludes the plate entitled Mexico City as Seen from the Archbishopric of Tacubaya, which does not appear in other copies, where it is replaced by Papantla: A Totonac Indian Vil lage, thus completing the fifty lithographs that the album was supposed to contain. The second difference is the way the human figures and the horse are positioned in the plate entitled Rancheros, among many other details. The only way to determine where our copy should appear in the bibliographic sequence would be to compare it to different copies of the Parisian and Mexican editions. This would be a difficult and costly task, and would require paying visits to libraries in many countries or acquiring photographs of each plate in the different copies in their possession. There are any number of expla nations for the unusual composition of our copy of the album: Nebel may have brought the loose plates over from Europe in hopes of finding a Mexican lithographer to repro duce them here, and not finding one, had them bound into a volume, or they may have been artist's proofs that Nebel was car rying in his baggage and finally had bound in Mexico. There is no way of knowing. A few words about Nebel's positive points: His body of work featured an artistic presenta tion based on precise data that is of great documentary value, and incorporated the technical advances of the lithographers that he employed. Some of the archaeological sites had never been drawn before, including El Tajin. And European readers were able to see views of some Mexican cities for the first time. His illustrations of costumes and cus toms among different social groups and re gions of the country are very important. All these aspects explain why the images were copied so many times and for so many years, generally without assigning credit. Translated by Michelle Suderman. Roberto Mayer</page></plain_text>
