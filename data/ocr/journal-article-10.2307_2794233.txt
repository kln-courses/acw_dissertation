MAN, I957, I78 SIR,-Dr. Needham's review of my De Kutnst van 247 Nieuw Guinea shows that writing a fair review is some- times beyond the power of otherwise capable scholars. Dr. Needham fails to indicate that my book is popular in character; it is intended for the layman and for scholars whose i87</page><page sequence="2">Nos. 247-252 MAN DECEMBER, 1957 knowledge lies in other fields. The facts that it is written in Dutch for the Dutch public and that most of the examples are t-aken from the collections of the Leiden Museum explain the emphasis on the stylistic areas of western New Guinea. It is regrettable that the reviewer did not note that this ground is not covered in Linton anld Wingert's Arts of the South Seas. It is because of its popular character that the book is without exact references to the literature of whiclh I made use. This would have beenl a grave omission had the work beeni written for scientific use by anthropologists. That I realize the importance of references would have been clear to Dr. Needhamii if he had looked at my paper on the ceremonial clubs of the Marind Anim (MAN, 1952, 139). Here, writing for a scientific public, I analysed certain art forms of the Marind Aniim in relation to the social functions of the objects givinig expression to them. Finally I suggested a possible derivation of the figure in the openwork blade of a ceremonial club (hayam) fromn an anthropomorphic three-dimensional figure (ahat dema). This hypothesis, however, is not mentionied in my book, where the signiificance of the ornamentation of hayam blades is described merely as 'Inot clear' (p. 107). This should be sufficienit for the lay- man or noni-specialist scholarly reader, who could be conifused by uinproved hypotheses. This explains why other aspects mentioned by Dr. Needhain have not been dealt with: for example the interpretationi of the prominenit Sepik nose. Such a treatment would involve a nlumber of hypotheses. One-the possible relation of the beak-like nose to the belief in a soul-bird-was mentioned by the reviewer. But such a discussion could not omit referenlce to Speiser's theory of the derivation of the nose from the trunk of the Indian Ganesha, anld colisequelitly I would have had to discuss and criticize the methods of the kulturhistorische school, which would have been far beyond the scope of the book. To summarize, I deliberately kept within the bounlds set by the type of public at which I aimed. Dr. Needham seems to suggest that I am not illterested in questionis of the type he mentionls. The contrary is true. To discuss onle of the points he raises: it seems to me tllat to describe Leach's discussion of the Trobriand shields (MAN, 1954, i58) as elucidatinlg the msthetic mechallics of an art form necessarily implies a purely msthetic alid highly personal approach which, from a scientific viewpoint, is hazardous. To the criticism of the illustrations of my book my answer is that out of i6 reviews not one has commenited unfavourably on the work of C. Zwanenburg and J. van der Post, responsible respectively for the photographs anld the drawings. For readers of MAN who may have 1lo opportunity to form a personal judgment mnay I quote Mr. H. D. Gunn, reviewing my book in the Americani Anthropologist (Vol. LVIII, Part 4, p. 767), who describes the photographs as 'very fine' and expresses the view that these and the 'characterful draw- ings' conlstitute a 'very solid virtue of this book.' At the end of his review Dr. Needham expresses the hope that all ethnographer from the newly investigated highlands will bring us some true ilisight ilito New Guinea art.' As I am very interested in this subject I hope so too. I also hope that Dr. Needham has remembered that the highland area as a whole is very poor in material culture and that art is almost entirely lacking, aiid that lie realizes that though an ethinographer may provide valuable informa- tion o01 the art of a particular area he will almost certainly fail to deal satisfactorily with more general problems of primitive art unless he has specialized in this field.
