ATHAR ALI Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh As is well known, Islam arose in Arabia, which, alongside the pagan Communities, had a large number of tribes and groups which pro- fessed Judaism and Christianity. So far as we know, the relations between the Jews and Christians and their Arab neighbours in pre- Islamic times were cordial, or were not at any rate adversely affected by differences of faith. In its self-view Islam represented both a con- tinuation and a supersession of the two earlier Semitic faiths. The Jewish Gospel as well as the New Testament had originally repres- ented divine messages, and so those who follow them were 'People of the Book', to be distinguished from the 'Infidels'. But the Gospel texts, the Quran itself had claimed, had suffered from unauthorized deletions and insertions; and this claim, of course, created a funda- mental point of disagreement between the Muslims, on the one hand, and the Jews and Christians on the other. Nonetheless, early Muslims seemed fairly well familiar with both the earlier Semitic religions. Among the learned the familiarity would last longer and be pre- served in areas where Jews and Christians would not be encountered. Al-Biruni completed his work Kitab-al Hind, c. 1035, in Ghazanavide Panjab; yet his knowledge ofJewish and Christian precepts and prac- tices seems considerable. It is possible that some of this knowledge came from the work of al-Iranshahri, a Persian writer in Arabic, which has not survived.' Al-Biruni well knew the Jewish custom of levirate,2 and shows familiarity with how the Jews represented God: Similar to this [Hindu Om] is the manner in which the Jews write the name of God, viz., by three Hebrew Yods. In the (Torah) the word is written YHVH and pronounced Adonai; sometimes they also say Yah. The word Adonai which they pronounced is not expressed in writing.3 ' Alberuni's India, tr. E.C.

ATHAR ALI As this statement shows, al-Biruni had access to the text of the Old Testament, for he refers to both the Jewish and Christian Gos- pels being in Hebrew and Syriac. Presumably using Arabic transla- tions from Syriac, he shows considerable familiarity with the uses of the word 'Eloah' in Hebrew used for God as well as a god, quoting from Gen., vi/.4; Job i.6; Exod. vii. 1; and Psalms, lxxxii.4 Similarly, he cites 'the 2nd Book of Kings' about the loss of David's son borne by Uriah's wife and God's promise of another son to him whom he would 'adopt as his own son'-this from I, Chron. xxii.9, 1O.5 Of the Christian gospel, al-Biruni shows equal if not greater grasp. He argues that, unlike Arabic, the language of the New Testament has a looser meaning attached to the words 'father' and 'son'. 'By the son [of God] they (the Christians) understand most especially Jesus, but apply it also to others besides him'. He tellingly quotes the prayer, 'O our father which art in Heaven' in St. Matt. vi, 9; and Jesus's promise that he was going to 'his father and to their father', found in St. John, xx, 17.6 He considers Trinity to be not inconsistent with monotheism, for he says that the Christians 'distinguish' between the Three Persons and give them separate names, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, but unite them into one substance.' Elsewhere he shows familiarity with the ranks of the Church, speaking of the bishops, metropolitans, catholici and patriarchs, and of the lower clergy, viz. presbyter and deacon.8 Presumably, he knew more of the Eastern than of the Roman Church, for he never mentions the Pope. Al-Biruni admired the Christian doctrine of non-violence as enshrined in the New Testament: 'to offer to him who has beaten your cheek the other cheek, also to bless your enemy and pray for him. Upon my life, this is a noble philosophy'. But he realized that in practice it has been otherwise: 'ever since Constantine the Victorious became a Christian both sword and whip have ever been employed, for without them it would be impossible to rule'.9 Al-Biruni's admira- tion for Christ's message shows also in a passage in his preface: The Messiah expresses himself in the Gospel to this effect: 'Do not mind the fury of Kings in speaking the truth before them. They only possess your body, but they have no power over your soul'. (Cf. St. Matt. X, 18, 19, 28; Ibid., pp. 36-8. 5 Ibid., p. 38. 6 Ibid., p. 38. Ibid., p. 94- 8 Ibid., II, p. 15. 9 Ibid., p. 161.</page><page sequence="3">JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY IN MEDIEVAL INDIA 245 St. Luke, xii, 4). In these words the Messiah orders us to exercise moral courage.10 It seems from these passages that, besides reliance on the transla- tions of the Gospel and al-Iranshahri, al-Biruni had some contacts with the Jewish and Christian communities in Central Asia, although he nowhere directly refers to them. But soon after him, at least in Northern India, the Jews and Christians alike seem to have become distant entities, heard of in anecdotes or to be mentioned in hypo- thetical or rhetorical contexts, though the references themselves are not unfriendly. On 9 November 1317, the Sufi saint Shaikh Nizamuddin, while declining to ask a Hindu to convert to Islam, related this anecdote about Khwaja Bayazid Bustami, the great Sufi saint: A Jew had a house near that of Khwaja Bayazid Bustani. When Khwaja Bayazid died, people asked the Jew, 'why do not you become a Muslim?' The Jew replied: 'What kind of Muslim should I be? If Islam is what Bayazid followed, I am not equal to following it; if it is what you follow, then I am repelled by such Islam!'" When Nizamuddin himself died, it was claimed in verse that 'Mus- lims, Hindus, Christians ('Tarsa') and Magians crowned their heads with the dust of the door of his tomb'." This is surely rhetoric, in so far as the Christians and the Magi are concerned. There is no evidence that there was any community of Christians settled at Delhi in the 14th century. II The living relationship with Christianity (if not immediately with Judaism as well) was re-established with the arrival in strength of the Portuguese following Vasco da Gama's voyage terminating at Calicut in 1498. It is not surprising that it was now the Catholic version of Christianity which Muslims in India began mainly to encounter. On 21 June 1578 there arrived at Akbar's Court a Portu- guese (firangi), who was a merchant in Bengal, PRTB TAR (?) by name, accompanied by his wife FSHURNA (?), and he introduced to 10o Ibid., pp. 4-5- " Amir Hasan Sijzi, Fawa'idu'l Fawad, ed.

ATHAR ALI Akbar the practice of monogamy that the Christian laity had to follow--an imposition, he said, of the celibate clergy.'3 But it was with the arrival of the first Jesuit mission in 1580 that there was a much livelier appreciation of Christianity. Unfortunately, Akbar's adviser and minister, Abu'l Fazl, who met the mission, has not left his description of Christianity or even an account of his meeting with the Jesuits in his writings." The gap is filled by 'Abdu'l Qadir Badauni, the historian and critic of both Akbar and Abu'l Fazl. Pla- cing the Jesuit arrival a year before the actual one, he sets forth the picture of Christianity that Akbar's court now obtained: There came experienced theologians from Europe (Afranja), whom they call 'Padre' (Pddharf). Their absolute legislator (Mujtahid-i Kamil), who can alter all decrees in view of circumstances of the time, and Kings too cannot defy his authority, is called the 'Pope' (Papa). They brought the Bible (injil) and gave arguments in favour of the Trinity, and proving the truth of the Christianity (nasraniyat), began to spread the Christian faith (millat-i 'isawi). His Majesty instructed Prince Murad to take some lessons from the Bible, and Shaikh Abu'l Fazl was appointed to translate it. In place of the invoca- tion 'In the name of God', this sentence occurred (in the Gospel): 'O whose name is Jesus Christ (Zhazhu Kristu)', i.e. 'O whose name is Benevolent and Bountiful' ... These accursed people brought in a description of Dajjal (Anti-Christ) and applied his attributes to our Prophet, peace be on him, the very opposite of all Dajjals.'5 It may be observed in passing that there must have been much interest at this time at Akbar's court in the Pope's authority to 'alter all decrees' of religion in his capacity as Mujtahid-i Kamil, the legal 'innovator' with absolute authority, because a more limited role as legislator in Islamic matters had been sought for Akbar himself through the theologians' declaration (mahzar) of 1579;16 and Abu'l Fazl had argued that had the great jurist Abu Hanifa been alive now, he would have authored a different system of law."7 In any case the firstJesuit mission ignited some interest in the Bible at the court. 13 Akbarnama, Bib.

In a letter dated 14 April 1582, carried by his envoy Sayyid Muzaffar Khan to Goa, Akbar wrote (Abu'l Fazl's draft) to 'the scholars of Europe' (danayan-ifirang), the Emperor not only asked for a scholar to be sent to him to explain the tenets of Christianity, but went on to add: It has reached our august ear that divine books like the Torah, the Gospel (Injil) and the Psalms (Zabur) have been rendered into the Arabic and Per- sian languages; if these books, so translated or not, from which general benefit would follow, are available in that country, these may be sent to US.18 Unfortunately our sources do not indicate any tangible con- sequences of this curiosity regarding Christianity during the time of Akbar and Jahangir. References to Christian practices or beliefs remain casual or incidental. In his book on ethics, Badauni mentions Christian writings on ethics, but gives no title;"9 elsewhere he recalls from his personal knowledge that the Christians and Jews, like Hindus, not only regard music as permissible, but consider it a part of worship.20 This is a little more specific evidence of actual observa- tion of Christian (and Jewish) practices, but hardly denotes penetration. IH The lack of interest in Christian theology of the Mughal court, if one goes by what came to be written in Persian, rather than by Mughal painting, which in its later phase has distinct traces of Christian influence both in its themes and its symbolisms," is surprising. This indifference was not shared by a man, however, who appears to have devoted his life to an unbiased collection of data about diverse reli- gions. For reasons not known, he conceals his name from us in his book, the Dabistan-i Mazahib ('School of Religions').22 But Azad Bil- 18 Insha'i Abdul Fazl, Nawal Kishore, 1280/1864, pp. 37-9- '9 Nijatur'Rashid, ed.

ATHAR ALI grami gives his name as Mirza Zulfigar with the pen name Mobad;23 and the latter, indeed, appears in the Dabistan. His autobiographical details in the book are consistent with his being of an Iranian descent with Parsi connections.24 The author refers to 1645-46 as the cur- rent year at one place;25" later dates occur in the text, the last trace- able date being 1653,26 when he was in the Golkunda Kingdom, though most of his life was spent in various parts within the Mughal Empire. In the Dabistan-i Mazahib there is a full chapter on Judaism.27 The author says he had been unable to meet any follower of that religion; but in 1647, he came to Haiderabad, capital of the Golkunda King- dom, where he met the famous Muhammad Sa'id 'Sarmad'.28 Pre- sumably, from what Sarmad told him, he writes that Sarmad belonged to 'a family of the Jewish learned, of the class whom they call Rabbis (arbanniyun), after obtaining knowledge of the beliefs of the Rabbis and reading the Torah, he became a Muslim, and studied the sciences while attending upon some of the Iranian scholars'. Coming to India, he turned a mystic and attached to himself a young Hindu boy of Thatta, Abhay Chand, whom he taught the Torah, the Psalms and other texts.29 It was from Sarmad and Abhay Chand that the author's information about Judaism came. The authenticity of this information can fortunately be checked by a means that Abhay Chand has provided for us through the Dabis- tan. At the request of the author he translated 'a small portion of the Torah' from the original Hebrew into Persian, 'Mobad' had this translation closely checked by Sarmad, and then put this 'story of Adam' in his book verbatim.30 It turns out to be the opening portion of Genesis, with which the Old Testament begins, Abhay Chand's translation running from the beginning of Genesis to Genesis vi, 8. The accuracy and completeness of the Persian translation is admir- able, every sentence and clause of Genesis i-vi. 8, being present, the placing of words in the Persian text making it obvious that a literal 23 'Ma'asiru'l Kiram, I (Hyderabad Dn., 1910), p. 22. 24 See esp.

Comparing it with the Revised Version, one finds the Abhay Chand translation more convincing at many points. Thus, for example, where Abhay Chand translates: 'and God's wind used to blow over the face of the water', the R.V. Genesis i.2, has: 'and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water'. Or again, upon Caen's appeal to God, 'And God said unto Caen (Qabil), "But who- ever Killeth Caen shall have Chastisement visited upon him upto seven generations"' (Abhay Chand); the corresponding words in R.V. Genesis iv, 15 are: 'And the Lord said unto him: "therefore whoso- ever slayeth Caen, vengence shall be taken from him sevenfold"'. 'Wind' for 'Spirit', 'seven generations' for 'sevenfold', appear clearly to be better choices. Abhay Chand, a poet in Persian himself,31 natur- ally uses the Arabicised forms of Biblical names, just as the R.V. uses the English forms. But all the names of Adam's descendants with the precise ages assigned to them, are exactly given without any slip whatsoever. We should therefore be left in no doubt that Sarmad and Abhay Chand knew Hebrew, had the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) with them and were closely acquainted with its contents. Sarmad was, therefore, being truthful when he claimed a rabbanic past. The Jewish creed, according to Sarmad, was as follows: 1. God has a physical existence, and resembles man, who is created in his image; and some times he diffuses like rays [throughout the creation]. 2. In the Torah and Psalms it is stated that the Soul has an invisible (lit, light, latij) body, existing in the human frame, the body of the senses. 3. The reward and punishment of the Last Day is in this creation. Suppose a person lives for 120 years: this constitutes one 'day'. Upon his death it becomes 'night'. Then all the elements of his body scatter; after some 120 years pass, they assemble again to put life into the same person (Cf. Dan. xii, 2). Another 'day' begins-and so the cycle goes on. 4. All elements that exist are found in the human body. 5. The Jews deny the prophethood of Christ and say he was a liar. The arguments that Christians bring forth based on statements in the Torah are futile, since the statements they quote were made by Isaiah (Ish'iya) for himself, not Christ [cf. Isaiah, ix]. See also io below. 6. Abraham was not a Prophet but Wali, the Friend of God, [cf. 2 Chron. xx. 7; Rom. iv. 11] which is a higher position than that of a Prophet. 7. In the Torah there is no mention [contrary to the Quran] of the Pharoah claiming to be God. He was cruel and oppressed the Israelites, and disreg- 31 Ibid., p. 195-</page><page sequence="8">250 M. ATHAR ALI arded Moses's admonitions; it was for this that he was chastised [Cf. Ex.xiv]. 8. Aaron (Harun) was not a partner in the Prophethood of Moses, but was his khalifa (spokesman or successor) [cf. Ex. iv, 14-16; Num. xii, xvii, xviii; xx: Dieut. x. 6]. 9. David sent Uriah to his death, because he was desirous of his wife, from whom he begat Solomon [2 Sam. xi, xii, 1 Chron. iii. 5. there is silence in the Quran on this matter]. io. Christ was not a Prophet. The words 'They broke my hands, and legs, and counted my bones' [cf. Psalms, xxxv, 15, 16 and c], which Christians cite as referring to Christ, were spoken by David for himself. 11. In the Torah it is said that if the Israelites commit evil deeds, inevitably Muhammad would come. Sarmad said that although the name of the Prophet is found in the Torah, it is in a context which suggests another meaning. Even if it is taken as the name of the Prophet, it is a warning to Bani Israel not to join his faith (cf. Ezek, xxxviii). 'On this he spoke with much insistence'. 12. No outsider can enter the religion of the Jews. The circumcision pre- scribed by the law of their Prophet applies to them alone. 13. A Prophet is to be present and alive at all times to put into effect the law of the Torah.32 It is obvious that points 5-11 belong to one class, where Sarmad points outJewish objections to Christian and Muslim interpretations of certain passages of the Old Testament or to the Muslim version of the Biblical tradition. He obviously had access to the Hebrew scrip- tures, even though, as in point lo, he may not have been literally quoting from the Bible. But the other points in which Sarmad repres- ents Jewish Rabbanic beliefs require a commentary. On the perception of God, one may not fault Sarmad for inaccur- acy. If 'God created man in his own image; in the image of God created He him' (Genesis i. 27; Abhay Chand has also translated this portion), then an anthropomorphic conception of God must follow. This has to be reconciled with the universal presence of God and his absolute power; and so the formulation of Jewish faith in point No. 1 seems unexceptionable. So also the concept of the Soul (No. 2). But point 3 is totally against the Rabbanic theology of the Day of Judgement. The soul remains suspended after death, until the dead are aroused at the Day ofJudgement. Dan. xii. 2 describes the Day ofJudgement rather than any reawakening by a physical assemblage of elements of the previous body in this life. Sarmad's representation of Judaism seems to encompass the soul's temporary suspension 32 Ibid., pp. 195-6.</page><page sequence="9">JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY IN MEDIEVAL INDIA 251 ('sleep') after death, but not the concept of Day of Judgement-a basic idea that has been so strongly inherited by Christianity and Islam from Judaism. In fact, Sarmad seems to attribute to Judaism something very akin to the Nuqtawi view of coming together of the scattered elements of the dead physical frames in new bodies with the same or even merged souls."3 One can, therefore, suggest that either the Jews in Iran had developed a heretical doctrine paralleling that of the Nuqtavis, or that Sarmad, being personally impressed by the latter, was reading into the Jewish creed something which was not there. It is significant that Sarmad knew that Judaism was not a proselyt- izing religion and had no room for outsiders (Point 12). As for the necessity of the Prophets (Point 13), it must be assumed that Sarmad had in his mind the successive generations of biblical Prophets and the indispensability of their missions at that time; it is difficult to imagine him saying that the Jews had a Prophet living currently among them as well. IV The Dabistan-i Mazahib has a Chapter on Christianity34 immediately following upon the one on Judaism. The account is far more self- confident than the previous one. The author tells us that he met some of the Christian learned; and that his information was espe- cially derived from 'a French Padre (Padri-ifransai), whom the people from Portugal and Goa, who are in India and the Port of Surat, hold in high regard and whom the author met at the Port of Surat in 1057 A.H. (A.D. 1647)'. The Chapter which follows is divided into three portions: (1) Christ; (2) Beliefs of Christians; and (3) Practices of Christians. It becomes immediately apparent that the Dabistan's account is entirely and genuinely derived from a detailed and accurate Roman Catholic transmission and is nowhere in the slightest influenced by the traditional Muslim beliefs about Christians or by the Quranic narrative as against the Biblical one. The account of Christ begins by giving the date of his birth in terms the usual Christian calcula- 3 A good exposition of the Nuqtawi theory is given in the Dabistan-i Mazahib itself, PP. 343-7- 34 Dabistan-i Mazahib, pp. 202-8.</page><page sequence="10">252 M. ATHAR ALI tions from the Bible (31,909 years from Creation; 2,957 from Noah's flood; 752 years from the foundation of Rome; and 42 years from the accession of [Augustus] Caesar, which suit the traditional date of the founding of Rome (B.c. 753) and the actual date of Augustus' seizure of power after the death ofJulius Caesar (B.C. 44). It goes on to say that the virgin birth of Christ was predicted by Isaiah, the father of David in these words. 'From Isaiah's seed a branch springs forth; a flower blooms forth in that branch, within which [flower] the spirit of God settles. A virgin eats the fruit and bears a son'.35 Per- haps, this is a reference to Isaiah XI, 1-2, though the reference to the virgin does not occur there."6 It goes on to describe the crucifixion of Christ by consent of Pontius Pilate ('Filatas') upon the insistence of the Jews, though Pilate himself washed his hands of the deed. But the Jews took the responsibility, which burden they still bear37-the standard basis of Christian anti-Semitism. The author goes on to tell us that three pictures were made of the blood-stained Jesus on the cross, one kept at the city of Shahin (?) in Portugal, displayed twice every year; one at Milan in Italy; and another at Rome.38 This information again suggests close familiarity with Catholic pilgrim- places in Europe, on the part of the author's informant. Coming to Christian beliefs, the author puts the first one as belief in Christ being filius ('filyus', carefully spelt letter-by-letter with vowels written out), that is, the Son of God. He then classifies the basic Christian beliefs into those that relate to the Divinity of Christ, and those that relate to the person of Christ. He carefully spells out the word Deus (Diyos) for God, and sets out the belief in him as Creator, the Giver of Paradise, the Source of Peace, the Father of Christ. There is also the specific belief in the Holy Spirit (Ruh-i Pak, the pure Spirit), which, with God and Christ, completes the Trinity. The second set of beliefs relates to Christ being the Son of God coming from the womb of Virgin Mary ('Mariam') through the Holy Spirit (ruhu'l quds); to Christ mounting the cross for our salvation, dying and being buried; to Christ's coming being foretold by the earlier Prophets; to his resurrection and the ascension on the third day of his crucifixion; and to his appearance on the Day ofJudgement 35 Ibid., p. 202. 36 'And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock ofJesse, and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him', etc. (Revised Version). 37 Dabistan-i Mazahib, pp. 202-3. 38 Ibid., p. 203.</page><page sequence="11">JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY IN MEDIEVAL INDIA 253 to judge 'the living and the dead'. The Christians' belief is quoted that the Trinity really constitutes One; and the Son of God came to die for the salvation of man. This statement with numbered beliefs39 is obviously based on the Nicene Creed, as finally framed (the Nica- eno Constantinopolitan creed, 381), with some necessary elabora- tions and explanations.40 The statement of the Central creed is followed by the description of the four places where the dead souls go to: Hell, Purgatory ('Parkatori'/'Pargatori'); 'Leno', for those who die young; and Para- dise. The Christian belief that on the Day of Judgement souls will unite with their bodies is also noted.41 The third portion deals with the morals, rituals and practices of the Christians. It mentions the Sunday sermons and the mass as well as the confession (Kanfiya) which must be offered once a year. It mentions the sacraments ('Sakarmaint'), including payment of tithe, confirmation ('konfarmashayo'), eucharist ('Senokrista'), penitence ('panitanshia'), extreme unction ('astrima onshia'), marriage ('matrimonia'), etc.42 The Pope is also mentioned: 'The successor of Christ they call Pope ('Pap'); and it is settled that he does not lead anyone to error, since Lord Christ in the Holy Bible has given him some pledges'.43 After further details of Christian beliefs and practices, all on the basis of Catholic teaching, the author ends by saying that 'the Bible (New Testament) in the language of Christ has been rendered into many languages such as Hebrew, Greek, Latin-which is the lan- guage of the learned of Europe-and Syriac; and all of these they regard as the Word of God'.44 As already noted, Christianity is portrayed here in its Catholic garb only, and no hint is offered of the Reformation which had torn Christianity for well over a century and a quarter. Not only are the propositions of Protestantism (varied as they were) ignored, but the very existence of Protestantism side-stepped. Clearly Mobad's French Padre either did not regard Protestants as Christians or did not wish to confuse matters by referring to their heresies. Apparently 39 Ibid., pp. 203-4. 40 See the translation of the creed in Henry Bettenson, Documents of the Christian Church (London, 1954), PP- 36-7. 41 Dabistan-i Mazahib, p. 204. 42 Ibid., pp. 205-6. 43 Ibid., p. 206. 44 Ibid., p. 208.</page><page sequence="12">254 M. ATHAR ALI too Mobad did not meet any Dutch of English merchant or clergy- man sufficiently interested in transmitting his beliefs to him. In his account of both Judaism and Christianity, Mobad's clinical neutrality is striking. Not for him the usual Muslim declamations of disapproval when one is obliged to quote or describe something against the traditions or creed of Islam. This attitude he maintains throughout his book, especially while reproducing arguments of votaries of one religion against those of another, as in the long sec- tion, 'Account of Debate between Religions'.45 Here, for instance, he represents the Christian winning in the debate with the Muslim, over the authenticity of the Bible. If the Bible has undergone altera- tions, as the Muslims allege, then the latter should be able to pro- duce the true text of the Bible, just as the Christians have the true text of the Old Testament ('Torah') which they share with the Jews, besides having their own Injil, or New Testament. The Christian similarly succeeded in showing that Prophet Muhammad's miracle of breaking the moon in twain could not have taken place. But the Jews brought arguments to prove that the virginity of Mary was dis- putable, and that the crucifixion of Christ was not predicted in the Psalms of David.46 We have here, therefore, impartiality of a very high order, for which there can surely be found few parallels both in the Islamic and Christian worlds of the seventeenth century. V So far as we can find, the Dabistan-i Mazahib (1553) had no successor; and surprisingly little intellectual curiosity is displayed in the Indo- Muslim literature during the succeeding hundred years in the reli- gion of the Europeans. Christianity was tolerated but not studied: it was almost the same story as with European technological appli- ances, they were used, but not, but for rare exceptions, reproduced. There was apparently no perception that Christianity was a challen- ging religion, so that Muslims should have need for studying it in order to controvert it. In other words, they lacked the motive which led so many Christian missionaries to study Islam and Hinduism. The indifference exhibited towards Christianity was not then a prod- uct of enmity; it was a product of a belief in co-existence, taking the 45 Ibid., pp. 254-68. 46 Ibid., p. 258.</page><page sequence="13">JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY IN MEDIEVAL INDIA 255 Quranic verse, 'To you your religion, to me mine' in the most literal sense. It is interesting that Bernier (1667) attributes such a notion to the Brahmans as well: 'I found it impossible to convince them that the Christian faith was designed for the whole earth'.47 With this comfortable vision, it was possible to look into one's own faith alone, and not polemicize with others. It is, then, a disturbing thought that tolerance could also generate inertia, which, on the other hand, was such a stranger to the actively proselytizing, intolerant True Apo- stolic Church of Rome. 47 Fran;ois Bernier, Travels in the Mogul Empire, tr.
