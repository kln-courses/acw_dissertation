Hindu Astrology Conclusion The author wishes to express his indebtedness to Mr. Chandra Shekhar Awasthi who had taught him philosophy years ago, and who has ever been a constant source of encouragement to him. Mr. Awasthi has seen the manuscript through, and has benefited the author with his sound suggestions. To Dr. Biswanath Bhattacharya the author owes another one third of his indebted- ness. The author has fruitfully discussed with him the Samskrita hymns only to dig out their apt connotations, besides discussions on the Täntrika liturgy and its metaphysical base. Dr. Bhattacharya has further generously offered to check the transliteration part. Pandita Lakámí Nãrãyana Dvivedï, Nyãyãcãrya, has offered his valued guidance to the author in the initial stage of writing this paper, for which he expresses his thanks to the learned Pandita.</page><page sequence="2">The Trichotomous Theme : A Ritual Category in Hindu Culture 949 Trichotomy: Its Pervasive Nature and Antiquity The recurrent trichotomous theme forms an almost basic "ritual category" in Hindu culture insofar as it pervades all Hindu metaphysical thought relating to the obstinate questionings about cosmos, life and death. Unlike its counter- part in American culture where the Number Three has been treated as a "folk category" (Dundes 1968: 401-^-24), the theme has to be regarded as an "elite category" in Hindu culture, for in nearly every branch of learning, it constitutes the subtle under-current of thought. Tracing the course of evolution of the theme and its pervasive impact on Hindu metaphysical thought and ritualism, its origin can be found in the Vedic period, for its antiquity is co-terminous with Vedic Hinduism. As such, the theme is a great traditional element that constitutes one of the fundamental tenets of classical Hinduism. The Vedas are believed to be revelations - self-inspired, self-revealing, omniscient and eternal. They need no human or superhuman ingenuity »for their coming into being. They are eternal because they originate from speech (vãk) that is indestructible *. The vãk or vãni 2 is sabda or aksara 3 that originated the Has or Vedic rituals (rtasya prathamajã), that gave birth to the Vedas (vedãnãm mata) and that is the treasure of nectar (amrtasya nãbhih). Of the different revelations the trichotomous theme {traita) forms one such fundamental revelation - an "elite category of perception and cognition". The Vedic elite who formed the "class of literati" consisted of spiritual pre- ceptors and metaphysicians (rsi), hermits and ascetics (muni), saints and sages (sãdhu) of yore. Some of them came to know of the theme through revelation as the drastã; others (their contemporaries and often their successors) devoted themselves as commentators (bhãsyakãra) and propagators through oral tradi- tion of the fundamental canons of Vedic thought only to systematically elaborate the mystic connotations of the theme in the Samhitãs, the Ãranyakas and the Upanisads during the Srauta period. In an effort to conceptualize the ultimate reality, the entire process of cognition of these Vedic seers was often abstraction-oriented and aphoristic. Such abstract thinking of early preceptors was later on translated largely into allegorical and metaphorical4 language, and was invested with legendary ι Rg.

The Purãnas thus mark the era of efflorescence of Vedic thought and ritualism or an effort toward popularization of Vedic philosophy and liturgy. The trichotomous theme, like other basic tenets of Vedic philosophy, is thus a product of downward devolution from the "elite" to the masses rather than an upward evolution from the masses to the elite. A. Vedic Thought 1. The Trichotomous Division of Vedic Literature The entire Vedic thought relating to metaphysical and liturgical beliefs follows the conventional trichotomous divisions into the Brãhmanas, the Ãranyakas and the Upanisads. The Vedas are again divided each into a number of branches (sãkhã) where each branch comprises three parts - the vijnãna (knowledge), the stuti (panegyrics) and the itihãsa (legends). As the rsi were the seers (drastã) of the Vedic mantra, so were the ãcãrya (preceptors) the seers of the Brãhmanas. Such ãcãrya formed three groups - the Mändükyagana, the Sãnkhãyanagana and the Äsvaläyanagana (Upadhyaya 1958:241). The entire Vedic religion is also pervaded by the trichotomy of the rta 6, the rca 7 and the rtvij 8. The vedatrayï is a collective appellation for the three Vedas - the Rg., the Yajus and the Sãman which emanated from the breath of the Brahman 9. The Satapatha and the Aitareya Brãhmanas, however, hold that the Rgveda was born out of Agni (fire), the Yajurveda out of Vãyu (air) and the Sãmaveda out of Sürya (the Sun) 10. 5 Such legendary element is not missing in the Vedas. However, in the Purãnas, it is largely and mainly resorted to. 6 Upadhyaya 1958 : 596 : rtam ca satyam cãbhiddhãt tapaso 'dhyajãyata (Rg. X 190.1) . - "The perennial divine truth". Rta has not only been viewed as the Divine Truth but also been identified with the Brahman; for, as a regulating principle, it maintains order in the Cosmos. 7 Apte 1912: 307. - In its strict sense, it refers to "a verse of the Rgveda" but in its general usage, it also refers to any Vedic hymn. 8 Apte 1912 : 309. - Rg.

Yãska (Upadhyaya 1958: 117), one of the oldest commentators of the Vedas, opines that their meaning is three-fold, viz. ãdhibhautika (relating to the material aspect), ädhidaivika (relating to a tutelary deity or adhideva) and ãdhyãtmika (relating to the Supreme Spirit or Self). And so is the vidyã (knowledge or wisdom) likewise trichotomised into a similar classification. Similarly, also the Sun has three forms n. The issue pertaining to the nature of ultimate reality relates to the exercises in Hindu epistemology and ontology. As such, a rich wealth of litera- ture was composed by the Vedic sages and the immediate post- Vedic scholars who were well- versed in the Vedic lore. Such literature was largely passed on from generation to generation by the sylvan preceptors through oral tradition. 2. The Mystic Sound: Om The entire cosmos was believed to be pervaded by the sound om (the Brahman as the ultimate reality) 12 that transcends the three temporal dimen- sions (bhüta, bhavat and bhavisyat) 13. All sacrificial Srauta rituals, therefore, used to be preceded by recitations of the pranava (the three-syllabled word om). The Chãndogya holds (Chã. Upa. I 1.9) that the three important priests who officiate at a sacrifice, chant the word om as the first ritual sound - the adhvaryu who recites eulogistic hymns for others' audition (ãsrãvana), the hotr (who recites the mantra and performs the act of samsana) and the udgätr (who sings the udgïtha14). Employing metaphorical speech, the Mundakopanisad has eulogised the pursuit of Brahman through upãsanã (regular practice) not much unlike a skilled archer with the pranava as his pointed arrow (Mun. Upa. II 2.3), the ãtman (soul or self) as his bow and the Brahman as his laksya (target) 15. Charac- 11 Upadhyaya 1958: 597-98. - Viewing it as the destroyer of darkness, the Vedic seers have described three forms of the Sun : ut - the form which destroys the darkness of this world; uttara - the form which resides amidst the other gods; uttama - the extraordinary form that transcends the other two. ud vayam tamasaspari jyotih pasyanta uttaram / devam devatrã süryamaganma jytiruttamam, (Çg.

The triad of syllables in the word udgïtha 17 is suggestive of three entities: ut means prãna (vital airs), gïh refers to vânï (speech) and tha denotes anna (food). The Chãndogya (Chã. Upa. I 4.2-3) further alludes to an ãkhyãna (legend) in this context: when the gods themselves were badly scared of the unsparing mrtyu (death as personified here), they entered the three Vedas in order to screen themselves against death, and armoured themselves with the Vedic metres (chanda) 18, but mortality chased them there too. Finally, they sought refuge in the pranava which promised them immortality. 3. The Gayatrï Of the different Vedic metres 19, the gayatrï metre has been most highly eulogised 20. While enumerating his celestial manifestations, Lord Krsna has identified himself with the metre gayatrï among Vedic metres (Sri. X 35). As it is a three-footed and twenty-four lettered (caturvimsatyaksarâ vai gayatrï tripada) metre, each foot stands for one of the three Vedas 21. Etymologically, the word gayatrï, according to the Sãmkarabhãsya, derives from "that which liberates by its singing" 22. The Gayatrï opens with a pranava 23 as the first letter that forms her essential ingredient 24. The pranava or om derives from the three letters (varna- traya) 25 a, u and m' a-kãra symbolises Visnu, u-kãra Brahma and m-kãra Siva. " Kat Upa. 12.16-17: etaddhyevãkèaram brahma etaddhyevãkéaram param ... etadãlambanam éresthametadãlambanam param ... 17 Chã. Upa. I 3.6. - The three syllables are: ut, gïh and tha. 18 Chanda, which means a metre, by its etymology, also means "fortification". 19 These are: gayatrï, usnih, purusnih, kakubh, anustubh, brhatï, satobrhatï, pankti, prastãrpankti, tristubh, and jagatï (cf.

Upa. VIII 4-13) as well as the three states of the world srsti or utpatti (evolution), sthiti (continuance) and pralay a or samhãra (annihi- lation) 26. The Tejobindüpanisad conceives of the pranava as symbolic of the tejobindu (point of splendour) and prescribes three essentials of sãdhanã (instrumental means), vairãgya (renunciation), utsãha (enthusiasm) and gurub- hakti (faith and devotion towards one's spiritual preceptor) (Tej. Upa. 4) for the realization of the Brahman. Then follow the three mahãvyãhrtis 27 (mystic words or syllables), for the gâyatrï claims the first three great vydhrti out of the seven 28, only to be followed by the three pada. Each of these vyahrti represents a loka (world) : bhüh stands for bhürloka (earth), bhuvah for pitrloka (world of ancestors) and svah for svarloka (heaven) 29. The Taittiriya Upanisad identifies the first with agni (fire), the second with vãyu (air) and the third with ãditya (the sun) 30. Identifying pranava with the Brahman, the Nãradaparivrãjaka calls it Brahma-pranava, and discusses its three forms as samhãra, srsti, and ubhayãtmaka or vira ta (Nãr. Upa. VIII 1), besides dwelling upon the sub-divisions of each of these as characterized by the variation of their prosodial or syllabic instants in pro- nunciation (Upa. Amk. 1949: 756). As an anthropomorphised deity, the Gâyatrï is conceived of as a goddess. The invocation hymn employed in her ceremonial worship by her devotees depicts her as trayaksarã (three-syllabled), brahmavãdint (one who speaks of the Brahman), brahmayoni (the matrix out of which the Brahman begets) and mãtã (mother) 31. Regarding her as an embodiment of the threefold subtle attributes, the Gãyatri Upanisad depicts her as having three anthropomorphic appearances at the three sandhyã (divisions of the day) 32, and portrays her with all graphic 26 Nãr. Upa. VIII 17. - These stages are also known zsjanma, jïvana and sampra- veéa respectively. 27 Tai. Upa. VI: Bhürbhuvah suvariti vã etãstisro vyãhrtayah... - Bhüh, bhuvah and svah are also known as the mahãvyãhfti. 28 The seven vyãhfti are : bhüh, bhuvah, svah, mahah, janah, tapah and satyam. 29 Bhattachar YA and Mishra 1963 : 9. - On the basis of their residence, the Vedic tradition divides Vedic gods into three classes : a. dyuloka-sthãnt : Dyauh, Varuna, Mitra, Sûrya, Savitã, Pusã, Aávidvaya, Devï Usa, and Rãtri, etc. b. antarikéaloka-sthãni : Indra, Apãm, Napãt, Rudra, Vãyu, Parjanya, Ãpah, etc. c. prthviloka-sthãnt : Agni, Prthví, Soma, Sarasvatï, etc. Of these, according to Yäska, Agni, Indra and Vãyu or Sûrya are the presiding deities of prthvï (earth), antariksa (sky) and dyuloka (heaven) respectively. 30 Tai.

Her dhyãna (meditation) is thus of three kinds - purvãhna (morning), madhyãhna (mid-day) and sãyãhna (evening), and she is known by a different name at each sandhyã as Gãyatri, Sãvitrt and Sarasvatï respectively 33. Such variables as her age, complexion, clothes, conveyance, implements, mode of address and the world where she resides are different in each of her three forms 34. Many eulogistic hymns have been composed to spotlight the rewards accruing to one who performs the gãyatri purascarana. Even a purascarana (repetition of the name of a deity accompanied with offerings into fire) is marked by three distinct but unified stages - the gati (progress), the ãgati (retrogression) and the sthiti (pause) (Sharma 1961: 169). Moreover, the Gâyatrï Purascarana Paddhati works out a further trichotomy: Visnu is believed to be the gayatrï's hrdaya (heart), Rudra her sikhã (tuft) and Brahma her kavaca (armour) (Jayendrapuriji 1934: 309). The triad of domestic fires (tretãgni) 35 - the gãrhapatya, the daksina and the âhavanïya - has been identified with the apãna, the vyãna and the prãna. The Prasnopanisad further develops the analogy of a yajna for the physio- logical processes of the human body where the three vital airs form the three fires ; inspiration and expiration constitute the ãhuti (offerings into fire) ; the manas (mind) officiates as the yajamãna (sacrificer) ; and the udãna (vital air) helps him in the attainment of the desired fruits or rewards (istaphala) (Pra. Upa. IV 4). The Kathopanisad talks about the agnividyã 36 (knowledge pertaining to fire) into the secrets of which Naciketã was initiated by Yama, and proceeds to tell how anyone who performs the three ritual worships of agni by associating the ritual with the three Vedas - the Rg., the Yajus, and the Sãman - and with yajna, dana (donation) and tapas (austerity), attains heaven 37. 33 Gay.

Perhaps the flash of lightening in the blue, the fire of yajna on earth, and the fire residing deep in the sea water (vadavãnala) are the three kinds of fires that gave rise to the Rgvedic conception of threefold places of origin of the fire. 37 Pra.

The Yajna Yajna is the institution that occupies a pivotal position in the Vedic liturgy, and the Srauta and Grhya Sûtras abound of the procedural details of these. The Chãndogya Upanisad eulogises it as one of the skandha (shoulders) of religion (Chã. Upa. II 23.1-3). Yajno vai Visnuh - Yajna is Visnu - is an aphoristic passage that identifies the institution with god. The Vedic institution of yajna has three forms: the pãka yajna, the haviryajna and the somayãga, each of these including seven kinds of yajna and yãga (Upadhyaya 1958: 631). Again, the darsa and the paurnamãsa have three yoga each - the darsa having ãgneya purodãsa, Indra devatãka dadhi- dravyaka and Indradevatãka payodravyaka; the paurnamãsa having agnide- vatãka astãkapãla purodãsa, agnisomïya ãjyadravyaka upãmsu and agnisomiya ekãdasakapãla purodãsa (Upadhyaya 1958: 632). Even the somayãga had three forms, depending upon the duration for which it lasted - the ekãha (which lasted for one day), the ahina (which lasted from 2 to 12 days) and the satra (lasting from 13 days to a year or more) (Upadhyaya 1958: 633-34). A complex of mantra, Brãhmana (priest) and kalpa (ritual ordinances) that bind it in three ways (tridhãbaddha) (Upadhyaya 1958: 633-34), the yajna is figuratively portrayed in the Rgveda as a bull having four horns (the four Vedas), three feet (the three savana, i. e., morning, noon and evening when somar asa, i. e., a drink dear to gods, was extracted), two heads (the two havana, i. e., sacrifices into fire, known as the prãyanlya and the udayaniya) and seven arms (the seven metres) 38. 5. Upanisadic Cosmology The Svetãsvatara Upanisad alludes to a triad of the Isvara or Saguna (qualified) Brahman or jna, the jlvãtmã or ajna that stays in the mortal coil, and the ekã or prakrti 39. The Prakrti or Pradhãna is ksara (destructible) ; the nvãtmã or hara is both indestructible and nectar-like (amrtãksaram harah) 40. The jlvãtmã is therefore the bhoktã (the enjoy er), the prakrti the bhogyã (the ravä's amorous exploits with the celestial nymph Urvaái (Rg. X 95 and áat. Brã. I 5.1) Purüravä is not portrayed as a mad lover (as Kälidäsa's drama depicts him) but as the first mortal to have learnt of the secrets of the srauta fires and established on earth the institution of yajna. He is thus a great benefactor of humankind at large (Upadhyaya 1958: 348-49). 38 Upadhyaya 1958: 118-19. catvãri srngã tray o' sya pãdã dve êïrse s apta hastãso asya / tridhã baddho brsabho roravïti mahãdevo martyãm ã viveéa (Ç.g.

The world is believed to be the result or manifestation of the second principle - the prakrti that is characterized by the three guna - ajãmekãm lohitasuklakrsnãm 42. The Brahman is unconcerned or indifferent towards the world; the jlvãtmã is involved with it. The Mundaka and the Svetasvatara both allude rather figuratively to this dualism of the saguna Brahman and the jlvãtmã 43. Discoursing upon the problem of creation, the Chãndogya Upanisad divides the organic world into three kinds - the andaja (born from eggs), the jivaja (born alive) and the udbhija (sprouting as vegetation) (Chã. Upa. VI 3. 1-3). Elaborating upon the famous Upanisadic principle of trivrtkarana, it continues: the red colour of fire is that of teja (splendour), its white colour that of water, and its black colour that of anna (food) (Chã. Upa. VI 4.1). So do ãditya (the Sun), candramã (the Moon) and vidyut (lightening) have their threefold forms as teja, jala and anna due to the existence of the three guna. The triad of manas, prãna and vãk is described as annamaya, jalamaya and tejomaya respectively. Food, water and splendour or radiance each has three forms, viz., sthüla (gross), madhya (neither gross nor subtle) and süksma (subtle) so that the food one eats becomes mala (faeces) as sthüla, mãmsa (flesh) as madhya, and mana (mind) as süksma. Similarly, water and radiance or splendour have each three forms, viz. mütra (urine), rakta (blood) and prãna (vital airs), and asthi (bone), majjã (marrow) and vãk (speech) respectively (Chã. Upa. VI 5.1-7). As there are three Vedas, so there is a triad of gods (devatrayï or trimûrti) 44 - the Prajãpati (or Purãnic Brahma), the Sürya or Savitr (or Purãnic Visnu) and the Rudra (or Purãnic Siva or Mahesvara 45) who constitute the popular Hindu Trinity of gods as the creator or progenitor, the sustainer, and the destroyer respectively 46. The word prasthãnatrayi refers to the three systems of philosophical thought (prasthãna) that include the Upanisads, the Brahmasütra or Vedãn- 41 Ibid.: I 12: bhoktã bhogyam pt évitât am ca matvã sarvam proktam trividham brahmametat I 42 Ibid. : IV 5. - It is interesting to note here that to Vãcaspati Miara the word aja connotes a she-goat (Upa.

The Mundaka Upanisad III 1.1 also has a parallel passage. 44 Svamï Dattãtreya is depicted as a god with three faces. 45 Lord Siva is also known by one of his many names as tryambaka (having three eyes). As such, the mahãmrtyunjaya mantra which is addressed to him, begins: om tryambakam yajãmahe sugandhim pusti vardhanam / urvãrukamiva bandhanãnmrtyormuksiyamãmrtãt. 46 Gonda 1968: 212-226. - In his perceptive paper Professor Gonda attempts "to collect ... some data relating to the rise and development of the Trimurti idea and to rectify a few more or less current errors and misconceptions".</page><page sequence="10">The Trichotomous Theme : A Ritual Category in Hindu Culture 957 tasütra and the Srimadbhagavadgítã which are also known each by its alternate name as the srutiprasthãna, the nyãyaprasthãna, and the gîta - or smrtiprasthãna respectively (Gouda 1938: 552). 6. Trimorphic Classical Conception of Sãhitya It was not only the Greek philosopher who defined literature as the True, the Good and the Beautiful 47, by employing a trichotomy of epithets, but the Srimadbhagavadgítã (Sri. XVII 15) also has a parallel passage: anudvegakaram vãkyam satyam priyahitam ca yat, and the Hindu metaphysicians bestowed these epithets on the Brahman as well. The Vedic seers were the drastã in the true sense of the term. For, anticipate as they did the difficulty which the generations of students of the Vedas (the contemporaries and successors) might face, they not only gave the lexicon but also stressed and defined the phonetics for the sake of correct pronunciation of words and the preservation of their original meaning lest incorrect pronunciation should play havoc with the meaning or the protective rituals should turn destructive (Upadhyaya 1958: 363-64). The Nighantu is a lexicon of difficult Vedic words, the Nirukta refers to its commentary by Yãska, and the bhãsyas refer to still later efforts towards the interpretation of Vedic texts by seers and scholars. The Nighantu is divided into three parts - the naighantuka kãnda, the naigama kãnda and the daivata kãnda (Upadhyaya 1958: 424^25). The Samskrit grammar, both Vedic and post- Vedic, follows the theme of trichotomy in its classification of the svara (accents) 48, the mãtra (prosodial or metrical instants) 49, the linga (gender) 50, the purusa (persons) 51, and the vacana 52 (numbers).

Post-Vedic Thought 1. The Sãkta Literature The Sãkta school comprises three territorial sects of its followers as the Gaudîya (of Bengal), the Kaulïya (of Kashmir) and the Keralïya (of Kerala) (Gouda 1938: 489), and the image of the goddess largely worshipped in each of these territories is that of the Tãrã in Bengal, the Tripurã or Tripurasundari in Kashmir, and the Kãlikã in Kerala (Gouda 1938: 721). Gouda mentions the tri-yãna that were once in vogue among the Säktas - the devayãna in the south, the pitryãna in the north, and the mahãyãna in central India (1938: 720) 54. The Tantra Sãstra which is believed to have emanated from Lord Siva, also follows a trichotomy insofar as the Vãrãhí Tantra divides it into the Ãgama, the Yãmala and the Mukhya (Gouda 1938: 483). On the basis of mata (views), the Tãntrika modes of worship are trichotomised as the samayamata, the vtramata and the kaulamata 55. They are also known as the pasvãcãra or adhama, the virãcãra or madhyama and the kulãcãra or uttama 56 insofar as they refer to the three states of mental orientation of the Sãktas 57, and the mode of worship and its relative complexity in each succeeding form 58. The three ãcãra thus refer but to the three successive stages of attainment or sublimation of a sãdhaka (seeker). While dwelling upon the significance of the tripundra (mark on the forehead consisting of three lines made with cowdung ashes) which is the 54 daksine devayãnam tu pitryãnam tu uttare / madhyame tu mahãyãnam sivasamjnã pragïyate, (Kulãlikãmnãya Tantra). - As the Hïnayâna and the Mahãyãna refer to two paths - "lower" and "higher" - in Buddhism (Hiriyanna 1951: 78), so does the triad of Tãntrika yãna probably refer to the three paths of gods, ancestors, and the higher one pursued by the ããktas. 55 Ravishankara 1934: 253. - (Samayamata : that which endorses the Vedic mode of worship of Srividyã; kaulamata: that which prescribes the mode of worship through pancamakãra - the five M's being madya (wine), mãmsa (flesh), tnïna (fish), mudrã (gestures) and maithuna (coitus). The five M's which appear to be very earthly and grossly hedo- nistic in tone, have a very subtle metaphysical connotation in the Tantra rituals; misramata: that which leans partially to the mode of worship of both the mata - the samaya and the kaula. 56 Taranandatirthaji 1934: 151. - Even the kaula have three categories: uttama (upper), madhyama (middle) and kanistha (lower). 57 Ghosa 1934: 425. - Mental disposition or bhãva is of central significance in the Tãntrika mode of worship, for, as the Rudra-yãmala Tantra opines, it helps in the three- fold attainments - everything worldly or mundane attainable on earth, communion with god, and the highest knowledge : bhãvena labhate sarvam bhãvena devadarsanam J bhãvena par amam j nanam tasmãd bhãvãvalambanam. 58 Ghosa 1934: 428-30. a.

In the Sãkta literature, the para sakti (primal energy) is trichotomised (Gosvami 1934: 131) by her vibhãva 59, prabhãva 60 and anubhãva 61, each of these again having threefold states. Her three vibhãva are the cit-sakti (energy as consciousness), the jlva-sakti (energy as jtva) and the mãyã-sakti (energy as illusion). The icchã-sakti (energy as volition), the jnãna-sakti (energy as knowl- edge or cognition), and the kriyã-sakti (energy as action or motor power) are her threefold prabhãva 62. And the sandhinï-sakti, the samvit-sakti and the ãhlãdini-sakti constitute her three anubhãvas (Gosvami 1934:. 132). The icchã-sakti has polarities of volition with positive and negative affect. The former stands for threefold rãga (affections) or kãma (desires) - grahanecchã (will to receive), ãkarsanecchã (will to attract) and upãsanecchã (will to hold communion) ; the latter denotes the threefold dvesã (jealousies) or krodha (angers) - tyãgecchã (will to give up), apakarsanecchã (will to repulse) and apãsanecchã (will to withdraw) (Bhagavanadasa 1934: 122). The trichotomised manifestations of Sakti as volition, cognition and action are believed to be located in the different organs of the body - the icchã- sakti as hrdayasthãnt (or located in the heart), the jnãna-sakti as sirah-sthãnl (in the head) and the kriyã-sakti as hastapãda-sthãni (in the hands and feet) (Sak. Amk. 1934: 122-23). In the Visnu Purãna, the parã-sakti is believed to be that of Visnu's, the aparã-sakti that of the jiva (also known as the ksetrajna) and the mãyã-sakti (also known as the avidyã or gross ignorance) that of the mortals 63. Siva and Sakti in a state of equipoise in the bindu (as symbolized by the dot in the Tãntrika yantra) indicate the parã-sakti. The three sides of the tribhuja (triangle) in a yantra represent the three forms of vãk (speech) as the pasyantï, the madhyamã and the vaikhari (Dabrala 1934 : 597-98) . The highest and subtlest form of speech is the parã-vãk or the turiya-vãk (Kaviraj a 1934 : 59 Apte 1912 : 865 : " Any condition which produces or develops a particular state of body or soul." - It is interesting to note that the bhãva or emotional states as discussed in Samskrit poetics are threefold : vibhãva, anubhãva and vyabhicãrtbhãva. 60 Ibid. : 663: " Regal power on super-human power or faculty." 61 Ibid. : 70: "An external manifestation or indication of a feeling (bhãva) by appropriate symptoms such as by look, gesture, etc." 62 Woodroffe 1952 : 8-9. icchã-sakti-jnãna-àakti-kriyã-sakti-svarupint, (Laiita 180). « Vis.

It is the one that mortals employ in their everyday speech. The vaikhart apart, the para, pasyanti and madhyamã forms are described as guhã trïni nihitã (hidden in the three caverns of heart) (Sar. Upa. 6). While dwelling upon the Brahman, the Katha also employs a similar simile: more atomic than an atom and greater than the great, the Brahman resides in the cavern of heart of the jivãtmã 64. The three subtle forms of vãk are not heard by an average mortal, but one initiated into the Tãntrika mode of worship attains an efficiency by which the otherwise unheard melodies become audible. Even the different organs of the stotra (devotional prayers) and the mantra reflect a trichotomy insofar as a stotra or a mantra has a rsi (the sage to whom it was first revealed), a chandas (metre) and a devatã (presiding deity) 65. The Sarasvatïrahasyopanisad carries the trichotomy further to a triad of the hl ja (primal letter that symbolizes a deity and stands for her embodiment), the sakti (primal energy) and the ktlaka (nail or noose) 66. The Tripuradevi or Tripurasundari in the Ãgama Tantras is depicted as the goddess who excels in her beauty in all the three loka, and as having a triple symbolism (trisamketa) - cakrasamketa, mantrasamketa and püjäsam- keta 67. Of the various goddesses, the Tantras largely dwell upon the mahat- trayi (three great goddesses) - the Mahãkãli, the Mahâlaksmï and the Mahã- sarasvatï 68 who stand for the three manifestations of the Sakti 69. Each of the three caritra 70 (the characterizing chapters) of the Durgãsaptasati - the prathamacaritra, the madhyamacaritra and the uttaracaritra - refers to one of 64 Kat.

Like the Hindu trinity of gods, these goddesses are also associated with the threefold functions of annihilation, sustenance and procreation. Jagadguru Bharatikrishnatirthaji presents (1934: 15-16) in a straight manner (in very worldly terms though) the complex interrelations of these manifestations of Sakti with the trinity of gods, thus : Brother Sister Rudra ^ Mahasarasvatï varna: (complexion) (sveta) ^^^^^y^ (sveta) Visnu y/ *^ Mahâkâlï varna: (nïla) ^^^C^^ (nïla) Brahma ^^ Mahãlaksmí varna: (svarna) (svarna) Rudra and Mahâsarasvatï are siblings and so are Visnu and Mahãkãlí, Brahma and Mahãlaksmí. Each pair of siblings is different in its complexion, viz., white, blue and yellow respectively71. Rudra has Visnu's sister as his spouse, Visnu has Brahma's sister and Brahma has Rudra's. Thus, each of the gods is related to the other two either as a recipient or a donor of a spouse, as the following diagram shows : Brahma /aV Mahãlaksmí Mahâsarasvatï */ V Visnu Rudra "** Mahãkãlí (Arrow showing spouse relationship) Further, each manifest form of the Sakti has as her symbol a bijãksara (root-letter or alphabet) that is often embodied in a mantra 72. The Tãntrika literature is, thus, full of mantra which vary from the mono-alphabetic to the poly-alphabetic ones. Moreover, it also trichot omises the Tãntric rituals into a 71 All portraits, in the classical manner, of these gods and goddesses follow the above pattern of colours. 72 Woodroffe 1952 : 86. - For instance, hrim is Mahâkâlï s byãksara, srïm Mahã- laksmï's, and aim Mahâsarasvatï' s.

In order to ward off evil aspects of malevolent planets, the Tantras further have a threefold prescription - performance of propitiatory rites, wearing of specific jewels in an auspicious conjunction (tnuhürta), and chanting of mantra which, unlike its Vedic counterpart, comprises three brjãksara, besides such three things as the pranava, the name of the planet and svãhã 75. 2. The Vedãnta In their effort to comprehend and interpret the Vedic thought, the saints and scholars of the post- Vedic period held different stands or views (mata) regarding the nature and number of ultimate reality; in consequence, three major schools of the Vedãnta arose - the Dvaita (Dualism), the Advaita (Mon- ism) and the Visistãdvaita (Qualified Monism). "Broadly the three schools of Vedãnta may be classed as either absolutistic or theistic - the former repre- senting Brahman, the ultimate reality as an impersonal principle and the latter as a personal God", opines Hiriyanna (1951: 152). In common parlance the word mata connotes the triad of views - the vedamata (that which is sanc- tioned by the Vedas), the santamata (that which is endorsed by the saints) and the lokamata (that which is approved by the folkways). The Srimadbhaga- vadgïta alludes to the three modes of sãstrãrtha (academic disputations) as the jalfia, the vitandã and the vãda 76 when Lord Krsna identifies himself with the vãda, saying - vãdah pravadatãmaham (Sri. X 32). 73 Ravishankara 1934: 254. Yantra "means an instrument, or that by which anything is accomplished" (Woodroffe 1952:91). Mantra: "a formula (of prayer) sacred to any deity" (Apte 1912: 741). Tantra: "a religious treatise teaching magical and mystical formularies for the worship of the deities or the attainment of superhuman power" (Apte 1912: 467). 74 Woodroffe 1952: 85-86: "The neuter mantras, such as the Puranic..., ending with namah, are said to lack the force and vitality of the others. The masculine and feminine mantras end differently. Thus, hum, phat, are masculine terminations, and tham or svãhã, are feminine ones." 75 Shrimali 1967 : 228-30. - Tãntrika mantra for the propitiation of evil aspects of planets follow the above scheme; for instance, the Tãntrika mantra for the Sun is: Om hrãm hrïm hrüm sah süryäya svãhã. ™ Gît.

Philosophy of karma The doctrine of karma, a foundation stone of all Hindu metaphysics and liturgy, which finds its most systematic, scientific and articulate exposition in the Srïmadbhagavadgïta, also trichotomises one's deeds into the sancita or adrsta (accumulated), the prãrabdha (destiny) and the kriyamãna (present continuing deeds) 77. As such, the doctrine also correlates the threefold actions to the three lineal dimensions of time 78, besides alluding to the Hindu belief of life as a cycle of births and deaths 79 and the transmigration of soul 80. Allied to the concept of karma are the ideas of trideha (the three forms of body) 81, the three constituents of the garbhabindu (embryo) 82, the tãpatraya (literally meaning, three fevers or pains) 83, the three purusãrtha known as the trivarga 84 and the three kalyãna 85. 77 TiLAKl917: 271-72. sancita : the totality of one's actions or deeds till the present moment, whether those of the previous incarnations or of the present. The Mimãmsã calls it the apürva. prãrabdha : a part of the sancita karma the consequences of which one has started reaping. It is also known as the ãrabdha. kriyamãna: that which relates to the continuing deeds of the present incarnation. 78 bhüta (past), vartamãna (present) and bhavisyat (future). 79 In one of the stanzas of the Carpatapanjanka, bamkaracarya also nints in a rather poignant manner to the cycle of life, thus : punarapi jananam punarapi maranam punarapi jananljathare sayanam / Here the word punarapi (meaning "again") is thrice repeated. 80 ârï.

The Sãmkhya The Sãmkhya school of Kapila conceives of purusa and prakrti, or spirit and matter, as ultimately real. The first cause of the universe, the prakrti derives her complexity from the three subtle attributes of which she is consti- tuted (Sri. XIV). The three cosmic constituents - sattva, rajas and tamas - "are not mechanically placed together, but reciprocally involve one another and form a unity in trinity. In other words, they not only coexist but also cohere" (Hiriyanna 1951: 108). In a state of equilibrium of these cosmic constituents, the prakrti remains latent (avyakta), the state being known as trisãmya or sãmyãvasthã. As a result of stir in the state of equilibrium, she (the prakrti) manifests herself as the vikrti. In the course of her manifestation as srsti (evolution), the mahat (intel- lect), the ahamkãra (egoism) and the manas (mind) come into being in a quick succession. The triad of mahat, ahamkãra and manas is also known as the antahkarana (internal organ) (Hiriyanna 1951: 112). Furthermore, as a result of the manifold permutations and combinations of the guna, further principles also evolve. But, as Hiriyanna observes, "from the standpoint of the experi- encing individual, the three gunas are also described as being of the nature... of pleasure (sukha), pain (duhkha) and bewilderment (moha)..." (1951: 113) in the case of sattva, rajas and tamas respectively. 5. The Yoga Both intellectual and practical in tone, the philosophy of Yoga also endorses the trichotomous theme as propounded by the Sãmkhya. Hence the former is regarded as complementary to the latter 86. As a modus operandi, yoga relates to the procedural or practical aspect whereby physical, psycho- logical and psychic processes can be brought under human control. It aims at the preparation of the human body and mind, rendering them fit for the realization of ultimate reality. In an effort to control the distracting tenden- cies of consciousness 87, the yoga prescribes eightfold methods, the first five of which are known as the bahiranga (outward) ones and the remaining three as the antaranga (inward) ones 88. Besides imposing austerities and prescribing adherence to certain values in behavioural patterns, the yoga dwells upon the secret of inspiration and expiration, their control and the introversion of individual consciousness. 86 ári.

The antaranga methods are: dhãranã, dhyãna, samãdhi.</page><page sequence="18">The Trichotomous Theme : A Ritual Category in Hindu Culture 965 As breath is vãyu (vital air) and vãyu is prãna, logically speaking, the control of breath is tentamount to a control of prãna. Hence the prãnãyãma or control of breath. In between the püraka (inspiration) and the recaka (expi- ration) processes falls a third category of exercise known as the kumbhaka (retention of breath). The three modes of deep inspiration - the mülabandha, the mahabandha and the jãlandharabandha - form the three practical ways for the control of breath 89. Of the three internal modes relating to the performance of yoga, the dhyãna or meditation is of three kinds: sthüla or gross, the jyotis or flame and the süksma or subtle (Woodroffe 1952: 133). The Yoga, as the science of control of major nerve centres and the nervous system, believes in the complex cobweb of a multiplicity of nerves (nadï) in the human body (Woodroffe 1952: 47) 90. A control of the major nerves is yoga' s aim. Some of these nerves are gross, others are subtle. They are the channels of energy: "Of these nãdls, the principal are fourteen, and of these fourteen, the ida, the pingalã and the susumnã are the chief; and, again, of these three susumnã is the greatest, and to it all others are subordinate" (Woodroffe 1952:47). The idã, the pingalã and the susumnã all originate at the mulãdhãra (pelvic plexus) which is also known as the yuktã triveni (Woodroffe 1952 : 48) 91, and they extend along the cerebro-spinal axis. The idã, which is of a pale colour and moon-like (candra-svarupã), extends on the left side of the vertebral column while the pingalã on the right, and both lie outside the vertebral column. Only the susumnã extends through the hollow of the column. The susumnã is vahni-svarúpã (fire-like). It stands for the collectivity of three nerves - the vajrä or vajrini, the citrint, and the brahma-nadï. The kunda- linl (vagus nerve), when she is aroused from her mystic slumbers, moves upward to reach the brahmarandhra (the place where the different cranial bones join at the vertex). Both the idã and the pingalã coil round the susumnã, and each has its exit in the left and the right nostril respectively. All the three remain united up to the ãjnãcakra (medulla plexus) as the triveni (three rivers) from where they separate from each other, each one taking its own course. Hence the medulla plexus is also known as the muktã triveni (Woodroffe 1952: 48). 89 Woodroffe 1958: 208. - Kul. Tan.

Complex of Hindu Worship The triad of the sâdhya (object of attainment or the devatã), the sãdhaka (devotee) and the sãdhanã (pursuit) sums up the Hindu complex of worship that involves an interplay of the three elements and regards all the three as one - the devatã who is the object of worship, the mantra which the devotee pursues in his sãdhanã, and the guru who initiates and lends direction 92. The trichotomous theme pervades the realm of ritual worship as well. The Meru Tantra (V 913, 916-18) outlines the tridhã (threefold) puja as sãttviki, rãjasl and tamasï, depending on the mental disposition and mode of worship, or as uttamã (best), madhyamã (medium) and adhamã (worst). The Kulãrnava Tantra (X 3) defines the latter kinds thus : the uttamã is the everyday worship, the madhyamã relates to worship on festival days, and the adhamã is that which is performed at the conclusion of a month. The japa (recitation or muttering of mantra) is again trichotomised according to its mode of performance as the mãnasika (mental utterance or recitation), the upãmsu (uttered in inaudible or scarcely audible undertones) and the vãcika (clear and audible utterance) 93, where the first and the last are regarded as the best and the worst respectively 94. In everyday worship, three classes of deities are to be worshipped - the is ta devatã (god whose worship one has opted for), the pança devatã (the five gods, viz., Ãditya or the Sun, Ganesa, the Devi, Siva and Visnu), and the kula devatã (family gods or deities) (Woodroffe 1952: 96). Next, perhaps equal in importance, to the devatã is the guru on whom the initiate bestows in a prayerful vein the threefold epithets that identify him with Brahma, Visnu and Mahesa 95. The Kulãrnava Tantra (VI 15) prescribes for the initiate to follow only his guru's dictates in liturgical matters, lest he be doomed (VI 8). The Meru Tantra (X 630) goes to the extent of asserting that an initiate denouncing his preceptor will die; giving up his mantra, he lives in penury and misery, and is doomed to a place in the raurava (one of the hells) if he abandons both. Dwelling upon the importance of the guru, Wood- roffe (1952: 65-66) opines: 92 Kul. Tan. XIII 64-5: yathã ghatasca kalasah kumbhascaikãrthavãcakah / tathã devasca mantrasca guruscaikãrtha ucyate. yathã devastathã mantro yathã mantrastathã guruh / devamantragurunãnca pujayã sadrèam phalam. 93 Woodroffe 1952: 101. - The popular Samskrit phrase - manasã vãcã karmanã - which is often repeated in every samkalpa. Manu (XII 5-7) likewise enumerates three categories of impious deed along these lines. 94 Kul. Tan.

Guru is father, mother, and Brahman 96. Guru, it is said, can save from the wrath of Siva, but none can save from the wrath of the guru. Attached to this greatness there is, however, responsibility, for the sins of the disciple recoil upon him." The dikáã marks the transitional ritual of ushering the initiate into the realm of ãcãra (mode of worship) the secrets of which are unfolded to him by the preceptor. The act of bestowal of guru-mantra consists of repeating thrice the formula whispered into the ear of the disciple (Woodroffe 1952: 68). Eulogising the institution of formal initiation, the Rudrayãmala Tantra (cf. Gosvami [secundus] 1934: 398) observes: "Initiation helps in the attainment of sivatva (communion with Siva) and the destruction of the threefold dosas - the karmaja (those born out of one's impious deeds), the kãlaja (those born out of time) and the svàbhãvaja (those that result from one's temperament)" 97. The Sadanvaya Mahãratna trichotomises the rite of initiation into the ãnavi (formal initiation in strict accordance with the scriptures), the sakteyl (initiation during childhood) and the sãmbhavi (initiation by the guru's mere goodwill). The Vãyaviya Samhitã follows a slightly different trichotomy in its categorization of the modes of initiation into the sãmbhavi (received through the dar sana or sight, touch or mere speech of the guru), the sãkti (where the guru enters through the path of knowledge into the person of the initiate) and the mãntri (formal initiation with the paraphernalia of all outwardly accompa- niments) (Gosvami [sec] 1934). Outlining the merits of pursuit of the urdhvãmnãya (one of the five traditional usages of Tãntrika worship), the eulogistic hymns in the Kulãrnava Tantra add that it destroys one's threefold sins - bodily, mental and verbal - if one chants the mantra three hundred times 98. In the same context, it alludes to the three stages of life as old age, youth and childhood as well as the three states of consciousness as waking state, sleep and dream ". Moreover, the commencement of a ritual worship is often marked by the repetition of the word Visnuh thrice, just as the conclusion of a worship is marked by the three- fold utterance of the word sãntih, after the Upanisadic mode. 96 Mark the trichotomy here. 97 The word tridosa forms the central theme in the Ayurvedic system of medicines where the vãta, the pitta and the kapha are the three prakrti (innate biophysiological tendencies) of man. A state of equilibrium of these denotes health. Vitiation or derange- ment of any of these results in disease. 98 Kul. Tan.

Hindu Astrology Even the definitive section of Indian astrology largely employs the trichotomous scheme as a taxonomic device in its characterological classifi- cation of the graha (planets) as rãjasika, sãttvika and tãmasika on the basis of their disposition (Kane 1958: 574), or as masculine, feminine and neuter on the basis of their sex (ibid. : 575), or as mitra (friend), satru (enemy) and udãstna or sama (indifferent) on the basis of their affectivity - positive or negative - as well as their affective neutrality (ibid. : 586) ; of the rãsi (signs of the Zodiac) as Brãhmana, Ksatriya, Vaisya and Südra where each varna claims a triad of rãsi (Shastri 1952: 160-62), or as cara (dynamic), sthira (static) and dvisvabhãva (both dynamic and static) according to their dynamics (Kane 1958: 567), or as prsthodaya, strsodaya and ubhayodaya according to their mode of rising in the Zodiac (ibid.) ; of the naksatra (asterisms) as sãttvika, rãjasika and tãmasika (Shrimali 1967: 42), or as masculine, feminine and neuter (ibid.), or as adho- mukha, ürdhvamukha and tiryanmukha (Shastri 1952: 156). Even the twenty- seven asterisms when divided by the nine planets, are grouped into three for each planet. The twelve bhãva (signs or houses in a horoscope) are classified into three categories as the kendra, the panaphara and the ãpoklima (Kane 1958: 578). The word trik in astrological literature connotes the collectivity of three houses - the third, the sixth and the twelfth (ibid.). Moreover, a triad of rãsi is claimed by each of the four major directions, i. e., east, south, west, and north (ibid.: 567). While matching the horoscopes of a prospective bride and bridegroom, an astrologer especially looks for the gana and the nãdi of the two. Each of these has a triad of manusyagana, devagana and rãksasagana - as representing the men, the gods and the demons respectively (ibid.: 614-15), or the trichotomy of nãdi (nerves) as ãdi, madhya and antya (ibid.). According to the generally prevailing view about the seasons (rtu), there are three major seasons: grlsma (summer), varsã (rains) and sita (winter) (ibid.: 488). Even the tithi (lunar days according to the Hindu ritual calender or almanac) are trichotomised as dagdha, visa and hutãsana (Shastri 1952: 154), as the dark fortnight (amãvasyã) is believed to have three distinct shades as sinlvãll, dar sa and kuhü (ibid.: 153). The asterisms are not only categorised in trichotomous terms on the basis of their disposition (guna), gender and general tendency, but some of them are also regarded as inauspicious constellations which betoken death, disease or distress to a man, his parents and other relations. Collectively known as the müla naksatra, they may be differentiated into three kinds: the müla, the gandãnta and the sarpamüla (Kane 1958: 632-33).</page><page sequence="22">The Trichotomous Theme : A Ritual Category in Hindu Culture 969 Conclusion As a pervasive undercurrent in nearly all Hindu thought, the trichoto- mous theme characterizes the essential unity of all branches of learning. To a cautious student of oriental literature the recurrent, all-pervasive trichoto- mous theme, as outlined in the foregoing pages, will no longer appear to be a capricious attempt or idle scholastic exercises indulged in by the Hindu metaphysicians to divide everything into three categories, but it unfolds the underlying principle. In the moments of their supra-sensory perception as drastã, the Vedic seers attained revelations relating to the ultimate reality. As a category of supra-sensory perception, realization and cognition with the Vedic seers, the Brahman constituted the only and supreme principle around which the entire Vedic mysticism revolves. Though an impersonal principle, the classical con- ception of the Brahman also represents it with a threefold characterization as the Eternal (sat), the Conscious (cit) and the Bliss (ãnanda). In their sensory perception, the basic categories of perception and cognition were those that were related to the natural phenomena and the organic processes. The earth on which they lived, the fire and vegetation so vital to life and so very earth-bound and concrete, constituted the first category of their perception and cognition. Air (vãyu), cloud (par j any ah) and water as rains (ãpah) constituted another category of perception, again vital to life yet more ethereal. And the Sun, the Dawn and the Night, among others, formed the third category of their perception - shrouded more in mystery and lying more distant. In an effort to "... [read] the eternal deep haunted for ever by the eternal mind..." 10°, their cognition moved from the gross to the subtle, from the natural to the supernatural, from the mundane to the other-worldly. Hence the triad of worlds (loka) with great forces as their principal agents. The phenomenon of advent of varied forms of life on earth, their stay and their exit formed another category of perception and cognition. Arrival, stay and departure of life raised such threefold questions as the whence, the why and the whereto. A more dramatic, concrete and earthly parallel of procreation, sustenance and annihilation was perceived in everyday experience in the form of birth, growth and death. With the crystallization of such perception into a category of cognition, the supernatural agencies as anthropomorphised deities assumed these cosmic roles. On the individual plane, such everyday phenomena as life and death constituted a part of perception. Distinction between waking, sleep and death as consciousness, its partial suspension and, finally, its cessation respectively was rendered rather imperative. On the plane of individual consciousness, waking, sleep without dreams (susupti) and sleep with dreams also gave rise to a trichotomous taxonomy. 100 Wordsworth: Ode to Immortality.</page><page sequence="23">101 The author acknowledges Alan Dundes's paper as a source of inspiration that stimulated him to take up a parallel numerical theme and examine its pervasive impact on Hindu culture. 970 SAMARENDRA SARAF Anthropos 65. 1970 The trichotomous theme, thus, constitutes both a category of perception - sensory as well as supra- or extrasensory - and a category of cognition in Hindu culture. To the Hindu metaphysician the entire cosmos appears as pervaded by it. As a basic category, it is of great ritual significance in Hindu culture 101. Bibliography Apte, V.
