First published in 1977 by Carl Winter as Studien zur englischen Mystik des Mittelalters unter besonderer Beriicksichtigung ihrer Metaiphorik. WOLFGANG RIEHLE'S study concerns the metaphorical mystical language - a ternm which incorporates sensual concrete metaphors, images, and analogies - employed by the fourteenth-century English mystics to capture the experience of contemplation and of uinio with God. Unlike earlier studies, such as Grete Liiers's Die Sprache der deutschen Mystik des Mittelalters im Werke der Mechthild von Magdeburg, Antonie Olmes's Sprache und Stil der englischen Mystik des Mittelalters unter besonderer Beruicksichtigung des Richard Rolle von Hampole, and J. P. Schneider's The Prose Style of Richard Rolle of Hampole, uwith Special Reference to Its Euphuistic Tendencies, all of which were primarily concerned with individual mystics, or George Wood Tuma's The Fourteenth-Century Engli.sh Mystics: A Comparative Analysis, which sought to analyze the thought of the mystics by considering the phrases and ideas which cluster around the three phases</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 93 1 of the via mystica (purgatio, illuminatio, unio), Riehle opts for a comparative and stylistic approach which considers the language of the five leading English mystics - Richard Rolle, the Cloud of Unknowing author, Walter Hilton, Julian of Norwich, and Margery Kempe in the broader perspective of contemporary vernacular mystical texts of other European countries, particularly the Middle High German works of Mechthild of Magdeburg, Meister Eckhart, John Tauler, and Henry Suso. Additionally Riehle considers antecedent and contemporary English devotional, ascetical, and mystical writings, Middle English translations of continental mystical works, and, above all, the long tradition of Christian Latin mysticism, which relied heavily on the Bible, particu- larly the Psalms and Song of Solomon and subsequent allegorical and typological exegesis, and which also included the seminal works of Pseudo-Dionysius, Augustine, Anselm, Bernard, Aquinas, and Bonaventure. According to Riehle this rich prior tradition precludes valid source studies, but necessitates an emphasis on the Bible as the leading authority for the mystics. Although Riehle stresses that his focus is philological rather than theological, he carefully provides a theological context and interpretation for the writings of the mystics under consideration. After a brief introduction on the five leading English mystics, a discussion of their monastic and lay reading public, and an excursus on possible interrelationships between the English and continental mystics, Riehle devotes nine chapters to the language of the English mystics concerning love, preparation for unio, the spiritual itinerarium, speaking about God, mystical union and ecstasy, spiritual sense percep- tions of God, the experiencing of having and experiencing God, and divine indwell- ing and mystical deification. Adhering to the comparative base of Latin mysticism and contemporary mystical writings, Riehle examines the leading works of the English mystics with care, a wide-ranging knowledge of mystical texts and terminology, and a strong degree of empathy. This empathy is particularly evident in the case of Richard Rolle, who all too often has been classified as an enthusiast and a would-be mystic. While all of the chapters on metaphorical language are enlightening, this reviewer found those deal- ing with mystical union and ecstasy (7), the experience of God as a spiritual sense perception (8), and mystical deification and the Seelengrund (11), particularly the interpretations of Julian of Norwich (pp. 148, 156-59) and Walter Hilton (pp. 160-64), to be outstanding for their depth and clarity. This book has many strengths. Riehle generally eschews any direct influence of the continental mystics on the English group, preferring to treat similarities and parallel terminology between English and German mystics as affinities arising from their common source in Christian Latin mysticism and the Bible and their turning to the same linguistic possibilities of the Germanic languages. As a further departure from prior critics who have posited the influence of Meister Eckhart on the Cloud author, Riehle suggests that Rudolph of Biberach's De septem itineribus aeternitatis, with its affective and apophatic mysticism, and Margaret of Porete's Mirror of Simple Souls provided likelier source material for the Cloud author. In his treatment of the English mystics Riehle has greatly refined the established criteria of orthodoxy, Christocen- tricity, and affectivity, which impart a unique character to this group, and adds: a distaste for theological learning (which nevertheless does not preclude a knowledge of theology on the mystics' part); little influence of contemporary courtly love poetry, except in Rolle; a de-emphasis of gaining in knowledge of God through creation; a lack of anthropomorphic images of God, of metaphors for God's infinitude, and of speculation on the inner relations of the Trinity; a relative absence of sensual</page><page sequence="3">932 Reviews imagery referring to the spiritual perception of God, once again except for Rolle; a preference for the indwelling of God in the soul, rather than the soul dwelling in God; a tendency to avoid overly bold imagery in describing the mystical experience of God and the deification process; a strong homiletic thrust; and a greater reliance on the Bible, imparting a quasi-Pauline character to English mysticism, as well as a corresponding de-emphasis on the importance of the institutional church for the individual's personal experiencing of God. Yet another strength is found in Riehle's repeated references to the absence of citations from mystical texts in the Middle English Dictionary, leading to his conclusion: ". . . it is to be regretted that the MED has neglected the mystics so blatantly, often not listing mystical meanings of a word or failing to note particularly interesting occurrences of the figurative meaning of a term, to say nothing of the number of times its explanation of the mystical meaning of a term is unsatisfactory or even wrong" (p. 167). Minor detractions include Riehle's tendency to push his conjectures regarding the presence of continental mystical lay movements, such as the beguines, Brethren of the Free Spirit, Gottes- freunde, and Devotio moderna in England, and also regarding the impact of continental women mystics on Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe. One would also wish that he had been more charitably or equitably, or both, inclined toward Margery Kempe, who is rather consistently denigrated throughout the book (pp. 11, 30, 46, 96, 114, 116, 118-19, 129, 139). In sum this is an essential study for all scholars of the mystics, as well as a valuable reference work for medievalists in a variety of disciplines. VALERIE M.
