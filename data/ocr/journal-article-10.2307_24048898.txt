At ated at the bottoms and on the slopes of the 219</page><page sequence="2">STAvisKii and MKRTYCHEv: Qara-Tepe in Old Termez Fig. 1. Schematic layout of Qara-tepe. Drawing: E. Kurkina. hills. At present, eleven have been exposed ei ther completely or in part: these are designated by the Cyrillic letters A, B, B, r, A, E, K), the numerals 1, 2 (southern summit); and the letters A, M, (western summit). Peculiarities of planning and design solutions permit the reconstruction of the sequence of construction of several complexes at the north ern slope of the southern summit. The western most complex (e) was the first to be constructed (fig. 3). According to A. Nikitin, a copper coin found under the coating of the first floor of the western cave could be a small, as yet unknown, denomination of "Soter Megas."13 Thus the con struction of the complex might be dated to the end of the first century a.d. Comparison of the layout of complex E with that of other complexes of the southern summit (A, r, A, B,) suggests that the builders of Qara tepe used a particular "classic" layout in which there was a square yard with various rooms situated on three sides. From the yard, stairs led to the second-floor rooms located at the top of Fig. 2. Room with eyvan, northern summit. Photo: E. Zheltov. the hill. One side of the yard adjoined the cave portion cut into the sandstone hill, which con sisted of a by-pass corridor constructed around a central outlier with a square layout. A small room—a sanctuary—was situated inside the out lier. One or two isolated rooms would have been located at the far end of the by-pass corridor. The analysis of possible analogues among the cave structures of India and Afghanistan shows that the prototype of this classic layout might have been cave monasteries of western India and that the Qara-tepe layout is a simplified cave structure design. Thus, in the yard of a Qara tepe complex, the major part of the structure is constructed on the surface, while in the remain ing "mandatory" cave portion, the amount of underground construction is reduced (a by-pass corridor with a room in the central outlier in stead of a square hall).14 Because the builders of complex E were not familiar with the specifics of erecting cave struc tures, the cave portion was built with consider able deviations from the classic layout. Part of the area was not completed. The corridor at the far end connecting the side corridors and the iso lated room were not finished, and some rooms were built of mud brick on the site intended for a yard, with the result that the front portion of the cave corridor was located outside the cave in the area in front of it, and the yard, instead of being square, was rectilinear (fig. 4). The layout of complex A, constructed next, indicates that it was borrowed from that of complex E. While the "cave" is a mirror image 220</page><page sequence="3">STAvisKii and MKRTYCHEVi Qara-Tepe in Old Termez m-'y J •••' *-- r, *^«D Fig. 3. Complex E, general view. Photo: D. Mihailov. of this portion of complex E, certain conditions of the classic plan were followed, and the cave portion, which in complex E combines the cave and surface premises, here is fully cut into the sandstone. In the erection of complex r, the builders man aged to implement the classic plan: a by-pass cor ridor, which was cut into the hill and ran along a the perimeter of the central outlier accommo dating the sanctuary, adjoined the square yard. / % ■:') The fact that the walls of the surface structures shared the same brickwork design indicates that jS complexes A and B were built simultaneously. On the whole, the layout of these complexes cor responds to the classic plan. Thus, if we proceed 41|§If mÊÊL from the assumption that the builders followed / Jr '' ' a particular classic example, we come to the con elusion that complexes A and B were built after complex r. Complex B, situated at the eastern edge of the northern slope of the southern summit, differs somewhat from the other Qara-tepe complexes. %^N At first, it consisted of two independent struc tures, one of which occupied the eastern part of the yard with caves 1, 2, and 3 (B-l), while the other occupied the western part of the yard with caves 4 and 6 (B-2).

It is possible that this monumental graffito testifies to the presence of a Hephthalite family, which after a campaign in India adopted Buddhism and attempted to reha bilitate the deserted Buddhist sacred place.46 Judging from the paleography of inscription dipinti, painted in Brahmi in red, which accom panied the thematic mural in the western cave of complex r, this structure was decorated with paintings and functioned as a Buddhist monas tery at the end of the fourth-beginning of the fifth century. On the basis of epigraphic data, V. Vertogradova identified the period as the end of the fourth to the early sixth century and sug gested that there was a new influx of monks at this time, first from the area of Mathura, then from Central India and the Deccan.47 However, it is clear that the scale at which the monument functioned as a Buddhist cultic area (monastery?) in the fifth to the early sixth century was much smaller than it had been in the Kushan period. The excavation materials show that at this time deserted caves and rooms continued to be used as burial areas. The date of the burials of this period can be determined with the help of ane pigraphic coins of Termez manufacture that car ried an anchor-shaped stamp (tamgha).48 The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who visited Termez in a.d. 630, reported that there were twelve monasteries and about a thousand monks in the town (or vicinity?). However, at the pres ent we have no archaeological materials con firming his report. No Buddhist structures that functioned in the seventh century have been found at Qara-tepe and the vicinity of Termez. It is most likely that the pilgrim described the former grandeur of the Termez Buddhist com munity.49 By the end of the seventh-beginning of the eighth century, when Termez was con quered by the Arabs, the once-great Buddhist cult center had been reduced to vine-covered ruins, all that remained of the monumental sur face buildings, and half-buried caves with pas sages in a state of collapse. In this period, there were drastic ideological changes: the previous religious beliefs of To kharistan (in addition to Buddhism, the area was &lt;■*. 4 Fig. 13. Wall painting. Eastern cave, complex E. Photo: D. Mihailov. characterized by the presence of Manichaeism, Christianity, and a local religion reminiscent of Zoroastrianism) were replaced by Islam. Despite this, we can assume that Buddhist influence was preserved in the spiritual life of Termez for a rather long time. Judging from many Arabic in scriptions, the deserted Qara-tepe caves were still visited. The finds prove that these visitors came not only out of curiosity but also to per form certain religious rituals. Thus, in the west ern cave of complex K) we found a scratched image of a mihrab niche, at which a Muslim her mit marked with lines the days of fasting spent in solitude. It is possible that the ornamental painting in the eastern cave of complex E (fig. 13) is related to the existence of an unorthodox Muslim sect or Christian community during the first centuries of Islam, which chose a concealed spot at the "pagan" sacred place to establish its own sanctuary.50 The influence of Buddhism can be seen in the works of the Muslim mystic al Tirmidhi, who lived and was buried in Termez in the ninth century.51 It is possible that some of the Arabic inscriptions in the Qara-tepe caves were written by his followers and disciples who adhered to the mystical-ascetic trend in Islam and who found solitude in disintegrating caves. The finds of glazed ceramics and fragments of glass articles are evidence that the Qara-tepe caves had visitors in pre-Mongolian and even Timurid times. But, as time passed, the sands continued to engulf the ruins and filled the caves, thus preserving the history of this Bud dhist cult center for future generations. 229</page><page sequence="12">STAViSKii and MKRTYCHEv: Qara-Tepe in Old Termez Notes Kaia-Tepe I Kara-Tepe—Buddiiskiï pesh chernyï monastyr' v Stamm Teimeze.
