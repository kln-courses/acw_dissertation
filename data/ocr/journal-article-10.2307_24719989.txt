<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Discipline of Discovery Reflections on the Relationship between Internal and External Conditions of Knowledge Formation Ulrike Kistner Abstract: Starting with Foucault's articulation of factors in the formation of an order of discourse, and Ludwik Fleck's ideas on the structures of thought collectives and thought styles, this article mounts some reflections on the rela tionship between internal and external conditions of knowledge formation. In particular, it will look at the productive function of thought constraints - dis cipline - in the formation and transmission of knowledge, and bring this con sideration to bear on some perils besetting the humanities not only 'from without', but also 'from within', notably the turn from academic teaching to externally oriented professional training, and an uncritical, general-program matic proclamation of 'Multi-, Inter, and Trans-Disciplinarity' ('MIT') re organising discourses, disciplines and orders of knowledge. Keywords: analytic of finitude, epistemology, knowledge formation, knowledge transmission, Humanities in South Africa, thought styles, thought collectives In his submission to the Report of the Academy of Sciences of South Africa on The State of the Humanities in South Africa: Status, Prospects and Strate gies (ASSAf, August 2011), John Higgins examines what stands in the way of 'making the case' for the Humanities. To roll away the stone, he suggests, we have to recognise first of all the nature and impact of 'the dominant framework of assumptions, beliefs and opinions in policy discourse that, largely unques tioned tend to close off discussions of the value of the humanities before they have even properly begun'. Some of these obstacles are identified as 'the extreme polarisations of "Two Cultures" thinking', 'the sheer force of received ideas' (Higgins 2011), particular interests, ideological precepts, narrowness of focus, an economistic policy based on instrumentalist views and a conver gence of policy across a range of social sites. In the findings listed in the pub lished version (that does not include Higgins's contribution),' the Report narrows down this spectrum, attributing the compromised institutional capac ity to reproduce and replace high-level scholars and scholarship in the Human ities to an ageing academic and research workforce, and to the decline in the Theoria, Issue 138, Vol. 61, No. 1 (March 2014): 50-63 doi: 10.3167/th.2014.6113804 • ISSN 0040-5817 (Print) • ISSN 1558-5816 (Online)</page><page sequence="2">The Discipline of Discovery 51 number of doctoral graduates in the Humanities (ASSAf 2011: 129-30, ch. 7: Main Findings 8 and 9). While acknowledging these factors in accounting for the precarious state of the Humanities in South African academic landscapes, I would like to address the obstacles to making the case for the Humanities from a different vantage point. While most SWOT analyses of the state of higher education (the Academy of Sciences of South Africa (ASSAf) Report being no excep tion) tend to foreground what I would call external conditions, I would like to shift our attention towards internal conditions, but more importantly, to the relationship between external and internal conditions of knowledge formation and transmission. In framing the problem thus, I am aware of anti-positivist sociology-of knowledge traditions of the 1970s which relativise or dismiss the distinction between 'the practice of science' and 'the knowledge it produces', arguing for a social determination, even social causation, of knowledge itself. Most South African scholars active during that time would be familiar with these tradi tions, seeing that they have shaped some of our own positions and interven tions. The internal-external dichotomy, it was argued then, is instrumental in insulating science from the social and political spheres, thus allowing it to exercise its unacknowledged powers and complicities while claiming objec tivity, neutrality and freedom from external political influence (see e.g. Ezrahi 1971: 117; Johnston 1976: 198).2 A more recent version of the attempt to over come the externalism-internalism dichotomy emanates from Actor Network Theory, which broadly claims to incorporate 'the nature of things' within the social context, without reducing the one to the other (see Latour [1991] 1995: 12; see also 38). Nevertheless, I would like to reorient the inquiry into the condition of the Humanities along the lines of the distinction between external and internal conditions of knowledge and discourse formation, which has been obscured or dismantled in social constructionist, social-determinist and relativist accounts. To the extent that these modes of analysis have held sway within and over the Humanities, they have attained the power of definition over the Humanities' epistemic location (even as the Humanities themselves were being epistemically excoriated), and have arguably contributed to the difficul ties of 'making the case' for the Humanities. Placing objects and methods of inquiry in the Humanities under the 'power/knowledge' umbrella, knowledge formation in the Humanities is made to appear as always-already inscribed by and within power, being rendered co-extensive with the social field, and sub ject to policy interventions in the social field, in a way that knowledge forma tion in the non-human sciences - like physics or chemistry - is not. Flattening the distinction between external and internal conditions of knowledge formation in the Humanities would, I would want to show, deprive us of ways of recognising and investigating important hinge points in the for mal transmission of knowledge in institutions of higher learning, which is</page><page sequence="3">52 Ulrike Kistner what the ASSAf Report seems to grapple with in decrying the ruptured repro duction of academics and academic labour. For an important pointer directing our attention beyond policy and 'state of the field' descriptions, to an analysis of the conditions for the constitution of a field and the transmission of knowledge - and one that I am sure also lies in our own personal archives of intellectual engagement -1 would like to outline a trajectory between Foucault's Inaugural Lecture held at the Collège de France in 1970, entitled 'The Order of Discourse', and some of Ludwik Fleck's reflections on work in scientific collectives between contexts of dis covery, application and transmission. The route described here is structured by the methodological cautions sounded by Foucault, instantiated avant la lettre, by Fleck in theorising modes of knowledge formation and transmission in scientific collectives, which find expression, in turn, in the way in which Foucault acknowledges his intellectual 'debts' at the formal assumption of his role within a scholarly community - marking an (intra-)epistemic relation to sociality, as opposed to the external imposition of sociological templates and social policy dictates on orders of knowledge. When I first read the transcribed and translated version in my then youthful fervour of breaking open encrusted modes of doing thinking in an academic institution, inspired, as I was, by what I then took as a battle-cry, namely the 'insurrection of subjugated knowledges' (Foucault [1976] 1980: 81) of Fou cault's later lectures on power, I hit upon something incredulous to me at the time. I could not believe that the same intellectual whose work was an inspira tion to generations of active scholars and public intellectuals, could in one lecture make a case for looking at 'the ruptural effects of conflict and struggle' masked by 'the order imposed by functionalist or systematizing thought' (ibid.: 82), when, in an earlier lecture which came to me later (as it was pub lished in translation in the rather obscure edition of A Post-Structuralist Reader - Young 1981), he had argued for, and indeed constructed a whole course on, 'the morphology of the will to knowledge' within what he called the "history of systems of thought" (Foucault [1971] 2013: 199). At the time, in the urgency and heat of the educational struggles of the 1970s and 1980s, I tossed aside an investigation of 'the history of systems of thought', choosing to throw my efforts instead behind what I believed at the time was the 'insur rection of subjugated knowledges' happening before my eyes. Now I have reason to revise my earlier limited presentist understanding of 'subjugated knowledges' and, impelled by no less urgent though less noisily proclaimed imperatives, to turn to the systematic organisation of knowledge (and its unmaking), which I now discover to be anything but the antithesis of the 'insurrection of subjugated knowledges' - in ways that I hope will become clear in the course of the elaborations to follow. Both in his inaugural lecture, and in the course following on from it in his first year at the Collège de France, Foucault is concerned with choices and exclusions involved in 'the delimitation and fixing (the limits) of a field of</page><page sequence="4">The Discipline of Discovery 53 objects, the definition of a legitimate perspective for the agent of knowledge, and the fixing of norms for the elaboration of concepts and theories' (Foucault [1971] 2013: 199). Processes of selection and exclusion do not only constitute the field so delimited, but beyond that, they structure the reproduction of scholarship, scholars, and indeed social relations within and around the par ticular discursive field. It is virtually impossible to think outside of these delimitations. Thus, the straining towards unrestricted open discourse, and its bridling, are inseparable processes (Foucault [1970] 1981: 72,73; Young 1981: 48,49): 'In every society, the production of discourse is controlled, organized, redistributed, by a certain number of procedures whose role it is to ward off its powers and dangers, to gain mastery over its chance events' (Foucault in Young 1981: 49). A critical questioning of those instances of control 'must at the same time analyze the discursive regularities through which they are formed' (Foucault [1970] 1981:72). These restraints and exclusions, Foucault suggests, are neither entirely exte rior nor entirely interior to discourse itself. However, he does uphold this important distinction. 'External conditions of truth' include prohibitions, the authority and legitimacy of particular perspectives and institutional constraints (ibid.: 52^4). 'Internal conditions of truth', in contrast, involve internal proce dures such as formulaic and ritualised procedures and genres (e.g. commen tary), the role of the author-function, and the disciplinary organisation of knowledge (ibid.: 55, 59). Foucault devotes particular attention to the disciplinary organisation of knowledge, as a constraint and control that provides the possibility of devel oping new propositions internal to a body of knowledge: a discipline is defined by a domain of objects, a set of methods, a corpus of propo sitions considered to be true, a play of rules and definitions, of techniques and instruments [of a well-defined type] in a discipline ..., what is supposed at the outset is ... the requisites for the construction of new statements. For there to be a discipline there must be the possibility of formulating new propositions, ad infinitum, (ibid.: 59) For a proposition to belong to and within a discipline, it has to fulfil conditions in addition to those related to truth in a narrow sense; 'before it can be called true or false, it must be "in the true", as Canguilhem would say' (ibid.: 60; see also 61). '[0]ne is "in the true" only by obeying the rules of a discursive "policing" which one has to reactivate' (60) in each instance. Such constraints operating on the infinity of resources for the creation of discourses, Foucault suggests, are indispensable in accounting for their multiplicatory role (ibid.: 61). He insists on principles of rarefaction, as he calls these constraints, to counteract the appearance and talk of swarming abundance, plenitude and continuity of discourses; bringing the principle of regularity to them involves a restraining and restrained analysis in turn (ibid.: 67). Only on the basis of</page><page sequence="5">54 Ulrike Kistner systematic regularities can one account for the formation, dispersal and dis continuity of discourses. In the insistence on principles of rarefaction and constraint as internal con ditions for the multiplicatory capacity of discourses, Foucault would find com mon ground with a physician whose account of the emergence and development of scientific facts he had not read, but with whom he found a common denominator in the work of Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1960) (who was inspired by Fleck's work, and whose important role Foucault would acknowledge in his later writings). Polish physician and philosopher of science Ludwik Fleck (1896-1961) investigated, through the history of science and medicine that formed the archive of the diagnosis of syphilis, the role of thought styles in thought col lectives. Similarly to Foucault's idea of necessary constraints operating on the formation of discourses and knowledge, Fleck considers thought collectives to be governed by certain rules of observation and co-operation: We can ... define thought style as [the readiness for] directed perception, with corresponding mental and objective assimilation of what has been so perceived. It is characterized by common features in the problems of interest to a thought collective, by the judgment which the thought collective considers evident, and by the methods which it applies as a means of cognition. (Fleck [1935] 1979: 99, author's emphasis) The thought style, stipulating rules of co-operation, constrains individual members of the collective by determining 'what can be thought in no other way' (ibid.: 99). It provides the form in which the problem is articulated, the method of solving the problem is decided upon, and the form in which the solution to the problem is presented (see ibid.: 100). In the process, 'free spaces' are reduced (ibid.: 83^), thereby homogenising the ideas and prac tices of the thought collective. Individuality and personal inclination are with drawn in the service of a common scientific ideal (ibid.: 144). Closely related to this depersonalisation is the inclination to objectivise the thought structures [.Denkgebilde] created by the thought collective, and the coining of specialised termini technici, concepts and symbols (ibid.: 144). Scientific investigation and discovery (in contrast to artistic creativity on this score) are 'dense' with negotiations of obstacles and restraints (see Fleck 1939: 173). Thus, scientific truth emerges on the basis of 'stylized thought constraint' restricting free-wheeling, arbitrarily chosen investigative pursuits (see Fleck [1935] 1979: 101). 'The general aim of intellectual work is ... max imum thought constraint with minimum thought caprice'' (ibid.: 95; see also 97, author's emphasis), to use Fleck's famous phrase. In the insistence on the role of thought constraint in scientific investigation and discovery, and intellectual work more generally, Fleck and Foucault share common ground. However, while Foucault, like Fleck, does identify internal and external constraints operating on knowledge and discourse, and distin</page><page sequence="6">The Discipline of Discovery 55 guishes between them, Foucault does not spell out the spectrum of possible relationships between them. For Fleck, in contrast, the relationship between the differentiated external and internal constraints becomes pivotal in the formal transmission of knowledge. The concept of'constraint on thought', with which a fact is presented [by Fleck] as irrefutable, is interpreted by him in both directions. Thus, sociologically speaking, the individual member of a collective is not free to be scientifically active otherwise than on the basis of his stylized socialization. His thought must start with the pre suppositions created by the collective. But independently of these historically and socially developed conditions, they also represent epistemological determinants of scientific knowledge: they permit - logically - only the knowledge interrelation ships specific to them. (Schnelle and Cohen 1986: xxx-xxxi) In Fleck's account, the organisation of exoteric conditions becomes internal to the pursuit of science itself. Forming recognised scientific propositions deemed worthy of application and transmission (through what Fleck calls 'vademecum science') involves a process by which exoteric knowledge, knowledge originating in other collectives, and strictly specialist knowledge are all selected, blended, adapted, and then molded into a system. Concepts originating in this manner become dominant and binding on every expert. The preliminary signal of resistance has become thought con straint, which determines what cannot be thought in any other way ... (Fleck [1935] 1979: 123) However, this account pertains to the ideal-typical scenario. Numerous varia tions in the relationship between external and internal conditions of knowledge formation arise at particular historical conjunctures. These were only too palpable in the work of the collectives assembled to conduct medical experiments with a view to developing a diagnostic test for typhus, and an effective vaccine, in the concentration camp of Buchenwald, where Fleck was appointed to carry out this task in collaboration with other medical scientists and lay persons, from the end of 1943 to January 1945. Scientific work was severely compromised by an unethical framework, and by coercion, isolation, organisational dysfunctionality and an incohesive col lective. Of the work of the Buchenwald collective under these adverse condi tions, Fleck writes with hindsight in 1946: I had a very rare opportunity of watching, for nearly two years, the scientific work of a collective composed of laymen only. ... The collective worked on complex problems from the field of typhus; they had at their disposal fully equipped labora tories, plenty of experimental animals and an extensive specialist literature. This was in the Buchenwald concentration camp (Thuringia), so there was a tragic responsibility as far as the results were concerned; and the workers were thrown upon their own resources for, though the German Leiter did hold, true, a wartime</page><page sequence="7">56 Ulrike Kistner doctor's diploma, yet his specialist education was non-existent. His role consisted in supplying materials and urging his subordinates to work. ... One of the tasks given to the collective was: to examine whether the germ of typhus (Rickettsia prowazecki) is found in the lungs of mice and rabbits, which had been infected by a certain method. True, the workers had never seen Rick ettsia, nor did they know the standard bacterial flora of lungs and bronchi. Like wise they did not know the cellular elements of these organs. Consequently, they had to learn to see elementary things on the basis of descriptions and illustrations, i.e. to pass, so to say, backwards along the path normally chosen for knowledge. (Fleck [1946] 1986: 118-19) They prepared their microscopic samples 'with an extreme meticulousness according to the instructions contained in books' and deductively gradually collectively constructed 'all stages of the developmental cycle of Rickettsia and the required sequence', 'in tense expectation of the effect of the desire to be the first to establish something, not to be too late with the confirmation that something had been established, and to satisfy the boss who had been urging them along all the time' (ibid.: 119). Under coercive conditions - the watchful eye of the boss exerting pressure of results (in this case to dye the typhus germ) and under reproaches of having failed to do so for not having followed the books - the collective produces the desired result (finding the dyed germ in the sample) through mutual sugges tion and corroboration, just in time to avoid further reproaches and pressures (ibid.: 119) - but, as it turns out, scientifically erroneously. Fleck accounts for the blindness in terms disparaging of the thought collec tive's finding a 'harmony of illusions' through mutual corroboration (ibid.: 120). The error grew out of the closed system of ideas transported by a collec tive mood in the grip of external constraints. Fleck describes this collective mood as follows: [the thought-style of the camp collective] was characterized, in the first place, by replacing the fundamental specialist knowledge (which was not available) and the experiments (in which one had no confidence) with speculative considerations, and by replacing the practical specialist experience (which was also not available) with so-called common sense, (ibid.: 124) The absence or illegitimacy of a 'leading idea', the medically insufficiently trained 'Leiter' devoid of scientific authority, the coercive conditions, the absence of any reference points of traditions of, or experience in, cognition, the isolation of this thought collective from other scientific collectives, the absence of any possibilities for transmitting ideas between thought collectives, the deductive reliance on an arbitrary selection of 'textbook science', and the impossibility of participating in several 'thought communities' - all these con ditions add up to the failure in establishing connections that could become operative as internal conditions of knowledge formation and transmission.</page><page sequence="8">The Discipline of Discovery 57 Under these circumstances, external constraints were inversely related with internal constraints on knowledge. For the prisoner researchers, the numerous external constraints were extremely onerous, but there were few internal constraints that would be conducive to the systematic development of a thought style. Moreover, there were no systematic connections between external and inter nal constraints which could facilitate the formation of intellectually cohesive thought collectives on the basis of directed perception and shared discourses on ideas. The thought collective operating under extreme external and hap hazard internal constraints would acquire social authority, while lacking sci entific-logical authority. ... one can say that the lack of specialist education in the empirical field can best be recognized by the limitless accuracy of logical inference.... [attempts to] solve specialist problems by a speculative method, starting from a few textbook theorems which play the role of axioms, and from some data obtained from one's own expe rience - which were not linked together so as to form knowledge, but which were taught and commented upon - just as one expounds dreams or comments on the declarations of a diplomat, (ibid.: 124; emphasis added) We may draw from these reflections the following proposition: high 'social density' and high levels of credibility and legitimacy accrue to scientific work organised by leading ideas and regulated paths of working through constraints; and negatively corresponding low levels of credibility and legitimacy are accorded to randomly selected and forcibly induced co-operation without internal adherence to an idea or method. Hence Fleck's rather disparaging remarks on the group dynamics among the arbitrarily assembled and loosely connected inmate-scientists working on the typhus diagnosis and vaccine experiments in Buchenwald. The 'mistake' of the lay collective came about as a matter of the prepon derance of external restraints on knowledge production, undertaken in isola tion from scientific thought collectives, with verificationist procedures and deductive hypotheses gleaned from textbook science. In this case, the unbridgeable gap between exoteric and esoteric circles, between externalist and internalist conditions for knowledge formation, prevented an internalisa tion of the external organisation of a collective lacking in scientific authority and legitimacy. A second conclusion, related to the first one, concerns the conditions for the reproduction of scholarship and scholars along the lines of the formal transmissibility of knowledge from external organisation of scientific work to internal conditions of knowledge formation. The importance accorded by both Foucault and Fleck to thought constraint lies in the latter's pivotal role in facil itating a structured relation between external and internal conditions of knowl edge formation. Thought constraint, in turn, is authorised by adherence to a leading idea emanating from a supra-individual source, 'determinable by</page><page sequence="9">58 Ulrike Kistner cognition alone' through scientific discovery (Fleck [1935] 1979: 180, n. 7), which sponsors identification - vertically, of members of a thought collective with the leading idea, and horizontally, between members of the collective working with this leading idea. With this idea, Fleck pushes the boundaries of Freud's group psychology (Freud [1921] 1985). What remains of Freud's group psychology in the re direction of identification (with the leader of the group) to the leading idea in thought collectives, is the intellectual mood as expression of readiness for a particular thought style, for directed perception (Fleck [1935] 1979: 142), and an apprenticeship or didactic induction or initiation into, and assimilation of, a thought style (ibid.: 104). 'The authority of a thought collective is ... more nearly logical than social, yet it exists for the individual only by virtue of his induction into a group' (Kuhn 1976: xi). In the natural sciences, '[intellectual mood] is expressed as a common rev erence for an ideal - the ideal of objective truth, clarity, and accuracy It consists in the belief that what is being revered can be achieved only in the distant, per haps infinitely distant future; in the glorification of dedicating oneself to its service; in a definite hero worship and a distinct tradition'' (Fleck [1935] 1979: 142; author's emphasis). The 'hero-worship' embedded in the teacher-student relation is the conduit for the transmission of certain traditional values which in turn are subjected to specific thought constraints internalised in the individ ual science researcher through his/her relation to a thought collective. These constraints have found their corresponding themes in philosophy - namely 'an ethic of knowledge which promises to give the truth only to the desire for truth itself and only to the power of thinking it' (Foucault [1970] 1981: 65). The role of thought constraint in the formal transmission of knowledge, I would argue, is closely related to what Foucault encapsulated in the notion of 'the analytic of finitude' paradigmatic of the critical among the human sciences - ethnology, linguistics, and psychoanalysis (Foucault [1966] 1970: 314-17). It is as if Foucault enacted the analytic of finitude in his inaugural lecture. He starts off by voicing the anxieties of beginnings, 'the desire to be freed from the obligation to begin', involving unbridled discourses, and gestures towards harking back to firmer ground, bestowed on the beginner by 'a name less voice' hailing him/her to follow that instance which had already been speaking before him/her (Foucault [1970] 1981: 51). Towards the end of the lecture, that 'nameless voice' attains certain names reverberating through it, while never occupying it, indicating intellectual debts - to Georges Dumézil, Georges Canguilhem, Jean Hyppolite and G. W. F. Hegel. The debt that Fou cault acknowledges to Hyppolite's reading of Hegel is a particularly weighty one, one on which the notion of 'constraint' is being brought to bear. If so many of us are indebted to Jean Hyppolite, it is because he tirelessly explored, for us and ahead of us, this path by which one gets away from Hegel, establishes a distance, and by which one ends up being drawn back to him, but otherwise, and then constrained to leave him once again, (ibid.: 74; emphasis added)</page><page sequence="10">The Discipline of Discovery 59 The analytic of finitude - the finite act of knowing, in limited forms - allows for a divergence from commentary, and facilitates an investigation with a dif ference, by virtue of a constraint generating a critical relation, but only on the basis of servicing a debt previously incurred. I would like to quote Fou cault at some length here in order then to mount some observations relevant for our theme: I believe that Hyppolite's work, articulated in several major books, but invested even more in his researches, in his teaching in his perpetual attention, in his con stant alertness and generosity, in his responsibilities which were apparently admin istrative and pedagogic but in reality doubly political, came upon and formulated the most fundamental problems of our epoch. There are many of us who owe him an infinite debt. It is because I have no doubt borrowed from him the meaning and possibility of what I am doing, and because he very often gave me illumination when I was work ing in the dark, that I wanted to place my work under his sign .... It is in his direc tion, towards this lack - in which I feel both his absence and my own inadequacy - that my questionings are now converging. Since I owe him so much, I can well see that in choosing to invite me to teach here, you are in large part paying homage to him. ... And now I understand better why I found it so difficult to begin .... I know now whose voice it was that I would have liked to precede me, to carry me, to invite me to speak, to lodge itself in my own discourse. I know what was so terrifying about beginning to speak, since I was doing so in this place where I once listened to him, and where he is no longer here to hear me. (ibid.: 76) Far from being a series of sycophantic gestures, I would argue, what we see at work here are lines of transmission - not succession - mediating between external and internal conditions of knowledge formation. The analytic of finitude entrenches a debt,3 an 'infinite debt' - in this case even a death (so much for the proverbial 'ageing white males' around which construction so much anxiety is gathering - and more so now, as under new political and policy imperatives the powers that be do not know how to relate to them) - acting as a constraint that becomes constitutive of the critical human sciences and simultaneously acts as a conduit in the transmission of knowledge. In the case of Fleck's elaborations, it is a thought collective convened by joint work on a leading idea attaining the capacity of eliciting cathexis from those working on it, on the basis of analogous anthropomorphic if not paternal prototypes; in Foucault's elaboration, it is a line of thought acknowledging its philosophical debt to an anthropomorphic figurehead authorising intel lectual identifications. What do we draw from these reflections for thinking of the circuits of knowledge production and dissemination within which we are working? I would like tentatively to put forward some ideas here, which would bear fur</page><page sequence="11">60 Ulrike Kistner ther exploration and debate. These are related to two programmatic points that have come to feature centrally in post-apartheid higher education policy and research directives. The first programmatic point relates to the constitutional principles of equity and equality. In implanting these in higher education policy, I think it is impor tant to distinguish their differential relation to internal and external conditions pertaining to knowledge and discourse, respectively; for conflating them risks misdirecting any interventions. In some of the solutions sought to the problems of higher education, we may have (mis)treated internal conditions and restraints as external ones, and subjected them to policy interventions whose proper target would have been external conditions properly and exclusively. Some examples of misdirected interventions under the banner of 'equality' can be found among the policies implemented in the aftermath of the May 1968 uprisings in France, of which Jacques Rancière writes retrospectively, In the immediate post-'68 period in France, our politicians, with the aid of an army of sociologists and educational theorists, finally discovered that the best means of reducing inequalities in the face of formally transmitted knowledge was to cut back on this knowledge itself. (Rancière [1974] 1985: 101) It is possible to create equal opportunity in access to tertiary education insti tutions externally through foundation and bridging courses, writing centres and language courses, financial assistance, accommodation and transport, and access to amenities. But the core relation entrusted with the transmission of formally organised knowledge considered from an internal perspective, can not, without risking the annihilation of that knowledge itself, be directed by equity and prosperity-promising measures, such as 'skills training' and 'knowledge and information transfer'. The core relation between teaching and learning, while embattled, is still today, in the better case scenario and where it has survived one of a non-symmetrical relation of a (non-monetary) debt entailing an obligation that becomes the site, or rather, a network, of ethical practices (see Readings 1996: 154). Foucault's above-mentioned reflections on stepping - with awe - into the space vacated by his academic teacher Jean Hyppolite provide a good case in point - not simply of an intergenerational transmission, but of a phylogenetic archaeology of knowledge. This vision is still implicit in the commitment of the 1997 'Programme for the Transformation of Higher Education' to promot ing 'the socialisation of enlightened, responsive, and constructively critical citizens' (Department of Education 1997: 1.3), but has since been subdued in the course of the introduction of new forms of accountability, defined in terms of quality control, and productivity and efficiency enhancement measures that have restructured the institutional organisation of knowledge (mergers, incor porations, fusion, closure of departments and programmes) and curricula (courses and programmes designed to respond directly to 'market needs') (see Lange 2013).</page><page sequence="12">The Discipline of Discovery 61 Related to such restructuring is the latter-day embrace of 'Multi-, Inter-, and Trans-Disciplinarity' (MIT) within research areas and funding, corre sponding to new definitions and measures of 'performance' and 'impact', 'usefulness' and 'relevance', 'responsiveness' and 'strategic importance'. An unqualified mandatory endorsement of 'MIT' in teaching and research, and its elevation to policy blueprints filtering down into amalgamations of acade mic units, course offerings, and criteria for research funding is short-sighted at best, and detrimental for the transmissibility of knowledge at worst. An internalist investigation of possibilities for 'MIT' in research, in con trast, would proceed in highly circumscribed ways, and direct itself towards the specific nature of the question/problem to be investigated, with an interro gation of the possibilities and limitations, and the nature of conceptual and methodological transfers. This reflection would have to go in tandem with a historical-epistemological inquiry into the rationales, orders, constraints and limits of disciplines as they emerged and were transformed in the history inter nal to particular bodies of knowledge and academic configurations. In other words, even as we contemplate and situate particular inquiries within changing parameters of particular discourses and disciplines, we would need to be mindful of constraints necessary to guard the integrity of scientific and critical investigations; for it is only on the basis of systematic regularities that we can account for the formation and transformation, and find paths - given and transformatively giving - for the transmission of knowledge, disci plines and discourses.
