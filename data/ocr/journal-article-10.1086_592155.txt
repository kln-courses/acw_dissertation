Pp. x+282. $47.95. The Zohar, by any measure the most important work of  Kabbalah, is also among the most difficult. The difficulties that it presents to the interpreter are both historical and theological. Historically, it recounts the mystical adventures and teachings of  a fellowship of  rabbis in late antiquity, but has been shown by scholars to be the product of  a fellowship of  late thirteenth-century rabbis. The interpreter thus has to relate to a medieval setting a text that attempts to hide the signs of  its medieval provenance. Theologically, its teachings concern the sefirot, the ten powers in which the divine is manifest according to kabbalistic thought. These powers are on the one hand abstract spiritual entities. On the other hand, however, the Zohar, more than any other work of  medieval Kabbalah, depicts them in a seemingly endless and shifting series of  concrete terms, most prominently anthropomorphic and gendered ones. In attempting to sketch Zoharic theology, the interpreter is thus forced to navigate carefully between the poles of  the abstract and the concrete—between an incarnate and a carnal God. Joel Hecker’s Mystical Bodies, Mystical Meals: Eating and Embodiment in Medieval Kabbalah, a book that takes the Zohar and related literature as its primary source material, is notable for the skill with which it confronts these difficulties. Hecker takes as his task to explain how narratives of  Zoharic and related literature surrounding food and eating shed light on kabbalistic understandings of  the body. After offering a helpful review of  prekabbalistic Jewish discussions of  food and eating that are the source material upon which the Zohar creatively expands, he continues with an account of  mystical experience in this material as an experience of  bodily satiation. This is followed by an analysis of  the place of idealized foods, such as the manna that the Israelites received in the desert or the ç 2008 by The University of  Chicago. All rights reserved.

The discussion then shifts to the communal aspects of  eating and the communal nature of  the mystical experiences that emerge from the meal setting. Finally, Hecker concludes with discussions of  the place of  food and eating in “talismanic theurgy,” in which the table, food items, and the human belly become talismans to draw down divine energy, and “augmentation theurgy,” in which rituals surrounding food and eating, when performed with the appropriate intent, can repair and augment the Godhead. Throughout the book, Hecker’s overriding claim is that “alongside the spiri- tual experiences located primarily in the mind or soul, other areas of  the body, specifically the stomach and inward parts, also serve as locations for these ex- periences” (2). As Hecker shows, the embodied nature of  mystical experiences works against the spirit/matter divide that is so common in medieval Jewish thought and in medieval philosophy more generally. While the Zohar, too, in many instances subscribes to this divide, the embodied nature of  mystical experiences behind the work pushes toward a more unified notion of  the body. As Hecker puts it, “the body eclipses its normal alienation from the spiritual, becoming assimilated to the divine flow. What emerges is not so much a spiritualization of  the body, but rather the spirit-matter binarism is overcome, and the body is transformed into something neither wholly material nor wholly spiritual. The body that has emerged is one of  psychosomatic unity” (79–80). These findings, I would suggest, take on particular significance when considered from the vantage point of  the interpretive difficulties noted above. I begin with the challenge that the pseudepigraphic nature of  the work presents. Attentiveness to the gap between the actual historical setting of  the work in the late thirteenth century and its imagined setting in late antiquity leads, from the point of  view of  religious history, to a curious state of  affairs. As one standard narrative of Jewish intellectual history has it, the body/spirit divide is not pronounced in the authentic writings of  the Talmudic rabbis of  late antiquity but becomes pronounced in medieval Jewish thought as a result of  the inroads of  Greek philosophy, as mediated through Islamic scholarship, for which this divide is central. While Hecker does not make this point, the upshot of  his findings, therefore, is that the medieval authors of  the Zohar, who imaginatively locate their work in late an- tiquity, have perhaps recovered something of  the rabbinic viewpoint. What will be of  particular interest to historians of  medieval religious thought, however, is that the authors of  the Zohar have recovered this early rabbinic absence of  the body/spirit divide without abandoning the metaphysical under- pinnings of  neoplatonically inclined versions of  medieval thought for which that divide is central. In common neoplatonic form, the Zohar views the world hierar- chically such that there is a sharp divide between the immaterial sefirot and the increasingly more material world beneath them. Yet what is unique about the Zohar, and this becomes clear from reading Hecker’s work, is that it is able to find room for its embodied form of  spirituality within this worldview. From this point of  view it might be said that Hecker is engaged in a hermeneutics of  re- covery—an attempt to recover a mode of  spirituality that the typically medieval assumptions of  the Zohar might obscure. </page> <page sequence="3"> 68 Book Reviews Turning to theological difficulties that the Zohar presents, it seems to me that it is precisely the tension between the sefirot as abstract metaphysical entities and their description in concrete human terms that allows Hecker to demonstrate the way in which the body itself  can be the site of  mystical experience. It is acknowl- edged by scholars of  Kabbalah that the designation of  the sefirot in concrete terms is symbolic and that therein lies the key to navigating the tension between the abstract and the concrete representations of  God. The precise meaning of  the symbolic in this context is a matter of  scholarly dispute, but it is clear that in Zoharic symbols there is a closeness between the symbol and its referent such that the only access to the sefirot themselves is through the concrete terms that describe them. Hecker, for his part in evaluating the Zoharic use of  symbols and, borrowing from the anthropologist Michael Jackson, argues that in moments of ecstasy, that is to say at the height of  mystical experience, “the symbolic relation- ship between a human arm and a divine potency are recast; no longer is one ‘here’ and the other ‘there.’ Ecstasy, indeed the very operation of  mystical metaphor, ruptures the stasis of  ‘below’ and ‘above,’ revealing them to be coincident in both time and space” (13). The fact that Zoharic symbols brazenly collapse the dis- tinction between the abstract and the concrete provides Hecker the opportunity to discover the embodied nature of  mystical experience in medieval Kabbalah. Against this backdrop, Hecker’s book is notable for the fact that it does not strive to solve the interpretive difficulties presented by the Zohar but that it is able to capitalize on them to sketch a kabbalistic God that is simultaneously incarnate and carnal and a kabbalistic form of  mystical experience that is simultaneously disembodied and embodied.

Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2005. Pp. xvii+307, 5 maps. $65.00 (cloth). The Maasai are possessed of  a rich and fulfilling indigenous religious life, characterized by belief  in a transcendent divinity invoked in prayer, blessing, and sacrifice, and a rich system of  ritual that marks the life cycle, the development of age-sets, and significant community events. But responding to evangelization, Maasai have increasingly embraced Christianity, making long and colorful Sunday services important events in dusty towns throughout the rangelands they inhabit as pastoralists. The rapid growth of  Christianity in Africa makes this study of Maasai missionization especially relevant for understanding an important global phenomenon. The Church of Women takes as its topic of  inquiry the question of  why so many Maasai women and so few men have been converted to Spiritan Catholicism in northern Tanzania.
