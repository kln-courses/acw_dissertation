A Fable in Seven Parts For Phyllis Lambert Wolken kann man nicht " bauen " Und darum wird die "erträumte" Zukunft nie wahr. - Wittgenstein, Vermischte Bemerkungen 1. Weston's Cloud In the summer of 192], when the old tub that was slowly taking Tina Modoti and himself to Mexico made a stopover as it trailed down the coast of Baja California, the photogra- pher Edward Weston took a shot of a great cloud whose shape had caught his eye: "A sunlit cloud," he writes in his Daybook, "which rose from Mazatlán Bay to become a tow- ering white column." A few days later he noticed the roll of film was damaged but he went about repairing the damage as soon as he was settled in Mexico and went on to produce several enlargements of an image which, far from being reduced, in his own words, to a matter-of-fact shot, some- how fulfilled an intention that he seems to have deliberately kept vague.1 And how could it be otherwise, from the moment the cloud becomes a phenomenon - phenomenon, not object - that it eludes all intentional purposes along with any essen- tialist position, having only an accidental and transitory presence and being a function of strictly external causes and conditions, leaving us, moreover, completely free to project our fantasies on to it. (Where Weston saw a column, we might be more tempted today to see a hint of the atomic mush- room, minus the cap.) 2. BRUNELLESCHI'S MlRROR With the passing of the weeks, and as intense and dramatic as life in Mexico seemed to him to be, Weston never ceased to be as fascinated by the walls bathed in sunlight as by the clouds, "the marvelous clouds," to cite Baudelaire. "They alone," Weston writes, "are sufficient to work with for many months and never tire."2 But the fact that the photographer could be interested at the same time in textural effects resul- ting from the play of light on walls of stone, brick, or clay, and effects of a very different kind to which cloud forma- tions lent themselves, leaves us to imagine that we are wit- Edward Weston, The Towering White Cloud at Mazatlan, Mexico, August 1923.

Mark Wigley notes, "Atmosphere seems to start precisely where the con- struction stops,"5 in order to contrast this assertion with the idea of an "architecture of atmosphere" that would be based on a different notion of atmosphere than a strictly meteoro- logical one: a "built" atmosphere that emanates from a build- ing or from its image or representation, to say nothing of its ruin. In terms of graphic design, Le Corbusier could well con- demn those seeking after effects not restricted to a more or less stenographic line, but he didn't get as far as the cult of the abstract line that generates its own specific atmosphere.4 From this perspective, what sense would it make to stop at the element of air, an element as apparently foreign as the cloud is to any notion of construction, graphic or otherwise, as well as to architecture itself, defined in Le Corbusier's for- mula as "the masterly correct, and magnificent play of mass- es brought together in the light?" Weston compared the great cloud of Mazatlán to a col- umn. Contrary to any architectural construct, it remains that a cloud cannot be enclosed or delineated, still less circum- scribed according to a well-defined outline which, as we read in Alberti' s Della Pittura , provides the names of the surfaces and volumes that can be generated from it: "It is by their 'edge' (l'orlo) as much as by their 'back' (il dorso), their 'skin/ their external envelope, that circles, squares, and triangles are defined, along with spheres, cubes, and pyramids."* In this sense, and it is certainly what Leonardo meant in texts that are rightly celebrated, the cloud is like a stain or mark - a blur - that escapes the essentially graphic clutches of Eu- clidean geometry and, by the same token, accentuates by default the bond between art and geometry that was formed in Ancient Greece more than two thousand years ago and that is fundamental to and characteristic of Western culture. In his famous opuscule, The Origin of Geometry , the philoso- pher Edmund Husserl explained accurately how, born at the foot of the pyramids with the sage Thaïes, the invention of geometry presupposed as its precondition the constitution of a base, a ground, of sensory experience which itself would have gone through the elaboration and production of regular architectural volumes, among other things, before moving on to clearly defined edges, such as were obviously involved in the said pyramids.6 Paul Valéry hit on the same idea in Eupalinos , where Phaedro reminds Socrates of the buildings they saw put up, in their day, in Piraeus, and the engines, the efforts, the flutes that tempered them with their music, "all 10 3.

What solidity, what rigor sprang up among all those threads that yielded all those per- pendiculars, along all those fragile strings stretched out only to be leveled by the growth of beds of brick."7 In The Origin of Perspective, the title of which deliber- ately parodies that of HusserPs opuscule, I tried to show how, from Brunelleschi to Desargues, the work of the perspecti- vists has repeated this same scenario and in turn prepared the ground, though by other means, for the developments of modern geometry in its descriptive and projective aspects.8 In this context, we must return yet again to the founding myth that the first of Brunelleschi's "experiments" consti- tutes on the subject. I will limit myself here to recalling how, if we are to believe what may well be a mere fable or tall tale (albeit one of utmost consequence), Brunelleschi painted on a small square panel a perspective view of the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence as it appears from inside the cen- tral doorway of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore; how he is said then to have punched a conical hole in the tavoletta corresponding to the building's vanishing point so that, by turning the thing over and clapping his eye to the reverse side, he could see the image in a mirror. We will say nothing here of the theoretical implications of what effectively pre- sented itself not so much as an experiment than as a demon- stration in due form: essentially, the projective coincidence of the point of view and the vanishing point which is the image of it in the blueprint of the painting - a proposition which we take for granted today, but which was at the time a major discovery, one that would prove decisive for mathe- matics as well as for philosophy. What matters here, forming an integral part of this other fiction we are dealing with, is that once the Baptistery and its surrounds were represented in perspective and in the greatest possible detail, it remained for Brunelleschi not to depict the sky but, as his biographer strongly puts it, to show it or, literally, to demonstrate it Ça dimostrarlo ) as it stretched above the line of the rooftops. He manages to do this by resorting to the subterfuge that con- sists of inserting a burnished silver mirror in its place, in which air and sky are reflected, as much as the clouds that could be seen in it "driven by the wind when it was blow- ing."9 (It is impossible not to think here, as far as "cloud traps" go, of the shimmering bluish facades of modern archi- tecture and, in a radically inverted perspective, of the mirrors 11 Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence, east facade. 7.

Robert Smithson laid out in remote spots in the Yucatan in order to capture, mixed with the ash and mud that sullied them, something of the skies and clouds of the Mexico Weston was so fond of.)10 The time would soon come when clouds would find a way to record themselves directly within the frame, as a pic- torial species - or, in a more properly graphic form as though appliqued or left blank within the tight weft of lines (or dots) of which the sky is made, following a convention that Roy Lichtenstein has so spectacularly mined. Doubtless a cloud is not entirely formless, for we are sometimes tempted to see zoomorphic or anthropomorphic figures in clouds, not to say landscapes or fictional architectural shapes, sculpted by the wind, as in a Mantegna painting, where cloud formations rival his piles of antique ruins in intensity. But if there were forms or figures in this particular case, they were explicitly marked as transitory, just like the clouds passing in Brunel- leschi's mirror "driven by the wind when it was blowing." It is as unpredictable shapes, devoid of any permanence, in con- stant movement and perpetual transformation, that clouds owe the fact of having hooked the attention of a number of photographers and filmmakers, hot on the heels of the pain- ters, in the first half of the 20th century. But the fact that architects have more recently come to use an element so ap- parently foreign to the reign of the built environment for their own ends - this smacks, yet again, of a fable or some kind of fiction that may well be worth a closer look. ?.

Photo: Hubert Damisch. of Lake Neuchatel, in Switzerland, I photographed a strange thick oblong-shaped cloud that seemed to float some distance from the shore above the surface of the water. It seemed to float or, to put it more accurately since the choice of words is fairly crucial here, it seemed to be in a state of lévitation above the lake. As I examined it more closely, I could make out frag- mentary glimpses of a metallic structure momentarily show- ing through the cloud at certain points and emerging from it as though following it in its endlessly changing shape, seem- ingly enveloped by it in the manner of a celestial body en- dowed with a more or less opaque nebulous atmosphere. I sought out the two people I call the authors of the thing ("thing" - not object or phenomenon), Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofldio, at whose invitation I arrived at the scene to visit what they first called a "cloud machine" before limit- ing themselves to the more succinct and programmatic title of Blur. Initially, Blur was conceived as one of several attrac- tions organized around sites retained for what styled itself as "Swiss Expo 2002." The directive obeyed by the exhibition - which was in the best possible humor - is not relevant here: while playing on an extensive media gamut, it made much of architectural objects which were at the least incongruous and whose iconic range rivaled their critical function, much as occurred elsewhere with projects designed by Jean Nouvel and Coop Himmel(b)lau. There is no need, either, to go into the financial ups and downs that progressively blurred and watered down the outlines of the original project only to wind up giving the cloud machine complete autonomy, as the cen- terpiece pavilion, though it had originally been designed as part of a collaborative attempt at a "media landscape" - what- 13</page><page sequence="6">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="7">ever we care to make of such a term. Two features, however, demand to be retained. The first seems to imply an oblique way of eluding the network of structural determinations that can limit architecture on a conceptual as much as on a con- structive level. The second would correspond to a calculated shift from the medium in which architecture works to the formal media operations and interactions to which architec- ture may lend itself. 4. The Work of the Concept The Diller + Scofidio project presents a number of features or aspects typical of a conceptual work, beginning with the fact that it gave rise to the publication of a book - Blur: The Making of Nothing - which is like the work's archive, pro- viding an otherwise ephemeral embodiment with a kind of lasting quality at once textual and iconic and comparable to that to which a number of contemporary productions can lay claim, whether arising from performance or not: the last- ing quality of a fable or, better still, of a work of fiction. I will return to the problem posed by the term blur , a term that may mean a number of things and may assume different forms as noun or verb with a flexibility that goes to the heart of the matter. But first I need to remove any doubt. One can, of course, not take Diller and Scofidio's discourse seriously, and can see their cloud machine as a mere gadget, one no doubt clever as well as spectacular, but definitely of a flippant order, without any real speculative or architectural implications. I have chosen to take the op- posite view, one which leads to concern for the thinking that might subtend what presents itself less as an object than as a machination of "nothing" or of absence ( The Making of Nothing). This sends us back to our original paradox: in what way might architecture form a pact with clouds with- out exposing itself to becoming the victim of determina- tions strictly foreign to its own order? Wittgenstein writes "clouds cannot be 'built' 'bauen]. And that is why the 'dreamt of' future never comes true,"12 thereby implying that dreams have no more consistency than clouds and that we are incapable of building anything essen- tially oneiric or fantastical - which leaves the whole question of utopia hanging, along with that of narrative. Yet, in a quite different context, Wittgenstein also wondered about the mo- dalities according to which a concept might be brought down to what one can see, leave its imprint there and, literally, in- form it, in the manner in which Jacques Lacan compared the setting up of the Signifier to the descent of the Holy Spirit:15 15</page><page sequence="8">Construction of the Blur struc- ture at night.

Photos courtesy Diller + SCOFIDIO. to begin with the concept of outline, from the moment that nothing like lines or strokes exist in nature. But the issue is not limited to how the concept fits into the field of the per- ceptible. The issue bears on the way in which the concept can be put to work and, more to the point, can be put into work. Blur is the manifestation of this, if not the manifesto; the per- formance, if not, as I hope to show, the performative. For an example of how a concept may be evolved along lines peculiar to architecture, we might look at how the idea of structure was handled in this particular case, along with the design and construction, properly speaking, of the ma- chine, as well as the effects the latter was supposed to produce and which were neither exclusively visual nor constructive. A brief description will show how an ovoid metallic structure suspended from four incredibly skinny tubular piles sunk deep into the water and lake bed at a point where it is particularly loose, and working essentially in tension as a tensegrity sys- tem, was coupled with a network of pipes punctured at regu- lar intervals by apertures, out of which mist was sprayed at very high pressure. The accumulation of the mist in jets at the periphery of the structure produced, on contact with the ambient air, the fog or thick cloud through which visitors were invited to roam after donning blue raincoats handed out at the entrance to the ramped bridge slung from shore to ma- chine. The whole thing involved considerable technology. The flow of the water through the nozzles and its output as atom- ized mist were designed to be regulated by a computer from a built-in weather station, which adjusted the strength of the spray according to atmospheric conditions and wind direction. I would like to come back here to the use of the concept of structure and whether we understand this in a strictly con- structive, tectonic sense or whether we take it in its episte- mologica! sense as having to do with structuralism. What implications can the idea of a cloud structure have and, fur- ther, what effect can what we are forced to call the fantasy (or fiction) of a building whose primary components are steel and fog have on the very concept of structure? As Diller + Sco- fidio put it to the technical team with whom they discussed the terms for testing what claimed to be a cloud of dots: "We do not intend to make a volume of space covered with fog. We intend to make a building of fog with integrated media.,,14 But isn't "building" saying too much, or a mistransla- tion? If we take this text on its own terms, what is involved here is merely a matter of "making" (to make a building of fog) y the idea of the building being directly associated with consideration of the paradoxical material that is fog - a ma- il.

And this, in oblivi- ousness to, or should we say the fogging up or blotting out of - both possible equivalents for the word blur - that other material associated in a privileged way with the notion of built structure, that is, steel. Paradoxically, as far as so-called "primary" materials go, priority was given, phenomenologi- cally speaking, to the "cloud" element, with architecture succeeding where perspective failed, at least as far as Brunel- leschi conceived it: I mean, contrary to Wittgenstein's asser- tion, by building a cloud, if not by building in cloud ' as we speak of building in wood, in brick, in stone, in steel. Or to put it another way, without resorting to metaphor, by using cloud as a material with a structural application. This is some- thing that seems to go without saying for steel, but once cloud is brought into play we are forced to rethink the concept of structure and, without actually rejecting it, to try to inject a bit of elasticity into it, its share of fuzziness - something that is, again, far from obvious. Blur has nothing of the poststruc- turalist about it and still less of the post-structural. But inso- far as an honorable role must be given to architecture in the genealogy of the very notion of structure, we have a right to expect that the sometimes unpredictable evolutionary muta- tions in building would be of consequence for the future of structural thought and affect its economy. Don't get me wrong: if one is justified in the circum- stances in speaking of a "cloud building," this is less in terms of construction or function than in relation to the play of opposition the /cloud/ element is caught up in, play with a patently symbolic dimension (putting the word between slashes I aim to set it up in the position of signifier). We saw this with Weston and his interest in both the walls and clouds which Mexico laid on so abundantly. In a similar vein, I would cite the wonderful book in which the biologist Henri Atlan attempted to explore the notion of system and the orga- nization of the living being in reference to the two extreme poles constituted by crystal and smoke.15 By way of anecdote or symptom, I might add my own amusing discovery, as I was strolling through the on-line library catalogue of the Cana- dian Center for Architecture, of a paper titled "Steel For Bridges," delivered at a meeting of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in Philadelphia in 1881 by a certain John W. Cloud.16 That a name like John Cloud could have been worn by a man with a marked interest in steel construction I see as the index of a symbolic determination based on the 17 1$.

For myself, I can clearly see what fixed determinations the interest I felt from the outset in the Diller + Scofidio pro- ject complied with - to the point where I accepted writing about it even before I saw it, walked through it, and "breathed" it. I mean, beyond the beauty of the thing, which I would qualify as "pneumatic." This thing ("thing," I repeat, rather than object) is in fact located at the intersection of two of the principle axes of what I see as my work: on the one hand, the comparative approach of the fate, which I see as paradig- matic, of the sign or /cloud/ element in western art and the art of the Far East; and, on the other hand, the reflection on the specifically architectural determinations and resonances of structuralist thought as it was first systematically ex- pressed by Yiollet-le-Duc. If the architectural fiction con- ceived by Diller + Scofidio speaks to me, it is because it plays precisely on the articulation between these two apparently opposed, if not incompatible, axes of reflection. $. Pavilions As surprising as it was, the Diller + Scofidio project was not without echoes or precedents - from Mies van der Rohe, who wanted to punch through the clouds and whose facades ac- tually have nothing of the shimmering about them, to Coop Himmel(b)lau, founded in 1968 with the desire to make "an architecture as floating and changing as the clouds,"17 and, above all, to the Pepsi-Cola Pavilion for the International Fair at Osaka in 1970. This was a geodesic dome covered in an arti- ficial fog created by Fujiko Nakaya, who treated it as a sculp- ture, as we would expect. If we look at Diller + Scofidio's gambit more closely, the deal remains no less drastic: not only, as the authors of Blur insist, are we not dealing here with a built fog, strictly speaking, the way the Coop Himmelb(T)au structures, hung out like "skies," could be said to be built. But, more importantly, as sparkling as it was, the Pepsi-Cola Pavil- ion still adhered to the norm of a shelter firmly anchored to the ground and with the aim to serve as a theater for a whole series of performances and representations.18 Even though it has its place in the tradition of exhibition pavilions, the Blur does not fit into the tradition of provisional structures intended to serve as showcases for mercantile pro- duction, from the Crystal Palace to Melnikov's pavilion for the Paris Exhibition of Decorative Arts of 1925. Nor does it fit into the tradition of pavilions designed as so many advertising pa- nels for one type or another of housing. Blur was certainly 18</page><page sequence="11">Thomas Florschuetz, Enclosure Illy 2001 (Barcelona). not inhabitable in the sense in which the villa-apartment block cell presented by Le Corbusier at the Esprit Nouveau pavilion in 1925 was. Yet there most certainly was a proposi- tion here that had something to do with the idea of an inhab- itable place, a place where it would be good to breathe, and to breathe differently, by inhaling a different air, one charged with the purest of waters - in vaporized form. And if there was nothing really to exhibit or show here, a person could still front up to the bar upstairs to take the waters once more, this time as mineral water, still or sparkling, everything play- ing on the juncture of the two elements of water and air with nothing earthy muddying the waters. The only other precedent for the project that I can come up with is the German Pavilion designed by Mies van de Rohe for the International Exhibition in Barcelona in 1929. With- out being in any way nebulous, this pavilion broke its ties with the archetype of the house conceived as a cube and in- stead imposed the idea of an enclosure devoid of any lineari- ty, as shown in the series of photographs of the reconstructed Barcelona Pavilion presented in 2001 by Thomas Florschuetz precisely under the title "Enclosures." Just as importantly, apart from a statue, Evening , by Georg Kolbe, the German Pavilion exhibited nothing other than itself, with the two Barcelona chairs that served for the reception of the royal couple during the opening ceremony just sitting there, empty, like an emblem of absence or of some endlessly de- ferred expectation. A new and rare example of an exhibition pavilion with a strictly self-referential, not to say reflexive, purpose, Blur went one step further to the extent that self-exhibition was coupled with self-regulation in meteorological terms. Aside from the fact that strict economic considerations meant abandoning electronic media attractions such as underwater projections, the machine ultimately met the initial criteria of integrating the interactive concept of "media-architecture" under the title "cloud." The operation that aptly calls itself Blur is in effect the equivalent of a fable or fiction that one might describe as media-based. 6. Architecture in Absentia I have said how the idea of the cloud (cloud machine) was gradually substituted in Diller + Scofidio's discourse by the word blur ' which can be read equally as either a noun or a verb. The noun denotes the effect produced by the strict con- junction of the steel structure and the fog that emanates from 19</page><page sequence="12">Blurred by the mist. it, blotting out its contours, each linear element being cou- pled, so to speak, with its negation in actuality. (That it was necessary to double up the apparatus instead of getting the structure itself to produce the cloud could be seen as a flaw on the conceptual level, without this having much resonance on the phenomenal level.) The verb takes on the prestige of a performative: what Blur accomplished was merely the same as what it said or described. In the manner in which the storm clouds that invaded vaults and cupolas in the baroque era fogged up the architec- tonic, the blurring of lines and of any overly precise volume - try results firstly if not in the dissolution then, at the very least, in the loosening of the ties that architecture might maintain with geometry - and perhaps in their transforma- tion within the perspective of new geometries able to give the fuzzy its due alongside various effects of surface and tex- ture, as already happens with shimmering.19 Does this mean going as far as claiming it as a manifestation of a utopia, not of the absence of architecture, but a different kind of radical utopia, involving architecture in absentia , an "absent" archi- tecture or one on the verge of absenting itself: an architec- ture in suspense, literally and figuratively, and all the more sophisticated in its operation and effect because all other forms of architecture were vying with each other to wipe it out? Curiously, the same Walter Gropius who made himself, at least in his writings, the apostle of a fluid and transparent architecture, yielded, in what we might describe as a criti- cal moment in history, to the fantasy of an architecture that would work toward disguising itself, camouflaging itself, by drowning not in clouds but in the greenery. Holed up in Lon- don after having fled Nazi Germany, Gropius argued that, "With the development of aviation, the architect will need to pay as much attention to the bird's-eye view of his houses as to their erection. The use of flat roofs offers us the possibility of reintroducing nature among the stony deserts of our big cities, for the sites from which it has been chased by build- ings can be given back to it in height. Seen from the sky, the leafy roofs of the cities of the future will look like endless chains of hanging gardens."20 These words have a peculiar resonance today, appealing to an experience of architecture seeking to escape the earth- bound limits of the promenade architecturale , as well as those of gravity, and opening itself up to the sky. Certainly, there was no need to wait for the conquest of the air and the devel- opment of aerial navigation for the idea of a bird's-eye view of architectural forms to make itself felt: from three-dimen- 20 19. 1 am referring here to the work con- ducted by Pierre Rosenthal at the Centre de mathématiques sociales of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Paris, under the title of "taxiplanie." 20.

What remained to be seen was to what extent such a view could be affected, not to say radically altered, if not fore- closed, in what was its very object by the attack on the World Trade Center. For from now on, architecture would have to be considered as a potential target, exposed in its structure, if not its very being, in what it might contain of the provoca- tive, to the most devastating assaults. That, at least, is what some critics would like to persuade us of, not missing an op- portunity to shamelessly flaunt their hatred of density, the skyscraper, and building tall, which they hold partly respon- sible for the event at a symbolic level. It amounts to a singu- larly perverse form of rhetorical terror, one condemning thought, that should be categorically denounced. 7. A Chinese Fable? No more than Gropius could imagine, while he was writing The New Architecture and the Bauhaus, that bombs would soon rain down and flatten the stony deserts of the great cities of Europe, could Diller + Scofidio have conceived Blur and the thick cloud that emanates from it in terms of target and cam- ouflage. Putting aside the effect of context, we need to look elsewhere entirely, within a comparative perspective - one that is accordingly radically nonterrorist, which is enough to confer upon it, here and now, a strategic impact. The way in which architecture seems in this particular case to wipe itself out and cut its ties with the ground to enter into lévitation is not in fact unrelated to the way Chinese painters of the Ming dynasty initially liked to represent palatial architecture as 21</page><page sequence="14">Father Matteo Ripa, View of the Chinese imperial palace and gar- dens at Jehol in Manchuria, i7ij, etching with burin work.

The Jesuit father, Matteo Ripa, from whom the emperor commanded a suite of engravings featuring one of his summer palaces - the art of engraving being then unknown in China - soon saw how he could turn this to his advantage: 21 the empty area, left blank, to which the white cloud cover is reduced as it stretches from one side of the paper to the other over a view of a few pleas- ure pavilions, corresponds, in its function as sheer spacing, to one of the most constant features of Chinese landscape painting - in anticipation of the new genre of architectural view, invaded by a stream of thick clouds that drown out or partly dissolve contours and from which emerge the high curved roofs characteristic of Chinese architecture as though floating at the surface of the clouds or flying above them as mountains used to do in the Song dynasty. These same roofs have been seen by some as the image of the totemic bird of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 - 1046 B.C.E),22 itself partly mythical; as Oswald Siren, one of the first great Western connoisseurs of Chinese painting, as well as Chinese archi- tecture, put it, they seem "to soar over the colonnades."2* If we take a closer look at one such view of the Forbid- den City in Peking during the Ming era, we note that, apart from the golden clouds in which architecture is absent or dis- solves, the gap between the rim of the roofs and the beams that serve as architraves is itself filled by what looks like packing or cotton of a different color, here bluish, resembling curling clouds and justifying the comparison between the two types of structures, as well as between the effects they each lend themselves to. If building in wood as it has been prac- ticed in China for over 3,000 years was based on the combi- nation of columns and beams, it did not proceed by stacking along the lines of the Greek temple, but by the use of stress - the same as the steel structure that formed the foundation for Blur. As Siren further notes, the beams did not rest on the columns but went straight through them, or were fixed to them by notches and pegs, without the use of any nails - these being reserved for other uses considered permanent, such as sealing caskets24 - while offering the external appear- ance of an architrave connecting the whole colonnade, itself reduced, conceptually speaking, to the subordinate function of simple support. In big buildings the architrave sometimes seemed to rest on brackets ( lianzhu dou) attached to the columns. But what comprised the actual system of brackets - one of the main articulations of Chinese architecture - sat above the architrave to support the lower purlins of the roof- v&gt; The Forbidden City, Beijing, in THE CLOUDS.

Later, these brackets were multiplied with gay abandon, not only directly above the posts but all along the architrave. They were sometimes packed so closely together that they themselves came to look like cornices. Siren concludes, "They [the brackets] lose their function and be- come pure ornament, a sort of beard beneath the roof." What is important, within a comparative perspective, is that not only the brackets, reduced for the most part to a sup- posedly decorative function, but the blocks ( tuofeng ) them- selves, placed at the end of one beam to support the next beam, came to look like clouds or lotus flowers in the Ming and Qin dynasties. Siren feels compelled to remark that, "Parts are used that no longer have any material reason for being and that disguise the true building processes. The forms are the same as before but no longer make much sense." So much so for Siren that he finds that, whereas the wood ar- chitecture of Ancient China had the principal merit of being eminently logical and appropriate to its ends, as it was guided by the laws of the material used, it then lost what amounted to its immemorial soul when the original building principles began to be eclipsed by what he calls "decorative tendencies." The only problem is, if there were decorative tendencies, these accorded in every way with the tenets that were, on Siren's own admission, those of Chinese architecture of the golden age: "At the peak of its evolution, the roofing seems freed from its support, for the more it juts out from the building, the deeper the patches of shade that set it apart." Far from being deprived of meaning or being reduced to a simple, inconse- quential ornament, the "cloud" as decorative motif would thus rather have overdone its active obliteration of all artic- ulation between walls and roof, these being separated from each other by simple spacing - which is what the construc- tion itself tended toward from the outset. The reading Siren proposes of the evolution of building in wood is a good example of the functionalist ideology then reigning even within the field of archaeology. Pve said else- where how much this ideology, which found its most com- plete expression at the time in Viollet-le-Duc's Lectures on Architecture , seems to me beside the point when compared to the strictly structuralist inspiration of the Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture française: with the result that, on the concep- tual plane, a marked opposition is set up between structure and decor, the latter routinely seen as a mask or veil thrown over constructive reality. Hence the importance of Diller + Scofidio's discourse: here, it is no longer a matter of dis- 24</page><page sequence="17">Breathing in the Blur. 25.

In the case of Blur, the attempt was helped by the fact that the authors stuck obstinately to the notion of a struc-ture set on the water and apparently cut loose from all anchorage. It is not going too far to say that nothing could be more opposed to the moral we might draw from the somewhat Chinese fable dreamed up by Diller + Scofidio than sticking to the categories inherited from art history and considering the cloud that emanated from the structure and blurred its contours as a superfluous detail, a bit of decor or ornament. If there was an added element, it formed an integral part of the structure in the sense already described - in which the structure only made sense by producing the addition (the "supplement," in Derrida's terms) in order to, in turn, dis- appear into it. Which fits in perfectly with the remarks of Robert Smithson, whose catoptric excursions into the Yucat- an I took care to evoke earlier: "Contrary to the affirmations that are the doing of Nature, art inclines to false pretences and masks. . . . Appearances alone are fertile; they give access to the primordial. There is no artist that does not owe his exis- tence to such mirages. The heavy illusions of solidity, the non-existence of things, these are what the artist takes as 'materials/ It is the absence of matter that weighs so heavily upon him, inciting him to invoke gravity." Further, to fi- nally dispose of the problematic of the media Çbut not with that of the medium): "Artists are not motivated by some need to communicate. To travel over the unfathomable is the sole condition."25 The reference to Chinese architecture is intended to highlight the quality of a centuries-old architecture which had no real permanence and which would wipe itself out without leaving any ruins. This just happens to correspond to one of the purest and least contestable seams of the mod- ernist heritage. Siren remarked further that the only lasting architecture China ever produced was the Great Wall, the sharpness of the contour that gave its shape, its figure, to the Empire du milieu having in no way been corroded by history. To travel over the unfathomable : being dismountable and hav- ing shed all terrestrial foundations, the cloud machine was no less a thing of great beauty: a beauty connected in some strange way, in its radiance, to the image given to the concept by another Ripa - Cesare, this time - in his Iconologia of 1593. For Ripa, beauty was a woman undressed, with her head lost in a thick cloud of ovoid shape. He writes, "There is nothing as hard to talk about in a mortal language; it cannot be looked 25</page><page sequence="18">at without our being dazzled."26 Nor, I would add, without our being affected in our corporeal, physiological being. I have spoken, still in relation to Blur, about a kind of "pneu- matic" beauty (from the Greek f neuma, meaning "breath"): the pleasure, both physical and spiritual, we felt in passing through this fog that seemed to have no density, only to emerge here and there into the open air, could only be com- pared to the feeling of the first aviators navigating among the clouds, out in the open sky. A pleasure that wasn't only optical in nature but, indeed, was pneumatic, proceeding from what used to be called the revolutions of the "breath" in Chinese aesthetics: revolutions that were not reduced to nebulous or vaporous effects but which could manifest them- selves just as well, as the scholar painters insisted, in a brush- stroke and its evanescence, its blurring, if not its effacement, seen as constructive in terms of structure, just as in the fable delivered in Blur, all the more ineffaceable in that it was entirely fictional.
