DA Pegues*, MJ Hantman, I Behlau, SI Miller. Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. The PhoP/PhoQ regulon facilitates S. typhimurium adaptation to and infection of mammalian tissues. Previously, the PhoP-repressed locus prgH was shown to be important for bacterial mediated endocytosis and entrance into epithelial cells. prgH is predicted to be an operon of four genes encoding polypeptides of 392- (prgH), 80- (prgl), 101- (prgJ), and 252-amino-acid residues (prgK). The 2.6-kb prgH transcript was repressed in synthesis in bacteria that activate PhoP/PhoQ, indicating that PhoP/PhoQ regulates prgH by transcriptional repression. The PrgI, PrgJ, and PrgK predicted proteins are similar to Shigella fexneri and Yersinia enterocolitica proteins required for secretion of Ipa and Yop virulence factors. Five of the at least 25 polypeptides greater than 14 kDa detected in the supernatants from wild-type S. typhimurium cultures were missing from the prgHl::TnphoA mutant. The defects of prgHl::TnphoA in bacterial mediated endocytosis and protein secretion were complemented by a low copy plasmid containing prgHIJK. These results suggest that PhoP/PhoQ regulates extracellular transport of proteins by transcriptional repression of secretion determinants and that secreted proteins may be important to Salmonella invasion of mammalian cells. 1 Bactericidal Activity of Platelet Microbicidal Protein is Modified by Microenvironment and Target Cell Growth Phase. S-P KOO', AS BAYER, and MR YEAMAN. Division of Infectious Diseases, St. John's Cardiovascular Research Center, Harbor-UCLA MC, Torrance, and UCLA School of Medicipe, Los Angeles, CA. Thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tPMP) is a small, cationic peptide from rabbit platelets. tPMP has been shown to be microbicidal against a broad spectrum of pathogens associated with bloodstream infection, including Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Microbicidal actions of many other endogenous antimicrobial proteins (e.g., neutrophil defensins) are affected by a variety of environmental factors. In the present study, we assessed the bactericidal activity of tPMP versus Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 (BS) and SA strain 502A, under varying conditions of temperature (range 4-42?C), cationicity (range 0. ImM-2M), pH (range 4.5-8.5) and target cell growth phase (logarithmic vs. stationary). tPMP was recovered from thrombin-stimulated rabbit platelet supernatants, and its antimicrobial activity standardized by bioassay. For both BS and SA, tPMP bactericidal activity increased with temperature and pH. For SA, tPMP activity was greater versus logarithmic-phase cells. In contrast, tPMP activity decreased with increasing concentrations of Na', Ca", and Mg". Results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Effect of microenvironment and growth phase on tPMP bactericidal action. Organism Temp. t IN+' I C al t Mgl t pH Log Phase BS action 1 action \ action I action T action no effect SA lactian action tin tin action action action action action In conclusion, the in vitro bactericidal activity of tPMP is significantly influenced by microenvironmental conditions and target cell growth phase, in a manner parallel to those previously described for neutrophil defensins. These data suggest that the modulation of both tPMP and defensin bactericidal activities occurs via similar mechanisms. Additionally, the pH optimum for tPMP bactericidal activity in vitro (7.4-7.8) is consistent with conditions at the putative site of tPMP action in vivo, which is believed to be the luminal surface of damaged or infected vascular endothelium. 2 A Wistar rat with hair loss: a model for chronic Lyme arthritis. K. E. HECHEMY,* C. K. CSIZA, D. N. COLLINS, AND G. P. BARNARD. Wadsworth Ctr., NYS Dept of Hlth., Albany, NY. HBH-1, a NY isolate of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) induces pathology of the tibiotarsal joint (tj) in a Wistar rat with an autosomal mutation that resulted in hair loss. The clinical symptoms (CS) and histopathologic lesions were confined to the tj in both hind legs. This is in contrast to other animal models that exhibit a more generalized histopathology. The spirochetes (106) were injected IP or SC in 3-to 5-day old rats. The CS developed within 21 to 28 days post inoculation (DPI). The CS regressed and recurred in most rats (-70%) up to three times by 230 DPI. The first regression occurred at an average of 70 DPI. The recurrence of CS was noted at various times and was either in the tj of one or both legs. All serologies and joint isolations were positive for antibodies and spirochetes respectively. During CS, the histopathologic changes consisted of severe acute and chronic synovitis with intense exudation of fibrin and neutrophils into the joint cavity. Tendons and periarticular tissues showed similar inflammatory changes. Spirochetes were visualized in sections of the ankle joint by a modified Dieterle stain. Other organs and tissues exhibited no pathologic changes. In protection studies, offspring from mothers infected with live HBH-1 had materal antibodies. The antibody levels decreased to minimal level (ELISA OD &lt; 0.150). These offspring were challenged with live HBH-1 at 3-to 5-day post partum. No CS developed and antibodies were not produced . This indicated that the maternal antibodies protected the offspring from the challenge. Offspring from control mothers developed antibodies and exhibited CS within 28 days after challenged with live HBH-I. Because the CS and histopathology lesions are restricted to one joint, this animal model could offer a relatively simpler model for study of the arthritic condition of Lyme disease. 3 PCR Detection of Helicobacter pylori and correlation between cagA and peptic ulcer disease. R.J. DAVIDSON, D.J. HOBAN, C.N. BERNSTEIN, S.H. CHOUDHRI, and A. KABANI*. University of Manitoba and Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The polymerase chain reaction is rapidly gaining acceptance in the clinical laboratory as an extremely rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of both fastidious and non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. The presence of H.pylori, and more specifically the presence of the H.pylori gene cagA has been linked with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). We therefore initiated a study in our laboratory to determine if 1) PCR was as sensitive as culture and histology in detecting H.lpyloi in gastric biopsy specimens and 2) does the presence of the cagA gene correlate with PUD in our patient population. Patient demographics, recent use of antimicrobials or other medications and indication for endoscopy were collected from each patient. Antral biopsies obtained through endoscopy were submitted to the laboratories for culture, PCR analysis, and histological examination. PCR detection of H.pylori was based on the amplification of a 298bp fragment from a species specific antigen gene sequence. Only 1 of 16 specimens was culture positive for H.pylori. Histology detected the presence of H.pylori in 9 of 16 patients while PCR analysis detected H.pylori in an additional two patients. Of the 11 PCR positive specimens, 7 were found to be positive for the cagA gene. Eight of the 16 patients had evidence of PUD at endoscopy; 6 of these were cagA positive. Of the two remaining patients, one was negative for H.pylori by both PCR and histology and the other positive for H.pylori by both methods. These two patients, however, were on non steroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well. In conclusion, PCR detection of H.pylori is far superior to culture and appears to be at least as sensitive as histology. In addition, detection of the cagA gene as a predictor of PUD shows promise, however, further study is warranted. 4 Clinical Features And Laboratory Indices In 36 Cases Of Culture Proven Bacterial Meningitis In Children In Jamaica.N.C.BODONAIK*. University of the West Indies,Kingston,Jamaica. The case records of 36 children 2 months to 10 years with culture proven bacterial meningitis encountered in a 4 year period at the University Hospital,Jamaica were reviewed.The vast majority 28(78%) occurred in children less than 2 years of age.Fever was the most common symptom occurring in all patients(100%),followed by vomiting in 23 (64%) and lethargy in 18(50%).Confusion 7(19%) and seizure 5(14%) were some of the other prese- nting symptoms.Neck stiffness was detected in 32 cases(89%) and both Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs were positive in 16(44%).In 13(86%) however neither of these signs could be elicited.In the remaining 7(20%),only Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign was recorded as positive.Haemophilus influ- enzae was the most common causative agent acco- unting for 28(78%).Streptococcus pneumoniae was responsible for 5(14%).There was only one case of meningococcal meningitis. The Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid had detected the organism in 25,69% of cases.With routine immunization,the incidence of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis has been reduced dramatically in many developed countries in recent years.The poorer nations, where the disease is more prevalent,however,have not been able to achieve this because of finan- cial constraints.There is therefore a need for a global programme to routinely immunize infants in developing countries where Haemophilus influ- enzae still remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. 5 In-Vitro and In-Vivo Effects of Penicillin and Clindamycin on the Expression of Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcal Capsule. ITZHAK BROOK and ALAN E. GOBER, Departments of Pediatrics Georgetown University and George Washington University School of Medicine Washington, DC Encapsulation of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is an important virulence factor. The changes that occur in the rate of encapsulation of GABHS during pharyngo-tonsillitis, in 20 patients treated with penicillin and 20 treated with clindamycin, was investigated. The effects of subinhibitory concen- trations of these agents was also evaluated in-vitro. At day 4, 7 of 10 (70%) GABHS recovered from children treated with penicillin, were encapsulated as compared to 1 of 5 (20%) of those treated with clindamycin. Two days following 10 days therapy, GABHS was eliminated from 13 of the 20 (65%) children treated with penicillin and from all treated with clindamycin (P&lt;0.05). At that time, 6 of the 7 GABHS recovered in patients treated with penicillin were encapsulated. GABHS were not detected after 4 days of therapy in those treated with clindamycin. Incubation of GABHS isolates with 1/2 MIC of clindamycin reduced the rate of encapsulation, as compared with incubation with 1/2 MIC penicillin (12.5% vs. 67.5%). These data illustrate the superiority of clindamycin over penicillin in prevention capsule formation by GABHS.</page><page sequence="3">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 721 6 Staphylococcus aureus Induces Platelet Aggregation by a Fibrinogen- Based Mechanism, Dependent Upon Intact Bacterial Fibrinogen Binding Capacity. AS BAYER', PM SULLAM, C LI, AL CHEUNG, R YEAMAN. Harbor-UCLA MC, Torrance, CA; SF VA Med Ctr, San Francisco, CA; and Rockefeller University., NY, NY. We previously showed that aggregation of rabbit platelets by Staphylococcus aureus (SA) had: ) biphasic kinetics, with a phase I coinciding with platelet ATP secretion, and a phase II requiring presence of plasma fibrinogen; 2) a phase II which occurred despite block of the arg-gly-asp (RGD) recognition site for fibrinogen on platelet IIb/IIIa integrin receptor with exogenous RGD or anti-RGD monoclonal antibody; and 3) a phase II which was blocked by polyclonal antibody directed against SA fibrinogen-binding protein (IDSA Annual Meeting 1994). In the current study, we have further defined the mechanism(s) of fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation by SA. Mutant SA strains with transposon insertional inactivation of regulatory loci (sar; car) involved in synthesis of fibrinogen-binding protein could not execute phase II of aggregation. Similarly, mutant SA strains with insertional inactivation of fibrinogen-binding protein structural gene (clfA) could not execute aggregation phase II. Also, a synthetic pentadecapeptide corresponding to the SA binding domain in the C-terminus of fibrinogen 6-chain blocked phase II of aggregation. In contrast, neither a monoclonal antibody directed against the rabbit platelet IIb/IIIa receptor nor a synthetic dodecapeptide, analogous to the primary fibrinogen- binding site on the platelet IIb/IIIa receptor, could attenuate SA-mediated platelet aggregation. Conclusion: Full execution of SA-induced platelet aggregation is clearly fibrinogen-dependent, and is critically related to an intact SA fibrinogen-binding capacity. However, fibrinogen binding to its two major recognition sites on the platelet integrin IIb/IIIa receptor (RGD and dodecapeptide domains) is not required for SA-induced platelet aggregation. 7 Pathogencsis Of Shiga-like Toxin Induced Thrombotic Microangiopathies: Effects Of Toxin On Platelets. JACEWICZ M, ACHESON DWK, KING A, ERBAN J, KEUSCH GT. New England Medical Center, Boston, MA. Shiga-like toxin (SLT) producing E. coli infections are strongly linked to bloody diarrhea associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Pathogenesis of these systemic complications is not understood, but is believed to involve endothelial cell damage and swelling, release of hemostatic factors, and subsequent platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Together, these result in narrowing of the blood vessel lumen and cause microangiopathic hemolysis. The present study was undertaken to determine whether SLT-I has any direct effect on platelet function relevant to this proposed pathogenetic mechanism. SLT-I and recombinant SLT-I B-subunit were purified by affinity chromatography. Fresh human or rabbit platelets were prepared by standard hematological methods, or by platelet pheresis from donors for platelet transfusions. Toxin binding was assessed using t25I-labeled SLT-I. Platelet glycolipid receptor content was determined by HPLC. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was assessed using a platelet aggregometer after addition of 20 /M ADP. Platelets contain significant amounts of toxin receptor glycolipid and bind approximately 1.5-2% of added labeled toxin/105 platelets. This binding was specific and inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled toxin. Addition of 1 pg SLT-I to 2 x 107 platelets had no impact on aggregation unless ADP was also added. In this case, we observed a consistent enhancment of ADP-induced aggregation, not seen when heat-inactivated toxin or recombinant B subunit is added. Similar data were obtained using rabbit platelets. The data suggest that SLT-I interacts directly with platelets via a specific toxin receptor and augments aggregation induced by stimuli such as ADP. Similar effects in vivo could therefore potentiate direct effects of toxin on endothelial cells in the pathogenesis of microangiopathy. 8 Interaction ofS. aureus (SA) with Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and Identification of a Putative vWF Binding-Protein. M. HERRMANN*, J. HARTLEIB, S. WEBER, M. SCHIPHORST, J. J. SIXMA, G. PETERS. The University ofMuenster, Germany, and The University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Rationale: Multimerized vWF promotes adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial cell matrix in presence of shear forces. Therefore, vWF may serve as a potential adhesion factor for bloodstream SA to biologic or polymeric proteinadsorbed surfaces. Aim of this study was to define SA - vWF binding characteristics and to examine the promotion of SA adhesion to vWF-adsorbed surfaces. Methods: vWF from plasma cryoprecipitates was purified using gelchromatography, ['2I]-radiolabeled using lodogenR, and checked for contamination and/or degradation. For binding assays, vWF (up to 8 ug/mL) was incubated with SA Cowan I (Ix109 cfiu/mL) in Ca2t /Mg2' /Tween80 /Albumin-PBS (2h, 37?C). For adhesion assays, ['Hf-labeled SA Cowan I cells (4x l06 cfu/mL) were incubated with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) coverslips preadsorbed with up to 32 ug/mL vWF. For identification ofvWF-binding proteins, SA whole cell lysate proteins were prepared from SA strains Cowan 1, Newman, 8325- 4, and SA 113 using lysostaphin, separated using SDS-PAGE, blotted on PVDF, and incubated with labeled vWF. Results: In suspension, up to 8% ofvWF added bound dose-dependently to SA Cowan 1. Time course assays revealed rapid irreversible binding after &lt;5 min incubation. In adhesion assays, a significant increase of SA adhesion to vWF-PMMA (6. Ix104 cfi/coverslip) over albumin-PMMA ( 1.6x 102 cfu) was observed. Westem-ligand assays revealed a single band of approximately 48 kD size demonstratable in all four SA strains tested. Conclusions: Purified, high-molecular vWF binds dose-dependently to SA and promotes SA adhesion to surfaces, possibly via a 48 kD SA pro- tein. Thus, vWF conceivably plays a role in intravascular SA infections. The role of shear forces in this interaction needs to be further evaluated. 9 Production of Ace, Accessory cholera enterotoxin, in Pichia pastoris yeast. M. Trucksis, C. Fiore, A. Fasano and J. Kaper. Center for Vaccine Develop., Univ.of Maryland at Baltimore. Accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace), is a recently identified toxin of l'ibrio cholerae. Preliminary studies using crude toxin extracts in animal models indicate that Ace acts by increasing transcellular ion transport Its role in cholera pathogenesis is hypothesized to cause diarrhea. Elucida- tion of its mechanism of action has been hindered by the lack of purified toxin The purification of Ace is difficult because the quantity of Ace produced by lV cholerae strains is small. We have been unable to express the Ace protein in prokaryotic expression systems We report here the expression of Ace in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris to high levels The expression system uses the promoter from the methanol-in- duced alcohol oxidase gene AOXI. Expression is tightly regulated and induced by methanol to high levels The protein expressed can be se- creted using the secretion signal present on the expression vector The advantage of expressing secreted proteins is that P. pasloris secretes low levels of native proteins, thus the secreted toxin comprised about 85% of the total protein in the media and this served as the first step in purifica- tion of the protein. The engineered P. pastoris yielded 0.64 g/l of Ace The accumulation of Ace in supernatants was dependent on the composi- tion of the growth medium, with optimal production in unbuffered mini- mal medium which prevented proteolysis by neutral protease. The re- combinant Ace protein was used for intradermal injection to immunize a rabbit. The antisera completely neutralized Ace activity from wild-type cholera strains as assayed in the Ussing chamber, a model used to study ion fluxes across epithelial membranes. Preimmune sera tested in parallel, did not neutralize the activity. The M, of the recombinant protein was estimated to be 10,000 by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. This is close to the size predicted (Mr 11,300) from sequence analysis of the wild-type gene 10 Comparative Study of Fusobacterium necrophorum Strains from Animal and Human Sources. V.HALL, B.I. DUERDEN*, J.T. MAGEE, H.C. RYLEY and J.S. BRAZIER. University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, U.K. Fusobacterium necrophorum causes necrobacillosis in man and animals. Although indistinguishable by conventional tests, there is evidence that distinct host-specific sub-species may occur. Amongst animal isolates biovar A strains are pathogenic for mice, macropods and other animals while biovar B strains show little pathogenicity for these species and human isolates are much less virulent than animal strains in experimental infections in animals. A collaborative study was co-ordinated by the PHLS Anaerobe Reference Unit, Cardiff to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic properties of F. necrophorum strains originating from human and animal sources. Fifty strains comprising 21 human clinical isolates, 24 animal isolates, 1 NCTC strain and 4 duplicates were blind-coded and distributed to each of six participating laboratories for examination by various methods. The Anaerobe Reference Unit tested morphological characteristics, gas-liquid chromatography of metabolic end-products, carbohydrate fermentation, pre-formed enzyme production, and examined the strains by pyrolysis mass-spectrometry and SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins. In conventional tests all strains were identified as F. necrophorum but differences in colonial and cellular morphology were observed. For each isolate, results of conventional tests were converted to a 23 digit numerical code and subjected to Clustan analysis. Human strains (biovars unknown) formed a cluster with biovar B animal strains. Biovar A animal strains clustered separately. Clustan analysis of pyrolysis mass-spectrometry data and SDS-PAGE data revealed similar groupings. Our results suggest that animal and human isolates of F. necrophorum are distinct and that the toxigenic mechanisms of necrobacillosis in man and animals may differ. Therefore, animal models may be of limited value in investigations of F. necrophorum pathogenicity in man. 11 CDllb/CD18: A New Signaling Protein for Lipopolysaccharide. R.R. INGALLS*, P.A. RICE, AND D.T. GOLENBOCK. The Maxwell Finland Laboratory for Infectious Diseases, Boston Univ. School of Medicine, Boston, MA. The p2 integrins are members of the Integrin family of cellular adhesion proteins. These molecules, which share a common (2 subunit (CD18) noncovalently attached to a unique a subunit (CD11a-d), interact with a variety of ligands, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). There is growing evidence that the p2 integrins, in addition to their mechanical function, are capable of serving as signaling receptors. As previously reported, the integrin CD11c/CD18 is capable of inducing translocation of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) in response to interaction with LPS under serum- free conditions (Ingalls, R.R. and D.T. Golenbock. 1995. J. Exp. Med. 181:1473-1479). CD11b/CD18 functions as a complement receptor for iC3b, and participates in monocyte and neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts (CHO), normally unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), acquired serum-independent responses to Gram- negative bacteria and LPS when transfected with CD11b/CD18 (CHO/CD1 b). Nuclear localization of NF-KB was evident in CHO/CDllb within 30 minutes of stimulation, and maintained throughout the 3 hour time course. A comparison of the dose-response relationships shows that CHO/CD11b was modestly less responsive to LPS than CHO transfected with CD11c/CD18 or CD14. Unlike LPS signaling via CD14, which is enhanced by serum proteins such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), signal transduction in the CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 transfectants was decreased in the presence of serum. In addition, the anti- CD1 lb monoclonal antibody 904, the only antibody known to block binding of Gram-negative bacteria and LPS to CD11b/CD18, inhibited LPS responses in CHO/CD11 b. Thus, in addition to CD14, the phagocyte receptors CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 have the capacity to activate cells after binding to lipopolysaccharide. We hypothesize that CD14 is the major LPS receptor involved in the acute cytokine response to invading Gram-negative bacteria in blood stream infections, where serum and LBP are ample. However, the (32 integrins may function as additional LPS receptors in tissue infections where serum-derived proteins to catalyze LPS interactions with CD14 may be sparse.</page><page sequence="4">722 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 12 Urinary Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is Associated with Hemolysin (HEM) Production by Escherichia coli(E.coli) and Pyuria in Pediatric Patients with Febrile Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). B. JANTAUSCH, R. O'DONNELL, B. WIEDERMANN. Children's National Medical Center,(CNMC) Washington, D.C. UIL-6 concentrations were measured by immunoassay in 35 patients (PTS) admitted to CNMC with febrile UTI and 22 febrile control children (CON) with negative urine cultures in order to determine the association of UIL-6 with UTI, HEM production by their E. coli isolate and laboratory indicators of inflammation. UIL-6 in the 35 PTS (median age 6.4 mos) had a median value of 180 pg/ml (range 0-1950) compared to 0 pg/ml (range 0-480) in the 22 CON (median age 3.9 mos) (p&lt;0.0001). UIL-6 values approximately 48 hours after the institution of inpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy in 22 PTS had a median value of 7.5 pg/ml (range 0-125) compared to 195 pg/ml (range 5- 1900) on admission (p&lt;0.0001). UIL-6 for 10 PTS infected with HEM producing E. coli had a median value of 694 pg/ml (range 71-1950) compared to 180 pg/ml (range 0-1250) for 21 PTS with E. coli strains which did not produce HEM (p= 0.03). 21 PTS with pyuria, urine WBC? 50 cells/hpf, had a median UIL-6 vlaue of 230 pg/ml (range 0-1900) compared to 100 pg/ml (range 0-1950) for 14 PTS with urine WBC&lt;50 cells/hpf (p=0.02). UIL-6 is elevated in children with febrile UTI and decreases in response to antibiotic therapy. Magnitude of the UIL-6 response is associated with HEM production by E. coli isolated from urine. UIL-6 is associated with pyuria in febrile pediatric UTI patients and may be a mediator of inflammation in these children. 13 Capsulate Group B Neisseria meningitidis: Mechanisms of Resistance to Macrophage Phagocytosis. R C READ,* S ZIMMERLI, V C BROADDUS, D SANAN, JS SWARTLEY, DS STEPHENS, J D ERNST. UCSF, San Francisco General Hospital; Emory University Medical School, Atlanta, USA; and Sheffield University Medical School, UK . Group B Neisseria meningitidis causes systemic disease including meningitis following penetration of the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is a macrophage-rich tissue. Polysaccharide capsule strongly influences meningococcal invasion. A capsulate case isolate (cap+) and an isogenic capsule - deficient transformant (cap-) produced by Tn916 insertion into the capsule operon were used to experimentally infect 12 day old monocyte derived human macrophages (M0). Cap+ was 4-fold less adherent to M0 after cold incubation (p=0.01, n=6). Adherence of both strains was significantly increased after opsonization with non-immune C5-depleted serum. To study post-internalization events, inocula were adjusted so that opsonized Cap+ and Cap- adhered to M0 in equal numbers. Following warming of target M0, internalization was assessed by accessibility to bacteria of fluorescein-conjugated anti-C3 antibody and by colocalization of meningococci with a phospholipid membrane marker. Cap+ and Cap- were internalized at equivalent rates and both entered membrane bound compartments. Colocalization of bacteria with the late endosomal / lysosomal marker Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein (LAMP) revealed that fusion of cap+ containing phagosomes with lysosomes was significantly reduced 10' and 30' after entry (P&lt;0.02, n=5), but by Ih, no difference was observed. Once internalized, both strains were effectively killed over 18 hours of incubation, though more rapid killing of Cap+ was observed over the first 5h. These results suggest that interaction of opsonized capsulate meningococci with human macrophages is modified at more than one step and that killing can occur by lysosome- independent mechanisms. 14 Haemophilus ducreyi Expresses Hemin-Binding Proteins. B.C. LEE' and D. VILLENEUVE, The University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. Haemophilus ducreyi exhibits an obligate requirement for hemin in vitro. However, the mechanism of hemin uptake in this bacterium is unknown. By using a batch ligand affinity chromatography method, three hemin-binding proteins of mol. wt. 98,000, 61,000 and 43,000 were isolated from total membranes derived from H. ducreyi strain 35000 grown on chocolate agar. Competition binding experiments showed that this hemin-protein interaction was specific, since only hemin, and heme-containing compounds such as human hemoglobin and bovine catalase, but not protoporphyrin IX, cytochrome C,,,, iron-loaded human transferrin, or iron-loaded human lactoferrin could inhibit binding. Affinity-purification of detergent solubilized membrane extracts localized the hemin-binding proteins to the outer membrane fraction. No difference in HmBP expression was discerned in cells grown under hemin-restrictive and hemin-rich conditions, whereas iron deprivation exerted selective reciprocal effects upon HmBP expression. Western immunoblot analysis of the HmBPs indicated that the 61 -kDa HmBP was immunologically distinct from the recently described H. ducreyi GroEL heat shock protein. Similar HmBPs were affinity-purified from another clinical H. ducreyi isolate. These results suggest that hemin acquisition in H. ducreyi may proceed via a receptor-mediated process in which the initial step involves an interaction with these HmPBs. 15 A Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against the 97- kDa Gonococcal Hemin-Binding Protein Inhibits Hemin Utilization by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. B.C. LEE' and S. LEVESQUE. The University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. Neisseria gonorrhoeae expresses two hemin-binding proteins (HmBPs) of molecular weight 97,000 and 44,000. Binding of hemin to these HmBPs has been proposed as the initial step in the acquisition of hemin by the gonococcus. To more precisely characterize the role of the 97-kDa HmBP in this uptake pathway, a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) was produced against this HmBP from N. gonorrhoeae PID543. In growth assays in which bovine hemin served as the sole exogenous source of iron, the anti-97 MAb specifically inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the ability of hemin to promote growth. In contrast, no growth inhibition was seen when either an irrelevant MAb was used or when human transferrin was the sole iron source. The MAb competitively inhibited binding of the 97-kDa HmBP, and, to a lesser extent, the 44-kDa HmBP, to a hemin-agarose affinity column. This binding inhibition was specific since the control MAb did not abrogate binding of the 97-kDa HmBP to the hemin-agarose matrix. In Western immunoblots, the MAb recognized the 97-kDa homologues from a limited survey of clinical gonococcal and meningococcal isolates. These results indicate that the 97-kDa HmBP is directly involved in the gonococcal hemin acquisition pathway and, furthermore, imply that the meningococcal homolog shares this function. 16 Pulmonary Surfactant Protein A Upregulates Expression and Function of the Mannose Receptor on Human Macrophages Resulting in Enhanced Phagocytosis of the Virulent Erdman M. tuberculosis. C.D. GAYNOR* and L.S. SCHLESINGER, VA Medical Center and the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA. During infection with M.tuberculosis (M.tb), bacteria are phagocytosed by pulmonary macrophages in the presence of surfactant and its associated proteins, including surfactant protein A (SP-A). We have previously shown that alveolar proteinosis patients' (APP) SP-A enhances phagocytosis of the virulent Erdman M.tb by a direct interaction with human macrophages (Clin. Res., 42:301A, 1994). Our laboratory has also determined that both complement receptors (CRs) and the mannose receptor (MR) on human macrophages mediate phagocytosis of Erdman M.tb (J. Immunol., 150:2920-2930,1993). In this study, we investigated the SP-A- macrophage interaction to determine if expression and/or function of these phagocytic receptors is enhanced. To evaluate APP SP-A's effect on expression of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) receptors, we performed flow cytometry using antibodies (Abs) to CR1, CR3, CR4 and the MR. Following a 1 hour preincubation with human serum albumin (HSA) or APP SP-A, 5 day old mononuclear cells were washed and then incubated with these Abs and appropriate control Abs. The MDM population was defined by PE-conjugated anti CD14 Ab. As a positive control for MR upregulation, IL-4 was used. After exposure to APP SP-A, expression of the MR was enhanced when compared to HSA control: change in mean intensity 115+49%, n=3 and change in percent positives 161+37%, n=3. Similarly, IL-4 enhanced MR expression: change in mean intensity 179+94%, n=5 and change in percent positives 133+49%, n=5. APP SP-A did not alter receptor expression for the CRs. To assess SP-A's effect on MDM MR function, MDMs were adhered to a substrate of APP SP-A or HSA and preincubated in the presence or absence of mannan or in the presence of anti-MR Ab or normal rabbit serum control. Subsequently, Erdman M.tb or unopsonized zymosan particles (bound by MR) was added. After washing and fixation, the number of bacteria or zymosan particles per MDM was enumerated. APP SP-A enhanced adherence of Erdman M.tb (66%, n=5) and this effect was completely inhibited by both mannan and anti- MR Ab . In a similar fashion, APP SP-A enhanced adherence of zymosan particles (83%, n = 2) and mannan abolished the effect. MDM adherence of IgG-coatcd RBCs, which bind to Fc receptors, was unaffected by either mannan or anti-MR Ab. This study demonstrates that APP SP-A enhances phagocytosis of Erdman M.tb by MDMs by upregulating both the expression and function of the macrophage MR. 17 Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxin A (SPEA) Release and Distribution In an Experimental Model of Fasciitis due to Streptococcus pyogenea S. SRISKANDAN', D. MOYES, L. BUTTERY, T. KRAUSZ, T. EVANS, J COHEN. Royal Postgraduate Medical School, UK. Cumulative evidence suggests that the production of superantigens such as SPEA by S. pyogenes may play an important pathogenic role in severe streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. Recombinant SPEA (rSPEA) causes human T cell proliferation in vitro at concentrations as low as 30ng/ml and murine splenocyte proliferation at 600ng/ml. In contrast, little is known of the production and actions of SPEA in streptococcal sepsis. We set out to evaluate the production of SPEA in vivo, in a murine model of streptococcal sepsis, and then to address the role played by this toxin. Intramuscular (i.m.) inoculation of a SPEA-producing M1T1 strain of S. pyogenes (LDgo 2x109 cfu/mouse) led to a visible thigh lesion by 8 hours, and systemic illness within 24 hours. Bacteremia was observed in 80% of infected mice, with histological evidence of multi-organ failure. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) rose to a mean level of 36.5 ng/ml (SD=65.9) 21 hours after inoculation and were highest in animals with survival less than 24 hours (p=0.01). SPEA was measured sequentially in serum, using affinity-purified rabbit anti-rSPEA antibody and standard concentrations of rSPEA in an ELISA. Levels of SPEA at 15 hours (mean 3.05g/ml, SD=1.7) and 21 hours (mean 3.66ig/ml, SD=2.09) correlated with IL-6 levels (rs=0.845, p&lt;0.01) and higher levels were associated with shorter survival (p= 0.009). Immunostaining of tissues using anti-rSPEA antibody revealed localisation of SPEA to renal tubular cells and perivenular hepatocytes. To address the role played by SPEA in this model more directly, 8004 neutralizing rabbit anti-rSPEA antibody was administered intravenously at 0 hours and 10 hours after i.m. administration of S. pyogenes. Serum SPEA levels were reduced using the antibody, but not to levels significantly below controls and no effect on survival was observed. Intravenous and intraperitoneal administration of 200tg rSPEA were not harmful and did not emulate the histological features seen in the live sepsis model. We conclude that SPEA is produced systemically during soft tissue infection with S pyogenes at concentrations sufficient to cause superantigenic effects. Increased SPEA levels correlate with IL-6 and are associated with reduced 24 hour survival. In this model, SPEA does not appear to have a dominant role in disease pathogenesis</page><page sequence="5">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 723 18 Detection of Bartonella henselae in Brain Tissue of Patients with HIV-Associated Neurological Disease. M. PATNAIK*', W.A. SCHWARTZMAN2, and J.B. PETER'. 'Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, CA; 2UCLA, Los Angeles, CA. Bartonella (Rochalimaea) henselae is a gram-negative bacterium that causes cat scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, parenchymal peliosis, relapsing bacteremia, aseptic meningitis and granulomatous disease. B. henselae-specific antibodies and DNA have also been detected in patients with HIV-associated neurological disorders. Frozen autopsy sections of brain tissue from eight HIV-positive patients with diagnoses of febrile illness or AIDS dementia, and six control patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, HIV with long-standing schizophrenia or normal brain tissue were examined for evidence of B. henselae infection using antibody index (Al) evaluation, immunofluorescence staining, and PCR. Serum and CSF samples were also taken at autopsy from five HIV-positive patients with AIDS dementia. Serum and CSF specimens were assayed for B. henselae-specific antibodies using a whole cell EIA. Als were calculated by equalizing concentrations of serum and CSF immunoglobulins. Three of the five serum/CSF pairs had elevated B. henselae-specific Als. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal B. henselae-specific antibodies. Characteristic immunofluorescence staining was observed in the brain tissue of all three B. henselae Al-positive specimens, but in none of the Al-negative specimens or controls. PCR analysis of brain sections utilizing B. henselae/quintana 16S rDNA primers was positive for amplicons of the expected size in only the three seropositive/ immunofluorescence-positive brain specimens. Sequence analysis of the PCR-positive amplicons contained gene sequences identical to B. henselae, thus confirming the presence of B. henselae-specific DNA in brain tissue of these patients with AIDS dementia. These data provide evidence that B. henselae may be associated with some neurological diseases in AIDS, although the nature of this association remains to be determined. 19 Fatal Pasteurella multocida Infection in a Newborn Due to Facial Licking by the Family Cat M.J. Gorensekl*, A. Hussain2, E. Welch2, S. Hoskins2, G. Hall3, C. Rippon2; Cleveland Clinic Florida', Broward General Medical Center2, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; The Cleveland Clinic Foundation3, Cleveland, Ohio. Pasteurella multocida is a common commensal organism in the mouths of cats and dogs which has been associated with rapidly progressive wound infections from animal bites. Rarely it has been associated with septicemia and meningitis in newborns due to non-traumatic facial licking from household pets. We report the case of a previously healthy three week old, white male infant who presented with a one day history of fever, irritability and lethargy. A septic work up was done and appropriate antibiotic therapy instituted immediately. However, within 24 hours, the child became profoundly ill with severe septic shock, DIC meningitis, purpura fulminans, refractory seizures and hypoglycemia and died within 72 hours despite all possible medical efforts. P. multocida was identified from both blood and CFS cultures. Subsequent epidemiologic history disclosed that the infant did have frequent contact with the family cats who had also likely been licking the baby's face. Because of the fatal outcome of P. multocida infection in this case, we feel it is important that pediatricians advise families with cats and dogs to avoid contact of these animal with young infants. 20 GENETIC DIVERSITY OF BORRELIA BURGDORFERI IN THE UNITED STATES. D. MATHIESEN'*, J. OLIVER2, C. KOLBERT', E. TULLSON', S. R. TELFORD, III3, J. ANDERSON4, R. LANE',D. H. PERSING'. Mayo Clinic', Rochester, MN, Georgia Southern University2, Statesboro, GA, The Harvard School of Public Health', Boston, MA, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station4, New Haven, CT, University of Califoria5, Berkeley, CA. Genetic diversity among strains of Borrelia burgdorferi is a possible explanation for the varied clinical manifestations reported for Lyme disease in the United States and worldwide. Most isolates of B. burgdorferi from the U.S., in contrast to isolates from Europe, are considered relatively homogeneous. An extensive molecular characterization of Borrelia isolates from endemic and nonendemic regions of the U.S. was carried out to determine patterns of genotypic variation among isolates of Lyme disease spirochetes. Two hundred and ten human, tick, and rodent isolates representing multiple, distinct geographic regions of the U.S. were collected and characterized on the basis of genomic macrorestriction fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR detection of the Osp A gene and 23S rDNA sequence analysis. By PFGE, spirochetal isolates from the U.S. fell into two major divisions and 8-10 subdivisions. One major division (B31 division) contains type strain B3 1, many isolates from the northeaster and Great Lakes regions of the U.S., and a few isolates from the southeastern U.S. and California. PFGE resolved members of the B31 division into six or more subdivisions, each of which contained genetically indistinguishable isolates; all of the subdivisions comprised isolates from distinct geographic regions. All of the human isolates analyzed fell within five of the six B31 subdivisions. The second major division (25015 division) contained an apparently more genetically heterogeneous population predominantly composed of isolates from more temperate climates, including isolates from California, Colorado, and the southeastern United States. All of the Borrelia isolates were reactive by Osp A PCR except for Borrelia hermsii controls and five tick isolates from the northeastern U.S. which were later shown to lack the 49 KB plasmid encoding Osp A and B. 23S sequence analysis generally supported the observation of increased genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi from temperate climates. We conclude that B. burgdorferi isolates from the United States display substantial genetic heterogeneity, rivaling that of many European isolates. Whether this diversity is also reflected in phenotypic properties of virulence, persistence, and tissue tropism is under current investigation. 21 SEROLOGIC EVIDENCE OF HUMAN GRANULOCYTIC EHRLICHIOSIS IN LYME DISEASE PATIENTS FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST. P. PANCHOLII*, J. S. BAKKEN2, M. F. FINKEL', D. H. PERSING'. Mayo Clinic', Rochester, MN, Duluth Clinic2, Duluth, MN, Midelfort Clinic3, Eau Claire, WI Ixodes dammini serves as a vector for both Borrelia burgdorferi and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE) in areas of the United States endemic for Lyme disease. I. dammini ticks infected with B. burgdorferi and Ehrlichia may transmit both pathogens separately or concurrently. One hundred seventy nine sera (collected since 1988) from patients with serologically confirmed Lyme disease (by ELISA and Western blot) from several different counties in the Great Lakes region were tested for the presence of antibodies to HGE by indirect immunofluorescence by using Ehrlichia equi as substrate. The results are summarized as follows: Duluth, MN [24/81(30%)]; Grand Rapids, MN [1/20 (5%); Marshfield, WI [3/25 (8%)]; Stevens Point, WI [2/28 (7%]; Eau Claire, WI [4/10 (40%)]; Crosby, MN [4/15 (26%)]. Of patients seroreactive for both organisms symptoms ranged from moderate to severe, including flu- like illness with malaise, recurrent fevers, weakness, myalgias, and headaches. Other complaints included antibiotic (amoxicillin) resistant "Lyme" disease, recurrent arthritis, chronic fatigue, hepatic dysfunction, unexplained seizures, encephalitis, progressive polyneuropathy, and recurrent Bell's Palsy. Some patients exhibited signs of immune suppression, including oral candidiasis, monilial skin rashes and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Conclusions: I) Exposure to the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) may be quite common among patients who are seroreactive for B. burgdorferi 2) In light of the known immunosuppressive effects of ehrlichial infection, it is possible that some of the symptoms commonly attributed to B. burgdorferi infection may in fact be excerbated by or caused by an underlying, unrecognized ehrlichial infection. 22 Identification of fecD and fecE homologs in Helicobacter pylori. P. CAO*, T.L. COVER Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville, TN. Approximately 50% of H. pylori isolates produce a cytotoxin in vitro that induces vacuolation of eukaryotic cells and that causes epithelial damage in the mouse stomach. The 3864 bp vacuolating cytotoxin gene (vacA) in tox+ strains encodes a 139 kDa protoxin that undergoes both N-terminal and C-terminal cleavage to yield the mature 87 kDa secreted cytotoxin. In this study, we sought to characterize genes that are physically linked to vacA on the H. pylori chromosome. Screening an H. pylori 60190 genomic library with a vacA probe resulted in the isolation of two overlapping 3.8 and 4.0 kb clones (Bl 13 and BI 14) containing sequences downstream from vacA. Two open reading frames (designated gene A and gene B), proceeding in the opposite orientation to vacA, were predicted from the nucleotide sequence. The 255-amino-acid gene A product was homologous to fecE (28% identity, 52% similarity), fhuC (30% identity, 53% similarity), and fepC (26% identity, 50% similarity) gene products from E. coli. The 326-amino-acid gene B product was homologous to fecD (34% identity, 59% similarity), fhuB (29% identity, 54% similarity), and fepD (32% identity, 57% similarity) gene products from E. coli. An ATP binding site was predicted by the H. pylori gene A sequence. Colony hybridizations using a gene B probe indicated the presence of homologous sequences in all 9 H. pylori strains tested. The identification of fecD and fecE homologs suggests that H. pylori may utilize a periplasmic iron transport mechanism similar to systems that have been characterized in E. coli. 23 Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) Opa, Por, and LOS Co- expressed in Escherichia coli (EC) retain native functions in vitro. G.L. GORBY"*123, A.F. EHRHARDT2, M.A. APICELLA4, C. ELKINS5, and R.F. REST". Omaha VA Medical Center, 2Creighton University, 3University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE; 4University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; 5University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; 6Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA. Understanding the pathogenesis of GC salpingitis has been hindered by the variability of GC virulence factors. GC Opa and LOS may mediate inter-GC adherence and GC/host cell attachment, while GC Por (a porin) may trigger invasion as it spontaneously inserts into host cell membranes and subsequently interacts with cytoplasmic components. Expression in EC eliminates the complications of GC phase and antigenic variation. By using blunt-ligation subcloning and co-transformation strategies, we co-expressed all three factors in EC and investigated their functionality in the foreign EC host. Co- expression of Opa and 3F11 LOS enhanced bacterial clumping, but Por plus 3F11 LOS did not (p&lt;0.01). Opa facilitated attachment to and some invasion of the human Fallopian tube organ culture model (FTOC), but Por alone did not. Dot blot analysis showed Por to be surface-exposed in EC. Por selectively enhanced vancomycin sensitivity (control MIC &gt; 256pg/ml vs 4pg/ml for Por-producer), but did not change imipenem or ciprofloxacin MICs. These data indicate that Por functions as a porin when expressed in EC. Analysis of Por surface-exposed loops that might interact with host components following porin transfer supports the presence of potential calmodulin- binding regions. Biotinylated calmodulin binds to Por in a Western blot assay. In summary, we have shown that GC Opa, Por, and the 311 LOS epitope maintain native functionality when expressed in EC. EC expressing one, two, or all three factors are valuable tools for investigating the importance of each and the possible role of calmodulin-mediated pathways in GC salpingitis.</page><page sequence="6">724 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 24 Invasive Group A Streptococcal Infection in Metropolitan Atlanta: Prominence of Pediatric Disease. CA ZURAWSKI*, MS BARDSLEY, JA ELLIOTT, B SCHWARTZ and MM FARLEY, Emory University School of Medicine, VA Medical Center, and CDC, Atlanta, GA. Rapidly progressive, life threatening, invasive disease due to group A streptococci (GAS) has received increasing attention in recent years. The incidence, spectrum of disease, and association with microbial virulence factors have not been fully defined. Active surveillance for invasive GAS was begun in 1994 in the 8 county metropolitan Atlanta area. In 1994, 123 cases of GAS (isolated from normally sterile sites) were identified, for an incidence of 5 cases per 100,000/yr. The incidence in blacks was 8.9/100,000/yr, representing a 3-fold increase over whites. Sixty-two (50.4%) were male and the mean age of patients was 40 years (range 0-97 years). Twenty-one percent were &lt;5 yo (including 9 cases &lt; I yo), 53% 18-65 yo, and 21% &gt;65 yo. S. pyogenes was isolated from the blood in 95% of cases. The remaining 5% were from joints, peritoneum, soft tissue and bone. Common clinical syndromes were primary bacteremia, cellulitis, pneumonia, and septic arthritis. In 6 pediatric cases, an association with varicella was noted. Two cases of necrotizing fasciitis and one case of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome were reported. Mortality was 11.4% and 12/14 deaths occurred in adults. GAS isolates were collected from 7/1/94-12/31/94. Of the 61 cases of invasive disease which occurred during this period, 43 (70%) isolates were available for further study. Seventeen (40%) of the isolates were M typable. The most common M type was Ml (47%) followed by M12 (29.4%). Among the 26 M nontypahle (MNT) strains, the most common T types were T12 (30.7%) and T3,13,B complex (19.3%). The gene for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (speA) was detected in 26% of isolates and speC in 17%. Six of seven M1 isolates contained speA. All isolates containing speC were MNT. No association between M-type and clinical syndrome was noted. Population- based surveillance for invasive GAS revealed a wide range of clinical presentations, often in young children. Further study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of GAS is essential for more effective intervention strategies. 25 Phenotypic Variation ofStaphylococcus epidennidis Hemagglutinin Expression in-vitro. M. E. RUPP*, J. HAN. The University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the preeminent cause of nosocomial bacteremia and prosthetic device infection. In this study hemagglutinin production, which may influence adherence and hence virulence, is shown to vary with a number of other traits. Upon serial passage of S. epidermidis strain SE5 in trypticase soy broth, hemagglutination-negative variants were noted to emerge with a frequency of 1.15 x 10'. Further characterization of 4 hemagglutination-negative variants revealed they were deficient in biofilm production as shown by their appearance on Congo Red agar and the spectrophotometric microtiter plate assay (mean OD @ 570nm 6.7 vs. 0.105). The 4 variants showed a significant decrease (mean decrease 45%) in adherence to intravascular catheters as measured in an in-vitro radiolabeled bacteria adherence assay. The variants were identical to the parent strain with regard to biochemical reaction patterns, susceptibility to methicillin and penicillin, plasmid profile, and SmaI restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of chromosomal DNA by Contour-Clamped Homogenous-Field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis. All variants demonstrated the capacity to shift back to the original hemagglutination-positive phenotype. We propose that SE5 undergoes phase variation of hemagglutinin expression and a number of other phenotypic traits. The genotypic regulation of this phenomenon and environmental regulatory signals are unknown. We hypothesize that this phenotypic variation may relate to bacterial adherence and hence the pathogenesis of prosthetic medical device infection. 26 Spacious phagosomes (SP) formation within mouse macrophages correlates with Salmonellae serotype pathogenicity and host susceptibility. Celia M.Alpuche-Aranda,*Y, Eric P. Berthiaume,**, B. Mock+, Joel A. Swanson** and Samuel I. Miller*. * Infectious Diseases Unit Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. ** Dept. of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston MA, + Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute. NIH, Bethesda MD. Y Present address: Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Mexico D.F. Salmonella serotypes produce different diseases in different host species. In addition, the importance of host factors in Salmonella pathogenesis has been demonstrated by studying the susceptibility variation of inbred mice to S. typhimurium. Pathophysiology of mouse and human typhoid fever suggest that bacterial survival within macrophages is essential to pathogenesis. Morphologic studies have demonstrated that S. typhimurium stimulates diffuse membrane ruffling and macropinocylosis by macrophages from ltysand Lpsd mice. Bacteria enter mouse macrophages in loose-fitting organelles called SP. There is also some evidence that SP formation correlates with bacterial intracellular survival. In this work we have studied the ability of mouse macrophages to form SP when they are infected with Salmonella serotypes that do not induce typhoid fever in mice. In addition we have examined SP formation in macrophages from Salmonella-resistant mice. Light video microscopic and quantitative fluorescent studies indicated that Salmonella serotypes non-pathogenic for mice induced less membrane ruffling, macropinocytosis and SP formation in macrophages from BALB/c mice, that S. typhimurium. The human specific S. typhi and the reptile specific S. arizonae induced fewer SP, while the avian specific serotype S. pullorum induced almost none. SP formation by these serotypes correlated both with their survival within mouse macrophages and their reported lethality for mice. Further studies indicated that macrophages from different mice responded differently to S. typhimurium infection. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from S. typhimurium-resistant outbred (CD-I) mice were not observed to initiate generalized macropinocytosis after bacterial infection and formed markedly fewer SP than those from BALB/c mice. These deficiencies did not correlate with the Ity resistance genotype of CD-1 mice, as macrophages from mice that were congenic except for the Ity locus demonstrated equal membrane ruffling, macropinocytosis, and SP formation in response to S. typhimurium. The observation that S. typhimurium- resistant CD-I mice are deficient in the ability to form SP indicates a variable host component related to SP formation and suggests that the ability to induce or form SP affects susceptibility to S. typhimurium. These studies further indicate that host and bacterial factors contribute to SP formation and maintenance which correlates with Salmonellae intracellular survival and the ability to cause lethal typhoid fever. 27 Infectious Complications of Lung Transplantation (LTx) in Children with Cystic Fibrosis. MG MICHAELS, G KURLAND, FJ FRICKER, DM ORENSTEIN, L CIPRIANI, JM ARMITAGE, M ORTENZO, ER WALD. Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP), Univ of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. Patients undergoing LTx experience substantial rates of morbidity and mortality from infectious complications. Death due to infection occurred 6/8 CF LTx recipients compared to 4/11 non-CF LTx deaths. Accordingly we reviewed our experience with 12 CF-LTx recipients (median age 12.5 years, range 9-18 years) with emphasis on microbial colonization, serology and patient outcome. All CF children undergoing LTx (N=12) required supplemental oxygen prior to LTx, and 6 were wheel chair bound. Each child was colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3/12 harbored multi-drug resistant strains. Other colonization was with Burkholderia cepacia (formerly P. cepacia) (3), Xanthomonas maltophilia (2) Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (2), and Aspergillus spp (6). Ten children were CMV seronegative 5 of whom received organs from CMV seropositive donors. Five patients were EBV seronegative. Serious infection occurred in 11/12 patients. Six children had bacteremia with organisms that had colonized the airways pre-LTx; P. aeruginosa (2), B. cepacia (3) A. xylosoxidans (1). Four of these episodes occurred perioperatively and contributed to death in 3 patients. Aspergillus pneumonia was diagnosed by biopsy in two patients; a third died with disseminated aspergillosis. CMV disease occurred in 3 previously seronegative children. EBV lymphoproliferative disorder arose in 2 naive hosts. Two children died with adenovirus pneumonitis shortly after LTx. Infections are a major challenge after LTx for CF. Based on this experience patients with organisms resistant to all licensed antibiotics or B. cepacia are not considered candidates for LTx. Prophylactic antimicrobial strategies based on pre-LTx screening are under current investigation. 28 M Protein and Hyaluronic Acid Capsule Both Contribute to the Capacity of Mucoid Group A Streptococci to Resist Phagocytic Killing in Human Blood. A.E. MOSES,l* K. ZALCMAN, I S. YARON, T. MENES,I M.R. WESSELS,2 and E. HANSKI. IThe Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel, and 2Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. Virulence of group A streptococci (GAS) has been attributed both to M protein and to the hyaluronic acid capsule. In previous studies of an acapsular mutant derived from a mucoid or highly encapsulated strain of GAS, we found that loss of capsule expression was associated with loss of resistance to phagocytosis in human blood. In other strains of GAS, M protein appears to be essential for the organisms to grow in human blood. To determine whether M protein, as well as capsule, is required for a highly encapsulated strain of GAS to resist phagocytosis, we inactivated the M protein gene in the same mucoid strain of GAS used previously to derive an acapsular mutant. An internal fragment of the gene encoding M protein (emm.18) was cloned in a temperature- sensitive shuttle vector. The plasmid carrying the incomplete emm.18 gene was introduced into the mucoid M type 18 GAS strain 282. Growth of strain 282 harboring the plasmid at the restrictive temperature in the presence of antibiotic selection resulted in integration of the plasmid in the chromosome and inactivation of the emm.18 gene. Southern hybridization analysis confirmed the presence of the plasmid insertion at the expected site in the 282 chromosome. The mutant strain, designated 282KZ, did not produce type 18 M protein, as assessed by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion of Lancefield extracts, but expressed wild type amounts of hyaluronic acid capsule. In three independent experiments, parent strain 282 grew in fresh human blood (mean of 5.9- fold increase in cfu during a 3 hour incubation) while the M-protein mutant strain 282KZ decreased in number in each experiment. As loss of either capsule or M protein expression was associated with an impaired ability of strain 282 to grow in human blood, we conclude that both hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein contribute to the capacity of mucoid GAS to resist phagocytosis. 29 Salmonella dublin Plasmid Virulence Genes (spv) Are Not Expressed Under Anaerobic Conditions. J. FIERER,* C.Y. CHIN, F. FANG, and D. GUINEY. U.C. San Diego School of Medicine, V.A. Medical Center, San Diego, CA and the U. of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. S. dublin carries a virulence plasmid that is responsible for the syndrome of salmonella septicemia. The plasmid, and similar plasmids which are found in other invasive, non-typhoid salmonella, contains a five gene regulon (spv) that is respon- sible for virulence. We have shown previously that spy A and B are not constitutively expressed, but expression is induced by nutrient starvation, and inside mammalian cells. We have also shown that inducible expression is under the control of rpoS, an alternate sigma factor. To determine whether spvA was expressed under anaerobic conditions, we constructed a lacZ fusion and measured 8-galactosidase activity compared to aerobic bacteria. Stationary phase cells grown without oxygen had only 5% of the SpvA::LacZ fusion activity compared to bacteria cultured under aerobic conditions. When rpoS was provided in trans under the control of the arabinose promotor, spvA was expressed both aerobically and anaerobically when rpoS was induced, but not under non-induced conditions. These experiments show that spy genes are not expressed under anaerobic conditions, due to limiting rpoS activity, suggesting that rpoS is oxygen-regulated. This is another example of the complex regulation of salmonella virulence genes, and illustrates how the organism adapts to changing environments in the body.</page><page sequence="7">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 725 30 The Effect of Antibiotics on the Endotoxin Concentration of Human Pus Containing Aerobic Gram Negative Bacilli (GNB). R.C. CROUSE and RE. BRYANT.* Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Or. There is clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that certain antibiotics may enhance release of endotoxin from GNB and augment inflammation and tissue injury (J Infect Dis 168:657. 1993; Antimicrob Agents and Chemother 38:1211,1994). Theoretically this should occur maximally in pus which contains high concentrations of bacteria. The present study examined the concentration of bacteria and endotoxin in I ml of GNB infected human pus immediately before and six hours after the addition of 5g ciprofloxacin (Cip), 5.g gentamicin (Gent), 20pg imipenem (Imp), or 20.g ceftazidime (Ctz). Bacteria were counted by dilution and plating methods and endotoxin concentrations were determined by the BioWhittaker QCL-1000 Chromogenic LAL assay method after dilution and passage through a 0.2pm Coming filter. Pus samples were either tested as received, tested after an addition of 8 log,, GNB, or tested after an 18 hour incubation with 8 log, E. coli ATCC 25922. The mean?SD of GNB in seven infected pus specimens was 7.3?7 6 logi, CFU/ml and the mean?SD endotoxin concentration was 3.3?5.6x 1 O4 ng/ml Endotoxin Release From Unmodified Pus Infected With GNB Logl, CFUhnl Endotoxin ng/ml 0 hour 6 hour 0 hour 6 hour Cip 7.8 6.7 21,000 17,000 (ient 7.9 7.3 22,000 29,000 Imp _ 7.8 70 20,000 22,000 Ctz ND ND 24.000 20.000 Pus specimens inoculated with 8 log, CFtJ/ml GNB and then incubated with antibiotics had a reduction of 1.7 log,0 CFU/ml of bacteria and an increase in endotoxin concentration of 13.5-fold. E. coli incubated in pus for 18 hours prior to addition of antibiotics had a reduction of less than 0.3 log,, CFU/ml and an increase in endotoxin concentration of only 1.3-fold. The variability ol endotoxin assay results was 30.8?13% on untreated specimens run concomitantly Certain abscesses contain high concentrations of GNB and endotoxin. Bactericidal activity is profoundly suppressed and antibiotics minimally affect endotoxin levels in the abscess environment in part because bacterial growth is reduced and endoloxin concentrations are high. These observations add further insight into the multiple advantages of abscess drainage. Supported by a grant from Bayer 31 Non-opsonic Phagocytosis of Nisseria meningitidis by Human Neutrophils (PMN). M. ESTABROOK', R. BRADY and M. BERGER. Case Wester Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. Recent work suggests that killing of Nesseria meningitidis (NM) by PMN might be a more important host defense than previously recognized, particularly in the non-immune infant. While phagocytosis of opsonized NM has been well studied, few data exist on non-opsonic phagocytosis, a well documented mechanism for gonococci. Most group B and C NM express lipooligosaccharide (LOS) molecules that contain the terminal structure, lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) that binds monoclonal antibody 1B2. LNnT is the major site of sialylation of LOS and addition of sialic acid blocks the binding of 1B2. We previously reported that resistance of opsonized group C NM strains to phagocytic killing by neutrophils correlated directly with the degree of sialylation of LNnT. To determine if group C strains were susceptible to non-opsonic phagocytosis, we used a serum-free human PMN phagocytosis assay. We found that 4 of 10 strains were phagocytosed and these were among the least endogenously sialylated. Mean survival at 60 min. for the 4 strains was 29 + 17% for non-opsonic phagocytosis vs. 14 + 14% with opsonins. Exogenous sialylation of LOS by growth in cytidine monophospho--acetyineuraminic acid (CMP-NANA), as confirmed by decreased 1B2 binding, increased the resistance of the strains to non-opsonic phagocytosis. Survival increased from 30% to 65% (p = 0.02), 32?% to 54% (p = 0.008), 24% to 34% (p = 0.07), and 30%P to 37% (NS) for the 4 strains (n=3 assays; paired t-test). Because preliminary studies suggested that exposure of some NM to PMN resulted in diminished 1B2 binding, we proposed that activated PMN might release products that resulted in exogenous sialylation of LOS. We found that treatment of NM with a filtered superatant (SN) from f-Met- Leu-Phe activated PMN reduced 1B2 binding to the organisms and enhanced survival in non-opsonic phagocytic assays from 37% to 72%. Although CMP inhibited the sialyltransferase-mediated exogenous sialylation of the LOS of the organisms, it had no effect on the decreased 1B2 binding caused by the SN. This suggests that the decrease in 1B2 binding and resistance to non-opsonic phagocytosis was not due to sialylation of LOS. We conclude that some NM strains, like gonococci, are highly susceptible to non-opsonic phagocytosis but resistance may be acquired due to decreased availability of LNnT whether by exogenous sialylation or by interaction with products of activated PMN. The mechanism by which PMN products inhibit non-opsonic phagocytosis of NM remains to be elucidated. 32 ENTEROCOCCAL BACTEREMIA IN LIVER TRANSPLANTATION RECIPIENTS. Robin Patel, Andrew D. Badley, Jeffrey Larson-Keller, William S. Harmsen, Duane M. Ilstrup, Russell H. Wiesner, Jeffrey L. Steers, Ruud A.F. Krom, Daniel Portela, Carlos V. Paya. Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN. We performed a study to describe clinical characteristics of, and risk factors for, enterococcal bacteremia in 405 liver transplantation recipients. Seventy enterococcal bacteremias in 52 patients were identified. All patients were given a selective bowel decontamination regimen consisting of gentamicin, polymyxin E and nystatin. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (50) outnumbered Enterococcus faecium isolates (18). Forty-nine percent of enterococcal bacteremias were polymicrobial. Thirty-two percent of enterococcal bacteremias were associated with biliary tree complications. There were nine deaths (17%) amongst the patients with enterococcal bacteremia; three were directly associated with enterococcal bacteremia. By univariate analysis, underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis [Relative risk (RR), 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.9; P=0.009], the presence of a Roux-Y choledochojejunostomy [RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.3; P=0.003], a positive donor cytomegalovirus serology [RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.3; P=0.014], prolonged transplantation time [RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2; P=0.004], symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection [RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.4; P=0.008], and biliary stricturing [RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-9.3; P=0.005) were identified as risk factors for enterococcal bacteremia following primary liver transplantation. In conclusion, enterococcal bacteremia occurred in 12% of liver transplantation recipients at our institution; risk factors for enterococcal bacteremia included primary sclerosing cholangitis, a Roux-Y choledochojejunostomy, a positive donor cytomegalovirus scrology, prolonged transplantation time, biliary stricturing, symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection and possibly the use of a selective bowel decontamination regimen. 33 A Cluster of Acute Encephalopathy Associated with Cat Scratch Disease in South Florida. D.L. NOAH1, J.S. BRESEE', M.J. GORENSEK2*, et al; CDC', Atlanta, Georgia; Cleveland Clinic Florida2, Fort Lauderdale, Florida From August 12 through September 27, 1994, five children in South Florida were hospitalized with acute encephalopathy, presenting as status epilepticus, associated with cat scratch disease (CSD). These represent the first cluster of CSD encephalopathy (CSDE) to be recognized in the United States. The patients lived within seven miles of each other and all reported contact with pet or stray cats before developing regional lymphadenopathy and encephalopathy. All recovered fully. Diagnoses were confirmed by using an indirect fluorescent-antibody test to detect antibody to Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of CSD. Subsequent active surveillance of the local medical community identified only 28 additional cases of non-encephalopathic CSD, suggesting an unusually high ratio of CSDE to uncomplicated CSD cases (15%), possibly due to a phenotypically unique strain more likely to cause encephalopathy. Epidemiologic studies of animals in the area identified 77 of 124 cats to be seropositive for B. henselae (62%) and 27 of 124 cats to be bacteremic (22%). This study suggests that Bartonella henselae may cause geographically focal clusters of CSDE which may otherwise be classified as encephalopathy of unknown etiology. 34 Contribution of Capsule and 04 Polysaccharide to Urovirulence in Escherichia coli. J.R. JOHNSON*, J.J. BROWN, and T.A. RUSSO. University of Minnesota, Mpls., MN, and SUNY at U.B., Buffalo, NY. Capsule (K) and 0-specific antigens (e.g. 04) are virulence factors in E. coli, but their specific contributions to bladder and kidney infection are unknown. We evaluated established isogenic knockout mutants for K, 04, and K plus 04 (derived from an 04:K54:H5 septicemic E. coli strain by transposon mutagenesis and T4 transduction) in a mouse model of ascending UTI. Mice were sacrificed 48h after transurethral bacterial challenge under nonrefluxing conditions (4-5 mice per experiment) for quantitative culture and histopathology. Results: 10 -1--04:K54 C 12 56 789 10 5 789 10 LoglO Inoculum Concentration Conclusions: The K- mutant was nearly as virulent in both bladder and kidney infection as was the parent, whereas the K-, 04- mutant was substantially less virulent throughout the dose range. This suggests that K is not requred for full urovirulence when 04 is present, but that 04 is required for urovirulence when K is absent. Studies are ongoing with the 04 mutant to determine whether 04 is required for full urovirulence when K is present. 35 Binding Specificities of Escherichia coli Pap Variants: a Reassessment. J.R. JOHNSON*, T.J. BARELA. Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis. MN. Introduction &amp; Methods: P fimbriae of uropathogenic E. coli require Gal(a I-4)Gal for binding, but exhibit different receptor specificities. "Class I" variants ostensibly bind best to GbOse3, "Class II" variants to GbOse4, and "Class IIl" variants to structures with a terminal GalNac(al-3). To test this model, we did quantitative hemagglutination (HA) (on ice, if negative at 21?) with "type" strains for Class I, II, and llpap adhesins, using rabbit. sheep, and human A PI,A2PI,OPI,OPK2, and p RBC. Pigeon eggwhite (containing Gal(al -4)Gal) was used for HA inhibition.

Pigeon eggwhite blocked all HA (including of p RBC), indicating Gal(al -4)Gal specificity. A mutant ofpupGIA2 was HA- for all RBC types, including p. Conclusions: Binding preferences of pap variants overlap inore than per the "Class I-II-III" model. "Class II" variants recogni/c (with varying intensity) an undefined Gal(al-4)Gal receptor on p erythrocytes, and exhibit marked HA affinity differences for rabbit vs. human opk2 RBC, despite their similar GbOse3 contents.</page><page sequence="8">726 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 36 Recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae in Culture of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Specimens from Immunosuppressed Patients with Pulmonary Infiltrates. M. E. BIRCH*, M. GOLDMAN, A.I. HARTSTEIN, B. VAN DER POL, C.A. GAYDOS and R.B. JONES. Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN. and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) has been identified as a respiratory pathogen in young adults. The role of CP in respiratory infections in other populations has not been clearly established. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from patients with known or suspected immunosuppression and possible pulmonary infections were cultured for CP. Specimens from 88 patients at 3 hospitals of one medical center were cultured. CP was isolated from 31 (35%) of these 88 patients studied from October, 1994 - March, 1995. CP was confirmed using a PCR assay with CP specific primers in 14 of 15 tested samples. Clinical information was available for 22 of the 31 patients with positive CP cultures. The underlying conditions of the patients were AIDS (10), solid organ transplant (3) , immunosuppressive medications (3), cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer (2), hypogammaglobulinemia (1), bone marrow transplant (1), severe liver disease (1), and injectable drug use (1). CP was the only respiratory pathogen identified in 12, while other possible or definite pathogens were recovered in 10. Focal infiltrates by chest x-ray were seen in 10 of the 12 patients with only CP isolated. Of the 22 patients with available clinical information, 16 had symptoms or signs of pulmonary disease present prior to or within the first 4 days of admission. For the remaining 6 patients who developed respiratory illness &gt; 4 days after hospitalization, no evidence of epidemiologic clustering was found. Our finding of a 35% recovery of CP from this patient population may indicate that CP infection is more prevalent in immunocompromised patients than previously recognized. Additional studies are required to fully define the pathogenic role of CP. 37Hypertriglyceridemia and its relationship to Mycobacterium avium Diagnosis and Death from AIDS. J.D. Richardson* and M.A. Pierce. Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. The growth of Mycobacterium avium (MAC) has been shown to be enhanced in vitro in cultured macrophages by Fe3' and hypertriglyceridemic sera. Hypertriglyceridemia (HyperTG) is a common finding in AIDS patients and appears to cor- relate with interferon-alpha levels. It was hypothesized that hyperTG may affect MAC growth in patients and impact patient survival. Retrospective chart analysis identified 49 patients (CD4 &lt; 50) who, were MAC culture positive and 12 CD4 matched patients who were MAC culture negative. 100 % of MAC positive patients had hyperTG (TG &gt;200 mg/dl); 80 % (32/40) of MAC positive patients with triglycerides obtained before the diagnosis of MAC had hyperTG occurring at a mean of 3.97 months before diagnosis of MAC. 50 % of control patients (6/12) had hyperTG; MAC cultures were negative ranging from 2-10 months in the control group (average 4.6 months). Subgroup analysis of the MAC infected group identified 14 long term survivors (&gt;12 months with MAC) and 11 short term survivors (death within 6 months of MAC diagnosis). All MAC patients were on anti-MAC therapy. HyperTG was present in 59 % of monthly blood samples (42/71) of long term survivors compared to 84 % (22/26) short term survivors. Many factors, however, determine long term survival with MAC. Long term survivors mean survival was 13.9 months compared to 3.36 months for short term survivors. HyperTG and MAC are associated with shortened survival in AIDS. Identification of HyperTG in patients with CD4 &lt;50 may be useful in identifying patients at increased risk of MAC. 38 Binding of Human Plasminogen to Borrelia burgdorferi: Identification of a 70kDa Binding Protein. L.T. HU, G. PERIDES, R. NORING, M.S. KLEMPNER*. New England Medical Center, Boston, MA Receptors for plasmin(ogen) have been described on macrophages, tumor cells and bacterial species such as group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and certain enteric gram negative rods. The ability of plasmin to act as a serine protease with broad substrate activity has led to the hypothesis that it may play a role in the spread of cells by facilitating the digestion of extracellular matrix proteins. We studied the binding of plasminogen to Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete which causes Lyme disease. Using casein or chromogenic P as a substrate, we found that plasminogen bound to the surface of B. burgdorferi could be activated to plasmin by human urokinase-type plasminogen activator. 1251-labeled plasminogen bound to B. burgdorferi in a specific and inhibitable manner, with inhibition of 65 and 90 percent by unlabeled plasminogen and the lysine analog e-aminocaproic acid (EACA). Inhibition by EACA suggests that lysine binding sites on plasminogen mediate binding to the spirochete. 1251-labeled plasminogen ligand blots of borrelial membrane proteins demonstrated two prominent binding proteins: at -70 and -30 kDa. Outer surface protein A (Osp A) has previously been reported to bind plasminogen; by Western blot, we confirmed the 30 kDa protein to be Osp A. Using scanning densitometry, the 70kDa band bound &gt;10 times the 125I-labeled plasminogen of the Osp A. An Osp A-deficient mutant of B. burgdorferi bound an equal amount of 1251- labeled plasminogen compared to wild type B. burgdorferi. Ligand blots of membrane proteins from an Osp A deficient mutant showed association of 125I-labeled plasminogen with only the 70kDa protein. By two dimensional gel electrophoresis, the 70kDa protein had a pi of -5.3 and was clearly separable from Osp A. In summary, the binding of human plasminogen to B. burgdorferi appears to be specific and mediated by lysine binding sites on plasminogen which are also responsible for the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and other bacteria. There appear to be two main plasminogen binding proteins: Osp A and a 70kDa protein. Binding appeared greatest to the 70kDa protein and loss of Osp A did not affect the ability of B. burgdorferi to bind plasminogen. Although B. burgdorferi has the ability to spread through skin and disseminate widely, it produces no endogenous proteases. We believe that the binding of plasminogen to B. burgdorferi may be important because it provides the spirochete with a mechanism for digestion of extracellular matrix proteins and dissemination from an inoculation site. 39 Chlamydia pneumoniae(TWAR) in Alaska Natives with Coronary Atheroma. M DAVIDSON*125, CC KUO3, JP MIDDAUGH4, LA CAMPBELL3' SP WANG3, JC FINLEY5, WP NEWMAN6' JT GRAYSTON3. 1.University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK 2.Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD 3.University of Washington, Seattle, WA 4.Alaska Division of Public Health, Anchorage, AK 5.Alaska Native Medical Center, Anchorage, AK 6.Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA Chlamydia pneumoniae(TWAR) has been demonstrated within macrophages of coronary artery atheroma and seroepidemiologic evidence suggests TWAR infection is associated with coronary artery disease. Using immunocytochemistry (ICC) with TWAR-specific monoclonal antibody and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TWAR specific primers, we examined forensic autopsy specimens from 60 Alaska Natives (Eskimos, Aleuts, Indians), a low risk population for coronary artery disease. Subjects' mean age at autopsy was 35 years (range 15-57 years) and 92%(55) of deaths were considered unrelated to heart disease or atherosclerosis. TWAR was identified in atheroma from 23(38%) subjects either by PCR (15, 25%) or ICC (20, 33%). The presence of TWAR antigen was unrelated to subject age, or established cause of death. TWAR-specific IgG antibody was identified by microimmunofluoresence in stored serum specimens obtained from 55 subjects 1 to 18 years prior to autopsy. The proportion of subjects with IgG and IgA antibody at &gt;1:8 was 87% and 62% and at &gt;1:128 was 67% and 13% respectively; only 3% had IgM antibody &gt;1:8. Previous infection with TWAR will be correlated with grade of atheroma and PCR and ICC results. These findings extend previous observations of TWAR infections and coronary artery disease. 40 CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES AMONG PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA CLINICAL ISOLATES. RA Miller, MA Pfaller, BE Britigan. Research Service, VA Medical Center, Iowa City, IA and Depts. of Medicine and Pathology, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), in addition to being subject to endogenous oxidative stress from aerobic metabolism, is placed under greater oxidative stress in the human host as a result of the intense infiltration of oxidant-producing neutrophils which accompany its infections. Like other bacteria, it is known that laboratory strains PA contain antioxidant enzymes: catalase and two forms of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD and FeSOD). The form of SOD expressed varies with growth conditions (Hassett, Infect. Immun. 60:328-336, 1992). However, a detailed analysis of these enzymes among PA clinical isolates is lacking. Therefore, further characterization PA-derived SOD and catalase from clinical isolates was studied with emphasis on the site of PA isolation and varying in vitro growth conditions. Forty-one PA isolates previously obtained from predominantly bloodstream, urinary tract, and respiratory tract sites were studied. Cell extracts containing SOD and catalase were prepared from organisms grown to mid-logarithmic phase in tryptic soy broth (TSB) or an iron-limited succinate media (SM). These extracts were electrophoresed on a 12% or 8% polyacrylamide native protein gel following which the gel was stained for SOD or catalase activity, respectively. Band intensity was quantitated by gel spectrometry. SOD activity was attributed to FeSOD by its ability to be inhibited by H202. MnSOD activity was defined by its resistance to NaCN and H2O2 inactivation. When grown in TSB, all 41 isolates exhibited FeSOD as the predominant SOD form in similar quantities. However, when the same isolates were grown in SM, MnSOD became the predominant form expressed. Two different migration patterns of MnSOD among the isolates were observed which has not been previously described. TSB grown isolates demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively similar catalase activities. However, the same isolates grown in SM showed a 36-56% decrease in catalase activity. Sixteen paired mucosal and bloodstream isolates from 8 patients revealed no significant differences based on site of PA isolation. These data support that PA clinical isolates demonstrate alterate SOD forms and varying catalase activities in response to stress evoked by iron-limited growth conditions. Since PA exists in an iron-limited environment at sites of human infection, these findings further define its oxidative stress defense strategy in a clinical context. 41 Association of Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor-1 with Escherichia coli from Urinary Tract Infections in Men. A.E. STAPLETON*, H.A. LOCKMAN, A.D. O'BRIEN, W.E STAMM. University of Washington, Seattle, WA and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD. Although epidemiological studies of E. coli isolates producing cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF-1) conducted exclusively in Europe demonstrate an association between isolates producing this toxin and human extraintestinal infections, including urinary tract infection (UTI), little is known about the clinical syndromes of UTI associated with CNF-1- producing strains. We collected 158 E. coli isolates from four groups of patients and probed them with a BssHII fragment of pHLK102 encoding cnf-1, with the following results (proportion and % positive): (1) women with uncomplicated pyelonephritis (10/36; 28%); (2) women with first-episode uncomplicated cystitis (10/40; 25%); (3) men presenting to a STD clinic with lower UTI (20/42; 48%); and (4) fecal isolates from women with no history of UTI (9/40; 22%). Isolates from men with lower UTI were significantly more likely to hybridize with the cnf-1 probe as compared with fecal isolates from women (P = .02) or strains from women with UTI (P = .02). In addition, the overall prevalence of hybridization with the cnf-1 probe among these UTI isolates (32%) was less than the previously reported prevalence of the CNF-1 phenotype among European isolates from UTI, determined by tissue culture bioassay (37%-50%). Among the strains hybridizing with the cnf-1 probe, 94% also produced hemolysin. We conclude that among UTI isolates, CNF-1 was significantly more prevalent among strains from men presenting with lower UTI than in other groups tested.</page><page sequence="9">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 727 42 Uropathogenic Escherichia coli Bind with Highest Affinity to the Globo-series Glycosphingolipid Sialosyl Galactosyl Globoside. A.E. STAPLETON*, M.R. STROUD, S.I. HAKOMORI, W.E STAMM. University of Washington and The Biomembrane Institute, Seattle, WA. Women with a history of recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infections (UTIs) are significantly more likely to be nonsecretors of histo-blood group antigens than are women without such a history and vaginal epithelial cells (VEC) from nonsecretor women show enhanced adherence of uropathogenic E. coli compared with cells from secretors. We previously extracted GSLs from native VEC and determined that nonsecretors (but not secretors) selectively express two extended globo-series GSLs, sialosyl gal-globoside (SGG) and disialosyl gal-globoside (DSGG), which specifically bound uropathogenic E. coli R45 expressing P-related adhesins. In this study, we determined that SGG and DSGG are expressed in human kidney tissue by purifying the compounds from this source and we demonstrated that these GSLs bind cloned and wild-type P-related adhesin-expressing uropathogenic E. coli, including cloned isolates expressing appJ96, pap-2j96, and 2papA2 and the wild type isolates IA2 and R45. We radiolabeled these five E. coli isolates and measured their relative binding affinities to serial dilutions of SGG and DSGG as well as to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4), two other globo-series GSLs present in urogenital tissues. Each of the 5 isolates bound to SGG with the highest affinity as compared with DSGG, Gb3 and Gb4 and each isolate had a unique pattern of GSL binding affinity. We conclude that SGG plays an important role in uropathogenesis and its presence may account for the increased binding of E. coli to uroepithelial cells from nonsecretors and for their increased susceptibility to recurrent UTI. 43 Induction of Serum Interleukin-l B (IL-1B) by a Lethal Dose of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) a- Toxin in a Murine Model. B.E. MENZIES' and D.S. KERNODLE. Vanderbilt Univ. Sch. of Med. and VA Med. Ctr., Nashville, TN. Staphylococcal a-toxin is a membrane-damaging exoprotein produced by most pathogenic strains of SA and is considered a major virulence determinant. The mechanisms involved in the acute lethal action of a- toxin are unknown. To characterize the effect of purified, endotoxin- free preparations of a-toxin on the inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-BI, we injected mice intraperitoneally with: Ilj a lethal dose (51jg) of wild-type toxin (WT; LD5,= 1 jg); 121 a sublethal WT dose (0.5 jg); or 131 5 ig of a non-hemolytic, non-lethal a-toxin mutant H35L constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned a-toxin gene (Infect Immun 1994; 62:1843). Serum was collected from groups of 5-8 mice at timed intervals and assayed for IL-I1 and TNF- a by ELISA. Mean IL-1S levels (pg/ml) Toxin 0.5hr 1 hr 2 hr 4 hr 6 hr WT 5 ig 25 55 997 -expired- WT 0.5 ig 11 &lt; 6 &lt; 6 &lt; 6 &lt;6 H35L 5 ig &lt; 6 &lt; 6 &lt; 6 &lt; 6 &lt;6 TNF levels in each set of toxin-treated mice did not rise significantly above basal levels compared to that of control mice (&lt; 30 pg/ml) at any time point. We conclude that IL-1B is induced by a lethal dose of WT but not by a comparable amount of H35L toxin or a sublethal dose of WT. The induction of IL-1B by SA a-toxin may play a role in the pathophysiologic events that result in lethality. 44 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lipoarabinomannan- Induced Upregulation of HIV-1 Expression Is Inhibited by Thalidomide. G. GEKKER,* M. BORNEMANN, D. CHATTERJEE, C.C. CHAO, and P.K. PETERSON. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN and Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. Although it is well established that HIV infection promotes the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, it has been proposed that M. tuberculosis also accelerates the progression of HIV infection. Previously, M. tuberculosis was shown to induce the upregulation of HIV-1 expression in the chronically infected promonocyte line U 1 via a tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)-related mechanism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a mycobacterial cell wall virulence factor which is known to induced TNFa release from macrophages, would upregulate HIV-1 expression in U 1 cells (assessed by quantifying HIV-1 p24 antigen [Ag] levels in day 4 culture superatants). Addition of ManLAM, which had been isolated from the virulent M. tuberculosis Erdman strain, to U1 cells (5 x 103 cells/well) stimulated in a dose-dependent manner the expression of HIV-1 (maximal stimulation was observed with 200 gg ManLAM: 1085 ? 91 pg p24 Ag/ml vs &lt; 50 pg p24 Ag/ml in unstimulated cells and 1824 ? 181 pg p24 Ag/ml in U1 cells stimulated with 10 pg/ml TNFa as a positive control). Treatment of Ul cells with thalidomide or dexamethasone, drugs which are known to suppress TNFoa production by monocytes, dose-dependently suppressed the upregulation of HIV- 1 by ManLAM. At the highest concentrations tested, thalidomide (100 jgg/ml) and dexamethasone (10-6 M) inhibited HIV-1 expression by 99% and 35%, respectively. Upregulation of HIV-1 expression was also markedly inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to TNFa and to CD14 receptors (the putative monocyte receptor for LAM) but was not supressed by anti-IL-6 antibodies. The results of this in vitro study support the concept of a reciprocal relationship between HIV and M. tuberculosis and suggest that drugs which block TNFo production, such as thalidomide, could have a beneficial effect in delaying the progression of HIV-1 infection that otherwise would be fostered by M. tuberculosis. 45 Predictive Value of TNF, IL-6, NO2-/NO3 and Soluble TNF Receptor Levels in Septic Shock. I. de WERRA, D. HEUMANN, S. BETZ CORRADIN, C. JACCARD, M.P. GLAUSER. CHUV Lausanne, Switzerland. The predictive role of TNF and IL-6 as markers of septic shock (SS) is debated and other markers should be looked for. We have measured TNF, IL-6, NO2 /NO13 and soluble TNF receptor (TNFR55 and 75) levels in 35 blood samples from 15 septic shock patients (SS), 12 from 7 patients with cardiogenic shock (CS), 7 from 7 patients with bacterial pneumonia (BP) and 10 from normal donors.

JJ Stavola *, CP Maeuire, &amp; GJ Noel, The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, NY, NY. Bacteremic infection caused by extracellular bacteria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children, especially those with HIV infection. Complex cellular responses within the reticulo- endothelial system are associated with bacteremic infection and certain proteins (cytokines) that mediate cell movement, proliferation and activation determine this response. IL-6 has been shown to play an integral role in mediating this response to bacterial illness. We have looked at 10 children (2 with AIDS, 1 with sickle cell disease) who were evaluated for bacterial sepsis. All were children 7 days-2 years of age with fever. Serum IL-6 levels were drawn on admission, and at 1, 2 and 14 (convalescence, when patients were afebrile) days after admission. 4/10 children had meningitis. Two had bacterial meningitis (Flavobacterium meningosepticum and E. coli). Two had aseptic meningitis. The remaining children, including two HIV infected children and one child with sickle cell disease, did not have bacteria isolated from their blood, cerebral spinal fluid, or urine. Serum IL-6 levels were measured by ELISA and are as follows: Diagnosis (i Mean serum IL-6 Levels (oa/ml DavO Davy 1Rs D2 Da14 Febrile Illness 6 2.6 1.9 2.6 1.6 Bacterial Meningitis 2 &gt;50 12.5 2.3 1.4 Aseptic Meningitis 2 8.0 1.4 -- 1.3 Initial serum IL-6 levels in patients without serious inflammatory illnesses (meningitis) were not greater than baseline levels (day 14). Patients with meningitis had elevated IL-6 levels which returned to baseline within 48 hours of treatment, even though they remained febrile and ill-appearing. Both of these children recovered without sequelae. Patients with bacterial meningitis had much higher levels of IL-6 than children with aseptic meningitis, or children with non-bacterial illnesses. Measurement of serum IL-6 levels may help distinguish children, (including HIV-infected children), with the severe infection from those with less severe infections. These levels may be markedly elevated in children with severe infections due to extracellular bacteria and may return to normal levels rapidly during successful therapy. 47 Mycobacterium kansasii (MK) Infection in Patients Infected with Human Immunodeficency Virus (HIV): Clinical Presentation. RAFAEL E. CAMPO* AND CARLOS E. CAMPO. Jackson Memorial Hospital and University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL. MK is increasingly recognized as a pathogen in association with HIV infection. We evaluated 46 cases of patients with HIV infection seen at our center from 1988 to 1993 that met criteria of the American Thoracic Society for MK infection in order to define the presenting characteristics of this disease. Patients with MK and HIV infection were mostly male (80%) with a mean age of 36.9 years; 71.7% were black, 19.6% Hispanic, and 8.7% non-Hispanic white. These characterisitics were not different from those of the HIV-infected population followed at our center. MK infection presented late in the course of HIV disease (mean CD4 count of 52.4/gL *8.9 SEM); 56.5% (26/46) of patients did not have a prior diagnosis of AIDS. The mean CD4 count of this group was 57.4/uL (? 12.3 SEM) which was not different from that of patients previously diagnosed with AIDS. In patients with a new diagnosis of AIDS, 57.7% presented with MK as the sole 01 and 42.3% had a concomittant 01. With a prior diagnosis of AIDS, MK was the sole OI in 75%. In 30 patients whose only 01 was MK, symptoms had been present for a mean of5 weeks (?0.3 SEM) by the time they came to medical attention. The most common symptoms were fever (73.3%), cough (73.3%), and dyspnea (50%). The most common signs were rales (36.7%), ronchi (26.7%), and adenopathies (20%). Of the entire group of 46 patients, the majority (91.3%) had MK pulmonary involvement, and of these individuals, five also had MK-associated diarrhea and one had axillary adenitis. Of the patients without pulmonary involvement, two had bacteremia and one each had supraclavicular adenitis and pericarditis. In 26 patients, pulmonary disease was caused exclusively by MK without another 01. All of these patients had an abnormal chest radiograph, with the most frequent fndings being interstital infiltrates (73.1%), lobar infiltrates (46.2%), and cavitation (19.2%). MK infection presents late in the course of HIV disease. In this sense, it is similar to infections caused by other mycobacterial organisms of low virulence which are pathogenic only with advanced immunodeficiency. In fact, in 19.6% of our patients, HIV infection was diagnosed because of symptoms associated exclusively with MK infection, and in 32.6%, MK by itself was an AIDS-defining condition. The lung is the organ most frequently involved, and most patie.ts have signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings consistent with a pulmonary infection.</page><page sequence="10">728 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 48 STUDIES OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE A2 SUBUNIT ON THE ACTIVITY OF CHOLERA TOXIN. Sam T. Donta, Boston University and Boston VA Medical Centers, Boston, MA The A2 subunit of cholera toxin joins the enzymatically- active A1 subunit to the B (binding) subunits of the toxin through non-covalent interactions. The C-terminal amino acid sequences of the A2 subunit are typical endoplasmic reticulum retention sequences, and there is evidence that the toxin is probably first processed by the Golgi and ER prior to the A1 subunit's interaction with its membrane target adenylate cyclase. The purpose of this study was to further detail the importance of the A2 subunit itself and its KDEL C-terminal sequences. A subunit toxin mutants were created using PCR technology in which a) the C-terminal KDEL sequences were deleted (A1A2- KDEL), b) all but the KDEL sequences of the A2 subunit were deleted (A1+KDEL), and c) the entire A2 subunit was deleted (A1-KDEL). The intact A subunit and the 3 mutants were then tested for activity in the Y1 adrenal cell tissue culture model system. The results indicated that, not only the KDEL sequences, but the A2 sequences as well, were important for toxin activity. The mechanisms by which the A2 subunit, other than its C-terminal KDEL sequence, allows for more efficient processing of the A1 toxophore is under study. 49 Glass Adherence and Adherent Bacteria Associated with Enteropathy. E.. SORDILI.O *, M. BEREZNEY, C. RALPHE, and I).P.KOTI,ER. St. Luke's-Roosevelt I ospital Center, New York, N.Y. Adherent bacteria are associated with self-limited gastroententis in the community and in travelers, and with more severe, prolonged disease in infants and in patients with AIDS. Investigation of the prevalence of infection with adherent bacteria and the role of these bacteria in disease has been limited because: 1) available molecular probes do not identify all adherent bacteria; and, 2) in vitro assays for adherence to lHEp-2 cells are cumbersome and must be performed for multiple isolated colonies from each specimen. To evaluate glass adherence (GA) as a potential tool for enrichment of adherent bacteria from mixed cultures, we tested adherence to glass coverslips in EMEM in the absence of HEp-2 cells for the following strains: aggregative E.coli (EAggEC), diffusely adherent E coli (DAEC), and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC) strains (gifs of Dr. James Nataro), and 8 other laboratory strains ofE coli. In our initial studies, bacteria were tested for GA after 18 hrs. incubation at 37 ?C in trypticase soy broth (TSB) or MacConkey agar (MAC). Adherent hacteria in clusters were seen for DAEC and one lab strain whether grown in TSB or MAC. The EAggEC and one other lab strain were adherent with moderate cluster formation when grown in TSB, but not MAC; two additional lab strains were adherent with minimal cluster formation when grown in TSB hut not MAC. The EPEC and 4 lab strains showed no cluster formation after growth in TSB or MAC. GA was then used to enhance recovery of DAEC from mixed cultures. DAEC (lactose +) and 4 (cluster - / lactose -) lab strains were grown in TSB for 18 hrs. DAEC was mixed with each of the 4 strains in a 1:9 mix. Eight glass beads were added to each mix, and incubated at 37 ?C for 3 hrs. Four beads from each mix were removed and rolled on MAC plates, which were incubated overnight and then counted for lactose + and lactose - colonies. In all cases, recovery of DAEC was enhanced, in a range from 3-fold to almost 100-fold. Four beads from each mix were also inoculated to TSB and incubated 18 hrs; in each of these mixtures the DAEC was predominant as demonstrated by subculture to MAC for lactose positivity, and by cluster formation in the coverslip assay. Our fildings suggest that GA may be a helpful tool for further investigation of adherent bacteria. 50 Mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus Induced Platelet Aggregation: Involvement of Glycoprotein Ib and Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. B. SHENKMAN*, D.VARON, U. MARTINOVITZ, R. DARDIK, and E. RUBINSTEIN. The Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel. Platelet interaction with S. aureus was previously reported, however, the molecular mechanisms of this process were not clearly elucidated. We have studied the involvement of glycoprotein (GP) Ib and GPIIb-IIIa receptors in human platelet aggregation induced by S. aureus. Incubation of bacteria with diluted whole blood was followed by platelet activation, as shown by increased expression of GMP-140 (P-selectin) on the platelet surface membrane. This activation was inhibited by prostaglandin E 1 . No platelet activation occured using glutaraldehyde-fixed bacteria. Incubation of intact bacteria with platelet-rich plasma, obtained from normal volunteers, led to platelet aggregation after a lag phase of 2-4 minutes. Platelets from afibrinogenemia or Glanzmann's thrombasthenia patients did not aggregate in response to S. aureus. In contrast, platelets suspended in von Willebrand factor (vWF) deficient plasma (vWD type III patients) responded like platelets from normal volunteers. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by non-peptidic Arg-Gly-Asp analogue NS11 and monoclonal antibodies (MABs) against GPIb and GPIIb-IIIa. Aggregation remained unaltered by recombinant vWF fragment RG12986 (which blocks GPIb binding site of vWF) and by MABs against GPIX. S. aureus diminished GPIb and did not affect GPIIb-IIIa MAB binding to resting platelets. These data suggest that GPIb, but not its vWF binding domain, plays an essential role in initial S. aureus - platelet interaction. GPIIb-IIIa is apperently involved as final pathway in this process. 51 Microglia Activated by Pneumococcal Cell Wall in vitro Induce Neurotoxicity via Nitric Oxide. YS KIM* and MG TAUBER. San Francisco General Hospital, and University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA Neuronal injury is a frequent complication of pneumococcal meningitis. Microglia (MG) are involved in host defenses and tissue repair in the brain and may contribute to neuronal injury, when activated. Activated MG have been reported to release nitric oxide or the excitotoxin glutamate in neurotoxic concentrations in vitro. To test the hypothesis that MG may contribute to neuronal injury in pneumococcal meningitis by one of these neurotoxins, we examined the neurotoxic effect of MG 'activated by pneumococcal cell wall (CW). Primary neurons and primary MG were obtained from fetal and newborn Sprague Dawley rats, respectively. MG were cultured with the neurons at a 1:5 ratio. These mixed cultures (or neurons alone) were then exposed for 48 hrs to CW from a rough strain of pneumococcus (R6, 100g/ml), and the effect of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME, 10 cUM) or a glutamate antagonist (MK-801, 10 .Lg/ml) was tested. All experiments were performed in low serum medium using 2% Ultroser? (correspon- ding to &lt;0.2% fetal calf serum). Viable neurons were counted after trypan blue exclusion. Data are shown as % viable cells ? S.D. I Control CW CW + L-NAME CW + MK801 Neurons alone 100 81 + 6 not done 92+8 Neurons+ MG 93+ 8 39 + 16 87 + 12 27 + 10 Thus, MG activated by pneumococcal CW were neurotoxic in the presence of very low serum concentrations and without priming of MG by cytokines. The neurotoxicity was reduced by L-NAME (p&lt;0.05) but not by MK801. MG may thus cause neuronal injury in pneumococcal meningitis by the release of NO. 52 Analysis of the Chromosomal Region Immediately Upstream of the Capsule Synthesis Genes in Group A Streptococcus. C. D. ASHBAUGH* AND M. R. WESSELS. Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. Group A streptococci are important human pathogens. Among the many cellular and extracellular factors that the organism produces, the cell surface-associated polysaccharide capsule appears to be critically important in modulating the interaction between the bacteria and the host. We previously cloned a 16 kb region of the group A streptococcal chromosome in the bacteriophage replacement vector EMBL3. The hasA, hasB, and hasC genes encoding enzymes involved in hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis were located centrally within the 16 kb fragment. Approximately 5 kb upstream of hasA is the stpA gene encoding a putative component of an ABC transporter. Since genes involved in the transport and correct localization of capsule often flank capsule synthesis genes in gram negative bacteria, we were interested in determining if other genes necessary for capsule expression were located between the stpA and hasABC genes. To identify potential genes in this region we subcloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of a 5 kb segment of DNA located between hasA and stpA. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of 5 potential open reading frames located upstream of hasA. We have termed these orf 1-5 with orf 1 beginning approximately 450 bases upstream of hasA. The predicted size of the proteins these open reading frames encode is 911, 237, 1288, 1024, and 541 amino acids respectively. The direction of transcription of all 5 open reading frames is away from hasA and toward stpA. Comparison of the nucleotide and predicted protein sequences to the world databases suggests that orf 5 encodes a CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase. The sequences of the remaining open reading frames do not have significant similarity to any known proteins. The role, if any, of these genes in capsule formation must be established. Their dissimilarity to capsule regulatory, attachment, or transport genes in other bacteria, however, suggests that either the hasABC genes are sufficient for group A streptococcal capsule expression, or, if additional genes are required, they are removed from the hasABC locus. 53 Demonstration of Chlamydia pneumoniae in Coronary Atheromas specimens from Young Patients with Normal Cholesterol from the Southern Part of India. Varghese PJ', Gaydos CA2, Arumugham SB3, Pham DG2, Quinn TC24, Tuazon CU' 'George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, 2John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 3Madras Medical Mission, Madras, India and 4NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD. C. pneumoniae has recently been associated with coronary artery disease and has been detected by PCR in coronary atheromas. The role of C. pneumoniae may be much more significant in a population in whom traditional risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia may not be significant. To evaluate the association, endarterectomy specimens of 40 patients from Madras, India were obtained during coronary artery bypass surgery. The clinical profile of this population is as follows. Average age was 49 years (range 35-68), all were males, 55% smokers, 53% diabetic, 40% hypertensive, and 33% with a family history of coronary artery disease. Their cholesterol profile is as follows: average HDL is 39 (range 26-50), LDL is 113 (range 82-198) and Triglycerides 170 (range 90-270). Tissue from three 5 u tissue sections per tube were obtained from paraffin embedded atheroma specimens. The samples were deparaffmized with xylene and the tissue was washed and sedimented in ethanol. After removal of the ethanol and vacuum desiccation, the specimens were treated with 300 ul lysis buffer consisting of PCR buffer containing proteinase K and N P-40/Tween 40 at concentrations of 100 ug/ml and 0.5%, respectively, at 60? for 1 hour. Following heating for 5 minutes at 100?C, 50 ul was subjected to PCR for a 463 base pair sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of C. pneumoniae. Detection of PCR products was by hybridization with a 270 base pair nested, biotin- labeled RNA probe and subsequent enzyme immunoassay, which utilized anti-biotin coated microtiter plates and an anti-DNA-RNA monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. After addition of a substrate of methyl-umbelliferyl-phosphate, the end product, methylumbelliferone was detected in a fluorometer. Four (10%) of 40 specimens were PCR-EIA positive for C. pneumoniae. These results indicate that C. pneumoniae may play a role in the etiology of coronary artery disease and further studies are warranted.</page><page sequence="11">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 729 54 Risk Factors for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG). M-C ROY *, DM STEPHENS, LA HERWALDT, R EMBREY, TM PERL, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA and Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA. Despite modern surgical techniques and meticulous postoperative care, about 10% of CABGs are complicated by stemal or harvest site infections. These infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, and increase the cost of care. Because previously proposed SSI risk indices have low sensitivity and positive predictive value when applied to our patients, we developed a multivariate logistic regression model to identify patients at risk of developing SSI after CABG. Our database included all CABGs performed between 1980 and 1994. To derive the model, we studied the 2564 CABGs performed at the University of Iowa Hospital in odd years (derivation set). In this population, we prospectively identified 275 SSI (10.7%). We evaluated 16 potential risk factors for SSI: age, gender, duration of procedure, wound classification, ASA score, pre-CABG hospital stay, presence of comorbid illnesses (diabetes, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction [Ml]), the number of punctured gloves, the number of procedural breaks, the number of drains inserted and the number of implants inserted during the operation. By univariate analysis, female gender, age, duration of procedure, ASA score, pre-CABG hospital stay, Ml, procedural breaks, drains and implants were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with developing an SSI. In our final model the independent predictors of SSI were female gender (OR=1.7, p=0.0002), procedure duration (OR=1.004 per duration unit, p=0.0001), M (OR=1.3, p=0.03), age &gt; 60 years (OR=1.7, p=0.0001), and insertion of an implant (OR=1.3, p=0.09). We will validate this model in a second population that includes all patients undergoing CABG during the even years between 1980 and 1994 (validation set). Our model suggests that females, older patients, those with longer procedures and those with implants are more likely to develop SSI after CABG. This model will help us focus our infection control surveillance efforts. 55 A Serologic Study of Respiratory Infection in the Institutionalized Elderly. P. ORR*, R. PEELING, M. FAST, J. BRUNKA, H. DUCKWORTH, G. HARDING and L. NICOLLE. The University of Manitoba and Cadham Provincial Laboratory, Winnipeg, and Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, Ottawa, Canada. In a prospective study over a two year period, episodes of fever attributable to respiratory tract infection, or of unknown source, were identified in residents of two long term care facilities using case definitions developed specifically for this population. The clinical features, and serologic responses to C.pneumoniae (CP), C.psittici (CPS), H.influenzae B (HB), Influenza A and B (IA, IB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (P) and mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), were assessed. Between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1990, 224 febrile episodes occurring in 131 residents were enrolled (0.6 episodes/1000 patient days). The male:female ratio was 1.4:1, and mean age was 76.4 + 12.3 years. Respiratory tract infection accounted for 116 (52%) episodes. and 108 (48%) were of unknown origin. Death occurred in one resident. A serologic response was seen in 45 (20.1%) episodes: CP (17 episodes), HB (4), IA (14), RSV (2), P (7), CP and IA (2), CP and HB (3), CP and P (1). Cases of influenza (A Shanghai 11/87H3No) occurred during a community outbreak in December 1989; vaccine was not protective in the study population (p = 0.13). No serologic responses were seen to IB or MP. Febrile episodes with positive serology were more likely to be diagnosed clinically as a respiratory tract infection (p = 0.003), and occur in residents with impaired mobility (p = 0.04), urinary incontinence or indwelling catheter (p = 0.03). Those with a dual serologic response were more likely to have an underlying malignancy (p = 0.02) than those with a response to a single agent; it is not clear whether these residents experienced coinfections, or have cross-reacting antibodies. Mean C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels did not differ according to serology; IL-6 was higher (p = 0.0004) in those with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Respiratory tract infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the institutionalized elderly. Serology is a useful tool in clarifying the etiology and epidemiology of infection in this population. 56 Outbreak of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae at a VA Medical Center. L.B. RICE*, E. ECKSTEIN and L.L. CARIAS. VA Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio. We recently experienced an outbreak of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae at a VA Medical Center. Over the period from 1/93- 12/94, 180 ceftazidime resistant K. pneumoniae were detected by the VAMC Microbiology laboratory. 67% of the isolates were recovered during the 12 month period between 7/1/93 and 6/30/94. Sources of isolation included urine, sputum, wound and blood. The level of ceftazidime resistance in selected isolates varied from 32 iLg/ml and &gt;256 gg/ml. A subgroup of strains expressed resistance to the B- lactam-B-lactamase inhibitor combinations ampicillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam in addition to ceftazidime resistance. One strain resistant to both ceftazidime and the inhibitor combinations elaborated two B-lactamases (SHV-1 and extended-spectrum enzyme TEM-6) encoded by the same plasmid (pLRM7). One strain resistant to only ceftazidime elaborated only the TEM-6 B-lactamase from a plasmid similar to pLRM7 in which the SHV-1 gene was inactivated by insertion of IS15. The outbreak was hospital-wide, with a close correlation being found between the wards on which the most ceftazidime was used and the wards with the highest incidence of ceftazidime resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates. Adding piperacillin-tazobactam to the hospital formulary in 2/94 and discouraging use of ceftazidime (without specific barrier precautions for infected or colonized patients) was associated with a dramatic drop in the rate of ceftazidime resistance from 28% in the first quarter of 1994 to 10% in the fourth quarter of that year (P&lt;0.05). Increases in resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam have not been observed during this time period. These data indicate that the overall use of ceftazidime within an institution, and within areas of the institution, is closely related to the risk of emergence of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae. They also suggest that minimizing ceftazidime use is of primary importance in the control of such outbreaks. 57 The Epidemiology of Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal (CNS) Surgical Site Infections (SSI) in 19,299 Patients Following Median Sternotomy (MS). S MOSSAD*, S GORDON, J SERKEY, D COSGROVE, D LONGWORTH. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), Cleveland, Ohio. CNS is commonly isolated from median sternotomy wounds of patients (pts) following cardiac surgery, but is often not considered to be a pathogen. We reviewed our cardiovascular wound registry to assess the role of CNS in SSI following MS procedures. All SSI were verified by a single observer. A case-pt was defined as any pt developing a SSI (using CDC definitions) where CNS was the sole isolate following a MS performed at CCF from 1/1/88 through 3/1/94. A total of 374 SSI (1.9/100 procedures) were identified among 19,299 MS procedures, of which 75 (20%) were due to CNS (4/1000). Although the overall SSI rate did not vary during the study period, the rate of CNS SSI was significantly higher during the later 50 months of the study period compared to the initial 24 months (9/5957 procedures [1.9/1000] vs 66/13,267 [4.9/1000], P-value &lt; 0.001). No outbreaks occurred. Forty-nine (65%) of the CNS SSI were superficial, 20 (27%) deep, and 6 (8%) were mediastinitis. The mean interval from operation to onset of CNS SSI was 14 d (range 4-66 d). Signs and symptoms of CNS SSI included purulent discharge from the wound (80%), leukocytosis &gt;10,000 cells/mm3 (60%/), and fever (41%); secondary CNS bacteremias occurred in 7 (9.5%) pts, including 5 superficial and 2 deep SSI. Case-pts were often male (69%/), elderly (mean age 62 yrs), and diabetic (57%); 29% had a previous MS. Antibiotic resistance was common in CNS isolates to methicillin (89%), erythromycin (60%), clindamycin (44%), and tetracycline (22/). Cefamandole or cefuroxime were used as antibiotic prophylaxis for 98% of case pts. A total of 89% of pts received treatment with parenteral antiinfectives (mean 19 days), and 31% required surgery including debridement (28%), skin grafting and/or muscle flaps (9.5%), and sternectomy (4%). There were no deaths attributed to CNS SSI. Two pts required readmission for SSI. We conclude that CNS should be regarded as a pathogen in wound infection in pts following MS and clinically may present with a wide spectrum of severity. 58 Simultaneous Hospital and Community Emergence of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcusfaecium. S.J. SARGENT*, V.S. BASELSKI, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Memphis, TN, L.D. REED, L. WONG, Regional Medical Center, Memphis, TN, and D.F. SAHM, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Nosocomial infections due to vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) have risen nationally since first reported in 1988. During the 12 month period December 1993-1994, 49 cases of vancomycin- resistant E.faecium (MIC &gt;32) were reported in our institution with 16% among patients admitted from nursing homes. The suspect index case was a nursing home resident with multiple prior admissions. Although many cases can be related epidemiologically, unrelated strains also began appearing simultaneously in the community. Nine isolates selected from serious infections in our cluster and 3 community isolates were tested by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Van A PCR. All but one amplified by PCR with Van A primers. Seven of our hospital isolates (78%) w ere identical by PFGE while 2 (22%) were clearly different as well as 2 of the community strains. The third "community" isolate was identical to our hospital strain which retrospectively was from a patient who had been in our facility 3 times during the outbreak period. Over half (53%) of isolates were from blood or catheters, 22% from urine and 16% from wounds. Associated risk factors included diarrhea, surgery, burns, vancomycin use, an ICU stay and a prior hospital admission. There were 15 (31%) deaths. Although outbreaks of VRE are not uncommon, the spontaneous evolution of at least 5 different strains occurring within a 6 month period in our area as demonstrated by PFGE indicates an endemic community reservoir. Unrecognized colonization, particularly among nursing home residents, may adversely affect attempts to control the spread o f VRE. 59 Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus Avium Infections: A Nosocomial Threat? Vladimir Berthaud M.D., M.P.H., Hamid Safavi, M.D., Wafaa El-Sadr, M.D., M.P.H. Enterococcus avium has been rarely isolated as a human pathogen. To date, a total of 21 cases have been published in the English-language literature. Review of our microbiological records has identified 7 cases in a five-month period. Their medical records were retrieved to analyze demographic characteristics, predisposing factors, comorbid conditions, treatment and outcome. Blood cultures were done using the BACTEC system;. Other isolates were recovered by conventional techniques. Four blood isolates, one breast abscess, one wound and one dialysate culture were found. Only two deaths occurred, among patients with bloodstream infection. Six of seven isolates were from mixed cultures. Despite the presence of an indwelling urinary catheter in nearly all patients, E. avium was not recovered from the urine. In contrast to previous studies, all four blood isolates were ampicillin and vancomycin resistant. There was no association between E. avium and gastro- intestinal pathology. E. avium can cause serious disease in hospitalized patients, fatal outcome in bacteremia. The widespread use of vancomycin and the ability of Enterococcus to persist in the environment may transform E. avium into a nosocomial threat.</page><page sequence="12">730 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 60 Nosocomial Environmental Contamination With Endemic and EpidemicMethicillin-Resistant S.Aureus. R.S. ROMAN*, A.M. KABANI, B. DYCK, J. MCLEOD, K. OLEKSON, L.E. NICOLLE. Health Sciences Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Objective: To determine whether there is a difference in environmental contamination between endemic and epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Methods: MRSA patients hospitalized at Health Sciences Centre (HSC), a tertiary care teaching hospital, were identified and classified as endemic (ciprofloxacin sensitive, community-acquired and non-transmitted) or epidemic (ciprofloxacin resistant, tendency to spread nosocomially). A patient was considered to have MRSA from a respiratory site if throat, sputum, endotracheal or tracheostomy specimens were positive A positive nares swab was not considered a respiratory isolate. Settle plates, consisting of standard sheep blood agar in petri dishes, were allowed to sit open for 8 to 12 hours in various locations inside and outside each MRSA patient's room. Thirteen to 26 plates were placed inside and 2 tol I plates outside each patient's room. Representative environmental isolates from some MRSA patients were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA digested with Smal, and compared to the respective patient's clinical isolates to confirm strain identity Results: Five patients with endemic MRSA isolates and 8 patients with the epidemic MRSA strain were studied, of which 2 (40%) and 6 (75%) had any environmental contamination detected. Two patients, one with epidemic MRSA and one with endemic MRSA, were on effective antimicrobial therapy at the time of settle plate testing. The total number of MRSA positive environmental settle plates was significantly greater in patients with epidemic MRSA than those with endemic MRSA (34/146 vs 11/96 plates, RR 2.03, p=0.03). Two endemic-type MRSA patients and 3 epidemic MRSA patients had positive respiratory site isolates. Patients with MRSA from respiratory sites had significantly greater environmental settle plate contamination (37/95 vs 8/147 plates, RR 7.16, p&lt;0.001). One patient who initially was respiratory site positive with epidemic MRSA and had extensive environmental settle plate contamination (12/13 plates), was retested at a later date when only carrying MRSA at non-respiratory sites, at which time no environmental contamination was detected (0/13 plates). Conclusions: The epidemic MRSA strain had greater environmental contamination of patient's rooms than found with endemic strains. This may explain some differences in transmission between strains. Patients with MRSA at respiratory sites have more extensive environmental contamination. 61 RECYCLING OF HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED COLONIZATION WITH VANCOMYCIN RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCI VIA NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. MP Revuelta MD (Member), JA Nord MD, RL Yarrish MD, JW Kislak MD, V LaBombardi, Ph.D. St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, New York, NY. Purpose: To evaluate the potential for the introduction of vancomycin- resistant enterococci (VRE) into an acute care hospital via patients admitted from nursing homes, and to identify risk-factors for VRE colonization in these patients. Setting: St. Vincent's Hospital (SVH), an 813-bed acute care teaching hospital in New York City. Methods: Fifty consecutive nursing home residents were cultured prospectively via rectal swabs within 24 hours of admission to SVH between 10/21 and 12/12/94. Swabs were plated onto Columbia CNA agar containing 6 mcg/ml of vancomycin. Enterococci were identified and speciated, and MIC's to vancomycin were determined by broth microdilution. In addition, demographic information, prior hospitalizations, underlying illnesses, and prior antibiotic use were recorded for each patient. Patients with and without VRE colonization were compared for associations with various risk factors using Fisher's exact test. Results: 5 out of the 50 patients (10%) evaluated were colonized with VRE on admission. All five of these patients had been hospitalized at SVH within the past year. Risk factors significantly associated with VRE colonization included previous admission to SVH within one month, six months and one year prior to the current admission, and previous therapy with vancomycin or cephalosporins. Factors not associated with colonization included age, sex, underlying illness, presence of decubitus ulcers, use of feeding tubes, and therapy with antibiotics other than the above. Conclusion: Nursing home residents are not important sources of de novo introduction of VRE into our hospital. These data rather suggest that acute care hospitals may be important sources of VRE colonization for nursing home residents, especially those who have been treated with vancomycin or cephalosporins, Hospital infection control policies should recognize the potential for recycling VRE colonization during re- admissions in this patient population. 62 Complications of PICC Line Use in Outpatient Care. A.D. TICE*, M.J KUNKEL, D.R. SULLIVAN, and the OPIVITA Study Group. Infec- tions Limited, P.S., Tacoma, Washington. In order to better understand the risks of outpatient care of serious infections, the Outpatient Intravenous Infusion Therapy Association (OPIVITA) undertook a prospective study of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines at 35 centers during the early months of this year. 425 cases have been analyzed so far. There was a broad range of types and sizes of catheters which were used to provide 10,535 days of therapy (average of 25.4 days). Dressing protocols varied with daily (5%) to weekly (62%) changes. Blood was commonly drawn through the lines. All catheters that were removed before completion of intravenous therapy were investigated. Preliminary results indicate the primary reasons for early line removal were mechanical rather than infectious in that 5.4% of catheters were dislodged, 5.4% developed leaks, and 4.5% occluded (total of 5.9/1000 treatment days). Catheters were removed early in 3.5% of cases because of a sterile phlebitis and 1.2% because of unexplained fever (resolved with removal in all 5 cases). Infections caused early removal in two cases of septic phlebitis and one episode of bacteremia (total of 0.7% of lines or 0.3/ 1000 treatment days). Death was found to be a reason for early removal in 26 (6%) of cases but in no case was there a clear indication that the patient's demise was due to outpatient therapy. Preliminary data indicate size 3Fr catheters were removed early more often than size 4Fr (22% vs 14% and 0.9 vs 0.6/1000 treatment days). PICC lines were also more often removed early if placed in the hospital compared to an outpatient facility (24% vs 13%). In summary, peripherally-inserted central catheters appear to be a safe, effective method of long-term vascular access in outpatients with serious infections. If cared for properly, they are seldom a problem with secondary infections, but there are a number of other problems for which better under- standing and standards for care are urgently needed. 63 Association of Staphylococcus aureus Nasal Carriage with Sternotomy Wound Infection. IW FONG*, M. LAUREL, S. McMILLAN, R. BANNATYNE. St. Michael's Hosp., University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. S. aureus is the most frequent cause of sternotomy wound infection in cardiac surgery, and often results in severe complications. A recent study (JID 1995; 171: 216-9) found an association between S. aureus nasal carriage and sternotomy wound infection. In the present study nasal swabs for culture were collected prospectively from patients (pts.) undergoing cardiac surgery and correlated with the devel- opment of sternotomy infection. Of 36 pts. with sternotomy infection, 20 (55.6%) were carriers of S. aureus and 17/25 pts. (68%) with S. aureus infections were colonized in the nares; while in 339 pts. without sternotomy infection 73 (21.3%) were nasal carriers of S. aureus (p&lt;0.0001). In the total group of S. aureus carriers, 20/93 (21.5%) developed sternotomy wound infection, 17 (18.3%) due to S. aureus; whereas, in the non-carriers 16/283 (5.7%) developed sternotomy infection with only 8 (2.8%) due to S. aureus (p&lt;0.0001). Thus nasal carriage of S. aureus is associated with an increased risk for sternotomy wound infection by a factor of 4-6 x fold. Eradication of S. aureus from the nares may reduce the risk of sternotomy wound infection, but prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm this prediction. 64 Malassezia furfur Colonization and Infection in Two Neonatal Intensive Care Settings. D.J. BOKEN*, S.A. CHARTRAND, J. BIEHLE, S.J. CAVALIERI. Departments of Pediatrics and Medical Microbiology, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE. Malasseziafurfur blood stream infection is a well recognized complication of long term intravenous lipid therapy in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). Approximately 100 cases of systemic M. furfur infection have been published. The largest reported series of patients was 16, making evaluation of epidemiology, pathogenesis and therapy difficult. We report 46 cases of blood stream infection with M.furfur since 1987 (Hospital A). Risk factors for infection were evaluated and antibiotic use as well as intravenous lipid therapy appeared to correlate with infection. Therapy in most cases consisted of discontinuation of intravenous lipids with or without removal of central venous lines. Two cases of recurrent fungemia were noted. Amphotericin B therapy was rarely required. Malassezia was not the direct cause of death in any of our patients. A similar NICU (Hospital B) staffed by the same neonatologists and pediatric residents, but with different nursing staff observed only two cases of Malassezia infection during this same time interval. Different brands of lipid are used by each facility. Nurses at Hospital A draw the lipid into syringes from a large bottle used for all patients, discarding unused material at the end of each day. Lipid at Hospital B is prepared by the hospital pharmacy for each child. The only other difference in care at the two locations is the blood culture technique used in the laboratory. Detection of M. furfur at Hospital A increased in 1988 with the routine use of lysis-centrifugation (LC) for all neonatal blood cultures. A further increase was noted in 1990 with the routine use of olive oil overlay for all neonatal blood cultures. This increased isolation rate has been maintained at Hospital A since 1990. Hospital B utilized supplemented tryptic soy broth for pediatric blood cultures. We conclude that undetected M. furfur fungemia may be common in some NICU settings and that routine use of LC plating with olive oil overlay should be further evaluated. 65 Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci in the Blood (VREB): Do We Need to Treat? M. URDANETA*, F. HOLLIS, and S. J. SPERBER. Hackensack Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, and UMDNJ-Nes Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. Infection with enterococci resistant to multiple antibiotics including vancomycin is becoming increasingly common. Physicians are faced with difficult and discomforting therapeutic decisions when confronted with a patient with a positive blood culture for VRE. We sought to determine the frequency and clinical significance of VREB. The antibiotic susceptibility of all 168 enterococcal blood isolates recovered between January 1992 and March 1995 at Hackensack Medical Center, a 597 bed suburban teaching hospital, were examined. Medical records of patients with VREB were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven of 45 E. faeciut,r and I of 121 E. faecalis blood isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Recovery of vancomycin resistant E. faeciurm in the blood increased from I isolate in 1992, to 7 in 1993, and 18 in 1994, reflecting an increase from 14 to 72% of . faecium blood isolates (p&lt;0.05). VREB occurred in 20 patients with a single VREB isolate and 3 patients with &gt; I VREB isolate. Twenty-one chans of patients with VREB were available for review. The mean age of patients was 61 (range, 20 to 84) yrs. None had VREB on admission. The average length of stay prior to VREB was 40 (range, 4 to 114) days. Prior to the positive culture for VRE, 81% had been in a medical or surgical ICU or oncology ward, 52% had major surgery. 14% had a hematologic malignancy, and 5% had AIDS. All patients had received antibiotics (71% vancomycin) prior to isolation of VRE. Three patients also had VRE in the urine, but none had pyuria. One patient had VRE plus other pathogens isolated from a wound. Although treatment with various antibiotics with in vitro activity against VRE was initiated in only several patients, all patients eventually had negative blood cultures for VRE. Same hospitalization mortality in this population was 38%. In sum, VREB increased significantly from 1992 to 1994, and accounted for the majority of E. faeciurm blood isolates. These patients all received prior antibiotics and usually had lengthy complicated hospitalizations requiring surgery and/or intensive care, and had mortality attributable to underlying disease. None of the patients had evidence of infection with VRE at another site as a source for VREB. All patients cleared VREB, despite the lack of specific therapy in most patients. The data suggest that in the absence of an obvious VRE infection elsewhere, VREB may reflect transient bacleremia or skin colonization which need not be treated.</page><page sequence="13">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 731 66 An outbreak of Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in a suburban VA Medical Center - A case-control study. P. TSANG*, F. FALLON, M. SHUMAN, V. JIMENEZ. SUNY at Stony Brook and DVA Medical Center, Northport, NY The impact of VRE in suburban settings is still unknown. We identified 38 cases of VRE over a 2 year period at a suburban VA facility (36- E. faecium; 2-E. faecalis) among 1,207 enterococcus isolates. 21/23 were of Van A phenotype, sensitive to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Sources of VRE included urine (26), blood (4) wounds (6) and others (4). Case control methods were used to analyze risk factors for VRE infection. Controls (n=60) included patients with vancomycin susceptible enterococci, housed in the same unit at the same time. The mortality rate for the study group was 51.52% compared to 22.95% for the control group (odds ratio, 2.67). The length of stay prior to isolation of VRE was 64 days, compared to 14 days in the control group (p&lt;0.005). Predictors for VRE infection were prior multi-antibiotic therapy (3.98), pre-exposure to vancomycin (7.05), urinary catheterization (3.98), invasive procedures (2.74), co-infection with MRSA (10.54) or with C. difficile (24.58), and length of stay &gt;5 days (5.7). A cluster of VRE in the ICU and in one of the medical units was found, suggesting that nosocomial spread may have occurred. Control measures included contact isolation and VRE surveillance in the ICJ. Vancomycin use declined three fold, after restriction. No new clusters of VRE were identified. RFLP performed on a limited number of current isolates showed that strains of VRE were genetically unrelated. Thus, VRE occurs in a suburban setting, and infection control measures may limit nosocomial transmission of VRE. 67 Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS)Associated Infections in Patients with Severe Heart Failure. M. HERRMANN*, B. GRESHAKE, M. WEYAND, C. V. EIFF, U. HORLING, H.H. SCHELD, G. PETERS. The University ofMuenster, Muenster, Germany. Rationale: Implantable LVAS are increasingly used for supporting the refractorily failing heart until availability of a donor organ. Infection of the device is considered to be a major risk factor in the pretransplantation period. Identification and analysis ofclonal identity of cultured microorganisms is warranted to establish strategies for microbiological surveillance, prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions. Methods: We prospectively collected clinical and microbiological data from patients who received a LVAS type Novacor5 (Baxter Healthcare Corp.). All specimen obtained during routine microbiological surveillance, from blood cultures and from swabs of different portions of the device surface at time of explantation were collected, and phenotypic and genotypic profiles were established using conventional typing methods and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Since 1993, 17 patients received a LVAS. Duration of device implantation ranged between 17 and 340 days. 8 patients were successfully transplanted, 5 patients died (4 with signs of multiple organ failure), 4 patients currently have the LVAS implanted. 4/17 patients developed septicemia (2, S. aureus; 2, coagulase-negative staphylococci [CoNS]). 9/13 explanted devices were culture positive (6, S. epidermidis; 5, other CoNS; 2, Enterococcus sp.; 1, S. aureus). Using PFGE, in some cases, clonal identity of isolates was observed between strains from blood, from the device, and/or from the insertion wound of the device cable. Conclusions: Use of LVAS is a promising approach for bridging the time span between refractory heart failure and transplantation, however, the use of the device is accompanied with a significant rate of infectious complications, predominantly caused by staphylococcal microorganisms. 68 Nosocomial Outbreak of Multi-resistant Enterococcus durans (VRED): Description of the epidemiology and antimicrobial sensitivity testing. M. SCHWARTZ*, L. SLAVOSKI, G. DASH, M. LEVISON, C. JOHNSON, O. KORZENIOWSKI, P. PITSAKIS, P. MAY. Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, PA In 1991, we reported an ICU outbreak of infection due to vancomycin- resistant Enterococcusfaecium (VREF) from contaminated electronic rectal thermometers. The outbreak ceased after removal of these thermometers from the ICU and institution of CDC VREF-specific infection control measures. During the 1st week of February 1995, VRED were isolated from blood in 2 ICU patients. VRED bacteremia was transient in both patients. One week later, surveillance rectal cultures in 16/20 ICU patients detected 1 more patient with VRED. Two of the 3 patients were in adjacent beds. Rectal ICU surveys done every 1-2 weeks in 2-3/95 (64 rectal cultures in 47 patients) detected 2 additional patients with VRED. One-third of ICU survey patients had VREF. One month after the 1st ICU isolate, a patient was admitted for the 1st time with a VRED urinary infection acquired at home. No ED had been isolated in the prior year at the hospital. MICs (ug/ml) for the VRED were: vancomycin 256-512; teicoplanin 32-64; ampicillin (A) 64-128; synercid (S) 1-2; novobiocin (N) 1-2; doxycycline 8; ciprofloxacin &gt;64; clinafloxacin (C) 4-8; CP-99,219-27, 8-16; chloramphenicol 8-16; rifampin 0.6-0.12; gentamicin &gt;500. One isolate had MICs to erythromycin 4 and streptomycin &lt;2000 and in the other isolates &gt;64 and &gt;2000 respectively. Time-kill studies in 2 isolates at 24h revealed inhibitory activity for A, S, N, and C, and bactericidal activity for S alone in 1 isolate. Synergistic cidal activity occurred with N+C in both isolates. All VRED revealed van A by PCR. In summary, we describe the 1st nosocomial outbreak of VRED (van A genotype), which occurred in the ICU with endemic VREF. The two blood isolates of VRED had different antibiograms. Bacteremia was not associated with morbidity or mortality. During this interval one community-acquired VRED was identified, which implies possible community origin of the nosocomial strains. Inhibitory activity was present for S, N, C, chloramphenicol and rifampin. Synergy occurred with N+C. 69 Characterization of High Level Aminoglycoside Resistant Enterococcusfaecalis Isolated in an Urban Hospital in Greece. G. L. DAIKOS*, G. BAMIAS, G. CHRISTAKIS, A. KATRACHOURA, S.PERLORENTZOY, V.SYRIOPOULOU. Sismanoglion General Hospital, Athens Greece, Metaxa Hospital, Piraeus Greece and First Dpt. of Paediatrics, Athens University, Athens Greece. We examined 65 clinical isolates of high level aminoglycoside resistant (HLAR)Enterococcus faecalis collected from an urban hospital in Greece during 1988 to 1990. Twenty eight strains were isolated from the urine, 18 from wound infections, 15 from miscellaneous sites, and 4 from blood of hospitalized patients. All isolates were tested for susceptibilities to commonly used antibiotics by the broth microdilution method. In order to investigate the relatedness among the strains we analyzed the Sma I restriction digests of genomic DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Sixty three of the isolates had high level resistance (HLR), &gt;20(0) [tg/ml, to both gentamicin (Gm) and streptomycin (Sm), whereas 2 of the isolates had HLR to Gm but not to Sm. All the isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, imipenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and their mean minimal inhibitory concentrations were 3.1, 1.6, 2.2, 1.2, and 0.8 [ig/ml respectively. Analysis of Sma I restriction digests by PFGE resulted in 41 patterns. Twenty nine isolates produced PFGE patterns falling in 5 groups, including 10, 10, 4, 3, and 2 isolates each group respectively. The remaining 36 isolates exhibited a pattern that was distinct for each isolate. Pairs of strains isolated from different sites of the same patient had always identical or similar (one band difl'rent) PFGE pattern. The HLAR was not associated with ampicillin or vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcusfaecalis isolates of the present study. Intrahospital transmission of Enterococciis faecalis conferring HLAR has occurred in our institution. 70 Sequential follow-up with immunoblot analysis of relapsing Clostridium difficile disease M.E.Mulligan*, L.V.McFarland, and C.Surawicz. Long Beach VAMC and University of California, Irvine, CA, and University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Patients (n=26) with known relapsing disease due to Clostridium difficile were treated as out- patients and studied prospectively from the time of standard treatment with oral vancomycin (V) or metronidazole (M). Repeat cultures were obtained regardless of symptoms. There were 10 patients with 2 or more positive cultures (at the time of initial and subsequent relapse or within 2 months post standard therapy if asymptomatic). There were 12 episodes with paired isolates (1 patient had subsequent carriage followed by relapse and 1 had 2 relapses). Five patients had relapses and 5 only carriage at follow-up. Six V-treated episodes were followed by 4 relapses, 5 M-treated episodes were followed by 3 relapses (including 1 preceded by ciprofloxocin therapy; no other pat- ients had intervening therapy). Immunoblot typing identified 5 different strains. Each patient had the same strain identified throughout the study; 5 recurrent episodes were associated with types 4, 8, 9, and 11; 7 cultures associated with carriage were of types 2, 4, 8, and 11). These findings indicated that relapse was due to persis- tence or reacquisition of the initial strain in outpatients, and that no specific strain was associated with relapse, and suggested that relapse was not associated with V or M therapy. 71 A Semiquantitative Culture Method for the Diagnose of Surgical Wound Infection. C. SANCHEZ-CARRILLO, B. PADILLA, F. PARRAS, J. BERENGUER, J. JIMENO, E. BOUZA*. Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marai6n. Madrid. Spain. Introduction: The gold standard for the diagnosis of surgical wound infection is clinical criteria. There is no simple and conclusive microbiologic way to diagnose these infections due to the great number of false positive results. In similar situations (urinary and catheter-related infections) quantitative and semiquantitative methods have been useful. Objective: To establish a microbiological semiquantitive culture method more useful than the conventional qualitative culture for diagnosing surgical wound infections. Material and Methods: Two swabs were taken from 180 open surgical wounds: one of them was cultured in a qualitative way according to conventional methods: sheep-blood, chocolate, McConkey agar plates and brain-heart infusion, and the second one was cultured semiquantitatively on a sheep-blood agar plate: a dry swab was spreaded over the entire surface of the plate and colony counts were performed at 24-48 h of incubation at 37?C. Clinical criteria (serous exudate, erythema, purulent exudate and separation of deep tissues) were used as the standard for comparison. Sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for each colony count (&gt;10, &gt;20, &gt;30, &gt;40, &gt;50, &gt;100, &gt;200 CFU/per plate). Results: The criterion of 210 CFU/per plate provided the optimum values of Spa, PPV and NPV. Sen was lower than that of the qualitative culture (84% vs 99%). The most relevant data are summarized in the table. Sen (%) Spe (%) PPV (%) NPV (%) Qualitative culture 99.9 61.2 71.5 88.2 a10 CFU/per plate 84.1 88.8 88.1 95.2 Conclusion: The semiquantitative method (210 CFU/per plate) improves the microbiological diagnosis of surgical wound infection and can be an alternative to the qualitative culture to diagnose these infections.</page><page sequence="14">732 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 72 A Large Outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia Respiratory Tract Acquisition Associated with Nebulized Albuterol. CF Pegues DA Pegues , DS Ford, PL Hibberd, LA Carsonf, CM Raine, DC Hooper. Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA and tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. In 1994, we investigated a large outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia respiratory tract acquisition. A case was defined as any patient at Massachusetts General Hospital who had B. cepacia isolated from the sputum from Jan. 1- Dec. 31, 1994. Seventy cases were identified. Most cases (40 [61%]) occurred from Feb. 1-Mar. 31, 1994; of these, 35 patients (86%) were mechanically ventilated. By multivariate analysis, these 35 mechanically ventilated case-patients were more likely to have received nebulized albuterol (OR=23.3, 95% CI=2.2- 1426.7) or penicillin, ampicillin, or nafcillin (OR=13.5, 95% CI=1.9-595.1) in the 10 days before the first isolation of B. cepacia compared with matched B. cepacia-negative control-patients. Among patients receiving albuterol, case-patients received significantly more doses during this 10-day period than did control-patients (median, 8 vs. 1 dose; p=0.004). Although B. cepacia was not cultured from available albuterol sources, all outbreak strains had an identical antibiogram and DNA restriction endonuclease digestion pattern by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This investigation suggests that careful adherence to standard procedures for administration of nebulized medications is essential to prevent nosocomial respiratory infections. 73 Infections ()ccuring in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infected Patients in a Long Term Care (LTC) Setting. PATRICIA L DEMARAIS* I, JOYCE GEIRTZEN 2 1 Cook County I .osp., Rush Medical College, Chicago IL, 2 Oak Forest tlosp (OFT), Oak Forest IL lHospital-acquired infections contribute to morbidity, mortality, and cost of caring for patients in a LTC setting. This may be especially true for HIV+ patients but isn't well studied. OFH, a 900 bed LTC and rehabilitation facility opened a 20 bed unit for HIV+ patients requiring semi-skilled nursing care. From the opening of the unit in 1/94 through 1/95 baseline data including patient demographics and functional level (Barthei score) were collected at admission for all patients. All infections occurring &gt;72 hours after admission were tabulated using CDC definitions for nosocomial infections There were 75 admissions for 66 patients. Mean age was 39 (range 22-78) years. 51 patients were male. The most common risk factors for I V were IVDU (44%) and homosexuality (23%). Most patients had CD4 counts &lt; 200 (74%)( range 0-1131) The Barthel scores were 0 to 100 (57% &lt; 50). There were 152 infections (24 per 1000 LTC days). On 24 admissions (32%), patients had no infections, on 11 (14.5%), 1 infection; on 17 (22 5%), 2; and on 23 admissions (31%), &gt;3 infections (range 3-9) The most common infection was antibiotic-associated Clostridiun difficile diarrhea, 37 episodes in 28 patients. There were 30 episodes of bacteremia due to IV cathethers in 20 patients; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the cause in 50% Unnary tract infections accounted for 24 episodes in 16 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 48% Secondary bacteremia occured in 14 episodes in 9 patients; Pseudomonas species and MRSA were the most common pathogens, each accounting for 36%. Age, gender, and number of days at the transfering hospital were not significantly associated with risk of LTC infection. The following were significantly associated. Risk factor mean in patients mean in patients p value with infection without infection Barthl score 39 9 63.3 0.01 CD4 count 116.4 164.7 0.04 Total days on unit 99.6 51.7 0.01 This information can be used to plan for care of IIV+ patients in LTC, a need that will increase as the epidemic continues. It may also be helpful in designing infection control measures for this patient population. 74 Trichophyton violaceum Outbreak In a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU): Confirmation of Nosocomial Acquisition by PCR-RFLP Typing. OPAVSKY A*, PONSONBY J, LI A, SUMMERBELL RC, GOLD R, MATLOW AG. The Hospital for Sick Children and Mycology Branch, Ministry of Health of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. An outbreak of tinea corporis due to an uncommon pathogen T. violaceum was identified in our PICU after eleven cases were reported to employee health in September 1994. The index case was a 2 year old East Indian girl with underlying idiopathic chronic granulomatous lung disease, on steroid therapy, who was in PICU from May 12- October 19 1994, following complications of a thoracotomy. Ten months prior to admission she had travelled to India; two weeks prior to admission a ring shaped lesion was noted on her abdomen. New trunk and scalp lesions appeared over the next 4 months despite treatment with oral ketoconazole and topical clotrimazole. In October, all PICU nurses were surveyed to determine dates and duration of exposure and type of contact (ie, direct =patient care; indirect=changing bed linens or laundry, handling toys). Only workers with direct contact developed definite (culture confirmed) or probable disease [11/85(13%) nurses and 2 additional volunteers]. Ten/13 (78%) had arm lesions. Skin scrapings from the patient and seven nurses grew T. violaceum, identified by colonial morphology and thiamine response. Typing of 4 strains (index case plus 3 health care workers) by PCR amplification using the fungal universal primer ITSl AND ITS4 followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR product using Hae III CfoI, EcoRl and MspI with gel electrophoresis showed that the strains were genetically identical. After control measures were instituted( gowns and gloves for direct care and handling of linens), no new cases appeared. Conclusion: Dermatophyte infections can spread nosocomially, and barrier precautions can prevent spread. PCR-RFLP typing proved useful for demonstrating strain similarity in this outbreak of T. violaceum infection. 75 Management of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci in U.S. Hospitals. MB Edmond*, RN Jones, MA Pfaller, SE Wallace, RP Wenzel. The University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA and the SCOPE Consortium Hospitals. Preventing nosocomial transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has become an important issue in infection control. Many hospitals have developed policies for reducing the potential for transmission of VRE and recently the CDC's Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee issued guidelines. We surveyed a group of hospitals stratified by size and geographic location (SCOPE consortium; n=30) to assess utilization of microbiologic techniques for detection of VRE and the types of control measures which have been implemented. Twenty-seven hospitals (90%) completed the survey. Eight hospitals (30%) were classified as small (&lt;400 beds), 12 (44%) were medium-sized (400-699 beds) and 7 (26%) were classified as large (&gt;700 beds). Two-thirds reported having had VRE-infected or colonized patients: 59% reported having 1-24 patients, and 2 hospitals (7%) reported &gt;100 patients. Most hospitals (74%) test all enterococcal isolates for vancomycin resistance, while 19% test isolates from selected body sites only. The majority of hospitals (67%) utilize more than one method for the detection of vancomycin resistance (automated method 70%, Kirby-Bauer 59%, agar or broth dilution MIC 26%, E-test 15%). For the care of VRE-infected patients, 89% of hospitals require gloves and 70% require gowns. When caring for VRE-colonized patients, 85% of hospitals require gloves and 63% require gowns. A private room is required for VRE-infected (colonized) patients at 93% (89%) of hospitals. Approximately half of the hospitals (56%) use chlorhexidine as the handwashing agent in areas with VRE patients; 19% use other medicated agents (primarily triclosan) and 22% use nonmedicated soap. Only 3 (11%) hospitals cohort the nursing staff caring for VRE patients, and only 1 hospital (4%) performs environmental cultures after terminal disinfection. When previously infected/colonized patients are readmitted, 37% of hospitals perform rectal/stool cultures. Most hospitals (78%) have not performed surveillance cultures to detect VRE colonization; however, most (59%) have restricted the use of oral vancomycin. Only 37% of hospitals report VRE cases to local or state health departments. We conclude that hospitals have developed reasonable plans for the detection of VRE and the implementation of appropriate isolation precautions. However, many hospitals utilize suboptimal handwashing agents and few file reports with public health agencies. 76 Risk Factors for Bacteremia with Vancomycin Resistant and Vancomycin Sensitive Enterococcus faecium. SH AMBARDAR, RH GOLDBERG,* JF KEISER, DM PARENTI, GL SIMON. The George Washington University, Washington, DC. Enterococcus faecium (Ef) is emerging as a significant pathogen in bacteremic patients. The clinical characteristics of 9 patients with bacteremic infection due to vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VREF) were compared with 23 patients with bacteremic infection due to vancomycin sensitive isolates (VSEF). The VREF patients were older with a mean age of 75 years vs 60 for VSEF patients (p=0.037). There was a modest male predominance among VREF patients (67% vs 43%, NS). All of the VREF bacteremias were nosocomial whereas 7 of the VSEF infections were community-acquired (p=0.083). Polymicrobial bacteremia with both VREF (44%) and VSEF (48%) was common in this patient population. The mean number of antibiotics to which patients had been exposed prior to the development of enterococcal bacteremia was 5.6+1.67 for VREF and 3.6 1.26 for VSEF (p=0.003). There were significant differences only for intravenous vancomycin and aminoglycosides. Intravenous vancomycin had been administered to 89% of VREF patients, but only to 23% of VSEF patients prior to enterococcal bacteremia (p=0.003). Similarly, 78% of VREF patients had received IV aminoglycosides compared with 35% of VSEF patients (p =0.049). There were no differences in the use of cephalosporins, metronidazole or oral vancomycin. Other features common to both groups included foley catheters, central venous catheters, and renal dysfunction. The overall mortality was 44% for patients who had VREF bacteremia and 26% for patients with VSEF bacteremia (NS). In conclusion, there are significant differences in the patient population at risk for developing VREF and VSEF bacteremia. Patients who develop VREF bacteremia are older, have a greater exposure to prior antibiotics and were more likely to have received intravenous vancomycin and aminoglycosides. 77 Risk Factors for Bacteremia with Ceftazidime Resistant and Ceftazidime Sensitive Enterobacter cloacae. RH GOLDBERG, KA LAESSIG,* JF KEISER, DM PARENTI, GL SIMON. The George Washington University, Washington, D.C. Bacteremic infection with Enterobacter cloacae (EC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Complicating the treatment of (EC) infections is the increasing development of antimicrobial resistance. A retrospective review of 21 patients with EC bacteremia revealed 7 patients with ceftazidime-resistant isolates (CREC) and 14 patients with ceftazidime-sensitive isolates (CSEC). The 7 patients with CREC included 5 adults and 2 neonates. All of the CREC patients had nosocomially-acquired bacteremias whereas only 6/14 of the CSEC patients had nosocomial infections (p= .002). All of the CREC isolates had an identical antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and were sensitive only to TMP/SMX, tetracycline, imipenem and aminoglycosides. Malignancy was a significant co-morbid illness and was found in 4 of 5 adult CREC but only 3 CSEC patients. The mean length of stay for patients with CREC bacteremia was 50.7 days compared with 14.0 days for CSEC (p=0.02). There was no significant difference in the duration of stay prior to the development of CREC and nosocomial CSEC bacteremia. The CREC patients were more likely to have received multiple antibiotics prior to the development of EC bacteremia. The mean number of antibiotics was 4.29+1.97 for CREC patients versus 0.74 + 1.44 for the CSEC patients (p =.0002). Four of the 5 adult CREC patients had prior treatment with ceftazidime, compared to only 1 of the CSEC patients (p= .006). The CREC patients were also more likely to have polymicrobial bacteremias (57% vs. 36%), but this was not statistically significant. The mortality for both group of patients was similar (29% vs 36% for CREC vs CSEC, respectively). In conclusion, patients who develop CREC bacteremia have been hospitalized longer, have more severe underlying disease, and were more likely to have received multiple antibiotics, especially ceftazidime, when compared to CSEC patients.</page><page sequence="15">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 733 78 Comparison of Three Methods of Screening for Fecal Carriage of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE). D. LANDMAN, E. OYDNA, G. SAURINA*, M. ZAMAN, K. PATEL, V. DITORE, W. HUANG, J. QUALE. VAMC, Brooklyn, NY. Identification of patients colonized with VRE may be crucial to control nosocomial spread. No method of screening for VRE has been standardized. We compared three types of selective culture media during a study of the point prevalence of fecal VRE colonization in hospital and nursing home patients. Perianal swabs from 391 patients were inoculated onto each of the following: 1) Mueller Hinton Agar with vancomycin (V) 20 mcg/ml, polymixin 100 mcg/ml and streptomycin 100 mcg/ml (MHA); 2) Tryptic Soy Broth with V 64 mcg/ml and aztreonam 60 mcg/ml (TSB); and 3) Bile Esculin Azide Agar (BEA). For the last medium, a 30 mcg V disk was placed, and bile esculin + colonies which grew within the disk zone were subcultured. Enterococci were identified by standard methods, and MICs were done by the agar dilution method. Results: VRE (V MIC range 32-2048 mcg/ml) were isolated from a total of 100 patients. VRE were detected in 51 patients using MHA, in 51 using TSB, and in 54 using BEA. Sixteen VRE were detected only in MHA, 20 only in TSB, and 16 only in BEA. Other V resistant bacteria and yeasts grew in 51 and 75 TSB cultures, respectively, complicating VRE isolation from TSB. Conclusion: VRE were detected in only about half of colonized patients by each of the 3 culture methods. BEA is readily available, and was the simplest of the methods. A combination of these or other methods may be necessary for accurate surveillance in hospitals endemic for VRE. 79 Fecal Carriage of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) in Nursing Home (NH) and Hospitalized Patients. J. QUALE, K. PATEL*, M. ZAMAN, G. SAURINA, W. HUANG, E. OYDNA, V. DITORE, D. LANDMAN. VAMC, Brooklyn, NY. Nosocomial spread of VRE has proven difficult to contain by standard infection control (IC) methods, possibly due to patients (Pts) with undetected VRE colonization. We deter- mined the point prevalence of fecal carriage of VRE in our hospital and affiliated NH. Perianal swabs from medical, surgical, and NH Pts were cultured on selective media containing vancomycin (V). MICs of V, ampicillin (A) and gentamicin (G) were done by agar dilution. Results: VRE were isolated from 86/192 (45%) of hospital Pts. VRE positive Pts were present on all medical and surgical wards, and had a longer median hospital stay than VRE negative Pts (19 vs. 7d, P&lt;.0001). Nine of the VRE+ Pts were admitted only 1 to 4 days earlier, suggesting possible community acquisition. VRE+ Pts had received more of all classes of antibiotics; 83% of VRE+ Pts received any antibiotic vs. 39% of VRE- Pts (P&lt;.0001). This association was greatest for cephalosporins (RR-3.44). 19% of VRE+ Pts previously received V. VRE were also isolated from the sink, doorknob, and bedrail of hospital rooms. VRE were isolated from 14/199 (7%) of NH Pts. Eleven of the 14 had been hospitalized within 3 months; recent use of antibiotic was not a risk factor. All but 5/100 isolates were E. faecium. The MIC50 and MIC90 (mcg/ml) were: V 512 and 1024; A 256 and 256; and G 4000 and 4000. Conclusion: Fecal carriage of VRE was present in 45% of hospitalized and 7% of NH Pts. VRE positivity was associated with increased antibiotic usage and length of stay for the hospitalized Pts, and recent hospitalization for the NH Pts. The unrecognized and widespread presence of VRE in Pts and environment, and the presence of a reservoir in the NH Pts, may contribute to failure of IC measures. 80 A Comprehensive Control Program Reduces Transmission of Tuberculosis (TB) to Hospital Staff. R.S HOLZMAN* for the BELLEVUE HOSPITAL INFECTION CONTROL TEAM. New York University - Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, NY Bellevue Hospital is a &gt;1000 bed municipal hospital with &gt;200 new TB patients annually and a rate of isoniazid/rifampin resistance of over 15%. In 1991, prompted by reports of nosocomial outbreaks in NYC, we undertook a comprehensive revision of our control polices and implemented a plan of control based on the CDC 1990 guidelines. 53 rooms, 3 in the Emergency Services Area, were renovated to provide negative pressure and supplementary ventilation, filtration, and UV radiation equivalent to 28 air changes hourly. The plan emphasized triage, early isolation and treatment, written criteria for starting and stopping precautions, and a formal respiratory protection plan including the fit testing and use of Dust-Mist respirators for routine care and HEPA respirators for high-risk procedures. In addition The Employee Health Service, where periodic PPD testing had recently been sporadic, resumed a comprehensive screening program of non-physician employees in 1991. We assessed the impact of this program by comparing PPD conversion rates (CR) for 19 Departments in the manner proposed in the CDC's 1994 guidelines. We compared 2 periods: 11/92 to 10/93 (preimplementation) and 11/93 to 10/94 (postimplementation). Results for selected departments and a pool of small ones are shown in the table. Department CR 11/92-10/93 CR 11/93-10/94 Prevented fraction Preimplement. Postimplement. (95% CI), P(X2) Total 90/2132 (4.22%) 23/1995 (1.15%) 73% (57, 43), &lt;.001 Nursing 54/608 (8.88%) 11/519 (2.12%) 76% (44, 90), &lt;.001 Housekeeping 9/105 (8.57%) 3/90 (3.33%) 61% (-39, 89), NS Radiology 2/50 (4.00%) 1/74 (1.35%) 66% (-263, 97), NS Miscell. or 14/474 (2.95%) 1/573 (0.17%) 94% (55, 99), &lt;.001 Unknown A program that was based on the CDC 1990 guidelines significantly reduced TB transmission. It is impossible to assess the relative impact of each specific intervention from these data. It is likely that at smaller hospitals with a lower TB caseload, the comparison of risks by department or work area, as suggested by CDC, will lack the power to detect moderate changes in risk. 81 Nosocomial Infection Rate of an Inpatient Pediatric Unit as a Function of Total Occupied Bed Days. D.A.REARDON, N.J. WAECKER*, K.GRAU, and J.E.THOMPSON-BOWERS. Naval Medical Center SD, San Diego, CA. Nosocomial infection rates can be highly variable and difficult to compare between institutions. Traditionally, the denominator used to define inpatient nosocomial infection rate (NIR) has been the number of admissions or discharges-in a defined unit over a specified time period. Such a formula does not take into account patient length of stay (LOS), a well-established risk factor for nosocomial infection. We performed a prospective, cohort study in a 32 bed general pediatric inpatient unit within a 760 bed teaching/tertiary care medical center to determine the NIR in terms of total occupied bed days (TOBD) to compare to conventional rates. TOBD represented the summation of the daily inpatient census for the time period specified. Between 1/94 and 3/95, all medical and surgical pediatric patients, excluding intensive care patients and normal nursery newborns, admitted to the general pediatric unit were monitored for the development of nosocomial infections. We defined our NIR as the number of nosocomial infections/total number of inpatient days. During the 15 month period, 6949 TOBD were accrued and 12 nosocomial infections were detected. Nosocomial infections included: 4 wound, 5 GI, 1 respiratory, 1 bacteremia, and 1 CNS. Our NIR was 1.72/1000 TOBD. During this period 2898 patients were discharged, giving a traditional NIR of 4.14/1000 discharges. The mean LOS during the monitored period was 2.7 days. The mean LOS for patients with nosocomial infections was 15.5 (Range 6-29) days, excluding a single outlier of 129 days. Expression of NIR in terms of TOBD inherently accounts for patient LOS and may result in a nosocomial infection rate which is substantially different from traditionally reported values. NIR in terms of TOBD may provide a more useful measure for inter- and intra-unit comparative analysis. 82 Burkholderia cepacia Bacteremia in a Pediatric Ward. K. ROISTACHER, B.J. BERGER*, Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens, Inc., Jamaica, NY. Burkholderia (formerly Pseudomonas) cepacia (BC) rarely causes bacteremia in children even when immuno- compromised with either chronic granulomatous disease or cystic fibrosis. It is a free living organism which can grow to high levels in distilled water making it an ideal pathogen for IV related infections. In March 1994, two children without chronic illness developed BC bacteremia on one hospital's pediatric ward. A review of blood culture results for the previous 2 % years identified 5 more cases on the same hospital ward. All 7 cases developed nosocomial BC bacteremia while receiving IV fluids. Ages ranged from 29 days to 20 months old. In all patients, the IV catheters had not been changed from admission to the time of bacteremia. The average time to bacteremia was 4.9 (3 - 8) days with the average length of insertion of the IV catheter being 6.2 (3 - 8) days. Two children required transfer to a tertiary care hospital because of sepsis with DIC which improved with IV catheter removal and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Two improved with only removal of the IV catheter and three patients improved with IV catheter removal and trim-sulfa, which was active against the organism. Interventions included careful attention to changing IV catheters every three days and to changing the IV fluid bags every day since in these children the entire volume of the bag was never completely infused over a 24 hour period. No further cases have occurred over the past year since these steps were initiated. 83 Isolation of Various Genotypes of Clostridium difficile From Patient and the Environment in an Oncology Ward. SH COHEN*, YJ TANG, J MUENZER, P GUMERLOCK and J SILVA JR. University of California, Davis, CA Toxigenic Clostridium difficile is the etiologic agent of antibiotic associated colitis (AAC). AAC is the most common cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients who are on antimicrobial or antineoplastic chemotherapy. Current data suggest cross-infection or environmental contamination to be important factors in hospital outbreaks. However, the epidemiology of hospital transmission of C. difficile in non-outbreak situations is less clear. In order to investigate this question, a molecular approach using Arbitrarily-Primed Polymerase Chain reaction (AP-PCR) was used to determine strain identity of C. difficile isolates present in the environment of a ward with a high incidence of AAC cases, and to correlate them with those isolated from patients symptomatic with diarrhea on the same ward. Selected environmental sites from 10 rooms in an oncology ward with an incidence rate of AAC of 0.9% were cultured for C. difficile during a 5 month period. Stool specimens from 9 patients on that ward who developed C. difficile colitis during this time period were also cultured. AP-PCR with the arbitrary 19-mer T-7 primer was then used to genotype these isolates. Thirty-four C. difficile strains were isolated from the environmental sites. These isolates represented 6 AP-PCR types. The most commonly found type which accounted for 35.3% of isolates was widespread throughout the oncology ward. Three other AP-PCR types were also found in several locations on the ward. These environmental isolates comprised both toxigenic (25) and nontoxigenic (9) strains. A comparison of these types with those of isolates obtained in previous years from the same rooms showed no similar genotypes. None of the 9 patient isolates had the same AP-PCR type as the environmental strains. However, 4 of these patient isolates had the same AP-PCR type. Two of these patients had occupied neighboring rooms at the same time interval. Our study corroborates the results of others who had found a diversity of C. difficile isotypes suggesting that endemic nosocomial AAC is not necessarily clonally spread. It is possible h f i that the types of C. difficile isolates frome hospital environment are transient and continuously changing. Further work is necessary to define the epidemiology of this nosocomial infection. The role of health care providers, also needs to be investigated.</page><page sequence="16">734 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING - ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - - 84 Intermittent Spread Of Candida Albicans (CA) and Candida Parapsilosis (CP) In A Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Detected By Chromosomal DNA Typing. R KHATIB*, MC THIRUMOORTHI, K RIEDERER, L THANOS, L ONEY . St. John Hospital, Detroit, Michigan. During assessment of strain-relatedness of Candida isolates from individual infants in our NICU, utilizing chromosomal DNA typing by SfiI digestion and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we detected identical strains among 3/5 patients with CA candidemia over a 15 month period. Among 4 infants with CP candidemia over the same period, identical strains were detected from 2 infants and another CP strain was recovered from the remaining 2 infants and from 1 other infant with intravascular catheter infection. Cases with identical strains were scattered over 18-231 day intervals. Duration between detection of colonization with the implicated strain and fungemia was 0-21 days. Transmission pattern showed that CA and CP alternated in spreading, but the 2 strains of CP spread concurrently. A point prevalence of colonization with Candida revealed that 50% of the infants were colonized with either CA (25%) or CP (25%). Analysis of all cases with candidemia over the preceding 8 years demonstrated variation in the number of cases and in the predominant species: C. species 1986-8 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 CA No (%) 1 (50) 3 (60) 0 3 (75) 1(50) 0 CP 1 (50) 2 (40) 5(100) 1 (25) 1(50) 0 Our findings demonstrate a fluctuation in the prevalence of candidemia and in the predominant species of Candida in our NICU probably due to intermittent cross-infection. These findings also show that acquisition of resident strains accounts for a sizable portion of Candida infections in the NICU and that precise typing methods are necessary for accurate monitoring of Candida infections. 85 A Randomized Study of Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone versus Cefazolin for Surgical Prophylaxis in Transplant Patients: Risk of Colonization with Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Post-operative Infections. J. Pfundstein, D.W. Oldach, R.S. Schwalbe, S.Q. Qaiyumi, S.T. Bartlett and J.G. Morris, Jr. University of Maryland Medical School and Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, MD Gram-positive organisms, including VRE, have emerged as major pathogens on the organ transplant service at our institution. To determine if surgical prophylaxis which included vancomycin affected VRE colonization or perioperative morbidity due to gram (+) pathogens, we randomized renal transplant recipients n = 88) to receive either a) vancomycin/ceftriaxone or b) cefazolin; and pancreas transplants n = 24) to receive either a) vancomycin/gentamicin or b) cefazolin/gentamicin. Stool samples or rectal swabs were obtained for culture within 24 hours of transplpnt and weekly while hospitalized. Enterococci were isolated from 35.3% of the 102 transplant patients from whom initial stool cultures were obtained; 12% of these isolates were VRE. Two weeks after transplant, 90% of patients had detectable enterococci in their stool (p&lt;0.001); 21% of these isolates were VRE. The prophylactic regimen used did not have a significant influenre on the rate of isolation of VRE or enterococci. During hospitalization, 26 patients had at least one isolate of VRE; 19/26 (73.1%) had received vancomycin (either prophylactically or therapeutically) prior to the isolation of VRE, as compared with 54 of 86 (62.8%) from whom VRE was not isolated. 44 patients (39.3%) had a surgical wound infection within three months or an infection at another site within the first month after transplant; 45.6% of infections were due to gram(+) organisms, including 3 VRE. Prophylactic regimen did not appear to influence the source or etiologic agent of these infections. Our data highlight the impact of transplantation and associated therapy on stool flora, as manifested by the rapid increase in number of patients with detectable enterococci in their stool. However, we were unable to demonstrate that inclusion of vancomycin in the regimen used for surgical prophylaxis had a significant impact on colonization with enterococci or VRE. Post-operative infections, irrespective of prophylactic regimen, remain a major cause of morbidity in transplant recipients, with gram-positive organisms as the predominant pathogens. 86 Acquisition of Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in Neutropenic Cancer Patients. MARY- CLAIRE ROGHMANN*, ROBERT J. McCARTER, Jr., SADAF QAIYUMI, RICHARD S. SCHWALBE, ALAN S. CROSS, J. GLENN MORRIS, Jr. The University of Maryland at Baltimore, Baltimore, MD. The neutropenic cancer patient is at high risk for infection with VRE. The lower gastrointestinal tract is the primary colonization site for enterococci and is also a major portal for infection in this population. When and how patients acquire VRE is not known. All neutropenic patients at the University of Maryland Cancer Center have twice weekly rectal surveillance cultures. 43 cancer patients were followed during their neutropenia for an 8 week study period. On admission the rate of rectal colonization with enterococcal species was 76.7%(33/43). n=33 % of % R % R % R % R % R isolate amp vanc teic gent strm E. faecalis 48.5 12.5 0 0 18.8 18.8 E. faecium 51.5 29.4 17.1 11.6 11.7 23.5 The last rectal culture showed that of the patients not colonized on admission 60%(6/10) acquired enterococci. n=6 % of % R % R % R % R % R isolate amp vanc teic gent strm E. faecalis 67.7 25.0 0 0 25.0 50.0 E. faecium 33.3 100 0 0 50.0 100 There was no evidence of VRE acquisition during the study period. Patients with VRE on admission maintained it. There were no VRE or VSE infections during the study period. No two VRE isolates were alike as defined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis(PFGE). There was substantial colonization with VRE (7.7%) and VSE(76.7%) in this high risk population. However VRE and VSE appear to have low virulence even in a neutropenic population. The presence of multiple PFGE patterns among VRE suggests that in this group nosocomial transmission is uncommon. 87 High Prevalence of Vancomycin-Dependent Enteroocci Causing Clinically Significant Nosocomial Bactenmia. C.A. WOOD'*, D.D. STIERITZ', A.C. REBOI', E.A. BLUMBERG', A. MOLAVI', and H.S. FRAIMOW2. Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann University and The Graduate Hospital', Philadelphia, PA. Since 1991, vancoycin-resistant enterocci (VRE) have made up an increasingly large proportion of enecoocal bacteremias at Hahnemann University Hospital, a 615-bed tertiary car teaching institution. Between April 1994 and March 1995, 6 patients were identified as having 7 episodes of clinically significant nosooomial bactemia caused by vanoomycin-dependent enterocci (VDE). One patient had 2 separate episodes caused by different strains of E. faecalis occurring 6 months spart. All isolates were initially identified by heavy growth around the vancomycin disk on a direct-susceptibility plate from BacT/Alcrt blood culture bottles and were subsequently shown to grow around disks containing D-alanin-Dalanine, implying a defect in normal D-alanine-D-alanine ligase activity and dependence on the vancomycin induced ligase to compensate. The 7 VDE bacteremias (4 E. faecalis. 3 E. faecium) accounted for 17.1% of the 41 nosocomial bacteremias caused by VRE during this time period. All VDE bactremias were preceded by treatment with vancomycin for a variety of empiric and specific indications (mean 28 days, range 9-60) and all episodes were sustained (mean 6.7 days, range 2-24). Three of the 6 patients were receiving empiric vancomycin for neutropenic fever. Four VDE bacteremias were vascular catheter-related, 1 was either vascular catheter-related or biliary, 1 was either vascular catheter-related or from the GI tract during neutropenia, and 1 was from the urinary tract. Four patients expired, however, only one patient died as a direct consequence of infection. Six of the 7 VDE isolates were available for further characterization including PCR amplification of vancomycin resistance genes. Three contained vanA (2 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium) and 3 had vanB (2 E. faecium, 1 E. faecalis), suggesting that vancomycin dependence arose independently in unrelated isolates. Spontaneous vancomycin- independent revertants were obtained at a frequency of approximately 102 for vanA isolates and 10' for vanB isolates. In the setting of vancomycin treatment, VDE are a frequent, underappreciated cause of clinically significant, sustained, nosocomial bacteremias. VDE bacteremias may go undetected or detection may be delayed if direct susceptibility testing is not performed. VDE include both E. faecalis and E. faecium of either vanA or vanB genotype. The specific factors resulting in vancomycin-dependence and the mechanism of switching between vancomycin dependent and independent phenotypes remain to be elucidated. 88 Clustering of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) among solid organ transplant recipients: epidemiologic analysis and genotypic characterization. W. MAHER* AND I. RIBEIRO. The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio. VRE was first detected at this medical center in September, 1993. Over the next 17 months, VRE was isolated from 20 patients: 16 solid organ transplant recipients (10 liver (LTX); 3 kidney; 2 kidney-pancreas; 1 donor liver perfusate) and 4 non-transplant patients. Sites included: blood (3), bile (5), urine (6), wound (4) and misc. (2). The mean age was 50. The median length of hospitalization prior to VRE isolation was 26 days (range 1-196). During this period, patients received an average of 5.7 antibiotics; IV vancomycin was used in 71% of cases; cephalosporins in 71% of cases. Oral vancomycin was used by 2 of 19 patients. Among LTX patients, all had T-tubes in place, and 9/11 had a cholangiographic procedure prior to VRE isolation (range 1-25 procedures; median 7.6). Eight of the 10 LTX patients had end-to-end biliary anastomosis; 2 of 10 had choledocho- jejunostomy. Overall mortality was 32%; 1 of 3 bacteremic patients died. VRE isolates were genotyped via restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF). Six distinct REA subtypes and 10 CHEF subtypes were identified. Review of epidemiologic data demonstrated geographic and temporal clustering of REA/CHEF subtypes. In conclusion, several risk factors were associated with VRE infection including prolonged hospitalization, prior antibiotic use and, among LTX patients, biliary tract manipulation. Clustering of cases and genotypic characterization suggests that nosocomial transmission may have played a role in this particular outbreak. 89 Fungal Colonization Surveillance in Liver Transplant Recipients: Molecular Epidemiology and Clinical Correlates. S. HADLEY*, M. SAMORE, K. DIETZ, B. OGLEVEE, E. LEVIN, A.W. KARCHMER. New England Deaconess Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. In retrospective studies we have identified clinical colonization as an independent risk factor for deep fungal infection (DFI) in patients (pts) undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). In the present study, surveillance cultures (cxs) from 88 OLT pts were studied at baseline (day &lt; 0) and weekly during each hospitalization from 9/92 to 3/95. The results of the 549 positive cxs from 77 pts are as follows: No. cxs (% total) by site Oral Stool Skin Urine Drain Wound Baseline 48 (70) 35 (50) 115 (10) 6 (12) 1 (3) 2 (6) Da &gt;0 141 (28 100 (22) 75 (7 61 (14) 42 (8) 23(6) For most sites, cx positivity decreased or remained the same after trans- plantation. Baseline cx positivity correlated with prior hospitalization (p&lt;.01) and prior antibiotics (p&lt;.01) (adjusting for length of pre-OLT admission). The intensity (proportion of positive baseline cxs) of baseline cx positivity correlated with early (&lt;100 day) candidal DFI in 6 pts (p=.03). Karyotyping was performed by contour- clamped homogeneous gel electrophoresis (CHEF) on 111 isolates from 19 pts. In each of 18 pts a single strain was predominant across sites and across time for the first 2 months post OLT; one pt had the emergence of a second strain in the third month. Of 3 sets of pts transplanted within 30 days of each other, 7 of 9 pts had distinct isolates by CHEF; the other 2 pts had indistinguishable colonizing isolates but could not otherwise be linked epidemiologically. 3 pts with early candidal DFI had baseline isolates available for typing; 2 had baseline isolates indistinguishable from blood and abdominal fluid isolates, and the third pt had a blood isolate that differed by one band from a baseline skin isolate. In conclusion, one strain appears responsible for colonizing multiple sites in each pt in the early post OLT period. Most pts transplanted within the same month have distinct strains. The intensity of baseline colonization is associated with early DFI, and baseline strains appear to cause early DFI. Baseline surveillance cxs may be useful in predicting pts at risk for early DFI.</page><page sequence="17">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 735 90 Eradication of MRSA from the Burn Unit at aTertiary Medical Center. P.A. MEIER*, C.D. CARTER, S.E. WALLACE, R.J. HOLLIS, L.A. HERWALDT, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA. Background: Infection control experts do not agree on the appropriate measures for controlling nosocomial MRSA. The aggressiveness of the approach depends on the prevalence of MRSA in the facility and the risk factors of the exposed population. We report an outbreak of MRSA in our burn unit and the steps we used to eradicate the organism. Outbreak: During March 1993, MRSA was isolated from 4 patients in the bum unit (2 with burns and 2 with Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Cases included apatient with afatal pneumonia and secondary bacteremia, a patient with a wound infection, and 2 colonized patients. During May and June, the wounds of 6 more patients became colonized. Two of these 6 patients were readmitted 4 months later with osteomyelitis at previous wound sites. Laboratory Analysis: Antibiogram analysis, using a sixteen-drug panel, demonstrated that al strains were identical. Pulsed-Field gel electrophoresis confirmed that the isolates from the 10 patients and 3 staff were identical but were different from control strains. The outbreak strains did not have plasmids in contrast to the control strains, most of which had plasmids. Control Measures: Infection control personnel informed the burn unit staff that laboratory techniques supported the hypothesis of cross-transmission. Strict handwashing was encouraged. Infected or colonized patients were cohorted, placed in isolation, and if possible, transferred from the bum unit. Whirlpool treatments of known MRSA patients were done at the end of the day. When, despite stringent infection control measures, the second cluster occurred we suspected a persistent carrier. We therefore cultured the nares of 56 health care workers. We identified three MRSA-positive staff who were treated with mupirocin. During 20 months of active follow-up, no further cases have been identified. Conclusion: Four of 10 patients developed serious MRSA infections. We were unable to control this MRSA outbreak by strict infection control precautions. We terminated the outbreak by identifying staff who carried the epidemic strain and treating them with mupirocin. Although this approach might not be appropriate in al settings, we felt it was warranted because we did not want this organism to become endemic in a unit with high risk patients. 91 Epidemic Nosocomial Vancomycin- Resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) on a Pediatric Oncology Unit: Evidence for Clonal Expansion and Control of the Epidemic Clone. AE Brown*, H de Lencastre, K Henning, N Boone, J Eagan, K Gilhuley, M Chung, TE Kiehn, N Wollner, A Tomasz, and D Armstrong. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, NY and Rockefeller University, New York, NY. The heterogeneous chromosomal background of VREF isolated in previously described outbreaks suggests that plasmid-mediated transfer may play a major role in the spread of vancomycin (V) resistance. We report the spread of a dominant clone of VREF as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in a population of chil- dren with cancer at MSKCC in 1994. There were 56 patients on the same pediatric oncology unit from whom_VREF was isolated: 339 &amp; 23d; ages 5 months- 29y;x=10.7y; 27 solid tumor,22 leukemia/lymphoma, 5 immune deficiency, &amp; 1 each Histiocytosis X &amp; thalassemia; 30 had ANC&lt;1000/mm3. All 56 received broad spectrum antibiotics; all but 5 received IV V within 90 days prior to having VREF. Sites of initial recovery of VREF included: 13 blood (in- cluding 1 catheter tip culture), 12 urine, 7 wound, &amp; 24 stool surveillance cultures. Of 56 initial isolates, all were resistant to ampicil- lin &amp; gentamicin, and 32 were resistant to tetra- cycline. Of 56 initial VREF isolates, 55 were available for PFGE analysis: 22 had the same PFGE pattern, suggesting an epidemic clone had spread on the pediatric oncology unit. With standard in- fection control techniques, i.e., handwashing, isolation, barrier precautions, and education programs, the spread of VREF was controlled. 92 Rhinocladiella atrovirens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Psuedoepidemic Related to Improperly Disinfected Bronchoscopes. M.Z. BRONSTEIN*, M.A. ABRAMSON, M.A. ODEN, W.A. SCHELL, G.W. PROCOP, D.J. SEXTON. Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C. A pseudoepidemic due to Rhincoladiella atrovirens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified among sixteen of a total of 212 (7.6%) patients who underwent bronchoscopy between June 3 and September 1, 1994. No patient with bronchial washing cultures demonstrating R. atrovirens or P. aeruginosa had clinical signs or symptoms of infection. MIDI gas chromatography demonstrated that the 16 cases of P.aeruginosa were identical to cultures obtained from one bronchoscope. R. atrovirens cases were presumed identical. Investigation identified 3 errors that contributed to the outbreak: (1) The automatic bronchoscope washer operated with very low concentrations of glutaraldehyde (&lt;0.5%); (2) the washer used non- sterile water as a final rinse; (3) a damaged optic channel in a bronchoscope permitted bacterial and fungal contamination to persist. Termination of the pseudoepidemic was accomplished by one time ethylene oxide sterilization of all bronchoscopes, repair of the damaged bronchoscope, and manual cleaning and disinfection with appropriate concentrations of glutaraldehyde (2%) after each use of a bronchoscope. R.atrovirens or P. aeruginosa has not recurred since these actions. Our investigation demonstrated that multiple organisms can simultaneously cause pseudooutbreak, and that multiple defects in disinfecting protocols can combine to result in a pseudoepidemic. 93 First report of Wide Geographic Distribution of an Epidemic Clostridium difficile (CD) Strain Characterized by Genetic Typing. S. JOHNSON*, M.H. SAMORE, G.E. KILLGORE, P.C. DeGIROLAMI, F.C. TENOVER and D.N. GERDING. Lakeside VAMC and Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, New England Deaconess Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. Epidemics of nosocomial CD diarrhea caused by unique strains of CD have been repeatedly documented in this country and abroad. Whether these strains have increased epidemic potential or simply represent the predominant contaminating strain within the local institutional environment is not clear. From December 1988 through December 1992 large outbreaks of CD diarrhea were documented in 4 tertiary care hospitals involving several hundred patients and representing the northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern regions of the U.S. Case rates ranged from 15.8 to 20 per 1000 discharges or admissions. The predominant strain in each of these geographically diverse outbreaks was identical by HindIII restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and by arbitrarily-primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), but was untypeable by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) due DNA degradation with this technique. The outbreak strain represented 33 to 66% of a diverse population of CD isolates typed during each outbreak. The epidemiologic features varied in each of the outbreaks with the epidemic strain accounting for the majority of CD infections hospital-wide in some institutions and restricted to selected wards at others. The epidemic strain from each outbreak demonstrated high resistance to clindamycin and case- control studies conducted during 3 of these outbreaks demonstrated clindamycin as a risk factor. This is the first recognition of a CD strain with broad epidemic potential. 94 Utility of In-House Molecular Epidemiology for Establishing Clonal Association Between Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus faecalis Isolates. U. BODNAR,* T. SURIANO, I. COOPER, G.A. NOSKIN, B.E. REISBERG, J. KRUSZYNSKI, L.R. PETERSON. Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL. Infection with multidrug resistant organisms is a major clinical challenge and few, if any, therapeutic options remain available. Increasingly, infection control measures have taken on greater importance. During December 1994 and January 1995 we experienced an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis over a two month period involving 16 patients situated on different floors of our university teaching hospital. Initial review of the location of these patients revealed no common association, suggesting this occurrence was not due to horizontal spread. Using genomic DNA extraction, restriction enzyme analysis, and gel electrophoresis, we found 12 patients had isolates from a single clone with the other four each being unique strains. This data suggested nosocomial spread and chart review was undertaken to determine a common exposure source as an etiology. With careful chart review we found 5 of 12 patients with the clonal isolate had been on the same surgical floor. Of these 5, 1 patient also had been in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Another clonal isolate was found in the medical intensive care unit, located next to the SICU. Of the remaining 6 patients, 3 isolates were from the rehabilitation unit where patients from the surgical floor in question commonly were sent prior to discharge home. One chart could not be retrieved for review, and the remaining two were patients cared for at outside institutions whose records were also unavailable for review. The four nonclonal isolates remained unassociated (scattered throughout the hospital) after review. The clonal isolates thus were linked to patient movement between the surgical floor, the intensive care units and the rehabilitation unit. Careful review of patient records would not have been done revealing this association without realization of strain clonality. The data demonstrates the utility of isolate typing for epidemiologic purposes which in turn allows for the institution of appropriate infection control measures to halt the spread of highly lethal multidrug resistant pathogens. 95 Third Generation Cephalosporins are an Important Risk Factor for Acquisition of Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci. G.A. NOSKIN, M. POSTELNICK*, P. YINGER, B.E. REISBERG, L.R. PETERSON. Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL. There has been a dramatic increase in enterococcal infections, particularly, vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in medical centers throughout the United States. Due to an outbreak of VRE at our medical center, we performed a case-control study to evaluate the risk factors for VRE acquisition. From Apr 1992 to Dec 1994, all patients colonized or infected with VRE (case patients [n=51]) were matched with 2 control patients (n=102) who were hospitalized at the same time, on the same ward, and with similar underlying diseases. Significant univariate factors associated with acquisition of VRE included length of hospitalization (30.4 vs. 19.5 d, P=.045), hyperalimentation (7/51 vs. 1/102, P&lt;.0001), bladder catheterization (20/51 vs. 9/102, P&lt;.0001), and central venous catheterization (19/51 vs. 8/102, P&lt;.0001). In addition, both the mean number of antibiotics (4.4 vs. 3.0, P=.0003) and the mean number of antibiotic days (53.6 vs. 30.4 d, P=.0007) were associated with VRE. Prior administration of 3rd generation cephalosporins (24/51 vs. 27/102, odds ratio [OR]=6.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.1-18.4), vancomycin (34/51 vs. 47/102, OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.2-4.1), and clindamycin (10/51 vs. 9/102, OR=3.2, 95% CI=1.1-9.6) were the antimicrobial agents most commonly associated with VRE. The only independent risk factor for VRE as determined by logistic regression was prior administration of a 3rd generation cephalosporin (OR=5.0, 95% CI=1.4-18.5). After introducing a program of restricting the use of third generation cephalosporins, we were able to decrease our use of these agents by 73%. This correlated with a significant reduction of total enterococci (P&lt;.001) at our medical center. In summary, the epidemiology of VRE is complex and is most frequently identified in seriously ill patients with prolonged hospitalizations. While previous studies have demonstrated outbreaks related to nosocomial transmission and emphasized the adherence to strict isolation, limiting the use of 3rd generation cephalosporins is equally important.</page><page sequence="18">736 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 96 Characteristics of Primary Infections and Superinfections in Sepsis Syndrome Patients. JC WHERRY, TM PERL', RP WENZEL, and the TNF MAba NORASEPT I Sepsis Study Group. Bayer Corporation, Berkeley, CA; and the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA. Primary infection (PI) and superinfection (SI) characterisitcs were evaluated for 28 days in 326 patients presenting with sepsis syndrome who comprised the placebo subpopulation of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, NORASEPT I. PI (those infections initially present) were hospital acquired in 34% of cases, microbiologically documented in 69% of infections (39% pure gram negative, 36% pure gram positive, 11% mixed gram negative/gram positive, 5% pure fungal, 9% other) and presented as a bacteremia/fungemia in 36% of patients. By contrast, SI (infections not initially present but developed within 28 days) were hospital acquired in 86% of cases, microbiologically documented in 79% of infections (26% pure gram negative, 36% pure gram positive, 11% mixed gram negative/gram positive, 15% pure fungal, 12% other) and presented as a bacteremia/fungemia in only 18% of patients. The most common gram negative pathogens were E. coli, P. aeruginosa (PI and SI, respectively) and most common gram positive pathogens were S. aures, S. epidermidis (PI and SI, respectively). Infections resolved clinically in 62% of PI, and 71%.of PI organisms were eradicated. Infections resolved clinically in 42% of SI, and 51% of SI organisms were eradicated. These data and others that will be presented demonstrate the distinctive characteristics of PI and SI in sepsis syndrome patients entered into a clinical trial. 97 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection in a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Unit, Winter, '94-'95. M. ABBAS*, P.H. CHANDRASEKAR, BMT TEAM. Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, Ml. RSV infection, a common respiratory illness in winter, can be serious in compromised children and adults including BMT recipients. During January-March 1995, there were 5 RSV- infected patients with 2 fatalities in our BMT unit. All 5 were females who received allogeneic marrow with ages 17 months, 11 years, 14 years, 24 years, and 45 years. Symptoms were fever, cough and nasal congestion. Two pts had the infection during pre-engraftment and other 3 developed symptoms 13 days, 20 days and 18 months after marrow engraftment, while receiving steroids for graft-versus-host disease. RSV was nosocomially acquired in 2 of 5 pts. Diagnosis was made by enzyme immunoassay of nasal wash in 3, by bronchoalveolar lavage in 1 and by open lung biopsy in 1. There were 2 pts with pneumonia (1 during pre-and 1 during post-engraftment) and 3 with upper respiratory tract infection. Both pts with pneumonia died despite aerosol ribavirin and mechanical ventilation. All 3 with upper respiratory tract disease survived with only 1 receiving ribavirin. RSV infections are serious with a potential for nosocomial transmission in the BMT ward. Symptoms of upper respiratory infection in hospital personnel and visitors need extra attention, particularly during RSV outbreaks. In pts admitted with or developing upper respiratory symptoms prior to transplantation, BMT may need to be postponed until RSV is excluded. Lower respiratory tract RSV disease, during pre-or post-engraftment, has a poor prognosis. 98 Infections and Other Complications Related to Peripherally Inserted Midline Catheters: A One Year Prospective Study. AM GOETZ*, JM MILLER, MM WAGENER, RR MUDER. VA Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA. We conducted a one year prospective study to assess the complication rate associated with the use of Landmark Midline catheters (Menlo-Care, Inc.) for prolonged vascular access. Patients were hospitalized at the acute and long-term care divisions of a VA hospital. Midline catheters were inserted by trained IV team nurses who inspected the catheters and changed dressings three times weekly Semi-quantitative cultures were performed on catheters at the time of removal. A total of 124 catheters were inserted in 106 patients. Mean patient age was 63 years (range, 37-88). Underlying illnesses included infection (76%), cardiac disease (57%), diabetes (31%), and neurologic deficit (27%), 53% were non-ambulatory and 21% were incontinent Mean duration of catheter insertion was 12 days (median 9; range 0-51). Although 10% of catheters were colonized (&gt;15 colonies/plate) on removal, there was only one case of catheter associated bacteremia The rate of bacteremia was 0 7/1000 catheter days, compared with 2/1000 catheter days for subclavian catheters during the same period (p &gt;. 1) Mechanical complications occurred in 33% of patients; obstruc- tion (13%) and accidental removal (8%) were the most frequent. Mechanical complications were significantly more frequent in ambulatory (p=.03) and HIV infected patients (p=.005). We conclude that peripherally inserted Midline catheters are an appropriate modality for long-term intravenous access, with infection rates that compare favorably to subclavian catheters. Unlike central venous catheters, they can be inserted by trained nursing personnel. 99 Pneumonia in Long-Term Care Patients: A Prospective Study of Outcome and Sequelae. RR MUDER*, C BRENNEN, D SWENSEN, MM WAGENER. VA Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA. Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity in long-term care patients. We performed a one year prospective study of 108 consecutive patients acquiring pneumonia in a long-term care facility to determine acute and long-term outcome and the influence of co-morbidity and functional status. Mean length of follow-up was 18 months. Although nearly all patients received systemic antimicrobial therapy, acute (30 day) mortality was 26%; 42% of surviving patients had a second episode of pneumonia at a mean of 116 days. Subsequent episodes were associated with residence on the nursing home care unit (p=.001), urinary catheterization (p=.014), and poor nutritional status (p=.086). Kaplan-Meier survival probability was 40% at 12 months and 33% at 18 months. Survival was significantly influenced by Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score, which measures mobility and ability to perform self-care tasks. Patients with ADL scores &lt; 10 had an 18 month survival of 65% compared with 28% for patients with higher levels of debility (p=.034). Co-morbidity score and age did not influence the likelihood of survival. We conclude that an episode of pneumonia in a long-term care patient is a harbinger of further episodes of pneumonia and of death within a 12 to 18 month period. Physical debility, as reflected by ADL score, and not age or co-morbidity, is the main predictor of mortality. The impact of the degree of debility on subsequent morbidity and survival is an important consideration in deciding on the appropriateness of an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach to a nursing home patient with pneumonia 100 Clinical and Microbiological Features of Necrotizing Fasciitis. I. Brook, and E.H. Frazier, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland The microbiological and clinical characteristics of 83 patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) treated over a period of 17 years are presented. Bacterial growth was noted in 81 of 83 (98%) of NF specimens. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 8 (10%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in 18 (22%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 55 (68%). In total, there were 375 isolates, 105 aerobic or facultative and 270 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 4.6 per specimen. The recovery of certain bacteria in different anatomical locations correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. Anaerobic bacteria outnumbered aerobic bacteria at all body sites, but the highest recovery rate of anaerobes was in the external genitalia, buttocks, trunk, neck and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobes were Stlahvlococcus aurus (14 isolates), Escherichia cQl (12), and Group A streptococcus (8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (101), Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp. (40), Bacteroides fragilis group (36), and Clostridium sp. (23). Certain clinical findings correlated with some bacteria: Edema with Clostridium sp., S. aureus. Prevotella sp. and Group A streptococcus; gas and crepitation In tissues with Enterobacteriaceae and Clostrdium sp.; and foul odor with Bacteroides sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with some organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp.; diabetes with Bacteroides sp., Enterobacteriaceae and S. aurIus; immunosuppression and malignancy with Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of NF. 101 Outbreak of Adenovirus 8 Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) in a Chronic Care Hospital. P.S. GRAMAN*, M.D.M. RODRIGUEZ, L. CHENEY, and M.A MENEGUS. University of Rochester Medical Center and Monroe Community Hospital (MCH), Rochester, NY. Reports of EKC outbreaks in chronic care hospitals are unusual despite the potential for rapid spread of adenovirus in these settings. We report an outbreak of EKC in MCH, a 605-bed chronic care facility in Rochester, NY. Between Dec 1994 and April 1995, 68 patients and 40 staff developed signs and symptoms of EKC. The index case was a staff member whose child, attending daycare, had first developed conjunctivitis. 15/69 (22%) of eye cultures from patients were positive for adenovirus; 1/41 (2.4%) of eye cultures from staff grew adenovirus. Of 4 adenovirus isolates typed, all were type 8. Symptoms persisted for up to 6 weeks, and ocular complications (corneal ulcerations, visual impairment, secondary bacterial infection) occurred in at least 8 cases (7%; 2 patients, 6 staff). Staff with EKC were absent from work for days up to 5 weeks. Although cases were seen widely through the facility, most were concentrated on 4 hospital units. On the unit where the outbreak first appeared, 24/59 (41%) of patients (median age 82 yr) and 13/49 (27%) of staff were affected. There was no association between EKC cases and prior ophthalmology clinic visits. Control measures included closing 4 of 17 patient units to admissions/transfers, confining patients to their home unit, furlough of infected staff, gloving for patient contact, and improved environmental cleaning. Outbreaks of adenovirus EKC in chronic care facilities may be associated with high attack rates, significant morbidity, and prolonged absence of personnel.</page><page sequence="19">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 737 102 A Laboratory and Clinical Study of Stethoscopes as Potential Fomites of Infection. J. ACKELSBERG, P. AXELROD, J. KOSTMAN, T. FEKETE* and J. WOODWELL. Temple University Sch. ofMed., Philadelphia, PA. Desien and Methods We undertook a 4 part study to evaluate the potential role of stethoscopes in transmitting microbial agents of infection. 1) We evaluated the rate of cleaning of stethoscopes using a covert observer in the intensive care unit. 2) We inoculated sterile stethoscopes with bacteria and measured the duration of colonization. 3) We inoculated a volunteer with an identifiable strain ofStaphylococcus simulans and determined whether this could be recovered from a stethoscope applied to the skin. 4) We cultured stethoscopes from doctors and nurses in the medical ICU and from the chest areas of patients hospitalized in that unit. Results 1) In 1 observation days in 2 medical and I surgical ICU, we noted that only 6% of staff encounters involving use of a stethoscope were followed by cleaning the instrument as contrasted with 25% of encounters that were followed by hand-washing. 2) Two hours after inoculation and drying, we were seldom able to recover Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa but were able to recover consistently Enterococcusfaecalis (&lt; 5% of initial inoculum), Staphylococcus aureus (&gt; 10%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (&gt;20%) from the stethoscopes. 3) We were able to produce skin colonization with S. simulans, but we were essentially unable to recover this organism from a stethoscope applied to the skin. 4) The isolation of bacteria from stethoscopes in the medical ICU showed a varied flora of coagulase- negative staphylococci (CNS), non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., S. aureus and enterococci. Quantitative cultures showed that CNS was present at the highest titers often exceeding 1000 cfu per stethoscope. Proof of cross colonization of stethoscopes and patients is difficult to achieve, but there may well be a pattern of correlation between patient isolates and those of the stethoscopes of each patient's health care providers. Conclusions Patient care providers make little effort to clean stethoscopes. This may be relatively harmless since it is hard to establish colonization of stethoscopes with many bacterial species responsible for hospital infections. Bacteria able to colonize normal skin can adhere to the stethoscope after skin contact and can persist when directly applied to the stethoscope. The latter setting may mimic skin that is heavily colonized by bacteria secondary to epidermal lesions or alterations in microbial flora. Though stethoscopes can be transiently colonized by a wide range of bacteria, we were unable to show high titers of pathogenic bacteria. We are investigating whether stethoscopes may serve as a vector for CNS or acinetobacter. 103 Infections Complicating Cardiac-Assist Devices. J. Messa,W. Forman, P. Axelrod, and B. Suh. Temple University Health Sciences Center, Philadelphia, PA. Left-ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (OHT) in critically ill patients. At our institution, 14 LVADs (7 TCI, 7 Thoratec) were placed over a 3 /2 year period. There were 4 women, 10 men; one had prior OHT, and 5 received steroids. The mean duration of LVAD placement was 29 days (range 2-76). LVAD infections occurred in 4 (29%) of the 14 pts; the mean time to infection was 12 days &amp; actuarial infection rate at 2.5 mos was 43%. One pt had bacteremia (duration 3 days). Signs were drainage (4 pts), tenderness (2 pts), and cellulitis (1 pt). Only 2 of 4 pts had fever (&gt;100.5 F). Both A. calcoaceticus and Enterococcus were isolated in 2 pts, there was one infection each of S. marcescens. and P. aeruginosa. All infected patients received appropriate antibiotics. Two of the 4 pts underwent cardiac transplantation before the resolution of infection, and LVADs were removed: 1 pt died and 1 was cured after LVAD site debridement at the time of OHT. Two pts died with their LVAD in place without infection resolution. LVAD infection contributed to death in all 3 pts who died. Median survival was less in infected than uninfected patients (15 vs. 40 days), but this did not achieve statistical significance. No clinical factors were significantly associated with infection including gender, age, diagnoses, surgeon, hospital location, duration of LVAD placement or hospitalization, duration of intubation, rectal tube, steroids, antibiotics, prior infections, and liver or kidney disease - but the study had low power to detect risk factors. We conclude that LVAD infections occur early, involve abx- resistant nosocomial pathogens, manifest prolonged drainage, and carry a poor prognosis. 104 Invasive Aspergillosis: an Unrecognized Disease with Ineffective Treatment. L. KAISER*, T. HUGUENIN, D. LEW, P. ROHNER, B. CHAPUIS, D. PITTET. Division of Infectious Diseases and Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland Objective : To assess the importance of unrecognized and untreated invasive aspergillosis (IA) in a tertiary health care center. Methods : 5-year retrospective study of all cases with proven IA. Cases were identified after complete review of: autopsy and biopsy records, diagnosis files of all medical wards, and discharge summaries of all patients with positive respiratory samples or any normally sterile sample growing Aspergillus spp. Stringent criteria for IA were used and cases were only patients with histopathological proven IA or with clinical features of IA and microbiologically proven aspergillosis. Results: Complete medical review was available for 35 (90%) of 39 patients with proven IA. 17 had hematologic neoplasia, 4 solid tumours, 4 BMT, 3 solid organ transplants, and 7 immunosuppressive diseases. On average, IA developed 22 days after admission. 94% of patients presented with respiratory symptoms and abnormal X-ray. IA was suspected only in 21 cases (60%) and in five of those (24%) Aspergillus spp was not isolated antemortem. IA was not suspected in 14 cases (40%), in 9 of those (64%) Aspergillus spp was not detected despite frequent microbiological screening. 38% of patients received amphotericin B an average of 10 days before the diagnosis of IA and 86% were treated at the time of IA. Death occurred in 94% of patients; infection contributed to death in 91%. Conclusions: IA is a unexpectedly unrecognized disease with ineffective treatment. New diagnosis procedures and more efficacious antifungal treatment are needed. 105 Vancomycin Control Measures at a Tertiary Care Hospital: Impact on Volume and Appropriateness of Use. M.V. SINGER* and K.E. SANDS, Beth Israel Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases, Boston, MA. Vancomycin exposure is a risk factor for colonization and infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Recent CDC guidelines recommend limiting vancomycin use to prevent emergence of these organisms. We evaluated the efficacy of specific interventions to limit the use of vancomycin in a 450-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. Measures included housestaff lectures, on-line availability of guidelines outlining appropriate vancomycin use, and automatic stop-orders on vancomycin after 72 hours. Total parenteral vancomycin use was quantified from computerized pharmacy records. A vancomycin course was defined as I or multiple doses, separated by &lt;7 days. Vancomycin days were calculated as: 1 + (vancomycin start-date minus the stop-date). Appropriateness of vancomycin use was assessed in a random sample of all inpatients who received vancomycin during a 7-month period spanning the intervention. The volume of total vancomycin use decreased from a mean of 162 courses with 938 days per month, to 134 courses with 728 days per month, in the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. When adjusted for patient-days, the reduction in total vancomycin use during the post-intervention period remained significant, as shown in the following table: Vancomycin PRE-Intervention POST-Intervention Courses'1000 Pt. Days 15.8 12.9* Days/1000 Pt. Days 91.2 69.8* * p &lt; 0.05, using z-test of proportions. Inappropriate vancomycin use decreased from 52% of total use in the pre- intervention period, to 32%/ of total use during the month following the intervention. However, from months 5 to 7 after the intervention, a consistent trend toward increasing inappropriate vancomycin use was noted. We conclude that educational neasures and specific pharmacy controls were useful in limiting total vancomycin use in the short-term: but long-terin reduction probably requires additional measures. A multi-institutional study is in progress to further exainine methods for. and impact of, limiting vancomycin use. 106 An Outbreak of Mycobacterium Chelonae Infection in Residents of a Children's Chronic Care Facility M.J. Gorensek1*, R.R. Reyesl, J. Deltoro2, J. Wong2, J. Laspada2, J. Maden2, M. OKeefe3; Cleveland Clinic Floridal, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Broward General Medical Center2, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Broward Children's Center3, Fort Lauderdale, Florida From July, 1994 through March, 1995, eight cases of Mycobacterium chelonae pulmonary infection were identified in residents of a chronic care facility for severely neurologically devastated children in South Florida. The index case was a four year old, white female, who presented with severe respiratory distress, fevers and Pseudomonas pneumonia. She subsequently grew M. chelonae from both sputum and blood cultures. Since then, M. chelonae was cultured from the sputum of seven additional children from the same facility who also presented with fevers and increasing respiratory distress. All the children were treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy and improved, although it was felt that the M. chelonae in the subsequent children represented colonization rather than true infection. An epidemiologic study is underway to try to identify a common source for the outbreak by culturing all the water supplies and respiratory equipment and should be completed within the next month. 107 Incidence of Clostridium difficile Diarrhea (CDD) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection. V CHUNDI", J PULVIRENTI, D GERDING, F KOCKA, S SAMBOL, D MARSH, S FISCHER, L GOODMAN, P DEMARAIS, J GERTZEN, G TRENHOLME, RA WEINSTEIN. Cook County Hospital (CCH), Rush Medical College, Oak Forest Hospital (OFH), Lakeside VA Hospital, Chicago, IL. C. difficile is an important cause of diarrhea in hospitals, but incidence in HIV patients is not well defined. In 1994, 285 CCH inpatients developed CDD; 100 were HIV positive. CDD rate was 1.0/1000 non-HIV inpatient days and 5.4 /1000 HIV inpatient days (p &lt; &lt; 0.01). During 1994, 13 of 35 HIV inpatients transferred to an HIV unit in a chronic care facility (OFH) developed 17 episodes of CDD (5.6/1000 OFH days), similar to the acute care rate and to the CDD rate in HIV patients transferred to OFH from other hospitals. All CCH inpatient stool samples found positive by EIA (Toxin A assay, Meridian Diagnostics) or tissue cytotoxin assay (Bartels- Baxter Diagnostics) from 11/28/94 to 3/5/95 were cultured on CCF agar (Remel): 61 patients had EIA or tissue toxin positive samples; 45 were culture positive, of which 19 were from HIV patients. The first 21 isolates were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), which showed 3 strain groups: No. Pts. with REA groups Patients I II III Clindamycin resistance (23% in HIV 6 3 1 the literature) was noted in 16 Non-HIV 11 0 0 strains (76%); 15 were group I. Case clustering was not prominent, but 5 group I patients (3 HIV, 2 non-HIV) had an identical type. Conclusion. The incidence of CDD in our HIV patients is significantly higher than in non-HIV patients. REA typing suggests a predominance of group I strains. A prospective study is underway to define the epidemiology and the relation of cases in our acute and chronic care facilities.</page><page sequence="20">738 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 108 Prevalence of Skin Colonization with Vancomycin- Resistant Enterococci (VRE) in Hospitalized Patients with Bacteremia. D. BEEZHOLD*, S. SLAUGHTER, M.K. HAYDEN, M. MATUSHEK, C. NATHAN, T.C. HU, B. SCHMITT, G. TRENHOLME, R.A. WEINSTEIN. Rush Medical College and Cook County Hospital, Chicago, IL. The clinical significance of VRE bacteremia is sometimes uncertain, sug- gesting blood culture contamination. While the GI tract is often considered to be the source of VRE bacteremia, little is known about colonization of other potential sources, such as the skin. To assess the prevalence of VRE skin colonization in hospitalized bacteremic pts, we systematically evaluated a consecutive sample of 14 pts with nosocomial VRE bacteremia and 20 pts with bacteremia due to gram negative bacilli (10) or vancomycin- susceptible enterococci (10). Of the 14 VRE bacteremia pts, 8 had clinically significant and 6 had clinically insignificant bacteremia (as defined by Maki and Agger, Medicine, 1988). Pts with VRE bacteremia were similar to other bacteremic pts in terms of demographic variables and underlying diseases. Both groups were frequently colonized with VRE: Colonization Site. % patients VRE positive Group(n) Rectal Femoral Upper body VRE bacteremia significant (8) 100 88 62 insignificant (6) 100 83 50 Other bacteremia (20) 40 25 5 Pts colonized with VRE were more likely to have received IV vancomycin prior to first positive blood culture than were pts not colonized (59% vs. 8%, p&lt;0.01). Of the 104 VRE isolates obtained, 99 (95%) were E.faecium; both vanA and vanB were detected by PCR. Preliminary PFGE analysis of 33 isolates from 4 pts with VRE bacteremia revealed 2 pts each with a single strain type and 2 other pts each with multiple strain types. Multiple types in a single pt may complicate analysis of cross-infection. In conclusion, VRE colonization was strikingly common in hospitalized bacteremic pts and was associated statistically with prior vancomycin therapy. The high prevalence of VRE skin colonization could lead to IV sepsis, cross infection, and blood culture contamination, which may explain the frequent spontaneous resolution of VRE bacteremia. 109 Risk Factors for Bloodstream Infection (BSI) During Cardiovascular Support With the HeartMate (HM) Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). S.K. SCHMITT*, S.M. GORDON, R.L. VARGO, AND P.M. MCCARTHY. Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH. Bloodstream infections are a common and sometimes fatal complication of cardiovascular support with the HM LVAD. To identify risk factors for BSI in this patient population, we performed a retrospective review of 31 patients receiving &gt;=3 days of HM support at our institution, of whom 18 patients had a total of 24 episodes of BSI (9 fungal isolates, 15 bacterial isolates). 6/9 (67%) patients with fungemia had a pre-implant course of antibiotics for proven or presumed infection, compared with 4/22 (18%) of those without fungemia (p=0.015). 12/18 (67%) patients with BSI had local signs of infection at the driveline exit site and/or tunnel (purulent exudate, tenderness, erythema, and induration), compared with 4/13 (31%) patients without BSI (positive predictive value 75%, p=0. 107). 5/9 (56%) patients with fungemia had sepsis syndrome, while only 1/22 (5%) patients without fungemia were septic (p=0.004). No associations were identified between bloodstream infection and leukocytosis, fever, or local signs of infection at the preperitoneal pump pocket. We conclude that fungemia should be suspected in HM recipients treated with antimicrobial agents in the pre-implant period and exhibiting sepsis syndrome. We further conclude that BSI commonly accompany local signs of HM driveline infection, and should be sought in this clinical setting. 110 Incidence of Fungal Prosthetic Valve Infective Endocardits (PVE) and Risk of Developing PVE In Fungemic Patients Wth Prosthetic Heart Valves. R. NASSER*, G. MELGAR, S. GORDON, B. LYTLE, T. KEYS, D. LONGWORTH, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio. A patient with a prosthetic heart valve (PHV) who develops fungemia breeds anxiety for the clinician, who must consider the possiblity of PVE. No data exist to estimate the risk of seeding PHVs during episodes of fungemia. To determine the incidence of PVE in fungermic patients (pts) with PHVs, to estimate the risk of subsequent PVE and to identify risk factors associated with PVE, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 47 pts with PHVs who developed fungemia. The Von Reyn criteria were used to establish a diagnosis at surgery or autopsy of PVE. Of the 47 pts, 11 (23%) developed fungal PVE: 8 (17%) had PVE at the time fungemia was discovered (PVE at outset) whereas 3 (6%) developed PVE a mean of 479 days after fungemia. Candida S_. were the most common isolates among all study pts (41 of 47 [87%]) and among pts with PVE (9 of 11 [82%]). In comparing the 8 pts with PVE at outset to the 39 pts without PVE at outset of fungemia, PVE at outset pts were younger (mean age 50 vs 63 yrs, p&lt;0.01), had a longer interval between valve surgery and the first positive blood culture (median 161 d vs 23 d, p &lt;.001), were more likely to have peripheral embolic signs (7/8 vs 2/27 p &lt;.001), and were less likely to have an identifiable portal of entry for fungemia (0/8 vs 32/39, p &lt;.002). The mortality rate at 12 months among all pts with PVE (27%, 3 of 11) was significantly lower than that of pts with fungemia only (70%, 23 of 33, p &lt;.03); 9 of 23 (39%) pts with fungemia without PVE underwent post-mortem examinations and all PHVs were uninfected. Ten of 11 pts with PVE underwent valve replacement; 2 pts died perioperatively and 8 pts received at least 1 gm of amphoteridn B. In pts without PVE at the time of fungemia, 3 of 39 (8%) later presented with fungal PVE. We conclude that fungemic pts with PHVs are at notable risk for the existence or subsequent development of fungal PVE. Late onset of fungemia, the presence of embolic signs and the absence of an identifiable portal of entry should heighten concern about PVE in fungemic pts with PHVs. 111 Streptococcal Group B Wound Infections Following Clean Surgical Procedures in Adults. K.O. Cleveland and M.S. Gelfand.* Methodist Hospitals of Memphis, Memphis, TN. Most cases of postoperative streptococcal wound infections are due to group A isolates (GAI) and usually present within 24 hours after surgery. Outbreaks of GAI surgical wound infections are frequently traced to a common human carrier source. We have recently observed 3 group B streptococcal (GBS) wound infections following clean orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures including lumbar laminectomy, removal of a bone spur from a knee, and repair of a closed fracture. Similar to patients with postoperative GAI infections, all patients presented with acute onset of fever and purulent drainage. GBS was isolated from the wound (3/3) and blood (2/3). Most previously reported cases of invasive GBS infections in nonpregnant adults have been associated with a chronic underlying condition, most commonly diabetes mellitus, neurologic disease, renal failure, or liver disease. Only 1 patient in this report had a chronic medical condition (renal insufficiency). We were unable to determine a common source of infection and serotyping of our isolates showed them to be unrelated. Conclusion: GBS can cause wound infection after clean surgery and clinically resembles GAI postoperative infections. 112 Candidemia In Tertiary (TH) and Community Hospital (CH) Settings. A. TEHSIN*, S. HADLEY, B. OGLEVEE, R. J. FASS. The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSU), Columbus, OH. Candida species are important causes of nosocomial blood stream infections (BSI); at OSU they are the most common cause of BSI in surgical intensive care units (ICUs). The clinical and molecular epidemiology of Candida albicans BSI in 30 patients (pts) from a TH (OSU) and 7 pts from 4 community hospitals (CH) from 2/94 to 1/95 was studied. Baseline clinical characteristics available on 34 pts (TH=30, CH=4) were as follows: No. (% by hospital setting) with clinical characteristics Age* CA ICU ICVC ITPN Ster Abx &gt;3Abx TH 42.5" 8 (27) 18(60) 24(80) 19(63) 111 (37) 25(83) 11(37) CH 55.5 3(75) 2(50) 3 (75) 250 1(25) 3(75) 2(50) CA=cancer; CVC=central venous catheter; Ster=steroids; Abx=antibiotics *Mean age; **Adults only - 8 pts were neonates Overall, the mean time to BSI was 8.6 days, and survival was 65%. 19 (56%) pts had probable CVC-related infection (any culture related to the catheter); survival was better for these patients (74% vs 53%). Antifungal MICs were available on 26 TH isolates. All were susceptible to amphotericin B; 3 were resistant (MIC &gt; 64 lag/ml) to fluconazole (FLU). None of the pts with FLU-resistant isolates had received FLU prior to BSI. Karyotyping of initial blood isolates was performed by contour-clamped homogeneous gel electrophoresis (CHEF). 9 distinct groups (gps) were identified (A-l). Gp A was the predominant pattern (25 isolates) with 5 subtypes based on lower molecular weight bands; 20 isolates from TH and all 5 from 2 CHs fit gp A. Isolates from the other 2 CHs were distinct. 5 of 8 TH neonatal isolates were indistinguishable by CHEF and may have represented horizontal transmission. Patients with serious underlying illnesses requiring aggressive medical intervention including invasive procedures are at risk of developing C. albicans BSI regardless of hospital setting. CHEF proved useful in distinguishing unrelated isolates and identifying potential outbreak isolates; similar strains, however, may require further genotypic analysis. 113 Routine Microbiologic Surveillance to Predict Infections during Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (ABMT) AMY S. COLLINS*, ALISON G. FREIFELD, VEE J. GILL, DAVID K. HENDERSON, A. JOHN BARRETT. Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD. Microbiologic surveillance methods have been employed on a routine basis to determine infection with organisms, during ABMT. Surveillance cultures are drawn on a scheduled day in the absence of associated signs or symptoms of infection. 21 pts with hematologic malignancies received weekly surveillance for a mean of 13.3 weeks/pt from 10/93 to 1/95. All pts received norfloxacin and fluconazole prophylaxis. Baseline nasal swabs were obtained to determine S. aureusscolonization. Weekly tunneled catheter exit site cultures and blood cultures were obtained. We retrospectively reviewed nasal, blood, and catheter exit site culture data to assess their impact on clinical management. Of 20 pts screened for nasal S. aureus colonization, 8 pts were positive (40%). All were treated with bacitracin; no S. aureus bacteremias occurred. 234 catheter exit site cultures were submitted; drainage was present in only one. 41 cultures were positive (17.5%) for: Corynebacterium sp.-3 (1.2%), P. acnes-3 (1.2%), group B Strep-2 (8.4%), a-hem Strep-2 (8.4%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus-26 (11%) and one of Acinetobacter, Flavimonas, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium sp. None were implicated in a disease process or resulted in specific antibiotic therapy. 375 blood cultures were submitted weekly from 21 pts (median follow-up 14 weeks). 8 cultures were positive in 5 afebrile pts. 3/8 cultures (C. jekeium, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis) represented infection because the organism appeared in multiple same-day cultures or was confirmed in follow-up cultures within 24h. 3/8 isolates (P. putida, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis) were of unclear significance due to presence in scant amounts without corroborative follow-up cultures but were nonetheless treated with antibiotics. 2/8 (S. mitis, Micrococcus sp) were considered insignificant and were not treated. 6/375 (1.6%) blood cultures were probably meaningful and lead to changes in clinical management. Overall, scheduled blood cultures in the absence of related symptoms resulted in a low yield and utility is questionable. Routine culturing of catheter exit sites appears to have no significant clinical use in the absence of signs of infection.</page><page sequence="21">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 739 114 Estimated Costs of Selected Control Measures to Comply with CDC M. tuberculosis (TB) Guidelines. S KELLERMAN, J TOKARS, W JARVIS, CDC, Atlanta, GA. During 1990-92, numerous nosocomial multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB outbreaks occurred in the U.S. associated with incomplete implementation of CDC TB guidelines. These outbreaks were controlled following an increase in administrative (e.g., prompt isolation) and environmental (e.g., improved ventilation) controls. Few data exist on the costs of these measures. To assess the one-time costs of engineering/environmental upgrades and the yearly costs of tuberculin skin testing (TST) and respirator programs, we obtained estimates of capital and yearly hospital expenditures for environmental controls, TST, and health care worker (HCW) respirator protection programs as implemented in 3 New York City hospitals with a history of MDR-TB outbreaks.

Hospital TB control costs will vary widely; however, in all hospitals where it is necessary, institution of controls will require a significant investment. 115 Value of an Infectious Disease Consultation for Nosocomial Enterococcal Bacteremia. R. T. WIBLIN* and R. P. WENZEL. Univ. of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA. Enterococcal bacteremia (EB) is an infection with high mortality caused by organisms relatively resistant to standard antibiotics. To determine the value of infectious disease consultation (IDC), we performed a nested case-control study on a cohort of 57 consecutive patients with nosocomial EB at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from 1991-92. Thirty-nine patients (68%) had IDC (cases) while 18 (32%) did not (controls). By univariate analysis, there were no significant differences between the two groups in age, gender, APACHE II score at the time of bacteremia, intensive care unit occupancy, hemodialysis, immunodeficiency (due to leukemia, AIDS, drugs), or the attending physician's years post residency. Case patients were significantly more likely to be treated with either vancomycin or a penicillin to which their enterococci were susceptible (39/39, 100%) than controls (12/18, 67%) (OR 38.5, p=0.005 Fisher's Exact-substituting 0.5 for cells with zero). Cases were significantly more likely to be treated with vancomycin or a penicillin plus an aminoglycoside (26/39, 67%) than controls (7/18, 39%) (OR 3.1, Cl95 1.1-10.4, p=0.048). Cases received significantly longer treatment with a penicillin (mean duration 10.7 days versus 3.1. p=0.02) or vancomycin (mean duration 10.8 days versus 5.6, p=0.02). In survivors, cases had significantly longer lengths of stay post bacteremia than controls (34.2 days versus 17.2 days, p=0.006). Treatment with a penicillin or vancomycin was also associated with longer length of stay in survivors (39.4 versus 9.5 days, p=0.049). After accounting for other significant predictors of survival (age, APACHE II score, and parenteral nutrition use) in a multivariate logistic model, IDC approached significance as a predictor of survival (OR 5.3, C195 0.8-52, p=0.08). IDC is valuable in nosocomial EB. It increases the frequency and duration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and may increase patient survival. 116 Outbreak of Nosocomial Clostridium difficile Diarrhea Induced by Ceftizoxime Substitution. R. OLANS*, L. VENKATARAMAN, P. DeGIROLAMI, B. ADLER, M. SAMORE. New England Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, and Malden Hospital, Malden, MA. We describe an outbreak of C. difficile diarrhea at a 200 bed community hospital associated with substitution of ceftizoxime for cefoxitin and ceftriaxone. Beginning January 1, 1992, ceftizoxime was routinely substituted for ceftriaxone and cefoxitin; during the substitution period, use of cefoxitin and ceftriaxone decreased to less than 5% of ceftizoxime. Shortly after beginning the substitution policy, the incidence of nosocomial C. difficile diarrhea increased 2-3 fold. Of 70 pts with nosocomial C. difficile diarrhea between January and April, 1992, 83% had received ceftizoxime; in a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized during February- March, 1992, ceftizoxime exposure (number of antibiotic-days) was highly associated with nosocomial C diffcile diarrhea (p&lt;.01). The frequency of use of other antibiotics did not change significantly during this time period. Nosocomial C. diffcile cases were distributed over 8 different wards and ICUs, with evidence of limited temporal clustering on 2 medical wards (p=.03); however, deficiencies in infection control practices could not be identified. Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of isolates recovered near the end of the outbreak revealed that 8 of 10 belonged to the same strain-type. By susceptibility testing, all isolates were resistant to ceftizoxime and cefoxitin. The outbreak terminated upon discontinuation of ceftizoxime use (end of April, 1992). Time Period Number Rate per 2nd/3rd Generation Nosocomial C.

PFGE analysis of isolates from pts with C. diffcile diarrhea approximately 2 years later demonstrated persistence of the outbreak strain (4 of 12 isolates). In conclusion, the temporal course of a large outbreak of nosocomial C. difficile diarrhea was highly correlated with a cephalosporin substitution program. An increased risk of C. dificile diarrhea associated with ceftizoxime has not been previously described. 117 A Case-Control Study of Mult-Drug Resistant Nosocomial Bloodstream Infections in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients. S. GREEN', N.O. FISHMAN, K. BRAYMAN, P.J. BRENNAN. University of Pennyslvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA. Nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSI) are the most common nosocomial infection among solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) at our center. NBSI occur in 5.3% of admissions at a rate of 0.94 episodes per 100 patient days. From January 1993 to June 1994, 12 episodes of NBSI in 10 transplant patients involved multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates (25%). MDR isolates included methicillin resistant S. aureus (n = 4), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (n=2), Acinetobacter baumanii (n=2), enterobacteriaceae with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (n=3) and multiple organisms (n=l). A case-control study was conducted to identify factors influencing MDR bacteremia in SOTR. Controls were matched to cases in a ratio of 3:1. The control population was selected from SOTR with bacteremias caused by organisms that were not MDR. Types of organ transplants and demographic variables were similar in the cases and controls. All patients were receiving pharmacologic immunosuppression. Factors associated with MDR bacteremia were length of stay prior to bacteremia (mean 57.8 [range 9-173] vs 32.8 [4-127], p=0.049), and total central venous catheter days prior to the episode (mean 50.8 [0-166] vs 25.5 [0-92], p=0.046). There were no significant differences in the interval since transplant or in total antibiotic days prior to bacteremia. Neither recent increase in immunosuppression, nor presence of neutropenia were statistically significant. SOTR with MDR- NBSI received a mean of 8.08 different antibiotics (range 1- 15) prior to bacteremia, while control patients received 5.89 antibiotics (0-11); this difference approached statistical significance (p=0.055). Finally, developing bacteremia with an MDR isolate was associated with significantly higher mortality compared to bactermias with susceptible pathogens (40% vs 6.3%, p=0.021). Conclusion: MDR bacteremia accounts for 25% of NBSI in our SOTR. Longer length of stay and greater number of central venous catheter days were associated with the development of MDR bacteremia. There was a trend towards greater antibiotic utilization in cases with MDR isolates. Patients with MDR bacteremia have a significantly higher mortality risk. 118 Infections Caused by Multiresistant Strains:Mortality and Risk Factors.N.GALANAKIS*, E.PAPADIMITRIOU,D.MITROPOULOS,O.SAMOLADA and H.GIA- MIARELLOU.Athens University Medical School,Greece. It is still controversial if the mortality from infections caused by multiresistant strains is higher to that caused by sensitive ones.This case control study was carried out in "Laiko General" the main University Hospital in Athens to explore this possibility.73 patients were stratified in the multiresistant infections group and 39 in the control group(sensitive infections).For statisti- cal analysis the Chi-square test and multivariant regression analysis were applied.The two groups were quite similar regarding sex,age,site of infec- tion and predisposing factors.As risk factors were considered previous hospitalation,diabetes melli- tus (DM),haematological malignancies(HM),treatment with anticancer agents and corticosteroids,previous usage of antimicrobials,renal,heart or liver insuf- ficiency ,leucopenia or leucocytosis.Results were as follows:The mortality rate was independent of microbial sensitivity and depended only on the presence of DM(p&lt;0.05),HM(p&lt;0.001) and usage of corticosteroids(&lt;0.05) for both groups.It is con- cluded that:(I)multiresistant nosocomial gram ne- gatives are not more virulent by themselves if ap- propriate antimicrobials have been administered, and (II) prognosis of multiresistant infections is dependant on previous use of corticosteroids and the presence of underlying DM or HM. 119 Descriptive Microbiologic and Epidemiologic Study of Ceftazidime-Resistant Blood Isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiellapneumoniae. D. SCHIAPPA*, F.N. HASHEMI, J. SULLIVAN, M.G. MATUSHEK, M.K. HAYDEN, R.A. WEINSTEIN, and G.M. TRENHOLME. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL. During a 27 month period at I tertiary care hospital, 30 pts. developed bactere- mia with ceftazidime-resistant (CAZ-R) E. coli (10) or K. pneumoniae (20). By double disc diffusion testing, all isolates produced an extended spectrum 3-lacta- mase. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem, amikacin and pip/tazo, but were frequently resistant to aztreonam (28/30), tobramycin (24/30), TMP/SMX (26/30), amp (30/30), pip (30/30) and cipro (14/30). Retrospective chart review revealed that 15 cases of bacteremia were detected within the first 48 hrs. of hospitalization (including 10 cases in nursing home residents) and 15 bacteremias were hospital- acquired. 10/15 hospital-acquired cases were detected while the pt. was in an ICU (MICU=7, SICU=2, and CCU=I). Pts. were often elderly with a median age of 78.5 yrs. A total of 10/30 pts. were immunosuppressed; 8/11 pts. &lt;60 yrs. old and 2/19 &gt;60 yrs. old . APACHE II scores at the time of bacteremia ranged from I1- 36 (median 21). The bacteremic source was identified as urine in 9/1 1 pts. infected with E. coli and in 9/21 pts. infected with K. pneumoniae. All cases were associated with a history of recent instrumentation (Foley catheter and/or central line and/or G or J-tube). Nineteen pts. (63%) had received antibiotics within 30 days preceding bacteremia; 12/19 received ceftazidime or aztreonam. 17/30 pts. received ceftazidime or aztreonam as initial therapy. 2/24 pts. who received appropriate therapy within 4 days died of sepsis; 3/6 pts. who never received appropriate therapy died of sepsis (Fisher exact test, p=0.04). Typing of isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of Xbal digested total genomic DNA revealed 6 different patterns among the E. coli isolates and 8 different patterns among the K. pneumoniae isolates; 3 E. coli with identical patterns were from pts. from a single nursing home and 6 K. pneumoniae isolates with identical patterns were from pts. hospitalized in the MICU. In conclusion, bloodstream infection with CAZ-R E. coli or K. pneumoniae appears to be associated with prior antibiotic use, instrumentation, elderly age or immunosuppression. Appropriate therapy administered within 4 days appears to be associated with a better outcome. Geographic clustering of some cases with identical PFGE patterns suggests nosocomial transmission.</page><page sequence="22">740 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 120 Evaluation of the Sensitivity and Specificity of Respiratory Isolation Practices Utilized to control the Spread of Tuberculosis in San Francisco General Hospital. K.A. TURNER-HUBBARD*, J.L. GERBERDING, EPI-Center, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California. Objectives: Patients are routinely placed in Special Respiratory Isolation (SRI) who have suspected or active Pulmonary or Laryngeal Tuberculosis (TB). The number of rooms at SFGH which meet the current CDC guidelines for SRI are limited. The challenge is to accurately identify and isolate all patients who have TB (increase sensitivity) and reduce the number of patients isolated who do not have TB (increase specificity). Methods: Since July 1993 patients have been prospectively evaluated for the implementation of SRI when AFB smears have been ordered. All patients who are TB culture positive are retrospectively evaluated for demographic information, risk factors, prior hospitalization and use of SRI. Results: An average of 9.97 patients were evaluated daily by AFB smear with a total of 5886 sputum samples sent for AFB smears. 552 (9.37%) were smear positive. A total of 391 (6.64%) cultures were positive from the 118 cases of active TB in hospitalized patients. Of the culture positive smears 66 (16.8%) were smear negative which represented 8 or the 118 cases. 114 (96.6%) patients were appropriately isolated. 612 (84%) patients were inappropriately in SRI for more than 4 days. Conclusions: A preliminary analysis of risk factors demonstrated that age, sex, HIV status and current living conditions were predictive of active TB. Additional data analysis will need to be collected in order to improve the specificity of respiratory isolation practices. 121 Candida infection of the arteriovenous fistula used for hemodialysis. NGUYEN MH*, YU VL, MORRIS AJ. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA; Duke Medical Center, Durham, NC. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is an exceedingly rare manifestation of Candida infection with only one case previously reported in the English literature. Major reviews on AVF infection did not document Candida as a pathogen. In a multicenter, prospective study of candidemia in which 427 patients were enrolled, 39 patients had AVF in place at the onset of candidemia; three of these 39 patients had histologically and microbiologically proven Candida fistula infection. We report these 3 cases and review the previously reported case. All cases involved the polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The presentations can be either acute or subacute in onset, with drainage at the fistula site as the most common symptom; one patient presented with sepsis syndrome but without evidence of infection at the fistula site. The diagnosis of Candida AVF infection relied on the isolation of the organism from an intraoperative culture of the fistula. Candida was isolated from blood in 3 of 4 cases, and wound drainage in 1 of 3 cases. The portal of entry was presumed to be via the AVF; 2 patients acquired the infection at the time of fistula insertion, and 2 patients via multiple needle punctures for hemodialysis. The overall mortality was 50% (2/4). One patient died of persistent Candida infection, and the other died of his underlying disease. Complete removal of the AVF appeared to be an important factor for the management of Candida AVF infection; one patient in whom only partial graft removal was performed had recurrent fungemia and graft infection. Antifungal agents play only an adjunctive role in this infection. 122 Increasing Incidence of Nosocomial Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Bacteremias among HIV-positive Patients.

From 1985 to 1992, we practiced strict isolation for patients (pts) colonized or infected with MRSA. In 1992 due to increased demand for private rooms, we changed to "modified contact isolation" for infected MRSA pts. Pts with MRSA colonization of nares and groin areas were not isolated. No MRSA pt was placed in the same room with immunocompromised pts, pts with indwelling catheters, and open wounds. 1994 1993 1992 1991 1990 Total nos MRSA bact 33 17 21 13 26 HIV+ nos MRSA bact 9 4 3 3 4 DNA pulse-field electrophoresis of MRSA blood isolates from 1993 and 1994 was performed. A common pattern was associated with 8 of the 13 HIV+ pts with nos MRSA bact in 1993 and 1994. All of them have been admitted to the Infectious Disease ward. Mean CD4 of all HIV+ pts with MRSA nos bact was 117.26, st.error 8.1, median 40, range 2-539. Cultures and DNA analysis of Infectious Disease ward staff will be performed. In conclusion, we found an increase of nos MRSA bact among HIV+ pts associated with one common pattern by pulse-field electrophoresis, after a change to more liberal isolation precautions for MRSA. MRSA nos bact was more common in pts with low CD4's (median 40) but occurred also in pts with CD4 counts above 500/mm3. 123 The Effect of Restriction of Oral Vancomycin (OVM) on Therapy of Known or Suspected C. difcile Infection in an Academic Center. SUSAN E. BEEKMANN*, REGINA C. KILNER, DAVID K. HENDERSON. Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. After failure of a computer-assisted educational intervention to decrease inappropriate use of OVM in our institution, OVM was restricted to use only with infectious diseases consultation approval beginning March 8, 1995. We elected to compare data regarding use of OVM and oral metronidazole (OMZ) from 5 months prior to OVM restriction with the first month following restriction in order to assess for inappropriate use of OVM. Use of OVM in our institution is defined as appropriate when the patient: 1) has a previous history of C. difficile (recurrent disease), 2) is age 13 years or younger, 3) has failed to improve clinically on OMZ, 4) is unable to swallow oral tablets (OMZ is only available in tablet form in our institution), or 5) has C. difficile colitis which is severe and may be life- threatening. Although we prefer that OVM not be given empirically (i.e., before toxin assay results), we allow such usage when the patient has a previous history of C. difficile and a concomitant stool specimen is sent for C. difficile toxin assay. From 3/8 through 4/8, OVM was administered to 15 patients. Eight received empiric treatment: 7 had a previous history of C. difficile and 1 had no previous history. One of the 7 with a previous history did not have a concomitant stool sent for C. difficile toxin assay. Seven of 15 patients received therapeutic OVM (ordered after toxin assay result was positive): 3 had a previous history of C. difficile, 2 failed OMZ, 1 was not able to swallow oral tablets, and 1 had no previous history of C. difficile and no evidence of severe disease. From 3/8 to 4/8,3/15 (20%) patients received OVM when OF should have been chosen. In comparison, 10/28 (36%) patients received OVM when OMZ should have been chosen in a 5 month period prior to restriction of OVM. We concude that restriction of OVM to use only with ID consultation approval in our institution resulted in a decrease in inappropriate usage of OVM. Although administration of OMZ has increased and OMZ was given in more than 50% of cases when C. difficile was documented (data not shown), inappropriate use of OVM still occurs. Education of ID consultation service fellows will be required in order to halt all inappropriate use of OVM. 124 An Unusual Source of Contamination in an Endoscopy Unit. G.DASH *, H. LICHT, M. BARNES. Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, PA Over 30 articles have been published in the literature describing outbreaks of infection after flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy due to improper cleaning, disinfection, and storage of gastrointestinal endoscopes and their components. Incidents of colitis associated with exposure to chemicals used for high - level disinfection of endoscopes (glutaraldehydes) have also been reported. When our endoscopy unit experienced two cases in one month of patients returning to hospital with severe bloody diarrhea within hours of undergoing colonoscopy we immediately began to search for an infectious etiology and to investigate the mechanism for endoscope processing. Evaluation of the cases revealed colitis but no infectious etiology was found, nor was the cleaning/disinfecting process using alkaline glutaraldehyde implicated. The cases were self- limited. Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease was not felt to be the etiology. We discovered that occasionally endoscopes, after being high - level disinfected and rinsed with sterile water, were place on a stretcher that had been cleaned with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant. Investigation, utilizing brilliant green, a fluorescent powder, showed that the endoscope was being contaminated by the quaternary ammonium disinfectant used to clean the stretcher. When the practice of placing the endoscope on the stretcher was discontinued no further cases occurred, supporting our presumption that exposure to this disinfectant was the etiologic agent for the cases of colitis. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports in the literature that implicate quaternary ammonium compounds in colitis associated with gastrointestinal endoscopy. 125 Nosocomial Legionnaires' Disease Caused by Legionella pne,nmophila Serogroup 5: Epidemiological Implications FY CHANG*, S JACOBS, JE STOUT, RM VICKERS, VL YU VA Medical Center, and University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA. The Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) mandates that all hospitals perform environmental monitoring for Legionella even if nosocomial Legionnaires' disease has not been previously diagnosed. If Legionlella is present, then laboratory tests for Legionella are indicated. L. pnenmophila serogroup 5 was recovered from the hot water system in one hospital. /. pnenmophi/a serogroup 5 is considered a relatively avirulent organism and disease caused by this serogroup is rare Prospective clinical surveillance identified 3 cases of L. pneimorphila serogroup 5 disease diagnosed by culture (3/71), urinary antigen (2/150), and serology (2/76) In one patient, .. pnleilmophila serogroup 1 antigen in urine was detected by RIA (Binax) ( the ratio to negative was 5.32), but L. pneilnophila serogroup 5 was identified by DFA and culture from sputum Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that 4 isolates from the hospital water supply (two were concurrent isolates and 2 were isolates stocked ten years ago) matched the patient isolate and were different from 4 serogroup 5 isolates recovered from 3 other hospitals This is the first report on linking L. plnenmophilc serogroup 5 to nosocomial infection using PFGE subtyping. Implications: (1) ACHD guidelines are useful for uncovering undiagnosed cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease. (2) PFGE proved useful in demonstrating that the hospital water supply was the source (3) Colonization of the hospital water supply by one /.. p)lensltnophilCa genotype was documented over a 10 year period.

J. Garbino* J-A.Romand, P.M. Suter, Y. Yue, E. Van Gessel, G. Mentha, D. Pittet. University Hospital of Geneva (HCUG), 1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland Background: Rejection and infection are major morbidities following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and it has been suggested that rejection is associated with infectious complications. Objective: To determine the relationship between rejection, rejection therapy and the development of infections following OLT. Desien: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Data from all adult patients requiring OLT between July 1987 and May 1994 at HCUG were reviewed using predetermined definitions for infectious complications and rejection episodes. Results: A total of 60 OLT were performed in 57 patients. The median follow up was 19 months. The crude mortality rates were 11% at one year and 16% a mean of 28 months after OLT; 56% of all deaths were directly attributed to infection. The overall incidence of infection was much higher during the first month after OLT; it reached 658 episodes per 1,000 patient-days during the first two weeks after OLT, but only 224 thereafter. The majority of infections were bacterial (n=52) or viral (n=50); protozoa were rarely isolated. Graft rejection occurred in 63% of all patients. Three retransplantations were performed. Overall, 83% of patients with rejection and 62% of patients without rejection had an infection (p=O. 13). Bacterial and viral infection rates were significantly higher in patients with one or more rejection episodes compared to patients without rejection (p&lt;0.03). Antirejection steroid therapy facilitated viral infection. The incidence of infection was similar in patients treated with steroids and OKT3 for rejection. Conclusions: The overall incidence of infection is high and peaks during the first month following OLT. Rejection and/or treatment induced immunosuppression increase the risk for bacterial and viral infections; however, we found no difference in infection rates between steroid and OKT3 treated patients. 127 Cost Savings Resulting from Early Switch to Oral Cefixime in the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients with Community- Acquired Pneumonia. JA RAMIREZ &amp; S AHKEE. Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY. Switch therapy is defined as early transition from intravenous to oral antibiotics during treatment of infection. This represents a new alternative to the conventional prolonged intravenous therapy. Using switch therapy, we recently reported clinical cure in 74 out of 75 patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia. Patients were treated initially with intravenous ceftizoxime or ceftriaxone (3 day treatment average) and then switched to oral cefixime and treated for 10 days (1 day in the hospital and 9 days at home). Due to the positive clinical outcome with switch therapy, a cost saving analysis from the hospital perspective, using a conventional therapy as the comparator, was performed to evaluate the savings related to the use of switch therapy in 74 patients. Data for conventional therapy was obtained from a matched historical control group from our institution. After the patients were switched to oral antibiotics, savings were calculated in 3 areas: 1) net savings in therapy cost, 2) decreased length of hospital stay attributable to early discharge, and 3) avoidance of complications associated with parenteral therapy (line sepsis). The total cost savings per patient was $1,512 and the total savings for the 74 patients was $111,902. Switch therapy is a recent change in treatment approach that is clinically effective, decreases length of stay and has a significant effect on health care costs. 128 Empiric Antibiotic Therapy in Patients without Documented Infections. S AHKEE, M BARZALO &amp; JA RAMIREZ. Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY. During their initial clinical presentation, patients without infections may have signs and symptoms compatible with an infectious etiology. The initial management of these patients may include the appropriate use of empiric antibiotic therapy. In a prospective study of antibiotic utilization, we decided to evaluate the clinical diagnosis of hospitalized patients without infections, that were started on empiric antibiotic therapy. A patient was considered not to have an infection when a clear diagnosis other than infection was subsequently made and explained the initial signs and symptoms. During a six month period, there were a total of 624 hospitalized patients that were treated empirically for suspected infections with intravenous antibiotics. There were 69 (1 1%) patients in whom empiric antibiotics were discontinued because an infection was ruled out. These patients presented initially with tachycardia in 49%, tachypnea in 36%, fever in 45% and leukocytosis in 43%. The respiratory tract was the predominant site of presumed infection, with pneumonia as the most common initial diagnosis. The most common final diagnosis was exacerbation of congestive heart failure, followed by malignancy. This study indicates that in teaching institutions, approximately 10% of empiric antibiotic use may be for patients without infections. Identification of these patients is essential for early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. This practice would decrease antibiotic associated toxicity, drug cost and emergence of bacterial resistance. 129 Antibiotic use and Resistance to Betalactams S. SAAVEDRA*, C. RIVERA-VAZQUEZ, C. H. RAMIREZ-RONDA, E. GALINDO, D. VERA. Infectious Diseases Program and Department of Medicine,VAMC, University of PR, School of Medicine, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Purpose: To determine the relationship, between the emergence of aerobic gram negative bacilli (GNB) resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and or imipenem (IMP) and the frequency of use of each antibiotic. Methods: The use of CAZ and IMP was determined from medication and pharmacy records at two time periods, prospectively yearly in 1992 and 1993 and expressed as patient days per month. The resistance of all aerobic Gram negative bacilli to CAZ and IMP was determined from microbiological records at baseline or pre-study (1991) and prospectively at the Microbiology Laboratory and ID Res Lab in 1992 and 1993. Microbiologic susceptibilities were done by the Kirby-Bauer method. Results: The overall resistance of aerobic GNB during the pre-study period was 16% to CAZ and/or ceftizoxime and 2.5% to IMP. During 1992 and 1993 CAZ and IMP use was similar (43 and 39 for IMP and 95 and 80 for CAZ in patients days per month). When the overall resistance of GNB to IMP was compared in 1992 and 1993, it rose from 3.8% to 6.3%, and to CAZ from 15% to 20%. Detailed strain analysis demonstrated that resistance to IMP in Pseudomonas aerupinosa rose from 3.2% to 12.6% and for Pseudomonas species from 33% to 70.6%. Serratia resistance was high in both study periods (28.8% and 30.6%). Analysis of CAZ demonstrated a rise in Pseudomonas aeruainosa resistance from 5.9% to 10.1% and Pseudomonas species from 21% to 56%. Conclusion: Emergence of resistance to betalactams was independent of use and other factors may play a role. 130 Erythromycin Estolate for 7 Days (7d) is Equivalent to 14 Days (14d) for the Treatment of Pertussis. SA HALPERIN', R BORTOLUSSI, JM LANGLEY, B MILLER, BJ EASTWOOD. Dalhousie Univ., IWK Children's Hosp., Halifax, Canada Despite widespread immunization, there has been an apparent increase in the incidence of pertussis in North America. Although antimicrobial therapy does not substantially modify the clinical course, treatment is recommended to eradicate Bordetella pertussis from the nasopharynx and limit spread of infection. Erythromycin has been the drug of choice and 14d is recommended to prevent treatment failures and bacteriological relapse, although data to support long therapeutic courses is non-existent. Because frequent side effects may limit compliance, we undertook a randomized trial of 7d versus 14d of erythromycin estolate (Ery) for the treatment of culture-positive pertussis using bacteriological criteria as outcome measures. Nasopharyngeal cultures were taken at the end of therapy and 1 week after the completion of therapy. In total, 208 subjects were enrolled; the median age was 4.37 years (range 0.1-41.45). There were 6 withdrawals (no follow-up culture available) from the 7d and 11 from the 14d group; most withdrew after the first visit for collection of baseline information and samples. There were also 6 protocol violations in the 7d and 1 in the 14d group that made the subject ineligible for analysis; in all cases it was due to extra days of Ery prescribed by the family physician. 184 subjects (88.5%) were eligible for analysis; 170 (81.7%) had all culture results available. 14d therapy 7d therapy Analysis sample [no.

There were no differences in the rates of eradication of B. pertussis at the end-of-therapy or bacteriological relapse I week later. The power of the study was 99.99% at a 5% level to detect a 10% difference if the true failure rate of the 14d course was 1%. We conclude that 7d of erythromycin estolate is equivalent to 14d to treat pertussis. 131 Randomized Comparative Study of the Efficacy of Amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/d) versus Standard-dose Phenoxymethyl Penicillin (P) in the Treatment of Group A Streptococcal Tonsillopharyngitis (GASP) in Children. IH GOPICHAND*, GD WILLIAMS, C SARACUSA, S MENDENDORP, J GOLDFARB Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital Standard therapy for GASP in children remains P at relatively low dose: 125mg or 250mg tid for 10 days (Redbook, Amer Acad Pediatr, 1991). The perceived recent decrease in P effectiveness for therapy of GASP may be due to inadequate P dosing. This randomized, single-blinded prospective study was conducted to determine whether a higher dose of an oral penicillin is more effective than standard P dosing for therapy of GASP. Children 3-18 years of age with clinical illness suggesting GASP were randomized to receive either amoxicillin(A): 40 mg/kg/d or P: 125mg (&lt;60 lb) or 250mg &gt; 60 lb) TID for 10 days. Only TC + pts were continued in the study. Compliance was monitored. Clinical and microbiological outcomes were compared. Isolates from follow-up +TC have been saved for serotyping. 147 pts were enrolled and 106 pts were evaluable.

M.J. KUNKEL*, A.D. TICE and the OPIVITA study group. Danbury Hospital, Danbury, CT. Ten centers providing outpatient intravenous therapies tracked serious adverse reactions to antibiotics over a four month period. A "serious adverse event" was defined as "a reaction or event due to the antibiotic used of suffi- cient severity to prompt discontinuation of the antibiotic, not merely change the dose used". Data were collected for each therapeutic episode on a uniform data collection card and entered into a database for analysis. Key data elements collected included center and patient identifier, patient age and sex, infection treated, antibiotics and dose used, inpatient and outpatient dates of therapy, and occurrence of adverse events characterized by type, severity, and outcome. 607 courses of therapy were analyzed. Infections most commonly treated were cellulitis (162), osteomyelitis (103), abscess (55), wound infection (37), and urinary infection (35). Antibiotics most commonly used were ceftriaxone (257), vancomycin (134), ceftazidime (31), cefazolin (29), and oxacillin/ nafcillin (26). Serious adverse events occurred in 34 (6% incidence): vancomycin 11 (8%), ceftriaxone 8 (3%), oxacillin/nafcillin 3 (12%), clindamycin 3 (16%), piperacillin 2 (33%), aztreonam 2 (66%), penicillin 1 (8%), amp/sulbactam 1 (50%), cefotetan 1 (25%), gent/tobra 1 (5%), ganciclovir 1 (9%). Anaphy- laxis/angioedema occurred in 4 patients: ceftriaxone (2), piperacillin (1), penicillin (1). 3 of 4 episodes occurred during therapy and as late as day 30. Late reactions were not as severe as "first dose" anaphylaxis and were treated successfully. Other reactions were rash (16), fever (4), laboratory abnormality (4), diarrhea (2), nausea/vomiting (1), hearing loss (1). Serious adverse reactions do occur in outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy across all classes of drug. Anaphylaxis does occur and may be de- layed. Patient education in recognition and emergency treatment of these reactions is important. 133 Demographic, Clinical, and Treatment parameters influencing outcome of acute cystitis. R.M. Echols*, R. L.Tosiello Bayer Corp. Medical Research, West Haven, CT 06516 From 1989-1993 3,108 women with acute cystitis were enrolled in 6 separate double-blinded clinical trials evaluating 11 different treatment regimens including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, TMP/SMX and nitrofurantoin. Treatment duration ranged between single dose to 7 days. Entry criteria for all studies were identical: age &gt;17, acute symptoms of frequency/dysuria, midstream urine culture with &gt;103 cfu/ml of a single pathogen. Bacteriologic and clinical evaluations in 2,409 valid patients were performed 4-9 days (EOT) and 4-6 weeks (F/U) following study drug administration. Pathogens identified were E. coli (78.6%), S. saphrophyticus (4.4%), K pneumoniae (4.3%), P. mirabilis (3.7%), and "other" (9%). The median age was 26 yrs. Bacteriologic eradication at EOT occurred in 93% of patients. A logistic regression analysis included variables of patient demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters and treatment (drug class and duration). Parameters associated with successful bacteriologic outcome at EOT were (odds ratio; p-value): not using diaphragm (3.4; 0.0041), treatment &gt;3 days (6.2; 0.0043), pathogen not "other" (1.9; 0.0043), symptom duration &lt; 2 days (1.5; 0.0096), African American (2.6; 0.0147). At F/U, quinolone Rx (1.6;0.0035) was associated with increased probability of success while "other" pathogen (1.8;0.0018) and K. pneumoniae (1.7;0.0496) were associated with increased probability of bacteriologic failure. The presence ofpyuria (&gt;10 WBC/hpf) did not correlate with outcome and was inversely correlated with cfu &gt; 105. Conclusion: this large database identifies new parameters associated with treatment outcomes of acute cystitis in women. 134 Risk-factors for Resistance to "First-line" Antibiotics among Urinary Tract Isolates of E. Coli in Children. U. ALLEN*, L. FUITE, N. MACDONALD, F. CHAN, T. DARRAGH, C. BERGERON, J. TOBIN, H. ETHERINGTON. Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of "first-line' antibiotic resistance and related risk-factors among urinary isolates of E. coli in a pediatric setting. METHODS: A surveillance study was conducted from 12/92 to 12/94. Susceptibility testing of urinary tract (GU) isolates of E. coli was done using VITEK. The Kirby-Bauer method was used on a subset for comparison. Antibiotics tested included ampicillin (A), gentamicin (G), trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (T-S), ticarcillin (TI) and cefotaxime (CEF). A case-control study was conducted for subjects with T-S-resistant isolates; cases were matched (1:1) to controls with T-S-sensitive isolates in the same period + 6 months. RESULTS: There was excellent (98%) agreement between both methods of susceptibility testing. 1645 consecutive isolates were obtained: Antibiotics A T-S A&amp;T-S G A&amp;G CEF TI # Resistant 736 514 363 47 27 2 650 % Resistant 45 31 22 2.9 1.6 &lt; 1 39.5 In the case-control study, 274 different subjects with T-S resistant isolates were identified along with 274 controls; median age of cases 4.5 years, controls 6.7 years. Female:male 2.4: 1 vs 2.3:1. Among 155 subjects on antibiotics for &gt; 4 weeks in the previous 6 months, 87% (136/155) had T-S resistance (P &lt; .0001). Additional risk factors included prophylactic antibiotics(P &lt; .0001), any GU tract abnormality (P &lt; .001), spina bifida (P &lt; .0001), GU reflux (P = 0.02), cancer diagnosis (P = 0.03). More outpatients had resistant isolates compared with inpatients (P = .024). Among 43 children with pyelonephritis, 42% (18/43) and 44% (19/43) had isolates resistant to T-S and A, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 1). The results imply that selective antimicrobial pressure is strongly associated with resistance in this study. 2). The finding of isolates resistant to both ampicillin and gentamicin is of major importance to the empiric therapy of neonatal sepsis. 3). Cheap "first-line" agents may no longer be able to treat outpatient urinary tract infections in the near future. 135 Safety and Efficacy of Cefprozil as Part of a Parenteral- Oral Antibiotic Regimen in the Treatment of Suppurative Skeletal Infections in Children. M. TRUJILLO*, S. EHRETT, MJ. HOYT- SEHNERT, S. SHELTON, G.H. MCCRACKEN, JR. UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, TX. A combined parenteral-oral antimicrobial regimen has proven safe and effective for treatment of skeletal infections in children. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of cefprozil (90 mg/kg/d div tid), an orally administered second generation cephalosporin, for treatment of suppurative arthritis (SA) and osteomyelitis (0) in children up to 13 yrs of age. Pts admitted to Children's Medical Center or Parkland Memorial Hospital with clinical signs of SA or O and purulent synovial fluid (SF), positive cultures (blood, SF, bone), or positive radiological studies (MRI, bone scan) were eligible. 25 pts were enrolled between May/93 and September/94, 2 were excluded because of technical difficulties. 23 pts were evaluated, 10 (43%) had O and 12 (53%) had SA. Median age was 24 mo (range 4-120) and 14 (61%) were male. Median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 d (range 1-19). 22 pts underwent diagnostic surgical procedures (needle aspiration or incision and debridement). An etiology was established in 12 (52%) pts: S. aureus in 7, S. pneumoniae in 2, and group A Streptococcus in 1. All isolates had an MIC to cefprozil of &lt; 1.0 ug/ml. Pts were hospitalized for a median of 11 d (range 4-78), IV antibiotics were administered for a mean ? SD 9.7 ? 9.1 d. Cefprozil was initiated when clinical and inflammatory indices (falling ESR and C-reactive protein) showed improvement. Mean ? SD duration of oral antibiotic therapy was 26.4 + 16.4 d. Serum inhibitory (SIT) and bactericidal (SBT) titers were performed on the patients' isolates or a laboratory strain of S. aureus when no organism was recovered, with median titers of 1:32 (range 1:8-1:2048) and 1:16 (range 1:8-1:2048), respectively. Cefprozil was well tolerated, only one pt developed diarrhea. Pts were followed clinically for 6 months after discharge. One pt was lost to follow up. Two children with chronic osteomyelitis were treated with cefprozil for 10 weeks limit defined by protocol with improvement of clinical and inflammatory indices while receiving therapy. At 1 mo visit 7/20 (35%) were improved and 13/20 (65%) were asymptomatic. Seventeen pts have completed 6 mo follow- ups and all are asymptomatic. The remaining 3 pts will complete their 6 mo follow up soon. We conclude that cefprozil is a suitable alternative for treatment of O and SA in children following an initial course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy. 136 Shigellosis in Arab Children, A.F. KAGALWALLA*, M. AL SHAALAN, A. MUTAIR, S. AL AJAJI, S. SEAYED, A. ABUTALIB, Y.A. KAGALWALLA, Z. MEMISH and M.Y. KHAN. King Fahad National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Shigellosis, a common bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract, is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young infants and children. The antimicrobial sensitivity of this pathogen varies in different geographic areas. The objective of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological features of the infection in Saudi Arabian children and to evaluate the sensitivity of the Shigella isolates to the commonly recommended antimicrobial agents. Four hundred and eighty seven cases of shigellosis were identified during the 10 year study period. The mean age at presentation was 54 months in 275 males and 212 females. The common clinical features encountered included diarrhea in 90%, fever 83%, bloody diarrhea 25%, and seizures 10%. Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri were the common species isolated in 44 and 41% cases, respectively. Antimicrobial sensitivity revealed 39% sensitive to ampicillin, 16% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and 13% to tetracycline. All the isolates tested were sensitive to nalidixic acid and ceftriaxone. In conclusion, shigellosis is a common infection in our population. As quinolones are not approved for use in young children, prevalence of high level of resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole among Shigella isolates mandates evaluation of alternate oral agents for treatment of this infection in children. 137 Role of Ceftriaxone (CRO) in the outpatient treatment of penicil- lin-susceptible streptococcal endocarditis (PSSE). D. STAMBOULIAN*, E. CARBONE, C. NAGEL, E. ARGUELLO, M. MARIN, I.CASSETTI. Fundaci6n del Centro de Estudios Infectol6gicos, FUNCEI, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Patients (pts) with PSSE are commonly hospitalized for 2-3 weeks to receive iv anti- biotics. Since CRO has a prolonged half-life and is highly active against streptococci (MIC,; &lt;0.25 p/ml), it is an alternative to the ambulatory treatment of PSSE given once-a-day. Two prior studies, one of them began in January 1987 at our Institution, demonstrated that CRO is effective and safe in the treatment of PSSE. Here we report an 8-year follow-up of our investigation. Until December 1994, 39 adults with defined criteria for PSSE were assigned to re- ceive either one daily dose of CRO 2g iv or im for 4 weeks (group 1) or one daily dose of CRO 2g iv or im for 2 weeks, followed by oral amoxicillin 1 g q.i.d. for 2 additional weeks (group 2). Subjects were partially or completely treated as outpatients after the presence of cardiovascular risk such as heart failure, aortic insufficiency, and conduc- tion system abnormalities, neurologic symptoms and thromboembolic diseases were excluded. We particularly evaluated the clinical and microbiological outcome. Of the 39 pa- tients, 18 were enrolled in group 1 and 21 in group 2. The mean ages of pts in group 1 and 2 were 63.5 years (range, 30-81) and 67.7 (range, 28-80), respectively. Aortic valve alone was affected in 18 pts, mitral valve alone in 16, aortic and mitral in 2, and 3 pts had defects of the septum. Streptococcus viridans was isolated in 20 pts, S. bovis in 18, and S. agalactiae in 1. The MICG of CRO for the isolates was &lt;0.25 pg/ml. CRO was given iv to 17 pts, im to 14 pts, and both iv and im to 8 pts. All, except one pt, achieved clinical cure. One patient had fever and elevated sedimentation rate 3 months after comple- tion of therapy. Blood cultures were negative, but the patient, a probable relapse, cured after treatment with CRO followed by oral amoxicillin. 14 pts were entirely treated as outpatients, and 20 were initially hospitalized and discharged soon after diagnosis of PSSE. Only 5 patients were treated as inpatients. Using CRO, 520 days of hospitaliza- tion were avoided. Side effects related to CRO were mild and included nausea (n=l), diarrhea (n=2), dizziness (n= ), rash (n= I), transient neutropenia (n= I), chemical phle- bitis (n= I ), and local pain at the site of im administration. In conclusion, CRO alone or followed by oral amoxicillin was safe and effective in the treatment of PSSE. Once daily administration of CRO allowed us to treat pts with PSSE as outpatients, reducing costs and decreasing the hospitalization days.</page><page sequence="25">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 743 138 Augmentin Susceptibility In 3564 Commonly Encountered Gram Negative Bacilli In A Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital:1984 - 1994. N.C.BODONAIK* and R.SUE-HO.University of the West Indies,Kingston,Jamaica. Augmentin susceptibility in strains of E coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus encountered in 1984(before the introduction of Augmentin), 1991 and 1994 at the University Hospital of the West Indies were analysed.The tests were done by standard Disc-diffusion(Kirby-Bauer) method using Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% lysed horse blood.Well preserved commercial Augmentin discs were used and the tests were controlled with E coli ATCC 25922.The results are depicted in the table below Organism Year/Number tested(% susceptible) 1984 1991 1994 E coli 413(93) 379(67) 520(60) Klebsiella 369(92) 271(80) 348(71) Enterobacter 277(57) 230(47) 208(50) Proteus 230(91) 151(80) 168(68) Detailed analysis of zone size distribution in 467 isolates which were not susceptible to Augmentin in 1994 revealed two patterns.The vast majority(65%) of such strains of E coli,Klebsie- lla,and Proteus were categorized as moderately susceptible(zone size 14-17 mm).On the other hand,73% of such strains of Enterobacter belonged to the resistant category(zone size-613 mm). Overall,the number of isolates showing complete susceptibility to Augmentin(zone size :18 mm) has decreased markedly in the 10 years since its introduction in this Hospital in 1985. 139 Monthly Changes in the Rate of Recovery of Penicillin Resistant Organisms from Children. ITZHAK BROOK and ALAN E. GOBER, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC The rate of recovery of aerobic and anaerobic beta- lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) and other penicillin resistant bacteria in the oropharynx was investigated. Each month over a period of a year, 30 children who presented with upper respiratory tract infection were studied. The maximal total number of BLPB and number of patients with BLPB (60% of patients) was in April and the lowest was in September (13%). A gradual increase of these organisms occurred from September to April, and a slow decline took place from April to September. Penicillin resistant S. pneumonia were isolated in one to two patients between December and April. All of these changes correlated directly with the intake of beta-lactam antibiotics. Monitoring the local seasonal variation in the rate of penicillin resistant bacteria may be helpful in the empiric choice of antimicrobials. Judicious use of antimicrobials may control the increase in penicillin resistant bacteria. 140 Comparison of Agar Dilution MIC, Epsilometer Test (Etest) and Bauer-Kirby (B-K) Disk Diffusion Test for Susceptibility of 101 Strains of Sreptococcus pneumoniae from Southeastern Pennsyl- vania to Penicillin, Cefprozil, Cefepime, Piperacillin, Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, and Cefpodoxime. T. FEKETE* and J. WOODWELL. Temple University Sch. of Med., Philadelphia, PA. With the concern about potentially resistant pneumococci in the USA, we evaluated the current state of drug susceptibility and the comparability of 3 different in vitro testing systems for S. pneumoniae in southeastern Pennsylvania.

The most resistant strains may be less susceptible to multiple agents in several classes (with the exception of ciprofloxacin). Timely measurement ofpneumococcal susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials appears to be warranted, and epsilometer or Bauer- Kirby test results should correlate reliably with agar dilution MIC. 141 Pediatric Vancomycin(V) Utilization. M.A. JACKSON*, I. GUPTA, D. NITTA, L.C. OLSON, V.F. BURRY. The Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City MO Over a 6 mos period, 239 of 3519 (6.8%) children admitted to a mid-western children's hospital were treated with V (18 pts had multiple admits and/or V courses). Most pts had underlying conditions: 54(31%) oncologic, 40(23%) surgical, 23(13%) neonatal, 13(10%) renal; 40 pts were admitted to 7 other services. Data abstracted from chart review were used to assign 175 pts into groups based on bacterial infection (BI) type; these groups were compared for duration of V therapy, V monitoring and outcome. Group n V days V levels (avg) (avg #/pt) 1. BI 74 6.2 5.3 2. Clinical BI 24 7.2 4.2 3. BI, V not necessary 42 6.5 3.9 4. BI, V drug of choice 35 8.0 5.7 Infections in Group 3 pts were due to methicillin susceptible pathogens or gram-negative bacilli. Group 4 pts had methicillin resistant staphylococcal or enterococcal infection. Avg therapy was 6.4 days (range 1-22 days); 70 courses lasted &lt; or =72 hrs. No death was infection related. 1013 V levels were performed (4/pt, range 1-26): 465 before and 548 after day 3 of therapy at a cost of $103,853. Pt who had pharmacokinetic consult had fewer levels; however, the information was not utilized to guide Rx in pts readmitted. These data suggest that V therapy could be used more selectively and more cost effective decision making could be used in monitoring V therapy. 142 USE OF VANCOMYCIN IN A VETERANS' ADMINSTRATION TEACHING HOSPITAL. *MB GOETZ, MJ O'BRIEN Primarily in response to the emergence of multiply resistant Enterococcus species, the CDC issued a 1994 guideline urging judicious use of vancomycin (VNC). For two discrete periods in 1994/5, summer and winter, we retrospectively studied the usage of intravenous VNC at our institution. To distinguish appropriate from inappropriate use, we adopted a moderate interpretation of the CDC's not fully detailed recommendations. With an N=259, 144 (56%) were deemed appropriate; 64 (25%) inappropriate; 51 (20%) were not classified because of difficulty obtaining full data. Incidents of inappropriate use included: use of VNC with culturing either not appropriately performed, or not appropriately interpreted, 35 (14% of total); empiric use in the non-neutropenic exceeding 3 days, with cultures at the end of 3 days negative, 15 (6%);surgical prophylaxis either exceeding 36 hours where new infection was not suspected, or in surgeries not involving prosthesis placement, 10 (4%); use in response to a sole positive coagulase negative Staphylococcus blood culture in a patient without implanted hardware, 4 (2%). 143 Surgical prophylaxis with antimicrobial agents: a judgment made with an observational study. B. PADILLA, S. MORENO, MD DIAZ, A. MENASALVAS, MC. MENARGUEZ and E. BOUZA*. Hospital General Universitario "Gregorio Maraoln". Madrid. Spain. Compliance of antimicrobial prophylaxis in clean and clean- contaminated surgery is a very important aspect of the antibiotic policy of a general hospital. Along the period 1985 to 1994 annual surveys of antimicrobial use at our institution, showed a progressive increase in the overall adequacy of antimicrobial use that evolved from 35% in 1985 to 54% in 1994. Nevertheless, the adequacy of antimicrobial use in surgical prophylaxis showed a recent deterioration (69% antimicrobial misuse in 1994). New guidelines were discussed and agreed upon with all surgical services of the institution. Two months after the implantation of those guidelines, we performed a prospective observational study of the 164 patients who underwent clean and clean contaminated surgery during a week. A total of 164 patients (48% men and 52% women) underwent clean (105-64%) and clean contaminated (59-36%) procedures of which 102 required antimicrobial prophylaxis (100% adequate indication). Antibiotic misuse was detected in 32 cases (31%) a substantial improvement with prior figures. The reasons for misuse were: route of administration (1 case), moment of initiation of antimicrobial drugs (3 cases), selection of the antibiotic (7 cases- 7%) and inadequate duration of prophylaxis (26- 25.5%). An ideal use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery could have saved a further $8 per patient with an annual estimated amount of savings of $67.000 estimating only drug costs. The observational study turned out to be a very simple and easy to use instrument for the follow-up of the guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery in a general hospital.</page><page sequence="26">744 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 144 In vitro Activity of CP-99,219 against Sensitive and Resistant Aerobic Bacteria using Standard Microdilution Broth Method (MDBM) and E-test (ET). LM DEMBRY*, PA FARREL, LE GERRITY, VT ANDRIOLE. Yale University, New Haven, CT. A comparison of MDBM MIC (triplicate) versus ET (duplicate) of CP-99,219, a new flouroquinolone, was performed for multiple strains of gram-positive and gram- negative bacteria as well as a comparison of in vitro activity of CP-99,219 versus ciprofloxacin (C) and ofloxacin (0).

JJ Leyden, BR Vowels*, C Sloughfy, AN Foglia, N Konnikov, P Starkey, and D Feingold. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Tufts University Medical Center, Boston; SmithKline Beecham, Parsippany, NJ Use of topical erythromycin (E) for extended periods of time results in an increased density of E-resistant (ER) staph as compared to baseline levels. While &gt;80% of individuals carry ER staph, it is not clear whether the increased density of ER staph is the result of acquiring exogenous ER staph or the result of expansion of indigenous populations. Moreover, it is not known if the prolonged use of topical E results in the acquisition of multi-drug resistance. To address these issues, a total of 225 subjects were enrolled in Philadelphia and Boston and were divided into two unbalanced, coded groups consisting of treatment with 2% topical E (n=179) or vehicle (V) only (n=46). To assure compliance, 0.2 gm E or V was applied to the subjects forehead twice a day by lab personnel for a period of 6 weeks. Subjects were sampled for culture from the forehead, anterior nares and back immediately prior to first application of E or V, after 6 weeks of E or V, and at 3 and 6 weeks following cessation of E or V. Samples were cultured on differential media to allow identification of staphylococci, gram negative rods (GNR), and yeast. E incorporation plates (8 ug/ml) were used to identify E resistant staph. All ER staph were speciated and an antibiogram of 16 antibiotics was obtained. Antibiogram data was analyzed longitudinally from all three sample sites for all ER staph spp., ER S. epidermidis alone, and ER staph except S. epidermidis. For all subjects at all sampling times and in each staph group, there was a significant association of ER with resistance to only penicillin, ampicillin and clindamycin. However, since this association was present at baseline and in the V group, it cannot be ascribed to the action of E. These data demonstrate that prolonged use of topical E does not induce multiple drug resistance. The percentage of staph resistant to a any one antibiotic remained constant over the treatment period in the E-treated group; however, in the V-treated group, there were random fluctuations in the percentage of staph resistant to a any one antibiotic. This suggests that the increased density of ER staph is the result of an expansion of indigenous organisms. 146 Treatment of Bacterial Abscesses without Drainage. D.M. BAMBERGER.* University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, MO. Usual treatment of most bacterial abscesses, except lung or tubo-ovarian abscesses, involves antimicrobials with surgical or catheter drainage. Increasing clinical evidence suggests that other abscesses, especially those involving the brain, liver, and kidney, may respond to antimicrobial therapy without drainage. The reasons why some abscesses can be treated successfully without drainage remain unclear. To study this issue, an English language Medline literature search (1966-1994) of all bacterial abscesses in which medical treatment without drainage was purposefully attempted was performed. Cases with only small volume (&lt;5cc) diagnostic aspirates were allowed, and to be included in the study the outcome had to be stated. 467 cases were identified, including 177 liver abscesses, 144 brain abscesses, 55 renal abscesses, 44 epidural abscesses, 19 subperiosteal orbital space abscesses, 6 pancreatic abscesses, 6 heart abscesses, and 1 seminal vesicle abscess. Overall success rate of antimicrobial therapy without drainage was 85.9%. The following factors were analyzed to determine if they could predict a successful outcome: location (organ involved) of the abscess, duration of symptoms before treatment, abscess size, presence of multiple abscesses, type of organisms involved (single aerobic gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobic or mixed infection), type of antimicrobial used (p-lactam alone or 0-lactam combined with aminoglycoside), use of corticosteroids, and duration of treatment. The only factors that predicted a good outcome were abscess size &lt;5cm in diameter (odds ratio 38.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.10-704), only a single organism involved (odds ratio 5.22, 95% CI 1.55-17.6), and length of therapy &gt;28 days (odds ratio 48.1, 95% Cl 6,09-380). In conclusion, many bacterial abscesses can be treated without drainage, and small abscess size, presence of a single organism, and length of treatment may predict a favorable outcome. Further prospective studies should be done to determine the factors that are associated with a favorable outcome. 147 A Prospective Study of Antibiotic-Induced Granulocytopenia (AIG) in Patients with Septic Arthritis or Osteomyelids (SAO). ].A. McREYNOLDS, A. KEERASUNTONPONG, L.M. BADDOUR, E.A. SMITH, R.]. SMITH, I.M. HIMELRIGHT.* University of Tennessee Medical Center at Knoxville, Knoxville, TN. Granulocytopenia can be a complicating adverse event of patients on long-term antibiotic therapy, especially beta-lactams. Regular monitoring of the peripheral white blood cell count (WBC) with differentials and revision of antibiotic therapy when indicated minimize the risk of developing severe granulocytopenia. The reported incidence of antibiotic-associated neutropenia ranges from 0. 13-8%. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence and characteristics of patients with SAO on prolonged courses of antibiotics who developed AIG. Thirty-eight consecutive evaluable cases with SAO were collected over two years. The majority of patients were monitored at least weekly by peripheral WBC counts with differentials throughout antibiotic therapy. Granulocytopenia was defined as a granulocyte count below 2,000 cells/mm3. Of the 38 patients, 9 (23.6%) developed granulocyte counts below 2,000 cells/mm3. Four patients had granulocyte counts below 1,500 cells/mm3. Significantly more (p&lt;0.025) females developed AIG than males (6 of 13 vs. 3 of 25, respectively). Average age was 36 years for females and 27 years for males for patients with AIG. The mean number of days on antibiotic therapy for patients with AIG was 92 days. The mean number of days of antibiotic therapy before AIG was documented was 19 days. Based on our findings, AIG may be more common than previously reported, particularly in females; therefore, routine monitoring of WBC is warranted throughout the duration of therapy. Ongoing investigations seek to identify additional risk factors in the development of AIG. 148 Synergy in Gentamicin and Ampicillin Resistant Enerooooci. I.S. DOMBO*, M. ZERVOS, M.B. PERRI, L.A. THAL. William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI Itroduction: Antibiotic resistance among enterococci is a major obstacle to therapy. The synergistic combination of penicillin and aminoglycosides are essential to eradicate serious infections such as endocarditis. Methods: We reviewed all blood cultures positive for enterococci from January 1992 to June 1993. Medical records were reviewed and cases selected for study were those who met the case definition of endocarditis. Patients with high-level (MIC&gt;2000 ug/ml) entamicin-resistant enterococci (HLGR) were excluded. MIC's were determined using microdilution methods. Synergy tests were done using time kill curves using ampicillin ad gentamicin and subinhibitory combinations of antibiotics at concentrations varying from 1/4 to 3/4 MIC. Clinically achievable concentrations of each of the different concentrations of antibiotics were used. Resistance was defined for gentamicin as moderate if MIC's were from 8-2000 ug/ml and ampicillin MIC's &gt; 16. Synergy was &gt; 2 log, CFU reduction in growth with the combination of two antibiotics as compared to individual antibiotics. esults. Sixty-six records were reviewed and 21 cases met the case definition for ndocarditis; 2 were definite, 13 probably, 6 possible. MIC's for these organisms determined that one of 21 organisms was resistant to ampicillin and had high-level gntamicin resistance. Fifteen organisms were resistant to ampicillin. Eleven organisms showed resistance to gentamicin (at MIC's of&gt;8-2000 ug/ml). Eleven organisms were oonsidered as having intrinsic or moderate gentamicin resistance. Only 6 organisms were resistant to both gentamicin (MIC &gt; 8 but &lt; 2000 ug/ml) and ampicillin (MIC &gt; 16 ug/ml). Time kill curves showed synergy for these 6 organisms at concentrations as low a at 0.25 the MIC's of both drugs tested. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that for moderately gentamicin resistant and ampicillin resistant strains these agents can still show synergy of bactericidal killing at ievels as low as 1/4 MIC's of each of the 2 drugs. These levels approximate serum levels achieved in therapy of patients with serious enterococcal infection. These data indicate dat despite increased intrinsic antibiotic resistance, ampicillin and gentamicin can be ooosdered for thrapy of sme sious eterocoocal infections. 149 Agar Dilution Susceptibility of 66 Isolates of MRSA Against Quinupristin/Dalfopristin (SynercidR) in a Health Sciences Center in Southwest U.S. V. QUENZER, R.W. QUENZER*, G. SCULLY, J.C. MCLAUGHLIN. University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), when isolated as a cause ofnosocomial or serious infection, poses significant difficulty in treatment. Current therapy generally consists of i.v. vancomycin, but SynercidR may be another choice. SynercidR is a water-soluble, injectable streptogramin antimicrobial that is active against gram positive bacteria including MRSA and vancomycin resistant enterococci. Sixty-six MRSA islolates were obtained from patients at the University of New Mexico Health Science Center during a recent outbreak from 9/94 to 3/95. Thirty-four were outbreak isolates and thirty-two were non-outbreak isolates as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The MIC (mcg/ml) of SynercidR was determined by agar dilution method which followed NCCLS guidelines and used both MRSA (ATCC#29247) and MSSA (ATCC#29213) as controls. One patient with limb threatening MRSA osteomyelitis suffered a severe systemic adverse reaction to vancomycin and leukopenia to teicoplanin (furnished by Merrill Dow for compassionate use) but was successfully treated with SynercidR. The range of MICs of the 66 isolates was 0.125 mcg/ml to 1.0 mcg/ml with 92% being 0.5-1.0 mcg/ml. SynercidR was effective for both outbreak and non-outbreak MRSA's. The isolate from the patient with osteomyelitis had an MIC of 0.25 mcg/ml. In vitro susceptibilities show that SynercidR may be an alternative therapy for MRSA when choices are limited by antibiotic resistance or patient tolerability to certain agents.

A. STAHL,* W. GOLDMAN, E. CHAPNICK, L. LUTWICK, P. BARBER, O. SCHAENING, I. TAK, R. JACQUES, and the MAIMONIDES ANTIBIOTIC SURVEILLANCE PHARMACISTS. Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. For 3 years, the Division of Infectious Diseases (ID) has been responsible for approving the use of non-formulary AB using an approval system that educates physicians to better use AB. In the process, patients receive the best therapy, resistance to AB is addressed and the overall cost of AB is reduced. In a 2 week period, 142 requests for non- formulary AB were reviewed, and 126 charts were available. We found a 10% prevarication rate. To get approval for costlier, broader-spectrum AB, physicians fabricated patients' signs and symptoms in 1/3 of the cases of false data submission. Aztreonam was the most frequently requested AB. Other inconsistencies were in the areas of Gram stain, reported organisms, AB sensitivities, prior therapy and infection site. 75% of the cases were on 3 nursing units. Ihe proportion of approval requests which included false information was similar in the medical (9%) and surgical (10%) services. We found that inaccurate information is given to obtain non-formulary AB. This can cost the institution approximately $61,230 per year, leading to the use of non-preferred agents and setting up potential AB resistance. 151 Antimicrobial (AB) Control System (CS) Effect on AB Costs Compared to the Total Pharmacy Budget, 1989-1994. L. LUTWICK*, S. DePAOLO, R. SMITH, A. STAHL, W. GOLDMAN, E. CHAPNICK, O. SCHAENING, I. TAK, R. JACQUES and A. HAKIM. Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY. In this era of more financial restrictions placed on health care organizations, fiscal belt tightening must occur. We report on 6 years of pharmacy costs comparing ABs, controlled (C) and non-C, to the overall pharmacy budget. The increase (t) in total pharmacy budget from 1989 ($6.4 million (M)) to 1994 ($11.2 M) was 76%. This t was due entirely, 97%, to the non-AB costs. The AB budget t was parallel to the total pharmacy budget until 1992 when the current CS was begun. By 1994, the AB budget had decreased (6) by $380,000 (19%) while total non-AB budget had t by $2.4 M (33%). The AB cost savings were in both C AB (21%) and non-C AB (16%). These effects were mediated by a combination of educational and interventional measures of the CS personnel. The 3 year cost savings in the AB budget was $481,000 and the AB part of the total AB budget I from 21% in 1991 to 14% in 1994. This CS is a joint effort of the Infectious Disease physicians and AB pharmacists with -he support of the hospital. If a parallel 1 occurred in the total budget, the savings could be much greater. This can occur only if the same cooperation and effort is given to the use of therapeutic agents by other disciplines. 152 Retrospective Cohort Study of Multidrug- Resistant (MDR) Typhoid Fever (TF) in Egypt. WW EMMONS*, DR TRIBBLE, NI GIRGIS, SB BASSILY, NA EL-MASRY, Y SULTAN, M KLEINOSKY, and G RODIER (US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 and Abbassia Fever Hospital). A retrospective review of blood culture-confirmed TF cases involved in clinical trials from 1985-93 compared the clinical courses of 151 MDR &amp; 104 antibiotic susceptible (AS) typhoidal Salmonella strains in a nonsurgical referral fever hospital in Cairo, Egypt. The admission periods were significantly different, with 67.3% AS cases occurring pre-1990 and 100% MDR cases after 1990. There were no significant gender differences between groups, but the mean age (SD) of MDR and AS cases differed, 12.4 y (+/- 7.5) and 15.1 y (+/- 8.3), respectively (P &lt; .01). Preadmission antibiotic therapy was also different, with the mean # days of antibiotics (SD) in the MDR group being 8.35 d (+/- 6.49) and 3.83 d (+/- 3.91) in AS cases (P &lt; .001). Univariate analysis comparing strain susceptibility patterns with clinical and laboratory findings at presentation and clinical outcome was initially undertaken, with further analysis to assess for age and delayed treatment as potential confounding factors. Compared to MDR cases, patients with AS strains presented more commonly with continuous fevers and constipation (P &lt; .05). MDR cases more commonly presented with hepatomegaly (P &lt; .05) and a non- statistically significant trend toward more neurologic involvement and pneumonias. Admission laboratory values were similar between groups except for increased frequencies of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;75 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase &gt;200 IU/L (P &lt; .001) in the MDR cases. The # days to defervescence, resolution of hepatomegaly, and clinical cure did not differ between groups. Patients with MDR strains may present differently than AS strains, possibly related to therapeutic delay. However, in this patient population, MDR TF cases do not appear to have a worse prognosis once appropriate antibiotic therapy is initiated. 153 Isoniazid Hepatotoxicity and Unrecognized Hepatitis C Infection. R.J. BLINKHORN, JR.* MetroHealth Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. The role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a cofactor for the occurrence of INH hepatotoxicity (INH-Hep) has not been previously explored. Methods: Individuals attending the Cuyahoga County Tuberculosis Clinic, 1993-94, for INH prophylaxis who developed INH-Hep (transaminases exceeding 2? times normal levels) had an HCV antibody (Ab) obtained (Abbott HCV EIA 2.0). Results: 1993 = 1,022 INH recipients: 38 cases of INH-Hep (3.7%, 95% CI = 2.6-5.1). HCV Ab was negative in 3 (8%), positive in 7 (18%), and not done in 28 (74%). 1994 = 1,124 INH recipients: 35 cases of INH-Hep (3.1%, 95% CI = 2.1-4.4). HCV Ab was negative in 16 (46%), positive in 7 (20%), and not done in 12 (34%). Total: 14 of 73 (19%) patients with INH-Hep were HCV Ab-positive, but when an HCV Ab was actually obtained, 14 of 33 (42%, 95% CI = 25.5-60.8) were positive. For HCV-negative patients, average age was 51.4 years, 47% were females, and 47% were white. In the HCV-positive group, patients tended to be younger (mean = 43.4 y), male (86%), and African- American (64%). Time to normalization of the LFTs after cessation of INH varied by HCV Ab status. In the HCV-negative group, 14 of 18 (78%) normalized by 4 weeks (mean = 3.9 weeks). In the HCV-positive group, only 1 of 11 (9%) normalized by 4 weeks (mean = 7.6 weeks, p &lt; .005). Conclusions: Whether HCV potentiates the accumulation of toxic INH metabolites or INH leads to activation of HCV with a protracted recovery remains to be elucidated. 154 Penicillin Serum Levels in Army Basic Trainees after Receiving ilntramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G. JW BASS,* RG JONES, JN LONGFIELD, RM. HARTMANN. Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI. Of 125 soldiers undergoing basic training who received 1.2 millions units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G prophylaxis for prevention of streptococcal infection 86 had serum samples obtained at 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the injection. The samples were frozen at-80? C and assayed simultaneously for penicillin using a highly standardized Micrococcus luteus bioassay with sensitivity of &gt;0.005 pg/mL. All 86 samples obtained after one day had significant serum levels of penicillin, mean 0.072 pg/mL SD ? 0.108. Only 34/84 (39%) had detectable penicillin in samples obtained after seven days, mean 0.010 tig/mL SD ? 0.01 and only 3/86 (3%) had detectable penicillin in samples obtained after 14 days, mean 0.016 pg/mL. Penicillin was not detected in any of the 86 samples obtained 21 and 28 days after the injection. The trainees were all male, mean age was 21 years SD ? 3, mean height was 177 cm SD ? 8.3 and the mean weight was 76 kg SD ?10.8. Penicillin was detected in all 86 trainees one day after the injection at levels that might be anticipated from prior studies. The finding that only 3% of 14 day samples and none of 21 and 28 day samples had detectable levels of penicillin is unexpected but may be due to the size and activity of the trainees. These findings, if confirmed, may provide a basis for guidance in formulating future strategies for use of this important agent in the control of streptococcal infection and rheumatic fever in both military and civilian populations. 155 Emergence of Penicillin Resistant Strep. pneumoniae Infections Among HIV-1 Infected Children. V PAPAEVANGELOU*, D DESIDERIO, A KAUL, C WORRELL, K KRASINSKI, W BORKOWSKY. NYU Medical Center/Bellevue Hospital, NY, NY. A retrospective study of all cases of bacteremia and meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae during the last 20 months among children &lt;18 years old was undertaken in order to evaluate the emergence of penicillin resistant pneumococcal (PRP) infections in both HIV-1 negative and HIV-1 infected children as well as to identify risk factors associated with resistance. The incidence of systemic pneumococcal disease (SPD) in children increased from 9.8 episodes/year between 1978-1993 to 19.2 episodes/year during the study period, which was partially due to the increased number of HIV-1 infected children accounting for 21% and 40.5% of the recorded episodes respectively. During the study period there were 15 episodes of SPD in 10 HIV-1 infected children and 18 episodes in 18 HIV negative children. Six of the 10 HIV-1 infected children had documented recurrent SPD. Four isolates (12.12%) were PRP by the E-test: 3 were relatively resistant (RR: MIC 0.1-1.Omcg/ml) and one highly resistant (R: MIC &gt;l.Omcg/ml). There was increased incidence of PRP among HIV-1 infected children when compared to HIV-1 negative children (20% vs 5.5%), as it has been described in adults. Three isolates (2RR, 1R) were recovered from two HIV-1 infected children with recurrent SPD who were on penicillin prophylaxis. The emergence of penicillin resistant pneumococcal infections in HIV-1 infected children requires reevaluation of the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against bacterial infections especially in those children with history of recurrent infections.</page><page sequence="28">746 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 156 Drug-Induced Lupus Syndrome Associated with Rifamycin Therapy. S.E. BERNING*, J.L. COOK and M.D. ISEMAN. National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO. Drug-induced lupus syndrome has been associated with isoniazid (INH), but there has been no clear association with rifamycin therapy. We report five cases of drug-induced lupus syndrome where the suspected etiologic agents were rifampin (RIF) in 2 patients and rifabutin (RFB) in 3 patients. Four patients had M. avium complex (MAC) and one had M. chelatum disease. Four patients were female. The mean age was 61.6 years. Past rheumatologic histories included one patient with drug-induced lupus syndrome from both INH and thiacetazone and another with spontaneous Raynaud's syndrome. The reactions occurred between 5-7 months of therapy in three patients, and at 96 and 157 months in the others. Manifestations consisted of malaise, arthralgias/arthritis and edema of hands, elbows and knees. No rash, vasculitis, nephritis or cerebritis was observed. Serological studies revealed that 4/4 patients had positive ANA titers &gt;1:320 (homogeneous pattern) when tested during the acute phases of their reactions. Anti-histone antibodies were not measured until two months after discontinuation of therapy and were negative in 3/3 patients. Upon discontinuation of rifamycin therapy (and despite continuation of all other medications), symptoms improved in 2/2 RIF patients and 3/3 RFB patients, with the time to relief ranging from one to 10 weeks. There was a significant reduction in ANA titer in the one patient tested following discontinuation of rifamycin therapy. We conclude that drug-induced lupus reactions may be sequelae of treatment with rifamycins under selected clinical circumstances. Since this association has not been defined previously in large numbers of patients treated with rifamycins, we speculate that the pathogenesis of this syndrome may involve altered degradation of rifamycins caused by simultaneous administration of ciprofloxacin or clarithromycin antibiotics. 157 Clinical and Microbiologic Experience in the Treatment of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcusfaecium Infections with Synercid' (Quinupristin/Dalfopristin). M.E. RUPP* The University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) has emerged to become a major pathogen. Therapeutic options are limited and no drug or drug combination has been demonstrated to be reliably effective. This report details the use of Synercidd (Q/D) in the treatment of 7 patients with VREF infection. Age Sex Predisposing Site Bacteriologic Clinical Condition Response Outcome 3 F Liver Tx Bacteremia, Indeterminate Died (multiple) Abd Abscess 41 F Liver Tx Bacteremia, Relapsed Died peritonitis 39 F BMT Bacteremia PI-E/CRC* Survived 22 M Liver Tx Biliary PI-E/CRC Survived 73 F AML Bacteremia Indeterminate Died 48 M BMT Skin PI-E/CRC Survived 70 F Hemodial. UTI PI-E/CRC Survived PI-E/CC = Primary Infection Eradicated, Continued Rectal Colonization VREF isolates were Van A phenotype. Length of therapy with Q/D ranged from 5 - 21 d. The Q/D MIC/MBC before therapy ranged from 0.5-1.0 #g/m/&gt; 125 pg/ml; following therapy they were 0.5-4.0 pg/ml/&gt; 125 pg/ml. Serum inhibitory/cidal assay ranged from 1:2-1:8 / &lt;1:2. Although exerting a bacteriostatic effect, Q/D appears to be a useful agent in the treatment of VREF infection. 158 In Vitro Release of Ciprofloxacin(C) and Pefloxacin(P) from D,L-Lactic Acid Polymer (DLLP) of Low(LMW) and High(HMW) Molecular Weight K.KANELLAKOPOULOU*,H.GIAMARELLOU,A.ANASTASIADES, TH.KORAKIS,A.ANDREOPOULOS,Z.CHRYSSOULI and E.DOUNIS Laiko General Hospital,Athens,Greece. Aim of this study was the development of a new biodegradable delivery system for sustained quino- lones'release that could be applied for local treatment and prophylaxis of bone infection.There- fore the in vitro release of C and P each one in- corporated in two different MW DLLP at 10% per weight (900mg DLLP + 100mg C or P) was studied.Fi- ve pellets of each mixture were preserved in ste- rile tubes with one ml of broth,at 37?C.Every 24h they were sampled and replaced by standard broth volumes.C and P levels were measured by an agar well diffusion method.Results (x:g/ml) were as follows: Day 1 5 10 16 30 50 100 150180 LMW 15 48 85 1344 72 0 0 0 0 HMW 1616 198 168 139 85 75 68 68 49 Q LMW 31 136 522 1064 127 24 0 0 HMW 2168 1205 774 531 397 315 262 191 191 C and P release from LMW-DLLP lasted for 150 days with peaks on the 16th day,while C and P release from HMW-DLLP lasted for &gt;6 months with peaks on the 1st day and a quite constant high release ra- te thereafter.In conclusion DLLP is a suitable car- rier of both C and P that does not require like cement postoperative surgical removal.According to the required duration of release,different MW DLLP can be used experimentally both in the treat- ment and prophylaxis of bone infection. 159 What is the Risk of Achilles Tendon Rupture with Ciprofloxacin? S. A. TASKER*, Y.T. SHINOHARA, M. WALLACE, K.E.COUCH, P.E. OLSON, US Naval Medical Center, San Diego CA Recent reports have noted tendinopathy, particularly Achilles tendon rupture, in patients treated with fluoroquinolones. The majority of the reports involve pefloxacin, but ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin have also been mentioned. Naval Medical Center San Diego is a tertiary care facility serving approximately 450,000 beneficiaries. The hospital pharmacy dispenses 3000-4000 prescriptions each day. The formulary is restricted, with ciprofloxacin being the main quinolone available and its use requiring approval by infectious disease or urology staff. We reviewed all prescriptions for ciprofloxacin dispensed in 1994 and compared them to the ICD9 codes for admission for Achilles tendon rupture. 2122 patients received ciprofloxacin during this period. Among 24 admissions for Achilles tendon rupture none had received ciprofloxacin. For this patient population, estimated relative risk for developing Achilles tendon rupture following ciprofloxacin use was zero (p=0.28, 95% C.I. 0.00,40.37). Although this result does not achieve statistical significance it may have clinical significance and provide reassurance to patients and providers using ciprofloxacin. Previous case reports suggesting an apparent association have included patients who have other risk factors for tendinopathy. Without denominator data these reports lack statistcal validity. Frther studies utilizing a prospective design are needed to permit direct calculation of the relative risk of Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. 160 Isoniazid (INH) Hepatotoxicity in Renal Transplant Recipients SJ Antony*, C Ynares, JS Dummer Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN. Few data are available about the risk of INH prophylaxis (PROPH) in transplant recipients and many transplant centers do not use INH PROPH routinely. We reviewed the records of 84 renal transplant recipients (56 men, 28 women; mean age 38.8 + 11.7 years) who received INH PROPH between 1983 and 1993 for the incidence of hepatotoxicity. Six patients had chronic hepatitis C infection and 3 had chronic hepatitis B. Reasons for PROPH included positive PPD (16), tuberculosis (TB) contact (8), old granulomatous disease on CXR In 20 patients the reason for prophylaxis was unclear. Only one patient had an abnormal SGOT when INH was started. The median duration of INH therapy was 348 days (range 20- 954 days). The mean SGOT at start of therapy was 24.1 + 10.8 I.U. and was 22.6 + 6.2 I.U when INH was stopped (P&gt; 0.2). Peak SGOT during therapy was 36.7 + 15.5 I.U (P&lt;0.001 compared to start SGOT). In followup, 31% of patients had an abnormal SGOT (&gt; 40 I.U); however, the highest SGOT was 88 I.U. No patient had clinical hepatotoxicity (95% confidence intervals 0- 4.3%). We conclude that INH PROPH is safe in renal transplant recipients, provided their baseline liver function tests are normal, and should be administered to patients at risk for reactivation of tuberculosis. 161 Emergence of Macrolide-Streptogramin Resistance During Therapy of Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia With Quinupristin/Dalfopristin (RP59500). J.R. KOSTMAN', T. FEKETE, J. WOODWELL, R. LORENICK, J.L. SILBER. Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pa., RWJ Medical School, Cooper Hosp/University Medical Center, Camden, N.J. We studied the development of clinically significant resistance to quinupristin/ dalfopristin (RP59500) in an isolate of Staphylococcus aureus. A 22 year old woman was admitted for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and had plasmapheresis performed through a central venous catheter. Persistent S. aureus bacteremia developed 48 hours later. She was enrolled in a Phase II study of quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours), the central access was removed within 48 hours, she became afebrile and she had negative blood cultures within 72 hours of beginning therapy. Seven days into therapy, she manifested recurrent fever, a new systolic murmur, and arthritis in the right knee. S. aureus grew from the blood, and an echocardiogram showed new mitral and tricuspid valve vegetations. Nafcillin therapy was instituted and the patient became afebrile in 10 days. Susceptibility testing of the two isolates with a rapid, automated broth micro- dilution method (AutoMicrobic System,Vitek) demonstrated that the initial isolate was susceptible to erythomycin and that the second was resistant to erythromycin. Other drugs tested on the panel had unchanged results. Following NCCLS guidelines, we performed broth macrodilution MICs for erythromycin, clindamycin, and quinu- pristin/dalfopristin. The MICs for eythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin were both 0.5 pg/mL for the initial isolate and 4 and 16 ug/mL, respectively, for the second isolate. Clindamycin MIC was 0.125 ug/mL for both isolates. Analysis ofgenomic DNA by pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that the two isolates had identical restriction digestion patterns. Plasmid analysis revealed the presence of a large 32 kb plasmid. Disk diffusion experiments with erythromycin, pristinamycin, and clindamycin confirmed the resistance to erythromycin and pristinamycin but not to clindamycin in the second isolate, but there was no flattening of zone suggesting inducibile resistance for either isolate. However, growth of the initial isolate in broth containing variable concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 ug/mL) of quinupristin/dalfopristin selected organisms that demonstrated increased MICs to both erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin but not clindamycin. We conclude that clinically significant macrolide-streptogramin resistance can develop in S. aureus after exposure to quinupristin/dalfopristin. The resistance mechanism is being investigated.</page><page sequence="29">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 747 162 Gram Positive Bacteremia (GPB) in Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Recipients: Impact of 3 Prophylactic Antimicrobial Regimens. C.A. DA CUNHA*, D. WEISDORF, X.O. SHU, J.D. PASTOR III, J.R. JOHNSON. University of Minnesota (UM), Minneapolis, MN. Vancomycin (VN) prophylaxis (Px) for GPB was used routinely (from day -1) for BMT recipients at the UM from the mid-1980's until 2/94, when VN restrictions to control an outbreak of VN-resistant enterococci were instituted. From 3/94 through 6/94 no GPB Px was used. In 6/94, a fatal case of viridans streptococcal septic shock in a BMT recipient prompted reinstitution of GPB Px, only now with penicillin G or cefazolin (P/C). We compared these 3 periods of GPB Px: 1) 8/93-1/94, VN; 2) 3/94- 6/94, no Px; 3) 7/94-12/94, P/C. Results: The study periods were comparable with respect to the distribution of age, gender, time to engraftment and underlying disease. The outcomes were as follows (see key below): A B C D E VN (N=106) 10 3.8 22 100 80 No Px (N= 72) 36 13.4 7 96 85 P/C (N=104) 26 10.2 11 100 83 Key: A=Pts. with GPB/total (%); B=Infection Rate (GPB/1000 Pt.-days); C=Median time (days) to 1st GPB; D=% Survival by day 7 after GPB; E= % Survival by day 100 after BMT (all pts.). Conclusions: 1. VN Px (P &lt; 0.001) but not P/C Px (P = 0.30) significantly reduced the rate of GPB in the early post-BMT period, compared with no Px. 2. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy successfully managed nearly all GPB episodes, resulting in similar survival at day 7 after GPB and at day 100 after BMT, regardless of the Px regimen used. 163 Emergence of Penicillin- and Cephalosporin-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) in Buffalo, NY, and its suburbs. Sayahtaheri Altaie, S., Tristram, D.*, Meyer, P., Cui, Z. SUNY at Buffalo and The Children's Hospital of Buffalo, NY. To determine whether the prevalence of penicillin (PEN)and cephalosporin (CEP)-resistance had increased among SPN isolates from children, we tested the susceptibility of unduplicated strains collected during 1993, 1994, and first quarter of 1995 at The Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Using the 1 pg oxacillin (OX) disk the isolates were screened for PEN resistance. MICs were determined using the E test for isolates from blood, CSF, and any PEN resistant (R) (by OX disk) isolates. The results are tabulated below: MIC RESULTS IN % NO. OF YEAR ISOLATES SUSCEPT. INTERNED. RESISTANT PEN CEP PEN CEP PEN CEP 1993 155 94.8 0 5.2 0 0 0 1994 155 90.3 98.1 7.7 1.3 1.9 0.65 1995 56 82.1 89.3 8.9 8.9 8.9 1.8 Only 18.2% of the PEN R isolates were from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The remaining 81.2% were isolated from eye and respiratory tract. Of the PEN R isolates 27.3% were also R to CEP. One of dual R strains was from CSF. All the isolates from this study were susceptible to vancomycin (VAN). Twenty of the PEN R strains were typed: type 19 (25%), 6(25%), 9(10%), 23 (10%),and others (30%). These data indicate that PEN and CEP R SPN are increasing among children. Therefore, antimicrobial regimens for treatment of life-threatening SPN infections should initially include vancomycin until the results of susceptibility testing are available. 164 Bactericidal Activity of Sparfloxacin (SP) Against Penicillin Susceptible and Multire- sistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in the Rabbit Model of Ex- perimental Meningitis. A. TARASI, and A. TOMASZ*. The Rockefeller University, New York, NY. Penicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci (Pn) continue to present serious challenges to the chemo- therapy of pneumococcal meningitis, a disease the chemother- apy of which requires antibacterial agents with bactericidal activity. SP is a fluoroquinolone with powerful in vitro cidal activity against PN. On the other hand, penetration of SP into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space is not opti- mal. We tested SP at various concentrations delivered in single i.v. bolus doses to experimental animals at different times of inflammation induced, first, by a penicillin suscep- tible capsular type 3 Pn. Experimental animals (n=24) were inoculated intracisternally with 105 to 106 viable colony forming units (cfu). SP (5 mg/ml solution) was delivered at 1 ml/min at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, 4h after inoculation of bacteria and prior to the onset of inflammation. Bactericidal activity was measured as cfu/ml 2, 4 and 6h after introduction of Drug. SP at 2.5 and 5 mg/ kg was ineffective; 10 mg/kg showed bacteriostatic effect; 20 mg/kg caused 1 log killing in 6h while 40 mg/kg showed powerful cidal activity (3-4 log kill) in 6h. No further decline in cfu per ml was seen between the sixth and eighth hours. Powerful cidal activity (2-3 log kill in 4h) was al- so demonstrated by 20 mg/kg SP given at the time of onset of inflammation. In a second test, SP at 40 mg/kg was found to be cidal (2-3 log kill in 4h) against the genetically-char- acterized multiresistant Spanish/Icelandic clone of Pn (re- sistant to pen, ery, tet, chlor, and STX) with demonstrated capacity of extensive geographic spread (Soares et al. 1993. Evidence for the introduction of a multiresistant clone of serotype 6B Streptococcus pneumoniae from Spain to Iceland in the late 1980s. J. Infect. Dis. 168:158-163). 165 A Prospective Evaluation of Twice Weekly Antituberculosis Therapy in Patients with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection. N. SALOMON*, DC. PERLMAN, D. ALTARAC, MV. WALDRON . Beth Israel Medical Center, NY, NY. Objective: Report early outcomes among HIV + patients (pts) with drug-susceptible (DS) pulmonary TB (PTB) treated with largely intermittent twice weekly directly observed therapy (DOT). Methods: Pts were actively recruited using daily review of all new smear or culture positive (+) TB isolates since 09/01/93. Susceptibility by Bactec and solid media at NYCDOH. DOT and follow-up was conducted in our AIDS or methadone maintenance clinics. Therapy (Rx) consisted of isoniazid (I), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months (mos), followed by I+R, for 7 mos in HIV+ pts and for 4 mos in HIV- pts. All doses were observed. Pts were considered adherent to Rx if they had received 2 80% of required doses. Results: To date, 45 pts with DS-TB, 23 HIV+ and 22 HIV-, had received twice weekly Rx for periods ranging from 1.06 to 8.86 mos (median, 5.13 mos) following either initial daily Rx (in 42) or thrice weekly Rx (in 3). 31 (68%) had (+) baseline sputum (sp) smears and 10 (22%)had both PTB and extra-PTB. 78% of HIV+ pts had CD4+ counts &lt; 200/mm3. There were no significant differences in disease characteristics between HIV+ and HIV- pts, but cavitary disease was more frequent in HIV- pts (31 % vs. 8%, p = 0.07). The median time from the beginning of initial Rx to the onset of twice weekly Rx was 0.73 mos in HIV + and 0.56 mos in HIV- pts. The proportion of adherent pts in each group was 87%. All HIV+ and 19 HIV- pts had (+) baseline sp cultures. Cultures reverted to (-) in all. Median time from the onset of Rx to the first (-) sp culture was 0.83 mos in HIV+ and 1.66 mos in HIV- pts (p &gt; 0.6). There were no recurrent (+) sp cultures during twice weekly Rx after 188 patient-mos of bacteriologic follow-up. However, 1 HIV+ pt who was lost to follow-up after receiving only 55 % of required doses during a 6-month period, had recurrent DS-PTB two months after he stopped taking Rx. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) prompted temporary or permanent withdrawal of anti-TB agents in 21% of HIV+ and 9% of HIV- pts (p = 0.10). 72% of ADRs occurred before the onset of twice weekly Rx. At 6 mos, the probabilities of survival were 85% in HIV+ and 100% in HIV- pts (p = 0.40). No deaths were due to TB. Conclusions: Among HIV-infected patients with drug-sensitive TB, intermittent twice weekly observed therapy resulted in culture conversion in all patients, was well tolerated, and high rates of adherence can be achieved. 166 A prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative study of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and cefuroxime axetil (CEF) for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). S. CHODOSH*, R. ECHOLS, S. KOWALSKY, B. PAINTER, E. VALALIK. VA Outpatient Clinic, Boston, MA; Bayer Corp, Pharmaceutical Division, West Haven, CT. CIP 500 mg BID was compared to CEF 500 mg BID (both X 14 days) in the treatment of aduls with AECB. Because recent evidence suggests that B- lactam antibiotics have a limited ability to eradicate H. influenzae (HI) from the respiratory tract, patients were followed until their first exacerbation or for 9 months. Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of HI was done to evaluate organism persistence or reinfection with each regimen. All patients were evaluated at the end of therapy (EOT) for clinical response. Three hundred seven patients were enrolled with 271 (88%) valid for efficacy. Significantly more patients in the CIP group were in 'Fair' to 'Poor' health at study entry (p=0.012), however, the # of AECB in the 12 months prior to enrollment (median=1) was not different. The 3 most frequently cultured causative organisms were (CIP vs CEF): M catarrhalis [MC] (n=32 vs 32), HI (n=32 vs 22) and S. pneumoniae [SP] (n=12 vs 16). For these organisms, the eradication rate for CIP vs CEF was: 100% vs 76%, 100% vs 83% and 90% vs 100%, respectively. For all organisms, eradication at EOT was observed in 89/93 (96%) and 80/97 (82%) of the CIP and CEF patients, respectively (p&lt;0.0001; CI,s= 0.046, 0.215). Clinical resolution at EOT was reported in 90% CIP patients and 89% CEF patients (Cl,= -0.047, 0.089). For patients eligible for survival analysis (n.234), 64 (55%) CIP patients relapsed and 55 (47%) CEF patients relapsed. The median infection-free interval for CIP and CEF was 147 and 183 days, respectively (p=0.216 ). Severity of health at study entry was not associated with failure time. Six pairs (pre-therapy + relapse isolate) of HI were analyzed by REA. In all 4 CIP cases the follow-up organism was different from the pre-therapy isolate indicating reinfection not relapse. In the 2 CEF cases the follow-up organism was identical to the pre-therapy organism, supporting our hypothesis regarding drug specific differences in the eradication of HI. While CIP demonstrated a significantly better eradication rate at EOT than CEF, this did not translate into a longer infection-free interval, suggesting causes other than bacterial pathogens are responsible for initiating AECB. 167 Multiple Drug Resistant Enterococcus May Be Inhibited By Novobiocin and Tetracycline. T. ADEYANJU,* J.PRAKASH, J. R. LENTINO. Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois. Enterococci have intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics, and emer- gence of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) has made worse the thera- peutic dilemma. We performed in vitro susceptiblity testing to determine MIC/MBC by macrobroth technique for 16 clinical isolates of VRE. Eleven isolates from sterile sites (blood, peritoneal fluid, urine) were speciated: eight E. faeciun, twoE. faecalis, one E. durans; five from non sterile sites (decubitii, abscess,sputum) were unspeciated. All of the isolates were 8-lacta- mase negative. MIC 50/90 and MBC 50/90 of ten antibiotics for the 16 isolates are shown in the table. tgml ANTIBIOTIC MIC 50 MBC 50 MIC 90 MBC 90 Ampicillin 256 &gt;512 &gt;512 &gt;512 Ceftriaxone &gt;512 &gt;512 &gt;512 &gt;512 Chloramphenicol 512 &gt;512 &gt;512 &gt;512 Gentamicin &gt;1000 &gt;1000 &gt;1000 &gt;1000 Imipenem 128 512 256 &gt;512 Levofloxacin 32 512 64 &gt;512 Novobiocin &lt;1 512 64 &gt;512 Rifampin 32 &gt;512 256 &gt;512 Tetracycline &lt;1 128 128 &gt;512 Vancomycin 256 &gt;512 512 &gt;512 The MIC of novobiocin was s 1 pg/ml for nine of 16 isolates, however the MBC was 64 g/ml. The MIC to tetracycline was &lt;4 g/ml for ten of 16 isolates, with a corresponding MBC &gt;.64. All but one isolate were resistant to imipenem and ampicilin. There may be a role for use of novobiocin and tetracycline, after further studies, as therapeutic options in management of patients infected with multiple drug-resistant enterococcus.</page><page sequence="30">748 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 168 Evaluation of NCCLS and Published Interpretive Criteria For Fluoroquinolone (FQ) Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Tests as a Guide to Therapy with Marketed and Investigational Compounds L.D. SUTTON*, M.G. CORMICAN, D.M. JOHNSON, R.N. JONES, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, USA Generally, the initial FQ susceptibility testing interpretive criteria have been determined with collections of organisms that were largely susceptible to these antimicrobials. Because of the increasing emergence of FQ resistance, a predictor panel of 300 organisms (200 resistant to ciprofloxacin from 8 nations) was used to re-evaluate existing disk diffusion test criteria (NCCLS tables or peer-reviewed publications) with the following FQs: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, clinafloxacin (CI-960, AM- 1091, PD127371), sparfloxacin (AT-4140), and fleroxacin (RO 23-6240, AM-833). MICs and zone diameters in mm were correlated by linear least-squares regression and error-rate bounding methods. Based upon these studies, the proposed criteria modifications were proposed: Ofloxacin ( 5 !Lg disk content), no changes; Ciprofloxacin (5 .g), R (&gt; 4 gg/ml) &lt; 17 mm; Levofloxacin (5 Ig), S (&lt; 2 gug/ml) &gt; 17 mm, R (&gt; 8 tjg/ml) &lt; 13 mm; Sparfloxacin (5 lg), S (&lt; 1 I.g/ml) &gt; 20 mm, R (&gt; 4 itg/ml) &lt; 16 mm; Lomefloxacin (10 ig), S (&lt; 2 jg/ml) &gt; 20 mm, R (&gt; 8 ig/ml) &lt; 16 mm; Norfloxacin (10 jg), no changes; Clinafloxacin (5 jig), S (&lt; 1 .g/ml) &gt; 21 mm, R (&gt; 4 ig/ml) &lt; 17 mm; Fleroxacin (5 jg), S (&lt; 2 u.g/ml) &gt; 19 mm, R (&gt; 8 pg/ml) &lt; 15 mm. These criteria increased the absolute agreement (91.3 - 95.2%) between tests in all cases compared to breakpoints, result in rare (&lt;0.7%) very major error (false-susceptible) and minimized major error (false-resistant). Use of these modified criteria should produce safer and more accurate interpretations of FQ disk test results as more FQ resistance emerges among clinically important pathogens. 169 Accurate Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Methods (Vitek, Etest, Reference MICs) for Enterococci: Vancomycin-Resistance Amongst Clinical Isolates of Enterococcus Species is an Increasing Clinical Problem M.G. Cormican, D.J. Biedenbach*, R.N. Jones, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, USA Antimicrobial resistance amongst clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. is an increasing clinical problem. Previous studies (Jones et al., 1995) have highlighted the limitations of initial disk diffusion interpretive criteria for vancomycin (VANC) and of the Vitek System for VANC and aminoglycoside testing. These reports have resulted in the development of modified interpretive criteria and software, respectively. We compared Etest, NCCLS disk diffusion susceptibility testing, Vitek (software version 8.3) and NCCLS reference broth microdilution for susceptibility testing of VANC against 149 strains of VANC-resistant Enterococcus spp. Teicoplanin susceptibility testing by Etest and broth microdilution were compared, as were Etest and Vitek for gentamicin, streptomycin, and ampicillin. For all five antimicrobial agents tested, Etest and Vitek had excellent absolute categorical agreement (&gt; 96%). Absolute categorical agreement of Etest (95.3%), Vitek (96.6%), and disk diffusion testing (96%) with the reference broth microdilution method was also very acceptable and all interpretive errors were minor (false-intermediate). For teicoplanin an absolute categorical agreement between Etest and broth microdilution was 94%. All of the contemporary methods studied are now acceptable for detection of clinically important antimicrobial resistances (glycopeptides, penicillins, aminoglycosides) amongst enterococci. 170 Multi-Laboratory Protocols to Validate Antimicrobial Package Insert Spectrums: Lomefloxacin and Metronidazole Studies Successfully Used as Models. M.E. ERWIN*, R.N. JONES, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA The FDA has requested that (1993) sponsors of New Drug Applications annually validate the in vitro spectrum data listed in the product package insert (PPI). This information must be derived from geographically diverse sites, have 25 to 100 recent clinical isolates/species, and use two acceptable susceptibility testing methods. Species with &gt;90% susc. strains at &lt; to the breakpoint MIC would remain in the PPI. To comply with FDA recommendations, model study designs were applied to lomefloxacin (LOM) and metronidazole (MET). In 1994 and 1995 medical centers (9 or 10) nation-wide studied LOM, each submitting 10% of the isolates by species. NCCLS MIC and disk zone diameter results were compiled for LOM and nine reference drugs. For 1994 (1934 strains) LOM was active against all PPI-listed species except P. aeruginosa, C. freundi and P. rettgeri (42-87% susc.). Four of five additional non-PPI species (435 strains), were candidates for inclusion (hL gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, S. anteritidis, Shiaella spp.). A serious interpretive discrepancy was noted for S. saorophvticus (93% susceptible by MIC vs. 69% by the disk test). Modified criteria for the LOM disk test of &gt;20 mm improved results to 95.9%. The 1995 LOM study results were similar but four other species. (81.8-89.6% susc.) had less than 90% activity and one previously LOM resistant species was now susc. Other FQs had comparably reduced potency against these same species. MIC and disk overall interpretive agreement (1995 data; 1,555 strains) was high (87.4 vs 87.3%, respectively) using the proposed zone criteria change. In a similar study (7 centers) for MET, the overall resistance rate among anaerobes was only 1.7% and 2.2% for the agar dilution and Etest methods, respectively. This was significantly superior to clindamycin. These model studies confirm the continued in vitro potency and spectrums of LOM and MET versus PPI-listed pathogens. 171 EVALUATION OF THE SELECTION OF RIFAMPIN- RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCAL MICROFLORA FOLLOWING RIFABUTIN ADMINISTRATION. Candice A. Shepherd, J. Gregory Gillum, and Gordon L. Archer. Medical College of Virginia Hospitals, Richmond, VA. Background: Between 7-27% of persons with AIDS develop bacteremia, with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) isolated in almost half. Rifampin is used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of staphylococcal bacteremia, and rifampin resistance in staphylococci isolated from the skin has been described following rifampin administration. Rifabutin, which shares a similar chemical structure with rifampin, is approved for the prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex in patients with AIDS, and may lead to similar resistance patterns in SA. Purpose: Evaluate if rifabutin prophylaxis selects for rifampin-resistant staphylococci in persons with AIDS. Methods: HIV positive subjects, eighteen years or older, with normal renal and hepatic function, and less than 100 CD4 T-helper cells/mm3 were recruited. Subjects were excluded if there was previous history of rifampin or rifabutin use, malabsorption syndrome, or use of antibiotics active against SA within five weeks of enrollment. Subjects in whom baseline cultures revealed rifampin- resistant staphylococci were also excluded. Cultures for SA were obtained from three sites [nares, axillae, and perianal area] at the following days from the start of rifabutin prophylaxis: 0 (baseline), day 7, day 14, day 21, and at each subsequent clinic visit. Culture swabs were rolled onto Staphylococcus agar or Staphylococcus agar impregnated with 5 :g/mL of rifampin and incubated for 24 hours. Six patients who met inclusion criteria who were not started on rifabutin served as the control group. Results: Rifampin-Resistant SA Site Baseline Visitl Visit2 Visit3 Visit4 Visit5 Nares 0/6 2/4 1/2 1/1 1/1 1/1 Axillae 0/6 1/4 1/2 0/1 1/1 0/1 Perianal 0/6 4/4 2/2 1/1 1/1 1/1 No cultures in the control group grew rifampin-resistant SA. Conclusion: Rifabutin prophylaxis selects for rifampin-resistant SA, which has important clinical implications for AIDS patients receiving MAC prophylaxis who develop SA bacteremia. 172 Abstract Deleted in Proof 173 The Postantibiotic Effect of Levofloxacin on Bacteroides species. S.L. PENDLAND' and L.H. DANZIGER. The University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL. Levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone which has been shown to have in vitro activity against various anaerobic organisms. This study was conducted to determine if levofloxacin exhibits a postantibiotic effect on Bacteroides species. Three clinical isolates of Bacteroides were tested: B fragilis 2910 (MIC 0.5), B fragilis 6547 (MIC 1), B thetaiotaomicron E1 5 (MIC 4). Log phase growth of cultures of approximately 106 cfu/ml were exposed to three concentrations of levofloxacin (4, 6, &amp; 8 ug/ml) for 2 hours on a shaking platform in a 35?C anaerobic incubator. A control tube containing no antibiotic was included in each experiment. At the end of a 2 hour exposure period, the antimicrobial agent was removed by repeated washing (3x). The tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes and the supernatant removed. After the third wash the tubes were resuspended with drug-free broth. Viable counts (cfu/ml) were performed at this time. The tubes were placed back on a shaking platform at 35?C and viable counts were performed hourly thereafter until the broth became cloudy. All procedures were performed in duplicate in an anaerobic environment using pre-reduced Wilkins-Chalgren broth. PAE was defined as the time difference for the exposed cultures and control culture to increase 1 log,0 after removal of drug (PAE = T-C). The PAE for the Bacteroides isolates following a 2 hour exposure to levofloxacin were as follows: STRAIN 4 uQ/m l 6 ua/ml 8 uQ/ml B fragilis (MIC 0.5) 2 hr 2 hr 2 hr B fragilis (MIC 1 ) 1 hr 2 hr 2 hr B thetaiotaomicron (MIC 4) 0 hr 0 hr 0 hr These results suggest that levofloxacin may possess a postantibiotic effect against some Bacteroides species. Further studies are needed to determine the importance of strain, MIC, and antibiotic concentration of levofloxacin on PAE against anaerobes.</page><page sequence="31">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 749 174 Once-daily Aminoglycoside Use in Patients with Gram-positive Endocarditis. A.M. ALKHAL*, H.M. CROWE, D. NICOLAU, C. NIGHTINGALE, R. QUINTILIANI. Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT. Aminoglycosides are often used initially in the therapy of gram- positive endocarditis, either empirically or in an attempt to speed sterilization. In 1993, our hospital changed from traditional thrice- daily aminoglycoside dosing to once-daily dosing, using 7mg/kg IV. To determine whether the frequency of aminoglycoside dosing impacted patient outcome, we retrospectively examined the charts of 18 patients with 21 episodes of gram-positive endocarditis. Of the 21 episodes of endocarditis, 17 were due to S. aureus and 4 to viridans streptococci. Patients received a mean dose of 462 mg per day for a mean of 6.3 days. In patients who had follow up blood cultures, sterilization was achieved in a mean of 3.5 days. A variety of beta-lactam antibiotics or vancomycin were continued for an average of 24 days. Eight of the patients were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Six of the patients experienced a rise in creatinine of &gt; 0.Smg/dl over baseline; however in 5 of the 6, there were other potential causes for renal impairment (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents {2}, amphotericin B {1}, HIV nephropathy {1}, hypotension {1}). In all patients, the rise in creatinine was transient, with a return to baseline values prior to discharge. We conclude that the use of once-daily aminoglycoside dosing in combination with either a beta-lactam or vancomycin results in an appropriate resolution of the gram-positive endocarditis. 175 Effect of Pharmacy Intervention on Antibiotic Utilization in Patients with Bacteremia. E. LEE*, J. SEGRETI, and R. CONNELLY. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL. Inappropriate antibiotic use remains a serious problem in hospitalized patients leading to higher patient care costs and emergence of antibiotic resistance. In order to see how often physicians adjust antibiotics based on positive blood culture results and to see if pharmacy intervention could improve antibiotic utilization in such patients, we prospectively evaluated 80 patients with 88 episodes of bacteremia over a three month period. Physicians adjusted antibiotics in 36 episodes of bacteremia. Adjustments were appropriate in 25 cases, but inappropriate in the remaining 11 cases. In the 52 remaining cases of bacteremia, no antibiotic adjustments were made. Adjustments should have been made in 22 of these 52 cases. Overall, pharmacy could have intervened in 33 of 88 cases (37%). In 23 cases, less expensive or more specific antibiotics could have been chosen. In the remaining 10 cases, antibiotics were continued despite the fact that blood isolates were probably contaminants. The acquisition cost of antibiotics in these 80 patients was $30,600.00 ($382.00 per patient). Potential cost savings with pharmacy intervention was $4,950.00 ($62.00 per patient) with annualized savings of $19,800.00. Antibiotic adjustments are indicated in many patients with bacteremia, yet such adjustments are not often made. Early intervention by a clinical pharmacist may be useful in improving antibiotic utilization in bacteremic patients. 176 Safety Of Imipenem Therapy In Neonates R.L.STUART*, J. TURNIDGE AND M.L. GRAYSON. Infectious Diseases Unit, Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, VIC. Despite little published experience, imipenem (IMI) was introduced into our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Monash Medical Centre following an outbreak of infections caused by multi-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1993. To assess the safety of IMI therapy in neonates (preterm and term), we retrospectively reviewed the hospital and pharmacy records of all neonates treated with IMI from June 1994 to January 1995. Patient Characteristics: 80 patients were identified and all of these were evaluated. Of these neonates, the mean gestational age at birth was 30 ? 4.5 weeks (median 28, range 24 to 41 weeks) and at time of treatment was 32 ? 5 weeks (median 30; range 27 to 56 weeks). 56 neonates (70%) had major stigmata of prematurity (hyaline membrane disease, apnoea of prematurity, patent ductus arteriosis etc.), 9 (11%) had intracranial abnormalities (hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, intracerebral haemorrhage etc.) and a further 5 neonates (6%) had severe congenital birth defects. Treatment: 122 treatment courses were administered, with dosing regimens of 10-20 mg/kg/day (mean 25mg/kg/day, median 10 mg/kg/day), for a mean duration of treatment of 6.5 ? 6 days (median 5; range 2 to 53 days). Seventeen patients received IMI &gt; 10 days. Outcome: No neonate was withdrawn from treatment due to toxicity. There were 7 deaths in the study period, but all were unrelated to IMI therapy. Adverse events were: seizures, in 2 patients - both had underlying cranial abnormalities and pre-IMI seizures documented; diarrhoea, 1 patient; phlebitis, I patient. No rashes suggestive of p-lactam allergy were noted. Among all treatment courses, transient, reversible laboratory abnormalities were: neutropenia (0.8%), thrombocytosis (4.1%), eosinophilia (5.7%) and increased ALP (1.6%). Conclusion: This large study suggests that IMI is a safe agent in the treatment of preterm and term neonates in the Intensive Care setting. 177 Treatment of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) Infections. KK LAI*. University of Massachusetts Medical School and Center, Worcester, MA. In 7/93, we identified clinical isolates of multi-resistant Enterococcus faecium causing infections and colonization in our ICU's. These organisms demonstrated high-level resistance to B-lactam antimicrovials, vancomycin and the aminoglycosides. There is no currently available agent for treatment of VREF infections. Twenty-eight patients (pts) or 28 % of all colonized/infected VREF pts were infected. The infections included 6 bactermias, 9 surgical site infections (SSI), 4 peritonitis, 2 pelvic abscesses, 7 UTI's and 2 soft tissue infections (STI). Four of 6 bacteremia were central line related and resolved with line removal alone; one was treated with an investigational agent and one had persistent bacteremia in the presence of a V-P shunt. Seven of 9 SSI's resolved with surgical debridement and 2/9 patients received antibiotics for organisms other than VREF. Similarly, the 2 pts with STI were treated with local debridement alone, the pelvic abscesses were treated with drainage and surgical debridement and resolved completely. Pts with peritonitis were treated with removal of Tenchkoff catheter, drainage and irrigation, and one with an investigational agent, 3/4 were cured. Two of 7 UTI's were treated with nitrofurantoin and culture cleared post treatment, however, most pts cleared their urine despite no specific antimicrobial therapy. Although no antimicrobial agents are currently available for VREF infections, VREF line-related bacteremias could be treated by line removal alone, SSI, STI and abscesses by surgical debridement and drainage without specific antimicrobial agent against VRE, and UTI's could be resolved with nitrofurantoin or removal of Foleys. Removal of foreign devices, debridement and surgical drainage seem to be important in the resolution of VREF infections. 178 PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF A TWO HOUR VANCOMYCIN INFUSION IN CANCER PATIENTS. S. E. VARTIVARIAN, A. CACEK*, AND D. ABI-SAID. M. D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER, HOUSTON, TEXAS AND BOONE HOSPITAL CENTER, COLUMBIA, MISSOURI. Altered organ function often inapparent in cancer patients may compromise the distribution and/or elimination characteristics of medications. In this study we determined the pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin in cancer patients with normal creatinine. Total and protein unbound serum concentration-versus time curves for 15 lymphoma and 14 myeloma patients, receiving vancomycin 1 gm every 12 hr infused over 2 hrs, were used to determine distribution and elimination half-lives (t1/2a, t1/2,), total body clearance (CI) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss). The two patient groups were similar other than a significant difference in increased age and total protein value in myeloma patients. While variability existed for t1/2a, t1/2B, CI and Vdss between patients in each cancer group, there were no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between lymphoma, myeloma and previously described patient populations. The mean t1/2o for total and unbound concentrations was approximately 0.5 hours with the distribution phase greater than 90% complete at two hours post dose. We conclude that the distribution characteristics of vancomycin in lymphoma and myeloma patients are similar to previously reported populations and that peak plasma concentrations should be obtained two hours after the completion of a 2 hour infusion. 179 Pharmacodynamic Studies of Piperacillin in Combination with Tazobactam or Sulbactam Against B-Lactamase- Producing Gram-Negative Bacilli. A.M. PREVAN*, P.D. LISTER, and C.C. SANDERS. Center Research in Anti-Infectives and Biotechnology, Omaha, NE. It is currently unknown whether efficacy of B-lactamase-inhibitor/ B-lactam drug combinations is due to maintenance of a constant ratio between components or maintenance of a critical concentration of each component over the dosing interval. Therefore, an in vitro pharmaco- kinetic model was used to study the pharmacodynamics of piperacillin- tazobactam (PT) and piperacillin-sulbactam (PS) against B-lactamase- producing Gram-negative bacilli. Logarithmic-phase cultures were exposed to peak antibiotic concentrations observed in human serum after IV doses of 3g of piperacillin and 375 mg of tazobactam or sulbactam. Piperacillin and inhibitor were either dosed simultaneously or inhibitor was dosed 0.5 h prior to piperacillin. Human elimination kinetics were simulated, and killing over 6 h was evaluated. In tests with strains producing a chromosomal cephalosporinase and Escherichia coli producing TEM-10, killing by PS and PT was similar. Against E. coli producing TEM-1, killing with PT occurred throughout the 6 h dose interval. In contrast, killing over only a portion of the dose interval followed by regrowth was observed with PS. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae producing SHV-1, PS was bacteriostatic for 2 h followed by regrowth, compared to a 2-log kill and regrowth with PT. Furthermore, regrowth of this strain initiated 1 h sooner with PS compared to PT. In studies with K. pneumoniae producing SHV-2, bacteriostasis followed by regrowth was observed with both PT and PS. However, once again initiation of regrowth occurred 1 h sooner with PS. Against all strains, killing observed with simultaneous regimens of PT and PS was similar to killing observed when inhibitor was dosed 0.5 h prior to piperacillin. These data suggest that efficacy of B-lactamase-inhibitor/B-lactam combinations is not dependent upon maintenance of a constant ratio between components, but rather is dependent upon maintenance of a critical concentration of each component over the dosing interval.</page><page sequence="32">750 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 180 Cost-effectiveness of Strategies for S. Aureus Infection in Chronic Renal Dialysis. B Bloom* Univ Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, A Fendrick, Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Staphylococcus aureus infection is common in chronic renal dialysis patients. S. aureus nasal carriage is increasingly correlated with infection. Such infection often leadsto serious and costly adverse outcomes including shunt or catheter loss and revision or reinsertion. We used decision analysis to test in CAPD and hemodialysis populations two prophylaxis strategies for clearing nasal carriage of S. aureus with intranasal mupirocin (Strategy 1-test for intranasal S. aureus and treat those with positive result; Strategy 2-treat everyone with intranasal mupirocin) versus Strategy 3-wait for infection and treat with standard antibiotics. Prophylaxis was dominant (fewer infections and their sequelae and lower cost) over the strategy of wait for infection, and then treat. By preventing S. aureus infection, Medicare, the prime payer of care for chronic renal dialysis patients, would save annually between $750,000-$965,000 per 1,000 CAPD patients and $295,000-$1,169,000 per 1,000 hemodialysis patients, depending on the prophylaxis strategy. Eradicating nasal carriage of S. aureus should be pursued with or without prior screening. 181 Rapid Increase in Penicillin-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in Queens, New York. S.J. RAUF, J. BURNS, M. LIM, C. URBAN, AND J.J. RAHAL. The New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. Cornell University Medical College. The incidence of penicillin (P) resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) at this medical center increased from 15% in 1993 to 22% in 1994. During a 5 month period from 11/94 to 3/95, 39 isolates of SP were recovered from inpatients and outpatients. 15/39 (38%) were P-resistant and in 14 of 15, resistance was intermediate. Five major patterns of resistance occurred: P alone (6); P + sulfa-trimethoprim (3); P + erythromycin (2); P + sulfa-trimethoprim + erythromycin (1); and multiresistance (2). Three of 24 P sensitive strains were resistant to tetracycline alone. Clinical data on 29 isolates showed that 19 (66%) of all isolates occurred in patients &gt;60 years of age, and 5 of these 19 (26%) were P resistant. In patients &lt;60, 7 of 10 isolates (70%) were resistant (p= 0.046). 21 of 29 isolates (72%) caused clinical infection; 71% of sensitive, and 75% of resistant strains. One therapeutic failure occurred. Total mortality was 4/29 (14%); attributable mortality was 2/29(7%). 182 DOES TREATMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA IN ELDERLY AMBULATORY WOMEN REDUCE SUBSEQUENT SYMPTOMS OF URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI) ? *E. Abrutyn, J. Berlin, J. Mossey, P. Pitsakis, M. Levison, D. Kaye. Med. Coll. PA &amp; Hahnmenan U, Phila.VA Med. Center, U of PA Sch. of Med., Center for Clin. Epidem. and Biostat., Phila. PA OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly ambulatory women affects the subsequent development of symptoms of UTI. DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial PARTICIPANTS: Elderly women without urinary catheters MEASUREMENTS: Urine cultures every 6 months (the same organism at 105 colony-forming units or more per ml on two midstream urine specimens defined asymptomatic bacteriuria) and questionnaire surveys for the new development of symptoms of UTI (dysuria, frequency, urgency, low back pain with fever) 1, 3, and 6 months after the initial survey. RESULTS: Among the 23 initally culture positive participants receiving antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, 9 (39%) were culture positive at 6 months which contrasts with 18 of 27 (67%) who received no treatment or placebo, p =0.05. However, symptoms of urinary tract infection were more common in the antibiotic treated group. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic therapy effectively reduces the subsequent occurrence of positive urine cultures, but symptoms were not reduced. Based on this study of morbidity, previous studies failing to show any relation to mortality, and the cost and complications of antibiotic therapy in the elderly, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly women is contraindicated. 183 The Spectrum of Severity in Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE). J.S. BAKKEN*, R.L. TILDEN, Duluth Clinic, Duluth, MN, J.S. DUMLER, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, and D.H. WALKER, UTMB, Galveston, Tx. Thirty-seven patients from Minnesota and Wisconsin were confirmed to have been infected with HGE during 1990-1994. Of those, eight (22%) were female and 23 (78%) were male. The mean age of patients identified was 59 years, and 14 (38%) of the patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients presented with a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms and severity of infection, ranging from mild infections requiring no hospitalization to severe infections requiring therapy in intensive care units. Two 80-year-old men died, giving a case fatality rate of 5.4%. Symptoms described included fever, headache, myalgias, anorexia, abdominal pain, weakness, arthralgia, cough, and shortness of breath, while signs included vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, ataxia, seizures, rash, lymphadenopathy, and microscopic hematuria. Patients had an average of four signs and/or symptoms, with seven patients (19%) having a mild infection with only two symptoms/signs, and six patients (16%) having a severe illness with more than seven symptoms/signs. A severity index was constructed based on five parameters, including the total numbers of signs/symptoms, the maximum recorded temperature, the need for hospitalization, the need for ICU care, and whether or not the patient died. The range of values for the severity index varied among patients from three to 46 (maximum score possible was 50) with a mean value of 12.4. Patients over 65 years were 2.16 times (95% CI 1.17-3.99) more likely to be in the top half of the severity score than patients under the age of 65. Sex, verified tick bite, location of exposure, absolute number of infected neutrophils, and days of fever before therapy were not associated with severity of infection. However, patients with the highest severity score had significantly elevated relative neutrophil counts (64% vs. 48%, p &lt;0.04), lower relative lymphocyte counts (15% vs. 26%, p &lt;0.02)), hemoglobin concentrations (12.5 g/dl vs. 14.6 g/dl, p &lt;0.003), and length of hospital stay (p &lt;0.0001). HGE is often a serious infection which in the elderly can be particularly severe with potential for a fatal outcome. 184 Rapid Intravenous Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Desensitization In an HIV Infected Infant With Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia. N.J.WAECKER*, J.KELSO, B.PRICE, and M.ROBB. Naval Medical Center SD, San Diego, CA, and WRAIR, Rockville, MD. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common opportunistic infection in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PCP may in fact be the presenting illness in such children and is associated with an increased mortality rate. Trimethoprim-sufamethoxazole (TMP-S) is the drug of choice for prophylaxis and treatment of PCP. We report an HIV infected infant who had a history of fever and cutaneous reactions to previous courses of TMP-S and subsequently required treatment for PCP. He was rapidly desensitized intravenously (IV) to TMP-S over a 4 hour period. A two month old infant with perinatally acquired HIV was given TMP-S for PCP prophylaxis. After 3 weeks of therapy he developed a fever and a severe sunburn-like rash. TMP-S was discontinued. Five days later, he was rechallenged with TMP-S and developed an erythematous rash within 5 hours. TMP-S was again discontinued. Since he had failed to tolerate TMP-S but still required prophylaxis for PCP, he was admitted for IV pentamidine therapy. However, an admission CXR revealed an interstitial pneumonitis and bronchoscopy demonstrated numerous Pneumocystis carinii cysts. Since the patient now required treatment rather than prophylaxis for PCP, a protocol was devised to attempt to rapidly desensitize him to TMP-S. An initial dose of 0.0002 mg was given IV followed by doubling doses every 15 minutes until a therapeutic dose of 32 mg was achieved 4 hours later. The only side effect was mild erythema which occurred 4 hours after the therapeutic dose was achieved. This erythema resolved spontaneously, however, diphenhydramine was given prior to subsequent IV doses of TMP-S. He was treated with IV TMP-S for three weeks and has since has tolerated daily po TMP-S prophylaxis for six months without fevers, rashes or other adverse reactions. We thus report successful rapid IV desensitization with TMP-S in an HIV-infected infant with PCP despite a history of prior adverse reactions to the drug. 185 Resolution of an Epidemic of Mycobacteriun tuberculosis Infection Among Workers at a University Hospital After Mandatory Respiratory Isolation of Patients with Community-Acquired Pneumonia. N UYAMADU, S AHKEE &amp; JA RAMIREZ. Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY The rate of tuberculin skin test (PPD) conversion increased from a baseline of 0.3% before 1989 up to 1.7% in the first 6 months of 1991 among health care workers (HCW) at the University of Louisville Hospital. The epidemic was secondary to delays in diagnosis and respiratory isolation of patients with tuberculosis presenting as acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Since 80% of the patient population with CAP was considered to be at risk for tuberculosis according to CDC guidelines, a policy of mandatory respiratory isolation of all patients admitted with CAP was implemented in July 1991. Here, we review the effectiveness of this infection control policy. PPD results of all HCW at the hospital from January 1989 through June 1994 were reviewed. The total number of tuberculosis cases in the hospital and in the community was also reviewed. There was a total of 7153 employees tested during this period. After policy implementation, the rate of PPD conversion was 1.2% in 1991, 0.5% in 1992, 0.4% in 1993 and 0.7% in 1994. There was an association between policy implementation and decreased rate of PPD conversion among HCW that could not be explained by other factors. The number of cases of tuberculosis admitted to the hospital was stable and the number in the community actually increased during the same period. Respiratory isolation of all patients with CAP in areas where tuberculosis is prevalent may play a role in preventing tuberculosis infection among HCW.</page><page sequence="33">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 751 186 Rise of Serogroup B Meningococcal Infections in Southwest Washington State. J. YAO*, V. COWAN, D. JONES, B. JENSEN, and K. STEINGART. Southwest Washington Medical Center, and Southwest Washington Health District, Vancouver, Washington, U.S.A. Most outbreaks of meningococcal disease (MD) in the United States since 1991 have been due to serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis. Since late 1993, southwest Washington and Oregon have experienced an upsurge of MD caused by serogroup B strains. In Clark County, Washington (1994 population, 280,800), incidence of MD increased 5-fold from 1.5 cases/100,000 in 1987 to 8.9 cases/100,000 in 1994. Of the 25 laboratory-confirmed cases in 1994, 20 were due to serogroup B N. meningitidis. The cases consisted of bacteremia (13), meningitis (8), and bacteremia with meningitis (4), including 3 fatal cases. Case mean age was 14 yr (range, 6 mo. to 51 yr), with 44% of cases under 5 yr of age, and male to female ratio of 1:1.8. None of the cases were secondary cases, and no common risk factors were identified among the case patients. Seven of the 9 serogroup B meningococcal isolates available for multilocus enzyme electrophoretic typing were of the ET-5 complex, which has caused recent epidemics in Europe and Latin America. Our experience demonstrates the importance of prompt chemoprophylaxis for contacts of index cases, since the meningococcal vaccines currently available in the U.S. are not protective against serogroup B N. meningitidis. The recent rise of serogroup B MD also emphasizes the importance of continuing nationwide surveillance of the changing epidemiology of meningococcal infections in the United States. 187 Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) in Ontario 1992-1995: Clinical, Pathologic and Bacteriologic Features of 62 Cases. R.KAUL*, A.McGEER, A.E.SIMOR, B.SCHWARTZ, Ontario Group A Streptococcal Study Group, D.E.LOW. Mount Sinai Hospital/Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Canada and CDC, Atlanta, Georgia. Active, population-based surveillance for all invasive GAS infection in Ontario has been conducted by our group since January 1992. Cases where GAS is isolated in association with micropathologic features of (I) superficial fascial necrosis, (2) PMN fascial infiltration, and (3) thrombosis of small penetrating vessels are classified as definite GAS NF. Where histopathology is not available, a combination of gross pathologic findings and the clinical features of severe soft-tissue pain, bulla formation and skin necrosis are used to classify cases as probable NF. 62 cases since Jan 1992 have been classified with probable/definite GAS NF. In the winter of 1994/95 rates of NF increased to 0.51/10S/yr, from 0.13 in 92/93 and 0.08 in 93/94. Cases had a mean age of 52yr (range &lt; 1-95yr), and 65 % were male. A chronic, underlying disease was present in 53%, most commonly diabetes (25%), alcohol abuse (18%) or collagen vascular disease (8%). 3/62 (5%) had primary varicella infection. Mortality was 32 % (20/62) overall, and was strongly correlated with both age (mortality 6% &lt;35yr, 57% &gt;75yr, p=0.01), and presence of an underlying disease (47% vs 14%, p=0.01). 27/62 (44%) cases met the criteria for Streptococcal Toxic Shock (STSS), and the mortality was 56 % in this group. The primary site of infection was most commonly the lower extremity (34/62, 55%), followed by arm/shoulder (21%), hand (10%), groin (8%) and trunk (5%). In patients who survived to surgery, mortality was higher in those patients requiring amputation (6/17, 35%) than debridement alone (3/31, 10%). Prior NSAID use was reported in 28 % (13/47) of cases with available information, and did not correlate with outcome. M/T typing data is available on 48/62 patient isolates, and PCR for SPE-A/B/C genes on 35/62 isolates. M1 phenotype (in 44%, 21/48 isolates) did not correlate with mortality (Ml 24% vs other 44%, p=0.2) and was negatively correlated with STSS (M1 29% vs other 63%, p=0.02). Presence of neither the SPE-A (in 13/35, 37% of isolates) nor the SPE-C (in 18/35, 51%) genes correlated with mortality, although presence of one or other did predispose to STSS (61% vs 25%, p=0.05). We conclude that the incidence of NF due to GAS is increasing in Ontario. It is associated with significant rates of both STSS and death. Our experience does not confirm increased severity of disease due to GAS with Ml or SPE-A phenotypes. 188 Interhospital Variation in the Susceptibility of the Bacteroides fragirs group using New Interpretative Criteria. D.W. HECHT*. J.R. OSMOLSKI, and J.P. O'KEEFE. Loyola Univ., Maywood, IL 464 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (243 B. fragilis and 221 non-fragilis members of the group) were culled during 1994 from four university (Loyola, LU; Rush, RU; Univ. IL, Ul; Univ Chicago. UC) and four community teaching (Lutheran Gen, LG; Northwest Comm, NC; St. Francis, SF; Michael Reese, MR) metropolitan Chicago hospitals, and tested against 12 antibiotics using the NCCLS reference agar dilution method (M11-A3) and Wilkens Chalgren agar. M11-A3 includes new interpretative criteria and two breakpoints for interpretation. Antibiotics included piperacillin (PIP), cefoxitin (CEF), cefotetan (CET), ceftizoxime (CTX), clindamycin (CLN), levofloxacin (LOFI, ampicillin/ sulbactam (AMP/S), ticarcillin/clavulanate (TIC/C), piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/T), imipenem (IMI), and meropenem (MER), and metronidazole (MET). % Susceptibility at NCCLS susceptible and intermediate breakpoints Hospital PIP CEF CET CTX CLN LOF -)orgl 32 64 16 32 16 32 32 64 2 4- 2 4 LU (49) 73 73 67 92 47 59 82 94 80 84 53 78 RU 1110) 68 73 75 96 64 68 58 79 72 79 54 80 U (77) 56 60 62 88 53 61 49 73 66 73 51 70 UC (46) 65 72 65 87 54 59 59 76 67 72 51 72 LG (61) 69 80 64 93 56 62 77 89 72 79 64 79 NC (77) 77 82 79 96 57 74 70 82 82 90 65 78 SF (28) 64 75 68 96 61 64 82 93 75 86 50 65 MR (16) 81 81 81 94 69 81 94 100 75 75 75 87 &gt; 90 % of all isolates were susceptibility to AMP/S, TIC/C, PIP/T, IMI, and MER at the lower breakpoint, and no resistance to MET was detected (data not shown). In general susceptibility for PIP, CEF, CET, CTX, CLN, and LOF varied significantly among hospitals. In addition, susceptibility of B fragilis group isolates was generally less at university hospitals, compared with community teaching hospitals. Significant resistance to CLN, CET, and PIP noted at some hospitals is similar to our previous studies (data not shown). However, susceptibility to CTX and CLN was somewhat greater than previous years, possibly due to the change in reading criteria, which eliminates trailing endpoints. Despite changes in susceptibility as a result of new standards, significant resistance to some antibiotics persists at several Chicago hospitals. 189 Environmental and Behavioral Risk Factors for Lyme Disease in Children. S.C. EPPES, J.D. KLEIN and P. HUNT, Jefferson Medical College and Alfred I. Institute, Wil- mington, DE. While children constitute a significant percentage of reported Lyme disease (LD) cases, risk factors for infec- tion with B. burgdorferi apart from residing in an endemic area, have not been defined. Of 155 patients previously diagnosed in our LD clinic, 44 agreed to participate in a case/control study and to provide an age and sex matched control from the same neighborhood. A site visit was made to each case/control pair and Lyme disease serologies were obtained on controls. An extensive environmental survey examined 31 environmental variables, including details of the local eco-system. Questionnaires were administered to each case and control family, evaluating 50 items related to activities, behaviors, and potential exposures of each child. Two of the 44 control subjects had positive ELISA and Western blot results. Statistical analysis was performed using all 88 subjects and using a subset of 84, which excluded those case/control pairs. LD patients had a significantly higher likelihood of living in a home where deerticks had been identified and where ground cover included moist humus and leaf litter. Seronegative con- trols were significantly more likely to have groundhogs and bird feeders in their yards. Infection was not corre- lated with any childhood activities or behaviors; in fact, an inverse correlation was observed with camping and fishing. Frequency of tick checks, use of insect repel- lents and protective dress, and treatment of the yard was not different between groups. Conclusions: Infection with B. burgdorferi in children is related to conditions in the immediate hume environment, including certain ecological factors which favor the presence of Ixodes ticks. In this study, "high risk" activities were not correlated with an increase risk for LD. Anti-tick measures were not associated with a lower risk of Lyme disease. 190 Lactobacillus Bacteremia: A Review of 45 Cases. R HUSNI*, S GORDON, D LONGWORTH. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), Cleveland, Ohio Lactobacilli (LB) are part of normal gastrointestinal and genitourinary flora, but rarely produce blood stream infection (BSI). The largest previously published report of LB BSI described 9 cases. We reviewed 51 patients (pts) with positive blood cultures (BC) for LB at CCF between June 1979 and December 1994. Six pts were excuded because LB were considered contaminants. The remaining 22 females and 23 males had a mean age of 61 years (range 27-85). In 19 pts BC were obtained on admission; in 25 pts LB BSI occurred later in the hospitalization. Underlying diseases were common, including cancer (18), recent surgery (17), diabetes melitus (12), organ transplant (3), valvular heart disease (3) and ulcerative coltis (2). Twenty-two pts were critically ill in the ICU at the time of LB BSI; 11 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy, 11 were on TPN, and 23 received antibiotics without activity against LB prior to the onset of LB BSI. LB were the sole pathogen in 18 pts; polymicrobial BSI occurred in 27 pts and included Candida species in 7 pts. The source of LB BSI included intraabdominal abscess (6), endocarditis (2), vascular focus (2) and factitious (1). No source was found in 34 pts. Signs and symptoms included fever (31), rigors (10) and leukocytosis (29). The duration of LB BSI varied from 1 day (40) to 14 days (1). Forty-three pts received antibiotic therapy with a variety of regimens; 2 received no therapy because BC became positive postmortem. Mean length of hospital stay was 36 days (range 5-148 days). Thirty pts died, but in only 1 pt was death attributable to LB BSI. We conclude that LB BSI is frequently polymicrobial and occurs in pts with serious underlying illnesses, many of whom have received prior antibiotic therapy which may select out for LB. While rarely fatal in itself, LB BSI identifies pts with serious and rapidly fatal illness. 191 Evaluation of a Rapid Diagnostic Test for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Conducted by Pediatric Housestaff. M. A. RANA, L. R. KRILOV*, S. R. BARONE, S. M. LIPSON, and M. H. KAPLAN. Cornell University Medical College--North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY. RSV is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Accurate rapid diagnosis of RSV infection is useful in making cohorting and antiviral therapy decisions. Rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing for RSV has been shown to be more reliable (sensitivity/specificity=92%/93% [than direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) in the laboratory]) for bedside diagnosis of RSV when performed by housestaff under close supervision (Krilov et al., Pediatrics 1994;93:903-6). This study analyzes the use of a rapid RSV-EIA (Directigen RSV [D-RSV]) by housestaff without ongoing monitoring. Nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained patients with respiratory symptoms were tested by the pediatric housestaff using D- RSV. Aliquots of the same specimen were evaluated in the virology laboratory by DFA. From 11/94-2/95, 77 specimens were evaluated. Results for D-RSV vs. DFA Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) PPV (%) NPV(%) 28/49 (78%) 28/28 (100%) 38/38 (100%) 28/39(72%) Prior study: EIA vs. DFA 61/66 (92%) 66/71 (93%) 61/66 (92%) 66/71 (93%) These data demonstrate a significant decrease in the sensitivity (P &lt; .02) of rapid diagnostic testing from the previous study and emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring by trained personnel when these kits are used. The high specificity of the D-RSV may be helpful for clinical decision making regarding cohorting and antiviral treatment when DFA testing is not promptly available.</page><page sequence="34">752 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 192 A Descriptive Review of Mycobacteria Other Than Tuberculosis (MOTT). E.A. GRAVISS*, R.J. HAMILL, C.E. LACKE, R. HAJJEH, and R. SPIEGEL. VA Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who had MOTT isolated in two Baylor College of Medicine teaching hospitals in Houston, Texas from July 1, 1993 through July 1, 1994. Of 240 patients identified as having at least one MOTT in the study period, 145 (60.4%) were considered to have clinically relevant infections. Thirty-three (22.8%) occurred in women and 112 (77.2%) occurred in men. Of the clinically important isolates, 57.1% (64) of the men and 6.1% (2) of the women were known to be HIV+. MAC was isolated in 89.4% (59) of the HIV+ patients. Isolates were obtained in 79 HIV- patients, of which 60.8% (48) occurred in men. Of the HIV- men, 21 (43.8%) had M. kansasii and 15 (31.3%) had MAC isolated. Of the HIV- women, 21 (67.7%) had MAC isolated, while 7 (25.8%) had M. kansasii isolated. One HIV- woman was infected with both MAC and M. kansasii. Twenty-one of the 22 HIV- patients (95.5%) with a history of COPD were men. Nearly two-thirds (61.4%) of the clinically important infections were identified by sputum culture. Multiple positive sites of infection were identified in 67 (46.2%) patients. Of those patients with single isolates, 33 (42.3%) were identified by sputums and 23 (29.5%) were HIV+. The high percentage (71.7%) of patients with important respiratory isolates (sputum or bronchial washings) is also reflected in the most common symptoms at initial presentation: cough (53.1%), fever (46.2%) and dyspnea (24.1%), although weight loss was also a frequent complaint (26.2%). Positive acid fast smears were seen in only 25% (26/104) of these respiratory isolates. 193 Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Indices in the Newborn. A. AHMED*, S. EHRETT, S. HICKEY, M. TRUJILLO, F. BRITO, C. GOTO, K. OLSEN, K. KRISHER, and G.H. McCRACKEN. UT Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, Texas. Previosly published CSF indices in newborns evaluated for sepsis have variably excluded infants with bacterial or viral disease and traumatic lumbar punctures (LP) and provided little information on changes in these indices over the first month of life. We re-examined the CSF indices in newborns (0-4 wks of age) who underwent LP's to rule out infection and met the following criteria: 1) atraumatic LP (&lt;1000 RBC's); 2) no antibiotics before LP; 3) negative blood, urine, and CSF bacterial cultures; 4) negative CSF viral culture; and 5) negative CSF PCR for enteroviruses (EV). Infants were selected from a group of children enrolled in two prospective studies on aseptic meningitis conducted 1993-1994. 209 newborns were identified; 109 met the above criteria and had the following indices: CSF INDICES 0-7d 8-14d 15-21d 22-30d ALL N=18 N=33 N=25 N=33 N=109 WBC (mm3) Median 7 6 4 4 5 Range (1-130) (0-18) (0-62) (0-18) (0-130) 90th Percentile 28 10 12.5 8 11 ANC/mm3* Median 0 0 0 0 0 Range (0-65) (0-1) (0-2) (0-1) (0-65) 90th Percentile 4 0 1 0 0 Protein mg/dil 83.2?31.6 69.0?22.6 59.8?23.4 54.1+16.2 64.7?24.7 Glucose mg/dl' 46.0?7.5 54.3?17.0 46.8?8.8 54.1?11.7 51.2?12.9 % Glucose* 73% 70% 78% 61% 62% (WBC X %PMN)/100; t Mean + SD; f CSF/Blood Our results, though similar to previous findings, provide more information on CSF indices in the first month of life. Furthermore,the exclusion criteria were more rigorous, especially with the use of the EV PCR to exclude viral disease, and the number of infants in the 8 to 30 day groups were considerably larger. These indices may be useful in the evaluation of meningitis in the newborn. 194 Childhood Bacterial Meningitis in Saudi Arabia. A. KAGALWALLA, M. AL SHAALAN*Z. MEMISH, and M. Y. KHAN*. King Fahad National Guard Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This study analyses the bacterial etiology and outcome of childhood meningitis observed over an 11-year period. Charts of 70 children with this diagnosis were reviewed. Three children were under one month of age. Five were between 1 and 3 months. Sixty were between 3 months and 5 years. The remaining two were over 5 years. There were 36 females and 34 males. The presenting symptoms in decreasing order of frequency were fever 86%, vomiting 29%, poor feeding 19%, seizure 14%, and lethargy 14%. Etiologic organisms were as follows: H. influenzae 66%, S. pneumoniae 24%, N. meningitidis 4%, Group B. streptococci 4%, and S. aureus 2%. All H. influenzae isolates except one were sensitive to ampicillin. None of the S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin. Complications occurred in 39% of the patients and included subdural effusion 33%, hearing loss 14%, seizure disorder 10%, developmental delay 7%, hydrocephalus 6%, and motor deficit 3%. One patient died. Among H.influenzae cases, none of the 15 patients treated with steroids developed hearing loss. In contrast, 4 out of 31 who did not receive steroid therapy suffered from hearing loss. As H.influenzae is the predominant cause of childhood bacterial meningitis in Saudi Arabia, universal H. influenzae b vaccination for children is highly recommended. 195 Transfusion-Acquired Hepatitis C (HCV) Infection in a Canadian Population (1984-1987). J.K. PREIKSAITIS* T.M. STRAUTMAN, J. FENTON, R.P.B. LARKE. The University of Alberta, at Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The incidence of transfusion-acquired HCV infection has declined significantly over the last 15 years, even prior to the institution of specific anti-HCV blood donor screening in 1990. Unlike the U.S., Canada did not use surrogate marker screening (anti-HCV and AST) of blood donors for prevention of NANB hepatitis in1986/87. In order to determine the historical risk of transfusion-acquired HCV infection, we used a serum bank collected from 350 non-immunocompromised children and adults transfused in Edmonton between 1984 and 1987 as part of the study of transfusion-acquired cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. All subjects were CMV IgG negative prior to transfusion and follow-up specimens were collected &gt; three months after their last transfusion (median follow-up 3 mo, range 2 mo - 19 mo). Pre and post transfusion specimens were screened for anti-HCV using a third generation EIA (Ortho Diagnostic Systems). Reactive specimens were further tested by an immunoblot (RIBA-3 Chiron Corp) Four (1.3%) of subjects were anti-HCV positive pre-transfusion. Of the 311 remaining patients who had received a total of 3130 donor exposures, 6 (1.93%) seroconverted to anit-HCV. This represents a risk per unit transfused of 0.192% (.040% - .345%, 95% confidence interval). The risk of transfusion acquired HCV infection we observed (1.9% per patient) falls between the risks observed by other Canadian investigators for the period 1984-85 (3.1% per patient) and 1988- 1990 (1.26% per patient) and is comparable to reported U.S. risks with surrogate marker testing in place (1.54% per patient, 0.19% per unit, 1986-1990). These data will allow more accurate estimations of the number of HCV infected individuals in the Canadian population and assist in health care planning for the chronic disease burden associated with this infection. 196 Fatal Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever(RM1SF) in antibiotic era. 1Z Abolnik, KB Kirkland, MS Gelfand, DJ Sexton. Duke University Medical Center, Durham. NC and Methodist I lospital. Memphis, TN. Despite availability of effective therapy RMSF is still a fatal disease in 3-6% of cases. We retrospectively collected 18 cases of lethal RMSF that occurred from 1970 to 1994. Our patients included 3 females and 15 males. 9 were Caucasian, 8 were black and I was native American. Their ages ranged from 2 to 66 years (mean 31.2 /- 22.2 years). Patients were from North Carolina (14 cases), Virginia (2 cases) and from NMississippi and Massachusetts (I case each). Eight of 18 patients had known tick contact prior to their illness. In only 5 patients was a rash noted on first physician contact, but 10 additional cases developed rash before dying. All patients had fever &gt; or = to 38 degrees C on or before first physician contact. In all cases except one, illness began between mid April and September. 13 patients were treated with chloramphenicol. 5 received doxycycline or tetracycline. The average time from onset of symptoms to first effective therapy for RMSF. was 6.56 i/- 1.54 days (range 3 - 10 days), and to death 9.0 /- 3.05 days (range 6 -18 days). The average time from first physician contact to first effective therapy was 3.67 I/- 1.91 days (range 0 -7 days), and time from initiation of first effective therapy for RMSF to death was 2.44 /- 2.23 days (range 0- 8) in our series. Effective therapy for RMISF was started on first physician contact in only I of 18 cases. This patient was one of 5 who had a skin rash on first physician contact. These data illustrate that RNSF still kills young, previously healthy people. Death due to RMSF may occur even when proper therapy is started as early as 3 days after onset of symptoms and as soon as 48-72 hours after institution of effective therapy, despite the utilization of moder intensive care facilities. This supports the often quoted advice to begin empiric treatment, if RMSF is part of the differential diagnosis of an acute, febrile illness in a patient residing in or traveling to an area where and when RMSF is endemic. 197 Bordetella pertussis Infections and Sudden Unexpected Deaths in Children; a Preliminary Study. 1. U. HEININGER*, K. STEHR, 2. G. SCHMIDT-SCHLAPFER, 3. J.D. CHERRY. 1. Universitatsklinik fur Kinder and Jugendliche, Erlangen, Germany; 2. Universitatskinderklinik, Basel, Switzerland; 3. UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; and the SIDS Study Group. It was previously reported by one of us (Curr Probl Pediatr 1984; 14:1-78) that infant deaths due to B. pertussis were frequently attributed to other respiratory illnesses and Nicoll and Gardner in the same population noted that some B. pertussis deaths were reported as SIDS (Arch Dis Child 1988; 63: 41-47). Because of these observations we prospectively studied infants and young children in Bavaria with sudden unexpected deaths from Dec 1990 to Nov 1993. NP swabs for culture were obtained from 50 children with unexpected deaths. The mean interval between time of death and the NP swab collection was 1.1 days (SD + 0.8 days). B. pertussis was not isolated from any specimen but contamination with other bacteria (mainly Gram-negative enteric bacilli) and fungi was a major problem. Beginning in Nov 1993 we substituted the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for culture. PCR employed oligonucleotide primers PTpl and PTp2 which amplify a 191-base pair DNA fragment of pertussis toxin operon as previously described (Ped Inf Dis J, 1995; 14: 209-14). Specimens from 51 victims were studied. The mean age was 5.4 mos (SD + 4.4 mos) and the mean interval between time of death and swab collection was 1.5 days (SD + 1.2 days). Nine (18%) specimens were PCR positive for B. pertussis. These findings suggest that a substantial number of infant deaths thought to be SIDS occurred in B. pertussis infected children. The PCR positives which indicate B. pertussis infection could be (1) causative of the deaths, (2) B. pertussis carriage but not causative of death or (3) false positive results. Because of these 3 possibilities we have undertaken a new more comprehensive blinded control study specifically designed to study the causative role of B. pertussis in SIDS.</page><page sequence="35">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 753 198 Effect of Older Age on Survival in HIV Disease. J.N. MARTIN*', J.M. COLFORD, JR.2, L. NGO2, AND I.B. TAGER2. University of California, San Francisco' and University of California, Berkeley2. Several studies evaluating the effect of older age ( 50 years old) on survival after AIDS diagnosis have suggested that older patients have shortened survival compared to younger patients. Most of these studies, however, have used the time of clinical AIDS diagnosis as the starting point, leaving in question that delayed diagnosis in older patients may account for the apparent worse prognosis. To better control for stage of disease and more accurately evaluate the impact of older age on survival in late-stage HIV disease, we analyzed 846 HIV-infected patients at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 1987 to 1992. Baseline demographic and clinical variables (age, race, sexual orientation, injection drug use, and prior or concurrent AIDS diagnosis) as well as several laboratory parameters (CD4 lymphocyte count, CD4 percentage. CDS count, CD4:CD8 ratio, and hematocrit) were collected for each patient. Survival was measured from the date of initial lymphocyte testing until death or censoring. The median age was 42 years with 171 (20.2%) subjects age 50 years or greater. The median CD4 count was 223 cells/mm3. Compared to those aged less than 40 years. and after multivariable proportional hazards adjustment for other independent determinants of survival (CD4 percentage, CD8 count, hematocrit, and prior AIDS diagnosis) there was no difference in survival for ages 40 to 49, but a trend towards shorter survival in those aged 50 to 59 (relative hazard 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 - 1.94), and those aged 60 or greater (relative hazard 1.56, 95%9 CI 0.99 - 2.46). The relative hazards estimated from the multivariable model were then used to estimate median survivals for groups of patients of different ages but with the same standardized clinical and laboratory parameters. The estimated median survival for individuals age 60 years or greater with a standardized set of laboratory and clinical parameters (CD4 percentage of 15%, hematocrit of 42%, CD8 count of greater than 700 cells/mm3, but no prior clinical AIDS diagnosis) is 3.74 years compared to 3.94 years and 4.57 years for individuals with the same standardized clinical and laboratory parameters ages 50 to 59 years, and less than 50 years respectively. While older individuals do have a slightly shortened survival, this does not appear to be of the magnitude seen in earlier studies. The risk of older age on survival in late-stage lIV disease need not be too highly emphasized in the care of individual patients. 199 Infective Endocarditis at a University-affiliated Canadian Hospital: A 5-Year Review. S.E. SANCHE*, G.H.K. HARDING, St. Boniface General Hospital and University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. A retrospective review was performed on charts of individuals identified at hospital discharge as having had infective endocarditis (IE) during hospitalization between 1988 to1993. Applying the Duke Criteria for diagnosis of endocarditis, 30 cases were definite infective endocarditis, 10 cases possible, and 4 cases rejected. The median age for the 40 analyzed cases was 52. Predisposing cardiac lesions were identified in 55%: congenital disease 25%, prosthetic valve 13%, mitral valve prolapse 13%, previous IE 1%. Dental work within several weeks of diagnosis was noted in 9 cases, and 2 patients were known IV drug users. The aortic valve alone was involved in 45%, mitral alone in 33%, and both in 1 case. 10% were non-valvular or site unknown, and 1 case involved the tricuspid valve. The responsible organism was one of the viridans streptococci in 45%, S. aureus in 28%, and other gram positives in 1%. Gram negative bacilli were identified in 13%, and 10% were culture negative. Complications included emboli in 45% (cerebral in 25%), acute renal failure (18%), heart failure (18%), paravalvular abscess (10%) and death (25%). Valve replacement was performed in 40%. The median age, the rate of S. aureus left-sided endocarditis, the frequency of embolization and the valve replacement rate were higher in this series than in many others. These findings and the low frequency of tricuspid valve endocarditis in this series likely reflect the small number of IV drug users in this series. 200 Determinants of Pneumococcal Vaccination in the Elderly: A Logistic Regression Model. CB LeBuhn,* DM Ringold, BN Doebbeling. The Univ. of Iowa and Iowa City VAMC, Iowa City, IA. Pneumococcal vaccine is safe, highly efficacious in selected groups, and strongly recommended for persons 65 years of age and older. We evaluated data from the national 1993 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey [BRFSS] in order to estimate current pneumococcal vaccine acceptance rates and to determine factors associated with vaccination. The BRFSS is a yearly telephone survey of health behavior using random digit dial cluster sampling of U.S. households. Study participants &gt; age 65 (N-=19,799) were selected. Twenty nine percent had received pneumococcal vaccine previously. Mean age of the sample was 73.5 years, of which 90% were white, 7% black, 2.5% Hispanic and 65% female. We evaluated the association of pneumococcal vaccine acceptance with a variety of sociodemographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, health behaviors, and measures of access to care. A logistic regression model was developed on a random split sample of the study population (N=9,866) and validated on the remaining (N=9,933) sample. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test showed the fit was good in both the derivation and validation samples. Based on these results, the samples were combined, the model reestimated and fit reassessed. Factors independently associated with receipt of pneumococcal vaccine included: age (OR 1.02 per yr. &gt; 65, C195 1.013-1.025), race (black OR 0.76, Cl,5 0.61-0.94), self reported health status (poor vs. excellent, OR 1.76, C195 1.51-2.05), inability to afford a needed physician visit within the past year (OR 0.79, C195 0.68-0.93), current smoker (OR 1.30, C195 1.11-1.54), previous influenza vaccination (OR 25.34, C195 9.88-65.00), previous cholesterol screening (OR 1.53, C195 1.30-1.81), and previous rectal exam (OR 1.51, C19s 1.38-1.65). This model demonstrates that several patient related factors along with measures of preventive health behavior and services utilization are independently associated with pneumococcal vaccine acceptance in the elderly. Incorporating pneumococcal vaccine campaigns into community based screening or education programs may further improve vaccine delivery to at-risk populations. 201 Risk Factors, Clinical Manifestations, and Evolution of Infective Endocarditis Caused by Penicillin-Resistant Viridans Streptococcus Group. F. J. Vasallo, R. Sanchez, P. Mufioz, A. Llancaqueo, A. Menasalvas, and E. Bouza'. Hospital General Universitario "Gregorio Marafi6n", Madrid, Spain. Viridans streptococcus group (VSG) is a common cause of infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with heart disease. It has traditionally been considered uniformly susceptible to penicillin (PenS). The detection of penicillin-resistant VSG strains (PenR) in our media led us to analyze the characteristics of IE episodes caused by PenS and PenR strains. During the period 1991-1994 we detected 31 episodes of IE due to VSG (34.8% of SVG bacteremias) according to Duke's criteria. The most common underlying conditions were: previous cardiovascular disease (64.5%), HIV infection (25.8%), and diabetes mellitus (12.9%). The most frequent risk factor was IVDA (29%). Ten cases (32.3%) were caused by PenR strains and 21 (67.7%) by PenS. All PenR and 81% of PenS strains were community acquired. S. mitis was responsible for 6/10 PenR and 6/21 PenS episodes, and S. sanguis was responsible for 1/10 PenR and 8/21 PenS episodes. The MIC of penicillin for VSG ranged from &lt;0.03 to 8 ug/mL. The MIC,,/MIC,9 for PenS and PenR strains were &lt;0.03/0.12 lg/mL and 0.5/4 pg/mL, respectively. All VSG were susceptible to cefotaxime, with an MIC,,,/MIC,, for PenS and PenR strains of 0.06-0.5 pg/mL and 0.25-4 pg/mL, respectively. All VSG were also susceptible to vancomycin. Patients with PenR strains were treated with third-generation cephalosporins (5), vancomycin (5), or vancomycin plus gentamicin in 7 cases. Overall mortality was 0/10 for PenR episodes and 7/21 for PenS episodes. Both groups were not significantly different in age, sex, underlying diseases, risk factors, or clinical manifestations. In summary, a high rate (32.3%) of VSG IE is caused by PenR strains. The most important underlying disease continues to be cardiovascular; however, a large number of our patients were HIV positive (25.8%), mostly related to IVDA (29%). Our results suggest that IE due to PenR VSG does not have a worse prognosis when adequate antimicrobial therapy is chosen. 202 Thrombotic microangiopathy in HIV infection: reports of exposures to established drugs and estimates of baseline incidence. B. STYRT* and T. CVETKOVICH, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), has been reported to be related to several types of drug exposure and to both bacterial and viral infections including HIV. To provide background for newer drug studies, we searched the Spontaneous Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration for reports of thrombotic angiopathies after administration of drugs commonly used to treat HIV infection and its complications. Of 48 reports reviewed, there were 4 distinct cases with well-defined TMA in the setting of HIV infection. Zidovudine (3 patients) was the only drug definitely recorded as having been received by more than 1 of these patients; other drugs received included interferon alfa-2B, trimethoprim/sulfa, vincristine, bleomycin, DDI, sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, clindamycin, and pentamidine. Of 56 cases found in published literature with probable concurrent TMA and HIV, only 12 specified prior medication exposures: 6 of 12 had received zidovudine, 4 trimethoprim/sulfa, three pentamidine, and 2 each pyrimethamine, fluconazole, and cancer chemotherapy. In 23 cases, neither AIDS-defining conditions nor HIV had been diagnosed before TMA onset, so that zidovudine exposure was extremely unlikely. Of 3 cases in information requested from the Adult Spectrum of Disease database of the CDC, possible exposures included trimethoprim/sulfa in two, zidovudine in two, and dapsone in one. Documented TTP diagnoses occurred at an incidence of 0.05/1000 person-years in the CDC database and 0.9/1000 person-years in data requested from a Hopkins School of Public Health HIV clinic database. These findings suggest that clinically evident HUS/TTP is rare relative to other HIV-associated illnesses in these populations, and do not support a common pattern of exposure to currently marketed drugs, but may provide a basis for comparison to determine contributory risk factors. 203 Late infections in Heart Transplant (HT) Recipients. P. MUNOZ, FJ. VASALLO, JA GARCIA-ROBLES, T. PELAEZ, R. MUNOZ and E. BOUZA*. Hospital General Universitario "Gregorio Maran6n". Madrid. Spain. Most infections after HT occur during the first 6 months in well established risk periods. Late infections (LI) (&gt; 179 days after HT) are less frequently studied and reported. We have analyzed the incidence, clinical significance and prognosis of LI in HT patients. From August 1988 to September 1994, 176 HT were performed at our institution in 171 patients. From the 131 cases who remained alive 6 months after HT, 48 (36.6%) had 98 LI episodes during a mean follow-up period of 1128 days. LI appeared in a range of 180 to 1982 days post HT (median 396 d) and were almost always community acquired (92%). According to severity, 62 episodes (63.5%) were classified as mild: 26 URT (all with negative cultures-NC), 13 cutaneous (9 Zoster, 1 HSV, 1 fungal, 2 NC), 7 oropharyngeal (6 HSV, 1 Candida), 5 UTI (4 E. coll, 1 P. stuartil), 4 GIT (2 Salmonella, 2 NC), 4 LRT (NC) and 3 others (1 CMV). The remaining 36 episodes were severe (36.5%). Sites were: 12 LRT (7 NC, 2 CMV, 1 S. pneumonias, 1 E. coli, I P. aeruginosa), 7 UTI (4 Enterobacteriaceae, 2 NC, 1 Corynebacterlum), 6 skin (2 HSV, 1 Zoster, 2 Varicella and 1 NC), 3 URT (NC), 1 GIT (NC), 1 CNS (L. monocytogenes), 1 disseminated mucormycosis, 1 rib osteomyelitis (MS S. aureus) and 4 with no focal disease. Patients with severe episodes had more commonly a past history of CMV infection (69%/48%), nosocomial acquisition (19%/1%), and a closer previous infection (88/172 days) (p&lt;0.05). Requirement for antimicrobial therapy (96%/69%) and hospital admission (83%/24%) was higher in severe infections. Three patients died, 2 due to infection (1 with nonfiliated septic shock and I with disseminated mucormycosis). Survival of HT recipients was not significantly different between patients with and without LI (87% vs 77%). After the critical first 6 months post-HT, infections remain as a cause of concern. They occur in 36% of patients, require hospital admission in 46% and are occasionally life-threatening.</page><page sequence="36">754 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 204 The Effect of Primary Care for HIV Infection on Emergency Department Utilization. J.E. GALLANT*, S.M. McAVINUE, R.D. MOORE. The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland. Because of the changing demographics of the HIV epidemic, a growing number of HIV-infected individuals are uninsured and have inadequate access to health care. This has placed a heavy burden on emergency departments (EDs) of many inner city hospitals. To examine the effect of enrollment in an HIV clinic on utilization of the ED by HIV-infected patients in a large metropolitan teaching hospital, we conducted a retrospective analysis of two databases: a hospital database containing all ED visit dates, and a clinic database containing baseline demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data an all clinic enrollees. We assessed ED use during the periods 12 months before and after the first clinic visit on all patients who had at least one ED visit within the 12 months prior to their first clinic visit. The Wilcoxon sign-rank test for paired data was used to compare ED use before and after the first clinic visit. By multivariate analysis no sociodemographic charactersitic predicted ED use prior to clinic enrollment. For the 272 patients analyzed, the number of visits decreased from 756 in the year before clinic enrollment to 657 in the year after enrollment, a decline of 13%. Mean annual ED visits decreased from 2.78 to 2.42 after the first visit (p=.003). Significant decreases in visits were observed for patients without AIDS (decrease of 0.51, p=.004), patients with enrollment CD4 counts &gt;200/mm3 (0.37, p=.003), women (0.44, p=.009), injection drug users (0.46, p=.027) and non-injection drug users (0.21, p=.003), African-Americans (0.42, p=.003), residents of East Baltimore (0.34, p=.018), and patients insured by Medicaid (0.47, p=.018). Only white patients had a greater mean number of visits after enrolling in care, but the difference was small (0.04) and not significant (p=.508). Despitethe fact that patients with HIV infection have greater needs for health care with progressive illness, we found that ED utilization decreased signficantly after enrollment in a primary care HIV clinic The reduction was most pronounced among groups who have been shown to have high rates of ED utilization in other studies. Any discussion of the cost of HIV care must take into consideration health care costs incurred by patients who are not receiving primary care. 205 Risk Factors and Outcome in Chronic Hemo- dialysis Patients with Bacteremia. T HODGE, L SACKS*, R HUBER, J VEIS, F GORDIN. VA Medical Center, Wash.DC. 51 bacteremic episodes (BE) were identified over a 3 year period among a population of 151 chronic hemodialysis patients at a rate of 2.6/100 patient-months. Most BE's (88%) occurred more than one week after access placement. Each BE was matched for patient age and approximate date of culture with a non-bacteremic control hemodialysis patient. The correlations between a bacteremic episode and other clinical risk factors are tabulated below. wbc alb urr T P G F D* n= 47 46 44 43 43 43 43 51 bac 8.6.6 .6 55 15 16 12 0 9 con 6.7 3.9 64 3 1 35 4 2 p .008 .006 &lt; .001 .002 &lt;.001 &lt;.001 .1 .02 NBC=mean leukocyte count in preced ng month, a= ean serum albumin in preceding month, URR = urea reduction ratio in preceding quarter, T=temporary catheter, P=permanent catheter, G=graft, F=fistula, D*=death within one month of bacteremia, n = number of patient/control pairs, bac = bacteremic patient, con =control patient, p =p value. Permanent catheters were most strongly associated with BE's [OR = 25, (CI 3-1068)] while grafts were rarely present during BE's [OR =0.09,(CI .03-.3)]. Neither underlying HIV disease nor diabetes mellitus were significantly correlated with bacteremia. Low URR's, high WBC's and low serum albumins suggest subsequent bacteremia. The risk is further related to access type. Permanent catheters in particular are highly associated with bacteremia. Once bacteremia occurs it is significantly associated with patient death. Vigilant attention to access type and other risk factors identified in this study may allow a reduction in dialyses related sepsis and mortality. 206 Clinical Significance of Discordant (Disc) CD4 Count (CD4) and CD4 Percent (%) In HIV-Infected Individuals (Hll). T.P.LE*, D.R.TRIBBLE, J.L.MALONE, S.Y.J.ZHOU, R.C.Y.CHUNG, J. RUSNAK, K.F.WAGNER. National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, and the Military Medical Consortium for Applied Retroviral Research, Rockville, MD. CD4 and CD4% decline in parallel over time in HIV disease. The significance of disc CD4 parameters, defined as normal CD4 but depressed CD4%, is not known. We did a retrospective study, comparing the demographics and clinical progression of two groups of HII, one with concordant (conc) and the other with disc CD4 parameters, over a period up to 8.5 years. At study entry, there were 562 in the conc and 47 in the disc group. Both groups were within 6 months from initial HIV diagnosis with CD4 between 500 and 700. The conc group had CD4% above 20% and disc group below 20%. The mean CD4 and CD4% at entry in the conc and disc groups were 590/30.1% and 570/17.2% respectively. Rate of decline of CD4, WBC and hemoglobin plus progression to specific opportunistic infections (01), anergy, CD4 below 200 and death were compared. Outcome Group n % p-value Mean Time p-value Anergy Concordant 133 23.7 0.968 6.03 0.863 l Discordant 11 23.4 5.26 New 01 Concordant 54 9.6 0.246 7.17 0.304 Discordant 7 14.9 6.81 CD4&lt;200 Concordant 122 21.7 0.945 6.16 0.994 Discordant 10 21.3 4.81 Death Concordant 32 5.7 0.054 7.69 0.127 Discordant 6 12.8 6.65 Incidence of death was higher in the disc group, approaching statistical significance. The relative risk (RR) of death is further calculated to be 2.25, with chi-square of 2.47 and p-value of 0.12. Otherwise, both the incidence of and time to clinical endpoints were not significantly different in the two groups. Rate of decline of CD4, WBC and hemoglobin were also similar in both groups. Interestingly, WBC and total lymphocyte counts (TLC) were consistently greater in the disc group. The only demographic difference was the absence of female patients in the disc group. In summary, Hll who have disc CD4 parameters, with normal total CD4 but depressed %, perhaps from elevated TLC, did not progress to AIDS any differently than their counterparts with conc parameters. The RR of death was marginally higher in this disc group of individuals. 207 Clostridum spp. Bacteremia and the New Definitions of Sepsis: The Case for the Number of Positive Cultures. G. ZANCADA, T. PELAEZ, F. GARCIA-GARROTE, P. MUNOZ, M. RODRIGUEZ-CREIXEMS AND E. BOUZA*. Hospital General Universitario "Gregorio Marafi6n". Madrid, Spain. Background: Clostridium spp. is one of the anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated from blood cultures (BC). However, the clinical significance of clostridial isolates remains unknown in many occasions. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the clinical significance of bacteremia caused by one, or more than one, positive blood cultures (BC) with Clostridium spp. Material and Methods: We used as reference the clinical definitions of Bacteremia, Sepsis, Sepsis Syndrome and Septic Shock according to ACCP/SCCM's criteria. We retrospectively reviewed 71 patients with clostridial bacteremia detected in our institution during a period of 4 years. Results: Clostridium spp. isolated from a single BC out of the 3 taken (1/3) was found in 76% of the cases (54/71) and two or more positive isolations (&gt;2/3) were found in 24% (17/71). Information regarding the sepsis data in both groups is summarized in the table: I + BC &gt; 2-3 + BC Total Bacteremia 42 (77.8%) 0 42 (59%) Sepsis 8 (14.8%) 9 (53%) 17 (24%) Sepsis Syndrome 2 (3.7%) 2 (12%) 4 (6%) Septic Shock 2 (3.7%) 6 (35%) 8 (11 %) Total 54 17 71 Patients with clinical manifestations of sepsis and one positive BC (12/54) had Clostridium perfringens in 7 (58.3%) and Clostridium spp. in 5 (41.7%) versus 39 (93.85%) and 3 (7.15%) respectively of them with only bacteremia. Conclusion: The number of positive BC with Clostridiwn spp is a predictor of clinical significance and sepsis. Sepsis was present in 22.2% of those with a single positive BC versus 100% of those with 2 or more positive BC. 208 Changing Spectrum of Significant Bacteremia During a 10 Year Period in a Large Teaching Institution. M. RODRIGUEZ-CREIXEMS, P. MUNIOZ, T. PELAEZ, JCL BERNALDO DE QUIROS, E. CERCENADO AND E. BOUZA*. Hospital General Universitario "Gregorio Marah6n". Madrid, Spain. The impression of a recent increase in significant bacteremia caused by Gram positive microorganisms, particularly those of the genus Staphylococcus, and fungi has been raised. However, reports of large series to substantiate it are scarce. We report our experience with the evolution of significant pathogens isolated in blood during 10 years in a 2000 bed General Hospital with particular emphasis in the evolution of Gram positives.

Alcala, F. Garcia Garrote, E. Bouza*.Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maran6n, Madrid, Spain. Metronidazole resistance (MIC &gt; 16 mcg/ml) in Bacteroides fragilis group (BGF) is very uncommon . Risk factors, clinical manifestations and evolution of infected patients are unknown . From January 1989 to December 1994, 20 MRBF (1.8% of 1034 BGF isolated), were recovered from clinical specimens. Clinical information was available from 14 patients with those infections (median age 61, 50% had some type of underlying disease). The 14 MRBF infections were compared with a control group of 28 infections caused by metronidazole-sensitive Bacteroides fragilis (MSBF). In the study group the infection was community-acquired in 11/14 (78%). Syndromes included 9 intraabdominal infections, 3 postsurgical infections and two soft-tissue infections. In the month preciding the MRBF infection, three patients had received antimicrobial therapy, but none was treated with metronidazole. Treatment of MRBF infections consisted of surgical or percutaneous drainage along with antimicrobial therapy. Thirteen out of 14 (93%) patients survived , however on 10 /14 an inadequate anti-anaerobic regimen was prescribed. The MRBF and MSBF infections did not differ in age, sex, type and severity of underlying disease, place of acquisition of the infection, number of admissions along the previous year, type of surgery ( open of percutaneous procedures), prior antimicrobial therapy (one month interval), number of microorganisms per specimen, mortality and length of admission. We did not found differences between clinical characteristics of infections caused by MRBF and MSBF. Nevertheless, the emerging of this new type of resistance in a more than anecdotal amount requires a word of caution on the massive use and misuse of metronidazole in both prophylactic and therapeutic indications.</page><page sequence="37">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 755 210 The Anergy Screen as a Predictor of Intact Cutaneous Delayed-type Hypersensitivity in Residents of a Long Term Care Facility. E.S. PARTLOW, .W.J. MAYHEW, A. KUREISHI'. The Foothills Provincial Hospital and The University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta. An anergy screen is often used in individuals with suspected exposure to M. tuberculosis but who test purified protein derivative (PPD) negative. The anergy screen involves intradermal injection of common antigens (Ag) to assess delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Thus PPD negative patients that do not respond to the anergy screen are assumed to have impaired DTH. In the investigation of a cluster of PPD conversions in staff, 171 residents of a long-term care facility were screened with a two-step boosted PPD skin test, and concurrently screened for cutaneous anergy with mumps, trichophyton, and candida Ag. While our a priori objective was to screen for TB, we were secondarily able to test the assumption that non-responders to the anergy test had an impaired DTH. Response (significant skin test Ag response &gt; 4mm induration, PPD &gt; 9mm) was assessed at 48 hours and those with a negative PPD response were boosted at 14 days. Non-response to all four initial Ag (anergy) occurred in 56.7% (97/171) of residents and non-response to mumps, trichophyton, and candida was seen in 63.7%. Fifty percent of the individuals with a positive initial PPD response had negative responses to the three other antigens. The frequency of significant responses were: initial PPD 12.9% (221171), boost PPD 5.6% (8/142), Mumps 24.0%, Trichophyton 13.5%, and Candida 6.4%. Age was significantly related to anergy (mean age anergic 81 vs non-anergic 76, p=0.003). Further clinical and radiological investigation failed to identify a case of active tuberculosis. We conclude that in this population 1) The three step anergy screen is not a good Predictor of DTH, since half the individuals with positive PPD did not respond; 2) anergy was very common and was associated with increasing age; 3) mumps was the most likely antigen to elicit a positive DTH response. 211 Comparison of Telephone Access to a University HIV/AIDS Clinic and a Private Infectious Disease Practice. R.E. MORRISON*, J.Y. WAN, C.S. DORKO, S.J. SARGENT, M.A. LAND, and C.B. BRONZE. The University of Tennessee, Memphis, Departments of Medicine and Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Memphis, TN. Since the advent of capitated managed care, telephone contact has become an increasingly important element of patient access to medical care. In order to better understand this component of care for patients with HIV/AIDS, we utilized SAS statistical applications to analyze the content of 109 consecutive patient-related calls made to our multi- physician University HIV/AIDS clinic (UC) and 67 consecutive HIV/AIDS patient-related calls made to a single-physician, infectious disease private practice (PP). Both sets of calls were made during regular office hours. The demographics of patients were similar in both clinical settings except that the mean age of patients in the UC was 34 years and 40 years in the PP. Medication inquiries made up 51% of the calls to the UC and 36% to the PP (p=.044). Requests for laboratory results comprised 18% of the calls to the UC and 4% of the calls to the PP (p=.008). Symptom-related inquiries made up 17% of the calls to the UC and 4% to the PP (p=.012). In response to calls made to the UC, 1.5 additional actions were required per call but only 0.5 at the PP (p=.0001). A physician was consulted 46% of the time in the UC but only 19% of the time in the PP (p&lt;.001). Physicians were required to return calls only 1.8% in the UC and 1.5% in the PP. We conclude that most regular office-hour patient-related calls can be handled successfully by paramedical personnel. Interaction between physicians and paramedical personnel may deterline the likelihood of physician involvement in patient-related calls. In addition, practice settings may influence the nature of patients' calls and responses to these calls. Effective attention to medication inquiries and systematic dissemination of laboratory results could greatly influence the tnumber and types of patient-related calls. 212 Comparison of Three Nucleic Acid Amplication Techniques With Mycobacterial Smear and Culture for Identification of M. tuberculosis in Respiratory Specimens. J.R. DALOVISIO*, S. MONTENEGRO- JAMES, C.F. GENRE, S.A. KEMMERLY, R. CHAMBERS, D. GREER, G.A. PANKEY, D.F. FAILLA, E.S. COOPER, and K.D. EISENACH. Ochsner Medical Institutions, Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR. To investigate the previously undefined role of nucleic acid amplication techniques (NAAT) in diagnosing M. tuberculosis (MTB), we examined 240 respiratory specimens submitted for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) culture at Ochsner Foundation Hospital or Charity Hospital in New Orleans. After being processed for culture and smear, the digest was divided into 3 aliquots and tested by Roche Amplicor MTB test, Gen-Probe Amplified MTB Direct test, and polymerase chain reaction method of Eisenach using a 123-base-pair target within the IS6110 insertion sequence. Of the 240 specimens, 39 (16%) cultured positive for MTB, and 66 (28%) cultured positive for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Of these 105 culture-positive specimens, 37% (39/105) were smear-positive, including 41% (16/39) of MTB and 35% (23/66) of NTM. Of the 23 specimens that were smear-negative but MTB culture-positive, 12 (52%) were detected by Roche, 15 (65%) by Gen-Probe, and 16 (70%) by Eisenach. Of all culture-positive MTB specimens, 69% were detected by Roche, 77% by Gen-Probe, and 80% by Eisenach. For specimens culture-negative for all mycobacteria, Roche was positive in 3.7%, Gen-Probe in 2.2%, and Eisenach in none. For specimens culture-negative for MTB but culture-positive for NTM, Roche and Gen-Probe were each positive in 6%, and Eisenach was positive in 3%. Culture-negative respiratory specimens that were positive by any of the three NAAT are presently being analyzed. Culture-negative predictive values were 94% for Roche, 95.6% for Gen- Probe and 96.2% for Eisenach. Current NAAT are less sensitive than culture for detectio n of MTB in respiratory specimens. NAAT are specific for discrimination of MTB from NTM in smear-positive respiratory specimens and more sensitive than smear for rapid detection of MTB. 213 Influence of the Radiometric Broth Culture System on Early Treatment Decisions in Tuberculosis (TB). M. BHATTACHARYA, J. POTTINGER, T. TEOTONIO, AND J. R. WARREN. Northwestern Univ., Chicago, IL. The radiometric broth culture system (BACTEC, Becton Dickinson) accelerates detection and isolation of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in clinical specimens. To evaluate the impact of broth culture on early treatment decisions, culture-confirmed cases of TB were retrospectively compared at Hospital A (BACTEC + solid media) (n=31) and Hospital B (solid media alone) (n=21). Hospitals A and B are teaching affiliates that share attending and resident staff. Clinical presentation of patients was similar at both hospitals, with fever (58%, Hospital A; 81%, Hospital B), weight loss (65% and 38%), productive cough (55% and 38%), shortness of breath (39% and 52%), and fatigue (45% and 57%). Chest radiographs at Hospital A most frequently showed upper lobe infiltrates (81%), cavitary lesions (32%), and pleural involvement (19%). Similar radiographic findings were observed at Hospital B, where the respective frequencies were 52%, 10%/, and 52%. Most patients were placed in respiratory isolation prior to availability of laboratory results, 74% at Hospital A and 71% at Hospital B. Initial laboratory reports were comparable at the two hospitals: Positive acid-fast smear (65% vs. 57%) and growth in culture of AFB (35% vs. 43%). The basis for initiation of TB drug treatment at the two hospitals included: Presence of AFB on smear, 39% vs. 48%; growth of AFB in culture, 13% vs. 0%; identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in culture, 6% vs. 10%; tissue diagnosis of granulomatous disease, 3% vs. 0%; previous diagnosis of TB, 10% vs. 10%; household exposure to TB, 3% vs. 0%; and presumptive, 23% vs. 19%. Thus, culture results were the basis of initial treatment decisions in only 19% (Hospital A) and 10% (Hospital B) of patients. This suggests that culture methodology (radiometric broth or solid media) is of secondary importance for early drug treatment in TB. 214 Benefit of 2-step PPD testing of new employees at a NYC hospital. RIVERA P, SEPKOWITZ KA*, LOUTHER J, VILLA R, HALE M, DE HOVITZ J. St. Clare's Hospital, New York, NY. Since 2-93, we have routinely 2-step PPD tested all new employees at St. Clare's Hospital in New York City to exclude potential "pseudo-convertors" from calculated annual HCW conversion rates. 204 consecutive new employees hired 2-93 through 12-94 were 2-step tested. Of these, 40 (20%) were positive on the first test and an additional 15 (7%) on the second test (5 in 1993 and 10 in 1994). In 1993, the HCW conversion rate was 4.7% (19 conversions/403 tests performed). Inclusion of the additional 5 persons excluded by 2-step would have increased the 1993 conversion rate from 4.7% to 5.9%. In 1994, the HCW conversion rate was 4.2% (16 conversions/385 tests). Inclusion of the 10 persons excluded by 2-step would have increased the 1994 conversion rate from 4.2% to 6.8%. Of the 15 persons who became positive on 2- step, 13 (87%) had received BCG vs. an overall proportion of BCG+ new employees at our hospital during 1993-4 of 35-40%. Routine 2-step PPD testing of new employees is an effective means of identifying PPD+ HCW. Exclusion of these potential "pseudo-convertors" is important to monitor annual HCW conversion rates. Previous BCG vaccination may be associated with a positive 2- step test, suggesting that 2-step testing identifies persons infected with M. bovis by vaccination as well as those latently infected with M. tuberculosis. 215 An Outbreak Of Psittacosis: Severe Disease In Pregnancy And Suppression of Antibody Response with Early Therapy. R KHATIB*, MC THIRUMOORTHI, B KELLY, KJ GRADY. St. John Hospital, Detroit, Michigan. A cluster of three cases of psittacosis occurred among members of one family traced to an 8-week old Quaker parrot. The parrot was noted to be sick 8 days prior to the illness in case 1 and died within 10 days. The first case was a 31 year old woman, 32-week pregnant, who hand fed the parrot and petted it. She presented with extensive multilobar infiltrates and severe respiratory distress necessitating mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory failure worsened during 36 h of erythromycin therapy. Improvement coincided with the termination of pregnancy and the initiation of doxycycline treatment. Two other family members (33 year old male and 14 year old female) began to take care of the birds and hand feed them after case 1 was affected. They became ill, 8 days after they began to feed the birds and were found to have a patchy pulmonary infiltrate localized to a single lobe. They were promptly treated with doxycycline and improved within a few days. Complement fixing antibody test, utilizing Chlamydia psittaci-specific antigen, demonstrated seroconversion in case 1 (&lt;1:8-1:32), low non-diagnostic titers in case 2 (1:8-1:16) and remained negative in case 3 (&lt;1:8). Six other family members t2-13 years old) who did not feed the birds or clean their droppings remained well and none of them had detectable Chlamydia psittaci antibody. One of two other birds purchased along with the parrot 18 days prior to the outbreak, became ill 10 days after the parrot died. It was found to have Chlamydia psittaci antigen in it's cloaca. The characteristics of this outbreak suggest that close contact with the implicated bird is necessary for effective transmission, that pregnant women maybe at risk for severe disease and that early treatment may suppress antibody response.</page><page sequence="38">756 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 216 Non-organ specific autoantibodies against cellular components in HIV-1 infected individuals. T. KordossisI, L. Pichal,2, A. Guialis2, O. Kosmopouloal, A.G. Tzioufas1 and H.M. Moutsopoulosl Dept. of Pathophysiology1, Med. Sch. of Athens, Inst. Biology / BiotechnologyL, Nat. Inst. of Res., Athens, Greece. There are striking similarities between HIV-infection and autoimmune phenomena including various autoinmmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (S.S.) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (S.L.E.). Several investigators have reported the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), while others have failed to demonstrate these autoantibodies in similar cohorts of patients . The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of antibodies against cellular components using highlly sensitive and specific techniques such as Immunoblot and RNA precipitation. Sera from sixty-three patients with HIV-I infection and seventeen healthy HIV- seronegative controls were tested. Counter immunoelectrophoresis test (CIE), indirect immunofluorescence studies (I.F.), SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and RNA precipitation assay were performed. A cross-inhibition assay was also performed in order to investigate whether a cross-reaction between autoantibodies and antibodies against viral proteins was present. Six sera (9,5%) from HIV-infected individuals belonging to categories A and B according to CDC /1993 have shown reactivity in Immunoblot against various unidentified autoantigens with cytoplasmic localization and different Molecular Weights of 40kd, 45kd, 55kd, 65kd and 170kd. These autoantigens were not recognized by autoimmune sera with known specificity such as a-Sm, a-Ro, a- La, a-Sc-70, a-UI-RNP. Negative results in RNA precipitation assay have shown that the unidentified autoantigens are not components of small nuclear or cytoplasmic complexes. The cross-inhibition assay did not show clear-cut results. In contrast to previous controversial reports the present study clearly demonstrates that a minority of HIV-infected individuals produce autoantibodies expressed against cytoplasmic components of unknown specificity. The presence of these autoantibodies does not correlate with the clinical picture and the laboratory profile of the syndrome. It is postulated that the production of these autoantibodies might be due to the B-cell polyclonal activation induced directly or indirectly by viral proteins. 217 Thrombocmbolic disease in AIDS patients found at autopsy. E. Agapitosl, N. Goutasl, O. Kosmopoulou2, and T. Kordossis2 . Depts. of Pathologyl and Pathophysiology (AIDS tnit)2, Medical School of Athens, Greece. In order to delineate tlhe incidence of TE in AIDS we have reviewed our pathology records of AIDS patients on whom autopsy was performed. Between June 1990 and September 1994, 34 patients with AIDS were autopsied. These were 29 males and 5 females, mean age 31 years (range 30 days - 62 years). Risk factors for the acquisition of HIV infection included: 20 hlomosexuals/bisexuals, 6 IVDU's, 2 polytransfused, 2 infants from seropositive mothers and 4 heterosexuals. From the above 34 autopsies in 3 cases (8,8%) a spleenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis with extention to the portal vein were found. The rest of the pathological findings shortly were as follows: a)A 48-year old male, Ihomosexual, in wlhom CMV pneumonitis, spccenic tuberculosis and myelodysplastic syndrome, b) A 46-year old male, homosexual. in whlom an acute massive upper gastrointestinal Ihaemorrhage accelerated Ihis death; extended spleenic infarction and a common liver abscess. c) A 30-day old female infant in whom a deep left femoral venous thrombosis as well as extended pulmonary embolism. It should be mentioned that the above tlree patients were bedridden. Only in the latter case (c) clinical suspicion arose two days prior to death in an abdominal CT, so heparin was initiated. The true incidence of TE in AIDS patients has not yet been estimated. In one study the reported incidence in a suffficient number of AIDS patients (n=243) was found 3,3%. In a more recent study , the authors state that in their material (26 patients) 11,5% of their AIDS patients developed venous thrombosis. The above percent is close with our pathologically confinned finding of 8,8?%. although the number of patients in both studies is small. Apart from 1 patient (a) with CMV pneumonitis, which is a known risk factor. the others 2 did not have complete coagulation studies. The only common risk factor was that all 3 were bedridden and no neoplasn (in particular Kaposi's sarcoma) was found at autopsy. In conclusion clinicians caring for AIDS patients should be alert to the possibility that TE may complicate the course of AIDS, even in the absence of risk factors. 218 The Value of Laboratory Risk Category Assignment in Predicting Acute or Recent Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE). J.S. BAKKEN*, R.L. TILDEN, J. KRUETH, C. WILSON NORDSKOG, Duluth Clinic, Duluth, MN, and K. ASANOVICH, J.S. DUMLER, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD. To assess the value of assigning a risk category to blood samples from patients with an acute febrile illness to predict the likelihood of HGE, we analyzed 280 acute and/or convalescent blood samples collected from 202 patients between 1/1/93 and 12/31/94. Patient samples with WBC s3.0 x 109/L or platelet count of 100 x 1 09/L were labelled suspicious (S), while samples with WBC &gt;4.5 x 109/L or platelet count &gt;150 x 109/L were considered routine (R). Samples with values between S and R were labelled moderately suspicious (MS), and convalescent samples or samples without WBC or platelet values were unassigned (NA). Acute phase Wright stained blood smears were evaluated for presence of neutrophil morulae. All sera were analyzed by IFA using E. equi to detect antibodies reactive with the HGE agent. A titer of 2 80 was considered positive. One hundred and eighty-one and 89 acute and convalescent samples (96.4%) came from patients exposed in Wisconsin or Minnesota, respectively. Of these 270 samples, 101 samples (37.4%) belonged to category R, 48 (17.8%) to category MS, 46 (17.0%) to category S, and 75 samples (27.8%) to category NA, respectively. Twenty-seven (87.1%) of the patients were from Wisconsin, the remaining four were from Minnesota. Blood smear examination of or IFA serology on acute or convalescent samples from 31 patients (15.3%) were positive, consistent with acute or recent HGE. Of the 31 infected patients, 19 (61.3%) belonged to risk category S, 5 (16.1%) to category MS, 2 (6.5%) to category R, while 5 of the patients could not be assigned to a risk category (NA). Evaluation of infected patients within each risk category showed that 2% (2/101) belonged to category R, 7% (5/75) belonged to category NA, 10% (5/48) belonged to category MS, while 41% (19/46) belonged to risk category S. We therefore conclude that thrombocytopenia and/or leukopenia are important diagnostic aids suggestive of acute HGE when found in patients presenting with compatible signs and symptoms, and should prompt empiric tetracycline therapy while awaiting diagnostic confirmation of IFA or PCR. 219 Micronutrient Profiles in HIV Infected Adults. JH SKURNICK, JD BOGDEN, H BAKER AND DB LOURIA' - University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ Sixty-four HIV-1 infected male and female outpatients enrolled in a longitudinal study of heterosexual couples at risk of HIV-1 infection through sexual contact and 33 seronegative controls were studied. Main outcome measures: Blood concentrations of glutathione and 22 micronutrients, including vitamins and trace metals were analyzed. HIV- infected patients had significantly lower mean circulating levels of magnesium (p &lt;.0001), total carotenes (p= .009), total cholines (p= .002), and glutathione (p=.045), and significantly higher levels of niacin (p &lt;.0001) than seronegative controls. Fifty-nine percent of these patients had low levels of magnesium, compared with 9% of controls (p &lt;.0001). Supplemental vitamin intake was associated with fewer low concentrations of antioxidants (vitamins A, C, E and carotenes); 53% of those HIV- positives not taking vitamins had at least one low plasma antioxidant concentration as did 29% of those taking vitamins. Low magnesium and antioxidant concentrations were unrelated to disease stage. Magnesium deficiency was not related to alcohol use or diarrhea. Higher niacin and biopterin levels were associated with lower CD4 counts. Lower carotene concentrations were associated with lower CD4:CD8 ratios because of higher CD8 counts (as were higher levels of vitamins E and B12 .) Low antioxidant concentrations could play a role in HIV progression. Low magnesium concentrations, the most striking finding, is of particular interest because of experimental data showing that magnesium depletion can produce cardiomyopathy, a macrophage - monocyte related cytokine surge and reduced glutathione production; vitamin E administration can mitigate the severity of the cardiomyopathy. 220 Enterococcus avium Infection. B. BHAGAT*, T. SHAH, K. ROISTACHER, A.E. GLATT. Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens Inc., Jamaica, New York City, NY. Introduction: Enterococci are common pathogens, however Enterococcus avium is a rare cause of human infection. Methods: The charts at two hospitals for all 9 adult patients with proven E. avium infection (8 bacteremia, 1 peritonitis) between January 1992 and June 1994 were reviewed. Results: Seven (78%) patients had polymicrobial bacteremia (gram positive cocci and/or gram negative rods in addition to E. avium). Five (56%) of 9 were nosocomially acquired. Median age was 77 years (range 25 to 93) with 4 men and 5 women. Underlying conditions included intraabdominal diseases(6), renal failure (2), diabetes mellitus (2) and HIV infection (1) . At the time of bacteremia, 8 (89%) patients had temperatures greater than 100? F, and 6(67%) had elevated WBC counts (&gt; 11,000) . Five (56%) had previously received cephalosporins. The source of E. avium was intraabdominal infection in 5; four had no clear localized primary infection. All 6 patients over the age of 60 were bacteremic, and expired despite therapy. All 3 patients under 30 survived. Conclusion: E. avium bacteremia is an important infection, frequently related to intraabdominal disease and prior cephalosporin usage. Patients present with fever and/or elevated WBC. Patients over 60 have a high morbidity and mortality rate, although it is unclear if E. avium is the cause or just a marker of severe illness. 221 Increasing Rates of Invasive Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) in Memphis. R.J. LEGGIADRO,* Y. DAVIS, B. HILL, R.R. FACKLAM and F.C. TENOVER. LeBonheur Children's Medical Center (LBCMC), Memphis, TN, St. Vincent's Medical Center, Staten Island, NY and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA. Invasive DRSP has been monitored at LBCMC, a 225- bed, tertiary care pediatric facility serving the mid-South area, since the first case of DRSP meningitis was identified there in October, 1989. From 1/1/93 to 12/31/94 all S. pneumoniae (Sp) blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sterile body fluid isolates determined to be penicillin resistant (R) (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) &gt; 0.1 /g/ml) were shipped to CDC for MIC confirmation by broth microdilution using Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with lysed horse blood and serotyping with specific antisera by the Danish Quellung reaction. Sp isolates from 18 (15%) of 119 patients (pts) were penicillin (PCN) R in 1993. 7 (6%) demonstrated high-level (H- L) (MIC &gt; 1.0 /g/ml) PCN resistance and 13 (11%) were cefotaxime (CTX) R (MIC &gt; 1.0 ag/ml); 9 (8%) had CTX MICs &gt; 2 /ag/ml (H-L R). 15 were serotyped: 23F (7), 6B (4), 19A (3) and 14(1). The rate of PCN resistance increased to 24% (isolates from 27 of 110 pts) in 1994. 8 (7%) strains were H-L R and 12 (11%) were CTX R, including 10 (9%) with H-L CTX resistance. 5 (38%) of 13 CSF isolates were PCN R and 2 (15%) CTX R. 26 were serotyped: 23F (10), 19A (4), 6B (4), 14 (3), 9V (3), 19F (1) and 6A(1). The continued rise of DRSP disease in Memphis represents a major microbial threat which warrants further study.</page><page sequence="39">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 757 222 An outbreak of co-trimoxazole resistant Shigella in Brooklyn, NY. Hakim A*, Calderon J, Alba-Sedutto L, Protic J. Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY. Large clusters of bacillary dysentery develop annually in the neighborhood served by our institution. Co-trimoxazole (TMP/SXT) is prescribed for therapy because of high incidence of resistance to ampicillin. Resistance to TMP/SXT is low in Shigella strains isolated from patients in this community. We collected Shigella isolates during an outbreak in 1994 summer from our clinical laboratory and from private microbiology laboratories. Family clusters of infected children and adults were noted. Twenty six (26) isolates were identified as Shigella sonnei and were resistant to TMP/SXT. We examined their susceptibility patterns to 25 different antibiotics. All isolates were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam, imipenem, cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Nine isolates tested against nalidixic acid were susceptible. Tracking of susceptibility patterns of Shigella strains is important for both clinical and epidemiological reasons. We recommend: (1) using nalidixic acid or nitrofurantoin if required to treat gastroenteritis caused by TMP/SXT-resistant strains, and (2) avoiding use of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones to reduce the emergence of resistance in Shigella and other bacteria. Hygiene education is the mainstay of prevention. 223 Streptococcus pneumoniae: Trends at an urban hospital. Hakim A. Maimonides Medical Center (MMC), Brooklyn, N.Y. Until recently, MMC had a low incidence of penicillin-intermediate-resistance pneumococci (PIRP), unlike 'some institutions in NYC and in the Midwest and the South. The rate of PRP increased from 5% in 1992 to 15% in 1993. Our latest figures show a rate of 30% among isolates from all body sites. PRP accounted for 37% of blood isolates and 17.6% of respiratory isolates. The 1994/95 winter season marked the isolation of strains with high level resistance to penicillin (PHRP) which accounted for 1/3 of blood and respiratory isolates. Twelve isolates were confirmed as PRP by the E test between 10/94 and 2/95. The sources of these isolates included blood, sputum, middle ear fluid and pleural fluid. Four of these were PHRP. Ten isolates were tested for cefotaxime susceptibility by the E test. Seven were resistant: 4 had intermediate and 3 had high level resistance to cefotaxime. Seven adults and five children were infected by PRP. Age less than 3 years was statistically related to the isolation of PHRP (P &lt; 0.03, X2). The incidence of PRP had risen 6-fold in 3 years at MMC. Vancomycin is the therapy of choice for PHRP infections and its usage will escalate. The use of vancomycin should be controlled, and resistance patterns of PRP and other gram positive cocci should be carefully monitored. 224 Fever in Patients with Acute Stroke A PLOMARI- TOGLOU, K. VEMMOS, Y. BASSIAKOS, F. TRIGAZI, K GEORGILIS* University of Athens School of Medicine, "Alexandra" Hospital, Athens, Greece, and National School of Public Health, Athens, Greece Fever is common in patients with acute stroke and most of the times is due to infection. However, a focus of infection often cannot be found, and fever does not respond to empiric antibiotic treatment. A retrospec- tive review was undertaken in an attempt to define characteristics of pa- tients with acute stroke and fever with no apparent focus of infection The medical records of 311 patients hospitalized for acute stroke from June 1992 until July 1994 were examined. Fever was noted in 41.7% and documented infection (DI) in 26.1% of the patients. Fever without Dl (FWDI) was noted in 16.2% of the patients. Compared to cerebral in- farction, intracerebral hemorrhage was significantly associated with both DI and FWDI (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.002, resp.). The presence of DI and FWDI were both strongly associated with the presence of mass effect (p-0 and p~0, resp.), transtentorial hemiation (p&lt;0.00007 and p&lt;0.0002, resp.), intraventricular blood (p&lt;0.002 and p&lt;0.005, resp.), but not with hemorrhagic transformation (p&gt;0.18 and p&gt;O. 11, resp.). Patients with DI and with FWDI had lower scores on admission in Glascow Coma Scale (p&lt;0.004 and p&lt;0.0001, resp.) and in Scandinavian Stroke Scale (p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001, resp.). Patients with DI had a risk factor for infection (p&lt;0.04) in contrast to patients with FWDI (p&gt;0.63). Older age was associated with FWDI (p&lt;0.03), but not with DI (p&gt;0.68). Anti- biotic treatment had no effect on the resolution of fever in patients with FWDI (p&gt;0.3). In conclusion, patients with acute stroke often develop fever with no focus of infection. These patients are older, suffer severe stroke, their fever is not associated with risk factors for infection, and antibiotic treatment has no effect on the resolution of fever. These find- ings support the hypothesis of fever related to central nervous system le- sion in patients with acute stroke. 225 7-Year Epidemiologic Review of Tuberculosis in St. Louis. P.B. LECUYER,* S.M. SEILER, V.J.FRASER. Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Recent series of tuberculosis (TB) describe patients in high-risk areas with frequent HIV coinfection. To define TB epidemiology in a low-intermediate TB/HIV prevalence area, we reviewed records of all patients with (+) TB cultures from 1/88-12/94 at Barnes (BH, 1000-bed tertiary facility) &amp; Jewish Hospitals (JH, 500-bed community facility). There were 98 patients (77 from the metropolitan area) with 12.9 cases/year at BH &amp; 4.1 cases/year at JH. Patients presented to medicine (67), thoracic surgery ( 1), &amp; 7 other services (20); most (87.8%) were admitted for evaluation. The mean age was 56.7 years (range, 15-95) with 56.1% male &amp; 62.2% non-Caucasian. Caucasians were more commonly &gt; 65 years old (22/37 vs 19/61, p=.004). Risk factors included alcoholism (27.6%), diabetes (14.3%), immunosuppression (13.3%), foreign-birth (13.3%), malnutrition (11.2%), renal insufficiency (8.2%), &amp; AIDS (8.2%). Prior TB infection was recognized in 38.5%, close contact with active TB in 33.9%, &amp; recent tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion in 22.7%. TST conversions were more common in alcoholics (6/10 vs 4/34, p=.004) &amp; IVDA (2/2 vs 8/42, p=.048). TST was performed in 75; 25.3% were anergic, &amp; 83.9% ofnon-anergics were TST (+). Pulmonary TB was identified in 71/98: isolated pulmonary (34/71) &amp; with miliary disease (15/71), pleurisy (14/71), adenitis (7/71), &amp; meningitis (1/71). Pulmonary TB was more common in alcoholics (24/27 vs 46/70, p=.042), &amp; apical cavitary disease was more common with active TB contacts (5/7 vs 16/55, p=.039). Extrapulmonary TB without pulmonary disease was identified in 27/98: adenitis (10/27), meningitis (4/27), miliary (3/27), pleurisy (2/27), MSK (2/27), GU (2/27), &amp; other (4/27). Extrapulmonary TB with/without pulmonary disease was more common with renal insufficiency (8/8 vs 55/89, p=.047), &amp; extrapulmonary TB without pulmonary disease was more common in females (17/43 vs 10/55, p=.033). There were 22 smear (+) &amp; 44 culture (+) pulmonary cases, including 6 without CXR infiltrates (4 with AIDS, I foreign-born with OGD, &amp; I pregnant female). Drug resistance was identified in 15.8% (INH alone 8.4%, MDR 4.2%). Planned treatment was completed in 70.9% (mean 10.6 months, range 6-32 months). There were 33 deaths, with 12 deaths due to TB. Death from TB was associated with older age (76.6 years vs 54.7 years, p&lt;.001) &amp; malnutrition (5/10 vs 7/72, p=.005). We identified TB in more elderly Caucasians &amp; with less AIDS coinfection, greater anergy, &amp; more extrapulmonary disease than other recent series. Resistance was common, thus a 4-drug regimen is appropriate initial therapy in this area. Prompt recognition of local TB risk factors may facilitate rapid diagnosis &amp; treatment with less morbidity &amp; mortality. 226 Clinical characteristics of Chlamydia pnewnoniae pneumonia (CP) based on serology: Four-fold rise (4FR) vs single IgG titer. TM FILE Jr*, JF PLOUFFE, RF BREIMAN, KW WONG, S SKELTON and the Community-Based Pneumonia Incidence Study (CBPIS) Group. Summa Health System, Akron, OH; Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. The serologic diagnosis of CP has been defined as either a 4FR in IgG or IgM to = 1:16; an IgM = 1:16; or a single IgG (SG) = 1:512. Since a large percent of the population have IgG antibodies for C. pneumoniae, the diagnosis of CP based on SG may be unreliable. In an ongoing evaluation, we have analyzed data from persons with community acquired pneumonia who required hospitalization and were enrolled in a large community based, prospective pneumonia incidence study in Ohio. We compared clinical characteristics of patients with 4FR (n=38;4FR of IgM = 16 and IgG = 22) with those with SG (n = 69). Patients with 4FR were younger (mean age 56.5 vs 65, p = .02) and more likely to have nausea (Odds Ratio [OR], 95% Confidence Interval: 4.6, 1.9 - 11.1), ear pain (OR 3.2, 1.2 - 9.0), chills (OR 3.52, 1.4 - 8.8), myalgia (OR 2.7, 1.2 - 6.2), and sputum production (OR 3.1, 1.2 - 7.8). SG cases had more wheezing on exam (OR 7.4, 1.6 - 33.87). In conclusion, there are differences in the clinical characteristics of the two groups and SG may not always reflect acute infection. 227 Evaluation of Tuberculosis (TB) Control Policies using a Semi-Markov Model. T.F. BREWER*,t S.J. HEYMANN,tS G.A. COLDITZ,tt M.E. WILSON,tf K. AUERBACH,$ D. KANE,S H.V. FINEBERG.t From tHarvard Medical School; tHarvard School of Public Health; SKennedy School of Government, Harvard University. The increase in TB since 1985 has necessitated a reexamination of control policies in U.S. This study uses a computer simulation model to compare control measures on morbidity and mortality from TB in the U.S. The general population is divided into 18 Markov states based on TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. TB status is based on the risk for or presence of active disease. The HIV status includes HIV seronegative, HIV seropositive, and AIDS. Outcomes include the projected number of: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tbc) infections, cases of active TB, and deaths and are reported separately for HIV infected and uninfected populations. All percent changes are relative to outcomes predicted by the model in the absence of the intervention. A 10% increase in the rate that persons with TB enter treatment decreases projected drug sensitive TB (DSTB) cases among non-HIV infected persons by 28%. However, projected multiple drug resistant TB (DRTB) cases increase regardless of HIV status, with a 60% to 70% increase after 10 years compared with no intervention. In contrast, increasing the efficacy of treatment by 10% leads to declines in TB cases and deaths in all groups, though with larger relative decreases among those with DRTB and/or AIDS. Increasing the rate of isoniazid (INH) chemoprophylaxis by 10% reduces TB cases and deaths among those with HIV/AIDS after ten years (13% decline in DSTB cases, 20% in DRTB cases and 18% in TB deaths) with little predicted change in non-HIV infected cases. Increasing the efficacy of INH chemoprophylaxis has minimal impact on TB cases or deaths even after ten years. Vaccinating 10% of the tuberculin negative, HIV uninfected population with BCG reduces projected TB cases and deaths by 24% to 61% for all groups over ten years. A combination of all of the previous interventions reduces DSTB cases by 59% over ten years, DRTB cases by 49%, and TB deaths by 54%.</page><page sequence="40">758 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 228 Concordance in the Interpretation of Pediatric Chest Radiographs for Tuberculosis. WF POMPUTIUS*, EJ CARTER, PH DENNEHY, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children is complex, requiring consideration of family epidemiology, PPD, clinical presentation, and radiographic findings. Often the chest radiograph (CXR) alone prompts hospitalization for invasive evaluation, i.e. gastric aspirates. Given that the CXR is often interpreted by non- pediatric physicians, this study was designed to look at variability of pediatric CXR interpretation among different specialists. 60 CXRs of children &lt; 6 were read with no clinical history by 2 pediatric radiologists (PR), 2 adult radiologists (AR), and 2 experienced TB physicians (CL). The CXRs were obtained from 20 cases of confirmed TB, 20 children with positive PPD only, and 20 children evaluated for cough in an ED. Answers were obtained by questionnaire in a binary format (normal or abnormal; if abnormal, related to TB or not). The Kappa statistic (K) was employed to determine concordance (C), i.e. strength of agreement, substantial C being represented by K &gt; .60, poor C by K &lt; zero. In determination of whether a CXR was abnormal, C was moderate to substantial between each group (PR vs CL, K range .40-.62; AR vs CL, K range .41-.64; PR vs AR, K range .59-.79). In determination of whether the abnormality was related to TB, C was poor to fair (PR vs CL, K range .11-.31, AR vs CL, K range .09-.45; PR vs AR, K range minus .02-.39). Although AR and PR achieved the greatest agreement on whether a CXR was abnormal, they were as likely to disagree with each other as they were with CL on whether the abnormality was related to TB. Paradoxically intragroup C on abnormalities as related to TB was greatest between the two non-radiologists (CL). We conclude that a second opinion by a radiologist, either pediatric or adult, is of value in identifying a CXR as abnormal in a child; however, interpretation of whether the abnormality is related to TB appears much more variable and thus plays a less prominent role in this specific diagnosis. 229 Atovaquone for Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia Prophylaxis in HIV-1 Infected Children. V PAPAEVANGELOU*, H POLLACK, A KAUL, M RIGAUD, K KRASINSKI, W BORKOWSKY NYU Medical Center/Bellevue Hospital, NY, NY. Atovaquone has been approved for the treatment of mild to moderate Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia PCP) in HIV-1 infected adults. Its effectiveness for the treatment and prophylaxis of PCP in HIV-1 infected children is currently under investigation. We report our experience using atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis in 9 HIV-1 infected children 6mo-15y (median lly), at risk for PCP. Trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole was discontinued because of systemic allergic reaction in 6 and severe neutropenia in 3 children. Patients were given atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis for 2-18 mos (median 6mos). Using the 250mg tablet formulation, children were prescribed 15-35 mg/kg/day given once to twice daily, depending on their body weight. Patients were instructed to take atovaquone with food high in lipids for better bioavailability. Atovaquone was well tolerated and was discontinued secondary to increased liver enzymes, only in one patient with chronic active HBV infection . There were two failures with development of PCP documented by bronchioalveolar lavage: in a 4 y. girl who was on 35mg/kg/day of atovaquone divided twice a day for 6 months and a 11 y. girl who was on 25mg/kg/day divided twice a day for 9 months. Plasma levels of atovaquone could indicate whether failure was secondary to poor bioavailability. Higher plasma levels achieved by the liquid formulation may improve the bioavailability and efficacy of atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis. Until more information is available, atovaquone should be used with caution for the prophylaxis of PCP and only in HIV-1 infected children who cannot tolerate conventional regimens. 230 Rates of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) in Gay Men in the AIDS Era, 1987-1994. SP DIAS, JM DOUGLAS*, and FN JUDSON. Denver Public Health, Denver, CO. To assess the relative prevalence of STD among gay men during the AIDS era, we reviewed the new visit records of 9299 gay men attending an urban STD clinic from 1987 to 1994. Of all new visits, an STD was diagnosed in 4417 visits (47.5%), including nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in 1401 (15.1%), genital warts in 920 (9.9/%), gonorrhea (GC) in 761 (8.2%), with early syphilis, genital herpes (first episode (IstHSV), recurrent herpes (RecHSV)), molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and pediculosis in less than or equal to 3% each. Visits and diagnoses were stratified by HIV serostatus, with 1858 patients (20.0%) classified as HIV+ (1426, 15.3%, previously known HIV+ and 432, 4.6%, newly diagnosed HIV+), 2993 patients (32.2%) as HIV-, and 4448 patients (47.8%) as of unknown serostaus. Prevalence of infection (%/) by HIV serostatus in 9299 gay men was: % STD GC Syphilis Scabies Pediculosis HIV+ 55.9 9.4 1.2 2.4 1.8 HIV- 42.9 6.3 .3 1.8 3.8 % NGU Warts lstHSV RecHSV Molluscum HIV+ 12.2 14.5 1.7 2.4 2.4 HIV- 15.8 9.2 1.3 .8 1.5 HIV+ gay men were significantly more likely to be infected with any STD (p&lt;.001), as well as GC (p&lt;.001), early syphilis (p&lt;.001), warts (p&lt;.001), RecHSV (p&lt;.001), and molluscum (p=.04), but were less likely to be diagnosed with NGU (p&lt;001) or pediculosis (p=.002). Of 761 cases of GC, 23.0% occurred in HIV+ men (with 15.4% in men who knew they were HIV+), 25.0% in HIV- men, and the remaining 52.0% in men with unknown serostatus. Of 75 cases of early syphilis, 29%! occurred in HIV+ men (with 16.8% in men who knew they were HIV+), 15.9% in HIV- men, and 55.1% in men with unknown serostatus. The prevalence of STD and the high proportion of incident STD, GC and syphilis, in a small group of HIV+ gay men suggests that while many gay men have adopted safer sex practices, a minority continue to engage in behavior which could potentially result in the transmission of HIV and points to the ongoing need for focused HIV risk reduction programs. 231 National Registry for Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Diseases: Trends and Goals. M.N. HACKLEY1*, S. OSTROFF2, J.L. COOK1. 1 National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO. 2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. The National Registry for Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Diseases was established to evaluate the apparent increase in nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary infections in HIV-negative patients. Because reporting is rarely required under public health regulations, reliable epidemiological data are not available. To address this problem, a toll-free NTM Registry number (1-800-551-1NTM) has been used since 1/1/93 to collect data on demographics, diagnosis, and medical and treatment history. Through 3/31/95, 262 HIV-negative patients with NTM infection which fulfills diagnostic criteria for NTM disease have been enrolled from 43 states and Alberta, Canada. 117 (68%) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 64 years (range 3-90); males were diagnosed at a younger age than females (males 58.9+1.7, females 63.5?1.1, p=0.02). The median time from illness onset to diagnosis was 7 months (range &lt;1 month-38 years); in 25% of evaluated patients the time to diagnosis exceeded 2 years. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the most commonly isolated NTM (208/79%) followed by M. kansasii (20/8%) and M. chelonae (18/7%). The most frequently reported symptoms were productive cough (62%), fatigue (56%), weight loss (46%) and dyspnea (43%). 65% of patients had one or more pre- existing pulmonary diseases, the most common being COPD (32%), bronchiectasis (26%), and recurrent pneumonia (25%). 34% had no known antecedent pulmonary diagnosis (65% of these were female), 47% were never smokers and only 15% had received any form of immunosuppression. Multi- drug regimens were prescribed in 189 (72%) patients at the time of diagnosis, whereas 8 (3%) patients received single drug therapy and 33 (13%) received no therapy. The most frequently prescribed agents were ethambutol (55%), clarithromycin (52%) and rifampin (50%). Future goals of the NTM Registry are to (1) increase national case enrollment, (2) define sites for case incidence analysis, (3) provide a basis for a case definition consensus, (4) generate hypotheses on etiology and risk factors for epidemiological testing and (5) develop a database for intervention and outcome studies. 232 Medical Risks and Problems Related to International Travel. M.A. ABRAMSON*, I.Z. ABOLNIK, J. TYSMANS, G.R. COREY, D.J. SEXTON. Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. Using a prospective cohort of all patients evaluated between August 1994 and February 1995 at the Duke Travel Clinic, we describe the incidence of travel-related medical problems and the relative risk associated with travel to Africa, Asia, Central America, South America, and Eastern Europe. Prior to departure, every patient who sought a travel evaluation (290 patients) completed a questionnaire; 10-14 weeks after return to the U.S., contact was made via post (up to 2 attempts) and/or by telephone (up to 3 attempts). 170 of 290 returned travelers (58.6%) were successfully contacted. Of those individuals who reported no travel-related medical problem, the average age was 50.9 +14.3 years; 46.6% were males. Of those individuals who reported at least one travel-related medical problem, the average age was 37.0 +14.3 years; 57.3% were males. Symptom or Disease cases/170 (%) per 1000 days of travel diarrhea without fever 60 (35.3) 30.7 days vomiting or abdominal cramps 31 (18.2) 11.0 days fever (&gt;100?F) 22 (12.9) 6.1 days skin rash 21(12.4) 17.8 days diarrhea with fever 13 (7.7) 6.5 days upper respiratory infection 13 (7.7) 2.0 cases malaria (all cases from Africa) 4 (2.4) 0.63 cases giardiasis 3 (1.8) 0.47 cases amebiasis 3 (1.8) 0.47 cases intestinal worms 1 (0.6) 0.16 cases Thirteen of 170 patients (7.7%) sought medical attention while abroad. For travelers to Africa, the relative risk (RR) of having at least one travel-related medical problem was 1.4 (95%CI 1.0-2.0, p=0.05); travelers to eastern Europe possessed a RR of having at least one travel-related medical problem of 0.32 (95%CI 0.15-0.68, p=0.003). 233 Diarrhea and Quality of Life in Ambulatory HIV-Infected Patients. D.A. WATSON*, M.H. SAMORE, and C.A. WANKE. N. E. Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Objective. Diarrhea is common in HIV infection but may be underreported. This study has 3 aims: (1) to categorize and define diarrhea in this population; (2) to determine the prevalence of such categories; (3) to use quality-of-life score (QLS) as an outcome measure. Subjects. 169 patients (141 males, 28 females) were randomly selected from the HIV/AIDS clinic of a tertiary referral hospital. Patients were 70% homo/bisexual males, 89% white, 57% CD4&lt;200, and 75% taking antiretroviral therapy. Method. This is a cross-sectional study whereby subjects were interviewed by one physician (DAW) about HIV-related symptoms then administered the 20-item MOS Short Form General Health Survey. Results. Symptoms of diarrhea were categorized by responses to 2 pairs of questions: (Al) In response to an open question, self-reported diarrhea (SRD) in the previous month in 33 patients (20%); (A2) An affirmative response to a question about loose or watery stools (LWS) in the previous month in 89 patients (53%); (Bl) An affirmative response to "diarrhea" during questions covering general HIV-related symptoms in the previous week in 49 patients (29%); (B2) An affirmative response to a question about LWS in the previous week in 68 patients (40%). 52% of patients with CD4 &gt;=200 and 53% with CD4&lt;200 had LWS in the previous month. Symptoms of diarrhea correlated with lower QLS regardless of response type (p values &lt;0.05). QLS inversely correlated with number of LWS/day (p=0.01) and LWS days/month (p=0.0001). Patients in Category B 1 had lower QLS when adjusted for total number of specific HIV-related symptoms (p&lt;0.0001). Symptoms associated with diarrhea that correlated with lower QLS included incontinence (p&lt;0.05), rectal pain (p&lt;0.001), and nocturnal diarrhea (p&lt;0.001). 32 patients (19%) had chronic diarrhea (CD) by CDC definition. 11 of these (34%) had CD4&gt;=200. Only 9 (28%) had a known enteric opportunistic infection. Although these patients met CDC definition, only 17 (53%/) SRD. Patients with CD, including those who did not SRD, had lower QLS than those without CD (p&lt;0.005, p=0.08, respectively). Conclusions. Diarrhea in all stages of HIV infection may be better elucidated by specific questioning that minimizes individual interpretations of the term "diarrhea". Such questioning reveals that diarrhea is highly prevalent in this population and strongly associated with diminished quality of life.</page><page sequence="41">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 759 234 Detection of Varicella-Zoster Virus DNA by PCR in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Immunocompetent Children with Neurological Complications of Herpes Zoster. B. J. Freij,* D. L. Wiedbrauk, and A. M. Drevon. William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan. Neurological complications of herpes zoster (HZ) are uncommon in immunocompetent children and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures are usually unrewarding. Two otherwise healthy children (MT, KR) developed neurological symptoms several days after the appearance of HZ. MT was a 6-year-old boy who developed encephalitis on day 4 of HZ (C8-T2 dermatomes). He also had right axillary lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and a few disseminated cutaneous vesicular lesions. CSF analysis revealed: WBC 28/pL (99% mononuclear cells), protein 35 mg/dL, and glucose 64 mg/dL. KR was a 1 0-year-old girl with HZ (T7-T8 dermatomes) who developed headache, photophobia, and neck stiffness on day 5. She had no disseminated cutaneous lesions. CSF analysis revealed: WBC 156/pL (95% mononuclear cells), protein 56 mg/dL, and glucose 67 mg/dL. CSF from both children was culture negative for varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Serum, CSF, and lesion specimens were extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloro- form:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Serum specimens were digested with proteinase K for 1 hour at 56?C before extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed using oligonucleotide primers that flank a 240 bp region of VZV gene 29. MT had VZV DNA in serum, CSF, and lesion (vesicle) specimens. KR had VZV DNA in CSF alone; serum and scrapings from her crusted lesions were negative by PCR. Conclusion: PCR can detect VZV DNA in the CSF of immunocompetent children with HZ-associated encephalitis or meningitis despite negative culture results. PCR testing can help elucidate the etiology of HZ-associated neurological complications. 235 EVALUATION OF THE SYPHILIS IgM CAPTURE EIA IN PREGNANT WONEN. J. AKHRAS, M.P. REYES,* and J. IERLINE. Wayne State University, Detroit, MI. The resurgence of congenital syphilis in the US has led to increased maternal screening and treatment of women during pregnancy. This study was conducted to evaluate the presence of IgN antibodies to T.pallidum in pregnant women with treated or untreated syphilis, using the CAPTIA Syphilis IgM test. Eighty RPR positive, FTA-ABS positive maternal sera were randomly selected for IgN testing from 1/1-12/31/94. A retrospective chart study was done by a blinded investigator to review symptomatology, staging, and treatment history for syphilis in parturients. Maternal ages were 17-41 years; 74/80 were black; 46/80 were IVDA; 1/80 was HIV positive. 11 of 80 women had IgM antibodies; 6/11 had primary syphilis [genital lesions or no documented treatment history]; RPR titers were 1:16-1:256 in 5 and 1:1 in 1. 3/11 were treated within 1-3 months and had no lesions. RPR titers were 1:2, 1:16 and 1:128. 2/11 were treated 3 &amp; 20 years ago [reinfection]; RPR titers were 1:64 and 1:128. 63/80 women had negative IgM titers; 2/63 had primary syphilis; 3/63 had reinfection [&gt; 4 fold rise in RPR titer]; 58/63 had old infections [&lt; 2 fold rise in RPR titer]. 6/80 women had equivocal IgM titers. In summary, CAPTIA Syphilis IgM was positive in 11/13 (84.6%) of parturients with new or recent infections. Reinfection did not always show a rise in IgM titers. 236 The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis (TB) at an Inner-City Hospital, 1991-1994. HM BLUMBERG*, LP MILLER, N BOCK, M SOTI, P MOORE, A VERNON, B METCHOCK, JE MCGOWAN, JR. Emory University School of Medicine, Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), and CDC, Atlanta, Georgia. The incidence of TB has increased in urban areas in the late 1980s and early 1990s and many patients with TB are cared for at public hospitals. We examined the epidemiology of TB at GMH, a public hospital in the city of Atlanta which in 1991 and 1992 had the highest incidence of TB in the nation. During the 4 year period from 1991 to 1994, there were 961 admissions to GMH by 856 patients during which time the patient had a positive culture for M. tuberculosis. HIV-infection was common among those with laboratory confirmed disease; 42% were HIV-seropositive, 41% were HIV seronegative and 17% refused or were not offered HIV testing. There was no significant increase in the proportion of patients who were HIV-infected over the four year period. The mean age of patients with TB was 40 years and 78% of patients were between the ages of 18-49; 22 (2.6%) patients were &lt;18 years old. 74% of the patients were male and 26% were female. The overwhelming majority of patients with TB were members of minority groups (88% black, 7% white, 5% other race/ethnicity). Of 961 isolates, 882 (91.7%) were susceptible to all standard antituberculosis drugs, 39 (4.1%) were resistant to INH alone, 18 (1.9%) were resistant to rifampin (RIF) alone, 14 (1.5%) were multidrug resistant (MDR) to INH and RIF, and 8 (0.8%) were MDR but not to both INH and RIF. Patients with drug resistant isolates were more commonly HIV-infected than those with susceptible isolates but the difference did not reach statistical significance (38/60 [63%] vs. of 323/647 150%], P=0.06). However, single drug resistance due to rifampin was strongly associated with HIV infection (P&lt;0.01); 13 (87%) of 15 patients with isolated RIF resistance were HIV-infected. Isolates from 9 patients with isolated RIF resistance were available for further study; each had a unique IS6110 RFLP pattern. In summary, our inner-city hospital cared for large numbers of patients with TB over a 4 year period; if GMH were a state, it would rank 27th in the number of TB cases reported over this period. HIV co-infection was common, occurring in approximately half of the cases reported. The presence of isolated RIF resistance was associated with HIV infection and RFLP analysis indicated the emergence of RIF resistance among multiple strains rather than transmission of a single resistant clone. Finally, despite a high incidence of TB and HIV co-infection among patients cared for at our institution, MDR-TB was relatively uncommon. 237 Utility of Tuberculin Skin Testing (TST) of Patients with Low Risk of Nosocomial Tuberculosis (TB) Exposure. NN BOCK*, JE MCGOWAN, Jr., P MOORE, HM BLUMBERG. Emory University School of Medicine and Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, GA. The resurgence of TB in the United States has been accompanied by nosocomial transmission of TB, usually from patient to patient or to health care provider (HCP). In the fall of 1992, two HCPs (one from the ER and one from an outpatient clinic [OC]) at a large inner city public hospital were diagnosed with AFB smear positive pulmonary TB. At the time of diagnosis each reported a productive cough of 2 to 4 weeks duration. Contact tracing was initiated with household members and hospital employees who were potentially exposed to the two HCPs. For the ER HCP a household contact developed active TB; 3 (1.5%) of 192 potentially exposed ER HCPs had a recent TST conversion. None of the 45 exposed HCPs in the OC had a TST conversion. All patients who had been in the ER or OC while the two HCPs worked during the six weeks prior to their diagnoses were asked to return to the hospital for TST screening. Patients were notified of the potential exposure by a press conference covered by local media and by letters sent to their homes. 471 (29%) patients came to the clinic in response to 1627 letters. 278 (59%) had never had previous TST. The median age of the 471 patients was 36 years with a range from 13 to 90. 93% were African American; 79% were female. 435 patients received TSTs of whom 340 (78%) returned for reading. Of these, 79 (23%) had a positive TST. No patient had active TB. All 79 were offered INH preventive therapy (PT); 60 (76%) patients agreed to take it. 150 (26%) of 576 ambulatory patients from the same hospital who were age, gender, and race matched controls who were not in the same clinics as the HCPs with active disease had a positive TST. In summary, there appeared to be little likelihood of TB transmission to patients with limited outpatient exposure to HCPs with active TB. Coworkers were much less likely to be TST positive than patients (P&lt;.001) despite their having had greater exposure than the patients to the HCPs with active TB, and there was no difference in positive TST rates between exposed and non-exposed patients. Evidence of transmission to close contacts such as family members and HCPs should be assessed prior to determining whether patients need to be called back. In addition, TST screening of patients using inner city hospital outpatient clinics revealed a high rate of TB infection in high risk persons, most of whom had never been previously tested. 238 The Etiology of Nongonococcal Urethritis. P.C. LACKEY*, D.M. ENNIS, G.H. CASSELL, R.J. WHITLEY, E.W. HOOK, III. University of Alahama at Birmingham and Jefferson County Department of Health, Birmingham, AL. The etiology of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) has not been comprehensively studied for almost 20 years despite data that shifts in the syndrome's causative agents msay be occurring. In an ongoing study, we have microbiologically and clinically evaluated 190 randomly selected males attending the Jefferson County Health Department STD Clinic for urethritis. Intraurethral swab and/or urine specimens were cultured for N. gonorrhoeae (GC), C trachomatis (CT), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, and T. vaginalis. Patients were also tested for CT and M. genitalium using polymerase chain reaction. Sixty-four subjects were diagnosed with gonococcal urethritis by Gram's stain of the urethral swab and were excluded from analysis. Sixty-four patients had NGU (2 5 PMN's per oil immnersion field on Gram's stain) and 62 had no urethritis. The median age of patients with NGU was 28 compared to 32 in the no urethritis group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age at first intercourse, numbers of lifetime sexual partners, or circumcision status. However, NGU patients were significantly more likely to have had urethritis in the past than those in the no urethritis group (72% vs. 53%, p = 0.03). CT was identified in 13 men (20%) with NGU and in 2 (3%) without urethritis. GC was found in 2 (4%) men with NGU and in none of those without urethritis. U. urealyticum was isolated from 31 (50%) men without urethritis and from 30 (47%) with NGU. M. genitaliumn was nearly twice as common in men with NGU as in men without urethritis (32% vs. 18%, p =0.09). HSV and T. vaginalis were cultured only from men with NGU (3 (5%) and 2 (3%) respectively) who give a history of prior episodes of urethritis. Of men with NGU, I (2%) had GC as the only isolated agent, 2 (3%) had HSV-2 as the only cause, 1 (2%) had T. vaginalis as the only agent, and 20 (31%) had no identifiable cause. All of the patients with positive cultures for HSV, GC, and T. vaginalis have NGU. Our data suggest itat: 1) CT may cause less than the often quoted 40% of NGU; 2) U. urealyticumn does not appear to be a cause of NGU; 3) Urethral shedding of HSV and T. vaginalis is very rare in the absence of urethrits and appears most common inl men with recurrent urethritis; and 4) the microbial etiology of NGU remains unclear in the majority of patients despite careful microbiologic evaluation. 239 Prospective Evaluation of Skin Test for Tuberculosis (PPD) in Patients with Head/Neck or Lung Malignancy. P.H. CHANDRASEKAR*, E. THOMPSON, C. SIVAN, M. KRAUT. Harper Hospital, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Ml. Epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) in the U.S. warrants close scrutiny of populations at high risk. Among all solid tumors, those involving head/neck and lung are most closely associated with TB; in patients with such malignancies, issues involving TB have not been adequately addressed. In an ongoing prospective study of patients with newly diagnosed head/neck or lung cancer, 48 patients (22 with head/neck and 26 with lung tumors; 29 men and 19 women; mean age 59 years) were enrolled. History of smoking (&gt; 90% pts.) and ethanolism (60% pts.) was common. Prior exposure to TB was present in 21 patients. Thirty-eight pts (79%) reported prior PPD testing with result positive in 3, negative in 23 and unknown in 12. Two of the 3 PPD (+) pts had completed isoniazid prophylaxis. For the present study, intermediate strength PPD and controls (mumps, candida) were used. All received their skin tests after 0 to 3 courses of cancer chemotherapy ? radiation. Eight of the 48 pts were PPD(+) (17%) and 33 were PPD (-). Anergy was seen in 7 pts. Of the 8 PPD (+) pts, prior skin testing was (+) in 3, (-) in 4 and unknown in 1. Four of 8 PPD (+) pts were advised isoniazid prophylaxis. Mean length of follow up was 93 days. Isoniazid was well tolerated; none of the 48 pts developed active TB. Four pts died. Prior exposure to TB and prior PPD testing were common in patients with head/neck or lung cancer. Thus, a history regarding PPD and TB is useful in risk assessment. Reactivity to skin tests was retained even after initiating cancer therapy. A minor, but significant, proportion of patients were PPD (+), thus underscoring utility of the skin test for consideration of prophylaxis during cancer therapy.</page><page sequence="42">760 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 240 Challenges in Diagnosis of Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis (EPTB) in Non-HIV Infected Patients: the Experience of a Tertiary Care Facility. A KELLEHER*, S GORDON, D LONGWORTH, A ARROLIGA, G HALL, W TOMFORD. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), Cleveland, Ohio. To determine the incidence of EPTB in our institution, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients (pts) diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) from January 1990 through December 1994. A case of TB was defined as either microbiologic (culture positive for MTB) or presumptive (histopathologic evidence ofcaseating granuloma with a reactive tuberculin skin test). 50 pts with TB were identified; 30 inpts (2 per 10,000 inpt discharges) and 20 outpts (8 per million outpt visits). 28 cases (56%) were pulmonary (including 4 cases with concurrent EPTB) and 22 cases (44%) were EPTB (4 presumptive). Only 2 of the 50 pts were infected with HIV; both had concurrent pulmonary and EPTB. The most common sites of EPTB were lymphatic [7]; pleural [6]; bone/joint, genitourinary, soft tissue [2 each]; peritoneal, brain, and meningeal [1 each]. The onset of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 4 months with EPTB compared with 3 months with pulmonary TB. Univariate analysis showed that pts with EPTB were less likely to be African-American, and less likely to have cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, and weight loss compared with pts with pulmonary TB (p &lt;0.05). 38% of EPTB cases had chest radiographs suggestive of TB compared with 75% of pulmonary TB cases (p &lt;0.05). TB was considered by clinicians in the initial diagnosis in only 46% of EPTB cases and 68% of pulmonary TB cases (p= 0.1). The median interval from specimen collection to final identification of MTB was 20 days; no isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. We conclude that although the incidence of TB among pts treated at CCF is low, EPTB remains an important and challenging infectious disease problem, accounting for 44% of all new cases of active TB infection identified. Ongoing physician education regarding clinical manifestations of EPTB is essential, so as to assure prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy. 241 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Bacteremia in HIV Positive Patients. AJ WEINMANN, TS LUNDSTROM* Wayne State University, Detroit, MI Pseudomonal infections have been reported with increasing frequency among HIV positive patients. We reviewed microbiologic records in a 600 bed tertiary care facility to identify cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia (PaB) from April 1, 1989 to December 31, 1994. Of two hundred thirty-seven patients with PaB, 21 (9%) were HIV seropositive; charts were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included age, sex, HIV risk factor, CD, count, opportunistic infections/malignancies (OI/OM), medications, . clinical presentation, comorbid conditions, nosocomial acquisition, bacteremia duration, polymicrobial bacteremias, recurrence, indwelling central venous catheter (CVC), source, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), treatment/duration, and outcome. Of 21 patients, 5 had a second episode. Ages ranged from 27-52 years (mean 37.7 years); male:female ratio was 2:1. The most common risk factor for HIV acquisition was male-to-male sex (9 pts, 43%). There were 52 prior OI/OM: pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) (10 pts), esophageal candidiasis (8 pts), recurrent herpes simplex (10 pts), and 5 cytomegalovirus retinitis. Five were on hemodialysis. Twenty patients had a CD, count documented within 3 months prior to PaB; 15 were &lt;50/uL, 4 were 51-100/uL, 1 was &gt; 101/uL. In 10 episodes, the source could not be identified. Identified sources included lung (6), CVC (4), and gut (3). Seventeen patients were on antiretroviral therapy. Seventeen patients were on PCP prophylaxis. Septic shock was present in 14 episodes. A minority of patients were neutropenic (ANC&lt;500 k/cumm), on steroids, receiving growth factors, or had polymicrobial bacteremia. Thirteen episodes were community-acquired. In 50% of episodes an indwelling CVC was present. In 17/26 episodes PaB duration was one day. Fifty-four percent (14) of the episodes were fatal. All three autopsied patients had Pa infection on post mortem. Unlike previous reports in HIV positive patients most of our patients presented in septic shock. Although 50% of episodes were associated with the presence of an indwelling CVC, only 4 episodes (15%) were line-related. Only 3 patients were neutropenic at the time of PaB. Twenty-four percent (5 pts) had a second episode of PaB. 242 Prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamvdia trachomatis infections among Commercial Sex Workers (CSW) in the Philippines.

'George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, 2John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, 'Family Health International (AIDSCAP), 'Philippine General Hospital, Manila, Philippines, 'Cebu City Hygiene Clinic, 6Velez Medical School, Cebu, Philippines, 7University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 8Ministry of Health of the Philippines We performed a prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae among CSW seen at the Social Hygiene Clinics in Manila and Cebu. Urine specimen and cervical swabs were collected. Cervical swabs were tested for C. trachomatis using the Clearview Assay (CV) (Unipath, United Kingdom) and cultured for N. conorrhoeae using modified Thayer-Martin media. Both cervical and urine specimens were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with DNA probe hybridization in an ELISA-like detection assay (provided by Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ). The target sequence for DNA amplification for C. trachomatis is the cryptic plasmid which is common to all strains and not found in any other bacteria. A segment of the cytosine methyl transferase gene M:NgoP,l served as a target sequence for N. oonorrhoeae amplification. C. trachomatis was detected by (CV) in 47/269 (17.4%) samples from CSW in Manila and in 62/282 (21.9%) from CSW in Cebu with an overall prevalence of 19.8%. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated in 26/273 (9.5%) from cervical cultures of CSW in Manila and in 70/300 (23%) among CSW in Cebu with an overall prevalence of 16.8%. Testing a subset of the specimens by PCR assay for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae revealed a prevalence rate for C. trachomatis of 61/180 (33.9%) and for N. gonorrhoeae of 44/180 (24.4%) using either urine specimen or cervical swabs or both. These results demonstrate that there is high prevalence of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae among CSW in the Philippines. The PCR assay appears to be more sensitive in the detection of both organisms at least in a subset of CSW tested. 243 Primary Treatment of Visceral Leishma- niasis(VL) with Liposomal Amphotericin B(LAMB).Are Low Doses Effective?A.PEFANIS ,A.TOSKAS,H.GIAMA- RELLOU*and A.TOULIATOU.Athens University Medical School and Athens General Hospital,Athens,Greece. Pentavalent antimonials have been the standard treatment of VL for many years.The high relapse rate,especially in immunodeficient patients(IDP) and their side effects promted the study of alter- native regimens. Stlcies by Davidson et al*with the use of 2gLAMPsuggest efficacy and reduced toxicity. We present here our experience with the use of LAMB as primary treatment of VL in 7 immunocompe- tent patients(ICP) and 2 IDP admitted in two ter- tiary care hospitals in a two year period(1993- 1995).Pretherapy findings in the 7 ICP were(mean+ SD):age:38?16y,Hb:8.8?2.lg/dl,WBC:2500?1300/41, PLT:90500?14840/51,albumin:3.18t0.33g/dl.Diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of parasites in bo- ne marrow aspirates(5pts) and by serology(IFA&gt;1/ 400) in 2 pts.The three first pts were treated with higher doses(1.7-2.0g),while the other four pts received 1.lg of LAMB.Fever ceased after 2 to 3 days of treatment.All pts were cured on clini- cal criteria.The mean follow up period was 7.2 m. No relapses were occured.Side effects were:mildly increased liver enzymes(4 pts),drug fever(lpt) and infusion rate related lumbar pain(lpt).The two IDP pts(l with AIDS and 1 with a renal transplant) re- ceived 1.5g of LAMB and no relapses were observed during the follow up(4.5 and 3.5m).These results suggest that : a)LAMB is safe and efficacious in the treatment of VL,and b)doses as low as 1.lg,and perhaps even lower,deserve further clinical eva- luation in ICP in order this regimen to be cost effective. *(Lancet 1991;337:1061-1062). 244 Is Prolonged Preoperative Hospitaliza- tion Influencial on Gastric Flora Colonization with Nosocomial Gram Negatives?M.SOULI,P.GRECKA,E.GIA- MARELLOS-BOURBOULIS,E.PAPALABROS, E.VAFIADES,H.GIA- MARELLOU.Athens University School of Medicine,Greece. Gastroduodenal operations on patients with an al- kaline pH require perioperative prophylaxis with a 1st gen.cephalosporin.However,little information in available concerning the possible colonization of gastric flora with multiresistant nosocomial strains in patients hospitalized for &gt;3 days be- fore being operated on,in hospital settings with predominant high resistance rates.Such an event should influence the selection of the appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis.Therefore,a study was designed in order to clarify the latter situation. A total of 260 immunocompetent patients with alka- line gastric pH who had not received any antimicro- bial in the preceding 3 months entered the study. They were devided into 2 groups as follows: Group A(82 patients) represented the nonnosocomial group (control) and group B(178 patients) represen- ted the hospitalized group.Gastric fluid samples were collected(I) during gastroscopy(82 samples from group A and 67 from group B),(II) during ab- dominal operations(57 samples from group B), and (III)by a levine tube(54 samples from group B). Twenty-nine samples (35.4%) from group A vs 71sam- ples (43.8%) from group B were positive with )105 cfu/ml of gram negatives,E.coli being the predomi- nant isolate in both groups.No significant diffe- rence in their susceptibilities or the preoperati- ve duration of hospitalization(4-14d) was observed. Therefore prophylaxis with a traditional 1st gen. cephalosporin seems adequate in similar patients with prolonged preoperative hospitalization. 245 Vaginal microflora in HIV-infected women. L. Guginol, D.A.Tristram2*, D. Samadil, S.S. Altaie2 and F. Heavens2. SUNY at Buffalo School of Medicine and Children's Hosp of Buffalo, Depts of Ob/Gynl and Pediatrics2, Buffalo, NY. In the US the number of HIV-infected women is steadily increasing. These women are at increased risk of infectious and neoplastic conditions, particularly of the genital tract A unique clinical course and microbiology has been described for HIV-infected women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) characterized by less abdominal tenderness, lower white cell counts and lower incidence of Neisseria gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia recovery during acute PID. Although the vaginal microflora of non-HIV infected women has been well-described, that of HIV-infected women has not. In order to elucidate the effect of HIV-mediated immunosuppression on the composition of the vaginal microflora, a microbiologic analysis of the vaginal microflora was undertaken. Cervical cultures for aerobes, anaerobes, genital mycoplasmas (Ureaplasma urealyticwn [UU] and Mycoplasma hominis) and chlamydia ELISA were obtained during routine gynecological examinations of 32 HIV-infected women. Women were separated into those with CD4 counts &lt; 200 or &gt;200. Aerobic flora were similar between the two HIV groups and to that reported for non-HIV infected women with the exception of GC (1 isolate only). Anaerobic flora among women with counts &gt;200 paralleled non-HIV women, while those with CD4 &lt;200 had less recovery of anaerobes whose growth favors an acidic vaginal pH. There were no positive chlamydia EUSAs. UU isolation in our group was similar to non-HIV infected women. More significant was the recovery of M.hominis compared with non-HIV infected women. M.hominis has been isolated from 50% of women attending public clinics and from 20% of women attending private Ob/Gyn offices; isolation in our HIV-infected women was slightly higher (63%). We feel that the increased recovery of genital tract mycoplasmas in the absence of common agents of PID (GC and chlamydia) in an HIV-infected female population may contribute to the increased incidence of atypical PID and should be sought and treated in all HIV-infected women during routine and acute Ob/Gyn visits.</page><page sequence="43">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 761 246 Health Assessments for Refugees: Experience at a Single Site. ED BARNETTt, AH HOLMES, S PHILLIPS, B VINER, E LATIMER. Maxwell Finland Laboratory for Infectious Diseases and Section of cGneral Internal Medicine, Boston City Hospital and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA. Health assessments for newly arrived refugees arc performed at the Boston City Hospital International Clinic based on a protocol prepared by the Department of Public Health. Individuals were screened for anemia, eosinophilia, hepatitis B markcrs, stool ova and parasites, tuberculosis, and syphilis. Screening tests were performed for 105 refugees from 5 countries: Somalia (77), Haiti (10), Viet Nam (9), Iraq (6), and Cambodia (3). Patients ranged in age from 15 months to 85 years; 9 (9%) were under age 6, 44 (42%) were from 6 to 21 years, and 51 (49%) were over age 21. 51 (49%) were female. Anemia was present in 11/99 individuals (11%), and cosinophilia in 45/99 (45%). Hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in 3 individuals; antibody to hepatitis B core antigen in 50. Results of testing for stool ova and parasites revealed Giardia in 14/93 (15%), Entamoeba histolytica in 19/93 (20%), Trichuris trichiura in 12/93 (13%), Ascaris in 5/93 (5%), hookworm in 3/93 (3%), and Strongyloides in 1/93 (1%). Intestinal parasites were identified in individuals from all 5 countries. Positive syphilis serologies were noted in 3 individuals. Tuberculin testing was positive in 45%. Common patient complaints were headache (11%), abdominal pain (10%), toothache (10%), hearing problems or ear pain (7%), vision problem (6%), and rash or itching (5%). Other diagnoses included dental caries (22%), ear disease (9%), scabies (6%), eye disease (6%), pregnancy (5%), diabetes (3%) and hypertension (3%). Initial health assessment for refugees identifies important infectious diseases. Small numbers of patients seen and frequency of positive tests does not provide sufficient data to permit screening targeted by country. Many medical problems identified are of a chronic nature, and routine primary care and obstetrical services must be provided to this population at the end of the health assessment. 247 The l)evelopment of an Appropriate Screening and Treatment Strategy for Schistosomiasis in the Somalian Refugee Population followed at Boston City Hospital's International Clinic. ALISON HOLMES*, ELIZABE'TH BARNEFT, CAROLE MITNICK2, SUSAN PHILLIPS, MIRIAM GAS, MOHAMMED WAIS and MARIANNA WILSON3. International Clinic, Boston City Hospital, MA. Ilarvard School of Public llealth, Boston, MA2. CDC, Atlanta, GA3. The increasing number of Somali arrivals in Massachusetts presents a new challenge for US health care providers. The refugees have endured physical and psychological trauma on their long journey out of war-torn areas, aswell as suffering numerous infectious diseases. Most come from Southern Somalia and escaped to Kenya, where they remained in either of two Kenyan refugee camps (one outside Nairobi, the other outside Mombasa) for up to 3 years before their arrival in the US. S. hematobium is endemic in Southern Somalia (up to 89% of inhabitants infected). No S. mansoni has been reported there. flowever both are present in Northern Kenya. Eosinophilia, a potential indicator of schistosomiasis, was found in 55% of 77 Somalian refugees seen at the Boston City Hospital's (BCH) International Clinic. Ilowever, eosinophilia alone is an inadequate predictor of schistosomiasis in this group because of the high frequency of multiple parasitic infestations and some cases of scabies. No schistosome ova were detected in urine or stool specimens. So far, of 18 patients with eosinophilia who had serological testing for S. hematobium and S. tnansoni, half had positive ELISAs, and in 6 the diagnosis was confirmed by immunoblot. All cases were S. hematobium. There were 2 cases of microscopic hematuria. All 18 individuals had been detained in the refugee camp outside Nairobi. 'he 6 serologically confirmed cases had all originated from Kismayu; 5 were members of the same family. There was no serological evidence of infection in the other 12 individuals, 4 of whom came from Mogadishu. In this population eosinophilia lacks specificity as an indicator for schistosomiasis, ova detection is inadequate, hematuria is infrequent, and a detailed travel and exposure history may be of significant value. Serological testing is sensitive and specific, however it is not routinely available and it is expensive. Also, the role of treatment in these individuals with positive serologies needs clarification. An appropriate, cost-effective strategy for managing schistosomiasis needs to be developed, on the basis of data collected from this patient group. Many more Somali refugees are expected. We are currently performing serological testing on all Somali refugees, to assess the positive predictive value of combinations of different tests (eosinophil counts, urinalysis, urine and stool examinations), and/or a detailed travel and exposure history in Somalia and Kenya. The results of this analysis will be the basis of a population specific screening and treatment algorithm to be used at the BCII International clinic. 248 Organizing Chaos: Radical Improvements in the Display of Clinical Microbiology Results-A Web-Based Clinical Information System (CIS). K.E. WILLARD*, J. R. JOHNSON. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN Retrieving and interpreting clinical microbiology results can be a difficult, frustrating challenge. We have designed, developed, and deployed a new approach (the CIS) to the organization and display of clinical microbiology results. In contrast to most current laboratory information systems, which can only access detailed reports of individual laboratory tests in sequence, the CIS is designed to allow physicians to obtain an overview of a patient's current (or past) microbiological status at a glance, with the option to selectively explore in greater depth. The CIS was deployed using World Wide Web technology, which supports virtually an kind of computer access (Macintosh, Windows, X-Windows), and allows physicians to obtain results via the internet using office or home personal computers. STUDY: To compare the performance of the CIS with the hospital's current system (STAR), we asked 16 clinicians (M.D.s, R.N.s, Pharm.D.s, and R.P.s) to use both systems to retrieve microbiology results for 2 actual patients, according to a standardized questionnaire. Half of the participants used STAR first, then CIS; half the reverse. Outcomes were 1) time to completion and 2) frequency of errors (classified as "minor", e.g. incorrect dates for specimens, and "major", e.g. missing a bacteremia episode). All subjects were veteran STAR users, whereas only one was experienced with the CIS. RESULTS: Mean completion time was 45% shorter with the CIS than with STAR (13.9 min. vs. 25.5 min.: p &lt; .001). The CIS also had fewer associated major errors (0 vs. 13: p = .01) and minor errors (10 vs. 21: p = .003). In a graded opinion survey, all participants agreed the CIS was easier to learn and use, and was significantly faster than STAR. CONCLUSION: An appropriately designed microbiology results reporting system utilizing contemporary Web technology can significantly shorten results retrieval times and reduce clinically-significant interpretive errors. 249 Prosthetic Joint Infection(PJI) due to Coagulase Negative Staphylococci(SCN) Treated with Debridement and Prosthesis Retention W.W.SISTRUNK*, J.M.STECKELBERG, A.D.HANSSEN, and D.R.OSMON Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota Objective: To calculate the hazard of subsequent SCN PJI in patients with SCN PJI following debridement with retention of the prosthesis and antimicrobial therapy. Methods: All patients with definite THA or TKA infection due to SCN treated at the Mayo Clinic from 1/69-12/91 that met a previously published case definition and underwent debridement and retention of the prosthesis were followed from the date of debridement until death, loss to follow-up, prosthesis removal, or evidence of PJI. The major endpoint was reinfection due to SCN. Follow-up was &gt;95% complete. Therapy was not protocolized. Kaplan-Meier estimation and the log-rank test were used to calculate the five year survival and compare the groups. Table 1 N # Failures Percent Free of Relapse 1 year 3 years 5 years 6 years THA 7 5 66.7 33.3 16.7 16.7 TKA 12 4 75.0 75.0 75.0 60.0 Total 19 9 72.5 57.7 49.4 41.2 Results: 19 patients were followed a mean of 57 months (range 2.5-256). There were 9 males and 10 females with a mean age of 64.7 years(range 51-88). 8/19 of the SCN isolates were oxacillin resistant. 5/7THA's and 4/12 TKA's had subsequent SCN PJI. Five year survival free of relapse of SCN PJI are found in Table 1. No significant difference in risk of SCN reinfection was found among groups based on type( p-lactam 1 1/19, Vancomycin 4/19, Netilmicin 1/19, None 3/19) and duration(Average length 18.8 days, range 0-44) of iv antibiotic therapy, length of symptoms, prosthesis age, local antibiotic therapy,diabetes,rheumatoid arthtritis,steroid use,ll-lactam sensitivity,or joint location. Conclusion: Subsequent SCN PJI following debridement with retention of the prosthesis is common. Although not statistically significant, patients with a THA had a higher hazard of SCN reinfection than patients with a TKA. Further studies are underway to define clinical variables that predict subsequent SCN PJI in this patient population. 250 Maternal Genital Tract Infections and Birth Outcome: A Prospective Study. W. M. WENMAN*, I. V. TATARYN, R. PEARSON, M. R. JOFFRES AND E. PRASAD for The Edmonton Perinatal Infections Group. University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The association of genital tract infections with birth outcome is being investigated in a prospective study of over 2200 women from private and hospital practices in a major urban center. Since July 1993, all pregnant women cared for by 10 obstetricians have been approached for participation in the study. Over 95% of these women have agreed to participate and completed a questionnaire addressing demographic and risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, nutrition, physical activity and reproductive, obstetrical and family history. Microbiology specimens were obtained at three points: the initial visit (mean gestation 8 weeks), second trimester and at delivery. Birth weight and birth data used to calculate gestational age have been extracted from hospital delivery records. Among 1510 deliveries to date, prevalence (%) of genital organisms at the first, second and delivery exam was respectively: Chlamydia trachomatis (1, 0.2, 0.5), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.1, 0, 0), Ureaplasma ureayticum (37, 38, 40), Mycoplasma hominis (5, 4, 5), Group B Streptococcus (I I, 12, 14), bacterial vaginosis (17, 15, 14), Trichomonas vaginalis (0.2, 0.2, 0), Candida (7, 7, 4). The risk of delivering a baby with birth weight (BW) &lt; 2500 grams is 5.5% if the mother has one or more genital infection compared to 1.8% if she has none (RR 3.0). There is also a significant difference in mean BW between the 2 groups: 3516 versus 3359 grams (P &lt; 0.001). Analysis of the first 649 women who have completed all 3 exams shows that at this point in the study, the strongest association between individual infections and low BW lies with C. trachomatis and U. urealyticum. Women who were infected with either organism at one or more microbiological exams delivered infants with significantly lower mean BW than the newborns of uninfected women (P &lt; 0.05). Those women who were C. trachomatis positive at delivery only produced infants with mean BW 2893 grams compared to 3642 grams for those who were C trachomatis negative (P = 0.02). This association between C. trachomatis and low BW is even more significant when adjusted for maternal age and cigarette smoking (P &lt; 0.001). The association between birth weight and various genital organisms, as well as other risk factors, continues to be analyzed in the study. 251 Congenital Rubella Infection: Report of 18 Cases from 1981 to 1994. M.H. LEBEL, M.-F. GAGNON, F. SAINTONGE, G.A. AHRONHEIM.* H6pital Sainte-Justine, Univ. de Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Rubella vaccines have been available in Canada and recommended since 1970-71. Nevertheless -10% of pregnant women in the Montreal area are rubella seronegative and presumably susceptible. Objectives: To document and describe clinical features of patients with congenital rubella treated at our hospital. Methods: Retrospective review of all cases of congenital rubella infections identified at Sainte-Justine, a tertiary care pediatric and obstetric hospital. Only infants with positive culture(s) for rubella virus and/or positive IgM ELISA serology for rubella virus were included. Results: 18 patients were identified (14 patients with positive culture and 16 with positive IgM antibodies). 16 were born in Canada, 1 in Honduras and 1 in the Seychelles. 2 mothers were seropositive to rubella during previous pregnancies. A history of rubella contact during pregnancy was found in 1 mother but 7/18 (39%) presented with a rash in 1st trimester. The median age at diagnosis of congenital rubella infection was 1 month (range: 1 day-19 months). Intrauterine growth retardation was present in 67% of patients; 17% were born prematurely. Congenital heart disease was present in 83%; lesions included PDA (12), pulmonary artery hypoplasia (6), ASD (5), VSD (5), pulmonary valve stenosis (3) and 5 other. Thrombocytopenia was present in 67%, cataracts in 61%, microcephaly in 61%, hearing impairment in 56%, hepatosplenomegaly in 44%, jaundice in 44%, glaucoma in 22%, microophthalmia in 11%, pigmentary retinopathy in 11%, and intracranial calcifications in 11%. 39% developed psychomotor retardation and 67% failure to thrive. Conclusions: Congenital rubella infection is still present in countries with easily accessible immunization and is associated with significant morbidity. Immediate post-partum rubella vaccination must be systematically offered to seronegative mothers.</page><page sequence="44">762 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 252 Culture Confirmed Reinfection by Different Strains of Borrelia burgdorferi. ROBINSON-DUNN, B.*, M.G. STOBIERSKI, W. GOLDE, V. CARLSON, H. STIEFEL, S. SHIFLETT. Ml Dept. of Public Health, Lansing, Ml, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO, Daggett Medical Clinic, Daggett, Ml. In Michigan, Lyme Disease (LD) is endemic only in the Upper Peninsula (Menominee County). A previous report documented the first two culture confirmed cases of LD in Michigan. To our knowledge, culture confirmed reinfection by B. burgdorfen of a human has not been previously reported. This report describes the reinfection of a 63 year old male resident of Menominee County by two different strains of B. burgdorfen over a time span of two years. Skin punch biopsies were obtained from the leading edges of the erythema migrans lesions, placed in modified Barbour-Stoener-Kelly (BSK) culture medium and transported to the Michigan Department of Public Health laboratory. Cultures were examined weekly for 12 weeks. Spirochetal growth was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody. Sequential serum specimens were tested by both EIA and immunoblot methodologies for IgM and IgG antibodies. Molecular strain typing was performed by the CDC-Fort Collins. B. burgdorferi was isolated from the skin punch biopsies and was confirmed by monoclonal antibody testing. Serum samples were shown to contain IgM and/or IgG confirmed by immunoblot testing. Strain typing by various methods including Western Blot analysis indicated that the two isolates were different. This case report represents the first documented culture confirmed reinfection of a human by two different strains of B. burgdorfen. 253 Relationship Between Chlamydia trachomatis Infection and HIV Infection in Men. J.W. SANDERS*, E.W. HOOK III, Y.Y. PALESCH, L.E. WELSH, M.E. SHEPHERD, T.C. QUINN. The Medical Univ. of S.C., Charleston, SC, The Univ. of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, The Johns Hopkins Univ., Balto., MD, and NIAID, Bethesda, MD. The relationship between non-ulcerative STDs and HIV infection (HIV) in the U.S. is unknown. Because of their high prevalence, non-ulcerative STDs may represent a considerable population attributable risk for HIV. We evaluated 1530 men attending two STD clinics for C. trachomatis infection (CT) by urethral culture and urine sediment enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with analysis of discrepant results by direct fluorescent antibody staining of elementary bodies in urine sediment or transport media. 1340 (88%) men consented to HIV screening by serum HIV EIA and Westem blot. The prevalences of CT, HIV, and co-infection were CT: 11.2%, HIV: 5.4%, and CT/HIV: 0.15%. By univariate and multivariate logistic regression, CT was not associated with HIV (O.R.= 0.5, 95% Cl 0.12, 2.4). By univariate analysis, infection due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (O.R.=0.57, C.I. .25, 1.32) and non-gonococcal urethritis (O.R.= .84, Cl 0.26, 2.71) were not associated with HIV, whereas serologic or darkfield evidence of syphilis (O.R.=6.29, Cl 3.47, 11.43) was associated with HIV. By stepwise logistic regression the only behavioral parameters associated with HIV infection were gay or bisexual preference (O.R.=52.6, Cl 21.7, 125.0), and IV drug use (O.R.=15.1, Cl 7.6, 30.3). We conclude that HIV infection is not independently associated with urethral infection due to CT, or other non- ulcerative STDs in men in this study population, in contrast to genital ulcer disease and known risk behaviors. Further prospective studies to examine the relationship between non- ulcerative STDs and HIV are needed. 254 Early Identification of Patients with Tuberculosis: Results of a Radiologist Triggered Intervention Program. J.A. NELSON*, B. DEHAAN, L. EISNER, C.A. BENSON, B.E. SHA, G.R. MATTHEW, and A.A. HARRIS. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL. A cooperative program between radiology and infection control staff was initiated in 10/93 to rapidly identify pts. with possible pulmonary tuberculosis (AJIC, April 1994). Chest radiographs (CXR) with upper lobe disease were identified by a radiologist and reported to infection control staff. Infection control staff then recommended to hospital staff the appropriate isolation procedures for hospitalized pts. We report the characteristics of all patients with a diagnosis of active pulmonary TB hospitalized at Rush Medical Center during 1994 and our I year experience with this early identification program. Overall, 26 pts. with culture-confirmed TB were identified by the microbiology laboratory during 1994. These included isolates recovered from pulmonary specimens in 21 pts. and from extrapulmonary sites (lymph node, paraspinal abscess, peritoneal fluid, blood) in 5; 19/21 pts. with pulmonary disease were hospitalized and their charts were reviewed. The median age was 48 (range 2-88); 12 were African-American, 5 Caucasian, and 2 Latino. There were 10 men, 8 women, and 1 child. Three had a previous history of TB and 3 were HIV+ (CD4 343, 117, 20). Twelve were not tested for HIV. Sputum smears were AFB (+) for 10/19 (53%). One pt. died of TB prior to disease recognition and initiation of therapy. One pt. had multidrug-resistant TB. Initial CXRs showed upper lobe disease in 9/10 AFB smear (+) pts. and a lower lobe infiltrate with effusion in 1 pt. The infection control staff evaluated 26 pts. with suspect TB by CXR as identified by a radiologist; 22 of these 26 did not have TB and 4 were AFB smear and sputum culture (+). One of these 4 was isolated by infection control staff and 3 were already isolated. The 6 additional AFB smear (+) cases, who had suspect CXRs and were ultimately diagnosed with TB, were not reported to infection control staff in the early identification program; 3 had isolation delays of 1-8 days. The initial CXR of all 10 AFB smear (+) hospitalized pts. during 1994 had CXR evidence to suggest TB. A radiologist-triggered passive reporting system successfully identified 4/10 smear (+) pts., but had the potential to identify all 10. The program has been amended to require infection control staff to actively contact the radiologist daily. This cooperative effort may offer the earliest opportunity to identify and isolate cases of infectious pulmonary TB. 255 Blood Cultures: Back to Basics. J.A. NELSON*, B. DEHAAN, B.A. SCHMITT, L. EISNER, G.M. TRENHOLME, and A. HARRIS. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL. Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, an urban tertiary care hospital and an acute geriatric facility, has a bed capacity of 1,088. During 1994, 29,326 blood cultures were processed by our laboratory and 1,902 (6.5%) were positive. Included were 361 gram-negative and 1,541 gram-positive isolates. Our computer tracking method is designed to exclude patient duplicate isolates within a 72 hour period. Of the gram-positive organisms, 967 (63%) were coagulase- negative Staph (CNS). Believing a number of the CNS represented contaminants in 2/95, we sought to assess the knowledge of the staff responsible for obtaining these cultures. Eight true/false questions were distributed to 304 individuals: 46 medical students, 105 residents, 132 nurses, and 21 members of our specialized blood drawing teams. The students and nursing staff had the greatest percentage of correct responses (70%). Our specialized blood drawing team and residents had a 65% and 57% accuracy, respectively. More than 60% of respondents were not aware that needles need not be changed between the patient and introduction into blood culture bottles. More than 30% were not aware of the importance of drying time in regards to skin decontamination. More than 15% believed two blood cultures could be obtained from the same venipuncture. Other questions pertained to the use of gloves, appropriate blood volumes, and cleansing of the culture bottles. Results of the survey and the rationale for correct responses were distributed to all staff the day after the survey. This resulted in a number of additional educational programs. In the month following our survey, 65 CNS were isolated from blood, a 20% decrease from both the monthly average of 1994 and the first month of 1995 (81 CNS isolates). It is important to consider alternative skin preparations (iodine) and the use of prepared kits to decrease blood culture contamination rates. However, a survey of this type is inexpensive, can assess the areas where additional teaching efforts are needed, and by itself, act as an educational tool. The opportunity to reduce the number of needle exposures taking place within our institution was an additional benefit realized by this survey. 256 Vascular Access Complications in Patients Receiving Home IV Antibiotic Therapy. S.J. REHM*, F.C. YOON. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH. Home intravenous antibiotic therapy programs have been an important component of efforts to reduce the cost of care for serious infections. Complications of home therapy may significantly impact costs. Since few studies have reviewed the impact of vascular access complications in this population, we reviewed the Cleveland Clinic experience. In the past 16 years, a total of 4386 courses of IV antibiotics were administered to patients at home. End-of-therapy reports were completed for 1974 courses (45%); 148 courses (7.5%) were complicated by 152 IV access-related events. Phlebitis was noted during 33 courses (1.7% of all courses for which end-of-therapy reports were completed). Twelve courses were complicated by line sepsis (0.6%) and in 103 courses, there was another line-related event (5.2%). This category included patients with deep venous thrombosis, loss of IV access, IV device malfunction, and exit site infection. Two patients experienced both line sepsis and other complications. One patient had phlebitis and another line-related event; in another, phlebitis was associated with line sepsis. One patient had two separate episodes of line sepsis. Readmission was necessary for most patients with line sepsis or deep venous thrombosis; there were no deaths. We conclude that serious vascular access complications are uncommon in patients receiving home intravenous antibiotic therapy. They are frequently associated with morbidity and sometimes lead to rehospitalization. 257 Survey of Surgical Antimicrobial Prophylaxis: Practice Versus Standard Recommen- dations. C.S.RICHARDS* and B.A.CATTO. Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, GA. Standard recommendations for preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis are widely disseminated, but actual practice may differ. We retrospectively reviewed surgical prophylaxis at our 380-bed acute care teaching hospital for three months. Antibiotic(s) selected, duration and time prophylaxis initiated were surveyed. GI/General procedures were cholecystectomy(13), colectomy( 3), laparotomy(9) and hernia repair(21). Ceftizoxime was the agent of choice and the number of doses ranged from 1- 36. Orthopedic procedures included total hip replacement(12), open reduction/internal fixation(9) and tendon release(19). Doses of cefazolin, the antibiotic of choice, ranged from 2-23. Cardiovascular procedures consisted of CABG(27), valve replacement(3), pacemaker placement(8), aortic aneurysm repair(7) and femoral-popliteal bypass(6). Cephapirin was the preferred agent with a range of 6-17 doses given. Urologic procedures included TURP(18), penile prosthesis implantation(11) and orchiectomy(4). Various combinations and durations of prophylaxis were used. However, cefuroxime was the primary single agent and duration ranged from 1-29 doses. Neurosurgical procedures surveyed were laminec- tomy(5), discectomy(14) and craniotomy(5). Nafcillin was the drug of choice with a dosage range of 5-42 doses. Conclusions: l)antibiotic choice differed from standard recommendations in many instances; 2)antimicrobial prophylaxis duration was excessive; 3)time of initiation was appropriate in the majority of surgeries.</page><page sequence="45">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 763 258 Prognosis of HIV-Infected Incarcerated Males with CD4 Lymphocyte Counts of less than 50/cubic mm. J. BICK*, J. BELLAMY, K. BRADLEY, D. DEWSNUP, J DOUST, K. GERAGHTY, J. KOZLOWSKI. HIV Treatment Unit, California Medical Facility, California Department of Corrections, Vacaville, California. California Medical Facility (CMF), a 3200 bed correctional medical facility for men within the California Department of Corrections, includes a 66 bed licensed acute care hospital, 17 bed hospice, and 472 bed outpatient HIV housing unit. Average daily census during 1994 of identified HIV-infected inmates was 468. Between 4/3/93 and 3/13/95, 102 HIV-infected men died while incarcerated at CMF. We performed a retrospective analysis of this cohort to determine length of survival following the first documented drop in CD4 count to &lt; 50. Of the 102 subjects, data was available to assess 52. The majority of unassessable subjects arrived at CMF with CD4 counts below 50 and never had documented values &gt; 50. Median survival of subjects once their CD4 count fell to &lt;50 was 14.4 months, with a standard deviation of 9.4. Range was &lt;1 to 47 months. While most patients had received antiretroviral therapy, the majority did not receive such therapy once CD4 counts fell below 50. Although &gt;95% were prescribed pneumocystis prophylaxis, compliance was considerably less. Survival was not associated with risk factor for HIV infection, age, or race. Survival of this cohort of incarcerated patients compares favorably with published data of non-incarcerated patients with similar CD4 profiles. 259 Screening HIV-Infected Inmate/Patients for Contagious TB upon Entry to a Correctional Medical Facility J.BICK*, D.DEWSNUP, J. KOZLOWSKI, J. YOUNG. Infection Control Unit, California Medical Facility (CMF), California Department of Corrections (CDoC), Vacaville, California. CMF is a 3200 bed state prison medical facility which includes a 472 bed outpatient HIV housing unit. Prior to 7/93, routine TB screening consisted only of annual skin testing. Between 7/93 and 12/93, 3 cases of contagious tuberculosis were diagnosed in newly arriving HIV infected inmates. In an attempt to improve pre- transfer diagnosis of contagious TB, beginning 10/93 chest radiographs (CXR) were requested prior to medical acceptance of transfers. Although requested for all, pre- transfer CXR screening was obtained for less than half of new arrivals. Therefore in 1/95, analysis of 3 induced sputum specimens was instituted for all new arrivals. Between 1/94 and 3/95, 4 new cases of contagious TB were identified by a pre- transfer CXR. Concurrently, 486 patients (100% of new arrivals) produced 1404 specimens for analysis. No occult TB was identified by sputum analysis. Forty isolates of non-tuberculous mycobacteria were identified in 27 patients (M. avium, 17; M. kansasii, 5; M. xenopi, 5; M. gordonae, 4; M. fortuitum, 3). One patient was felt to have active disease due to M. kansasii. We conclude that 1) pre-transfer CXR identified all contagious TB among new arrivals, 2) routine induced sputum analysis did not identify additional cases of TB in this cohort, 3) potentially pathogenic mycobacterium were present in sputum in a low percentage of this cohort (22/486, 4.5%), and 4) without consistent medical screening prior to entry the potential for transfer of undiagnosed contagious TB remains. 260 Low Rate of Tuberculosis Transmission among Employees of a Correctional Medical Facility in Califonia. D. DEWSNUP, J. YOUNG, J. DOWNING, J. BAKER, F. LEWIS, J. KOZLOWSKI, J.BICK*. Infection Control Unit, California Medical Facility (CMF), California Department of Corrections (CDoC), Vacaville, California. Annual Mantoux skin testing has been a condition of employment within the CDoC since 1/94. CMF is a 3200 bed correctional medical facility within CDoC, with an average daily census of 468 identified HIV-infected patients. During 1994, 4 cases of contagious pulmonary TB were identified within inmate/patients, all of whom were HIV-infected. Three of these are linked by time, space, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns (rifampin resistance). Prevalence of TB infection among CMF inmates was -26% in 4/93 and 4/94. Annual skin testing of all inmates is mandated; in addition, HIV-infected inmates undergo sputum analysis and q 6 month CXR. Annual employee TB skin testing in 1/95 revealed: total number of employees, 1338; number for whom data is available, 1318; number PPD-negative,l 131; number PPD-positive, 187. There were 8 skin test conversions between 1/94 and 1/95, for an attack rate of .70%. Converters included 5 correctional officers, 1 janitor, 1 medical administrator, and 1 psychiatrist. Two conversions were identified as case contacts of one patient with rifampin-resistant TB disease. No cases of active TB were identified among employees in 1994. Although the rate of skin test conversions was low (8/1318), CMF continues to be a "high-risk" environment due to documented person-to-person transmission among inmate/patients and identification of a skin test conversion cluster among employees. 261 Variation of Laboratory Methods for the Detection of Group B Streptococcus in Antepartum Screening Specimens. E.S. PARTLOW, H.D. DAVIES*, C. BISCHOFF, R. SAUVE, A. MCGEER, D. LOW and the Alberta/Toronto Streptococcal Study Group. Alberta Children's Hosp., University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta. The prevention of neonatal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is facilitated by recognition of GBS colonization of the maternal genital tract. GBS detection is dependent upon many factors including specimen collection sites techniques and laboratory methodology. We surveyed all the medical microbiology laboratories in Alberta to assess current techniques for the identification of GBS in screening specimens from pregnant women. Twenty eight (74%) of the 38 labs process screening specimens, the remaining 10 either forward specimens to other labs or do not receive such specimens. Of those processing specimens 23 (82%) have a specific protocol for handling GBS specimens whereas 18% do not. Eleven per-cent of the labs receive dual (vaginal/rectal) specimens only, 25% vaginal only, and 21% both; the remainder receive multiple site specimens. Fifty per cent of labs never process dual swabs, and 39% process the less reliable cervical swabs. Selective broth media for the identification of GBS is utilized in only 12 (43%) labs and in many cases screening specimens are also planted on other media as part of a work-up for other genital pathogens. Rapid antigen detection methods for initial identification are utilized by 6 (21%) labs: in 4 labs these are applied to intrapartum specimens only and in two, they are used as a routine detection method for all specimens. We conclude that 1) GBS colonization may be under reported due to the lack of sensitivity of site and identification techniques employed by many laboratories; 2) there is significant variation in the utilization of laboratory resources for the investigation of antepartum genital specimens; 3) specimen collection procedures and laboratory diagnostic techniques should be standardized to yield accurate information on GBS colonization of pregnant women. 262 CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOME OF CHILDHOOD SEPTIC ARTHRITIS AT A PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL. A. Karwowska' ,i.D. Davies'23', T. Jadavii'2 , Departments of 'Pediatrics and 2Microbiology, 3 Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH), Calgary, Alberta. Septic arthritis (SA) has been estimated to cause up to two of every 100 general hospital admissions in children. In order to define the epidemiology, management and outcome of this disease in our population, we reviewed the health records of all patients with a discharge diagnosis of SA over a 10 year period (01/84 - 12/93). During the study period, we identified 49 cases, for an annual admission rate of 7 cases per 10,000 admissions per year. The male:female ratio was 1:1, with a mean age of 5.4yrs + 4.8yrs. The most commonly affected joints were the hip (36.7%) and the knee (30.6%). The most common presenting symptoms were decreased use of the affected limb in 48 (98.0%), and fever&gt;38.5'C in 30 (61.2%) patients. The median duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 2 days (range 1-60). A history of trauma was given in 7 (14.3%) patients. Signs most commonly noted on initial examination were: decreased range of motion at the joint (91.8%), tenderness on palpation (79.6%), swelling (63.3%), fever (61.2%), and warmth (36.7%). The mean total WBC on admission was 14.7 X 109/L (range 2.7 - 40.6 X 109L), predominantly polymorphs. Mean admission ESR was 52.8 + 33.4. Blood cultures were positive in 21 (48.8%) of 43 patients in whom they were performed. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus, seen in 10 (47.6%) of 21 positive cultures, followed by coagulase negative staphylococcus in 4 (19.0%) cases. The initial radiogram was abnormal in 19 (51.4%) of 37 children receiving the test. In contrast, 19 (55.9%) of 34 bone scans done, showed evidence of increased uptake over the involved joint. Twenty eight (63.6%) of 44 joint aspirates performed were culture positive, the predominant organism being S. aureus in 15 (53.6%) cases. The median duration of intravenous treatment was 13 days (range 3-23) and the median duration of hospitalization was 14.0 days (range 4-6). The majority of patients (91.5%) responded adequately to treatment, without complications. The most common complication (4.3%) was joint deformity. We conclude that septic arthritis is an uncommon cause of hospitalization at our institution relative to previous reports, but the outcome is excellent. 263 HOSPITALIZATION FOR VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS (VZV) INFECTIONS IN HEALTHY, CHRONICALLY ILL AND IMMUNOCOMPROMISED CHILDREN. S. Kuhn H.D. Davies'and T. Jadavii. University of Calgary, Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH), Cal., Alb., CANADA. Recent advances in antiviral therapy and vaccine development have led to optimism for total control of varicella infections. We wanted to get an idea of our hospitalization rates with varicella prior to introduction of the new varicella vaccine for possible comparison with rates following vaccine introduction, as well as to identify the reasons for hospitalization and outcome. We therefore reviewed the health records of all 166 children hospitalized with varicella-zoster (VZV) infections over a 10 year period (January 1983 to December 1992) at ACH using standardized data collection sheets. The annualized rate of admission with VZV was 2.5 per 1000 admissions per year. The patients' ages ranged from 2 weeks to 18 years, with a median hospital stay of 8.4 days. Complication of VZV infection in normal or compromised children was the most common reason for admission in 92 (55%) patients, followed by antiviral therapy to prevent dissemination in 54 (32.5%) immunocompromised hosts. Of the 92 children with complications, previously healthy children accounted for 67 (73%), followed by 17 (18%) with underlying medical problems and 8 (9%) immunocompromised. Skin and soft tissue infections and central nervous system abnormalities were the two most common complications, with cellulitis/infected pox, and pneumonia/pneumonitis and encephalitis/cerebellitis, accounting for 40% of total. Skin and soft tissue infections and neurological complications predominated in the non-compromised patients and pulmonary complications in the immunocompromised. Severe varicella (defined as organ system involvement) was uncommon (4.8%) in non-immunocompromised children. There was only one (0.6% overall, or 1.5 per 100,000 admissions) death in a child with an underlying cardiac anomaly. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were found in an equal number of cases and comprised 92% of bacterial isolates. We conclude that the complications of VZV infections continue to cause considerable morbidity, but the manifestations vary with the overall health and immune status of the child. Together with treatment of immunocompromised children, they comprise the majority of reasons for hospitalization with VZV infections which can be monitored following introduction of the new vaccine. However, mortality is extremely low with the use of acyclovir.</page><page sequence="46">764 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 264 CLINICAL FEATURES AND OUTCOME OF CHILDHOOD OSTEOMYELITIS AT A PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL. A. Karwowska', H.D. Davies'2 T. Jadavii'2, Departments of 'Pediatrics and 2Microbiology, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta. Osteomyelitis is a significant cause of morbidity in childhood, affecting approximately 1 in 5000 children younger than age 13 years. We identified all 103 cases of osteomyelitis presenting at the Alberta Children's Hospital over the past 10 years in order to define the epidemiology, management and outcome of this disease in our population. The male:female ratio was 2.1:1 with a mean age of 6.9yrs ? 5.1yrs. The most common presenting symptoms were: decreased use of affected limb in 87 (84.5%), and fever &gt;38.5? C in 46 (44.7%) patients. The median duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 3 days. A history of trauma was given by 35 (34.0%) patients. Signs most commonly noted on initial examination were: tenderness on palpation (85.4%), swelling (57.3%), erythema (31.1%), warmth (33.0%) and decreased range of motion (34.0%). The mean total WBC on admission was 10.8 X 109/1, (range 3.8 X 109 - 39.0 X 109/i), with predominance of polymorphs and mean ESR was 44.8 (range 1 - 134). Blood cultures were positive in 28 (33.7%) of 83 patients in whom they were performed. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus, seen in 18 (64.3%) of 28 positive cultures, followed by Streptococcus pneumonia in 3 (10.7%) cases. The initial radiogram was abnormal in 44 (47.8%) of 92 children receiving the test. In contrast, 70 (85.4%) of 82 bone scans showed evidence of increased uptake in the involved bone. Thirty five (79.5%) of 44 bone biopsies or aspirates performed were culture positive, the predominant organism being S. aureus in 21 (47.7%) cases. The median duration of intravenous antibiotics was 12 days (range 1 to 56) and the median duration of hospitalization was 18 days (range 1 to 147). The majority (87.4%) of patients responded adequately to medical treatment without complications. The most common complication (5.2%) was chronic osteomyelitis; most had prior orthopedic instrumentation. We conclude that in spite of variable management, the outcome of osteomyelitis is favourable in our institution in children without prior surgical instrumentation. 265 MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME OF VARICELLA- ZOSTER (VZV) INFECTIONS IN HOSPITALIZED IMMUNOCOMPROMISED CHILDREN. S. Kuhn, H. Dele Davies,* and T. Jadavji. University of Calgary, Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH), Calgary, Alberta, CANADA. Traditionally, varicella has been regarded as a serious and potentially life- threatening infection in immunocompromised patients. Acyclovir (ACY) has been a life saving medication, however, the management (IV vs PO, duration) has varied. Using standardized forms, we reviewed the health records of all 62 immunocompromised children hospitalized at ACH between January 1983 and December 1992 for treatment of varicella-zoster virus infection with or without complications to assess underlying diagnosis and management. The annualized admission rate was 0.9 per 1000 admissions per year. Varicella represented 49 (79%) while zoster compromised 13 (21%) cases. Malignancy was the most common underlying disease and antimetabolites or steroids were the most frequent immunosuppressive agents used. Twenty eight (45%) patients were lymphopenic (ALC &lt; or = 500). Complications were noted in only 8 (13%) cases. The most common complication was bacterial superinfection (6 of 8 cases), with the lung being the most likely site (4). Four (14%) lymphopenic patients had complications. In all but two cases antiviral therapy was instituted. In these 60 children, 58 received intravenous (IV) acyclovir including 8 who completed the course of therapy orally. One patient received oral (PO) acyclovir only. A single patient was treated with intravenous vidarabine. Those who received IV acyclovir did so for a mean of 5.3 days (range 2 to 14) with a mean daily dose of 1386 mg/m2/d. When IV acyclovir was discontinued and the oral preparation given, the IV duration averaged 4.3 days (range 3 to 7) and 3.9 days PO (range I to 8). In spite of differences in the duration and route of administration of the antiviral agent, there were no cases of progression or complications arising after therapy was begun and no relapses following its completion. No deaths occurred during the study period. With early antiviral therapy, morbidity due to VZV in these patients is reduced, and modifications in its delivery and duration may not be deleterious in select patients. Further studies of oral or intravenous followed by oral acyclovir are warranted in children. 266 Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in HIV-Exposed Children. JT LOVE*, MW KLINE, G DEMMLER, and WT SHEARER, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX. Since May 1989, 15 of 454 vertically HIV-exposed or infected infants and children followed in our clinic have been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, as determined by ELISA or virus culture of the nasopharynx. At time of diagnosis, seven children had SR (seroreverter) status or were believed to be HIV-uninfected by virtue of multiple negative HIV cultures. One child had indeterminate HIV status (CDC class EN1). Two HIV-infected children had CDC class A, one had CDC class B, and four had CDC class C disease. Ages of patients ranged from three to 50 months, with a median age of 11 months. HIV-infected children required longer hospitalizations (mean nine days), and had a higher cost of hospitalization (mean $15,600, DRG cost $4,360). The mean length of stay for HIV- uninfected children was five days, and cost of hospitalization was $10,190 (DRG $4,034). Six of 11 hospitalizations for RSV infection in HIV-infected children were associated with hypoxia on presentation (defined as room air oxygen saturation less than 95%). Only one of eight HIV-uninfected children had hypoxia on presentation. No child required mechanical ventilation. Two of five children with advanced HIV disease (CDC classes B and C) required chronic oxygen therapy after hospitalization for RSV infection. Within six months, three of four children with CDC class C disease required one or more additional hospitalizations for either pulmonary exacerbation of persistent RSV infection or re-infection with RSV. No other children required repeat hospitalization. We conclude that RSV causes substantial morbidity in children with symptomatic HIV disease. 267 Mvcobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in HIV-lnfected Children Less Than 13 Years Of Age. S KIRKPATRICK*, IC HANSON, B BOHANNON, MW KLINE, HM ROSENBLATT, ME PAUL, S ABRAMSON and WT SHEARER, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX. MAC is an increasingly common infection in pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Retrospective review of 171 HIV- infected children followed since 1985 identified 17 MAC cases (15 disseminated, 2 pulmonary). MAC was the first AIDS-defining event for 3/17 patients (pts). Demographics (race/ethnicity, sex, age, HIV transmission risks) did not differ for pts with MAC compared to all HIV- infected pts. Pts with MAC identified before 1991 had a mean age at dx of 77 months (mos) compared to a mean age of 59 mos for pts dxd during or after 1991 (p=0.39). Death occurred in 11/17 pts with 9/11 directly attributed to MAC (mean survival 11 mos; median 7 mos). Immune status measured within 60 days of MAC dx was available for 16/17 pts. Overall mean CD4 count was 99/mm3. Pt CD4 counts were compared to published immune axis standards for age (National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]). Mean CD4 counts by age were 270/mm3 (range:129-410/mm3) for 0-11 mos, 183/mm3 (range:30-564/mm3) for 12-59 mos and 15/mm3(range:0-67/mm3) for &gt;59 mos. All pts met CDC criteria for severe immunosuppression (Category 3). All pts over two years of age (n=12) met the outlined adult criteria for MAC prophylaxis (CD4 &lt;100/mm3). Multicenter evaluation of HIV-infected children with MAC who are less than two years of age is necessary as CDC's Category 3 age-adjusted immune criteria could serve to define initiation of MAC prophylaxis in this age group. 268 Pneumococcal Bacteremia at an Inner-City Hospital during a Three Year Period. G.S. Turett,'" M. Shaik, J.M. Akram, S. Blum, B.A. Fazal, J. Dobroszycki, T. Hong, J.E. Justman, E.E. Telzak. Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx, NY. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of invasive bacterial disease in the United States and the incidence of resistant strains is increasing. All cases of pneumococcal bacteremia at our institution from January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1994 were identified. Abstracted data included demographics, antimicrobial resistance pattern, HIV status, CD4 count and survival, and were complete for all but 6 patients. There were 289 distinct bacteremias in 275 patients. The number of yearly episodes was remarkably constant, 95-97 cases per year. During each year, January had the most cases per month. In 1994, the first penicillin-resistant isolates were identified and comprised 7% (7/97)of that year's total. The median age of patients was 38 years (range, 1.5 months-102 years). Sixteen percent were less than 2 years old and 17% were over 50. There were 161 males (57%) and 122 females (43%); 168 were African-American (59%), 112 Hispanic (40%) and 3 white (1%). Half of the patients (n= 140) had documented HIV-infection; for the 129 (92%) with CD4 cell determinations, the median count was 150 cells/mm3 (range, 0-3,226). Of the 41 patients (14%) who expired, 22 had documented HIV- infection. In multivariate analysis, age (p=0.02) and Hispanic ethnicity (p=0.04) were associated with death. The median age was 46 years (range, 10-102 years) for those who died and 36 years (range 1.5 month - 83 years) for survivors. Among HIV-infected patients, CD4 count was also a significant predictor of death; those who died had a median count of 80 cells/mm3 compared with 168 cells/mm3 for survivors (p=0.004). Pneumococcal bacteremia remains a persistent and significant disease at our institution with a mortality rate of about 15% in those with and without documented HIV-infection. Advanced age remains the strongest predictor of death from pneumococcal bacteremia. 269 Influence of Inoculum, Culture Media and Incubation Conditions on the Activity of Meropenem, Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Fleroxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Mono- and Mixed Cultures. S.W. LEMMEN*, I. ENGELS, F.D. DASCHNER. Institute for Environmental Medicine and Hospital Hygiene, University Hospital, Freiburg, Germany. Standard laboratory susceptibility tests reflect the in vitro rather than the pathological in vivo condition prevailing within the infection site. Meropenem (M) (55 jg/ml), Piperacillin (P) (260 Ag/ml) with Tazobactam (T) (28 Mg/ml) and Fleroxacin (F) (6.8 Ag/ml) were incubated with an 24 h stationary-phase inoculum of 105 CFU/ml and 108 CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in mono- and mixed cultures. Three different culture media were used: cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), nutricient deficient M 9 broth (NDB) and active human pool serum (HPS). Incubation conditions were standard aerobic, anaerobic and CO2 (5%) enriched. Although growth of the bacteria without antibiotics was best in MHB, there was no difference of antibiotic activity detectable between MHB and HPS. After 6 h at 36?C the rank order of killing of SA, PA in mono- and mixed cultures in MHB and HPS was generally P/T followed by F and M. In NDB M produced the best activity. In summary, P/T showed best antimicrobial activity in MHB and HPS. Antimicrobial killing was worst in the NDB but M produced best activity. Not the incubation condition and the inoculum, but the culture medium had major influence on the antimicrobial activity.</page><page sequence="47">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 765 270 Septic Arthritis and Osteomyelitis Due to Penicillin-Resistant (PRSP) and Multidrug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MRSP) in a Children's Hospital. S. ABBASI, SO ORLICEK, I ALMOHSEN, RJ LEGGIADRO, G LUEDKE AND BK ENGLISH, Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a well recognized cause of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis in children, especially those aged 2-24 months. Recently, there has been an alarming increase in invasive infections due to S. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin (PRSP) and, in some cases, to multiple antibiotics (MRSP). In our center, the emergence of MRSP has led to the use of empiric therapy with vancomycin plus cefotaxime for presumed pneumoccal meningitis and for other life-threatening pnumococcal infections. However, there is only one reported U.S. case of osteomyelitis due to PRSP/MRSP. Between November 1994 - March 1995, at Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center ( LBCMC) we treated 5 patients with septic arthritis and/or osteomyelitis due to S. pneumoniae; 3/5 strains were penicillin-resistant. Case 1 (BE) had septic arthritis of the right ankle and osteomyelitis of the calcaneus due to a strain with intermediate resistance to penicillin and high-level resistance to cefotaxime. He responded well to high dose penicillin. Case 2 (TD) had septic arthritis of the left knee while case 3 (AJ) had septic arthritis of the left hip . The isolates from both of these patients had high- level resistance to penicillin and cefotaxime. Both patients were initally treated with standard antibiotic regimens for pediatric bone/joint infection (nafcillin and cefotaxime), with inadequate clinical responses. After identification of MRSP, TD was treated with 4 weeks of vancomycin followed by 2 weeks of oral clindamycin while AJ was treated with 4 weeks of therapy including vancomycin and clindamycin. Despite aggressive therapy, both patients had poor clinical responses and required repeated surgical procedures. In contrast, the previous 13 patients with penicillin-susceptible bone /joint infection (seen at LBCMC between September 1981-March 1995) all did well with rapid response to therapy. In short, PRSP/MRSP must be considered as a potential cause of bone/joint infection in young children, which may fail to respond to standard therapy. 271 Nandrolone Decanoate (ND) for HIV-Associated Weight Loss (HAWL) N. PIETROSKI*, T. ISODA, N. KASBEKAR, R. MULLEN, J. STERN. Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, PA Anorexia and cachexia is a major feature of patients (pts.) with symptomatic HIV. The mechanism of HAWL is unclear, but may be related to endocrine dysfunction. It has been noted that testosterone levels are decreased in patients with HIV wasting; testosterone replacement may be a treatment approach. We have treated over 30 pts. with ND 100mg intramuscularly q weekly. All had varying degrees of weight loss, but all were at least 5% below their usual or desired weight. Reported below is total number of months (mos.) on ND in pts. treated &gt; 3 mos., total weight (wt.) gain and percent weight gain from baseline: PT# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Total # Mos. onND: 14 5 12 4 13 17 11 5 3 3 9 Total Wt.

The only adverse effects of note were pain at the injection site, sore nipples and acne in a few pts. The mechanism of ND in promoting weight gain may be related to its anabolic properties. Further study with ND in reversing HIV-related weight loss should be undertaken. 272 Chlamydia pneumoniae in a Nursing Home: A New and Emerging Problem? C.J. TROY*, R. PEELING, A. ELLIS, D. BENNETT, M. MURPHY, J. HOCKIN, A. RIVERA, A. HEIMANN, J. CARLSON, J. SPIKA. Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; Ontario Ministry of Health, North York, Ontario, Canada. In mid-October 1994, residents of a nursing home in Ontario, Canada developed respiratory symptoms. Laboratory results showed IgM or IgG antibody titres suggestive of acute infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp). An investigation was initiated to determine the extent of the outbreak, the spectrum of symptoms and severity of illness among residents and staff, and the mode of transmission. We reviewed the surveillance records and charts of all residents (n= 133) for evidence of respiratory illness during October and November. We collected from a sample of clinically ill residents, paired sera for MIF antibody assay to Cp and nasopharyngeal swabs for DFA, PCR and culture. We also tested for a range of other respiratory pathogens. A single serum sample was obtained from all other residents and tested for Cp antibodies. We distributed a self administered questionnaire to all staff workers and a single convalescent serum was collected from staff with respiratory illness early in the outbreak. A suspected case was defined as a resident or staff with a new cough and a confirmed case as a resident or staff with a new cough and either positive serology, culture, DFA or PCR. To date, 26 cases among residents have been confirmed and 32 suspected cases identified (AR 44%). The median age was 83 years. The outbreak began on the second floor (AR=52%) and then spread to the first floor (AR=38%) and the adjoining retirement home (AR=37%). Along with a documented new cough, 67% of residents had chest congestion, 64% fever, 24% sore throat and 14% hoarseness. Three had pneumonia confirmed on chest x-ray. Cases who smoked had onset of illness early in the outbreak compared with nonsmokers (p=0.007). The staff questionnaire return rate was 60% (65/108). Illness was reported among 34% of this group. Cp caused serious morbidity among residents and staff of this nursing home. Increased availability of diagnostic tests will allow early recognition of this infection. This may permit prompt antibiotic intervention to control institutional outbreaks and prevent complications in this susceptible population. 273 The Natural History of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli (ETEC) Diarrhea Among US Travelers in Mexico. RC ARDUINO*, A MOSAVI, LM VALDEZ, J MATHEWSON, CD ERICSSON, HL DUPONT, Center for Infectious Diseases, University of Texas School of Public Health and Medical School and St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston Texas. Clinical information from 113 placebo treated US travelers to Mexico with acute diarrhea and confirmed ETEC infection was analyzed to determine the natural history of travelers' diarrhea caused by this pathogen. The mean age of group were 27.4?9.8. Fifty three percents of subjects were female and 47% were males. Abdominal pain and cramps were the most common symptoms ( 81.5% of whom 14.2% severe, 29.2% moderate, and 38.1% mild) followed by nausea (45.1%). Vomiting was present in just 15.1% of subjects. Chills were reported in 18.3% of subjects. 9.3% of subjects had gross blood in their stools and 15.9 had occult blood in their stool. Fecal leukocytes were found in 17.6% of subjects. The duration of diarrhea was assessed in two ways; time from enrollment to last unformed stool (TLUS) and time of enrollment to passage of the first formed stool(TFFS). TLUS was calculated from the time of enrollment to last unformed stool after which wellness (passage of any number of formed or no unformed stool for 48 hours or 24 hours with no enteric symptoms and no watery stools or less than or equal to 2 soft stools) was declared. TFFS was defined as the time of enrollment to first formed stool after which wellness was declared. Mean? (sd) for TLUS was 77.8+45.2 and mean+ (sd) for TFFS was 95.2 +34.1. The mean number of stools for the first and second day was 5.1? 3.9 and 3.2 ?2.8, respectively. On the average subjects passed 12.5 ?8.78 unformed stool during five days of follow up. While ETEC diarrhea in this setting was self limiting, we have previously shown that antibacterial drugs will shorten the duration of post-enrollment diarrhea (TLUS) from 78 to 30 hours. 274 The Harlem DOT Program; A Model for Treatment of Tuberculosis (Tb) Amongst Disadvantaged Populations F. Medard*, M. Dickerson, J. Roche, L. Smith and W. El-Sadr, Harlem Hospital, N.Y., N.Y. Central Harlem has one of the highest rates of Tb in the US coupled with high rates of economic disadvantage/unemployment and housing and family disruption. Completion of Tb treatment in such populations has been recognized as a challenge. In 2/1993, a DOT program was established at Harlem Hospital to enroll all patients (pts) with Tb and to ensure completion of therapy. It used an on site model to promote a sense of belonging, employed community members and persons with history of Tb infection or disease and promoted strong linkage with support services. A system was developed to rapidly respond to failure to appear for a scheduled DOT visit. A total of 284 pts were enrolled through March 1995, with 37.7% women, 59.2% with HIV coinfection, 79.9% were single and 22.9% lived in shelters. Substance use was prevalent, with 22.9% injection drug users, 34.2% heavy alcohol users, 19.7% crack users, and 21.1% multi-drug users. In response to failure to appear for a DOT visit, 1125 phone contact attempts, and 375 field visits were conducted. For pts who missed three consecutive visits, 123 telegrams were sent. The mean adherence rate with DOT visits was 92.6%. The Harlem on site model of DOT linked with rapid follow- up of missed visits has been effective in the control of Tb in pts with associated social disadvantages. DOT programs must be molded to the specific needs of the pts and the community. 275 Differentiation Among Pediatric Isolates of the Mycobacterium avium Complex by Automated Sequencing of the hsp65 Gene. D.S. SWANSON1*, N. ESEN1, V. KAPUR1, X. PAN1, M.W. KLINE1, R.J. WALLACE JR.2, R.E. MCKINNEY JR.3, M. F. DILLARD3, R. YOGEV4, C.B. INDERLIED5, W.M. DANKNER6. J.M. MUSSER1. Baylor College of Medicinel, Houston, TX; University of Texas Health Center at Tyler, Tyler, TX2; Duke University Medical Center3, Durham, NC; Northwestern University Medical School4, Chicago, IL; University of Southern California5, CA; University of California at San Diego6, San Diego, CA. Bacteria of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) cause pulmonary infections in patients with chronic respiratory disease and cervical lymphadenitis in children. Recently, MAC has assumed importance as a cause of disseminated disease in patients with AIDS. To evaluate the molecular epidemiology of MAC infections in children, a 360-basepair (bp) region of the gene (hsp65) encoding a 65 kD heat shock protein was sequenced in 61 pediatric MAC isolates. Twenty-two isolates were recovered from children with HIV infection. Of these isolates, 19 were from blood or bone marrow sources. Thirty-nine isolates were recovered from children not known to be infected with HIV. Sixteen of these isolates were from lymph node or neck mass sources, 15 from pulmonary sources, and the remaining were from various other sources. Nineteen distinct hsp65 alleles were identified. Phylogenetic analysis found that 35 isolates had one of four hsp65 alleles which clustered with sequences from known M. avium strains and 15 isolates had one of 8 alleles which were allied with known M. intracellulare strains. The 11 remaining isolates had one of 8 alleles which varied considerably from M. avium and M. intracellulare. Of the isolates obtained from HIV infected children, 77% clustered with M. avium, 14% with M. intracellulare, and 9% with species nonspecific MAC. In contrast, 46% of isolates obtained from children without HIV infection allied with M. avium, 31% with M. intracellulare, and 23% with species nonspecific MAC. Automated DNA sequencing of a 360-bp region of the hsp65 gene from MAC organisms provided a rapid and unambiguous molecular technique for improving our understanding of the epidemiology of pediatric MAC infections.</page><page sequence="48">766 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 276 Natural History of Untreated Acute Diarrhea in Mexico: Differences in Outcome by Patient Population. LM VALDEZ*, A MOSAVI, J MATHEWSON, CD ERICSSON, HL DUPONT, Center for Infectious Diseases, University of Texas School of Public Health and Medical School and St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston, Texas. We pooled and analyzed clinical data from placebo-treated subjects with acute diarrhea participating 14 therapeutic trials carried out in Mexico between 1975 and 1991. Differences in clinical outcome among short term stay (STS) travelers and travelers on long term stay in Mexico (LTS, more than six month stay) were assessed. The cause of diarrhea was comparable in both groups. The mean time from enrollment to passage of the last unformed stool (duration of post enrollment diarrhea) was 69?46 hrs. for STS, 54+44 hrs. for LTS. The number of unformed stools passed between 0 to 12 hours, 0 to 24 hours, 24 to 48 hours and 0 to 48 hours after enrollment was calculated. STS travelers passed significantly more unforned stools than the other group for the time periods analyzed. Between 0 and 48 hours the mean number of unformed stools passed was 6.9?5.7 (n=493) for the STS group, 5.5+4.3 (n=134) for LTS. When we analyzed improvement in diarrhea (defined as passage of less than 50% of unformed stools compared with pre-enrollment values), during the first and second days of study there was no difference between STS and LTS. During the second day of study, 61% of STS and 66% of LTS had improved. Bacterial pathogens were isolated in 41.3% of STS subjects and 43.2% of LTS. The interstudy differences in clinical response within each group of subjects was not great supporting use of data in future clinical studies. The study shows the clinical differences in intensity and duration of diarrhea according to the time residing in an endemic area. The data generated will be used as historical controls in future studies in the various populations examining the antidiarrheal effects of antibacterial drugs and symptomatic agents. 277 Comparison of Salivary and Serum EIAs for the Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori Infection. S. H. CHOUDHRI, J. EMBIL*, N. PEITIGREW, G. R. GRAHAME, T. ALDOR, M. FAST, G. SMART, A. KABANI, G. DUFFY and C. N. BERNSTEIN. The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Helicobacter pylori infection is strongly associated with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The objective of our study was to determine the usefulness of non- invasive antibody detection assays for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. All patients scheduled for upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy were eligible for the study. After obtaining informed consent, information about patient demographics, recent use of antibiotic or other medications, and indications for endoscopy were collected from each patient using a standardized questionnaire. Saliva and serum specimens were collected at the time of endoscopy and 2 antral biopsies were submitted for histologic examination from each patient. The Helisal?T kit (Axcan Pharma) was used for salivary EIA testing while the Pylori StatTM kit (Bio-Whittaker) was used for the serum EIAs. Both tests detect IgG directed against purified H. pylori antigen. A total of 86 patients were enrolled over a one year period from 1994-1995. At the time of this report, histology results were available for all patients while salivary EIA results and serum EIA results were available for 76 and 66 patients respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the serological tests when compared to histology are given below. Test Sensitivity Specificity PPV NPV Salivary EIA .62 .64 .58 .68 Serum EIA .61 .94 .97 .49 In summary, in our unselected population, the salivary EIA, although appealing due to its non-invasive nature, was an insensitive and non-specific test and not useful for diagnosing H. pylori infection. The serum ETA also lacked sensitivity but was highly specific and did have a good positive predictive value. Thus a positive serum EIA correlates well with H. pylori infection hut a negative test should he confired with a more sensitive test such as histologic examination of a gastric biopsy. 278 Roseomonas Central Line Infection in a Patient with HIV Disease: Case Report. A.M. ALKHAL* J.W. ROSS. Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT We describe a patient with advanced AIDS who developed Hickman catheter infection with Roseomonas spp. A 39 year old man with advanced HIV disease and an absolute CD4 + lymphocyte count of 16 cells/mm', was admitted with progressive dysphagia, left facial weakness and falling to the left side. The patient had history of aphthous esophagitis and cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis requiring Hickman catheter placement for intravenous ganciclovir. Findings on physical examination were oral thrush, a previously noted 2/6 ejection systolic murmur and hepatosplenomegaly. Neurological exam revealed a flat affect, depressed mood, left facial weakness and left upper and lower extremities weakness. There was no sign of infection at the site of the Hickman catheter insertion. Blood drawn peripherally and from the Hickman catheter were sent for culture on the day of admission.The patient was started on foscarnet for the question of CMV or HIV encephalitis. Blood cultures drawn from the Hickman catheter grew a pink gram-negative organism on the fifth day of admission that did not fit into any commonly known category of bacteria. Repeated blood cultures drawn from the central line continued to grow the same organism. Sensitivity testing showed that the organism was sensitive to piperacillin and gentamicin but resistant to ceftazidime. The organism was eventually identified as Roseomonas species. Roseomonas is a new genus of gram-negative, nonfermentative, plump coccoid rod that does not fall into any described species. The organism is different from the genus Methylobacterium and was previously included under the "pink coccoids" and is generally susceptible to the aminoglycosides, the quinolones, imipenem and the tetracyclines but is resistant to the cephlosporins and the penicillins. On review of the literature, we found six documented cases of Roseomonas infection, five of which were in immunocompromised patients but none of them had HIV disease. To our knowledge this case represents the first report of Roseomonas infection in an HIV-infected patient. 279 TRENCH FEVER IN HOMELESS PATIENTS. P BROUQUI P HOUPIKIAN, H TISSOT-DUPONT, AND D R A 0 U L T . Unite des Rickettsies, Marseille France. Trench fever is a louse-borne disease which was first recognized as a clinical entity during the 1915-1917 epidemic of this disease in Europe. The etiologic agent Bartonella (Rochalimaea) quintana has recently been involved in endocarditis and bacteriemia in homeless patients. To evaluate the exposition of homeless people to B quintana we conducted a case control study. Between october 1993 and october 1994, 7 of 43 homeless hopitalized patients (16,3%) and none of the 57 matched patients had serologic titers by microimmunofluorescence for B quintana superior to 1/100 B quintana seroposititive homeless patients were more frequently in contact with cats (p&lt;0.02). No significantly different epidemiological factors were found between the two groups. When analysed with multiple component analysis, lice ( 2/7 vs 4/36) and pruritus appeared to be more represented in the seropositive than in sero- negative homeless. This study demonstrate that the seroprevalence of B quintana is specially high in the homeless population (16.3%) and that cats and lice may be associated with this seroprevalence. 280 ASSOCIATION OF ATHLETE'S FOOT (AF) WITH CELLULITIS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY; VALUE OF BACTERIAL CULTURES TAKEN FROI THE AFFECTED IPSILATERAL INTERDIGITAL SPACE. JEFFERY D SEIEL ID, HARRY GOLDIN MD. RUSH NORTH SHORE WEDICAL CENTER, SKOKIE, IL. RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE, CHICAGO, IL. Cellulitis of the lower extremity is a debilitating infection that often evades efforts at microbiological diagnosis. AF is a common condition causing scaling, fissures, cracking, and maceration of the interdigital web space. A prospective study was undertaken to deteraine how often patients with cellulitis of the lower extremity, in the absence of trauma, peripheral vascular disease, or chronic open ulcers, have ipsilateral AF, and whether, cultures taken frol the involved interdigital interspace(s) would yield potentially pathogenic bacteria. AF was found in 20 of 24 episodes (83%) studied; only three patients had a prior history of coronary bypass grafting. Beta-hemolytic strepto- cocci were recovered in 17/20(85%) of episodes, Staphylococcus aureus in 8/20(40%), and facultative gram-negatives in 7/20(35%). Anti-streptolysin 0 antibodies were elevated in 10/16 episodes where beta-hemolytic strepto- cocci were found. In contrast cultures taken from the interdigital web spaces of 30 ambulatory subjects without cellulitis presenting with AF to the office of a deratologist, yielded beta-hemolytic streptococci 0/30(0%), Staphylococcus aureus, 7/30(23%), and facultative gram-negatives, 10/30(33%). AF may be a comon predisposing condition for cellultis of the lower extremity. When compared to previous attempts at microbiological diagnosis such as aspiration, and, or, skin biopsy and culture +/- imunoflouresence ( literature review: 26-621 ), cultures taken from the interdigital spaces of patients with cellulitis and AF lay offer a simple, non-invasive method of microbiological diagnosis. Identification of AF may aid in treatment and, or, prevention of cellulitis. 281 Survey of Clinical Training in STD and HIV/AIDS in United States Medical Schools. H.T. MACKAY'*, K.E. TOOMEY', G.P. SCHMID'. 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA., 2Georgia Department of Human Resources, Atlanta, GA. In 1991,126 medical schools in the United States and Puerto Rico were queried to determine the extent of clinical training for medical students in the areas of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDS. Responses were received from 102 medical schools. The median number of hours of clinical training in STD, by department, ranged from 1 hour (dermatology, urology and psychiatry) to 5 hours (internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology). The median number of hours of clinical training in HIV ranged from 1 hour (dermatology, urology, and family practice) to 4.5 hours (internal medicine). The departments most likely to have STD training as an explicit objective were obstetrics and gynecology (87%) and internal medicine (73%), while the least likely were dermatology (26%), urology (26%) and psychiatry (21%). Clinical training in HIV/AIDS was most likely to be an explicit objective in internal medicine (86%) and obstetrics and gynecology (68%), and was least likely in dermatology (23%) and urology (15%). A clinic specifically devoted to STD existed at 42% of institutions, and one devoted to AIDS existed at 76%, but an exclusive elective for medical students in STD or HIV/AIDS was available at only 37% of the institutions. In comparison to other topics in the curriculum, the amount of attention devoted to STD/HIV/AIDS was judged to be excessive (1%), adequate (67%) or less than adequate ( 32%). In the 10 years prior to 1991, the amount of clinical training in STD had decreased at 6% of the institutions, remained the same at 17% and increased at 77%.With 12 million cases of STD annually and nearly 1 million HIV-infected persons in the United States, clinical instruction in STD and HIV/AIDS is critically important for medical students. The results of this survey, however, suggest that the time and emphasis devoted to clinical instruction in these topics is inadequate at many institutions.</page><page sequence="49">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 767 282 Pulmonary Infections in Liver Transplant Recipients Receiving Tacrolimus (FK506) as Primary Immunosuppressive. N SINGH,* T GAYOWSKI, MM WAGENER, VL YU. VAMC, Pittsburgh, PA. Pulmonary infections have been identified as significant infections after organ transplantation. Incidence, etiology, timing, and outcome of pulmonary infections were prospectively assessed in 102 consecutive liver transplant recipients receiving the new immunosuppressive agent tacrolimus; median follow up was 930 days. A total of 16% (16/102) of the patients had 19 episodes of pneumonia; 58% (11/19) were bacterial, 37% (7/19) fungal and 5% (1/19) protozoal. Gram-negative bacteria (36%) and legionella (27%) were the predominant bacterial pathogens. Of fungal pneumonias, 57% were aspergillosis (all diagnosed histopathologically), and 43% cryptococcosis. 26% (5/19) of pneumonias were associated with empyema; Pseudomonas aertgino.sa (1), Serratia ntarcescens (1), Legionella (2), Cryptococcus (1) Median time to the onset post-transplant was 19 days for aspefgillus pneumonia, 100 days for bacterial and 209 days for cryptococcal pneumonia. One patient had histopathologically documented Toxoplasma gondii pneumonia occurring 27 days after second liver transplantation. We did not document any case ofCMV pneumonitis (all patients received preemptive ganciclovir for 7 days upon detection of CMV shedding in surveillance buffy coat/urine culture). Mortality was significantly higher for patients with pneumonia 50% (8/16) as compared to those without pneumonia 6% (6/102, p = .0004). However, only fungal pneumonias were the direct cause of death; 63% (5/8) of deaths were in patients with fungal pneumonitis. Opportunistic fungal pathogens are significant pulmonary pathogens and are associated with high mortality in liver transplant recipients 283 Correlation of Ascitic Fluid Polymorphonuclear Cell Response with Causative Bacteria in Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: A Prospective Study with Implications for Therapy. N. SINGH*, JD RIHS, T GAYOWSKI, VL YU VAMC, Pittsburgh, PA. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major complication of cirrhotic ascites. The 3 variants of SBP are: neutrocytic ascites, defined as ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) count &gt; 250 and positive culture; culture- negative neutrocytic ascites is PMN &gt; 250 but negative culture; bacterascites is PMN &lt; 250 with culture yielding a single bacterium. Symptomatic patients with SBP were prospectively enrolled using Bactec method for the culture of ascitic fluid. Of 27 consecutive episodes of SBP over 3 years, 44% were neutrocytic ascites, 33% bacterascites, and 22% culture-negative neutrocytic ascites. 43% (9/21) of isolates in culture positive SBP were gram negative bacteria {E. Coli 7, Klebsiella I. E. cloacae 1) and 38% (8/21) were streptococci (viridans streptoccci 4, enterococci 4). 89% (8/9) of bacterascites versus 8% (1/12) of neutrocvtic ascites were due to streptococci (p=.0004). Of 18 episodes of SBP with PMN count &gt; 250, 45% (8/18) were due to gram negative bacilli and 6% (1/18)due to streptococci (p=.009). Gram negative bacilli were associated with neutrocytic ascites in 89% (8/9) aid with bacterascites in 11% (1/9, p=.003). The mean ascitic fluid WBC and PMN count was 330 (range 29-700) and 109 (range 14-500) wvith streptococcal SBP versus 20,744 (range 83-115,000) and 17,933 (range 10-100,050) respectively with gram negative SBP (p=.01 for both values). The frequency of symptoms in streptococcal SBP were same as in SBP due to other bacteria and streptococci were sole pathogens in all cases of SBP due to these bacteria.. Conclusion: SBP with PMN &gt; 250 is significantly more likely to be due to gram negative bacteria and that swith PMN &lt; 250 to be due to streptococci. These data have implications for choice of empiric therapy of SBP which is frequently instituted based on ascitic fluid PMN pending cultures. Currently, cefotoxime is the recommended empiric therapy for SBP. Our data suggests that SBP with PMN &lt; 250 (bacterascites) may be empirically treated with ampicillin alone. 284 Anemia in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Patrick Sullivan, S Chu, D Hanson, J Jones. Division of HIV/AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA. Background: Anemia is a common disorder in HIV-infected persons. We studied its occurrence, associated factors, and effect on survival. Methods: As part of the Adult Spectrum of Disease Project, we reviewed the medical records of HIV+ persons &gt; 13 years of age at over 100 clinics in 12 U.S. cities every 6 months from 1/90-4/94. We defined anemia as any hemoglobin &lt; 14g/dL in men or &lt; 12 g/dL in women. Results: Among 5660 persons, the 1-year incidence of anemia was 69% in 1229 persons with AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses (AOI, or clinical AIDS), 53% in 1007 persons with immunologic AIDS (CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/pL or CD4% &lt; 14) and no AOI, and 34% in 3424 HIV-infected persons without AIDS. By logistic regression, the incidence of anemia in persons with CD4 &lt; 200/j11 was associated with bacterial septicemia (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1-29), black race (AOR 1.6, CI 1.1-2.2), CD4 value (AOR 1.5 per 50 CD4 cells below 200, CI 1.3- 1.7), thrombocytopenia (AOR 2.9, CI 1.2-6.8), leukopenia (AOR 3.8, CI 2.4-5.9), and clinical AIDS (AOR 2.1, CI 1.6-2.7). Associations with female sex (AOR 1.6, CI 1.0- 2.4) and AZT therapy (AOR 1.4, CI 1.0-1.9) were not significant. Incidence of anemia was lower in injecting-drug users (IDU, AOR 0.56, CI 0.40-0.79) than in non-IDU, and lower in those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (AOR 0.53, CI 0.43-0.74) than in those not treated. Anemia was associated with decreased survival from first CD4 count &lt; 200/lul: 2-year survival was 80% (CI 73%-88%)for nonanemic patients and 54% (CI 50?/o-58%) for anemic patients. This effect persisted after age, AZT therapy, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, clinical AIDS, WBC count, and CD4 count were controlled for. Conclusions: HIV-related anemia was associated with certain clinical conditions, stage of HIV disease, and certain host factors. Anemia was associated with shortened survival in these patients. 285 Microsporidial keratoconjuctivitis in four patients with AIDS. LAIRD K*, JAYAWEERA DT. University of Miami School of Medicine and Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, Florida. Objective: To describe the clinical manifestations of Microsporidial keratoconjuctivitis in 4 patients with AIDS, and their response to treatment. Background: Microsporidial infection is swiftly becoming an important cause of keratoconjuctivitis among AIDS patients, although it is probably underrecognised. This is thought to be caused by Encephalitozoon hellem. Case reports: All patients presented with blurry vision and tearing. Sensation of foreign body in the eye was noted by patients 2, 3, and 4. Red eye in patient 1. The CD4 counts were &lt;30 cells/mm3 in all cases. Punctate corneal erosions were seen in all patients. The diagnoses were made by millipore filter impression cytology (cases 1-3), and corneal epithelial scraping (case 4), with Giemsa stain. All patients were treated with fumagillin eye drops. Case Age/Sex Other Ols Outcome 1 37y/M CMV retinitis symptoms partially resolved 2 27y/M CNS toxo symptoms resolved 3. 22y/F CNS toxo symptoms resolved 4. 47y/M CMV retinitis, symptoms resolved MAI Conclusion: Microsporidial infection should be suspected in AIDS patients presenting with keratoconjuctivitis. Patients may be treated successfully with topical fumagillin 286 Utility of Clinical Symptoms Versus Blood Laboratory Tests for Evaluation of Acute Gastroenteritis. Y. CARMELI*, M. SAMORE, O. SHOSHANI, R. STALNIKOWITZ, Hadassah University Hospital, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, Israel (HUHMS) and New England Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Acute gastroenteritis accounts for 5% of visits to emergency wards. We studied retrospectively the usefulness of laboratory tests and clinical data for assessing gastroenteritis, and their value in decision making. Medical records of all adult patients seen in the emergency ward of HUHMS with acute gastroenteritis (excluding traveler's diarrhea) during May and June 1992 were reviewed. One hundred sixty-three cases (98 males and 65 females, age 16-83 years) were found, of which 23 had underlying comorbidities. Symptoms included vomiting (104 cases), diarrhea (151), and fever (38). Orthostasis was present in 31% of 80 patients. Urine tested ketone positive in 15 out of 116. Stool tested positive for leukocytes in 14, and for blood in 8 out of 26 tested. Blood laboratory tests were drawn in 116 cases (CBC 112, electrolytes 109), and 78 had at least 1 abnormality (leukocytosis 48, leukopenia 6, elevated BUN 18, hypokalemia 14, hyponatremia 9). One hundred and fifteen cases were treated with IV fluids, 20 with antibiotics (mostly ciprofloxacin) and 4 were admitted. Fifty-eight stool cultures were sent; 13 yielded enteric pathogens (Shigella sp. 7, Salmonella sp. 3, Enteroinvasive E. coli 2, Campylobacter 1). Stool cultures from patients with fever (&gt;37.7? C) or symptoms of longer duration (&gt; 2 days) had higher yield (57.1% vs. 11.3%, p=0.001, and 38.1% vs. 0%, p&lt;0.001, respectively). Fever was the single variable with the highest positive predictive value (57%), and when combined with long duration of symptoms had sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 65%. Intravenous hydration was more common in patients with vomiting, long duration of symptoms, orthostatic hypotension and positive urinary ketones, but not in patients with abnormal blood test results. There was no association between abnormal blood laboratory results and antibiotic treatment or with stool culture being sent or with stool culture being positive. None of the patients were hospitalized as a result of abnormal laboratory tests. We conclude that blood laboratory work-up is used often, but is very seldom contributory for evaluating domestically-acquired acute gastroenteritis. Simple clinical criteria have substantially greater utility for medical decision making and predicting stool culture positivity. 287 Successful Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) Among HIV-Negative Patients. E.E. TELZAK'*, K. SEPKOWITZ2'4, P. ALPERT3, W. EL-SADRs, F. MEDARD5, S. MANNHEIMER4, S. BLUM', G. TURETT'. 'Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center; Bronx, NY; 2St. Clare's Hospital, NY, NY;3 Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY; 'New York Hospital, NY,NY; 'Harlem Hospital Center, NY, NY. Data describing the response to therapy among HIV-negative persons with MDRTB (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) are limited. All cases of MDRTB among confirmed HIV-seronegative persons at 6 New York City hospitals were identified. Abstracted data included demographics, risk factors for TB infection, extent and verification of disease and type of and response to therapy. Therapeutic response was evaluated by both microbiologic (2 or more consecutive negative sputum cultures at least 2 weeks apart) and clinical criteria. Between March 1991 and September 1994, 24 HIV-negative patients with MDRTB were identified. Median age was 37 years and 13 (54%) were male. Fifteen (63%) patients were of African descent, 4 (17%) were Asian, 3 (13%) Hispanic and 2 white. Sixteen (67%) had established risk factors for MDRTB: 8 had inadequately treated TB, 7 were health care workers, and one had a known exposure to MDRTB. All but 3 (88%) had disease localized to the lung or pleura. Fifteen (63%) had isolates that were resistant to 4 or 5 of the first-line TB agents. All but one patient were treated with at least 3 drugs with in-vitro activity against their isolate. Twenty three (96%) patients have responded clinically and all 18 for whom data are available had a microbiologic response. Median duration of followup for the 23 responders was 73 weeks (range 17 - 201 weeks). These data indicate that HIV-negative persons with MDRTB can be successfully treated.</page><page sequence="50">768 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 288 Cytomegalovirus(CMV) Infection During Pregnancy: Fetal Resorptions and Premature Labor Associated with Increased Natural Killer (NK) Activity and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) in Guinea Pigs. C. HARRISON*. Creighton University, Omaha, NE. Primary maternal CMV infection adversely affects pregnancy outcome, presumably by infection of the placenta or fetus. However we have observed fetal growth retardation even in uninfected pups, suggesting a role for other factors, e.g. altered maternal immune responses as factors in pregnancy outcome. We evaluated in vitro TNF response to guinea pig (gp) CMV and NK activity against gpCMV targets in inbred dams (N=9 each) challenged with gpCMV (5 X 105 pfu) in 1st or 3rd trimester. 5/9 1st trimester challenges resulted in fetal resorptions (5/17 [29%] fetuses from these 5 dams) compared to controls (0/13 fetuses from 4 uninfected dams). 3rd trimester challenges resulted in premature labor on day 7-9 post inoculation in 7/9 pregnancies and increased stillborns (14/22 [64%] pups from the 7 dams) compared to controls (1/13 [8%] fetuses from uninfected dams). In the 3 wk post gpCMV inoculation, TNF levels were increased compared to controls and to challenged dams not experiencing resorptions or premature labor; and NK activity increased 5d post inoculation and remained elevated for 30d. Both 3rd trimester challenged dams that expired with fulminant hepatitis within 24h of delivery, exhibited the highest TNF levels. In the dams with resorptions or premature labor, surviving pups had elevated TNF and NK activity but lower (p &lt; 0.001) birthweights (72+8g) than controls (101+7g) or pups from less affected dams (87+6g). Cytokine and NK responses early in primary CMV maternal infection may play a role in severe pregnancy outcome. 289 The Transneuronal Spread Phenotype of Herpes Simplex Virus Type I (HSV-1) Following Murine Footpad Inoculation. J.P. ENGEL', T.C. MADIGAN, G.M. PETERSON. East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC. The mouse has served as a standard animal model of infection for the study of HSV-1 neuropathogenesis. Following inoculation into the glabrous skin of the hind footpad, virus ascends the sciatic nerve, infects subserving dorsal root ganglia, and invades the spinal cord whereupon mice develop hindlimb paralysis and death from encephalomyelitis 7 to 10 days post-inoculation. Despite the long history of this model of infection, little is known about the specific neuronal pathways and transneuronal spread of virus within the peripheral and central nervous system. Using EDTA decalcification and immunocytochemical (ICC) staining of HSV antigens in vivo, we examined serial sections of the spinal columns of 12 mice at days 3, 4, 5, and 6 post-inoculation. HSV antigen as measured by detection of ICC signal was carefully traced in the nervous system in a time- space analysis. The S1 and L6 dorsal root ganglia of the ipsilateral side were most often infected, viral antigen peaking at days 3 and 4, with a ganglionitis developing by day 5. HSV antigen was traced into the dorsal roots with penetration into the spinal cord detected at days 5 and 6. Symptomatic mice had widespread necrosis in infected cord regions. Plotting of HSV ICC signal correlated to sensory modality regions in the cord: the spinothalamic nuclei and tracts of nociception, and the spinocerebellar nuclei and tracts of proprioception (including the gracile fasciculus). Since alpha motor neurons were not involved in the infection, we postulate that paralysis of the hindlimb resulted from HSV infection of the dorsal columns (gracile fasciculus), a region known to contain the descending corticospinal tract in rodents. 290 Description of an Assay to Discriminate Among Human Sera s Capacity to Enhance RSV Infection in a Macrophage-Like Cell Line (U937). L.R.KRILOV* S.H.HARKNESS T.W.MCCLOSKEY, S.PAHWA. Cornell Univ Med Coll, No Shore Univ Hosp, Manhasset, NY. Severe RSV infection occurs at an age when maternal AB to the virus is still present. Ab to RSV can enhance RSV infection of Fc receptor bearing cell lines (eg, U937), but assays to date have been unable to discriminate the enhancing capacity of different human sera in relation to severity of acute RSV infection or RSV neutral- izing titer. We describe a fl'ow cytometry assay Dotentially capable of such discrimination. U937's were infected with RSV alone or in the presence of serial dilutions of 3 different sera. 24 i-rs after infection cells were stained for RSV antigens: After blocking with Fc fragments of human IgG, cells were incubated with monoclonal Ab to RSV and stained by sequential incubation with biotintylated antimouse IgG and streptavidin allophycocyanin (APC). After excitation at 633A emission was measured at 680A for each group of cells and compared to emission in uninfected cells as a negative control. Streptavidin ampli- fies the signal and APC's emission is beyond the autoemission of the cells (520 X) increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the assay compared to previous methods. Neutralizing titers of the human sera were defined as an 80% i in RSV titer with serum compared to the titer without serum in a plaque reduction assay. Sera from a normal adult(l), a child with acute RSV(2), and thild 3 months after RSV infection(3) were assayed in this system.

P.E. Pertel1,2 and P.G. Spear1, Department of Microbiology-Immunology and 2Division of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern University Medical School, 303 East Chicago Avenue, Searle 6-433, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Infection of cells by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is initiated by attachment of the virus to cell surface heparan sulfate. The principal viral glycoprotein mediating attachment is gC. Glycoprotein B mediates binding for virus not expressing gC and is required for subsequent penetration and virus-induced cell fusion. Penetration may also involve interaction with heparan sulfate. The aim was to obtain mutants of HSV in which gB or gC was altered in its affinity for cell surface heparan sulfate by passage of wild- type virus in soluble heparin. Four pools of virus were produced independently by passaging wild-type virus twenty times in soluble heparin. The four pools of virus obtained have phenotypes more complicated than anticipated. In addition to decreased sensitivity to soluble heparin, almost all virus in the four pools have a syncytial phenotype and the virus in the pools are relatively resistant to gD-mediated interference (expression of gD on the cell surface renders cells at least partially resistant to wild-type virus). Two gC-negative and two gC-positive variants were plaque purified from these pools. All purified variants have a syncytial phenotype. Though predicted that this phenotype would map to the cytoplasmic domain of gB, preliminary data show that this is not the case. All purified variants are approximately 10- to 50-fold less sensitive to gD-mediated interference. Though mutations in gD have been shown to confer resistance to interference, experiments have shown that mutations in gD are not responsible for this phenotype in the heparin-selected variants. Experiments are in progress to map the mutations responsible for all these phenotypes to specific proteins. 292 City-wide Surveillance for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Activity from a Regional, 335-bed, Midwest Pediatric Hospital C. CHRISTIE, A. GLOVER, N, HUTCHINSON, J. DOUGHMAN, S. REISING. Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio. Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains the major cause for lower respiratory illness in infants and young children. It causes winter epidemics and high hospitalization rates. Methods: Using active microbiologic surveillance we describe the seasonal patterns and epidemiology of RSV pediatric disease in Greater Cincinnati during 1991-1995. The population of 1.7 million is served by a single children's hospital and RSV diagnostic laboratory. Each year in October, screening for RSV is begun. Community and hospital physicians are informed of the first few positive isolates, then testing by the RSV ELISA methodology is offered four times daily. RSV positive patients are managed in cohorts in respiratory isolation. Results: During 1991-5, the number of RSV isolates was 561, 387, 447 and 614 per season, respectively. The season began during early December each year, with peak activity noted in mid-February in 1992 and 1995, and mid March in 1993 and 1994. Significant RSV activity lasted four to five months each year. One to 3% of these isolates were acquired in hospital. Nine percent (187 of 2,009) were isolated from patients in the intensive care unit. Among 614 cases in 1995, 97% were &lt; 24 months, 80% were &lt; 12 months and 7% were newborns. Conclusion: Seasonal peaks in RSV disease may be accurately predicted to plan for high bed occupancy rates in pediatric hospitals and the appropriate treatment and prevention options. 293 RNA Splicing Profiles in HIV-1 Infections:Correlation to Disease Progression. ELIZABETH A POLONIO and MANOHAR FURTADO'. Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago IL 60611. An increase in the unspliced RNA/spliced mRNA ratio is observed during acute HIV-1 infections in culture and in chronically infected cells induced by cytokines. In our analysis of transcript levels in sequentially obtained patient PBMCs; progressors whose CD4+ cell counts dropped to below 200/mm3 within 24 months post seroconversion exhibited higher unspliced/spliced mRNA ratios and higher levels of total mRNA. than nonprogressors whose CD4 + cell counts remained relatively stable (Furtado et al., J.Virology 69:2092-2100; 1995). We extended this study to determine if the levels of individual HIV-1 transcripts correlated with disease progression. We specifically amplified and quantitated the various multiply spliced mRNAs that encode tat, rev and nef. Amplifications were within the linear range and internal controls were co-amplified to correct for variations in the efficiency of reverse transcription. The cDNAs generated were resolved by PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes, probed with splice junction specific and exon specific probes and quantified. Large increases in the relative amounts of rev transcripts, moderate increases in the relative levels of tat transcripts and decreases in the relative amounts of nef transcripts were characteristic of the rapid progressors. Conversely, the relative levels of the tat, rev and nef transcripts exhibited moderate to no change in the nonprogressors. The rev transcript levels exhibited a strong inverse correlation to CD4+ lymphocyte decline. The greater increases in rev transcript levels is in agreement with the higher unspliced/spliced mRNA ratios observed in the progressors. These results imply that in addition to global increases in viral transcript levels, changes in splicing ratios can also modulate the levels of unspliced genomic viral RNA and viral replication. Splicing profiles would therefore influence disease progression. Mechanisms that can specifically alter rev transcript levels are being evaluated.

J.C.BANDRES*, T.JOSEPH, M.ARENS and L. RATNER. Washington University, Saint Louis, MO. Nef protein has been shown to be essential for viral pathogenesis in the SIV model but no data exist that correlates any of the known in vitro functions of Nef with its effects in vivo. We have isolated Nef clones from 10 patients, 5 in the Low CD4 group (&lt;500) and 5 in the High CD4 group (&gt;500), 3 from each, and tried to find any correlation between in vitro functions of this Nef clones and disease stage or CD4 count. All 30 clones were sequenced and only one patient in the Low CD4 group showed all 3 clones to result in a non-stable protein due to an early stop codon in the sequence. Otherwise there were no significant differences in sequence hetereogeneity between High and Low CD4 groups although there was a trend towards an increase in deletions and insertions in the Low CD4 group. Functional analysis of representative clones from each patient was performed in the 9 patients with stable proteins looking for effects of Nef on viral transcription (by transfecting the Nef clones in human T-cells along with HIV-CAT and IL-2 CAT constructs), CD4 downregulation (by transfecting the Nef clones into human T-cells along with VSVG and GCD4 constructs) and viral infectivity (by using the Nef clones in the MAGI cell assay to determine the effects on viral infectivity). The results showed that there was no correlation between any of the individual in vitro functions of Nef and CD4 count or disease stage. They also showed that the different in vitro functions of Nef are independent of each other and are dependent on specific Nef sequences. 295 Hantavirus Serologies in Patients with Community-Acquired Pneumonia P.G. AUWAERTER*, D. OLDACH, L.M. MUNDY, A. BURTON, M.L. WARNER, E. VANCE, R.D. MOORE, P. CHARACHE, J.G. BARTLETT and C.A. ROSSIt. The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD and tU.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a newly recognized, acute febrile illness characterized by respiratory failure, shock and high mortality. Though most identified cases have centered in the southwestern U.S. within the range of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus ), sporadic cases have occurred elsewhere. As the etiology of community acquired pneumonia remains unknown in a large minority of patients, we investigated whether rodent-borne hantaviruses, such as Sin Nombre virus (SN), contributed to consecutive cases of community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to a large, inner city hospital on the East Coast during 1990- 1991. We examined acute phase sera obtained from 385 patients with pneumonia using an ELISA technique. IgG ELISA were prepared with antigens from prototype Hantaan virus (HTN), Seoul virus (SV), Puumula virus (P360), Convict Creek Virus (HN107) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SN. Acute phase sera from patients with HPS have IgG antibodies to SN nucleocapsid protein. Of 385 sera, 8 showed some IgG reactivity with one or more of the HTN, SV or P360 antigens. Five sera were moderately reactive, and 3 sera were strongly reactive. No sera were reactive with SN or HN107 antigens. The 8 reactive (2.1%) and 7 randomly selected, unreactive sera were screened for the presence of IgM antibodies to HTN, P360 or SV. None of the 15 sera were reactive. We conclude that HPS is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia within our geographic region, and the 2.1% positive serology rate for hantaviruses was not unlike that published in other studies from our area. 296 Maternal-Infant Transmission of Zidovudine- resistant (ZDVR) HIV-1. A. J. Japour* &amp; J. Pittt. *Beth Israel Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; tCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY. A recent study has shown that ZDV treatment of ZDV-naive HIV-positive pregnant women with CD4 counts &gt; 200 and their infants is highly effective in decreasing HIV-1 transmission from mother to infant. The efficacy of ZDV during pregnancy is uncertain, however, among women who have already had previous ZDV treatment. In addition, the consequences to an infant infected with ZDVR HIV-1 are unknown. An infant born to a woman treated with ZDV for 36 months was HIV-1 culture negative at birth and at one month. ZDV was begun at three months following the report of a positive culture obtained at two months of age. The infant had a rapidly progressive course, despite the addition of didanosine (ddl) at four months, and died at six months of age. Virus isolates from mother and infant were assayed for the presence of an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene mutation (T215Y) known to be associated with ZDV resistance. Full sequence analysis of the HIV-1 RTs are in progress. Data on mother and infant generated thus far are shown below: Maternal Maternal Maternal Maternal Infant CD4 Stage ZDV (mo) Codon 215 Codon 215* 260 Asymp 36 M M Sequential specimens were analyzed for T215Y: -5 months -2 months Delivery +3 months + 5 months Mother M* M M Infant No signal M M Mat /Inf Rx Z Z/none Z/none Z/Z+d *M=Mutant; Z=ZDV; d= ddl ZDVR HIV-1 was detected in the infant at the first positive culture before the institution of ZDV. The T215Y mutant was found in the mother's first HIV-1 isolate available five months before delivery. This case documents that vertical transmission of ZDVR HIV-1 can occur. It is likely that prior maternal antiretroviral treatment may need to be considered in planning prevention strategies for perinatal HIV transmission and planning effective treatment for the infant. 297 Saturation Mutagenesis of the HIV-1 RT p3- P4 hairpin Reveals Novel Mutations Conferring Dideoxynucleoside Triphosphate Resistance. A. J. Japour*, W. Drosopoulost, N. Katapodist, P.H. Chung*, Y. Kewt, V. Prasadt. *Division of Infectious Diseases, Beth Israel Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; tDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Resistance to nucleoside analogue drugs targeted to HIV is a barrier to long term antiviral efficacy. Understanding the nature, frequency, and location of mutations in the target gene which encodes the reverse transcriptase is necessary both for rational drug design and newer treatment strategies. To better understand the role of the HIV-1 RT p3- P4 hairpin, a hot spot for drug resistance mutations in clinical isolates, the codons 63-75 of HIV-1 NL4-3 RT were randomized by cassette mutagenesis using degenerate oligonucleotides. Thirteen pools of RT sequences, each representing mutants at one codon, were ligated to an expression vector with a bacterial trpE gene, and introduced into E. coli and screened for ddATPR and ddCTPR by a modified in-situ colony assay. Thus far, &gt;1000 colonies have been screened for each codon between 70-75. Clones displaying resistance were isolated, induced for the expression of mutant RT and lysates containing the trpE-RT fusion proteins prepared. Immunoblot analysis of the induced lysates with monoclonal HIV-1 RT antibodies confirmed the stable accumulation of mutant proteins. The RT activity and resistance to ddATP and ddCTP were assessed in solution assays by incorporation of aP32-dATP/dCTP using a 1.7kB heteropolymeric template and a non-radioisotopic RT assay (RT- DetectTM/Dupont). The clones confirmed to display ddATPR were sequenced at the 5' end to determine the amino acid alteration. Mutations in the P3-P4 loop mutations conferred varying degrees of ddATPR (active metabolite of ddl). L74T/A and V75Q conferred the highest level of ddATPR and ddCTPR. Interestingly, replacement of an analogous side chain L741 lead to robust RT activity retaining wild-type ddATP sensitivity, while replacements with shorter side chains such as L74T and L74A conferred resistance, but adversely affected RT function. In contrast, lengthening and shortening side chains at codon 75 induced resistance but did not affect RT function significantly. A majority of ddATPR mutants were cross-resistant to ddCTP. 298 Herpesvirus-like DNA Sequences in Classic Kaposi's Sarcomas. P.L. RADY,+ Y. YEN,' R. W. MARTIN III,+ I. NEDELCU,+" T. K. HUGHES' and S. K. TYRING.'* University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX+., Cutaneous Pathology and Immunofluorescence Laboratory, Beachwood, Oh.," Central Military Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.++ Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) accounts for more than 15% of AIDS-related malignancies. The etiology of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is unresolved but is postulated to be multifactorial, involving viruses and overexpression of cellular growth factors and/or oncogenes. Recently, herpesvirus like sequences (KSHV) were identified with high prevalence in AIDS-KS, endemic KS and in classic KS biopsies (CKS). To confirm the presence and the prevalence of the KSHV sequences, 18 CKS and 13 AIDS-KS samples were tested using PCR analysis. To our knowledge this is the highest number of CKS samples that has ever been included in a single study, and it is also important that the tumor biopsies were obtained from different institutions and geographical locations. KSHV sequences were detected in 100% of the AIDS-KS samples and 72% of the CKS biopsies using PCR analysis. Further studies are needed to determine if KSHV is present in iatrogenic KS lesions from immunosuppressed (e.g, organ transplant) patients. However, previous investigations and our studies are strongly suggestive of KSHV being one causative agent of KS. It is also possible that this putative viral agent does not act alone, but may function together with other pathogens and/or with other, induced, cellular genetic changes to contribute to a multistep pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcomas. 299 Condylomas from HIV Seropositive Patients Demonstrate Multiple HPV Infection, Immunodeficiency and Deregulated Pattern of Growth Regulatory Genes. S.K. TYRING*. I. ARANY, P. RADY and D. PAYNE. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX Several studies have documented aggressive infections within' persons positive for the human papillomaviruses (HPV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It has been hypothesized that infection with HIV may enhance the expression of HPV and the development of anogenital epithelial abnormality. HPV viral early genes such as E6 and E7 are regularly expressed in HPV-positive lesions and are responsible for the deregulation of cellular metabolism. In the present study we investigated biopsies of condyloma acuminatum from HIV seropositive patients. Multiple HPV infection was proved by Southern blotting and PCR-sequencing. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) studies were performed in order to determine mRNA levels of genes playing a role in antigen presentation and regulation of cell proliferation. HIV positive condylomas showed immunodeficiency with low CD4/CD8 mRNA ratios, disappearance of Langerhans cells (revealed by measuring of CDla mRNA levels) and diminished HLA-B7 levels. High mRNA levels of HPV early genes (E6. E7) were also found which may account for a diminished level of p53 tumor suppressor gene, and consequently, for decreases in p53- related genes such as mdm2 and WAF-1. Hyperproliferation is associated with high levels of cdc2 kinase and basonuclin mRNAs with an abnormal keratinization pattern. A comparison with HIV negative condylomas will be presented. The role of HPV transcription in development of immunodeficiency and abnormal epithelial phenotypes will be discussed.</page><page sequence="52">770 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 300 Association of Hantaviruses with Acute Renal Disease in the U.S. M. PATNAIK*', J.A. VELOSA2, and J.B. PETER1. 1Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, CA; 2Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Hantaviruses, the etiologic agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), are distributed worldwide and have been associated with approximately 10% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in various parts of the world, including the United States. However, no definite acute cases of hantavirus-associated HFRS have been reported in the United States. In order to determine if there is an association between hantaviruses and acute renal disease in North America, serum samples (N=153) were received blinded from the Mayo Clinic and assayed for antibodies (IgG and IgM) to two different strains (Puumala and Hantaan) of hantaviruses by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Coded data revealed that 22% (34/153) of the sera had either a positive or borderline value for antibodies to hantaviruses. Of these specimens, 18% (6/34) were from patients with a diagnosis of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, 21% (7/34) from patients with necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and 18% (6/34) from patients with IgA nephropathy. The remaining 15 positive or borderline sera were from patients with various renal disorders: lupus nephritis (3), membranous nephropathy (3), diabetic nephropathy (1), amyloidosis (1), mesangiopathy (2), fibrillary nephropathy (1), acute allograft rejection (1), minimal change (1), focal nephrosclerosis (1), and chronic interstitial nephritis (1). These results indicate that 3 types of acute renal disease (acute interstitial nephritis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy) account for over 55% of the hantavirus-positive sera. As hantaviruses tend to infect vascular endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelium, our data suggest that damage to these target cells by hantaviruses may produce the basic lesion resulting in renal dysfunction in acute cases, leading to permanent tubular damage and the subsequent development of ESRD. 301 Seroepidemiology of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in Advanced HIV Disease: Influence on Disease Expression and Survival. D.H. Shepp, J.E. Moses*, M.H. Kaplan. North Shore University Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, NY. To determine the prevalence and effect of CMV co-infection on clinical outcome, the seroepidemiology of CMV was examined in 1 96 demographically diverse patients with advanced HIV disease. Thirty-six (18.4%; 95% C.I. 13.0-23.8) were seronegative; 31/36 (86.1%) were both non-black and non-homosexual. Among 182 evaluable patients, invasive CMV disease developed in 40/150 (26.7%; 95% C.I. 19.6-33.8) seropositive patients and 0/32 (0%; 95% C.I. 0-4.3%) seronegative patients (p=0.00024). Among seropositive patients, the frequency of CMV disease varied markedly according to demographic characteristics, occurring in 23/60 (38.3%) non-black homosexual men and in 7/18 (38.9% black women, but only 2/42 (4.8%) injection drug users. CMV disease occurred in 36/101 (35.6%; 95% C.I. 26.3-44.9) CMV seropositive patients with HIV acquired by sexual intercourse as compared to 4/49 (8.2%; 95% C.I. 0.5-18.9) of all other CMV seropositive patients (p&lt;0.001). The cumulative proportion of seropositive patients developing CMV disease was 5, 16, 31 and 50% at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, respectively. CMV serologic status had no effect on occurrence of AIDS-related illnesses other than CMV disease and no effect on survival. Risk for development of CMV disease varies substantially among different groups of patients with advanced HIV disease and can be assessed using serologic and demographic criteria. The results of this study may be used to influence clinical management and help target prophylactic interventions for CMV disease to high risk individuals. 302 Prevalence of Parvovirus B19 Infections in HIV Infected Adults. S.E. KLINE*', R. SCHUT2, K. HENRY3, F.S. RHAME', W. LI', M.C. JORDAN'. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN', Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN3, St. Paul Ramsey Medical Center, St. Paul, MN3. There have been a few case reports of severe anemia caused by Parvovirus B19 in HIV infected patients. Mild to moderate anemia is common in HIV infected patients, especially those with advanced disease. We wondered if chronic parvovirus viremia was a more common cause of anemia in HIV+ and AIDS patients than had previously been realized. We did a stratified cross- sectional serologic survey of 152 HIV+ patients at 3 HIV clinics. Approximately 50 patients were recruited from 3 different CD4 count strata (&lt; 200, 200-500, &gt; 500). Patients had Parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG antibodies tested, viral DNR was sought by PCR, and hematologic studies were performed. Overall, 93/152 patients (61.2%) had Parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies, similar to the general population, and 22/152 (14.5 %) had Parvovirus B19 IgM antibodies. Serologic results by CD4 strata are shown: CD4 Count IgG Abs IgM Abs &gt; 500/mm3 29/52 (55.8%) 5/52 (9.6%) 200-500/mm3 34/52 (65.4%) 12/52 (23.1%) &lt; 200/mm3 30/48 (62.5%) 5/48 (10.4%) Only 4/152 (2.6%) patients had a positive PCR for Parvovirus B19 DNA (2 with CD4 &gt;500, 2 with CD4 200-500), and none of these 4 patients had significant anemia. Hemoglobin range in these 4 patients was 12.7-16.4 g/dL. In summary, parvovirus viremia is an uncommon event in a stratified cross-sectional survey of patients attending an HIV clinic. Also, the patients with parvovirus viremia were not significantly anemic. 303 Identification of a Novel Member of the Flaviviridae Associated with Human Hepatitis of Unknown Etiology. T. P. LEARY, J. N. SIMONS, G. J. DAWSON, T. J. PILOT-MATIAS, A. S. MUERHOFF, J. C. ERKER,' M. L. CHALMERS, S. L. BUIJK, R. A. GUTIERREZ, C. A. HEYNEN, C. R. KYRK, S. M. DESAI, and I. K. MUSHAHWAR. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL. Eight to 20% of post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis cannot be attributed to hepatitis C virus (HCV) or other infectious or chemical agents, suggesting the existence of an as yet uncharacterized non-A, non-B, non-C agent. Recently, two novel flavi-like viruses have been isolated from the GB hepatitis agent, GB virus A (GBV-A) and GB virus B (GBV-B) (Simons et al., PNAS 92:3401-3405, 1995). GBV-A and/or GBV-B immunopositive human sera were screened by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for flavivirus- like sequences using degenerate oligonucleotides capable of amplifying HCV-1, GBV-A or GBV-B. A 322 nucleotide sequence was isolated from a West African sample that was 59, 54, and 48% identical to GBV-A, HCV-1 and GBV-B sequences, respectively. In addition, similar sequences were detected by RT-PCR in seropositive individuals from North America and North Africa diagnosed with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology. Consistent with being derived from an RNA virus, this sequence was not detected by PCR without prior reverse transcription, and was not detected in the genomes of humans, Rhesus monkeys, S. cerevisiae, or E. coli. We have extended this sequence by PCR based techniques using nucleic acids isolated from the West African sample. Overlapping cDNA clones were generated and the nucleotide sequence was then determined. The 322 nucleotide sequence appears to be derived from a positive-strand RNA virus (designated GBV-C) of approximately 9 kb in length. GBV-C contains a large open reading frame which, when translated, exhibits amino acid identity over its entire length of 48, 28 and 29% with those of GBV-A, GBV-B and HCV-1, respectively. The detection of highly related sequences in individuals with non-A, non- B, non-C hepatitis suggests that this novel member of the Flaviviridae may be responsible for some cases of non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis. 304 Is There a Relationship Between Folate Levels, Squamous Intra- epithelial Lesions, and Human Papillomavirus Infection in HIV Infected Women? RA CLARK* Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA It has been postulated that folate deficiency can influence the risk for squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) by facilitating the incorporation of human papillomavirus (HPV) at fragile chromo- somal sites. To determine if low serum folate levels are associated with SIL or HPV expression in HIV infected women, the charts of 51 HIV+ women were retrospectively reviewed. The asso- ciations between categorical variables and mean folate levels were determined by ANOVA methods. Forty percent of the cohort had SIL ever diagnosed and 26% were noted to have HPV effects on at least one Pap smear. The mean serum folate level for the cohort was 9.4 ng/ml (range 1.6 ng/ml to 20.0 ng/ml). Mean serum folate levels stratified by pap smear results are shown below. Never SIL Ever SIL N p 9.0 ng/ml 8.8 ng/ml 48 &gt;.10 Never HPV Ever HPV N p 9.9 ng/ml 6.4 ng/ml 48 &lt;.03 Although low folate levels were not associated with SIL, there was a statistically significant association with HPV expression. Larger pro- spective studies are warranted to examine the true relationships between folate, HPV expression, and SIL in HIV infected women. 305 Genomic Organization of GBV-A and GBV-B: Two New Members of the Flaviviridae Associated with GB-Agent Hepatitis. A. S. MUERHOFF, T. P. LEARY, J. N. SIMONS, T. J. PILOT-MATIAS, G. J. DAWSON, J. C. ERKER, M. L. CHALMERS*, G. G. SCHLAUDER, S. M. DESAI, and 1. K. MUSHAHWAR. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL. GB-agent hepatitis was originally described in 1967 by Deinhardt et al. who inoculated tamarins with serum from a human hepatitis patient (initials G.B.). These investigators demonstrated that animals inoculated with GB serum, and animals from subsequent serial passages, showed biochemical and histological changes consistent with hepatitis. Later passage experiments demonstrated the agent possessed characteristics consistent with a virus. Additional experiments indicated that the GB-agent was distinct from HAV and HCV. We have utilized representational difference analysis to clone genomic fragments from two viruses associated with GB-agent hepatitis (Simons et al., PNAS 92:3401-3405, 1995). The viruses, GBV-A and GBV-B, have positive-strand RNA genomes of 9493 and 9143 nucleotides and possess large open reading frames potentially encoding polyprotein precursors of 2972 and 2864 amino acids, respectively. Their genomes are organized much like those of pesti- and flaviviruses with structural genes located at the 5' end and nonstructural genes at the 3' end. They exhibit 27% amino acid sequence identity with each other across their entire open reading frames. Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region show that GBV-A and GBV- B are most closely related to the hepatitis C viruses, followed by the pestiviruses, carmoviruses, and finally the flaviviruses. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis of the helicase region show that they are also related to the potyviruses. Across their entire open reading frames GBV-A and GBV-B exhibit approximately 50% amino acid sequence similarity (28% identity) with that of HCV-1. The degree of sequence relatedness between GBV-A and GBV-B and other Flaviviridae members demonstrates that the GB-agents cannot be considered genotypes of HCV and may represent a new virus group or groups within the Flaviviridae.</page><page sequence="53">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 771 306 Identification of Immunogenic Regions in Three Novel Flaviviruses Associated with Human Hepatitis. T. J. PILOT- MATIAS,* J. N. SIMONS, S. L. BUIJK, A. S. MUERHOFF, T. P. LEARY, S. M. DESAI, G. J. DAWSON, J. C. ERKER, M. L. CHALMERS, G. G. SCHLAUDER, and I. K. MUSHAHWAR. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL. Recently two novel flavi-like viruses (GBV-A and GBV-B) were identified from the GB hepatitis agent and the genomes were extended and cloned using PCR walking techniques (Simons et al., PNAS 92:3401-3405, 1995). A third novel flavi-like virus (GBV-C) was identified in GBV-A or GBV-B immunopositive human sera by reverse transcription-PCR using degenerate primers capable of amplifying GBV-A, GBV-B or HCV (see T. P. Leary et al. poster). Overlapping clones covering virtually the entire genomes for each of the three GB viruses have been expressed in E. coli as fusions with CMP-KDO synthetase (CKS). Each clone was expressed as a CKS fusion in all three frames and the appropriate reading frame for each was identified by anti-CKS Western blot. Bacterial lysates were subjected to Western blots with sera from tamarins infected with the GB hepatitis agent, and also with human sera from various individuals with non A-E hepatitis. Immunogenic regions were identified in the putative core, NS3, NS4, and/or NS5 proteins for each of the three viruses. Many of the clones identified as encoding immunogenic proteins were quite large. To more finely map the epitopes, smaller overlapping clones were generated by PCR. The immunogenic regions within these clones were identified by expression and Western blotting as was done with the larger clones. The use of three-frame CKS fusion expression has allowed us to rapidly identify immunogenic regions encoded by three new flavi- like viruses associated with human hepatitis. Several immunogenic regions from each of the three viruses are being used in ELISA assays to screen various panels of sera from individuals with non A-E hepatitis to identify those who may have been exposed to one or more of the GB viruses. 307 Prevalence of Antibodies to Hantaviruses in Guillain-Barre Syndrome. J.W. TERRYBERRY*, M. PATNAIK, M. SALEM, H.-C. LIN, and J.B. PETER. Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, CA. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating, peripheral neuropathy that has been variably associated with numerous antecedent infections. However, only certain pathogens are strongly associated with triggering anti-myelin autoimmunity in GBS. Recently, there have been reports of GBS with evidence of antecedent Hantavirus infection, but the frequency of hantavirus-specific antibodies in GBS populations is unknown. To determine the prevalence of antibodies to hantaviruses in GBS, sera from GBS patients (N = 115) were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies to recombinant nucleoprotein antigens of hantaan and puumala viruses by EIA. Sera from 23 patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy and 15 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculo- neuropathy, and sera from 100 healthy adults served as neurological disease and normal controls, respectively. Only 4/115 (3.5%) of the GBS sera had IgG and/or IgM antibodies reactive to hantaviruses. Two had IgG antibodies alone (1 puumala and 1 hantaan), 1 had only IgM antibodies against puumala virus and 1 had both IgG and IgM antibodies reactive to puumala. None of the control sera had antibodies reactive against either hantaan or puumala viruses. These data, together with the previously reported association of GBS with puumala virus-related Nephropathia epidemica, suggest that GBS occurs as a sequelae of previous infection with puumala virus although this is not a common event. The significance of this association remains to be elucidated. 308 An Unusual Patter of Hepatitis B (Hep B) Serology in HIV-lnfected Patients. A ANDRADE*, C BEISER, LS MAGDER. The University of Maryland at Baltimore (UMAB), Baltimore, MD. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of an isolated Hep B core antibody (cAb) in HIV-infected patients in an inner-city HIV clinic and to compare its prevalence to that of a + Hep B cAb and a + Hep B surface antibody (sAb) in terms of stage of HIV disease, demographics, risk factors, and hepatitis C (Hep C) serology. An isolated Hep B cAb is an thought to be unusual in the general population who has been previously infected with Hep B. METHODS: 307 charts of HIV-infected patients attending the HIV clinic at the UMAB were randomly selected and reviewed. Data were collected on demographics, risk factors, clinical status, hepatitis B (Hep B) serology and Hep C serology, among others. Hep B serology included Hep B cAb, Hep B sAb, and Hep B surface antigen (Hep B sAg), all measured by Abbott ELISA. Hep C serology was also performed using an Abbott ELISA. RESULTS: 259 patients had complete Hep B serologic data. Of these 63% were intravenous drug users (IVDUs), 11% were homosexual, and 18% were heterosexual non-IVDUs. 88% were black and 12% were white. 59% were men. Median CD4 count was 281. Four main pattems of Hep B serology were found with the following frequency: I. Hep B cAb -, Hep B sAb -, Hep B sAg -: 66 (25%) II. Hep B cAb+, Hep B sAb+, Hep B sAg -: 61 (23%) III. Hep B cAb+, Hep B sAb -, Hep B sAg -: 99 (38%) IV. Hep B cAb+, Hep B sAb -, Hep B sAg+: 26 (10%) The difference in frequency between patter II and pattem III was significant (p = .043). Of those with any positive Hep B serology, 51% had Hep B cAb only. 63% of those with pattern II compared with 81% of those with pattern III were IVDUs (p = .01). 90 charts had complete Hep C data. 10/21 (48%) of those with patter II compared with 26/29 (90%) of those with pattem III had antibodies to Hep C (p = .001). The mean weight of those in pattern II was 70.0 kg compared to 65.5 kg for those in pattem III (p = .048).There were no differences between pattems II and III in mean CD4 counts, frequency of diagnosis of AIDS, race, sex, or frequency of Hep B vaccine (data not shown). CONCLUSIONS: An isolated Hep B cAb is the predominant pattem among our patients with HIV. This pattern is associated with Hep C antibodies, IVDU, and lower weight, but not with stage of HIV disease. 309 Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-lnfected Marmoset Cells Transfected with an Activated c-myc Oncogene Do Not Form Lymphomas in Mice with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID Mice). B. Z. KATZ*, B. SALIMI. Children's Memorial Hospital, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois. EBV has been associated with several malignant pro- cesses in man, most notably Burkitt lymphoma in previ- ously healthy individuals and lesions resembling large cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas in immunocompromised trans- plant recipients. SCID mice are exquisitely susceptible to the development of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative lesions following the inoculation of EBV-infected human lymphocytes. Recently, we reported that EBV-infected marmoset cells do not form lymphomas in SCID mice. Because Burkitt lymphomas are characterized by an activated c-mvc oncogene, we transfected a plasmid containing activated c-mvc (gift of R. Della-Favera) into EBV-infected marmoset cells (FF41). Despite over-ex- pression of the c-mvc protein as seen on immunoblot when probed with a monoclonal antibody (Chemicon), none of 8 SCID mice inoculated with 5x10" c-mvc expressing FF41 cells developed lymphoma. Thus, cells that overexpress c-mvc and harbor EBV do not form lymphomas even in severely immunocompromised hosts. Funded, in part, by the Elsa U.

AJAM VAN DER VEN', L JACOBS, PP KOOPMANS, JWM VAN DER MEER. University Hospital Nijmegen, the Netherlands. A central role for TNF in the course of HIV infection has been implicated by numerous in-vitro studies. Elevated serum levels of sTNFR p55 and p75 in patients with HIV infection were documented. We investigated whether apart from sTNFR also IL1-RA increases in HIV infection. Analysis of plasma samples from 26 healthy controls and 24 HIV seropositive patients (CDC stages II,III,IV) demonstrated that plasma IL1-RA levels correlated with sTNFR p55 and p75 concentrations; R=0.80 for both correlations. Correlation coefficient of sTNFR p55 and p75 was 0.94. Plasma levels (mean conc. + SD) of sTNFR p55 and p75 and IL1-RA were significantly different between HIV seropositives with CD4 counts ranging 150-600 and &lt;150 (p&lt;0.02), as well as with controls (p&lt;0.0003): CD4 count sTNFR p55 sTNFR p75 IL1-RA number &lt;150 4.6 t 2.7 13.2 ? 8.8 0.75 ? 0.43 1 2 150-300 2.7 ? 0.6 6.7 + 2.2 0.32 ? 0.09 6 300-600 2.7 + 0.8 6.9 + 2.4 0.34 ? 0.2 6 Controls 1.8 ? 0.4 3.0 ? 0.7 0.18 ? 0.06 26 These data suggest that the upregulation of cytokine antagonists is not limited to TNF only but is a more general phenomenon of activation.</page><page sequence="54">772 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 312 Foamy Virus Seroprevalence in African Monkey Hunters. P.A. GOEPFERT*, G.D. RITTER, B.H. HAHN, and M.J. MULLIGAN. The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL. Foamy viruses are a family of retroviruses that infect a wide variety of mammals. Although the first human isolate was obtained in 1971, the pathogenic potential of this virus remains uncertain and has not been clearly associated with any disease. A higher seroprevalence has been reported in African populations which may be due to exposure/infection to related simian foamy viruses endemic in primates. We therefore sought to determine the seroprevalence of simian or human foamy virus (HFV) in a group of West African monkey hunters. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing HFV Gag or Env polyproteins were used to co-infect H9 cells. Subsequent labeling was performed with 3H-leucine and cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with sera from monkey hunters, normal human, HFV-infected humans, or chimpanzees (provided by P. Fultz). The protein samples were then heat-denatured and separated with SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Chimpanzee sera immunoprecipitated a glycoprotein of 130 kD representing the HFV Env precursor while HFV-positive human sera immunoprecipitated both gpl30 and p74 (representing the HFV Gag polyprotein). Preliminary results revealed that none of the normal human or monkey hunter sera demonstrated the presence of either of these two bands. This preliminary data shows that West African monkey hunters are not commonly infected with simian or human foamy viruses. Therefore although foamy virus infection of humans has been reported to occur as a rare zoonosis among primate center or laboratory workers, we have not identified naturally occurring infections among naturally exposed monkey hunters in this study. The above data will be presented along with results of foamy virus seroprevalence studies among other human populations. 313 Influenza Virus Infection among Hospitalized Adult Immunocompromised Patients with Leukemia. HASAN YOUSUF*, ESTELLA WHIMBEY, ROBERT COUCH, MICHAEL ANDREEFF, VICTOR LEWIS, CHARLES KOLLER, JANET ENGLUND, JEFFREY TARRAND, GERALD BODEY. The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. The role of influenza in the etiology of acute respiratory disease in adult patients with leukemia is not well documented. During a one year period from October 1993 to October 1994, we prospectively sampled the respiratory secretions from all hospitalized adult patients with leukemia with an acute respiratory illness. We found that during an 11 week period from November 9, 1993 to January 29, 1994 when influenza was present in the community, influenza virus was isolated from 15 (34%) of 44 such patients. Three of these infections were acquired nosocomially. In 12 (80%) patients, the infection was complicated by pneumonia, with an associated mortality of 33%. All 4 patients who died had chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Autopsies were performed on 2 of these patients, which revealed changes consistent with viral pneumonia in both cases, and concurrent candida pneumonia in one case. During the one year surveillance period, only one other case of influenza was identified (in 4/94). We conclude that during community outbreaks, influenza is an important cause of serious respiratory illness among myelosuppressed hospitalized adult patients with leukemia. Since potentially effective prophylactic and therapeutic regimens are available, it is essential that these infections be recognized promptly. 314 Wintertime Community Respiratory Virus (CRV) Infections among Hospitalized Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Recipients. ESTELLA WHIMBEY*, RICHARD CHAMPLIN, ROBERT COUCH, JANET ENGLUND, DONNA PRZEPIORKA, VICTOR LEWIS, NADIM MIRZA, HASAN YOUSUF, JAMES GOODRICH, JEFFREY TARRAND, AND GERALD BODEY. The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. We conducted a prospective surveillance study to determine the role of CRV in the etiology of acute respiratory illness in adult BMT recipients hospitalized during the winter. From Nov 1, 1992 through May 1, 1993 and Nov 1, 1993 through May 1, 1994, respiratory secretions were sampled from all hospitalized adult BMT recipients with an acute respiratory illness. During the 2 winters, a CRV was isolated from 37 (36%) of 102 patients and 30 (26%) of 115 patients, respectively. Approximately half (49%) of these infections were due to RSV; the remainder were due to influenza virus (18%), picornavirus (18%), parainfluenza virus (9%), and adenovirus (6%). 58% of these infections were complicated by pneumonia, with an associated mortality of 51 %. With RSV, the pneumonias were almost exclusively viral in origin and associated with a 100% mortality if not treated promptly with anti-viral therapy. With the other viruses, such as influenza, many of the pneumonias appeared to be either self-limited viral pneumonias or secondary bacterial pneumonias responding to anti-bacterial therapy. During the winter, CRV are a significant cause of acute respiratory illness in hospitalized adult BMT recipients and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. It is important to anticipate these illnesses so that appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures can be instituted. 315 Phialophora verrucosa (PV) Causing Fatal Pulmonary Hemorrhage in a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Patient. T.S. LUNDSTROM*, M. FAIRFAX, J. VAZQUEZ, P.H. CHANDRASEKAR, S. ABELLA, C. KASTEN-SPORTES. Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, Ml. Phialophora is a dematiaceous fungus that can be isolated from soil and wood. Phialophora species can cause mycotic keratitis, cutaneous infections, and prosthetic valve endocarditis. We report a case of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage in a 42-year old female undergoing allogeneic BMT. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was diagnosed in 2/94, and induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine (ara-C) was given. During consolidation therapy she developed Xanthomonas maltophilia bacteremia and sternal osteomyelitis. She underwent BMT on 9/29/94 after a preparative regimen of busulfan and cytoxan, while receiving prophylactic norfloxacin and fluconazole. Post-BMT events included: D +2 neutropenia, D +4 Clostridium ramosum bacteremia, D + 19 Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia, D + 25 supraglottic edema with airway compromise, D +48 backup marrow infused, D +54 blood tinged secretions from tracheostomy, chest CT scan negative, D + 64 bone marrow engraftment, D +68 laryngoscopy revealing bilateral vocal cord edema and a black eschar on the posterior wall of the trachea at the site of impingement of the balloon, D +63 Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia and D +74 death due to pulmonary hemorrhage and exsanguination. Liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) was given from D +33 to D +72 for febrile neutropenia unresponsive to broad spectrum antimicrobials (total dose of 14,782 mg). Autopsy revealed acute hemorrhage in the trachea, both bronchi, left lower lobe and right middle/lower lobes as well as a 4.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 area of granulation tissue on the posterior wall of the trachea with fungal hyphae on histopathology. Post-mortem cultures of right lung and tracheal tissue grew a fungus identified morphologically as PV. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to AmB was 0.1 mcg/ml. This is the first case to our knowledge of invasive PV leading to pulmonary/tracheal hemorrhage in a BMT patient. The patient expired despite a large cumulative dose of LAmB, susceptibility to AmB, and recovery of neutrophil count. PV adds to the growing list fungi causing invasive disease in immunocompromised hosts. 316 Phaeohyphomycosis in Cardiac Transplant Recipients: Response to Itraconazole. T.J. Babinchak*, E.B. Rotheram, M. Slifkin. Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann University, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA. Phaeohyphomycosis is the term used to describe infections caused by the dematiaceous (darkly pigmented) fungi. Clinically these infections include mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, keratitis, and others. The etiologic agents are also numerous and varied in their classification often producing confusion among clinicians. We describe three cases of mycetoma in recipients of orthotopic heart transplants. Infection occurred as a late manifestation six months, five years and six years following transplantation, respectively. All patients had received OKT3 induction therapy at the time of transplantation, and were maintained on cyclosporin, prednisone, and azathioprine. Patient one presented with darkly pigmented nodular lesions on the foot and ankle which had been increasing over a period of months. Gram stain revealed a poorly organized grain with dark irregular hyphae. Culture was positive for Exophila jeanselmei (Phaeoannellomyces elegans, synanomorph). Patient two presented with a erythematous nodular lesion of the right knee and the acute onset of patellar bursitis. Culture of an aspirate of the bursa grew Exophila jeanselmei. Patient three presented with an indurated, erythematous, painful area in the right thigh which was initially treated as a cellulitis. Biopsy of the lesion, however, revealed characteristic darkly pigmented hyphae. None of the patients had evidence of disseminated disease. Patient one had no response to fluconazole but rapid clearance of his lesions with itraconazole 400 mg daily for three months. Relapse occurred six months after discontinuing itraconazole, but promptly improved after its reinstitution. Patients two and three had rapid resolution of their lesions with itraconazole 400 mg daily. Because of its effects on hepatic metabolism, cyclosporin levels required adjustment while on itraconazole. The optimal duration of therapy remains to be determined. 317 Endovascular Infections due to Phialophora species. M.T. SEVILLE, J. NERAD, and N. KIRMANI'. Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois. Phialophora species are dematiaceous fungi found on soil and vegetation which rarely cause human disease. Subcutaneous abscess or granuloma, usually from inoculation with plant material, is the most common clinical manifestation. Disseminated Phialophora infection is extremely rare and generally seen in immunosuppressed hosts. We report a case of a 56 year old male admitted with a 2 week history of fever, night sweats and dyspnea. He had undergone aortic and mitral valve replacement (AVR and MVR) 3 years prior to admission. An echocardiogram revealed aortic valve vegetation, and blood cultures grew Phialophora richardsiae. At surgery, an aortic vegetation and a large ventricular abscess were found; both subsequently grew P. richardsiae. Despite therapy with amphotericin B, he developed a cerebral hemorrhage and expired. Only 2 other cases of endovascular infection, both fatal, have been reported. One, a diabetic male with an AVR and MVR, presented with endophthalmitis. Blood cultures grew P. richardsiae which were considered to be contaminants. He was subsequently readmitted with endocarditis, and blood cultures and both prosthetic valves grew P. richardsiae. The other case had multiple chest wall abscesses and a hip abscess which grew P. parasitica, and had an infected thrombus in an abdominal aortic aneurysm on autopsy. She reported her hand being pricked with a rose thorn in the past. All 3 cases occurred in immunocompetent hosts. Skin involvement was present in only 1 of the 3 cases. Despite antifungal therapy and surgery, all 3 succumbed to their infection. Phialophora species are a rare and fatal cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis and endovascular infection, and should be considered particularly in patients who present with a history of inoculation of plant material.</page><page sequence="55">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 773 318 Treatment o; Sporotrichosis with Fluconazole. C. KAUFFMAN , P. PAPPAS, D. McKINSEY, R. GREENFIELD, G. CLOUD, W. DISMUKES, &amp; others in the NIAID MYCOSES STUDY GROUP. U. Michigan &amp; VAMC, Ann Arbor, MI &amp; U. Alabama, Birmingham, AL. The most efficacious treatment regimen for sporotrichosis has not been determined. In this multi-center study, 30 patients with culture- proved sporotrichosis were treated with fluconazole at doses of 200, 400 or 800 mg daily. 24 patients received 400 mg; 4, 200 mg, &amp; 2, 800 mg. 14 had lymphocutaneous, 13 had osteo- articular, 4 had pulmonary, &amp; 1 had pericardial sporotrichosis (2 had both osteoarticular &amp; visceral sporotrichosis). 11 had received prior unsuccessful therapy with a variety of antifungal agents. For lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, 9/13 (69%) evaluable patients had a successful out- come. For pulmonary sporotrichosis, no patient was cured - 1 persisted, 1 progressed, &amp; 2 improved. For osteoarticular sporotrichosis, 3/12 (25%) evaluable patients were cured; 3 progressed, 3 persisted, 2 relapsed, &amp; 1 had cure of tenosynovitis but progression of pul- monary disease. Thus, fluconazole appears to be less efficacious than itraconazole for treatment of lymphocutaneous, osteoarticular, and visceral sporotrichosis. 319 Chronic Suppression of Sporotrichosis of a Prosthetic Knee with Itraconazole. D. J. DEHART* and S. GUDIPATI. Michigan State University, College of Human Medicine--Saginaw Cooperative Hospitals, Saginaw, MI. Osteoarticular sporotrichosis is an indolent progressive disease often leading to joint destruction and further dissemination. Amphotericin B has been the drug of choice, with doses of 2-3 grams resulting in a 50-60% cure rate. We report a case of chronic infectious arthritis of the knee leading to joint replacement 2 years prior to the microbiologic diagnosis of sporotrichosis. A 56 year old male experienced pain and swelling of the right knee in November of 1987. Two arthroscopies, an arthroplasty and subsequent drainage procedure over a 5 year period were all negative on culture. Subseqently, a drainage procedure yielded Sporothrix schenckii. The fungal testing laboratory of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in San Antonio reported the organism sensitive in vitro to amphotericin B and itraconazole. Amphotericin B was administered to 2.4 grams, and the patient has remained on itraconazole 200 mg orally since that time (&gt;2 years). Therapy was discontinued at 18 months, but 3 weeks later pain, swelling and drainage recurred. These symptoms resolved promptly on resumption of itraconazole, but a sinus tract persists. Recent reports have suggested that itraconazole is effective in the treatment of osteoarticular sporotrichosis. Though clinical cure has not been accomplished, oral itraconazole has suppressed infection involving a prosthetic knee joint for 2 years. The drug has been well tolerated, joint function is preserved and there is no clinical evidence of dissemination or developing drug resistance. Itraconazole may be useful for long term suppressive therapy of sporotrichosis involving a prosthetic joint when other interventions fail or are poorly tolerated. 320 An Outbreak of Lymphocutaneous Sporotrichosis among Nursery Workers Associated with Sphagnum Moss Topiaries: Clinical Aspects. RA. HAJJEH*, C.M. LICITRA, S.M. MCDONNELL, S.E. REEF, M. HANKINS, L. KAUFMAN, M.M. MCNEIL. CDC, Atlanta, GA, the Orlando Regional Medical Center, Orlando, Florida, the State of Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, Tallahassee, Florida. Lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis (LS) is an infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. We describe the clinical aspects of an outbreak of LS that occurred among workers involved in production of sphagnum moss topiaries at a nursery in Florida, between March and May 1994. Nine workers, of whom 7 were male, developed skin lesions characteristic of LS during that period. When serum specimens from the 9 LS patients were tested for S. schenckii antibodies by the slide agglutination method, five had a titer of&gt; 1:8 and four had a titer of 1:4. Three additional male workers developed LS in November 1994, also related to contact with a topiary. On initial presentation, lesions involved both upper extremities equally; lymphadenopathy was detectcd in 11/12 patients and lymphangitis in 3/12. S. schenckii was isolated from lesions in 10/11 patients cultured. S. scltenckii also grew from sphagnum moss used in topiary production at the nursery. The mean time between initial presentation and diagnosis was 19 days (1-38 d). Potassium iodide (SSKI) was the initial antifungal therapy administered to 11 patients, of whom one was lost to follow-up; one person was treated with itraconazole. Before LS was diagnosed, 8/12 patients received at least one other antibiotic. One person was hospitalized because of severe cellulitis. Treatment of all 11 patients followed was continued until final resolution of lesions, which took an average of 49 days (22-74 d). In 8 patients who completed treatment with SSKI, the average treatment duration was 46.5 days (22-71 d). Side effects from SSKI included acne (5/10), increased salivation (5/10), nausea (3/10), and headache (3/10). Two patients had to discontinue receiving therapy with SSKI, one because of severe headaches, and another because of slow response to therapy; these two patients were then treated with itraconazole. SSKI continues to be an effective, cheap and well tolerated treatment for LS. Physicians should be aware of LS in patients presenting with ulcerative skin lesions, who have an occupational or recreational exposure to sphagnum moss. 321 Successful Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis with Amphotericin B Colloidal Dispersion (ABCD). Report of Four Cases. G. VALERO* and J.R. GRAYBILL.Univ TX Health Science Ctr, San Antonio, TX. We report four cases of cryptococcal meningitis treated with ABCD. All patients were initially given conventional Amphotericin B (AB) but because of nephrotoxicity were switched to ABCD 4mg/kg/day (case 4 received 6mg/kg/d). Only one patient received Flucytosine (5-FC) initially. Case 1 Heart transplant, transbronchial biopsy culture positive. AB for 7 days (total 200mg), initial CSF latex cryptococcal agglutination test (LCAT) 1:120, culture negative (lumbar puncture performed after 6 AB doses). Given ABCD 260mg/d for 6 wks. CSF LCAT 1:20 at wk 5. Relapsed 5 wks after treatment completion (fungemia). Refused further intervention. Died. Case 2 Liver disease, AB for 6 days (total 200mg), 5- FC for 2 wks. Initial CSF LCAT 1:8940, culture positive. Given ABCD 400mg/d for 8 wks. CSF LCAT 1:1580 at wk 8; 1:120 three months later. Asymptomatic 8 months after treatment completion. Case 3 Chemotherapy for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, AB for 7 days (total 442mg), initial CSF LCAT 1:10, culture positive. Given ABCD 340mg/d for 6 wks. CSF LCAT negative at wk 6. Died two wks later of chemotherapy complications. Case 4 Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, bronchoalveolar lavage culture positive.lnitial CSF LCAT 1:70, culture positive. AB for six days (total 320mg). Given ABCD 500mg/d for six wks. CSF LCAT 1:5, culture negative at 6 wks. Lung cavity resolved, asymptomatic 1 month after ABCD therapy completion (on fluconazole maintenance). Amphotericin B levels drawn simultaneously from both serum and CSF during ABCD therapy. Case 2 obtained during wk 4, 32hrs after a dose were 0.54mcg/ml and none, case 3 obtained during wk 2, 7hrs after a dose were also 0.54mcg/ml and none, case 4 obtained during wk 2, 2hrs after a dose were 1.1 mcg/ml and none respectively. Contrary to a report of AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis treated in Germany (ICAAC 1992 abstract 1209), ABCD was not only well tolerated at a higher dose (4-6mg/kg/d versus 3mg/kg/d), but also demonstrated efficacy in these patients despite undetectable CSF drug levels. 322 Candida albicans possesses genes that share homology with the ATP-binding cassette of human MDR P-glycoprotein. TJ WALSH*, M KASAI, A FRANCESCONI, SJ CHANOCK. National Cancer InsL, Bethesda, MD. Emergence of resistance of Candida albicans to antifungal triazoles is increasingly recognized as an important cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients. Multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins analogous to the human MDR P- glycoprotein have been identified as possible mediators of drug resistance in Plasmodiumfalciparum and Leishmania species. In this regard, we considered the possibility that the presence of MDR-like genes may contribute to the mechanisms of drug resistance in C. albicans. We therefore sought to identify potential target sequences that may be derived from candidate genes that share homology with the ATP binding cassette (ABC) of the human MDR P-glycoprotein. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the published sequence from the ABC region of the human MDR P-glycoprotein were used to amplify PCR products within the range of 100 bp in length from C. albicans isolates (3 susceptible to triazoles and 3 resistant). Sequence analysis of individually subcloned PCR products revealed 34 separate sequences. The results of our study identified fourteen clones (with at least one per isolate) with a high degree of homology to the ABC of the human MDR P- glycoprotein. Sequence analysis revealed homology to other transport proteins, as well as non-MDR proteins with virulence and drug targeting potential. Several homologies are summarized: Gene Clone# p-value Homology Human MDR P- 103-4 3.3x10-7 74% glycoprotein, Chromosomal 180-1 9.5x10-7 67% hemolysin (E. coli) Elongation Factor 3 156-6 0.04 58% (C. albicans) PhotolyaseDNA 198-1 0.0002 66% repair (E. coli) As the BLAST search did not disclose homology to a previously identified C. albicans MDR gene (CDRI), these findings suggest that C. albicans may possess more than one MDR-like gene. The diversity of homologous genes suggests that ABC sites may be a common motif in a family of genes and may provide a basis for detection of new genes in pathogenic fungi. The ABC region of key proteins may provide a novel molecular target for new antifungal compounds. We conclude that C. albicans possesses candidate genes that share homology with human MDR P- glycoprotein, E. coli hemolysin, and E. coli photolyase and that these proteins, if expressed in C. albicans, are potentially useful antifungal targets. 323 Prevalence of Fluconazole-Resistant Candidiasis (FRC) in HIV-infected Patients. JR MAENZA, WG MERZ, MJ ROMAGNOLI, JC KERULY, RD MOORE, JE GALLANT*. Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and causative organisms of FRC in AIDS patients. To compare a differential growth media (Chromagar) to standard fungal culture media. Methods: Oral fungal cultures were obtained from 100 consecutive HIV-infected outpatients with CD4 counts less than 200. Results: Of the 100 patients, 64 had positive fungal cultures (including 21 patients on antifungal therapy): 38 C.albicans (CA) alone, 16 mixed cultures including CA, 6 C. glabrata alone, 2 other single organisms, and 2 other mixed cultures. In 23 (36%) of the 64 patients with positive cultures oral thrush was present at the time of culture. No cases of thrush were due to a non- albicans organism alone. In 26 (41%)of the 64 positive cultures an organism showed a fluconazole MIC &gt; 8: twelve of these patients had active thrush. In 13 isolates from patients taking fluconazole the MIC was &gt; 8; eight of these patients had asymptomatic colonization (7 with non-albicans species, 1 with borderline-resistant CA) and 5 had thrush (all with CA). In comparison to standard culture media, additional species of yeast were identified on Chromagar in 16 patients: there was no correlation between these additional species and active thrush. Conclusions: The prevalence of both clinical and asymptomatic FRC is substantial in this population. Candida albicans was the only organism associated with thrush, both in general and in the setting of fluconazole resistance.</page><page sequence="56">774 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 324 DISSEMINATED FUSARIOSIS: AN EMERGING BUT NOT ALWAYS FATAL INFECTION IN THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOST Gompf SG, Carney MC, Hiernenz JW, Tummala R, Greene JN, Elfenbein GJ. H.Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida. Disseminated fusariosis is emerging as a serious infection in the immunocompromised host, particularly in those with hematologic malignancies and after bone marrow transplantation. Historically, disseminated fusarium infection in this patient population carries a dismal prognosis. A restrospective chart analysis of 12 patients with Fusarium infection at our institution between 1988 and 1995 revealed 8 patients with hematologic malignancy and 4 with solid tumors; 6 of these patients had undergone bone marrow transplantation. Male: female ratio was 1:2. Of the isolates 5 patients had positive skin biopsies from nodular lesions, 4 had positive nasal and sinus cultures, 2 had positive bronchoalveolar lavage cultures, and 2 had positive blood cultures. Symptoms included 2 patients with documented myalgias. On physical examination 6 patients had mucositis, and 1 had documented onychomycosis. All but 1 had central venous catheters. Radiologically those patients with sinusitis had maxillary involvement. The 2 patients with positive bronchoalveolar lavage cultures had consolidation or interstitial infiltrates on roentgenogram. Of the 12 patients, 9 were neutropenic with WBC &lt; 500 at the time of diagnosis. Average duration of neutropenia prior to positive culture was 9 days (range 0-30 days). All were on prolonged courses of broadspectrum antibiotic therapy, usually with 5 or more agents, however, 9 out of 12 were not on antifungal therapy at the time of positive culture. Of the 12 patients only 6 died, 2 with known Fusarium infection at the time of death. In conclusion although Fusarium infection is increasingly important in this population of patients; it may not always represent fatal infection. Further study of the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disseminated fusariosis in the immunocompromised patient is warranted. 325 Scedosporium inflatum. Another Cause of Fungemia and Skin Lesions. E. BOUZA*, L VEGA, P. MUIOZ, J. BERENGUER, A. ESCUDERO and M. RODRIGUEZ-CREIXEMS. Hospital General Universtario "Gregorio Marafi6n". Madrid. Spain. Scedosporium Inflatum is a hyalohyphomycete, which is occasionally responsible for local infections in normal hosts. Disseminated disease has been reported in severely immunocompromised humans but blood isolation has only been anecdotally published. We describe the case of a patient with Scedosporuum inflatum fungemia and review 9 other cases of fungemia caused by this microorganism reported in the literature. Mean age of patients was 52 years and 6 were women. Overall, 7 cases were reported from Spain and the remaining 3 from Australia. Nine patients had an hematologic malignancy and 7 were neutropenic at the time of infection. Half of the cases presented nodular skin lesions and 5 had lung infiltrates. Disease was disseminated in 8 out of 10 cases. S. Inflatum was readily recovered in blood cultures and was easily identified by its flask-shaped annellides. All isolates in which the data is reported (including ours) were resistant to amphotericin B and most to azole derivatives and other antifungals. All but our case died during the episode. Our patient was treated with amphotericin B (despite "in vitro" resistance) and G-CSF, followed by oral Itraconazole. She improved in conjunction with bone marrow recovery. Scedosporlum Inflatum should be considered as another cause of fungemia and skin lesions in severely compromised patients. Curiously cases have so far only been reported in Spain and Australia. 326 Efficacy of UK-109496 (UK), a New Azole Antifungal Agent, in Experimental Invasive Aspergillosis (IA). D. GEORGE, P. MINITER, and V.T. ANDRIOLE*. Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT. IA causes significant morbidity and mortality in immuno- compromised patients despite currently available therapy. Newer therapies with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity are needed to improve outcome of IA. Our immunosuppressed, leukopenic rabbit model of IA has been used to evaluate newer antifungal agents. In this study we compared a new azole antifungal agent, UK, in oral doses of 10 or 15 mg/kg given 8 hourly for 6 days to controls in both lethally (10? A. fumigatus conidia [AFC]) or sublethally (105 AFC) intra- venously challenged rabbits. Efficacy was assessed by mortality, quantitative organ cultures of liver (Lv), kidney (K), lung (Lg) and brain (B), and level of aspergillus antigen (Asp Ag) in serum. UK serum levels were also measured by bioassay. Treat- IA Deaths/ Asp Ag Mean log cfu/gm ment Model Total ng/ml (range) Lv K Lg B None L-106 4/4 970 (230-2500) 3.3 3.1 2.3 0.5 UK 10 " 0/10 17 (0-1650) 2.3 2.3 1.9 0.3 UK 15 " 0/10 3 (0-172) 1.0 2.0 NT 0.3 None SL-105 2/4 370 (147-800) 3.2 1.2 1.8 0.5 UK 10 " 0/10 16 (0-46) 0.8 0.9 1.9 0.2 UK 15 " 0/10 13 (0-23) 0.5 0.7 1.2 0 Both doses of UK eliminated mortality, reduced the tissue burden of AF by 10 to 100 fold in Lv and K and to a lesser degree in Lg and B, and decreased or eliminated Asp Ag in serum. TA UK was 2+ to 3 hours. UK did not accumulate even after 15 doses. UK has efficacy in this experimental model of aspergillosis and should be evaluated further for the treatment of IA. 327 IL-12-Stimulated Anticryptococcal Activity in Natural Killer Cells from HIV Patients: Inhibition by Antiperforin Antibody. C.A. HORN* and R.G. WASHBURN. Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. Interleukin-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine produced by phagocytes and B cells that enhances T- and NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and induces those lymphocytes to produce cytokines. Perforin is a 70kD glycoprotein believed to be one of the major effector molecules mediating target cell lysis by NK cells. Since IL-12 enhances NK activity of PBMCs from HIV+ individuals against K562 target cells, we examined whether IL-12 could also stimulate anticryptococcal activity, and whether the effect could be blocked by a specific antiperforin antibody. NK cells (&gt;90% CD56+) were preincubated for 18 hr under the following conditions: (1) NK cells alone, (2) NK cells +IL-12 (50 U/ml), and (3) NK cells + IL-12 + antiperforin antibody. Cryptococci were then added to cell preparations to achieve an effector:target ratio of 100:1 and the incubation was carried out for an additional 24 hr. Growth inhibition was expressed according to the following formula: [Control CFU-Exp CFU]/[Control CFU] X 100 = % Inhibition. Results are shown below: % Inhibition (Mean ? SEM: n = 5) NK alone 16?5% NK + IL-12 70?9%* NK + IL-12 + a-Perforin Ab 26?11% *D&lt;0.05 for comparison of NK + IL-12 to the other 2 conditions. These data demonstrate that IL-12 enhances NK-mediated anticryptococcal activity in cells from HIV+ individuals and that the activity can be blocked using a specific anti-perforin antibody. 328 A Prospective Multicenter Surveillance Study of Funguria in Hospitalized patients. H Gallis*, J.Vazquez, C. Kauffman, A. Karchmer, D. McKinsey, A. Mosher, J. Lee, et. al. and the Mycoses Study Group, Charlotte, NC. Ten Medical Centers participated in a prospective study of randomly selected patients with one positive (&gt; 1000 col.) culture for yeast species. Over the course of 18 months, 861 patients were enrolled and each was to be followed for up to 10 weeks. Some of the sites were involved simultaneously in a prospective, randomized, blinded study of fluconazole (FLU) vs. placebo in funguria. Fifty-two patients from that study were randomly selected as part of this surveillance study and received coded study drug (see below). Sixty-six percent of the patients were from medical and 28% were from surgical services. Eighty-three percent had indwelling urinary devices (foley 85 %, intermittent cath 5%, suprapubic cath 2%, nephrostomy 2%). Over 90% of patients had received prior antibacterial agents. Outcomes are presented on 527 patients who had a follow-up culture, 246 who were treated with antifungal agents and 281 who were not. Those treated received AMB irrigation 30%, FLU po 26%, FLU IV 14%, coded study drug 14%, AMB IV 13%, Keto po 2%, and other 2%. Overall, funguria resolved in 54%, persisted in 34%, and recurred in 12%. Resolution occurred in 64% of patients receiving any form of therapy, in 51% receiving no antifungal agent, and in 51% who had a catheter change or removal. Systemic fungal infection was diagnosed in 7 patients, 4 with persistent UTI and 3 with recurrence. Patient outcomes at 10 weeks: 20% died of underlying diseases, 16% were lost to follow-up, 8% had a decline in health status, and 0.4% died of systemic fungal infection. Indwelling urinary devices were changed more frequently in patients whose funguria recurred or persisted after treatment. 329 Interleukin-12 Does Not Restore Proliferative Responses to Fungal Antigens in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) from HIV Seropositive Individuals. T.S. HARRISON*, SM. LEVITZ. Boston Univ. Med. Ctr., Boston, MA. Production of IL-12 was recently reported to be deficient in PBMC from HIV-infected donors, and addition of IL-12 was found to restore proliferative responses to HIV and influenza antigens in PBMC from HIV-infected individuals. After experiments demonstrating that IL- 12 p40 mRNA is expressed by PBMC from normal donors in response to Cryptococcus neofonnans and Candida albicans, we examined whether addition of IL-12 could restore proliferation in cells from HIV positive donors in response to fungal antigens of importance in HIV disease. PBMC (105) from 10 HIV donors (CD4 counts 40-450, mean 222) were stimulated with 105 heat-killed C. neoformans, 105 Candida albicans yeast forms, and, in 5 patients, 105 Pneumocystis carinii cysts, with or without the addition of rIL-12 (20U/ml - final concentration). Cells were also stimulated with PHA (Sug/ml) with or without IL-12. Proliferation was assessed after 7 days for fungal antigens and after 3 and 7 days for PHA. As expected proliferative responses to fungal antigens were reduced. All donors, however, maintained proliferation in response to PHA. Consistent with previous reports, IL-12 caused prolongation of proliferation in response to PHA: at 3 days IL-12 had no effect on proliferation, whilst at 7 days significantly increased proliferation was seen in IL-12 treated cells. However, in response to the fungal antigens tested addition of IL-12 did not result in increased proliferation. Varying the concentration of IL-12 and increasing the duration of the assay to 12 days did not alter this result. Thus, we have found no evidence that IL-12 can restore proliferative responses in PBMC from HIV seropositive donors to 3 fungal antigens of importance in HIV disease.</page><page sequence="57">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 775 330 Fungal Reactive Armor: Redox Buffering by Melanin. E.S. Jacobson* and Joann Hong, McGuire Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia. Since leukocytes attack pathogens with strong oxidants, melanin, an extracellular redox buffer required for virulence, is of great interest. We showed that this substance neutralizes oxidants and protects the melanized fungi, Cryptococcus neoformans, Wangiella dermatididis and Alternaria alternata, from killing by hypochlorite and by permanganate. Maintenance of the reducing capacity of melanin may thus be an important defensive function of the pathogen. In studies of iron assimilation, we found that C. neoformans secretes an extracellular Fe(III) reductant (which we characterized as alpha-ketoglutarate, AKG) and also reduces Fe(IIl) directly at its cell membrane at a rate seemingly greater than needed for nutrition. In the present work, we tested whether AKG and Fe(I) are able to reduce melanin. Electroactive melanin was deposited onto a glassy carbon electrode and subjected to voltammetric measurements of its capacity to accept electrons. This capacity was increased by conditioning with known oxidants and reduced by conditioning with known reductants. Since conditioning with Fe(II) or the secreted reductant, AKG, reduced the capacity of melanin to accept electrons, we concluded that these substances reduce melanin, themselves. The oxidation-reduction states of suspensions of artificial melanin and of biomelanin on live Cryptococcus were followed by optical absorption. Stoichiometric quantities of oxidants darken melanin, while reductants lighten it. Fe(II) or AKG (10 mM) reduced light absorption by artificial melanin; AKG (lOmM) reduced light absorption by melanized cultures of the wild-type strain, B-3502. We infer that C. neoformans is capable of active reduction of extracellular melanin, through generation of reducing equivalents in the extracellular space. 331 Experimental Systemic Cryptococcosis in SCID Mice. KARL V. CLEMONS,* RAYMOND AZZI, and DAVID A. STEVENS. Santa Clara Valley Med. Ctr, Calif. Inst. for Med. Res. and Stanford Univ., San Jose and Stanford CA. Cryptococcus neoformans causes serious disease in both normal and immunodeficient hosts. To further examine the susceptibility of SCID mice to infection with C. neoformans, we established a model of systemic disease to better mimic the human AIDS setting. Five- to 6-week-old female C.B-17/IcrTac-scidDF (SCID) and C.B-17/IcrTac immunocompetent congenic control mice were used. Groups of 12 SCID and 10 control mice were infected i.v. with either 1 x 105, 2.5 x 104, 6 x 103 or 1.5 x 103 viable yeasts of C. neoformans 9-759. Both SCID and control mice were susceptible to lethal systemic infection in a dose-responsive manner with 90 to 100% succumbing to infection. Comparison of each inoculum group of SCID and the controls showed that SCID mice were at least 16-fold more susceptible (i.e. time to death) than were immunocompetent controls (P &lt; 0.01- 0.001). Histopathologic assessment indicated that the C.B-17 mice had a more muted infection than did SCID mice, with a granulomatous response present in at least the spleen. SCID mice had severe infections with multiple large cryptococcal abscesses throughout the parenchyma of organs; the brain had widespread meningeal involvement and organisms in the parenchyma. SCID mice showed no evidence of a cellular host-response; no other infectious agents were visualized in SCID tissues. To evaluate this model for therapeutic studies, SCID mice were infected i.v. with 1125 viable C. neoformans and treated for 10 days with 5 mg/kg/day of fluconazole (BID dosing, PO). One day later, the burden of C. neoforntans in various organs was determined. Fluconazole-treated mice carried lower burdens than untreated controls in the spleen, liver, kidney and lungs (P &lt; 0.01); no treated mice had detectable infection in the lungs versus 2 of 10 untreated controls. The mean burden of recovered CFU from the brains of treated mice was lower. Comparison with treatment of immunocompetent mice reveals SCID mice to be less responsive to therapy. These results indicate that a model of systemic cryptococcosis with meningitis in SCID mice has potential utility in the study of the immunology, immunotherapy and chemotherapy of this disease in the severely immunocompromised host. 332 Fungiuria in cancer patients: Analysis of risk factors, clinical presentation and outcome in 50 patients E. Oravcova, J. Lacka, L. Drgona, M. Studena, L. Sevcikova, P. Koren, E. Kukuckova, I. Gould, E. Grey and V. Krcmery Jr. Postgrad. Medical School, Department of Chemotherapy Department of Medicine, University of Tmava, Tmava, Slovakia Dept of Microbiology, Aberdeen Royal Hospital, Aberdeen, UK We analysed 50 fungiuric patients in a 60 bed cancer centre within 5 years. More than 10 000 CFU per mL, dyzuria and leukocyturia were the enrolment criteria for this retrospective study. We observed, that 72% of cases were caused by C. albicans and 28% by non-albicans Candida spp. and non-candida spp. yeasts (C. krusei, C. tropicalis, B. capitatus). T. glabrata, the second most frequently observed pathogen in fungal UTI's was not found among our patients. The most frequent risk factors were: Antibiotic therapy with more than one antibiotic (96%), concomitant fungal infection in other localisation than urinary tract (36%), cathetrisation with Foley's catheter or iepllrostomy (46%), colonisation with other or same species (48%), prophylaxis with quinolones (50%), sex (males - 52%), previous therapy with corticosteroides (72%). Structural or anatomic malformations of the urinary tract (26%), neutropenia (28%), antifungal prophylaxis (22%) with azoles, diabetes mellitus (12%) were less frequently seen, however reported to be at risk by another studies. Most of risk factors were more frequently observed in those with fungiuria due to other organisms than C. albicans (colonisation in another localisation, ATB therapy with 4 and more antibiotics, prophylaxis with azoles, urinary catheter, nephrostomy, structural malformation, fungal infection out of urinary tract). 83,3% of patients, treated with systemic antifungals were cured and 16,7% failed. Analysing deaths, only 3 were due to fugal infection. There was no difference in death rates due to underlying disease with fungiuria in those treated with antifungals as in those not treated at all, where fungiuria is often a terminal sign of rapidly fatal underlying neoplastic disease. 333 Fungemia at a Community Hospital: An Epidemiologic Assessment. D.G. KRAMER*, G.D. BOSTIC, M.B. PERRI, J.D. BAND. William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI Rates of fungemia have increased markedly in recent years and currently account for more than 10% of all nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI's). Debilitated and compromised hosts are at highest risk especially if exposed to prolonged broad-spectrum antimicrobics. C albicans is the predominant pathogen and is usually susceptible to both fluconazole and amphotericin. To define our incidence and populations at risk, as well as the distribution of pathogens and their susceptibilities, we reviewed our experience at a large community hospital. From 1991-1994, 208 patients with fungemia (incidence 13.3 per 10,000 discharges) were identified. Fungi accounted for 3.6% of positive blood cultures including 13% of all nosocomial BSI's. Affected patients were frequently immunocompromised (solid tumor 23%, lymphoma/hematologic malignancy 8%, AIDS 4%) or had underlying GI disease (24 %). Nosocomial acquisition occurred in 70% of cases. Eighty-two% of patients received recent antimicrobics. The most common portal of entry was an indwelling vascular device. C. albicans accounted for 56% of our isolates followed T. glabrata 18%, C. parapsilosis 10%, C. tropicalis 10% and other yeast 6%. Twenty five blood isolates underwent susceptibility testing. Fluconazole was active against 19 (76%) isolates; resistance was demonstrated in 1 of 10 isolates of C albicans/C. parapsilosis, 2 of 9 isolates of C. tropicalis and 3 of 6 isolates of T glabrata or other yeasts. Amphotericin was uniformly active against all yeast. Amphotericin should still be considered the agent of choice for undefined fungemia. Like other centers, our incidence of fungemia, especially due to species other than C albicans, is increasing. 334 Immunoblot Analysis of the Serological Response to Candida albicans in HIV-lnfected Patients. AC REBOLI* and N. PATEL. Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA. PURPOSE: To evaluate the antibody response to the various antigenic determinants of Candda albicans in HIV-infected patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunoblotting (Western blotting) was used to study the candidal serology of 50 HIV-infected patients, 40 AIDS patients and 10 patients with CD4+ counts &gt; 500/pL who were clinically well. Serum samples were collected serially over a 2 year period. Demographic data consisting of age, sex, history of opportunistic infections, history of candidal infections, CD4+ count, and white blood cell count were recorded. RESULTS: The most frequent antibody produced was to the 48-kd antigen, candida enolase. Percentaae of HIV Infected Patients with Antibody to Enolase Status (# of Patients) IgG IgM AIDS (40) Oral candidiasis (34) 65% 76% Esophageal (8) 66% 83% Vaginal candidiasis (15) 100% 100% Candidemia (3) 0% 0% No Candida clinically (2) 100% 100% HIV+ (10) 50% 50% Vaginal candidiasis (4) 75% 75% Twelve of the AIDS patients were neutropenic. All had mucosal candidal infections. None of these patients demonstrated an IgG antibody response. Four (33%) had an IgM response. CONCLUSIONS: AIDS patients with mucosal candidiasis mount an antibody response to various antigenic determinants of C. albicans which may protect them from the development of candidemia. When they become neutropenic they fail to mount an IgG response and a small percentage mount a weak IgM response. 335 The Role of Surveillance Cultures in Predicting Serious Candida Infection in the Surgical and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. PATTERSON JE*, WIBLIN T, RANGEL-FRAUSTO S, DIB JC, PFALLER M, RINALDI M, WENZEL RP &amp; the NEMIS Study Group. Univ. of Texas Health Science Center and Univ. of Iowa, San Antonio, Texas and Iowa City, Iowa. Candida infection in the intensive care unit results in prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Prospective cohorts of surgical (SICU) and neonatal ICU (NICU) patients in 6 university medical centers were studied for 1 year with surveillance cultures of stool and urine (SICU) and of stool (NICU) performed on admission to the ICU and weekly thereafter. The rate of serious Candida infection was 5.7/1000 patients in both groups (45/7914 in SICUs; 17/2956 in NICUs). Colonization status prior to infection was evaluated in 5088 SICU patients and 1795 NICU patients. The utility of at least one positive yeast surveillance culture (stool or urine) for predicting infection due to the same Candida species is shown below. Odds ratio compares risk of infection in colonized versus non-colonized patients. Unit Sens Spec PPV NPV Odds Ratio SICU 34% 74% 0.9% 99% 1.47 NICU 73% 80% 2.2% 99% 10.9 Colonization by the same species on two occasions preceding serious Candida infection did not significantly change predictive value. Although the positive predictive value of surveillance cultures was low, colonized patients were at higher risk than non-colonized patients for serious Candida infection in both the surgical and the neonatal intensive care unit.</page><page sequence="58">776 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 336 Histoplasmosis as a Cause for CD4+ T-Lymphocytopenia in Patients without AIDS. *Elliot Goldstein, Daniel R. Hinthorn, Purushothama Dasaraju. Kansas University Medical Center, K.C., KS. CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of less than 300/mm3 are rare in the absence of AIDS or other diseases associated with immunodeficiency or immunosuppressive therapy. Reviews of cases of idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia include occasional patients with systemic fungal infections. As an extension of this observation, we measured CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts prospectively in four patients with disseminated histoplasmosis who did not have AIDS or underlying immunodeficisncy disease. These four patients had persistently low CD4+ counts (&lt;400/mm3) which in two patients were &lt;300/mm thereby fulfilling the criteria for idiopathic CD4+ T- lymphocytopenia. We conclude that rather than being rare, very low CD4+ T-cell counts including ones &lt;300/mm3 that satisfy the criteria for idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia occur commonly in patients with disseminated histoplasmosis who do not have AIDS or other immunocompromising condition. 337 Sporothrix schenkii: Atypical Features in an HIV- infected Patient. W. GREAVES*, A ROSARIO, B. PETERS, R. DELAPENHA and W. FREDERICK. Howard University Hospital, Washington, DC. Reports of Sporotrichosis in patients infected with HIV are rare. To date only 13 cases have been reported. Dissemination and poor response to therapy were the predominant features in most of the cases. We recently cared for a patient with S. schenkii fungemia with atypical features. Case: A 30 year old black, HIV seropositive female injection drug user was admitted to the hospital 11/19/94 for complaints of fever, cough and shortness of breath. She denied skin rash and headaches. Her medications on admission were Zidovudine and Ciprofloxacin. The physical exam was significant for a temperature of 100?F, generalized lymphadenopathy, needle tract marks on neck and arms and diffuse rales on lung auscultation. Diagnostic evaluation revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates on Chest Xray and ABG with pH 7.45, pCO2 39.2 mm Hg, pO, 40 mm Hg, and CD4+ count of 262 cells/mm3 (20%). Echocardiogram was normal. Bronchoscopy revealed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) on BAL and chronic interstitial pneumonitis on biopsy. Sputum, urine and BAL cultures all grew C. albicans. The patient received three days of oral fluconazole for yeast in the urine and 19 days of intravenous Bactrim for PCP. On discharge, her oxygenation had improved and her chest Xray showed significant clearing. She was discharged on anti-tuberculosis medications pending final mycobacterial cultures. Following discharge one set of blood cultures drawn on admission were reported positive after four weeks for S. schenkii. Currently (three months after discharge) she is doing well without signs or symptoms of disseminated disease. She is due to return for repeat blood cultures. This case represents a unique presentation of S. schenkii infection in an HIV positive patient: fungemia, lack of constitutional symptoms, high CD4+ count with opportunistic infection, and apparent response without therapy. 338 Primary Cutaneous Aspergillosis (PCA) in Neonates. M. PAPOULI, E. ROILIDES*, E. BIBASHI, A. ANDREOU. Depts of Neonatology and Microbiology, Hippokration Hospital; 3rd Pediatric Dept., U. Thessaloniki, Greece. Aspergillus spp. can cause serious invasive infection in immunocompromised patients. Aspergillosis confined to the skin is less well known condition and occurs in patients with various underlying diseases. We describe a 26-wk premature boy with PCA and we review the English literature. Case report: The neonate was born after 4-d membrane rupture and was mechanically ventilated due to RDS. He suffered from pneumothorax (d2), convulsions (d4), blood-culture negative sepsis (d13) andStaph. aureus septicemia (d20). The infections were treated with appropriate antibiotics. On d30, while he was in good condition, he manifested a red area 0.5x0.5 cm over his tibia that rapidly increased and evolved to dark red plaque with raised edges and pustules on it. On this place the cable of an oximeter had been fixed with adhesive tape. Drainage of pustules gave pus that on Gram stain showed many neutrophils and dichotomously-branched septate hyphae. Culture grew Aspergillus fumigatus. Tibia x-ray was normal and there was no physical or laboratory findings of generalized aspergillosis. Building renovation occurred near NICU at that time. The patient received total 6.7 mg/kg AmB and is now well. Review: Five neonates with PCA have been reported in the literature (MEDLINE). The 5 infants and ours (last) are summarized below: Age(d)BW Pr.Abx Steroids Otherrisks Ap.so.

Due to risk for dissemination, PCA should be treated vigorously with active systemic antifungal agents. The outcome of PCA, if treated appropriately, appears to be favorable. 339 Comparative Analysis of Genetic Variabilty Among Candida albicans Isolates from Different Geographic Locales by Three Geno- typic Methods. K. HOLMBERG*, F. FEROZE, LV. CLEMONS and DA. STEVENS. The Nat. Univ. of Singapore, Singapore and Stanford Univ., 8tanford, CA. The objective of this study was to conduct a comparative genetic analysis of a substantial number of Candida albicans isolates from the United States (U.S.), Europe and Southeast Asia in order to test whether genotypic differences between isolates might be associated with geographic locations. The genotypes of 86 unrelated C.albicans isolates from the U.S. and Europe and 26 isolates from Singapore were examined by three DNA typing methods: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), and random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD). Computer-assisted methods (ProScan MW-RFLP and Dendron) were used for analysis of gel patterns, calculation of similarity values (SAB) among isolates based upon band positions, and generation of dendrograms based on (SAB) values for all isolates. A dendrogram based on the overall similarity of REA (EcoRI-digested Calbicans DNA) patterns clustered the U.S. and Europe isolates in two major groups. Interestingly this phylogenetic grouping was identical to that obtained by a previously proposed typing system designating these isolates into subtypes IA and IB dependent on the presence of a 3.7 or a 4.2-kb band. A subset of 32 (31%) isolates assigned by this system as a predominant DNA subtype IA2 were in the dendrogram contained within a single large cluster with SAB values &gt;0.90. The Singaporean isolates demonstrated unique REA profiles. Nine isolates had profiles characterized by both the 3.7 and the 4.2 kb bands or neither of these bands. In a combined dendrogram based on the overall similarity of REA profiles the Singaporean isolates were connected to each other at SABs &gt;0.80 but only one isolate mixed with the U.S. and Europe isolates at this SAB (an arbitrary threshold for genetic similarity). RAPD analysis generated DNA profiles that clustered the C.albicans Isolates Into approximately the same number of distinct typing groups as REA. Isolates of the same REA subtype were generally assigned to distinct groups by RAPD. However, some isolates assigned to different REA subtypes were assigned to the same group by RAPD while other isolates repre- senting these REA subtypes were assigned to different groups by RAPD. In a composite dendrogram, the isolates from the U.S. and Europe clustered in major groups at similarity values &gt;0.85, while most Singaporean isolates connected to these clusters at SABs of 0.75 or greater. PFGE was less discriminatory for analyzing divergent genetic variation than REA and RAPD, and discerned approx. 1/3 as many distinct subtypes. The Singaporean isolates distributed randomly in a combined dendrogram with the U.S. and Europe isolates. The results suggest that a high degree of genetic diversity exists between C.albicans isolates from Southeast Asia and the U.S. /Europe. 340 In Vitro Susceptibility Testing of Torulopsis glabrata Clinical Isolates. RN TIBALLI*, LT ZARINS, X HE, CA KAUFFMAN. Ann Arbor VAMC &amp; Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Torulopsis glabrata is a pathogen of increasing frequency in hospitalized patients. One hundred thirty-five clinical isolates of T. glabrata were obtained over a 14 year period from cutaneous and deep wound cultures, bloodstream infections, oropharyngeal specimens from patients with AIDS, and urinary tract infections. Isolates represented the pre-triazole era to the present. MICs were determined for fluconazole (Flu) and itraconazole (Itra) by both the NCCLS proposed standard M27-P and by a colorimetric microbroth dilution method utilizing Alamar Blue. Isolates were categorized by date of isolation with respect to introduction of Flu to hospital formulary. No patient in Pre-Flu group received Flu. No patient in either group received Itra. Readings were made after 48 hours of incubation. Significant trailing was present with the NCCLS method. Endpoints were well defined with the colorimetric method. Elevated or high MIC for Flu ( 128 ug/ml) correlated with elevated or high (e 12.8 gug/ml) MIC for Itra, suggesting cross-resistance. No increase in MIC was noted in 10 of 12 patients with multiple isolations over 3-36 months (mean = 11 ? 2.6 mo), despite frequent use of Flu in this population. NCCLS Macrobroth Dilution Method, in ug/ml All isolates, n=135 Pre-Flu Era, n=78 Post-Flu era, n=57 Flu Itra Flu Itra Flu Itra MICso 8 0.4 8 0.4 16 0.8 MIC9o 32 1.6 16 0.8 &gt;128 3.2 Colorimetric method results are as follows: Concordance with NCCLS method by two-fold dilutions, n=13 5 Fluconazole | Itraconazole ?1 ?2 + ?3 ?I1 l ?2 ?3 52% 87% 1 98% 64% I 88% 93% For T. glabrata, MICs for triazoles have increased since their introduction and cross- resistance exists. The high MICgo for fluconazole suggests use of alternative agents to treat infection with T. glabrata. Trailing at MIC endpoint determinations for T. glabrata with NCCLS methods is a significant problem that is not evident in a colorimetric method. 341 Yeast on the Rise; It's Only Good If You're Baking Bread. K. ENGLUND, G. NOSKIN, J. KRUSZYNSKI, L. PETERSON. Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL. Systemic fungal infections are increasing in prevalence and clinical significance, especially in facilities caring for immunosuppressed patients. Candida albicans has routinely been the most prevalent yeast isolated from blood. As more patients receive antifungal therapy, either as treatment or prophylaxis, an increase in more resistant fungal isolates can be predicted. To evaluate whether this trend is beginning at our institution, prevalence data and susceptibility results from the previous 3 years were reviewed for Northwestern Memorial Hospital, an 1100-bed, university affiliated hospital. The prevalence data includes only blood culture fungal isolates from January 1992-December 1994. NUMBER OF BLOOD CULTURE ISOLATES 1992 1993 1994 Total Candida albicans 17 9 13 39 Candida krusei 1 3 1 5 Candida parapsilosis 7 16 30 53 Candida tropicalis 4 6 7 17 Torulopsis elabrata 4 6 9 19 Total 33 40 60 133 This table reveals relatively stable numbers of C. albicans isolates, but a significant increase in C. parapsilosis and T. glabrata fungemias. The total number of fungemias nearly doubled in a 3 year period. Antifungal susceptibility testing, using a broth microdilution technique, was performed on all sterile body fluid isolates and other samples (ie. thrush) as requested by physicians. From January 1993-March 1995, C. albicans susceptibility to fluconazole remained stable at 82%. Although there were only 7 isolates, 0 of 7 C. krusei were susceptible to fluconazole, but 6 of 7 isolates were susceptible to ketoconazole. C. tropicalis and T. glabrata also showed better susceptibility patterns to ketoconazole than to fluconazole (75 vs 65% and 100 vs 86%, respectively), but the difference was less significant. In conclusion, the number of serious systemic fungal infections continues to increase, with a dramatic increase in non-Candida albicans isolates. The susceptibility patterns of these isolates must be followed closely, as treatment and prophylactic regimens may need to be amended.</page><page sequence="59">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETNG 777 342 Pulmonary Cryptococcosis in Patents Without HIV Infection. VE MULANOVICH, ME BRADLEY, and PG PAPPAS*. The University of Alabaina at Birmingham, Birrningham, AL. The natural history and optimal approach to therapy for pts with pulmonary cryptococcosis (crypto) is poorly understood. but immunocompromised pts with pulmonary crypto are usually given antifungal therapy to prevent progression aid/or dissemination to extrapulmonary sites, especially the CNS. We retrospectively reviewed 29 cases at our institution from 1982 to 1994 of culture-positive and/or histologically proven non-HIV-related pulmonary crypto. The mean age was 51 years: 76% were white and 24% black; 76% were male. Their risk factors included solid organ transplant (49%), other conditions requiring immunosuppressive drugs (31%), diabetes mellitus (10%) and no underlying dz (10%). The main symptoms were cough (52%), fever (41%) and chest pain (31%). CXR abnormalities included localized infiltrates (38%). one or more nodules (31%), diffuse infiltrates (24%), cavitary lesions (14%) and pleural effiusion (7%). Dx of pulmonary dz was based on cultures alone in 34%, histopathology alone in 21% and both in 45%. Serum crypto antigen (CrAg) was positive in 13 (52%) of 25 pts. Twenty-five pts had an LP at the time of Dx, 6 (24%) had concomitant cryptococcal meningitis. All 29 pts received antifungal Rx. Eighteen pts received amphotencimi B (AmB) for a median of 5.5 weeks (range: I to 17 weeks) and a total dose of 220 to 2000 mg. Twelve received concomitant flucytosine (5FC). Five died during Rx, 3 from overwhelming cryptococcal dz, 1 from recrudescence while on substandard Rx and I from surgical complications. The remaining 13 responded clinically and were followed for a mean of 36.5 months, 6 of whom received additional Rx with ketoconazole (keto) or fluconazole (flu) for 2 weeks to 3 years. No one relapsed. Of the remaining 11 pts, 9 received flu (200400 mg/d), 1 keto (400 mg/d), and 1 itraconazole (200 mg/d) for 1 to 8 mos and were followed for a mean of 6.5 mos. One pt with pregnancy developed CNS crypto 7 months after stopping flu, the remaining 10 had a stable clinical course. Conclusions: At our institution, 90% of pts with pulmonary crypto had an underlying mmunnosuppressive condition, and 24% had meningitis at presentation. Fifty-two percent had a positive serum CrAg. All pts received antifungal Rx, with most pts before 1990 receiving AmB +/- 5FC, while most pts with uncomplicated pulmonary crypto since 1990 have received flu as primary Rx. We conclude that most pts with uncomplicated pulmonary crypto can be managed with flu 200-400 mg/d for 3-6 mos. Pts with overwhelming dz and extrapulmonary crypto should receive AmB +/- 5FC as initial Rx possibly followed by flu for several months. Surgery has a minor role in the management of this pts. The risk of CNS relapse after antifungal Rx is low. 343 Cryptococcosis Disease Surveillance In Alabama 1992- 1994. PG PAPPAS*, C THOMAS, ME BRADLEY, R DILL, LA KLUG, RW PINNER. University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL; University of South Alabama, Mobile; AL, and the National Center For Infectious Diseases, CDC, Atlanta, GA. Although cryptococcosis is an important fungal infection among pts with HIV infection, little data exist comparing rates of cryptococcosis among HIV-positive and HIV- negative pts. In Alabama ( pop 4,004,258), cryptococcosis if felt to be common, and in 1992, we began statewide surveillance for crypt(coccosis. The study was conducted over a 2 year period from 10/92 to 9/94. Cases of cryptococcosis were based on culture, cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), and/or histopathology reports obtained from participating hospitals, physicians, and the Alabama State Department of Public Health (ASDPH). Alabama population denominators were based on the 1990 census. 202 cases were identified over the 2 year study period, and there was no significant seasonal variation. 77% of cases were ages 19-58 yrs; 23% were &gt;58 yrs. Diagnosis was based on positive culture for C. neoformans in 60.5% patients, CrAg in 28%, and histopathology in 5'%. Overall, males represented 77% of cases, whites 56.5%. The overall rate of cryptococcosis was 2.03 cases / 100,000 / year. Urban counties had substantially greater rates of cryptococcosis (2.6) than rural counties (1.1). HIV status was determined for 68% of cases - 92/202 (45%) were HIV-positive, 45 (22%) HIV-negative, 65 (32%) unknown. Rates were also calculated for race, gender, and HIV status and are demonstrated below (HIV+ rates are based on estimates of those living with AIDS; HIV- rates based on state population): (cases/ 100,000/ year) BF WF BM WM HIV + 187.5 929.4 1028.4 714.6 HIV- .64 .49 .32 .66 overall .91 .85 6.39 2.28 We conclude that cryptococcosis continues to be an important infection in both HIV- positive and HIV-negaive patients in Alabama. At least 20% of cases occur in non-HIV infected patients, however, rates of infection are as much as 3000 times higher in certain groups of HIV-positive patients, with the highest rates among BM. These trends are consistent with previous observations in certain urban centers, where HIV-positive BM have the highest rates of cryptococcosis. 344 Incidence of In-Vitro Antifungal Cross Resistance Among Fluconazole Resistant C. albicans and T. glabrata Isolates. J.A. VAZQUEZ*, M. LYNCH, D. BOIKOV, J.D. SOBEL, Wayne State University, Detroit, Ml, VAMC, Allen Park, Ml. Fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the compromised host. Extensive use of antifungals especially in the severely compromised host (including HIV) have resulted in numerous reports of antifungal resistance. Since the azoles are a closely related class of antifungals we were concerned about the occurrence of cross- resistance between azoles and amphotericin B. Forty-five isolates from 41 patients were evaluated using NCCLS guidelines for in-vitro susceptibility testing. There were 27 C. albicans (CA), 14 T. glabrata (TG), and 4 C. krusei (CK). The break point used to define azole resistance was 1.56 pg/ml, except for fluconazole (F) where 20 pg/ml was utilized. 27 CA were resistant to F, only 2/27 (7%) were simultaneously resistant to itraconazole, 11/27 (41%) were resistant to clotrimazole (C) and 3/27 (111 %) were resistant to ketoconazole (K) simultaneously. In contrast, of the 14 T. glabrata resistant to F, 9/14 (64%) were cross-resistant to I, 12/14 (86%) to C, and 8/14 (57%) cross-resistant to K. In conclusion, although cross-resistance between F and C in C. albicans is not infrequent, the incidence of cross-resistance among the azoles is significantly higher for T. glabrata isolates. In all species tested, there was no in-vitro cross resistance detected between the azoles and amphotericin B. 345 Cloning of the Topoisomerase II Gene in Cryptococcus neoformans. JG PAZIN'*, TH RUDE', CC DYKSTRA2 and JR PERFECT'. Duke University Medical Center, Durham NC' and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill NC.2 With the increasing population of immunocompromised hosts due to the AIDS epidemic, cancer and widespread transplantation programs, Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) has emerged as an important opportunistic infection. Therapy for this life-threatening mycosis is problematic in that the toxicity and relapse rates associated with current drugs remain significant. For the development of new drugs and alterations of present compounds, there would be an advantage to identify specific therapeutic molecular targets. A target that has been exploited successfully with other pathogens is topoisomerase activity. Our strategy is to isolate and study the genetic structure of the topoisomerases of CN and to produce large quantities of the proteins so that extensive structure-activity relationship studies can be performed. Our initial attention has been focused on the topoisomerase II gene. Using PCR technology, DNA amplification was performed using degenerate 18-bp oligonucleotide primers generated to highly conserved regions of the topoisomerase II canonical gene. These primers amplified an expected 1 Kb DNA fragment from CN genomic DNA. This fragment was cloned into EcoRV-cut pBluescript KS+ plasmid, and DNA sequence analysis revealed high homology (60-90%) to other topoisomerase II gene sequences. A Southern blot using this I Kb fragment as the probe showed it to be CN DNA. We have used the probe to screen an EMBL3 CN genomic library. Several clones were identified, and we are currently subcloning the complete topoisomerase II gene (estimated to be 6000 hp). DNA sequencing of the complete gene is underway. Isolation of the topoisomerase II gene from CN will allow us to use it to express large amounts of the protein for hiochemical studies to identify mechanisms of action for anti-topoisomerase agents and to make temperature-sensitive mutants to study virulence. 346 Effect of Human Serum on Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) Multiplication and Fluconazole (FCZ) Activity. F. NASSAR, E. BRUMMER, and D.A. STEVENS'. Santa Clara Valley Med. Ctr., Calif. Inst. Med. Res., San Jose, CA and Stanford U. School of Medicine, Stanford, CA The inhibitory effect of human serum (HS) on the multiplication of Cn and the interaction with FCZ was studied. Compared to Cn multiplication in RPMI-1640 alone, 5% HS in RPMI inhibited multiplication by 76 +/- 6% (n=8). Inhibitory effect of HS was donor independent, heat stable (56 C, 10 min), nondialysable, and not due to albumin or globulin. Bovine and murine sera were not inhibitory. A fungistatic concentration of FCZ (5.0 mcg/ml) in RPMI + 5% HS resulted in 40 +/- 5% (n=8) killing (reduction of inoculum colony forming units) in a 24 h assay. Bovine or murine sera did not have the enhancing effect, and this HS activity was heat- stable and donor-independent. At 2.5 mcg/ml FCZ, fungistasis by FCZ plus HS was significantly greater than either alone. Higher serum concentrations potentiated FCZ more. At higher FCZ concentrations (e.g., 20 mcg/ml) FCZ alone could kill, but serum potentiated this. A FCZ resistant isolate (MIC=100 mcg/ml) was not killed by FCZ (5.0 mcg/ml) in 5% HS, but HS potentiated the partial FCZ inhibition. When HS was dialysed (cutoff, n 7,000 MW) against phosphate buffered saline it lost ability to synergize with FCZ for killing Cn, but not the capacity to inhibit multiplication of Cn. Filtration of serum revealed that the &lt;10,000 MW filtrate could synergize with FCZ for killing but not inhibit multiplication. These findings indicate that HS has two components, one (macromolecular) with unique ability to inhibit Cn, and low MW that enhances FCZ anticryptococcal activity. 347 Cutaneous Manifestations of Filamentous Fungi. *MARK A. BROWN, JOHN N. GREENE, RAMON L. SANDIN, KAREN S. LASZLO. H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and The University of South Florida COM., Tampa, FL. Filamentous fungi continue to be emerging pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. We present here ten patients with cutaneous lesions caused by species of Aspergillus, Curvularia, Fusarium and Paecilomyces. All patients had undergone high dose chemotherapy; most had also undergone bone marrow transplantation. The primary malignancy varied, with breast carcinoma and acute leukemias predominating. All isolates were confirmed by tissue histopathology or culture on Sabouraud's media. Preliminary case analysis reveals certain risk factors for developing these manifestations; sites of previous phlebotomy or IV insertions, neutropenia lasting over ten days (average 10.4 days), and severe onychomycosis. After evaluation for concurrent sinopulmonary disease by CT scanning, two patients had sinusitus, three patients had pneumonia, and five had no evidence of systemic disease i.e. represented primary cutaneous filamentous fungal infection. Few had received prior anti-fungal therapy (3 with fluconazole, 3 with amphotericin B, 1 with amphotericin B lipid complex) prior to diagnosis, for an average of 5.4 days. Five patients were treated with amphotericin B and five with amphotericin B lipid complex for an average duration of 25.4 days. Only 2 of the 10 patients died from the fungal infection. Subcutaneous nodules, necrotic skin les-ons and severe onychomycosis may be harbingers of disseminated filamentous fungal infections. Prompt recognition, a radiologic search for systemic disease and early institution of amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B is crucial for survival of these patients.</page><page sequence="60">778 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 348 Substrains of Pathogenic Rhizopus Differentiable by Molecular Probes and by SEM Surface Morphology.

Light and SEM microscopy showed that #1632 aerial hyphae produced an unusual spherical sporangiophore component found in only one of the reference cultures (#93-392), which also has a unique banding in the aerial hyphae similar to #1632. The unusual structures may be those reported in 1904 (R. tritici Saito). Genomic DNA was extracted from surface mats of the eight isolates grown overnight at 37?C, and probed with suitable oligonucleotides and PCR. RAPID probes 106 and 137 (D.W. Holden), ITS probes 1/4 and probes of consensus sequences of fungal genes gamma-tubulin (B.R. Oakley), chitin synthase (P. Szanislo) and nit-2, yielded amplified DNA fragments separable by 2% agarose gel-electrophoresis. Genome organization for #1632 is evidently like that of #93-392, and different from other isolates studied, based on gel-mobility patterns from all tested probes; suggesting a taxonomic separation as Rhizopus tritici, a species not previously implicated in human mycoses. The plethora of fungi capable of inciting human infectious diseases continues to escalate in contemporary medicine. 349 Site-Directed Mutagenesis of the Diphenol Oxidase Gene(CNLAC1) in Cryptococcus neoformans. S.D. SALAS*, K.E. MARSDEN, P.R. WILLIAMSON, J.E. BENNETT. The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD. Melanin production by diphenol oxidase(DPO) is a virulence factor for Cryptococcus neoformans, an important fungal pathogen in patients with AIDS. Characterization of the DPO structural gene, C.neoformans laccasel (CNLAC1) in a Mel negative mutant(me/2) by DNA sequencing revealed the point mutation; His-&gt;Tyr, in a putative copper binding site. We decided to study the importance of this mutation on the production of melanin in C.neoformans. Plasmid construction and transformation: A 1.2 kb PCR fragment containing the URA5 gene was inserted adjacent to a 6 kb genomic fragment containing CNLAC1(p6CU). Vector sequences (pBluescript) were removed, and the linear fragment was used to transform a Mel negative, CNLAC1 deletant strain, 10S(mel,ura5). Over eighty percent of the transformants produced melanin; results were consistent with complementation. Site-directed mutagenesis: Reproduction of the His-&gt; Tyr mutation found in the me12 strain was accomplished in plasmid p6CU by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. A 250 bp PCR product containing CNLAC1 unique sites BstBI/Ncol and the desired mutation was ligated into the same sites of p6CU to create the mutant plasmid, p6CUT. Verification of the target mutation, and the entire PCR product in p6CUT was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Unlike the wild type plasmid, p6CU, the mutant plasmid, p6CUT was unable to complement the Mel - mutant (10S) by electroporation. Under the same transforming conditions, none of the four thousand transformants screened produced brown pigment. These results suggest that this histidine copper binding site of diphenol oxidase is essential for melanin production in C.neoformans. This site may be a potential target for inhibitors of CNLAC1. 350 Expression of Pneumocystis carinii Major Surface Glycoprotein in a Heterologous Host. JD. HEFFELFINGER*, T.W. HATTON, and J.C. EDMAN. University of California, San Francisco, CA. Despite advances in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and widespread use of prophylactic medications, PCP remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS, and it continues to be a leading indicator disease for new diagnoses of AIDS in the United States. P. carinii (Pc) has been established as a member of the Fungi on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of its 16S-like rRNA. Molecular genetic analysis of the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) of Pc has shown that MSG is a family of proteins. It has been suggested that the presence of multiple related MSG genes indicates antigenic variation as a probable mechanism for evasion of host defenses. Study of the gene regulation and expression in Pc has been impeded because no satisfactory culture system exists. We have isolated and characterized a full-length clone of rat Pc MSG by PCR, constructed an MSG-expression vector, and cloned this into Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) in order to study the expression of this protein in vivo. The construct contains an entire MSG cDNA under the control of Sc GALI promoter and uses the native Pc MSG signal peptide. Localization of MSG in Sc was assessed by fractionation of the proteins present in induced yeast clones. Expressing clones were lysed with glass beads and extracts were clarified by low speed centrifugation. The resulting intracelular and cell wall fractions were separated on polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblot. We found that MSG resided predominantly in the cell wall fraction. Glucans are a primary component of yeast cell walls, and MSG has been shown to be a zymolyase-extractable protein in Pc. We found that MSG in Sc was solubilized by treatment with zymolyase as well, indicating that MSG in both hosts are associated with beta-glucan in the cell wall. In addition, MSG in both Pc and Sc are susceptible to treatment with endoglycosidase H, demonstrating that the carbohydrate chains of MSG in both organisms are N-glycosylated. We plan to compare the yeast-derived MSG material with MSG from Pc in order to assess similarities in their carbohydrate composition. The heterologous expression of MSG may also allow us to address its functional role via isolation of yeast homologs of these antigens or the construction of yeast mutants dependent on these antigens for survival. Expression studies in Sc may allow the identification of the signals necessary for processing, localization, and modification of MSG. Additionally, given evidence of the immunogenicity of MSG in laboratory animals, expression studies in yeast may provide a means for development of a vaccine against Pc in the future. 351 Splenectomy Enhances the Susceptibility of Mice to Cryptococcosis. F.A. CARO, S.K. TEWARI, L.A. VON BEHREN* and R.P. TEWARI. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL USA Asplenic individuals are more susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, but the role of spleen in immunobiology of cryptococcosis is not known. We investigated the effect of splenectomy on the susceptibility of mice to cryptococcosis. Male C3H/HeN mice were splenectomized and infected intravenously (i.v.) or intratracheally (i.t.) with varying doses of Cryptococcus neofomnans (CN) 3 weeks later. At an i.v. challenge of 3 x 103 CN cells, 80% mortality was seen in splenectomized versus 30% in controls (p &lt; 0.05). At a lower challenge dose (1.5 x 103 CN), higher mortality was also observed in splenectomized mice but this difference was not statistically significant. After an i.t. infection with 6 x 106 CN cells, 80% of splenectomized mice died within 30 days compared to 30% in controls (p &lt; 0.05). At a challenge dose of 3 x 106 CN cells, 60% mortality was observed in splenectomized versus 20% deaths in controls. Quantitation of the organisms in internal organs of CN-infected mice showed higher number of CN cells in the lungs, liver, and brain of splenectomized animals compared with controls. We conclude that splenectomy enhances the susceptibility of mice to cryptococcosis.

Washington University, St. Louis, MO and St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO. Mucosal candidiasis is a common complication of HIV infection and HIV- positive women are prone to develop both oral and vaginal disease. Colonization with Candida albicans and related species at either site is a common preceding event in asymptomatic women. There is little available information about the relatedness of Candida strains obtained from different body sites in HIV-positive women. To examine the molecular epidemiology of colonizing strains in this population, concurrent oral and vaginal cultures were obtained from 32 HIV positive women (mean CD4 387; range 2- 1319). Positive oral cultures were obtained in 19 (59%) and positive vaginal cultures in 10 (31%). Candida species were isolated from both sites simultaneously in 9 (28%) women. These strains were evaluated for RFLPs at the rDNA locus (using a heterologous 8.4 kb Not I probe from H. capsulatum) and with a C. albicans-specific repetitive probe. Isolates were grouped into four classes by RFLP analysis and were subsequently evaluated by RAPD PCR with four arbitrary primers (8-29 bp in length, 38- 88% GC content) to detect strain specific differences. All isolates tested were unique and could be discriminated by RFLP or RAPD-PCR. In all nine cases, vaginal and oral isolates cultured from the same individual were dissimilar suggesting that the dominant strain of Candida colonizing different body sites is different from site-to-site. Moreover, oral isolates from 3 HIV positive children (8-24 months of age), obtained concurrently, were different from both oral and vaginal isolates obtained from their mothers. These findings suggest that the epidemiology of Candida infection in HIV disease is complex, that the development of oropharyngeal and vaginal disease may be disassociated, and, even within families, HIV positive patients are each infected by their own unique strains of Candida. 353 Amphoteridcin B Therapy in Patients with AIDS and Disseminated Histoplasmosis: Fever and Lactate Dehydrogenase Response. M.J. ALAM-, I.K. ZANDO, R. L. PENN, J. BOCCHINI, JR., and J.W. KING. LSUMC, SHREVEPORT, LA. Although Disseminated Histoplasmosis (DH) is common in AIDS patients who live in Histoplasma endemic areas, diagnosis is often delayed. To detect clinical or laboratory parameters that would connote earlier diagnosis of DH, we reviewed 43 admissions (1991-1994) of 29 patients with AIDS and culture proven DH. Diagnostic criteria for DH were: positive blood or bone marrow (BM) cultures and histology of BM. Admission symptoms included: fever (39/43-91%), cough (33/43-77%), and weight loss (25/43- 58%). Admission medications (rmg/day - range) included: Fluconazole 11/43-26% (100-800 mg); Itraconazole 8/43-19% (100-400 mg); Ketoconazola 2/43-5% (400 mg). Amphotericin B (Ampho B) was given on 26/43-60% admissions. Of 26 men with culture proven DH who were treated with Ampho B, 10 (38%) were known to be culture positive on admission, 9 (35%) developed positive cultures during admission, and 7 (27%) were treated empiricaly prior to either culture or BM histochemical confirmation of DH. Histochemical stains were diagnostic for Histoplasma capsulatum in 9/17 (53%) men, 6 of whom received Ampho B. Cultures of BM and blood became positive in 25 (8-68) and 24 (10-54) days, respectively. Patients who received Ampho B had temperatures (mean+SD o F) on admit similar to those of patients not given Ampho B: 102.5 + 1.6 and 102+ 2, respectively (p = 0.6). However, on discharge, Ampho B recipients' temperatures were 98.7 + 1.1 which were lower than discharge temperatures of non-Ampho B treated patients (p&lt; 0.01). Ampho B dose to defervescence averaged 49mg (5-120 mg) and days to defervescence were 3.5 (1-9) days. In patients treated with Ampho B, serum LDH was 3422 + 2305 on admission, peaked at 5965 + 5587, and fell to 685 + 404 at discharge. In 17 patients not treated with Ampho B, LDH was 4754 + 5376 on admission, peaked at 7780 ? 6457, and was 5840 + 5657 upon discharge (p&lt;0.01for Ampho B treated vs untreated patients). Therapy with oral antifungal agents does not preclude diagnosis of DH. Cultures of BM and blood took 2.5-5 weeks to become positive. Immediate diagnosis can be made in 53% of patients by positive BM histology. Rapid defervescence and LDH response following low-dose Ampho B may identify AIDS-DH patients.</page><page sequence="61">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 779 354 In Vitro Induction of Stable Fluconazole Resistance in Candida albicans. HM CALVET*, S SOLDAN, A RADNER, MR YEAMAN, SG FILLER. Division of Infectious Diseases, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA Invasive and mucosal Candide infections are becoming increasingly common, and there are numerous reports of infections due to azole-resistant isolates. To examine the mechanisms by which C. albicans becomes resistant to azoles, we developed an in ito model of fluconazole resistance. A fluconazole- susceptible strain of C. abicans, ATCC 36082, was passaged repeatedly in yeast nitrogen base broth containing 4, 8, 16 or 128 pg/ml of fluconazole in a standard- ized manner. Organisms from each passage were later recultured in the presence of fluconazole, and their susceptibilities to fluconazole were determined by the microdilution method at 48 h. Organisms grown in the presence of 8, 16 or 128 pg/ml fluconazole developed high level resistance within 8 passages (Figure), whereas growth in 4 pg/ml fiuconazole failed to induce resistance. All resistant isolates remained resistant after at least another 5 passages in drug-free media. The resistant isolates were characterized by slower growth rates, small colony size and abnormal cellular morphologies. One of the resistant isolates from 128 ug/ml was assayed for virulence in the rabbit endocarditis model. It caused the same degree of infection as the parent strain and continued to display high level fluconazole resistance after in vivo passage. This isolate exhibited the same biotype as the parent strain by API 20 testing. Conclusions: fluconazole resistance in C. albicans can be in- duced in vitro.

J. Messa*, S. Gelone, M. Heifets, B. Suh. Temple University Health Sciences Center, Philadelphia, PA Invasive aspergillosis (IA) in the immunocompromised host is usually lethal and difficult to diagnose. The incidence of IA is increasing due to more frequent use of aggressive chemo- and immunosuppressive therapy for malignancy and organ transplantation. At our institution, we observed two orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients develop fungal endocarditis due to Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) despite AmB therapy. The first patient was a 63 YOM with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who received an OHT in 4/93. His course was complicated by two episodes of rejection, several episodes of bacteremia due to S. marsescens, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and CMV disease. In 6/93 he developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with tissue cultures growingAF. He received 8 weeks of AmB (Img/klg/day) treatment. Two weeks into AmB therapy, he developed endophthalmitis with vitreal cultures positive forAF. He was discharged in 9/93 on itraconazole (ITR) 200 mg daily. A TTE was negative in 11/93. He returned in 12/93 with fever and a new mitral valve vegetation detected by TEE. He had valve replacement surgery and operative tissue cultures grewAF. The second was a 36 YOM with a history of severe hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and chronic renal failure who received an OHT and kidney transplant (HKTx) in 3/94. He received a second HKTx due to rejection in 6/94. Post-operative complications included Salmonella bacteremia, CMV disease, a GI bleed necessitating partial gastrectomy, and intraabdominal abscesses due to C. glabrata. He presented in 1/95 with foot cellulitis and blurred vision in the left eye. Vitreal and right heel biopsies grewAF. A TTE and TEE were negative in 2/95. He was treated with AmB (Img/kgtday) for 1 week and ABLCO (5 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks, and discharged on ITR 200 mg BID. He represented in 4/95 with fever, bilateral leg swelling, and new mitral and tricuspid valve vegetations on TEE .In conclusion, solid organ transplant recipients are at greater risk for IA, and infection often progresses despite standard antifungal therapy. A more aggressive diagnostic approach, including more frequent echocardiography, and the use of AmB doses &gt; 1 mg/kg/day may improve outcome. 356 Increased Attachment of Fluconazole- Resistant Isolates of Candida albicans to Rabbit Esophageal Mucosa: Application and Development of a New Tissue Explant Model. C.A. LYMAN*, K.F. GARRETT, J. PETER, P.A. PIZZO, T.J. WALSH, Pediatric Branch, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD Esophageal candidiasis is a significant cause of morbidity among individuals with impaired cellular immunity, especially those with AIDS. In order to study the interactions between Candida albicans and esophageal tissue, we developed a new tissue explant model using intact esophageal mucosa harvested from healthy New Zealand white rabbits. Multiple strains of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida krusei were studied for their ability to attach to the esophageal mucosa. Differences were detected in how avidly these Candida spp. attached to the mucosa, with C. krusei &gt; C. albicans &gt; C. tropichlis &gt; C. parapsilosis. Isolates of C. albicans collected from HIV- infected patients were then tested for their ability to attach to the esophageal mucosa. Five fluconazole-resistant isolates (MIC264 pg/ml) and five fluconazole-sensitive isolates (MIC&lt;0.5 ig/ml) were compared for their ability to adhere to the esophageal tissue. The resistant strains were found to attach more avidly than the sensitive strains to both the distal (8.4?1.8x10e5 vs 3.7?0,7x10e5 cfu/g, p=0.02) and the proximal (7.5?1.6x10e5 vs 4.0?0.7x10e5 cfu/g, p=0.05) regions of the esophagus. Thus, the increase in morbidity seen in patients with fluconazole-resistant isolates of C. albicans may be due to virulence factors, such as increased adhesiveness, that are co-selected for along with the drug resistance. 357 Penetration of Systemic Amphotericin B (AMB) into the Biliary Tract of an Adult Orthotopic Liver Transplant Patient with Invasive Fungal Cholangitis. C. R. MESSICK*, K.J. PURSELL, T. WILEY, K.A. RODVOLD, L.H. DANZIGER. University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL. Literature examining the penetration of AMB into the biliary tract in adults is nonexistent. The information, to date, is extrapolated from animal studies (canine and primate) and post-mortem studies of patients who have received varying dosing regimens. We present the first case report examining the penetration of systemic AMB into the biliary tree in an adult orthotopic liver transplant patient with invasive Candida cholangitis. A 56 year old man status post orthotopic liver transplant was admitted with pronounced elevated liver function tests and fever. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) showed a leak from the common bile duct. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram revealed a stricture of the common bile duct and a proximal bile leak at the intrahepatic portion of the hepatic duct. PTC-guided stenting of the biliary stricture was performed with placement of a T-tube to drain the accumulating bile into the duodenum. On hospital days 12 through 16, repeated bile cultures taken from the T-tube grew C. albicans and diptheroids. A repeat PTC showed extravasation of bile from the hepatic duct and multiple filling defects within the biliary system. The patient received a cummulative dose of 896 mg (1.0 mg/kg/day) of intravenous AMB and 175 mg of AMB infused directly into the biliary tract, over three days. The intraductal administration was given ten days prior to the last dose of AMB. The therapy resulted in elimination of C. albicans from the biliary tree. Bile and serum AMB concentrations were obtained before intraductal instillation and serially following the final dose of intravenous AMB (time 0 hours, 2, 5, 23, and 345 hours after the six hour infusion). Serum concentrations ranged from 1.3 ug/ml immediately pre-dose to 1.8 ug/ml four hours after completion of the intravenous infusion. Biliary concentrations ranged from 4.5 ug/ml to 4.8 ug/ml. The plasma T, was 25.57 hours, the plasma AUC 35.85 ug-hr/ml. The bile T, was 187.2 hours, the bile AUC 103.6 ug-hr/ml. The AUC bile to serum ratio from 0 to 23 hours was 2.89 to 1. This represents the first report of biliary penetration of AMB in an adult liver transplant patient. Based on our data, AMB appears to penetrate well into the biliary tree of orthotopic liver transplant patients reaching bile concentrations at least 2.5 times that of serum. 358 Comparative Therapeutic Efficacy of two Amphotericin B Liposomal Forms in Aspergillus Fumigatus (AF) Exper-mental 'ndocarditis. A. VASSILOYANAKOPOULOS, J. BOUTSIKAKIS, E.E. MYLONAKIS, E. KYTEA, A.D. ARGYROPOULOU, M. LAZANAS, F. KARDARAS, O. PANIARA, G. CHALEVELAKIS, G. SAROGLOU* and S.A. RAPTIS. University of Athens, 'Evangelismos' Hospital, Athens - Greece. Amphotericin B (AmB) is the major antifungal agent for systemic aspergillosis. We compared, in the AF rabbit endocarditis model the efficacy of Liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AmB) and Amphotericin B Lipid Complex (AmB-LC) in two doses (1 mg/kgr bid or 3 mg/kgr bid) to AmB 1 mgr/kgr bid. Animals were treated iv for 4 days starting 12 hours after challenge with AF (1x107 spores). Following treatment vegetations removed and quantitatively cultured. Treat- Ds N animals nim.

When the same dose was used AmB was superior to its liposomal forms (p&lt;0.01). On the contrary, no statistical significant differences were found between AmB, high dose L-AmB and AmB-LC, in reducing intravegetation fungal concentra- tions. Our data suggest that in the treatment of AF endocarditis model not only AmB is effective but also L-AmB and AmB-LC in much higher doses. There was no statistical difference in efficacy between the two liposomal forms in either doses used. Further, in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation and clinical trials, are required to confirm our experimental findings. 359 Risks Factors of Fungemia in Pediatric HIV Infection. A Case Control Study, C. E. GONZALEZ*, S. LEE, D. VENZON, B. MUELLER, D. MARSHALL, P.A. PIZZO, T.J. WALSH. National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD. We previously found that fungemia in HIV infected children has distinctive epidemiological, pathogenic, and prognostic features. In order to further define the risk factors related to the occurrence of fungemia in this patient population, we performed a matched case control study. During the past 6 years, fungemia developed among 22 (6.3%) of 347 HIV-infected children. Each of these 22 cases was matched by age and gender with 3 case controls. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate 43 potential risks factors in the six month period prior to the date of the detection of fungemia in the respective cases. The strongest putative risk factors (p=&lt;0.00001) found by univariate analysis were: presence of a central venous catheter (CVC), a CVC placement period greater than 90 days (relative risk (RR):22.5), more than 3 parenteral antibiotics (RR:9.8), duration of antibiotic therapy of more than 30 days (RR:6.6), an absolute CD4 count lower than 100/gl (RR:9.9), continous infusion of zidovudine (RR=10.7) and levels lower than 3g/dl of albumin as a marker of malnourishment (RR: 6.33 and 18, respectively). Neutropenia was not a risk factor. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the best predictor of fungemia in this population was the presence of a CVC placed for more than 90 days (p&lt;0.00001), followed by a group composed of 5 independent variables adjusted for CD4 &lt;100/Il. Those 5 variables included, &gt;3 antibiotics (p=0.0018), &gt;30 days of antibiotic treatment (p=0.0018), bacterial infections (p=0.0018) including bacteremia (p=0.0031) and MAI infection (p=0.012). We conclude that prolonged placement of CVCs is the most important risk factor for fungemia in the HIV- infected children and that the risk of fungemia is further influenced by antibacterial therapy, catheter manipulation, and host response.</page><page sequence="62">780 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 360 Fever Immediately after Recovery from Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia in Acute Leukemia. TD BARTON, MG SCHUSTER*. The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. Objective: To determine the incidence and etiology of fever occurring immediately after resolution of neutropenia in patients treated with chemotherapy for acute leukemia (AL). To compare these results to a previously studied cohort at our institution ten years ago, before empiric and prophylactic antifungal therapy were routinely used. Methods: A retrospective review of 165 admissions to the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center during 1992-94 for the treatment of AL. All episodes of fever 2 38'C for &gt; 48 hrs within 10 days after absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500 cells/mm3 were included. Result: 29 of 145 episodes (20%) met the entry criteria, as compared to 15% ten years ago. Patients were neutropenic for a mean of 23 days, and febrile for a mean of 12 neutropenic days. Empiric amphotericin B was given in 21 of these febrile neutropenic episodes. After recovery from neutropenia, patients were febrile for an average of five days (range: 2 - 25). Causes of fever included five (17%) bacterial infections (four bacteremias and one pneumonia.) Six (21%) cases were due to non-infectious causes; three drug reactions, two phlebitis, and one tumor fever. In 12 (41%) cases, no cause could be established, in comparison to 12% ten years ago. In all such cases, fever resolved; 7 with empiric amphotericin B + antibiotics, 2 with empiric antibiotics alone, and 3 without intervention. Six of the 29 (21%) episodes were due to microbiologically or clinically documented fungal infection, as compared to 35% ten years ago. Four patients, had suspected pulmonary aspergillosis. Two patients had systemic candidal infections. All six patients who developed fungal infections were febrile during neutropenia, and five were treated with empiric amphotericin B. Conclusions: Fever following marrow recovery from chemotherapy for AL remains a common event. The number of fungal infections has not changed in the past decade despite increased use of empiric and prophylactic antifungal therapy. The number of cases with no identified cause has significantly increased. Bacterial and fungal infections remain important considerations in patients who remain febrile after recovery from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Improved strategies for the diagnosis and prevention of fungal infections in patients with neutropenic fever are clearly needed. 361 Mechanisms of azole resistance in Candida albicans isolates from AIDS patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. D. SANGLARD, M. MONOD, K. KUCHLER* and J. BILLE. Institut de Microbiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), 1011 Lausanne (Switzerland) and *University of Vienna Biocenter, 1030 Vienna (Austria). Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) caused by Candida albicans is a common infection in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Azole antifungals, especially fluconazole, have been used widely to treat OPC. An increasing number of clinical resistance against this antifungal correlating with in vitro resistance have been reported recently. Our goal is to investigate the mechanisms of resistance towards azole antifungals at the molecular level in C. albicans clinical isolates. For this purpose, we dispose of sequential yeast isolates with increasing resistance from several patients treated with fluconazole. We have focused on resistance mechanisms related to the cellular target of azoles (i.e. cytochrome P45014DM or 14DM) and on mechanisms addressing the problem of the transport or accumulation of the antifungals in the clinical isolates. Our results show that 14DM is not a major mediator of azole resistance among our clinical isolates. However, we observed that the fluconazole resistant yeast isolates failed to accumulate [3H]-fluconazole. This phenomenon was reversed in these yeasts by inhibiting the cellular energy supply with azide, suggesting that it could be mediated by efflux pumps such as those described in higher eukaryotes as P-glycoproteins or ABC-transporters. In fact some but not all fluconazole resistant C. albicans clinical isolates examined so far exhibited a 3 to 10-fold relative increase of mRNA for such a recently cloned ABC-transporter gene called CDR1 (Candida Drug Resistance). The CDR1 mRNA increase cannot be considered as a the only molecular event linked to fluconazole resistance since the mRNA for a gene conferring benomyl resistance (BEN) and belonging to the Major Falicitator Superfamily (MFS) was overexpressed in one of the resistant isolates. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, involvement of specific ABC-transporters and of BEN' in the efflux of azole antifungals could be confirmed. 362 Clinica Characteritics and Response to Itraconazole in a Large Outbreak of Acute Pulmonary Hbitoplasmois. D. Nixon*, S. Monroe. Medical Colege of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia We examined the clinical characteristics, radiologic features and response to treatment with Itraconazole (Itra) and prednisone during a large outbreak of acute pulmonary Histoplasma capsulatum (APH) infection at a Virginia correctional facility. The utility of urine Histoplasma antigen and serologic data were also studied. Of 125 patients with serologically confirmed APH, 62 were followed for an average of 4 months. Some patients had a severe syndrome of high fever, chest pain, dry cough, myalgias, headache, and mild to moderate hypoxemia. Others had a more benign course with transient fever or were asymptomatic. Chest x-rays were (+) for interstitial, nodular infiltrates and/or hilar adenopathy in 25/30 patients with significant symptoms. Urine Histo Ag was also obtained in 19 of these patients and had a sensitivity of 72%. Sensitivity increased to 83% when a second sample was obtained 10 days later. 29 patients with moderate to severe symptoms were nonrandomly treated with Itraconazole 400 mg daily. Of these, 6 patients (21%) discontinued the drug due to side effects and another 4 were noncompliant. 19 patients completed approximately 6 weeks of treatment The average duration of fever was 2.4 weeks in treated patients with more severe symptoms and 1.6 weeks in patients with milder symptoms who were not treated with Itra. This is compared with previous published descriptions of APH where most patients improved spontaneously by 2 weeks and nearly all by 8 weeks. 13 of the patients treated with Itra also received a brief tapering course of prednisone that decreased acute high fevers and chest pain dramatically but did not shorten overall duration of fever. A lower incidence of Itra related side effects was noted in this group -8% vs. 41% for the group not receiving prednisone. In conclusion, chest x-ray and urine Histo Ag were moderately sensitive indicators of APH in this series. Although it is possible that Itra may have reduced symptom duration modestly in patients with severe APH, it was associated with a high incidence of side effects. A brief course of prednisone seemed to decrease symptoms acutely and may have decreased the incidence of Itra side effects. The long term effect of treatment on Histo related sequelae remains unknown. 363 Endemic Cryptosporidiosis in Indigent Patients in Houston: Review of 75 Cases. RH HASHMEY, N SMITH, SG CRON, RW GOODGAME, CL CHAPPELL, AC WHITE, JR*. Ben Taub Gen Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, and U Texas, Houston, TX 77030. To further characterize endemic cryptosporidiosis, we identified patients seen between January 1990 and March 1995 at the Harris County Hospital District, which provides health care to 500,000 medically indigent people in Houston. Inpatient, clinic, and emergency room records were reviewed. 7 children (ages 1-5 years) presented with acute, self limited diarrhea; none were HIV positive. Sixty-eight adults were identified, all were HIV positive. Mean age at presentation was 33.8 years. Hispanics and patients whose HIV risk factor was male-to-male sex were over represented compared to the overall HIV clinic population.(24.2 vs 14.3 % and 76.6 vs. 67.2% respectively). Median time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 30 days. All patients experienced diarrhea with a mean stool frequency of lOstools/day (range 3-25). Other important symptoms included weight loss 80%, abdominal discomfort 67%, nausea 62%, bloating 62% and fever 55.7%. 20/52 (38.5%) patients had a temperature of greater than 99.5 F at diagnosis. In 4 cases, another cause of fever was identified. Mean CD4 count was 43 (range 2-240). 44 (65 %) had a prior opportunistic infection. 36/45 (80%) patients treated with paromomycin experienced improvement; however two thirds relapsed. 13(19.1%) had evidence of biliary involvement. Decreased CD4 count was associated with biliary disease (mean 28 vs. 43). Cholecystectomy provided symptomatic relief in 3/3, stenting in 2/2 and sphincterotomy in 1/3 patients with biliary disease. Only 1 of 12 patients receiving newer macrolides at diagnosis developed biliary disease. In these adult patients, cryptosporidiosis was responsible for 89% of emergency room visits, 35% of admissions, but only 4% of deaths. Median survival after diagnosis was 315 days (range 48-843). Cryptosporidiosis continues to be an important opportunistic infection in HIV positive individuals and is associated with a significant morbidity but low mortality with currently available treatments. Biliary disease is associated with lower CD4 counts and may respond to cholecystectomy or stenting. Macrolides may prevent biliary disease. 364 Molecular Phylogeny of Parasitic Nematodes: Speciation of an Unidentified Nematode Associated with Eosinophilic Enterocolitis. L. X. LIU.* Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Molecular phylogenetic studies of diverse nematode species may provide insight into the evolutionary relationships of a broad range of free-living, animal, and human parasitic nematodes. Ribosomal RNA gene sequences are powerful targets for molecular phylogenetic and taxonomic studies. Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed based on known 28S rRNA and 5S rRNA genes of Caenorhabditis elegans and several parasitic nematode species. Using template genomic DNA extractable from even single worms, the 28S rRNA and 5S rRNA spacer genes have been amplified from - 20 species studied thus far, including representatives of Enoplid, Rhabditid, Strongylid, Ascarid, Spirurid, and Oxyurid orders. The multiple nematode 28S rRNA sequences were aligned based on the Jotun-Hein algorithm, and maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining distance methods were used for phylogenetic tree construction. The nematode phylogram based on the 28S rRNA sequence agrees well with traditional phylogenies, and provides a useful molecular tool for phylogenetic studies of parasitic nematodes. This molecular database was instrumental in speciating an unidentified parasitic nematode associated with the following case of eosinophilic enterocolitis: a young Massachusetts native presented with severe abdominal pain and hemorrhagic colitis, with intense eosinophilic infiltration of the ileum and colon. Stool examination revealed numerous nematode larvae -1.0 mm long of an unidentifiable species. No diagnostic adult helminth worms or eggs, protozoa, or bacterial pathogens were isolated. The patient's symptoms resolved following anthelminthic treatment alone. Molecular speciation was performed by cloning the 28S rRNA and 5S rRNA spacer genes from individual worms of the unidentified nematode. The -300 bp 28S rRNA sequence was identical to that of Enterobius vermicularis, and differed from the 28S rRNA sequences of other human intestinal nematodes. The 5S rRNA spacer sequence varies widely in size and base composition between different nematode species. The 5S rRNA spacer sequence of the unknown nematode and E. vermicularis (reference isolate from Los Angeles) were identical in size (893 bp) and 99% identical in nucleotide sequence. Morphologic characteristics indicated that the nematode was an advanced fourth-stage larva of E. vermicularis, which to date have rarely been observed or associated with disease. Occult E. vermicularis infection is both widely prevalent and often difficult to diagnose, and may be a cause of unexplained eosinophilic enterocolitis. 365 SEROPREVALENCE OF ANTIBODY TO BABESIA MICROTI AND A NEWLY DESCRIBED BABESIA-LIKE PIROPLASM (WAI) IN THE U.S. J. ROSENBLATT*', L. SLOANI, J. MAGERA', P. KRAUSE2, M. FINKEL3, P. A. CONRAD4, D. H. PERSING'. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN', University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Hartford, CT2, Midelfort Clinic, LTD, Eau Claire, Wl3, University of California, Davis, CA4. Current screening tests for human exposure to tick-transmitted Babesia microti and related piroplasms are based on serologic testing. An indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was developed at Mayo Clinic for detection of antibody to two known zoonotic piroplasms: Babesia microti (MN2 strain) and an antigenically and genetically distinct piroplasm described in the western United States (WAI). Both isolates were originally obtained from human cases and were propagated in hamsters. 798 sera in five groups were tested: 198 specimens from patients in the Great Lakes region (MN, WI) with a positive Lyme serology; 95 specimens from patients residing in the northeastern United States; 200 sera from blood donors at Mayo Clinic; 119 specimens that were tested in laboratories at Mayo Clinic (from patients throughout the United States); and 186 specimens from adults participating in normal value studies at the Mayo Clinic. Babesia microti antibody was detected in 29/798 (3.6%) of the serum samples. Twenty of the 29 (69%) specimens were confirmed B. microti cases by blood smear, PCR, and/or hamster inoculation. The majority of these positive cases were patients from the northeastern US; the remaining cases were from Lyme disease endemic areas of the upper midwest. WA I reactivity was found in 122/798 (15%) of the specimens tested; 10% had a titer of 1:256, 3% had a titer of 1:512, and 2% had a titer of &gt; :1024. Previous studies of persons infected with WA I and its relatives suggested a cutoff titer of 1:256 to 1:512 as an indicator of past exposure. We conclude that seroreactivity to the WAI piroplasm is not limited to persons residing in the western United States. The lack of geographic clustering of WAI seroreactivity might be indicative of transmission by a tick other than Ixodes dammini. Further serological, PCR, and animal inoculation studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of a titer against WA1.</page><page sequence="63">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 781 366 Comparison of' Three Antigen Assays and Direct Microscopy for Detection of Giardia lamblia in Stool Specimens. J. POHLMAN*, C. KNAPP, M. LUDWIG, M. KATANIK, G. HALL, and D. LONGWORTH. Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH. A total of 75 stool samples were assayed for Giardia lamblia (GL) by direct microscopy (DM), Meridian DFA (MDFA), Cambridge EIA (CEIA), and Alexon EIA (AEIA). Antigen assays were performed according to the manufacturer's printed protocols. Twelve of the 75 stool samples were positive by DM and MDFA. Using DM as the standard method, CEIA had equivalent sensitivity, but had decreased specificity, with three false positives. Two of the three false positives may have been related to interference by the presence of blood cells. AEIA was as specific as DM, but was less sensitive, with five false negatives. The false negatives appeared related to the specimen age, since all five occurred in formalin preserved specimens greater than two months old. All five false negatives by AEIA were positive by CEIA. Direct microscopy appeared to be as sensitive as the antigen assays for the detection of GL in stool specimens submitted to a clinical microbiology laboratory for O&amp;P examination. Enzyme immunoassays may be more rapid and less labor intensive for the examination of large numbers of specimens, since the results may be determined spectrophotometrically or by gross color change and do not require intense microscopic examination. 367 Prospective Study: A Cost Effective Substitute for the Routine O&amp;P Exam in a Community Teaching Hospital. L.D. RAINES*, G.T. VALAINIS, J.M. MILLER, Spartanburg Regional Medical Center, Spartanburg, SC and the CDC, Atlanta, GA. Integrated health care delivery systems and cap- itated reimbursement are forcing laboratory managers to develop new and innovative cost- saving policies. Routine parasitology exam- inations of fecal specimens, involving a concentration procedure and trichrome stain, are time consuming, labor intensive, expensive, and often nonproductive. Over a period of 20 months 1428 specimens were prospectively reviewed yielding 2.7% + rate. All but 1 of the + specimens contained Giardia. We then redefined "routine O&amp;P" to mean only a search for Giardia and Cryptosporidium by the EIA method (ProSpect, Alexon, Sunnyvale, CA.). Traditional O&amp;P testing was done only by special request. One year later (2/94-2/95), the number of complete O&amp;P exams were reduced by 92%, reducing total cost by 30% ($4205); tech time was reduced 80% (337 hours), and the + rate remained constant at 2.7%. All positive EIA's were confirmed by direct micro- scopy. No Cryptosporidium were found during this prospective study. If screening were limited to Giardia only, the net result in total cost savings would then drop to 60% (another $4163) with an additional savings of 6% (27 hours) in labor. Conclusion: Replacing the traditional O&amp;P exam with an EIA screen for Giardia and Crypto- sporidium has proven to be cost-effective without a negative impact on patient outcome. 368 Molecular Modeling of Phosphofuctokinase from Ertamoeba histolytica for the Prediction of New Antiparasitic Agents. CL. BYINGTON, R.L. DUNBRACK, F.E. COHEN, and N. AGABIAN. The University of Califrnia, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA Virtually all organisms utilize adenosine triphosphat (ATP) for subste level phosphorylations during glycolysis; however, it has been recognized that the parasitic protists lacking mitochondria have glycolytic enzymes which utilize inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) as the high energy phosphate donor instead of ATP. PPi- phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) is the rate limiting glycolytic enzyme found in Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Toxoplama gonidi, Trichooas vagialis, and Naegleriafowleri, and as such represents an important drug rge Current therapy for these infections is not ideal, especially for pregnant women and children, and newer, selective agents would be welcome. The primary amino acid sequences of PPi-PFK from Enamoeba histolytica (Huang,M. et al 1995), Giardia hamblia (Rozario,C. et al 1995) and Naegleria fowkri (Wessberg,K.L. et al unpublished) have been compared to gain insight into how these sequences differ from those of known ATP-PFKs, including human. Although the primary amino acid sequences of the known PPi-PFKs and ATP-PFKs share little overall identity, there are areas of strong homology (60-80%) in several regions representing the known active sites of these enzymes. Because of this, tmcture based molecular modeling has the potential to make useful predictions about the structure of the PPi-PFK pyrophosphate binding site, and potential drug-target interactions at the site. From the crystallographic structure of Bacillus stearohernnophilus ATP-PFK, a stereochemically reasonable model for Entamoeba histolytica PPi-PFK has been constructed using Look (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA). This model has been validated by several computational strategies including, comparison with a backbone dependent rotamer library for analysis of side chain orientation, QPACK to evaluate side chain volume and packing, and Verify to evaluate side chain-side chain environment complementarity. The model has been used to screen the Available Chemicals Directory (Molecular Design Limited, San Leandro, CA) for potential inhibitm of pyroposphate binding, using Dock 3.5. The most promising candidates will be tested in vivo. In addition, several pyrophosphate analogs have been tested in the lab, and two of thse inhibit the growth of Entamoeba histolytica. These chemicals were modeled using the algorithm CONCORD, and their interactions at the active site assessed. These modeling studies have the potential to identify clinically useful broad spectrum antiparasitic agents.

KRAUSE2, P. CONRAD3, J. ROSENBLATT', D. H. PERSING'. Mayo Clinic', Rochester, MN, University of Connecticut School of Medicine2, Hartford, CT, University of California3, Davis, CA. Until recently, only two piroplasm species, B. microti and B. divergens, were known to infect humans. In 1991, a zoonotic Babesia- like piroplasm (WA I) was identified. WA I is phylogenetically related to some small Babesia spp. and to lymphoproliferative piroplasms of the series Theileria, even to the exclusion of some members of the genus Babesia itself. WA I seroprevalence studies have suggested that exposure to this piroplasm or its relatives may not be restricted to the western U.S. In order to further characterize WA I seroreactive subjects, we sought to develop a broad-range PCR-based system for detection of all small Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. described to date. Multiple sequence alignment of nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (nss-RNA) sequences identified genus, species, and family specific regions suitable for development of a broad-range PCR-based system for piroplasm detection. Use of the broad-range system to detect known piroplasm species, showed that all of the small piroplasms currently classified as Babesia spp. (B. microti, B. equi, B. gibsoni) were reactive, as were all of the piroplasms related to WA I. B. canis, a large Babesia spp., was nonreactive. Blood samples from twelve patients infected with piroplasms (seven with B. microli, one with WAI, and four from California patients infected with piroplasms similar to WA I) were analyzed with the broad-range as well as B. microti specific systems. The broad-range system detected piroplasm DNA in all samples that were positive for B. microti, as well as samples positive for WA I and its relatives, whereas the B. microti-specific system only detected B. microti. We conclude that broad-range detection of the small Babesia and Theileria spp. can be accomplished by amplification of conserved regions of the 18S ribosomal gene. This system can be used directly on clinical samples and potential tick vectors for detection of known and previously unknown piroplasm species. Application of this system to the analysis of WA I seroreactive subjects may help to delineate the basis of WA I seroreactivity in persons from areas of the U.S. considered non-endemic for babesiosis. 370 Toxoplasmosis in Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT). F. MOMIN*, M. KHOULANI, L. CHEREDNIKOVA, P.H. CHANDRASEKAR AND BMT TEAM. Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, Ml. Toxoplasmosis is infrequently described in marrow recipients living in non-endemic areas. Commonly used prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against Pneumocvstis carinii may explain the reduced incidence. During Jan. 1987-Mar. 1995, 662 patients underwent BMT (65% allogeneic) in our unit. There were 101 autopsies of 338 deaths; disseminated toxoplasmosis was discovered in 3 cases at autopsy. Case 1: An 18-year old female, toxoplasma seropositive, with acute graft-versus-host disease and cytomegalovirus enteritis, developed respiratory distress on day +90 BMT. Open lung biopsy showed toxoplasma pneumonitis. She died of respiratory failure. Autopsy confirmed biopsy findings. Case 2: A 29-year old female, toxoplasma seronegative, received HLA- identical marrow from an unrelated donor (? toxoplasma serostatus). On day +5 BMT, she developed cardio-respiratory failure. Severe cytopenia prevented an invasive procedure. She died on day + 12 BMT prior to marrow engraftment. Autopsy revealed disseminated toxoplasmosis involving lungs, heart, kidneys and thyroid. Case 3: A 47-year old female, toxoplasma seropositive, underwent syngeneic BMT. Marrow engraftment was prompt but she died on day + 62 with cardio-respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed toxoplasma myocarditis. Previous literature describes toxoplasmosis as a reactivation disease in allogeneic marrow recipients. In contrast, 1 of our patients was toxoplasma seronegative and thus may have acquired the organism via BMT and another reactivated toxoplasma after syngeneic BMT. Rapid progression to death is common without timely therapeutic intervention. A diagnosis of toxoplasmosis must be entertained in marrow recipients with cardio-respiratory failure of unclear etiology. 371 Cytokine Responses in Interferon-y Monotherapy for Kala-azar. R.T. Kenney*, S. Sundar, D.L. Sacks, H.W. Murray. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, and Corell University Medical College, New York, NY. Visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar, is an intracellular infection of macrophages characterized by steady progression to death without treatment. A hallmark of disease is antigen specific unresponsiveness in assays of cellular immunity, which reverses following cure. This may be a result of the presence of IL-10 in lesional tissues of active patients and its absence following treatment. Because IFN-y has been shown to augment antimony therapy in vivo and to be critical in the activation of macrophages to kill Leishmania in vitro, we conducted a trial of IFN-y monotherapy and measured the cytokine mRNA in serial splenic aspirates taken every ten days. Nine patients were treated for twenty days with IFN-y 100 g/m2 sc daily. The five responders, defined as decreasing on the splenic aspirate parasite score, were given ten additional days of IFNy monotherapy. All patients eventually required standard therapy with intravenous pentavalent antimony for thirty days, which was curative. There were no deaths and side-effects to IFN-y were minimal. Excess cells from the diagnostic splenic aspirates were placed in RNazol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, then the cytokine genes were amplified and compared with HPRT amplified as the normalizing control. IFN-y mRNA decreased in all patients by day 10 but returned to near baseline by the end of treatment. IL-10 message was high before and dunng treatment in all patients. In the five who partially responded, IL-10 nearly doubled with continued IFN-y therapy. IL-4 message remained high throughout the course of treatment. These findings represent responses both to the IFN-yand the underlying disease. Message for IFN-y fell initially with exogenous IFN-y, suggesting the presence of a negative feedback. Despite a partial response in the parasite score in five patients, IL-10 remained elevated, and may have been driven higher as a counter-regulatory response to continued IFN-y treatment. IFN-y is clearly not sufficient as monotherapy for kala-azar. Serial measurements of cytokines can help delineate the immune responses in lesional tissue that lead to the persistence or resolution of an intracellular infection with Leishmania.</page><page sequence="64">782 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 372 Susceptibility of healthy adults to reinfection with Cryptosporidium parvum. PC OKHUYSEN*, HL DUPONT, CL CHAPPELL, CR STERLING. The University of Texas-Houston Medical School and School of Public Health, Houston TX. University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ. Low numbers of C. parvum oocysts can cause infection in C. parvum-naive healthy adults (Iowa strain, ID 50 for humans=132 oocysts). However, it is unknown if humans are susceptible to reinfection One year after initial challenge with 30-106 oocysts, 19. healthy adult volunteers thoroughly screened for immunodeficiency were rechallenged with 500 oocysts of a homologous C. parvum isolate. Volunteers recorded the number and form of stools passed and symptoms experienced. All stools passed were collected daily for two weeks, and 24 hour samples were collected twice a week for a total of sixty days. Oocyst excretion was assessed by immunofluorescence (Merifluor, Meridian Diagnostics). Unformed stools were cultured for common bacterial enteropathogens. Table lists no. volunteers infected, volunteers with diarrhea and oocyst positive stools and, volunteers with diarrhea without oocysts in stools for each of the challenges. Outcome Challenge p value First Second (Fisher's) C. parvum Infection 12119 3/19 &lt;.01 Cryptosporidiosis 5/19 0/19 &lt;.05 Diarrhea without oocysts 0/19 3/19 NS When compared to the initial challenge, fewer subjects became infected after the second challenge (63% vs. 16%, p&lt;.01) even when adjusted for those receiving an inocula of 500 in both occasions (100% vs. 16%, p&lt;.02). Cryptosporidiosis did not occur after rechallenge (none vs. 38%/ p&lt;.05). However, three volunteers (16%) experienced diarrhea after the second challenge in the absence of C. parvum or other enteric pathogens. These data suggest that initial exposure to C. parvum offers partial protection to reinfection with a homologous strain. The occurrence of diarrhea after rechallenge in the absence of C. parvum excretion may be due to lack of sensitivity of current diagnostic methods for the detection of C. parvum. 373 Atovaquone Failures in Ambulatory Patients with Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia A. BANDELL*, M. MOGYOROS, M. RAEBEL and J. RAMIREZ, Kaiser Permanente, Denver CO. Our group model HMO added atovaquone to the formulary in February 1993 as an oral alternative therapy for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS patients who could not tolerate or who had failed trimethoprim/sulfamethozaxole (TMP/SMX). Standard doses of 750mg three times daily were prescribed for the treatment of PCP in five (5) AIDS patients between May 1993 and February 1994. Four of the five patients were started empirically on atovaquone based on clinical presentation, chest radiograph and blood gases. Two patients empirically started on therapy had bronchoscopy proven PCP shortly after initiation of therapy. All patients had been receiving prophylaxis with either aerosolized pentamidine (3), tmp/smx (1) or dapsone (1). For two patients this was their initial presentation with PCP. All five patients had either mild or moderate PCP. All five patients failed therapy for PCP with atovaquone. Four out of five patients required hospitalization for the treatment of PCP after failing atovaquone. Hospitalization costs were approximately 900/day. Patients who were hospitalized received either IV pentamidine (+ /-) steroids or clindamycin and primaquine. Patients were discharged receiving pentamidine from home IV therapy (3) or oral clindamycin and primaquine (1). One patient was treated with dapsone, tmp/smx and steroids as an outpatient. Atovaquone has not been a cost effective course of therapy in our patient population. We are no longer recommending the use of atovaquone in its present formulation for our AIDS patients with suspected or proven PCP. 374 Protective immunity in onchocerciasis: identification of novel larval parasite antigens recognized by serum from individuals resistant to infection. J.S. McCARTHY', N. RAGHAVAN, A.L. SCOTT, S. WILLIAMS and T.B. NUTMAN. Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore MD, and Smith College, Northampton MA. Evidence from epidemiological studies in endemic regions and from experimental animal models suggests the existence of protective immunity in filarial infection. The paucity of parasite material, particularly from the L3 and L4 larval-stage of the parasites, (the stages likely to be the focus of immune attack), has hampered identification of antigens which may be vaccine candidates. To identify such antigens, cDNA expression libraries were constructed from larvae of Onchocerca volvulus (OV) and from the related filarial parasite Brugia malayi (BM) using novel strategies that use small parasite numbers. These were screened using a serum pool from 10 individuals identified as being potentially immune to OV infection. Of the 14 unique recombinants identified in the BM libraries, 9 were found exclusively in the L3 stage and 2 in the L4, with 3 present in both. An additional 16 unique recombinants have been identified in the OV L3 library. 16 recombinants have homology to previously described proteins while 2 have homology to C. elegans sequences of unknown function; 12 encode polypeptides without homology to any known proteins. While preliminary screening of these recombinant antigens with different serum pools suggests that many are recognized by pools from infected subjects, and therefore likely to be common antigens recognized by all individuals exposed to the parasite, 3 appear to be preferentially recognized by the immune serum pool. As recombinants uniquely recognized by individuals immune to infection are of particular interest, the characterization of the pattern of recognition by individual sera from both infected and immune groups is underway. Recombinant antigens with such characteristics are likely to merit evaluation as vaccine candidates. 375 Ten Year Surveillance of Echinococcal Heart Disease from a Referral Hospital in Greece F. KARDARAS, G. SAROGLOU*, D. TSELIKOS, D. KARDARA, E.E. MYLONAKIS, A. TSOUKAS, M. LAZANAS, I. ANTHO- POULOS and C. LOLAS. "Evangelismos" Hospital, Athens, Greece. Ten cases of hydatid heart disease were evaluated in a 10- year period (1984-1994). Cysts were located in left ventricular wall (4), right ventricular wall (1), interventricular septum (1), interatrial septum (1), right atrium (1), pericardium (1) and multiple foci (1). Clinical manifestations were anaphylactic shock (1), chest pain (5), constrictive pericarditis (1), pulmonary embolism (2) and systemic embolism (1). CT-scan was found useful in the detection of hydatid cysts, but 2-D echocardiography was superior in the identification of hydatid cysts of the heart for both location and appearance. Magnetic resonance was performed in 3 patients with satisfactory imaging. Four out of 10 patients expired due to rupture of pulmonary echinococcal cyst (1), cerebral embolism (1) and massive pulmonary hydatid embolism (2). Six patients were successfully treated with surgical removal of the cysts by open heart surgery. No antiparasitic drugs were used. In conclusion, cardiac echinococcosis is associated with an increased risk of potentially lethal complications. Newer techniques of cardiac imaging have helped locate the cyst, while surgical removal is safe and lifesaving. 376 Chaning Epidemioog of Malaria in Boston. J ROSS* and J K GRIFFITHS. St. Elizabeths Medical Center of Boston, Tufts University Schoo of Medicne, Boston Massachusetts. RATIONALE: Malaria is a risk to travellers and is a major diagsti consideration when fever develops in this group. The epidemiology of malaria is in flux in North America St. Elizabeth Medical Center, a tertiary care referral center, also serves a local poor and working dass, recent immigrnt community in Boston. In 1990 we reported more cases of malaria to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts than any other hospital in the state. We reviewed all cases of malaria diagnosed 1980- 1994 to see if new trends were present. RESULTS: 32 malaria cases were diagosed in I I women and 21 men during 1980-94. Begining in 1990, a marked shift in the region of acquisition and species of malaria occurred. Before 1990, only 2 of 14 malaria cases were acquired in Africa, and P. viwx accounted for 86% of cases(12/14). Choroqine prophylis appeared efectie unless drug noncompliance was present. After 1989, 14/18 cases were acquired in Africa; I 1/18 (61 %) were P. facipon. Failures of both choroquine and mefloquine prophylis occurred. 3 cases of P. vwix were acquired in India or Pakistan in both time periods, and all were in dividuals who had not undertaken any chemoprophylas. Many cases occurred during visits to countries of origin. CONCLUSIONS: A marked shift in the species, and regon of acquisition, of malaria has occurred in our population. P. falcparurn has become more prevaent, and the major regons of acqisitio has shifted, from Southeast Asia and Latin America, to Africa (F statistic 12.01 1, p= 0.002). Drug resitance resulted in an increased rate of prophyaxis failure in Africa. Further epidemiological and dinical details will be presented in the poster session. 377 EXPRESSION OF CECROPIN A, AN ANTI- TRYPANOSOMAL PEPTIDE, IN ENDOSYMBIOTIC BACTERIA OF RHODNIUS PROLIXUS R. Durvasula, S. Aksoy, B. Beard and F.R. Richards Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT The strategy of expressing foreign genes in arthropod vectors to limit spread of parasitic diseases has been applied to the system responsible for Chaga's Disease: the vector, Rhodnius prolixus, the parasite, Trvpanosoma cruzi, and Rhodococcus rhodnii a streptomycete endosymbiont of R. prolixus. A streptomycete-derived shuttle plasmid, pRr 4.1/22, containing the origin of replication of E. Coli and R. rhodnii, a thiostrepton resistance gene, and a gene encoding for mature cecropin A was constructed. Cecropin A is a 38 amino acid peptide with cidal activity against gram negative organisms and T. cruzi, but little activity against R. rhodnii. Wild type R. rhodnii isolated from the Colombia strain of R. prolixus were transformed with the shuttle plasmid and grown under thiostrepton selection. In vitro expression of cecropin A by the transformants was demonstrated using Western Blot. Cell-free protein extracts of the transformants exhibited cidal activity against E. coli and inhibitory effects on T.cruzi. Similar effects were not observed with extracts of wild type bacteria. Newly emerged aposymbiotic R. prolixus which were fed transformants with their first blood meal successfully reached the adult stage. Effects of these bacteria on transmission of T. cruzi will be presented.</page><page sequence="65">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 783 378 Frequency of Intestinal Parasites in Adult Cancer Patients in Mexico.

METHOD:We studied 100 DS and 100 NDS using Faust and Sheather techniques and direct smear. RESULTS: NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH DS NDS Negative O&amp;P 66 78 p 0.08 Non pathogenic parasites 8 7 Pathogenic parasites 26 15 p 0.08 Entamoeba histolytica 12 2 p 0.01 Hymenolepis nana 8 10 Giardia lamblia 3 6 Cryptosporidium sp 5 0 p 0.06 Ascaris lumbricoides 2 0 Strongyloides stercoralis 2 0 Isospora sp 1 0 More than one parasite was identified in 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS:The percent of pathogenic parasitosis in adult cancer patients with NDS is similar to that reported in - the mexican population, increasing to double when they have DS. E.histolytica is a common cause of diarrhea in cancer patients. The incidence of G.lamblia is reduced compared - to other reports, in this study it was more frequent in - NDS. Cryptosporidium and Isospora account for 6% of DS, thus the need of using special techniques for their detec- tion. We found 2 cases with DS caused by S.stercoralis - making O&amp;P study important in third world countries. 379 The relationship of drug exposure to the HIV protease inhibitor L735524 to decreases in HIV RNA. DS STEIN*, GL DRUSANO. Albany Medical College, Albany NY. The orally bioavailable HIV protease inhibitor L735524 (MK-639) was given at a dose of 600mg q6h to five participants with CD4 &lt;300 cells/tl and HIV RNA by quantitative PCR of &gt;20000 copies/ml as part of a Phase 1 evaluation of its safety and activity. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed at day 1 and 15 and HIV RNA by PCR at baseline and every 2 weeks. The mean concentration of HIV RNA over 12 weeks was determined by integrating the area under the log HIV RNA curve by the program LAGRAN and then dividing by 12. In order to assess whether a relationship existed between drug exposure (AUCo.^) and changes in HIV RNA copies/ml, the data were fit to an inhibitory sigmoid-Emax relationship. The dif- ference in mean HIV RNA over time minus the baseline and the fractional inhibition in HIV RNA generation were fit to a sigmoid-Emax relationship. The fractional inhibition of HIV generation was determined by fitting the differential equations shown below to the data. All nonlinear regression was performed using ADAPT II. dRNA/dT R( R(2)-RNALN*(KNBLKBL-LN dRNAnL = RNALN*KLN.BL-RNABL*KBL-LN The mean log,,HIV RNA copies/ml over time vs. AUCo.had a resulting fit of r =0.962, maximum of 5.13 loggo RNA copies/ml, Emax=2.014 log,o RNA copies/ml, with a 50% effect at an AUCo., of 17620 nM*hr. The difference in mean log,0HIV RNA copies/ml from baseline, which eliminates the variability of different starting viral loads, had a resulting r:=0.928, Emax=2.125, with a 50% effect at an AUCo. of 18060 nM*hr. The model of the fractional inhibition of HIV RNA generation which depends solely on changes in log, HIV RNA copies/ml from baseline, had a resulting fit of r2=0.999, Emax=3.527, with a 50% effect at an AUCo, of 18270 nM*hr. These complementary models, based on different assumptions, all indicate evidence of an exposure-effect relationship of a HIV protease inhibitor and decreases in viral load. The expansion of such models into larger data sets will significantly enhance our ability to define adequate exposure response relationships to maximize activity while minimizing toxicity and potentially unnecessary drug exposure. 380 Treatment of Genital Warts with Imiquimod Cream. L. ERONi' , L. EDWARDS , A. FERENCZ? , D. BAKER, T. FOX , K. GAYOSO , A. HOUGHAM , M. OWENS , AND THE IMIQUIMOD STUDY GROUP. Infectious Diseases Physicians,2 Annandale, VA , Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC Jewish General H9spital, Montreal, Quebec , State Univer- sity of New York , and 3M Pharmaceuticals, St. Paul, MN Imiquimod (IQ) is an immunomodulator which induces interferon in leukocytes. A multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IQ, formulated as a 1% and 5% topi- cal cream, in the treatment of external genital warts. Study cream was self applied to 311 patients thrice weekly, overnight for 8 hours, for 16 weeks or until wart clearance. Patients were then followed for an additional 12 weeks for wart recurrence. A total of 109, 102, and 100 patients received 5% IQ, 1% IQ, and vehicle, respectively. Wart clearance was observed in 56%, 27%, and 14%, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). The median time to wart clearance was 10 weeks, 12 weeks, and 12 weeks, respectively. Females had a higher clearance rate (77%, 46%, 28%, respectively) than males (40%, 10%, 6%, respectively). Additionally, females demon- strated a shorter median time to clearance (8 weeks) than males (12 weeks) in both IQ groups. Wart recurrence was noted in 13%, 0%, and 10%, respectively, during the follow up period. Erythema was reported in 67%, 26%, and 24%, respectively, with the marjority of reports mild to mode- rate in intensity. Compared to other wart treatments, 5% IQ cream demonstrated a high clearance rate, a low recur- rence rate, and an acceptable safety profile, with the additional advantage of being a self-administered cream. 381 A Method for Herpesvirus Drug Sensitivity Testing Using Semiquantitative PCR. P. TEBAS *, P.D. OLIVO. Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri. The emergence of drug resistant herpesvirus infections in immuno- compromised hosts who have been on antiviral treatment for long periods of time is a well known phenomena. Plaque reduction assay (PRA) is the method most commonly used to test HSV, CMV or VZV strains for their susceptibility to antivirals, and it is generally considered the "gold standard". This test is cumbersome to perform and its results are rarely available in time to influence the treatment We report here the development of a PCR based, sensitivity test for HSV (and other herpesvirus). The test uses a semiquantitative PCR approach to estimate DNA yields in the presence or the absence of the drug to be tested (in our case acyclovir 0 and 2 tg/ml). Briefly, VERO cells in a 96 well microtiter plate are infected with two fold dilutions of the test virus. After 48 hours of infection, the couple of wells that give around j0% of cytopatic effect in the absence of drug are lysed. Then, serial 10 fold dilutions of this lysate are used to amplify a 211 bp product in the DNA polymerase gene. The PCR products are then run in an agarose gel and stained with etidium bromide. Sensitive virus show at least a two log difference between the last positive dilution in the presence and in the absence of drug. Resistant isolates do not show a difference. The test allows to score the isolate resistant or sensitive and this result correlates with the one obtained in a "standard" PRA in the laboratory and clinical strains tested (that included several well characterized mutants). We are currently adapting this system for use with CMV. This method is easy to perform, fast (the results are available 48 hours after the isolation of the virus), reproducible, and correlates well with the plaque reduction assay. It can also be used as a screening method before performing a "standard" plaque reduction assay of clinical isolates and as rapid screening method of new antiviral drugs. 382 Oral Acyclovir can Successfully Treat Primary Varicella and Zoster in HIV-1 Infected Children. C.WORRELIf, W.BORKOWSKY,A.KAUL,V.PAPAEVANGELOU, K.KRASINSKI.NYU Medic.Cntr/Bellevue Hosp.,NY, NY. Current recommendations for the treatment of primary varicella and zoster infections in immunocompromised individuals call for the administration of intravenous acyclovir. In the period from August 1989 to March 1995, 41 children with HIV infection presented to the pediatric infectious disease clinic at Bellevue Hospital with primary varicella or zoster. Of this number 33 charts were available for review. Nineteen episodes of primary varicella were documented: 3 children received no treatment; 2 patients were treated with intravenous acyclovir alone; 12 patients were treated with oral acyclovir alonei 1 patient was treated initially with po acyclovir and then changed to IV therapy; and 1 patient was initially treated with IV therapy and subsequently changed to oral therapy. Only 2 patients received VZIG. No complications were observed. Slow resolution (&gt;10 days) was seen in 3 patients, all of whom were treated with oral acyclovir. Twenty-four episodes of zoster were documented in seventeen patients: 1 patient was not treated; 9 were treated with intravenous acyclovir alone; 10 were treated with oral acyclovir alone; 4 were treated with both intravenous and oral therapy. No complications were observed. CD4 percentage at presentation ranged from 0-35% (mean 21.3%, median 23%)in the group with primary varicella, and from 0-39%(mean 14.4%, median 18%) in the group with zoster. Age at presentation ranged from 0.2-17years(mean 6yrs) and 2-15years(mean 8.2yrs) in the primary varicella and zoster groups respectively. Oral acyclovir successfully treats primary varicella and zoster infections in HIV-1 infected children. 383 Nevirapine (NVP) in Combination with Zidovudine (ZDV) vs ZDV in nucleoside experienced patients. D Paar(1), R Pollard(l), D Hall(2), M Myera(2), P Robinson (2), &amp; Study 1037 Team. (1) Univ of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX; (2) Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, CT. The safety and activity of NVP (200 mg BID) plus ZDV (200mg TID) versus ZDV alone were assessed in a 6 month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty HIV-1 infected, ZDV-experienced patients with 200-500 CD4+ cells/mm3 were included. Thirty patients randomized to ZDV + NVP had median CD4+ cell counts of 393/mm3 and 2.6 x 104 copies HIV RNA; 40% were p24 antigenimic. Thirty ZDV+ placebo patients had 339 CD4+ cells/mm3 and 1.7 x 104 copies HIV RNA/ml; 27% were p24 +. Plasma viral RNA levels were reduced early but retured to baseline at 12- 16 weeks. Median RNA AUCMB for ZDV + NVP was significantly elevated compared to ZDV at both 16 weeks (p&lt;0.001) and 28 weeks (p=0.01). ZDV + NVP had a median CD4+ increase of -40 cells at 12-16 weeks, an 11% increase over baseline. The ZDV group was 6% below baseline (-22 cells). The CD4+ count for ZDV + NVP declined to 6% above baseline (+22 cells) for the averaged 20-28 weeks versus ZDV only which was 7% below baseline (-26 cells). There was a statistically significant difference in NAUCs through 12-16 wks and 20-28wks for CD4+ cell count and %CD4+ (each, p&lt;0.001). p24 antigen reduction in the ZDV + NVP group was greater compared to ZDV at both 12-16 (p=0.013) and 20-28 weeks (p=0.007). NVP added to ongoing ZDV in asymptomatic patients produced a significant early response in CD4+ count and percent which remained elevated out to six months, vs. ZDV only. There was a dramatic, initial viral RNA decrease which was not maintained; CD4 response was considerably more sustained.</page><page sequence="66">784 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 384 Exploratory Analyses of Treatment Response of Surrogate Markers in ACTG 241. M Myers1 for ACTG 241 Study Team. 1Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals. Ridgefield CT. ACTG 241 was a double blind randomized surrogate marker trial of double (ZDV+ddl) vs triple (Nevirapine+ZDV+ddl) therapy in extensively nudeoside experienced HIV-1 infected patients (CD4&lt;350 cells). The overall analysis demonstrated significant superiority of triple over double at 48wks for CD4 count, %CD4. plasma HIV RNA. PBMC microculture and p24 antigen. Both protocol planned and exploratory analyses were performed, focusing on CD4 strata and previous nucleoside therapy as predictors of response. Strata were CD4 cells:S50 vs 51-200 vs ?200; and prior nudeoside therapy: ZDV only vs others. ZDV only offered an opportunity to quantify the impact of adding ddl or ddl+NVP to ongoing ZDV therapy. Difference (by treatment group) in immune response was greatest in the 51- 200 CD4 stratum at 40-48wks (triple: 38 cell advantage over double), contrasted with the &gt;200 CD4 group (triple: 11 cell advantage) and the &lt;50 CD4 group (triple: 1.7cell advantage). RNA differences were comparable for the upper two strata (0.29 and 0.24 log10 reductions, respectively) but trended lower for the &lt;50 CD4 group (0.10 log reduction, not statistically significant). Double therapy in patients with prior therapy of only ZDV (ddl added to ZDV) produced sustained CD4 and RNA changes in the &gt;200 CD4 group: CD4 increased by &gt;50 cells and remained elevated &gt;25 cells at 48 wks. HIV decreased by&gt;1 log and remained down by &gt;0.5 log at 48 wks. However, triple therapy (ddl+NVP added to ZDV) in this group was superior to double (CD4 increases: maximum &gt;80 cells: 48 wks:&gt;38cells; RNA decreases: maximum &gt;2 logs: 48wks:&gt;.7 log). CD4 and RNA returned to baseline by wk 48 in double therapy/CD4 51-200/ZDV. Triple therapy/CD4 51-200/ZDV had more sustained benefit: CD4 was 25 cells &gt;baseline and RNA was 0.75 &lt;baseline at wk 48. Each baseline factor had a similar qualitative effect on response for both treatment group. The treatment response was consistently greater for the triple group. Overall findings significantly favored triple therapy and this analysis indicates that responses to both regimens, including the more advantageous triple therapy are greater in certain subgroups. 385 SUSCEPTIBILITY OF HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (HCMV) TO 2-DRUG COMBINATIONS IN VITRO. D.J. Manion, A. Vibhagool, T.-C. Chou, J. Kaplan, A. Caliendo, M.S. Hirsch, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University, Boston, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA. HCMV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for immunocompromised hosts. We sought to determine the in vitro susceptibility of HCMV reference strains (AD 169 and Towne), clinical isolates and strains with known resistance to currently available anticytomegaloviral drugs to 2-drug combinations of the following compounds: ganciclovir [(9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2- propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG)], foscarnet [phosphonoformate (PFA)], cidofovir [(S)- 1-(3-hydroxy-2- phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (HPMPC)], lobucavir [1 R- (1 a,2R,3a)-2-amino-9[2,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclobutyl]- 1,9-dihydro-6H-purin-6-one (CAS)], 2'nor-cGMP, 9-(2- phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA). Antiviral effect was determined by plaque reduction assay in human embryonic lung cells (MRC-5). Cytotoxicity was determined by trypan blue exclusion of cells exposed both when proliferating and once confluent. Drug interactions were determined by median-dose effect analysis with the combination index (Cl) calculated at several efficacy doses (ED50, ED75, ED90, ED99). A variety of interactions was observed among the different combinations at non- toxic concentrations, ranging from antiviral synergy to antagonism. In vitro combination drug studies will allow for the rational choice of therapeutic regimens to enter clinical trials with the resultant potential benefits of decreased toxicity, increased efficacy and delayed onset of drug resistance. 386 AEROSOLIZED RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV) ANTIBODY DELIVERED TO THE LUNGS OF COTTON RATS. John P. DeVincenzo. G.G. Krishna Murthy. William A. Skornik. Joseph D. Brain. Jim Mclver and George R. Siber. Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories, Boston, MA. Parenteral administration of IgG class RSV antibodies is effective in preventing or treating RSV pulmonary infection in experimental animals. Much lower doses of RSV antibodies are effective when given topically by aerosol or by direct instillation. We therefore evaluated the pharmacokinetics of RSVIG (a human polyclonal IgG immune globulin with high RSV microneutralization titers) given by aerosol to the cotton rat. The RSVIG was formulated for nebulization in physiologic chloride and without albumin or sucrose stabilizers. It was generated by jet nebulization which produced a count median particle diameter of 1.51gm with oG of 1.43 (95% &lt; 2.68gm). RSVIG was delivered at a mean concentration of 0.585mg/i through an Amesa nose-only exposure system. Animals were exposed to this aerosol for 8 minutes. Groups of animals were then sacrificed at 5 hours and at 1,2,4 and 7 days after receiving RSV-IG. The animals' pulmonary arteries were flushed with PBS and their lungs were removed. One half of the lung was lavaged and the other half was homogenized. Serum, lung lavage and lung homogenates were assayed for total human IgG by sandwich EIA. Fluid Sampled Time Post RSV-IG Aerosol Lung T1/2 5hrs Id 2d 4d 7d (hrs) Serum (ng/ml) 95 243 250 286 304 ---- Lung Homogenate 36720 13992 7970 2635 1273 35.5 (ng/gm lung) Total lung RSV-IG recoverable 8161 3885 1630 763 268 34.7 by lung homogenate (ng) Total lung RSV-IG recoverable 4013 1830 1035 524 57 28.3 by lung lavage (ng) Aerosol administration rapidly delivers high concentrations of IgG to the lung. Approximately half of this delivered IgG can be recovered from the epithelial lining fluid, the pharmacologic compartment accessible by lung lavage. The epithelial surface of the lung is where the expected RSV neutralizing effect of RSVIG occurs in vivo. In summary, aerosolized IgG persists for extended periods of time on the epithelial surfaces of the lung suggesting that extended dosing intervals will provide protection. Aerosolization may be an attractive method of delivering IgG in future trials of RSV prophylaxis. 387 RECEIPT OF RECOMMENDED MEDICAL CARE FOR WOMEN INFECTED WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV). HessolNAl, Palacio H1, Padian N1, Wofsy C1, Cohen Jl, Brosgart C2, Clanon K3, Greenblatt RM1. IUniversity of California, San Francisco; 2Alta Bates Hospital, Berkeley; 3Highland Hospital, Oakland. Recommended medical care for women with HIV infection includes antiviral treatment as well as screening for diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) and cervical cancer, and vaccination against infections, such as influenza. In this study, we evaluated receipt of recommended care among women infected with HIV. From 5/92-9/94, women were recruited from HIV clinics and research studies in the San Francisco Bay area for a natural history study of HIV infection. Risk factors considered in bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses included: demographic and socio-economic variables, sexual behaviors, medical health history, and substance abuse. Outcomes for receipt of recommended medical care included: annual screening for TB and cervical cancer, annual influenza vaccination, and use of antiviral therapy for those with CD4 cells counts below 500. One hundred seventy-four HIV-infected women had data available for analysis. The mean age was 35 (range 19-59); 38% were African American, 8% were Latina, and 50% were White. In the past year, 72% of the women received a TB test, 93% received a Pap test, and 62% a flu vaccine. Among the 48 women with a CD4 cell count of &lt;500, 77% reported a history of antiviral use. In multivariate analyses, crack users were significantly less likely to have received a TB test in the past year, current smokers were significantly less likely to have received a Pap test in the past year, and never married women were significantly less likely to have received a flu vaccine in the past year. Among women with CD4 cell counts &lt;500, those without medical insurance were significantly less likely to have had of antiviral therapy. The women in this study were recruited from HIV clinics and research studies and potentially had greater access to recommended medical care. Despite this access, many of the women in this study did not receive recommended medical care. In additon, receipt of medical care was not uniform: women who were crack users, cigarette smokers, never married, and those without medical insurance were less likely to have received recommended care. 388 Pre-transplant Famciclovir for Prophylaxis of Recur- rent Hepatitis B Virus Hepatitis After Liver Transplantation. N SINGH,* T GAYOWSKI, IR MARINO. VAMC, Pittsburgh, PA. In HBsAg positive patients with endstage liver disease due to Hepatitis B virus (HBV), HBV DNA positivity is considered a contra- indication for liver transplantation due to universal recurrence of HBV in such patients. Pretransplant therapy with interferon has not been effective against the prevention of posttransplant HBV recurrence and is poorly tolerated in patients with endstage liver disease. Use of famciclovir as pretransplant prophylaxis for the prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation, in HBV DNA positive patients, has previously not been reported. Famciclovir 500 mg orally q.i.d. for 2 weeks and then 500 mg orally t.i.d. was used in 3 HBsAg positive and HBV DNA positive patients with cirrhosis in immediate need for liver transplantation (all 3 were Child Pugh class C) Pre-transplant HBV DNA titer ranged from 4.3 to 53.3 pg/ml. In one patient, HBV DNA declined by 60% (53.3 to 3.2 pg/ml) after 19 days of famciclovir, however, the patient died on day 20 due to complications of cirrhosis before he could be transplanted. The remaining 2 patients became HBV DNA negative, 20 and 33 days after famciclovir and underwent liver transplantation. At 3 months posttransplant, seroconversion to HBsAb and loss of HBsAg was observed in both patients; HBV DNA was undetectable. At 6 months posttransplant followup, HBV DNA remained undetectable. No adverse effects could be attributed to famciclovir These data support future trials with famciclovir for HBV DNA positive patients with endstsge liver disease due to Hepatitis B virus, for whom currently there are no effective treatment options available 389 Safety and Immunogenicity of a Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Adult Volunteers. ID. HOGERMAN*, 1A. KIMURA, IF. MALINOSKI, and 2j. TREANOR. ILederle-Praxis Biologicals, W. Henrietta, NY. 2University of Rochester, Rochester, NY. A glycoconjugate vaccine composed of saccharides of S. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 5, 6B, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, coupled to CRM197 and adsorbed to aluminum phosphate (PnC), was tested as a single injection in adults. These serotypes are most frequently associated with pneumococcal disease in children and infants in developing countries. This blinded Phase 1 study was primarily designed to evaluate safety before studies in younger age groups, with immunogenicity as a secondary endpoint. The total immunizing dose was 5Lg of saccharide per serotype and 50lgg CRM197. Unconjugated 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide formulated at 25gg of saccharide per serotype (PPS) was the control. Thirty subjects were equally randomized into the two groups. Redness and pain at the injection site occurred with equal frequency in both groups, while induration occurred in more PnC recipients. Although transient, pain was more severe in the PPS group. Rates of systemic events were equivalent. Both vaccines induced specific responses to the PnC vaccine serotypes. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) one month post immunization were statistically equivalent (by t-test) between the two groups except for type 23F, which was significantly higher in the PnC group. Thus, the 5Bg dose level of PnC was able to induce comparable or better responses than 25ug of PPS.

J.E. GROOVER,* D.M. MUSHER, E.A. GRAVISS, RE. BAUGHN. Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston TX. Field trials have shown that the degree of protection against S. pneumoniae (Spn) infection by pneumococcal vaccine (PV) diminishes with aging. One proposed explanation has been that IgG response to PV is lower in elderly persons. We studied 110 healthy adults, age 20-93yr (mean 50yr); 29 were &gt;70yr and 6 were in their 90's. Al subjects received PV; 4-6 weeks later serum was obtained. Antibody to cell wall polysaccharide was removed, and an ELISA was used to measure IgG reactive with PPS from 10 serotypes that commonly cause Spn infection in adults. By regression analysis, 5 of 10 serotypes showed a slight increase in IgG with aging and 5 showed a slight decrease. The differences were significant (p&lt;0.05) for PPS 18C (increased with aging) and PPS 14 (decreased with aging). Representative data for PPS 3 are shown in the figure. 20- S 20- ' ; . 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 o80 90o 100 Age These results show that the antibody response to PPS vaccination does not diminish with age and that diminished antibody response does not explain the lessened efficacy of PV in elderly subjects. The response in those &gt; 70yr was identical to or greater than the overall response rate further supporting the suggestion that factors, other than age, are responsible for the difference in protection against Spn infection after PV. 391 INFLUENZA VACCINE TRIALS: TIMING OF MAXIMUM ANTIBODY RESPONSE. P.A. GROSS*, R.A. LEVANDOWSKI, S. DRAN, G. MUNK, M. TEPLITZKY. Hackensack Med Ctr, Hackensack, NJ: NJ Med Sch, Newark, NJ: Ctrs for Evaluation of Biol &amp; Research, FDA, USPH, Bethesda, MD. Plans for the next influenza pandemic are in preparation. Immune response to the new vaccine will have to be determined on a rapid basis. We have been conducing studies on the optimal time to draw the post vaccination blood specimen to determine adequacy of immune response. Our previous study showed that the immune response at four and eight weeks post-immunization are identical in young adults and elderly who were previously vaccinated. We now examine whether the immune response in two weeks is comparable to that observed at four weeks in 79 healthy elderly adults for the split virus 1994-5 vaccine. Our findings were as follows: Geometric Mean Titer Percent with HAI of 2 40 2 weeks 4 weeks 2 weeks 4 weeks Vaccine Before After After Before After After Strain Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine A/Texas 47 82 83 58 89 86 A/Shangdg 14 30 31 24 53 54 B/Panama 33 57 55 55 83 82 Our results indicate that the immune response in two weeks is identical with that at four weeks. Future vaccine trials may be able to be done with the post- vaccination blood being drawn as early as two weeks after vaccination. While the immune response for a new strain that represents a shift may require two doses of vaccine, examining the response at two weeks post-vaccination weeks may expedite the process of vaccine assessment. This should be examined when the occasion arises. In summary, in the maximum immune response to influenza vaccine can be determined the period two to eight weeks following immunization. Whether the maximum response is seen earlier than two weeks requires further investigation. 392 Serum Antibody Titers to Influenza Vaccine (FLUV) in Peripheral Stem Cell (PSCT) and Autologous Bone Marrow (ABMT) Transplant Recipients. S.J. SPERBER*, P.A. GROSS, S. DRAN, G. MUNK, M. TEPLITZKY, P. CATARUOZOLO, J. BONELLI, J. BROCHSTEIN, and A.L. PECORA. Hackensack Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ and UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. Immunization recommendations for PSCT and ABMT recipients are based on limited data. We sought to evaluate the serologic response to FLUV and its relationship to time from PSCT and ABMT. Thirty-six patients (ages 13-62) who had undergone PSCT, ABMT, or both for a variety of malignancies (lymphomas, solid tumors, and leukemias) and were in clinical remission received the commercially available trivalent FLUV during 1992-3, 1993-4, and/or 1994-5. Nineteen patients were immunized between I and 12 mo (Group S IYR) and 17 at &gt; 1 yr (Group &gt;IYR) post-transplant. Serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody titers were measured pre and at 4 and 6-8 weeks post-vaccination. Subjects who were vaccinated in the study in successive years were included in Group &gt;IYR . % Vaccinees with HI Titer 2 40 Time A(HINI) B A(H3N2) Since Group n Transpl pec 6-8wk Pre 6-8wk ore 6-8wk &lt;IYR 19 6mo 5 11 11 58 16 47 &gt;1YR 17 23mo 18 35 18 82 18 53 Total 36 14mo 11 22 14 69 17 50 FLUV was well tolerated. Serologic response to at least one FLUV antigen was observed in most recipients. More vaccinees had protective titers to B(p&lt;0.001) and to A(H3N2) (p=0.03) than to A(HINI). Responses were not significantly different at 4 wk compared with 6-8 wk. Responses tended to improve with time after transplant but the sample size precluded sufficient power for statistical significance. Even among a subset of 5 recipients vaccinated 2 mo transplant, 60% had protective titers for B and 40% for A(H3N2) at 6-8 wk. These data suggest that PSCT and ABMT recipients are able to mount adequate responses to some FLUV antigens soon after transplantation. 393 Quantitative and Functional Antibody Responses in Children Given a Tetravalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine.

The vaccine was composed of pneumococcal type polysaccharides 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F conjugated to group B meningococcal outer membrane protein complex adsorbed with aluminum hydroxide. Serum was obtained before vaccination, two months after the first dose, and one month after the second dose of vaccine. Antibody responses were measured by ELISA in pg IgG/ml (by MRL) and by an opsonophagocidal test by % killing of the inoculum. In the latter assay an inoculum of 103 viable pneumococci (10 ul) was pre- opsonized with serum (40 pl) diluted 1/10-1/250; baby rabbit complement (10 1l) and 106 human neutrophils (40 1l) were added, incubated at 37?C for 60 minutes, and sampled for surviving colony counts. After two vaccine doses, 10 children responded to all four antigens, and all 20 children responded to two or more of the polysaccharides. Sera with &gt;2 pg/ml IgG by ELISA consistently (94%) had opsonizing activity. The number of children with positive responses were: After first dose After second dose Type ELISA Opsono- ELISA Opsono- &gt;21g/ml phagocidal &gt;2pg/ml phagocidal 6B 9 6 12 12 14 17 20 19 20 19F 17 17 19 19 23F 6 6 16 17 Responses to type 6B were the lowest of the four types tested. This was consistent with our earlier studies of a monvalent type 6B vaccine, which suggested that three doses might be required for optimal responses in children and young infants. Over 80% had responses to type 23F. Only one child failed to respond to type 19F, and essentially all had good responses to type 14. These data support the concept of polyvalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for use in children. 394 Susceptibility to Vaccine Preventable Diseases in a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinic Population. MA STAAT, YL TANG, A FRESIA, N HALSEY, J KACERGIS, J ZENILMAN*. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore City Health Department, Baltimore, MD. Objective: To determine susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases in STD clinic patients. Do STD clients represent a missed immunization opportunity? Methods: History of disease or immunization to measles, rubella and hepatitis B in Baltimore STD clinic attendees was assessed by interview. IgG immunity to measles and rubella and hepatitis B core was determined by ELISA. Results: We evaluated 288 patients. The mean age was 28; 70.5% were male; 21.5% were born before 1957. Fifty eight reported a history of measles, nearly all of whom were above the median age; 284 (99%) reported immunizations as children. Of these 126 (44%) received them at physicians' office, 108(38%) at public clinics, and the remainder could not recall. Only 21% of those immunized recalled post-childhood boosters. Serologically, 47/288 (16.7%) were susceptible to rubella and 265/288 (7%) to measles. Susceptibility was not associated with sex, age, history of measles, rubella or pregnancy, or source of regular health care. Of the 58 patients with a history of measles 8 (14%) were still susceptible, which was similar to those without a history of measles. Only 23(8%) reported hepatitis B immunization; of these 16/23(70%) were immunized in the military Conclusions: Measles protection is high in this predominantly poor inner-city population. This may reflect successful immunization campaigns, the impact of the 1990-91 measles epidemic, or both. The specificity of measles history is poor compared to objective serological results and should not be used to guide public health interventions. Hepatitis B immunization is severely underutilized. Nearly 1 in 6 is susceptible to rubella placing this sexually active population at high risk for both rubella and its adverse fetal outcomes. Baltimore STD clinic patients, especially non-contracepting women, may benefit from an enhanced rubella prevention strategy. 395 Protective Immunity To Shiga-Like Toxin-I Following Oral Administration Of Shiga-Lke Toxin-I B Subunit Producing V. cholerae CVD103HgR (pDA60). ACHESON DWK, LEVINE MM, KAPER JB, KEUSCH GT. New England Medical Center, Boston, MA and Center for Vaccine Development, Baltimore, MD. Shiga-like toxin (SLT) producing E. coli are a major cause of morbidity throughout the world and are now the commonest cause of acute renal failure in children in the United States. SLTs are considered to be the major virulence factor responsible for both the local (hemorrhagic colitis) and systemic (hemolytic uremic syndrome) complications related to infection with SLT-producing E. coli. We have previously cloned and hyperexpressed the SLT-I B subunit and shown that parenteral administration of SLT-IB in rabbits results in the development of neutralizing antibodies to SLT- I. In the present study we inserted a previously constructed plasmid (pDA60) in which sitlB is cloned into pKK223-3 under the control of a tac promoter, into V. cholerae CVD103HgR (a ctxA deletion vaccine strain). Two sets of three rabbits were then given either CVD103HgR or CVD103HgR (pDA60) orally on two occasions two weeks apart. All three rabbits immunized with CVD103HgR (pDA60) developed antibodies which recognized SLT-I B subunit in an ELISA and were capable of neutralizing SLT-I in a cytotoxicity assay. None of the animals immunized with CVD103HgR developed such antibodies: The animals immunized with CVD103HgR (pDA60) also had a diminished enterotoxic response to SLT-I in ileal loops compared with control animals. These data demonstrate that it is possible to induce a significant antibody response to SLT-I following oral immunization with an SLT-I B subunit expressing V. cholerae vaccine vector, associated with toxin neutralization in the intestinal lumen as well. These results encourage the further development of SLT-B subunit based vaccines to prevent the local and/or systemic disease associated with toxin producing organisms.</page><page sequence="68">786 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 396 Immunogenicity of a I Mcg Liquid Formulation of PedvaxHIB?. D.J. KENNEDY*, E. L. ANDERSON, St. Louis University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO. We questioned whether a reduced 1 mcg dosage of PRP-OMPC prepared as a liquid product (licensed PedvaxHIB? is a 15 mcg lyophilized vaccine) given at 2, 4, 6 and 14 months of age would be as safe and immunogenic as HibTITER? which contains 10 mcg ofPRP-CRM197 (HbOC). To date, there have been no vaccine attributable serious adverse experiences in 75 infants enrolled. The immunogenicity data follow: % Anti-PRP Antibody (mcg/ml) Age Post Vaccine (Mo) Dose N &gt;0.15 &gt;1.0 GMT PRP-OMPC 4 1 32 75 41 0.66 6 2 30 83 73 3.24 7 3 24 92 71 5.56 HbOC 4 1 15 13 0 0.08 6 2 13 62 8 0.16 7 3 11 100 82 3.48 As with higher doses of PedvaxHIB?, the 1 mcg dose of PRP- OMPC showed a first dose immune response. Compared to HibTITER?, PedvaxHIB? was more immunogenic after the first and second doses. After three doses the % response and GMTs were similar. In contrast to prior studies with higher doses of PedvaxHIB?, a higher post dose 3 vs 2 GMT was observed in this study; an increase of 1.7 fold. The antibody levels achieved support that a 3 dose primary series of 1 mcg PedvaxHIB? is immunogenic. The liquid formulation and 1 mcg dose would allow for other alum adsorbed proteins to be incorporated into future combination vaccines.

J.P. ISER', B.P. STONER2', J.J. BUNTAIN-RICKLEFS2, E.R. ALEXANDER3, K.K. HOLMES2. 'Hepatitis Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, San Francisco, CA, 2University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, Seattle, WA. Objective: Adolescent vaccination against hepatitis B is an important adjunct to universal infant immunization programs in the strategy to decrease the incidence of acute hepatitis B, the prevalence of carriers, and the transmission of hepatitis B through traditional risk factors (perinatal, sexual, and sharing of needles). Because of access barriers to this population, and particularly because of logistic difficulties in school- based populations, we implemented a 0,2,4-month vaccination schedule in sixth- through ninth-graders (ages 11-14) of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds attending Seattle public schools. While this schedule is accepted as an alternative to the routine 0,1,6-month schedule, there have been no studies documenting the effectiveness of this schedule in adolescents. Methods: All students (and their parents) who received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax/Merck) at the 0,2,4-month schedule were invited to participate in the serosurvey. Students were offered McDonald's certificates and bus fare as incentives to participate. We collected samples at approximately 2 months post-third dose. Samples were sent to the laboratory at Hepatitis Branch, CDC, for processing. Results: Blood samples were collected from 99 (26%) of 387 eligible sixth- through ninth-graders. A larger number would have participated had samples been collected over several additional days. Of these 99 students, 3 (3%) were surface antigen positive; 17 (17%) were core antibody positive (surface antigen positive rate among those with evidence of previous infection 18%). Of the remaining 82 students, 3 (4%) developed titers &lt;10 MIU and were offered additional HBV vaccine. 79 (96%) of 82 students susceptible to hepatitis B developed protective antibody titers (&gt;10 MIU). The average geometric mean titer for the 79 students who seroconverted was 711.23. Conclusions: The use of the alternative 0,2,4-month immunization schedule for adolescents is quite effective in achieving protective antibody titers. With increasing difficulty in reaching this age cohort and older teenagers, due to increased autonomy, school absences, and an increasing drop-out rate, we report the success of a modified immunization schedule which could permit school-based or other public health programs to fully immunize a larger number of adolescents at risk. 399 Clinical Evaluation of a Meningococcal Group C Oligosaccharide-CRM 197 Conjugate (MnC-CRM) Vaccine in Adults. A. KIMURA,I* D. GINSBERG,2 D. HOGERMAN,1 J. NONENMACHER,1 R. EBY,1 and F. MALINOSKI. 1 Lederle-Praxis Biologicals, W. Henrietta, NY1 and Concorde Clinical Research, Philadelphia, PA.2 We applied glycoprotein conjugate technology to group C meningococcal polysaccharide to enhance its immunogenicity in infants and young children. MnC-CRM vaccine was prepared by directly coupling oligosaccharides of group C to the carrier protein CRM197 by reductive amination. The final formulation contained 10pg of saccharide, 10(gg of CRM197 protein and 0.5mg of aluminum phosphate per dose. In the present study, this conjugate vaccine was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults. Thirty subjects 18 to 60 years of age were enrolled and randomized equally to receive a single injection of either MnC-CRM or licensed meningococcal polysaccharide (MnPs) vaccine at the recommended dose. Reactogenicity of the vaccines was evaluated for three days postimmunization. Serum samples were obtained before and one month after vaccination. Measurement of IgG to group C polysaccharide was performed by ELISA using Lot CDC1992 as the reference serum. MnC-CRM, as well as MnPs vaccine, were well tolerated with no serious adverse reactions reported. Minor systemic reactions were comparable between the vaccines, while local reactions were fewer with MnC-CRM. Both vaccines were very immunogenic in adults inducing substantial rises in IgG antibodies to group C polysaccharide (MnC-CRM GMTs: pre-2.10tg/ml, post-139.98gg/ml; MnPs GMTs: pre-2.93[tg/ml, post-39.32tg/ml). These results demonstrate that MnC- CRM conjugate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in adults, and support further studies in infants and young children. 400 Compliance with Adult Immunization: A Survey of Hospitalized Patients. I. TAK,* E. CHAPNICK, and L. LUTWICK. Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Vaccination (V) is considered to be a very cost-effective public health intervention. It is made more effective by mandating children to be vaccinated before school admission. V in adults, however, is associated with much lower compliance. Tetanus/diphtheria toxoid (TD) V is recommended at 10 year intervals following a childhood primary series and polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPP) V and yearly influenza V are given to those with chronic diseases or who are &gt;60 years old. A series of 300 hospitalized adult patients was assessed for current V status. Regarding TD V, only 65 (-22%) had an up- to-date V history, 130 (-43%) last had V &gt;10 years ago and 93 (-31%) could not recall when the last TD was given. More importantly, significant numbers with higher risk factors for tetanus such as skin breakdown (8% of the not up to date group) and surgery (21% of the not up to date group) were recognized. 35% of peripartum women did not have an up to date TD V history. Of those with medical indications for PPP V, 33.3% were known to have received the V and 67.7% had not. Of those who had indications for influenza V, only 55% had received it. In this population, the compliance of V varied from 22% to 55%. Since out-patient medical care is not effectively delivering these vaccines, patients should have their V up-dated during hospitalization. 401 Seroconversion of Poor Responders to Intramuscular (IM) Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Vaccination Using the Intradermal (ID) Route: A 2 Year Followup. L. LUTWICK*, E. CHAPNICK, A. AST, E. ABTER, and 0. SCHAENING. Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY. With the increased use of the HBV vaccine following new OSHA blood borne virus regulations, as many as 10%-15% of health care workers (HCWs) have been been found to be poor responders (anti-HBs (AB) negative after 6 months). We have reported the utility of vaccine given ID (up to 5 doses) in these HCWs and now present 2 year followup and compare the observed response to identified risk factors. 20 of 23 poor responder HCWs entered had 1 or more risk factors (RF) for nonresponse (&gt; 40 years of age, overweight, smoker). An every other week ID protocol (0.125 mL, 5 Mg) was used for 5 doses or AB developed. ELISA anti-HBs was quantitated using an Abbott 125 mIU/mL standa. d. 20/23 (87%) HCWs developed AB after an average of 2.1 inoculations (3/3 with 0 RF, 10/12 1 RF, 4/5 2 RF, 3/3 3 RF). There was no correlation between # RF and # inoculations needed for an AB response or with peak AB. At latest followup (av = 24.1 mo), 17/20 responders were available and 12/17 (71%) remained AB (+). Serorevertors (SRs) had lower peak AB than those still (+). There was no relationship between SRs and individual or combined risk factors or between either # RF or SR with the half-life of AB decay.</page><page sequence="69">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 787 402 Influenza Vaccination Behavior among Floridians. R. GANGULY'"2*, A. VINCENT', J. SINNOTT'2 and S. HOECHERL3. University of South Florida', James A. Haley VA Hospital2, Tampa, and Family Health Services, HRS3, Tallahassee, Fl. Floridians were surveyed regarding influenza vaccine acceptance, health care status and other related demographic variables based upon the Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Through a random digital dialing method, 3079 residents &gt; 18 years of age were interviewed. Data were weighted to age, sex, and race specific population of the state and for the individual respondent's probability of selection. Overall, 19.7% of the survey population had received influenza vaccine within the last 12 months, 45.2% among those over 64 years of age. Vaccine acceptance increased steadily from 50 through 74 year-olds. Only 22.8% smokers were immunized among the aged (55-85 year-olds). Vaccine acceptance was positively related to retirement, health care coverage, regular medical check-ups and a regular place to go for annual health check-ups, general health status and chronic health conditions. Logistic regression analysis of influenza vaccine use produced a model which eliminated health coverage, self reported health status and smoking, but retained a regular place for health care, routine check-ups and age as independent variables. Improved vaccine coverage of the high risk group will require intervention through outreach programs for the minorities, the working poor, smokers and those without health care coverage. 403 A Phase I Study of a Multivalent HIV-1 Peptide Vaccine in HIV-1 Uninfected Subjects.

Univ of Rochester, Rochester, NY', Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD2, United Biomedical, Inc. (UBI), Hauppauge, NY3, Duke Univ, Durham, NC4, and the EMMES Corp. Potomac, MD5. HIV genetic variation is a major obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection. In response, UBI has produced a synthetic peptide vaccine consisting of the primary neutralizing domain (PND) of gp120 from 15 worldwide isolates including all five major clades of HIV-1. Previously, a UBI monovalent strain MN PND vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic in phase I trials. The multivalent vaccine was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in HIV-1 uninfected volunteers. Twenty four volunteers received 300pg or 1200pg doses of vaccine in alum intramuscularly (12 in each group) and 4 received placebo (alum alone) at months 0, 1, 6 and 8-10. Clinical and laboratory safety parameters are monitored; immunologic studies include binding antibody by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), neutralizing antibody (Nt) to HIV-1 MN in MT-2 cells, lymphoproliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. Immunizations were well-tolerated, except for one 1200pg recipient who developed a diffuse urticarial rash 1 hour after the 4th immunization. This volunteer responded to symptomatic treatment and there is no evidence of significant clinical or laboratory reactions in this and the remaining subjects. Preliminary antibody responses post-3rd and 4th immunization (# positive/# tested) were as follows: EIA (PND of strain MN and Clade A - E) Neutralization MN A B C D E MT2-MN Post 3rd 15/28 0/13 12/13 0/13 3/13 8/13 5/15 Post 4th 14/21 2/11 11/11 2/11 7/11 11/11 4/6 After the 4th immunization, antibody binding to the PND of each clade was detected in a variable proportion of sera. Full analysis of humoral responses including dose response, and cellular immune responses will be presented. 404 A Randomized Comparative Trial of High Dose Intradermal (ID) Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine or Intramuscular (IM) Boosters in Health Care Workers (HCWS) Who Failed to Respond to Standard Intramuscular Vaccination. R.E. LEVITZ,* B.W. COOPER, H.C. REGAN. Hartford Hospital, Hartford CT and University of Connecticut, School of Medicine, Farmington, CT. Despite widespread use of hepatitis B vaccine, approximately 15% of HCWS fail to develop protective antibody titers after the recommended 3 dose IM series. We have previously shown in an open trial that ID boosting often successfully immunizes HCWS who failed to develop adequate antibody response. Non-responding HCWS meeting entry criteria were randomized to receive either ID or IM vaccine boosters. ID subjects received 2 doses of 5ug. (0.25ml.) of Engerix-B ID 1 month apart. IM subjects received 2 doses of 20ug. (lml.) of Engerix-B by deltoid injection 1 month apart. All subjects were tested for antibody to HBsAg 1 month after the second booster dose. Results: 11/15 (73.3%) of ID subjects responded with protective levels of antibody (95% C.I. 47.4 - 90.8 %) 15/19 (78.9 %) of IM subjects responded with protective levels of antibody (95% C.I. 56.6 - 92.9%). There was no statistically significant difference in response rates between these groups. Subjects Intradermal Intramuscular P Value N = 15 N = 19 Females 73.3% 73.6% 0.81 Smokers 6.6% 10.5% 0.81 Mean Age (yrs) 44.6 44.7 0.98 Mean Weight/Height 2.97 2.89 0.72 % Responders 73.3% 78.9% 0.85 Conclusions: Both IM and ID boosting of HCWS who failed to respond to HBV vaccine are similarly successful. ID boosting is less costly and may be preferable. 405 An Anti-idiotype Serves as an Excellent Carrier Protein to Make a Conjugate Vaccine with the Polysaccharide (PS) it Mimics. E. REED and J.R. SCHREIBER'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. We have previously shown that a monoclonal anti-id (C9F5) mimics Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) mucoid exopolysaccharide (MEP) and induces complement-fixing and opsonic antibodies in mice (J Inf Dis 1991; 164: 507). MEP is a poor immunogen in children and adults and conjugate vaccines are being developed for active and passive immunization to prevent PA colonization or infection in CF patients. We hypothesize that an anti-id linked to the PS it mimics would yield a superior conjugate vaccine. Purified MEP (G. Pier, Boston) was linked to either anti-id or human grade tetanus toxoid (TT- Mass Public Hlth Biol Labs) via adipic acid and carbodiimide. Resulting conjugates were purified by molecular sizing, and 50 ug was then administered to 8-week-old Balb/c mice ip. Controls received MEP conjugated to a deletion mutant of PA exotoxin A (EPA-Univax Biologics), unconjugated MEP, anti-id or saline. Mice were bled weekly and MEP antibody titer determined by ELISA. Mice receiving MEP conjugated to anti-id had higher titers of MEP antibodies than mice immunized with MEP, MEP-TT, MEP-EPA or anti-id. We conclude that anti-id may be useful as carrier proteins for PS-protein conjugate vaccines. Further studies are in progress comparing the titer and function of antibodies induced by the MEP-anti-id vaccine to those made with other conjugates. 1.0 --- C9F5 0.8c --/-- MEP-EPA ---.

K.M.NEUZIL*, B.S.GRAHAM, J.P.PRIEELS, M.SLAOUI. Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN and SmithKlein Beecham Biologicals, Belgium. The development of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subunit vaccines has been hindered by poor immunogenicity and the legacy of enhanced RSV-illness after killed vaccine administration in the 1960's. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS-21 may have properties to overcome these obstacles by selective influences on the immune response to RSV antigens. In the BALB/c mouse model of RSV infection, live virus intranasally (LVIN) induces a Type 1 cytokine response with minimal illness at day 4 after challenge, while killed virus intramuscularly (KVIM) induces a dominant Type 2 pattern. Using this model, we immunized mice at time 0 with a single dose of FG (fusion product of RSV glycoproteins F and G) and combinations of MPL, QS-21 and alum, then challenged with live RSV intranasally 30 days later. As compared to primary infection, only mice receiving LVIN or vaccines containing MPL had significant reductions in clinical illness and weight change after viral challenge. Viral pfu in lung were significantly reduced at day 4 in all groups. Both MPL and MPL/QS- 21 combinations increased total antibody response as determined by ELISA as compared to KVIM, FG/alum and primary infections controls, with a shift to more IgG2a subtype. Neutralizing antibody was present after 30 days in the LVIN and QS-21 groups. Northern blot analysis of lungs from day 4 after challenge revealed a Type 1 lymphocyte response in LVIN, primary infection, and QS-21 vaccine products. In summary, after one dose, the adjuvants MPL and MPL/QS-21 increase antibody response to FG subunit immunization in RSV-infected mice, and MPL reduces clinical illness. QS-21 induces a dominant Type 1 response as evidenced by mRNA levels and antibody isotype response, but had no significant effect on clinical illness. 407 How Long A Needle For Intramuscular Immunization in Adults? A BORRUD, GA POLAND*, RM JACOBSON, PC WOLLAN. Mayo Vaccine Research Group, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. BACKGROUND: A 5/8 inch (16 mm) needle is commonly used for adult deltoid vaccination (vax). The ACIP recommends a 1 inch (25 mm) needle for adult IM vax. We sought to determine the distribution ofdeltoid pre-muscular fat pad thickness in a group of health care workers (HCW), and to determine whether one could predict deltoid fat pad thickness (DFPT) with simple anthropomorphic measurements; and thereby select an appropriate needle length using these simple measurements. METHODS: 220 consecutive HCW's presenting for HB vax were enrolled into the study. All subjects underwent high-frequency, real-time ultrasounds of the non- dominant deltoid area, at the injection site marked prior to vax. Age, height, weight, gender, mid-deltoid arm circumference, arm skin-fold thickness, and body mass index (BMI) were collected. We assumed that optimally the needle should penetrate the muscle by 2 5mm. RESULTS: 94 men and 126 women between the ages of 18-59 were studied (mean=35 years). Ranges and means are presented below: Wt (range) BMI (range) DFPT (range) Male 81.0 kg (59-118) 25.8 (17-39) 8.34 mm* (4-21) Female 68.0 kg (48-108) 25.7 (17-50) 11.68 mm* (4-36) *p=0.0000001(2 sample t-test) A 16 mm needle is too short for 18.1% of men and 61.1% of women. A 25 mm needle is too short for 2.1% of men, and 6.3% of women. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated in a correlation analysis. For men, the correlation between mean DFPT and weight was highly significant (p=0.0001, r=0.51), as was the correlation between BMI and mean DFPT (p=0.0001, r=0.59) and deltoid skin-fold thickness and mean DFPT (p=0.0001, r=0.64). For women, the correlation between mean DFPT and weight was highly significant (p=0.0001, r=0.61), as it was for mean DFPT and BMI (p=0.0001, r=0.73), and deltoid skin-fold thickness and mean DFPT (p=0.0001, r=0.69). Females had a greater variability of DFPT at a given level of weight, BMI, or skin-fold thickness. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found that: ) weight, BMI, and deltoid skin-fold thickness are all significant predictors of DFPT, 2) by predicting DFPT, an appropriate needle length can be chosen for deltoid IM vaccination: for men, use of a 1- 1/2 inch needle was appropriate through the range of weights we studied, and for women &lt;70 kg a 1 inch needle, and women &gt; 70 kg a 11/2 inch needle should be used. For women &gt; 100 kg a 2 inch needle should be considered.</page><page sequence="70">788 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 408 Antibody Levels by Immunoglobulin Class in Children Aged 6-60 Months Immunized with Neisseria meningitidis Group C Polysaccharide. E.L. MILLS,'' F.F. ARHIN, F. MOREAU,' B. TAPIERO,2 J.W. COULTON,' D.L. MOORE1. McGill University' and University of Montreal2, Montreal, Qc. The immune response of children to quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine containing A,C,Y and W-35 polysaccharide(PS) was prospectively studied. We previously reported that there was a correlation between levels of antibody(AB) to group C PS measured by ELISA and bactericidal activity in children 24-60 months of age but not in younger children. To determine whether this difference could be explained by different immunoglobulin classes, 229 sera taken 5 weeks post immunization were tested for specific IgG, IgM and IgA AB by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies. AB levels in all three immunoglobulin classes correlated with age. There was a correlation between ELISA AB and bactericidal activity for all immunoglobulin classes with the exception of IgM in the children &lt; 24 months of age. The IgM levels were not high enough to explain the previously observed discrepancy between ELISA and bactericidal titers. There was no evidence for IgA blocking AB. Lack of bactericidal activity could not be explained by differences in immunoglobulin classes.

E.B. WALTER*, C.L. BLAND, S.S. SIMMONS, D.A. CLEMENTS. Duke University, Durham, NC. This study was designed to compare the immune response to the administration of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (VAQTATM) (Merck) given concurrently with immune globulin (IG) (Armour) versus the immune responses following vaccine or immune globulin alone. 50 healthy adults, 18 to 39 years of age, were randomized to one of three groups and vaccinated as follows: Group A received IG (0.06mL/kg) alone on Day 0, Group B received vaccine (58 units) alone at 0 and 6 months, and Group C received vaccine and IG concurrently on Day 0 followed by vaccine at Month 6. Anti-HAV antibody was measured by modified HAVAB and modified HAVAB-M assays. Results of the HAVAB assay are presented below for weeks 0 through 12. Geometric Mean Titers (milli-international units/mL) / #Anti-HAV+ Group N Pre Week4 k 8 Week 12 A 5 2.978/0 26.299/5 22.363/5 3.155/0 B 22 2.735/0 32.084/19 59.762/22 130.991/21 C 23 2.500/0 37.000/23 41.962/22 77.675/21 Groups B and C did not differ significantly with respect to antibody measurable by modified HAVAB. However a smaller proportion of individuals in group C responded at week 4 with a detectable IgM antibody response. These data support the concurrent use of IG and hepatitis A vaccine for outbreak situations and for individuals traveling to endemic areas on short notice. A combination approach provides both rapid and long term immunity. 410 A National Survey of Invasive Pneumococcal Infections in Children, 1991-1994. D. SCHEIFELE*, R. GOLD, J. TALBOT and Members of the IMPACT Surveillance Network, Canadian Pediatric Society, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The 10 children's hospitals participating in the IMPACT active surveillance network account for 80% of Canada's tertiary care pediatric beds and over 91,000 admissions annually. In 1993 the group undertook to identify all cases of invasive pneumococcal infection seen between January 1991 and March 1995. Monitors reviewed hospital discharges and laboratory records to identify cases. Both inpatients and outpatients were included. Eligible cases had S pneumoniae in blood, CSF or other normally sterile body fluid. Case details were summarized on specific report forms which were collated at a data center. Stored bacterial isolates were sent to a national reference lab for serotyping. This interim report includes 959 cases. Annual case totals were constant from 1991-4, ranging between 225 and 264. Only 70% of cases were treated in hospital. Most cases (64%) occurred prior to age 2, the peak prevalence occurring at 12 - 17 months (22% of cases). Males predominated 60:40. Isolated bacteremia was present in 41%, meningitis in 15%, shock in 2%. Mortality rate was 1.5%. Predisposing factors were recognized in 14%. Hospitals categorized 26 of 802 isolates tested (3.2%) as oxacillin resistant, with no temporal trend in resistance rates. Penicillin MIC was measured for 345 screened isolates: 15 (1.9% of tested isolates) were 0.1 to 1.0ug/ml and 4 were 2.0ug/ml (0.5%). No higher MIC's were found. Serotyping is complete for 440 isolates: most frequent serotypes were 14 (26%), 6B (14%), 18C (13%), 19F (11%), 4 (9%), 23F (5%) and 7F (3%). 5- or 7-valent conjugate vaccines could target 72.5% or 80% of isolates seen in children. 411 Low-dose Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines as a Booster Dose. JP BRYAN*, P MACARTHY, A RUDOCK, JP FOGARTY, H DOWD, LJ LEGTERS, PL PERINE. Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD; Walter Reed Army Inst. of Research, Washington, DC. The timing and best regimen for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine have not been determined. We conducted two trials to determine the effect of a booster dose. In the first, we followed a cohort of 77 medical students previously immunized with three doses of either 10 c.g of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine administered IM, 2 lg of plasma-derived vaccine administered ID, or 1 .lg of recombinant vaccine administered ID. At 38 months after the first dose, a 5-pLg dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was administered to 71 of these volunteers. The geometric mean concentration of anti-HBs increased from 86 to 5535 in those previously immunized with 10-Rcg doses of recombinant vaccine, from 38 to 2053 in those immunized with 2-1og doses of plasma-derived vaccine, and from 19 to 702 mlU/ml in those originally immunized with 1-.Lg doses. In a second study, we offered a 5-pg dose of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, either Recombivax HB or Engerix B to students who had previously been immunized with three doses of vaccine. After a 5-pg dose of Recombivax, the geometric mean concentration increased from 45 to 990 mlU/ml (n = 48), and in the group that received a 5-og dose of Engerix B, the concentration increased from 104 to 2337 mlU/ml (n = 46) (p = .18). A 5-pg dose of recombinant vaccine results in an excellent booster response at a cost one-fourth to one-half that of a full 1-ml dose of vaccine. 412 A Comparison of 13 Acellular Pertussis Vaccines (DTaP) with Whole Cell DPT (DTwP) as a Booster in 15- to 20-Month-Old Children. M.E. PICHICHERO*, M.A. DELORIA, E.L ANDERSON, M.B. RENNELS, KM. EDWARDS, JA. ENGLUND, M.D. DECKER, M.C. STEINHOFF; A. DEFOREST. Univ. of Rochester, Rochester, NY; NIAID, Bethesda, MD; St. Louis Univ., St. Louis, MO; Univ. of Maryland, Baltimore, MD; Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN; Baylor College, Houston, TX; Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN; Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD; Temple Univ., Philadelphia, PA. Healthy toddlerswere enrolledthrough 6 U.S. NIH Vaccine Evaluation Units to receive 1 of the 14 study DTP vaccines (vax) as boosters. Children who had received 3 primary doses of a DTaP at 2, 4, and 6 mo of age received the same DTaP as a booster; those who received 3 doses of DTwP were randomized to receive 1 of 13 DTaP vaxs or a 4th DTwP. Fever, irritability, injection site redness, swelling, and pain were assessed post-vax. Pre and post-vax sera were analyzed by ELISA for antibody (Ab) to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbriae (FIM), pertactin (PRN), diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids; pertussis toxin neutralization (CHO) and agglutinating (AGG) Abs were also assayed. 1340 children contributed reaction data. All the common DTP reactions increased with this 4th booster vax compared to the reactions with the primary series. DTaP vaxs produced a lower frequency of irritability, injection site redness, swelling and pain, but not fever than DTwP. Variation in the occurrence of reactions among DTaP vax was observed. Priming with DTaP or DTwP did not influence the rate of reactions to DTaP boosting. 1300 paired sera were available. Increases in Abs directed against the included antigens (Ags) were observed for all vaxs; post-booster vax Ab titers differed among the DTaP and DTwP vaxs. For children primed and boosted with the same DTaP, Ab levels correlated poorly with the quantity of Ag included for PT, T and D; for FHA, PRN and FIM there was a closer correlation. In general, unexpectedly, children primed with DTwP and boosted with a DTaP vax made higher Ab responses to PT, indicating enhanced priming with DTwP. Also, all multicomponent DTaP vaxs produced considerably more AGG Ab when compared to primary post-vaxs but only 4 contained FIM. These results establish a foundation for comparing DTaP and DTwP vaxs for the 4th booster dose. The surprising immunogenicity findings encourage a similar study of the 5th DTaP dose, which is now ongoing. 413 Immunogenicity of Recombinant Hepatitis E Virus Vaccines in Mice. RC LABARRE*, JK HE, W-M CHING, PO YARBOUGH and M CARL. The Naval Medical Center, San Diego, The Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda Maryland and Genelabs Technologies Inc, Redwood City CA. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis in developing countries. A Swiss mouse model was used to determine the immunogenticity of two structural proteins, ORF2 and ORF3, expressed in recombinant baculovirus or vaccinia (WR strain) virus vectors. The mice received escalating doses of the vaccine candidates by the intraperitoneal route. Serum was obtained pre-immunization and at 1,2, and 4 weeks post-immunization, and was assessed for reactivity to the 62K ORF2 or to the 6-1-4 ORF3 proteins by ELISA. Purified, baculovirus-derived ORF2 was immunogenic when administered in a single dose of 2.5 ug, producing titers of 1:500 at 2 weeks and 1:2500 at 4 weeks post- immunization. Co-administration with vitamin D or DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) adjuvants had little effect at this vaccine dose but produced elevated titers of 1:500 at 4 weeks when co-administered with a single dose of purified ORF2 of 0.60 ug. Doses of purified ORF2 at or below 0.125 ug (in the absence of adjuvants) yielded no detectable antibody response. The recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HEV ORF2 produced titers of 1:500 at 2 weeks and 1:2500 at 4 weeks post-immunization at a dose of 105 plaque-forming units (pfu) and showed a dose response with escalating doses of inoculum to 108 pfu. The recombinant ORF3 live vaccinia vaccine produced titers no greater than 1:100 at any dose tested. Serum obtained from mice immunized with wild type WR virus showed no reactivity to the HEV antigens tested. We conclude that ORF2 protein, alone or expressed in a live viral vector, is immunogenic, and deserves further study to determine safety and efficacy in primate models. The ORF 3 candidate was not highly immunogenic in this study.</page><page sequence="71">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 789 414 rderutilization of Hepatitis B (HB) Vaccintion (Vx) by Young Gay Males at Risk. KH MAYER, GR SEAGE, S BOZEMAN, R GDIDSTEIN, P BARRI, S HOILBER, et al. Femay Ommanity Health Center, Dept. of Health and Hospitals, Boston, MA; Brown Uiversity AIDS Program, Providenre, RI; CDC, Atlanta, GA. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalenoe of HB and utilization of HBVx yamng young h sexual males. METHODS: HB markers and Vx utilization data were obtained frcm 361 men recruited in Boston bars, on college campuses and at a ocmunity health center. RESULTS: Over 3/4 of the cohort had no prior HB serologic markers and had not gotten HBVx; over 3/4 of the men who had at least one HB marker had no prior knowledge of HB infection; only 12.2% of the men had been vaccinated. Men who had been previously vaccinated were more likely to have engaged in uraotected anal intercourse, have STDs, but were less likely to use marijuana and have problems with alcohol; they were more likely to think that HBVx was effective and not too expensive. The 47.6% of the men who had not heard of HEVx were more likely to be non-white, less educated, and poorer than those who had. hen free HBVx was offered to the susoptibles, only 62% accepted. Men who did not choose HBVx were more likely to be younger and poorer, but as likely to have unsafe sex and use drugs as those who received HBVx. Amog those who refused Vx were men who perceived themselves to be at no risk for HB, but continued to have unsafe sex. COtXJ: ONS: HBVx is underutilized amog many youner gay men, despite ongoing sexual risk-taking behavior. Decreased use is associated with cost, educational, and behavioral issues, and misperception of personal risk, suggestig the need for targeted public health efforts. 415 Antibody Responses Following Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (PBSCT). C.Y. CHAN *, D.C. MOLRINE, J.H. ANTIN, C. WHEELER, E.C. GUINAN, H.J. WEINSTEIN, N.R. PHILLIPS, and D.M. AMBROSINO. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Peripheral blood stem cells are widely used in autologous transplantation because of rapid hematopoietic reconstitution, ease of collection, and availability to patients whose marrows are unsuitable for transplantation. PBSC contains progenitor cells as well as mature B and T cells. Accelerated granulocyte and platelet recovery following PBSCT are well documented, but little is known about functional immune reconstitution. We therefore immunized 17 autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and 10 PBSCT (4 PBSC only, 6 PBSC and marrow) recipients at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post transplant with HIB-conjugate (HbOC) and Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccines. Total anti-HIB antibody concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and TT IgG antibody concentrations by ELISA and the two groups were compared. Total anti-HIB Geometric Mean Antibody (ug/ml) Months post transplantation roup n 3mo too 12mo ost6mo 212o post 24mo Immunized PBSCT 10 0.65 0.70 1.15 5.69 8.30 74.0 Immunized BMT 17 0.44 0.40 0.27 1.30 0.22 1.14 p-value NS NS NS NS 0.01 0.02 Tetanus Toxoid IgG Geometric Mean Antibody (ug/ml) Months post transplantation Group n 3mo 6mo 12mo post 12mo gs24mo post24m Immunized PBSCT 10 49.57 20.37 104.5 337.3 182.4 417.8 Immunized BMT 17 33.54 20.83 35.23 141.3 21.59 51.15 p-value NS NS 0.139 NS 0.039 0.104 In summary, PBSCT recipients had higher antigen-specific antibody concentrations following immunizations and reached protective levels of total anti-HIB antibody earlier than autologous BMT recipients. This suggests enhanced recovery of humoral immunity in PBSCT recipients and earlier protection against encapsulated organisms with immunization. 416 Evaluation of a Recombinant Hemagglutinin (rHA0) as an Influenza Vaccine in Young and Elderly Adults. JJ. TREANOR, R.F. BETTS*, G.E. SMITH, B.E. WILKINSON, C.S. HACKETT, E. L ANDERSON, R.B. BELSHE, and D.C. POWERS. University of Rochester, Rochester NY; MicroGenSys, Meriden, CT; and St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO. Methods: The hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza A/Beijing/92 (H3N2) virus was expressed in insect cells by a recombinant baculovirus and the rHAO evaluated as an influenza vaccine. Healthy young adults (YA, n = 113) less than 40 years of age and elderly adults (EA, n = 111) over the age of 65 were randomized to receive either subvirion trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), placebo, or the rHAO vaccine at 15 gg, 45 gg, or 135 .lg per 0.5 ml dose, and sera obtained before and 3 weeks after vaccination. Results: All vaccines were well tolerated, but rates of minor pain or tenderness at the injection site were significantly lower in those receiving the rHAO vaccines at all doses (18/133) compared to those receiving TIV (25/47, P&lt;.01). Both YA and EA manifested serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI), virus neutralizing, and HA-specific IgG ELISA (HA-IgG) antibody responses to rHAO vaccine. The rHAO vaccine at the 135 Ig dose was significantly more immunogenic than was TIV in YA (mean reciprocal log2 post HA-IgG titer: 15.6 vs. 13.9, P&lt;.01; HI: 12.3 vs. 10.0, P&lt;.01). EA also had increased antibody responses to the 135 gg dose of rHAO vaccine compared to TIV, but the differences were not statistically significant (mean reciprocal log2 post HA-IgG titer: 14.6 vs. 13.8, P=.06; HI: 9.3 vs. 8.3,P=.16). Conclusions: The rHAO vaccine was well-tolerated at a dose of 135 lug and effectively induced both functional and binding serum HA- specific antibody in young and elderly adults. 417 Comparison of Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (PS) and CRM9l-Conjugated Pneumococcal Polysaccharide (CRM-PS) Vaccines in Young and Older Adults. M.A. SHELLY*, B. GRAVES, G.J. RILEY, AND J. J. TREANOR. University of Rochester, Rochester, New York. Methods: In order to evaluate the potential of CRM-PS to improve immunogenicity in the elderly, 49 older adults (OA) between 60 and 78 (mean 66) and 50 young adults (YA) between 18 and 45 (mean 29) years of age were randomly assigned to receive 23-valent PS (25 plg PS/serotype) or 5-valent CRM-PS (10 pg PS/serotype) vaccine, in double-blind fashion. Recipients of CRM-PS were revaccinated with PS at two months, while those who received PS initially were revaccinated with placebo. All subjects were followed for 1 week after each vaccination for adverse effects, and sera were obtained before and 1 month after each vaccination. Serum IgG antibodies to types 6B and 14 were measured by ELISA. Results: PS and CRM-PS were well tolerated in both OA and YA, although rates of minor local pain were higher in those who received CRM-PS (YA: 56% vs. 24%, P=.02; OA: 28% vs. 4%, P=.03). Revaccination of CRM-PS recipients with PS was also associated with increased rates of local pain compared to initial PS vaccination. In YA, CRM-PS was significantly more immunogenic than PS for type 6B (median 3.7-fold antibody rise vs. 2.7, P= .02) but not for type 14. In OA, responses to type 6B were similar following CRM-PS and PS, but responses to type 14 were less frequent following CRM-PS (32% vs. 67% P=.02). Antibody responses to revaccination with PS were minimal. Conclusions: Both vaccines were well tolerated, but the formulation of CRM-PS used in this study does not appear to offer an advantage for pneumococcal serotypes 6B and 14 in older adults. 418 A Placbo-Controlled Trial of Vaccination with a Mixed Glycoprotein Herpes Simplex Virus Type I Vaccine for the Modulation of Recurrent Genital Herpes. C.A. BENSON*, M.E. TURYK, G.D. WILBANKS, B. FRANK, P. HESELTINE, J. GALPIN, R. KAUFMAN, L. GOLDBERG, C.E. HARTLEY, A. BUCHAN, and G.R.B. SKINNER. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL; University of Southern California Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA; Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX; University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial of a mixed glycoprotein herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 vaccine (AcNFUI[(S-)MRC]) at three academic medical centers in the United States. Subjects who had documented genital herpes of at least one year duration and a history of three or more genital HSV recurrences in the six months prior to study entry were randomized to receive vaccine or placebo at baseline, one and two months. The frequency and characteristics of recurrences of genital herpes were assessed at one, three, and six months following the third vaccine dose. Vaccine recipients experienced a significant reduction in the mean number of lesions per recurrence (p = 0.04) and in the mean number of associated systemic or local symptoms per recurrence (p = 0.02) compared with placebo recipients. The proportion of vaccine recipients (42/148; 28.3%) for whom the time to first genital recurrence was greater than 60 days post-vaccination was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than of placebo recipients (23/144; 16.1%). There was a reduction overall in the frequency of genital herpes recurrences following vaccine administration; this did not reach statistical significance. However, vaccinated women had a significant reduction in the frequency of recurrences compared with women placebo recipients at three and six months post-vaccination (p = 0.002 and p = 0.03, respectively). Increases in neutralizing antibody, ELISA antibody, and lymphoblast transformation in response to vaccine antigen were demonstrated for vaccine recipients with a statistically significant correlation noted between cell- mediated immune response and modulation of disease pattern. These results suggest that clinical manifestations of latent HSV genital infection can be modified by therapeutic immunization with a mixed glycoprotein HSV-I vaccine. 419 Humoral Response to Pneumococcal Vaccine in HIV-Infcted Women With and Without Pneumococal Disease in Kenya. E.N. JANOFF*, J.B. RUBINS, J. OJOO, J. O'BRIEN, C.F. GILKS. VAMC, Univ Minn, Minneapolis, MN; KEMRI, Nairobi, Kenya; Liverpool Sch Trop Med Hyg, Liverpool, England. Pneumococcal disease is among the most common and serious com- plications of HIV infection in East Africa (incidence 4% per yer, mor- tality 10-17%), but is also one of the few potentially vaccine- preventable infections. The efficacy of the 23-valent vaccine is predicaed on the concepts that low levels of pneumococcal capsule-specific IgG predis- pose to infection and that the vaccine elicits significant increases in these antibodies in this compromised group. Among commrcial sex workers, baseline levels of specific IgG were lower for 2 of 4 serotypes (t) among 33 HIV-infected controls [HIV+ Cont] and 21 HIV+ women who had recovered from invasive pneumococcal disease [HIV+ Pneu] compared with those in 15 HIV-seronegative women [HIV-].

Although some levels at one month were decreased in HIV+ compared with HIV-, specific IgG was simiar both prior to and following immunization for each serotype in HIV+ Cont and HIV+ Pneu despite significant differences in CD4+ T cell counts in these HIV+ groups (330+37 vs. 189?37 ccllsL; P&lt;.05). We conclude that HIV infection in Kenyan women is associated with decreased levels of natural antibody to selected capsular serotypes, that HIV+ women respond to the vaccine, but that the development of invasive pneumooccal disease prior to immunization does not predict a selective inability to respond the these capsular polysaccharides that is independent of HIV infection.</page><page sequence="72">790 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 420 Evaluation of Adverse Reactions Associated to Antimeningoco- ccal BC Vaccination in 16.700 Children. R. DEBBAG*, R. RUTTIMANN, D. STAMBOULIAN. Fundaci6n Centro de Estudios Infectol6gicos (FUNCEI). Buenos Aires, Argentina. The incidence ofmeningococcal infections in Argentina has increased in the last two years, particularly those caused by serogroup b. Since April 1994, we count with the antimeningococcal BC vaccine produced in Cuba (VA Mengoc BC) . The vaccine is administered in two doses, 6-8 weeks apart. Here we report the adverse reactions associ- ated to this vaccine. From April to October 1994, we vaccinated 16,700 children at our Institution. Infor- mation was obtained by trained personnel applying a questionnaire to the children's par- ents and/or by telephone. 92% of all vaccinees were &gt; 4 years. The most commonly reported local reaction was pain on the injection site, observed in 62% of vaccinees within the first day postvaccina- tion (mean duration 3.3 days). 48.5% reported only pain and 13.5% pain plus another local effect, tumefaction being the most frequent. General reactions occured in 4.3% of the subjects. Fever &gt; 38.9?C was reported in 0.4%, &gt; 40.5?C in 9 children (6/10,000), and &gt; 39?C associated to vomiting, headaches and chills in 7 cases (1.1/10,000), 2 of them presented within 12 hs postvaccination. Every 10 children, 6 had resolution of fever within 24 hs, but fever persisted for more than 3 days in 19.8%. Other general reactions were petechial syndrome in 1 child, exanthema in 3 (2/10,000), and diarrhea in 6 (4/ 10,000). Only 1 case of hypotony-hyporesponsiveness was reported 24 hs postvaccina- tion. 8 vaccinees had a vasovagal reaction immediately postvaccination. Within the 16,700 immunized children, we studied a subgroup of 4,900 (29%) who received both doses in our center. 49% presented pain with both doses; 14% only with the first and 9% only with the second dose. Anaphylactic reactions, convulsions or encephalopathies were not observed. In conclusion, adverse effects were mainly local reactions limited to the injection site. General reactions were uncommon and mild. Hypotony-hyporesponsiveness was rare and it should be differenciated from the vasovagal reflex reactions which are observed soon after vaccination. The association of high fever, vomiting, headaches and chills was rare, but, when present, it had a rapid resolution without sequellae. In summary, the antimeningococcal BC vaccine demonstrated to be safe in this population. 421 Serologic Response to Cholera in Recipients of Live Attenuated &amp; Inactivated Cholera Vaccines &amp; Placebo, Compared With Natural Infection. J.R. HIBBS*, A.L. FLEMING, D.N. TAYLOR, J.R. KENNER, J.L. SANCHEZ, E.N. JANOFF. VAMC, U. Minn., Minneapolis MN; USAMRID, Lima Peru; WRAIR, Wash. DC. We examined whether mucosal vaccines augment systemic response to wild-type cholera infection (wild VC). We assayed serologic responses the day of and 28 days after wild VC infection among 14 recipients of an inactivated whole cell cholera vaccine with recombinant cholera toxin (CT) B subunit (WCrBS), 5 recipients of a live attenuated cholera vaccine strain expressing CT B subunit (Perul5), and 10 placebo recipients, as well as 18 naturally infected Peruvian cholera patients.

Anti-CT IgG, IgA and IgM and neutralization titers were higher in WCrBS compared with PerulS recipients prior to infection (p&lt;.05). Despite marked increases in CT titers following wild-type infection, Perul5 recipients still had lower CT titers than naturally infected patients (p&lt;.05). In summary, WCrBS recipients had high LPS and CT titers which failed to rise after wild VC infection; Perul5 recipients had high unchanging LPS titers and CT titers which rose after wild VC infection, and placebo recipients had low LPS and CT titers, both rising after infection. 422 Immunogenicity and Safety of a Type III Group B Streptococcus - Tetanus Toxoid (m-TT) Conjugate Vaccine in Women. DL Kasper, LC Paoletti, HJ Jennings, MR Wessels, H-K Guttormsen, and CJ Baker. Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Vaccination of women of child-bearing age remains the most promising and potentially cost-effective method of decreasing the incidence of neonatal GBS infections. To enhance the immunogenicity of type HI GBS polysaccharide vaccine, the native type m GBS polysaccharide was chemically modified to create aldehyde groups as sites for covalent coupling to tetanus toxoid by reductive amination. GC/MS analysis verified that following controlled periodate oxidation, aldehydes were formed on 26% of the side chain sialic acid residues of the polysaccharide. Thirty-five healthy nonpregnant women (25 Caucasian, 6 Hispanic, 4 African American) were randomized into 3 groups; 15 received III-TT conjugate vaccine IM (58 rg type m polysaccharide/ 45 lg TT), 15 received a 50-1lg dose of uncoupled type mI polysaccharide IM, and 5 received saline. At the injection site, pain was reported at similar low rates in all 3 groups. Only 27% of conjugate vaccine recipients had redness or swelling at the injection site, which resolved in 72 hours. One III-TT vaccinee reported a temperature elevation tol00.3' F, which resolved in 24 hours. Both the III-TT and the m polysaccharide vaccine recipients had increased type m polysaccharide-specific serum IgG compared with prevaccination levels, as measured by ELISA. However, only 8 (53%) of 15 recipients of the type III polysaccharide compared with all recipients of the ml-TT vaccine had &gt;4-fold increase in IgG concentration measured 8 and 26 weeks after vaccination (p = 0.006, Fisher's exact test). In the III-TT recipients, a &gt;4-fold increase in antibody levels persisted for at least 1 year. Twenty serum samples obtained 4 weeks after vaccination were compared with prevaccination samples for in vitro functional activity in an opsonophagocytic assay. Sera from placebo recipients mediated a &lt; 0.5 log reduction in GBS cfu. Postvaccination sera from vaccinees receiving uncoupled m polysaccharide mediated a 0.91 log reduction in cfu, while a 1.29 log reduction in cfu of type III GBS was seen in the postvaccination sera of Ill-TT vaccinees. GBS m-TT and type Um polysaccharide vaccines appear to be well tolerated. The III-Tf vaccine has greater immunogenicity than the uncoupled type ff polysaccharide. Antibodies induced in volunteers by the m-T-T vaccine were functional as determined by their effectiveness in killing GBS in vitro. 423 TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST (TST) IN A BCG- VACCINATED POPULATION. B. Rime-Dubey*, C. Poloni, F. Zysset, O. Spinnler, P. Francioli To evaluate the impact of childhood BCG-vaccination on tuberculosis detection by TST, we prospectively followed 2159 health care workers (HCW) newly engaged at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, between Jan. 1991 and Sept. 1993. Switzerland has a low tuberculosis endemicity and, until recently, a tradition of childhood BCG-vaccination. HCW were given 2 TU of intradermal purified protein derivative. Skin induration was measured 48 h and 72 h later and interpreted as positive (&gt;10 mm), doubtful (1-10 mm) or negative (no induration). In doubtful or negative reactions, a booster of 2 TU was administered 7 days after the first TST. Overall, the initial TSTs were positive in 34.6%, doubtful in 13.3% and negative in 52.1% of the cases. Precise information on BCG-vaccination was available in 1919 (80%) of HCW. The majority (1781 or 93%) of them had received BCG whereas only 138 (7%) were unvaccinated. In this subset, 10% of vaccinated HCW with a doubtful TST had a positive booster versus only 0.9% in unvaccinated cases. This difference could not be attributed to increased tuberculosis risk factors (including patient contacts, travel history, age and professional experience) as they were similar in both groups. The results with respect to BCG-vaccination were the following: TST BCG-vaccinated Unvaccinated positive (&gt;10 mm) 36% 10% doubtful (1-1Omm) 14.6% 4.3% negative (&lt;1mm) 48.6% 85.7% Most interestingly, the proportion of BCG-vaccinated cases with negative TSTs did not increase with the time elapsed after BCG administration. It was between 44% and 47% over post-vaccination periods varying from 10 and 30 years. We conclude that BCG-vaccination has a very substantial influence on TST reaction, including the booster reaction, and that this influence may persist over many years after immunization. 424 Reversal of nonresponders by single high-dose intradermal hepatitis B vaccination in 21 Italian health care personnel. G. GHIRGA, P. GHIRGA, M. MARCIANON, G. TURCHETTI, M. COLAIACOMO, M. PIPERE, and M. F. AMIGORENA. Sao Paulo Hospital, Civitavecchia, Italy. Objectives - To evaluate the efficacy of a single high dose intradermal hepatitis B vaccination in healthy nonresponders. Methods - Twenty-one health care personnel nonresponders to 5 i.m. doses of hepatitis B vaccination were intradermally immunized with 20 micro-g of a genetically engineered vaccine. Ten micro-g (0.5 ml) were given slowly in each forearm during the same session. Results - Forty-eight hours after vaccination 19 (90.5%) of the 21 nonresp. developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen. Six weeks after vaccination 19 (90.5%) of the 21 nonresp., all with positive skin reactions, had antihepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 mlU/I. After 12 months, 18 (94.7%) of the 19 responders had anti-HBs Ag antibody greater than 10 mlU/I. After 18 months 13 (68%) had anti-HBs Ag antibody greater than 10 mlU/I. Twenty-four months after vaccination anti-HBs Ag antibody were undetectable in 16 (84.2%) and greater than 10 mlU/I in 3 (15.7%). Skin reactions became negative in those with no protective levels of antibody. Conclusions - Intradermal high dose hepatitis B vaccination is useful to nonresponders to 5 doses of i.m. hepatitis B vaccine. The development of delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions is useful and reliable marker for the acquisition of active cellular immune responsiveness to HBs Ag. Furthermore, when the appropriate vaccine preparations become available, high dose intradermal vaccination strategy may be applicable to other infectious diseases with long incubation periods such as rabies, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. 425 Listeria monocytogenes Infections at the University of Miami (1986-1994). Report of 24 Cases. QJ QAYYUM*, EG SCERPELLA, JN MORENO, MA FISCHL. University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL Listeria monocytogenes infections are described in 24 confirmed cases encountered over a period of 8 years at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. Thirteen (54%) of the 24 patients were adults, and 11 (46%) were neonates: Sepsis (S) Meningis (M) S+M Total Renal transplant 2 0 2 4 AIDS 3 1 0 4 Corticosteroids 1 2 0 3 Pregnancy 1 0 0 1 CHF, ICU 1 0 0 1 Neonates Early-onset 3 2 2 7 Late-onset 0 3 1 4 Only 1 case associated with pregnancy was recorded. Four (17%) of the 24 patients had been diagnosed with AIDS (mean CD4 431mm3; range: 4- 102). The majority of neonatal infections occurred during the early neonatal period (&lt; 1 week of life). Meningitis alone or with a concurrent septicemia was more common in neonates than in adult patients (73% vs 38%). No deaths were observed during the study period (0% mortality), and all patients recovered after treatment with ampicillin alone or in combination with gentamicin. Adult patients were treated for 21 days, while neonates received no more than 14 days of treatment. No relapses were detected on follow-up. A surprising 0% mortality was observed in this series, despite the number of cases with early-onset neonatal listeriosis. AIDS patients constitute a subgroup at risk for developing Listeria monocytogenes infections.</page><page sequence="73">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 791 426 Low Yield of Bacterial Antigen Testing in Pediatric Patients. D.G. RUPAR*, D. ROBERTS, R. WYTTENBACH, and H.J. NORTON. Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC. Bacterial antigen testing (BAT) on normally sterile body fluids can be used to diagnose invasive bacterial infection, but the clinical indications for such testing are not well defined. At our large community teaching hospital, 215 pediatric patients (pts) had BAT by latex agglutination (Directogen, Benton Dickenson) between 10/92 and 7/94. To examine the patterns of use and diagnostic value of BAT in clinical situations, we reviewed medical and microbiology laboratory records of these pts. Records were incomplete for 12 pts, who were excluded from analysis. BAT was done on 236 samples from 203 pts. Average age of our pts was 17.5 months; 46 were &lt; 7 days old. Ten samples from 10 pts were positive. Urine (4/93), cerebrospinal fluid (5/130) and other fluids (1/13) did not differ significantly in frequency of positive tests. The diagnostic yield on CSF samples without pleocytosis was low (1/97). The one positive was on a child with clinical meningococcemia. Yield of BAT on abnormal CSF, including bloody samples and those with pleocytosis, was significantly higher at 4/33 (p=0.004). Invasive infection of blood or CSF was diagnosed by culture only in 17 pts, by BAT and culture in 6 pts, and by BAT alone in 2 pts. Two additional pts who were BAT positive and culture negative were considered false positives. The two pts diagnosed by BAT alone, both on urine specimens, were a neonate with group B streptococcal sepsis and a two-month old with pneumococcal sepsis. Both had received antibiotic therapy before cultures were obtained. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for BAT were 32%, 99%, 80% and 91% respectively. Sensitivity of culture (92%) was much higher than BAT. All patients with true positive BAT were initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. There were no changes in therapy as a consequence of earlier diagnosis of infection by BAT. Total patient charges for BAT were over $16,500. We found BAT to be an expensive test with low diagnostic utility in pediatric patients. It should not be used on otherwise normal CSF, and should be reserved for patients in whom previous antibiotic therapy has made positive cultures unlikely. 427 Community-Acquired Enterococcal Bacteremia in Previously Well Children. D.G. RUPAR* and M.D. ROBINSON. Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC. Enterococcus species are important nosocomial pathogens but have received less attention as a cause of community-acquired bacteremia. To better define the clinical presentation and course of community-acquired enterococcal bacteremia in children, we examined the records of 18 patients without underlying disease or indwelling catheters who presented to the emergency department or clinic at our hospital between 1989-1995 and who were found to have enterococcal bacteremia. Most cases (13/18) were identified during the second half of the study period, 1992-95. Four patients had polymicrobial bacteremia, all with staphylococci. Four patients had another pathogen identified (Salmonella, Chlamydia, rotavirus and adenovirus.) All enterococcal isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. Median age was 20 days (range 3-349d), with 11 (61%) less than one month old, and four (22%) between one and three months old. Fifteen of eighteen had fever, but only four had a temp E 39?C. Signs and symptoms were generally mild and non-specific, and included gastrointestinal problems (12 patients), fussiness/irritability (11 patients), and respiratory symptoms (6 patients). No child had severe sepsis or septic shock. Possible foci of infection were identified in six patients: four with pulmonary infiltrates, one neonate with an abscess at a fetal scalp electrode site, and one with CSF pleocytosis but negative CSF culture. No patient had endocarditis or urinary infection. Nine patients had an abnormal white blood cell count or differential by Rochester criteria. A variety of therapeutic regimens were used, including 7 patients who lacked appropriate antibiotic therapy (ampicillin or vancomycin) for &gt; 72 hours after blood culture. Eleven patients had repeat blood cultures drawn, all of which were negative. All patients recovered without complication. The Enterococcus should be considered as a potential cause of community-acquired bacteremia in young infants. This infection is usually mild and may be self-limiting. 428 Thrombotic Complications in HIV Patients due to Antiphospholipid Antibodies: Experience with Five Patients and a Review of the Literature. J. NEPOMUCENO*, J.P. O'KEEFE, J. LENTINO, D. WASSERMAN, V. YELDANDI. Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL. Antiphospholipid antibodies bind to anionic phospholipids. These antibodies, which include anticardiolipin antibody, can be associated with many complications including recurrent thromboembolic events, repeated fetal loss or thrombocytopenia. Protein S deficiency has been associated with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, possibly contributing to thrombosis in these patients. There is a high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibody and low protein S levels in patients with HIV infection, but the clinical implication of this is uncertain. We describe 5 HIV infected patients who developed thrombosis and on evaluation were found to have anticardiolipin antibody. Four of these patients also had concomitantly low protein S levels. In one patient protein S levels were not obtained prior to warfarin treatment. Four patients had deep venous thrombosis and one patient had a transient ischemic attack of the central nervous system. They had no other risk factors for thrombosis. Two of the patients had progression of thrombosis, and thromboembolic complications despite adequate anticoagulation with warfarin. Given the implications for therapy, the presence of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome should be considered when HIV infected patients present with venous or arterial thrombosis; and unexplained transient ischemic attacks of the central nervous system. Long term treatment with warfarin is essential for prevention of recurrent thromboembolic events. 429 Influence of Concomitant Therapy on the Characteristics of Initial and Recurrent Episodes of Presumptively Diagnosed Toxoplasma Encephalitis (TE). E. FRENCH* and R.S. HOLZMAN.* New York University - Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, NY Many AIDS patients who present with initial attacks of TE are taking medications for prevention of P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) which may have some antitoxoplasma activity. In addition, many patients may suffer relapses while receiving maintenance therapy for toxoplasmosis with which they are less than fully compliant. We reviewed cases of TE occurring at Bellevue Hospital between 1/89 and 9/94, diagnosed presumptively with the aid of computerized tomography or magnetic resonance. Patients were classed by age, sex, race, HIV risk, CD4 + cell count, prior AIDS defining illness, level of consciousness, seizures, number and location of CT/MRI lesions, and outcome. Medications and data documenting adherence to therapy were recorded. 98 of 145 patients were prescribed one or more medications with potential antitoxoplasma activity (OnRx) prior to the time of 53 first episodes and 45 recurrences. First episodes were associated with significantly reduced levels of consciousness compared to recurrences (P &lt; 0.005) and among those OnRx, evidence of adherance was associated with a reduction in number of lesions seen on CT/MRI (P &lt; 0.001). Ist Episodes Recurrences NoRx OnRx P NoRx OnRx P N 53 43 4 45 Median CT/MRI 6+ 2 0.001 6+ 1 0.002 lesions (quartiles) (3, 6+) (1, 2) (5.25, 6+) (1, 3) Level of 1 0 0.08 2 1 0.01 conscious-ness: (0, 2) (0, 2) (0.5, 2) (1, 3) 0=alert; 3=coma (quartiles) Seizures (%) 35% 30% NS 50% 40% NS Use of medications for the prevention of PCP attenuates presenting symptoms and signs of TE, especially the appearance on CT/MRI. We also noted that many patients who had recurrent TE responded to the same medication which they were supposed to have been taking at the time of recurrence. Nonadherance to prescribed maintenance therapy is a significant problem in this group of patients. 430 Fungl Peritonits n AIDS Patients: Case Seri und Literature Re w. C.R. PELLEGRINO", CE. LACKE, S.J. SPINDEL E.A. GRA VISS, nd R.J. HAMILL VA Medil Center nd Baylor Cole of MAedicke, Houston, TX. The increased incidence of fungal disease in HIV-infected patients has been noted, but reports of peritoneal involvement are rare. We saw three AIDS patients presenting with fungal peritonitis at our facility between 1989-1994. CASE #1: 48-year-old male, CD4 = 10//1L, presented with fever, abdominal pain, distention and tenderness. Abdominal CT scan showed ascites. X-rays demonstrated small bowel obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy revealed serous fluid and an inflamed omentum with caseating granulomas. Omental biopsy was positive for Coccidioides immitis. Enterococcus was cultured from peritoneal fluid. Treatment was with intravenous amphotericin B and then oral fluconazole. He expired 12 months later due to end-stage AIDS. CASE #2: 47-year- old male, CD4 - 80/pL, admitted with abdominal tenderness, ascites, hepatomegaly and increased girth. Abdominal CT revealed prominent inguinal and retroperitoneal nodes and ascites. Peritoneal fluid and blood cultures grew Cryptococcus neoformans. The patient expired within 24 hours. CASE #3: 59-year-old male, CD4 - 180/p.L, developed fever to 104 ?F, RUQ tenderness and elevated hepatic enzymes. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated thickened peritoneum, retroperitoneal nodes and ascites. Blood and peritoneal fluid fungal cultures grew Histoplasmn capsul/tum. He deteriorated and expired within 24 hours. Terminal blood and peritoneal cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. We identified 5 previously reported cases of fungal peritonitis (2 with C. neoformans, 2 with C. immitis and 1 with H. capsulatum). Our cases were remarkably similar to the other cases in age, CD4 count, presenting symptoms, physical examination and abdominal CT results. None of the other reported cases documented small bowel obstruction as part of the clinical presentation. Two of our patients had concomittant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In conclusion, although fungal peritonitis is rare in HIV-infected patients, fungi should be considered in the differential of patients presenting with CD4 s 200/pL, nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, ascites or CT evidence of peritoneal involvement. 431 Staphylococcus lugdunensis Native Valve Endocarditis Following Vasectomy? MPA LESSING*, DW CROOK, IC BOWLER &amp; Oxford Heart Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal Native Valve Endocarditis (CNS-NVE) comprises c. 5% of NVE. The CNS-group contains 28 species. Staphylococcus epidermidis is an established cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Recently Staphylococcus lugdunensis has been described to cause destructive NVE. Of 259 clinically significant CNS-isolates referred in 1993 to the Public Health Laboratory Service-Staphylococcus Reference Laboratory, Colindale, London, UK only 6 (2.3%) isolates were identified as S. lugdunensis. We observed 4 consecutive cases of S. lugdunensis NVE over a 48 month period ending November 1994. The diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) satisfied the Duke criteria for definite IE. Pathologic examination of the valve in all 4 subjects demonstrated IE. Three of the cases were male and I female with an age range of 32-45 years. All required urgent valve replacement within 1-8 days (d) of admission. We observed that all the males underwent vasectomy 21-30d earlier as office-day-case-procedures. The female had an inguinal furuncle 30d previously. TABLE.

Were this to be the case S. lugdunen.sis IE would be an unexpected and serious complication of vasectomy and other minor surgical procedures in the inguinal region.</page><page sequence="74">792 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 432 Strongyloides stercoralis Hyperinfection Syndrome (SHS) in AIDS; Diagnosis by Fluorescent Microscopy. J. NOMURA*, K. REKRUT. Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA. SHS occurs infrequently in patients with AIDS. Prompt recognition requires consideration of the diagnosis. However, clinical features are often not helpful since symptoms are nonspecific and mimic those of other more common opportunistic infections. Once SHS is suspected, larvae can usually be readily identified in respiratory secretions on wet mount or Papanicolaou stain. We report a case of SHS in which the diagnosis was made as an incidental finding by fluorescent microscopy. A 35-year old HIV-infected Hispanic male from New Mexico with a CD4 cell count of 46 cells/mm3 was admitted with a four week history of progressive cough and dyspnea. Two weeks prior to admission he was found to have bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. Induced sputum was obtained at that time; stains for mycobacteria and Pneunocystis carinii by direct fluorescence (PCFA) were negative [Genetic Systems Corp., Seattle WA]. Over the week prior to admission, he complained of increased fever and abdominal pain without diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 101'F, a respiratory rate of 24. Rales were heard in both lungs. Laboratory evaluation showed the following values: white blood cell count, 10,600/mm3 (77% pmn, 0% eos), p02, 63 mm Hg, CXR revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Initial treatment consisted of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S) and corticosteroids for possible P. carinii pneumonia. He required mechanical ventilation when his condition deteriorated shortly after admission. Repeat PCFA testing of sputum was agai9 negative for P. carinii but the background stain exhibited numerous larvae. Trichrome stains confirmed the presence of S. stercoralis larvae in both sputa and stool. The patient received thiabendazole for 16 days and gradually improved. T/S and corticosteroids were discontinued. Serial testing of sputa and stool documented clearing of larvae. However, one week after thiabendazole was stopped, fever and abdominal pain recurred and larvae were again identified in clinical specimens. Treatment with ivermectin for two days resulted in eradication of the organisms. The patient was weaned off the ventilator and discharged home on hospital day 42. Three months later, he remains well without evidence of clinical or microbiologic relapse. We were unable to review the initial PCFA after his diagnosis became clear. It is conceivable that larvae were present at that time, perhaps in smaller numbers, and not recognized as potential pathogens. Diagnosis of SHS can be facilitated if laboratory personnel are aware that S. stercoralis larvae may be visible when employing fluorescent microscopy for other respiratory pathogens. 433 The Changing Face of Childhood Pyogenic Arthritis (PA): Implications in Therapy. M.A. JACKSON*, K.B. DESAI, L.C. OLSON, V.F. BURRY. The Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City MO Until recently, Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) has been considered to be the major cause of pediatric invasive disease and the most common etiologic agent of pediatric PA. With the advent of HIB vaccine in 1985 and use of a more effective conjugate since 1988, the prominence of this pathogen has been expected to diminish, thus decreasing the number of pediatric PA cases. We reviewed 138 cases of PA treated at this institution from 1980- 1994 (1980-1985 n=40; 1986-1994 n=98); 98 cases were culture confirmed. While the majority of PA cases continue to involve weight bearing joints in the child &lt; 2 years, infection of elbows, shoulders, metatarsals and multiple joint disease appears to have increased since 1986. Staphylococci and s treptococci now account for approximately 70% of culture confirmed cases with a reduction in the percent of cases due to HIB: [Pre-vaccine: 1980-1985, 13/31 (42%); Post-vaccine: 1986-1988, 4/14 (29%), 1989-1991, 6/28 (21%), and 1992-1994, 0/25 (0%)]. We conclude that the overall incidence of pediatric PA continues to increase despite eradication of HIB disease. Antimicrobial therapy for PA cases should include coverage against S. aureus and streptococci and modification in 1) infants under the age of 12-15 months who have not received the HIB booster vaccine; or, infants under 2 years who have never received HIB conjugate vaccine (add HIB coverage), 2) in the adolescent with multiple joint disease (add gonococcal coverage), or 3) following a penetrating injury. 434 Parvovirus B19 Infection In Cardiac Transplant Patients. MG ISON, SH HOUSTON, S PATTANI, L COBIAN, JT SINNOTT*. The University of South Florida, Tampa, FL. Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) infection in the cardiac transplant patient has not been described. To date, PVB19 infection with persistent anemia has been reported in patients with acute leukemia receiving chemotherapy, after bone marrow transplantation, after renal transplantation, in association with such congenital immunodeficiencies as Nezelof's syndrome, and with AIDS. We describe the first recognized case of aplastic crisis following PVB19 infection in an orthotopic heart transplant recipient. A 53-year old white female was on cyclosporine, prednisone, Imuran, and methotrexate when she presented with fatigue, weakness, myalgia, and pancytopenia. Despite discontinuation of azathioprine and methotrexate, her anemia persisted. She was evaluated for PVB19 using bone marrow biopsy, PCR, and IgG and IgM titers, all of which were positive for the virus. Our patient, like most immunocompromised patients, responded to intravenous immunoglobulin. Transfusions may temporarily alleviate some symptoms. As a result of this case and the other previously reported kidney transplant cases, PVB19 should be considered when a heart transplant patient presents with severe acute or chronic anemia. 435 Osteomyelitis in a Cardiac Transplant Patient: A Rare Complication and a Unique Organism. R.M. PLEMMONS*, C.K. MCALLISTER, and R.L. WARD. Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, TX Mycobacterium haemophilum infection is a rare but well-described complication of solid organ transplation and HIV infection. The majority of reported M. haemophilum infections in transplant patients have been in renal allograft recipients. We describe the first reported case of osteomyelitis due to M. haemophilum in a cardiac transplant patient and only the second reported case of M. haemophilum infection at any site in this patient population. Only one prior case of osteomyelitis due to atypical mycobacteria in a cardiac transplant patient has been previously reported. Our patient presented three months post-transplant with pain and swelling in his right elbow. A bone scan showed markedly increased uptake in the right olecranon, consistent with osteomyelitis. Olecranon biopsy revealed numerous acid-fast bacilli and cultures grew M. haemophilum. Mycobacterial susceptibility testing revealed unequivocal susceptibility to clarithromycin (MIC &lt; 3 mcg/ml) and "partial inhibition" with rifampin and ciprofloxacin. The patient has been treated with clarithromycin and rifampin for 12 months with complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis. This case represents the first reported deep tissue infection with M. haemophilum in a cardiac transplant patient and suggests that clarithromycin is an effective therapeutic agent for such infections. 436 Mycobacterium fortuitum Otitis Media and Mastoiditis: Review of Four Cases and a Cautionary Note. R.M. PLEMMONS* and C.K. MCALLISTER. Brooke Army Medical Center, San Antonio, TX. Mycobacterium fortuitum is a rarely reported cause of otitis media and mastoiditis. We describe such a case seen recently at our institution and review the three prior published reports of this disease entity. All of the cases involved patients with pressure equalization tubes in place who had been previously treated with multiple courses of antibiotics and topical steroids. All developed mastoiditis and had M. fortuitum recovered from cultures of middle ear or mastoid granulation tissue. The only definite cure among the prior three cases had been achieved with a regimen of amikacin and erythromycin. Complicating therapy in our patient was an isolate with high-level resistance to amikacin (a rare finding in M. fortuitum). Although resistance to amikacin has been described in other atypical mycobacterial species causing otic infections, such resistance had not been reported in the three prior isolates of M. fortuitum from otic sources. Since the current medical literature recommends amikacin as first-line therapy for M. fortuitum infections, awareness of the potential for pre-existing amikacin resistance in the setting of otic disease needs to be heightened. Our patient responded well to a nine month course of clarithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We believe that this patient represents the first reported successful use of clarithromycin against M. fortuitum in this setting. 437 Infective Endocarditis IIE) in 1994. A prospective study. A. MENASALVAS, F. VASALLO, P. MUNIOZ, M. MORENO, MA. GARCIA FERNANDEZ and E. BOUZA*. Hospital 'Gregorio Maran6n". Madrid. Spain. The field of IE is rapidly moving, as classification criteria, predisposing conditions, incidence, etiologic agents, diagnostic methods and therapeutical schemes are changing. In order to assess that, we prospectively followed IE cases during 1994 in our institution. We had 50 episodes fullfilling at least Von Reyn's (VR), Steckelberg's (ST) or Durack's criteria (Table 1). Definite Possible Probable Fejad Von Reyn 4% 46% 46% 4% Steckelberg 4% 68% 10% 18% Durack 78% 22% 0% The new Duke's classification allowed to rank as definite 78% of our cases, compared with only 4% in both VR and ST criteria. Incidence of IE was 1.03/1000 admissions and represented 4.2% of our significant bacteremias. Mean age was 49 years and 38 were men. The most frequent underlying condition was HIV infection (38%) linked to IVDA, followed by heart diseases 32% (50% prosthetic valves) and diabetes mellitus (20%). When HIV + (19 cases) and HIV - patients (31) were compared,lower mean age, right side involvement and staphylococcal etiology were significantly more common in HIV + patients, while congestive heart failure and mortality were more common in the HIV - group. Predominant etiologic agents were S. aureus 44%, CNS 10%, Enterococcus 10%, and Candida 6%. Group viridans streptoccoci represent only 10% of our episodes. Affected valve was mitral 32%, tricuspid 28%, aortic 22%, others 4% and unknown 22%. 84% of IE occurred on native valves and the remaining on prosthetic materials. All but one patient had an initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) that showed vegetations in 25 (51 %); 27 patients had transesophagic echocardiography (TEE) that showed vegetations in 23 (85.2%). Of those 24 patients with an initially negative TTE, 17 had a positive TEE. Adequate medical therapy was provided to 80% of the patients and 16% underwent therapeutic surgical maneuvers. Mortality was 30% (11% in HIV +/49% In HIV -). In conclusion, IE remains an entity with high incidence and significant mortality despite new diagnostic approaches and the growing importance of the "low risk group" represented by the HIV + population.</page><page sequence="75">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 793 438 Group B Streptococcus in nonpregnant adults. A cause of bacteremia with high mortality. P. MUkFOZ, A. LLANCAQUEO, L. MARTIN, M. RODRIGUEZ-CREIXEMS, A. MENASALVAS and E. BOUZA*. Hospital Universitario "Gregorio Maraf6n", Madrid, Spain. Gram (+) bacteremias are increasing and have been related to a relatively low mortality risk. Data regarding Group B Streptococcus Bacteremia (GBSB) are scarce. We report the largest series to date, with a special interest in assessing bad prognostic factors. From 1985 to 1994, 88 GBSB were detected. After excluding 21 (23.8%) pregnancy-related and 18 GBSB episodes without enough clinical information, we describe the remaining 49. Incidence has significantly increased (3.7 fold) during the study period (from 0.08/1000 admissions in 1985 to 0.3/1000 in 1994). Mean age was 62 years (21-88) and 55% were men. The most common underlying conditions were: liver diseases (39%), malignancies (30.6%), diabetes mellitus (24.4%), heart disease (21%), renal failure (16%), urinary tract disorders (10%) and none (4%). No HIV (+) patient had GBSB. Infection was nosocomial in 34.7% of the cases. Focal diseases were: UTI (12%), skin and soft-tissue infections (10%), LRT (8%), peritonitis (8%), post-endoscopy bacteremia (8%), catheter-related bacteremia (6%) and endocarditis (2%); 45% of the bacteremias had no identified source. Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 9 cases (18%). A high rate of complications were detected: septic shock (26.5%), DIC (6%), renal failure (6%) and ARDS (4%). Overall mortality was 32.6%. First analysis disclosed the following bad prognostic factors: renal failure, abnormal chest X-ray, altered mental status, alcoholism and shock (p&lt;0.05). With multivariate analysis shock and alcoholism were identified as independent poor prognostic factors. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime and vancomycin. One CIP-R strain was recovered and resistance to erythromycin has increased from 8% in 1992 to 18% in 1994. GBSB is a rising cause of bacteremia in elderly patients with severe underlying conditions. It seems to spare HIV infected patients, has a high morbidity and mortality rates and macrolides should not be used empirically for treatment in Pen-allergic subjects. 439 FUO DUE TO KIKUCHI-FUJIMOTO DISEASE (KFD). AH Norris, AM Krasinskas, KE Salhany, SJ Glitckman, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD) is a form of necrotizing lymphadenitis that has been well recognized and characterized in Japan but has appeared almost exclusively in the pathology literature in the United States and is therefore tnknown to many clinicians. This entity is a benign, self-limited cause of prolonged fever and lymph node enlargement. It has been reported most commonly in young women. In the past it has been confused histologically and clinically with lymphoma. and has lead, on occasion, to the inappropriate administration of chemotherapy. We have recently encountered four cases of KFD, all occurring in young men, three presenting as "fever of unknown origin." We report these patients to highlight the clinical features of this little-known condition and the potential for confusion with lymphoma. Case I was a 22 year old male with eight weeks of moderate cenrical lymph node enlargement and no other symptoms or abnormal laboratory studies. Cases II-IV ranged in age from 45-43 years. Adenopathy was no greater than 2.2 cm in size, cervical in two patients and both axillary and abdominal in one. All three reported three weeks of fever with chills or rigors, marked fatigue and a 7-20 lb weight loss. All three showed elevations in LDH (421-535) and ESR (70-97) and had sterile blood cultures; two of the three were moderately leukopenic. Lymph node examination in all four patients revealed the characteristic features of KFD: patchy necrosis with cosinophilic fibrinoid material, marked karyorrhexis and scattered nuclear debris. Typical clinical features of KFD encountered in these patients include the distribution and size of the adenopathy, the leukopenia, elevation in ESR and LDH and the lack of response to antibiotics. Unusual was the protracted period of systemic complaints and the male predominance. All four recovered without specific therapy over several weeks, as is characteristic of KFD. We suspect this disease may be under-recognized among infectious diseases practitioners. 440 Esophageal Ulcers as Initial Presentation of Disseminated Tuberculosis in HIV-lnfected Patients. O. ORTIZ,* M.J. MASLOW, A.S. RICHMOND, N. BRAU, A. VASQUEZ and M.S. SIMBERKOFF New York University School of Medicine and New York V.A. Medical Center, New York, NY. Introduction: Esophageal ulcers in the HIV-infected patient can present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. In some cases, no etiology can be ascertained and a diagnosis of "idiopathic HIV-related esophageal ulcer" is made. Methods and results: Three HIV-infected patients presented to our medical center with progressive retrosternal pain on swallowing (worse with liquids) associated with weight loss and fever. All three patients had radiographic evidence of an esophageal ulcer and sinus tract formation. Chest x-ray films were initially normal in two patients and showed a pulmonary infiltrate in one. Two patients had a biopsy of the ulcer which showed granuloma formation and acid-fast bacilli. Cultures of the tissue grew M. tuberculosis. Sputum cultures grew M. tuberculosis in all three patients with initial smears positive for acid-fast bacilli in two. A diagnosis of esophageal and pulmonary tuberculosis was made, and all three were treated with anti-tuberculous medications. Treatment resulted in the resolution of symptoms, healing of the ulcers, and eventual closure of the fistulae. Conclusion: In HIV-infected patients who present with an esophageal ulcer, more pain on swallowing liquids than solids, fever, and weight loss, tuberculosis of the esophagus should be strongly considered. 441 History and Physical Examination Accurately Predicts the Etiology of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Hospitalized HIV-Infected Patients. AS PUMERANTZ*, PA SELWYN, JG ELMORE, P ALCABES, K DIECKHAUS, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Rationale: Bacterial pneumonia (BP), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and tuberculosis (TB) are the the most common serious pulmonary infections in HIV-infected patients. Accurate prediction of the clinical likelihood of these syndromes is often important for initiation of proper therapy before definitive diagnoses are made. Objective: To identify clinical characteristics that could predict either BP, PCP, or TB as the etiology of community-acquired pulmonary infection in HIV- infected patients first presenting for hospital admission. Methods: Presenting history and physical exam data were extracted from medical records of HIV-infected patients t 18 yrs. of age admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital between 3/86 and 7/94 who were ultimately diagnosed with either BP, PCP, or TB. Case definitions: BP=infiltrate on admission chest x-ray with either (1) growth of bacterial pathogen on sputum or blood culture, or (2) characteristic sputum gram stain ( 2 + WBC, e 1 + epithelial cells, predominant organism). PCP=demonstration of organism in sputum or lung tissue. TB=growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from respiratory samples. Results: 214 cases met criteria (94 BP, 101 PCP, and 19 TB). Features more common in BP vs. PCP patients (p&lt;0.05): yellow-green sputum,75% vs. 43%; thick sputum, 41% vs. 10%; pleuritic chest pain, 52% vs. 32%; egophony, 15% vs. 5%; dullness to percussion, 12% vs. 3 %; rhonchi, 26% vs. 9%; toxic appearance, 11% vs. 2%. Features more common in PCP vs. BP patients (p&lt; 0.05): cough &gt; 10d, 52% vs. 24%; clear-white sputum, 61% vs. 20%; exertionaldyspnea, 81% vs. 43%; fever&gt; 10d, 41% vs. 16%; night sweats, 46% vs. 23%; weight loss, 41% vs. 23%; dyspneic appearance, 43% vs. 18%; thrush on exam, 54% vs. 29%. Features more common in TB vs. BP patients (p&lt;0.05): cough&gt; 10d, 69% vs. 24%; fever&gt; 10d, 69% vs. 16%; night sweats, 58% vs. 23%; weight loss, 68 % vs. 23 %. Only 11% of TB cases had prior opportunistic infections vs. 50 % BP (p&lt;0.05) and 32% PCP cases (p=0.09). When all data were available, a nonparametric discriminant function using the variables of sex, age, cough&gt; 10d, fever&gt; 10d, dyspnea, night sweats, weight loss, rhonchi, and thrush on exam correctly classified all BP and TB, and 92% of PCP patients. Conclusion: A thorough history and physical examination may be sufficient for accurate prediction of the specific diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected patients at the time of initial hospital presentation. Additive utility of laboratory and radiographic data in predicting the correct diagnosis will be presented. 442 MELIOIDIOSIS WITH PNEUMONIA, EMPYEMA, BACTEREMIA, AND WIDESPREAD METASTATIC ABCESSES IN A VIETNAM VETERAN 29 YEARS AFTER HIS RETURN FROM CU CHI, VIETNAM. Ushasree Chodimella M.D., Joni Stasiak M.D., Kenneth Nazinitsky M.D., Scott Whalen Ph.D., William Hoppes M.D., Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, Canton, Ohio. Melioidosis is a glanders-like infection caused by Pseudomonas pseu - domallei, first described in Burma (1912). This disease can have a protean clinical spectrum and was so named because of a resemblance to "distemper of asses". The organism can be isolated from soil, stagnant water, and rice paddies in Southeast Asia. The disease is endemic in Vietnamese natives (18-38%), and was seen in U.S. Troops in Vietnam. The longest reported record for recurrence of melioidosis was 26 years (Mays et al, 1975). The patient was a 50 year old Army Veteran who was in Cu Chi Base Camp during 1965-66. He was not ill in Vietnam, and enjoyed good health in the intervening 29 years. He had been complaining of low back pain for 6 months, and intermittent fevers and night sweats for 2 months. He presented to his physician with fever, pallor, diaphoresis, fatigue, and right-sided chest pain. Chest films revealed interstitial infiltrates in the right lower lung field which progressed to consolidation and pleural effusions. CT scans of the the chest and abdomen revealed empyema, mediastinal abcesses, calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe, multiple low-density foci in the spleen and a left paraspinous muscle abcess: all cultures grew Pseudomonas pseudomallei. The empyema required decortication. He was treated with ceftazidime and TMP/SMX intravenously for 1 month, then oral TMP/SMX plus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Extensive diagnostic work-up did not reveal any predisposing comorbid conditions. Bone marrow revealed no lymphoma. After 5 months of therapy the patient remains clinically improved. Serial CT scans showed resolution of all lesions except for the spleen where a new larger posterior defect has been reported recently. Therapy and follow up continues. In summary, this is the latest known recrudescence of melioidosis in a patient after return from an endemic area. At the present time it is not known whether he has persistent infection or lymphoma in his spleen. Microbiology and radiological findings as well as clinical course management will be discussed. 443 Absolute Predominance of Mononuclear Cells in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) of Patients with Listeria monocytogenes Meningitis. EG SCERPELLA*, QJ QAYYUM, JN MORENO, MA FISCHL. University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL. Thirteen patients with culture-proven Listeria monocytogenes meningitis were reviewed. Eight of the 13 were neonates (&lt; 28 days of life), and 5 were adults including 2 patients with renal transplant and one each with leukemia, vasculitis, and AIDS. Signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement were present in 4 of the 5 adult cases, and were suspected in 5 of the 8 neonates. Initial CSF white blood cell counts were slightly higher in the neonatal cases (median 1314/mm3; range: 10-5600) than in the adult cases (median 783/mm3: range: 272-2310). CSF glucose levels of less than 30 mg/dl were found in 7 of 9 cases (4/6 neonates and 3/3 adults). CSF protein values greater than 150 mg/dl were also seen in 7 of 9 cases (5/6 neonates, and 2/3 adults). A striking predominance of mononuclear white blood cells (MNs) in the CSF differential count was identified. Ten (77%) of the 13 patients had greater than 80% MNs in the CSF, and all 13 patients had greater than 65% MNs in the differential. No deaths occurred, and all the patients recovered after treatment. A predominance of MNs in the CSF of patients with meningitis may be indicative of infection with Listeria monocytogenes, and justifies the initial use of anti-listerial antibiotics until the results of CSF cultures become available.</page><page sequence="76">794 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 444 Pivotal Role of Small Bowel Biopsy in AIDS: Lessons from Three Patients with Abdominal Pain Seen at a Community Hospital. B.D. FISHER*, J.C. LIN. Muhlenberg Regional Medical Center, Plain- field, N.J. Intra-abdominal diseases are common in patients with AIDS, often exhibiting similar collections of symptoms in spite of a wide variety of distinct and diverse etiologies. Each of three middle-aged Hispanic men presented with fever and ab- dominal pain. Multiple stool examinations failed to reveal an etiology. They were all evaluated similarly, including abdominal computed tomography (CT), which in each instance revealed small bowel thickening and, in two of the pa- tients, focal abnormalities of the liver. Biopsies of the liver of each patient and of terminal ileal ulcers of two of the patients failed to detect the cause in any of the patients. Histologic examination of segments of small bowel resected at lapa- rotomy yielded specific diagnoses for each patient. These diagnoses are given in the Table, together with brief descriptions of the patients. Table Patient National Origin CD4(+) cell Small Bowel count (per IL) Biopsy Result A Guatemala 45 Histoplasma capsulatum B El Salvador 11 Cytomegalo- virus C Peru 77 Lymphoma Patient A was treated with amphotericin B and then itraconazole. Patient B was treated with ganciclovir. Patient C was treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen appropriate to his lymphoma. Each responded with diminution in symptoms and improvement of overall well-being. These patients illustrate the importance of an aggressive approach to abdominal pain in AIDS, including open small bowel biopsy when indicated. 445 Are Very High Levels of Serum LDH an Early Sign of Disseminated Histoplasmosis in AIDS? CORCORAN GR, FLANDERS C, GEIMER J, and PATTERSON TF. Univ. of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a common life-threatening late stage manifestation of AIDS. The definitive diagnosis may be delayed, since it is often made only on bone marrow or blood cultures, however it has been thought that high serum LDH level may be suggestive of this diagnosis, as well as other granulomatous diseases. In order to confirm this, a case control study was done on all of the cases of culture proven disseminated histoplasmosis admitted to our hospital during the years 1993-1994. The control group was a convenience sample of all the patients admitted to the HIV service during December 1994. These patients had a wide range of diagnoses including PCP(8), lymphoma(l), bacterial pneumonia(8), CMV(4) and other (9). There were 15 patients in the study group and 30 in the control group. The mean CD4 count for the two groups was 25 and 66 respectively (p &gt; 0.05). The mean admission LDH in the study group vs. the control group was 1356u/L (range 145-5410) vs. 257 (range 77-614) (p=0.019). In the study group there were 4 patients with an LDH below 600 and one above 600 in the control group. When the two groups were compared using this cut off level (3X upper limit of normal) the odds ratio of having histoplasmosis was 79.75 (lower 95% C.I. 6.01; p=.000014) for a level of &gt;600. The in-house mortality for the study group was 7/15 (45%). The mean LDH for the case patients that died during the hospitalization vs. case patients discharged was 2071 vs. 730 (p&gt;0.15). Patients with late stage HIV disease with an admission LDH of greater than 600 were more likely to have disseminated histoplasmosis than other conditions, and for those with levels above 1000 the mortality was almost 50%. Therefore, in our institution, the admission LDH level may be a useful early marker of disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS. 446 Value of Diagnostic Tests in Men with Urinary Tract Infections. B.A. LPSKY*, A. FREITAS, W. H. BUSH, Jr., J. E. WIPF, S. D. FIHN, J. GILCHRIEST. University of Washington &amp; VA Medical Center, Seattle, WA Urinary tract infections (UTI's) are frequent in older men, but there are few data and little agreement on which diagnostic tests are indicated for this situation. We performed a prospective comprehensive evaluation of various diagnostic tests among unselected noncatheterized men with a UTI. Each underwent a detailed history and physical examination, blood &amp; urine tests, uroflow studies, a renal ultrasound (US) and excretory urogram (EU). The latter two studies were read independently by two radiologic experts blinded to the patient's clinical history and to the results of the other study. The mean age of the 27 men was 66 (range 45-79), 73% were white, 19% had undergone a prostatectomy, 23% had a history of urolithiasis, none had a neurogenic bladder, and 66% were either currently or had recently received antibiotic therapy. The mean number of lifetime UTI's was 3 (range 1-30), with the first infection occurring at a mean age of 56 (range 27-79). None of the men were febrile or had tenderess of the prostate; 50% were circumcised. Standardized symptom scores indicated bladder outlet obstruction in 60% of patients, the maximum uroflow was abnormal (&lt;10 cc/second) in 44%, and 33% had an abnormal (&gt;50 ml) post void residual measured by ultrasound. Pyuria was present in 57% of cases. The most common infecting organisms were E. coli (42%), K. pneumoniae (19%), streptococci (15%), &amp; enterococci (12%). EU could not be done 6 (22%) of the men (serum creatinine 1.6-2.0 in 5, &amp; allergy to dye in 1). The results of the EU &amp; US examinations are shown below. Findings on EU &amp; US were completely concordant in only 12% of cases; US did not identify lower tract abnormalities, while EU missed small mass lesions &amp; calculi. EU US Clinically significant abnormalities 57% 33% Finding(s) falsely identified 20% 6% Finding(s) falsely missed 13% 12% These results indicated that elderly men with UTI's frequently have finding of bladder outlet obstruction, and abnormal uroradiologic studies. US alone is adequate for upper tract evaluation, while EU cannot be performed in many patients and frequently yields false positive findings, but provides useful information about the lower urinary tract. 447 Pneumocysitis carinii Pneumonia in Patients on Dapsone and Rifabutin Prophylaxis. LJ Bessenfand D Mildvan. Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, N.Y. Routine prophylaxis of opportunistic infections has improved the management of HIV infected patients. Dapsone is frequently used as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients intolerant to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. Rifabutin is recommended for patients with CD4 counts &lt;100 to prevent disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Recently, three patients maintained on both dapsone and rifabutin were seen with atypical presentations of PCP. One patient had an isolated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation &gt;900 IU/L for 3 weeks with no symptoms, a negative chest x-ray (CXR) and negative gallium scan 3 days later. Within one week, the patient then developed acute onset of shortness of breath, a repeat CXR revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates and sputum induction was positive for PC. The second patient presented with fever and shortness of breath. A gallium scan was negative on the third day of illness but a CXR 4 days later showed multiple large, thin walled cavities bilaterally. Bronchoscopy and cultures were negative for bacteria, acid fast bacilli, PC, fungus and viral inclusions. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a bacterial process but fever and dyspnea persisted. An open lung biopsy revealed fulminant PCP. The third patient was admitted with fever and diarrhea. An admission CXR showed questionably increased interstitial markings in the right lower lobe. Two days later, however, the patient became dyspneic with an elevated LDH and a repeat CXR revealed diffuse bilateral opacification. Pathology and cytology obtained at bronchoscopy were positive for PC organisms. All three patients were successfully treated with pentamidine and steroids. To explain these findings, a possible interaction between dapsone and rifabutin was considered. Although to date no published studies documenting such an interaction have been identified, rifampin is known to decrease dapsone serum concentration 7-10 fold. Thus rifabutin, another rifamycin derivative and a weak-inducer of liver enzymes, may also lower the serum concentration of dapsone. As our findings suggest, this potential drug interaction may be increasingly relevant clinically as the concurrent use of these agents becomes more widespread. 448 Recurrent Invasive Pneumococcal Infections in Young Children Without Underlying Immunodeficiency. SO ORLICEK, H HERROD, RJ LEGGIADRO, G LUEDTKE and BK ENGLISH. Crippled Children's Foundation Research Center, Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center; Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tennessee, Memphis, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,TN. Recurrent or repeated serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae occur in patients with certain abnormalities of host defense (asplenia, sickle cell disease, agammaglobulinemia, nephrotic syndrome, etc.), but have rarely been reported in patients with normal immunity. We reviewed the medical records of all patients whose blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae between October 6, 1991 and April 30, 1994 at LeBonheur Children's Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee. During this 30 month interval, 394 pneumococcal blood/CSF isolates were identified; 16 of these (4%) were recurrent infections. Six of the recurrent infections occurred in patients known to have sickle cell disease, and one occurred in a patient with known asplenia. Of the remaining 9 patients, one had glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is not known to predispose to pneumococcal infection. An immunological evaluation was performed in 6 of the 9 patients without known host defense abnormalities. Of these patients, each had determinations of quantitative immunoglobulins, CH100, and an imaging study to evaluate the presence of a spleen. Some patients had serology for HIV, agglutinins, specific antibody titers to tetanus toxoid, blood group antigens or selected pneumococcal serotypes, or additional complement studies. No immunodeficiency was identified in any of these patients. Of the 394 patients with invasive pneumococcal infections, 264 (67%) were under 2 years of age, as were all nine of the previously healthy patients with recurrent pneumococcal disease. In our experience, repeated invasive pneumococcal infections in otherwise healthy young children were relatively common (9/394, or 2.3% of all invasive pneumococcal infections during a 2 1/2 year interval), and did not signal the presence of an unsuspected immunodeficiency. 449 Transient Cardiomyopathy Complicating Falciparum Malaria. C.W. Lerner*, A. I. Popp, I.C. Schulman, A. H. Maran. New York Downtown Hospital, NY, NY. Cardiac failure has been rarely described in the setting of treated Plasmodium falciparum infection. We de- scribe a case of transient cardiomyopathy occurring during the recovery phase of falciparum malaria. A 20 year old male student returned from a visit to his native Gambia, during which he took no malarial prophylaxis. One month later, he presented with one day of chills, headache, myalgias and fever to 103.6?. He was toxic appearing, but was alert and had normal cardiac and lung exam. Chest X-ray, hemoglobin, and platelets were normal. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Within 24 hours repeat blood smear showed ring forms (less than 1% para- sitemia) and one RBC with two ring forms consistent with P. falciparum. He was treated with oral quinine sulfate and doxycycline. By the fourthhospital day his malaria smears were negative, but he was thrombocytopenic and he had low grade fever. The fifth day he became acutely dyspneic and hypoxemic and exam and CXR showed pulmonary edema. He responded to diuresis and oxygen in the ICU. On the sixth day he was afebrile and echocardiogram re- vealed a dilated left ventricle with 25-30% left ventri- cular ejection fraction (LVEF). EKG was unchanged, platelets normalized and his exam and CXR improved. A gated blood pool cardiac scan on the ninth day showed a 52% LVEF, and he was discharged the next day. He has re- mained well and an echocardiogram six months later was WNL. Falciparum malaria with a high parasitemia can be complicated by coronary artery thrombi with ischemia, or ARDS. Our patient differed from previous reports in that he had a transient cardiomyopathy during the recovery phase of falciparum malaria, and clinicians should be alerted to this possible complication at any time during the course of seemingly effective antimalarial therapy.</page><page sequence="77">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 795 450 SEVERE TINEA BARBAE (Tb) DUE TO Trichophy- ton verrucosum (Tv) IN DAIRY FARMERS - Julia Sabota, M.D., Robert T. Brodell, M.D., William L. Hoppes, M.D. - North- eastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, Warren and Canton, Ohio. Tb due to Tv is discussed in Dermatology texts, however, many primary care physicians, and even ID clinicians have not seen it. A common source is the hide of dairy cattle. We present 5 patients, 3 of whom had severe pustular Tb and 2 had involvement of the forearms. All 5 were dairy farmers. The 3 with Tb were hospitalized for I.V. anti- Staphylococcal antibiotics by their primary physicians because of the marked purulent appearance of the lesions. They were afebrile, and did not appear ill. WBC's were normal. Each had severe unilateral erythema, scaling, and large draining pustules. Gram stain and bacterial cul- tures were negative. KOH preparations showed hyphae; cultures grew Tv. One received Griseofulvin, and four re- ceived Fluconazole. There were 2 relapses. The cows in the herd had KOH positive lesions. The veterinarian in one case prescribed a single dose of 3 gms. of Griseo- fulvin which was not curative. Fluconazole, 200 mg. per day for 3 weeks was effective. This dose was based on availability of office samples of this expensive drug. (Project approved, but not funded.) It is not known if the cattle relapsed. In summary, Tv caused ringworn in dairy cattle and pustular Tb in farmers clinically so severe that it may be mistaken for Staph aureus infection. A simple question, "Are you a dairy farmer?" suggests the diagnosis in the proper clinical setting. A simple bed- side diagnostic test, the KOH Preparation confirms the diagnosis. Reinfection is common and is due to persistent infection in the cows. Appropriate treatment for the cattle remains to be established. Photographs of the patients and the cows will be shown. 451 Acanthamoeba Sinusitis in a Patient with AIDS. Lynette Cugino, M.D.; Julie Butcher, M.D.; William L. Hoppes, M.D.; Michael Doyle, M.D.; Charles Bogden, M.D. Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, Canton Ohio. Acanthamoeba is a small, free-living ameba known to cause a fatal granulomatous encephalitis. It has been found in immunocompromised patients, but is typically diagnosed at autopsy. This organism has also been known to cause kera- titis, necrotizing pneumonia, skin abscesses and sinusitis. There are two prior case reports involving AIDS patients with Acanthamoeba species confined to the paranasal si- nuses and skin. We present a case of Acanthamoeba si- nusitis and concomitant skin abscesses without initial CNS involvement in an AIDS patient. A 34 year old white male diagnosed with HIV in August, 1988 presented with the complaints of severe frontal and occipital headaches and sinus congestion. The patient had a history of frequent low-grade fever, buccal and palatal lesions and skin nodules. Initial CT scan showed bilateral pansinusitis. Subsequently the patient under- went a bilateral Caldwell-LUC and ethmoidectomy. Biopsy specimens revealed an extensive Acanthamoeba sinusitis with extension into the palate. Although there are no proven therapeutic regimens for this disease, the patient was treated with IV Pentamidine and oral Itra- conazole. These were poorly tolerated and the patient re- fused further therapy, so was sent home with Hospice. Eventually the patient developed erosion through the sinuses, palate, and nasal septum, and bridge of the nose resulting in disfiguring ulcers. He died approximately four months after initial diagnosis, Pathology and photographs will be shown. 452 A Triad of Peripheral Blood Smear (PBS) Findings is Sensitive for a Presumptive Diagnosis of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). K. FOUCAR, A. SCOTT, M. McCABE, T. HENNESEY, D. WAITE, S. JENISON, and F. KOSTER*. Univ. of New Mexico Sch. of Med., Albuquerque, NM, and Gallup and Crownpoint Indian Health Service Hosps, Gallup and Crownpoint, NM. HPS due to the new North American hantaviruses begins as a nonspecific viral prodrome of fever and myalgias, then precipitously progresses to pulmonary edema, with shock and death in 55% of cases. Early clinical clues suggesting hantavirus infection would be useful for presumptive diagnosis and rapid transfer to intensive care. Two skilled hematopathologists blinded to diagnosis examined peripheral blood smears (PBS) to enumerate all nucleated cell types. CBC and PBS findings were compared for 21 cases of HPS, 35 cases of ARDS with sepsis, 17 cases of culture-positive influenza A, and 63 cases of acute viral prodrome with or without pneumonitis. All 21 HPS cases, but only 3 of 115 cases of non-HPS 'controls' (p&lt;0.0001), were characterized by a triad of 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) left shift of the myeloid series (circulating myelocytes and promyelocytes) and 3) immunoblasts (large lymphocytes with deep blue cytoplasm; &gt;10% of circ. lymphocytes). The 3 non-HPS with the triad had bacterial sepsis, plasmacytosis and alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia. Serial CBC and PBS in HPS cases showed that thrombocytopenia (&lt;150,000) was the first abnormality detected. Two mild cases of HPS not in this series did not have thrombocytopenia at the onset of pulmonary symptoms (cough and dyspnea), but did not require intensive care. We conclude that the triad of thrombocytopenia, left shift of the myeloid series, and immunoblasts on peripheral smear is highly sensitive and specific for HPS cases requiring immediate intensive care; diagnosis must be confirmed by hantavirus-specific serology. 453 Community Acquired Pneumonia in North Carolina- A High Incidence of Chlamydia pneumoniae. F.T. MEREDITH', H.A. GALLIS, A.W. MOSHER, and K.E. WELTY-WOLF. Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) is reported to cause 6-10% of community-acquired pneumonia. The epidemiology has yet to be described in the Southeastern United States. During a prospective study of 149 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from 1992- 1994, we found 34 patients with evidence of acute TWAR by microimmunofluorescence (MIF). Mean age was 48 years (range 19- 83). Underlying disease was present in 19 of 34, including COPD in 9 (26%), diabetes in 4 (12%), HIV in 2 (6%), and steroid therapy in 5 (15%). Although fever was present only in a minority (26%), cough was present in 82%, sputum in 44%, and pharyngitis in 56%. Chest radiographs revealed unilateral, predominantly lobar infiltrates in the majority. Persistent infection over 6 months was evident by progressive increase in MIF titer in a single patient with right middle lobe syndrome. Evidence of previous C. pneumoniae infection was detected by serology in an additional 64 patients for a seroprevalence of 66% in our study group. Concurrent infections were detected in 17 patients (50%). These primarily included serologic evidence for acute infection with influenza A and B, as well as mycoplasma. We found a high rate of acute TWAR infection in patients with community- acquired pneumonia (22%) in our study, affecting adult patients of all ages, as well as many with underlying disease. TWAR appears to be endemic in North Carolina, as elsewhere in the United States. The cases were evenly distributed throughout the study period, without clustering that might suggest an epidemic contributed to the high incidence of acute infection. A high rate of concurrent respiratory infection was also found. 454 IFN ca-2b for Treatment of VZV Myelitis in a Patient with AIDS. S. I. Aronin* and M. P. Golden. Yale New Haven Hospital and Hospital of St. Raphael, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Patients with HIV infection may suffer from severe varicella- associated disease. A 35-year-old man with advanced AIDS developed chronic, relapsing VZV infection with myelitis, which responded only to IFN a-2b. He presented initially with dermatomal VZV, which was complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and spasm, despite treatment with high-dose oral acyclovir. Symptoms partially improved with high-dose zidovudine, intravenous acyclovir, and physical therapy. Two months later he developed disseminated VZV, which responded incompletely to iv acyclovir with persistence of several cornified lesions on his hands and face. He sustained another outbreak of dermatomal VZV 2 months later, which was complicated by loss of anal sphincter tone, lower extremity weakness, ataxia, and sensory changes. He was initially treated with high-dose zidovudine and iv acyclovir; IFN c-2b was added on hospital day 2 with dramatic improvement. Acyclovir was ultimately discontinued because of hepatotoxicity, but thrice weekly IFN was continued with total resolution of the cornified skin lesions and full neurologic recovery. Three months later he developed VZV retinitis, and while on foscarnet therapy his IFN was inadvertently discontinued. Lower extremity weakness and sensory deficits recurred. Reinstitution of IFN a-2b on hospital day 6 again resulted in marked improvement. The patient died several weeks later of unrelated complications. This case suggests that immunomodulators such as IFN may play an important role in the treatment of patients with complicated VZV infections. 455 Radiographic Presentations of HIV-Related Tuberculosis Vary by CD4+ Count. D.C. PERLMAN, W. EL-SADR, E. NELSON, J. MATTS, E. TELZAK, N. SALOMON, K. CHIRGWIN, R. HAFNER and Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS and AIDS Clinical Trials Group, NIAID. Objective: Report on the characteristics of baseline chest radiographs (CXRs) as a function of baseline CD4 + counts among patients in a multicenter treatment (Rx) trial of HIV-related tuberculosis (TB). Methods: Eligibility required suspected pulmonary TB and HIV-infection, no more than limited prior TB Rx, and low risk for MDR-TB. Sputum specimens were sent to a reference laboratory for culture and susceptibility. CXRs and baseline CD4+ counts were obtained within the 30 days prior to entry. CXRs were interpreted at participating sites with data abstracted from reports by trial personnel onto standardized data collection instruments. Results: 112/189 patientsenrolled as of 2/1/95 were known to have HIV-infection and positive baseline cultures for MTb, and there are CD4+ and CXR data for 105 of these. The 105 had a median CD4+ = 70/mm3 (range 0-805). 97/105 (92%) had 21 of the following CXR finding: cavity, lymphadenopathy, infiltrate, nodules, effusion, interstitial disease. Those with (+) sputum AFB smears (n=69) were more likely to have abnormal CXRs (97% vs. 82%, p=0.01). Of the 105, 9.5% had cavitary disease and 23% had lymphadenopathy on CXR. When CD4+ counts were dichotomized as &lt; or &gt; 200/mm', results were as follows: N % with cavity % with vlmphadenopathv &lt; 200 79 6.3 29 a 200 26 19.0 3.90 Total 105 p = 0.115 p &lt; 0.001 When CD4+ counts were treated as a continuous variable, those with lower CD4+ counts were significantly less likely to have cavitary disease (p=0.029) and were more likely to have lymphadenopathy (p=0.047). This relationship was also present in those with positive sputum smears. Conclusions: Among persons with HIV-related TB, patterns of chest radiographic involvement vary by CD4+ count. Cavitary disease occurs more frequently among those with higher CD4+ counts. Lymphadenopathy on CXR is more common among those with lower CD4+ counts.</page><page sequence="78">796 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 456 Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cellulitis in a Pediatric Hospital: Clinical Severity and Response to Therapy. J. GOAD, L.A. ROSS, M. ARDITI, KS KIM AND W.H. MASON*. Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA. Clusters of severe Sp infections have been reported recently, primarily in adults. In a retrospective study of patients hospitalized with cellulitis between July 1, 1992 and July 1, 1994 we identified by culture and/or serology 26 children with infections caused by Sp. Ages were from .72 - 12.88 years; 13 were male. Predisposing factors included varicella in 14, insect bites in 5 and trauma in 5 Anatomic locations were extremities in 11, trunk in 9, head in 4. and perianal in 2 On admission 2 were hypotensive, 1 had epiglottitis, 1 had necrotizing fasciitis and 5 patients were bacteremic. Initial therapy consisted of a beta-lactam (BL) in 25 patients. Patients were evaluated for time (in days) to improvement (TTI), time to defervescence (TTD) and average length of hospital stay (ALOS). Prompt response (PR) to BL therapy, defined as TTI &lt; 3 and TTD &lt;2, was seen in 14 patients (TTI 2.5 + .85, TTD 2.1 + 1.9, ALOS 4.9 + 2.7). Prolonged or complicated courses were noted in 11 patients who were switched to clindamycin (C) (9) or vancomycin (2) (TTI 5.4 + 8.2, TTD 4.8 + 2.7, ALOS 18.9 + 36.3). One patient admitted with epiglottitis and cellulitis who was initially treated with C because of BL allergy also had a complicated course. Surgical drainage was required in 50% of the PR patients and 58% of the complicated patients. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was given to 1 PR patient (7%) and 8 (67%) of complicated patients with rapid improvement in all. Sp cellulitis is a serious infection in children which may not respond favorably to BL antibiotics. Further study of IVIG in complicated Sp cellulitis is needed. 457 Paecilomyces Pneumonia in a Diabetic Patient. S. FISCHER*, K. WEINSTEIN, J. C. POTTAGE, JR. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL. A 52 year-old diabetic woman with a three-month history of cough and intermittent hemoptysis was noted to have a left upper lobe mass and a right lower lobe nodule on CXR and CT scan of the chest. She denied fever, weight loss and night sweats. A bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy was performed; rare non-caseating granulomata were seen, but cultures of tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative. An ESR was 73 mm/hr, and ANCA, stool ova and parasite and fungal serologic studies were negative. Left lingular and hilar node resection was performed five months after her initial presentation, due to persistent symptoms and nodules. Necrotizing granulomata were seen in pathologic specimens, with no demonstrable organisms. Repeat ANCA testing and a PPD were negative. Three months later, the patient's dyspnea persisted, and a repeat CXR and CT scan revealed new and evolving nodules with cavitation. A trial of prednisone (40 mg/day) was instituted, with no symptomatic benefit noted. Repeat CXR demonstrated increasing nodule size, and the steroids were discontinued. Review of the cultures from surgery revealed that Paecilomyces had grown in 3 of 3 plates from the hilar lymph node tissue. She was treated with a total of 2.5 grams of amphotericin B (AMB), followed by itraconazole (400mg/day). Steady CXR and CT improvement was noted throughout her course. Paecilomyces is a common laboratory contaminant which has been occasionally reported to cause disease in immunocompromised patients. Sinusitis, endophthalmitis, pyelonephritis, peritonitis and skin and nail infections have been described. Including the present case, four cases of pneumonia (2 in diabetic patients with similar presentations) have been reported. Fever was present in 2/4 cases, and hemoptysis was noted in 1/4. There was no evidence of extrapulmonary disease in any of the patients. P. varioli was isolated in 3 patients. Clinical success was noted with AMB in 3 patients; in the 2 cases in which dosing regimens were documented, - 2.5 grams of AMB were administered. One patient died on day 7 of AMB therapy; no autopsy was performed. Paecilomyces should be considered a potential pathogen when isolated from immunocompromised patients with pneumonia, and may be treated with AMB. 458 Infectious Complications of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) Placement. S. FISCHER*, G.M. TRENHOLME, M.R. COSTANZO, and W. PICCIONE. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL. Eleven prosthetic LVADs were implanted as a bridge to cardiac transplantation at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center between 12/94 and 3/95. Eight male and three female patients had LVADs placed; the mean age was 53.5 yrs. All had NYHA class III- IV heart failure and were inotrope-dependent. Four patients developed five postoperative infections. Pneumonia developed in two patients at 7 and 34 days following implantation; both infections resolved with antibiotic therapy. LVAD-related bacteremia developed in three patients at 15, 16 and 28 days after implantation. In two patients, drive line exit site infection was associated with Staphylococcus aureus bac- teremia. One patient developed fever, pleural and peritoneal bleeding, and prolonged bacteremia with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus without obvious signs of drive line infection. All three patients with bacteremia were treated with antibiotic courses appropriate for pros- thetic valve endocarditis, receiving antibiotics for at least six weeks. One patient developed Candida tropicalis drive line and bloodstream infection three days following the onset of S. aureus bacteremia. Antibiotic therapy was complicated by C. difficile-associated diarrhea in two patients and Torulopsis glabrata UTI in one patient. Cardiac transplantation was delayed in all four infected patients; no deaths occurred. Two of the bacteremic patients subsequently underwent cardiac transplantation with no initial evidence of infection recurrence. Preliminary analysis supports that LVAD infections can be successfully treated without device removal and that cardiac transplantation can be successfully accomplished in individuals with bacteremia from LVADs. 459 Clinical Manifestations, Natural History and Outcome of Fungal Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis (PVE). R. NASSER', G. MELGAR, S. GORDON, D. LONGWORTH. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio. Fungal PVE is a challenging clinical problem in view of the associated risks of therapy and the possibility of relapse. Few studies have examined the long term outcome in such patients (pts). To examine this problem, we retrospectively reviewed 10 pts with surgically proven fungal PVE. The mean duration of follow-up was 6 yrs (86 days-16.4 yrs). Candida albicans was the most common pathogen [5 ptsl, followed by C. Parapsilosis [31, Saccharomyces [1] and Histoplasma [1]. Mean age was 51 yrs (range 31-71). Underlying conditions included diabetes mellitus [3], prior antibiotic therapy and TPN [2] and steroid use [1]. Fungal PVE developed at a mean of 330 days (range 42-1240) after valve replacement. Two pts had received amphotericin B therapy for fungemia 4 months and 2.5 years prior to the development of PVE (1 and 1.5 g of amphotericin, respectively). Valve types involved were bioprosthetic [6], annular rings [3] and mechanical [1]. Fungal PVE involved the aortic [8] and mitral [2] valves. Three pts presented with strokes, 2 with ischemic limbs and 10 with fever. All 10 pts had positive blood cultures. Nine had physical findings suggestive of endocarditis: Janeway lesions [2], Osler nodes [1], peripheral emboli [8], Roth spots [3] and new regurgitant murmurs [2]. Transthoracic echocardiograms were positive in 6/9 and transesophageal echocardiograms in 5/5. All 10 pts underwent valve replacement and all valve cultures were positive. Two pts died of post-operative complications, the rest received amphotericin B (mean1870 mg, range 288-3000 mg). One pt died 4.5 yrs later from other reasons. Two of 8 (25%) survivors had 3 relapses of PVE, 1 at 2.5 yrs and the other at 3 and 12 years. Both pts underwent valve replacement and received amphotericin B followed by longterm oral azole therapy. Both are alive at 10 and 5 years, respectively. We conclude that pts with fungal PVE may present early or late, commonly exhibit significant clinical stigmata, and have a notable tendency to relapse, even after combined surgical and medical therapy. Oral azole therapy may have a role in suppressing infection in pts with relapsing fungal PVE. Careful long term follow-up is essential given the risk of late relapse. 460 Aetiology of Community Acquired Pneumonia with reference to Chlamydia pneumoniae; prevalence, diagnosis and treatment. A. FULLER', R. PICKLES, D. SPELMAN', W. J. SPICER', S. GARLAND2, M. LEES2, B. COOPER3. 1 Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. 2 Royal Womens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. 3 Delpharm, New Zealand. Consecutive adult patients (; 18 yrs) with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), admitted to Alfred Hospital over a 1 year period, were intensively screened for Chlamydia pneumoniae in addition to usual investigations. A throat swab was examined using tissue culture, polymerase chain reaction and direct immunofluorescence techniques. Acute and convalescent sera were tested by specific immunofluorescence for IgG, IgM and IgA. Additional data were collected to enable determination of risk factors; epidemiology of infection; the predictive value of clinical signs/symptoms and standard laboratory tests, and response rates/relapse rates to standard antibiotics. Of 228 eligible cases of pneumonia, 19 cases were due to C. pneumoniae, accounting for 8.3% of all cases of CAP and 17 % of the cases of CAP where a potential pathogen was identified. Means for selected variables were: age of patient (53 years), duration of symptoms (5 days), admission temperature (38.9?C) and blood leucocyte count (10.95 x 109/L). Most common symptoms were wheeze (50%), myalgia (44%), headache (40%) and pharyngitis (30%). Abnormal laboratory tests noted were proteinuria (75%), liver function (55%) and hyponatraemia (30%). A satisfactory clinical response without relapse was achieved in 75% (6/8) of cases treated with erythromycin, 66% (2/3) of cases treated with doxycycline and 100% (4/4) cases treated with roxithromycin. 461 Leukocytosis of Undetermined Origin (LUO): Characterization of Subsequently Proven Etiology and Outcome. A. DAVIDSON, M. MARIAN, J. BAND, C. LAUTER, and M. ZERVOS. William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI Obiective: To determine the etiology of LUO in patients who were evaluated by the Adult Infectious Disease Consultative Service, to define the appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and to report patient outcome. Design: Retrospective review and analysis of patients seen in Adult Infectious Disease Consultation at a 1,000 bed community-teaching hospital during 1990-1994. LUO was defined as an elevation of WBC count (&gt;15,000/pL) on several occasions during a period longer than 2 weeks and defied I week of comprehensive inpatient evaluation. Results: 78/5,200 (1.5%) consultations were requested specifically for evaluation of unexplained leukocytosis. After detailed evaluation by our service, an etiology was subsequently established for 95% of cases. The most common causes included an acute bacterial infection (31 patients [39.7%]), including pneumonia (13), UTI (8), tracheobronchitis (3), deep soft tissue infections (3), cholecystitis (2), endocarditis (1), and meningitis (1); leukemoid reaction (18 patients [23%]); tissue necrosis (10 patients [12.8%]); marrow stimulation seen in hemorrhage/postoperative hematomas (4 patients [5%]); drug-induced (prednisone, 7 [9%] patients; lithium, I [1.3%] patient); and stress from acute seizure and fever, 2 (2.56%) patients. One patient had marked leukocytosis with eosinophilia secondary to an allergic reaction to quinidine. Four patients (5%) had primary unexplained leukocytosis. Those four patients subsequently died, as opposed to 6 of 74 (8%) patients with a defined etiology (P &lt; .001). Fifty percent of patients had no WBC differential counts. Conclusion: The majority of patients with neutrophilic leukocytosis subsequently had an acute infectious etiology identified and readily treatable. Secondary leukemoid reactions were induced by multifactorial reasons such as inflammatory disorders, metabolic derangements, and hemorrhagic problems. It was surprising how infrequently differential WBC counts were obtained before our consultations. No conclusion can be made regarding the etiology of the primary unexplained leukocytosis of the four patients who died since an autopsy was not performed in any of these cases.</page><page sequence="79">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 797 462 Vancomycin-Induced Neutropenia Treated with G-CSF During Home Intravenous Infusion Therapy. KK LAI*, J KLEINJAN and P BELLIVEAU. University of Massachusetts Medical Center and School, Worcester, MA. Three patients (pts) with Staphvlococcus non-aureus osteomyelitis were sent home on long-term IV vancomycin therapy after surgical debridement. After 14 to 20 days of treatment at a cumulative dose of 17 to 57 grams of vancomycin, all 3 developed neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil (ANC) count of 483 to 592 cells/mm3. At the time of neutropenia, the peak and trough vancomycin levels were subtherapeutic in 1, therapeutic in 2. Renal functions were normal in all patients and peripheral eosinophilia was seen in 2 pts. As there were still some weeks remaining in the therapy, GCSF at a dose of 300/ug was given 1 to 3 times/week with immediate and sustained increase in ANC. All patients were able to complete their therapy. Cummulative Vancomycin dose (grams) before Days of ANC Cases Neutropenia Therapy Cells/mm3 Eosinophilia (%) pt #1 57 20 483.0 7 pt #2 30 15 875 2 pt #3 17 14 592 8 The mechanism of vancomycin-induced neutropenia is still unclear. Peripheral eosinophilia as seen in our pts supported the possibility of hypersensitivity reaction. Rapid recovery of granulocytes after administration of G-CSF suggested that the myeloid precursors were likely to be relatively intact. Vancomycin-induced neutropenia can occur among outpts on long- term antimicrobial therapy. Administration of G-CSF avoids unnecessary interruption of such therapy. 463 Extended experience with the 2-day dexamethasone regimen for childhood bacterial meningitis: Low incidence of sequelae.G.A.SYROGIANNOPOULOS*, A.N. LOURIDA, M.C. THEODORIDOU, C.J. MITSELOS, N.G. BERATIS. Univ. of Patras; Univ. of Athens; "Karamandanion" Children's Hospital of Patras, Greece. The role of dexamethasone (DX) therapy in the treatment of bacterial meningitis (BM) continues to be under evaluation. The duration of the DX regimen is being investigated in the 3 collaborating Greek centers in two consecutive studies since March 1988. We are reporting our extended experience with the 2-day short duration DX regimen. Children (n=149, ages 2.5 months to 15 years) were studied. The etiology of meningitis was N. meninoitidis (Nm) n=81, H. influenzae type b (Hib) n=57, S. pneumoniae (Sp) n=10 and Group B streptococcus GBS) n=1. All Sp strains were susceptible to penicillin. The antibiotic regimen at the enrollment was ampicillin and chloramphenicol (ages &lt; 6 years, n=123) or penicillin G and chloramphenicol (ages &gt; 6 years, n=14 ) or ceftriaxone ( for all ages in the most recent protocol, n=12). Early DX therapy was administered in a dosage schedule of 0.15 mg/kg, q 6h IV, for 2 days. Gross GI bleeding occurred in 1(0.7%) of the 149 patients. The up-to-date incidence of long-term audiologic (moderate or more severe unilateral or bilateral hearing impairment) or neurologic sequelae (or both) appears in the table: Etiology Audiologic Neurologic Audiologic and/or Neurologic sequelae Nm 1/68a 0/75 1/68 Hib 1/42 0/54 1/42 Sp 2/10 2/10 2/10 GBS 0/1 0/1 0/1 aNo. with sequelae / no. examined. The short duration of the DX adjunctive therapy appears to be appropriate for the treatment of BM, since it is associated with a low incidence of sequelae. The good results of the 2-day DX regimen can be explained by the currently prominent speculation that the first 1 or 2 days of treatment are the most important for the outcome of the infants and children with BM. 464 Parvovirus B19-induced Transfusion-dependent Anemia in an Adult Liver Transplant Recipient: Effective Treatment with Intravenous Immunoglobulin. FY CHANG*, N SINGH, T GAYOWSKI, IR MARINO. VAMC, Pittsburgh, PA. A 43-year-old male, underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for end stage liver disease due to hepatitis C. Postoperative medications comprised of tacrolimus (FK-506), azathioprine, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole and interferon-alpha (as prophylaxis for hepatitis C recurrence). Two months posttransplant, the patient was noted to have hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.4 g/dl and hematocrit (Hct) of 22.7%. Transfusion dependent anemia of unclear etiology persisted for 7 months. A bone marrow biopsy revealed erythroid hypoplasia and giant pronormoblasts with prominent intranuclear inclusions, characteristic of parvovirus B19 infection Serum and bone marrow cells were positive for parvovirus B19 DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction Pretransplant serum IgG against B19 was positive indicating reactivation infection (IgM titers were positive at the time of diagnosis). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) Ig/kg/day for 3 days was prescribed. Two weeks later, B19 DNA was undetectable in serum. Four weeks later, Hgb was 12.8 g/dl, Hct was 39.8%. He was no longer transfusion dependent. Anemia and cytopenia are a common occurrence after organ transplantation; an etiologic agent often remains unidentified. Parvovirus B 19 infection represents a treatable and often unsuspected cause of marrow suppression in organ transplant recipients. Although bone marrow suppression is the most common sequelae of B19 infection, unusual clinical significance of this infection also stems from the fact that extramarrow invasive disease with fatal outcome can also occur after organ transplantation. The availability of potentially effective therapy with IVIG emphasizes the importance of establishing the diagnosis of B19 infection in organ transplant recipients. 465 Molecular Epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) among AIDS patients in Developing Countries: Kenya and Trinidad. R.D. ARBEIT, C.F. VON REYN*, C. BARTHOLOMEW, J. EDWARDS, R. PELZ, M. LEWIS, R. BRINDLE, C.F. GILKS AND B. KREISWIRTH. VA Med Center, Boston, MA, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Med Center, Hanover, NH, Port of Spain Gen Hosp and Trinidad Public Health Lab, Trinidad, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kenya, and Public Health Res Inst, NY, NY. Recent studies of the molecular epidemiology of Mtb in developed countries have revealed different patterns of transmission and reactivation among different patient populations. We have done Southern blot analyses of RFLPs associated with IS6110 for Mtb isolates from prospectively cultured AIDS patients with CD4&lt;200 in two developing countries (Nairobi, Kenya and Port of Spain, Trinidad). Site No. of patient No. (%) of No. (%) of No. of isolates typed unique "clustered" distinct IS6110 types isolates clusters Kenya 13 8 (62%) 5 (38%) 2 Trinidad 14 3 (21%) 11(79%) 1 The Kenyan isolates had a relatively balanced mix of unique isolate types and small clusters (3 and 2 patients, respectively), comparable to patterns observed among urban patients in developed countries and presumably representing both endogenous reactivation and exogenous infection. The Trinidad isolates were dominated by a single IS6110 pattern, which was also found in 6 (60%) Mtb isolates from 10 additional arbitrarily selected patients, including who were 5 HIV-negative. These observations suggest that a substantial fraction of tuberculosis in Trinidad may reflect new infection associated with the HIV pandemic. 466 Development of Clinical and Immunologic Findings in a Prospectively followed, HIV-infected, Pediatric Cohort. P. PALUMBO', Y. WESLEY, B. HOLLAND, E. CONNOR, and J. OLESKE. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ. The Newark Perinatal Cohort has serially recruited and evaluated HIV- infected pregnant women and their infants since 1987. Through Dec, 1993, 269 mother-infant pairs have participated with 223 evaluable children having established infection status (40 [17.9%] HIV-infected). Mean values for number of pregnancies (4.2), gestational age (37.7), birth weight (2752 grams), and APGAR scores were not significantly different between infected and uninfected infant outcomes. There have been 12 deaths in the cohort, 9 among HIV-infected infants. Six of the latter occurred under 7 months of age with 3 secondary to PCP and 2 to prematurity. CDC classification of infected infants is depicted in the Table using clinical (top) and immune (bottom) parameters. Immune dysfunction (subnormal CD4 for age) was observed in 55% at 12 months and 100% by 4 years. Clinical symptoms were evident in 74% at 12 months and 100% by 4 years. These observations support the relatively rapid progression of Pediatric HIV infection and suggest that long term asymptomatic infection is rare.

ME. MIRANDA, P. MUIOZ, M. RODRIGUEZ-CREIXEMS, R. SANCHEZ, T. COQUE and E. BOUZA*. Hospital "Gregorio Maran6n". Madrid. Spain. The relationship between HIV infection and Haemophilus influenzae has been clearly demonstrated; however there are few studies describing the clinical and microbiological characteristics of HIB in HIV- infected adults. We reviewed the medical records of all 116 patients with HIB admitted to a general hospital from 1986 to 1994. Among the 78 HIB episodes detected in adults, 16 (20%) occurred in HIV infected patients. Prevalence of HIB in HIV (+) patients was 5/1000 admissions versus 0.2/1000 in HIV (-). Mean age was 29.7 years (21-40) and 11 (69%) were men. Mean number of CD4 + cells was 155/mcl (3-343) and 15/16 were IVDA. Infection was community acquired in 87.5% of the cases. One patient had been previously splenectomized. Fourteen patients (87%) presented with pneumonia (4 unilobar) and 2 112%) with primary bacteremia. Mean number of positive blood cultures was 2.7 (1-8). Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 4 patients (Salmonella, B. fragilis, S. aureus, S. viridans). Species corresponded in all cases to H. influenzae. Resistance to ampicillin was 32%, to erythromycin 62%, to cotrimoxazole 69% and to rifampin 38%. All isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime. Complications included: respiratory failure (19%), shock (19%), and ARDS (6%). Overall mortality was 25% and statystical analysis disclosed as bad prognostic factors: age (mean age in survivors 28 years versus 34), CD4 + cell count/mm3 (229/5), ampicillin resistance (8%/75%) and cotrimoxazole resistance (41%/100%). Stepwise logistic regression identified ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance as independent mortality predictive variables. Adults with HIV infection are at increased risk for H. influenzee bacteremia, the most common clinical presentation being pneumonia. Mortality was higher in more advanced stages of the disease. Empiric antibiotic regimens should take into account the high incidence of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance. In addition, these patients may be candidates for conjugate H. influenzae vaccine trials.</page><page sequence="80">798 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 468 Mycobacterlum avium Complex (MAC): an Increasing Problem in an Area of Low Prevalence. R. BLAZQUEZ, M.J. RUIZ-SERRANO, P. MURIOZ, P. MIRALLES, M. PEREZ-TASCON and E. BOUZA+. Hospital General "Gregorio Marafi6n". Madrid. Spain. Background: MAC infections had a very low incidence among the AIDS patients in Spain where tuberculosis is highly endemic. Along recent years MAC infections in AIDS have progressively increased. Objective: To report on the incidence, clinical presentation, Mycobacteriology Clinical Laboratory (MCL) workload, diagnostic yield of clinical samples and therapeutic response to a simple, well-tolerated combination of claritrhomycin and ethambutol (C + E) in MAC infections in AIDS patients. Results: The first HIV+ patient with MAC infection was detected in our institution in 1988. Since then, 54 HIV + patients had MAC infections 18/1000 AIDS admissions). We evolved from 1 patient in 1988 to 21 patients in 1994. MAC represents 12% of all mycobacterial isolates in HIV + patients and the proportion evolved from 3.9% in 1988 to 16.4% in 1994. All MAC infections presented in patients with advanced HIV infection with mean CD4 counts of 73/ul. MAC was the AIDS "defining" infection in 23.4% of our cases. Most frequent clinical manifestations were fever (85.7%), weigh loss (55%) and pulmonary involvement (50%). Our 54 patients had a total of 555 specimens processed for culture in the MCL with a mean of 10.2 samples/patient. Of those, 122 (21.9%) were positive (mean 2.25 positive samples/patient). The specimens with a higher yield were bone marrow aspirates 65.3% (26 cultured/17 positive) and blood cultures 47.7% (132 cultured/63 positive), followed by respiratory samples 16.5% (181 cultured/30 positive) and urines 5.3% (168 cultured/9 positive). Improvement, relapse rate, mortality (in number) and survival (in days) in 3 groups of patients were as follows: Untreated group -16 cases- (0,0,13,104 days); C+E treatment -31 cases- (23,5,15,253 days): Other treatments -7 cases- (4,0,6,293 days). Conclusion: MAC infections are steadily increasing in our institution and bone marrow aspirates and blood cultures are the higher yielding samples for diagnosis. C + E turned out as an effective, all oral, well tolerated combination for treatment. 469 Assessment of the quality of primary care of HIV-seropositive patients (PTS) as reflected by management *with antiretrovirals (AR) and PCP prophylaxis (PCPP). Elfatih I. Abter, Max Greenlee and Donna Mildvan. Beth Israel Medical Center. New York, N.Y. To evaluate the quality of primary care of the HIV-scropositive (HIV+) persons through evaluation of their prior therapy with AR and PCPP, we interviewed 38 new PTS who came voluntarily or were refcrred to us in a hospital-based ambulatory care clinic between July 1994 and March 1995. PTS' mean age was 39 (range 23-57). 28 were male and 10 female. The risk factor for HIV was intravenous drug use (IVDU) in 19, homosexuality (H) in 10, heterosexual sex (HE) in 8 and blood transfusion in one. Eighteen and 12 PTS, respectively, were managed in hospital and community-based clinics . The remaining 8 were newly diagnosed as HIV+, 5 of them ( 4 IVDU and I H ) unaware of their HIV+ status until the onset of an opportunistic infection. Seven PTS (2 IVDU, 4 H, and 1 HE) with no symptoms and mean CD4+ count 393X106/L (250-563) had no indication for PCPP. Two of them were on AR, 3 have tried an agent and did not tolerate, 1 had no indication (CD4+ 563) and I was not offered. The PTS with advanced and/or symptomatic disease were 23 ( 12 IVDU, 4 H and 7 HE ), with mean CD4+ count 131XI0/L (1-456), all had firm indication for both AR and PCPP. Of them, only 5 (22%) were receiving both AR and PCPP. Eight PTS (34%) were receiving PCPP alone and 10 (43%) were receiving none. Various reasons were given by the PTS (some gave multiple). We conclude that many of the HIV+ PTS who have symptomatic or advanced disease are not laking Ihe indicated AR and/or PCPP. Reasons for not taking AR.

G. Menichetti', A. Tosti, G. Gatti', M. Fiorio, F. Miletich', M. B. Pasticci, M. Marroni, D. Bassetti#, S. Pauluzzi. Institute of Infectious Diseases, University of Perugia, and Genoa", Italy. Background and obiective: Amphoterin B +/- flucytosine or FLU, 200-400 mg/d, may be suboptimal therapy for AIDS-associated CM. Because early deaths in CM may be related to slow CSF sterilization, in the hope of obtaining a more rapid mycological response, we used high-dose FLU for primary treatment of CM. Methods: Fourteen patients (pts) with acute AIDS-associated CM were treated with high-dose iv FLU (800-1,000 mg/d) from the diagnosis until two consecutive negative cultures of CSF. Results: CM was the AIDS-defining condition in 12 pts; the mean of OKT4 was 38.21 cells/mm3 (range, 3-85). At baseline, altered mental status was present in 3 pts, CSF cryptococcal antigen titer was &gt;1:1,024 in 7 pts, the CSF WBC count was &lt;20 cells/mm' in 10 pts, and initial CSF pressure was &gt;18 cm H0, in 10 pts. At 10 weeks, the clinical success rate was 61.5% (8/13); the response rate, determined by Kaplan-Meier estimate of the length of time to the first negative CSF culture, was 76.8%; and the overall mortality was 23% (3 deaths but none related to progressive CM). The median length of time to the first negative CSF culture was 33.5 days (95% Cl: 18.3-67.3). All CSF cultures were negative for cryptococci by day 112. At the end of treatment, 10/13 patients (76.9%) responded to primary therapy. Failures occurred in 3 patients (23.1%) who improved after iv amphotericin B. Mean fluconazole serum and CSF levels at steady state were 42.47 + 26.31 ug/mL and 36.63 + 21.08 pg/mL, respectively (CSF/serum ratio, 0.86). Fluconazole MICs for the 14 isolates were: &lt;0.125 pg/mL for 3 strains; I pg/mL for 1 strain; 2 ug/mL for I strain; and 4 ug/mL for 9 strains. No treatment was interrupted or dose tapered due to side effects; while on study, 7 patients had a &gt;2 g/dL decline in hemoglobin; 7 and 3 patients had &gt;30% decrease in WBC or platelet counts from baseline. A three-fold increase in transaminases was documented in 4 patients. Conclusions: High-dose FLU might be an effective and well-tolerated option for AIDS-associated CM; this approach warrants further investigation in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. 471 Effect of Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) Cutaneous Sensitization on HIV Disease Progression M LOVELESS*, B BRADLEY*, L FIELDS, S DHARMANANDA**. Oregon Health Sciences University*, Portland OR; Institute for Traditional Medicine*, Portland, OR. Background: Studies on long-term survivors has emphasized the importance of sustained HIV-specific CD8 lymphocyte activity. DNCB is a common solvent which produces a contact dermatitis which is associated with increased cell-mediated activity and prominent CD8 cell infiltration of the skin. Pilot studies have suggested improvement in the natural history of HIV disease in persons who use DNCB. Objective: To determine whether DNCB effects the clinical, immunologic and virologic parameters of HIV infection during six months of DNCB sensitization. Methods: Twenty-eight asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with variable CD4 counts, no previous AIDS defining complications and no anti-viral therapy within the prior three months were randomized to received topical DNCB vs. acetone sham treatment over six months. All participants were also receiving Chinese medicine and acupuncture. Clinical and laboratory data were collected every three months; a subset had lymph node biopsies and blood studies for viral and cytokine studies. Results: All persons receiving DNCB developed a cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity reaction documented by skin biopsy. Three patients had enhanced local cutaneous reactions and one had a generalized skin rash. There were no major systemic adverse effects related to DNCB. The CD4 counts (mean?SE) increased slightly in both groups (DNCB 346?47 to 360?58; control 361?25 to 378?49). The CD8 counts showed a greater increase in the control group (DNCB 924?104 to 962+99; control 780*75 to 1085?115). A higher proportion of the DNCB treated persons had a net decline of CD4 cells (10/15 vs. 5/13), however, four patients in the DNCB group and one in the non-DNCB group had greater than 25% increase in CD4 cells from baseline. Analysis of viral load and cytokines are presented separately. Two persons in the DNCB group progressed to CDC stage A3, versus one in the control. There were no differences in HIV-related clinical outcomes between the two groups. Conclusions: DNCB did not produce a significant difference in clinical or immunologic outcome over six months of observation. DNCB produces minor side effects with occasional generalized cutaneous reaction. Further trials may be warranted, but should include persons receiving standard anti- viral therapy. 472 The Use of Non-Conventional Therapies among Patients with HIV. K.W. Rahn*, M.A. Abramson, C.B. Hicks, D.J. Sexton. Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C. Nationwide surveys have shown that alternative medical therapy (defined as any therapy considered to be non-conventional by current standards) is used by approximately one third of the general patient population. Studies of patients in HIV clinics done from 1989-1991 demonstrated that the use of alternative therapy among HIV patients is common; however, such studies primarily involved white, homosexual males in large, urban areas. We undertook a cross-sectional study at the Duke Adult HIV Clinic which serves a mid-sized city and several mal counties. We describe the prevalence of use, cost, and rationale of alternative therapy among a heterogeneous cohort of HIV/AIDS patients. 100 patients were surveyed. The study population was virtually identical to the total clinic population. 36% of patients reported the use of at least one type of alternative therapy during the past year. 75% of patients using alternative therapy had informed their clinic doctor of their use of non- conventional treatments; 97% of these patients indicated that their clinic doctor either approved or felt neutral about their use of non-conventional therapy. Most commonly tried therapies included high-dose vitamins (56%), herbal therapies (47%), homeopathic remedies (22%), yoga, meditation or relaxation therapy (16%), massage therapy (14%), acupuncture (8%), and aroma therapy (8%). The education level between those who used alternative therapy and those who did not use alternative therapy significantly differed (p&lt;0.0005). All patients using alternative therapy had at least a high school degree -- 85% had attended college. Patients not using alternative therapies were less educated. 28% did not finish high school while only 44% attended college. Of those who used alternative therapy, 63% claimed that their therapies were physically "very useful" (21% "somewhat useful", 13% "not useful", and 3% "mildly harmful"); 62% stated that their therapies were mentally "very useful" (14% "somewhat useful", 19% "not useful", and 5% "mildly harmful"). Of those who used alternative therapy, 5% spent &gt;$500 per month, 14% spent between $101 and $500 per month, 39% spent between $26 and $100 per month, and 42% spent &lt; $25 per month. Our study demonstrates that in a heterogeneous population, a significant number of patients who are HIV positive use non-conventional therapy. They can spend considerable money and they find the therapy useful. 473 Role of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in AIDS Patients with Diarrhea. S.M. RAY*, S.E. THOMPSON, C.R. HORSBURGH. Emory University School of Medicine and Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, GA. Diarrhea is common in AIDS patients with low CD4 counts. Disseminated MAC (DMAC) has been associated with diarrhea. To assess the clinical significance of a positive stool culture for MAC we performed a retrospective study of AIDS patients in our clinic with diarrhea. The charts of patients who had mycobacterial stool cultures ordered over a 2 year period were reviewed. Of 160 patients with a history of diarrhea and a chart available for review, 107 had a complete laboratory evaluation of diarrhea. Fifty patients (46.7%) had etiologic agents identified: 19 had MAC only, 12 had MAC plus an additional agent (5 microsporidia, 3 C.difficile toxin, I Cryptosporidium, I Cryptosporidium and C.difficile toxin, 1 Giardia, 1 Campylobacter spp.), and 19 had agents other than MAC ( 6 C.difficile toxin, 3 Cryptosporidium, 2 microsporidia, 2 Campylobacter spp., 2 Shigella spp., 2 Yersinia spp., I Salmonella spp., I hookworm). Possible risk factors for MAC in the stool included: MAC in stool no MAC in stool p value (n=3 1) (n=76) median duration of diarrhea 30 days 21 days &lt;0.05 median one month weight loss 4.6 Ibs 2.5 Ibs &lt;0.05 median CD4 count 15 82 &lt;0.00005 positive stool AFB smear 33% 1.9% &lt;0.0005 DMAC 64.5% 1.3% &lt;0.00005 other pathogens identified 38.7% 25.0% NS Of the 31 patients with positive MAC stool culture, the 11 patients without DMAC had a higher median CD4 count and were less likely to have a positive AFB smear than the 20 patients with DMAC (18.0 vs 5.5, p&lt;0.05 and 0% vs 50%, p&lt;0.05 respectively). In 10 patients without other cause of diarrhea identified and for whom follow-up information was available, there was no association between administration of antimycobacterial agents and resolution of diarrhea. We conclude that MAC may not be a causative agent of diarrhea in AIDS or that current therapy may not be able to alter the course of illness. Prospective evaluation of the role of MAC in diarrhea is needed.</page><page sequence="81">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 799 474 Utility of Neuroimaging Studies and Lumbar Puncture for Evaluation of HIV-infected Patients With Neurologic Complaints. VE MULANOVICH, PS HARRIS* and LI SANDERS. Univ Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL. HIV-infected patients (pts) with neurologic complaints frequently undergo neuroimaging studies and/or lumbar puncture (LP). The appropriate indications for and the efficacy of this approach have not been evaluated. As part of an ongoing prospective study, we have identified and are following 20 consecutive HIV-infected pts evaluated by their physicians for neurologic complaints. None of the pts had previously recognized central nervous system disease, although 30% had previously undergone workup for neurologic complaints. The most common symptoms were headache (75%), fever (50%), nausea/vomiting (45%), photophobia (20%), altered sensorium (10%), and psychiatric disturbances (10%). Symptoms had been present for a mean duration of 10.6 days. The median age was 33 years, and 18 were male. The median CD4 count was 50 cells/mm', with a mean of 1.8 prior opportunistic infections per pt. Nineteen pts underwent computerized tomography (CT) of the head, with the following findings: normal (35%), atrophy alone (35%), sinusitis (20%), and multiple enhancing masses (5%). Five pts underwent subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with additional information being gained in two cases. In one case, MRI was performed after a new-onset neurologic deficit and revealed multiple nonenhancing masses not seen by a prior contrasted CT. Another pt had MRI demonstrating mild sinusitis. One pt did not receive CT but had MRI that demonstrated only an old lesion. Fourteen pts underwent LP, with the following results: negative (72%), cryptococcal meningitis (CM) (21%), and non-crypto lymphocytic meningitis (7%). The serum cryptococcal antigen was 100% sensitive for CM and the positive predictive value was 75%. The final diagnoses were as follows: sinusitis (30%), tension, migraine, or idiopathic headache (25%), CM (15%), HIV dementia (10%), and one patient each with toxoplasmosis, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, lymphocytic meningitis, lactic acidosis, and mania. Specific therapy was offered based on these diagnoses in 55% of cases; the other cases received only symptomatic therapy. Preliminary analysis revealed that one of five MRI scans done after CT offered additional information which affected patient care. Neither CD4 counts nor any specific symptoms were significantly predictive of finding a treatable etiology for the neurologic complaint. One of six pts with a previous workup for headache had a new diagnosis made. For pts with a normal neurologic exam and no meningeal signs, a negative contrasted CT scan, and a negative serum CrAg, no important additional information was gained by LP or MRI. 475 Effects of Dinitrochlorobenzene Therapy on Viral Load and Cytokine Expression in Lymphoid Tissue of HIV- infected individuals. O COHEN*?, G PANTALEO?, M LOVELESSt, B BRADLEY+, D SCHWARTZENTRUBERtt, B BAIRD?, AND A FAUCI?. ?NIAID, Bethesda, MD; t Oregon Heath Sciences University, Portland, OR; tlnstitute for Traditional Medicine, Portland, OR; tt NCI, Bethesda, MD. Objective: To measure the effect of dinitrochtorobenzene (DNCB) therapy on HIV viral burden and replication as well as cytokine expression in peripheral blood (PB) and lymphoid tissue (LT). Methods: Eight HIV-infected individuals were treated weekly with topical sensitizing doses of DNCB and daily with oral Chinese herbs: three other patients were treated with herbs alone. Patients underwent lymph node biopsies at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Viral burden (i.e. the frequency of HIV-infected cells), viral replication, and cytokine expression were determined by semi-quantitative DNA and RNA PCR on mononudear cells obtained from PB and LT. Results: CD4 + T-cell counts decreased in the DNCB group from a mean of 448 cells/dl at baseline to 289 cells/4l at 6 months (p-0.006) and in the control group from 398 cells/l to 277 cells/il (p-0.04). Total CD8+ T-cell counts remained unchanged in both groups although the percentage of CD8+CD38+ cells increased from a mean of 42.8% to 48.6%/ in the DNCB group (p-0.004) and from 44.7% to 49.7% in the control group (p-0.05). Among patients treated with DNCB the mean frequency of HIV-infected mononuclear cells remained unchanged in PB (6089 HIV DNA copies/10* cells at baseline vs. 6264 at 6 months; p-NS) and LT (16,929 HIV DNA copies/10' cells at baseline vs. 15,105 at 6 months; p-NS). There was also no change in viral burden among control patients. One patient treated with DNCB had a significant decrease in HIV RNA in LT (from 544 fg of HIV RNA per 1.5pg total RNA at baseline to 58 fg at 6 months): however, overall there was no significant change in the mean levels of HIV RNA in LT of DNCB recipients (430 fg at baseline, 314 fg at 6 months; p-NS) or control patients (194 fg at baseline, 157 fg at 6 months; p-NS). No significant changes were seen in levels of expression of Interferon-y, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-4, IL- 6, and IL-10 in PB and LT of both groups. Conclusions: CD4+ T-cell counts decreased in the DNCB group as well as the control group. The percentage of CD8+CD38+ cells, which may correlate with disease progression, increased in the DNCB and control groups. DNCB therapy did not affect viral burden or viral replication in PB or LT nor did it induce a shift in cytokine expression. 476 The Influence of PCP-prophylaxis on bacteriuria and resistance development in men infected with HIV-1. DA van Dooyeweert, MME Schneider, JCC Borleffs &amp; IM Hoepelman. University Hospital, Dept of Medicine and Eijkman-Winkler lab for Medical Microbiology, Utrecht, the Netherlands. Introduction: Previously we have shown that men infected with HIV-1 and a CD4+ cell count &lt; 200x10 /I are at increased risk for bacteriuria (AIDS 1992, 6:179-84). Thereafter we showed that primary PCP-prophylaxis with low dose TMP/SMZ was more effective than aerosolized pentamidine (NEJM 1992, 327:1836-41). Ob ective: to study retrospectively the influence of primary PC -prophylaxis (TMP/SMZ 480 mg or Pentamidine 300 mgl and secondary prophylaxis (960 mg) on bacteriuria and TMP/SMZ resistance. Method: During 4 months we cultured all men receiving PCP- prophylaxis at feast once. Moreover, we also checked Tiles for bacteriuria in the past. The files from deceased patients were also checked fr bacteriuria. TMP/SMZ resistance was defined as an MIC &gt; 4/76 mg/I. A positive culture was defined as &gt;10 CFU/ml. Results: TMP/SMZ(480) TMP/SMZ(960) Pentamidine Patients no 52 23 28 CD4+count 71(0-200) 45(0-200) 42 (0-200) Cultures no 113 59 102 Follow up (wks) 62(6-120) 63 (4-240) 98 (22-240) Pos cultures 12 7 14 No of mo 14 8 18 No of patients with os. cult. 9(17%) 5(22%) 9(32%) No of TMP/SMZ resistant mo 12(86%) 7(88%) 11(61%) Time to resist 4-154 wks 1-88 1-171 Conclusions: Prevalence of bacteriuria in men infected with HIV-1 remains high despite PCP-prophylaxis. As expected prevalence of bacteriuria is higher in patients treated with pentamidine. However slqnificantly more patients on TMP/SMZ are infected with a resistant mo. 477 Stavudine (d4T) as Salvage Therapy in Patients with Advanced HIV Disease. M.R. WALLACE* L.K. MILLER, H. BRIGNAC, P.E. OLSON. Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California. Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of d4T in patients with advanced HIV disease whose disease has progressed in spite of prolonged therapy with other antiretrovirals. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all 36 patients started on d4T during 1994 for prior antiretroviral therapy duration, indication for d4T, CD4 count, CD4%, clinical outcome, and drug toxicity. Results: 36 patients were treated with d4T (1st used at this institution August 1994). 33 had failed prior antiretroviral therapy (mean duration 34 months; range 11 to 84 months) and 3 were intolerant of AZT, ddI and ddC. The mean age was 40.3 years, and the mean initial CD4 was 123 cells/mm3. After a mean of 5 months of d4T therapy, the mean CD4 count, CD4% and weight were unchanged. Five patients (14%) developed toxicities which necessitated stopping the medication; 3 with neuropathy and 2 with hepatitis. Two of the neuropathy patients were unable to ambulate for several weeks after discontinuation. Conclusion: d4T can stabilize falling CD4 counts and weight in heavily pretreated HIV-infected patients with advanced disease, but a sizable subset will develop severe, dose-limiting toxicity. 478 Risk Factors for Recurrent Oral Candidiasis in HIV Infection. C.J. FICHTENBAUM*, N. LIN, O. GUERRA, and W.G. POWDERLY. Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, Missouri. Although oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is very common in HIV infection, not all patients develop recurrent (&gt;1 episode) OPC. Recent studies have suggested that azole-resistant candidiasis in advanced HIV disease occurs primarily in patients with recurrent OPC, probably associated with the use of prophylactic antifungal therapy. Alternative strategies of managing recurrent OPC in at-risk populations might help delay the emergence of resistance. Therefore, we evaluated 471 HIV-infected persons followed at the Washington University AIDS Clinical Trials Unit from October, 1987 - August, 1994, to identify risk factors for the development of recurrent pseudomembranous OPC. The median age of the cohort was 34 years; 95% were men; 78% were white; and the median CD4+ lymphocyte count at entry was 215 cells/mm3. The median duration of follow up was 36 months. Oral candidiasis occurred in 282 (60 %) persons. Of those, 164 had recurrent OPC (34% of the total cohort). As expected, the incidence of OPC increased as the CD4+ lymphocyte count declined (p=.02). Most initial episodes of OPC occurred when the CD4+ lymphocyte count was less than 300 cells/mm3 (82%). On univariate analysis, prior occurrence of varicella-zoster virus infection (VZV) or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were significantly associated with the development of a first episode of OPC (p &lt;.001 each). In addition, prior episodes of VZV or PCP were also associated with the development of recurrent OPC (p=.001 and .004, respectively). In summary, a minority (approximately one third) of patients with advanced HIV disease develop recurrent OPC with the risk being highest in those with other opportunistic infections and low CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Identification of such high risk populations may guide more rational strategies of therapeutic and prophylactic antifungal therapy, potentially minimizing the emergence of resistance. 479 Quality of Life Among HIV Seropositive Patients on Monotherapy and Combination Antiretroviral Therapy. N.M.H. GRAHAM,* S. GANGE, B.B. CHEN, E. BING,1 J. CHMIEL,Z S. ZUCCONI,3 L. JACOBSON. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; 'UCLA; 2Northwestern University; 3University of Pittsburgh. AIM: To compare quality of life amonrg HIV seropositive patients taking either monotherapy (MT-zidovudine, zalcitabine, didanosine or stavudine) or combination therapy (C-concurrent administration of 2 or more antiretrovirals). METHODS: Gay or bisexual men with HIV infection participating in Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study who were on MT or CT and attended study visit 21 (n=334) completed the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). This self-administered instrument measures quality of life (QOL) on 8 domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, physical role limitations, emotional role limitations, mental health, social functioning, energy/fatigue and health perceptions. For each domain we compared the relative odds (OR) of having impaired QOL (bottom 25th percentile of distribution) with impaired QOL (top 75th percentile of distribution) using logistic regression models. For each analysis we adjusted for CD4 count, HIV symptoms, AIDS diagnosis and duration of antiretroviral use. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses there was no sigoificant difference in QOL scores between men on MT or CT after adjusting for disease stage and time on therapy. However there was a trend for the CT group to have better physical functioning (OR=1.6; 95% CI=0.9, 3.1), fewer emotional role limitations (OR= 1.9; 95% Cl=0.9, 4.1), less bodily pain (OR= 1.6; 95% CI=0.8, 3.0). For the physical functioning domain a strong interaction was seen by disease stage. CT was associated with significantly better physical functioning than MT among men without a clinical AIDS diagnosis (OR = 2.0; 95% Cl = 1.0-4.3) but not among men with AIDS (OR=0.8; 95% CI =0.2-2.9). Similar results were obtained in prospective analyses. CONCLUSIONS: CT was well tolerated by men in the MACS. Among those without AIDS, CT was associated with significantly better physical functioning than MT, but not among those with more advanced disease.</page><page sequence="82">800 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 480 Effect of Protease Inhibitor MK-639 on Viral Load and Function of Blood and Lymph Node Cells. RT Steigbigel *+, JA Thomas+, BP Craddock+, E Irwin+, EL Cooney., J Chodakewitz+ + and M Burk+. University Medical Center at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY+, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT*, and Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA+ +. Treatment with the inhibitor of HIV-1 protease MK-639 has led to rapid and profound decreases in the HIV load in the blood of infected patients. We examined several variables in the blood and lymph nodes (LN) of 5 patients immediately before and after 8 weeks of treatment with MK-639 and one patient after 4 weeks. The initial absolute mean number of CD4 cells was 188 (range 140-280) Increasing by 77% to mean of 332 (range 300-370) at 8 weeks. There was a decrease in the HIV load in both blood and LN of all patients. The mean * SD infectious units per milion cells (IUPM) of HIV for the group were: Blood LN Week 123 93 1157 2185 8 3 8 17 ? 37 There was a significant (Wlcoxon matched paired analysis) decrease in HIV load (IUPM) in the blood and LN (p&lt;.05). The quantity of HIV was signfi- cantly greater (p&lt;.02) in the LN than the blood. In situ analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplified pro-viral DNA of CD4 cells from blood showed a decline from 67% (range 29-98) positive cells to 38% (range 7- 52%), while the proportion of CD4 cells In LN showing pro-viral DNA did not change; 27 to 28% positive. low cytometric analysis of blood and LN cells was performed for 26 antigens or combinations. There were significant increases in the % and absolute number of CD3 + CD4 + cells in the blood and an increase in the proportion of activated CD4 cells (38+ DR-) in the LN from 0 to 8 weeks. Proliferation assays of blood and LN cells to HIV antigens (rgp 160, rgp 120, p66, p24); non-HIV antigens (tetanus, candida) and the mitogen PHA did not consistently or significantly change for blood or LN cells. All patients remained anergic to skin test antigens. Therefore, at 8 weeks monotherapy with MK-639 induces marked decrease in HIV load in blood and LN with concomitant decrease in pro-viral DNA in the blood but not LN. These changes are associated with an increase in CD4 cells in the blood and activated CD4 cells in the node but no evidence of changes in some functional assays. 481 Early Symptoms/Signs of HIV Infection as Surrogate Clinical Markers of Treatment Effect in Antiviral Trials. Cotton D 2, Hughes M2, Tierney C2, Jiang Q2, Fischl M', Collier A4, Friedland G', Kahn J6. 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; 2Statistical and Data Analysis Center, Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA; 'University of Miami, Miami, FL; 4University of Washington, Seattle, WA; 'Yale University, New Haven, CT; 6University of California, San Francisco, CA. Objective: To assess early HIV-related symptoms and signs as surrogate clinical markers for the development of AIDS or death in clinical trials of antiviral agents. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from three large randomized antiviral trials involving 1839 subjects who did not have AIDS at study entry and who had CD4 counts of 300 or fewer, utilizing Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests and time- dependent proportional hazard regression models. Early HIV symptoms/signs included mucosal candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, diarrhea, fever/night sweats, and weight loss. Results: In two trials, no differences were found between treatments for any symptoms or signs, paralleling the lack of difference found in the development of AIDS or death. In the third trial, where there were significant reductions in the rate of development of AIDS or death for two doses of ddl compared to zidovudine, there were significant differences in the development of diarrhea and weight loss, but not all of the differences among treatment arms for diarrhea and weight loss paralleled those for AIDS or death. Conclusion: This exploratory analysis suggests that early symptoms/signs of HIV infection may have some utility as surrogate clinical markers of treatment effect. Prospective investigation of this issue in future clinical trials appears warranted. 482 Saquinavir monotherapy trial: Prolonged suppression of viral load with higher dosage. J.M.Schapiro*, M.A.Winters, T.C.Merigan. Center for AIDS Research, Stanford University. To evaluate the dose response effect of Saquinavir monotherapy, 40 HIV + patients were enrolled in a dose escalating study at 2 or 4 X prior Saquinavir trial dosages. This presentation will summarize the preliminary comparison of virological, immunological, pharmacological and safety results of the two doses. The 20 patients receiving the lower dose of 3600 mg/day demonstrated a mean maximal decrease in viral load of 1.1 log and a sustained decrease of only 0.5 log at week 20, whereas the first 10 patients in the higher dose of 7200 mg/day had a mean maximum drop of 1.5 log and prolonged suppression with the viral load remaining decreased by over one log at week 20. CD4 + T cell increases in the higher dose group also showed a more durable response with elevations in counts lasting through the 24 weeks of study. A direct correlation of peak viral suppression with plasma drug levels was found in individual patients at both drug dosages, supporting a dose response effect over this exposure level. Side-effects were reported in greater frequency in the high dose patients although the majority of them were minor and did not require dosage modification or discontinuation of therapy. Mutational analysis on both dose cohorts to detect the impact of drug exposure on development of mutations are in progress. These preliminary results suggest that the 7200 mg/day dosage has a superior impact on surrogate markers with sustained suppression of viral load and increase in CD4 + T cell counts at an acceptably moderate increase in toxicity. We are continuing to follow these patients into a second 6 months of therapy. The role that specific mutations play in this dose response and the clinical implications of these preliminary results remain to be determined. 483 The Prevalence of Oral Thrush and Fluconazole Resistant Thrush in HIV+ Patients. ML WEBB', JL GERBERDING, WK HADLEY, BL LEE, JD STANSELL, MA SANDE. San Francisco General Hospital ISFGH). Obiective: 1) Determine the prevalence of oral fungal infections in HIV+ patients. 21 Identify the prevalence of resistance to fluconazole IFCZ) among these isolates. 3) Identify risk factors for FCZ-resistance. Methods: A convenient sample of consecutive out-patients in the SFGH HIVIAIDS clinic are being enrolled in the study. Sociodemographic information, a history of fungal infections and antifungal treatment, and CD4 count are collected by patient interview and chart review. Oropharyngeal swabs are cultured on Sabourad agar, and identified using conventional methods. Isolates are tested for sensitivity to FCZ at 24 and 48 hours using NCCLS proposed methods. Results: From 01105195 to 03131195, 101 patients were enrolled 195% male; 65% Caucasian, 24% African-American; mean age 39; mean C04 count 270; risk factors: 43% only male sex with males, 15% only IVDA, 20% male sex with males and IVDA, 5% other, 16% unknownl. 61 (60.4%) patients had a total of 71 yeast isolates. 55 (77.5%) of the isolates were Candid albicans (C.alb) and 13 (18.3%) were T. glabrata. In addition, one specimen each of C. tropicas, C. parapsi/osis, and S. cervisiae was isolated. 10 patients 19.9%) had 2 isolates (C. alb and T. glbrata in all but one).

Risk factors for FCZ-resistant C.ab include past history of FCZ treatment (P-0.001) and CD4 count &lt; 100 (P-.007) at both 24h and 48h. Conclusion: FCZ resistant C. a/b is prevalent among AIDS patients with advanced disease treated in the past with FCZ. Longitudinal folllow up is needed to determine the clinical significance of FCZ resistance in this population. 484 Evaluation of a Rapid HIV Diagnostic Test in the Emergency Department (ED) at San Francisco General Hospital. JD PEARL*. SY OSAKI. JL PERLMAN. DA ROSE. JL GERBERDING. University of Califoria, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA. Objectives: 1) assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of a licensed rapid HIV antibody sera test (SUDS?, Murex) compared to conventional test protocols (ELISA w/IFA confirmation) among a population of 500 urban ED patients; and 2) evaluate the impact of immediate pro-vision of test results on return rates for: a) confirmatory test result disclosure; and b) related medical care. Methods: Eligible subjects in this randomized controlled clinical trial include medically stable adults who: have &gt;1 HIV risks; are not hospitalized; and have not received HIV test results in the past 6 mos. Subjects are randomized to Group A (immediate SUDS? results disclosure, and ELISA/IFA results disclosed in 8-10 d) or Group B (ELISA/IFA results disclosed in 8-10 d). Follow-up compliance was measured as retum for conventional test result disclosure by the scheduled appointment date (or w/in 3 mos. of testing) and/or having received HIV-related medical care within 3 mos. of testing. Results: From 11/5/93 to 12/31/94, 904 patients were contacted. 353 (39%) contacts agreed to test; and 330/353 (93%) enrolled. Men comprise 71% of subjects; 65% are people of color, and 26% are homeless. Risks: men who had sex with men (9%); injection drug use (24%); both these risks (5%); heterosex. contact (56%); and other or unspecified (6%). No statistical differences in study group assignments exist. By 12/31/94, 148/166 (89%) Group A were evaluable; 157/164 (96%) Group B were evaluable. 34 (23%) in Group A, and 60 (38%) in Group B were compliant with the initial confirmatory result disclosure appointment (p&lt;.006); 48 (32%) of Group A, and 83 (53%) of Group B (p&lt;.001) were compliant w/in 3 months. Too few "positives" had enrolled by 12/31/94 to evaluate compliance with follow-up medical care. By 4/4/95, 17/193 SUDS? tests were positive: 2/17 were false and 1/17 was indeterminate by ELISA/IFA and Westem Blot. SUDS? sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 98.3%; positive predictive value = 82.1 %; and negative predictive value = 100%. Conclusion: The SUDS? test has reliably excluded infection. Caution should be used when using SUDS? results alone for diagnosing HIV, given the low positive predictive value to date. The lower retum rate for confirmatory test results among SUDS? patients may reflect their confidence in the test. 485 Primary Pacumocysds cariai Pneumonia (PCP) in the Post-Prophylactic Er: A Failure in Pevention. M B. KLEIN and R.G. LALONDE. VA Med Ctr, Univ. of MN, Mineapolis, MN, McGill University, Royal Victoria Hospital, Monreal Chest Institute, Monreal, Canada Primary PCP condns to occur frequdy despite the existence of safe and effective prventative medicaions. In ader to examine fact associaed with the ddevelpxnent of primary PCP in the post-prophylactic ea, we reospetively reviewed te medical records of all 83 ptients diagnosed at ou intitution with a fit episode of PCP in the 3 years following the publication of prophylactic guidelines (Jan. 1, 1990 -Dec. 31, 1993). Sixty-nine patients (83%) were homosexual males prsenting on average 36 (range: 0-98) months from HIV serpostivity. PCP was AIDS defminng in 69 (83%). The mean CD4 count within six months of PCP was 60 ? 88 cellsmm3 (range: 0-563; n=62). Hospitlization was required for 63 patients (76%) with a mean stay of 17.6 ? 13.7 (range: 1-86) days. Before diagnosis with PCP, 67 patients (81%) were followed by physicians. In 57 cases, these physicians were experienced in the managemaet of HIV. Only 21 patients (25%) were receiving PCP prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis (16 pentamidine, 4 dapsone, I uimemoprim-slfamethoxazole). It was estimated tat 19 (90%) of these patients took their medications 75-100% of the time. Patients being followed by physicians, but not receiving pophylaxis (n-46) had higher CD4 counts (p &lt; 0.05). Six had CD4 counts above the 200 cells/mm3 recommended cutoff for prophylaxis against PCP. Allergy to rimethoprim-sulfameth- oxazole was documented in 20 patents not ceiving prophylaxis. Only 7 paients had intolerence to al accepted means of prophylaxis. The were no apparent demographic or socioeconomic differences between those on and off prophylaxis. Of patients without physicians (n=16), none was receiving prophylaxis. All but one presented with HIV and PCP concurrently. These patients were more likely to have been immigrants (p&lt;.001) and to have acquired HIV through a Pattern I mode (p&lt;0.01). Overall, the median survival from PCP diagnosis was 122 weeks. Those with a prior AIDS defining illness had significantly reduced survival (p=0.003). Fewer patients were receiving prophylaxis in 1990 as compared with subsequent years (p0.037). In conclusion, primary PCP remained a common AIDS defining illness often resulting in lengthy hospitlization. It ws associated with the failure of experienced physicians to prescnbe prophylaxis, of the prophylctic regimens temselves, and of patients to seek HIV testing before diseae p ession. It was nt associated with poor compliance with prescribd medications. A substantial lag time frmm the relesse of prophylactic guidelines to their impemntation wasu also obseved.</page><page sequence="83">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 801 486 AIDS Cl inical Trials Group (ACTG) Protocol 219: A Pediatric HIV Late Outcomes Protocol. JM OLESKE', MG FOWLER'*, M BRADY3, M CULNANE2, A RUBIN-HALE', L MOFENSON' FOR THE ACTG 219 PROTOCOL TEAM. 'UMDNJ Newark, NJ; 'NIH, Bethesda, MD; 'Childrens Hospital, Columbus, OH; 'Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA Background &amp; Objective: Strategies to reduce perinatal HIV transmission &amp; treat pediatric HIV disease require use of investigational therapies for which potential adverse late effects are unknown. ACTG Protocol 219 was designed to assess potential late effects of in utero exposure to anti-HIV therapies among seroreverting infants born to HIV+ women &amp; to track late outcomes, including improved survival and quality of life, among successive cohorts of infected children enrolled in ACTG trials. Results: Within the first year, 629 children from 49 sites were enrolled. The majority acquired infection perinatally (81%), and 81% were of minority race/ethnicity. 151 (24%) were enrolled from perinatal protocols. Data were available on 536 children regarding anti-HIV therapy and PCP prophylaxis; in the 12 mos prior to entry, &gt;90% had received anti-HIV therapy (42% blinded trial; 35% AZT alone; 11% ddI alone; 4% ddC alone, 6% combination therapy; 2% other) &amp; &gt;50% PCP prophylaxis (88% TMP/SMX; 7% dapsone, 6% other). Among infected children, the most common diagnoses within the 12 mos prior to entry were oral candidiasis in children 0-23 mos old, LIP in children 24-71 mos old &amp; pneumonia (not LIP) in children older than 6 yrs. As of 2/22/95, 1199 children have been enrolled, including 329 from perinatal protocols. Summary: With increasing use of AZT to reduce perinatal transmission &amp; increased survival among infected children, it is critical to evaluate potential late outcomes of investigational therapies. The large number of children enrolled in ACTG 219 should permit this evalua- tion in both infected and perinatally exposed children. 487 Follow-up of Single Positive or Indeterminate HIV Cultures Among Infants in a Multi-site Perinatal HIV Study. IC HANSON'*, J PITTb, K SHERRIEBC, E COOPERd, C DIAZ, H MENDEZ', K RICH', V SMERIGLIOh, A WILLOUGHBY', MG FOWLERh for The Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS). 'Baylor College of Medicine, Houston,TX,bColumbia-Presbyterian Hospital,New York,NY,'NERI, Watertown,MA,dBoston City Hospital,Boston, MA,'University of Puerto Rico,San Juan,PR,'State University of New York,Brooklyn,NY,'University of Illinois-Chicago,Chicago,lL and hNIH, Bethesda, MD. Among infants enrolled in WITS, a positive HIV culture is strong evidence of HIV infection (PPV &gt;98%) and is generally confirmed by repeatedly positive cultures or PCR. However, infants with a single positive or indeterminate HIV culture and all other negative viral detection assays present a diagnostic dilemma. By 15 months of age, 26/555 (4.7%) WITS infants had a single positive or indeterminate culture. We reviewed follow-up clinical and laboratory data on these WITS infants in order to assess their infection status. ACTG standards were used to perform and evaluate HIV cultures at all sites. Indeterminate quantitative culture definition was a single + well at any dilution. WITS infants are classified as HIV infected if they have two or more positive peripheral blood cultures; and HIV uninfected if they have all negative peripheral blood cultures (minimum of two) with both at &gt; one month of age and one at &gt; 6 months of age. Two reportedly + cultures were identified as data entry errors and reclassified as negative. Eleven of the remaining 24 infants had a single indeterminate quantitative culture. Thirteen infants had a single positive qualitative (n=4) or quantitative (n=9) culture. Available follow-up data for these 24 infants was that 18/24 had negative HIV serology and all had at least two negative cultures and/or PCRs. Based on these follow-up data through 15+ months of age, 20/24 infants were reclassified as uninfected. Followup data is incomplete on the remaining 4 infants. Review of WITS data suggests that a single positive qualitativel quantitative culture or indeterminate quantitative culture can occur in a small percentage of perinatally HIV exposed infants. In the face of additional negative viral detection assays, a single positive/indeterminate culture does not predict HIV infection. 488 Psychosocial Stress and Depression in Older Patients with HIV: Implications for Intervention N SINGH*, C SQUIER, C SIVEK, MM WAGENER, VL YU. Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA. In 1992, 81% of 47,095 reported AIDS cases were in persons &gt; 35 years of age; an increase of 55% compared to 1988. In an age related analysis, we prospectively assessed the demographic characteristics, psychosocial stress and disease outcome in 56 consecutive HIVinfected patients followed longitudinally. Depression was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory, emotional stress by Profile of Mood States scale, and coping by Ways of Coping scale 69% (38/56) of patients were &gt; 35 years of age. Older patients had longer duration of HIV seropositivity prior to study entry (1752 vs 1183 days, p=.03), were more likely to have intravenous drug use as HIV risk factor (P=.02), were less likely to be employed (18% vs 67%, p=.005) and more likely to use nontraditional HIV therapies (42% vs 6%, p=.005) than younger patients. Older patients exhibited significantly greater emotional and psychological stress, as measured by profile of mood states scale score (p=.004), had more anger/hostility (p=.03), more tension (p=.005), more fatigue (p=.003) and greater depression (p=.001). Profile of Mood State score &gt;42 has been considered indicative of significant mood disturbance, 61% of older vs 24% of younger patients had Profile of Mood State score &gt;42 (p=.01). Older patients also had a trend towards less social support (p=.15) less assertiveness (p=.15), poorer adaptive coping (p=.13) and earlier death after HIV diagnosis (1592 vs 2526 days, p = I11). There was no difference in compliance with antiretroviral therapy Psychosocial stress and depression are significantly more prevalent in patients with HIV &gt; 35 years old Our study suggests a need for intervention to address these special issues in older HIV infected patients. 489 Cytokines in Mouse Lungs During Toxoplasma gondii Pneumonia. G. A. FILICE*, C. POMEROY, C. R CLABOTS, and P. E. RICIPUTI. Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Progression of disease with some intracellular pathogens has been associated with dominance of Th2 CD4 lymphocytes. To determine if Th2 cells induce reactivation oftoxoplasma infection, we studied cyto- kine mRNAs during toxoplasma pneumonia in mice. C56 T. gondii were inoculated ip into 6 wk old BALB/c female mice which became system- ically ill and recovered with sulfadiazine therapy in 2 weeks. Infection spontaneously reactivated 4 weeks later, manifested primarily as pneu- monia. We also studied toxoplasma pneumonia resulting from immuno- suppression induced by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Broncho- alveolar lavage (BAL), whole lung, and splenocyte samples were collec- ted from the mice, RNA was extracted, and cDNAs were prepared with MMLV reverse transcriptase and then amplified by PCR. mRNAs were quantified by comparison with HPRT mRNA and by inclusion of competitor molecules with cytokine DNA containing 50-120 bp spacers. IL2 and tFNy transcripts increased in BAL cells as spontaneous reac- tivation pneumonia developed and as mice recovered indicating Thl- cytokine activity. IL4 and IL10 transcripts increased and decreased in parallel, suggesting concurrent Th2-cytokine activity. During the week after CMV inoculation, mice were systemically ill with CMV but lacked pneumonia. IL2, IFN-y, IL4 and IL10 transcripts were not detected in BAL cells during CMV disease. Toxoplasma pneumonia developed as mice recovered from CMV disease, peaked 1 week later (14 d after CMV inoculation), and then cleared. All four cytokine transcripts increased as toxoplasma pneumonia developed. Cytokine mRNA patterns in spleno- cytes differed temporally indicating that lung cytokine responses were compartmentalized. We concluded that Thl and Th2 cytokines were present concurrently in mouse lungs during toxoplasma pneumonia. 490 Differential Protective Efficacy of a Murine Monoclonal Antibody Versus Attenuated and Fully Virulent Strains of Francisella tularensis in a Lethal Murine Model of Tularemia. JJ DRABICK *, G SANDSTROM, AH FORTIER, I GOLOVLIOV. Walter Reed Army Inst. of Research, Washington, DC. University of Umea, Sweden and Entremed, Inc. Rockville, MD. Humoral immunity plays a role in protection against tularemia caused by strains of lesser virulence such as the LVS strain of F. tularensis (FT). We sought to determine if this protective efficacy extends to fully virulent wild type strains. We had prepared and characterized a murine IgM Mab against the lipopolysaccharide of FT. This Mab reacts fully with both attenuated and virulent strains as expected since there is only one serotype of FT. In a lethal murine model utilizing 5 animals per treatment group, 1 mg of Mab delivered ip 2 hours before challenge with varying innocula of LVS strain was fully protective against up to 80,000 organisms as compared to an isotype Mab control. In contrast, this same dose of Mab was unable to protect animals inoculated with as few as 2 organisms of the virulent strain. We conclude specific anti- lipopolysaccharide antibody (humoral immunity) is only protective against attenuated strains and that efforts to induce protection against fully virulent organsisms should focus on cellular immune mechanisms. 491 Sublethal Concentrations of Platelet Microbicidal Protein Reduce Candida albicans Interactions with Vascular Endothelial Cells In Vitro. MR YEAMAN, AS IBRAHIM, JA RITCHIE, SG FILLER, AS BAYER, JE EDWARDS, Jr., and MA GHANNOUM . Division of Infectious Diseases, St. John's Cardiovascular Research Center, Harbor-UCLA MC, Torrance, and UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA. We have previously demonstrated that thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tPMP) is fungicidal in vitro versus Candida albicans (CA). CA adherence to, germination upon, and resulting damage of vascular endothelial cells are believed to be crucial processes in the pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis. These sequential events likely facilitate transendothelial penetration and parenchymal invasion by CA. In the present study, we assessed the ability of sublethal tPMP concentrations to modulate CA germination, and CA adherence to and damage of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. CA strain ATCC 36082 is a well-characterized blood isolate. tPMP was purified from thrombin-stimulated rabbit platelet supematants by ion affinity adsorption. tPMP antifungal bioactivity was standardized by bioassay. tPMP alone exhibited no significant toxicity to HUVECs. As compared with control CA, exposure to 2.5 pg and 5 pg PMP/ml for 2h significantly reduced CA adherence to HUVECs and CA germination in vitro (Table 1; 'Ps0.05 in each case). Additionally, CA exposed to 5 pg PMP/ml for 2h damaged HUVECs significantly less as measured by "chromium release than did control CA, or CA exposed to 2.5 pg PMP/ml for 2h (Table 1;'P*0.05). Table 1. tPMP-induced % inhibition versus control (mean ? SD; n=3 experiments).

Moreover, since platelets attach to CA within the bloodstrea ththese data suggest a mechanism by which tPMP may limit the transendothelial penetration of CA and subsequent parenchymal tissue invasion. In addition, these collective results further substantiate the concept that PMPs may be important in host defense against pathogens which interact with vascular endothelium.</page><page sequence="84">802 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 492 Neonatal Type 14 Pneumococcal (Pnc) IgG Antibody (Aby) Predicts Early Onset Acute Otitis Media (AOM) in Infancy. J.C. Salazar,* K.A. Daly, M. Muggli, C. Liebeler, B. Lindgren, and G.S. Giebink. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Protection against Pnc disease is associated with aby against Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (PS). Low concentrations of maternally-derived serum anti-PS aby to common Pnc types combined with the known inability of infants to produce anti-PS aby may explain onset of AOM in the first six months of life. To explore this relationship, 627 mother-infant pairs were enrolled prenatally and followed through the infant's second birthday. Cord blood was obtained at birth for measurement of anti-PS IgG aby to type 14, the most common cause of Pnc AOM, using ELISA after absorbing sera with cell wall polysaccharide. Of the first 193 enrolled infants analyzed to date, 42% were diagnosed with AOM before the age of 6 mo, 53% were in day care, 21% had a sibling history of recurrent AOM, 70% were fully or partially breast fed, and 7.6% were exposed to cigarette smoke at home. Survival analysis revealed that children with cord blood aby in the lowest quartile (&lt; 0.5 gg IgG/ml) had their first AOM episode significantly earlier than those with cord blood aby in the higher three quartiles (Chi- square=9.67, p &lt; 0.007). These results suggest that newbors with low aby against a prevalent AOM Pnc serotype are at increased risk of AOM in the first six months of life. Cord blood anti-PS type 14 IgG &lt; 0.5 tLg IgG/ml may be a useful predictor of early onset AOM in infants. 493 Phagocytosis in Murine Macrophages is Inhibited by Brefeldin A. B.A. KRUSKAL*, E.S. SHAO, AND R.A.B. EZEKOWITZ. Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School Boston MA. The drug brefeldin A (BFA) perturbs several membrane trafficking pathways within eukaryotic cells, most notably within the Golgi apparatus where its target is the small G protein ARFI. BFA has been helpful in elucidating the mechanisms of membrane trafficking. We investigated the effect of BFA on phagocytosis of unopsonized Saccharomyces yeast, mediated by the mannose receptor (MR), and antibody-opsonized erythrocytes (EA), mediated by Fc receptors. BFA causes a dose-dependent inhibition of the uptake of both yeast and EA in both thioglycollate-elicted murine peritoneal macrophages or the J774E murine macrophage cell line. This inhibition is reversible upon removal of drug. Endocytosis of 125I-Mannose-BSA (an endocytic ligand for the MR) at 37? is not affected at all by concentrations of BFA which inhibit phagocytosis by 80-90%. Binding of unopsonized yeast at 4? was unaffected by BFA. Thus, the effect is not due to BFA modulation of cell surface receptor number. The dose of BFA necessary to inhibit phagocytosis is ten-fold higher than the dose which inhibits Golgi vesicle transport, suggesting that the molecular targets may be similar but are not identical. Brefeldin A may also be a useful reagent for examining the trafficking of vacuoles containing intracellular pathogens. 494 Specific Serum IgA Antibody as a Marker of Protection Against Natural Rotavirus (RV) Infection. F.R. VELAZQUEZ', D.O. MATSON2, J.J. CALVA', M.K. ESTES3, L.K. PICKERING2, and G.M. RUIZ-PALACIOS1*. 'National Institute of Nutrition, Mexico City, Mexico; 2Eastern Virginia Med. Sch., Norfolk, VA; 'Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. AIM: To evaluate the association of serum anti-RV IgA and IgG antibodies with protection against RV infection (RVI), RV-diarrhea (RVD), or moderate-to-severe RV-diarrhea (RVMSD). METHODS: 200 Mexican children were monitored from birth to 2 years of age by weekly home visits. Diarrhea severity was assessed by a 20-point grading system. Stools collected at each visit and during diarrhea episodes were tested for RV by EIA. Sera collected during the first week after birth and every 4 months were titered for anti-RV IgA and IgG antibodies by EIA. RESULTS: 316 RVIs were detected, 56% by excretion and 77% by seroresponse. When adjusted for age and confounders IgA titers of s1:800 increased the risk of RVI (RR=5.0; 95%CI=3.1-8.3) and RVD (RR=10.8; 95%CI=2.7-43.6). Complete protection against RVMSD occurred with an IgA titer of &gt;1:800. IgG titers of sl:900 were associated with an increased risk of RVI (RR=2.3; 95%CI=1.8-2.8) and RVD (RR=2.8; 95%CI=1.7-4.7). No evident protection against RVMSD occurred with an IgG titer of &gt;1:900 (RR=1.9; 95%CI=0.7-4.7). A mean IgA titer of &gt;1:800 and IgG titer of &gt;1:900 was reached after 2 and 3 RVIs, respectively (range 0-5 infections/child; P&lt;.001), regardless of whether these RVIs were symptomatic or asymptomatic (P&lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti- RV IgA was a better marker for protection against RVI, RVD and RVMSD than anti-RV IgG. Two consecutive symptomatic or asymptomatic RVls were required to achieve an IgA titer of &gt;1:800, which corresponded with complete protection against RVMSD. 495 Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF, Filgrastim) Treatment Induces Murine Neutrophils and Macrophages to Inhibit Growth of Mycobacterium aviwn (MAC). L. E. BERMUDEZ*, M. PETROFSKY, L.S. YOUNG, and P. STEVENSt. Kuzell Institute, San Francisco and Amgent, Thousand Oaks, CA. MAC is the most common bacterial infection in AIDS. The host defense against MAC is not well understood but macrophages play a key role. In addition, recent studies have shown the potential role of neutrophils (PMN) in host immune response against intracellular facultative bacteria. Since G-CSF is a cytokine that induces the growth and stimulates the activity of PMN, we investigated the efficacy of G-CSF to augment the activity of PMN toward MAC. G-CSF was administered to Balb/c and C57B1/6 mice s.c. at doses of 100, 500, and 1000 jLg/kg/day for 3 days. On day 4, we obtained peripheral blood PMN and splenic macrophages (M0) and determined the oxidative activity of PMN and M0 by (1) whole blood PMN-luminol- chemiluminescence (CL) and (2) M0 and PMN superoxide anion (02-) production as assayed by SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome-C. We also infected PMN and M0 ex-vivo with MAC strain 101 (serovar 1) and determined inhibition of MAC intracellular growth after 4h and 4 days, respectively. PMN and M0 from G-CSF treated mice, stimulated with PMA, released significantly greater amounts of 02- in a dose dependent manner and PMN-CL was increased greater then 3-fold when compared with controls. PMN from both Balb/c and C57BV6 mice receiving 1000 jg/kg inhibited MAC growth by 64 ? 7% and 90 + 3% compared to controls. Inhibition of 63 ? 7% was observed when C57BV6 mice received 500 tg/kg/day. Splenic macrophages from Balb/c mice receiving G-CSF had no significant effect on intracellular MAC, whereas treatment of C57B/6 mice with 1000 l g/kg/day resulted in 75 ? 5% inhibition of growth. In summary, administration of G-CSF induced a mycobacteriostatic activity of PMN and M0 ex vivo. Antimycobacterial activity of PMN may provide an additional mechanism for host defense against MAC. 496 Pentoxiphylline Neutralizes the Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a)-Associated Killing in Whole Human Blood (WB) of a Serum-Resistant E. coli. K.R. Damerau, D.V. Alcid, J. Fune, and S.E. Boruchoff.* UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ. TNF-a is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which plays a major role in the induction of septic shock in humans. The induction of TNF-a in response to bacterial endotoxin is inhibited by the effects of Pentoxiphylline on TNF-a mRNA accumulation and efficiency of translation. We have previously shown that TNF- a inhibits the killing of a serum-resistant E. coil by WB (ICAAC 1993, abstract 708). This effect is only apparent after 3 hours of incubation, and is TNF-a-concentration dependent, with a maximal decrease in killing (approximately 0.5 log CFU/ml change) shown with 100 ng/ml final concentration of TNF-a. Addition of Pentoxiphylline (100 ug/ml) and/or methylprednisolone (100 gg/ml) significantly reduced the expected decrease in killing caused by TNF-a. Addition of Pentoxiphylline to control cultures (without TNF-a) led to an increased rate of killing of E. coli, possibly due to inhibition of endogenously produced TNF-a by leukocytes present in whole blood. These experiments again show that standard 60 minute kill-curves are not sufficient to demonstrate effects of cytokines on killing of bacteria, since cytokines work by inducing changes in WBCs, not by direct effects on bacteria. It is possible that Pentoxiphylline may benefit bacteremic patients by allowing more rapid killing and clearance of gram- negative organisms. 497 Simultaneous Measurement of Free Calcium and Hydrogen ions, and Shape and Motility of PMNL Populations.* A.M. Fiskin, E. Goldstein, K. Mowery, S. Morris, J. Gauch and T. Nguyen. Kansas University Medical Center, K.C., KS, and University of Missouri, K.C., MO. Studies using computer- assisted image analysis of motility in PMNL populations showed that trauma or disease decreases responses of the phagocytes to peptide attractants like FMetLeuPhe (FMLP). Recently the changes in shape of single moving PMNL have been correlated with changes in subcellular free calcium and hydrogen ions. To study such changes for groups of PMNL we simultaneously measured subcellular free calcium and hydrogen ions, shape and motility, at video-frame rates. Sets of 40X objective, epifluorescence images of groups of human PMNL responding to a FMLP gradient were recorded as Optical-Memory-Disc-Records, each averaged over 16 frames, at intervals of 1/2-2 sec for durations of 30-200 sec. Free calcium and pH levels were followed by diffusion loading with the ratio dyes Indo-1 and Snarf-1. The intensified four-channel images recorded simultaneously allow pixel-by-pixel ratio determinations, from which pH and pH- corrected calcium concentrations were computed off- line. The data is presented as indices of shape, velocity, and per cent changes in free calcium and hydrogen ions, vs. time, for each cell; and the McCutcheon Index is computed with other measures of motility for each group followed. Coupled changes in total free hydrogen and calcium ions are shown to preceed the shape changes which predict acceleration in cells studied. Our simultaneous measures of Calcium and hydrogen ions of PMNL in groups, and of regions within the moving cells, should allow assessment of mediators of PMNL function in disease states.</page><page sequence="85">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1994 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 803 498 Exposure of Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (PMNLs) to Influenza A Virus (IAV) Alters the Plasma Membrane and Intracellular Distribution of Several Trimeric and Monomeric G-Proteins. Jon S. Abramson and Holly R. Hudnor. Dept. of Pediatrics, Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, N.C. IAV-induced PMNL dysfunction causes bacterial superinfections that lead to most virus-induced deaths. We previously showed that IAV- induced PMNL dysfunctions is associated with inhibition of GTPase activity and decreased association of several trimeric (Gi2 and Gq, but not Gi3 and Gs) and monomeric (raplA, but not rac) G-proteins with PMNL plasma membranes. These G-proteins help regulate various activation pathways that IAV alters in response to a variety of stimuli. The present study explored whether the decreased amount of these G- proteins on the plasma membrane is associated with increased amounts of the IAV-affected G-proteins in intracellular compartments, since such a finding would suggest that IAV alters the binding of G-proteins to the plasma membrane. The amount of IAV-altered trimeric and monomeric G-proteins found in membrane, cytosol and lysosomal fractions was examined in PMNLs exposed to IAV or buffer for 30 min. Immunoblotting studies showed that IAV decreased membrane binding of Gi2 (33% ? 10) is associated with a corresponding increase of this G-protein in the cytosol (42% ? 11) as analyzed by scanning densitometry; no difference in the amount of Gi2 in the lysosomes was noted between IAV and buffer- treated cells. Preliminary studies with Gq show that it is decreased by 46% on the plasma membrane of IAV-infected PMNLs and increased by 55% in the lysosomal fraction; no Gq was detected in the cytosol in IAV or buffer-treated cells. RaplA is decreased by 35% ? 4 in IAV-treated cells, and increased by 27% ? 6 in the cytosol fraction; no raplA was detected in lysosomes). These membrane and intracellular differences were significant for Gi2 and raplA (p&lt;.03); to date only 2 experiments have been done with Gq. These data suggest that decreased binding of monomeric and trimeric G-proteins to the PMNL membrane is important in the pathogenesis of IAV-induced PMNL dysfunction. 499 Intracellular Growth of Virulent M. tuberculosis is Unaffected by the Receptor Used for Macrophage Entry. S. ZIMMERLI and J.D. ERNST*, San Francisco General Hospital; University of California, San Francisco. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evades killing by macrophages through an unknown mechanism. One possible means of avoiding killing is to gain entry to macrophages by binding to receptors that are not coupled to signalling pathways that activate microbial killing mechanisms. We used combinations of blocking monoclonal antibodies to CR1 and CR3/4, and a competitive inhibitor of the macrophage mannose receptor (MR) to examine the fate of Mtb that enter human macrophages (M0) by specific, selected receptors. Each of the blocking reagents reduced the number of cell-associated Mtb, and combinations had additive effects. When evaluated as total (by AFB staining and microscopy) and viable (by quantitative culture) Mtb 1 h after initiating infection, there was no evidence that any Mtb were killed, regardless of the receptor that mediated initial contact and entry. AFB staining and quantitative cultures after 3 and 6 days of infection revealed that the intracellular growth rates of Mtb that entered by various receptors were indistinguishable. These studies confirm that CR1, CR3/4, and the mannose receptor are all important routes of entry of virulent Mtb into human M0. They also demonstrate that there is no apparent advantage for Mtb to selectively avoid one or more receptor types on M0. We conclude that the mechanism whereby Mtb survives within M0 operates at a step that is common to all routes of entry. 500 PuEUmLOSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA (PCP) AND IIMUNODEFICIENCY IN ASSOCIATION WITH NOONON SYNDROME. J. Cervia* and S. Cuningham-Rundles, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY. Noonan Syndrome is a hereditary disorder characterized by short stature, webbed neck, pectus excavatum or carinatum, cubitun valgum, congenital heart disease and a characteristic facies. Immune deficiency has not been previously described in association with this syndrome. We studied two girls with Noonan syndrome (ages 5 months and 3 years) who presented to our institution within one year with respiratory failure attributable to bronchoscopically proven PCP. Both were treated with trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole and recovered completely. Both patients were HIV-seronegative, and neither had been previously diagnosed with immune deficiency. Neither had received any imnunosuppressive therapy. The younger child was found to have reduced C04 + T-Cells (Absolute Cp4=369, 13%), which subsequently increased to 2794 (42%) by 14 months after the episode of PCP. The older child had intact CD4 + T-cells (Absolute CD4= 2850, 50%), but absent natural killer (NK) cell activity and low NK cell number. NK studies on the first child are pending. Although immune deficiency has not been previously been described in Noonan syndrome, the development of PCP in these cases suggests a possible association. Immune deficiency could be 1) primary, 2) reflecting developmental delay or 3) related to sequestration of immune cells. These mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive; and, each warrants further investigation. 501 Differential Effects of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors on TNF and Nitric Oxide Production by Murine Macrophages. SO ORLICEK, E MEALS, J KAUR, and BK ENGLISH, Crippled Children's Foundation Research Center, Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center; Department of Pediatrics, the University of Tennessee, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers "macrophage activation" and the production of key inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitric oxide (NO). We (English, et. al., J. Exp. Med. 178: 1017, 1993) and others have shown that protein tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for macrophage activation. We have shown that inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, including herbimycin A and genistein, block the production of both TNF and NO by murine macrophages. In these studies, we compared the temporal requirements for tyrosine phosphorylation in the induction of TNF and the key enzyme regulating NO production, the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in the murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Preincubation of RAW 264.7 cells with herbimycin A (1-5 Igg/ml) or genistein (25-50 pM) blocked LPS-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited the production of TNF and iNOS by more than 90% upon exposure of these cells to LPS 10 ng/ml and IFNy 10 U/ml. Unlike herbimycin A or genistein, three recently characterized members of the tyrphostin class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (AG 126, 1288, and 1290) failed to block either TNF or iNOS production by RAW264.7 cells. Interestingly, the addition of either genistein or herbimycin A to RAW 264.7 cell cultures 1-4 hours after stimulation with LPS and IFNyhad little or no effect on TNF production, but markedly (25- 75%) inhibited iNOS protein accumulation. Together these data confirm the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the upregu- lation of both TNF and iNOS by LPS, but indicate that tyrosine kinase inhibitors block iNOS production at a point well downstream of the initial wave of LPS-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. 502 The Development of ADCC-Mediating Antibodies in HIV-1 Infected Children. D. PUGATCH('), K. LUZURIAGA, and J.L. SULLIVAN, For The WITS Study Group. Program In Molecular Medicine, University Of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA. We have characterized ADCC antibodies present within 48 hours of birth in 22 HIV-1 intrapartum infected and uninfected infants. In addition, we have measured the sequential development of ADCC antibody responses over the first two years of life in infants infected with HIV-1 in the intrapartum period. Patient sera were tested in a standard ADCC assay using Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line targets infected with vaccinia virus vectors expressing envelope glycoprotein of clade B and E viruses. Effector cells were obtained from a small pool of normal donors screened for ADCC effector function. At birth, ADCC antibodies which mediate lysis of target cells expressing HIV-1 III-B envelope glycoprotein were detected in 19 of 22 infants. ADCC titers ranged from 10-2.5 to 10-5.5. Mean ADCC titers at birth were not different between infected (10-4.00) and uninfected (10-4.04) infants (p&gt;0.5). ADCC antibodies at birth showed group specificity, mediating lysis of several clade B envelope targets as well as a clade E envelope target. No significant correlation between ADCC titer at birth and subsequent disease progression has been found. All infants lost detectable ADCC antibody by 12 months. Infected infants without detectable ADCC antibody maintained gp-120 and gp-41antibodies as measured by western blot assay. 5 of 8 infected infants developed ADCC antibodies at 24 months of age. Uninfected infants remained ADCC antibody negative. In conclusion, HIV-1 specific ADCC antibodies are passively transfered from mother to infant and do not protect against intrapartum HIV-1 transmission. Group specific ADCC antibodies present at birth do not appear to play a role in disease progression. The ontogeny of the HIV-1 ADCC antibody response appears to be delayed in infancy. 503 G-CSF Receptor Isoform Expression During Human Neutrophil Development. S. M. WHITE* and D. J. TWEARDY, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA. G-CSF is critical for the production and activation of neutrophilic granulocytes and is the agent of choice for prophylaxis against chemotherapy -induced neutropenia. G-CSF acts by ligand induced dimerization of its receptor (G-CSFR). In humans, four G-CSFR isoforms have been identified (classes I - IV) which differ in their transmembrane and/or intracytoplasmic domains. Functional studies have demonstrated that the class I isoform transduces both proliferative and maturational signals in myeloid cells, whereas the class IV isoform is only capable of transducing a proliferative signal and is differentiation-defective. Expression of the G-CSFR isoform repertoire during neutrophil development has not been studied. We examined the relative isoform expression of mature neutrophils and immature myeloid leukemic cell lines using a semi-quantitative reverse transcription / polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique with an amplimer pair which amplifies distinctly sized fragments from each isoform. Neutrophils expressed predominantly the class I isoform and low levels of class IV isoform with a class IV/class I ratio for 21 neutrophil samples of 0.44 +0.03. No class II or class III isoform was detected. In contrast, human myeloid cell lines KG- 1, AML-193, NB4, HL60, EM2, and EM3 all expressed increased amounts of the differentiation-defective class IV isoform with class IV/class I ratios of 0.50 - 0.81 (? 0.03 - 0.11, p = 0.001 - 0.044). To determine whether this difference was due to the developmental stage of the myeloid cell lines or to their leukemic origin, we examined a population enriched for normal immature myeloid cells, CD34+ bone marrow cells. The isoform repertoire for ten CD34+ cell samples was similar to mature neutrophil( 0.42 + 0.03, p = 0.11). Therefore, expression of the G-CSFR isoforms is not developmentally regulated, rather the increased expression of the differentiation-defective class IV isoform in myeloid leukemia cell lines is an aberrant event that may contribute to leukemogenesis.</page><page sequence="86">804 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 504 Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) is a Critical Mediator of Septic Shock. T. CALANDRA*, L.A. SPIEGEL, C.N. METZ, J. BERNHAGEN and R. BUCALA. The Picower Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY The cytokine MIF, originally discovered to be a T lymphocyte- derived factor, was recently identified to be a pro-inflammatory pituitary and monocyte/macrophage cytokine and an important mediator of endotoxic shock (Nature 1993;365:756; J Exp Med 1994;179:1895). Since Gram-positive bacteria (especially S. aureus, and group A and viridans streptococci ) are a frequent cause of severe infections, we examined the effects of two Gram-positive exotoxins, the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST 1) and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA), on MIF secretion by murine macrophages. TSST 1 and SPEA were found to be potent inducers of MIF secretion by RAW 264.7 or elicited peritoneal macrophages. Dose-response studies of TSST 1 and SPEA induced MIF secretion in vitro showed that MIF secretion occurred at very low toxin concentrations. TSST 1-induced MIF secretion was bimodal: the first peak occurred at 10 pg/ml and the second at 10-4 pglml. SPEA-induced MIF secretion was found to peak at 10 pg/ml. To investigate whether MIF was an important mediator of the toxic shock syndrome in vivo, we evaluated the effect of anti-MIF antibodies in a mouse model. D-galactosamine-sensitized BALBIc mice were injected i.p. with 200 lI of either polyclonal rabbit anti-MIF serum or normal rabbit serum (controls) followed 2 hr later by a lethal i.p. injection of 7.5 pg of TSST-1. Anti-MIF antiserum markedly increased survival from 17% (controls) to 74% (p=0.002). Taken together with the observation that MIF counter- regulates the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids and is an important mediator of lethal endotoxemia, these data implicate MIF as a critical cytokine of the host responses to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections and septic shock. 505 Cord Blood Monocytes Do Not Spread as Well as Adult Monocytes After Stimulation with Group B Streptococci. 1. L. ROWEN*, M. S. EDWARDS, and C. W. SMITH. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston TX. Neonatal monocytes are deficient in many respects when compared to adult monocytes, which may contribute to the neonate's enhanced susceptibility to infection. We have previously shown that neonates release diminished quantities of chemoattractants, specifically leukotriene B4 and interleukin 8, when stimulated with group B streptococci (GBS). As release of inflammatory mediators is often enhanced following cell adhesion, we sought to determine whether GBS induce monocyte spreading and to compare the spreading of neonatal and adult monocytes. Cord and adult blood monocytes were separated by density centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque and allowed to adhere (106 /ml) to plastic in serum-free media. After removal of nonadherent cells, the cells were stimulated with type III GBS (10' CFU/ml). Unstimulated cells served as controls. Following 4h in a 5% C02 incubator, the media was removed and the cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde. Video images were obtained and area morphometry (calibrated in pm) was analyzed using the OPTIMAS 4.1 (Bioscan, Edmonds WA) software package. Additionally, the number of cells spreading (phase dark) versus rounded (phase light) was determined.

Although similar numbers of nconatal monocytes spread, they did not spread to the same degree as adult monocytes. This failure to maximize surface area may contribute to the neonate's reduced production of chemoattractants, and thus impair the inflammatory response. The relationship between cell spreading and mediator production deserves further investigation. 506 Granulocyte Function in Women with Diabetes Mellitus and Bacteriuria. D Balasoiu, KPM van Kessel, HJ van Kats-Renaud, JT Collet &amp; IM Hoepelman. Dept of Medicine and Eijkman-Winkler Institute for Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Utrecht, the Netherlands. Introduction: The prevalence of bacteriuria in women with DM is increased. Based on old studies it is stated in the literature that this increased prevalence is due, among others, to impaired granulocyte (PMN) function. Since neutropenic- and other patients with Impaired PMN function are not at increased risk for bacteriuria this seemed an unlikely explanation to us. Aim: To compare PMN function in women with DM with/without bacteriuria in comparison to healthy controls. Methods: All diabetic women (64) attending our outpatient clinic were screened for bacteriuria by culture. Thereafter 10 patients with and 10 without bacteriuria were selected for PMN function testing (FT). Results: The overall prevalence of bacteriuria was 34%. Of the 10 patients with bacteriuria selected for FT, 5 had a second culture positive with the same mo. (a 105CFU/ml)=TB, in 4 patients the second culture was negative and one was cultured only once.

JN. Krieger, RW. Coombs, C Muller, SO Ross, C Speck, T Hooton and L Corey, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Background. Semen contains numerous leukocytes that might be important for HIV transmission, as a host defense against HIV, or both. Purpose. We describe a microassay for CD4+ and CD8+ leukocytes in semen and compare findings to counts of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in peripheral blood. Methods. Semen and blood were obtained from 25 HIV seropositive men and from 10 controls. Within 2 h semen aliquots (0.1 mL) were washed, dried onto Teflon-coated slides, acetone-fixed, then incubated with monoclonal antibodies HLe-1, Leu-2a, and Leu3a+3b, against leukocyte antigens CD45, CD8, and CD4, respectively. Following incubation with alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase, and counter staining in hematoxylin, T-cells were counted at 400x. Results. Semen Leukocytes (+ SD) xl0^3/ejaculate Population CD4+ CD8+ Control Donors (n=2) 0,266 366,0 Infertile (n=8) 1292 + 2212 1206 + 2658 HIV-Pos (n=25) 271 + 346 448 +768 Ten-fold differences in individual's seminal counts of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were noted among five men who provided multiple specimens. There was no correlation between cell counts in semen and in blood but the number of samples was small. Conclusions. In our population, seropositive men had minimal seminal inflammation. Counts of seminal CD4+ and CD8+ cells varied widely between men with similar CD4+ cell counts in peripheral blood, and in individual men at different times. The cellular immune response in semen may differ substantially from systemic cellular immunity. 508 Accelerated Neutrophil (PMNL) Apoptosis in AIDS: Partial Reversal with r-met-HuG-CSF. DL PITRAK*, SH SUTTON, HC TSAI, KM MULLANE, AK PAU, and P STEVENS; U. of Illinois, West Side VA, Chgo, IL; Amgen, Inc., CA. PMNL apoptosis is accelerated in AIDS. This may contribute to the increased risk of secondary infections, as apoptotic PMNL are functionally impaired. This study examined the effect of r-met-HuG-CSF (filgrastim) administration on PMNL apoptosis in patients with AIDS. Six AIDS patients (CD4+&lt;200/mm3) received filgrastim 300 p.g SC qOD X 4 doses, and 13 volunteers without HIV risk factors served as controls. Blood samples were collected before, during, and after therapy. PMNL were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and lysis of red cells with NH4CI. PMNL were cultured in RPMI with L-glutamine plus 10% FCS at 37? C in 5% CO2. PMNL were then stained with acridine orange and ethidium bromide at 0?, 3?, 6?, and 18?, and apoptosis and viability were determined by fluorescent microscopy. Apoptosis was minimal at 0?, but PMNL from AIDS patients before filgrastim exhibited significantly greater apoptosis than controls at 3?, 6?, and 18? (p&lt;.05, t test). Filgrastim reduced apoptosis, and the differe;;ce between pre-therapy and on-therapy values was statistically significant at 18? (mean difference=-30.4+15.85 %, p=0.01, paired t test). Percent Apoptosis 0? 3? 6? 18?

Cytokine therapy may be potentially useful for therapy and/or prevention of secondary infections in AIDS patients. 509 Restoration of In Vitro Immune Function by IL-12 and anti-IL10 In Patients with HIV Infection: Implications for Immune Based Therapy. F. HASHEMI*, M. CLERICI, H. KESSLER, A. LANDAY, B. SHA, J.BERZOFSKY, G. M. SHEARER. Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL, and National Cancer Institute, Bethesda MD. IL-12 has been associated with upregulation of Thl type cellular immune responses and IL-10 with down regulation. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of IL-12 and anti-IL-10 on restoration of T-helper cell function as measured by proliferative responses to antigens (influenza [FLU] or HIV envelope peptides [PEP]), alloantigens (ALLO), and PHA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 35 patients in various stages of HIV infection. 11 of 35 patients had AIDS based upon an AIDS-defining opportunistic disease. A stimulation index &gt;3 was considered a positive proliferative response. Patients were classified as responders if they demonstrated a positive proliferative response following the addition of IL-12 or anti-IL-10 (IL-12/anti-10). Mean CD4 counts were determined for those patients classified as responders versus nonresponders. 32 of 35 patients were on antiretroviral therapy. Positive proliferative responses to FLU increased from 11/35 to 24/35 patients following addition of IL-12/anti-10. Of the 24 responders only 4 had AIDS as compared to 7 of 11 nonresponders. Mean CD4 cell counts of FLU responders was 341/1l compared to 94/pl for nonresponders. PEP proliferative responses increased from 2/35 to 11/35 following addition of IL-12/anti-10. None of the 11 responders had a diagnosis of AIDS whereas 11 of 24 nonresponders had AIDS. Mean CD4 cell counts of PEP responders versus nonresponders was 388//l and 207/al respectively. ALLO responses were seen in 26/35 patients before and 29/35 after addition of IL-12/anti-10. Mean CD4 cell counts of ALLO responders versus nonresponders was 278 and 172 /ll respectively. PHA responses were seen in all patients both before and after IL-12/anti-10 treatment. Restoration of in vitro T-helper function by IL-12 or anti-IL-10 to recall antigens in patients with HIV infection is associated with both the clinical stage of disease and CD4 count. This suggests that immune based therapy may be most effective in patients with more preserved immune function.</page><page sequence="87">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 805 510 Respiratory Syncytial (RS) Virus-Specific CTL Response and its Correlation to In Vitro IFN-y Production. C. CORVAISIER*, I.N. MBAUWUIKE, and P.A. PIEDRA. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Cell mediated immunity may contribute to both the pathogenesis and immunity of RS virus infection. A study was begun in the fall of 1992 to determine the immune correlates of primary and subsequent infection with RSV in infants and children. In this abstract, we describe the development of a virus-specific CTL assay using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and compare the production of interferon- y (IFN-y) in PBL with varying CTL responses. Fresh PBL from adults, used as effector cells, were infected with RS virus at a various multiplicity of infection and incubated for 8 days at 37'C with 5%/CO2. Autologous targets cells consisted of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts, Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) and frozen PBL. Spontaneous lysis of PHA blasts and B-LCL were high (31% to 45%). These target cells, when infected with either influenza virus or RS virus, were lysed to the same extent by RS virus-stimulated effector cells, implying they were killed in a non-specific way. On the other hand, frozen PBL target cells were lysed in a virus specific manner. There was no or low (&lt;5%) lysis by influenza- stimulated or unstimulated effector cells. The CTL activity was MHC-class I restricted; depletion of CD8 cells abolished CTL response. Presented below is the CTL and IFN-y data. No CTL Indeterminate CTL Positive CTL (0%-4%) (n = 3) (5/%-9%) (n = 3) (&gt;10%) (n = 9) CTL response (%) 3.5 ? .6 7.6 ? 1.25 15.4 ? 3.05 IFN-y (pg/ml) 635.9 ? 285.5 1793.3 ? 456.8 4036.8 ? 2598.3 A CTL response of 10% or more is considered positive. A Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison demonstrated significant differences between groups for CTL and IFN-y activities (p=0.05). A trend toward a correlation was observed between CTL activity and IFN-y production (r = 0.498 : p = 0.058). Thus the development of the RS virus CTL assay can be used to evaluate the role of the cellular immune response in primary and subsequent RS virus infections in infants and children. 511 Antibodies to both the Fusion (F) and Hemagglutinin (H) Proteins of Measles Direct Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). D.N. FORTHAL'1, G. LANDUCCI', P. ROTA2, J.G. TILLES1. 'Univ. of California, Irvine College of Medicine, Orange, CA; 2Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. Antibodies to the F and H proteins of measles are capable of neutralizing measles infectivity. The protein- specificity of antibodies which lyse measles-infected cells, however, is not known. In this study, we used vaccinia constructs encoding measles proteins to determine if antibodies to F or H could mediate ADCC. EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells were infected with wild-type vaccinia or with vaccinia encoding either F or H and used as targets in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay. PBMCs from a healthy individual were used as effectors. ADCC-specific cytotoxicity was measured in serial dilutions of sera from 5 vaccinia-seronegative patients with acute measles and 6 healthy, measles-seropositive, vaccinia-seronegative subjects. All sera resulted in ADCC-specific lysis with both the vaccinia-F and vaccinia-H constructs, and individual sera had similar ADCC antibody titers against both constructs. No sera lysed cells infected with wild-type vaccinia. A marked prozone effect was noted, particularly with vaccinia-F, whereby higher concentrations of sera resulted in less cytotoxicity than lower concentrations. We conclude that antibodies against both the F and H proteins of measles mediate ADCC. 512 Human CD4+ and CD8+ T Lymphocytes Lyse Toxoplasma gondii Infected Cells in a MHC Non-restricted Manner. 1,2,3J.G.

SUBAUSTE. 1Stanford University School of Medicine, 2Palo Alto Medical Foundation, 3Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Palo Alto and 4Applied Immune Sciences, Inc., Santa Clara, CA Cell mediated immunity plays a critical role in host resistance against Toxoplasma gondii. T cell lines and clones have been used to characterize functional activity of T lymphocyte subsets in humans infected with T. gondii. Studies to determine if T. gondii specific human T cells lyse parasite-infected cells have yielded conflicting results. Attempts to obtain human cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes have been complicated due to lack of a reproducible system for their generation. By using paraformaldehyde fixed T. gondii-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we reproducibly generated T. gondii-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell lines. Six T. gondii specific T cell lines were studied from an individual chronically infected with T. gondii. During the first 3 weeks of stimulation cytofluorometric analysis of these lines revealed: &gt;99% CD3+, 85-95% CD3+ ap+ TCR, 5-9% CD3+ y6+ TCR, 50-70% CD4+ and 20-40% CD8+; between 5 and 11 weeks: &gt;99% CD3+, &gt;99% CD3+ ap+ TCR, &lt;1% CD3+ y6+ TCR, 20-40% CD4+ and 60-80% CD8+. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines had remarkable cytotoxic activity against T. gondii- infected target cells (30-50% specific cromium release at effector:target ratio (ETR) of 30:1) but not against uninfected target cells (&lt;10% at ETR of 30:1). Cytotoxic activity by the whole T cell lines was not T. gondii strain specific. Whole T cell lines were cytotoxic for target cells infected with the C56 and ME49 strains and RH strain (which was used to infect PBMC). The T. gondii-specific T cell lines displayed significant and specific cytotoxic activity against T. gondii-infected targets in the absence of MHC class I or II restriction. Antigen specific non-MHC restricted CTL activity by both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes could play a role in the response of humans to infection with T. gondii. 513 IL-I p is required for IL-12 mediated, T cell independent resistance to Toxoplasma gondii. 'HUNTER, C.A.*, 2VAN CLEAVE, V., 3CHIZZONITE, R. AND 'REMINGTON J.S. Stanford University and Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute. 2Genetics Institute, Boston. 3Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley. Mice with the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) possess an IFN-y dependent mechanism of resistance to T. gondii (and Listeria monocytogenes) that relies on the ability of IL-12 to stimulate production of IFN-y by NK cells. In the studies described below we present data which demonstrate a critical role for IL-l in the ability of IL-12 to stimulate production of IFN-y by NK cells. Stimulation of SCID splenocytes with T. gondii or L. monocytogenes resulted in production of IFN-y by NK cells. Addition of neutralizing antibodies to IL- 113, but not IL- l , to these cultures completely inhibited the production of IFN-y. Furthermore, antibody specific for the type I IL-1 receptor, but not the type II IL-1 receptor, antagonized the ability of T. gondii or L. monocytogenes to stimulate production of IFN-yby SCID splenocytes. Stimulation of SCID splenocytes with IL- la or IL- 11p alone did not stimulate production of IFN-y but these cytokines synergised with IL-12 to stimulate production of high levels of IFN-y. Low concentrations of IL- 13 were detected in cultures of SCID splenocytes stimulated with T. gondii or IL-12 plus TNF- a. Addition of neutralizing antibodies specific for IL- 10 or TGF-1 did not affect the levels of IL- 1 detected in these cultures. However, addition of anti-IFN-y resulted in a 5 fold increase in levels of IL-I 1 . In vivo studies demonstrated that administration of antibody specific for the type I IL- I receptor antagonized the ability of IL-12 to delay time to death of SCID mice infected with T. gondii. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for IL- 1p in the ability of IL-12 to stimulate production of IFN-y by NK cells and offers a possible mechanism for the protective effect of IL- 1 in resistance to intracellular pathogens. 514 Impaired neutrophil function against Haemophilus influenzae type b in children with AIDS. G. MARTINEZ, N. GONZALEZ, J.I. SANTOS Hospital Infantil de Mexico, Mexico City. INTRODUCTION: Humoral immune abnormalities and HIV related neutropenia have been implicated in the increased risk for serious bacterial infections by encapsulated bacteria, including H. influenzae b ( Hib ), in children with AIDS. However, few studies have evaluated the functional integrity of neutrophils (PMNL) in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the in-vitro phagocytic respiratory burst by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) and the bactericidal capacity of PMNL from 10 children with AIDS and 10 age matched controls. All patients had &lt; 15% CD4, but no clinical evidence of acute infection. Hib (ATCC 33533) in log phase growth were washed and adjusted in HBSS at a target-effector of 200:1 for CL assay and 20:1 for the bactericidal assay. Bacteria were opsonized with 10% of different serum conditions. Human hypogammaglobulenemic serum; Hib hyperimmune serum; and autologous serum, respectively. RESULTS: The peak of CL activity (X + SEM mV) for PMNL challenged with Hib opsonized with hypogammaglobulenemic serum was 25.33 + 7.87 mV for children with AIDS vs 53.5 + 6.64 mV for Controls p&lt;0.01. Moreover, when either hyperimmune AB serum or autologous serum was used as the opsonin. PMNL from children with AIDS only increased their CL response to 54.64 + 10.82 and 52.14 + 12.25 versus 139.73 + 7.08 and 138.45 + 15.98 for controls: p&lt;0.0002 and p&lt;0.0025, respectively. Significantly lower bactericidal activits was also observed for PMNL from children with AIDS, independent of opsonization conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that PMNL from children with AIDS have a defect in their phagocytic respiratory burst and bactericidal capacity against Hib in vitro, compared with PMNL from healthy controls and suggest that this defect is pnmarily due to intrinsic alterations in PMNL function. 515 Resistance of the Intestine to Oral Infection with Toxoplasma gondii Is under Genetic Control. 10. LIESENFELD*, 2j. KOSEK, IJ.S. REMINGTON, and Iy. SUZUKI. 1,2 Stanford University Medical Center, Ipalo Alto Medical Foundation, and 2VA Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA. The pathogenesis of acute toxoplasmosis following peroral infection, the natural route of infection, is unclear. Resistance of inbred strains of mice following peroral infection does not correlate with that following intraperitoneal infection. In the present study, following peroral infection, we compared histological changes in various organs between C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice which are genetically susceptible and resistant against peroral infection, respectively. Mice were infected perorally with 100 cysts of the ME49 strain of T. gondii. C57BL/6 mice all died between day 7 and day 13 after infection, whereas BALB/c mice all survived. Histological studies were performed in various organs at 3, 5, and 7 days after infection. Whereas inflammatory changes in the brains, lungs, hearts, spleens, and large intestines did not differ between the two strains of mice at each of the time points, marked inflammatory changes were present in the small intestines of C57BL/6 but not BALB/c mice on day 7 after infection. Massive necrosis of the villi and mucosal cells and significantly greater numbers of tachyzoites were detected in the small intestines (p &lt; 0.0001) and Peyer's patches (p &lt; 0.0001) of C57BL/6 but not BALB/c mice. In addition, there were markedly and significantly greater numbers of inflammatory foci in livers of C57BL/6 mice than in BALB/c mice at each of the time points (p &lt; 0.0001). At 7 days, tachyzoites were detectable in the livers of C57BL/6 but not BALB/c mice. These data reveal that the severity of infection of the intestine and liver of mice following peroral infection with T. gondii is under genetic regulation and that the outcome of the peroral infection is critically related to the susceptibility of the small intestine to T. gondii.</page><page sequence="88">806 ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 516 The Group B Cell Wall Antigen of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Induces Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-a) Production by Human Neonatal Monocytes. JG VALLEJO*, CJ BAKER, MS EDWARDS. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. GBS is a major cause of sepsis and fatal shock in human neonates. Septic shock caused by GBS shares many clinical features with that caused by gram negative bacteria. Two of the most important proinflammatory cytokines associated with gram negative sepsis are TNF-a and interleukin-6. Although lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and whole GBS are known to induce TNF-a production, less is known about the contribution of individual GBS components to TNF- production. We measured the capacity of type III capsular polysaccharide (III-PS) and group B cell wall antigen (GB-AG) of GBS to induce release of TNF-a by neonatal monocytes. TNF-a production by neonatal monocytes (106/ml) in response to III-PS (100 ag/ml), GB-AG (100 pg/ml) or LPS (1 Ig/ml) was measured by EIA [Genzyme, MA] (pg/ml): Hours III-PS GB-AG LPS 4 20 ? 27 187 ? 131 686 90** 8 99 + 62 1186 ? 474* 1443 ?285 24 223 ? 15 1843 ? 274* 2076 + 144 N = 3 expermts. *p &lt; 0.05 GB-AG vs. III-PS **p &lt; 0.05 LPS vs. GB-AG Thus, GB-AG was as effective as LPS at inducing the release of TNF-a by neonatal monocytes at 8 and 24 hours. In contrast, TNF-a production was significantly less in response to III-PS, the major virulence factor of GBS. In preliminary experiments, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of GBS also induced production of TNF-a by neonatal monocytes. The mode of binding of GB-AG and LTA to monocytes and the events underlying the stimulation of TNF-a production require further study. We speculate that the pathophysiologic changes that occur during GBS septic shock are due to TNF-a production primarily in response to stimulation by GB-AG and LTA. These findings suggest that antibodies directed against TNF-a or components of GBS cell wall may have a therapeutic role in fulminant neonatal infection. 517 Cytoine Measurmants h Cinical Trils with Septic Patints. Experience from a Large Study with Monoclonal Antbody to Human TNFa (BAY x 1351). G LEMM*, Wupperlal, Gemany; J COHEN, London, England; J CARLET, Pars, Frnce; and the INTERSEPT study group. Since cytokine measurements in clinical samples are not yet standardized across laboratories, it is important to precisely describe the preanalytical procedures and the anylytical methods used in order to facilitate interpretation and allow meaningful comparisons of results from one laboratory to another. 553 patients (PTS) with the sepsis syndrome were dosed with 3 or 15 mg/kg of BAY x 1351 or placebo (PLA) in the randomized, multicenter, multinational INTERSEPT trial. Prior to enrollment of the first patient, detailed instructions on blood collection, plasma harvesting as well as sample labeling and storage were provided to all investigators. Commercial blood vacutainers used were checked for the presence of endotoxin and srew-capped polypropylene tubes for shipping plasma were provided. All samples were shipped on dry ice to a central laboratory (Bayer AG) for assay. Plasma samples were obtained from 504 PTS prior to and one hour after infusion for assay of TNFa (ELISA) and IL6 (B9 Bioassay). At baseline, PTS in shock had significantly higher cytokine levels than non-shock PTS (geometric means: TNFa: 92 pg/mL, N-378 vs. 55 pg/mL, N-126, p&lt;0.001; IL6: 4.0 ng/mL, N-377 vs. 1.2 ng/mL, N=126, p&lt;0.001). One hour after infusion there was a significant fall of TNFa levels compared to baseline in PTS treated with 3 or 15 mg/kg BAY x 1351 (20 vs. 72 pg/mL, N-165, and 13vs. 97 pg/mL, N-185, resp., p&lt;0.001), but not in PLA PTS (73 vs. 75 pg/mL, N-154, NS). In contrast to findings in endotoxin challenge human volunteer studies TNFa could not be detected with the WEHI cytotoxicity assay. In addition to the presence of high levels of soluble TNF- receptors (sTNFR) in septic PTS there may be other plasma factors interfering with the assay. Immunoreactive signals of the TNFa ELISA applied in INTERSEPT were not affected by sTNFR but they were inhibited by BAY x 1351 in vitro. Early analyses suggest that baseline TNFa levels may assist in characterizing the severity of sepsis but IL6 may be more useful as a predictor of septic shock outcome. 518 Recombinant Interleukin-7 (IL-7) induces anti- Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) activity in human macrophages (Mo). Terapong Tantawichien*, Lowell S. Young, Luiz E. Bermudez. Kuzell Institute, California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, San Francisco, CA IL-7 is a stromal cell-derived cytokine that has a num- ber of effects on mononuclear phagocytes. IL-7 stimulated the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) from human Mo and downregulated transforming growth factor beta (TGFP) mRNA expression and protein synthesis in murine Mo. We examined the modulatory role of IL-7 on intracellular growth of MAC, the most common cause of bacteremia in AIDS patients, using an in vitro human Mo infection model. Mo from healthy subjects were treated prior to or after MAC in- fection with different concentrations (10 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, I ng/ml, 10 ng/ml) of rhIL-7 (specific activity = lx107 U/mg). Concentrations of TNF-a and TGFPI released into culture su- pernatants of MAC-infected Mo were assayed by ELISA. Intracellular MAC growth was assessed by CFU assay of Mo lysates. At concentrations of 100 pg/ml, I ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, pretreatment with IL-7 stimulated secretion of TNF-a from MAC-infected Mo (increase up to 40%, p &lt; 0.05) and resulted in significant reduction in the number of viable intracellu- lar bacteria in a dose dependent fashion (up to 30% reduc- tion, p &lt; 0.05). Pre-treatment with IL-7 did not inhibit the se- cretion of TGFpI by MAC-infected Mo. IL-7 added to the macrophage monolayer 4 h after infection, stimulated both the secretion of TNF-a from MAC-infected Mo (increase up to 90%, p &lt; 0.05) and antimycobacterium activity (up to 50% re- duction, p &lt; 0.05), however, TGFp] production was not inhib- ited. IL-7-dependent anti-MAC activity of Mo was inhibited by anti-hTNF-o antibody. The results suggest that IL-7 is an ac- tivator of anti-MAC activity in Mo and may contribute to the regulation of the immune response against MAC. 519 Binding of Lymphocytes to Aspergillus Conidia: Inhibition by Antibodies to Mammalian Adhesion Molecules. DM COHEN*, CA SAVARY, MD MARTINS, RE COWART, ML GRAZZIUTTI, EJ ANAISSIE, SE VARTIVARIAN, and IH REX. University of Texas Medical School and MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Recently, invasive aspergillosis has been noted in patients who lack the classic risk factors for this disease but who instead have lymphocyte (lym) deficiency or dysfunction (e.g., AIDS). We have shown that monocyte-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated for 5 days with IL-2 or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) can damage Aspergillus. To study early lym-fungus interactions, we stained Aspergillus conidia (AC) with the fluorescent cell linker PKH26 and examined Iym binding in a serum-free system using flow cytometry. The percentage of unstimulated, IL-2-, and PHA-stimulated lym binding AC was 36+6, 44+7, and 24+1, respectively, and 89+4% of the lym binding AC were CD3+ T lym. When lym subsets were studied, 49+6% of CD3+ lym but only 12+4% of CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells bound AC. The results of binding studies in the presence of various blocking agents are shown in the table. Lym Treatment* Conclusions: (I) Lym % Reduction in AC Binding None IL-2 I PHA bind AC.

INTRODUCTION: ICAM-1 is an important early marker in the activation process of the immunological system and serves as a ligand for the leukocyte adhesion molecules CD11la/CD18 and CD11b/CD18, allowing cell to cell interactions and extravascular migration of leukocytes. The serum concentrations of its soluble fraction increases during acute and chronic inflammatory processes. Although there does not seem to be clear consensus on to the production of acute phase reactants, the extravascular migration, as well as the phagocytic and microbicidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are altered in the malnourished host. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We determined the serum concentrations of ICAM-1 in septic well nourished and malnourished children in a prolective, comparative and transverse study. Children of both sexes, between 6 to 94 months of age, were divided in two groups according to their nutritional status using Waterlow's criteria. Children with immunodeficiences other than malnutrition were excluded; similarly, children who received glucocorticoids and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also excluded. Informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians. The patients with clinical suspicion of infection were admitted to the PICU and a 5 ml blood sample was taken just at the moment they met sepsis criteria (2 or more of the following, adjusted to age: tachycardia, tachypnea or hypocapnia, hyper or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia or bandemia &gt; 10%, plus a clinically established infectious focus [pneumonia, gastroenteritis, etc.]). The serum concentrations were measured using a commercial ELISA kit specific for the human molecule (Cellfree?, T-Cell Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA, USA). Results are expressed in ng/ml. Mann-Whitney's "u" test for small samples (&lt; 20) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Twelve well-nourished and 5 malnourished children were included. Average serum ICAM-1 concentration in both groups was higher than that reported for healthy adults (x= 304 ng/ml). The value in well-nourished children (+x SEM) was 887.166 ? 189.98 ng/ml, which was significantly higher than 579.812 ? 114.921 ng/ml obtained in the malnourished group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In vivo and in vitro data have demonstrated that ICAM-1 is necessary for the neutrophil to initiate migration to the tissue, and later for the respiratory burst; both functions are profundly affected in severely malnourished patients. Our data show that severely malnourished children produced less ICAM-1 in response to infection than well nourished children, and further suggest that in infected malnourished children, low levels of ICAM-1 may be a contributing factor for the abnormal leukocyte response 521 Proliferative Response of Human T Lymphocytes Isolated from HIV Patients to the Major Surface Glycoprotein of Pneumocystis carinii. Nirai Sawhnev. Sue Theus. and Peter Walzer, Cincinnati VAMC and University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PcP) is a common and often fatal opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Residing on the surface of Pc are antigens termed the major surface glycoproteins (MSG), which are encoded by a multi-gene family. These proteins have been shown to elicit a proliferative response by CD4+ cells isolated from healthy rats or humans previously exposed to the organism. In the present study, we compared the proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells among HIV patients at different stages of infection to rat-derived Pc MSG and the T cell mitogen, Concanavalin A (Con A). The following groups of subjects were analyzed: 20 CDC Class A,.2 and CDC Class B,.2 (asymptomatic or non-AIDS defining illness with CD4+ counts 200-&gt;500), 5 CDC Class A3 and CDC Class B3 (CD4' counts &lt; 200), 5 CDC Class C,.2 (AIDS-defining illness with CD4+ counts 200-&gt;500), 12 CDC Class C3 (CD4+ counts &lt; 200), and 12 healthy controls. In general, the proliferative responses to MSG and Con A correlated well with CD4' counts. CDC Class A, B, and C HIV patients had significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) responses than did healthy controls. CDC Class C,. had significantly lower (p&lt;0.01) responses than CDC Class A,.3 and B1.3 HIV patients but are still detectable. Of interest, the peak response to MSG occurred on day 7 among HIV patients compared with day 5 among controls; by contrast, no such difference was found with the responses to Con A. Thus, in addition to its impairment of the cellular immune response, HIV may also cause changes in the recognition and/or processing of other microbial antigens.</page><page sequence="89">ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING 807 522 Role of Lymphocytes in Host Defense against Aspergillus fumigatus (AF). MD MARTINS*, DM COHEN, CA SAVARY, RE COWART, ML GRAZZIUTTI, SE VARTIVARIAN, EJ ANAISSIE, JH REX. UT Med School and M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. While phagocytes are key cells in host defense against AF, studies of the role of lymphocytes have yielded conflicting results. We previously demonstrated that plastic- and nylon wool- non- adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated for five days with IL-2 or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) could damage AF. Now, we have further purified our effector cell population and examined the activity of IL-2- and PHA- activated T- lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells against AF. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density sedimentation. Adherent cells were removed by repeated (3x) incubation on plastic. The non-adherent (NA) cells were passed over a nylon wool (NW) column, resulting in NWNA-PBMC. These cells were placed in cell culture without stimulation, in the presence of IL-2 (1000 U/ml), or in the presence of PHA (1 pg/ml). After 5-6 days, cells were harvested and T- lymphocytes were positively selected by panning, while NK cells were negatively selected using a magnetic cell sorting technique. Lymphocytes and AF conidia at a 50:1 effector-target ratio were combined in RPMI-1640/20mM HEPES/10% pooled human serum and incubated at 37?C in 5% CO2 for 20 h in a 96-well microdilution plate. Then, effector cells were lysed with deoxycholate and fungal damage assessed by measuring the ability of viable fungus to reduce a tetrazolium compound (MTT). Purified T-cells were &gt; 96% CD56?/CD3+ and enriched NK cells were &gt; 60% CD56+/CD3-. There were &lt; 0.01% CD14+ monocytes in all groups. The table shows the ratio of fungal viability under the given conditions to fungal viability after exposure to unactivated lymphocytes of the same type. There were 4-6 replicates of the NWNA-PBMC &amp; T-cell conditions, and one replicate of the single NK cell data point.

MG SCHUSTER*, TD BARTON, M IRANI. The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. Objective: To determine the incidence and etiology of infectious complications during hospitalization of patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) for the treatment of breast cancer. Methods: A retrospective review of 99 admissions to the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center during 1991-95 for ABMT for the treatment of breast cancer. Results: The mean duration of neutropenia was 10 days. No patients received antibacterial prophylaxis. Fluconazole prophylaxis was given to 70%, and acyclovir to 52% of patients. All but one patient received granulocyte colony stimulating factors. Forty-four of the 99 patients (44%) had an infectious complication during hospitalization. Infection was microbiologically documented in 28 (28%) cases; 27 bacterial and 2 viral. Causes of infection included: 8 C. difficile colitis, 5 urinary tract infections, 3 Hickman infections, 2 oral herpes simplex. Eleven (11%) patients had bacteremias; 42% were Gram negative and 58% Gram positive. Eighteen (18%) patients had a clinically documented infection. Seven (7%) developed Candida infections; 6 oral thrush, and 1 esophageal candidiasis. Other infections included: 4 cellulitis, 4 pneumonia, 2 sepsis wth negative blood cultures, 2 typhlitis, 2 sinusitis, and 1 peri-rectal abcsess. Patients &gt; 50 years of age had an increased risk of bacteremia (p=0.065). We could not demonstrate a correlation between risk of infection and duration of neutropenia. Empiric amphotericin B was used in 25% of patients who recieved fluconazole prophylaxis vs. 48% of those who did not (p&lt;0.03). Conclusions: Duration of neutropenia following ABMT for breast cancer was short. Most infectious complications were bacterial. Fungal infections were rare events with only one invasive candida infection. There were no invasive fungal infections among the 29 patients who did not receive antifungal prophlaxis. Similarly, viral infections were uncommon and easily treated. This patient population appears to be at decreased risk of fungal and viral infections in the immediate post-transplant period compared to historical data on ABMT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Strategies for the prevention and empiric therapy of fungal and viral infection in patients undergoing ABMT specifically for breast cancer should studied further and not merely extrapolated from other populations undergoing ABMT.</page><page sequence="90">808 AUTHOR INDEX TO ABSTRACTS OF THE 1995 IDSA ANNUAL MEETING Author Index NAME/ABSTRACT NUMBER Abbas, M. 97 Abbasi, S. 270 Abella, S. 315 Abellanosa, I.P. 242 Abi-Said, D. 178 Abolnik, I.Z. 196, 232 Abramson, J.
