<plain_text><page sequence="1">De Vries, Hent. Philosophy and the Turn to Religion. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999. xviii + 475 pp. Cloth, $55.00; paper, $24.95?Why, after two centuries of secularization, does biblical religion not only survive but, recently, even find support from some philoso phers, among them notably Derrida, who maintains that "citations from religious traditions are more fundamental to the structure of language and experience" than all the reductionist "genealogies, critiques, and transcendental reflections" (p. 2) of post-Enlightenment thought? The western religious tradition survives because, from the beginning, it has internalized a radical critique: the theological via negativa which, by strenuously qualifying religion's factual, logical, and ontological claims, brings about religion's death but simultaneously and perpetually assures its resurrection whether "in its present guise or in another" (p. 3). According to Derrida, the standard etymologies of "religion," which derive the term either from relegere, gathering or harvesting (Cicero, Augustine, and Aquinas), or religare, tying or binding back (Lactantius and Tertullian), obscure the absolute alterity or "disruptive unraveling" that "constitutes the very possibility of any bond" (p. 4). Religion de rives from dual sources, and it is this fact that sustains its cycle of death and resurrection: the experience of belief or trust, and the experience of the sacred or the holy as "utterly other." How, then, is "religion" to be understood, if, as a result of perpetual self-critique, it refers to nothing that remains sociologically invariant or historically and culturally self identical? Derrida answers that "religion" refers to what philosophical logos always tends "to forget, repress, or sub?ate": the "very religio" or tie to "the unthought, unsaid, or unseen" (pp. 5-6). The latter is what "religion," which is often undogmatic and ecclesiastically heterodox, il luminates and instantiates?the return to the repressed, things that presently "seem to reverse the Enlightenment's undoing of myth and fe tishization" (p. 7). Put systematically, "God" turns out to be "the most proper name" (p. 26) for "alterity" and the via negativa is the way to</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 853 "the incommensurable, totally other 'totally other'" (p. 27). The via neg ativa, in other words, is the ancient theological path underneath the modern philosophical highway of deconstruction. So characterized, the contemporary "return to religion" cannot be un derstood as a return or relapse to premodern fideism; rather, it properly leads to a critique of Enlightenment critique. To use the title of Derr ida's essay, one must understand the inextricable conjunction of "Faith and Knowledge" not just their naively asserted contradiction. Although "we can never simply 'forgo' the quintessential meaning and force of the 'good old Aufkl?rung'" (p. 33), the Kantian project of trying to think reli gion exclusively within the limits of reason is not sustainable: the "con fines of modern formal rationality" must be ventured beyond as well as the "metaphysical and ontotheological premises of the classical concep tions of reason" (p. 34) relentlessly interrogated. Enlightenment reason, with its "quasi-theological overtones" (p. 35), itself risks fideism be cause it is "traversed or haunted by a faith and a trustworthiness that borders upon heteronomy: enlightenment reason presupposes the trust worthiness "of a 'social bond' or of a 'sworn faith,' of a testimony," aris ing from a "performative of promising" that allows one to address the other, and which, in turn, allows for the structural "productive perfor mance that binds . . . science to technics" (p. 14). In its contemporary form, this "elementary faith," which is "in its essence or calling, reli gious" (p. 14), binds together religion and "globalizing" scientific ratio nality since the latter also presupposes a kind of faith?in Derrida's airy terms, a "telo-techno-capitalistico-scientific fiduciarity" (p. 15). De Vries rings the changes on this notion of aporetic religion?for ex ample, "the mutual implication of religion, reason, and radical evil" (p. 19)?which allows Derrida, as part of his project of "undoing and un writing of the tradition of metaphysics or ontotheology" (p. 27), to tie re ligion and its underlying protean faith to just about everything in mod ern life and culture: science, global information technology, geopolitics, "interethnic terror," psychoanalysis, even "the Jewish question." De Vries acknowledges that Derrida's examination of these myriad themes actually forecloses none of them, but each, despite "their mutually ex clusive options," remains "justified to a certain extent" (p. 23). De Vries offers a thread to guide the bewildered reader through his book's six chapter labyrinth of "crucial religious figures or theologemes" (p. 23): Derrida's appropriation of Levinas's "figure of the adieu" (p. 24). Not surprisingly, the figure turns out to be itself ambiguous: adieu is the "movement toward God, toward the word or the name of God, and a no less dramatic farewell to almost all the canonical, dogmatic, or onto theological interpretations of this very same 'God'" (p. 24). As the movement toward God, the adieu is "necessarily idolatrous" because al ways tainted with the empirical and anthropomorphic; as movement away, it exposes how secular and profane language is inadvertently "contorted or even false" because it "directs and redirects itself uninten tionally and unwittingly" (p. 26) toward the radical alterity of the theo logical tradition, that is, the God of the via negativa. If the adieu, more over, is paradoxical, because "the very idea of 'God' [as reached through</page><page sequence="3">854 ELIZABETH C. SHAW AND STAFF the via negativa] already contradicts itself" (p. 28), it is no less intermi nable thanks to the secular "logic of infinite substitution" of finite place holders for "God." The theme of De Vries's book, the "enduring appearance?indeed specter?of religion at the heart and in the very guise of its most fervent denials" (p. 27) is important, and its thesis, that the theological via neg ativa is the key and "privileged nonsynonymous substitution" (p. 96) for all the negative operations of rational critique, is intriguing. However, evaluating the thesis is exceedingly difficult because it is implicated in Derrida's vertiginously controversial reinterpretations of the "immense archive of concepts and figures, practices and dispositions" (p. 35) of biblical religion. In any case, Heidegger, rather than Levinas, seems to be the figure dominating Derrida's efforts to deconstruct and recon struct religion's "highly ambiguous potential" (p. 35): for the latter is lo cated not in any allegedly factual revelation or historical Christianity but in multitudinous Heideggerian-style a priori?to mention a few, tran scendental historicity, "the general structure of revealability," "Chris tianicity," and "messianicity" (pp. 35-6). When presenting Derrida's own "logic of presuppositions" (p. 36), De Vries, unfortunately, too fre quently engages, ? la fran?aise, in highly abstract talk about talk about talk: his book is written for and by an "insider" of the deconstructionist industry, clotted with awkward neologisms, constantly in danger of non sense because of sentences so drastically qualified as to be self-cancel ing, resistant in principle and fact not only to any linear but any stable reinterpretation of the religious tradition, deferentially reportorial rather than critical of the deconstructionists. Yet, then, we are told that "what is at issue is a subtle repetition . . . the same otherwise, time and again . . . [where] nothing is certain . . . [because] this relationship be tween the same and the other is concerned" (p. 37). As an often impa tient "outsider," I found De Vries narrative awash in aper?us that while sometimes arresting seem as often overblown and improbable.?Denis J. M.
