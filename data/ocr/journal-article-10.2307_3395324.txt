New Songs and Plays for the Elementary Grades For K-2 WIThi IMR. PEEPS Songs by Nick Alexander Play by Patsy Garrett Arrangements by Peter Hyde A WALK WITH MR. PEEPS offers a way to teach 'valuable lessons about health, safety and social attitudes to young children through music and a game. Mr. Peeps (an anthropomorphic dog) walks around his neighborhood and his friends sing songs about traffic safety, tooth care, safety in the home, the importance of getting enough sleep, learning to live with different kinds of neighbors, and to feel like "sharing and caring" as Penelope Pig so winsomely advises. The book contains the dialogue plus seven songs with piano accompaniment. Side A of the record contains a performance of the complete dialogue and songs with charming instrumental accompaniments. Side A may be used simply for listening, and children will be fascinated by the many voices of Patsy Garrett.(Many youngsters will recognize Patsy from her part in the "Benji"movies.) Side B contains recorded accompaniments for all of the songs.Music teachers who may not have (and classroom teachers who do not play) a piano can effectively teach the songs to the children using the songsheets, available on spirit masters, and the instrumental accompaniments on Side B of the record. Best of all, children can do all of the above and have the educational fun of playing the game A WALK WITH MR. PEEPS, available in the same set of duplicator masters. A WALK WITH MR.

With these 17 songs are piano accompaniments and suggestions for games and activities. HALLOWEEN PARADE also contains a playlet, Witch's Brew, for classroom, assembly, or PTA performance with five additional songs and great flexibility as to the number of characters, size of the chorus, scenery and costumes. (There must be one witch, however, and some bats and ghosts are required.) Any or all can participate, and most of the children may wear their own Halloween cos- tumes. As a memorable refreshment after the play, the "witch's brew" may be served by the actors to the audience!
