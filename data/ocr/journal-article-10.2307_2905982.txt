<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Coloring of Relations: Die Wahlverwandtschaften as Farbenlehre Claudia Brodsky The technical translation of Die Wahlverwandtschaften as "Elective Affinities" may be seen to be related to the larger interpretative problems complicating any understanding of the novel as a whole. The individual parts of the compound German noun are, of course, "Wahl" (choice) and "Verwandtschaften" (kin, or [family or blood] relations), their literal or lexical translation as a unit yielding "Chosen Kin" (or "Blood Relations of Choice") as the novel's more immediately paradoxical title. An unexpected discrepancy arises here upon inspection between the "technical" and "literal" signifi- cations of a single term. Thus the attempt to identify the equivalent of "Wahlverwandtschaften" in another language makes evident a semantic difficulty already present in its "original" form. For the dilemma faced by any reader, as much as translator, of the novel is that "technical" and "literal"-modifiers customarily used inter- changeably in referring to the faithful, rather than figural, ren- dering of meaning-are in this case indicative of dissimilar mean- ings. The overwhelming conformity in the history of the novel's translation notwithstanding,' in order to understand the signifi- cance of its title, the word serving ostensibly to represent the work, we must choose between two equally and therefore inadequate "proper" meanings while recognizing the form they appear in to be one. The root of the problem appears to lie most clearly in the past, and its solution, in a brief etymological exercise. To discover how we are meant to understand the meaning of "Wahlverwandtschaf- ten," we may need only verify the usage of the term contemporary to the novel's composition.

He includes, in the well-known Fourth Chapter of Part One, a didactic lesson in the meaning accorded his title throughout Europe at the turn of the century.2 During a recitation given by Eduard, consisting of "technical" rather than "poetic" or "discursive" "content,"3 Charlotte admits to having misconceived the referent of his speech. She claims4 that upon hearing the term read aloud she had thought immediately of a pair of her own relations and that she was surprised, upon turning her attention back to the subject under discussion, to discover it referred to "wholly inanimate things."5 The error Charlotte raises is promptly righted by Eduard, who soundly attributes his wife's confusion to the metaphorical nature of the term he has read: "'Es ist eine Gleichnisrede, die dich verfuhrt und verwirrt hat."' Emphasizing the exclusive reference of the metaphor, in its present context, to elements found objectively in nature ("Hier wird freilich nur von Erden und Mineralien gehandelt .. ."), Eduard goes on to offer a striking axiom as explanation of his wife's misapprehension: "... aber der Mensch ist ein wahrer NarziB; er bespiegelt sich tiberall gern selbst, er legt sich als Folie der ganzen Welt unter."6 The modern reader of Die Wahlverwandtschaften will be quick to identify the ironic import of this interchange between husband and wife. For the validity of Eduard's observation is most obviously applicable to the theory of "elective affinities" itself. Whether commenting upon the fallacy of an accepted scientific mode of perception, or correcting a momentary mistake in perception in Charlotte's part, Eduard proceeds to answer the question, directly posed here by Charlotte, of "what, by Verwandtschaften, is actually meant,"7 by describing the technical meaning accorded the word by science. In cooperation with the Captain, he upholds the empirical referentiality of a term which figures chemical interactions upon the patterning of inter-personal attractions. Such an an- thropomorphism of nature, a common if unconscious tendency in the scientific theory of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, was already gaining prominence as a basis of historical speculation in the works of such contemporary anthropological philosophers as Herder, and would later be made into an exclusive epistemological mode, as rendered most explicit in the theoretical anthropology of Feuerbach. Viewed historically, the problem of understanding posed by different "literal" and "technical" transla- tions of "Wahlverwandtschaften" would then date from the incep- tion, and philosophical contextualization, of a specifically technical</page><page sequence="3">M L N 1149 usage which was itself translated from subjective experience. This theoretical means of describing and conceptualizing empirical data, and therein of transcribing empirical observation as scientific truth, appears in retrospect to have always been figural in premise. The theory of "elective affinities" having been refuted and re- placed by atomic chemistry, the impropriety of its founding assumption-the application of a human attribute to natural phenomena-seems, from the vantage point afforded by inter- vening theories, all too plain. Mere temporal distance would en- lighten any reader enough to ascribe that outdated conception to the very human nature Eduard describes. Indeed, Eduard's axiom could even be extended further: man, the mortal Narcissus, can be seen to outdo the demi-god of Ovidian mythology in needing no mirror as the medium of his reflection. "He mirrors himself ev- erywhere" in the very content of his misconceptions. Perhaps more difficult to assimilate, however, is that the justice of that appraisal was formulated by the most clearly Narcissus-like of all the novel's characters, on behalf of a theory which had itself been miscon- ceived. If the technical meaning of "Wahlverwandtschaften" can thus be recognized in the present as an essentially misplaced figuration, can its literal meaning, in escaping the issue of historical determi- nation, be similarly assumed to escape the confusion of which his- tory is conceived? In accounting for the term's transposed technical meaning as a stage in the development of science, its literal or lexical significance inevitably acts as a constant of comparison. Yet does the semantic correction of a past anthropomorphism supply a referent in its place? Can we identify the object of the unchanging meaning to which a provisional and improper meaning is then to be compared? The problem, initially and generally posed, remains whether "Wahlverwandtschaften," in its most literal meaning, means what it says. If "elective affinities" between elements in na- ture properly referred to attractions between persons, are the "re- lations" of the terms's lexical translation definable as interpersonal? Furthermore, spanning both objective references of the term, we may ask if the "relations" indicated, signify, as they are designated, the consequences, whether intimate or elemental, of "choice." The question of whether "Wahlverwandtschaften" refers to re- lations between people or in nature refers Die Wahlverwandtschaften to the major corpus of Goethe's own "natural science" writings, Zur Farbenlehre.8 While the novel tells a story of relationships of love, the Farbenlehre speculates upon observations of color relations. In</page><page sequence="4">1150 CLAUDIA BRODSKY it, an analysis of color founded in essential transparency is rejected and "nature," in its most phenomenal aspect, is observed to enact the occurrence of its appearances.9 "Color" itself, however, is a term which may also refer to more than one possible meaning: its commonly understood figural signification is that of a figure of speech or rhetorical trope. According to the latter meaning, Goethe's "color theory" is suggestive of other theories of "color" whose usage of the term is figural from the start, and whose object of investigation is therefore discursive rather than "natural" by definition. While the practice of linguistic "color" is generally viewed as the distinguishing, synthesizing capacity of poetry, the technical identification and theoretical conceptualization of "col- ors" are distributed, by poetic analysis, between applied rhetoric and aesthetic philosophy respectively. Thus the formation, in lan- guage, of figures or "colors"-of denominating elements which cannot be identified with their referents-is responded to by a division of the labor of language into interlocking poetic and ana- lytic functions: functions whose presumed reflection of a control- ling intention displaces the problem of the purely discursive points at which they intersect. The problem posed by the appearance of "colors" of discourse-problems which are broadly preserved by the same schematic treatment meant to solve them-are well rep- resented by the Farbenlehre and Wahlverwandtschaften. Both are major prose texts written by the poet who continues to figure most actively in the unreconciled aesthetics (as well as incompatible philosophies) associated with Classicism and Romanticism. Fur- thermore, the issue of their dissimilarity extends beyond divisions of discursive purpose into the more fundamental distinction upon which the ascription of purpose to discourse depends: the distinc- tion between the composition of truth and its illusion, between writing formulated as science and the writing of fiction. The Far- benlehre regards the manifestation of color as both the primary object and constitutive subject of the natural scientist's investiga- tions. It describes those investigations, however, in singularly dis- cursive terms. Once "noted and named," Goethe proposes in the "Vorwort" to the Farbenlehre, such phenomenal "appearances" form a "language of nature" whose theory in turn "enriches" it and "eases its communication."'0 The tenuous scientific status of a theory derived from a "language of nature" can be seen reflected in the divided recognition which Goethe's "color theory" has received. For, considered as a systematic scientific treatise, the Farbenlehre has been criticized for its methodological and empirical errors, while</page><page sequence="5">M L N 1151 practicing artists, aestheticians and language philosophers have commended and attempted to reproduce its individual experi- ments and insights."1 The critical reception of Die Wahlver- wandtschaften, by contrast, has focused less upon the poetic than upon the ethical character of Goethe's characters, interpreting their actions and emotions as objective evidence of a classical, romantic, or even materialist text, by way of an unusually dense admixture of aesthetic and moral judgement.12 A second and rarer critical response has attended to the difficulties involved in iden- tifying any specific aesthetic or moral stance to which the novel adheres, difficulties abetted by its evasive but ever-present third person narrator, as well as the provocatively inconclusive com- mentary offered by its author.13 If Die Wahlverwandtschaften is read, however, not for what its story tells us about itself (as kind of text) or its subjects (as types of characters), but for how it tells that story-the elusive mode by which its narrative unfolds-it may be seen to transpose the prob- lem of the appearance of figuration into a literary form with neither theoretical nor poetic status proper: the novel.14 Rather than effecting meaning through the patterning of concepts or of images, novels are perhaps most simply conceived to develop the significance, through mimetic narrative, of a dominant, discursive theme. In accordance with such a description, Goethe's novel could be said to explore the thematics of misplaced affections, drawing their necessary consequences from a fictive set of circumstances. Yet necessarily included within the novel's development is the narrative of how that development is understood, from its most "realistic" or descriptive details to its prescriptive or "poetic" speculations. The part played by understanding or cognizance within the fiction implies that the problem of meaning opened to discussion by its theme must first be accounted for on the level of its form. For while the significance of representations must be predi- cated upon understanding, understanding is discursively, rather than mimetically, composed. Consequently, the question of figuration-of how representations in the narrative are made to relate-must be addressed in turn. If, like the immediate signifi- cance of its title, the final meaning of Goethe's narrative is as com- pelling as it is obscure, it is because the events of errant passion composing the novel's story also compose the way in which that story is understood, by the novel's characters, the subjects and ob- jects of action, and its narrator, their discursive source. Structured like their understanding, those events are available to discursive</page><page sequence="6">1152 CLAUDIA BRODSKY analysis as narrative moments representing differing discourses upon (and of) errant passion: rhetorical or figural representations of the movement of Eros made meaningful. For in order for "er- rant" relations of meaning, for "color," to appear, discursive rep- resentation must be made to mean of itself: language as a mode of reference must substitute for its referents, make them into its medium. The figural relation of representations involves a break with their conventional correlations, a movement within language from what is properly, while arbitrarily, meant by a word to a meaning which, while improper, seems significantly to fit. If the fit can then be called "figural meaning," the movement itself, like that of Eros, may well be called "Wahlverwandtschaften": "relations" whose meaning is made indeterminable as truth or as fiction, and whose structure of meaning arises neither by "choice" nor as in- tended. Yet an understanding of meaning as it appears in discursive objects need not structure our understanding of any other objec- tive phenomena. Linguistic relations are no more equatable with relations within nature than the word "color," used as a discursive artifice to mean the formal medium of meaning, a "figure of speech," is identical to the immediate, surface quality of objects its literal meaning denotes. We may conceive discursive meaning to be governed by a dialectic with our perception of nature, each re- sponding to, even transforming the other. But discourse, in the very terms of that relation, cannot be considered "natural." It ap- pears instead, as noted above, to be the identifying attribute of a distinctly "human nature": man as part of nature plus the power of articulation. Our perceptions of objects in nature, ourselves and others included, are carried out by an additional, artificial means. Hence human relations, such as those represented in Die Wahlver- wandtschaften, depend most clearly upon mediation to appear. The fact that the relations depicted in the novel are unstable, their passions irresolvably out of place, suggests not only the saying that "to err is human," but the possibility that errors may inhere in our most meaningful mediations. Relations which seem most natural may, by their appearance, perpetuate our mistakes. In order to understand the story of "Wahlverwandtschaften," errant passions which seem to occur by nature, the investigation of the appearance of linguistic meaning should be turned upon nature's own phenomenality. and the question asked: how does "color" proper appear?</page><page sequence="7">M L N 1153 By his own account, Goethe spent approximately half his life in the vigorous study of natural color. Although the two major pub- lications of his experiments, Beitrage zur Optik (1791) and Zur Far- benlehre (1810), were shunned by intellectual and scientific estab- lishments alike, Goethe defended his "natural science" writings as resolutely as he defended the crucial role played in nature by color. In a letter to Zelter (1832) he describes their rejection as one "of the most important experiences" of his advanced age, and claims to "praise" not the comprehension of his work, but its perception as inevitably "destructive" of institutionalized miscomprehension.15 Writing in a constructive rather than destructive vein to Joseph Carl Stieler (1829), Goethe described the lack of interest in his studies as indeed appropriate to certain scientific circles, and de- clared his distance from them. Of the "forty years" and "two octavo volumes" dedicated to the investigation of color, he writes, "it is perhaps little enough time and attention to give this subject," and continues: Den Mathematiko-Optikern verzeih ich gern, daB sie nichts davon wis- sen wollen; ihr Geschaft ist in diesem Fache bloB negativ. Wenn sie die Farbe aus ihren schatzbaren Objektivglassern los sind, so fragen sie weiter nicht danach, ob es einen Maler, Farber, einen die Atmosphare und die bunte Welt mit Freiheit betrachtenden Physiker, ein hiibsches Madchen, das sich ihrem Teint gemiB putzen will, obs diese in der Welt gibt, darum bekiimmern sie sich nicht ... Dagegen lassen wir uns das Recht nicht nehmen, die Farbe in allen Vorkommnissen und Bedeutungen zu bewundern, zu lieben und wom6glich zu erforschen.16 The conjunction of a "physicist or a pretty girl, adorning herself according to her complexion" may make the "freedom" of obser- vation appealed to by Goethe appear immediately suspect as a means of experimentation. The opening of the "Vorwort" to the Farbenlehre in fact includes a statement of Goethe's skepticism to- wards the scientist's endeavor to "express" any empirical object in its "essence." Yet Goethe proceeds to reclaim the right to ex- perimentation and expression by rejecting the fundamental em- pirical assumption of a static essence-appearance relation and positing colors, phenomenal aspects of objects in nature, to be the actions or deeds ("Taten" [the former meaning connoting pro- cesses; the latter, their completion]), and suffering or passions ("Leiden" [the latter meaning taken from the text of the New</page><page sequence="8">1154 CLAUDIA BRODSKY Testament: "die Leiden Christi"]) of an essential aspect of nature, light: Denn eigentlich unternehmen wir umsonst, das Wesen eines Dinges auszudriicken. Wirkungen werden wir gewahr, und eine vollstindige Geschichte dieser Wirkungen umfaBte wohl allenfalls des Wesen jenes Dinges. Vergebens bemuhen wir uns, den Charakter eines Menschen zu schildern; man stelle dagegen seine Handlungen, seine Taten zusam- men, und ein Bild des Charakters wird uns entgegentreten. Die Farben sind Taten des Lichts, Taten und Leiden. In diesem Sinne konnen wir von denselben Aufschliisse iiber das Licht erwarten. Farben und Lichte stehen zwar untereinander in dem genausten Verhaltnis, aber wir mussen uns beide als der ganzen Natur angehorig denken, denn sie ist es ganz, die sich dadurch dem Sinne des Auges besonders offenbaren will.17 An analogy is set up here between the structures of appearance ("ein Bild ... wird uns entgegentreten") in man and in nature. "Light" in the second paragraph substitutes for "the character of a human being" in the first, and "colors," for human "actions" and "deeds." A reversal of those substitutions would transform the "complete story of phenomenal effects" to follow this introduction into an allegorical narrative of phenomena effected by man. Goethe's des- ignations of the object of his study-"color's occurrences and meaning," "the actions and passions" of light-seem equally, if not more appropriate to the objects of discursive analysis: "colors" as non-mimetic conveyors of meaning, or figures. The extension of the analogy between human and natural essences into analogous phenomenal modes is indeed made explicit by Goethe slightly further on, as he states that nature "speaks with itself," and "to us," like us, in "language."18 While we, however, may assume knowledge of whom we speak to and what we say, the specific intentionality of the speech here ascribed to nature must remain uncertain. What we may interpret as messages meant for our understanding could instead be parts of a dialogue between nature and itself. Similarly, the issues of the cause and origin of the language nature seems to speak-whether they lie with us or in itself; whether its theoretical analysis should therefore be empirical or structural-are made un- determinable by Goethe's description. Linguistic and symbolic re- lations which seem to arise as the consequence of human percep- tions and designations are identified with and replaced by a refer- ence to "Natursprache." The validity of a "color theory" based upon a study of nature is underscored within this equation; at the</page><page sequence="9">M L N 1155 same time neither side of the equation remains stable long enough to exist without it: Man hat ein Mehr und Weniger, ein Wirken, ein Widerstreben, ein Tun, ein Leiden, ein Vordringendes, ein Zuriickhaltendes, ein Heftiges, ein Mailigendes, ein MSnnliches, ein Weibliches fiberall bemerkt und genannt, und so entsteht eine Sprache, eine Symbolik, die man auf ahnliche Falle als Gleichnis, als nahverwandten Ausdruck, als unmittel- bar passendes Wort anwenden und benutzen mag. Diese universallen (Bezeichungen), diese Natursprache auch auf die Farbenlehre anzuwenden, diese Sprache durch die Farbenlehre, durch die Mannigfaltigkeit ihrer Erscheinungen zu bereichern, zu erweitern und so die Mitteilung hoherer Anschauungen unter den Freunden der Natur zu erleichtern, war die Hauptabsicht des gegenwartigen Werkes.19 The substitution of a "Symbolik" named by man with a natural language of "universal designations" turns back upon and further specifies itself ("eine Sprache ... diese Natursprache ... diese Sprache") as do the relations between both the language and its theory, and the language and the many forms in which it appears ("diese Natursprache ... auf die Farbenlehre anzuwenden ... durch die Farbenlehre, durch die Mannigfaltigkeit ihrer Er- scheinungen . ."). The distinctions of movement, mass and quality stated here to shape the colors of a natural language studied by science can be renamed-as they are by Goethe-discursive "im- ages" or rhetorical "colors": "words" whose "application" in context seems "immediately to fit." Yet introductory passages such as these, whose own continually moving substitutions refuse priority or even identity to either phenomenon in isolation render such a clear (one could say close to colorless) denomination questionable, precisely by problematizing whatever we might believe "literal" or "natural" color to be. Goethe's insistence throughout the Naturwis- senschaftlichen Schriften upon the revealing involvement of phenom- enal appearances, such as color, in nature, and the practical use of scientific observation implies that neither "science" nor "nature" are to be simply excluded from investigations which invoke them.20 Although the "method" of Goethe's scientific practice has been annotated,21 and the props and "color cards" of his experiments schematically reproduced,22 Goethe's conception of color as the "movements and designations ... promoting any form of life"23 prohibited any but an extemporaneous series of empirical ap- proaches ("Versuche") to its study. In an essay of April, 1792, later</page><page sequence="10">1156 CLAUDIA BRODSKY entitled "Der Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Subjekt," Goethe specifies the "half arbitrary, half artificial" nature of the phenomena which the mediation "we call experimentation" must repeatedly reconstruct.24 The textual arrangement of the results of individual "Versuche(n)" must follow the sequential order of ex- perimentation itself rather than a prefigured, "systematic form": "diese Materiellen miissen in Reihen geordnet und niedergelegt sein, nicht auf eine hypothetische Weise zusammengestellt, nicht zu einer systematischen Form verwendet."25 From their inception, both the empirical experiments, carried out in daylight, and dis- cursive composition of the "color theory" were directed specifically against the restrictive manipulation and systematization of color which resulted in Newton's Optics: DaB Newton bei seinen prismatischen Versuchen die Offnung so klein als moglich nahm, um eine Linie zum Lichtstrahl bequem zu sym- bolisieren, hat eine unheilbare Verirrung fiber die Welt gebracht, an der vielleicht noch Jahrhunderte leiden. Der Newtonische Irrtum steht so nett in Konversations-lexikon, daB man die Oktavseite nur auswendig lernen darf, um die Farbe furs ganze Leben los zu sein.26 In opposition to Newton's "comfortable symbolization" of light in the form of a "line," a severe limitation of that primary "Urphano- men" symbolized here in turn in transparently erotic terms (the isolation, through "the smallest possible opening," of a single ray into a dark room), Goethe posed the volatile counter-premise that "certain colors are inherent to certain forms of life."27 Formal ob- jects are thus claimed to be animate in their structure, and nature, once revealed by light "through eyesight" (see n. 17, this essay), already invested with color. This "scientific" understanding of na- ture is reminiscent of the well-known discovery of "resignation"28 at the opening of Faust II: "Am farbigen Abglanz haben wir das Leben" (V. 4727). Its emphasis upon color as a living and con- stituent quality of form, whose source of life (in light and in the eye) must be recognized as "ungraspable" and "impractical,"29 ir- reducible to an ordered spectrum amounting to white light and the mechanical faculty of lexical "memorization" (see n. 26), insured the systematic failure of Goethe's "color theory," although in a manner which its correction by optics cannot fully comprehend. For while Goethe carefully divides his study of colors into the three categories of their basic affiliations: the "physiological," "be- longing to the eye;" the "physical," brought to appearance through</page><page sequence="11">M L N 1157 a colorless medium; and the "chemical," "belonging to the object,"30 the results of his investigations are found to have been contami- nated by the very employment of empirical observation. In his 1820 Postscript to the Color Theory, Goethe redefines the "physiolog- ical colors" as "those, that are ... the beginning and end of all color theories ... and rather than regarding them as fleeting mistakes in seeing, they are now held as norm and guideline for all residual visible evidence."31 The status of colors whose appearance is pro- duced by the eye characterizes, or could be called the "symbolic" of, the "language of nature" which the discursive scientist "first makes visible as text."32 If our knowledge of nature, as Goethe argues, must include phenomenal appearances as well as form, it is because formal perceptions are always colored by the activity of cognition. For any "attentive observation" of objective phenomena invokes its own interpretative "transposition" into "theory." The defense of a theory, in turn, transforms "fleeting mistakes" of perception into the "norms and guidelines" of knowledge. That recognition, cir- cular and inevitable in its consequences, is Goethe's own. It is also, as he asserts, the "necessary" means of achieving results which, like color itself, will be "living" and "useful" in effect. He states of the centrality of theory to sight itself: Ist es doch eine hochst wunderliche Forderung, die wohl manchmal gemacht, aber auch selbst von denen, die sie machen, nicht erfiillt wird: Erfahrungen solle man ohne irgendein theoretisches Band vortragen und dem Leser, dem Schiler uberlassen, sich selbst nach Belieben irgendeine Uberzeugung zu bilden. Denn das bloBe Anblicken einer Sache kann uns nichts fordern. Jedes Ansehen geht iiber in ein Be- trachten, jedes Betrachten in ein Sinnen, jedes Sinnen in ein Verknup- fen, und so kann man sagen, daft wir schon beijedem aufmerksamen Blick in die Welt theoretisieren. Dieses aber mit BewuBtsein, mit Selbstkenntnis, mit Freiheit und, um uns eines gewagten Wortes zu bedienen, mit Ironie zu tun und vorzunehmen, eine solche Gewandtheit ist notig, wenn die Abstraktion, vor der wir uns furchten, unschadlich und das Er- fahrungsresultat, das wir hoffen, recht lebendig und nutzlich werden soil.33 [my emphasis] Carried out as strictly "natural science," Goethe's attack upon the violent circumscription of nature, the breaking of the force of light into a static spectrum of colors, and the emptying of colors into complementary transparency, understands itself as an ironical discourse which must prove as "theory" the fiction of objectified color, of color as the natural appearance of form, in order to ren- der any theory of objectification, of formal conceptualization with-</page><page sequence="12">1158 CLAUDIA BRODSKY out color ("Abstraktion") a fiction. The movement of vision from an objective referent to its own "theoretization" is the coloring of all empirical perception demonstrated in the "color theory." The discursive model implied here for the process of cognition holds equally for that of experimentation, or concrete "mediation." As Goethe redefines the latter in "Der Versuch als Vermittler .. .": ... das heiBt ein Versuch, viele Gegenstande in ein gewisses faBliches Verhaltnis zu bringen, das sie, streng genommen, untereinander nicht haben, daher die Neigung zu Hypothesen, zu Theorien, Terminologien und Systemen, die wir nicht miBbilligen konnen, weil sie aus der Or- ganisation unsers Wesens notwendig entspringen milssen.34 The power to form relations (".. . Gegenstande in ein ...Ver- haltnis zu bringen ...") lacks the power to prove their validity (".. . das sie, streng genommen, untereinander nicht haben."). The "proclivity" for theory is a function of that paradox, and as such one of which we are "unable to disapprove"; its source, since necessarily denied any relation to objects themselves, is here dis- placed onto the internal structure of the experimenter's own "being." In the context of prefacing an investigation which calls itself a "theory," in the "Vorwort zur Farbenlehre," the problems of authority and proof brought to light in "Der Versuch . . ." are replaced with assertions of self-conscious "freedom" and "irony," disclaimers all the more persuasive for their apparent candor. For, ironically enough, "das Erfahrungsresultat," or experience in which the reception of that theoretical fiction results, may itself appear so "living" and "useful" as to give the fiction the appearance of truth. One wholly persuaded reader of the "color theory" views Goethe's "achievement" as a real counterproof "to idealistic philosophy," which would reduce color to a purely subjective phe- nomenon, "as well as to the technical science of physics,"35 which must deny the role of subjectivity in objective perception. When the same reader goes on to state: "With so much greater right may we be glad that Goethe saves colors as real for our world,"36 he replaces the fiction of a world without color with that of "real" color in a properly human world, disregarding his own recognition of the "error" through which the synthetic status of color is "saved." The Farbenlehre enthusiast notes that Goethe attributed to pure "im- ages" of color, in the shape of auras or borders, the mode of mutu- ally effective "things." He focuses incisively upon the discursive problem of distinguishing image from object posed by Goethe's science, analyzing the "explanation" of the color experiments as follows:</page><page sequence="13">M L N 1159 Diese Erklarung der farbigen Siume laBt sich nicht halten. Es ist schon bedenklich, zu sagen, daB das Bild erweitert bzw. verengt werde: ein 'Bild' ist kein Ding, dem Derartiges widerfahren konnte. Ein Bild an der Wand ist ein Ding, ein Korper, ein Einzelwesen, dem Veranderung widerfahren kann; die von Goethe behandelte Farbersheinung ist es nicht. Noch bedenklicher ist es, wenn Goethe sagt, das Bild bewege sich scheinbar, der farbige Saum strebe aus dem Bild hinaus usw. Man muB solchem Denken entgegentreten, will man nicht den daraus folgenden Irrtumern verfallen: ein Insekt kann aus einem Kreise hinausstreben, nicht aber ein farbiger Saum ... Und wollte man die vielleicht an sich richtigen Sachverhalt hingehen lassen, so ist doch die entscheidende Behauptung Goethes unhaltbar, daB durch die Verrickung an dem Hauptbilde ein Nebenbild entstehe. Hier fiuhrt eine bedenkliche Ausdruck-und Denkweise in den Irrtum.37 [my emphasis] A "'Bild"' (a discursive image) is not a "Bild" (a concrete por- trait); to regard it as such is "to fall prey to mistakes." The right to celebrate the restoration of a constitutively colored world must re- ject the theoretical figuration of colors as images which not only "effect and transform" each other, but appear to be "striving out of their imaged form." Such claims for the independent animacy of color are attributed to a "tropological mode of expression" on Goethe's part. Confusion sets in here between the "colors" under investigation and those of the investigative discourse. The latter, even if at first held in distinction from a hypothetically "correct content," prove to lead to the "decisive" and "untenable" assertion of color, as image, compelling color into being: "daB durch die Verriickung an dem Hauptbilde ein Nebenbild entstehe." "Aus- drucksweise" and "Sachverhalt" may be conceded as mutually ef- fective, but colors themselves may not be, if the "world" of color "saved" by theory is to be identified as "ours." The fact that the "natural science" of such a world must be written "mit Ironie" if it is to be true to nature, makes the imaging of its experiments at once literally unacceptable and the necessary means of their explana- tion, their being understood. Colors in the Farbenlehre are figured as images which interact like objects. Unlike objects, however, they are also said to move in de- parture from their form. The "Bilder" of Die Wahlverwandtschaften are human lives moved by passion; its narrative tells a story in which their relations are transformed. Included in the above critique of Goethe's description of color as a moving displacement of form was the contrary assertion, "Ein Insekt kann aus einem Kreise hinausstreben, nicht aber ein farbiger Saum." Returning to the question of what its title, "Wahlverwandtschaften," means, we</page><page sequence="14">1160 CLAUDIA BRODSKY may ask if the characters of the novel, its objectified images, share the same freedom of choice in their movements as the critic's "In- sekt," or, for that matter, its mere capability ("kann .. ."). Do they enter into and break the "circle"38 of their relations at will; are the characters the cause of their own figurations? Or do the substitu- tions they carry out merely mark the functions of a govering inten- tion by name? In seeking the proper referent of "relations of choice" do we see the pure colors they produce, their "figural meaning," or see through them to a stable structure of meaning, a spectrum of "colors" independent of the motions from which it is formed? These opposing views of the events narrated in the novel are mediated on one level, as already suggested, by the novel as literary form. For the discourse of a narrative fiction combines the ap- pearance of meaning, "actions and passions," with the endeavor to explain them; each occurrence engages an "Anblick" in the voice of narrator, character or author. Everywhere within a novel, someone must be said to be envisioning and something must be said to be seen. The possibility of purely conceptual, generic, or sensory rela- tions, played out in the practices of philosophy and verse, is never fully excluded from the discursive content of the novel. But its realization would most clearly betoken the failure of the novel: the impossibility of composing a story.39 Moreover, because appear- ances in the novel are always part of a continuing narrative, each becomes involved in the understanding of its relations to others. In other words, the novel takes form as a "transposition" into "theoretization": the narration of what it designates into the shape and appearance of a coherent, or causally connected, fiction. While a theoretical science which refers to nature must be pref- aced by an explicitly ironical stance in order to account for the objective "errors" of its explanations, the irony of the novel is in- voked in its status as "fiction." That status is upheld, ironically, only to the extent that the referents of its discourse are understood as "real." Irony appears subsumed whenever we mistake that "liter- ary" reality for truth, and strengthened by the very fact that we do so. The capability of the novel as form is to make narrative the measure and mode of understanding, to make "actions and pas- sions" appear consequences of a cause,40 for as a "fiction" rather than a "theory," it can refer to the "ungraspable" "original phenomena" of nature-the act of seeing and the light we see by-within its story by name.</page><page sequence="15">M L N 1161 Within Die Wahlverwandtschaften the images indicated by those referents indicate something in turn about the relation between articulation and understanding: the inevitable need to know inten- tion by referent, meaning by word, a character by its name. They are designated, most directly, as the power of man to mediate vi- sion in language, and of light to make objects visible: "Mittler" and "Luciane." Some maintain superstitiously, the narrator informs us, that Mittler was destined to his vocation by his name: "Diejenigen, die auf Namensbedeutungen abergliubisch sind, behaupten, der Name Mittler habe ihn gendtigt, diese seltsamste aller Bestim- mungen zu ergreifen."41 The purpose by which Mittler defines his life may have been defined by the accident, believed significant, of his being called by a certain word, an otherwise abstract referent transformed into a proper noun. If the relevance of the term, "Mittler," to the character and his vocation is viewed instead as purely fortuitous, the novel may be seen to parody its own purpose, that of making its referents known through a sequence of narrated actions. Yet Mittler is referred to as a mediator while his activities are shown to signify anything but his name: throughout the novel they entail polarities as their result. Whether called upon by others or by knowledge of his craft, Mittler, who refuses to appear with- out acting, to waste time where he is not needed (his first appear- ance in the narrative prefaced by his own question and condition, "ob es not tue" [p. 253]), always acts at the wrong moment and to powerfully divisive effect. Mittler's own recognition of the tem- poral basis of effective mediation is referred to by the narrator in the final chapter of the novel, when his appearance is to prove most poorly timed: "Der hartnackige Mann wuBte nur zu wohl, daB es einen gewissen Moment gibt, wo allein des Eisen zu schmeiden ist" (p. 481). Ottilie has already entered and is to leave the room in which he speaks transformed, seen by Charlotte before Mittler can be interrupted ("ehe sie ihn noch unterbrechen konnte, sah sie schon Ottilien, deren Gestalt sich verwandelt hatte, aus dem Zim- mer gehen"), as the mediator gives voice to the "good fortune" of maintaining "indissoluble bonds" (p. 483). His speech in praise of discursive mediation propels the invisible progress of Ottilie's death, destabilizing the circle of relations which had settled for a second time. Indeed, the disturbing period preceding the formal return of those relations can only be properly referred to in "Mit- tler"'s name: "Jedes unerfreuliche, unbequeme Gefiihl der mittlern Zeit war ausgeloscht" (p. 479).</page><page sequence="16">1162 CLAUDIA BRODSKY Discursive mediation, as personified and understood by Mittler, depends upon proper timing to be enacted; enacted it produces further "actions and passions" rather than the formal stability it intends. Reflecting upon their own errors, characters compelled to transgress the form of their relations view Mittler and time itself as the necessary mediators of their mistakes. These mobile images of human nature understand their own movements in terms of tem- poral predication, conceiving of "der mittlern Zeit" as the time in which they take on meaning. Charlotte's belief in Eduard's eventual return only echoes Eduard's earlier insistence upon a belated mar- riage to Charlotte. Her interpretation, in retrospect, of their "imagination's" double adultery42 as "a new binding of their rela- tions" (pp. 358-9) is countered by Eduard's reading of the "many clear signs" (p. 449) which prove his claim to Ottilie. Included in those signs, as he explains later to the Captain, is that of his own survival in battle. Eduard decides to substitute himself for a glass etched with own initials which he has misconceived as standing for his union with Ottilie: "... mich selbst will ich an die Stelle des Glases zum Zeichen machen, ob unsre Verbindung m6glich sei oder nicht" (p. 447). Its duration as a sign (of what it is not) trans- forms his life into a symbol. Eduard comes to view his own ap- pearance as an image of a single and unmediated significance: "Ottilie ist mein, und was noch zwischen diesem Gedanken und der Ausfiihrung liegt, kann ich fur nichts bedeutend ansehen" (p. 447). Like the "movements" of nature cited in the Farbenlehre, those of passion first become meaningful in appearance when substituted for by "language," "discourse" or "speech" ("diese Natursprache," Mittler's "Rede") whose own "phenomena," "signs," must be seen as mediations, requiring sequential time to be understood, Thus meaning, by the same token, is subject to the appearance of media- tion, i.e., a phenomenality which as mere appearance may be false. Eduard's misinterpretation of the unchanged letters on a glass substitutes another meaning for one earlier intended. More dis- arming, because achronistic in effect, is the reverse situation. Ap- pearances which seem identical to those of a former moment may impose upon relations a meaning no longer pertinent, thereby obliterating the significance they have garnered over time. The narrator explains such repetition as a common occurrence con- ditioned by the "nature" of man. The latter, however, is enumer- ated to encompass both internal and external circumstances, and men "found," after disturbances arising within and outside them, "unchanged." Because those disturbances occur "interminably," man is, by nature, "unchangeable":</page><page sequence="17">M L N 1163 Was einem Menschen gewohnlich begegnet, wiederholt sich mehr, als man glaubt, weil seine Natur hiezu die nachste Bestimmung gibt. Charakter, Individualitat, Neigung, Richtung, Ortlichkeit, Umge- bungen und Gewohnheiten bilden zusammen ein Ganzes, in welchem jeder Mensche wie in einem Elemente, in einer Atmosphare schwimmt, worin es ihm allein bequem und behaglich ist. Und so finden wir die Menschen, fiber deren Veranderlichkeit so viele Klage gefiuhrt wird, nach vielen Jahren zu unserm Erstaunen unverandert und nach auBern und innern unendlichen Anregungen unveranderlich. (p. 478) This general observation of human nature can be seen to personify Goethe's enigmatic lyric title, "Dauer im Wechsel." Yet within the context of a temporally continuous narrative, relations of images which appear immediately as they once appeared must be viewed as an "illusion," and their mistaking, named and "pardoned" as de- luded vision or "madness." The narrator continues: So bewegte sich auch in dem taglichen Zusammenleben unserer Freunde fast alles wieder in dem alten Gleise. Noch immer auBerte Ottilie stillschweigend durch manche Gefalligkeit ihr zuvorkommendes Wesen, und so jedes nach seiner Art. Auf diese Weise zeigte sich der hausliche Zirkel als ein Scheinbild des vorigen Lebens, und der Wahn, als ob noch alles beim alten sei, war verzeilich. (p. 479) The signs of "madness," those which eradicate temporality through their purely spatial perception, are not misconstrued in this case from an inscription on a glass. Instead they are read, while never having been written, in nature: Die herbstlichen Tage, an Lange eben jenen Friihlingstagen gleich, riefen die Gesellschaft um eben die Stunde aus dem Freien ins Haus zuriick. Der Schmuck an Frfichten und Blumen, der dieser Zeit eigen ist, lieB glauben, als wenn es der Herbstjenes ersten Friihlings ware; die Zwischenzeit war ins Vergessen gefallen. Denn nun bliuhten die Blu- men, dergleichen man in jenen ersten Tagen auch gesaet hatte; nun rieften Friichte an den Baumen, die man demals bliihen gesehen. (p. 479) The external landscape of the narrative, the "element" or "at- mosphere" to which its characters return, is directly described here as a deceptive field of artifice or "ornament." The "flowers" and "fruits" which are said to mislead, however, do so because the "na- ture" they spring from is that of narration itself. For only in the course of a chronological narrative can the face of nature be said to substitute for itself: only when understood to interact as figures can "natural" phenomena in one place ("denn nun bluhten die Blu- men") be read to replace others in another place ("Friichte an den</page><page sequence="18">1164 CLAUDIA BRODSKY Baumen, die man damals bliihen gesehen"), and thus to appear proper to a single period of time ("dieser Zeit eigen"). Moreover, temporal demarcations which are arbitrary and unavailable to vi- sion in themselves-the length of days, a specified hour-take on in recurrence their own misconceived appearance of identity: "Tage, an Lange . . . gleich;" "um eben die Stunde." "The time between" the separation and rejoining43 of "Wahlverwandtschaften," the duration which the novel itself has mediated through narration, "falls into oblivion." At such a moment the narrative can only con- tinue by envisioning its own discourse as overcome. The return of relations which are unmediated and repeat their own history is ascribed, through rewriting in retrospect, to an "unbeschreiblich, fast magische Anziehungskraft," as the narrator describes an "in- describable ... force" by referring to the forms of meaning of which it has no need: vision, discourse, intentionality of thought, distinctions: Nach wie vor ubten die eine unbeschreibliche, fast magische An- ziehungskraft gegen einander aus. Sie wohnten unter einem Dache; aber selbst ohne gerade aneinander zu denken, mit andern Dingen beschiftigt, von der Gesellschaft hin- und hergezogen, niherten sie sich einander ... Nur die nachste Nahe konnte sie beruhigen, aber auch vollig beruhigen, und diese Nahe war genug; nicht eines Blickes, nicht eines Wortes, keiner Gebarde, keiner Beriuhrung bedurfte es, nur des reinen Zusammenseins. Dann waren es nicht zwei Menschen, es war nur ein Mensch in bewuBtlosen vollkommen Behagen, mit sich selbst zu- frieden und mit der Welt ... Das Leben war ihnen ein Ratsel, dessen Auflosung sie nur miteinander fanden. (p 478) The activity of mediation endows vision with significance, sight with the color of what is seen, the movement of passion with the name and meaning of love. At the same time, and at the price of its own appearance, it strengthens the relations it fails to recognize and severs those it intends to secure as bonds. In the absence of mediation, in "reine(m) Zusammensein," errant passions and per- ceptions must be viewed, at very least, as "pardonable," since, un- related by discourse to understanding, they can never be conceived of, let alone as going wrong. Like living color "Bilder" which are seen through experimentation and explained to bring each other into being, the human images of the novel's story, brought together by a practical "Versuch,"44 are said to find with each other alone the "solution of the riddle" posed by "life." The ongoing narration of those relations must refer to their arresting of discursive meaning as delusion. But within the event the narrative recounts as figura-</page><page sequence="19">M L N 1165 tion, within "Wahlverwandtschaften," as narrative duration is for- gotten and neither choice of object nor designation of meaning obtains, a "Scheinbild" (p. 479) is a "'Bild,"' image or metaphor (the name of a figural movement which both replaces and refers); is a "Bild," portrait or picture (an object intended to imitate another, to objectify movement at a moment in time). The experience in which such an occurrence results is figured in turn as a consciousless, comodious unity. The very bases of the novel's unsettling story appear suspended: "Dann waren es nicht zwei Menschen, es war nur ein Mensch in bewuBtlosen Behagen, mit sich selbst zufrieden und mit der Welt." Hence its irony as fiction is never more far reaching. For devoid of the time and means with which to distin- guish between appearances, the "self," and the "world"-not to speak of an accompanying sense of "satisfaction"-cannot begin to be known. The novel offers up its irony as self-evident in designating the condition upon which mediated meaning depends. Mittler, the character, may be viewed as misguided and verbose; his relation to the narrator's own occupation, easily overlooked by an interest in the story's outcome. The character called Luciane, however, is dis- tinguished foremost by her desire to confuse. The one literally familial relation in the novel (aside from the infant Otto, who ap- pears related to parents other than his own), she shares with her mother, Charlotte, no rapport to speak of. Luciane's chief activity is to clothe herself in false appearances; she brings Scheinbilder to vision by intention. The narrator explains why her arrival in the story is surrounded by "so much baggage": Nicht umsonst hatte sie so vieles Gepacke mitgebracht, ja es war ihr noch manches gefolgt. Sie hatte sich auf eine unendliche Abwechselung in Kleidern vorgesehen ... so erschien sie ... auch ... in wirklichen Maskenkleid, als Bauerin und Fischerin, als Fee und Blumenmadchen. Sie verschamte nicht, sich als alte Frau zu verkleidern, um desto frischer ihrjunges Gesicht aus der Kutte hervorzuzeigen; und wirklich verwirrte sie dadurch das Gegenwartige und das Eingebildete dergestalt, daB man sich mit der Saalnixe verwandt und verschwigert zu sein glaubte. Wozu sie aber diese Verkleidungen hauptsichlich benutzte, waren pantomimische Stellungen und Tanze, in denen sie verschiedene Charaktere auszudriicken gewandt war. (p 379) Luciane impersonates figures as pictures. Onstage and off, her mode of reference is mimetic: a mimetics, however, which obviates reference to the purpose of displaying the identity of the imitator. She draws attention toward her by representing what she is not,</page><page sequence="20">1166 CLAUDIA BRODSKY focusing her own attentions upon those who present some "signif- icance" (p. 379), while prohibiting at the same time that her actions and appearance be probed. Demanding to be seen, she maintains the spectators she attracts at a proper distance, in the dark: Sie wollte mit jedermann nach Belieben umspringen, jeder war in Gefahr, von ihr einmal angestoBen, gezerrt, oder sonst geneckt zu wer- den; niemand aber durfte sich gegen sie ein Gleiches erlauben, niemand sie nach Willkfir, niemand, auch nur im entferntesten Sinne, eine Freiheit, die sie sich nahm, erwidern; und so hielt sie die andern in den strengsten Grenzen der Sittlichkeit gegen sich, die sie gegen andere jeden Augenblick zu iibertretten schien (p. 387) The relations Luciane provokes and controls by choice parody the literal meaning of "Wahlverwandtschaften," as the mention of her choice in pets, an "ape" whose absence requires his replacement with a "portrait" (p. 382), comments clearly upon her own presen- tation within the novel. What stranger and more fitting way for the fiction to make its irony visible than in the name of light.45 For in her involubility, her mimicry, her artifice and its props, Luciane is most revealing of illumination in the novel. Her actions and words give voice to an opposition played out in the narrative between herself and her Gegenbild or counter-image, the character in whose mere presence relations are colored and come to life. The narrator describes the strenuous diversions imposed upon Ottilie's comings and goings by Luciane: Ottilie sollte mit auf die Lust- und Schlittenfahrten ... sie sollte weder Schnee noch Kalte noch gewaltsame Nachtstiirme scheuen, daja so viel andre nicht davon stiirben. Das zarte Kind litt nicht wenig darunter, aber Luciane gewann nichts dabei: denn obgleich Ottilie sehr einfach gekleidet ging, so war sie doch, oder so schien sie wenigstens immer den Mannern die Schonste. Ein sanftes Anziehen versammelte alle Manner un sie her, sie mochte sich in den groBen Riumen ersten oder am letzten Platze befinden.... (p. 388) Figured like the sun itself, Ottilie is said to undergo the same verbal modality attributed to light in the Farbenlehre: she "suffers" Luciane's extravagant activity as she does intemperate weather. Simple in her dress, yet most beautiful, "at least in appearance," she attracts those around her independent of the temporal order or position in space in which she appears, outshining the character called light whose movements she is made to accompany. Most unlike Luciane, she arrives eclipsed in the narrative but for the reference to a single gesture whose intention is misunderstood.46</page><page sequence="21">M L N 1167 Following directly thereafter, in time and in narration, is the novel's most concisely worded interchange, so brief as to go un- noticed, vertiginous in effect when seen, which marks Eduard's first mistaking of, or passion for, Ottilie. He falsely ascribes to her a part in the discursive action: Den andern Morgen sagte Eduard zu Charlotten: Es ist ein angenehmes unterhaltendes Madchen. Unterhaltend? versetzte Charlotte mit Lacheln: sie hatja den Mund noch nicht aufgetan. So? erwiderte Eduard, indem er sich zu besinnen schein: das ware doch wunderbar! (p. 281) In the absence of any articulation on Ottilie's part, the "experi- ment" in "chosen relations" is already underway. Charlotte's cor- rection of Eduard, at this moment and others, and the narrative mediation of similar ascriptions into the form and appearance of a meaningful story, can neither compensate for nor fully explain its effect. Moreover, the story figures its knowledge of that fact. From the setting in which it takes place, a landscape arranged and rear- ranged to afford "einen vortrefflichen Anblick" (Chap. I, p. 1), to its own semantic and syntactic qualifications of vision-most nota- bly the ubiquitous appearances of the verb, "scheinen," almost mistakable for an auxiliary upon which the meaning of main verbs formally depends-the fiction refuses not to see outside itself, nor to see itself as such, as fiction. The involvement of Ottilie in the narrative promises to grant to the mobile relations into which she is drawn a closed stability of form. The motivating interest of these relations is expressed by Eduard in his early proposal to invite the Captain. More attractive than "people of the land" who have the "proper knowledge" but "communicate" it in a "confused and dishonest" manner, and "the university educated" who are schooled in communication but lack "immediate insight into the matter," is a middleman between dis- cursive and visual reliability, a friend. Eduard explains to Char- lotte: "Vom Freunde kann ich mir beides versprechen; und dann entspringen noch hundert andere Verhiltnisse daraus, die ich mich gern vorstellen mag, die auch auf dich Bezug haben und wovon ich viel Gutes voraussehe" (p. 245). Once "imagined," the occasion for a succession of relations to arise cannot be but realized. Eduard's repeated and futile attempts to decline his friend at the insistence of Charlotte are narrated, much like the series of Farben- lehre "Versuche," in sequential, rather than logical, detail at the</page><page sequence="22">1168 CLAUDIA BRODSKY opening of the next chapter (pp. 249-50). The only "explanation" offered for his unsystematic behavior will prove to be the novel's greatest understatement, both of Eduard's character and its own inability to demonstrate character as conclusive: "Sich etwas zu versagen, war Eduard nicht gewohnt" (p. 249). Charlotte proves no more capable of closing the discussion of "forseen" relations. She re-opens her conversation with Eduard "possibly in the persuasion," the narrator speculates, that "discur- sive repetition" is most certain to dull the "purpose" of a particular desire (p. 250). Yet repetition, as narrated, incurs instead the sur- facing of several desires. Eduard appears transformed in speech from an "Ehemann" into a "Liebhaber," and the consideration of an additional relation, formerly denied by a "violence" directed against the self, is articulated. Through the mediation of letters which describe her, Ottilie is first mentioned to Eduard, seen as "lover": "Ich befinde mich in einer ihnlichen Lage wie du und habe mir schon eben die Gewalt angetan, die ich dir nun iber dich selbst zumute" (p. 250). Through a further exchange of letters, the Captain, and shortly after, Ottilie arrive. The "beautiful girl," whose inability to "show" her own "abilities" draws "excuse after excuse" from her headmistress (p. 251), is to function as the fourth term in an analogy whose characters are letters themselves: those drawn to illustrate the otherwise invisible principle of "Wahlver- wandtschaften." Yet the analogical bases of the relations in which Ottilie partici- pates were never fully symmetrical from the start. Their formula- tion as a scientific hypothesis had been complicated by Eduard's vision of himself ("B") "returning" to "A" (Charlotte) and "O": "'Was sollte B denn anfangen, wenn ihm C (der Hauptmann) entrissen wuirde? ... Freilich ... er kehrte zu seinem A zuriick, zu seinem A und 0!"' (p. 281). Ottilie does indeed provide "company" for Charlotte, whose proximity to Eduard has been displaced by the Captain (p. 282). On the other hand, she furthers the disruption and transformation of the relations she completes. Her actions offer the reflective condition upon which their passion can be con- sidered appropriate, the improper be called love. Over the course of transcribing Eduard's writing, the characters of her script ap- pear to change into those she copies and are understood by Eduard to evidence the uncontested and unconstated ("Ottilie shwieg") conclusion: "'Du liebst mich!'" (pp. 323-4). The recurrence of a pure form on the part of a copyist for whom form perhaps is never pure, and the very appearance of written characters is the content</page><page sequence="23">M L N 1169 to be transmitted, is seen as an intentional act of personal imitation. Shapes of notation devoid of reference are interpreted to embody the most significant of meanings. Indeed, what relation could ap- pear more significant than that of the figure of light to the man who believes she means to love him. Ottilie's presence bodily represents light in a "tableau vivant" ("Das ganze Bild war alles Licht" [p. 405]); her face reappears in the images of angels painted where she sits; her eyes, around which the appearance of her beauty revolves, convey a sense to all who see them: a phenomenal occurrence like the colors which spot our vision when we attempt to look at the sun. As notable as the em- phasis on her persuasive beauty is the absence, in the narrative, of a description of Ottilie's inner "character." The conjunction of these two conditions has been viewed by one of the novel's most sugges- tive readers, Walter Benjamin, as a transgression of narrative dis- course on Goethe's part.47 For Benjamin Ottilie personifies not the light of true meaning, the essence of the romantic topos, "die schone Seele," but its soulless appearance, "Sch6nheit" without sig- nificance. Her death is correctly noted to be equally empty of meaning since its mode-abstinence from eating-was already a way of life and offers no "discursive form" in which to be under- stood.48 Benjamin's argument approaches an explicit warning against the acceptance of a free play of appearances, as deduced by Kant to inform the experience of beauty in plastic arts, in the properly meaningful aesthetics of discursive arts. His description of the novel's form as "arabesque-like," rather than constructive ("Gestalt bauen"), also conforms to the Analytic of the Beautiful in the Third Critique.49 Yet the inconsequent "world of appearances" to which Benjamin refers Die Wahlverwandtschaften, seen to be centered upon Ottilie's silent visibility, fails to account for the novel as a form which mediates the sight of its own center-be it of beauty as an immedi- ate, non-discursive phenomenon, of eyes which seem to speak upon being seen, or of the cryptic and literally concealed content of a Tagebuch-into the fictional development of a story. Its story is an hypothesis of the "Bildern," or images, the novel beholds. Vision of Ottilie is always transformed by narration, as it is by the narrative's characters, into an understanding of its consequences: the ap- pearance of "Taten und Leiden des Lichts," transposed by their sequential, discursive explanation into a theorizing of the same. Moreover, the narrative includes its own explanatory fiction. The actions and passions Ottilie evokes and undergoes are themselves</page><page sequence="24">1170 CLAUDIA BRODSKY effects, it is revealed, of a narrative overheard. Ottilie's own path of motion, or "Bahn," that which has shaped the context of her rela- tions with others, had been shaped by her formalizing conception of a story told of her life. Arising from apparent slumber after Otto is declared dead, Ottilie acknowledges the significance of a similar moment following her own mother's death when, aware of move- ment, especially of speech, but unable and unwilling to move or express herself, neither sleeping nor awake but lying "dormant," she "grasped" or "comprehended" Charlotte's narration of her "fate": "Damals sprachst du mit einer Freundin fiber mich; du bedauertest mein Schicksal, als eine arme Waise in der Welt geblieben zu sein; du schil- dertest meine abhangige Lage und wie miBlich es um mich stehen k6nne, wenn nicht ein besonderer Gliickstern fiber mich walte. Ich faBte alles wohl und genau, vielleicht zu streng, was du fur mich zu wiinschen, was du von mir zu fordern schienst. Ich machte mir nach meinen be- schrinkten Einsichten hieriiber Gesetze; nach diesen habe ich lange gelebt, nach ihnen war mein Tun und Lassen eingerichtet ... "Aber ich bin aus meiner Bahn geschritten, ich habe meine Gesetze gebrochen, ich habe sogar das Gefiihl derselben verloren, und nach einem schrecklichen Ereignis klarst du mich wieder meinen Zustand auf, der jamervoller ist als der erste. . ." (p. 462) The course taken by a character serving as a narrative per- sonification of light is predicated upon a narrative personifying her as "poor" and "left parentless on earth;" portraying her "situation" as "dependent," prone to general misfortune, and in need of the rule of a "lucky star." Ottilie's appearance within the novel could be said to carry out all of these representations, or just as "fully and exactly," none. The story which names Ottilie as its object, and Ottilie's own understanding of its narrator's "apparent desires and requirements," are figurations of occurrences whose justice cannot be appraised. Something of their sense, however, emerges in their enactment for a second time. For Ottilie reveals to Charlotte the "secret of the movement of her life" (p. 464) upon perceiving what appears to be a repetition of"the same" (p. 462): Charlotte's expla- nation of how she is to live. This second "enlightenment" informs Ottilie's decision to withdraw from her relation to Eduard. In light of the intervening events, its fundamental misunderstanding of Ottilie's status is clear. Charlotte observes and hypothesizes: "Und betrachten Sie nur diese ungliickliche Schlummernde! Ich zittere vor dem Augenblicke, wenn sie aus ihrem halben Totenschlaf zum</page><page sequence="25">M L N 1171 BewuBtsein erwacht. Wie soil sie leben, wie soil sie sich trosten, wenn sie nicht hoffen kann, durch ihre Liebe Eduarden das zu ersetzen, was sie als Werkzeug des wunderbarsten Zufalls geraubt hat? . .." (pp. 460-1) The loss to be felt by Eduard of a son he wishes he never had is imagined by Charlotte by mistake. The intentionality of that mis- conception is again available to question. Charlotte's reference to Ottilie's present state of unconsciousness (also mistaken), and the sudden non-sequitor ending her speech: "An mich darf in diesem Augenblick nicht gedacht werden," may be viewed as indications of her own unconscious desire to be overheard and provoke the re- sponse she receives. The hand played by Ottilie in Otto's drowning is open, of course, to similar suspicions. But once an interpretation based on intentionality is assumed to explain the characters' ac- tions, the actions are themselves limited to their understanding in terms of character. The hermeneutic circle here described is dis- credited by Goethe, as discussed above, in the "Vorwort" to the Farbenlehre, in which investigations of "human character" in itself are explained to be in vain since character is only made perceivable in actions. The action in which Charlotte's false apprehension re- sults is the positing of Ottilie as "substitution" for Otto: a substitu- tion viewed to be of necessity and improbable adequacy. From the premise of that postulate, by which lives are figurally exchanged, a diachronic narrative of modality ensues: "Wie soll sie leben, wie . . ." The fiction of an objective basis for Ottilie's relation to Ed- uard replaces the former representation of her absolute depen- dency, and gives rise to the formulation of new internal "laws." Thus the very movements of the novel's own "ungraspable" "Urphanomen" are colored by their imaging into the form of a causal narration. In order for Ottilie, an "orphan" on earth, to be related, her presence must be purposefully contained within a "path," broken as unintended relations arise. Light is figured, and its surrounding phenomena illuminated, by a limiting of "understanding" or "in- sight"; its participation within a story is made possible by the "self-imposition" of limits as rule of "law." The Farbenlehre, a series of experiments in objective appearances, posits rules com- prehending "all residual visible evidence." The "norm and guideline" for the vision of empirical color are, by ironical author- ity, the colors of vision (or "physiological colors"). A study of phenomenality models its own requirements upon the perception of false appearances: colors whose "objectivity" arises in the eye.</page><page sequence="26">1172 CLAUDIA BRODSKY Like the "character" of light and the "theory" of colors we see, speech or language must abide by its own "laws" before being shaped into a story, or made to perform as mediation. Phenomenal objects may be identified as human or in nature, the relations which figure them, as chosen or given. Necessarily non-phenome- nal, however, are the rules according to which they are identified at all. As the means of constructing any relations these rules must also function exclusive of choice. They govern the making of meaning without regard to making sense, operate universally, rather than by election, and irrespective of the content of their constituency. Their power can only be considered violent (or beneficent) by the abuse of being envisioned, i.e., attributed with a content, design, or purpose of its own. Effective like the force of motion itself, or the movement between the syntactic patterning of words, they are infi- nitely transformable, capable of conveyance, and unmindful of their semantic consequences. They are therefore all the more at- tractive to theoretical hypothesis and mediation: "experiments" in language endeavoring to render the strictness of its conventions significant. Since their own modality, however, is the very one they investigate, these "Versuche" can never be objectively controlled. The "natural science" of color finally defines itself as a system based on inherent, investigative error. The failure of those en- gaged in "Wahlverwandtschaften" to understand or mend their ways may be seen as the consequence of original errors of passion. Yet the occasion for the novel to end, for the movements of light on earth to cease, is given by the motion of discourse itself. Talking within the circle of friends, Mittler comes upon his favorite subject, or "Lieblingsmaterien": the "barbaric" status of "prohibitive laws and institutions" (p. 481). Compelled to mediate the rules upon which human relations are founded, he cannot choose to begin or end his speech. At this moment, like many others ("stets, sobald er AnlaB fand"), he is "overpowered" or forced "to express the rea- soning" of mediation, "acting," by speaking, to immediate and un- intended effect:50 Brach nun einmal unter Freunden seine Rede los, wie wir schon ofter gesehen haben, so rollte sie ohne Riicksicht fort, verletzte oder heilte, nutzte oder schadete, wie es sich gerade ffigen mochte. 481) Autonomous and without hindsight, the activity of mediation is carried away by its means. The story is kept moving in the same manner. Knowingly named "a novel" by its author, Die Wahlver- wandtschaften renders its narrative voice the unrelenting vehicle of</page><page sequence="27">M L N 1173 its own enterprise-that of the "reasoning" of mediation as literary form. After death, the narrator continues, Ottilie's inanimate body is imagined to move and address; its beauty attracts seekers of meaning in droves. Eduard dies, is placed next to Ottilie, and the permanence of their position forseen by donations to the church on Charlotte's part: "Stiftungen" of the very type which her previ- ous clearing of gravestones had caused to be withdrawn, and whose intentional purpose she had attempted to prove senseless (Part II, Ch. 1, pp. 361-5). Finally, the narrative cannot rest without positing the moment, of no greater duration than the glance of an eye ("Augenblick"), when the lovers who "rest" or lie idle "near each other" are to "awake together again" (p. 490). The story which began by naming a referent "Eduard" and then saying that it is doing so: "---so nennen wir einen reichen Baron ... ," proceeds along its path past the replacement of a name with an hypothesis of meaning: "und wie er in Gedanken an die Heilige eingeschlafen war, so konnte man wohl ihn selig nennen" (p. 490 [my emphasis]). The story the narrative tells of the "colors" it sees, the fiction Goethe properly referred to as "relations of choice," keeps the novel, like Mittler, talking for too long. Yale University NOTES 1 One noteworthy exception to the use of the technical term as the novel's title is the first French translation of Die Wahlverwandtschaften: Ottilie; ou le pouvoir de la sympathie (trans. Breton [Paris: Veuve le Petit, 1819]). 2 The Grimm Deutsches Worterbuch offers the following definitions of the word: 1) in der chemie die eigenschaft zweier korpern, von denen der eine oder beide anderweit verbunden sind, sich zu vereinigen, affinitas electiva ... 2) das wort ist, insofern den korpern eine wohl zugeschrieben wird, von menschlichen verhaltnissen hergenommen und erregte als solches Goethes aufmerksamkeit... In connection with the first definition, Grimm's cites Albertus Magnus as the first to use the term, followed by Galileo, Geoffrey (1718) and Torbern Bergman (De Attractionibus Electivis, 1775; trans., 1782). Following the second definition a series of remarks by Goethe on the meaning of the term is cited, including the following observations in conversation with Riemer: "hier ist eine trennung, eine neue zusammensetzung entstanden und man glaubt sich nunmehr berechtigt, sogar das wort wahlverwandtschaft an- zuwenden, weil es wirklich aussieht als wenn ein verhaltnis dem andern vor- gezogen, eins vor dem andern erwahlt wirde ... in diesem fahren lassen und ergreifen, in diesem fliehen und suchen, glaubt man wirklich eine hohere bestimmung zu sehen; man traut solchen wesen eine art von wollen und wahlen zu, und halt das kunstwort verwandtschaften fur vollkommen</page><page sequence="28">1174 CLAUDIA BRODSKY gerechtfertigt... so halte ich es doch fur ein gliick,... dass diese natur- und wahlverwandtschaften unter uns eine vertrauliche mittheilung beschleuni- gen ... While describing the justice of applying the term's significance in natural sci- ence to human relations, Goethe carefully qualifies his observations ("man glaubt sich nunmehr berechtfertigt;" "weil es wirklich aussieht als;" "glaubt man wirklich;" "man traut ... und halt ... fur vollkommen gerechtfertigt;" "so halte ich es doch fur ein gliick;" "eine vertraulich mittheilung beschleunigen"), thereby maintaining the question of the propriety of the term's usage in either realm in an unresolved state of suspension. 3 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Die Wahlverwandtschaften in Goethes Werke Bd.6, ed. Benno von Wiese (Hamburg: Christian Wegner Verlag, 1955), p. 269. 4 I state "claims" because it is not clear at this moment, like so many others of structural significance in the novel, whether what is reported actually did occur. Charlotte's statement directly follows the narrator's description of Eduard's ex- treme discomfort at having his recitations accompanied by an on-reader: "Eine seiner besonderen Eigenheiten, die er jedoch vielleicht mit mehrern Menschen teilt, war die, daB es ihm unertraglich fiel, wennjemand ihm beim Lesen in das Buch sah" (p. 269). On this particular occasion, the narrator continues, since there were "three" present (he, Charlotte, and the Captain), and his reading did not "have a view towards" the "excitement of feeling" or the "imaginative power," Eduard's customary "precaution" against such an occurrence was "unnecessary." Nevertheless, or because he cannot be too cautious enough, "als er sich nachlas- sig gesetzt hatte, . . . Charlotte ihm in das Buch sah" (p. 269). Eduard's highly charged rebuke, notably constituted of metaphors which substitute inanimate objects for parts and the whole of his own person ("Das Geschriebene, das Gedruckte tritt an die Stelle meines eigenen Sinnes, meines eigenen Herzens ... ein Fensterchen vor meiner Stirn, vor meiner Brust angebracht ... Wenn mir jemand ins Buch sieht, so ist mir immer, als wenn ich in zwei Stiicke gerissen wiirde." [p. 269]), is followed by the narrator's description of Charlotte's "talent" for neutralizing "lively" discussion (p. 270). It is in the context of attempting to change the tone and direction of Eduard's speech, introduced by a petition for sure pardon ("'Du wirst mir meinen Fehler gewiB verzeihen"' [p. 270]), that she refers to a mistaken reference on her part. While the actual validity of the latter error cannot be constated, it serves sequentially to replace a former error (that of on-reading) as its excuse. 5 "Ich horte von Verwandtschaften lesen, und da dacht ich ebengleich an meine Verwandten, an ein paar Vettern, die mir gerade in diesem Augenblick zu schaffen machen. Meine Aufmerksamkeit kehrt zu deiner Vorlesung zuriick; ich hore, daB von ganz leblosen Dingen die Rede ist, und blickte dir ins Buch, um mich wieder zurechtzufinden" (Ibid., p. 270). 6 Ibid., p. 270. 7 Ibid., p. 270. 8 A relation between the two works has been suggested by Hans Reiss in his introduction to the Blackwell edition of Die Wahlverwandtschaften (Oxford, 1971). In discussing the technical meaning of the novel's title, Reiss notes "the impact of Goethe's scientific studies and the affinity of the novel to Zur Farbenlehre (the theory of Colours), Goethe's principal scientific treatise . ." (p. xv). Whether by intention or coincidence, Reiss' use of the word "affinity" here both repeats the problem posed by Goethe's "chosen" title, and expands its, interestingly, to include its "relation" with the "color theory." A connection along rhetorical lines between the works has been indicated by Thomas Fries (Die Wirklichkeit der Literatur [Tiibingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1975]), but remains undeveloped in his study. Working within a loosely decon-</page><page sequence="29">M L N 1175 structionalist framework, Fries concludes that Goethe's somewhat mystified "goal" in the Farbenlehre was the founding of an "organic of speech" (p. 84). In discussing the novel Fries displays his own mystification before the figure of Ottilie, who represents for him, simultaneously and unproblematically, both "'ein naturliches Leben"' (in Hegel's words [p. 129] and an "Allegorie der Kunst" (p. 128). 9 Cf. perhaps the most insightful of Wittgenstein's posthumously published Re- marks on Colour, #135 (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Remarks on Colour, ed. G. E. M. Anscombe, trans. Linda L. McAlister and Margarete Schattle [Berkeley: Univ. of Calif. Press, 1978], p. 34e: "A natural history of colours would have to report on their occurrence in nature, not on their essence. Its propositions would have to be temporal ones." Wittgenstein's late occupation with color takes Goethe's Farben- lehre as its direct predecessor. Of particular interest is his suggestion of the latter's relevance to cognitive theory in another observation elucidating the term "nature" used above: "Someone who agrees with Goethe finds that Goethe cor- rectly recognized the nature of colour. And here 'nature' does not mean a sum of experiences with respect to colours, but it is to be found in the concept of colour" (#125, p. 32e). 10 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, "Vorwort," Zur Farbenlehre (Werke, op. cit., Bd.13, pp. 315-6). 11 See, "Die Aufnahme von Goethes Farbenlehre," by Rilke Wankmuller in the Naturwissenschaftlichen Schriften (Ibid., Bd.13, pp. 610-15), including Helmholtz's objection, "daB Goethe der Natur wie einem Kunstwerk entgegengetreten sei und die Gesetze der Natur in sinnlicher Form gesehen habe, das Gesetz selber jedoch nicht gesucht habe," and Du Bois-Reymond's condemnation of the Far- benlehre as "'totgeborene Spielerei eines autodidaktischen Dilettanten,' der vor allem 'der Begriff der Kausalitat fehle" (pp. 614, 615). Cf. also the internally contradictory, but no less interesting, defense of "Goethe's science" from its consideration as science, in Heinrich Henel's "Type and Proto-Phenomenon in Goethe's Science," PMLA 71 (1956). 12 For the novel's reception by its contemporaries, see: Ibid., Bd.6, notes by Benno von Wiese, pp. 621-45; the negative response it received in America is described by F. Wahr in Emerson and Goethe (Ann Arbor: George Wahr, 1915): "Of all Goethe's works that which was most misunderstood and subjected to the most abusive criticism was doubtless the 'Elective Affinities' . .." (pp. 111-12). The study, itself an abusively non-critical reading of both Emerson and Goethe, summarizes the rejection by the American Transcendentalists of the "morally harmful import" of Goethe's "realism"-its representation of "the true" in contra-distinction to "the good"-while attempting to gloss that perception by stressing the particular cultural biases and linguistic difficulties which might account for a failure to recognize Goethe's "moral heroism." The interpretation of the novel by contemporary Goethe scholars, concerned primarily with the identification of its affiliations within the Goethe canon, is reviewed by Barnes in Goethe's Die Wahlverwandtschaften (London: Oxford, 1967), pp. 14-26. 13 See, in particular: Paul Stocklein, "Stil und Sinn der Wahlverwandtschaften" im Wege zum spdten Goethe, 2nd. ed.

Cit., pp. 621-26, and</page><page sequence="30">1176 CLAUDIA BRODSKY Conversations with Eckermann (New York: Dunne, 1901), pp. 63, 166-7, 295-6, and especially 212 (May 6, 1829), beginning with a comparison to Faust: "The only production of greater extent, in which I am conscious of having labored to set forth a pervading idea, is probably my "Wahlverwandtschaf- ten." This novel has thus become comprehensible to the understanding; but I will not say that it is therefore better. I am rather of the opinion, that the more incommensurable, and the more incomprehensible to the understand- ing, a poetic production is, so much the better it is." 14 Indeed, the fact that Die Wahlverwandtschaften was written as a novel (explicitly entitled, when first announced for publication in 1808, "Die Wahlver- wandtschaften, ein Roman"-Wiese, Ibid., p. 621), rather than as a "kleine Er- zihlung" or "Novelle," as Goethe is reputed to have originally planned, has itself proved problematic for its critics. Unlike the necessarily economic constructions of the latter genres, the indefinite relation between form and content implied in the designation, "Roman," has prompted critics to restrict or modify the appli- cation of the term to Die Wahlverwandtschaften by specifying, with notable variety, what kind of "Roman" it is. Barnes lists some critical typifications of the novel and suggests the problems inherent in each, but then goes full-circle to classify it as "Novelle-like": It is not easy to fit Die Wahlverwandtschaften into any one of the usual German categories of the novel, if we wish to refine on Goethe's own descrip- tion of it: "ein Roman." It is generally accepted that Ottilie is the heroine, but the reader is denied insight into her state of mind in Part I, and in Part II is confronted with her sudden intuitions and the mysterious pictorial style of the conclusion; a state of affairs which scarcely favours the use of the term "Entwicklungsroman." Borcherdt's employment of the word "Ereignisro- man" is difficult to match with the great importance of the Journal. The use of the term "Gesellschaftsroman," which Solger's interpretation might seem to justify, is invalidated by the restriction of the main characters to Edward's estate; although Goethe's remark to Riemer: "Er iuBerte seine Idee bei dem neuen Roman, 'Die Wahlverwandtschaften' sei: soziale Verhaltnisse und die Conflikte derselben symbolisch gefaBt darzustellen," would seem to support Solger, providing "symbolisch gefaBt" is disregarded. It is not a confessional work: although Goethe appears to treat it as such, the use of a narrator precludes the term "Erkenntnisroman." It has often been regarded as an "Eheroman" and marriage, not love, mistakenly conceived to be the main theme of the novel. The German description which takes account of most of its features seems to be "ein novellistischer Roman," (Barnes, op. cit., pp. 5, 13-4). In qualifying the status of Goethe's novel in terms of its form ("novellis- tischer") and to the exclusion of its content, Barnes moves further away from the problem, presented by Die Wahlverwandtschaften, of the novel as form. More importantly, the question of why we should "wish to refine on Goethe's own description," "ein Roman," is not even recognized as such, but merely assumed as a probability. To pose that question is to suggest that the novel impels its typification, and that each attempt will be to some extent in error; in other words, that the understanding of the novel's events outside the novel-by its critics-are also represented by those events: as described in this essay, by errant passions made legible as figurations. 15 Fritz Seidel, Goethe gegen Kant (Berlin: Altberliner Verlag, 1949), p. 55. 16 Goethes Farbenlehre, ed.

For Goethe on "method" see Maximen 436, 553, 631, and especially 551: "Cartesius schrieb sein Buch de Methodo einige Male um, und wie esjetzt liegt, kann es uns doch nichts helfen. Jeder der eine Zeitlang auf dem redlichen Forschen verharrt, muB seine Methode umandern" (Ibid., p. 440). 22 See: Matthaei, op. cit., for full-color copies accompanying specific experiments. 23 "...

A first draft of"Der Versuch als Vermittler von Objekt und Subjekt" was sent to Schiller in 1798; it was later published by Goethe in the journal, Zur Naturwissenschaft iiberhaupt (1823). 25 Ibid., p. 20. 26 Goethes Werke, Bd.12, pp. 462-3 (Maximen, 687, 689). 27 "Gewisse Farben sind gewissen Geschopfen eigen . ." (Matthaei, op. cit., p. 14). 28 Goethe uses this term to designate our recognition of "original phenomena," whose appearance empiricism cannot account for: Wenn ich mich beim Urphanomen zuletzt beruhige, so ist es doch auch nur Resignation; aber es bleibt ein groBer Unterschied, ob ich mich an den Grenzen der Menschheit resigniere oder innerhalb einer hypothetischen Beschranktheit meines bornierten Individuums (20) (Goethes Werke, Bd. 12 p. 367). 29 "Je weiter man in der Erfahrung fortriickt, desto naher kommt man dem Uner- forschlichen;je mehr man die Erfahrung zu nutzen weiB, desto mehr sieht man, daB das Unerforschliche keinen praktischen Nutzen hat (299). "Das schonste Gliick des denkenden Menschen ist, das Erforschliche erforscht zu haben und das Unerforschliche ruhig zu verehren" (718) (Ibid., pp. 406, 467). 30 Goethes Werke, Bd.13, p. 325. 31 Diese sind es, die als Anfang und Ende aller Farbenlehre bei unserm Vortrag vorangestellt worden, die auch wohl nach und nach ihrem ganzen Wert und Wiirde anerkannt und anstatt daB man sie vorher als fluchtige Augenfehler betrachtete, nunmehr als Norm und Richtschnur alles ubrigen Sichtbaren festgehalten werden (Matthaei, op. cit., p. 40). 32 "Denn eigentlich sollte der Schreibende ... die Phanomene ... als Text erst anschaulich machen . ."

("Wie die Erscheinung von bedeutenden Menschen in irgendeinem Kreise niemals ohne Folge bleiben kann" [p. 412].) 39 The brief life of the "nouveau roman" may serve to indicate as much, although the sense of a story was never fully excluded from that experiment in randomly sequential narrative. 40 Other narratives, such as histories and biographies, often approach the novel in discursive effect; in as far as it is their function to claim fidelity to their referent, and that causality inheres not in narration but in the designated occurrences themselves, they fall short of the novel as history and biography. 41 Goethes Werke, op. cit., Bd.6, p. 255 (all quotations following from that edi- tion). 42 The ruling "power of imagination," which is to make itself visible in Otto, the offspring of an improperly imagined union, is referred to specifically by the narrator: In der Lampendammerung sogleich behauptete die innre Neigung, be- hauptete die Einbildungskraft ihre Rechte uiber das Wirkliche: Eduard hielt nur Ottilien in seinen Armen, Charlotten schwebte der Hauptmann naher oder ferner vor der Seele, und so verwebten, wundersam genug, sich Ab- wesendes und Gegenwartiges reizend und wonnevoll durcheinander (p. 321). 43 Parallel occurrences are said in the Farbenlehre to mark our awareness of the language of phenomenal relations in nature (see n. 23, this essay): "Diese allgemeinen Bewegungen und Bestimmungen werden wir auf die verschie- denste Weise gewahr ... jedoch immer als verbindend oder trennend, das Dasein bewegend und irgendeine Art von Leben bef6rdend" (Goethes Werke, Op. Cit., Bd.13, p. 316). 44 "Versuch" is used in a properly scientific context, although predicated in dis- tinctly discursive terms, by the Captain in explaining "Wahlverwandtschaften" to Charlotte: "Sobald unser chemisches Kabinett ankommt, wollen wir Sie ver- schiedene Versuche sehen lassen, die sehr unterhaltend sind und einen besseren Begriff geben als Worte, Namen und Kunstausdriicke" (p. 273). It was previ- ously used by Charlotte, however, in reference to the initiation of "Wahlver- wandtschaften" as an experiment in human relations. Describing herself as no longer able to resist Eduard's desire to invite the Captain, she posits: "'LaB uns den Versuch machen!' "-a command which she then qualifies in terms of time: "'Das einzige, was ich dich bitte: es sei nur auf kurze Zeit angesehen"' (p. 256). 45 The misnomer in the novel of "Luciane" is noted by Paul Stocklein, yet viewed as an ambiguity inherent in nature and dependent for its meaning on man: "Die Natur ist zweideutig. Es ist am Menschen, wozu sie in ihm wird" (St6cklein, "Einfuhrung in die Wahlverwandtschaften, Op. Cit., p. 711). 46 Ottilie literally re-enacts an earlier time in her life, and is interpreted, according to convention, as expressing humility: ... das liebe Kind eilte, sich (Charlotten) zu nahern, warf sich ihr zu FuBen und umfaBte ihre Kniee. "Wozu die Demiitigung!" sagte Charlotte, die einigermaBen verlegen war und sie aufheben wollte. "Es ist so demutig nicht gemeint," versetzte Ottilie, die in ihrer vorigen Stellung blieb. "Ich mag mich nur so gern jener Zeit erinnern, da ich noch nicht hoher reichte bis an Ihre Kniee und Ihrer Liebe schon so gewiB war" (p. 281).</page><page sequence="33">M L N 1179 47 ... in (Ottiliens Dasein) bleibt wirklich Schonheit das Erste und Wesentlichste ... In der Tat sind in Ottiliens Gestalt die Grenzen der Epik gegen die Malerei uiberschritten. Denn die Erscheinung des Schonen als das wesentlichen Gehal- tes in einem Lebendigen liegt jenseits des epischen Stoffkreises. Und doch steht sie im Zentrum des Romans. Denn es ist nicht zu viel gesagt, wenn man die Uberzeugung von Ottiliens Schonheit als Grundbedingung fur den Anteil am Roman bezeichnet (Benjamin, Op. Cit., pp. 178-9). 48 Kein sittlicher EntschluB kann ohne sprachliche Gestalt, und streng genommen ohne darin Gegenstand der Mitteilung geworden zu sein, ins Leben treten. Daher wird, in dem vollkommenen Schweigen der Ottilie, die Moralitat des Todeswillens, welcher sie beseelt, fragwurdig. Ihm liegt in Wahrheit kein Ent- schluB zugrunde sondern ein Trieb. Daher ist nicht, wie sie es zweideutig auszus- prechen scheint, ihr Sterben heilig. Wenn sie aus ihrer "Bahn" geschritten sich erkennt, so kann dies Wort in Wahrheit einzig heiBen, daB nur der Tod sie vor dem innern Untergange bewahren kann. Und so ist er wohl Suhne im Sinne des Schicksals, nichtjedoch die heilige Entsuhnung, welche nie derfreie, sondern nur der gottlich fiber ihn verhangte Tod dem Menschen werden kann (Ibid., p. 176 [my emphasis]). Most interesting in Benjamin's formulation here is his confusion of "Trieb" (drive, or instinct) with "freedom": "Trieb" is followed and substi- tuted by "der freie Tod." 49 "In dieser (Schonheit) darf die deutsche Dichtung keinen Schritt uiber Goethe hinaus wagen, ohne gnadenlos einer Scheinwelt anheimzufallen" (Ibid., p. 182). "In dem Roman baut diese (die Form) nicht sowohl Gestalten, welche oft genug aus eigener Machtvollkommenheit formlos als mythische sich einsetzen, auf, als daB sie zaghaft, gleichsam arabeskenhaft um jene spielend, vollendet und mit hochstem Recht sie auflost" (Ibid., p. 180). 50 The capability inhering in speech to present a pertinence to its listeners (in this instance, an unseen listener, Ottilie) which, while not intended, not even known, is nonetheless direct in effect was commented upon in the narrative after the relation of life lived in transit given by the visiting Lord: "Man miite ganz in Gesellschaft schweigen, wenn man nicht manchmal in den Fall kommen sollte; denn nicht allein bedeutende Bemerkungen, sondern die trivialsten AuBerungen konnen auf eine so miBklingende Weise mit dem Interesse der Gegenwartigen zusammentreffen" (pp. 433-4). The problem of regular articu- lation indicated here is the very possibility that it may be encountered, un- soundly, as relevant ("auf eine so miBklingende Weise mit dem Interesse ... zusammentreffen"). The perceivable disturbance caused by the Englishman's self-description is next to be offset by a story concerning others. It is told by his travelling companion and included within the novel under its own title and generic headings: "Die Wunderlichen Nachbarkinder"; "Novelle" (p. 434). Al- though appearing as a full-blown fiction, the story brings about greater agitation on Charlotte's part ("Der Erzahlende ... bemerken muBte, daB Charlotte h6chst bewegt sei" [p. 442]), an occurrence understandably suggested by the similarity between the passion of the narrated "Nachbarkinder" and that of Ottilie and Eduard or Charlotte and Eduard, lovers present and past. The narrator, we realize, cannot have known what he was saying; but little do we realize our own ignorance. For the tale is in basis true ("wirklich zugetragen" [p. 442]) and evokes uneasiness not by bringing others indirectly to mind but because it en- forces a literal referent of which it has no knowledge: the Captain, known to Charlotte as the actual subject of its narrated events.</page></plain_text>
