<plain_text><page sequence="1">Carricferotun anb imire Otones!. The Abb? Breuil's comments in a Presidential Address. We were very interested to find references to both Carrickrobin Stone and the scribed rock near Tinure in a presidential address given by the famous expert, Abb? Breuil, to the Prehistoric Society of England last year. It appears in full in the Proceedings of that Society. Abb? Breuil believes that many of the ancient carvings are anthropomorphic, or delineate, in a convention more or less stylised, the human figure or face. He gives illustrations of very many from different lands and continents. For instance the pairs of single or double lined ovals or circles so often found on Bronze Age stones, he regards as formally representing a human face by means of the eyes. The rudimentary markings on the Rock in Tinure townland, he copies from Du Noyer's drawing. WTe hope in our next number to give a rubbing and photographs recently made of this unusual and ancient monument, on which are markings differing from what was visible to Du Noyer. Some of this class of inscribed marks, Breuil equates with stylised figures of human beings. He includes a drawing of the Carrickrobin stone of which he says :?" It seems to be a menhir statue divided into two storeys by a groove ; the top is occupied by a group of two eyes, circles, and a spiral between the two ; one eye is entirely hollowed and with no spot in the centre, and the other simply a ring with a spot ; some traces of eyebrows, with a separation between them, are seen above each. The middle of the stone is occupied by a concentric circle traced four times with a central spot, open at the base so as not to encroach on an arched head drawn in double lines surrounding two eyes, which seems to have a vaguely indicated bust continuing below. To the right is another circle in which is a round head with two eyes, showing the arms raised above it ; the whole rests on a triangular base in relief representing the robe of the Almerian idols and those in the Spanish paintings. To the left is a circle with only a central dot and an axial stroke for the body, with indication of the legs : a line of spots exists between the two circles." Under the illustration is the following :?" On top is a face, with in the middle a whirl, perhaps indicating the breath. Below a horizontal groove for separation, are grouped four other human figures, two with the two eyes quite clear and some indication of the nose : one is of the Almerian type, with triangular skirt, the arms making a ring around the head ; another head bigger, is a concentric ring with only a central spot ; a fourth at the left, has a vertical stroke for the body, with two short legs."</page><page sequence="2">ICO COUNTY LOUTH ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL Abb? Breuil compares the stone with that at King's Mountain, Co. Meath, where very clear double eyes with eyebrows and a nose-line appear at the top of the stone, while lower down are spirals and paired concentric circles. He concludes that in these instances after the erection of the menhir in honour of the memory of some person, elementary human faces continued to be cut on it by succeeding generations. The illustration given is a very careful diagram made from the photograph reproduced in this journal. The appearance of a triangular Almerian skirt is a trick of the lighting rather than an actual part of the carving. Dr. Mahr having examined the stone for me in the National Museum writes that it is not possible to detect any trace of this or of a lower marking on this part of the stone which is very rough and broken. Many people have tried to formulate explanations of these ancient and some times apparently haphazard markings, and viewing one stone or even those of one country, these "explanations" must always, to the ordinary man, seem rather far fetched. But they are no more so than the common pseudo-traditions of devil's hoof marks, giant's finger prints, saint's knee prints, which the ordinary man has invented for himself and his fellows to explain natural hollows in rocks or stones. When, however, a savant such as Abb? Breuil with experience over many countries and with long consideration, brings together a large series of markings showing what may be the evolution or degradation of one symbol into others, showing evidence for his theory, and when he states them as his considered opinions, they are entitled to our respect and careful examination. His general conclusion is that " important relations existed between Iberia and Ireland, which, by the erection of funerary monuments, and some types of jewellery and arms, formed an artistic background of conventional design which had a re markable development." These influences crossed the British Isles to Scandinavia where they were mixed with Asiatic elements. The Ibero-Irish art reached the coast of Brittany but not its interior. We wonder whether Co. Louth can boast of the only stone having carved on it a representation of a prehistoric breath ! H. G. Tempest.</page></plain_text>
