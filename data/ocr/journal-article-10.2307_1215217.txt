Thomas Lanion, a mari- ner, and Thomas Cushing, a local cordwainer, held in common a house and land on Fish Street in the port town's North End. Eager to partition the property fairly, Lanion and Cushing paid a lo- cal surveyor to make a plat of the house and to mark clearly the subdivision of each floor on the drawing. The resulting plan is noteworthy in sev- eral respects (fig. 1). Because it faced north onto Fish Street, its "backsides" sloped down to the wharves along the North End's shoreline; place- ment adjacent to the waterside probably accounts for the way the different floors are articulated. The top three seem clear enough: a "Garret Sto- rey" above all; next, the "Chamber Storey"; and then the "Low Room Storey level with the Street" in front. Beneath this "Low Room" came the "Kitchen Storey Level wth the Backside," which was at grade in the rear to the "backsides" and a small "porch" at the structure's rear elevation. As at merchant Robert Howard's house (the Paul Revere house) in Boston's North Square of about 168o, cooking here was likely done below grade.' Finally, beneath the kitchen was an excavated "Cellar Storey." The section at the west (or left) of each plan was the part that Lanion received; Robert Blair St. George is Associate Professor and Graduate Chair in the Department of Folklore and Folklife at the University of Pennsylvania.

In each plan, the rooms at left of central dividing line were granted to Lanion, those at right to Cushing. the right side was Cushing's portion. Yet what seems most remarkable about this drawing is how effectively it abstracts the "house" from any local surroundings, representing it as a series of dis- crete levels, as an emblem of the material life that the two Bostonians shared at the turn of the eigh- teenth century. Material life is a term that has been used by eco- nomic and social historians and students of mate- rial culture at least since Fernand Braudel intro- duced the term in the first edition of Civilisation Mat&amp;ielle et Capitalisme (XVe-XVIIIe Siecle) (1967). In that seminal text, published in translation eight years later as Capitalism and Material Life, z4oo-i8oo, Braudel offered a comprehensive statement of precisely what he thought his term should include. "The expression material life," he explained, "will be deliberately used through- out this book to denote repeated actions, empiri- cal processes, old methods and solutions handed down from time immemorial, like money or the separation of town and country. It is an elemen- tary life but neither passive nor, above all, com- pletely static." Braudel had in mind a totalizing frame of historical process that encompassed the force of custom as well as new, fragmenting pat- terns of commercial capitalist exchange. And given the pivotal role that exchange and com- merce played in his work, he also noted the differ- ent temporalities that characterized material life. "It has moments of acceleration and occasionally of surprise," he claimed, while realizing that most "changes take place slowly but steadily. Money and towns play a continually increasing part and some innovations are of decisive importance."2 2 Fernand Braudel, Capitalism and Material Life, 1400-18oo, trans.

However, the earliest reference may be in a series of debates that were published in 1962 under the title "Vie Materielle et Comportements Biolo- giques." And while one of these papers was pre- pared for a seminar Braudel had taught the previ- ous year at L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes, it was also an essay that seemed to derive much of its sugges- tive energy from the journal Revue d'Historie de la Culture Materielle, which had begun in 1952, im- mediately publishing several theoretical essays that still warrant close examination today. Calls for a "new and autonomous discipline" of mate- rial culture study extend back as far as 1936 in France.3 I faced the daunting task of defining material life as an organizing rubric for American cultural studies early in 1987. After digesting what Braudel and many of his followers, including such scholars as Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie and Lucienne Roubin, had to say about it, and after thinking about the changing tides of the "New Social History" on this side of the Atlantic from when it washed ashore in the mid 196os through the first major deconstructionist critiques of the early 198os, I took the following stab at both sum- mary and translation into specifically American terms: As it was first conceived by the French historian Fer- nand Braudel, its meaning was clear. Material life is the bedrock stratum of economic life, the basis of all power derived from the elaboration and acceleration of commodity exchange. At issue in the study of mate- rial life, he maintained, "is growth in the economy of the ancien regime." Yet in America, "material life" re- mains a metaphor, its meaning imprecise. It is often used as a synonym of "material culture," and, more recently, of "material history." To clarify the utility of material life as a paradigm for American cultural stud- ies we need to reassess carefully the place of material life in Braudel's thought. To be sure, Braudel's term material life, comple- mented by material civilization, was deeply impli- cated in an attenuated theory of cultural evolu- tion that always complicated and countered his commitment to cultural Marxism. As I have noted elsewhere, Braudel maintained that while ad- vanced Western imperial states had attained a "civilized" state, primitive peoples could only lay claim to "semi-civilization" or, worse, mere "cul- ture." Within Braudel's thought, then, material civilization and material culture were by no means synonymous, although later scholars seeking to attach a more relativistic, anthropologically in- formed theory of material culture have found in Braudel one of many intellectual ancestors. Curi- ously, his concept of material life, as I have argued above, may have owed a key intellectual debt to pre-World War II theorists of la culture materielle.4 At this point, however, I am less inclined to de- rive a working concept of material life from Braudel's work than to extend a critique of the implications of seeing his work as the locus classi- cus for the historian's engagement with cultural artifacts. In this essay I mean both to chart some of the murky waters his followers might unwit- tingly enter and to suggest-with examples grounded in the same seventeenth- and eigh- teenth-century cultural landscape of Boston that Lanion and Cushing helped to build-some new directions we might consider in imagining anew the architecture of material life itself. To do so demands initially that we locate in Braudel's prose a central problematic: his selec- tion of the house as a key explanatory metaphor for his theoretical modeling of economic and so- cial structure. For despite his care to avoid de- scribing material life as standing somehow out- side of historical change, the house he used to ' See Teresa Wasowicz, "L'Histoire de la Culture Materielle en Pologne," bulletin no. 4 in debates on "Vie Materielle et Com- portements Biologiques," Annales Economies, Sociates, Civilisation 17, no.

In 1988 I summarized Braudel's use of the house metaphor as follows: At its foundation lay the constant, enduring tension between poverty and luxury that enlivened social life and sparked change. Its ground floor was material life, the level affected most by what was happening immedi- ately beneath it. Up in the first story was the market economy. Capitalism occupied the chambers in the second story, that heady realm of mobility and adapt- ability where, once the attainment of superfluity had been won through struggles taking place in the floors below, spiritual life, art, and genteel learning could flourish. In the penthouse, the house's ultimate "su- perstructure" (the word is Braudel's), were the great European market fairs of the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, where exchange in both commodi- ties and identity merged in carnivalesque rituals of so- cial inversion. At this height, the market became theater.5 The key word here is "superstructure." True, the term evokes an architectural model, but it also reveals Braudel's adherence to Marx's now critically bankrupt hierarchy of base and super- structure, or productive capital and successive lev- els of culture-as-false-consciousness built above it-the zone of "culture" that strategically masks the control of production itself. Since Braudel wrote, Raymond Williams and Pierre Bourdieu, among many others, have critiqued the separa- tion of base and superstructure in such a deter- ministic manner, arguing instead that culture it- self is a form of power, a modality of capital that constitutes relations of authority in dialogue with productive relations and not a system of masks built to conceal any "real" workings of economic property and social preference beneath. It is ad- mittedly difficult to imagine sets of social rela- tions of production, consumption, or circulation that are not, finally, culturally constituted even as they intimate their brute instrumentality. Equally troubling in Braudel's hierarchic architectural model is its frozen imagery. His house is a set of floors, stairs, and levels locked in place, conve- niently represented-perhaps in homage to his colleague Claude L&amp;vi-Strauss-as a tripartite in- tellectual structure. Looking back in the late 197os on his earlier work, Braudel worried that the term material life was too imprecise. Having in- cluded in its study those "countless inherited acts, accumulated pell-mell and repeated from time and time to this very day," Braudel then re- treated at a crucial moment. "I attempted," he reflected, "to capture all this under the conve- nient, but inaccurate-all words with too broad a meaning are inaccurate-heading 'material life.' ,6 At the same time, however, he valorized the concept by granting it precisely such analyti- cal scope. Constructed on Braudel's broad shoulders, the material metaphor of the static multistory house recalls additional elements of his disciplin- ary inheritance and methodology: his intellectual commitment to Marx, his interest in Freud's stra- tigraphy of the human psyche, and the structural anthropology of Levi-Strauss. As already noted, from Marx he drew his notion of base and super- structure, or the relative permanence of masonry in the house's cellar and the lighter, more shift- ing frame of its garret. From Freud he took the image of layered, interlocking levels for the archi- tecture of human consciousness. As Donald Kus- pit has demonstrated, Freud was a keen student of classical archaeology and drew freely on both archaeological and architectural models when theorizing the human psyche (in essays in 1905 and 1939, in particular). Freud's spatial imagina- tion was made apparent by Joseph Jastrow when, in 1932, he shaped the chapters of The House That Freud Built as follows: "Plans and Specifications," "Building Materials," and "Superstructure," among others.7 Finally, from the structural an- thropologists around Levi-Strauss, Braudel appro- 5 St. George, "Introduction," p. 4. 6 Fernand Braudel, Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism, trans.

To chart, however briefly, Braudel's intellec- tual contexts allows us to situate his concept of material life within the broader contours of his life's work. But how, in the end, does this inheri- tance help our investigation of material life in co- lonial America? For one thing, it makes us keenly aware how simple metaphors can elide massive distillations and compressions of complicated in- tellectual genealogies. The house here emerges, perhaps, as a key mnemonic, as an index and claim for the importance of structure in daily life and of the location of culture in relation to eco- nomic production and reproduction. Yet this im- age of the formal house also has limitations. It is an expensive metaphor. Braudel's insistence on its base-and-superstructure construction comes at the expense of seeing economy and art as always contingent, defined dialectically, with one not claiming priority over the other. It also denies the utility of any concept of power other than one in which underlying relations of economic produc- tion and their slow-moving transformations al- ways claim a prior determinative force. An insis- tence on structure requires that we view houses more as containers of lived experience that pulse with concrete rhythms of work and play; the ab- stract always demands an amnesia, an erasure of the phenomenology of la vie quotidienne. Finally, the Braudellian house as static representation comes at the expense of practical detail: houses here are accomplished objectifications of culture as structure, aestheticized "things" rather than living, personified processes of constant making, unmaking, and remaking. Households are less "constructs" than ongoing negotiations of power and affect. Seen in this new light, the limitations of le monde Braudellian seem clear. Cultural marx- ists have discredited the base-and-superstructure approach that was Braudel's own bedrock intel- lectual stratum. Phenomenologists and a new generation of pragmatic ethnographers have su- tured the romanticism bleeding at the core of structural anthropology. And architectural histo- rians have effectively argued that houses are more than just a convenient "set of stories"-con- ceived simultaneously as a set of floor levels and a set of narrative levels-for organizing and re- producing social life. I believe we need another set of stories, or a new architecture-both conceptual and practi- cal-of material life in early America. Such an in- tellectual edifice will admit the analytic power of earlier models but move in new directions. When we think of houses in history, the biases of the Braudellian model become apparent. Examples from the landscape of early Boston will reveal them in stark detail. One bias in Braudel's house is its total formal isolation from other spatial prac- tices in everyday life. We might term these basic practices the strategies of domestic life. Several strate- gies in seventeenth-century Boston suggest how necessary various outbuildings and wharves were in defining household space as a practical system. One such arrangement was the merchant's premise, consisting of warehouses, counting houses, cranes, and crane houses set in close proximity to the dwelling house. Often the house was across the street from the rest of the premise, which was close to the waterside. The locations of the "Dwelling house," "warehouse," "wharfe," and projecting L-shape dock on a 1693 plat of Robert Gibbs's house on Fort Hill in Boston's South End (the house was built ca. 1671) make this strategy clear (fig. 2). Merchant Benjamin Backway's South End premise is representative of many other examples (fig. 3). Included are such buildings as the house, an adjoining "closet or porch," and, across a small yard, "My Cow- house." When Backway first acquired this prop- erty from Magnus White in July 1687, it included "All that his Messuage or Tenement lying Scitu- ate in Boston aforeds[ai]d nearunto The Sconce and Fort Hill with all the Land Wharffe and Flatts belonging to the Same . . . Together with all houses edifices buildings Lands Trees Wharffes Flatts . . . etc." On the other side of a "Stone Wall" lay a smaller piece of ground, which Back- way, ambitious to expand his domestic com- pound, purchased from the Boston selectmen a decade later. Across the "passage or high way from the Town to the Sconce" lay his "hollow wharfe" (probably so called because it was con- structed on log cribbing and was "hollow" under- neath), a small area for docking watercraft, and two warehouses.8 Similar premises, though smaller in scale, were also built in Maine, where Boston's early merchants had extensive trade.

The presence of a "Cow-house" on Backway's premise indicates a second important context for dwelling houses in early Boston: agricultural sup- port buildings. References to such structures oc- cur frequently and reveal their quantity and functional range, documenting a mixture of agricultural and commercial pursuits that charac- terized this early modern colonial landscape. In October 1639, the town of Boston announced: "It is permitted to Samuel Sherman for the stand- ing of his Cow house, which he hath built upon the Common by the gate next Roxbury, untill the spring time, and then he is to and take it downe unlesse he have further leave from the Towne for the standing thereof." In March 1737, nearly a century later, one Mr. Graves, a carter in Boston's North End, had "been in his Barn to look after his horses."99 In the century between these references, many more precise descriptions of agricultural out- buildings in Boston emerge. In 1640 'James Penn conveys an house sometimes a brew house" to Nicholas Parker. In 17o8 the town granted Thomas Chamberline permission to erect an ad- dition to his house and "also another building for a Barn of 36 foot long 24 wide and 16 stud on his pasture Land on the Northwest or backside of his sd Dwelling house &amp; 1oo foot distant from the same." In October 1712 William Skinner gained permission "to Erect a Timber building for a Stable and Cow house of Twenty two foot long, eighteen feet wide, and Sixteen foot Studd to stand on his Land Fifty feet distant from the Easterly End of his Dwelling house," while in 1728 Boston shopkeeper Benjamin Landon re- ceived clearance to construct a small timber addi- tion to his dwelling house and a "small Building 9 October 28, 1639, entry in Second Book of the Record Commis- sioners of the City of Boston [Boston Town Records, 1634-1661] (Bos- ton: Rockwell and Churchill, 1877) (hereafter BTR), pp. 42-43- An earlier reference, though less precise, suggests a "cow house" as early as 1634, when the town meeting of Boston ordered "that there shalbe a little house built, and a sufficiently payled yard to lodge the Cattell in of nights att Pullen poynt necke" (BTR, p. 3, meeting of February 23, 1634/35).

As the previous citations make clear, the permits primar- ily offer detailed descriptions of dwelling houses that were either replaced entirely or extended by the additions of new rooms and kitchens. In fact, a total of 234 permits during this twenty-two-year period detail the building materials used (stone, slate, tile, brick, timber, parging), the siting of 10 Note-Book Kept by Thomas Lechford, Esq., Lawyer, in Boston, Massachusetts Bay, from June 27, r638, toJuly 29, 164.

(Massachusetts Ar- chives, Boston; Drawing, Robert Blair St. George.) buildings relative to one another (the linear dis- tance between houses and kitchens, barns, brew- houses, or bakehouses), and the precise location of the renovations undertaken (by street, inter- section, or waterfront location). But exactly how much actual living space was made available by these various types of rebuilding activities? In a table in Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay, 1625-I 725, Abbott Lowell Cummings presented 121 instances in which the linear dimensions of new houses, new additions to houses, and new kitchens were outlined in building permits." In only twenty-nine (23.9 percent) of them, how- ever, are the dimensions also provided for the ex- isting structures that the new ones were intended to replace; these examples offer detailed informa- tion on the extent to which rebuilding afforded an increase in living space (table 1). Of the twenty-nine examples, only fifteen were for dwell- ing houses per se. An additional two kitchens, two shops, two warehouses, two store houses, a "building for the screwing of hay," and five other buildings, the functions of which were unspeci- fied, constitute the remainder. Although what emerges among the houses, additions, and kitch- ens is the frequent use of rebuilding to increase the amount of actual living space (thirteen cases), rebuilding also proved in some cases (nine) to have effected a renewal of materials but not any increase. The two shops indicate an increase, but the warehouses and storehouses were rebuilt ac- cording their original plans. The timber building permits record many other structures besides dwelling houses and ad- ditions. When the detailed citations are tabu- lated, the resulting variety of agricultural service buildings is startling in an "urban" context (table 2). Buildings specified as having a single function included: barns, coach houses, cowhouses, or- chard buildings, stables, washhouses, and wood- houses-certainly as full a panoply as one might expect in rural New England during the first three decades of the eighteenth century. Yet their presence in early eighteenth-century Boston does not somehow signal the existence of commercial agriculture in the interstices of the developing port town; as early as the 1670s, Boston's swelling population and pressure on diminishing land re- sources had pushed market agriculture toward Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mount Wollaston. For this reason, references here to what seem agricul- tural buildings probably indicate their persis- tence at the level of household production.12 In- corporation of specialized buildings into the local household economy may account for structures that either had alternative functions or collapsed two functions into one: "barn or storehouse," "barn or stable," "barn and stable," "shed for woodhouse and stable," and "stable and cow- house." For each of these buildings full dimen- sions are given; therefore a full account of the square and cubic footage that these structures oc- cupied is possible to determine. In one instance the rebuilding of a barn was strategically planned to reuse materials rescued from the structure it was intended to replace.

Indeed, this one example was symptomatic of many such rebuildings-the reuse of materials is frequently cited in contracts of the period and has been discovered in surviving house frames. The reuse of materials may have even taken on sacred meanings in the construction of meeting- houses, since the timbers (posts with "shoulders" and "collar" beams) from the body of a first building were believed to carry Christ's perfec- tion into the new structure.13 " A Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston, Con- taining the Records of Boston Selectmen, o70z to 1715 (Boston: Rock- well and Churchill, 1884), p. 162.

Support structures needed by working artisans and local merchants rounded out the functional zones in which dwelling houses were actually im- plicated on a daily basis. Artisans' shops were built in a variety of sizes (table 3). In 1714, for example, Thomas Selby, a Boston perriwigmaker, was granted permission to "Erect a Shop or Building of Timber at the Easter[n]most end of Mr Butlers Row of Brick Buildings fronting to King street in Boston . . . to be twenty feet wide Thirty feet long and Twenty feet Stud." In many cases, shops were singled out as likely places where fires might break out; therefore, timber permits were issued with stern regulatory lan- guage. Selby's own shop was allowed "Provided he carry up a Brick Wall at the Easterly end and rough Cast the other end, and sides thereof, and Cover the roof with Slates, and make and main- tain Battlements on the same." The importance of artisan's shops to "urban" domestic strategies and labor processes appears undeniable; a total of forty-four shops were permitted, thirty-seven of which (84.1 percent) were specific to a trade, in- cluding the shops required for such trades as: smith, boatbuilder, goldsmith, housewright, joiner, leatherdresser, painter, pewterer, rope- maker, tanner, weaver, and wheelwright. Other references detail industrial buildings attached to some of these larger properties: "smiths shop &amp; colehouse," "storehouse for blacksmith," the "Workhouse of 40 feet long 20 wide &amp; 23 Stud with a Flatt on the Top of the Roof' built in 1715 by leatherdresser David Colson, or the "Horse Mill for the making of Linseed Oyl" erected by painter Edward Pell in 1726.14 Finally, Boston's landscape in the early eighteenth century was in Colonial New England Culture (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1997), chap. 2. 4 Timber building permits, pp. 213, 223-24.</page><page sequence="11">Afterthoughts on Material Life 11 Table 3.

Contemporary drawings made in the Suffolk County Deeds detail these buildings more pre- cisely. Joseph Cowell, a Boston cordwainer, had a house and shop on the north side of Newbury Street in Boston's South End. Upon his death in early 17o9, his four children entered a protracted battle over his remaining estate, despite the fact that his will clearly stated that "All that my Dwell- ing-house or houses &amp; Land thereunto Adjoin- ing &amp; belonging, to be Equally divided among them."'5 The problem seems to have been that his eldest son and namesake, Joseph, a black- smith, was displeased by this partible inheritance scheme. Between 17o9 and the final division of the estate in May 1728, Joseph bought out his brother Richard's share, thus giving him a double share to weigh against that of his spinster sister Mary and his other brother, John, a wheelwright. As the plat made for the 1728 division shows, Jo- seph claimed a separate shop and small house of his own (fig. 5); he may have already been using this house and shop, as his father's will men- tioned "houses" on the site. In contrast to the co- hesion of his share, Mary and John each received one half of their father's large house. John's share included a shop for his use as well as small yard. All three of the portions had sizable rear garden space, evidence of the great size of the lot their father had developed beginning in the late 1670s. Three small shops existed along its street front, each of which was used by a member of the Cowell family. A similar and equally problematic strategy of acquiring a lot and then gradually filling it in with buildings also occurred at an urban stead that "5Joseph Cowell will, made January 4, 17o8/9, Suffolk County Probate Records, Suffolk County Courthouse, Boston (hereafter SCPR), vol. 16, pp. 544-45; Joseph Cowell division of estate, May 2, 1728, SCD, vol. 44, pp. 294-96.</page><page sequence="13">Afterthoughts on Material Life 13 t~ ap -C~ L c le I ~ sla , S, F r 7' n,, Ptt JC Col. ~j k5 s. 0 od a, '5C.

Boston cooper Ephraim Sale had developed be- fore his death in 1690. There, a narrow "long en- try," "yard to ye wooden houses," and "inward Entry" gave access to a total of four contiguous houses crowded onto a single lot; shown here are these structures as divided for his heirs in 1701 (fig. 6). Throughout his working life, Sale pur- chased and developed lots adjacent to his own original houselot. His inventory, valued at more than ?i,024, reveals that his own house had eight rooms: "Hall," "Kitchen," "Chamber over hall," "Chamber over kitchen," "Closet," "little Cham- ber," "Garret," and "other Garret." According to his will, Sale planned to divide his estate in the manner shown in the plan. "My will is that my son Ephraim if he be able to purchase it," he wrote, shall "have my new built brick House with a Sutable accomodation of ground thereto." To his wife, Mary, he gave furniture and "the west- ernmost end or part of my dwelling House," in- cluding "the Cellar lower Chamber and garret all the roomes contained in that end as the parti- tions now stand Also the yard &amp; ground behind the Same. a fence to be run from the Easternmost side of the Easterly window in the low roome upon a streight line the full length of the yard and one halfe of my garden."16 In March 1711, as part of a debate concerning his nephew's rightful access to a small piece of land "intermixed" with his own, Stephen Green- wood, a shipwright, petitioned the governor to stop the inheritance. Greenwood's estate was, by his own description, "Situate at the Northerly End of Boston Lying in an Iregular forme as De- cypherd in a plan herewith Offered." The surviv- ing plan indicates various buildings, passages, and a garden space arranged at the north end of Fish Street (fig. 7). According to the report of the ap- praisers, made in June 1712, the property was judged "to be worthe. Vizt. The Old House Wood Yards &amp; Land at one hundred &amp; fourty pounds The rowe of Shops At One hundred &amp; Twenty pounds: The Shoomakers Shop in the said Row at Thirty pounds." The property has a complex social history in its own right. The "old house" shown likely predated 1650, and the "Brick House" is the same structure Greenwood's fa- ther, Nathaniel Greenwood, also a shipwright, mentioned when he stated in his 1684 will "I give &amp; bequeath my new Brick house, with halfe the garden &amp; halfe the Yard." By his own death in 1722, Stephen Greenwood had almost completed construction of a large new brick house on the property marked in 1711 as simply "Old house plott," a project aided by the large inheritance that came to the Greenwood estate through the death in 1707 of his wife Elizabeth's father, wealthy brewer Robert Bronsdon."7 By that time, 16 Ephraim Sale will, December 2, 1686, SCPR, vol. 8, pp. 19- 21; Ephraim Sale estate inventory, December 30, 169o, SCPR, vol. 8, p. 183. 7 The Greenwood plan is in "Maps and Plans," Massachu- setts Archives, Boston, vol. 45, PP- 404-5; Greenwood's inventory includes "house[e]s Land &amp; wharfes in Boston ... ?8oo :oo:oo" (Nathaniel Greenwood inventory, September 25, 1684, SCPR, vol. 9, PP- 192-93).

What concerns us here, however, are the shops arranged on the Greenwood property along Fish Street, including the "Shoe-Makers Shop," a triangular "smal Shop," and a small structure labeled "Benja: Browne," presumably for the person to whom it was then let. The shops are small and obviously rented from the Green- wood family; so much emerges from a 1721 deed that describes them as "the Shop which Samuel Saxton formerly Rented and the land belonging to it and the Shop wch Benjamin Brown formerly Rented adjoyning the aforesd Shop on the South Side [of Fish Street] with the Land thereunto be- longing." Stephen Greenwood's inventory taken the following year refers to them as "The Three Brick Tenements &amp; the Land thereto belonging fronting &amp; bounded on Ship street" and valued them at ?450. Greenwood's placement of these three shops in close proximity to form a row of commercial properties was by no means unusual. In 1708 Edward Hutchinson had a "Row of New Shops ... nigh his Dwelling house in Fish Street at the North End of Boston." Habijah Savage three years later received permission "to erect with Timber a building for Shops of 8o foot long 20 foot wide and 15 foot high on the North side and 11 foot high on the South side," the roof of which he soon modified from a shed to a pitch angle to ensure the better drainage of rain and snow. 18 As was the case for dwelling houses, not all shops were replaced by new structures. In some cases, additions ensured that needed space would be available but not at the expense of an original building that was still sturdy. In March 1696 the town of Boston contracted with housewright Sam- uel Bridges to build a timber extension onto one of the brick shops that was then standing "att the West end of ye Townhouse," meaning in all likeli- hood one of the numbered retail shops that had been built in brick under the old 1636 town- house that was still standing, though much modi- fied, where King Street intersected with Cornhill. The contract is valuable principally because it of- fers so much detail on the complicated building techniques-and associated expenses-of adding a timber frame to an existing brick structure (see appendix). Bridges, in exchange for ?30 in money, was to "make-erect and build a Substan- tiall Timber Frame of Oake Timber for the North end thereof, Vizt. a Sell a Window Stoole and capp fitt for windows, and a beame with Two Cor- nerposts wch frame is to be the whole breadth of the said Shop." In addition to building a door case and making a cellar door and stairs, Bridges agreed "to Frame and fix Sustantially a floore of Summers of Oake with Joyce therein, and to close with Boards up to ye sd Floore." Then the princi- pal timbers followed: "wch Floore is to have Two Summers over athwart of Sixteen foot in length. and Foure dragon Summers att each corner one to beare said building, That is to Jett, Eighteen Inches on the street att each end, and Two foot Six Inches on the backside." The addition was to measure twenty-seven feet in length, sixteen feet in width, and seven feet high in the walls, a sizable addition given the overall sizes of shops that were recorded in the building permits.'9 Plats, surveys, building permits, and contracts not only show the spatial proximity of shops to domestic space but also make clear the contribu- tion to the domestic economy that rental proper- ties offered to a landlord. Fortunately, a compre- hensive inventory of all rental properties was made by the Boston selectmen for the year 1707; for each rental property, the census includes the name of the lessee, the number of taxable polls in the rental property, the number (if any) of "Negroes" on the premises, the annual rent for the property listed, and the name of the land- lord(s) associated with the property. Overall, the census is impressive: 274 taxable polls were living in rental properties, including 209 as town resi- dents, 38 "men at sea," and 27 "more in Expedi- tions." In addition, inhabitants of rental proper- ties included 76 widows, 33 "poor women," and 18 Henchman heirs to Stephen Greenwood, deed of sale, Oc- tober 1721, SCD, vol. 35, PP. 141-42; Stephen Greenwood inven- tory, taken May io, 1722, SCPR, vol. 22, pp. 640-47; see also Ste- phen Greenwood division of estate, dated August 29, 1738, SCD, vol. 56, pp. 249-55. The same "3 small Brick Tenements fronting Ship St. North East End Joyning to Land forementioned" were valued at ?750 when Greenwood's son (also Stephen) died in 1742; see Stephen Greenwood inventory, 1742, SCPR, vol. 36, pp. 68-71, esp. schedule for "Real Estate viz." Timber building per- mits, pp. 91, 204. In 1712 John Clark also had "three shops now standing in the Front of his Land on ffish street," and Samuel Wentworth in 1713 had a "Row of Shops," both in Boston's North End. The longest structure for shops was actually built by the town of Boston itself in 1729: "a Row of Low Shops on part of the Town Dock which they Caused to be filled up to Contain 120 feet in length &amp; 20 feet in brea[d]th" (Timber building per- mits, pp. 207, 225). 19 "Articles of Agreement," in Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston, Containing Miscellaneous Papers, Boston Record Commissioners Report, vol. to (Boston: Rockwell and Churchill, 1886), p. 136.</page><page sequence="17">Afterthoughts on Material Life 17 an additional 36 black men, 29 black women, and 1o black children. Altogether, the census of rent- ers in Boston included 458 individuals who paid landlords for the roofs over their heads, a figure that would be much larger if it included the wives and children of the 274 taxable polls. The rental properties were themselves owned by a variety of landlords. Some were widows ("old mrs Moores," "mrs Wakefeild Midwife," "mrs Flack very poor," "Flora Mackartys"), others were officers of the church ("Deacon Barnard," "mr Allins minis- ter"). Upwardly mobile artisans rented to poorer ones; William Dummer owned a house "in the present Tenure of Moses Aires of Boston Housewright" when he moved to rebuild it in 1720. In 1739 joinerJohn Davis asked the select- men for "leave to admit mr Robert Banning pew- terer, an under tenant, in the shop he hath lately Leased from the Select men, Vizt. Number Six in Dock Square." Of course, merchants most fre- quently rented houses and shops to artisans, and some of them must have owned small clusters of rental buildings that resembled that owned by Stephen Greenwood. One "Collo. Hutchinson," for example, held leases on "Mary Earle Senr. &amp; her Daughtr Shop," "Edwd Eads house &amp; shop," "Wm Willett house &amp; shop," "Robt. Sharp Shop &amp; house," "Joseph Gray Shop," and four additional houses, in one of which he himself lived. Dr. Jonathan Clark rented "Erasmus Ste- vens Shop No i," "John Buttler house &amp; shop," "Samuel Gardner Shop," "Thos Cole Shop," and "Jno. King Shop."20 Here, as the interests of landlords counter the needs of renters, we realize that the particular material lives of different classes-houses, shops, warehouses, wharves- are parts of the same cultural economy and must be interpreted from such a perspective. In September 1720, William Webster granted his son-in-law, Boston merchant Joshua Wroe, a tract of land with buildings that fronted on Cold Lane in the town's North End.

[] 30021 Perhaps most significant here, as at other loca- tions in late seventeenth-century Boston, is the small courtyard area in the middle of the Web- ster-Wroe complex. To have a courtyard was not merely a function of the peripheral alignment of houses, stables, and kitchens; instead, preserving a courtyard area-and especially living in the middle or rear areas of the court-seems to have been a mark of claimed social position. When he visited Boston from London in the 169os, satirist Edward Ward encountered two local youths ar- guing in the street: I was mightily pleas'd one Morning with a Contention between two boys at a Pump in Boston, about who should draw their Water first. One Jostled the other from the Handle, and he would fill his Bucket first, be- cause his Master said Prayers and sung Psalms twice a Day in his Family, and the others Master did not. To which the Witty Knave made this reply, Our House stands backward in a Court; if my Master had a Room next the Street, as your Master has, he'd Pray, twice to your Mas- ters once, that he wou'd; and therefore I'll fill my Pail first, Marry will I; and did accordingly.22 Although it remains difficult to know precisely the ways in which Wroe may have modified the property-especially Peter Gibbons's "Distill house"-during the decade prior to his death, the location of the small house that Gibbons rented from Webster was certainly off the street- front side of the property. Finally, a property bought by Bryant Parrott from the town in 1722 shows how dependent pri- vate dwelling houses in large towns were on the many service structures surrounding them (fig. 9).23 Parrott's holding, located at the intersection of Water Street and a small lane called Cooper's Alley, consisted of a large brick house with a kitchen and little kitchen projecting from its rear facade into a large enclosed yard. Across the alley from the house was a small cooper's shop that Parrott rented. The principal service building was a large commercial bakehouse, a long rectangu- lar building with two cavernous ovens projecting at one end. Next to this site, Parrott also pur- chased a warehouse, a brewhouse, and a second house, which he rented. The same density of housing, rental proper- ties, and artisans' shops appeared in 1736, when Boston shopkeeper Benjamin Walker observed in his diary the early progress of Boston's devasta- ting fire that year. The blaze at first tore through "Brattle Olivers Bakehouse about midnight be- gan by Some neglect &amp; burnt it down," then spread to other buildings packed along the nearby waterfront: "a Coopers Shop a Store house of Olivers, Two dwelling howse belong'd to widow Sanders, a great loss to ye woman." In or- der to prevent the fire from spreading to addi- tional neighborhoods, there was "a Joyners Shop pulld down an[d] any Barrells throw[n] off ye wharfe." The image Walker paints is of a dock- front area packed with an array of buildings, many of which were-as the plans demonstrate- irregularly arranged just as Boston's competitive real estate market was transforming all corners of the town into valuable and readily exchanged commodities.24 21 William Webster to Joshua Wroe, deed of sale, September 21, 1720, SCD, vol. 34, PP. 255-56.Joshua Wroe estate inventory, taken June 29, 1730, SCPR, vol. 28, pp. 108-12. Indeed, Wroe seemed to have developed the property for the benefit of his mother-in-law, as he and i of his brothers-in-law received permis- sion in February 17l21-soon after Webster's death-"to Erect a Timber Building on a Peice or Parcel of Land situate at the Bot- tom of Sudbury Street, to be thirty seven foot front Twenty seven foot deep &amp; Eighteen foot studd" (Timber building permits, p. 221), built perhaps on the site of the "garden" in the drawing of the site. The Sudbury Street site was the same location as the Webster property. 22 Edward Ward, A Trip to New England with a Character of the Country and People, Both the English and Indian (London, 1699), reprinted in Five Travel Scripts Commonly Attributed to Edward Ward, Facsimile Text Society, series 1, Language and Literature 7 (New York: Columbia University Press for the society, 1933), PP. 7-8. 2 Town of Boston to Bryant Parrott, deed of sale, 1722, SCD, vol. 36, p. 146. 24 Benjamin Walker diary, vol. 2, entry dated May 13, 1736, Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston.

Following Walker's terse description, and con- sistent with our earlier critique of Braudel's meta- phorical "house of material life" in mind, we can see that in early Boston the individual house, for- mally isolated from the symbolic labor of building and rebuilding that defined the landscape in so- cial terms, simply could not and did not epito- mize the range of ordinary tasks and metaphors that any household economy necessarily entailed. Yet the submersion of individuals in mundane la- bor was precisely what Braudel wanted to de- scribe. Referring to material life, Braudel himself once stated, "I began with daily life, with those aspects of life that control us without our even be- ing aware of them: habit or, better yet, routines- those thousands of acts that flower and reach fru- ition without anyone's having made a decision, acts of which we are not even fully aware." He paused philosophically: "I think mankind is more than waist-deep in routine."25 It should now be clear that without reference to spaces outside the metaphorical house, basic aspects of existence in human societies would be both overlooked and undertheorized. 25 Braudel, Afterthoughts, pp. 6-7.</page><page sequence="20">20 Winterthur Portfolio 32:1 Fig. io.

Another critique could follow: Not everything that we might assume was "inside" the house nec- essarily was inside in crowded towns like Boston. And room usage in urban contexts also varied from those that prevailed in more rural settings. With the exception of large houses, most dwell- ings were oriented with their gable end toward the street on deep but irregular narrow lots. The house of Boston merchant Thomas Smith, inven- toried in April 1691 and drawn during an estate division in 18o3, may serve as an apt illustration of how an ordinary house in the town worked in social terms, and thus it warrants a brief digres- sion. Smith was one of Boston's premier mariners of the mid seventeenth century. Having married Rebecca Glover, the daughter of wealthy shipping magnate Habbakuk Glover, Smith quickly moved up through the ranks of wholesale merchants. His self-portrait, likely completed between 1670 and his death in 1688, reveals him as a man of the world (fig. io); a ship sets sail behind him. His awareness of keeping mercantile wealth and Prot- estant ethics in balance emerges from the skull he grasps and the grim note he penned for the reader's considerate gaze: "Why should I the World be minding/ therein a World of Evils Finding." 26 Perhaps in following his formulaic renuncia- tion of trifling vanities, he and his wife lived along Fish Street in the busy North End in a modest house-by London standards, certainly, and even those of Boston's most fashionable merchants. They were careful, no doubt, to balance the inte- riority of fashion and avant-garde taste against an exterior facade of public restraint and a strategic identification with "popular" sensibilities. As is often the case in modern society, vernacular de- sign could as often be a subtle means of coding class difference as a position of popular consen- sus. Even as he crossed the Atlantic, John Win- throp realized this imperative of plantation- making, warning that the "high and mighty" should take care to exercise moral restraint and "not eat up the poor." As early as 1632 Winthrop had to put his sermon's theoretical point into practice, when he admonished Thomas Dudley for building too grand a house, one that would certainly make class prerogative apparent and thus authority more difficult to maintain. "The governor having formerly told him," Winthrop explained to his diary, "that he did not well to bestow such cost about wainscotting and adorn- ing his house, in the beginning of a plantation, both in regard of the necessity of public charges, and for example, etc." But Dudley was quick to counter the governor's warning, cleverly justi- fying his excess as mere utility and therefore be- yond rebuke. "His answer now was, that it was for the warmth of his house, and the charge was little being but clapboards nailed to the wall in the form of wainscot." One of many such instances, this exchange indicates how central the architec- tural process is to the process of moral identifica- tion that permits communities to hold dear an il- lusion of corporate consensus at the same time that hierarchy and authority wrap their unbroken chains around the social order.27 26 On Thomas Smith and his self-portrait, see Joy Cattanach, "Captain Thomas Smith," in Jonathan L.

Plan of house of Thomas and Rebecca Smith, pre-167o; survey of house taken in 1803. (Mas- sachusetts Historical Society; Drawing, Robert Blair St. George.) As the plan of Smith's house demonstrates, it was little more than a typical central-chimney, hall-and-parlor structure turned gable end to the street (fig. 11). Integral to the house and stretch- ing along its full depth on one side ran a "Great Entry" that allowed access to the principal front door as well as to a protected yard at the struc- ture's rear. Like many houses in Boston's tight pattern of narrow lanes and alleyways, the Smith property was contoured to conform to the irregu- lar features of the lot. Entering the four-and-one- half-foot-wide passageway, a visitor had to walk some twenty feet before reaching the narrow front door. Once inside, he or she encountered not a stairway to chambers above but instead a massive central chimney stack. This structure, like very few recorded New England examples but like most lobby-entry English houses (fig. 12), had stairs located to the rear of the chimney stack, thus requiring entrance into the hall in order to gain access to the chambers above. Immediately, then, the Smith house challenges the normal in- ternal logic of space and social movement that was common in seventeenth-century New En- gland. The room-by-room inventory finally taken of the house and contents in April 1691 (Smith died in 1688, but his complicated business records took a while to set in order) reveals other uses of interior space in this merchant's home. The front room on the ground floor was the "Haul" in which, among other things, were one high and one low bedstead, a large oval table, a dozen chairs (six Russia leather and six "old Calf leather chairs"), a wicker hamper, the second-best bed worth ?7.4.o, books, and "a parcell of Dutch Toyes" valued at ?1.5.o. Directly above was the "street Chamber" in the public front of the struc- ture. Here were kept a variety of fine linens, Smith's wearing apparel, a "Spanish" table, and two chests. As was the custom in England, this front chamber, over the noise of the thorough- fare below, was not a favored sleeping room. In- deed, as no fireplace tools or hearth furniture ap- pear in the Smith inventory, it seems not to have been heated either. To the rear of the chimney stack on the ground floor lay the working kitchen, in which there was no furniture but a wide variety of kettles, toasters, forks, cooking pans, and a "Lignum vitae punch bowl." In the "Kitchen chamber" overhead was a bed with im- ported "Sadcullered Printed Curtains," a chest of drawers valued at an impressive ?3.10.0, "2 Old Cabbin quilts," and other items. Apparently the Smiths used the small chamber over the lobby en- try as their own sleeping quarters; although cramped, it is the only remaining room that could have held the best bed (valued here at ?15) and other objects listed without room designation at the beginning of the inventory.28 It also would have been more than twice as large as the lobby below, since it would have extended completely over the entry passage on the ground floor and 28Thomas Smith estate inventory, taken April 25, 1691, SCPR, docket 1672.</page><page sequence="22">22 Winterthur Portfolio 32:1 ... ~ ~ . ....... ......................................... . -; I- :_1-:!3:( :~"ii -_i-i?'--i :-ii ::': --?"-:... :B-~iiiii -i Ii i~ i ..........~-i~~,' 1I,:i1., - ...... ^i-~ :l: i-:: ?'':'''-i~~iii ~ - i::-:-;;:'_r : ..... . ..: : ; .1c- . . . .. . . . ......

The Smiths's best bed was impressive: "1: pr serge Curtns &amp; Vallns: with a nett work Lace Callecoe hd: ps: buckram Testr: a Large Feather bed and Bolster and one Blanktt: 1 Bedstead Cord and Curtn Rods all ?15." Having a best bed, with a full complement of elaborate textiles in what can only be described as a "porch cham- ber," was in fact very au courant with French court fashion. Near their bed were "6: Alabaster Images," a "house Clock," "1: Ollive Fraim'd Lookeing glass," and-somehow it, too, must have fit in this very crowded space-a chest of drawers that held an impressive array of imported silks, fustians, "Norwich stuffe," "Painted Lin- nen," "Narrow Strip'd silk for Sashes," and three precious yards of "Black Allamode." The pair of "Brass Andirons" in this small room suggests that a hearth probably opened into the side of the chimney stack at the chamber level to provide heat. The cellar under part of the structure held iron implements, tools, and ten gallons of vine- gar, while the garret over the house contained, even here in the port town, a parcel of wheat and rye as well as "Other Lumber."29 With the room-by-room inventory in hand, it is possible to examine the relative "value" of Smith's household spaces, at least insofar as they were or were not filled with objects given high ap- praisals. Altogether, Smith has ?254.14.5 (16.7 percent) of his total wealth invested in household movables. If we arrange them in descending or- der by room, we arrive at the following emphasis on the "quality space" of each one: 29" Smith inventory.

Yet this pattern, especially with the front room or "Street Chamber" being a storage room that was often unheated, raises the question of how strong the influence of French bourgeois culture may have been in this English colonial port. No doubt the Smiths's spatial practices were one of many different solutions to the problem of defining in- terior living spaces when the gable end was forced to the street front by a narrow, deep urban lot or when the household economy depended on the ground-floor street room as either a retail or an artisan's shop. In 1686, for example, the inven- tory of Boston sailmaker Edward Groves indicates how an artisan combined the room functions of the narrow, gable-end-to-street house with his need for an adequate working space. The ground floor of his house contained the predictable "Hall" and "great Low Room," above which were somehow arranged a "Lodgeing Roome," "Chamber next the Street," and "another fore chamber." But while a "Celler" defined a storage zone beneath the street grade of his house, the "shop" in which he left "saile needles" and other tools of his trade could only have been par- titioned off the "Hall" next to the public front of the property.30 The Smiths owned two house slaves, "a Negroe man &amp; weom: Jos Pow &amp; Lucy," worth ?50, and two additional slaves named George and Sampson, who worked on board the three vessels in which Smith owned shares. The Fish Street property was listed in the inventory, taken after Smith had been dead for three years, as "A house and Land in Boston nigh the Towne Dock now in her Posession vallu'd (according to its circum- stances) at ?400." Its history after Smith's death illustrates how contests over real estate could also redefine the social function of the house as meta- phor. Shortly after her husband's estate was fi- nally settled, Rebecca Smith must have acted on her own and sold the house quickly; five days after the inventory was taken, on April 30, 1691, she accepted ?400-the same amount specified as its marketable value in the inventory-from Thomas Clarke, pewterer, for "All that Messuage or Tenement Cellars Shops Roomes and Apart- ments therein contained with the Yard Garden Backside and land thereunto belonging."'31 In so promptly selling the property, Rebec- ca Smith apparently worried the three "good friends mr Peter Sargent, mr Benjamin Browne, and my Brother in Law Obadiah Gill," whom her husband had charged in his will with guarding his children's interest in the estate. Each of these men played a pivotal role in trade and shipping: Sarget was a Boston merchant from London; Browne was a Salem merchant with close Boston ties; and Gill was a wealthy Boston shipwright. Re- alizing how swiftly Rebecca had liquidated the assets without their consent, the three began to eye the North End holding with some envy that belies their altruism for the Smith heirs. For while the property would eventually go to the heirs, these men were free to use it for their own deal- ings in the meantime. On December 20, 1695, they succeeded in purchasing for ?500 (some of which was borrowed against the Smith estate they had promised to safeguard) the "Brick Messuage or Tenement or Tenements" of Boston merchant Anthony Checkly across the street from the Smith house. Such a piece of land gave them waterfront property in a key location close to the town dock, something to which shipwright Gill must have been alert from the outset. Two months later, the three executors approached pewterer Clarke and, on February 20, 1695/96, they bought the Smith house back for the same ?400 that Clarke had earlier paid Rebecca Smith for it. This now gave them, while nominally working on behalf of the Smith heirs, several buildings on both sides of Fish Street along the busy waterfront that they could exploit for their own commercial pur- poses.32 30 Smith inventory; Edward Groves estate inventory, taken Oc- tober 8, 1686, SCPR, vol. 9, pp. 175-76.

Apparently Gill, the last of the Smith guardians involved with the property, had rented it in the meantime, since when Dennis purchased the house, it was de- scribed as "currently in Tenure and Occupation of Mary Peirce, widow." The Dennises lived there until Ebenezer's death in 1731, when the house and land were valued at ?6oo in the slowly inflat- ing currency of the early eighteenth century. Al- though Dennis's inventory was not taken room- by-room, it nonetheless suggests some continu- ities in the house's interior furnishings. Like Smith, Dennis also had four bedsteads in the house: two rooms contained a standing bedstead, while another had a standing bedstead and a "pallet bedstead" that functioned as a kind of low or trundle bed for children. But while Smith's in- ventory argues that he heated four of the rooms-the hall, kitchen, kitchen chamber, and porch chamber-only two sets of andirons ap- pear in Dennis's 1731 inventory, suggesting that during his tenure perhaps less of the house may have been in common use due to his lower eco- nomic position and smaller family. Smith's total estate value, after all, was a commanding ?1517-14.1 in 1691. Dennis, in the inflating economy of 1731, possessed only ?786. And of these respective estates, Smith's house and land (?400oo) accounted for only 26.4 percent of his wealth; Dennis's ?6oo in real holdings came to 76.3 percent of his total wealth. Living closer to the edge, Dennis used the house in a more frugal manner as he and his wife, Susanna, condensed their household economy into fewer rooms. When we extend our view to the life history of the house, its changing significance as an emblem of either aspired mobility or of social stasis comes more clearly into view.33 At other Boston properties, the changing sig- nificance even of single spaces deserves attention. Consider, for example, kitchens. At Smith's house, the kitchen was located within the main body of the house, as was common in rural houses throughout early New England. Yet in- stances of the kitchen being enclosed within the house or located in the cellar of the house (as at merchant Robert Howard's house), were no more common in colonial Boston than were kitchens entirely detached from the house and lo- cated at a safe distance. Documentary references emerge quickly: In 1681, for example, the estate ofJoseph Gillam in Boston contained "The dwell- ing house out kitchen part of a shed being al- ready divided, with an Orchard &amp; garden, A wharfe &amp; all the Land belonging to sd. houses" valued at ?675. The carpenter's contract to build the Latin schoolmaster's house in Boston in 1701 specified a house and a separate "Kitchin of Six- teen foot in length &amp; twelve foot in bredth with a Chamber therein." Similarly, the record of tim- ber building permits issued by the Boston select- men refers specifically to detached kitchens, such as one that John Mico gained approval to build in October 1707: "a timber Building for a Kitchen of 19 foot long 18 wide &amp; 15 stud with a flatt Roof to stand about 15 foot distant from the Southerly side of his New house lately Erected." Two years later the selectmen permitted John Legg "to Erect a Timber building for [a] Kitchen or Wash house of 18 foot long 14 wide &amp; 9 stud in the yard or Garden lying on the South Side of that the Dwelling house of his ffather Samuel Legg Esqr ... the sd Kitchen to stand 16 foot Dis- tant from sd Dwelling house."34 Two contemporary drawings add graphic evi- dence in support of these references and raise questions concerning how early detached kitch- ens first appeared in Boston. One represents a property surveyed in 1734, when John Holyoke, a Boston brazier, purchased the estate from Joseph Webb, then resident in Newark, New Jersey (fig. 13). Webb had sold the house to one Thomas Carter in 1684/85 and purchased it back a year later. In the 1684 deed of sale to Car- ter, Webb enumerated the property in words that argue that the detached rear kitchen marked on the 1734 plan was then standing: "his now dwell- ing house, conteining two Shops, one lower Roome, two Cellars, two Chambers one garret, with all the Land thereto belonging and apper- taining and one out house behind the said house." In fact, Webb had inherited half of this house from his father Richard, a Boston shoe- 33James Bill to Samuel Gardner, and Samuel Gardner to Ebe- nezer and Susanna Dennis, deed of sale, March 18, 1712, SCD, vol. 27, pp. 71-73; Ebenezer Dennis estate inventory, taken Au- gust 11, 1731, SCPR, vol. 29, p. 91. 34Joseph Gillam estate inventory, 1681, SCPR, vol. 9, p. ioi; for the 1701 schoolmaster's house contract, see Cummings, "Mas- sachusetts Bay Building Documents," p. 2oi.

However, no definitive documentation prior to the 1684 deed of sale from Joseph Webb to Carter confirms the presence of the "out house" or kitchen on the site; in its absence, we can assume only that it predates that year. A second drawing shows the plan of a house with detached kitchen as it stood when cooper Barrett Dyre sold the dwelling house and land to widow Ann Foot in 1746 (fig. 14). Fronting on Marlborough Street, the property consisted of what were stock features: directly behind the dwelling is a small work yard, a detached rear kitchen, and finally, a garden, which stretches an impressive sixty-two feet beyond to the estate's rear boundary. This drawing clearly reveals one other feature: a small shed or "gallery" that pro- vided shelter at ground level and a storage cham- ber above between the main house and the rear kitchen. As in England, these passages could be an integral part of the structure's original build, or they could be added later to complete the link- age between the house and kitchen. In 17o8, for example, Jonathan Waldo was permitted "to Erect a Timber building for a Lodging Chamber of 12 foot square and 7 Studd with a flat roofe Over a passage way between his Dwelling house &amp; Kitchen nigh the Conduit at the Lower end of Union street in Boston."36 Title research reveals the Dyre-Foot house to be identical to one described in an indenture of 1683, when Thomas and Joseph Robinson, a cord- wainer and cooper, respectively, agreed to subdi- vide the house they had jointly inherited from their father. In that indenture, Thomas received the Northernmost End of the sd Dwelling house Mes- suage or Tenement ...

Also One small Kitchen behind the sd part of said house with a Chamber over the same, and another small Chamber that lyeth between the Cham- ber that Fronts to the Street, and the said Kitchen Chamber with the Closets Garretts or Cocklofts belong- ing to the same, with the free priviledeg of the Well in the Yard and of the passage way into the said Yard. For his share, brother Joseph received the "Southernmost part of the aforesaid Messuage Tenement or dwelling house ... Containing One Cellar, One large Low Room and Closet or small Kitchen adjoyning and Shop fronting to the Street with Two Chambers and the Stair Case and Chamber at the head of the Stairs and Garretts over the same." With the house facing east onto Marlborough Street, this means that Thomas re- ceived the northern half of the house, including the detached rear kitchen (and connecting shed or "gallery" segment), and Joseph the southern half of the house. In this case, at least, the house by 1683 had a detached kitchen. Whether it was already standing when their father, Thomas, also a cooper, died in 1665/6 is unclear. His inven- tory, in addition to such intriguing references as "one Charger &amp; a pewter salt of silver ffashion," describes the same property: "Houses &amp; Lands in Boston lying between the House of Tho[mas] Miller &amp; the House that was Mr Haughes. ... ?310." With a total estate value of ?271, Robinson was a stable, if not overly prosperous, seventeenth-century artisan. He owned some old- fashioned furniture-"a great old Chest with Drawers" and "6 old chests.""37 The inventory confirms that he owned one set of fireplace equipment, suggesting his use of only one work- ing hearth. But it fails to mention the "out kitchen" in particular. The use of kitchens detached and placed to the rear of the principal residence in seven- teenth-century Boston may have been due in part to a fear of fire that prevailed in the port town. Yet the amputation of the kitchen from the main body of the house also represents the triumph of the bourgeois ideal of separating and hiding from public view the culturally base activities that com- monly occurred in kitchens and suggests that ur- ban centers were in the vanguard of the bour- geois reform of manners. In a more crowded town setting it also kept the house safe from the zone of food processing, waste, pollution, and dis- ease, which might include sawed bones, hacked flesh, urine, rotting hides, and black humors. When viewed from this angle, detached kitchens tie the port on the colonial periphery to transfor- mations in symbolic categories that were well un- der way in English urban centers and large county towns such as London, Exeter, and Plymouth. In Derek Portman's and W. G. Hoskins's work on Exeter, Michael Laithwaite's on Totnes, W. A. Pantin's on Oxford, and in scattered surviving plans from London and nearby Deptford, de- tached kitchens with intermediate yards and rear gardens sound a common refrain. Portman, in particular, has detailed the different ways in which the detached kitchen building was actually used. In one instance an Exeter merchant in 16o09 used the chamber level of the kitchen struc- ture for actual cooking, while rougher prepara- tion of meat, poultry, and cleaning of other food- stuffs took place on the ground floor. In 1612 another Exeter merchant even used the chamber level of his detached kitchen structure for a polite dining room. And in 1708 William Spicer of Exe- ter used the ground floor of the detached kitchen for cooking, while in the "backer Chamber," as it was called, he kept "3 old Coffers," "3 suger Cheeses," "1 Childs Chare," and a "sacke of bar- ley malte." In the "backe Loft" above, he stored some old boards, another cheese, and "other try- fells."''38 7 Thomas Robinson and Joseph Robinson, division of estate of Thomas Robinson, Sr. (their father), April io, 1683, SCD, vol. 26, pp. 113-14. The term cockloft that appears in the division of estate allotted to Thomas Robinson is a common west-country dia- lect term for garret. It appears, for example, in room-by-room in- ventories taken in Gloucestershire in the mid seventeenth cen- tury, including those of Nicholas Elbon of Barnsley, taken March 14, 1647, listing a "Cocke Loffte over his Lodging Chamber"; Stephen Dangerfield of Stonehouse, taken April 16, 1661, listing "in the Cocklofte"; and Daniel Fowler of Stowhouse, taken June 26, 1664, listing "In the outer Cockloft" and "In the inner Cock- loft"; I am indebted to Richard M. Candee for sharing with me his manuscript abstracts on these Gloucestershire inventories. The terms also appear in Boston in April 1724, when Jeremiah Bumstead noted in his diary that "Hope Foster hanged himself on ye stairs of his cockloft" ("Diary ofJeremiah Bumstead of Bos- ton, 1722-1727," New England Historic Genealogical Register 15 [1861]: 201).

On one hand, the proximity of London and the southeastern counties to France makes the close similarity of these English plans to the so- called maison bloc houses of late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Paris only logical, espe- cially when one considers the impact of mer- chants with continental experience on English taste. The carefully measured plans illustrated in Pierre LeMuet's Maniere du bastir pour touttes sortes de personnes (1623) show the Parisian prototypes, as do the meticulous reconstructions of domestic layouts by Madeleine Jurgens and Pierre Cou- perie, based on room-by-room inventories; Braudel himself relied upon Jurgens's and Cou- perie's 1962 study and even republished one of their illustrations in The Structures of Everyday Life, the first volume of his massive trilogy on early modern Europe's uneven but ineluctable transi- tion to commercial capitalism. The appearance of these same "maison bloc" plans in England's west country may be due to the spread of London mercantile fashion outward into the hinterlands. More likely, however, as both Portman and Laith- waite have argued, it represents a direct infusion of French taste into places like Exeter, Taunton, Plymouth, and Totnes due to the close ties west- country merchants had in the free textile trading centers of St. Malo and Rouen (fig. 15). Ac- cording to Lewis Roberts, Rouen was "one of the principall Cities of Traffique and Commerce in France, having a great concourse of Merchants of all these Northern Kingdomes, and is one of the three principall Townes in France where Exchanges are used." Rouen's relative openness to the En- glish was due to its three, large, annual trade fairs, two of which provided fifteen days for selling and buying without any customs or taxes, as long as any exchanged commodities were removed more than fifteen miles from the city within fifteen days after the fairs' closing. "Here is in this Citie," Roberts wrote, "a publique Hall granted to the English for the sale of all English woollen cloth, whereto they are enjoyned to carry the same and have certaine set dayes to lay open and sell the same, and for the hire and custody they pay a Duty of halledge or warehousedome." And, until the early 163os, west-country textile traders brought so much commerce to Rouen that they enjoyed a social status rarely accorded to the English by the French. According to Roberts, "they have had formerly many immunities and priviledges and were accounted as halfe Citizens.""39 On the other hand, the connections that Lon- don merchants had with merchants from Hanse- atic ports throughout northern Europe suggests another possible source for the long, narrow ur- ban lot and house with detached rear kitchen structure. To be sure, the ties among members of the Merchant Adventurers' Company in England and their counterparts in the Hanse were never relaxed. At least since the mid 155os English mer- chants had competed fiercely with their German counterparts to control the profitable cloth trade in Antwerp and Bruges. Although Elizabeth I pre- vailed in creating a virtual English lock on the trading ports in the Low Countries by the late 156os, by then the trade itself had shifted its ener- gies to such continental trading centers as Ham- burg and Staide. For England, the Hanseatic trade remained a contested economic issue until it eventually weakened following the Restoration in 166o, but northern European design traditions certainly played a part in the hybridizing spatial practices of English merchants' domestic archi- tecture.40 in Peter Clark and Paul Slack, eds., Crisis and Order in English Towns, 50oo-170oo: Essays in Urban History (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972), pp. 237-62.

By the 158os, for example, London's Hanseatic premise, "The Steelyards," boasted an array not only of merchants houses but also of smaller row houses or stalhofs for dockworkers, carters, and employees of the merchants them- selves along several narrow lanes running perpen- dicular to the banks of the Thames (fig. 16).41 In Bryggen, domestic layouts were organized in gdrds, or connected units of buildings that stretched backward from a narrow street front. Each gadrd might contain a number of merchant's properties, or handelsstue, which in turn com- bined a principal dwelling house or vdningshus with a quay, miscellaneous storage rooms, and yard. Until Bryggen's disastrous fire of 1702, these dwellings were built of timber and painted in the rankedekorasjoner style with complex pat- terns of flowers, leaves, and vines. Within each :?~~-: - -: j?: :-- :l i~ii-i Fig. i6. Ground plan of housing in the Steelyards, the Hanseatic premise in London, 1560-8o.

There was more to the appearance of houses, 41 On the standardization of Hanseatic commercial com- plexes, see Johannes Schildhauer, The Hansa: History and Culture, trans.

The effi- ciency of the German merchants was also due to their having per- fected new techniques for cranes and hoisting devices on wharves; see Detlev Ellmers, "Development and Usage of Harbour Cranes," in Christine Villain-Gandossi, Salvino Busuttil, and Paul Adam, eds., Medieval Ships and the Birth of Technological Societies, Vol- ume I: Northern Europe (Malta: Foundation for International Stud- ies, 1989), PP- 43-69, esp. p. 63, fig. 1, and p. 66, fig. 4, which closely resembles the wharf crane visible in early views of the Lon- don "Steelyard." 42 On architectural design and external cooking arrange- ments in the Bryggen settlement, see Halfden Wiberg, "The Ar- chitecture and Furnishings of the Kontor," in Espen Bowitz An- dersson, ed., Bryggen: The Hanseatic Settlement in Bergen, trans.

There was also more at work than the likely influence of functional arrange- ments among connected building complexes de- riving from the Hanseatic mercantile tradition. Undoubtedly the more frequent use of detached kitchens in Boston occurred after town officials, aware of the London calamity in i666, instituted strict regulations to minimize the threat of con- flagration. Boston itself had experienced the sharp pain of loss in the fire of 1676. In 1679 a new Boston ordinance insisted that any new buildings be built of brick for safety reasons. Im- mediately, Boston's carpenters complained their livelihood would be endangered by a loss of work to their brickmason rivals. Indeed, the persis- tence of timber construction in late seventeenth- century Boston and through the period of the timber building permits (1707-29) was probably due in large part to the power of the carpenters as a trade group and the lengths to which they</page><page sequence="32">32 Winterthur Portfolio 32:1 4z V4. 0 10 feet Fig. 18. House of Thomas and Anne Stanbury ("Old Feather Store"), Dock Square, Boston, 168o. (Drawing, Robert Blair St. George.) went to underprice masons in the wake of the 1679 building code. For this reason, the dramatic rise in frequency of references to out-kitchens after 168o seems to make sense. Ordinary houses, surrounded by outbuildings in the merchant's premise, urban farmstead, or artisan's compound, were thus objectifications of household order and of local engagements in la- bor politics concerning what occupational groups might own the official right to build. In the con- struction of a building, relations of authority emerge at many points. And here lies perhaps a fi- nal critique of Braudel's architectural metaphor. Namely, not everyone had a house like that of Thomas and Anne Stanbury (fig. i8), with three levels to denote in prescribed style the Braudel- lian zones of longue duree, conjuncture, and l'histoire evinementielle, not everyone in early modern Euro- pean society occupied a position from which the value of the formal metaphor could even be real- ized. If room-by-room inventories have taught us anything, it must surely be the experimental quality and remarkable diversity of vernacular architec- ture as a lived social practice, a diversity that has often not survived the ravages of moral reform, technological improvements, great wealth, dire poverty, and even historic preservationists.43 4" The Stanbury house ("Old Feather Store") is described in Cummings, Framed Houses, pp. 135-36, 140. On the 3 inter-</page><page sequence="33">Afterthoughts on Material Life 33 The diversity of spatial practice in early mod- ern Boston is readily apparent. Consider the house that Rev. John Cotton purchased in the mid 163os from Sir Henry Vane, described by Samuel Sewall as being "considerably distant from other buildings" and "very bleak." It none- theless had a "gallery" listed among its rooms when Cotton's estate was inventoried in 1652, but in this case the word probably did not reference a connecting shed between a house and its de- tached rear kitchen. As Rosalyn Cooper has dem- onstrated, the gallery or "corridor gallery" in elite households was a reception space that also permitted communication between public and private rooms. Writing at the turn of the eigh- teenth century, Richard Neve described them as "long narrow Rooms, made of the Sides or Fronts of Houses; they serve for Walking, Eating and other Divertisements." French and Italian in ori- gin, the gallery became a common feature in En- glish courtyard houses during the sixteenth cen- tury. Although it is difficult to imagine exactly how the Boston example was situated, it was likely placed over a great hall, in keeping with fashion- able households in England at the turn of the sev- enteenth century. Neve maintained that "their Length (says Palladio) ought to be at least 5 times their Breadth; they may be 6, 7, or 8 times their Breadth, but must not exceed." And given Vane's gentle birth, his father's connections in the privy council and court of Charles I, and his overwean- ing sense of his own gentility, it was likely he- and not minister Cotton-who had the house so politely outfitted.44 With galleries, dining rooms, and separate bedchambers for husbands and wives, large houses in seventeenth-century Boston made easy colonial reference to changing mercantile fash- ions in metropolitan London and Paris. At the opposite end of the scale lay one-room houses heated only by stoves, small houses of laborers and lesser artisans, flimsy structures built in back alleyways, and the modest houses of middling sorts (fig. i9). The distance of these structures from the stylish neo-Palladian mansion built in the town's North End by merchantJohn Foster in 1686 was obvious (fig. 2o). Elite houses also had newer heating technologies alongside customary ones; Samuel Sewall described himself "passing out of the Stove-Room into the Kitchen" of his house in 17o6. Grand houses and their interior innovations demonstrate that spatial inequality was the basic operative condition in Boston as surely as it was in London. As Joseph Moxon sum- marized the issues of class prerogative and social decorum in the late 167os, "a Gentleman's House must not be divided as a Shop-Keeper's, nor all Shop-keepers House alike; for some Trades require a deeper, others may dispence with a shallower Shop, and so an Inconvenience may arise in both." In fact, when the startling array of urban housing and settlement strategies shown in Ralph Treswell's London surveys of 1607 to 1612 are taken into account, the diversity defies any easy "typology" of urban architecture and suggests that crowded urban lots were hot- beds of architectural innovation and experimen- tation at the vernacular level.45 Indeed, in more crowded centers such as Lon- don and Boston, spatial experimentation seems to have prevailed over simple transferal and re- production. French models appeared as viable al- ternatives for ambitious coopers and braziers seeking to identify with petty merchants; crowded, narrow lots were one means of dealing with what Norman J. G. Pounds has aptly termed a heightened "friction of space" characteristic of urban centers.

Instead of merely referring to hall, parlor, and service rooms, urban inventories commonly reference such spaces as "front low room, middle low room, back low room" and "front chamber, back cham- ber." Like the house of Thomas and Rebecca Smith, many Bostonians organized their interiors along this front-to-back conceptual axis, a pattern that continued throughout the eighteenth cen- tury. In 1710 William Hill's three-story house had a "Lower room" and "kitchen," above which were a "front Chamber" and "back Chamber" and then the "upper back Chambers" and "up- per Front Chambers." Mary Brown organized her interior life in her "Lower Room," "Great Cham- ber," "fore Upper Chamber," and "Back Cham- ber" in 1729, and in 1743 George Stewart had the neatly corresponding pairs of "Kitchen" and</page><page sequence="35">Afterthoughts on Material Life 35 Fig. 20.

"Kitchen Chamber," "Back Parlour" and "Back Chamber," and "Front Parlour" and "Front Chamber." 46 Other building modifications also demon- strate the ways in which vernacular process sig- naled social movement and transformation. Mer- chants eager to accentuate their social status by elaborating new rituals of entrance and access "porched out" or extended their formal entries by adding a new vestibule or antechamber before their front doors (fig. 21). The addition of such a space was an obvious attempt to adopt an archi- tectural and social practice of the English aristoc- racy, a fact not lost on Neve when he defined the antechamber as "an Outer, or Forechamber; a Room in Noblemen's Houses, where Strangers stay till such Time as the Party to be spoke with, is at Leisure." This step required that inhabitants wanting to build a new porch obtain permission 11 See Norman J. G. Pounds, Hearth and Home: A History of Ma- terial Culture (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989), p. 256. The need to soften or ease the friction of social and interper- sonal space in cities may have been related to the transformation of marginal or dangerous urban inhabitants into "picaresque" narrative characters; see Peter Burke, "Urban History and Urban Anthropology of Early Modern Europe," in Derek Fraser and An- thony Sutcliffe, eds., The Pursuit of Urban History (London: Edward Arnold, 1983), pp. 74-76.

Besides having obvious antecedents in Lon- don and parts of southern England generally, the front-to-back alignment of spaces was also found in the north; see the room- by-room inventories of merchants' houses in Newcastle upon Tyne and Berwick in George Andrews, ed., Wills and Inventories from the Registry at Durham.

Because porch addi- tions frequently entailed making a claim on street space, the town realized its need to be cautious in protecting its own interests even as it allowed inhabitants to make these changes to their houses. In October 1642, for example, Edward Fletcher of Boston "hath liberty granted him to finish the Porch which he hath begun to set up, 3 foot into the Street, which is to remayne for his use, unlesse the Town shall hereafter find it to be inconvenient to the street, which if it be found, he shall remoove it out of the street." Similarly, in March 1658, William Pollard was reminded that while he could build his new porch, he was "to enjoy itt during the townes pleasure.""47 More typically, however, the town demanded a yearly rent in exchange for the space that porch- builders claimed from the public way. Richard Waite of Boston was granted in July 1652, "liber- tie to set up a porch befor his now dwelling house, three foot into the streat, and 6 foot broad, he payinge to the town treasurer six penc[e] every twentie and fifth day of March, from henceforth and forever." Six years later Ed- ward Scottow was required to pay twelve pence per year for his porch, and in 166o the town asked the widow of merchant Jacob Sheafe to hand over two shillings of ground rent for hers. Of the fifteen "porching-outs" recorded in the Suffolk County town and selectmen's records be- tween 1642 and 1672, nine were done by mer- chants, another four by wealthy artisans-turned- retailers (one of whom was also a church dea- con), and only two by working tradesmen (a cob- bler and a joiner) able to look up from their benches to see where fashion was drifting."4 With 47 Neve, City and Country Purchaser and Builder's Dictionary, p. 5.

If experimentation with hous- ing was the key cultural process under way, then any attempt to schematize one house form and grant it metaphorical-even metaphysical-pri- macy is destined to fail. From my critical introduction I have argued through examples some reasons why my earlier faith in Braudel's conception of material life and his basic architectural metaphor perhaps seems now to have been overly optimistic. His explicit formalism betrays a set of assumptions rooted in intersections of Marxism, structuralism, and evo- lutionary history that are no longer practically useful. To continue immediately implicating the term material life in the assumed legitimacy of le monde Braudellian is no longer productive. It will keep architectural historians, folklorists, and other scholars of material culture cloaked in the uncomfortable robes of lingering formalism and prevent them from embracing a concern for lived experience and cultural emergence as the locus of symbolic meanings in the cultural landscape, including all that that might entail. In place of the house as its metaphoric base, I suggest we begin to theorize American material life during the late seventeenth and early eigh- teenth centuries as situated in a dialectic of household and empire. On one hand, house- holds drew lines across age and gender in rela- tions of production. On the other, commerce, conquest, and plantation established transatlantic conduits of communication that implicated social formations in the colonies in the consolidation of the English nation, even as transculturation be- tween Europeans and shifting indigenous socie- ties accelerated and intensified. We may imagine household units as decentralized points in an ex- panding and diversifying process of both sym- bolic and instrumental relations of exchange and government. Our new subject will expand to in- clude many topics, among which I suggest the fol- lowing as priorities: 1) a concern for exchange re- lations, especially for the circulation (notjust the production or consumption) of objects as in- stances of objectified knowledge; 2) an analytical approach to maintenance relations and not just the spectacles of intention, accomplishment, and social display; 3) an exploration not only of the ways in which buildings are built literally but also how they are in part narrated into being through contracts, litigation, and prescriptive "stories"; and 4) an integration of material life at the level of the domestic household and its negotiated and different experiences of age, gender, and class, with the invisible politics of everday life. As did Braudel's initial description of material life, ours embraces the diverse temporalities that different spaces both created and reference and explores competing claims on skill, needs, commodities, peoples, and properties. As we reconceive mate- rial life in colonial American culture, we re- conceive also the languages that both stimulated and stigmatized the colonial situation.

Griggs Stephen M Mott Eliezer Moody Scr:/ 1On "dragon Summers," or dragon beams, see the discus- sion in Abbott Lowell Cummings, The Framed Houses in Massachu- setts Bay, 1625-1725 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, Belk- nap Press, 1979), pp. 55, 74; 2 examples of this framing technique for executing ajettied (cantilever) corner post support have been recorded in Ipswich, and 2 in Boston. One of the Bos- ton examples, the late seventeenth-century Sun Tavern, survived long enough to have the joinery of the dragon beam carefully measured and drawn; see Cummings, Framed Houses, p. 57, fig. 52. A variant of the dragon beam was employed at the brick Moses Peirce Hitchborn house in North Square, Boston, built ca. 1713, to support the roof adequately as it rose from the structure's acutely angled walls. This framing technique more closely approx- imates the southern (and eighteenth-century) use of the term; see Carl R. Lounsbury, ed., An Illustrated Glossary of Early Southern Ar- chitecture and Landscape (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), P. 119. Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises, or the Doctrine of Handy-Works (London, 1703; reprint, New York: Praeger, 1970), p. 16o, pl. 10 confuses dragon beams for the angled struts that stabilize the king-post in roof framing. 2 On "freezes" or jetties that were embellished with "cor- nishes," see Cummings, Framed Houses, pp. 74, 76, fig. 85. The same technique was also used to decorate exposed timbers at the Parson Capen house in Topsfield, Mass., the Samuel Porter house in Hadley, Mass., the Hyland and Caldwell houses in Guilford, Conn., and the Samuel Hollister house in South Glastonbury, Conn.; see J. Frederick Kelly, Early Domestic Architecture of Connecti- cut (New Haven, 1924; reprint, New York: Dover, 1963), pp. 62- 64, pl. X. See also Lounsbury, Illustrated Glossary, p. 96. ' Sparrs was a common seventeenth-century term for rafters, used as early as 1638 in a building contract for Samuel Symonds house in Ipswich; see Cummings, Framed Houses, p. 58. 4 On the making of "coven" or coved eaves or cornices, a typ- ical feature of late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century exte- rior decoration, see Cummings, Framed Houses, pp. 115, fig. 149 (ca. 1700 Pillsbury house, Newburyport, Mass.); and esp. pp. 133-34, fig- 18o, showing coved cornice detail of the ca. 1700- 1720o Hovey-Boardman house in Ipswich, Mass.
