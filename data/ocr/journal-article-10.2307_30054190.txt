When Giambattista Vico argued for the importance of poetry and rheto- ric at the University of Naples convocation in 1708, the instruments of science and the discoveries of scientists overshadowed his words. With killer pathogens newly visible through microscopes and the laws of gravity confirmed through 301</page><page sequence="2">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 35 / 2 telescopes, Vico knew students would be increasingly disinterested in the study of language. So Vico claimed that even though science provides important discover- ies, the empirical project ultimately ends in fractured views of a world created by God and in an arrogant politics of power. We can know only what we make, Vico writes. This principle of verum-factum sanctions his descent into the myths and parables made by the ancients to counter Descartes' distrust of language, to cor- rect Machiavelli's conspiratorial political science, and to unify the splintered, in- strumental vision of the Enlightenment. Vico surveys an encyclopedic range of texts in The New Science (1725) to recover the "modifications of mind" that produced the first poetic knowledge and that informed the rituals of religion, families, and pagan politics (374). Vico argues that language allowed the first persons to render a sense of the divine in a dangerous and chaotic world. Separated from God by the flood, their imperfect minds a "measure of all things" (120), man imagined the sky as "a great animat- ed body" where Jove wields thunderbolts (502). This anthropomorphic making of divinity through the tropes of poetic logic is a necessary expression common to all people and all nations. The Christian God, in providential contrast, views the civil world from above (2). The paradox of man creating God through language and God creating man through miracle is central to Vico's project and is one reason why he can be so difficult to read. He investigates particular human experience to posit univer- sal human actions in a writing style that his contemporaries and ours have called incoherent. Indeed, while Vico condemns the conceit of the moderns for relying on science to reach clarity and certainty as they ignore history and their own imaginative constructions of the world, some wonder if Vico displays a conceit of his own as he celebrates the poetic wisdom of probabilities uncovered through myth, while maintaining an all-knowing God who "confirms the truth of the Christian religion" (1047). Two recent texts offer important explanations of this Vichian paradox by examining the antithetical quality of his writing, the role of divinity and faith for politics and philosophy, and the importance of poetry and rhetoric for realizing wisdom. Guiseppe Mazzotta and James Robert Goetsch Jr. examine Vico's project to consider present day dismissals of language as a surface concern; poetry and rhetoric are, for Vico, the means to unite fractured human experience. In The New Map of the World: The Poetic Philosophy of Giambattista Vico, Mazzotta grants Vico visionary status as one who offers a counter-discourse to modernity through a spiraling style of thought and writing called recorso. Re- corso allows Vico to divine the future through the past, to discover the laws of history, and to integrate theology with politics and philosophy. In Vico's Axioms: A Geometry of the Human World, James Robert Goetsch Jr. details how Vico's deploys acutteza to discover a sense of the unfamiliar in The New Science, to reexamine the role of rhetoric and poetry to make knowledge in a world of con- tradiction. Both authors consider how Vico revalues myth and history to offer better understanding and appreciation of "the whole": what Mazzotta calls poet- ry's power to unify all of the arts and sciences, and what Goetsch calls an exacting style of imagination, or fantasia, which integrates us with nature and divinity. The whole, which Vico defines as maker's knowledge, or sapienza, can be realized only by blending the ancient and modern, logic and emotion, rationality and imagination. The spatial terms in the title of both texts suggest the importance of place (topos) for Vico, and each author uses the ars topica to reconcile some opposi- 302</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS tions apparent in Vico's work. The ars topica were the originating modifications of mind which Aristotle and Cicero formalized as methods for rhetorical inven- tion. Vico laments how students rush through Cartesian doubt to preemptive judgment rather than investigate probabilities through the ars topica, the loci or commonplaces attending to argument (On the Study Methods). Goetsch centers on Vico's topical philosophy to refute claims from Isaiah Berlin and others that Vico's texts are badly ordered and obtuse. Goetsch challenges this characteriza- tion by reading The New Science on Vico's "own terms" (xii). Goetsch searches for a sense of coherence and order that has remained unrecognized by exploring how the ars topica and the enthymeme can be deployed to engage contradiction and paradox in the probable realm of the social world. He references Aristotelian rhetoric and the paradoxical axioms of Heraclitus to assert that Vico challenges us to "unthink the obvious," to resist the tendency to convert the unfamiliar to the familiar (36). Goetsch begins by examining Vico's katabasis, his descent into the historical imagination of humans to recall fantasia as a fundamental method of discovery through discourse (44). This purpose directs Goetsch to the axioms that Vico provides-the acute sayings that connect disparate ideas and traditions. Vico's axioms, such as the universal human need to create rituals for religion, marriage, and burial (331), are for Goetsch the "alphabetic heads" that guide readers to apprehend patterns (pisteis) as a new kind of rhetorical demonstration that persuades with the use of the middle term. Goetsch asserts that because Vico spoke in the lived situations of Naples, the ars topica provide a "techne of presence" whereby Vico discovers middle terms or a medium to synthesize opposing views in arguments (74). The middle term, which Vico calls ligamen (Institutiones), unites word and world, idea and thing. Although the middle term has a long history in scholastism, Goetsch iden- tifies this technique in Aristotle's enthymeme and in the acute sayings and max- ims that Vico inherited from baroque writers. The enthymeme, which Aristotle identifies as a rhetorical counterpart to the syllogism, suggests how an audience can supply what is not explicitly stated in speech. Goetsch extends the traditional meaning to show how Aristotle probably used the term to suggest a melding of heart and mind, to connote a whole being balanced by intellect and emotion (82). Because scholastic nostalgia had reduced the enthymeme from a generat- ing method to an "abbreviated syllogism"(78), Goetsch claims that Vico synthe- sized baroque theories of acutezza, or ingenium, with classical rhetorical theory to regenerate the enthymeme. Detailing how enthymeme traditionally means "thought," Goetsch argues that Aristotle used the term as a method to synthesize mind and body, as a dialectical term to potentially appease contradictory ideas. For Aristotle, antithesis is the home of the enthymeme, and enthymemes connect opposites in brief form (Rhetoric 1401a6-7; 1400b27). Goetsch ends by identify- ing ligamen as the connecting term for oppositional ideas, as the element com- mon to speech and matter that rhetors can use to prove presence. Mazzotta begins his complex and ambitious text with the Autobiogra- phy (1731) to argue that Vico deploys the ars topica as a "topology of the self," a relocation of consciousness to culture, history, and philosophy (30). Mazzotta defines this sense of self as an "exotopy," which allows Vico to be "simultaneous- ly inside and outside his own world" (35). This oxymoron, whereby we can be figuratively inside and outside of a specific situation at the same time, informs Vico's entire project. Mazzotta argues that the figural nature of language allows thinkers to connect what would otherwise remain separate; poetry allows us to 303</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 35 / 2 engage chaos and contradiction, to think in various directions at the same time (xi). Acknowledging how all historical viewpoints are partial, Mazzotta explains that Vico's privileging of poetry provides a discursive means to transcend partic- ular viewpoints through the multiplicity and heterogeneity that verse can unfold (57). The poetic consciousness of the contradictory leads Mazzotta to claim that Vico is a political thinker who is aware of the limits of politics (xiii), a theologian who reorders philosophy (207). Poetry is, for Vico and Mazzotta, a means to unite heterogeneous strands of knowledge into "an encyclopedic totality" (10). Detailing among other things how Vico argues against Plato's rejection of the poet and Bacon's dismissal of poetry, while acknowledging the importance and value of these two writers, Mazzotta asserts that poetic logic educates the soul and shapes the logical construction of the whole (11). Mazzotta aims to reconstruct the specific cultural contexts that inform Vico's thought, and he examines two relatively unexamined works, The Neapol- itan Conspiracy (1703) and The Life of Antonio Carafa (1716) to show how Vico critiques the political conspiracies of secular politics. Throughout his text, Maz- zotta interprets Vico's analysis of poetry and myth and his styles of thinking and writing as visionary and sublime arts. The revaluing of poetry and religion in the face of secular science frames Mazzotta's major claim that Vico reads the miracu- lous in nature to counter the hegemonic role of modern philosophy, whereby belief is a weakness and poetry is a baroque irrelevance. Vico allows room for the miracle, Mazzotta writes, with a "semiotics of grace" (215). Miracles are, for Vico, a means to freedom. We are free to rethink modernity with wonder, vener- ation, and a pious desire for infinite wisdom (211; 255). This claim counters the limiting irony of Hobbes and Spinoza, who assert their freedom to philosophize but remain enslaved by the material world. In Vico's words, modern metaphysi- cians "make God and infinite Mind subject to fate" (New Science 335). Mazzotta also shrewdly anticipates critiques of Vico as an ironist of his age. He acknowledges how Vico's cyclical perspectives of corso and recorso imply a transhistorical stance (what Clifford Geertz would call a view from nowhere, sustained through rhetorical slight of hand). Mazzotta admits that because Vico continually contrasts his imaginative method with rational techniques, Vico may be replicating the distancing epistemological moves made by Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes. For Mazzotta, however, Vico's sense of piety allows him to embrace wisdom without the arrogance and deceit that is so common among the moderns. So while the "New" in Bacon's New Atlantis is an inductive method tied to em- pirical experimentation, the "New" for Vico is a fantastic vision as well as a rethinking of the relationship between theology and philosophy, poetry and prose. Vico assumes a self-reflexive irony that questions all presumed certainties, ac- cording to Mazzotta. In sum, these two texts provide important reevaluations of Vico that we can use to engage the world of specialized and sometimes fractured knowledge that the moderns inaugurated. 304</page></plain_text>
