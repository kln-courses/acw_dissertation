The donor of money was Henry G. Marquand, who in 1889 was to become the Mu- seum's second president; and the objects were those in the Gibbs Collection, which contained among other items a group of fine Peruvian tex- tiles. These fabrics were the first examples of pre-Columbian weaving to enter the Metropoli- tan's collections. It is interesting to continue to read what the Trustees had to say at that early date in the Mu- seum's history-only twelve years after its found- ing-about the place of American art of the pre-Columbian periods in the Museum's collec- tions. "The antiquities of our own continent should form a prominent feature in an American Museum, and we are charged with a special duty to make here a Museum of old American art for the study of American scholars as well as scholars from abroad. ... In gold and other metals, in stone, in textile fabrics and in pottery, are found works which sufficiently indicate the possession by ancient Americans of many useful arts, and a cultivation of the love of beauty, measured by ON THE C 0 V E R: Wool panel in interlocked cloth weave showing stylized anthropomorphic figures in bright blue, yellow, and red on black.

We ask attention to this subject as one in which members can by personal effort, assist the Trus- tees in establishing a department of old Ameri- can art." Although the course of the development of the Museum did not lead to such an establishment, our collection of Peruvian textiles, begun at that time, has nevertheless grown through the years by gift and by purchase. One of the most instru- mental in that growth was George D. Pratt, a Trustee from 1923 to 1935, who made a number of important gifts which raised our collection to a point of high eminence in this country. This past year the Museum has been able to acquire by purchase through the Fletcher Fund a group of particularly notable examples that further add to the wealth of our holdings. There are ten pieces in all, and each is distinguished by the brilliance of its colors and the effectiveness of its design. Technically they are marvels of intricate weaving. Four are from the southern coast of Peru and three are in the Nazca style, the other being in the related Paracas style.

They are early works, believed to date from about the third century B.C. through the seventh century A.D. (See Cover, Figures 2 and 4.) From the central coast of Peru comes a match- ing set of mantle, skirt, and girdle (Figure i): garments ornamented with an attractively con- ventionalized design brocaded on a fine cotton gauze. These pieces are of more recent date than the ones in the Nazca style-they may be as late as the tenth to the thirteenth century A.D. Two RIGHT: Fig. 3.

These two pieces seem slightly earlier in date than the matching set of apparel. But the outstanding piece in this group of new acquisitions is a shirt whose design is completely carried out in featherwork (Frontispiece). On a bright green feathery background are four winged human figures with skull-like heads in shades of orange, blue, black, and yellow. The colors are those of the feathers of tropical birds brought from eastern Peru, and the effect is spec- tacular. This rare piece is reputed to be the finest example of such work to have entered a museum in our country. It comes from the south coast, and is presumed to date from the ninth to the fourteenth century A.D. In our day, when highly conventionalized forms have become familiar through the agency of contemporary painting and sculpture, these textiles seem far less outre than they once did. We need not be put off from our enjoyment of them by their strangeness; with disabused eyes we can appreciate them for what they are: superlative creations of those remarkably gifted peoples whose cultures flourished in the New World long before the time of the Conquest. The consolidation of textile activities marked during the past year by the integration of the Costume Institute into the Museum's organiza- tion should prove catalytic on the future growth of these combined collections. The purchase of the Peruvian textiles described above, like that of the Russian ecclesiastical vestments recorded in the November Bulletin and of the famous Lewknor tapestry from Elizabethan England, soon to be displayed, may be taken as auguries of an activity that will raise our textile collec- tions to even higher levels of excellence.
