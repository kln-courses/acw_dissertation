<plain_text><page sequence="1">Washington and San Francisco Alexander Calder In an art world enamoured of guilty plea- sures ranging from a taste for kitsch to a fas- cination with sexual naughtiness, the work of Alexander Calder continues to offer innocent pleasures. The exhibition shown last year at the National Gallery of Art, Washington and at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (closed 1st December), commemorated the centenary of the artist's birth.' The good, if unsurprising, selection of work began with a small dog (Fig.94) and duck fabricated from a sheet of brass when Calder was only eleven years old. In Cal- der's case, the child was father to the man, in his love of animals and motion - the duck rocks on its bottom - as well as his ingenuity and dexterity. Yet Calder the child-like should not be confused with Calder the childish - the mature work is the the prod- uct of a refined as well as playful sensibility. The artist's father and grandfather were academic sculptors, and his mother was a painter. Trained as a mechanical engi- neer, Alexander later studied painting with 93.

George Luks, John Sloan and other artists associated with the Ashcan School, whose fascination with the city and popular enter- tainments he shared. He designed com- mercial toys, carved some wood sculptures with a folk-art flavour, and made his own toy circus (unfortunately too fragile to travel from its now-permanent home at the Whit- ney Museum in New York). He also worked as a sketch artist for a tabloid newspaper, demonstrating a gift for line drawing and caricature that served him well in his first important achievement, wire sculptures of diverse subjects including Josephine Baker (Fig.93), Calvin Coolidge, and Romulus, Remus and their she-wolf mother. Moving back and forth between New York and Paris in the 1920s and 30s, Calder became friends with such European mod- ernists as LDger, Mir6, Arp (who came up with the term 'stabile') and Duchamp (who provided the term 'mobile'). A 1930 visit to Mondrian's studio convinced Calder to shift to abstraction, though many of his works remain 'semi-abstract'. The mobiles suggest birds as well as branching plant forms, while the stabiles almost always suggest bio- or anthropomorphism even when not mod- elled after specific creatures (Fig.95). Calder's popularity is helped by the fact that his work seems so removed from fine art. A mobile, after all, is as likely to be as- sociated with a child's crib as with an art museum. This exhibition stressed Calder's status as an innovator in sculpture. The rhetoric may be tired, but the observation is true: the mobiles and stabiles are singular, and signature, achievements. Because they are so familiar, however, the revelations in this show were mainly to be found elsewhere. In a series of motorised pieces from the 30s that are also 'mobiles', Calder experi- mented with regular motion, an approach he eventually abandoned for the unprogram- med movement induced by air currents. In another group of works from the same decade, Calder set sculptural elements with- in picture frames or in front of monochrome panels. Each work is part mobile, part wall piece (or shadow-on-panel piece), without appearing to be as rarified or self-conscious as does more recent conceptual art using similar devices. During the Second World War, when Calder could not get metal, he built works he called 'constellations', and then in 1950-51 the related but more archi- tectural 'towers'. Like some of his works from the 30s, the constellations resemble scien- tific models for atoms or astronomical sys- tems, with carved and painted elements connected by wires. They suggest that the artist was not being grandiose or metaphor- ical when he said the universe was his guide. He clearly liked the sense of order and con- nectedness of science. Whether or not Calder 'invented' the mobile as an art form, he remains its great- est master. The mobiles are wonders, dis- playing Calder's keen awareness of balance as both a mechanical and an aesthetic prin- ciple. They reveal an elegant design sense, beginning with the way the linear wires com- plement the geometric shapes of the sus- pended forms. The mobiles, like much of Calder's art, often manage to be at once witty and lyrical, with the wit frequently appearing in a love of dramatic counter- point, as when a single element is set against many large ones, or a single small element in one colour against many in another. It should not be held against Calder that his art - modern but not intellectually demanding or politically charged - became so popular with those seeking to fill bank lob- bies, museum and airport atria, or the enor- mous plazas accompanying International- style skyscrapers. Calder made some del- ightful miniature mobiles, but he also had a gift for the monumental, as is evident in the best of the large stabiles, which helped transform public sculpture. Some Calders use hybrid forms that com- bine stabile bases with mobile tops, for in- stance Southemrn cross (1963; Fig.96), one of three large-scale pieces installed in a park across from the San Francisco museum. Although the maquette for Southemrn cross has a red base, on display in the exhibition it unmistakeably recalled the nearby Perforn- ing seal (1950), an all-black work in which the stylised figure of the animal balances on its nose not one but a whole set of balls, config- ured as a mobile. The resemblance provid- ed one more reminder that the young boy who liked animals and the youthful artist in love with the circus grew into a man whose work retained the spirit of child's play. In 1932, on the occasion of a New York gallery exhibit, Calder asked, 'Why must art be static?' Early and late, small and large, his work often answered that question, and posed another: 'Why can't art be fun?'
