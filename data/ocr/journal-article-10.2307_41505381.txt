The major exhibition "Treasures of Ancient Nigeria" opened at the Institute on 17 January. This exhibition, consisting of some 100 objects of bronze, terracotta, and ivory from the ancient cultures of Nok, Ife, and Benin, established for the first time the long and accomplished heritage of the Nigerian people. The exhibition was beautifully installed by Brooklyn designer Charles B. Froom and was accompanied by a fine catalogue, co- authored by Dr. Ekpo Eyo and Dr. Frank Willett and illustrated by Detroit pho- tographer Dirk Bakker, that was produced by the museum's Publications Depart- ment under the supervision of Rollyn Krichbaum. The Education Department produced a film, narrated by Dr. Willett, which was shown at the entrance to the exhibition. Press coverage was extremely good, including an hour-long tel- evision documentary made by French national television. The generosity of the Nigerian government in permitting its national treasures to leave the country was one of the greatest acts of goodwill that Nigeria could have extended to the American people. The Michigan- Wisconsin Pipeline Company subsidized three free evening openings during Black History Month (February), and many institutions held programs involving the exhibition, such as the Black Studies Program of Wayne State University and Your Heritage House. The final attend- ance was 57,876. The exhibition was made possible by grants from the Mobil Oil Corporation and the National Endowment for the Arts. Additional expenses were shared with the participating museums, the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Last summer a plastic "envelope" was suspended over the North Court, and construction began on the new African and Native American Galleries. The firm of John Hilberry and Associates has collaborated with Charles B. Froom in rede- signing this area to display approximately one-third of the African and Native American collections. Funded by the Founders Society, bond issues from the City of Detroit, and private sources, including generous grants from the J. L. Hudson Company and the Webber Foundations, the new galleries are scheduled to open in July 1980. At that time, commemorative plaques honoring these two major donors and the founding of the African Art Gallery Committee (now the Friends of African Art) will be placed in the complex. Several important works were added to the collections this year. Outstanding among these was a set of ten Whistles (see figs. 8 and 9) from the Myombe people of the Lower Congo. Formerly in the Stephen Chauvet Collection, these tiny masterpieces constitute one of the few nearly complete sets of hunting charms known to exist. Also acquired were a rare anthropomorphic Grebo Board (fig. 49), dating from the late 19th century, and a superb Senufo Kpelie Society Mask (fig. 1), formerly in the Harry Franklin Collection. In the field of Native American art, an exceptionally fine Apache storage Basket (fig. 7) in a rare early style was acquired through the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Stroh and the Stroh Brewery Foundation Fund. Also deserving of mention are two outstanding prehistoric pottery vessels: a Storage Jar from the Anasazi culture, c. A.D. 900-1200, and a long-necked Bottle (fig. 39) from the Late Mis- sissippian/Caddoan culture, c. A.D. 1200-1700. The acquisition of both of these pieces was made possible by the Junior Council Fund. The Native American collections will be further enriched by a number of objects that the museum is in the process of acquiring from the Chandler-Pohrt Collection of Woodlands and Plains art. It is one pf the finest collections of its type, considered comparable to the Speyer Collection, which was recently acquired in Germany by the National Museums of Canada. The Chandler-Pohrt Collection includes many examples of pre-1850 art and a large number of early 18th-century examples. 181</page><page sequence="3">Our departmental collections received wider exposure this year through par- ticipation in outreach programs and loans to a number of outstate and sister institutions. Although special exhibitions and planning for the new installation have been our major focus, the staff continues to spend a great deal of time researching objects in the collections and contributing to the literature in the field, in order to expand the public's general appreciation of the collections. For the first time in the museum's history, an issue of the Bulletin was devoted solely to this department's collections. Several prominent scholars in the field contributed articles, and Michael Kan and William Wierzbowski co-authored an article on the Plains Indian Shield which once belonged to General George Armstrong Custer. Assisting the curator in the ongoing work of the department have been Wil- liam Wierzbowski, Charles Lewis, Vada Dunifer, and David Penney, Research Assistants, and Patricia Ryan, Toni Wrobel, and Judi Pauli, Executive Secretaries. Judith Weston of the Conservation Services Laboratory has been on special assignment in this department. Plans for future exhibitions are under way involving several other major American museums. In February the department announced plans for the first comprehensive exhibition of Pre-Columbian art from Costa Rican museums and private collections. The Michigan National Corporation helped fund the prelim- inary planning of this exhibition, which will include approximately 300 gold, jade, ceramic, and stone objects, dating from 300 B.C. to A.D. 1200. The Presi- dent and First Lady of Costa Rica, Mr. and Mrs. Rodrigo Carazo Odio, have been most supportive of this exhibition, slated to open in Detroit in December 1981. Julie Jones, Curator of Pre-Columbian Art at the .Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, will be co-curating the exhibition. Dr. Labelle Prussin has been collaborating with the curator for some years in planning "Traditional Islamic Arts and Architecture in Sub-Saharan West Africa," an exhibition which will include photographs and approximately 50 objects illustrating the impact of Islam on traditional West African arts and architecture in the sub-Saharan region. The National Endowment for the Humanities has provided a planning grant. This exhibition is scheduled for 1982 and will be the occasion of a major symposium on the subject.

West's first preparatory sketch for this apocalyptic theme is one of the earliest paintings to express the spirit of Romanticism. Intended as a study for a larger work destined for King George Ill's Chapel of Revealed Religion at Windsor Castle, this is the sketch West took with him to Paris in 1802, where it astounded the French and became the object of much critical discussion. It was admired by the Prince Regent, William Beckford, and Napoleon Bonaparte, but West declined all offers for its purchase until 1819, when it was acquired by the Earl of Egremont. The visionary character of the subject, which recounts the allegorical redemption of mankind, and the vivid and dynamic manner of its execution, make it of primary importance in West's career and a major addition to our representation of early American Romanticism. Notre Dame Cathedral , Paris , 1888 is a splendid example of Hassam's early period, before he fully adopted the manner of the French Impressionists. The artist, who had studied under Boulanger and Lefebvre, won his first award in the Paris Salon the following year (1889). The addition of this urban scene, from Hassam's most desirable decade, fills out our understanding of the artist, who has been represented in the collections by two later landscapes. The decorative arts collections were enriched this year by the purchase of eight pieces of French Canadian silver, adding strength to one of the finest collections of its kind in this country. Several of these pieces introduce new forms by artists who are already represented in the Institute, while the fine cruet tray attributed to Francois Ranvoyze (1739-1819) constitutes the first exam- ple of the work of this highly significant 18th-century craftsman to enter the collections. A ciborium by an unknown 18th-century Brazilian silversmith is our first acquisition in this area. Gifts to the collections included a beautiful Chinese export Teapot (fig. 34) made for the American trade about 1760. The piece is a very rare type, having a pink lotus pattern with applied vine trim, and was given by the Associates of the American Wing in memory of Evelyn Wilkins, past Secretary of the Asso- ciates and a long-time member of the Museum Shops Advisory Committee. Mr. M. B. Waterbury of Lake Oswego, Oregon, presented us with two coverlets, a white summer spread in a variant of the Double Rose pattern, and a blue and white winter coverlet in the same pattern, both made by Abram William Van Doren in 1846 for Sarah H. Morrison of Oakland County, Michigan. Van Doren is a known Michigan weaver, and this pair of spreads represents a fortunate instance of preservation, the two having remained together for 132 years in a private collection. We also received a pair of portraits, Julia A. M. Peck at age 22, and Mary P. Fiske at age 34, painted in 1838 by the itinerant portrait painter John Wilkie. These interesting examples of the primitive style favored by early artisan- painters were the gifts of Betsey Mast Reid in memory of her aunt, Jane Betsey Welling. From Gilbert M. Frimet we received an oil sketch by George Luks (1867- 1933) of The Veteran , and from Mrs. Pearl Parker Penick our first example of Rookwood pottery, a small clay Jug (fig. 32) decorated with a flying bird and dated 1883. Our major American exhibition this year, "John Singer Sargent and the Edwardian Age," proved to be highly popular with the general public, scholars, and critics alike, attracting 68,000 viewers during its mid -October through early December showing. National and local coverage of the exhibition was excep- tional, with articles appearing in such important publications as Time , Smithson- ian , and Art in America. Major newspapers, including the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , and the Toronto Globe and Mail, carried extremely favorable reviews. The exhibition, beautifully designed by Herbert Schmidt, Chief Designer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was installed in Gallery 250 by the curator. Among the 97 works featured in this exhibition, the first since the 184</page><page sequence="6">artist's death in 1925 to focus on the paintings for which he was renowned in his own time, were the Metropolitan Museum of Art's controversial Madame X, the superb portrait of the four Daughters of Edward D. Boit from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Galleries of Scotland's seductive Lady Agnew, and Detroit's portrait of the elegant Madame Paul Poirson. The department continued work on our forthcoming exhibition, "American Art and the Quest for Unity, 1876-1893," scheduled for the fall of 1982. Kathleen Pyne is project coordinator for this exhibition, which is the first attempt to examine and document the American search for new artistic directions during the 17-year period between the Philadelphia Centennial and the World's Colum- bian Exposition in Chicago. It is being funded in part by both the Michigan Council for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. Figure 10.

Following acceptance of the concept, a working model was con- structed and placed on view in the Director's reception area. The Conservation Services Laboratory is presently engaged in work on the American paintings and sculpture collections, with the decorative arts to follow. A grant request to the National Endowment for the Arts has been prepared by the chief conserv- ator and the curator asking for special funding in order to proceed with con- servation work on the American furniture collections. Meetings will be scheduled later this year between the various people involved in this project to define further design issues and decide the mode of operation and scheduling. Educational activities included the Associates of the American Wing trip to Providence and Newport, Rhode Island. Both the trip and lecture series are detailed in the Associates' report, which begins on p. 232. There were several staff changes this year. Former Assistant Curator Kathleen Pyne was appointed Research Associate in September when she returned to the University of Michigan to resume graduate studies in preparation for a Ph.D. degree. From December through May we were fortunate to have the help of Deborah Fenton and Leslie Campbell, both graduate students at the Univer- sity of Michigan, as part-time research assistants. Anita Calvert's appointment on 29 June 1979 as the department's first full-time secretary has contributed greatly to our overall efficiency during this period of change. We are grateful to the Michigan Chapter of the Colonial Dames of America for their continued support of Whitby Hall, which this year took the form of new seat covers for two Chippendale chairs, their annual Christmas decorations, and general weekly maintenance. Finally, we wish to thank the Associates of the American Wing for their valuable assistance throughout the year.

In the preceding annual report we were able to announce the acquisition of two important Persian reliefs from Persepolis. To these was added the impressive relief of a Persian Official (fig. 33), purchased with the Robert H. Tannahill Fund and monies acquired by a special fund-raising drive carried out by members of the Antiquaries. The Ancient Per- sian Gallery was completely reinstalled with the new reliefs from Persepolis as the focus of the new installation. Another significant addition to the collections was a large number of objects obtained from noted Egyptologist Richard A. Parker, which included an important group of Pre-dynastic material - scarabs, amulets, small sculptures, and other decorative objects - as well as a significant collection of ostraca - Egyptian writing and texts - in hieratic, demotic, and Cop- tic scripts. This section of the Parker material provides many excellent examples not previously represented in the collections of the Institute. A red-figure Kylix (fig. 11) attributed to the Triptolemos Painter and dated to about 480 B.C. was acquired from the Hill Memorial and the William H. Murphy Funds. This is the first example of red-figure painting on the kylix shape to enter the collection and fills a gap in our representation of Greek ceramics. A group of Urartian belt fragments were acquired from the Dr. and Mrs. Arthur Bloom Fund, the first examples of the art of the Urartian peoples, who lived in what is now Eastern Turkey, to enter the collection. Other acquisitions included examples of Roman and South Italian pottery, both gifts and purchases. In addition to the reinstallation of the Ancient Persian Gallery, the Egyptian Gallery and the adjacent balcony were also reinstalled with cases that enable us to show the Egyptian material in greater depth. Research on the collection, which is always considered one of the most important functions of the department, continued. As a part of this effort, the Silver Helmet and Vessel from ancient Romania were sent to the research labo- ratories of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they were analyzed for their Figure 11.

We wish to thank the officials of the Metropolitan Museum and the staff of the laboratory for this important work on these objects. A number of loans were approved and sent out by the department, particu- larly to museums and universities in the State of Michigan. The University- Liggett Antique Show this year featured a loan exhibition of Ancient art from the department, and the catalogue of the show included three articles by staff members, as well as many photographs from the Ancient collections. The staff of the department was represented in a number of journals and other publications by articles and book reviews. The curator lectured for groups in the Detroit-Windsor area, as well as participating in an Archaeological Insti- tute of America lecture tour which took him to Oregon and California. The curator continued his activity with the Brooklyn Museum excavations at the Mut Temple Karnak, Luxor, Egypt, as Associate Field Director for the 1980 sea- son; Elsie H. Peck was able to join the excavation as Field Archeologist for most of the season. Mrs. Peck was promoted from Research Associate to Associate Curator of Near Eastern Art. As part of her work with the Islamic collections, she has continued her project of rotating textiles and oriental rugs in the Islamic Gallery. In this regard we would like to thank Mary Ballard of the Conservation Services Laboratory for her aid and assistance. Timothy Motz, Assistant Curator, read a paper on Detroit's collection of Irish gold at the annual meetings of the Midwest Art History Society in Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Motz was also the recipient of a travel grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities which enabled him to visit and study museums and archeological sites in Italy, Greece, and the Aegean. Members of the department assisted with the many activities of the Anti- quaries that are discussed in a separate section of this report. Of note was a trip to the Tutankhamun exhibition in Toronto led by Mr. and Mrs. Peck. William H.

"Pacific Passage: Recent Acquisitions from China and Japan" opened at an evening reception on 7 November and continued on view in the Textile Galleries through April. The exhibition provided an oppor- tunity to see for the first time Asian acquisitions collected over the past four years and included a variety of Chinese lacquers, Japanese ceramics, and Jap- anese and Chinese paintings. The contents clearly reflected the increased emphasis on oriental acquisitions since the founding of the Stoddard Fund for Asian Art in 1977. In response to a growing statewide interest in Asian art, "Oriental Ceramics from the Collection of Justice and Mrs. G. Mennen Williams" was circulated as a Detroit Institute of Arts traveling exhibition. Featured were Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese wares selected from a large and varied collection originally acquired by the Williamses and subsequently donated to the Detroit Institute of Arts. This exhibition was co-organized by the curator and Christine Ruby, Statewide Services Coordinator, and was accompanied by an illustrated cata- logue written by Andrea P. A. Belloli of the Publications Department. New acquisitions continued to play a large role in department activities. Com- pared to recent years, the pace slowed in the area of Chinese painting, although a rare landscape, Bright Lake and Beautiful Mountain (fig. 4 ) by Ch'en Kua, deserves special mention. Dated to 1549, the composition is painted in ink on a long, narrow, elegantly proportioned hanging scroll. This landscape belongs to the same literati tradition as The First Prose Poem on the Red Cliff by Wen Cheng-Ming (76.3) and is a most welcome addition to the Ming period painting collection. Special consideration has been given to building the collection of Chinese and Japanese lacquers. Early in the year six monochrome lacquers of the Sung Figure 12.

Stoddard, Mr. Simeon H. Stoddard, Mr. Stanford D. Stoddard, and an Anonymous Donor (80.29). 189</page><page sequence="11">and Yuan periods were acquired. This group, comprised of four plates, a cup stand, and a covered box, exhibits an interesting diversity of function, shape, and color. Later in the year the acquisition of an important late Yuan/early Ming (14th-century) lacquer Plate, intricately carved with crane and chrysanthemum motifs (fig. 13 ), was made possible through the generosity of the Gerald W. Chamberlin Foundation, Inc., and the Stoddard Fund for Asian Art. These recent additions represent the first Chinese lacquers to be acquired for Detroit. Until recently our collection of Japanese lacquer had consisted wholly of 19th- and 20th-century examples. This year three earlier pieces were acquired, each one an extremely fine example of an important style of lacquer art. A splendid Muromachi period (1392-1573) heishi (wine flask) was added to the collection, once again through the generosity of the Gerald W. Chamberlin Foundation, Inc., and the Stoddard Fund for Asian Art. The painted Negoro type vessel is both graceful in shape and elegantly decorated with motifs of pine, bamboo, crane, and winged tortoise (fig. 45). A slightly later piece, dated to the Momo- yama period (1573-1615), is a butterfly-legged black lacquer tray with maki-e designs of paulo wnia and crane roundel crests. The type is known as Kodai-ji lacquer and, like the Negoro heishi , it is the first example of its kind in the collection. The most recent addition is a superb black lacquer Writing Box (suzuri- bako or ink-stone case), lavishly embellished with mother-of-pearl, gold, and lead. An autumnal theme - a water buffalo at rest among bush clover - is the subject of the cover exterior; the insides of both cover and box (fig. 12) display bridge, wave, and pine designs. The piece is dated to the late 17th/early 18th centuries and carries the signature of Ogata Korin. It is our intention that these acquisitions will form the nucleus of a growing collection of both Chinese and Japanese lacquer. This past year the Michigan National Corporation initiated a policy of donat- ing Asian art works to the Detroit Institute of Arts with the intent that these objects be placed on extended loan to specified museums throughout Michigan. The first acquisition for this purpose was a landscape fan painting in ink and colors, dated to 1708, by the Chinese master Wang Yuan-ch'i, which is now on extended loan to the Flint Institute of Arts. The department is most appreciative of the Michigan National Corporation's efforts in initiating this program, which will ultimately make Asian art accessible throughout the state. Staff changes in the department included the creation of a new position, Curatorial Assistant, which was ably assumed by Sandra F. Collins. Anne Fry became Department Secretary and has been indispensible in expediting the varied activities within these offices. Vera Wolfe was once again faithfully on call to help with a multitude of projects for both the department and the Friends of Asian Art. As chair of the Friends, Charles M. Endicott enthusiastically guided the organization through its third year of activities. Both the competence and the keen interest these individuals have contributed to this department are greatly appreciated. The curator wishes to express special gratitude to the many individuals who have contributed to the growth of the Asian department. Deep appreciation goes once again to the Stoddard family. This year it is a particular pleasure to include Elizabeth Stoddard, Simeon Stoddard, and Stanford D. Stoddard in addition to Mrs. Howard J. Stoddard and Mr. and Mrs. Stanford C. Stoddard. Very special thanks are also extended to Mr. and Mrs. George M. Endicott and the Gerald W. Chamberlin Foundation, Inc., for their continued generous sup- port of the Asian acquisitions program. It is as a result of such devotion and commitment by many individuals that this department has experienced such a heartening revitalization. Suzanne W.

As is always the case, the acquisition of works of art remained a significant concern. In the area of special exhibitions, plans were laid for the monumental show of 19th-century French sculpture from American collections, "The Romantics to Rodin: French Nineteenth-Century Sculpture," organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The exhibition is supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Michigan Council for the Arts and will open this October. A great deal of the department's energies went toward the devel- opment of "Gods, Saints, and Heroes: Dutch Painting in the Age of Rembrandt." This exhibition, which is being co-organized with Washington's National Gallery of Art and Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, will focus on works with historical themes rather than the scenes of everyday life, landscapes, and still lifes that we have come to know as 17th-century Dutch painting. Supported by a planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and a major grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, this show will be idemnified by the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities, making possible its American appearances. This exhibition promises to be the most important display of Dutch paintings since the great celebrations, over a decade ago, in honor of Rembrandt on the 300th anniversary of his death. It will open in Detroit in February 1981. Work continued on the exceptional international exhibition "The Golden Age of Naples: Art and Civilization Under the Bourbons, 1734-1805." This show will be shared with the Art Institute of Chicago and is the American version of "Civilta del '700 a Napoli," organized by the Museo e Gallerie Nazionali di Capodimonte at Naples. The Detroit showing will take place in the summer of 1981. We also worked toward the installation of "Enrollment of the Volunteers: Thomas Couture and the Painting of History," an exhibition organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield, Massachusetts, which will open in July 1980. All of these shows will be accompanied by scholarly catalogues and general exhibition guides. Although the department was primarily in a planning year, it was not totally quiet on the exhibition front. During March and April 1980 we presented 58 masterpieces from the collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza. This' Swiss- based collection has been heralded as one of the most important in private hands in the world. The show was organized by the International Exhibitions Foundation and was supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and United Technologies Corporation. The department began planning for the renovation and reinstallation of the Northern European Galleries on the third floor of the Ford Wing. This project is conceived in three phases: Phase I, funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, will deal with the Dutch and Flemish collections; Phases II and III will be devoted to the German and English collections, respec- tively. This sequence will complete the reinstallation and renovation of the European Galleries, which began with the Italian Wing in 1977, and was fol- lowed by the French Galleries and Textile Galleries in 1978 and 1979. Progress continued to be made this year on the series of six catalogues of European paintings in the permanent collection. These books/ under the direc- tion of the Publications Department, will begin to appear in the near future. The department's major focus was the growth of the collections. There was considerable activity in the field of French painting. Our 18th-century holdings were enhanced by a charming Boucher-like genre scene, Bird's Nest , by the little- known but talented artist Jean Baptiste Charpentier (1728-1806), the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph L. Polk in memory of Agnes R. Polk. This year we added another work, Saint John the Evangelist (fig. 31 ), by the late 18th-century painter Francois 193</page><page sequence="15">Andre Vincent. This painting, acquired through the Founders Society Acquisi- tions Fund, is our first religious subject by one of Jacques Louis David's contem- poraries. Another work from the same period is the masterful sketch of the Education of Achilles by the gifted artist Jean Baptiste Regnault (1754-1829), which was acquired through the Robert H. Tannahill Foundation Fund. Kitchen Interior by Pierre Duval-Lecamus (1790-1854) is an excellent example of genre painting in the classical style. The acquisition of this work was made possible by the Mr. and Mrs. Benson Ford Fund. One of the most beautiful paintings to enter the French collections is the aggressively painted Storm: The Quarry at Montmartre (fig. 16) by Georges Michel (1763-1843). The generous gift of Mr. and Mrs. Ber- nard F. Walker, this work added substantial depth to our landscape holdings. As a result of the acquisition of paintings by Henri Lehmann and Alexandre Jean Baptiste Hesse, we are now able to show well the various tendencies of French portraiture during the mid-19th century. Lehmann's Ingres-like portrait of Jean Louis Gabriel , Rector of St. Merri (fig. 44) was a Founders Society Purchase, and Hesse's opulent Portrait of a Young Woman (fig. 41) was acquired through the Robert H. Tannahill Foundation Fund, a source of so many acquisitions over the past decade. Last Load of Wheat , a painting by Jules Jacques Veyrassat (1828-1893), enables us to study an artist attempting to reconcile Impressionist and tradi- tional approaches. This interesting painting was another kind gift from Mr. and Mrs. Bernard F. Walker. One of the most impressive works to enter the collections during the year was The Fortune Teller (fig. 3) by the Italian master Bartolomeo Manfredi (c. 1580- 1620). The addition of this masterpiece, acquired through the Founders Society Acquisitions Fund, makes our collection of Caravaggesque paintings one of the finest in America. Our holdings of later Italian paintings from Naples increased substantially with a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Lester Gruber, the delicately rendered Danae by Paolo de Matteis (1662-1728), and the Founders Society purchase of two panels by Filippo Falciatore (active 1728-1768). Tarantella at Mergellina (fig. 15) and Concert in a Garden are characterized by their Rococo grace, delicate color, and subtle humor. In the field of English painting the collections were enhanced by two works, Henry Greswolde Lewis and Mrs. Elizabeth Lewis , by the famous pastellist Daniel Gardner (1750-1805). These paired portraits were part of the bequest of Mrs. Doris Grigaut, sister-in-law of the late Paul Grigaut, former curator and assistant director of the Institute. The department also added several significant pieces of sculpture, the most important of which is a superbly composed and executed boxwood miniature triptych (fig. 14) depicting the Nativity , Annunciation to the Shepherds , and Pres- entation in the Temple on the upper panels and the Adoration of the Magi on a small, circular lower panel. This exquisite work by an anonymous 16th-century Flemish carver was acquired through the Robert H. Tannahill Foundation, the Mr. and Mrs. Benson Ford, and the Henry Ford II Funds. In memory of Dr. William R. Valentiner, Michael Hall of New York donated a bronze medallion by the French sculptor Guillaume Dupre (c. 1574-1647) of Marie de' Medici as Queen of France. To our English collections we added another work by the famous Victorian artist Sir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934), whose elegant Saint George (fig. 5) was acquired through the Robert H. Tannahill Foundation Fund. The past year has been one of increased activity in the area of decorative arts. One of the Institute's most important acquisitions was the superbly crafted Writing Desk (fig. 24) attributed to the late 17th-century German master Anton Luchtenstein. This magnificent object was purchased with monies from the Henry Ford II and New Endowment Funds. We also received thoughtful gifts of silver (fig. 28) and other decorative art objects from Raymond C. Smith, James O. Keene, and Svetoslav Hlopoff. Last but not least, our extensive textile col- 194</page><page sequence="16">lections were augmented by several gifts from Mr. and Mrs. John H. Moor and Mrs. Henry Wubbe. All of these generous contributions are listed below. During the year the curator served on the policy board for the Museums Program of the National Endowment for the Arts and on the board of the Joint Arts Commission for the Wayne State University Health Care Institute and Detroit Receiving Hospital. The departmental staff, Alan P. Darr and Iva Lisikewycz, have assisted in all activities extremely well, assuming major responsibilities on all projects. Grat- itude is expressed to them and to Clara Janigian, Department Secretary, who helps in so many ways. Wayne State University work-study student Melanie Bazil made all our tasks easier, and we were fortunate to have Jandava Cattron from Indiana University as a summer intern. We are grateful to Dr. Albert Blankert for his consultation on "Gods, Saints, and Heroes'7 and to Charles B. Froom Design Associates for work on the installation of the permanent collec- tion as well as special exhibitions. Our appreciation also goes to European Advisory Committee members Mrs. Allan Shelden III and Mrs. Joseph L. Hud- son, Jr. Finally, we express our gratitude to the Department of Buildings and Grounds, the Conservation Services Laboratory, and the Research Library for their assistance with numerous departmental projects.

Completion of the $1,250,000 complex in the southwest corner of the Main Building was made possible by an endowment from Mr. and Mrs. Alan E. Schwartz and their children, Marc, Kurt, and Ruthanne. In recognition of their generous gift, our handsome new galler- ies, including the Old Master, the Contemporary, and the Octagon Galleries, will be known as the Schwartz Graphic Arts Galleries. A portion of the Schwartz endowment has been reserved for an acquisitions fund for the department. The interest of the Schwartz family in the graphic arts and their support of the department are deeply appreciated. Adjacent to the Schwartz Graphic Arts Galleries, the spacious study room/ library, created with funds from the Clark Bequest, has been memorialized as the Ina M. Clark Study Room. Grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Kresge Foundation, and the State of Michigan were utilized to con- struct our extensive storage, office, and exhibition preparation areas. With these magnificent new facilities we look forward to presenting a program of changing exhibitions and to making our collection available for study and research. Our acquisitions program received a welcome impetus with a $50,000 grant to the Founders Society for an addition to the Lee and Tina Hills Graphic Arts Fund. This grant was made by the Knight Foundation in recognition of Mr. Hills' long tenure as President of the Arts Commission and the progress of the Art Institute under his leadership. With monies from the Hills Fund, we have been able to add many fine prints and photographs to the collection, including this year's acquisition of a beautiful albumen print by the- distinguished 19th- century topographical photographer Robert MacPherson, View of Rome from the Pincio (fig. 27); one of Walker Evans' celebrated documentary studies made dur- ing the Depression for the Farm Security Administration, Sharecropper's Family , Hale County, Alabama , 1936; a nude study by Harry Callahan; and a brilliant evocation of the dance by George Piatt Lynes, Ballet Orpheus with Noguchi Sculp- ture (fig. 23). Other significant purchases were Man Ray's Magnolia Blossom, Antibes, 1926 (fig. 18), Paul Strand's City Hall , Maine, 1930 (fig. 47), and Edward Weston's Nude, 1934 (fig. 46). Two of Alexander Gardner's penetrating portraits entitled Walt Whitman, gifts from Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Feinberg in honor of the 80th birthday of Professor Thelma James, and Julia Margaret Cameron's beautiful study Mrs. Herbert Duckworth (fig. 35), a gift from Frederic L. Marble- stone, greatly enhanced our collection of portrait photographs. Especially sig- nificant was the purchase of one of the first color photographs to enter our collection, Paul Outerbridge, Jr.'s Images of Deauville, c. 1935 (cover), a splendid example of this photographer's mastery of the color carbro process. John Singer Sargent's portrait Loyse Knowles, 1911 (fig. 40), and Mary Cassatt's color aquatint and drypoint The Bare-Footed Child, 1898 (fig. 48) were welcome additions to our American collection, as we did not own any examples of Sar- gent's brilliant charcoal sketches or of Cassatt's masterful color prints. A fine charcoal and conte crayon study by Francois Bonvin, The Artist's Wife Reading, 1861 (fig. 19), strengthened our holdings of 19th-century French drawings. In the area of contemporary prints, our most spectacular purchase was Chuck Close's monumental print Keith, 1972, a mezzotint with collage and watercolor. As the graphic art of Andy Warhol was not well represented in our collection, we were pleased to receive as a gift from Richard Brpdie the complete album of silkscreen portraits entitled Mao Tse-Tung, 1972. Another important album of screenprints, Homage to the Square Soft Edge-Hard Edge, by the great modern master Josef Albers, was received from Mr. and Mrs. Kaye G. Frank. Our poster collection was immeasurably strengthened by a gift from Mark Weglarski of 168 Polish posters, including rare and celebrated examples of this brilliant manifes- 197</page><page sequence="19">Figure 17.

After an exhibition of Barnett Newman's drawings in August and September, our exhibition program was temporarily suspended pending the opening of our new galleries. Nevertheless, exhibition planning and organization occupied a major part of staff time. In the first half of 1979 Associate Curator Marilyn Symmes traveled extensively in this country, visiting artists and museums in connection with "Cliche- verre: Hand-Drawn, Light-Printed, A Survey of the Medium from 1839 to the Present," the premiere exhibition in the Schwartz Graphic Arts Galleries. This comprehensive survey is a pioneering study of a medium that combines elements of both photography and printmaking. In May 1979 Ms. Symmes joined Elizabeth Glassman, co-author of the catalogue, in Paris, where they pursued their research on 19th-century cliche-verre and made arrangements for loans from European collections. They spent the summer writ- ing the catalogue, and the manuscript was completed in September 1979. Editing in collaboration with the Publications Department was begun by Ms. Symmes in October with a 1 July 1980 publication goal for the opening of the exhibition on 12 July. The details of catalogue production and the installation of the exhi- bition occupied Ms. Symmes from January 1980 until the opening events. In August Ms. Sharp traveled to Coburg in West Germany, where she con- ferred with Professor Charles Talbot of Smith College and with the staff of the Kunstsammlungen der Veste Coburg concerning plans for the exhibition "From a Mighty Fortress: Reformation Prints, Drawings, and Books in the Coburg Collections 1480-1560." Professor Talbot, Professor Lewis Spitz of Stanford Uni- versity, and Professor Christiane Andersson of Columbia University are pre- paring the catalogue for this major loan exhibition, which is supported by a 198</page><page sequence="20">planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The exhibi- tion will open in Detroit in the fall of 1981 and then will be shown in Ottawa at the National Gallery of Canada. In March Ms. Sharp and Mary Cazort, Curator of Drawings at the National Gallery of Canada, met in New York City with Professors Andersson, Spitz, and Talbot. Intensive discussions were held concerning the humanistic content of the exhibition, and a final selection of prints, drawings, and books was made for the exhibition. Kathleen Erwin, former work-study student from Wayne State University, joined the staff as special Research Assistant for the transfer of our collection to our new quarters. Ms. Erwin worked out the arrangement of our new Solan- der box storage area, but, because of construction delays, the actual move of the collection could not take place. Ms. Erwin assisted with a variety of departmental tasks, including the creation of a complete photographic file of our European drawings with lists by century, artist, and accession number. Her work was essential to the organization of our projected catalogue of European drawings and watercolors in the permanent collection, which is being prepared by a group of scholars, including Victor Carlson, Ann Sutherland Harris, George Knox, Anne Marie Logan, Graham Smith, and Horst Uhr. Douglas Bulka, our Technical Assistant, supervised the photography of some 300 of our drawings, which were then transferred to the Conservation Services Laboratory where Paper Con- servator Nancy Donaldson photographed the watermarks and prepared con- dition reports. Ms. Donaldson is working on a technical appendix for the drawing catalogue. Mr. Bulka, in addition to carrying out a continuing program of matting both new and old acquisitions on all-rag board, prepared works of art for loan and exhibition. Yvette Coneal capably and graciously performed her duties as Typist and Receptionist. Although formally closed .because of construc- tion and our impending move, the department made a special effort to assist visiting scholars who wished to view the collection. We are grateful to Jean Shilson Wyatt, who regularly volunteers her services to keep our file of cata- logues and brochures in good order, and to Bill Rauhauser for serving as Con- sultant on Photography. The department supervised the program of the Drawing and Print Club (see report on p. 233) and was actively involved in the Club's very successful fund-raising activity, a lecture by the celebrated American photographer Ansel Adams.

The department placed major emphasis this year on broadening the variety of historical periods and media presented in the galleries. Painting and sculpture created by American artists born after 1875, formerly the responsibility of the Department of American Art, were placed under the jurisdiction of this depart- ment in the summer of 1978. In December 1979, the department reinstalled the four early 20th-century galleries, juxtaposing European and American works of concurrent periods. Also included in this installation are decorative arts, an area of the collection not on permanent view for many years: works in silver from the Viennese decorative arts workshops immediately after the turn of the cen- tury and ceramics and textiles from Cranbrook during the '30s have been installed near paintings and sculptures from the same eras to show the rela- tionships among various media. In addition we began again to purchase modern decorative arts, such as the two side chairs (see fig. 20) by the noted Viennese designer Josef Hoffman and theater seats designed at the Bauhaus by Marcel Breuer. The new installation also features an exceptional gift - six paintings by Josef Albers from the Homage to the Square series (fig. 21) - donated to the Insti- tute through the generosity of the Josef Albers Foundation, Inc., and Anni Albers, as well as a weaving by Mrs. Albers, Pictographic (fig. 30). The department continued its involvement in contemporary art in a variety of ways. In his first exhibition since coming to Detroit, the curator organized, with the assistance of Davira Taragin, a select survey of a recent development in American art, the growing interest in recognizable subject matter. "Image and Object in Contemporary Sculpture" brought together works, some of which were commissioned especially for the show, by Terry Allen, Scott Burton, Mich- ele Oka Doner, Michael Luchs, Dennis Oppenheim, and Jim Roche. Following its presentation at the Institute, the show was exhibited in December and Jan- uary at the Institute of Art and Urban Resources, Inc., in New York City. The department's support of contemporary art in Michigan changed in several ways. The Works in Progress series, which was begun in 1976 to focus on recent work by artists from Michigan, ended this year with its sixth show: a double exhibition, organized by Associate Curator Mary Jane Jacob, surveying the work of Nancy Pletos and the recent sculpture of Keith Aoki. Beginning in the fiscal year 1980/81, the department will mount a series of smaller exhibitions featuring work by contemporary artists from Europe and throughout this country, as well as from Michigan. Artists living throughout the state had the opportunity during the past year to submit works to three of the four regional juried exhibitions in "Michigan Artists 80/81," the 61st Michigan artists show, which is being organized by the Detroit Institute of Arts in cooperation with ten other arts organizations around the state. Nancy Gordon, Exhibition Coordinator, and Pat Pancioli, Assistant Exhibition Coordinator, have been in charge of the project, overseeing the first phase of the two-part jurying process for three of the regional exhibitions, as well as assembling the Michigan Artists Registry, an ongoing list of over 10,000 artists living throughout the state. The southwest regional exhibition, the first of the series, will open in July 1980. In addition to the Art Institute, the Cran- brook Academy of Art Museum, the Flint Institute of Arts, the Grand Rapids Art Museum, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, the Lee Hall Gallery of Northern Michigan University, the Midland Art Council of the Midland Center for the Arts, the Saginaw Art Museum, the University Art Gallery of Central Michigan University, and the University of Michigan Museum of Art are participating in what has become the largest statewide juried exhibition ever held. The show is 202</page><page sequence="24">Figure 20. Josef Hoffman, Austrian, 1870-1956, Side Chair, c. 1900; stained mahogany, h. 74.5 cm (29V2 in.). Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Ford II Fund (79.180.1). designed to include a wide variety of media - photography, experimental film, conceptual and environmental art, video, and performance art, as well as paint- ing, sculpture, graphics, and crafts. Following the regional exhibitions in the central, southwest, southeast, and upper peninsula areas of the state, an all- state exhibition will be held at the Detroit Institute of Arts in the fall of 1981. This show will present the work of selected artists chosen by the jurors from the regional exhibitions. The department devoted much of its energy to the planning of a major exhi- bition, "Kick Out the Jams: Detroit's Cass Corridor 1963-1977." This show, focus- ing on the development of avant-garde art in an urban loft area of Detroit in the late 1960s and early '70s, is being developed by Mary Jane Jacob, Jay Belloli, and Dennis Nawrocki, Instructor, Department of Education, and will open in July 1980. This year the department acquired a number of major works of art. Accession II (fig. 22) by American sculptor Eva Hesse, purchased with the assistance of the Friends of Modern Art, is an important addition to the collection's repre- sentation of 1960s post-minimal sculpture. With the assistance of a Museum Matching Purchase Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Friends of Modern Art undertook significant additions to the Art Institute's collection of art from the 1970s, a period not yet strongly represented. Dennis Oppenheim's photographic documentation of his earthwork, Gallery Transplant , Ithaca , New York , and Scott Burton's set of four minimal sculptures/furniture pieces (fig. 38), each entitled Bench/Table (the latter purchased with additional assistance from the Leon and Rena Frank Memorial Corporation), were acquired. The department also concentrated on acquiring art by painters and sculptors living in Michigan: important pieces by Keith Aoki, Michiele Oka Doner, Michael Hall, and Nancy Pletos (fig. 26) were added to the collection. Mr. and Mrs. S. Brooks Barron, Mrs. Lillian Shaye-Hirsch and Mr. Bernard Hirsch, and Mr. and Mrs. Robert Zell were very generous in supporting oui; acquisitions in this par- ticular area. 203</page><page sequence="25">Through the generosity of Lydia Winston Malbin, the collection of post-war European art was significantly augmented by a major early painting by Karel Appel, Head and Fish (fig. 6). A work by American Abstract Expressionist Jon Schueler (gift of Ms. Rosemary Franck); a Mondrian-inspired painting by Leon Polk Smith (gift of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters); New Realist paintings by Jon Carsman (gift of Dr. and Mrs. Ralph Coskey in memory of Leo Coskey) and Lynton Wells (gift of Dr. and Mrs. Harry Y. Hoff- man) were also added to the collection. The department's collection of 20th-century textiles, begun last year with the kind assistance of Madalyn and Stanley Rosen, grew larger with the purchase of the Anni Albers work mentioned earlier and a major recent work by Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz. An earlier work by Abakanowicz (fig. 41a) was the generous gift of Jack Lenor Larsen. The staff assisted the Friends of Modern Art and a number of organizations outside the Institute during the year, extending its services as much as possible into the community. Research Associate Davira Taragin assumed increasing responsibilities in the department and has provided invaluable assistance in a variety of ways. Joyce McCrary became Department Secretary and ably assisted in many aspects of the department's activities. Beth Barban, Ann Dumas, and Debbie Fenton assisted for part of the year as interns from the University of Michigan Museum Practice Program. Carol Shannon continued her fine main- tenance of the department's records. In June, Mary Jane Jacob resigned to become Curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. Ms. Jacob has been an active force in the community as well as in the department, and we wish her every success. In conclusion, the department would like to thank the many persons who have greatly assisted us. We extend our warm appreciation to W. Hawkins Ferry for his continued and exceptional generosity and concern; as well as to Lydia Winston Malbin, Honorary Curator of Modern Art, for her generosity and encouragement; and to Mrs. Gilbert Silverman for her valued advice and support.

This is an estimated increase of nearly 75,000 over 1978/79. The Detroit Youtheatre's Something Every Saturday performances in the auditorium played to substantially larger audiences than those of the previous year. The Youtheatre director and staff selected programs for the 34-week series - October through May - from showcases in Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York, and Atlanta. Youtheatre's contribution to the museum's Show-on- the-Road touring program involved 306 professional performing arts presenta- tions in 247 communities, for a combined statewide audience of 159,145. Where need existed, funding for the program was provided by the Michigan State Legislature. A month-long residency by Chicago's Melikin Puppet Theater enabled Youtheater to offer a series of summer puppet shows in the Recital Hall. Nine fully staged musicals, revues, puppet shows, and plays constituted Youtheatre's Field Trip to Broadway series, offered to student audiences in the auditorium during school hours. Wheels for Art and Science, a privately funded project of the Detroit Public Schools, provided much-needed transportation, facilitating greater participation by inner-city schools, and helped swell Youtheatre's total attendance to 240,502 for the year. In related activities, the Youtheatre was instrumental, with assistance from the American Theatre Association, in establishing the first national showcase of professional performing arts for young audiences and has bid to host the showcase in 1984. The Youtheatre director accepted an appointment to the Sub- Committee on Programs for Children and Youth of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. In June, Fash/Bash '80, the annual Youtheatre benefit sponsored by the museum's Junior Council, welcomed stand- ing-room-only crowds at the Renaissance Center's Plaza Hotel. With the support of the J. L. Hudson Company, the event was highly successful and resulted in supplemental funding for Youtheatre, which is greatly appreciated. The Detroit Film Theatre offered over 120 first-run, classic, and seldom-seen films to an audience in excess of 100,000. The weekend series in the auditorium was frequently filled to capacity. In the course of the year, Film Theatre audi- ences were also invited to special preview screenings both at the museum and at area commercial theaters. Selections for the series were made by the Film Theatre coordinator, who attended film festivals in New York, Washington, D.C., and Denver, Colorado, and previewed over 370 films. A highlight of the season was the midwest premiere of the Academy Award-winning documen- tary "Best Boy." Sold-out for four showings, the film drew the largest audience to date for a Film Theatre presentation. In addition to the regular showings, several foreign language films were offered to student audiences during school time, and a summer series of classic cinema, Film Panorama, was presented. The latter series documented the devel- opment of animation in the United States and Europe, from its early traditions to contemporary examples. At the close of the Film Theatre's 13th successful season, plans were well underway for the installation of two new projectors which will greatly increase the quality of presentation. The department's expanded music schedule included four concert/lectures by distinguished music authority Karl Haas and performances by the prestigious Ars Musica, the internationally-celebrated harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt, and the acclaimed Detroit-born pianist Ruth Laredo. The Ensemble for 'Early Music again undertook a DIA-based residency with three concerts in the Recital Hall. The department also presented Baroque Bistro, three evenings re-creating the intimate atmosphere of the period coffee houses in which various compos- ers' works were first elevated to popularity. 206</page><page sequence="28">Figure 23.

Brunch With Bach, the popular informal Sunday morning chamber concerts by professional area artists, continued to draw capacity crowds in its year-round season. Due to construction in Kresge Court, the concerts were given in the newly redecorated Crystal Gallery. Weekly broadcasts of the taped concerts continued on public radio station WDET-FM, hosted by the Brunch With Bach coordinator. Special performances this year included Bach's Birthday Party, a Bluegrass Opera, and the Little McKinney Cotton Pickers. Jazz at the Institute presented a series of concerts in a salute to jazz greats of the past, hosted A. Spencer Barefield and the Creative Arts Collective in several avant-garde concerts, and continued to showcase outstanding national and area artists. Jazz at the Institute concerts were recorded and broadcast throughout the season on five public radio stations throughout Michigan. Sunday Afternoon at the Art Institute, a new series this year, soon became a regular part of the music schedule. Set in the velvet-draped Crystal Gallery, this weekly activity combines entertainment by noted area pianists with a lei- surely cafe atmosphere offering a variety of exotic coffees and cocktails, imported teas, French pastries, and other delectables. An additional special program early in the year was a nostalgic musical salute, "An Evening with Rodgers and Hart." 207</page><page sequence="29">The Wassail Feast, our annual winter holiday celebration in the style of Eliz- abeth I, was expanded to six evenings for the general public, with an additional evening privately purchased for the advertisers, staff, and contributors to Time- Life Corporation's People Magazine. More than 2,500 guests enjoyed the spec- tacular performances and lavish menu. By the week's end, the next year was fully subscribed and over 4,000 advance reservations placed through 1986. The transition of the World Adventure Series to a Performing Arts activity was completed following the death of world traveler and international guest speaker George Pierrot, who initiated the series over four decades ago. Former radio personality and travel film commentator Kenard Lawrence joined the staff to continue this traditional Sunday afternoon program. As part of the expansion of the series, Mr. Lawrence accompanied the curator on a filming expedition in Tunisia. The resulting travelogue will be featured in an upcoming World Adven- ture season. A new facet of the series, wine and cheese socials following the performances for season subscribers, helped to increase season ticket sales. Other activities included four performances of "Vincent," a drama based on the life of Vincent Van Gogh, starring actor, poet, and television celebrity Leon- ard Nimoy; uniquely staged performances by Poland's famed Marcinek Puppet Theatre; and the midwest premiere of the feature-length opera film, "Don Giov- anni," sponsored in conjunction with Detroit's Alliance Frangaise. In addition, Arts Odyssey, Noel Night, and the Winkelman-sponsored Fall Open House were coordinated by the department in conjunction with other Cultural Center organizations. Over 5,000 guests enjoyed these three evenings. Midway through the year the department moved into temporary offices on the ground floor of the Main Building near the Lecture Hall pending the com- pletion of the new Performing Arts Department, which will be located on the lower level of the Auditorium.
