<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A history of animated nature must itself be animated," Thoreau recorded in his Journal s 1850, implying that such histories must animate the imagination of their readers if they are to make any impression on them. Yet, scholars claim that Thoreau ultimately grew disenchanted with figurative modes of representing nature and became more concerned with describing it with painstaking accuracy. I contend otherwise. This essay examines "Autumnal Tints," written toward the end of his life, as Thoreau's version of the kind of animated history that could inspire his readers to join him in his lifelong quest "to find God in nature." "To find God in nature": Thoreau's Poetics of Natural History STEPHEN SPRATT My profession is to be always on the alert to find God in nature , to know his lurking-places , to attend all the oratorios, the operas , in nature. - Henry David Thoreau, 1851 I am not interested in mere phenomena, though it were the explosion of a planet, only as it may have lain in the experience of a human being. - Henry David Thoreau, 1854 In wrote stated the winter in barely his Journal of is dry. I860, that It Thoreau must "A fact be wrote in his Journal that "A fact stated barely is dry. It must be the vehicle of some humanity in order to interest us" ( 160). Later that year he would sim- ilarly note that "all nature is to be regarded as it concerns man" ( 1 17); in other words, our understanding and experiences of nature derive from how we think, feel, imagine, speak, write, and otherwise act in relation to it. And yet, in the context of ecocriticism s current dialectic tension between anthropocentric and ecocentric representations of nature, the argument prevails that Thoreau had ultimately grown disenchanted with figurative lan- guage and more concerned with describing nature with painstaking accuracy. In her recent book Passions for Nature , Rochelle Johnson argues that Thoreau sought a "counteraesthetics, which assumed that the value of nature resided in its Mosaic 45/1 0027-1276-07/155016$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">156 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) physicality, rather than in metaphors for human experience" (3). Johnson claims he ultimately strove for "a prose that conveys experience as accurately - and as literally - as possible, without the intrusion of metaphor," and thus the erroneous and baleful consequences of abstract language (208). Accordingly, Thoreau had adopted a more literal style of describing the natural phenomena of his native land (187). Referring to Thoreau s Kalendar project, Johnson posits that the author dispensed with figuration entirely and opted instead for a style that would merely "record [. . .] the phenomena of his world" (191). Prompted by what ecocritics have identified as the "crisis of rep- resentation" in literary studies that continues to spark ecocritical debate, Jonathan Bate posits that ecopoetics - an ecocentric poetics of nature - may restore our inter- connectedness with the natural world at a time when many in ecocriticism argue that "language and imagination have come to be defined as realms that are split off from nature because they only function by means of representation" (247). Using language that is "experiential, not descriptive" (250-51), Bate's ecopoet can create "works of art [that] can themselves be imaginary states of nature, imaginary ideal ecosystems, and by reading them, by inhabiting them, we can start to imagine what it might be like to live differently upon the earth" (266). Moreover, in his article "Fabricating Ecocentric Discourse in the American Poem (and Elsewhere)," Robert Kern identifies ecocen- trism as "perhaps the central concept in this field [of ecocriticism]" and associates the term with Ralph Waldo Emerson's idea of "self abandonment to the truth," a process that "makes words things" (425). Kern contests the possibility of the "ecopoet" speak- ing nature via a language of transparency because language mediates how we interpret and represent the physical world (432). More realistically, suggests Kern, we might view ecocentrism as a level of awareness foregrounding non-human nature within our field of experience that may countervail our anthropocentric tendencies (443). Moreover, the scholarship of David Robinson (111) and Laura Dassow Walls ( Passage 164) points to the fact that, despite the painstakingly detailed descriptions of natural phenomena more characteristic of his later writing, Thoreau never lost sight of the power of poetic language generally, and metaphor specifically, to reveal nature's spiritual truths and its materiality. Moreover, in his recent article "Mind in the Forest," Scott Russell Sanders meditates upon ecological and spiritual implications posed by the anthropocentric nature of metaphoric thinking and writing about the natural world, but he concludes that, despite these limitations, we (and the natural world) have more to lose if we abandon figurative language altogether: "if we withhold our metaphors and stories, we estrange ourselves from the universe. We become mere onlookers, the sole meaning-bearing witnesses of a meaningless show" (52-53). Bate's idea of the poet's "experiential" language and Sanders's belief that we currently risk</page><page sequence="3">Stephen Spratt 157 losing a collective affiliation with the natural world if we completely reject figurative language in nature writing raise questions as to how language can render nature meaningful. Indeed, the ecopoet may not have the capacity to "speak nature" by way of using a transparent language and therefore avoid crafting ideas instead of things upon the page. Yet, he or she may nonetheless use language in ways that resonate most palpably with our emotions, senses, and intellect - and thus, our values. The ecocentric idea of valuing "nature for nature's sake" implies on one hand that nature does not exist solely for humanity's purposes, a principle that Thoreau likely shared. But on the other hand, this idea presumes that we must imaginatively diminish the human in relation to non-human nature in order to see nature more purely, accurately, and virtuously. And yet, might we risk putting ourselves out of rela- tion with nature if we see language as a barrier to our perceiving nature accurately (whatever that entails)? In this essay, I examine how Thoreau's use of poetic language in "Autumnal Tints" derives from and facilitates his lifelong quest "to find God" in the material world of nature. I argue that Thoreau's essay figures as a tour de force per- formance of poetic prose. "How differently the poet and the naturalist look at objects!" Thoreau exclaims toward the end of "Autumnal Tints" (394). Thoreau indeed wrote as a naturalist, but he chafed against the increasingly and merely descriptive, factual style in which he claimed the natural histories of his day were written: "of much more importance to me than a knowledge of the names and distinctions of color is the joy and exhilara- tion these colored leaves excite," remarks Thoreau (384-85). Passages from his Journal and other publications reiterate his belief that knowledge alone does not shape our values; we come to care about nature by writing and speaking of it in words that appeal to our emotions and our senses. "A history of animated nature must itself be animated," he recorded in his Journal in 1850, as if to emphasize that such histories must animate the imagination of their readers if they are to make any impression on them (154). Thus, Thoreau writes "Autumnal Tints" as an animated history indeed, one in which poetic language might bridge the gap between our sense-perceptions of nature and nature itself. Michael West points out that Thoreau "wanted a prose so alive to the earthly meanings in which words were rooted" so that his readers might "sense the physical analogies" between words and things (206). Of this Emersonian quest for "the single reality beyond language," Walls states that abstract ideas such as "Truth" have a mate- rial basis: "To say that truth is 'cultured' or grown responds to the root meaning of the word in Old English 'tree' [. . .] Truth is an arboreal construction well rooted in the material world" and, therefore, is essentially figurative, an idea and afigure ( Emerson's</page><page sequence="4">158 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) 22). Likewise, Thoreau sees the human mind - the imagination itself - as biologically part and parcel of the body and the organic world at large. We are naturally given to understand the world neither on the basis of matter or meaning alone but by the rela- tional dynamics between the two. The famous passage in Waiden of the spring thaw- ing of the sand bank poetically exemplifies nature "speaking" words through natural forms. Here, Thoreau interprets the land using the language of human images he envisions in the traces drawn by the thawing ice of such figures as "the ball of a human finger" (333), hands, lips, feet, cheeks, and brows. He writes: "The earth is not a mere fragment of dead history [. . .] but living poetry like the leaves of a tree, which pre- cede flowers and fruit, - not a fossil earth, but a living earth" (334). Nature, too, records its own histories, and all but the anthropologist and the poet fail to recognize that what we call "natural history" is part and parcel of the histories of civilizations. Natural histories describe the natural world yet may fail to appeal to the imagi- nation wherein our emotions, values, and beliefs are forged. Early in "Autumnal Tints," Thoreau establishes the superiority of figurative to factual representations of fall colour: "the physiologist says it is 'due to an increased absorption of oxygen.' That is the scientific account of the matter, - only a reassertion of the fact. But I am more interested in the rosy cheek than I am to know what particular diet the maiden fed on" (368). As his later writing emphasizes, Thoreau indeed took interest in scientific accounts of natural processes, and he increasingly recorded them in his writing. But a quest for knowledge alone did not inspire him to spend countless days walking and paddling in and around Concord observing the grandest and most minute opera- tions of nature. Thoreau fills the pages of "Autumnal Tints" with imagery, metaphor, simile, hyperbole, assonance, and consonance - the language of poetry - to render the material world meaningfully. For Thoreau, as Nina Baym claims, nature study served most significantly as a "quest for personal salvation" (225); I propose that nature writing presented for Thoreau just such a quest, a quest he invites his readers to embark upon, too. As development, the metaphysics professionalization, of Natural Theology and had specialization been giving way of the for natural some time sciences, to the development, professionalization, and specialization of the natural sciences, Thoreau accordingly absorbed and incorporated into his worldview the latest think- ing of men like Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin, who stood at the fore- front of scientific thought. Thoreau the "poet-naturalist" (as William Ellery Channing would later call him) had spent much of his life cultivating a capacity to perceive nature imaginatively and yet directly, unmediated by convention. He understood what I suggest our current environmentalism overlooks: that merely descriptive</page><page sequence="5">Stephen Spratt 1 59 accounts of natural processes and rational appeals for an environmental ethic fall short in engaging people to change the way they think, feel, and act. Thoreau recorded in his Journal in 1851, "Of what use are words which do not move the hearer - are not oracular and fateful? A style in which the matter is all in all, and the manner nothing at all?" (86). The artistry of Thoreau's poetic style engages readers to perceive mean- ing in nature through the physical senses. Truth and beauty (or truth embodied) radi- ate outward as the material manifestation of God in nature. "The perception of beauty is a moral test," Thoreau would record in his Journal the following year (126), and readers of "Autumnal Tints" submit to this test at the turn of each page. Metaphors for spiritual growth abound in "Autumnal Tints"; the theme of maturing or "ripening" of the soul serves as a central metaphor which the inattentive reader might too hastily interpret as merely a natural history of Concord's trees (Robinson 36; 187-90). Thoreau begins the essay by proclaiming that the nation's literature - and specifically its poetry - has failed to inscribe "the autumnal change of our woods" into the collective imagination (367). Piquant depictions of colour and light given off by the interplay of leaves and sky infuse the author's poetic prose, wherein leaves embody "emblem [s]" of the "ripe" beauty of spiritual maturation by virtue of their brilliance, which is symbolic of the divine light of truth (371 ). The scar- let oak leaves "dance arm in arm with the light"; the purple grasses of the Poke emit "a brilliant lake-red, with crimson flame-like reflections, equal to anything of the kind, - all on fire with ripeness [. . .] This plant speaks to our blood" (370). Further- more, he writes: "What a perfect maturity it arrives at! It is the emblem of a success- ful life concluded by a death not premature, which is no ornament to Nature. What if we were to mature as perfectly, root and branch, glowing in the midst of our decay, like the Poke!" (371). The fallen leaves "teach us how to die," and Thoreau anticipates an age "when men, with their boasted faith in immortality, will lie down as gracefully and as ripe," knowing the "joy and exhilaration" of honing their capacity to see beauty in nature (382). "Autumnal Tints" presents other metaphors, those more economic, political, and cultural. Given the rural economy of the Concord region in Thoreau's time, metaphors for and imagery of agriculture figure prominently. Harvesting not the lit- eral grasses he presents but rather their beauty, Thoreau proclaims, "With thoughts cutting a broad swathe I 'get' them, with horse-raking thoughts I gather them into windrows. The fine-eared poet may hear the whetting of my scythe" (372). Thoreau portrays the process of developing one's sensory-perceptual acuity and imaginative capacity as acts of "the husbandman" (381) "ripening" (367), "husking" ("I am tempted to go thither as to a husking of thoughts, now dry and ripe, and ready to be</page><page sequence="6">160 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) separated from their integuments" [377]), "cultivating" (388), and "gardening]" (392) the "harvest" (368, 381, 383), as shown in the following excerpts: Our appetites have commonly confined our views of ripeness and its phenomena, color, mellowness, and perfectness, to the fruits we eat, and we are wont to forget that an immense harvest which we do not eat, hardly use at all, is annually ripened by Nature. (368, emph. mine) As I look down our street, which is lined with [elms], they remind me both by their form and color of yellowing sheaves of grain, as if the harvest had indeed come to the village itself [. . .] The street is the scene of a great harvest-home. (377, emph. mine) As the "vast crop" and "great harvest of the year," the autumn leaves literally (ecolog- ically) and figuratively (imaginatively) sustain our lives; "we are all the richer for their decay [which] prepares the virgin mould for future cornfields and forests, on which the earth fattens. It keeps our homestead in good heart" (381). As "fruits which address our taste for beauty alone," these leaves - beheld by the perceptive and imag- inative observer - have the power to elevate one's thoughts and tastes away from the merely material and toward the spiritual, to bring one into fruition (368). Thoreau poetically converts such agricultural products as tea and wine into the colour of leaves we might "drink" as "wholesome herb-drinks" of nature "whose vintage is not con- fined to the vine"; for the berries of the common Poke- Weed provide us with ample fruit to "play the bacchanal with" (371). Using political and cultural metaphors, Thoreau proclaims that autumn leaves might serve as "flags of all [. . .] nations" and that the sugar- maples are "preachers" whose "sermons" are "constantly increasing unction and influence, ministering to many generations of men" (386-87). Leaves as "flags" poetically merge nature with nation, natural histories with human histories. Sugar-maples instead of churches minister health to an ailing nation that has purportedly turned away from nature, poetry, beauty, and truth. The beauty of the purple grasses incites him to proclaim, "wherever I go, I see hardly anything else. It is the reign and presidency of the Andropogons" (373). Thoreau s metaphoric integration of the Chestnut Beard-Grass, or Indian-Grass, into the region's political and cultural history illustrates his merging of the natural and the political: "These bright standards are now advanced on the dis- tant hill-sides, not in large armies, but in scattered troops or single file, like the red men. They stand thus fair and bright, representative of the race which they are named after, but for the most part unobserved as they. The expression of this grass haunted me for a week, after I passed and noticed it, like the glance of an eye. It stands like an</page><page sequence="7">Stephen Spratt 161 Indian chief taking a last look at his favorite hunting-grounds" (373). Here, the beard- grass, like the "red men," is indigenous to the region but goes largely "unobserved" and therefore faces extinction as it surveys its native habitat one last time. Without the glance of our eyes, Thoreau implies, the grass and the aesthetic delight it provides to those who see it will haunt future generations as a vestige of the more biodiverse land- scape of earlier eras; if we fail to see nature as part of our history - or, as part of the human story - then we risk caring for it. How can we care for nature - for grasses, for instance - if we do not observe them, this passage prompts us to ask. Despite its anthropomorphic perspective, "Autumnal Tints" does not suggest that humanity is superior to nature, nor does it portray a world in which nature exists chiefly for humanity. Yet, the essay does suggest that dispensing with the imaginative use of language would strip nature of its meaning and significance and, too, that our own anthropocentric claims of nature may serve to relate us - body and soul - more closely to it rather than estrange us from it. "Each humblest plant, or weed, as we call it, stands there to express some thought or mood of ours; and yet how long it stands in vain!" Thoreau writes as if to emphasize this point (372). Likely, he did not intend for us to take this literally - that indeed the plant world seeks affiliation with human- ity. But I suggest the passage illustrates Thoreau s belief that we rather than nature benefit from seeking affiliation with it; nature does not need us, but we need it, not only for our material but for our spiritual well-being. And yet, the passage quoted ear- lier indicating the eminent demise of the beard-grass presents a caveat to the argu- ment that nature does not need us. Here, Thoreau prompts us to consider that nature nonetheless depends upon the metaphors (and poetry) we create because these are what relate us to our natural surroundings on an emotional level and forge our actions. Conversely, Thoreaus environmental imagination leads him to conclude that metaphors worthy of our poetry and our planet derive from the natural objects and phenomena that guide us toward spiritual edification: as he writes, "Wherever I walk these afternoons, the Purple-Fingered Grass also stands like a guide-board, and points my thoughts to more poetic paths than they have lately travelled" (372). In Metaphors We Live By ; George Lakoff and Mark Johnson state that our think- ing, speaking, writing, and behaviour are grounded in metaphor "down to the most mundane details" of our daily lives (3). We cannot not conceive of the world metaphorically. The authors propose an alternative to the Cartesian separation of subject and object (or what they call the "myths" of objectivism and subjectivism) that calls for "an experientialist synthesis" that "unites reason and imagination" (113- 14). This dialectical tension between objectivism and subjectivism connects with the tension between ecocentrism and anthropocentrism I discussed earlier, and Thoreau</page><page sequence="8">162 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) resolves them both by synthesizing poetry and prose. Lakoff and Johnson conclude that "truth is relative to understanding," as our understanding derives from our expe- rience of a world of things , animate and inanimate (192-93). I think this relational mode of breaking down the subject/object dualism informs Thoreau's poetic way of seeing and writing and that it undergirds his belief in the power of figurative language to evoke sensory, perceptual, intellectual, and imaginative responses. Passions for Nature examines the limitations and dangers that metaphors for nature posed in antebellum America. The three reigning metaphors of this era that most powerfully inspired what Johnson calls "passions for nature" within the collec- tive imagination - metaphors of progress, refinement , and reason - led to erroneous, utilitarian, and destructive attitudes toward nature (185-86). Johnson points to the landscape paintings of Thomas Cole, Andrew Jackson Downing's landscape aesthetic, and the cosmic pre-eminence of the human intellect in Emersonian philosophy as manifestations of these three dominant national metaphors for nature. Indeed, metaphors can be misleading and therefore dangerous. Those that represent nature merely as an economic, aesthetic, and/or spiritual resource fallaciously separate humans from nature. Of antebellum America, Johnson writes, "Metaphor had become so pervasive in cultural discourse that few people realized that it obscured and limited their vision. Metaphor [. . .] had become a limiting habit of thought - a way of perceiving the world that seemed as natural as nature itself but that prevented thorough understanding" (184). Though some metaphors (i.e., those that represent progress, refinement, reason) pose such limits, metaphor itself need not do so. Discounting figurative modes of representation diminishes the uniquely human acts of meaning-making and, thus, of story-telling, that render the world intelligible and significant. An accurate understanding of ecological processes certainly enables us to live as better stewards of nature, but our innate desire to find meaning in nature draws upon more: it entails imaginative and aesthetic ways of using language that defy mere description and rational understanding. Thoreau relies upon the sensory quality of poetic writing and speech (Thoreau did, after all, deliver "Autumnal Tints" as a lec- ture) rather than upon the language of science because it appeals to our rational, emotional, and bodily selves. Thinking is fundamentally tied to our senses in relation to our physical surroundings: thus, Thoreau wrote in his Journal in 1853 that a wise person "will confine the observations of his mind as closely as possible to the experi- ence or life of his senses. His thought must live with and be inspired with the life of the body" (16-17). Another journal entry from December 1859 recapitulates this idea: "A man thinks as well as through his legs and arms as his brain. We exaggerate the importance and exclusiveness of the headquarters. Do you suppose they were a race</page><page sequence="9">Stephen Spratt 163 of consumptives and dyspeptics who invented Grecian mythology and poetry? The poet's words are, 'You would almost say the body thought!' I quite say it. I trust we have a good body then" (69-70). In his book The Soul in the Brain: The Cerebral Basis of Language, Art , and Belief, neurologist Michael Trimble discusses the neurophysiological basis of our responses to such elements as prosody and metaphor in poetry. As "the language of emotion," poetry elicits emotional, passionate responses in ways that the rational "language of description" does not (93). As opposed to what Trimble calls "propositional knowl- edge" that derives from "the language of science and philosophy," "experiential knowl- edge," on the other hand, resonates at the level of emotion and phenomena (204). Moreover, Trimble asserts that cerebrally "we deal in phenomena (things as they appear), not noumena (things in themselves)" (204-05). From this perspective, it is in figurative language - the language of figures, forms, of things - that we make sense of the world. Any attempt to represent nature accurately, literally, or "as it really is" - stripped of the meaning and significance we project on it - appears to be the real abstraction. Thoreau's understanding of the interrelatedness of environment, the body, language, and perception reveals an understanding of the ideas Trimble proposes. We see this understanding play out in Thoreau's much earlier natural history essay "A Natural History of Massachusetts," in which words such as "health," "tonic," "whole- some," "restorative," "refreshed," and "joy" countermand the dry, matter-of-fact cata- loguing and description of flora and fauna characteristic of too many of the natural histories of his own time. "These volumes deal much in measurements and minute descriptions, not interesting to the general reader, with only here and there a colored sentence to allure him, like those plants growing in dark forests, which bear only leaves without blossoms," Thoreau proclaims (40-41). Natural histories must "allure" readers into imagining their filial connection with the flora and fauna of the local environments and are as much a part of their history as any monument and institution might signify (41). To "[grow] in a dark forest," Thoreau suggests, is to languish in obscurity; to bear no blossoms is to produce no fruit, the fruits of curiosity, enchantment, and the "joy and exhilaration" of experiencing nature with a poet's sensibility ("Autumnal" 384). For between Thoreau, subject our and apprehension object, humans of truth and derives nature. from From an the organic, timeless material and universal relation between subject and object, humans and nature. From the timeless and universal to the temporal and specific, Thoreau's writing participates in the culturally contingent act of translating meaning through and in the particular, localized landscape of New England. His belief in truth as both immanent in and transcendent of nature precludes neither the idea that we merely create truth (from nothing) nor that we merely discover</page><page sequence="10">164 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012) it. Rather, I suggest, he believed that we create our means - through language and art - of getting at truth, so to speak. This process is part of the truth and beauty we seek to behold. We derive joy from sensing and perceiving beauty - in the light, colours, and forms of the changing leaves that inspire our imaginations and instruct us how to live most fully - to the extent that we may sense (see and feel) and then per- ceive spiritual realities. In her writing on von Humboldt, Walls describes the sheer delight this nineteenth-century scientist experienced and wrote about in his pursuit of an understanding of the mysteries of the cosmos. His desire to understand the rela- tionship between knowledge and a desire to know inspired his search for knowledge and truth: "Wonder and the pleasure of discovery feed the desire to know, and knowl- edge leads back to wonder, in an ascending spiral fed by imagination at every turn that ever enlarges and will never end" ( Passage 224). Like Humboldt, whom he read avidly, Thoreau understood the synergy between the language of poetry and the language of science; without appealing to the imagination, without poetic language - the lan- guage of the gods - nature writing fails to pique our desire to seek meaning (which for Thoreau is inherently grounded in essential Truth) in our relation to nature. In A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Thoreau claims that the poet "conveys [even] the least information [. . .] with such magnificence and vast expanse of natural imagery, as if it were a message from the gods" (74). Our expectations of a text determine how we read it and, more specifically, how closely we attend to how a text speaks to us. In his introduction to Cosmos , Humboldt writes, "Nature is a free domain, and the profound conceptions and enjoyments she awakens within us can only be vividly delineated by thought clothed in exalted forms of speech, worthy of bearing witness to the majesty and greatness of the creation" (1). Thoreau applies this Humboldtian philosophy to transforming what he thought had become the dry-as- dust genre of natural history into a poetic art form. "In the characteristic Humboldtian project," Walls writes, "The goal is not an object but a relationship, and the teller is part of the tale" ( Passage 266). I believe that Thoreaus writing conveys this sensibility and I suggest he would have his readers be part of the tale, too, by engag- ing them to imagine social histories and natural histories invariably enmeshed. I want to emphasize that, rather than setting aside poetry and settling for prose in his later years, as some have suggested, Thoreau hones and refines his poetic craft and eventually masters the art of writing prose poetically. Tracing the trajectory from his earlier essay "A Natural History of Massachusetts" to "Autumnal Tints," published twenty years later, we see the development of his craft. In "A Natural History of Massachusetts," the verse passages take on a stylized, formulaic mode that draws more attention to the poet s efforts to sound poetic and lacks the spontaneity and freshness</page><page sequence="11">Stephen Spratt 165 of his prose. Thoreaus adherence to King James English ("thee," "thy," "thou," "swelleth," etc.) and to conventionally British poetic diction ("rill," "zephyr," "lofty," "azure," "fair," "verdure," "mead," and "o'er)" fail to convey the sensory impressions of the natural world, which his later prose more readily recreates. Likewise, the frequent references to European landscapes and places prevalent in the verse do not occur in his prose treating specifically the natural world of Massachusetts. We see this contrast at the opening of this earlier essay, as the prose abruptly shifts to verse and back to prose. The two introductory paragraphs poetically reflect Thoreaus biogeographic sensibil- ity. He identifies particular places and species of flora and fauna as if to invite the reader to join along in this imaginary excursion, made palpable by the author s imag- inative style: "Books of natural history make the most cheerful winter reading. I read in Audubon with a thrill of delight, when the snow covers the ground, of the magno- lia, and the Florida keys, and their warm sea breezes; of the fence-rail, and the cotton- tree, and the migrations of the rice-bird; of the breaking up of winter in Labrador, and the melting of the snow on the forks of the Missouri; and owe an accession of health to these reminiscences of luxuriant nature" ("Natural" 20). In another prose passage that follows, Thoreau continues: "I am singularly refreshed in winter when I hear of service berries, poke-weed, juniper. Is not heaven made up of these cheap summer glo- ries? [. . .] What journal do the persimmon and the buckeye keep, and the sharp- shinned hawk? What is transpiring from summer to winter in the Carolinas, and the Great Pine Forest, and the Valley of the Mohawk?" (21). Here, Thoreau merges the lit- eral specificity of the ostensibly objective "Reports" - the standard language of the contemporary natural history genre - with the metaphoric, imagistic, hyperbolic, and exalted tone of poetry. The repetition of rhetorical questions goads us into rethinking how we tell histories; that is, these questions prompt us to consider that histories are as much fabrications as they are accounts, and these questions challenge the primacy of the political and cultural over the natural that prevails in conventional histories. However, Thoreau undermines the boundary-blurring between prose and poetry that occurs in these "prose" passages by periodically lapsing into verse, as if the poetry of his prose were not poetic enough to produce the effects he seeks to achieve: Within the circuit of this plodding life There enter moments of an azure hue, Untarnished fair as is the violet Or anemone, when the spring strews them By some meandering rivulet, [. . .] I have remembered when in the winter came,</page><page sequence="12">166 Mosaic 45/1 (March 2012 ) High in my chamber in the frosty nights [. . .] The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew; Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind, The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill, (20-21) Lacking the particularity of place we find in his prose and in a style borrowing gen- erously from British convention, the places Thoreau evokes in verse serve more as ornamental props. This aesthetic obscures the world of sensory experience we find so piquant in "Autumnal Tints," in which Thoreau portrays the flora of Concord's land- scape so palpably. In "A Natural History of Massachusetts," the "rivulet" has no name, the Johnswort is native to England, the "mead," "verdure," and "rill" resound as hack- neyed tropes suggesting English - not North American - landscape features and lack the effect of sensory-perceptual acuity felt in the prose. This pattern repeats itself throughout the essay. The prose poetically outperforms the verse, as illustrated once again in the following prose excerpt: "Surely joy is the condition of life. Think of the fry that leap in ponds, the myriads of insects ushered into being on a summer evening , the incessant note of the hyla with which the woods ring in the spring , the noncha- lance of the butterfly carrying accident and change painted in a thousand hues upon its wings , or the brook minnow stoutly stemming the current, the lustre of whose scales worn bright by the attrition is reflected upon the tank" (22-23, emph. mine). If read aloud, the sound and rhythm of the prose engender the vitality, the sounds, and movements of the authors surroundings. Moreover, without the Anglicized tropes and diction of the verse, the passage brings to life the ecology of a particularly New England landscape. In contrast, "Autumnal Tints" features only two stanzas of verse. Gone are the fre- quent allusions to ancient Greece and the reliance on the British poetic style that dis- cordantly fill the pages of "A Natural History of Massachusetts." "Autumnal Tints" is rife with sustained metaphors such as "fruit," "light," and "flag," which invite the imag- ination to material nature, perception to sensation. Early in "Autumnal Tints," Thoreau establishes the primacy of the figurative over the literal, though he grounds metaphor squarely in things we can see, touch, taste, and smell: "Generally, every fruit, on ripening, and just before it falls, when it commences a more independent and indi- vidual existence, requiring less nourishment from any source through its stem as from the sun and air, acquires a bright tint. So do leaves. The physiologist says it is 'due to an increased absorption of oxygen.' That is the scientific account of the matter, only a reassertion of the fact. But I am more interested in the rosy cheek than I am to know</page><page sequence="13">Stephen Spratt 167 what particular diet the maiden fed on" (367-68). Beauty, embodied in the maiden's "rosy cheek," is its own truth, independent of the "diet" of oxygen absorbed from the atmosphere, and it is more significant than the "fact" giving rise to its rosiness. Thoreau's principle of beauty - the essential reality at the centre of "Autumnal Tints" encompasses the physical embodiment of Truth - is the divine presence and force immanent in and yet transcendent of the organic world of nature. In "Thomas Carlyle and His Works," Thoreau essentially describes his own phi- losophy of composition that characterizes both "A Natural History of Massachusetts" and "Autumnal Tints." In this essay, Thoreau claims for poetry the exalted status of "exaggerated history," or of the heroic and real: "Are we not all great men? Yet what are we actually to speak of? We live by exaggeration, [. . .] Exaggerated history is poetry, and truth referred to a new standard [. . .] He who cannot exaggerate is not qualified to utter truth" (200). Exaggeration "is where a true history properly begins, when some genius arises, who can turn the dry and musty records into poetry" (201). Both essays exemplify Thoreaus efforts to turn all-too-literal (and thus partial and degraded) nat- ural histories into prose poetry, rich in meaning, sermonic in effect, delightful to the senses, and evocative of the imagination. If the mind - imagination - radiates dynamic power onto the world, then we might change the world by the way we think, or at least change the way we see it. To read "Autumnal Tints" as a poetic enactment of an ecologically astute and yet spiritually meditative natural history, one that might install the flora and fauna of North America "into our mythology at last" (or into our logos and mythos ), is to imaginatively bridge the gap between the actual and the ideal, between the material and spiritual. In another text compiled toward the very end of his life, the selections that make up Wild FruitSy Thoreau extends the metaphoric significance given to trees in "Autumnal Tints" to include the edible fruits native to the region's landscape and essential to its history. The prose poetry of Wild Fruits rivals that of "Autumnal Tints" and thus further attests to the fact that the poetic force of Thoreaus writing never abated. As Johnson suggests, for Thoreau "perhaps the closest humans can come to expe- riencing this aspect of the natural world - the 'language that is' - is to study natural phenomena closely, attentively, and humbly, to revel in nature's physicality" (182). And yet I believe Thoreau's writing suggests to us that we can only imagine and understand nature in relation to humanity while still cultivating what Johnson calls "a posture of humility in the face of nature" (182), a posture that I, too, wholeheartedly embrace as an antidote to the otherwise destructive manifestations of metaphors that elevate humans above or outside of the environment. Perhaps figurative language is the only language we have at our disposal and our best efforts to convey facts manifest as</page><page sequence="14">168 Mosaic 45/1 (March 201 2) fictions. Yet, our ideas, even our fictions - and by association, the imagination - derive from our contact with the material world of which we, too, are a material part. Ultimately, whatever kind of language we use is bound by human values which, in turn, inevitably spring from figurative language at some level. Thoreau sought to fuse "fact" with truth and he employed a style of writing that attends to the processes of nature as much as to the nature of understanding so that, in the words of nature writer John Burroughs, we might "enjoy understandingly" (251). The poetic grandeur of "Autumnal Tints" inspires us to know and understand joyfully and, therefore, passionately. WORKS CITED Bate, Jonathan. The Song of the Earth. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2000.
