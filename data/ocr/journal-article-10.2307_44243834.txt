<plain_text><page sequence="1">A FRESH SCOTTISH ASH P ITE L AND GLASS SHOE TALE. THROUGH Lerwick - an now old at Melbourne Shetland - friend, a remarkable Mr. Robert Scottish Sinclair version of Lerwick - now at Melbourne - a remarkable Scottish version of the Aschenpiittel tale has reached me, which I have not yet seen printed or heard of anywhere. I owe to that friend already many valuable relics of the folk-lore of his own island home. In answer to one of my inquiries about what he knew of that tale, he wrote to me in July last (1888) from Australia, where he and his family are settled : - " My son George has procured for me another version of the Aessiepattle', or Cinderella story, from his mother-in-law, who had it from her grandfather, and he in turn had it from his grand- mother. His mother-in-law is now an elderly woman. I am not aware that it was ever committed to writing in the family until now. Her native place is a small town not far from Glasgow, in Scotland. I have copied the story and now enclose it. I find there is considerable variation of detail from any other version I have heard of. One most marked is, that it was a raven or ravens that warned the young Prince of his mistake when carrying off the wrong bride. It is, no doubt, of little moment to you, but it proves how a story may be varied and yet bear unmistakable marks of identity and common origin." The tale thus communicated seems to me of considerable moment, and I give it here word for word, as sent : * * * * * Very many years ago there lived a gentleman and a lady in a very beautiful part of the country. They had only one little girl, who was very pretty and very good, and her father and mother were very fond of her. When the little girl was about five years old, her mother died. The father was nearly broken-hearted about the loss of his wife, and left the little girl pretty much to herself. She cried a good deal, and could not understand where her mother had gone that she did not come to her. After a while her father married a .widow lady who had two daughters, both older than the little girl. They were both very</page><page sequence="2">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale . 25 plain, and were jealous of the beauty of their little step-sister. They resolved to try and banish her to the kitchen along with the servants, but the mother was afraid to do that for fear of her husband. She at last devised a plan by which she thought in time to cause her step-daughter's death. The little girl was very fond of the fields and flowers and sheep. The sheep had found a hole leading into the garden, and the mother told the little girl that she must stay and watch the hole and not let the sheep through, and that she would send her some dinner. When dinner-time came, she sent her out a thimbleful of broth, a grain of barley, a thread of meat, and a crumb of bread. The little girl was not long till she had finished that, and felt just as hungry as if she had not had anything. She did not dare to go home, as she had been told to stay out till night. She began to cry ; and as she sat crying, a little black lamb came up to her and wanted to know what was the matter with her. So she told it she had had no dinner, and was very hungry. The little black lamb told her not to cry, but to put her finger into its ear, and see what she could find. So she put her finger in, and got a big piece of bread, and the little lamb told her to put her finger in the other ear, and she did so, and got a big piece of cheese, and had a good dinner, and felt quite happy. In the evening, instead of being tired and hungry, as her step- mother had expected, she was quite bright and cheerful. Next day she was told to go out again, and her stepmother told her she would not send her any dinner. But the little lamb came again, and gave her some more bread and cheese. So the stepmother began to think there was more in it than she knew of ; so she sent a man to watch next day. He saw the lamb feed the little girl with bread and cheese, and went home and told the stepmother. Then she said to her husband she would like to have one of the sheep killed, and he told her she could kill any one she wished. So she had the little black lamb killed. Next day, when the little girl was sitting crying in the field, a funny little old woman came up and . asked her what was the matter ; and when the little girl told her about the lamb, she told her not to cry, but to go gather all the bones and bring them to her. She gathered all the bones ; but one shank-bone she could not find, and so she gave all the others to the little old woman. When Sunday came, the .girl was left to cook the dinner while the others went to church. The stepmother only left her a</page><page sequence="3">26 The Archœological Review . thimbleful of water, a grain of barley, and a crumb of bread, and told her she was to make a big pot of soup. The little girl did not know what to do, and she was sitting crying and wishing for her little lamb ; she was sure it would have helped her. Then in came the little lamb, limping, limping because a shank- bone was a- wanting, and told her not to cry, but to get dressed and go to church, and it would cook the dinner, but to be sure to leave before the church was out. So she went and dressed herself and put on a pretty pair of glass slippers she had. When she reached the church, service had commenced, and she sat near the door. It happened that there was a young Prince near her, and he was so struck with her beauty he thought he would follow her and see where she lived. But she went out before him, and he was too late. When she came home, she put on her old clothes ; and her stepmother and sisters were astonished to find the dinner ready. Next Sunday she was again left at home, and the lamb came again, and sent her off to church. This Sunday the Prince followed her ; and in her haste to get away, she lost one of her slippers. The Prince picked it up and put it in his pocket, finding he could not follow her. The next day he sent out a proclamation that he would marry whoever could get the slipper on. In course of time he came to the house where the little girl lived, and one of her step-sisters said she could get the slipper on. So she took a chopper, and chopped off her toes and a piece of her heel, and put the slipper on. The Prince put her on his horse behind him to take her away to his castle, where he was to marry her. On the road they had to pass some trees. On the first tree there was a raven, which said : Haggit-heels and Hewed-toes1 Behind the young Prince rides. But Pretty-foot and Bonnie-foot Behind the caldron hides. Then the Prince said : " What did that bird say ?" " Oh," said she, " never mind it ! It is only talking nonsense." However, on the next tree another bird - also a raven - said the same thing. Then the Prince got off and looked at her foot, and found it all blood. He then said he was sure the slipper did not belong to her. 1 I believe these names, being nicknames for a person, should be written in capitals, as the verb which follows is in the singular.</page><page sequence="4">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale . 27 So he took her back to her mother, and insisted on looking behind the caldron, and there he saw the little girl. She asked to go and change her dress and get the other slipper; and she came down with it on. The Prince recognised her at once, and took her away on his horse, behind him. When passing the first tree, the bird said : Pretty-foot and Bonnie-foot Behind the young Prince rides. But Haggit-heels and Hewed-toes At home with Mamma bides. They rode on and reached the castle, and lived happily ever after, and if they are not dead, they are living yet. II. The heroine of this Scottish version, it will be seen, remains nameless. She is simply " the little girl". In the German tale, " a little stumpy Aschenputtel" is the expression used by her own father, when he tries to hinder further search being made for her at his house by the Prince. In the Scottish version, the Little Girl only comes in for a sort of name, as Pretty-foot and Bonnie-foot, given to her by the wise raven. As in the German tale, she is banished at first to the kitchen. When at home, she hides behind the caldron - even as Aschenputtel, the French Cucendron, the Italian Cenerentola, the Servian Pepelluga, and others, sit in the ashes, in accordance with the meaning of their names. But otherwise the Little Girl's trials mainly happen in the open air. There is a breath of fell and field in this, as in other Scottish versions. This trait also marks a Finnish Ashpitel story, in which, however, the more poetical Germanic kernel of the tale is mixed up with the most horrid Ugrian or Lappish hag element. The helpful animal in the above variant occurs similarly in the Scottish "Rashin Coatie" story, as well as in the Gaelic tale of " The Sharp (Horned) Grey Sheep." In " Rashin Coatie" it is a little red calf who supplies the bonnie little lassie - the ill-used daughter of a king, and of a queen who had died - with everything wanted. In both these cases there is the same miraculous revival of the friendly beast that has been killed. Helpful animals turn up in many popular tales of cultured as well as of utterly barbarous</page><page sequence="5">2 8 The A rchœolog teal Review. nations, being in the former case, probably, a poetical survival from a time of animal worship. In the earliest story known to us, which has a certain affinity with that of Cinderella, namely, in the tale of Eros and Psyche, as given by Apuleius, we have the main contents of the widespread tale, including helpful insects. There is a king in the classic story, and there are three sisters, two of whom are jealous of the charm- ing Psyche. Among the trials imposed upon her by the revengeful Aphrodite is the task of dividing a mass of mixed grain and seed - wheat, barley, hyrse, poppy, peas, and lentils - so as to pick out each sort into a little heap by itself. " I think," says the spiteful Goddess, "thou must earn thy lover for thyself by industrious work !" A swarm of pitying and sympathetic ants then comes to do the work. Have we not here the pease and the lentils ot Aschenputtel aided by the turtle-doves ? The food-yielding ears of the friendly animal we know from Scottish, Norse, as well as Finnish, Servian, and other European stories, even from a Zulu tale. In some cases the horns of a bull or ram are substituted for the ears. As to the Zulu tale, there is no saying whether it may not be rather a recent adaptation of a European one. The " funny little old woman" of the Scottish variant commu- nicated to me, is apparently a vague echo of the transfigured dead mother of Ashpitel. Whilst in the German, the Finnish, and other tales, the scene of the girPs love adventures is laid in a king's castle, the West-Scottish story before us makes the two lovers meet on Sundays in the church - quite in harmony with the strong theological bias of the people on the other side of the Tweed. In the Gaelic tale, collected and translated by Mr. J. F. Campbell, the Prince is " wishful to see her at the sermon". In " Rashin Coatie" they " go to the kirk". Apart from this interpolated modern and Christian trait, which is not to be found in the German and other stories, our West- Scottish version has preserved very antique features, some of them reminding us of the Finnish tale from Russian Karelia, others of the Teutonic Märchen . Instead of the two white little doves of Aschenputtel, or the nameless bird of other stories, we this time meet with two ravens. The wise birds of Odin - Hugin and Munin (Thought and Remembrance) - readily suggest themselves to the mind. In Germany the raven has become a bird of ill-omen, through a Christianising degradation from its former status. It often happens</page><page sequence="6">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale . 29 that some portions of an ancient religion thus fall into disesteem, whilst others continue as a living belief under the guise of a tolerated superstition which dogs the steps of the New Faith. In this country the raven still holds his lofty place, as of yore under the ruler of Asgard. Witness the hosts of these birds kept near English country mansions. Their croaking voice is by no means considered an evil sound, as it is in Germany, where on the other hand many forms and figures of Teutonic nature-worship yet haunt hill and dale, forest, field, and stream, lake and sea, even under their old heathen names. In the West-Scottish tale above given, the two ravens are certainly inconvenient birds for the wrong brides, but knowing, good, and helpful ones to the hero and the heroine of the story. In this way the black-feathered pair maintain the old reputation of « wisdom the raven had in the Odinic creed. Before the use of the magnet, ravens, specially prepared for the occasion by a sacrificial rite, were sent out by Northmen from a ship, in order to ascertain the nearness of land. " Odin's Raven's Charm" is the title of one of the profoundest Eddie songs, which in its brief, abrupt mysteri- ousness contains the old religious lore as in a nutshell. Remem- bering all this, we seem to have a special Germanic trait in the selection of ravens as warners to the princely bridegroom. III. In the tale before us, the ill-treated girl's slippers are, very properly, of glass . In " Rashin Coatie" they are " beautiful satin slippers". The very word " satin" proves that on this particular point the original story has suffered a modern corruption in Morayshire. Gold, glass, or crystal (as in the Catalan version) is clearly the material wanted for duly maintaining the tale, let alone the mythical meaning, the solar idea, which may underlie it. In Grimm, the bird on the hazel-tree which has grown from the mother's grave, throws down, on the first day, a golden and silver dress, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. But on the third day, Aschen- puttel gets the decisive slippers, which are ganz golden , wholly golden. When the king's son calls at the wealthy man's house, he brings with him the " golden shoe". Thrice this expression " wholly golden", or " golden", is used in that German tale within a few lines, as if to get it well into the listener's mind. The " golden shoe" occurs a fourth time towards the end, when it is</page><page sequence="7">30 The Archœological Review . said that the shoe fits Aschenputtel as if the foot were in a mould (wie angegossen ). It is a well-known storyteller's habit thus to lay stress upon an important point of a tale. I have pointed out elsewhere that the decisive shoe must have been of such material as to be absolutely proof against yielding to the foot. In the German tale the daughters go into their own chamber with the mother, to cut off their great toe, which they could not get into the all-golden shoe, because, forsooth, a metal shoe cannot by any means be made to yield. Now suppose the slipper had been of fur, or some other soft stuff, instead of solid gold, glàss, or crystal, would the story have been possible at all ? Are we to imagine that it would have been a feat beyond the cleverness of two women, secreted in a chamber, to widen a fur or satin shoe, so as to push the foot in, even if it had to be done with a great deal of temporary pain ? A fur or satin shoe might burst if the foot were forced into it. Or it might be filled with a cramped or pained foot. Or some trick might be resorted to, by women clever with the needle, to widen the slipper, and so deceive the king's son. But the story stood in need of an impenetrable material, in order to be likely at all, even on fanciful Märchen lines. Women, it must not be forgotten, are mainly the transmitters, of these tales. A woman's mind would not easily miss such a point. Hence, even on that simple ground, it is clear that gold, glass, or crystal, must have been in the original tale. Glass and gold - as I have also pointed out before - are, after all, not so different, etymologically speaking. Golden-coloured amber, as is recorded by Roman writers, was called gless( um) by our forefathers ; and from that same root the word " glass" is derived. The glistening, glittering, glimmering, glaring, glinting quality is embodied in many gl words. So the glass slippper of Aschenputtel may well be a survival from a time when " gless" still in some degree retained the meaning of a more valuable material - whether amber, which so struck the fancy of the Greeks, that Homer1 compares it to the rays of the sun ; or gold itself. Gless means that which gleisst or glistens. To this day we say, in German, das gleissende Gold, Now, amber was at one time valued as highly as gold, or even more so. Speaking from the most distinct personal remembrance, I can aver that the decisive shoe in this, to me, often-told story - which sticks with wonderful freshness in my memory, after so many 1 Odyssey , xviii, 296.</page><page sequence="8">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale . 31 changes of things - was always a glass shoe : not a silk, and silver embroidered one ; not a fur-trimmed one ; nor even a golden one, as in Grimm; though the tale, as told in my childhood, was, otherwise, almost word for word, the same as that in Grimm. Of glass the shoe was in the tale as I heard it from peasant girls, who mostly in those days could not even read and write. Glass, or gold, is certainly an important feature in this tale. Even in Perraulťs pitifully modernised and finnikin version, with its early rococo "Moralité" tacked to it, the old tradition is still preserved in this particular point : the slippers are of glass - verre ; not vair&gt; fur. If there has been a corruption in some other tales, it must have been not from vair to verre&gt; but just the other way - in consequence of a would-be rationalising change, which yet, on closer inspection, proves irrational. Shoes of glass, or gold, I look upon as a characteristic of antiquity in an Ashpitel story. The Scottish tale sent by Mr. Sinclair shows noteworthy traces of antiquity in the wonderful food-yielding ears of the little lamb, as well as in its magical revival. Quite in accordance with that strongly primitive character which almost leads up to animal-worship, the tale communicated to me keeps to what is, no doubt, the earliest notion about the foot-gear. It does not speak of satin, or fur, but of glass slippers. Maybe they once were gless ones - amber or gold. In a number of Northern versions, Scandinavian, Finnish, Scottish (in Anglian speech), and Gaelic, gold or glass is the material - even as in the German tale. In a Swedish version, in which the warning against the false bride's feet is almost in the same words as in Anglian Scottish, we hear of golden shoes. Whilst in the Scottish tales we have "Nippit-Fit and Clippit- Fit", or " Haggit-Heels and Hewed-Toes", as the mocking name of the false bride ; it is " hacked heels and clipped toes ( huggen häl och klippen ta) in Swedish ; and then it is said " that in the oven is she whom the golden shoe fits." In Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands 1 the Prince gives a pair of golden shoes to the first queen's daughter. Very much as in the German tale ( Rucke di guck, Blut ist im Schuck ; der Schick ist zu klein; die rechte Braut sitzt noch daheim ), the bird in the Gaelic Highland story sings : - " The blood is in the shoe, and the pretty foot is in the nook at the back of the fire." In the end, the golden shoe ( bròg oir) is found on one of the feet of the right bride. The translator, Mr. Campbell, who has in so many other 1 No. 43, "The Sharp (Horned) Sheep."</page><page sequence="9">32 The A rchceological Review. instances ably shown how Highland tales and songs preserve, under Keltic garb, the poetry, the superstitions, the history, and the race-features of the early Scandinavian conquerors, says in this instance also that the first part of the story, with " the sheep that came alive again and was lame, is like Norse mythology (Story of Thor and the Goats he killed)," and that " the second part is closer to the Norse versions of Cinderella than to the English story." Perhaps the description, in the West Highland tale given by Mr. Campbell, of the henwife's daughter - who is to be foisted upon the young Prince, in the place of the first queen's daughter - as a " bald blackskinned girl" is a further proof of an original Teutonic story underlying the Gaelic one. In the Eddie " Lay of Rigr" the three classes are bodily described : the thralls, the karls (freemen), and the jarls (noblemen). The black skin is noted with other un- favourable traits, as one of the marks of the thralls ( hörfi svartan , hétu thraęl ). This slave class was composed of the aborigines of Lapp and Finn blood, who had been conquered by the fair-haired, clear-eyed, white or rosy-skinned Teutons, who came into Scan- dinavia under their Asie leader Odin. A wealth of long hair is always attributed to the German races by classic writers. It seems, therefore, as if the hen wife's " bald black-skinned girl", in the Gaelic tale, were meant to indicate the offspring from a second wife of non-Teutonic blood. But we must return to the golden shoes. In the Finnish tale of " The Wonderful Birch",1 in which the hag plays so large and cruelly weird a part, we have again golden shoes. As in the German tale, the King's son gets possession of the girl's foot-gear by having tar put on the threshold. Gustav Meyer, in the Introduction to the book, lays stress on the close connection of the Finnish tale-treasure with the neighbouring Germanic and Slavonian folk-poetry. There is one passage in " The Wonderful Birch" apparently full of meaning. In accordance with the German tale, the ill-treated Finnish Ashpitel receives from the wonder- working tree (which is the transfigured mother herself) splendid garments, but also - and here we come upon a new point - a magic horse on whom she can ride with the swiftness of an arrow over the walls of the King's castle. This horse's hair is " partly golden, partly silvern, partly even more precious ." What material could the latter expression mean ? And what does Ashpitel's magic horse himself signify ? 1 Finnische Märchen. Von Emmy Schreck. (No. 9.)</page><page sequence="10">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale. 33 We know, as before mentioned, that in grey antiquity amber was often prized even more than gold and silver. In the case of Freyr's and Freya's golden-bristled boars (Gullinbursti and Hildiswin), on which these deities ride, gold represents the sun. Even now, the luminous orb is continually called, in German, "the golden sun" - so much so among the masses that these words, and their pictorial representation, are from olden times a favourite sign of German inns. Now, can it be that in the Finnish tale there is a hint as to the varied aspect of the sun's rays, in the threefold luminous hair of Ashpitel's fleet horse - the morning, midday, and evening sun being perhaps meant ? Is that horse perchance the Sun, seeing that the wonderful steed, with its shining hair of three resplendent hues, goes with the swiftness of an arrow over the King's castle? I am loth to bind myself strictly to any Sun and Dawn theory in the interpretation of the Ashpitel tale. Still, this remarkable horse may, like the ravens in the West-Scottish tale, possibly be á mythological survival from very olden times. At all events, the allusion to a material even more precious than gold and silver is a curious point ; for the Finnish tale comes from the region of the ancient amber trade - from the close neighbourhood of the Baltic. IV. Here I must ask the reader to go with me into a disquisition on amber, calculated to shed light on the glass or golden shoes of the hidden Beauty when she rises, in golden and silver raiment, from the dark ashy-grey abode which had concealed her splendour. It has been already hinted at in the foregoing remarks, that the glass or golden shoes may have been at first ¿less ones - of golden- coloured amber. The " crystal" in the Catalan Cinderella story is, of course, only another word for glass. A shining, glittering, hard material is thus always mentioned in the genuine tale. Catalonia has her name from the Goths and Alans (Gothalania = Catalonia), as Andalusia has hers from the Vandals. If ever it could be shown - though we can scarcely hope for such a find being made1 1 Yet, by a remarkable find in Spanish archives, the identity ot *reia (or Friga) with Holda, which had long been suspected, but which could not be proved, was at last evidenced from a Latin text referring to the ancient creed of the Goths, in which the great Goddess is spoken of as u Friga- Holda." VOL. III. D</page><page sequence="11">34 The Archœological Review . - that the Catalonian tale is of so old a date as to reach back to Gothic times, the crystal also might be interpreted as a presum- able substitute for gless : that is, amber or even gold, glistening in sunny radiancy. The fact is, amber, gold, and the sun are, as will presently be proved, interchangeable terms in ancient mythology. They are in- terchangeable in Greek as well as in Teutonic myths ; the Greek idea having probably, in this case of an eminently Northern product, been engrafted upon an original Teutonic one. This strange convertibility of terms is seen already, to some extent, in the passage from the Odyssey before quoted. A golden breast-ornament is mentioned there, " set with amber, comparable to the radiant sun." It is probably more than a simple poetical comparison ; a mythical notion being, no doubt, hidden in it. Amber was held to be of solar origin , in a transmuted terrestrial form. This clearly appears from the story of Phaëthon. The fate of that rash charioteer is wept by his three sisters, the Heliades, or daughters of the Sun, each of whom moreover bears a sun-name (Aigle, Lampetie, and Phaëthusa) ; and so long do they indulge in wails until at last they are changed into trees, when, as they con- tinue their laments, the tears running from their tree-forms are hardened in the water into electron or amber. Looked at from the point of view of natural science, we have in this myth a very ancient and perfectly correct rendering of the outcome of amber from the resin of trees, afterwards found in the sea as a hardened material. The story of Phaëthon himself might be explained as that of an earth revolution, in the course of which vegetation was consumed, when amber ¿was the result. Nature myths, generally, contain a great deal of early scientific specula- tion. At the same time we have, in this story of Phaëthon, amber in closest connection with the sun ; the Heliades producing it as a' liquid in their arboreal state, and the shining quality of the precious material being thus explained from a solar source. Niķias, whom Plinius (Nat. Hist., xxxvii, 11) quotes, would have it even in a more direct way that " amber is ą liquid generated by the rays of the sun" ; and he adds that " it is carried off from the earth by the tides of the ocean, and thrown upon the shores of the Germans." The Greek myth localises the Heliades, in their amber-en- gendering tree-shape, at the Eridanus. That has been held some- times to mean the ancient name for the Po. But Plinius already</page><page sequence="12">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale . 35 combats this assumption, together with other " vain statements of the Greeks", on account of the non-existence of amber at that river. He further says that there are no islands called Elektrides in the Adriatic, as was alleged by the Greeks, but that " amber is doubtless a product of the islands of the Northern Ocean, and called £-/ess(um) by the Germans," and that it was originally the gum or resin of a pine-tree. Plinius also mentions that Pytheas of Massilia - who had visited the German Ocean and the Baltic in the fourth century before our era - speaks of the amber trade of the Gutons (Goths) with the Teutons. Now, it has long been suspected that, instead of the Eridanus, the river Radanus - a confluent of the Vistula near the Baltic, where amber so plentifully came from - was originally in the tale about the weeping daughters of the sun. The sound of " Radanus" and " Eridanus" is similar enough to bring about a confusion. The Greeks, moreover, were great adapters, by set purpose, of foreign myths and words to their own use and tongue. Con- sidering all this, we are thus led up to the likelihood of a northern source of the Heliades' tale. The sun, it need scarcely be said, was also a deity in the eyes of the Goths and Teutons at Pytheas' time. The " barbarians" - the eminent Greek traveller wrote in a fragmentary passage that has come down to us - t% were in the habit of pointing out to us the sleeping-place of the sun." Among the Teutons of Pytheas' time, therefore, the Sun could actually have had daughters. In oldest German the sun is of male gender, different from what it is in our present language. As late as in Hans Sachs, it is once still called " der Sunn". However, whether male or female, a Teu- tonic sun could have daughters as well as a Greek one. Even the most transitory phenomena of the heavens are sometimes looked upon, by early races, in anthropomorphic manner. In an old Shetland rhyme still current, the rainbow has a " fader", a " mider", and a sister who is " brought ta bed o' a gentleman's son."1 In the Edda, " the Sun has born a daughter, not less beautiful than she herself is."2 There the Sun is of the female sex. What prevents us, then, from assuming that the Greeks, who confessedly worked a mass of Thrakian and other foreign myths into their own religion, also took over a northern legend concerning amber, together with that substance itself? 1 " Discovery of Odinic Songs in Shetland," by Karl Blind. ( Nineteenth Century ; June, 1879.) 2 Gylfaginnîng. D 2</page><page sequence="13">36 The Archœological Review . V. This northern origin of the Heliades' tale appears to me all the more likely, because there are Skythian and Teutonic names for amber, preserved by the Romans, which easily fit in with the Heliades' myth, or with the general idea of a solar connection of amber. The words in question are sacr{ ium), and svalitém - (icum). The Germanic kinship of the Skyths clearly appears from a careful comparison of classic writers. It has been upheld by not a few learned men ; and it is most ably made out again, with linguistic and other evidence, by Johannes Fressl in his recent remarkable work, The Skytho-Sakians : the Forebears of the Ger- mans . He very skilfully explains the Skythian word sacr (amber) as tear (Gothic : tagr ; Old High German: zahar ; modern German: Zähre). I may add : Bá/cpvfia, lacrima. The author refers, in this connection, to the mythic production of amber from solar tears. Does not this remind us of the tears of the Greek sun-daughters ? I think the word saca/ - used in Egypt, according to Plinius, for amber - may possibly be but another form of sacr ; Skythian and kindred fair-haired Indo-Germanic tribes having played, as we now well know, an important part in ancient Egyptian history. They may have brought amber there, as well as the word for it. Another Teutonic, or Skythian, word for amber, besides gless and sacry is svalitern(icum). Mr. Johannes Fressl ingeniously endeavours to explain it as that which has swollen out, or exuded, from a tree (Gothic : triu ; Old Saxon : trio, treo ; Old High Ger- man : tar, tery tra). If this hypothesis were correct, svalitém would indicate, in Skytho-Germanic speech, the resinous origin of amber. I suspect, however - as I have more fully stated in a German essay some years ago - that svalitém is a name in connection with that Cooling Shield, or screen, called Svalin , which in the Edda is said to stand before the sun, so as to prevent the earth from being burnt up by his fierce rays : Svalin the shield is hight which stands before the sun, The shining God. Mountain and sea would, I ween, be burnt, Fell it from its place. In German, Scandinavian, and English, the root of the word " Svalin" signifies, in three gradations of meaning, that which is burning without an open flame ; that which is heat-covering, heat-</page><page sequence="14">A Fresh Scottish Ashpitel Tale . 37 subduing ; lastly, even simply: cool. (Comp. German : schwelen: to slowly burn under cover without a flame ; Danish : swale , coolness ; English : swale, shade.) In point of fact, curiously enough, amber was used for heat-subduing purposes. Roman ladies were in the habit of holding amber balls in their hands for the purpose of cooling themselves in summer. This fact must have been known to the northern nations who sold the golden-glittering material to the Phœnikians, the Greeks, and the Romans. The syllable " tern", again, might easily be explained from the Gothic tarnjan , to cover ; Middle High German : tarnen or temen ; to which correspond kindred forms in Anglo-Saxon. In the tarnhût or Tarnkappe (magic hiding hood) the word is still pre- served. " Svalitém" would consequently mean the Flam e-Coverer, or the heat-subduing, the cooling material.1 In Norse mythology, the shield Svalin, being of course trans- lucent, served as a kind of glass screen against the sun, like those now in use for keeping off the scorching glow of a fireplace. Is it going too far to assume that the northern nations would imagine the shield to be of gless, that heat-covering, cooling substance which lets the rays of the sun through, and which in the Heliades' tale, whose Northern origin is likely enough, was even believed to be of solar formation ? Indeed, the screen Svalin, under whose cover the sun burns, is sometimes itself said, in the Norse creed, to be the sun. We can only understand that by supposing Svalin to have been made of svalitém, that is, of amber, whose sunny radiancy and whose solar connection are so much dwelt upon by ancient writers, who manifestly must have had their traditional amber-lore from the country where amber came from. Truly, no great stretch of 1 An attempt has been made, thirty years ago, in W. BesselPs " Pytheas of Massilia", to explain " svaliternicum" as lignite, because, as Plinius writes, Pytheas had stated that the Baltic Goths used amber as fuel, and sold it to the Teutons for the same purpose. Amber could, of course, not be so used. This is, however, clearly an instance of a misunderstanding, by Plinius, of some details of Pytheas' lost work. Lignite, no doubt, burns without an open flame, and it must have been some material like that - not amber - which was used as fuel by the Goths and Teutons. Evidently two different statements of Pytheas had got mixed up in course of time. However, in the passage where Plinius speaks of svaliternicum , he quite correctly says that there are two kinds of amber, one of a white and wax-like colour, the other of a yellowish-red (fulvum), which latter is called " svaliternicum". These colours exactly fit in with the report of Mr. Otto Helm, the Danzich chymist, in his disquisition on "The Mykenêan Amber'', which is proved to be of Baltic origin. (See Dr. Schliemann's Tiryns; London : Murray, 1886.)</page><page sequence="15">33 The Archceological Review . imagination is required to think that early Teutons, who anthropo- morphised the sun, may have looked upon the rounded and radiant amber-balls that floated in their seas, as tears from divine solar forms, perhaps shed at a time when, the shield Svalin being removed, there was. such a terrestrial catastrophe as is indicated in the Eddie " Song of Grimnir" (v. 38). I have gone into this disquisition to show that gless (amber), hence glass and crystal, gold, and the sun, are mythically well-nigh identical. The glass, crystal, or golden shoes of the Beauty who rises from ashy darkness into golden and silvern splendour, seem to me therefore a very important feature of the Cinderella story, even though this decisive trait should have been lost in some versions of the tale - as often happens. In the Finnish tale, which on that particular point has preserved the purer tradition, the radiant and golden-shoed Beauty rides on the horse whose mane is partly golden, partly silvern, partly "even more precious", right over the castle walls, as if she and her steed were the bright orb of heaven itself. Taking all these circumstances into account, would it be too great a wonder if Aschenputtels slippers had originally been of gless , of golden-hued amber? If so, we could easily understand the differentiation of her shoes into glass, crystal, or golden ones, as well as suspect that, after all, the image of the Sun is mixed up with the tale that has for ages charmed so many youthful hearts.
