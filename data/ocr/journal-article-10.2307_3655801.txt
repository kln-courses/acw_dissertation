McGinn shows what the differences are, arguing that imagination is a sui generis mental faculty. He goes on to discuss the nature of dreaming and madness, contending that these are primarily imaginative phenomena. new in cloth LAW'S QUANDARY STEVEN D. SMITH Steven Smith argues that our legal vocabulary and methods of reason- ing presuppose classical ontological commitments that were explicitly articulated by thinkers from Aquinas to Coke to Blackstone, and even by Joseph Story. But these commitments are out of sync with the world view that prevails today in academic and professional thinking. So our law-talk thus degenerates into "just words"-or a kind of nonsense. new in cloth J. J. ROUSSEAU: AN AFTERLIFE OF WORDS ELI FRIEDLANDER Eli Friedlander reads Rousseau's au- tobiography, Reveries of the Solitary Walker, as philosophy. Reading this work against Descartes's Meditations, Friedlander shows how Rousseau's memorable transformation of experi- ence through writing opens up the possibility of affirming even the most dejected state of being and allows the emergence of the innocence of nature out of the ruins of all social attachments. new in cloth WWW.HUP.HARVARD.EDU HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS</page><page sequence="2">Notable I PHYSICALISM, OR SOMETHING NEAR ENOUGH Jaegwon Kim Contemporary discussions in philoso- phy of mind have largely been shaped by physicalism, the doctrine that all phenomena are ultimately physical.

By contrast, Michael Theunissen articulates one of Kierkegaard's central ideas, his theory of despair, in a detailed and compre- hensible manner and confronts it with alternatives. It is also one of the few works on Kierkegaard that bridge the gap between the Continental and analytic traditions in philosophy.
