<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. XLV, No. 5, April, 1972 Printed in U.S.A. The Use of Mirrors and Mirror Analogues in Maupassant's Le Horla by Brewster E. Fitz TwO APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY READINGS of Le Horla are suggested by the anonymous author's frequent questioning of his own sanity: 1) The first reading would assume the author to be sane and to remain sane while he becomes the slave of a foreign will. The variations on the theme of pseudo-scientism, e.g., the frequent mention of limits of human perception, the reference to Mesmer, the use of hypnotism, and the mention of a fictional scientific publication, la Revue du monde scientifique, support this reading. 2) The second reading would assume the author to be insane, and to become increasingly alienated as he records in his journal the so-called events, which are actually hallucinations arising from his deranged faculties of perception. The equal credibility of these two readings comes from a carefully constructed ambiguity in the tale. There is a third reading, 3) that of the biographical critic, who certainly would point out the similarities between the "madness" of the anonymous author and the madness of Maupassant.' Inherent in these three readings is the presupposition that there exists a priori an external norm, independent of the text, which one can use to measure the deviation from the "real" represented by the "imaginary," from the "sane," represented by the "insane," in this so-called fantastic tale. The third reading treats the text as a signifiant of an external signifie,2 viz., similar "real" events in 'Armand Lanoux has undertaken a partial reading of this kind in his biography: Maupassant le bel-ami (Paris: Fayard, 1967). See especially pages 243-248. 2 Owing to a lack of convincing equivalents in English I have chosen to retain the French terms signifiant and signifie', which were first defined by Ferdinand de Saussure: "Le signe linguistique unit non une chose et un nom, mais un concept et une image acoustique....

While not denying the interest of a biographical reading, the term author is used in this essay to designate the anonymous diarist, never Maupassant. The reader of a journal has the impression of being presented with a faithful written record of brute facts, or at least, with a record that is more credible than the one resulting from a story told in the third person by a minor figure (the technique of Un Fou?, an incipient version of Le Horla), or from a first person narrative, retold by a minor figure (the technique of the first version of Le Horla). The contradictory implications of the themes which support the first two readings suggested above, create a play between irrationality and rationality, superstition and science, deranged perception and extremely acute perception, which casts a certain doubt on the "brute facts" recorded by the author. These two readings, and the third, affirm the dichotomy real/imaginary, and imply a clear distinction between thing and idea, between idea and word (in linguistic terms: between rdfirent and signifide, signifide and signifiant), which, if clear to certain critics, is not so clear to the anonymous author. Indeed his problems can be seen to arise in part from the difficulty he experiences while trying to make such a distinction. Mirrors and mirror analogues (often associated in the text with the acts of writing and reading) give rise to a series of ambiguities which contribute to this difficulty and cast further doubt on the existence of "brute facts." I propose a structural reading, 4) respectivement par signifie et signifiant" (Cours de Linguistique Generale, pp. 98-99). For Saussure the study of a text did not belong to the area of linguistics; in this essay signifiant designates the graphic representation of the spoken word, i.e., the signifiant of Saussure's signifiant. Roland Barthes, writing of a type of critique de signification, uses these terms to describe a theoretical presupposition upon which the third reading suggested above is based: "La critique de signification dont vous parlez peut elle-meme, me semble-t-il, se diviser en deux groupes distincts; d'un cot6 une critique qui donne une tres grande plenitude et un contour tres ferme au signifi6 de l'oeuvre litteraire, puisque, pour tout dire, elle le nomme. Ce signifie nomme est, dans le cas de Goldmann, la situation politique reelle d'un certain groupe social... dans le cas de Mauron, c'est la situation biographique de l'&amp;crivain au moment de son enfance ...dans le cas de Goldmann, le signifiant (l'oeuvre, ou pour etre plus exact le relais que Goldmann introduit justement et qui est la vision du monde) risque toujours d'apparaftre comme le produit de la conjoncture sociale, la signification servant au fond a masquer le vieux schema deterministe; et dans le cas de Mauron, ce meme signifiant se degage mal de l'expression chore a l'ancienne psychologie (ce pour quoi, sans doute, la Sorbonne vient d'ingerer si facilement la psychanalyse litteraire, sous les especes de la these de Mauron) Essais Critiques, pp. 267-268.</page><page sequence="3">956 FRENCH REVIEW which focuses on the reflexive relations among signifiants in the text. This reading questions the validity of a reading of Le Horla which goes outside the text in search of meaning, as the story seems to be primarily a story about writing a story: in other words, the signifiant is its own signifid.3 The theme of the mirror, owing to an analogy which is perhaps not immediately obvious, is implicit in the choice of a journal as a literary genre. A journal is, figuratively speaking, a mirror which the author holds at an oblique angle in order for the reader to see him, and directly in front of himself, in order to see his own image. This topos is ancient. There are four principal variations on the mirror theme in the text. The first one I should like to consider is a mirror analogue, which, incidentally, recalls in one respect the relation between the critic and the text. It is the master/slave relationship which first appears in the legend that the old monk tells the author during his visit at Mont Saint-Michel: "... un vieux berger, dont on ne voit jamais la tate couverte de son manteau, et qui conduit, en marchant devant eux, un bouc a figure d'homme et une chevre a figure de femme, tous les deux avec de longs cheveux blancs et parlant sans cesse, se querellant dans une langue inconnue, puis cessant soudain de crier pour baler de toute leur force."4 The 3The method I have adopted is similar to the one proposed by Jacques Derrida in De la Grammatologie for the study of Rousseau's "Essai sur l'origine des langues": "Et pourtant, si la lecture ne doit pas se contenter de redoubler le texte, elle ne peut lgitimement transgresser le texte vers autre chose que lui, vers un r'f~rent (rdalit' mitaphysique, historique, psycho-biographique, etc.) ou vers un signifie hors texte dont le contenu pourrait avoir lieu, aurait pu avoir lieu hors de la langue, c'est-a-dire, au sens que nous donnons ici ' ce mot, hors de l'criture en gendrale" (p. 227). By adopting a method that refuses to separate the signifid and the signifiant this essay questions certain dichotomies fundamental to Occidental thought, although it does not pretend to undertake a systematic de-construction of metaphysics, nor does it pretend to defend the proposals made by Mr. Derrida in "L'Ecriture avant la lettre," the first part of De la Grammatologie. Furthermore, I am aware that the choice of terms such as "ambiguity," the use of certain analogies, and the remarks about "literary discourse" which are made further below in this essay, imply an influence and perhaps an inescapable grounding in the very metaphysics Mr. Derrida questions. Indeed he concedes that one cannot flatly reject the fundamental dichotomies of dualistic thought: "Bien entendu, il ne s'agit pas de 'rejeter' ces notions: elles sont necessaires et, aujourd'hui du moins, pour nous, plus rien n'est pensable sans elles. Il s'agit d'abord de mettre en evidence la solidarite systematique et historique de concepts et de gestes de pensee qu'on croit souvent pouvoir separer innocemment" (p. 25). 4 Oeuvres comple'tes illustrees de Guy de Maupassant, Le Horla, VI (Paris: Paul Ollendorff, 1903), 14. All subsequent quotations in this essay are taken from this edition.</page><page sequence="4">MAUPASSANT 957 anthropomorphic character of these two animals and the fact that they are following a shepherd of a somewhat foreboding appearance, whose head cannot be seen, suggest a parallel between their situation and that of the people, which will be compared to a troupeau, to a betail humain, and that of the author, who compares himself to an animal domptd which is following the will of an invisible being. The same anthropomorphic character, which encourages the comparison between the goats and the people, also calls to mind the dualistic conception of human nature, prevalent in Occidental thought, and perhaps best expressed in the dichotomy of Pascal: bite/ange. Thus within each legendary creature there is a second master/slave relationship, which is a mirror analogue of the first; both are mirror analogues of the other master/slave relationships in the story. This interior dichotomy is explicit not only in the physical features, but also in the linguistic habits of the creatures, which alternate between speech and bleating. A second possible master/slave relationship is found in the couple formed by the author and his coachman. The remark that the latter has suffered from an illness similar to that of his master, foreshadows the ambiguity of slave and master in the author's relationship with the invisible being. The coachman and the invisible being are doubles of the author. During his visit in Paris, which permits him to recover from his illness (much worse since the return from Mont Saint-Michel), the author makes several unflattering remarks about the people of France which is celebrating July 14: "Le peuple est un troupeau imbecile, tantit stupidement patient et tantit ferocement revolte. On lui dit: 'Amuse-toi.' Il s'amuse" (p. 21). The directors who are represented as telling the people what to do in an imperative similar to the one the author will later use with his coachman, are on the one hand in the place of the master, but on the other, in the place of the slave, as they too obey principles and ideas, the certainty of which the author questions: "... c'est-a-dire des idees reputees certaines et immuables, en ce monde oui l'on n'est shlr de rien, puisque la lumiere est une illusion, puisque le bruit est une illusion" (p. 22). This uncertainty about the nature and existence of ideas is similar to the uncertainty of the author about the nature and existence of the invisible being, which itself may be no more than an obsessive idea, an illusion, nothing. During the same visit in Paris, the author observes the hypnosis of his cousin, who the next day becomes subject to a foreign will in an example of post-hypnotic suggestion. This insertion of a will into another person will be</page><page sequence="5">958 FRENCH REVIEW recalled, in a somewhat heavy-handed manner, by the author in regard to his own loss of will, which starts immediately after his return from Paris. This loss of will is accompanied by the insertion of what is apparently a foreign will: "Puis, tout d'un coup, il faut, il faut, il faut que j'aille au fond de mon jardin cueillir des fraises et les manger. Et j'y vais. Je cueille des fraises et je les mange" (p. 38). The same ambiguity that was suggested in the other master/slave relationships recurs in this passage. The author has already conducted his own experiments with water, milk, wine, and strawberries, which have indicated that the invisible being does not like strawberries (and for that matter wine, which suggests either that it is quite temperate or frightfully unpatriotic, anti-French). The article from la Revue du monde scientifique offers further support to the author's findings. Thus it seems at this point that one can validly ask who is writing the journal and who wants to pick the strawberries, who is master and who is slave, or in literary terms, is the author writing the journal or is the journal writing the author, that is to say, is the "imaginary" being telling the author what to write, or is the author writing about the imaginary being? A similar ambiguity arises when the author finally can leave his house in order to go to Rouen: "J'ai senti que j'6tais libre tout a coup et qu'il etait loin. J'ai ordonne d'atteler bien vite et j'ai gagne Rouen. Oh! quelle joie de pouvoir dire a un homme qui obeit: 'Allez a Rouen' " (p. 39). The purpose of the trip, or at least one of the purposes of the trip, is the acquisition of the treatise by Doctor Hermann Herestauss on the unknown inhabitants of the ancient and modern world. The author wants to instruct himself. But the so-called invisible being seems to want to profit from the same instruction, for later that evening the author surprises it reading the treatise. The apparent liberty is but a coincidence of wills. The sentence "Oh! quelle joie de pouvoir dire a un homme qui obeit: 'Allez a Rouen' " can be attributed to the invisible being as well as to the author. The return home, apparently against the will of the author, affirms the presence of the invisible being during the trip. This being, which earlier drank the author's life from his mouth in a dream, performs a second activity concerned also with the mouth: he steals the author's power of speech, and "A la gare" becomes, in a manner which recalls a mirror reflection, "A la maison." This theft of language is similar, literarily "speaking"-and that is exactly what the author is doing when he writes in his journal-to the insertion of a will in a literary personage, who is nothing more than several pages of discourse, whose "life" is written language. At one point in the</page><page sequence="6">MAUPASSANT 959 journal the author actually attributes what he has written about a giant butterfly going from star to star, to the invisible being: "Qu'ai-je donc? C'est lui, lui, le Horla, qui me hante, qui me fait penser ces folies!" (p. 50). The second variation on the mirror theme in the text contains the same ambiguity found in the mirror analogues of the master/slave relationship. Near the beginning of the journal the author describes his dreams in which a nocturnal visitor appears. One of these descriptions offers an example of a structure of reflection: "Je dors-longtemps--deux ou trois heures-puis un reve -non-un cauchemar m'etreint. Je sens bien que je suis couche et que je dors... je le sens et je le vois... et je sens aussi que quelqu'un s'approche de moi, me regarde, me palpe, monte sur mon lit, s'agenouille sur ma poitrine, me prend le cou entre ses mains et serre... serre... de toute sa force pour m'6trangler" (p. 8, my italics). In this dream the author's conscious is divided; while it is sleeping, it can reflect upon itself, see that it is sleeping, know that it is sleeping.5 Part of the conscious is thus in a position analogous to that of the "quelqu'un" which looks at the author, feels him, and tries to strangle him. This process of doubling in the dream is quite similar to the elementary structure of human consciousness, which depends on the ability of the "I" to reflect upon the "I." Man must double himself, in order to think himself, in order to think. In the passage cited above, the dream acts as a mirror. At this point in the journal the author is primarily occupied with his dreams, in which the nocturnal visitor is always intent on doing harm to the author, especially to his throat and mouth. Later in the journal, the harmful intent of the invisible being seems to disappear, or rather it is the author who assumes the destructive role in wanting to seize, strangle, tear apart, and finally burn the so-called parasitical being. The passages in which the author attempts to seize and destroy the Horla are thus reverse images, mirror analogues, of the dreamed intentions of the vampirish "quel-qu'un." The invisible being is now in the place of the author: "Mon fauteuil etait vide, semblait vide; mais je compris qu'il 6tait la, assis a ma place, et qu'il lisait. D'un bond furieux, d'un bond de bite'revoltee, qui va eventrer son dompteur, je traversai ma chambre pour le saisir, pour l'Ftreindre, pour le tuer" (p. 42). As if in a mirror, the fear of the author is reflected by the sThe Conard and the Librairie de France editions of Maupassant's complete works replace je le vois with je le sais. I prefer the older version, as the verb voir suggests a mirror image; the substitution of the verb savoir does not, however, alter the structure of reflection.</page><page sequence="7">960 FRENCH REVIEW supposed fear of the invisible being: "Donc, il s'6tait sauve; il avait eu peur, peur de moi, lui!" (p. 42). In the third variation on the mirror theme there is an actual mirror, but its reflective nature seems to have been altered, at least for the author. The complementary activities, the author's pretending to write and the invisible being's putative reading, the author's and the invisible being's spying on one another, associate the act of writing with the effort to "see" the invisible being, and provide a second mirror image within the scene of the empty mirror: "Donc, je faisais semblant d'6crire, pour le tromper, car il m'6piait lui aussi, et soudain, je sentis, je fus certain qu'il lisait par-dessus mon epaule, qu'il 4tait la frolant mon oreille" (p. 51). Any one of the three readings mentioned at the beginning of this essay can explain the author's not seeing his image in the mirror when he suddenly turns: 1) He is experiencing a phenomenon analogous to that which is supposed to characterize the vision of animals: "Les savants disent que l'oeil de la bate, diff6rent du n~tre, ne distingue point comme le notre... Et mon oeil a moi ne peut distinguer le nouveau venu qui m'opprime" (p. 47). 2) He is completely insane at this point; his faculties of perception are so deranged that he is unable to recognize his own image in a mirror. Likewise, when writing, he does not perceive that the detail: "Et je regardais cela avec des yeux affoles," implies that he must have been able to see at least his eyes in order to know that they were affolds. 3) Maupassant is attributing to the anonymous author an experience similar to one he himself had at times before a mirror.6 I have chosen a fourth interpretation, which is consequent with the remarks about the structure of reflection in the dream. The author is taking a paradox literally. The primary alienation, the doubling necessary for the conscious, founds the conscious on an apparent contradiction, on a play with presence and absence: the "I" must be thinking and thought at the same time, that is, it must be both subject and object, it must be where it is not. This paradox finds a more eloquent statement in the cogito of Jacques Lacan: "I think where I am not, therefore I am where I think not."' Generally speaking, one can say that dualistic thought has adopted two 6Part six of Mr. Lanoux's biography is called "Le rendezvous avec les miroirs." He fails, however, to find a mention of such an incident in Maupassant's life, and is forced to substitute an account of a similar experience by a woman. See page 399. 7 Jacques Lacan, "The Insistence of the Letter in the Unconscious," YFS, XXXVI-XXXVII, 136.</page><page sequence="8">MAUPASSANT 961 solutions to this paradox: 1) That of solipsistic metaphysics (Berkeley is a celebrated proponent of this solution) which denies the "reality" of matter, placing the ontological situs in thought itself. 2) That of positivistic metaphysics (literary historians usually are proponents of this solution) which affirms the priority of "reality" in matter, which is then supposed to determine thought, or which thought is supposed to imitate, depending on whether one stresses the scientific or the poetic point of view. Before rapidly turning to find an empty mirror, the author has been pretending to write. Thus before him at his desk is an empty sheet; the invisible being, about whom the journal is being written, is figuratively "represented" on the empty sheet, and one might assume that when this being "reads" over the author's shoulder, it has an experience similar to the author's. At the moment when the latter does not see himself in the mirror, he is "incarnating" the incorporeal of the "I thinking" and thereby denying the materiality of the "I thought." The solution to the paradox lies in the examination of the categories of dualistic thought, e.g., real/imaginary, object/subject, mind/matter etc., a de-construction of metaphysics, and a re-definition of language. This solution is of course not systematically presented in the text, but there is the suggestion of a knowledge of the problem and an awareness of the nature of literary discourse: "Ce qui me cachait ne paraissait point poss6der de contours nettement arrt6es, mais une sorte de transparence opaque, s'6claircissant peu 'a peu" (p. 52). This opaque transparency which little by little becomes clearer is a rather good description of literary discourse, and of the journal itself. All discourse will have a minimum of opacity, of ambiguity, unless it becomes immediate expression, which would negate the necessity to communicate in the first place. So-called literary discourse has as its function to pose questions without giving answers, or to suspend meaning,8 to be as opaque as possible without losing a very small glimmer of transparency. A discourse which achieves total opacity would be a discourse about nothing (an impossibility which haunted 8 See Roland Barthes, Essais Critiques, page 203: "Qu'est-ce que les choses signifient, qu'est-ce que le monde signifie? Toute litterature est cette question, mais il faut tout de suite ajouter, car c'est ce qui fait sa specialite: c'est cette question moins sa reponse. Aucune litterature au monde n'a jamais repondu a la question qu'elle posait, et c'est ce suspens meme qui l'a toujours constituee en litterature"; page 256: "...l'oeuvre n'est jamais tout a fait insignifiante (mysterieuse ou 'inspiree') ni jamais tout a fait claire; elle est, si l'on veut, du sens suspendu: elle s'offre en effet au lecteur comme un systeme signifiant declare mais se derobe a lui comme objet signifi6."</page><page sequence="9">962 FRENCH REVIEW Mallarme, and the opposite of which, a transparent discourse, has perhaps returned to haunt Robbe-Grillet). The association of the acts of writing and reading with the mirror theme at several points in the text, and the registering of this in a journal which points progressively towards the moment when the Horla and the author will be inseparable, give the story a mirror-like quality in itself. It is not only a story of insanity or of the arrival of the Horla in the world, but a journal about writing a journal, a meta-linguistic metaphor: It becomes impossible to distinguish the "I" written by the author from the "I" of the Horla about which the author is writing. There are even certain historical pretentions, at least if one takes seriously the remarks about the early bards or the comment made by Doctor Parent about "un des plus importants secrets de la nature": "Depuis que l'homme pense, depuis qu'il sait dire et dcrire sa pens6e, il se sent frl56 par un mystere impe6ntrable pour ses sens grossiers et imparfaits, et il tache de suppleer, par l'effort de son intelligence, a l'impuissance de ses organes" (p. 23, my italics). In the tale the mystery which brushes against the author is obviously the Horla, a motivated word (hors and la') which suggests the desire to go beyond, represented by the doubling necessary for human consciousness, and perhaps the otherness of the "I" once it is recorded in writing. Furthermore, it seems that the supplement the author has chosen to use is writing itself. Thus the effort to penetrate the mystery is actually a perpetration of the fault, the lack, indicated by writing or by language. Instead of demystifying, the author is remystifying. It is at this point that the comparison of a journal with a mirror breaks down. The author must be present before a mirror in order to see his own image, and in order for the reader, at an oblique angle, to see this image. A journal, however, reflects not the author's presence, but instead the very opposite, the author's absence. The empty mirror, by reflecting the present author's absence, corrects the false analogy, and suggests one more opposition which deserves to be examined, viz., presence/absence.9 The fourth variation on the mirror theme, the use of a false mirror, a white visiting card in which the cousin, while hypnotized, "sees" the author, is a possible allusion to the journal as a false mirror: "Et je m'assis derriere elle. Il lui plaqa entre les mains une carte de visite en lui disant: 'Ceci est un miroir; que voyez-vous dedans?' -Je vois mon cousin. 9 For a more extensive discussion of the same problem in Rousseau, see Chapter 2, "ce dangereux suppl6ment," of De la Grammatologie.</page><page sequence="10">MAUPASSANT 963 -Que fait-il? -Il se tord la moustache. -Et maintenant? -IH tire de sa poche une photographie. -Quelle est cette photographie? -La sienne. Donc, elle voyait dans cette carte, dans ce carton blanc, comme elle efit vu dans une glace" (pp. 24-25). If we ask ourselves the question: "What do we see in this 'carton blanc' which is the journal?", we might reply with reason: "The cousin, i.e., the author." And if we ask ourselves the question: "What is he doing?", we could reply: "He is writing his journal, i.e., he is creating a kind of 'photograph' of himself." The author, however, cannot accept the paradox. In trying to destroy the Horla, he succeeds only in roasting the servants in his own house, an act which reflects his final solution to the problem which he thinks to be one of a master/slave relationship. He opts for the negation of matter: "I va donc falloir que je me tue, moi!" This is a rather certain way to eliminate the doubling of the conscious. The last scene is a synthesis of the Horla and the author as destroyer. The ambiguity is perfect. The "I" writing the journal has become the "I" written, and one cannot be separated from the other, nor can the Horla be distinguished from the author, nor the "I" thinking from the "I" thought, not the signifid from the signifiant. They must be grasped in the same movement, that of language.
