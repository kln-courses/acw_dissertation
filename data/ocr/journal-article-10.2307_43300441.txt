<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AVADANAS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON TIBETAN DRAMA N.K. Dash Indian thoughts whether orthodox or non-orthodox, lays emphasis on action (karma) and its fruition. In the Buddhist thought, especially, action has an important role to achieve the goal, which is technically called Nirvana. It is the general view that a good action bears a good fruit and a bad action has a bad result A person suffers on account of performing the later, whereas on the other hand, a creature avails the bliss ( ãnanda ) through the former. It was a general practice in the ancient India glorious deeds were narrated before the general public through various stories by the teachers, both men and women,1 to attract their attention towards them. Thus, the Buddhist and Jaina monks and nuns would narrate the stories of the eminent persons who had committed meritorious deeds during their lives in order to encourage the public to perform good deeds. The meritorious deeds of the eminent persons are technically called Avadāna in the Buddhist literature. The Avadāna texts have an important place in the Sanskrit literature. The Avadāna stories are excellent contributions of the Buddhists through Sanskrit language. The term "Avadāna"2 implies the episode "life story" of persons performing heroic or glorious deeds, sometimes religious, leading to glorious achievement in life. The prime theme of these stories elucidate the principle beliefs: "Black deeds bear black fruits and white deeds bear white fruits." The Avadāna represents the karman stories intending to show how the actions are closely related with those of former or future existence. Thus, a regular Avadāna consists of a story of the present, a story of the past, and a moral. The Avadāna may also be called "Jātaka", if a Bodhisattva becomes the hero of the story. The general difference between an Avadāna and a Jātaka is that the former is written in Sanskrit and the latter in Pali. Again, it is important to note that the Jātaka stories are based on the previous births of the Buddha when he was a Bodhisattva "Buddha-aspirant". A Jātaka story has three parts. The first part is called pratyutpanna-vastu, or the present story, the introductory episode. The second part is called the atita-vastu, or the past story; the Jātaka proper. The third part is called samavadhana. This is an identification of the chief characters mentioned with the Buddha and his contemporaries in the previous birth. However an Avadāna means "noteworthy". The Avadāna texts stand with one foot in the Theravãda literature, while the other is in that of the Mahayãna or Bodhisattva story, especially</page><page sequence="2">42 THE TIBET JOURNAL Apadāna stories.3 The earlier works belong entirely to the Theravāda, "The Speech of the Elders", otherwise known as the Hinayana, whilst the later works, (i.e. Apadâna) are Mahayanistic in glorification of the Bodhisattva ideal.4 There are those who think that these two technical terms are synonymous. Like Buddhism, in the Purãnas of the Hinduism, we have large sections (Mãhãtmya, Akhyãna, Upãkhyãna, Kathā) consisting of legends. They are also similar to the Buddhist Avadãna texts. They explain the origin of glorious deeds or rites ( vratas ).5 In Jainism, we also have a large number of works which teach us about the meritorious deeds. Tibetan Drama The cultural history of Tibet may be divided into two separate parts namely, the Pre-Buddhistic and the Buddhistic. According to the Tibetan records, which are mostly composed by the Buddhist writers, Buddhism entered into Tibet during 7th century A.D.6 Before that, there had been an indigenous, somewhat animistic faith known as the "Bon" during the pre-Buddhist tradition in Tibet. S.C. Das suggests that "Bon now signifies the kind of Shamanism which was followed by Tibetans before the introduction of Buddhism and in certain parts still extant; of this there were three stages, namely: brdol-bon, 'khyar-bon and bsgyur-bon."1 Inhabitants of Tibet belonged to different mountaineous tribes of the Trans-Himalaya. Every tribe did possess an inherent knack for dance and music which, were occasionally performed amongst themselves. The Tibetans are not exceptions in that respect. It is presumed that in the pre- Buddhist culture of Tibet, there might have been various dances, music, and songs professed by the Bonpos. After the advent of Buddhism in Tibet the tradition of performing arts (dance, music, songs, painting, etc...) were accepted by the Buddhists. In our present paper an attempt has been made to focus on the influence of the Avadãna stories on Tibetan Drama. Unfortunately the ancient tradition of the Pre-Buddhist performing art through dance and music has now been partially lost in Tibet. No train of culture is however totally wiped out. Some ancient techniques and traits may be traced in the existing pattern of the Buddhist dance, music, and drama performed by the Tibetan monks on monastic occasions. The Tibetan mask dances were in vogue on religious occasions among Tibetans and Bhotias (Indo-Tibetans) of the Himalayan region. They are somewhat similar with the pageants still found among many primitive people, and probably even once current amongst the ancient Greeks and the Egyptians.</page><page sequence="3">THE AVADANAS' INFLUENCE ON TIBETAN DRAMA 43 The Tibetan monks usually enacted the mystery - plays like the dance of the "Red Tiger Devil" whereby the gods, goddesses, and demons are represented in their fearful masks. Some of them deal with sacred dramas illustrating the former births of the Buddha, saints, and tales from the Jätaka and Avadāna stories. Several accounts of the dance drama performed by the Tibetan monks, sometimes accompanied by lay persons, have come down to us through the descriptions of many Euro- peans who had travelled inside Tibet during the last few decades. From their writings it reveals that the Tibetans enact their dramas in the glittering sunshine during the mornings of the festive days, particularly on the last day of the year when a large number of spectators assemble to observe Padma Sambhava day of the Nyingmapa ( rnying-ma pa). The theme of these dramas generate mystic spiritual excitement nurtured by moral ethos or symbolic presentation of particular motifs known to Buddhists. Waddell suggests that "The Lamas, however, as professing Buddhists, could not countenance the taking of life, especially human. So, in incorporating this ancient and highly popular festival within their system, they replaced the human victims by anthropomorphic effigies of doughs, into which were inserted models of the larger organs, and also fluid red pigment to represent blood. This substitution of dough images for living sacrifices of the 'bon' rites is ascribed by tradition to Padmasambhava in the second half of 8th century A.D. And these sacrificial dough - images, of more or less elaborate kinds - now form an essential part of the Lamaist daily service of worship."® Stage pattern It may not be out of context to mention that a Tibetan drama depicts a lyrical theme through the physical gestures of the artist The artist usually represents different characters of a drama by wearing masks. It is, however, not an exception in respect of the Tibetans. In the history of Asian drama, the use of mask had been prevalent from the olden days. Even now it is prevalent in the Far East Asia and in folk dances in India. The Tibetan stage pattern is very similar to the Asian pattern. In the course of performance, however, the music becomes sometimes fast and furious. Troop after troop with different masks' rush on, some beating wooden tambourines, others swelling the din with rattles and bells. Most of them have a grotesque apparel, where the malice of internal beings is well expressed, as they dance to the loud rustic music with strange steps and gesticulations.</page><page sequence="4">44 THE TIBET JOURNAL Participants It is interesting to note that the Pratimoksa rules of the Theravadins in Pali, do not sanction monks and nuns to witness drama, which makes a person allured. But in Tibet, the monks take part in a drama and at times they play the role of women with the aid of a mask. However, the Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns follow the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya. At times the Tibetan monks performed along with the women. Subject matter In Tibet, Ti-med kun-ldan is a popular dance-drama. It contains a very popular story, as told in this manner: Many years ago there was a king who had a son named Ti-med kun-ldan. The king had a jewel named Norbu dgos-'dod dpung-'joms, which could fulfill all a person's wishes. A B rahm ana came from a country whose king was so greedy that his subjects occasionally faced drought, and famine on account of his greediness. The Brahmana requested for the enchanted jewel. As the king was not present, the prince felt compassion for the famine stricken people thus gave the jewel to the Brahmana. This was reported to the king upon his return. The king ordered that the prince be banished from the kingdom, for his actions in the absence of the king. The prince left the kingdom with his wife, Nyi-zla sgron-ma (Madri) and their children (two sons and a daughter). While they were passing the forest, they again came upon a Brahmana, who, begged for the chariot by which they were travelling. The prince gladly offered the chariot to the Brahmana against the wish of his wife. They walked on and soon a beggar appeared, who, prayed for clothes. The prince gave away all his clothes. Afterwards, they took shelter inside a cave in the mountains. Once again, the old Brahmana came and requested for some assistants to serve him. During which time, Madri had gone to collect some roots and fruits in the forest. Meanwhile, the prince gave his two children to assist the old Brahmana. Madri returned from the forest and was shocked to hear the news. The prince could do nothing but console her. Shakra, the king of Gods, pleased with the prince's charity, came in the guise of a Brahmana to closely examine the prince. The Brahmana prayed for a woman to assist him in his daily chores (i.e.: cooking foods, etc.). The prince, after some hesitation, offered his wife. The king of Gods, being so pleased with the deeds of the prince, restored everything to the prince.</page><page sequence="5">THE AVADANAS ' INFLUENCE ON TIBETAN DRAMA 45 Thus, the drama ends in a tone of comedy when the king and the subjects welcome the prince, along with his family, back to the kingdom. Although a typical Tibetan drama, it has similarities with Indian stories which depict the predominance of the fruition of action (karma). Such stories have their base in the Jātaka regarding the merit of the good deed leading to good result in this world and hereafter. In spite of the extreme suffering for the cause of welfare of beings, Dri-med kun ldan achieves the merit for his charity in the end. The similar theme may be found in other dramas like Chos-rgyal nor- bzang, who, suffers separation from his beloved, the fairy Men-drel bzang-mo. On account of the good deeds of the prince, all the perils were driven out and the persons engaged in black hat sorcery were defeated. Thus the dictum "black deeds bear black fruits, and white deeds have white fruits" has had much influence on the dramas in the land of snow. It is the basic postulate which had been carried from India to Tibet whereby it was presented through the performing arts. Similar facts may also be traced in other Tibetan dramas, such as Gro-ba bzang-mo, Rgyal- ba don-grub, etc. Resume /_ The over all sentiment (angirasa) Santa prevailing in the themes of the Tibetan dramas stated above, and the subject matter of some Avadāna stories, tends to establish a person's mental appeasement. It is difficult to be broad-minded with great fear and horror. In order to understand this, it has been dramatized in the mystery dance of Tibetan dramas. As we have marked restlessness prevails in the beginning of the drama, where there is no peace nor calmness. At last Santa prevails by subverting the sentiment of Raudra. It occurs with the arrival of the Buddha on the stage. The main theme of the drama is that one may be a Buddha, whereby, calm and peacefulness dominates. Therefore, the demon's skeleton dance is suddenly converted into a beautiful calm dance. In this way, the Sãnta-rasa captures the mind of the monks. This change of the attitude and aesthetic appreciability prevails in the Tibetan performing arts, only after the advent of Buddhism in Tibet. ENDNOTES 1. Refer; Dash, N.K.: "Education in Ancient South Asia as known from Panini"; Asian Studies, Vol.6, No. 4, pp.1-8. 2. The word avadana is derived from the root do "to move" DP. 1/991, along with the suffix "lyu(t)" and the prefix "ava". According to the</page><page sequence="6">46 THE TIBET JOURNAL Sabdakalpadruma, both avadāna and apadana are identical in sense. (Refer to Sabdakalpadurma Vol.1, Varanasi, 1967, p. 124). Though the word apadāna is derived from the root dai "to purify" along with the suffix "lyu(t)" after "apa", still according to the derivative sense, these two words are identical. Simply the sense is: to make perfect (Refer the Vãcaspatyam, Vol.1, Varanasi, 1969, pp.227 and 427). The Lexigraphical works also admit that both these words under discussion have an identical sense. In his commentary on the Amarkosa, Bhanuji Diksita opines that: kvačit apadanam iti pathah (Refer the Amarkosa, second edition, Bombay, 1897, p.446). In Tibetan, the word "rtogs-brjod" means avadāna. According to S.C. Das the literary sense of the Tibetan word is: "discriminative speech, the utterance of what is fully grasped" or "a common destigatìon for the recital of the events of an ideal life." (Refer S.C. Das, A Tibetan English Dictionary, Delhi, 1983, p.350.) 3. Refer Wintemitz's History of Indian Literature, Vol.2, Calcutta, 1933, p.278. Here Winternitz illustrates: "The word avadāna means a note worthy deed, sometimes in a bad sense, but generally in the good sense of a heroic deed, a feel, with Buddhists a religious or moral feel and then also the story of a noteworthy deed, or feel. Such a feel may consist of the sacrifice of One's own life, but also merely a gift of incense, flowers, ornaments, gold and precious stones, or the erection of sanctuaries (Stūpas, Caityas and so on)." The co-authors of A Dictionary of Indology also admit the above statement of Wintemitz's. According to them avadana, noteworthy deed, a class of Buddhist works in Sanskrit They relate the stories of the past lives of the Buddha or Bodhisattva. The deed described may consist of the sacrifice of one's own life, but may also be merely a gift of flowers, or incense, or the construction of a stūpa or caitya. The general theme in the stories, as a rule, is intended to show that bad deeds produce bad results, and good deeds bear good fruits. The stories are collected in anthologies. Among the more well known anthologies are the Avadãna-sataka, the Avadãna-ka, and the Jatakamila or Aryasura (Refer A Dictionary of Indology, Vol.1, Oxford and IBH Publishing Co., 1983, pp.153-154). 4.
