In a "necessary note" the author states that his novel, dedicated to the memory of his father, was written twenty years ago but could only now be published because of its anti-Salazarist ideas. He also admits that it is a bit of fictionalized autobiography. A father and a son (named Alexandre) function as the protagonists. In 1939, on the eve of war, the son visits his father, who administers a coffee estate on the lush island of Sao Tome, knowing that he is an exile, a maverick in Portuguese society, the black sheep of the family. The son, taken to Portugal for his schooling, along with eleven other young paladins is rewarded with a cruise to the Portuguese colonies for having turned into a right-thinking subaltern of the fascist Mocidade Portuguesa. The cruise gives him the chance to visit Sao Tome and his father for two days, after an absence of seven years. The father uses the time to engage the son in discussions of politics and philosophy. The first discussion takes place on the nearby islet of Quixiba, in sight of an old wreck, symbolic of the Portu- guese empire and also of the father's life. Despite his grim sarcasm, the father succeeds in winning his son over through his sincere, stubborn individualism. The son ac- cepts the theory that the Portuguese are divided between the saudosos who want to revive the past and the deste- rrados, like his father, who must leave their homeland, which has no place and no love for them. The work is less a novel - since it creates no world of its own - than a didactic tale by a well-informed and thus in- formative intellectual, recalling the sparkling essays in dialogue form left by Francisco Manuel de Melo and the not-so- witty ones of earlier Renaissance writers. At the same time, the author's anthropomorphic, dramatized descrip- tions of tropical nature remind one of mannerist art, com- bined with Turner's romantic sea paintings whose repro- ductions the father in the novel collects. What is new is the bitterly mocking tone in which much of the prose is composed, expressing the state of mind of erstwhile true believers, saudosos, who became desterrados but could not help being affected by the wreckage of all Portuguese dreams since 1890. In this respect the book is a social and psychological document. Gerald M. Moser Pennsylvania State University</page></plain_text>
