<plain_text><page sequence="1">The State of Nature and the Evolution of Political Preferences Paul H. Rubin, Emory University Analysis of governmental institutions often proceeds from a hypothetical "state of nature," according to which humans are analyzed as if they once existed as solitary individuals with no rules. Humans have never existed as humans in such an environ- ment but have always been a group-living species. Rules have evolved with humans and were never "created" de novo. Evolved rules have implications for contempo- rary governance. Human groups have always been in conflict, and rules distinguish between group members and outsiders. These rules have proved remarkably flexible. Some rules regulate private conduct of group members. Although the desirability of these rules today is unclear, I argue that a libertarian regime would have been unstable, which may explain why there are few persons with tastes for libertarian governments. This analysis further explains why utility functions contain elements of envy. Rules of property, contract, and hierarchy are well developed and universal among humans. 1.

The notion is of humans with no law or government choos- ing a set of rules. The question asked is, what sort of rules would such individuals choose in this situation? A variant, the "veil of ignorance" is used for normative analysis: the constitutional and other rules of soci- ety should be those that would be chosen by individuals behind such a veil, by those who do not know their own position in the society to be designed. Major examples of this variant include Buchanan and Tullock (1965), Nozick (1974), and Rawls (1971). A related question concerns the primacy of property and government. It is often argued that the state is first and that all property rights exist because the state has allowed them (e.g., Sunstein, 1993, pp. 4-5). In this view, whatever rights people have are "in an important sense a product of law." Obviously, the state of nature is meant as a metaphor, not as a true state- ment of primitive conditions. It has the advantage of providing a "clean" starting point for analysis: what rules and structure would someone start- ing with absolutely no law or government choose? Although the metaphor may be useful for some purposes, it is nonetheless ultimately misleading. The true "original" state of humans is so different from the hypothesized state of nature that arguments proceeding from a presumed state of nature generally cause confusion rather than enlightenment. Similarly, it is not meaningful to consider property as defined only by law; property and law are co-equal, and neither precedes the other. All these state-of-nature arguments imply that humans have more freedom in choosing institutions and rules than they actually do. If real policies are based on such false constructions, then real suffering may ensue. Pipes (1990, p. 125) argues that this fallacy, which he traces to Helvétius, a disciple of Locke, was an important intellectual input into the Russian Revolution - an event that did cause a good deal of misery. The argument that in a state of nature there were no rules is analogous to another fallacious argument common in the social sciences, what has been called the "Standard Social Science Model" (SSSM) (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). In the past (and still, in some circles) it was thought that an individual human was a "tabula rasa," a blank slate, and that humans could learn or be trained in almost any way. Students of human evolution, and in particular evolutionary psychologists, now know that this conception was in itself false and in many respects misleading. There is room for wide, but not unlimited, variation in culture. Similarly, the notion that social</page><page sequence="3">52 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) rules are arbitrary or that such rules can be purely created by reason is false. My analysis is directly based on recent work in primate biology. Ultimately, the argument is grounded in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology as applied to humans.1 Social structure, property rights, and rule-like behavior are older than Homo sapiens, so it is not meaningful to talk about human beings existing solely as individuals in an environment with no political or legal structure. There was never a time when human beings existed with no rules. The simplest and most powerful evidence is from behavior that we observe in common chimpanzees, our nearest relative. To the extent that we share traces of political and rule-ordered behavior with chimpanzees, the biological argument is straightforward that the behavior is by common descent. That is, behavior that is com- mon almost certainly is inherited from a common ancestor, not evolved separately. Specifically, chimps, humans, and ancestral and intermediate species lived in groups internally governed by a set of rules and hierar- chies within those groups; moreover, all engaged in intergroup conflict.2 It is in this sense that we may be sure that no human or close ancestor of any human lived a solitary life. Thus, the argument is that when our ancestors first became human, they already had in place a set of rules. There was never any point in time when humans lived without social rules. As our ancestors became more intelligent and more sophisticated, the rules would have become more complex, but a state in which humans lived without rules would not be defined. The "state of nature" would then necessarily describe the rules that existed when humans first came into being as humans. 1. The original source is Wilson (1975). See also Dawkins (1989). For major works applying biological reasoning to human behavior, see Alexander (1987), Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby (1992), Crawford and Krebs (1997), de Waal (1996), and Wrangham and Peterson (1996). There are numerous applications in economics as well; see for a few examples Hirshleifer (1977), Robson (1995), Rogers (1994), Rubin and Paul (1979), Siow (1998), and Smith (1991), and see the Journal of Bioeconomics. Hayek has also written on evolution of preferences; (e.g., Hayek, 1976). However, his writing was uninformed by more recent advances in evolutionary theory. 2. An exception appears to be the bonobo, the "pygmy chimpanzee." This animal seems to have lost much of the aggressiveness of other chimpanzees. However, behavior indicates that the species still has some aggressive characteristics, and that the ancestral species was very similar to common chimpanzees. See Wrangham and Peterson (1996).</page><page sequence="4">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 53 In the next section, I briefly discuss natural selection and the evolu- tionary environment. 2. The Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA) To understand the applicable evolutionary theory, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of the environment in which humans evolved (Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby, 1992; Crawford, 1997). The relevant time period is the Pleistocene, the period lasting from three million to about 10,000 years before the present, when farming began (Diamond, 1998). It is during this period that humans evolved from a rather ape-like creature to become modern humans. There would have been selection pressure for behaviors and preferences that would have led to reproductive success in that environment, and modern humans retain those preferences and behaviors: it is generally believed that the time since farming has been too short to have caused significant evolutionary changes in behavior. There are some general points regarding natural selection that are rele- vant to economic rules. First, evolution selects for fitness - propagation of genes into the future. Economists assume maximization of utility; utility may be directly related to fitness. We "enjoy" those things that caused our ancestors to survive and leave more offspring. Second, natural selection is itself a great economizer. It will use whatever mechanisms are easiest and most readily available. For example, incest is biologically undesir- able because children of incestuous relationships are less fit. If individu- als raised together are generally siblings, then there is no need to evolve a method that siblings can use to recognize each other in order to avoid sexual relations. Rather, humans have evolved to avoid sexual relations with those with whom they were raised. While this mechanism is not per- fect (sometimes unrelated individuals will be raised together, and some- times siblings will be raised apart), it was relatively easy to evolve, and good enough to work. We will see similar mechanisms in other aspects of behavior. Society in the EEA consisted of relatively small bands of individu- als, (probably 50-200 beings) many of whom would have been genet- ically related. By the late Pleistocene, bands were probably aggregated into socially significant tribes of up to a few thousand. Ancestral hominid</page><page sequence="5">54 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) bands made their living by hunting and gathering, with the role of hunt- ing probably increasing over time. Indeed, it was probably the additional protein available from meat that enabled humans to bear the high ener- getic costs of our large brains and thus led to the increase in intelligence of humans relative to all other species (Aiello and Wheeler, 1995). Males engaged in hunting, often cooperative hunting, and females in gathering. Sexual division of labor among humans is an evolutionarily old char- acteristic, probably antedating humanness (Geary, 1998; Silverman and Phillips, 1998). It is universal among humans (Brown, 1991), although it does not occur among other apes. The most remarkable feature of humans is our level of intelligence. It is sufficiently high as to be qualitatively different from that of any other species. Evolution of this level of intelligence is an extremely improbable event in biology; it has occurred only one time in all the billions of years of evolution of life on Earth (Mayr, 1988). A key point for understanding the evolution of human behavior and intelligence is that conflict has long been an important part of hominid behavior. Chimps and humans are the only primate species in which male kin groups are important (Foley, 1995; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996). This means that male bonding within the group is more significant than it is for other primates. It also means that conflict between male kin groups is more common. Chimpanzees and humans, because of their male kin bonding system, engage in more inter- group competition than other apes (Foley, 1995). Current thinking among many biologists is that the only force strong enough to provide sufficient selection pressure to lead to the observed level of human intelligence would have been competition from other hominids.3 Thus, to understand the state of nature we must replace the Hobbesian world of individuals in conflict with a world of groups in conflict. This difference in perspective has profound implications for the nature of the evolution of rules. A world of individuals and conflict between individuals is truly Hobbesian; there would initially be no rules, and the world would be one of each for himself. Any subsequent rules would be created by 3. This argument was first made by Humphrey (1976). An important authority who has made this point in numerous publications is Richard Alexander; see, for example, Alexander (1987). Similar arguments are in Byrne and Whiten (1988) and Whiten and Byrne (1997) and, from an economic standpoint, Robson (1995). Dunbar (1996) also argues for a social origin of intelligence.</page><page sequence="6">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 55 these individuals to reduce conflict. In a world of groups, and conflicts between groups, there would be pre-existing evolved but noncreated rules governing behavior within the group. Those groups that utilized the best rules would be the most successful at competing with neighboring groups and would therefore expand their share of the population. Thus, rules governing social actions of individuals would have come into being along with humans themselves. It is not meaningful to ask what rules humans in a totally ruleless state would choose. Such a world has never existed and in principle cannot exist. Since groups were so important, we must first examine the nature of group membership in the EEA. We then examine the nature of the rules governing behavior within theses groups. We may identify two types of rule that would be relevant: those controlling behavior of a single indi- vidual within a group, and those controlling behavior between individuals within a group. It is likely that humans have a predisposition to accept rules governing certain types of behaviors, and perhaps certain specific forms of rules.4 We seem to learn some types of rules and behaviors too easily for there to be no biological mechanism underlying this learning.5 For example, Israeli kibbutzim attempted to impose a rule that all children would be raised in common with no special attention from biological par- ents, but humans (even dedicated and committed ones) seemed unable to "learn" this rule, in that parents continued to want to spend time with their own children (Shepher, 1971.) There is a large literature discussing interactions between genetic and cultural evolution; an important source is Boyd and Richerson (1985). An important lesson from this literature is that cultural and genetic evolution can reinforce each other. For example, if the ability to learn some behavior (such as obedience to a particular type of rule) leads to increased fitness, then there might be selection pres- sure for just this ability. Those able to learn the rule most easily would be more successful (have more offspring) and so the ability could become genetic. 4. Tesser (1993), among others, indicates that political attitudes are heritable, a requirement for such attitudes to have been selected through evolution. 5. By analogy, the ability to learn language and the deep structure of language is clearly innate; see, for example, Pinker and Bloom (1992). Much of Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby (1992) is devoted to a discussion of various innate rules.</page><page sequence="7">56 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) The argument of this paper assumes that individuals were selected to desire rules that increased their chances of leaving offspring in the EEA. Rules of behavior may be explained, therefore, in terms of maximizing the probability that the group using them would survive in a conflict with other groups.6 The fundamental conflict within groups is between behavior enhancing individual fitness and that favoring the group. One can think of numerous behaviors that would lead to increased probability of survival of the group at the expense of the individual, and conversely; prisoner's dilemmas are everywhere. I discuss some of these conflicts below. I begin by discussing factors determining who is a group member. 3. Group Membership A key distinction is between members of the group and outsiders. All humans make this distinction (Brown, 1991, p. 136). Indeed, even infants distinguish between group members and nonmembers. Among infants, males make this distinction more strongly than females. Moreover, although common physical appearance makes identifying group members easier for infants, it is not necessary (Premack and Premack, 1994). All humans also recognize subgroups based on kinship, sex, and age (Brown, 1991, p. 137). Krebs and Denton (1997) discuss some of the perceptual features of group membership. They indicate that humans quickly clas- sify people as members or nonmembers of the ingroup. Members and nonmembers are treated differently: all nonmembers are viewed as being alike and as being enemies, whereas members are treated as individuals. Although humans distinguish between members and nonmembers, group-affiliation mechanisms seem quite flexible. For example, in one experiment, when students were randomly assigned to a group they imme- diately identified with this group, even though they knew that the basis for assignment was random (Krebs and Denton). Mullen, Brown, and Smith (1992) discuss a large number of studies from social psychology on the importance of "ingroup bias"; see also Tajfel (1970) on the power of arbitrary of group loyalties. Rubin and Somanathan (1998) discuss the 6. This does not imply group selection, although it is not inconsistent with the possibility of group selection. The importance of group selection in human evolution is a hotly debated topic within biology; see Sober and Wilson (1998).</page><page sequence="8">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 57 implications of this flexibility for employee productivity, and argue that Becker's "discrimination coefficients" are weak among humans. Kuran (1998) shows that strength of ethnic identification is variable and can shift quickly. Sober and Wilson (1998, p. 92) define a group in biological or fitness terms: "A group is defined as a set of individuals that influence each other's fitness with respect to a certain trait but not the fitness of those outside the group." This definition is consistent with individuals' belonging simultaneously to more than one group, with different groups associated with different traits. In the EEA, members of the group often would have been relatives, so kin selection would have been important. Moreover, all those living in the same community would have been members of the same group and, therefore, would have been allies in conflicts with other groups. This may be why humans seem to have evolved to be quite flexible in their group preferences. If everyone nearby had been a relative or associate, then there would have been no need for a mechanism distinguishing kin or allies from others. This argument is analogous to the argument regard- ing incest. In a conflict with a neighboring group, all members of one's group could be viewed as friends. Sober and Wilson (1998) argue that there are additional general group membership mechanisms. Crawford (1991) suggests that kin recognition mechanisms may have operated in any of several ways: geographic, treating nearby individuals as kin; treat- ing frequent associates as kin; treating individuals physically similar to oneself as kin; and treating individuals with particular "genetic markers" as kin. Shaw and Wong (1989) suggest that group markers include lan- guage, religion, phenotype (that is, body type and appearance), homeland, and myth of common descent. Group identification is stronger as more of these markers are congruent. They argue that patriotism can conflict with group or ethnic identity if these markers are more congruent within an ethnic group than within a country.7 Because they are concerned with war, however, they seem to have missed or ignored other nongovernmental 7. They also suggest that in the United States patriotic identification is strong because, since American citizens are descended from immigrants, there is little eth- nic group identification to compete with patriotism, whereas they indicate that in the (then) U.S.S.R. patriotism was generally weak because there was strong ethnic group competition. Subsequent events seem to have proved them correct, at least with respect to the U.S.S.R.</page><page sequence="9">58 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) potentials for group loyalty and identification. Hirshleifer (1998) also dis- cusses the rule of group identification in war. In addition to this experimental evidence, the types of individuals with whom modern humans feel solidarity show the flexibility of whatever mechanism is involved. Groups include actual kin or ethnic groups but also members of the same religious group, citizens of the same country or (with respect at least to sports events) the same city, members of the same occupation, employees of the same company or division within a company (or department within a university), members of the same gender, and numerous other groups. The key distinction is between rules involving individuals in the same group and rules involving outsiders; all humans make this distinction. Religion can define members of the relevant group. All human groups have some religious beliefs (Brown, 1991, p. 139; Burkert, 1996). In one major survey of beliefs, 77% of the respondents indicated that they believed in God, and in no country did fewer than 36% believe in God (Inglehart, Basañez, and Moreno, 1998).8 I discuss below individual ben- efits from such belief. It is likely that religions were originally tribal, making co-religionists members of the same ethnic and kin group. How- ever, the major successful religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism) seem to have overcome this ethnic basis and to have grown by inducing indi- viduals to accept unrelated co-religionists as members of the same group. Although many wars have been fought over religious differences, I conjec- ture that the inclusiveness of the modern major religions has net reduced warfare by implicitly expanding the size of groups. Keeley (1996) does indicate that rates of death from war in primitive societies are much higher than in modern societies.9 That the human group membership mechanism is so flexible is a major biological characteristic of humans. It is easy to conceive of humans as 8. This survey, for 1990-1993, was conducted in 43 countries. 9. Other roles for religion in the EEA are discussed below. I do not examine the original basis for religious belief. However, Guthrie (1993) argues persuasively that it is due to a general human tendency for anthropomorphism, the tendency to attribute "human characteristics to nonhuman things or events" (p. 3). Guthrie explains this tendency in cost-benefit terms: it is more expensive to falsely ignore human agency than to falsely impute human agency to nonhuman causes.</page><page sequence="10">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 59 existing without this characteristic. That is, as a species humans might have been as intelligent as the actual human species but much more con- strained in group flexibility. Such a species would live in small kin-based groups. This social structure would eliminate many of the benefits of the large agglomerations in which humans actually live. For example, the ben- efits of the massive division of labor in modern societies would not exist. I believe that this flexibility of group membership is an important bio- logical fact that is ignored because it is taken for granted. Ridley (1997, pp. 168-69) makes the point that we could conceive of humans as being less tribal and living in more open societies; the extent of our identifica- tion with the group is a variable. The point here is the opposite: we could also be more "groupish" (Ridley's term) than we actually are. Richerson and Boyd (1999) suggest that Neanderthals may not have been able to form tribal groups as large as those of modern humans, since population density for these individuals was much less than for modern humans. For modern humans, group identity is relatively open biologically, although identity may be constrained by social institutions. We could easily be less open and more racist and tribal than we in fact are. If we were more tribal, then countries such as the Roman Empire and the contemporary U.S. could not exist. It may be that at one time our ancestors were more xenophobic but that as the benefits (successful prédation and avoiding being victims of prédation) of larger groups increased, there was evolu- tionary pressure towards more openness. Moreover, group identity is hierarchical. At any given time, we belong to more than one group. All humans live in families, but all view them- selves as members of larger groups as well (Brown, 1991, p. 136). We may be a member of Group Aj that is itself a subset of Group Bx. For some purposes, Ax and A2 may be in conflict. However, if Bj is chal- lenged by B2, then loyalties may shift to Bj and members of and A2 may begin cooperating. Again, this flexibility is not a necessary part of human identity, and we could conceive of a species like us in many dimen- sions but lacking this flexibility. Without it, however, the large societies in which we now live would be impossible. It is often asserted that humans are by nature xenophobic and hostile to outsiders (e.g., Shaw and Wong, 1989.) Of course, some humans do behave in this way. The level of such hostility is facultative - a behavior that can change in response to different environments, including cultural</page><page sequence="11">60 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) environments. The point is that in fact our group-membership selection mechanisms are actually quite flexible and it would be easy to think of humans as being much more clannish and xenophobic than we are. If we were, then we would live in a very different world but would still be recognizably human. This flexibility would have had advantages in terms of competition with other groups. Abilities to switch membership from one group to another would have meant that a member of a losing group would be able to join another group, rather than being killed or dying of starva- tion. Keeley (1996) points out that in primitive warfare captured men are almost always killed, though females may be incorporated into the victo- rious group. He also indicates that many tribes have been eliminated, with survivors joining other tribes or groups. Thus, individuals with such flexi- ble membership mechanisms would have been more likely to survive and reproduce. Similarly, Sober and Wilson (1998) indicate that it is common for unsuccessful groups or tribes to dissolve and for the members to join more successful groups. The ability to join groups arranged hierarchically would have been useful in a conflict situation. Through evolutionary time, one force would have been increasing size of groups. If one set of hominids were able to coalesce into a larger group made up from several subgroups, then survival would be enhanced if rival groups could do the same. Alexander (1987) indicates that these "balance of power" considerations could lead to any size society, although Diamond (1998) indicates that the major increase in group size occurred as a result of fanning. This is consistent with Alexander's arguments: defense and prédation created a demand for or value of larger groups, but this demand could not be met until agriculture enabled larger groups to feed themselves. The size of the group could be determined by factors studied in the theory of clubs (Buchanan, 1965; Sandler, 1992.) Benefits of larger group size would have come from increased ability either to avoid being victimized by prédation from others or to successfully predate against others. Costs would have been increased difficulty in obtaining food as group size increased in a foraging economy. Then as the form of the economy shifted towards agriculture, costs would have decreased, leading to progressively larger group size.</page><page sequence="12">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 61 4. Rules Governing Individuals: The Instability of Libertarianism A default legal regime might be libertarian - a regime that interfered minimally with individual freedom. Nozick (1974) is a modern advocate of such a government. Libertarianism is a useful starting point: libertar- ian beliefs appeal in a normative sense to many economists (including the author). In a libertarian regime, government would protect property rights and provide true public goods but would do nothing else. A purely selfish rational person would desire such a regime. Since all legal and political systems go beyond this level, and since cit- izens generally seem to prefer that government does go beyond the mini- mal level, we have something of a puzzle. As a positive matter, it appears that there have been few if any libertarian governments. The argument presented here is that libertarianism as a strategy in the EEA would not have been viable.10 As a result, individuals with libertarian preferences (who would have established a libertarian order) would have been less successful than individuals with other preferences, so those with libertar- ian preferences would have left fewer descendants, meaning such prefer- ences would have been selected against. In other words, establishment of a libertarian set of rules would not have been an evolutionarily stable strat- egy (ESS) for a group, so individuals with preferences for such a society would have been reproductively unsuccessful, although such preferences would not have been completely eliminated. This would then explain why few today desire such a government. A libertarian regime would be subject to attack both from within and without the group. Surviving humans would therefore have developed defenses to such attacks. These defenses would have taken the form of preferences that made libertarianism difficult or impossible. What is inter- esting is that these defensive behaviors and preferences generate behaviors that still exist. I discuss them with respect to each source of attack. I then discuss the issue of whether or not libertarianism would be viable under today's conditions. 10. This does not imply that there were formal governments in the EEA. The point is that preferences for nonintervention in others' lives would have been selected against.</page><page sequence="13">62 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) 4.1. Instability of Libertarianism: Attack from within the Group A male maximizes fitness by having the largest possible number of mates, because this increases reproductive potential. Under libertarian institutions, some males would have been more successful than others. Most societies have been polygynous, and some men, despots in decid- edly nonlibertarian societies, have fathered amazingly large numbers of children (Betzig, 1986). However, since the number of males and females is approximately equal, polygyny for some means sexual abstinence and lack of reproductive success for others, generating social conflict. The most successful modern societies have been those that outlawed polygyny (at least in its most extreme forms) and thus reduced the internal level of conflict. Religion may have played a part in establishing monogamy (see Alexander, 1987, p. 71; MacDonald, 1995). In a world of polygyny, the more successful males would have had a disproportionate number of wives, and some other males would therefore have left no genes in the surviving gene pool. It is in this sense that lib- ertarianism could be invaded from within. Assume there are four types of males: dominant and nondominant, libertarian and nonlibertarian. Domi- nant males in a libertarian regime (whether they themselves were liber- tarian or not) would have left a large share of genes, but unsuccessful males would have left fewer genes or none at all. Those unsuccessful males favoring a libertarian society would have allowed some males to become much more successful and acquire a disproportionate share of females, leaving some nondominant males with no mates. This would have reduced the number of genes of the tolerant (libertarian) nondom- inant individuals from future generations, so the genes of nondominant libertarian individuals would have decreased in the pool. Dominant males might have been libertarian or not. But nonlibertar- ian dominants would have been able to benefit more from their domi- nant positions because, as non-libertarians, they would have been more willing to exploit their advantage over subordinate males. Thus, among dominants, nonlibertarians would have left more genes in the gene pool than would have libertarians. Therefore, the number of libertarians among both dominants and nondominants would have decreased over evolution- ary time, meaning that today relatively few individuals would have liber- tarian preferences.</page><page sequence="14">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 63 The counter to this form of libertarianism would have been some sort of egalitarianism imposed by subordinate males. Such egalitarianism is common among groups studied by anthropologists (Boehm, 1997, 1999; Knauft, 1991; see also Sober and Wilson, 1998, chapter 5). Indeed, Boehm refers to a "reverse dominance hierarchy," meaning that subordinate males form a coalition and limit the power of those who would be dominant. Members of egalitarian groups do not allow individuals to become exces- sively dominant. An effect of this behavior is that the otherwise domi- nant individuals will not engross excessively many females, so the genes of the nondominants would be able to survive. We are descended from such individuals, and Boehm (1997) argues that the long period of time in which egalitarianism was a basic human behavior would have had an effect on our genetic makeup. An alternative might have been to outlaw polygyny. However, in the EEA (and even today, in societies that have engaged in major wars) this would have meant that some fertile women would not mate and have offspring, thus reducing the size of the group and its ability to defend itself. One input in creating this egalitarianism is a lack of privacy, discussed by Sober and Wilson (1998, pp. 176-177). This is also the focus in Epstein (1980), Hirshleifer (1980), and Posner (1980). Egalitarianism for the purpose of reducing the wealth of the most successful must be distinguished from egalitarianism for the purpose of redistribution to the poor. It appears that societies go through a transition. Primitive societies and modern mass societies are relatively egalitarian; intermediate soci- eties, associated with monarchies and other forms of despotism, are often highly nonegalitarian, and dominant males in such societies may have significantly more offspring than the average. Such societies are associ- ated with the rise of agriculture and the increasing population density that agriculture makes possible (see Diamond, 1998). The period of time when such societies existed was probably too short to have left a major impression in the gene pool; the primitive egalitarian phase lasted much longer, and we evolved to favor such egalitarianism. In modern societies, monogamy seems to be necessary but not sufficient for democracy. Under contemporary conditions, nondespotic and monogamous societies seem to</page><page sequence="15">64 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) be the most successful, and nonmonogamous societies seem to continue as despotisms.11 In modern society, this egalitarian behavior persists in several ways. First, and most directly, most modern societies forbid polygyny. This reduces the ability of dominant males to acquire additional mates at the expense of less dominant males. Alexander (1987) suggests that the imposition of monogamy was a very important social innovation, lead- ing to increased stability in society because polygyny creates a group of dissatisfied males. Second, until relatively recently, divorce was diffi- cult. In a regime with easy divorce, successful males often practice serial monogamy, marrying more than one woman over time and perhaps hav- ing children from each.12 Again, less dominant males would have lost from this practice, and would therefore have favored a ban on divorce. Perhaps the recent changes in laws regarding divorce are due to the increase in tolerance of homosexuality (which is more common among men than women), which has reduced the social costs and tensions asso- ciated with excess unmarried males. It may also be that reduced mortality from childbirth has led to a net surplus of marriageable females.13 Siow (1998) discusses some implications of differential male and female fecun- dity. One implication of his analysis is that in a system where divorce and remarriage are allowed, poor men (men who are unlucky in the labor market) will never marry. Such men would be better off in a system with no divorce. The other strategy remaining from the past is direct egalitarianism. Important political pressures in contemporary society seem ideologically motivated towards government interference and redistribution, even when such redistribution is inefficient and expensive. In a world survey, 54% of respondents agree that wealth can grow, but the rest believe that in 11. For example, Muslim societies, which are religiously polygynous, also seem less democratic than others. For a discussion of the nondemocratic nature of govern- ment in Arab societies, which does not discuss polygyny, see Crossette (1998). La Porta et al. (1999) also find that Muslim countries are "sharply less democratic" than others. 12. The modern term "trophy wife" refers to an older man married to a younger woman, generally a second or third marriage for the man. The taste for such a marriage makes perfect evolutionary sense. 13. These are alternative explanations to Becker and Murphy's (1988) idea that divorce became easier as families began having fewer children.</page><page sequence="16">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 65 some degree wealth accumulation is at the expense of others (Inglehart, Basañez, and Moreno 1998). Some policies (e.g., excessive marginal tax rates) have the effect of harming the rich without generating any eco- nomic benefits to others. Roe (1998) presents examples of policies that result in net economic harms for everyone is society. Although economists explain some of this pressure in terms of rent seeking, there seems to be a large ideological component as well (e.g., Kau and Rubin, 1979). Thus, the tendency of governments to intervene in the economy in seemingly counterproductive and often inexplicable ways may be a response to tastes evolved to reduce the extent of genetic inequality in evolutionary environ- ments. Envy of successful individuals and efforts to reduce the wealth of such individuals would also be consistent with this egalitarian set of pref- erences. In addition to monogamy, Alexander (1987) lists the graduated income tax (p. 69), women's suffrage, affirmative action for minorities, and assistance to the handicapped (p. 185) as modern policies aimed at maintaining social cohesion. Sober and Wilson (1998) indicate that poli- cies aimed at maintaining group unity have been important in human evolution, and that virtually all societies have intervened in nonlibertarian ways in human behavior. This is an area of behavior in which normal utility or wealth maxi- mization may conflict with fitness maximization. If an individual is highly productive and creates much wealth, then normally there will be social as well as private benefits; a productive individual normally will not absorb the entire surplus he will create (Posner, 1979). Thus, utility or wealth maximization would imply that all benefit from such increased productiv- ity and should encourage it. However, if the added productivity is used to engross additional females, or if tastes evolved in an environment where this occurred, then in fact others will become less fit, although wealth- ier. In this sense, fitness and utility maximization conflict. This may explain why many utility functions seem to contain elements of envy, even though envy is counterproductive with respect to consumption or wealth maximization. 4.2. Instability of Libertarianism: Attack from outside the Group The other source of instability of libertarianism would have been from outside the group. A libertarian group would have had difficulty defend-</page><page sequence="17">66 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) ing itself. Many noneconomic behaviors that are currently forbidden or intensely regulated would have reduced the ability of groups to defend themselves from attack, and it is possible that tastes evolved to forbid these and similar behaviors because those without such tastes would have been less fit. The egalitarian impulses discussed above are today asso- ciated with political "liberalism," while the noneconomic regulations of consumption are more generally associated with "conservatism." It may be that liberals (egalitarians) are selected from the more cooperative or altruistic members of society, and conservatives from the less altruistic. This is a proposition that could be tested using experimental methods. Most or all societies interfere paternalistically in individuals' private behavior, in the name of morality. Often this interference is associated with religious beliefs, but not always. Some examples: prohibitions or lim- itations on use of drugs (including alcohol), or instead control of such use through ritualization; interference with and regulation of marriage rela- tionships, as discussed above; restrictions dealing with sexual behavior, including homosexual relationships, relationships with prostitutes, mas- turbation, and pornography; restrictions on abortion; and constraints on gambling. That such limitations and restrictions are so common means either that there is an innate taste for such interference, or that at the least it is quite easy for humans to learn to favor such restrictions on the behavior of others. Bischof (1978, p. 50) indicates that "rules of mod- eration, asceticism, abstinence" are universal. Similarly, Campbell (1978, pp. 79-80) suggests that "stinginess, greed, gluttony, envy, self-serving dishonesty, theft, lust, promiscuity, pride, and anger may be universally proscribed." Inglehart et al. 1998 indicate that 84% of respondents believe that use of marijuana or hashish is "never justified" ; for prostitution, 61%; for homosexuality, 59%; and for abortion, 29%. 14 None of these authors suggests why those behaviors that appear to have no external effects are viewed negatively by those who are unaffected. Indeed, the discussions do not distinguish between behaviors with and without external effects. The suggestion here is that such behaviors would have weakened the group in competition with other groups. 14. For the U.S. the percentages believing practices are "never justified" are marijuana, 74%; prostitution, 61%; homosexuality, 57%; and abortion, 35%.</page><page sequence="18">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 67 Economists in general, and particularly those with a libertarian bent, are often puzzled by such rules.15 Why is it in society's interest to interfere with private behavior that has no external effects? This entire set of con- trols is inconsistent with a regime of individual autonomy, and is an appar- ently unjustified interference with free markets. Moreover, to the extent that the interferences create illegal markets that themselves have negative externalities, as is true of illegal drugs today and of alcohol during Prohi- bition, they are particularly difficult to understand. Economists distinguish between public goods and private goods. But the items discussed above are neither (in any conventional sense). That is, my concern that you do not use drugs is neither a private nor a public good. (Of course, in a triv- ial sense, we could define "living in a drug free society" as a public good, but this is stretching the terminology.) Thus, an entire class of behaviors is excluded from conventional economic analysis.16 It is my contention here that all of these rules can be explained as enhancing group survival in an environment in which there are struggles and combat between competing groups. In this context it is important to note that young males are extremely important in defense, since they now and traditionally have made up the warriors. Young males are also disproportionately risk takers for evolutionary reasons (Rubin and Paul, 1979), so they would be expected to engage in the forbidden behaviors if allowed. That is, young males would sometimes undertake risky behaviors that would increase their own status if successful, even if failure would lead to their elimination from the group (perhaps through death). Many of the prohibited behaviors have this characteristic. For example, gambling, if successful, would lead to an increase in wealth and status; if unsuccessful in a subsistence environment, gambling could lead to starvation. Consumption of products such as alcohol and drugs can also be a form of status competition. Biologists discuss the "handicap principle" (Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997), which says that individ- uals will sometimes assume a voluntary handicap in order to demonstrate that, even with the handicap, they are still strong enough to function well. 15. I have myself been puzzled, and find the rules undesirable. 16. An exception is Sen (1970), who does discuss such goods. However, his proof of an impossibility theorem involving such goods has had relatively little impact on economics - certainly less impact than Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.</page><page sequence="19">68 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) The consumption of harmful products could be a form of handicap, and males often compete by demonstrating that they can remain functional and dominant even when intoxicated. From a social point of view, this form of competition, which reduces the ability of the group to defend itself, would be harmful. Such behaviors, while privately fitness maxi- mizing, would be detrimental to the group, which would care only about the number of young males, not about their relative statuses. Therefore, preferences to control such behavior may have evolved. No society (that has survived) has encouraged rules that would serve to weaken ability to fight. For example, no society encourages physical weakness or cowardice among young males. Other restrictions may simply be associated with population size, and thus the ability of a society to defend itself. These would include many restrictions on sexual behavior (e.g., homosexuality) and restrictions on abortion. Again, societies that regulated such behaviors might have been better able to defend themselves, and so preferences for regulating these behaviors may have evolved. Interestingly, many of these prohibitions and restrictions are associated with religion and a belief in the supernatural; this belief is itself a puzzle to many since these beliefs are nontestable. However, the same argument that explains the moral restrictions can also explain religion. If a society adopting such restrictions is more powerful and successful than one that does not, then mechanisms to increase the probability of such adoption will be selected for. If there is no rational private reason for an individ- ual to refrain from certain behaviors, and potential gains in utility from engaging in them, then a society or tribe (or species) in which individuals can be led to believe in a supernatural benefit from avoiding undesirable behavior will thrive relative to one lacking such a mechanism. In other words, religion can solve the prisoner's dilemma: Don't drug yourself or drink yourself senseless, or abort your child, or else you will go to hell, a private cost. This belief will avoid the social cost of losing the next battle to the guys in the next valley who do have such prohibitions and who will otherwise exterminate us. A society with beliefs and taboos of this sort could defeat one without them, so there is, precisely, selection pressure for such beliefs. Cooperation through avoidance of behavior that weak- ens the group becomes a rational strategy if one believes that defection will have long (very: eternally long) run costs. Burkert (1996) discusses</page><page sequence="20">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 69 religion in similar terms, although he does not fully elucidate the role of religion in solving prisoner's dilemmas. Diamond (1998) discusses the role of religion in motivating warriors. On the other hand, for any individual, there is a payoff in not shar- ing such beliefs. This is one of the prisoner's dilemmas mentioned above. However, several authorities have recently shown that if individ- uals in a society are willing to punish noncooperators and those who fail to punish noncooperators, then cooperation can evolve in a society, although inefficient behaviors can also evolve under these circumstances (Axelrod, 1997; Boyd and Richerson, 1992; Hirshleifer, 1999; Hirshleifer and Martinez-Coll, 1988).17 These models can explain human willingness to obey rules. If some individuals believe in the tenets of a religion and are willing to punish nonbelievers, then all can be made to behave as if they are believers. Sober and Wilson (1998) indicate that these rules of punishment have traditionally been used to enforce group cohesiveness. They indicate that enforcement of such rules traditionally has been rela- tively low cost, as social ostracism has been available as an enforcement device. In today's more anonymous society, enforcement may have much greater costs. I now discuss this issue. 4.3. Is Libertarianism Viable Today? The argument to this point can explain why most people living today have nonlibertarian preferences. However, these tastes presumably evolved in the EEA, and it is possible that conditions have changed sufficiently so that a libertarian society would be more viable today than under evo- lutionary conditions.18 I now explore this possibility. It appears that the benefits of interventionist preferences may have decreased and the costs of enforcing these preferences may have increased, so that, even if these preferences were fitness maximizing in the EEA, they may no longer be so today. First consider defense. Would others conquer a libertarian society under today's conditions? In the Vietnam War, it was widely reported that many 17. These models are based on individual selection, and can lead to group-like effects without postulating group selection. 18. There are other evolved tastes that were useful in the EEA but not currently. For example, humans desire too much fat and sugar in their diets, presumably because in the EEA these foods would have been valuable for the calories they contain.</page><page sequence="21">70 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) soldiers used drugs, and the United States lost that war, consistent with an argument that there may still be costs to such behavior.19 On the other hand, the Gulf War and the Kosovo war were much more capital intensive (perhaps because of the lack of a military draft and the corresponding inef- ficiently low price of personnel) and were fought largely through advanced technology. Thus, combat behavior of individual soldiers was less impor- tant, and this may be true of future U.S. wars as well. Increasing capital intensity of warfare suggests that the military basis for some nonlibertar- ian preferences no longer applies, at least for the U.S., although Browne (1999) argues that the Gulf War was atypical and that human strength and endurance will be important in future wars. For other smaller coun- tries fighting, for example, border wars with neighbors, manpower may still be an important factor for military success. Such countries might find restrictions on behavior desirable in order to increase the number and effectiveness of their soldiers. Thus, those restrictions on behavior that were apparently aimed at cre- ating military power or increasing the fighting ability of young men might serve no useful purpose in today's world, at least in the U.S. Costs of sat- isfying nonlibertarian preferences are not trivial or peripheral; significant amounts of resources are spent on them, and some of these policies have large social costs in terms of disruption. Abortion is a major political issue in America today, even though most of the participants in the debate would not likely be directly affected themselves.20 The debate over this issue is socially costly. Other apparently strong moralistic preferences include the effort to prohibit consumption of alcohol and the "war on drugs." Large amounts of wealth and of political capital have been spent on such issues. In addition to the direct cost of these efforts, there have been large indirect costs in terms of the additional crime generated by the policies. The second benefit of nonlibertarian preferences is the possibility of increased social stability, which would have been associated with survival in a competitive environment such as the EEA. There are two intervention- ist policies generating such stability. First is the outlawing of polygyny. 19. However, it is generally claimed that drugs were not used during combat (see, e.g., Appy, 1993, pp. 283-84). 20. Those opposed can simply avoid having an abortion. Many of the strong pro- ponents are relatively wealthy, and would be able to obtain an abortion even if it were made more difficult.</page><page sequence="22">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 7 1 Outright polygyny would still probably generate sufficient social ten- sions such that outlawing this behavior is probably still useful. On the other hand, current divorce laws do not seem to create any excess social tensions. The second nonlibertarian policy aimed at creating stability is the limitation of high incomes, in an environment where high and unequal incomes would have lead to reduced fertility of less successful males. This preference is associated with envy. However, since polygyny is not a problem or an issue today, this policy serves no function. More- over, the policy is more costly now than in the EEA. In the EEA, it was difficult to create wealth, and the general purpose of wealth was for social insurance (Posner, 1980). The major way to accumulate wealth in such a society would be through hoarding and refusal to participate in social exchange, particularly in a hunter-gather environment where stor- age of wealth would be difficult. On the other hand, today, most wealth creation is associated with creation of surpluses for others, so limiting wealth because of envy would have much larger costs today than in the EEA. The argument so far is that benefits of nonlibertarian tastes may be lower today than in the EEA, where such tastes evolved. On the other hand, costs may be higher. Enforcement of antilibertarian social norms may generally be more expensive today than in the EEA. Today's societies are much larger and more anonymous than the relatively small homoge- nous societies of the past. Sober and Wilson (1998) believe that enforce- ment of norms was relatively inexpensive in the past, where information about behavior was available at low cost (because of lack of privacy) and enforcement (through, for example, banishment) was also inexpensive. Today, enforcement is much more expensive. Information about behaviors is not easily or cheaply available because of increased privacy and the anonymity associated with large-scale societies, and enforcement requires relatively expensive incarceration rather than inexpensive banishment or ostracism. Therefore, even if there are rational explanations for the evo- lution of nonlibertarian tastes in the EEA, such tastes may be counter- productive today, even if benefits are the same. Moreover, as discussed above, to the extent that nonlibertarian preferences lead to divisiveness in our large, heterogeneous society, the benefits of these preferences may be reduced.</page><page sequence="23">72 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) These questions seem to be worth further research. At a minimum, however, the argument provides a potential explanation for social prohi- bitions that otherwise are puzzling to many. Even if one favors libertar- ianism, it would be useful to understand why most individuals do not, in order to determine if a movement in that direction would be useful. In proceeding, we should note that individuals might have preferences that evolved for some reason without their necessarily understanding or accepting that reason. 5. Rules Governing Within-Group Behavior These rules are easy to understand and not surprising. They are essen- tially the basic legal rules defining property rights, enforcing contract, punishing violation of these rules, outlawing some forms of violence, and maintaining hierarchy. All humans define themselves in terms of a ter- ritory (Brown, 1991, p. 136) and have concepts of individual and group property (Brown, 1991, pp. 139-40). They also recognize and enforce promises (Brown, 1991, p. 139) and engage in trade and exchange (Brown, 1991, p. 138). All humans also limit within-group violence, and punish violations (Brown, 1991, p. 138). Smith (1998) discusses this issue and suggests that we are selected to engage in impersonal exchange through markets, as well as personalized exchange with known individuals, as a form of reciprocity. It is in this sense that the issue of the primacy of political or economic institutions, mentioned in the introduction, is not a real issue; humans as humans have always had both sets of institutions. These rules of property and contract govern behavior within the group. It is possible to find precursors to property rights and to enforcement of quasi-contractual promises among chimpanzees; de Waal (1996), Grady and McGuire (1997), McGinnis (1997), and Ridley (1997), among recent authors, discuss such rules and rule-like behavior. Cosmides and Tooby (1992) present evidence that humans are better at making analytical judg- ments when the issue is honoring of a commitment. This indicates that cheating on agreements has long been a feature of human behavior, so we have evolved sophisticated methods of detecting such cheating. The prisoner's dilemma with respect to honoring of contracts and respect- ing property rights is clear. Numerous institutions exist even in primi- tive societies for solving or mediating these dilemmas (e.g., Bailey, 1992;</page><page sequence="24">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 73 Epstein 1980, 1989, 1990; Hirshleifer, 1977, 1980; Posner, 1980; Rubin, 1982). All humans have sanctions for violations of rules (Brown, 1991, p. 138). Ridley (1997) provides a nice discussion of such mechanisms and relates the economic property rights literature to the biological literature. The point of this section is not to analyze such rules; numerous anal- yses are readily available in the literature cited above. Rather, the point is that the rules are not created, even at the most primitive level. That is, humans came into being with some rules governing property and contract (honoring of commitments) already in place. As societies and transactions became more complex, these rules multiplied and became more complex. Enforcement mechanisms have also evolved, currently into our hyper- elaborate court systems. But there was never a time when there were no rules and never a time when humans were forced to write such rules de novo. In this view, there is no sharp difference between social norms and law; rather, all rules begin as norms of some sort, and as complexity grows some norms become enforced as laws. Moreover, the scope of rules consistent with evolved human preferences and abilities is not limitless: it is possible to write a logical set of rules that are internally consistent but inconsistent with human nature and unworkable. An example may be Russia and Eastern Europe under communism, where great misery resulted from the assumption that human nature is malleable (Pipes, 1990). Stories and myths of the origin of laws seem common (the Code of Hammurabi, Moses on the mountain) because humans seem unable to grasp the notion of a fully evolved system with no planned elements. (Indeed, it was not until 1776 that the notion of an unplanned but func- tioning economy was understood, and even now, many do not comprehend it.) The myths of the origin of law may lead to increased obedience. The common law of England, so beloved of economists, is merely one stage in this evolutionary process. The common law or any other existing body of law, if it could be traced back sufficiently far, would turn out to be directly descended from the evolved predilections for law-based behavior. Much of the difficulty in Russia in creating a body of law is that there is a discontinuity created in legal change, caused by communism and com- munist law. It appears to be very difficult to create a functioning body of law de novo, with no evolutionary component. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have been more successful because they have been</page><page sequence="25">74 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) able to adapt a previous body of law, continuing an evolutionary process (Rubin, 1994). One important issue in law and economics and elsewhere is the origin of property rights. For example, in discussions of wealth maximization, Posner (1979) and his critics (e.g., Keenan, 1981) address the origin of property rights. Posner advocates using wealth maximization as a norma- tive principle. However, wealth maximization is defined only if there is a set of prices and prices imply some distribution of wealth in society. Thus, the criticism is that Posner's suggestion is circular - wealth maximiza- tion is defined only with respect to a distribution of wealth, but the goal of wealth maximization is to determine how to allocate wealth (broadly defined). The error on both sides in this line of analysis seems to be in the assumption that any distribution of wealth is arbitrary and a product of some decision or allocation process. But if wealth distributions are basi- cally given for evolved or historic reasons, then they are not arbitrary and it is possible to start from the existing distribution. Of course, the exist- ing distribution is not immutable, nor is it in any useful sense morally "correct," but on the other hand it is not arbitrary, and there is no rea- son why it is improper to start with this distribution in performing the wealth-maximization analysis. One interesting human adaptation is the use of hierarchy. Hierarchies are common in animals - the term "pecking order" is derived from hier- archies among chickens. But the purpose of hierarchies among animals is generally to allocate resources (including females) with reduced amounts of intra-group violence. However, humans have adapted this concept to new uses. Among humans, hierarchies are used for productive as well as allocative purposes; they are used to perform tasks (Rubin, 2000). That is, superiors induce subordinates to undertake coordinated activities whose benefits are shared in some way throughout the hierarchy. These are tasks related to aggression, both offensive and defensive, and to production. The use of hierarchy in this manner is part of the more general use of division of labor among humans, which is in turn made possible by mechanisms used in exchange, such as kin altruism and reciprocity (Trivers, 1971). It may also be related to increasing ability to communicate, which would have made hierarchical division of labor easier to coordinate. This use of hierarchy appears to be a little-appreciated human innovation.</page><page sequence="26">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 75 Religion Burkert (1996) discusses how religion enforces property rights by treat- ing boundary markers as sacred. He also discusses the role of oaths in enforcing contracts and promises. An oath generally would call for ret- ribution from the gods for violation, thereby serving as an enforcement device for believers. It is generally difficult for humans to pretend beliefs that are not real (Frank 1988), so if appearing to have a religious belief is valuable, then it would pay to actually have such a belief. If people were more likely to transact with someone who actually believes in divine pun- ishment for breaking an oath, then having this belief would be individually valuable because it would increase transaction possibilities. It would be costly for a nonbeliever to pretend belief, so sustained religious behav- ior would act as a signal. One could demonstrate a religious belief by contributing resources to the gods or religion, for example, by financing sacrifices, or, today, contributing to building funds. Even if expenditures on religion are socially wasteful, they may nonetheless be efficient if they increase value of transactions sufficiently to pay for themselves. For an individual, such spending would be a signal in Spence's (1973) sense. A true believer would gain both valuable reputation as a believer whose oath could be accepted and (he would think) whatever religious bene- fits are promised for such contributions. A nonbeliever would gain only reputational benefits and, since others could observe his level of contri- bution, these benefits would not accrue. Therefore, only believers would contribute. The argument is that religious beliefs originated for essentially the anthropomorphic reasons discussed by Guthrie (1993). The form of these beliefs was arbitrary. At some point, some religions began advocating poli- cies that would have led to increased productivity. Then members of these religions would have done better than others, so these religions would have grown - either because of increased fertility of members, or because oth- ers would have imitated the more successful. Boyd and Richerson (1985) discuss imitation of the successful as a method of spreading a cultural trait. Roes (1995) presents evidence that societies believing in gods that support human morality are larger than others.</page><page sequence="27">76 American Law and Economics Review V3 N1 2001 (50-81) 6. Summary In the Hobbesian state of nature, humans are visualized as individ- uals in conflict with each other in a lawless world. Such a situation never existed: humans evolved as group-living animals with rules. There was never a time when humans lived in a ruleless world or a world of individuals. Rules evolved with humans. However, human groups have been in conflict, and the state of nature may be conceived as a situation with groups in conflict with other groups, where each group has inter- nal cohesion based on a set of internal rules. The Hobbesian actor is a group of humans, not an individual human. Several implications flow from this analysis. Although all humans live in groups, definition of group membership has been remarkably flexible, and humans can form many types of groups. It is argued that humans are actually less xenophobic and more flexible in group membership than would have been possible. I examine two types of rules regarding group members. First are rules regulating individual behavior with no obvious external effects. This class of rules has given economists the most difficulty, because humans seem to prefer more intervention into behavior of others than economists would predict. The argument here is that a "libertarian" regime could have been invaded from within and from without, and would not have been evo- lutionarily stable. From within, in a libertarian setting some individuals would have acquired large numbers of wives, so other individuals would have had none; those individuals would not have left genes in the current population. From without, a libertarian regime would not have been able to defend itself, and would have been subject to a successful attack by less libertarian groups. Thus, we are selected to seek rules that have reduced the ability of some males to acquire excessive numbers of females, and rules regulating conduct so as to increase the fighting ability of individ- uals, particularly young males. This perspective can explain many moral and religious rules that are otherwise inexplicable. It is an example of a conflict between the biological goal of fitness maximization and the economists' hypothesized goal of utility maximization. However, because of increased costs of enforcement and perhaps reduced benefits of nonlib- ertarian practices, it is not clear that under today's conditions libertarian- ism would remain unviable; this issue is worthy of further research.</page><page sequence="28">The State of Nature and Political Preferences 77 The second class of rules defines relations between individuals; these include rules of property and contract, and rules defining hierarchies. All humans enforce property rights and contracts. We seem to have evolved to be particularly good at detecting opportunism and cheating. Religious beliefs also contribute to enforcement. Humans have adapted hierarchies to additional uses concerning division of labor. References Aiello, Leslie, and Peter Wheeler. 1995.
