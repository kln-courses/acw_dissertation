When Paul submitted this article last October, he said that he did not want any special consideration from the editor, but observed that, in light of his struggle against cancer, this might well be his "swan song" as far as his work in psychology of religion was concerned. Unfortunately, he was right. He died on April 9th, the victim of a sudden heart attack. The article published in this issue is his fifth article in the JSSR. Previous articles included an assessment of Erik H. Erickson's Young Man Luther, an analysis of the phenomenology and dynamics of hoping, a clinical psychologist's diagnostic appraisal of Augustine, and an application of art theory to the psychology of religion (his SSSR presidential address). My personal favorite is the article on hoping, in which he draws on Gabriel Marcel's distinction between hoping and wishing, and on W. C. M. Scott's distinctions between waiting, anticipating, pining and hoping. He recently returned to the topic of hope in an article written for a convention of oncologists and published in Pastoral Psychology (Winter, 1986) under the title, "Maintaining Hope in Adversity." In this article, he suggests that "hoping is based on a belief that there is some benevolent disposition toward oneself somewhere in the universe, conveyed by a caring person." He then quotes two mystics who make the point that our desire for God is reciprocated in God's desire for us. Thus, Angelus Silesius says, "I know that without me God could not live one moment," and the poet Rilke asked, "What will you do, God, when I die?" Pruyser acknowledges that there are traces of "infantile grandiosity" in such statements, but says that we should not be so concerned about the grandiosity that we overlook these mystics' "stunning discovery that the creator and the created, or the universe and the solitary person, are interdependent and engaged in patterns of mutuality." It seems fitting that his "swan song" is entitled, "Where Do We Go From Here?" One can almost hear Paul asking this question of the universe at the moment of his death, and then, having asked it, adding something like, "But don't tell me. I'll want to see and hear it for myself." In the article published in this issue, Pruyser challenges his colleagues to address two important questions: 1) Is there a developmental or dialectic dynamic in religion itself that moves from more or less anthropomorphic theistic imagery to impersonal or atheistic conceptions?; and 2) Is religion, even among the educated and intellectually ambitious, a favorite and socially sanctioned area of stagnation, fixation, or regression? These are intriguing questions, and, hopefully, some of us will be prompted to explore them. If so, I can think of no better way to orient ourselves for such explorations than to read, or re-read, Paul Pruyser's three very important books in the psychology of religion, A Dynamic Psychology of Religion (1968), Between Belief and Unbelief (1974), and The Play of the Imagination (1983).</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS Understanding Today's Cults The Dark Lord: Cult Images and the Hare Krishnas in America by Larry D.
