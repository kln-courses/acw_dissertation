<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume XI, Number 3, September 1981 CRITICAL STUDY OF: Paul Churchland: Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1979. x+ 157 pages. This is a very ambitious book. Beginning with the premise of scien- tific realism (explained clearly in the first six pages), Churchland aims at little less than a 'transvaluation of all values' at the level of concepts ap- plied in daily living as well as in all parts of philosophy. By making the theoretical concepts of modern science our own (interiorizing them, if I may continue the ethical analogy) we can systematically change and enlarge the structure and content of our experience. The denial of any genuine primacy to our current 'conceptual framework' or the 'manifest image' opens up this possibility: It is important for us to appreciate, if only dimly, the extent of the perceptual transformation here envisaged. These people do not sit on the beach and listen to the steady roar of the pounding surf. They sit on the beach and listen to the aperiodic atmospheric compression waves produced as the coherent energy of the ocean waves is audibly redistributed in the chaotic turbulence of the shallows. (29) What is intended here is not a third-person redescription of what is happening, but an attempt to show what experience would be like, how things would seem, how we would spontaneously describe our own experience, after the re-education. Especially striking are the instruc- tions for re-orienting yourself in the solar system, with diagrams, on pages 30-34. 1 tried to follow the instructions on several successive clear Los Angeles evenings, and did experience the sense of vertigo that 555</page><page sequence="2">Bas C. van Fraassen Churchland mentions. I recommend the exercise. If some of Church- land's more glowing descriptions sound rather like The Tao of Science, that is probably all to the good; the consequences drawn are impor- tant, vivid, and much better calculated to give life to the philosophical issues than aridly abstract discussions. In any case, most of the book is devoted to technical philosophical problems, from the same perspec- tive, and these introductory discussions highlight clearly the subjects of competing theories, scientific revolutions, and conceptual change. From the scientific realists' point of view, so Churchland argues, we risk no loss, and can do no better than by assisting our concepts 'to evolve towards whatever counterparts they may have in the wider conception that science has provided' (36). 1 . Incompatibility of the 'P-theory' with science Since this book is not an argument for scientific realism, but starts with that position as premise, a more sympathetic reviewer than myself could have been found. I shall do my best to be devil's advocate; that is, to try and see whether from the point of view of a scientific realist, the philosophical arguments in the remainder of the book are successful. After all realists and empiricists have a common interest in many of the problems concerning language, structure of theories, and epistemology, that are broached here. Central to the entire book is the conviction, illustrated so graphically for perception at the beginning, that the common sense framework must be replaced by a scientific conceptual framework. The one cannot be, or become, part of the other, for they are incompatible. It would of course be quite against the spirit of scientific realism to suggest that the concepts introduced for theoretical purposes of science, and the language proper to them, are only a small part of our total conceptual scheme and language in use, developed for relatively specialised pur- poses. In addition Churchland, like Sellars, does not believe that, con- versely, the concepts we presently utilize can be regarded as a proper part of a larger framework being developed within science. Therefore section 14, The incongruent nature of the P-theory/ is perhaps the most important in the book, for that is where Churchland marshalls reasons for suspecting this incompatibility. The P-theory is the commonsense psychological theory which constitutes our ordinary understanding of matters psychological. Churchland realizes that he is himself putting forward a theory when he insists that there is such a thing as the P- theory (see p. 92, of which my preceding sentence is a near quote). Since 556</page><page sequence="3">Critical Study of Paul Churchland Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind I am inclined to think that this theory (i.e., not the P-theory, but the theory that our ordinary understanding, etcetera) is part and parcel of the premise of scientific realism as Churchland understands it, I shall not dispute it here, but take it as given. To show that this P-theory can at least not prima facie be regarded as part of the eventual total unified science, nor as a preliminary version of a part thereof, Churchland then attempts to demonstrate that this P- theory must have a structure entirely different from the structure of modern scientific theories. He points to the central class of P-predicates which have the form. (1) ...X-esthatp where X is a psychological verb of the sort philosophers generally describe as expressing a propositional attitude, and p is a sentence. (The reader is asked to supply corner quotes and other literary devices in this review.) If we keep X constant (say as 'wants (it to be the case)' or 'believes') and let p vary, we have a natural family of P-predicates: determinates under a common determinable. So treated, p is a variable ranging over propositions, or at least, over the family of propositions expressible in a given (fragment of a) language. These propositions may form a well-studied structure; say a Boolean algebra, or something more sohpisticated in that neighbourhood. Consider now also the central predicates in modern scientific theory. Such a sentence as 'The moon has a mass of 106 kilograms' may at first look a bit like 'That man has a belief in fairies' but the predicate of the latter is best reconstructed in form (1) while that in the former sentence has form (2) ...has a V of n where Y is a term denoting a scaled physical magnitude (such as 'mass in kilograms') and n a numeral. Keeping V constant and allowing n to vary, we again arrive at a determinable predicate (which is said to denote a physical magnitude or observable, by writers on the foun- dations of physics) and so treated, n ranges over numbers. These num- bers also form a well-studied structure, which is however quite different from a Boolean algebra or anything else likely to be found in semantics. Churchland calls Pythagorean a theory in which the relations bet- ween empirical properties are representable as relations between num- bers. Thus, he says, familiar scientific theories are Pythagorean. The P- theory deals instead with 'empirical states, the relations between which are the relations between propositions' and so is not Pythagorean (103). He comments 'it is primarily for this reason, I suggest, that our self- 557</page><page sequence="4">Bas C. van Fraassen conception stands in such stubborn, disconnected isolation from our growing conception of the rest of nature. For that grander conception is Pythagorean to the core ...' (107). In my opinion, all of this is quite wrong, an incorrect description of the structure of present thinking about both psychological attitudes and about physical magnitudes. In both areas, there has been a quiet revolution in the twentieth century whose effects, if not loudly proclaimed from the rooftops, are as far-reaching and deep-going as any aspects of modern sicence to which Churchland draws attention. Opinion about the structure of concepts and theories in psychology and in physics seem to me to be moving toward a common form. First of all, in psychology and epistemology attention is paid to com- parative and quantitative forms of attitude attribution which are cer- tainly as common-sensical as any qualitative ones. 'It seems as likely as not that it will rain,' 1 am prepared to bet (invest, pay) twice as much (wait twice as long, go to twice as many shops) to obtain a good pen as I am to get a good watch '- these are cases in which we apparently 'know our minds' well enough to speak in quantitative terms. In other cases we can at least establish a rank ordering - it seems more likely than not to me that it will rain today. Concentration on the purely qualitative psychological attitude verbs would make for a travesty of the richness and delicate articulation of those phenomena. In the develop- ment of subjective probability, game-, and decision-theory, as well as in economics and psychometric studies, we have seen the construction of sophisticated quantitative models that do those aspects more justice, even if they are oversimplified in other ways. Nor are these models far removed from the phenomena that we habitually describe in what Churchland calls the P-predicates. Led by de Finetti, psychologists and statisticians have developed scoring methods to evaluate how good a person's subjective probability is. In weather forecasting we have the Brier score for announced probabilities of precipitation. Similar scoring is possible for pari-mutual betting (where the agents bet against each other, unlike, say, at the roulette table). There the average winnings of course already provide an objective in- dex to how much subjective expectation is in tune with the realities. Not only that: systematic feedback on the score leads to improvement. CIA intelligence analysts are now reportedly being trained by these methods developed in psychological studies. There is of course a widespread conviction that such quantities as length and mass have precise values while wants and degrees of belief are vague. There are a dozen or so reasonable ways to deny that asym- metry. If you are a realist, you may simply point out that it has long been recognised - also by many writers who can hardly be accused of scien- tism - that introspection is no sure guide to what our wants and beliefs 558</page><page sequence="5">Critical Study of Paul Churchland Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind are, so that these attitudes may well have precise degrees even if in- trospection issues only in imprecise judgments. Alternately, it may be asserted that there is as little reason to think that physical phenomena are veridically described in terms of real number valued parameters as psychological ones. The theoretical quantities of length and mass in Newtonian mechanics, the greatest success story in the history of scien- ce, are indeed real valued - but are they any less of an idealization than subjective probability? Or thirdly, the dispute may be merely verbal. Among the warring opinions on quantum mechanics, we find one that 'Q has value n' is not true for any number n - an assertion that physical quantities are objectively vague. We also find the contrary opinion that if a quantity has any value at all, which is the case only under certain conditions, its value is a real number. In that case when a writer with the first conviction says that Q has vague value r + d, one of the second ilk will say that Q has no value at all, but of course there is a quantity Q1 which is a function of Q and the interval [r - d, r + d] which has value 1 in this case. And it is quickly perceived that there is a simple rule that always allows us to translate what the first says into what the second would say and vice versa. Fourthly, there are various formal techniques for representing vagueness, 'fuzzy' quantities, interval-valued probabilities, and the like, in terms of classes of their precise counter- parts. So imprecision is no obstacle. Looking now at this quantitative theory or idealization, we do find that it is still not what Churchland calls Pythagorean. Its central family of predicates have the form (3) ...'sU that p equals r where U is a term like 'degree of belief or 'utility for its being the case.' We see here two variables, one ranging over propositions and one over numbers. But is our physical science really 'Pythagorean to the core/ as Church- land says? This opinion may be true of Newtonian mechanics. The picture of science that has emerged in foundational work since scientists began to take serious the radical sort of indeterminism found in quan- tum mechanics is very different. Indeed, the central relation between the physical state and the physical magnitudes consists in a function determining probabilities for these magnitudes to take on certain values under certain conditions: (4) ...'s state is such that the probability that m takes a value in E (under conditions m *) equals r. The similarity between (3) and (4), perhaps clear enough already, is 559</page><page sequence="6">Bas C. van Fraassen blatant when we look at the common brief symbolization P (q) = r, where r is a real number variable, and q ranges over an algebra of propositions. (In the case of (4), that algebra is {(m takes a value in E): m a physical quantity and E a Borel set} which is generally asserted to be a lattice or partial Boolean algebra, which is Boolean in case of classical physics.) In sum, the general form of elementary propositions at the foundations of both psychological states and physical states is that in which two variables range respectively over an algebra of propositions and a set of real numbers. What conclusions should we draw from all this? Churchland's are guarded. He points to the prima facie disparity between P-theory and physical theory which he saw - and which I take to be illusory - and bases on it no more than 'a strong inclination' (116) to the view that 'the familiar ontology of common sense mental states will go the way of the Stoic pneumata, the alchemical essences, phlogiston, caloric, and the luminiferous aether' (as he characterizes eliminative materialism on p. 114). But would this book have been written if that inclination had not been perceived as well-founded? If there is no essential incompatibility between the concepts we presently utilize in our lives within the manifest image, and those employed in scientific theoretical thought about the world, why should we be enjoined to perceive the empirical world (Chapter 2), or do epistemology (Chapter 5), in a new way? Of course there are many examples of people relying in every day life on false, outdated, and generally inadequate scientific theories - usually ones successful during some earlier epoch of our history. We talk as if we believe Ptolemy when we speak of the sun rise; we still rely on Newtonian mechanics to design rockets. Various purposes justify such shortcuts or deliberate archaisms. People bewitched by pictures, fur- nished by those officially replaced theories, may easily be led to wrong philosophical conclusions (about the structure of science, or about the way the world must be). There is some gain and some loss. If there is no essential incompatibility between manifest and scientific image, what can we say about this beyond the banal warning not to rely too un- critically on the world picture of past or current fashionable theories? 2. The Theory of Language In Chapter 2 in connection with observation, and in Chapter 3 more generally in the discussion of theories and concepts, Churchland ad- vances a theory of language. This theory is quite revolutionary as well; the concepts of truth and reference are denied a basic role, translation 560</page><page sequence="7">Critical Study of Paul Churchland Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind and acceptance taking centre stage. The new theory is put to use in a discussion of various current issues in philosophy of science such as ob- servation, evidence, analyticity, indeterminacy, incommensurability of theories, and theoretical reduction. I shall give a brief outline of the theory as developed in Chapter 3, then take up his arguments against a well-known view of Hilary Putnam's. Some of the problems that arise may not be eliminable without substantial changes in the approach. (a) Semantic importance Churchland advocates the not unfamiliar view that we cannot separate the structure of the language from theories formulated in that language and accepted or otherwise considered by the community of its users. The notion of analyticity is replaced by that of semantic import- ance. At various points this seems to be a matter of degree (see the diagram on p. 57), but it is originally introduced as an qualitative (yes/no) notion as follows on p. 51 : Roughly speaking, the semantically important sentences are just those sentences on whose acceptance (at time t) the smoothness and efficiency of one's verbal commerce in a community is maximally dependent (at time t). The nearest precise counterpart provided for the meaning of a term is the set of semantically important sentences in which it occurs. Apparently then, that smoothness and efficiency may be dependent on the acceptance of a given sentence to greater or lesser degree. I wonder if this could possibly be spelled out without recourse to coun- terfactuals? But it may be more productive if we do not push the discussion into directions in which Churchland himsel does not go. Let us instead see what sort of sentences may be semantically important. If we find ourselves in a community in which everyone accepts 'electrons have a negative charge' our verbal commerce will certainly go more smoothly if we treat that sentence as an unquestioned assumption. (Will it go still more smoothly if we accept it as well? Let us leave that aside.) In the case of 'phlogiston' a corresponding sentence would be 'burning objects emit phlogiston.' I am not entirely clear on what is said about this case in the book (55). But I think that the upshot is that not this sen- tence, but rather 'The sentence "burning objects emit phlogiston" used to be generally accepted' is semantically important today, and that sort of sentence constitutes the present meaning of phlogiston. But in that case I don't see why we should not similarly conclude that the smoothness of our verbal commerce does not depend on acceptance of 'elctrons have negative charge' as opposed to 'The sentence "electrons 561</page><page sequence="8">Bas C. van Fraassen have negative charge" is generally accepted.' If that is so it also becomes intelligible why non-believers can easily communicate with believers (in God, the ego, electrons, what have you). And the way is opened to a still more liberal theory in which the semantically important sentences merely describe what sentences are to be treated {pro tern, within the present stage of discussion, in the present context) as unquestioned assumptions. That would bring us a very long way from the initial idea that what theories are accepted by the linguistic com- munity affects the meanings of the terms they use. And it would help, perhaps, to remove the bothersome question how a person can know what he is advocating if the very words in which he states his theory will have a different meaning once that theory is accepted. Churchland himself answers that question as follows. When a new theory is proposed, its terms derive their meaning partly from the recognition of what sentences will be accepted once the theory has been accepted. But we must be careful to stick to his own definition of semantic importance. What is semantically important now is a sentence on whose acceptance now the efficiency of our present verbal commer- ce depends. That presently accepted sentence must take the form If theory T becomes accepted then the efficiency of our verbal commerce will come to depend on the acceptance of sentence A' and cannot be that sentence A itself. Here, as for 'phlogiston,' that efficiency depends on acceptance of a metalinguistic proposition, about features surround- ing the use in other circumstances of words we are about to use our- selves, and not on acceptance of language-independent propositions about the way the world is, such as the axioms of the proposed theory. I do not see why it should not also be that way with the terms occurring in currently accepted theories. This is not a challenge to the general ap- proach as a suggestion that Churchland may have misidentified what is 'semantically important' in his own sense. (b) Translation Reference and truth have not appeared in the account of language so far; nor will they. What can we make then of the assertion that 'rot,' in German, means 'red'? A naive answer would be that a correct trans- lation of German into English is a mapping that preserves gram- maticality and truth-value. Churchland describes the nearest concept available to him as follows on p. 62: An optimal translation of La into Ifi is a mapping of the terms and syntactic forms of La into the terms and syntactic forms of L0 such that (1) the image, under that mapping, of each grammatical sentence of La is a grammatical 562</page><page sequence="9">Critical Study of Paul Churchland Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind sentence of L/3, and (2) the images, under that mapping, of the sentences semantically important for each term Ta in La are exactly the sentences semantically important for its paired term T/9 in L/3. This is easily modified if we wish it to reflect degrees of semantic impor- tance. But can semantic importance really carry all this weight? I shall now assume that Churchland is correct in identifying substantive statements such as 'ice is frozen water' as semantically important, and explain my doubts that this approach can work. It will be easiest to enter here Churchland's own discussion of a well-known argument of Put- nam's. (c) Putnam on the rigidity of common nouns In The Meaning of "Meaning",' Putnam gives the example of a Twin Earth, observationally indistinguishable from Earth, but where the microstructure of what looks etc. like water is different from that of water on Earth. Let us call the tribe of Twin Earthlings A, that of Ear- thlings 8. Suppose that their languages are exactly alike syntactically ex- cept that A has 'watter' where 8 has 'water.' Suppose also that the sen- tences semantically important to A are exactly those obtained by sub- stituting 'watter' for 'water' in those semantically important to 8. This substitution procedure is then an optimal translation in Churchland's sense. Let us add, just in case it does make a difference, that this procedure also results in a sentence accepted by the whole A tribe exac- tly when applied to one accepted by the whole 8 tribe. Putnam argues that nevertheless it would be a mistake to say that the substance called 'watter' by A belongs to the extension of 'water' as used by 8. For the latter term denotes H2O, and denotes that same sub- stance in all circumstances, possible or actual. Thus although obser- vationally indistinguishable from H2O, the Twin Earth substance denoted by 'watter' is not denoted by 8 term 'water.' The optimal tran- slation is therefore not at all a translation in the intuitive sense for it does not preserve truth-values. Putnam maintained that the term's meaning receives this extra-in- tensional component through the use of demonstratives and other in- dexical terms, in the use of such sentences as 'The stuff in our rivers is water.' Churchland perceives that there is here indeed a feature of language that may have been left untreated in his own theory. The stan- dard translation of 'La mattere dans nos fleuves' may be 'The stuff in our rivers,' but what a Frenchman denotes by the former may not be what an Englishman denotes by the latter. It is a good translation nevertheless because if the same speaker switches languages, and all other features of the context stay the same, he can say the same thing as before by means 563</page><page sequence="10">Bas G van Fraassen of those words in the new language. It appears however that if the same Twin Earthling were to say first The stuff in our rivers is watter' and then, switching to the B language, The stuff in our rivers is water/ he would first make a true statement and then a false one. Thus we have here a case of an optimal translation that does not meet the criteria we normally impose on a good translation. This problem is not dealt with at all by means of Churchland's observations concerning the occurrence of 'the stuff in our lakes' in their (the Twin Earthlings') mouths and in our (the Earthlings') mouths. It is a problem concerning putative translations occurring successively in the same mouths. The only way out for Churchland, it seems to me, is to deny some substantive point made by Putnam. And while Churchland does argue a little about the proper characterization of indexical language use, he seems also to offer a theory that is substantially at odds with Putnam's here. While not entirely certain of my interpretation of pp. 73-4, I seem to detect there the following view. No B will deny that what is called 'watter' on Twin Earth is water only if the former has the same nature as water. But what a 8 would mean by this depends on his current theory of the nature of things. Hence Putnam's point reduces to a trivial one. Sentences of form 'Water is ...' belong to the set of semantically impor- tant sentences for 'water' in the A language if and only if the correspon- ding 'Watter is ...' belongs to the corresponding 8-language set. Thus it is clear that whatever is the 8-theory of the nature of water, is also ac- cepted mutatis mutandis in A. If we assume therefore that the A- speakers are right in calling their stuff 'watter,' then they are also right if, speaking the 8-language, they call it 'water.' Doubts about this arise solely from the worry that events may prove the language-game 'em- pirically incoherent,' that is, may eventually refute such an assumption, presently underpinning efficient verbal commerce, as that, if a bit of watter is mixed with something observational ly indistinguishable from it, the resultant will not be explosive, flammable, poisonous or other- wise observationally distinguishable from the originals. That danger, however, is always with us, and has nothing to do with criteria for tran- slation or any other aspect of meaning. The problem with the view I have just outlined, it seems to me, is that even from within it, optimal translation cannot explicate sameness of meaning across languages. For consider a third tribe C living on a third planet, earth. In fact let C be us; B is a tribe quite like us (Earth is microphysically as well as observationally the same as earth) except that it is conceptually benighted, not having got beyond the observable and the P-theory. We secretly and invisible investigate both Earth and Twin Earth, and declare the B-language to be identical with part of ours (homophonic translation) while we translate the A-language quite dif- ferently. (We would not after all want to end up saying that the A-word 564</page><page sequence="11">Critical Study of Paul Churchland Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind 'watter' means 'water' but denotes something which is not h^O, if one of our semantically important sentences is 'Water is H2O/) Looking at these two translations we say that if I were to point to something and (speaking my language) call it water, and then (switching to A-language) watter, my two statements could not both be true. Indeed, each would imply the negation of the other. Now presumably (working within the general view described) these two translations are optimal translations in Churchland's sense. And none of this refutes the earlier contention that the ('water'/'watter') substitution is an optimal translation from A to B. Thus optimal translation is not transitive, it does not yield an equivalence relation. To put it in other words, the nearest we have to in- terlinguistic sameness is something that is relative, relative to the language (-game) in which the translation is considered. The defect in my eyes, in other words, is that Churchland has taken into account only bilateral relations among languages and not trilateral. But the relativity of translation may seem acceptable to him; or he may not subscribe to the view which I thought I found in those pages. It is also possible that Putnam's views are now nearer to Churchland's than they once were. Under Dummett's influence it may now be attractive to him to think that what the A and B tribes persons do not know can have no influence on what they mean. But that too is ambiguous. I would say that the A-lien knows that this (pointing to one of his rivers) is correctly denoted by his word 'watter.' He also knows that if anything were brought to his planet that exploded when poured into one of his rivers, it would not be denoted by 'watter.' (I take it that, not being H2O, some such experiment would distinguish if from H2O if there were H2O available.) The problem goes all the way down - truth-values of sen- tences, including ones not even formulable by the two tribes (and cer- tainly of many which they neither accept nor deny) appear to play a role in our determination of what they mean, what they know, what they believe, what their acceptance conditions are, and so forth. 3. Advice concerning epistemology The last chapter presents an eloquent and persuasive plea for a dif- ferent approach to epistemology, not unconnected with the exploration at the outset of the supposed enrichment of perceptual experience by conceptual immersion in scientific theory. For Churchland sees his philosophical colleagues carrying on epistemology using the concepts of the P-theory. He suggests in effect that even normative epistemology 565</page><page sequence="12">Bas C. van Fraassen must be based on a description, and would benefit greatly from the replacement of commonsensical by scientific concedpts. It is fair, I think, to see the unity of this book in a sustained conviction that total immersion in the scientific world-picture would incur no risk and could only bring gain, for all areas of human intellectual life - and especially for philosophy where the way of looking at things matters so much. Can I take issue with this without questioning the premise of scien- tific realism? If the P-theory and science were compatible (as I suggested above, on the assumption that such a thing as the P-theory is isolable) there would be little point in advice to epistemologists to discard con- cepts which to date appear to define their domain. And it does not seem to me that scientific realism as such implies the intrinsic incompatibility of the conceptual framework of propositional attitudes with that of the sciences. Brian Loar's book forthcoming in this same series published by Cambridge, and the functionalism espoused by Putnam (with which Churchland takes issue in Section 1 5) speak to the contrary. Let us then consider critically Churchland's suggestion to set epistemology on a new course: that of regarding ourselves as epistemic engines, and developing this subject in analogy to thermodynamics. It is hardly to be denied that this idea is very suggestive and may be fruitful. Metaphors can generally have such an effect. The metaphor may be suggestive, even if found slightly distasteful (as I do this one - I will not deny that my feelings on this subject run as high as Church- land's). That it is a metaphor is clear; we are not literally engines. That the metaphor has an obvious core of truth, and is easily applied, is equally clear. Any organism can be regarded as an engine; a plant for instance sucks in sunshine and carbon dioxide, water and minerals; and exudes oxygen, water vapour, fruit, and dead leaves. Now an engine typically has a function. But when I regard the cat Melissa, of whom I am very fond, as an engine, its only obvious function appears to be to turn catfood into cat faeces. The metaphor, as metaphors do, dwindles and leads to confusion if pressed. I think that will also happen quickly with that same metaphor if utilized in epistemology. Melissa also takes in light waves and smells, soundwaves and tactile impulses, all of which carry information in the technical sense. Her little cortex processes* this information and adjusts the flow of neural im- pulses, governing hormone production and other physiological processes accordingly; and the cat purrs. Here we have an epistemic * I fear that I have here already partly mixed in an anthropomorphic metaphor, but 'information processing' may already be a dead metaphor and hence allowable. 566</page><page sequence="13">Critical Study of Paul Church land Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind engine. It would be just as much a metaphor, probably, if we said that she understands that I am stroking her affectionately and purrs with con- tentment - at least, it would certainly be a metaphor if we made such remarks about a mollusc. There is most likely no way to proceed in epistemology unguided by any metaphor. Well then, let us use many! It is a fact that the most far- reaching theories we have seen developed in this area recently - dealing with qualitative, comparative, and quantitative epistemic judgments, by Koopmans, Keynes, Reichenbach, Carnap, de Finetti, Savage, Kyburg, Levi, Jeffrey, to make a random selection - have the structure of a straightforward development of what Churchland calls the P-theory. Simultaneously, the metaphor of subjective reduction of un- certainty, made fruitful in thermodynamics by such as Jaynes, appears to run in a direction exactly counter to Churchland's advice. The issue is much larger of course, and must not be diminished with technicalities. Epistemology is a large area, it must take in our knowledge of other persons, and self-knowledge, as well as weather forecasts. If there were an incompatibility between science and the concepts we have evolved in the human life-world, founded in the community of persons and their immediate concerns, there would be some point to Churchland's advocacy. But without that, it seems more reasonable to maintain the established picture of a world in which physics, psychology, literature, theology, political ideology, and all other forms of intellectual endeavour are in part (equal if unfortunately rather separate) attempts to understand and systematize our concepts pertaining to different aspects of our experience - and to aspects of that same world - each of them suffering if any one of them is made the basis of a philosophical form of cultural imperialism. I would have done this provocative book less than justice if I had concentrated on technical details concerning perception, translation, theory structure and propositional attitudes. So I am happy to have allowed our more basic disagreements to emerge in the last few paragraphs. Had I not, for the sake of this discussion, left the premise of scientific realism unquestioned, these disagreements would have been more overt. But I recommend the reading of this book to scientific realists and to diehard empiricists alike; they will both find much that is valuable and much on which to sharpen their own views.
