Miles Reading Augustine's hypothetical description of resurrection bodies through Freud and his critics' construction of "sexuality," I suggest that Augustine's mature writings on the resurrection include some- thing like post-Freudian ideas of sexuality, even though the concept itself was not part of Augustine's conceptual universe. Historicizing "sexuality" frees the concept for revision so that sexuality can be thought of as embedded in social assumptions and arrangements rather than individual, as part rather than essence of the self, and as gendered rather than universal.

I don't want to live on in the hearts and minds of my countrymen; I want to live on in my apartment. -Woody Allen A PERENNIAL COMPLAINT OF Christian preachers is the incredulity, of believers and nonbelievers alike, about the doctrine of the resurrection of body.' In the fifth century Augustine complained that even though "the whole world" believed in the resurrection of body, there were still many who found it dubious. The same refrain appeared repeatedly in medieval sermons, in spite of efforts to encourage belief by picturing the resurrection in stone and paint. Similarly, twenty-first century Christians assert their belief in the resurrection of body whenever they recite the creed, but many acknowledge the lack of a robust idea of bodily resurrection. Yet the doctrine that bodies will rise from death at a point beyond present experience is far from incidental or accidental to Christian faith. "If it is incredible that God raises the dead," Paul said in Acts 26.8, "then our preaching is vain," a theme repeated in I Corinthians 15. In the twenty-first, as in the first century, the resurrection of body is, for Christians, an article of faith; in the two thousand years since the earliest Christians, little or no progress has been made in rendering bodily resurrection credible. Although there may be many reasons for skepticism about this essen- tial Christian doctrine, I will address only one impediment to belief. Augustine (d. 430 C.E.), the most articulate proponent of the resurrection of body, insisted enthusiastically on the presence and integrity of bodies, even of male and female sexes, in the resurrection, but he seems to have excluded sexuality from the perfection and completion of humanity. Yet Christians are, first of all, human beings, most of whom are unable to imagine themselves without sexuality. Indeed, sexuality seems so integral and intimate a part of human life that any account of the perfection and completion of humanity that omits it must be inadequate. Augustine's influence is widely blamed for negative views of body and sexuality in the dominantly Christian West. Indeed, Augustine was the greatest single influence on Catholic and Protestant theology through such authors as Thomas Aquinas, Luther, and Calvin. More- over, because Christian values have pervasively influenced western culture I avoid use of the common expression "the body" because it implies a generic (male) body that has never been seen or touched. Bodies are always sexed (biology) and gendered (socialization); they are also marked by race, age, social location, and many other factors.</page><page sequence="3">Miles: Sex and the City of God 309 beyond religious communities, caricatures and misconceptions of Augustine's teachings have contributed to western societies in which all bodies-human and non-human-are the helpless victims of the joyless pursuit of sex, power, and possessions. A more accurate understanding of Augustine on physicality and sexuality offers the possibility of begin- ning to dismantle attitudes toward bodies that continue to fund economic injustice, ecological irresponsibility, and oppression based on race, class, and sexual orientation. Because Augustine's values relating to human bodies and their capacities are most transparent in his discussions of the perfection of humanity in the anticipated resurrection of body, these discussions provide the basis for our exploration of his construction of sexuality. Why did Augustine eliminate what he himself described as the "sharpest joy" (summa voluptas) of human experience ("a pleasure surpassing all physical delights," City of God 14. 16; henceforth CD), from his repertoire of resurrection rewards? Augustine's interpreters have too easily invoked Augustine's own sexual experience, famously described in his Confessions, as sufficient reason for his distrust of, and apparent distaste for, sex. To approach a more adequate answer to the above question, it will be necessary to go beyond proof-texts to the theo- logical interests that informed his fantasy of resurrection delight. One of the first questions to be addressed is whether Augustine's conceptual repertoire for thinking about the role of sex in human life was the same as that of twenty-first century people. But surely, someone might respond, if anything is universal it is sex, and "we" know what "we" mean when we speak of it. Wrong. Although sexual acts are presumably as old as the human race, postmodern scholars have shown that "sexuality" is the product of a particular historical discourse, namely, nineteenth-century psy- chiatry (Davidson: 37). The word, and the concept of, sexuality as an intimate feature of who a person is was not part of Augustine's conceptual repertoire. Augustine recognized sex acts and biological sex. The spiritual bodies of the resurrection, he said, will have biological sex, but there will not be sex acts because "sexual intercourse can only take place between mortal bodies" (De bono coniugale 2; Retractationes 2. 22. 1). When he deleted sexual activity from the resurrection, then, Augustine referred to a geni- tally organized, (potentially) reproductive, "use" of the sexual organs, for which there would be no need in a state in which reproduction is unnec- essary because death does not occur. Lacking the concept, Augustine neither explicitly included nor excluded "sexuality" as a feature of resurrection bodies. His descriptions of beauty and enjoyment, however, provide a foundation for identifying in resurrection bodies an implicit sexuality free from the constraints and damages of present sexuality. Did Augustine think that sex was to be</page><page sequence="4">310 Journal of the American Academy of Religion forfeited or fulfilled in the resurrection body? As a simple either-or, the question is unanswerable. I will argue, nonetheless, that Augustine did not deny, and even suggested, that a quality and value we name as "sexu- ality" will be a feature of resurrected "spiritual" bodies. Augustine's ideas of sex, like those of anyone else, were historical con- structs, both privileged and limited by the discourses in which he participated.2 Similarly, my discussion of Augustine's views is historically located, made possible by a discourse founded by Freud and expanded and refined by his postmodern students and critics to produce new perspectives on sexuality, sexual pleasure, and sexual relationships. I will first discuss briefly the discourse within which sexuality came to be seen as an irreduc- ible and defining aspect of human lives; then I will seek to demonstrate that Augustine's most focused mature writings on the resurrection include something like our notion of sexuality. Although he never explicitly discussed the sexuality of resurrected bodies, he scattered clues in sermons and treatises. These can be collected and composed as a post-Augustinian proposal for an ideal sexuality that is not incompatible with, but which extends, elaborates, and refines Augustine's description of resurrection bodies. Freud and his critics suggested ways to articulate an ideal sexuality that goes beyond Augustine's ability to conceptualize such sexuality. THE CONSTRUCTION OF SEXUALITY: FREUD Now we see through a glass, darkly. Then, however, face to face. -1 CORINTHIANS 13:12 No summary can do justice to the nineteenth-century creation of "a new object of medical discourse-sexuality" (Davidson: 69). My aim will not be to provide a summary of Freud's teachings, then, but to gather from it several suggestions that carry forward our understanding of Augustine's construction of resurrection bodies. Freud's most radical innovation was his proposal that "to know a person's sexuality is to know that person, [for] sexuality is the individual shape of the personality," 2 Even more remote from Augustine's conceptual repertoire was the notion, popularized by historian Peter Brown, that sexuality is a "uniquely resonant key" to individual personality, the core "truth" of the person. Brown's interpretation of Augustine anachronistically adopts Freud's account of sexuality as "irremovably at the center of the human person" (1988: 403). Augustine's ideas of paradisical sex, present sex, and the possibility of sex in the resurrection must be explored with greater precision if his thought is to be freed from the preoccupations of scholars dependent on Freud's construction of "sexuality."</page><page sequence="5">Miles: Sex and the City of God 311 a permanent and irreducible aspect of personhood, whether or not that sexuality is ever acted on (Davidson: 21). Beginning in about 1870 psychiatric interest focused on sexual "per- versity," which had formerly been addressed primarily in "treatises of moral philosophy, moral theology, and jurisprudence, not in medicine" (Davidson: 23). Freud's discovery of infantile sexuality emerged as he sought the origins of the so-called "perversions," especially sadomasochism, "inversion" (homosexuality), and fetishism (Freud 1956: 11). He argued that sexuality is not, in the first instance, characterized by genital organ- ization. Rather, genital organization, which establishes a sexual object and sexual goal, is the accomplishment of a process of development. Uncoupling sexuality from a "natural" object (a body of the "opposite" sex) and goal (intercourse) led Freud to identify the origin of "perver- sions" as fixation in unconscious processes of earliest childhood, not in physiology or moral flaws. It was a short step from thinking of "perversions" as rooted in child- hood sexuality to "loosening the bond that exists in our thoughts between instinct and object. It seems probable that the sexual instinct is ... inde- pendent of its object; nor is its origin likely to be due to the object's attrac- tions" (Freud 1953: 146). "Freud's argument, his structure of concepts, leads to the claim that neither the erotogenic zone of the genitals nor the aim of copulation bears any privileged connection to the sexual instinct.... deviations from the aim of genital intercourse appear to lose their status as genuine perversions" (Davidson: 84). In short, "perversions" are neither morally reprehensible nor a disease but simply human-anthropological rather than pathological. "Sexuality," no longer confused with the genitals, can be understood to encompass far more than the fact of one's sex. Freud was the first thinker decisively to abandon Augustine's concep- tual universe in his thinking on sex/sexuality. Augustine's experience had taught him that he was unable, by the use of will power, to subordinate sex to will, the organizing principle of reason and emotion. Freud, instead of attempting to integrate sexual desire, made sexuality itself the organizing principle of the self. Three results, important for our project of understanding Augustine on resurrection bodies, emerged from Freud's reconstruction of sexuality: First, Freud created the possibility of thinking of sex as more than functional. Second, Freud suggested (and his followers have clarified) that genital organization, or "normal" sexuality, entails loss, or narrowing, of sexual possibilities. Third, Freud's idea "that the sexual instinct is made up of components, that it . . . combines a multiplicity of erotogenic zones and aims," extends the field of sexuality beyond genital activity (Davidson: 85). Each of these suggestions will be further considered in the conclusion. Together, they create the possibility</page><page sequence="6">312 Journal of the American Academy of Religion of reconstructing an ideal sexuality that even Augustine might recognize as characterizing resurrection bodies. FREUD'S CRITICS Freud's construction of sexuality was criticized on several grounds in the second half of the twentieth century. Postmodern critics have dis- mantled Freud's insistence on the centrality of sexuality to human per- sonhood. Describing Freud's construction of "sexuality" as a form of power/knowledge that was constructed "so much the better to control the body," Michel Foucault preferred to speak, not of sexuality, but of "bodies and pleasures,". "a certain mode of relation to the self in the expe- rience of the flesh" (157). Arnold Davidson questioned nineteenth-cen- tury psychiatry's assumption that "sexuality is the externalization of the hidden, inner essence of personality" (63). Similarly, sociologist William Simon wrote, "There is no reason to believe that the sexual is universally a major part of the narrative of the self' (120-121). Simon argued further that Freud's focus on genital sexuality as the mark of a person's sexual maturity obscured the extent to which "not all sexuality occurs in recog- nizable sex acts," a suggestion to which I will return (137). Feminist psychoanalytically based critics like Luce Irigaray have dem- onstrated that Freud's account of sexual development incorporates women into a fundamentally male scenario. "Up to now," Irigaray wrote, "nothing can be clearly articulated but the history of the practice of 'male sexuality' with regard to Sexuality" (1974: 22). According to Irigaray, Freud insisted "that the sexual pleasure known as masculine is the paradigm for all sexual pleasure, to which all representations of pleasure can but defer in reference, support, and submission" (1974: 28). Feminists Carol Vance and Linda Williams also contested the dominance of a male construction of sexual pleasure. Feminist film critics Carol Clover, Patricia Erens, Jane Gaines, Miriam Hansen, E. Ann Kaplan, Annette Kuhn, Meaghen Morris, Laura Mulvey, B. Ruby Rich, Kaja Silverman, and others explored women's dis- tinctive sexual pleasure as articulated by race, class, and other variables. Assuming, as did Freud, that sexual identity was central to a sense of self, psychiatrist Jessica Benjamin's 1988 The Bonds of Love proposed an alternative account of sexual development. Benjamin suggested that for both boys and girls, the primary task was not to disidentify with the mother, the first love object, but the mutual recognition of two subjectivities, the mother's and the child's. Her later work contrasted "love objects" and "like subjects." Neither identificatory love, which "incorporates or assim- ilates what is other to self," nor "split complementarities" (love objects) can achieve intersubjectivity (like subjects) (1995: 7): "the other must be</page><page sequence="7">Miles: Sex and the City of God 313 recognized as another subject in order for the self to fully experience his or her subjectivity in the other's presence" (1995: 30).The creation of a "space of dialogue potentially outside the mental control of either of the participants" permits a mutuality of exchange "that allows for and pre- sumes separateness" (1998: 28-29). Social theorists criticized Freud's preference for looking for the origins of sexual behavior in individual development, claiming that heteronormativity and its alternatives are socially constructed. Sex is not a "wild card," a way for individuals to rebel against society and socialization (as Herbert Marcuse, Norman O. Brown, and the gurus of the 1960s taught). Rather, instead of challenging social arrangements, noncon- forming sexual behavior ultimately reinforces those arrangements by making people happy "enough" not to rebel in ways more threatening to the social order. Even so-called "perversions" respond to, rather then undermine, social life. For example, William Simon understood sadomasochism as a reaction against the prevailing social consensus that insists on equality (133). In addition to its inevitable sociality, sexuality also relates directly to material conditions. Elizabeth Grosz pointed out that the concept of desire as a lack to be satisfied is useful to capitalist acquisition" (71), whereas Rosemary Hennessy argued that "localizing sexuality in the body" places it outside history (42).3 Asking why homosexuality, which was illegal in over half of the United States in the mid-1970s, has now become acceptable, John D'Emilio's essay, "Capitalism and Gay Iden- tity," cited two features of late capitalism, wage labor and commodity consumption, as material conditions that permitted the emergence of new sexual identities. The "late nineteenth-century shift to a consumer economy provoked a more widespread acceptance of pleasure, self- gratification, and personal satisfaction that easily transferred to the province of sex" (Hennessy: 103). Teresa Ebert and Rosemary Hennessy protested mainstream feminism's neglect of economics, labor, class struggle, and exploitation in its account of pleasure and sexuality. Mary Hunt's "just good sex" recognized that the privileges of westerners, including "private" sex, depend on the "increasingly sophisticated injus- tice" of the global economy (Jung, Hunt, and Balakrishnan: 164). Maxine Sheets-Johnston proposed an alternative to Benjamin's language-based concept of intersubjectivity. She argued for intercorpore- ality as the basis of relationships, sexuality, and society. Body, or "animate form," she said, precedes and determines consciousness. Critical of SSimon added, "There is little truth to be found in the body as such, and even less truth to be found in the body abstracted from life" (142).</page><page sequence="8">314 Journal of the American Academy of Religion psychoanalytic dependence on language, she claimed that the living body "is a cultural universal ... the common denominator of cultures" (4, 70). Power and politics are rooted in bodies, and "social relations are always intercorporeal relations,... meanings engendered and/or articulated by living bodies" (57). The first task of intercorporeality is "reflecting on what it is like to be that other body ... educating ourselves in the deepest possible sense on what it is to be a human body" (329). Together, these followers and critics of Freud contribute a signifi- cantly revised version of the concept of "sexuality." Historicizing "sexuality" frees the concept for revision so that sexuality can be pictured as social rather than individual, as part rather than essence of the self, as gendered rather than universal, and as embedded in social assumptions and arrangements rather than isolated. After discussing Augustine's idea of resurrected bodies, I return to Freud and his critics in order to construct a post-Augustinian idea of sex and the city (of God). HEAVENLY SEX: FACIE AD FACIEM Take away faith in the resurrection of the dead and the whole of Christian doctrine crumbles. Augustine, Sermon 361. 2 Although philosophers of the Hellenistic and Roman worlds (with the exception of Epicureans) held a doctrine of immortality of the soul, belief in resurrected bodies seemed to them the worst kind of literalistic naivete. Augustine's defense of Christian belief in the bodily resurrection in the City of God was directed at the Platonic philosopher Porphyry, the most recent and respected of the scoffers. Augustine said that Porphyry's advice to "flee all bodies" was intended as a direct rebuttal of the Chris- tian teaching of the resurrection. Augustine's views largely repeat those of his Christian predecessors, but he went beyond scripture and earlier authors to describe a detailed and frankly imaginary picture of the resurrection (Miles 1979). Augustine's speculations on the nature and activities of resurrection bodies spanned the full term of his authorship as a Christian (from De quantitate animae, written in 388, two years after his conversion, to the final book of De civitate dei, written about 425, five years before his death). He drew his theology of the resurrection from St. Paul's description of the bodily resurrection in I Corinthians 15. Accepting his patristic forbears' insistence (against pagans and Gnostics) on the substantiality of resurrec- tion bodies, he felt urgency throughout his career to defend the belief.</page><page sequence="9">Miles: Sex and the City of God 315 Several preliminary considerations must be noted before we explore sex in Augustine's account. First, Augustine did not teach the details he imagined; he taught only that the mortal body would be resurrected to immortality. He invariably attached disclaimers to his discussions of the bodily resurrection, reminding readers of their tentative and imaginary quality: "rash to offer any description of it... yet we cannot keep silence .... I do not know .... I have never seen it with my physical sight .... I cannot say that I see now .... do our best to conjecture." Second, although he addressed his discussion in the City of God to unbelievers, his acknowledged fantasy of the resurrection in book 22 and in his sermons (especially Sermons 240-243; 1993), seem to be for the purpose of enabling and encouraging belief, not convincing philosophical opponents. Third, Augustine's thinking on the resurrection body changed in emphasis from his earliest to his mature writings. In 388 he was content to affirm the resurrection: "We may hold even the resurrection of the body (which some believe too late; others not at all) to be so certain that the rising of the sun, after it has gone down, is not more certain to us" (De quantitate animae 23. 76). A bit later, in 393, his primary concern was to distinguish mortal and resurrection bodies. He used Paul's state- ment, "Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven" to assert that resurrection bodies will not be "flesh," but "body" (Defide et symbolo 10. 24).4 In his Retractions, the review of his writings undertaken shortly before his death, he worried that the passage could easily be interpreted as denying that "these members [and] the substance of the flesh" will be incorporated in the resurrected body (1. 16). After 410, Augustine's interest in resurrected bodies changed. Authors from Paul forward had emphasized discontinuities between present and resurrected bodies, as had Augustine's earlier writings. In his maturity, however, Augustine was eager to identify continuities between present and future experience. His mature writings emphasized repeatedly and in detail the continuity-the concrete fleshiness-of women's and men's present and resurrected bodies (CD 22. 17; 1972). Sermons on the topic reiterated and added detail. Throughout his career his most frequently quoted scripture verse was I Corinthians 13:12: "We see now through a glass darkly; then, however, face to face" ("Videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate; tunc autem, facie ad faciem"). CD 22, his most detailed and sustained discussion of resurrection bodies' capacities and activities, was an extended exegesis of this verse, cited throughout his discussion. From this verse he also drew the frequently used syncrisis: "now . . . then" 4 But see Serm. 362. 14 for Augustine's mature (411 C.E.) interpretation of this passage.</page><page sequence="10">316 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ("nunc... tunc"), a formula that connects, even while it contrasts, present and future experience (1972: 00 22.1). Fourth, Augustine's famous hypothesis about sex before the Fall (CD 14. 23), must not be confused or conflated with his idea of resurrection bodies. Even before the Fall, reproduction was necessary, he said, so that human beings could replace the number of fallen angels. Thus, although marriage and procreation existed, there was "use" of the sexual organs, but no lust was involved. Rather, will took the place of lust, arousing the sexual organs "at the appropriate time and in the necessary degree" (CD 14. 24). Contem- porary physical experience provided the prototype for his speculation, as Augustine described how various muscles and organs of the body can be managed-set in motion or stilled-by will. In the resurrection, however, the situation will be different, for there will be no need for procreation. Three methods directed Augustine's reflections on the doctrine of bodily resurrection. First, the mature Augustine based his fantasy of resurrected bodies firmly on present experience. He imagined resurrection by citing at length-and then subtracting-the painful and negative fea- tures of present bodily life, retaining its goodness and beauty (CD 22. 22, 23). Within the multiple agenda of CD, he repeatedly sorted the dangers and discomforts of physicality from its goodness and beauty, beginning with the rape of Christian women during the 410 C.E. sack of Rome (CD I. 16-29) and ending with his euphoric conjecture that "the eyes of the body will see God" (CD 22. 30). He pictured the resurrection of body as both continuous, and contrasting, with present physical experience. Augustine discussed his second method in Confessions 10. 21 (1963). In this passage he identified "the happy life," even though it did not exist in his memory, by collecting from memory discrete instances of personal joys, vividly experienced, and using them to construct a composite image of the longed-for condition. Any joys will do, "base joys and disgraceful things," as well as "good and worthy" joys. In spite of lacing the text of CD 22 with frequent denials that he knew anything about resurrection bodies, his attempt to imagine them required that he use memories of his body's greatest bliss as a guide to his fantasy. The "old animal body" will be changed, he said (following Paul), to a "new spiritual body" (CD 22.21), but the capacities for pleasure developed in the "old" body will be retained and transformed in the "new" body. Augustine's third method was continuous with, and dependent on, the continuities and distinctions between the old and new bodies. He classified all features (including the genital organs) of present bodies as either for "use" or for "beauty." In more detail than was necessary to make his point, he described the "natural creation" as demonstrating</page><page sequence="11">Miles: Sex and the City of God 317 both utility and beauty. The "miraculous loveliness" of the world, he said, causes wonder, astonishment, and pleasure. The beauty presently visible is permanent, whereas utility applies only to the present. Acquisi- tiveness of all kinds-"use"-will cease. Augustine's model for resurrection enjoyment was vision. Vision, specifically the ability to see beauty, will be retained in the resurrection: "We now see a dim reflection in a mirror; but then we shall see face to face," he quoted repeatedly. Having said in an earlier writing (Epistula 92) that it is silly to imagine that the bodily eyes will see God, Augustine unabashedly contradicted himself: It is possible, it is indeed most probable, that we shall then see the physical bodies of the new heaven and the new earth in such a fashion as to observe God in utter clarity and distinctness, seeing him present every- where and governing the whole material scheme of things by means of the bodies we shall then inhabit and the bodies we shall see wherever we turn our eyes .... It will not be as now, when the invisible realities of God are apprehended and observed through the material things of his creation, and are partially apprehended by means of a puzzling reflec- tion in a mirror .... He will be seen in every body by means of bodies, wherever the eyes of the spiritual body are directed with their penetrat- ing gaze. (CD 22. 29) "The saints will see God in the body": the phrase is ambiguous, but the passage makes it clear that Augustine did not intend to say that God will have an anthropomorphic body, but that the saints' spiritual bodies will see God "wherever we turn our eyes," for "God will be all in all" (I Corinthians 15. 28; CD 22. 30).5 How does this vision of God "in every body by means of bodies" differ from present vision, by which we "could not observe [another's] life without their bodies; but we see it in them, without any possibility of doubt, through their bodies"? Presently, we see life by seeing living bodies. Augustine was adamant that we do not infer that a person is alive from observation of her breath- ing and moving body; we actually see life. It was important to him to eliminate the difference between inferring and seeing because present sight was his model for the claim that resurrected eyes will see God. To see God is to see "life itself," Augustine said elsewhere.6 Although Augustine contrasted present ability to see life with future vision of God, the only SYet in Ep. 92 (408 C.E.), Augustine had said that it is insane to think that the bodily eyes will see God. 6 "And since all those who think of God think of something living, only they can think of him without absurdity who think of him as life itself'; De doctrina christiana 1. 8.</page><page sequence="12">318 Journal of the American Academy of Religion difference he can suggest is that resurrection bodies will have a new and powerfully penetrating (perveniente) intellectual (menti) gaze, extraordinary in its potency (vis itaque praepollentior oculorum), a gaze capable of seeing into the structure and operation of bodies. No longer subject to death and decay, the limbs and organs of the body will reveal their harmony and beauty to this gaze. The internal organs, he said, have a "rational loveliness" more beautiful than "all that gives pleasure to the eyes in the outward form." Acknowledging that no scripture supports this conjecture, Augustine modi- fied his interpretation for "greater ease of understanding," saying that "perhaps God will be known to us and visible to us in the sense that he will be spiritually perceived by each one of us, in each one of us" (CD 22. 24). Having cited in detail the dangers and sufferings of present experi- ence, Augustine began his account of "the good things of which this life is full" with a two-page discussion of procreation. The new living being created by procreation, he said, is "a work of such wonder and grandeur as to astound the mind that seriously considers it, and to evoke praise to the creator" (CD 22. 24). In sermons as here, he cited the miracle of birth as justification for belief in a bodily resurrection: "The God who was able to thrust you out in proper shape from the womb, himself wishes you . . . to believe that he can also bring you alive from the tomb" (1993: Serm. 242A. 2).7 Citing I Corinthians 13. 12, Augustine stated that in the resurrection the "thoughts of our minds will lie open to mutual observation." Elabo- rating on the meaning of "face to face" in Sermon 243, however, he said that, in fact, "those who are there will not recognize each other just because they see faces; mutual recognition will come from a deeper kind of knowledge." So now our thoughts are in the light to each one of us because we know our own. But they are in darkness to our neighbors, because they can't see them. Then however, what you know you are thinking, the other person is going to know too. Why be afraid? Now you want to conceal your thoughts, now you are afraid to publish them; perhaps, I mean, you are sometimes thinking something bad, something dirty, maybe something silly. Then, however, when you get there, you will think nothing but what is honorable, nothing but what is true, nothing but what is pure, nothing but what is sincere. Just as now you wish your face to be seen, so then you will want your conscience to be seen too. (1993: Serm. 243. 5) 7 "It is a greater miracle, so many people being born every day who did not previously exist, than a few having risen again, who did exist"; Serm. 242. 1.</page><page sequence="13">Miles: Sex and the City of God 319 CD 22.30 returns to Augustine's classification of present and future experience. What is to be eliminated? Evil, inactivity and idleness, toil, constraint, decay, necessity, and hidden agenda.s But "no good will be withheld," he insisted. The "goods" he cited are true glory, true honor, and true peace: "God will be all in all," he repeated: "He will be the goal of all our longings; and we shall see him forever and ever; we shall love him without satiety; we shall praise him without weariness." Freedom of the will, the committed capacity to act in the direction of one's greatest good, will continue in the resurrection. Unable to sin, the will is "immovably fixed in a delight in not sinning. The resurrection will ini- tiate an "eternal vacation" (vacabimus in aeternum). "There we shall be still and see; we shall see and we shall love; we shall love and we shall praise." Augustine's "compressed pile of blessings" of present experience included: sustenance of life, the mind and its capacities, the capacity for a good life and the possibility of eternal happiness, the virtues, the arts, the body, and the natural world. All of these "beauties" (except reproduc- tion) will be retained in the resurrection. He insisted that it was not "the body" that Christians should deplore, but the "corruptible body." His sermons employ the same method of sorting the negative from the positive effects of bodies: "What is it about the body that you don't like? .... the body's liability to decay, its mortality? ... The things you like will be there, the things you don't like, won't. What you like comes to life again, what you don't like perishes" (Serm. 242A 3). Sermon 362 takes as its topic "what sort of bodies the saints will have, and what kind of life the just are going to have in the resurrection." The resurrected body of Jesus provided a prototype for Augustine's suggestions about resurrection activities: "Our Lord rose again in the very same body in which he had been buried. Resurrection is what Christians have been promised. So we should be hoping for the same sort of resurrection as in the case of our Lord has preceded the faith of us all" (10). Like the risen Christ and the angels, resurrection bodies can eat and drink, but they do not need to do so: "It's one thing, after all, to do something because you can, another to do it because you have to" (11). Similarly, sleep will not be necessary because there will be no fatigue. Did Augustine suggest that eating and drinking, no longer prompted by physical need, would be done for pleasure in resurrected bodies? This interpretation is made plausible, if not proba- ble, by the frequency with which Augustine characterized the quality of 8 Sermon 242A adds to this list fear, poverty, weariness, and clumsiness. "None of these things will be there, but the body will be."</page><page sequence="14">320 Journal of the American Academy of Religion resurrected life as filled with delight: "Nothing will be lacking for com- plete satisfaction" (31). Noticing whether a feature of human experience surfaces in his imag- ined resurrection body is often a key to Augustine's values. Sex (male and female) appears in Augustine's resurrection of body (CD 22.17); sex acts do not. In Augustine's conceptual universe it was possible to affirm bodies in the resurrection (more or less) "as we knew them" and yet to subtract from them all sexual desires and acts.9 Whatever Augustine omitted from resurrection reward fell into the category of "punishment" (poena reciproca) for the disobedience of Adam and Eve (CD 14. 17). But proof-texts often mislead. The question "is sex part of the punishment or part of the reward?" is too crude; it is both and neither. Augustine sorted the (present) "punishment" of human life from the beauty and pleasure that are part of (resurrection) reward. Augustine said that there will be no lust (libido) or "use" of the repro- ductive organs in the resurrection, but only "enjoyment of one another's beauty for itself alone" (CD 22. 24). His account of pre-Fall sex in CD 14. 23, as well as in his Confessions, helps to explain what he found problematic and disturbing about libido. For Augustine, the damages of present sex included: rape as a practice of war (CD 1. 16-19); domestic vulnerability to unwanted or forced sex (Sermons. 9. 4; 82. 11; 132. 4; 224. 3; 392. 2); unpredictability and uncontrollability, most evident (to Augustine) in impotence (CD 14. 16); urgency or compulsiveness that overrides the ability to choose (Confessions, passim); and feelings of guilt and shame (CD 14.17-18). Sermon 243. 8 adds boredom to his list of the negative possibilities of present sexual experience: "Such is the weakness of the flesh, such is the irksome nature of this life, that everything, however wonderful, ends in boredom." All of these must disappear if resurrection bodies are to "enjoy one another's beauty for itself alone." Beneath and beyond Augustine's objections to particular features of sex was his primary objection that sex does not seem to bring happiness. According to his later and highly interpretive account of his own sexual experience in the Confessions, sexual activity merely "scratch[ed] the itching scab of concupiscence" (Conf. 9.1), bringing little more than the satisfaction of a repetition compulsion. Certainly, Augustine's criteria for 9 Quoting one of Augustine's earliest extant writings, Peter Brown stated: "Sexual love remained, for him, a leaden echo of true delight . . . [he wanted] to behold God's Wisdom in an 'utterly untroubled gaze, a most clean embrace; to see and to cling to Her naked, with no veil of bodily sensation in between' " (Soliloquies 1. 13. 22). Yet surely a "leaden echo of true delight" would not provide an adequate analogy for the vision of God! Augustine's image refuses Brown's interpretation and illustrates the inadequacy of interpretations that do not take into account Augustine's developing views; early statements were significantly modified in his maturity (1988: 394).</page><page sequence="15">Miles: Sex and the City of God 321 happiness were ambitious: intensity and permanence.'0 Sex, he said, notoriously meets one criterion at the expense of the other. I have largely ignored Augustine's stated agenda in order to focus on his methods for imagining resurrection bodies, their activities and their properties. He introduced his speculations with an admonition to those who say that a material body cannot become a spiritual body. His method of using present physical experience as the basis for imagining resurrection, however, works as well for convincing unbelievers as for encouraging believers. The "present state of things," he said, has been cheapened by familiarity, but it is, in fact "much more wonderful than that transition which our philosophers find incredible. Why are we not more violently amazed that immaterial souls, superior to celestial bodies, are bound within earthly bodies, than that bodies, although earthly, should be exalted to abodes which are material, albeit heavenly" (CD 22. 4; emphasis added). The rhetorical beauty and poignant longing expressed in his imaginings indicate that much more was at stake for him than a simple refutation of unbelief. His sense of the simultaneous fragility and consummate precious- ness of bodies directed his interest in their perfection and completion: "I know you want to keep on living. You do not want to die. And you want to pass from this life to another in such a way that you will not rise again as a dead person, but fully alive and transformed, This is what you desire. This is the deepest human feeling" (Serm. 344. 4). The continuity between present and resurrection bodies was based on the astounding miracle of present bodies. The only problem of present bodies is sin, by which bodies have become vulnerable to hunger, thirst, sickness, difficulties of all sorts, death and decay. These ills are not native to bodies; rather, bodies are the helpless victims of the sin of the first parents of the human race. The "real" condition of bodies will be achieved only in the resurrection: "The flesh will rise imperishable, the flesh will rise without blemish, without deformity, without mortality, without being a burden or a weight" (Serm. 240. 3). According to Augustine, intercorporeality (Sheets-Johnstone) as well as intersubjectivity (Benjamin) will characterize resurrection society. Bodies are ubiquitous in Augustine's heaven. God "will be seen in every body by means of bodies, wherever the eyes of the spiritual body are directed with their penetrating gaze" (CD 22. 30). But not a word about sex. Did Augustine think that there would be sex in the City of God? It is time to reconsider Augustine's fantasy of resurrected bodies in the light of a conceptual world-our own-to which Augustine had no access.

William Simon, Postmodern Sexualities, 155. In western cultures, impressions-whether caricatures or accurate descriptions--of Christian negativity toward sex are common. But more fundamental and incontestable than negativity is the unique significance Christianity has placed on sex. Within Christianity, Peter Brown (1988) wrote, sex is a "peculiarly resonant symptom of the frailty inherited by man- kind from Adam's first act of disobedience" (1988: 416).1 Although Augus- tine sometimes referred to Aristotle's complaint that it is difficult to think while engaged in sexual activity, this was not his primary objection. Rather, Augustine regretted that will had little jurisdiction over sexual desire (Brown, 2000). In his experience, as well as in pastoral observation, sexual desire stub- bornly eluded integration. Sex received its significance for Augustine not as "an ultimate, if obscure, truth of the human being," but by frustratingly eluding integration. He found it difficult to praise sex, even when, in opposition to ascetic extremists, he deliberately set out to do so (2001, De bono coniugali). Centuries later, and in a vastly different conceptual universe, Freud made sexuality the organizing principle, the "externalization of the hidden, inner essence of personality" (Davidson: 63). Freud's critics criticized this attribution of significance, objecting that "sexuality is too easily seen as possessing a quality of importance that may not be descriptive of many individuals or most individuals most of the time." A century after Freud, in western media cultures that invoke sexuality to stimulate and sell, sexuality assumes a cultural centrality that is, in other times and places, odd, if not unknown. "As a culture we take sex seriously, perhaps too seriously; in its appearance, something emblematic of 'true' character is assumed to be revealed" (Simon: 133). In Freud's critics, "human sexualities [are] desta- bilized, decentered, de-essentialized; the sexual life is no longer seen as har- boring an essential unitary core locatable within a clear framework ... with an essential truth waiting to be discovered" (Simon: xiv). Freud's critics also extended Freud's description of sexuality as multi- faceted, operating in persons from infancy forward throughout life. "Much that is sexual, much that is intensely sexual, can be experienced " In Augustine's conceptual universe, however, it was not sex that defined a human being, but will, the integration of reason and emotion. In its strongest form, Augustine said, will is love (De trinitate 15. 41); thus, to know a person, one must ask, What does she love? (Enchiridion 31).</page><page sequence="17">Miles: Sex and the City of God 323 without what is commonly regarded as sexual behavior occurring" (Simon: 147-148). The kind of sex Augustine eliminated from the resur- rection pursuits of the saints was genitally organized sexual acts. His integration and distribution of "the sharpest pleasure" in resurrection bodies is similar to the de-centering of sexuality in Freud's critics. Their account provides a broader palette with which to envision sexuality as more inclusive than that of recognizable sex acts. References to the somatic quality of resurrection experience: beauty, pleasure, wonder, amazement, and loveliness are woven through August- ine's text. His requirements for happiness-intensity and permanence-are met in what we may see as the distributed sexuality of resurrected bodies. The primary "organ" of resurrected sexuality is the eyes: "By use of the bodily eyes everyone possesses all that s/he delights to see" (De trinitate 14. 19). Scopophilia, the "perversion" that replaces, rather than acts as preliminary to, genital sex plays a major role in Augustine's account of the resurrection. Sight, for Augustine, was a kind of touch. Plato's theory of vision, adopted by Augustine, pictured a quasi-physical ray of light projecting from the eyes to touch its object: "Rays shine through the eyes and touch whatever we see" (De trinitate 9. 3. 3; Miles 1983: 127). Vision connects viewer and object, establishing a two-way street on which, as the viewer sees the object, the object travels back along the visual ray to imprint itself on the memory. The visual ray theory has long been superseded by more accurate accounts of the physics of vision yet, as an account of the experi- ence of vision, it has validity. "The natural power of optics is not strictly a visual lure; whatever attracts us visually or whatever we long to see is not purely a visual datum but something that encompasses or spills over into other sense modalities, most specifically, touch" (Sheets-Johnstone: 28). Vision involves two different somatic reactions: intensity registers on the skin, and signification registers in modulations in heartbeat and breathing. These somatic reactions give the impression of touch and may explain why Augustine's-and before him, Plotinus's-accounts of the vision of God (the One) culminate in touch. Moreover, the scopophilic vision of resurrection bodies, in Augustine's description, is more like Ben- jamin's recognition of another subjectivity than like voyeuristic sight. In spite of his adoption and constant use of "face to face" to describe the res- urrection's intimate knowledge, Augustine qualified his metaphor. Mutual recognition will occur, he said, "not just because they see faces" but by "a deeper kind of knowledge" (Serm. 243). 12 12 Recall Benjamin's definition of intersubjectivity: "the capacity of the mind to directly register the responses of the other, ... the capacity to recognize the other as an independent subject" (1995: 183).</page><page sequence="18">324 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The second characteristic of Augustine's account of resurrection expe- rience is synesthesia, a flooding of the senses in which "perceptual modes come together in unexpected combinations" to create vivid pleasure (Chidester: 14). As "faintness, weariness, and corruption all disappear," hyperacuity of the senses occurs (In Ps. 43.4). Instead of orgasm, with its notoriously transient intensity, resurrection bodies experience a pan- sexuality in which the whole body is pleasurably sensitized, and "God is all in all" (CD 14. 28; 22. 30). Again, present extraordinary experience pro- vides the template: "You called, you cried out, you shattered my deafness: you flashed, you shone, you scattered my blindness: you breathed perfume, and I drew in my breath and I pant for you: I tasted, and I am hungry and thirsty: you touched me, and I burned for your peace" (Conf. 10. 27). A post-Augustinian resurrection sexuality emerges from the insights of Freud and his followers, an extension of Augustine's fantasy, but not incompatible with it. Challenging both Augustine's narrow conception of sex (as sexed bodies and acts) and modern usage (despite Freud and his critics) by which "sexuality" is used to refer to genitally organized activity, a sexuality of eternally blissful sensuality can be imagined.13 But several of Freud's critics will remain unsatisfied by Augustine's account. Hennessey, Hunt, and Ebert insist that "good sex" can occur only in just societies. Augustine argued that the City of God is a just society in that each is rewarded the appropriate "grade of honor and glory," but his vision of the resurrection did not include a society of equals. He attempted to compensate by saying that in the resurrection, "No inferior will feel envy of his superior .... he will have the compensatory gift of contentment with what he has" (CD 22. 30). Although rewards are unequal, however, women and men will be equal; women, equipped with a "new beauty," will no longer be subject to "use"-male lust and childbearing. What Augustine sought, but did not fully achieve, either in his experience or in his imagined description of the perfection of human- ity, was integrated sexuality. Augustine's twenty-first century readers, nourished on elaborate and unrealistic media depictions of the con- centrated power of genital urgency, may not be content to picture a resurrection with "distributed sexuality." Yet Freud's critics insist that sex and its multiple expressions is part of the continuing process of creating the self, not the centerpiece it became for Augustine due to its intractability, nor the "key" to selfhood identified by Freud. Indeed, as 13 A media/male perspective that leans heavily on a pre-Freudian definition of sex as defined by "object and goal" might interpret Augustine's description of resurrection sex as infinite "foreplay."</page><page sequence="19">Miles: Sex and the City of God 325 sociologist William Simon acknowledged, "Well-integrated individu- als . . . tend to have relatively uninteresting sex lives" (Simon: 150). Apparently, now (nunc) as "then" (tunc) an integrated sexuality distributes pleasure so that it characterizes all experience, yet invites evaluation as "uninteresting" in relation to the focused excitement of sex acts.14 If Augustine's resurrection sexuality is not attractive in the context of the hedonism of American culture, we need to consider who has the luxury of thinking of sex as an unambiguous good-who, in terms of social location, gender, and economic status? For many women and men, now as in Augustine's day, sex is problematic, if not disastrous. Given Augustine's experience as a rape crisis counselor (CD 1. 16-20), it is not surprising that he was reluctant to give sex acts a place in resur- rection society. Yet he described a pan-sexuality from which the painfully urgent focus on genitally organized sexual object and aim have been eliminated and pleasure has been retained. Augustine tried to imagine the properties and capacities of bodies no longer vulnerable to impo- tence, disease, or death. Having no concept of "sexuality" with which to work, he nonetheless described what we would call "sexuality" as a property of resurrected bodies in the city of God. As one of the beauties and goods of human life, this "sharp joy" of human experience belongs to the calmer bliss of resurrection. Reading sexuality in Augustine's idea of resurrection bodies begins to sketch a model that can function to correct and shape present ideas of sex and its role in human relationships. The value of imagining ideal sexualities is that only then can one begin to make "good sex" now. REFERENCES Aristotle 1953 Nichomachean Ethics. Trans. by J. A. K. Thomson. Baltimore: Penguin.
