<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Thought, Fall 2001 53 Technology's Covert Socialization of Children: High-Tech Toys David W. Kritt College of Stateri Island, City University of New York Introduction Early childhood is commonly acknowledged as the apex of imagina- tive pretend play. Newly emergent abilities to represent and transform reality are tested out and used extensively. Play in later childhood and into adulthood is different in character, more rule-bound and systematic, defined as a special occasion, and imagination becomes more disciplined and self-reflective. While these developments allow for greater flexibility and conscious choice in application, the carefree abandon of childhood is more than just a poe≈•s conceit. The porous boundaries between flights of imagination and pragmatic activity provide an opportunity for explora- tion of the possibilities and limits of what later become mundane pursuits. During early childhood, several threads of emerging awareness- of the physical world, oneself, and other people- become entwined. New forms of acting and relating emerge in a context of creative improvisation. In short, child's play is special. This paper examines how, like an endangered species, child's play is at risk under the encroaches of technological dominance of society, and argues that it must be protected. By examining play with a burgeoning class of animatronic toys, we gain insight into what is important about play and what must be preserved. Assumptions about how children perceive and play with these toys are often at odds with their actual interactive capacities and premised upon an inadequate developmental understanding. It is argued that the limited interactive capacities of high-</page><page sequence="2">54 Technology's Covert Socialization of Children tech toys constrain the possibilities for cognitive development, interper- sonal learning, and the quality of relationships that can be formed. Although many of these electronic toys are interactive in a fashion, essentially human aspects of interaction are much diminished. Cultur- ally available technology can have formative implications for children's developing understanding of the social world and themselves. Toys as a Context for Socialization High-tech toys are cultural artifacts that promote particular cogni- tive, aesthetic, and affective abilities in the course of interaction with them (Cole &amp; Bruner, 1971; Laboratory for Comparative Human Cogni- tion, 1983; Vygotsky, 1978). Children's thoughts, feelings, and actions are guided in certain directions rather than others. When intelligence is differently applied to various materials and symbolic media (Werner &amp; Kaplan, 1965), an intriguing implication is that interaction with specific materials contributes to the development of distinct types of intelligence (Gardner, 1983; Luria, 1976). The child attempts to make sense of each interactive exchange with persons or things and is influenced by the interaction. A child playing with blocks learns their properties in the course of manipulation, as well as some elements of planning, expressivity, and personal accomplishment. A toy truck affords fantasy enactment of adult activity, as do dolls of various sorts. A child configures a computer-controlled robotic arm (Lego- LOGO), specifying commands for grasping an object and simultaneously discovering something about space, movement, and computer program- ming. As with all cultural artifacts, the forms of interaction with toys may be internalized as a framework for mental activity (McLuhan, 1964; Salomon, 1979; Vygotsky, 1930/1994, 1978; Wertsch &amp; Rupert, 1993). For individuals, the construction of reality is part of an ongoing stream of experience and activity within a cultural context that gives form to concepts of things and events. In the course of social interaction, individuals acquire insight about themselves, their world, and possibili- ties for being (cf. Blumer, 1964; Mead, 1934/1962). Since a large part of understanding the social world involves attributing meaning to human actions, the acquisition of such understandings is seriously distorted in interactions with high-tech toys. The high-tech toy's approximations of interaction with an animate being are randomly or systematically generated, in contrast to a human playmate or a pet, whose actions are motivated. While play with high-tech toys would not preclude other possibilities for human contact, neither is it preparation for interaction within the social world. It must be recognized as a newly emerging</page><page sequence="3">David W. Kritt 55 developmental context (Kritt, 1992), which is preparation for nothing other than more of itself, that is, interaction with cybernetic machines. Concepts of animacy-inanimacy and personhood are central to the socio-emotional development of children. These concepts are important to both developing individuals and to society, for such determinations are crucial to ascribing purposeful or sentient action. The distinction be- tween animate and inanimate things is commonly considered one of our most basic conceptual distinctions, one which children are aware of at an early age (Carey, 1985; Piaget, 1929/1951). This awareness entails a multifaceted understanding that includes differing behavioral expecta- tions (Gelman &amp; Spelke, 1981) and explanations of causal mechanisms (Gelman, 1989; Springer &amp; Keil, 1991). Yet it is likely that such distinctions are socially constructed and are in the process of changing. Interactive dolls, robots, and virtual pets, especially in their self-an- nounced guise as quasi-biological, sentient beings, occupy an indetermi- nate status as neither living nor completely inanimate. They can both physically represent and behaviorally approximate aspects of animate beings, suggesting flexible boundaries for their categorization. The high- tech toys of the present and foreseeable future do not possess abilities which lead us to ascribe self-conscious autonomy. The toys are merely a simulacrum of human functioning. However, the dual nature of high-tech toys, as both machine and animate being, invites confusion, especially for young children. Some of these toys afford fundamentally new modes of interaction and are not simply flashier variations on traditional toys. There is often a great distance between the image promoted by advertis- ing and packaging and actual characteristics of play with these toys. Interactive high-tech toys may be contrasted with that most tradi- tional of toys, the doll. A similarity in appearance to people, animals, or some approximation (e.g., teddy bears, Elmo) has been a common characteristic of toys imbued with animate properties in the past. The exceptions to the rule are Transformers, toys that change from combat vehicles to robots in various humanoid and animal-like forms (usually insects or crustaceans), presenting the possibilities of humanoid vehicles and machines with humain qualities. Beyond physical resemblance, traditional dolls require the child's imaginative play to approximate any sense of personhood. This is not always so for the new generation of dolls, whose physical dimensions and interactive capabilities differ in several ways. While some toys incorpo- rate both physical resemblance and cybernetic functions, others bear no physical likeness to people or animals, but display cognizant behavior. Virtual pets and keyboard-linked devices display animate qualities such as disembodied voices and interactive capabilities. These toys exhibit a</page><page sequence="4">56 Technology's Covert Socialization of Children measure of intelligence and, perhaps, even the appearance of free-will, signaling to initiate interactions, indicating preferences, rejecting un- wanted attention, and even functioning according to no apparent pre-set pattern. All of these are properties usually associated with animate beings, including pets and other persons, yet differ in significant ways when embodied in high-tech toys. The actual operation of the toys is greatly at odds with their anthropomorphic designation. Although high-tech toys are interactive in a fashion, both the form and content of their communications are considerably diminished. Communication is greatly condensed, with an emphasis on procedural commands. Most can only respond and provide positive feedback to a user's symbolic acts (executed by pushing buttons). For example, the defining feature of engagement with a virtual pet is that constant vigilance and punctual regularity in response to its needs is required. Although they can respond and provide positive feedback, their initia- tions are routinized and acontextual, primarily communicating needs. Such abstraction changes the communicative process itself, so that essentially human aspects of interaction and the possibilities for forming relationships are much diminished. The communicative process is reconfigured in a different way by the Furby, one of the hottest toys introduced in 1998, a six-inch-tall furry creature with an owl-like face and large ears. Initially it utters unintel- ligible sounds in a "language" dubbed Furbish, but gradually it acquires some conventional language by recording its owner's speech, making its utterances more understandable. According to the manufacturer, the toy's computer chip allows it to speak 100 pre-programmed words in Furbish and to acquire approximately 100 words in the user's language. The gradual expansion and recognizability of language mimics some surface features of the young child's language acquisition, creating the illusion that it is a developing being. Furthermore, by incorporating actual language used by the owner, a personalized connection is made. Yet despite this great advance over a previous generation of talking dolls and virtual pets, Furbys are far from achieving elaborated discourse and true inter subjectivity. High-tech toys that bear some physical resemblance to an animate being, as well as animate or interactive abilities, accentuate the blurring of boundaries. Life-like baby dolls move (e.g., "Baby Wiggles") or emit sounds of joy and distress. Other dolls walk or talk. The president of Tyco Preschool, the manufacturer of Sesame Street "Walk and Talk Pals," character dolls that can slowly walk several feet, cites their appeal: "Children see a toy that is just like them- learning to walk and talk" (Gest, 1998). In marked contrast to earlier talking dolls that</page><page sequence="5">David W. Kritt 57 had a fixed repertoire of random vocalizations, "Tickle Me Elmo" progressively responds to repeated handling, and "Interactive Barney" has a broad repertoire of words and songs, and can "coach" young children in basic skills (using drill and practice techniques). Other recent toys include Teletubbies Actimates that can comment on specific videos (via computer connectivity), and Mattel's "My Interactive Pooh," which not only sings, tells stories, and plays games with kids, but also moves its head and mouth while speaking, and includes personal details about the child (entered via computer) in its varied verbalizations. SONTs robotic dog, AIBO, is too expensive to be a child's toy, but is surely a prototype for toys. AIBO can explore, seeks proximity, and expresses happiness and anger. Sensors allow it to respond to touch, color, and distance (SONY style, 2000). Projections for future develop- ments include greater personalization and context sensitivity (Weber, 1998). With refinement of speech recognition capabilities, a child's voice will be able to control toys in complex ways, and the toys will respond to the child in a personalized way. Robotic vision will allow toys to make various discriminations between objects, eventually including the ability to recognize individuals. This will inevitably lead to increasing abilities to respond in accordance with an interaction history and specific contexts, quite possibly even the capacity to differentially respond to specific individuals. Such a degree of unique response would approximate human interaction so closely that it might be confusing not only to young children, but also, at times, to adults. Dolls will also interact with each other in increasingly complex ways. Among toys of the recent past, a Sesame Street character could control an accompanying dog's movements when his palm is pressed; this is really just a disguised control panel. But "Talkin' Tots" is a pair of dolls that can "converse" or sing together in a coordinated way. It is reasonable to speculate that the degree of interactivity will increase, especially with computer and Internet connectivity. The theme of toys "coming to life" is a perennial fantasy in adult-produced entertainments for children, depicted over a generation ago in the movie "Babes in Toyland," as well as in recent movies such as "Toy Story" and "Small Soldiers." However, in the past, children had to make up responses for their dolls and imaginary friends. Even talking dolls did not acknowledge the context, or uniquely respond to the child as an individual. And certainly toys could not interact with each other, except through the child as intermediary. Toys of the future promise to display a degree of agency previously the sole province of animate beings. Furthermore, as toys are made more active and intelligent, the children playing with them are cast in more passive and respondent roles. Play activity is ostensibly extended by toys</page><page sequence="6">58 Technology's Covert Socialization of Children with amazing abilities, but in actuality the child's activity is constrained and channeled to a greater degree than in the past. Technology Toys, and Human Values The values embodied in a toy reflect cultural, social, and individual choices regarding instrumental, as opposed to expressive, orientation, an ideology of containment versus freedom, and nurturing acceptance of fantasy rather than fidelity to approximations of adult reality. Toy design can have subtle but important implications for children's play and subsequent development. High-tech toys divert children from direct exploration of the physical world and diminish opportunities for fantasy play. Dolls and other traditional toys, while implying certain modes of play, are not rigidly programmed. They afford the opportunity for freely improvised play, in contrast to high-tech toys, which are much more circumscribed, so that play is always on the toy's terms, not the child's. This is a very significant difference between the new and old playthings. In contrast to traditional dolls, which serve as a cue for emotional displays, the primary feature of interaction with many high-tech toys is that a child can make them do interesting things. Relationships are reduced to their minimal functional components, and the potential for affect in the relationship is the victim of an extreme reductionism. In the extreme case of the virtual pet, prediction, control, and obligation are the basis of the relationship. Parenting or companionship with a virtual pet has been recast as a management problem. Rigid monitoring is pre- scribed to check on the pet's progress in a range of areas. The care taking role becomes one of functional disengagement, with nurturing emotions replaced by instrumental functioning. The virtual pet offers only informa- tional variables and continual dependence as a stand-in for a truly meaningful (either intellectually or affectively) relationship. This is exac- erbated by the relatively one-sided nature of the relationship. The virtual pet receives, but cannot give, concern and attention. Yet strong social and emotional lessons are communicated, the primary one being a constrained definition of relationship as nurturance with little reciprocity. Such a critique is not limited to virtual pets, but applicable to a number of high-tech toys. In play with these toys, emotion is reduced to relevant variables and contingencies. This functional emphasis in relationships assumes prominence, and emotive aspects of human activities and relationships are treated as disruptive influences external to the primary purpose of activity. Such a pragmatic focus is the embodiment of an ideology of the containment of children's behavior (Kozol, 1975, Polakow, 1982/1992). Activities of the charge, as well as</page><page sequence="7">David W, Kritt 59 the caretaker, are rigidly scheduled in a way that severely limits possibilities for spontaneous experience, exploration, and discovery. A fear of freedom and behavioral excess is inherent in many toys, which have technological abilities that are both a limiting factor and the primary design feature. Although play might entail an altered frame that imposes constraints of its own, either to fit the requirements of an imagined world or to adhere to the rules of a game, its activities need not be directed toward specific or attainable ends. In play, thought and behavior is not bounded by convention or necessity. Piaget (1945/1962) emphasized the assimilatory aspect of play, whereby reality is transformed to fulfill the ideation and needs of the child. Even approximations of realistic role enactment are guided by the child's fantasy play conception of things (Fein, 1981). In contrast, many high-tech toys, by virtue of their design and the appeal of their salient features, guide a child's behavior in a very limited number of ways. The possibilities for idiosyncratic exploration of materials or personal identity, the opportunities for trying on alternate roles and selves (cf. Turkle, 1997), are severely limited during play with high-tech toys. Although a science fiction world is depicted in many of the high-tech toys, the child's activities are simple and procedural (e.g., push a button); the orientation toward that reality is mundane rather than fantastic in the sense of exploring alternate realities. Conclusions The promise of imaginative new play patterns has not yet been fulfilled by high-tech toys. Because they are not designed as general- purpose devices, such as computers or the robots of our imaginations, they limit play to the interactions for which they have been programmed. Consequently, current high-tech toys are changing the nature of play, so that the object, rather than the child's imagination, becomes the focal feature of play. Although the changing nature of play may be a benign reconfiguration of human existence, it is naive to think that it will not have socialization effects. Despite the near impossibility of comprehending the future while it is being constructed in the present, we must entertain the possibility of children acquiring vastly different expectations about the physical and social worlds, and different understandings of themselves, than did children in the past.</page><page sequence="8">60 Technology's Covert Socialization of Children References Blumer, H.
