<plain_text><page sequence="1">Features and News Congress Puts Bioassay Bioassay, the process that tests how substances affect living organisms, is an area fraught with conflict and vulnerable to criticism. Some of the conflicts and criticisms are ethical: The bioassays re- quired as safety assurances by most fed- eral agencies use live animals. Some are scientific: To what extent can a sub- stance's effects on one species be extrap- olated to humans? How much weight should cell and tissue culture bioassays carry in the regulatory process? Lately, however, economic questions are becoming just as important as those of ethics and science. Live animal bioas- says are time-consuming and expensive, particularly when one considers the number of potentially toxic chemicals that enter the environment. Juxtapose ethics, money, many chem- icals, an obvious need to control public exposure to hazardous substances, and an increasing awareness that drugs and other chemicals can be harmful, and the resulting configuration is almost certain to catch the eye of the U.S. Congress. So far, the most attractive notion in terms of new legislation is that of developing "al- ternative" methods of toxicity testing. Cell and tissue culture tests, tests using "simpler" systems like chick embryos, and perhaps eventually mathematical modeling and computer techniques are all viewed as possible methods of aug- menting and replacing animal tests. So far, three bills concerning "alterna- tive" bioassay methods have been intro- duced in the 97th Congress. The one that would result in the most drastic rear- rangement of funds and research is H.R.556, introduced by Robert A. Roe (D-N.J.). The bill would establish a Na- tional Center for Alternative Research, which would "develop and coordinate alternative methods of research and test- ing which do not involve the use of live animals." The center would also develop training programs in these methodolo- gies, oversee animal research to elimi- nate or minimize duplication of animal research, and act as an information re- source for persons in the field. The alter- natives would be developed at the ex- pense of existing testing programs: Each agency would be required to allocate between 30 and 50% of their funding for live animal research and testing to the alternative center. Since animal tests are relied on heavily, this change would give a proportionally greater amount of mon- ey to alternatives, which make up less than 30-50% of the toxicology testing and research in the United States. A second bill, H.R.930, would estab- lish a five-year commission to study al- ternative methods. Funding would be about $750,000 annually. The third, H.R.220, would "promote the develop- ment of research, experimentation, and testing that minimize the use of, and pain and suffering to, live animals." The De- partment of Health and Human Services would be responsible for making grants to investigators. Funding would be about $12 million annually. The persistent congressional interest in bioassay and its regulatory conse- quences led Rep. George Brown (D.- Calif.) to request a comprehensive con- ference on the subject, which would at least have the possibility of functioning in lieu of a congressional hearing. Brown's intent, he told the conference participants, was to "go through a learn- ing process, and see what the possibili- ties for action are based on the state of knowledge." Legislation won't neces- sarily solve the problem, Brown said, particularly if the technology is not as far advanced as the interest in alternative methods of bioassay. The real question, Brown continued, is, "How does a civi- lized society go about making progress in an area fraught with moral questions?" That leads to several other questions: What are the advantages and disadvan- tages of using live animals in toxicity testing? What alternatives are available, and how reliable are they? To what ex- tent could alternative methods replace animal tests? The answers are significant in both economic and ethical terms. The three-day conference, held 18-20 February in Washington, DC, was not intended to produce any sort of consen- sus statement. Nevertheless, there was fairly widespread agreement, even among those with the most serious ethi- cal opposition to animal use, that the most practical goal at the moment is not that of eliminating animal tests entirely, but replacing them wherever possible. Also, many participants emphasized that alternative methods-cell culture, math- ematical modeling, etc.-that could not stand alone could nevertheless be used to screen chemicals for toxicity. This could lead to a more sparing use of live animals, since they would be used only for bioassays on those chemicals with the greatest potential toxicity. Restric- tion, regulation, and partial replace- ment-not total elimination-dominated the discussion. The conferences not only summarized research and progress on alternative methods, it also provided participants with the latest information on live animal research, and the federal government's efforts to consolidate toxicity testing and improve the process by which toxic sub- stances are regulated. April 1981 I I I ? ?/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-.~ 287</page><page sequence="2">The National Toxicology Program, es- tablished in 1979, is one means of coordi- nating toxicology research. In addition, the Interagency Regulatory Liaison Group is trying to eliminate duplication of animal tests by establishing common acceptable standards for the regulatory agencies. The liaison group, which has no regulatory power, includes represen- tatives from the Food and Drug Adminis- tration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Occupational Safe- ty and Health Administration. Since its inception in 1977, the group has sur- veyed the agencies, and identified the toxicity tests that they use in common. The group found that it is sometimes necessary to conduct animal tests twice on the same substance in order to meet the standards of two agencies, according to Victor Morganroth, who described the group's work to the conference partici- pants. This practice is wasteful; the group agreed that they should be able to settle on a common set of standards. But, given the vast array of rules, regula- tions, and informal "guidelines," Mor- ganroth said, "our task seemed insurmountable.' Nevertheless, the group has made some progress. Since the tests are re- quired for marketing and regulation, the agencies need some "field of valida- tion," currently provided by animal tests. Animal tests are not without prob- lems, but alternative methods use sub- jects even further removed from the hu- mans who will eventually be exposed to the substances. "It's hard to justify ex- trapolating from a rodent test, let alone a bacterial test," Morganroth said. So far, the group has succeeded in coordinating standards for an "acute eye irritation protocol," one example of which is the much-publicized Draize test. The agreed-on procedure requires testing only three animals, instead of six, unless the substance is intended for use in or around the eye. If the first three animals tested produce equivocal re- sults, three more animals are tested. There are other restrictions, too: No corrosive substances or known irritants should be tested, and strong acids and bases should be assumed to be irritating. The process of arriving at "mutually acceptable standards" is not quick. First, the group develops a testing proc- ess that is acceptable to its members. This is then submitted to the agencies. After agency comment and approval, the procedure is submitted for public com- ment, undergoes further revision if nec- essary, and finally, is published in the Federal Register. The group is studying not only acute toxicity testing, but also chronic and subchronic toxicity, and carcinogens. Whenever possible, the group is trying to adopt the guidelines used by the inter- national Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), based in Paris. Four of the acute tests that the group identified as "commonly acceptable" to the aencies are the same as those used by OECD. Both OECD and the liaison group are establishing procedures whereby test guidelines can be updated as improved methods be- come available. OECD is two years ahead of the U.S. group in the area of in vitro toxicity testing, Morganroth said. Richard Griesemer, director of biology at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, also expressed the opinion that whole animal tests are likely to remain of paramount importance in toxicity testing for some years. Of the "near-term prospects" for replacing animal tests with in vitro and other methods, Griesemer commented, "I view it as not very encouraging in the short run." In vitro methods are ex- tremely useful for some toxicity test- ing-cytotoxicity, metabolism, and ma- lignant transformation, for example. But they have serious limitations, too. It would be difficult to culture cells from all the parts of the body that might be affected by a substance. And .in vitro tests cannot reveal a whole host of acute signs and symptoms-vomiting, blink- ing, skin rashes, etc. Like many other researchers, Grie- semer is well aware of the complications and drawbacks inherent in animal test- ing. The process itself is complex: First, the animals receive a single dose of a substance and are observed for prob- lems. Next, they are given repeated doses for a period of time, usually 14 days. Then, to test effects on organ sys- tems-long-term toxicity-the animals receive the substance for between 90 and 180 days. Finally, the investigators look for progressive, long-term effects by giv- ing the animals the substance for their entire lifespan. The animal tests are not "absolute predictors" of toxicity, Griesemer said. Animals may react differently from hu- mans to a substance, and reactions may also vary among nonhuman species. The effects of low doses of a chemical are particularly elusive; detecting these ef- fects requires that enormous numbers of animals be exposed. Griesemer cited one particular chemical that would have re- quired 80,000 mice to detect a 1% cancer rate. Such low-dose carcinogens create the most hair-raising regulatory prob- lems because, under the Delaney Clause, any substance that is carcinogenic must be banned. Nevertheless, it is possible to "review and assess" the use of animal tests, with an eye to reducing their use as much as possible. With improved and standard- ized tests, good guidelines, and im- proved laboratory practices, toxicity testing and research could shift some of the burden away from live animals, Grie- semer said. There are also submamma- lian species that could be used more than they are at present; most regulatory agencies require data from tests on mam- mals. This might reduce some of the cost, but the ethical problems would remain. (In bioassay, the term "animal" is used with somewhat less precision than a zoologist or other scientist might like.) Submammalian species testing will probably develop into a more important method, but will need to go through the same acceptance process that animal tests did, he said. One audience member pointed out that, in demanding that alter- native bioassay methods be standard- ized, researchers and regulators were demanding a precision that animal tests couldn't provide. Unlike other speakers, who called for large increases in funding for alternative methods, Griesemer said that only a moderate amount of funding could be put to good use in developing and research- ing short-term tests. This is so, he ex- plained, because there is a lack of prom- ising avenues of research as well as a shortage of trained researchers. The Primate Problem Primate use presents one of the thorni- er problems in the field of bioassay, and among primates the chimpanzee is per- haps the most problematic. Alfred M. Prince, head of the virology laboratory at the New York Blood Center, described some of the dilemmas involved in chimp use. He also proposed a sort of "Chimp Bill of Rights" to ensure that these ani- mals receive the same consideration as humans in a research setting. Problems arise, Prince said, because there are areas of biomedical research for which the chimp is a uniquely suit- able subject. Chimps are very similar to humans; indeed, their place in the animal kingdom is somewhat blured. Chimps have "human" skills and traits, such as toolmaking and cooperative BioScience Vol. 31 No. 4 288</page><page sequence="3">hunting; they appear to have an incest taboo; and there is one report of a chimp creating representational art. They use a mirror for self-recognition, which some subnormal humans are not able to do. Biologically, the chimp differs from hu- mans very little. The genetic differences, Prince said, are mostly translocations and inversions. Type A blood cells trans- fer from chimp to human, and a chim- panzee kidney survived for nine months when transplanted into a human. Chimpanzees are also an endangered species; in the wild, populations are be- coming increasingly sparse. In the USA, there are approximately 1200 to 1500 chimps in zoos, breeding facilities, and living as pets. In 1979, there were 79 chimps born in captivity. The conditions in which chimps live in captivity range from fairly good to very bad, Prince said. Chimps have been particularly useful to humans in virology studies. Without chimps, the hepatitis B vaccine probably couldn't have been developed a mere 10 years after the hepatitis B surface anti- gen was identified. Hepatitis B is an extremely serious health problem global- ly. In addition to the acute cases, there are probably several hundred thousand chronic carriers, who have a high risk of getting liver cancer. The preliminary safety studies for the hepatitis B vaccine were carried out on chimps; of the 200 animals used, only one, which had been immune-suppressed, died. Chimps are also very important in procedures to test blood derivatives, such as factor 8 (antihemopheliac) and factor 9. They may also contribute to studies of human tumor viruses, many of which are rigidly species-specific. In or- der to study these disorders, researchers need a susceptible species. The chim- panzee may be it. Chimps are often used in behavioral research as well, including the somewhat controversial language studies that have been carried out in recent years. The chimp's usefulness raises pro- found ethical problems, Prince said. "It may be an anthropomorphic conceit to eliminate chimps from the [human] spe- cies. Chimps should be given the same consideration as humans." He outlined a proposed "Chimp Bill of Rights" that would, if followed, ensure certain basic practices: 0 Chimps must be acquired in a hu- mane manner, which eliminates com- mercial importation completely. The fa- vored way of acquiring live chimps was, for many years, to kill the mother chimp, then capture the infant. Prince and his colleagues, who have been working in Liberia, have employed trained hunters who used anesthetic darts. They stopped because Liberian farmers are already prone to shooting the chimps that invade their plantations. (The farmers, it should be noted, first invaded the chimps' forest habitat by following the lumber compa- nies into the otherwise inaccessible for- ests.) Currently, the researchers acquire their chimps from other sources, Prince said. They find them in villages, general stores, etc., in a miserable state. "It is obvious that, if we don't take them, they'll die. So we take them," Prince said. They pay a very small price for the animals to discourage anyone from cap- turing them and selling them for profit. Prince and colleagues will also assume responsibility for the cast-off pets of ex- patriates and others. In addition, the researchers have been offered breeding- age chimps from European sources. * Once in captivity, chimps must be maintained in humane conditions, with opportunity for play, socialization, and learning. Too often, Prince said, chimps are stuck in small cages with nothing to do. * The investigator must assume the re- sponsibility for lifetime care of the chimp. He or she may not plan to use the chimp as a research subject indefinitely; nevertheless, researchers must make plans for long-term care. * No chimpanzee investigations should be carried out without prior review, pos- sibly including one by a clinical investi- gations committee similar to the human subjects committee. Prince and colleagues are establishing a chimp colony in Liberia, where the problem of care is simplified by the tem- perate climate. The chimps there are left with their mothers until the age of one year. They are kept in outdoor cubes in groups of two-four, or are put on a 5- hectare island. The animals no longer needed for breeding are returned to the wild after being rehabilitated. Janice Carter, who has worked extensively in this field, is assisting in the rehabilitation process. Simplify, Simplify The chimpanzee represents one end of the bioassay spectrum. At the other end, researchers are using so-called "simpler systems" and methods of computer and mathematical modeling. Chick embryos are one possible simpler system for stud- ies of the central nervous system. Stata Norton of the University of Kansas School of Medicine described one set of experiments in which once-irradiated chick embryos were given morphine, then followed and compared to control embryos for behavior changes. Norton cited this as an example of how simpler systems might be used. There are advan- tages: no maternal influences during de- velopment, low cost of purchase and maintenance, and each egg is, in effect, an independent observation. But there are disadvantages, too, and questions that remain unanswered, like their pre- dictive validity. "That is a question," Norton said. "That is a problem." The only way to establish validity with these and other simple systems is to compare them to more complex systems, i.e., adult organisms. Consequently, the simple systems repesent a refinement of methodology; they will not lead to the abandonment of more complex methods. As Norton pointed out, "It's difficult to have alternatives that eliminate the cen- tral nervous system." One cannot elimi- nate the "whole-animal studies" here, either. One of the most popular in vitro meth- ods has been the Ames test, named for developer Bruce Ames. Joyce McCann, who has worked with Ames, pointed out that the Ames test and nearly 100 other short-term bioassays "gave the illusion that the problem might be easy." It isn't; the short-term tests still need validation, and the results must be compared to whole-animal tests. They do offer signifi- cant advantages over whole-animal tests: They are much less time consum- ing and cost only a fraction as much. They are best used in batteries, McCann said: three or four short-term tests to- gether. Even with this safeguard, howev- er, both false positives and false nega- tives still occur. Short-term tests, cell cultures, com- puter models, etc., are perhaps best used as screening methods, many speakers agreed. They are very useful as a way of deciding which chemicals should be test- ed on whole animals. Some tests for acute toxicity may eventually replace whole animal tests; John McCormack of Johnson &amp; Johnson described a recently developed in vitro test that may offer an alternative to the Dreize test. The assay uses rat mast cells, and so far has been highly effective in predicting results in the Dreize test. But not all classes of compounds can be tested using mast cells. April 1981 289</page><page sequence="4">Ethics Unresolved The conference was convened to dis- cuss the state of the art. But "ethical questions lie beyond and behind state-of- the-art questions," according to Thomas Regan of the Department of Philosophy and Religion, North Carolina State Uni- versity. "There is an institutional 'catch- 22' against developing alternatives," Re- gan said. "We agree that nonanimal tests would be acceptable if they were reli- able, but money is necessary to develop reliable tests. But since it is hard to get funding for unreliable tests, we have few nonanimal tests of scientific merit." Meanwhile, Regan said, researchers must remember that "biological differ- ences don't mark moral boundaries." The animosity that once characterized most discussions of animal bioassay was largely absent from the NIH meeting, which numerous participants found an encouraging sign. Thomas B. Clarkson of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina described the situation in terms of an issue and a nonissue. The Update Graduate Science Education Slumps, Too Science education as a discipline suffers from a lack of direction, declining fund- ing, shrinking enrollment, and profes- sional isolation of researchers from one another and from other disciplines, ac- cording to a new study. Carried out by Robert Yager of the University of Iowa, and funded by the National Science Foundation, "Status of Graduate Pro- grams in Science Education in the U.S. 1960-1980" is a survey of the 35 major graduate programs that train science teachers. It is the second report lately to conclude that U.S. science education is in trouble; in late 1980, a joint National Science Foundation-U.S. Department of Education report dubbed most Ameri- cans "scientific illiterates" (BioScience December 1980). Science education was virtually eliminated from the President's budget, released in March. Science education emerged as a dis- tinct field around 1960, so the report is essentially a summary of the discipline's history, progress, and prognosis. In 1980, the report says, science education nonissue, he said, is whether it's a good thing to use nonanimal systems if they are effective. The answer, of course, is yes. The issue is: How do we get these systems? "Legislation won't do it," Clarkson said. "They must compete with other scientific ideas." As William Raub pointed out in his summation at the end of the meeting, the purpose of the conference was not to search for consensus, but to sharpen distinctions. A polarity, in fact, exists, Raub said, although the adherents to both views have become far less dogmat- ic in recent years. The conference at least opened up communications be- tween the groups. It also had several more concrete re- sults. A "proceedings" volume will be published to be used as a resource for future planning. In addition, Raub said, there is a need for a forum concerned with testing, testing methods, and the scientific basis for testing. We need to look at what we're measuring and why, and at the strengths and limits of the tests. We need to look at cost in terms of reached a "crisis" after 5-10 years of gradual deterioration. Between 1960 and 1970, the discipline flourished; both funding and enrollment increased. But the last decade has seen declines in en- rollment and outside support. "The number of faculty members, support staff, and graduate assistants has de- creased during the past five years," the report says. "In a similar fashion, the level of outside support for student pro- grams, for in-service teacher education, and for curriculum development and re- search has decreased dramatically." The universities have increased their support as external support dropped, but the "internal support" for graduate students has declined in the last five years. Other areas also indicate a "problem/ crisis" in graduate science education. Nearly half of all graduate programs in science education are subsumed within curriculum and instruction departments in colleges of education. Rather than assuming more independence as the field established itself, the departments be- came less autonomous. There has been a decrease in the number of faculty, with a parallel decline in the number of special- ized areas. Research is characterized by too many "one-shot" studies, and there is little evidence of cooperative research and adequate communication between centers. There have also been significant changes in employment patterns for money, time, and animal lives. And we need to look more closely at research opportunities for the future. The forum should involve government agencies, in- dustry, and private citizens. Raub suggested that the Office of Sci- ence and Technology Policy would have the scope to set up such a forum. He also encouraged all agencies and other groups to consider the "three R's": replace- ment of current assays, refinement of current tests, and reduction in the amount of tests. Raub also said that he would raise the issue of chimp protec- tion, keeping in mind the possibility of creating a review board. He likened the current changes in attitudes toward ani- mal research to those changes that have occurred toward humans. Until a mere 15 or 20 years ago, it was common practice to use incarcerated or mentally retarded persons as experimental sub- jects. In another 20 years, we may regard our current methods as "biologically na- ive," Raub said. "Neither science nor custom stands still." -Susan Walton graduates in science education: Fewer have been employed by school districts in recent years, and employment in health fields, government, industry, and other "nontraditional" areas has also dropped. Perhaps most fundamental of all, the status report identifies a "dis- agreement as to the nature of and prior- ities for the discipline of science education. The report recommends several "next step" actions; a crisis is a turning point, and things could get better or worse. The recommendations suggest: * developing a better definition of the discipline of science education; * ameliorating the "fractionalization" within the field, which affects research, teaching, and institutions; * establishing new research proce- dures to coincide with the new goals and definitions of the field; * establishing better connections be- tween research centers, education agen- cies, and schools, and developing net- works for cooperative research; and * expanding areas of concern beyond teaching science in schools ("The whole population is largely illiterate with re- spect to science."). The report is intended to provide base- line information for any future actions or policy changes in the field of graduate science education. BioScience Vol. 31 No. 4 290</page></plain_text>
