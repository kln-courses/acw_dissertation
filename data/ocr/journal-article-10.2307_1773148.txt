<plain_text><page sequence="1">Texts Joseph Margolis Philosophy, Temple Abstract I link the "textuality" of the world to interpretive practices regard- ing familiar texts and the like. I examine the world's textuality through an analysis of views advanced by Kant, Wittgenstein, and Derrida principally. However, the world is not merely textualized in a holist sense, but is also a domain of determinately many texts. I take a text to be anything apt for inter- pretation, and I examine whether and how natural phenomena and artworks may be treated alike as texts. Here, I consider the views of Kuhn, Danto, Davidson, Beardsley, Harold Bloom, and Gadamer, with an eye to the reality of texts, the objectivity of interpretive judgments, and the logical features dis- tinctive of interpretive work. I conclude by showing an intrinsic connection between interpreting literary texts and interpreting ourselves as texts. 1 Texts are artifacts apt for interpretation, and actions and artworks are the paradigms of intrinsic texts. To make the point thus, without preamble, postpones the inevitable objections for only a moment. Is nature an artifact, for instance? Are the shavings of a hacksaw artifactual in the same pertinent sense that a novel is? How apt for interpretation must anything be to be apt enough? Are human selves texts, then, seeing that they interpret them- selves? Are they artifacts for that reason, being interpretable, able to transform themselves by self-interpretation and conformable deeds? These are difficult questions, but nothing compels us to withdraw our claim. Our motto seems apt enough. Consider a second pronouncement now, a notorious one that has Poetics Today 14:1 (Spring 1993). Copyright ? 1993 by The Porter Institute for Poetics and Semiotics.

Derrida would say that he is not affirming anything here: his words are not intended to make a statement. Hence, they are not an alternative to our own. And yet, there is a statement that could easily be drawn from Derrida's utterance to supplement our own. There is no "referent or... transcendental signified" (ibid.), he says, that (as we might say) is "untexted" in a predicative sense. There is nothing that is "de hors-texte": not that there is nothing that is outside any deter- minate text, even an all-inclusive text (the world, say), only that there is nothing that is not textualized (nothing that can be firstfound within some textual space) that can also be linked, referentially or legitima- tively, to what is completely unaffected by similar textual or linguistic forces. It is not, for Derrida, that there is a supreme text, hence nothing outside it; it is rather that the world we confront is already textually infected, and any effort to escape-to what "really" exists, to things in themselves, to some ultimate referent unaffected by the textualizing habit of our language-is epistemically hopeless. There is nothing that we could contact in that way: which is not to say that there is nothing outside any text. The expression "de hors-texte" is a predicate, not a quantifier ranging over an empty class (or a counter joining quantifier and predicate), should we insist on treating Derrida's utterance as an assertion. As the artificer and exemplar of deconstructive prose, Derrida would never assert such a second-order truth. But Kant and Witt- genstein were quite willing-for entirely different reasons-to go the extra mile. "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world," says Wittgenstein (1955: 6.5), in the Tractatus. Unlike Derrida, Witt- genstein says that this is so, although of course he also says, at the close of the Tractatus, "My propositions [including the one quoted above] are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them" (ibid.: 6.54). Furthermore, what he asserts points to what can only be shown (zeigen), not said (sagen)-in the sense in which the solipsist could correctly say that the limits of my language mean the limits of my world: in the sense, that is, that what he says means (meinen) what can only be shown but not said (ibid.: 5.6.2). Wittgenstein also makes it clear that it is for this reason that "no part of our experience is also a priori" or necessarily not otherwise (ibid.: 5.634) and that "the subject [of experience and knowledge, rather like the eye itself in the field of sight] does not belong to the world but . . . is a limit of the world" (ibid.: 5.632). Here, Wittgen- stein and Derrida converge, surprisingly, to defeat Kant, whom they obviously follow, in favoring an orientation (if not an explicit philo- sophical truth) that we may put in the following way: the "world" is</page><page sequence="3">Margolis * Texts 195 never other than a "languaged" world, and language is never other than a "worlded" language, and this indissoluble symbiosis affects as well the cognizing subject who uses language to make claims about the world. "The world and life are one," says Wittgenstein in the same context (ibid.: 5.621): "I am my world" (ibid.: 5.63). Now, then, our original motto must be understood in this sense: "Texts are artifacts apt for interpretation"-in a texted world ad- dressed by a worlded text. This is true not only of our first-order statements (about artworks, say, or actions, or even physical nature), but of our second-order, philosophical, legitimative, even so-called transcendental discourse as well. Wittgenstein and Derrida are unnec- essarily (even inconsistently) extravagant: for we cannot admit first- order discourse without second-order discourse; and we need admit only that second-order discourse (critique) is similarly not "de hors- texte"-contrary to what Descartes and Locke and Kant and Husserl and the structuralists supposed (to remind ourselves of the standard targets of deconstruction and philosophical therapy).1 Derrida is careful to say that his deconstructive intervention is not meant to interfere with, or even to preclude, the pertinence of dis- ciplined interpretations of individual literary texts-a point that his more radical partisans have completely failed to notice. This moment of doubling commentary [that is, criticism that, by inter- pretation, says what a writer is said to have said in what he wrote, hence "doubling"] should no doubt have its place in a critical reading. To recog- nize and respect all its classical exigencies is not easy and requires all the instruments of traditional criticism. Without this recognition and this re- spect, critical production would risk developing in any direction at all and authorize itself to say almost anything. But this indispensable guardrail has always only protected, it has never opened, a reading. (Derrida 1976: 158) As he goes on to explain, interpretation is quite necessary and legiti- mate, but it cannot defensibly presume to speak "de hors-texte"; and deconstruction "offers" (or "imitates," as by a kind of joke) "a justifi- cation of my principles of reading [that is] entirely negative, outlining by exclusion a space of reading that I shall not fill here: a task of read- ing" (ibid.). Deconstruction is not, therefore, more than the extreme philosophical therapy of Wittgenstein's Tractatus (not to be confused with the therapy of the Philosophical Investigations, although the two are linked) is, a theory of interpretation; but it makes room for one- or many. Once we say this, we cannot deny that the world is a text-hence, an artifact. But that cannot be true in any simple sense. What it shows 1. For a more sustained account of this thesis, see Margolis (1986: chap. 11). The argument suggested exposes the related extravagance in Rorty (1979).</page><page sequence="4">196 Poetics Today 14:1 is that we must be speaking of texts and artifacts in several different senses. Certainly, for one thing, man cannot possibly be thought to have created the world ex nihilo; the artifactuality of the world can only signify the indissoluble (post-Kantian) symbiosis of world and word, the intelligible world that Derrida and Wittgenstein indicate, which frees us permanently from the (Kantian) enchantment of a noumenal world determinately structured, somehow, but inaccessible. The world is interpretable because it is intelligible-at least. It is a text or an artifact in the sense (the minimally viable Kantian sense) that "il n'y a pas de hors-texte"; "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world." So the "textual" reading of the world actually forestalls-ironically, now-any merely "idealist" conception of reality. That, after all, is the Kantian heritage, the verdict that there cannot be any compelling dis- junction between the realist and idealist symbiosis. Correspondence theories are realist only in the sense that they are noumenally com- mitted-illicitly, of course, on the argument. It would, for instance, not be unfair to say that this is the perplexing point of T. S. Kuhn's somewhat florid pronouncement: "Lavoisier . .. saw oxygen where Priestley had seen dephlogisticated air and where others had seen nothing at all. [That is,] as a result of discovering oxygen, Lavoisier saw nature differently. And in the absence of some recourse to that hypo- thetical fixed nature that he 'saw differently,' the principle of economy will urge us to say that after discovering oxygen Lavoisier worked in a different world" (Kuhn 1970 [1963]: 118). Kuhn's extravagances need not detain us. They have obviously em- barrassed Kuhn himself. He had never managed to reconcile the rela- tivity of paradigms to the inclusiveness of the "world" that "contains" his plural "worlds." Still, that does not disturb the textuality of the world; on the contrary, it identifies one of its inescapable puzzles, teth- ered, in Kuhn's sense, to the discontinuities of paradigm shifts. But that is still enough to point to the inconclusiveness of a well-known in- tended criticism of Kuhn's "idealism" by another late Kantian who had been obliged to concede, slowly but surely, the increasing convergence between his own "realism" and that of Kuhn's (and even Feyerabend's) "idealism"-namely, Hilary Putnam. There remains the difference (between them), of course, over just how to place invariance and incommensurability conceptually within the symbiotized space they share; but that is a matter that cannot itself now be noumenalized or, a fortiori, that cannot now disallow the sense in which the intelligible world is an artifact and a text.2 2. See Hilary Putnam (1987: Lecture 1, Lecture 2, particularly regarding the so- called Dedekind cut; see also pp. 64, 86). The originally more extreme criticism, which presupposed a rather more robust realism favoring Richard Boyd's views,</page><page sequence="5">Margolis * Texts 197 The kernel of what is important in this sense of the world's textu- ality is simply what captures the impossibility of drawing a principled disjunction between theory and observation at least, as well as the will- ingness to admit that if any network of conceptual categories fits and facilitates our inquiry and action in any sector of life, then there are bound to be indefinitely many such networks that will do so; moreover, the assessment of their fit will itself be hostage to the same symbiosis presupposed in making the admission. In that sense, even where physical nature is expressly denied inten- tional or intensionalized properties of the sort normally assigned to (intrinsically) interpretable things (e.g., artworks and actions), nature is interpretable by virtue of that symbiosis. Hence nature is artifactual (without being merely "ideal") in the sense that, in late twentieth- century thought, we have retreated permanently (in cognitive terms) from a noumenal world to a phenomenal world (where "phenomenal" signifies a contrast with a [now] recognizably illicit alternative). This redeems the benign sense in which Kuhn speaks of different "worlds," but it does not resolve the conceptual difficulty over which Kuhn and Putnam contend. It also explains the sense in which physical nature is open to inter- pretation. It is a dual sense: first, it signifies the sense in which physical phenomena (the geological strata of the Olduvai Gorge, for instance, said to be "significant" in regard to man's evolution) are construed as instantiating this or that explanatory theory; and second, it signifies the sense in which physical phenomena are already, antecedent to any such explanation, symbiotically so "languaged"-intelligible-that ex- planatory moves of the first sort properly apply to them. To say that the world is already, ineluctably, an artifact is to favor the second sense, the sense in which the world always appears, is always already present, as humanly interpreted: where, that is, there is no difference between thus appearing and being thus interpreted. "We are our world," as Wittgen- stein might have said, if he were not already quite so preoccupied with solipsism. To be "interpreted" in this sense is merely to be intelligible, to have been already so ordered via the symbiosis mentioned as to be, in addition, interpretable, in accordance with the first sense given. That sense, the first theme of the dual notion of nature's textuality, is itself parasitic on a much more familiar conception of interpretation and textuality. We had better take a closer look at it. appears in Putnam (1978: Lecture 2 [The John Locke Lectures, 1976], particularly at 22-24). The reference to Boyd (by Putnam himself) is to Boyd (forthcoming), I believe.</page><page sequence="6">198 Poetics Today 14:1 2 Interpretation in this more usual sense, in the sense that includes, or at least matches, the first branch of the dual sense just sketched, invokes two, rather different, complex sorts of distinction that must be harmonized with one another: first, that of the general resources of enunciative discourse-reference and predication; second, that of the nature of specifically interpretable things, of things deliberately constructed to be interpreted-texts, or, more narrowly, artworks. In short, the "usual" sort of interpretation is discursive, addressed to dis- tributed things. Interpretation in the "symbiotized" sense is not. It is holistic, undifferentiated, concerned with what may be called the textual (but never more than implicated) "preparation" (or preforma- tion) of the world as an inclusive domainfor distributed interpretation. The world is a text, in the symbiotized sense, in being intelligible, not in being isolable in any way from the global conceptual resources of human understanding (whatever they may be and however they may be changed). Contrary to Kant, they cannot be discerned except under the con- straints of the same symbiosis-hence they are always already pre- formed, prejudiced, blind in some insuperable respect to pretensions of completeness, invariance, necessity. The would-be table of our con- cepts is horizontal, therefore, never more than a contingent moment in the supposed history of interpreting our power of interpretation. The process of their recovery is endless and groundless, forever "story- relative."3 This is just the point, of course, of redeeming Derrida's and Wittgenstein's remarks (against their own judgment) as explicit legitimative constraints on first-order discourse. The world is, as well, a domain of determinately, even variably, differentiable texts, in that whatever we find in the world (physical phenomena or phenomena not characterizable merely or ever as such) is, because of the global symbiosis indicated, already prepared for in- terpretation. These phenomena are interpretable in that they have been rendered texts, rendered intelligible; they are artifacts in that they belong, distributively, as texts, to our symbiotized world; and they are actually interpreted, discursively, in that some meaning or signifi- cance is responsibly assigned to them. They are texts, distributively, because they belong, globally, to a (textually) symbiotized world. (Call that thesis [A]: it is clearly not enough.) Now, it is also true that distributed things may be interpreted in two further, entirely different ways: in one (B), they may be assigned a cer- tain sense, meaning, significance, a symbolic or rhetorical or semiotic 3. In P. F. Strawson's (1959: 18) felicitous phrase.</page><page sequence="7">Margolis * Texts 199 function relationally, that is, only by way of our associated interest in them relative to some theory or conception that we apply to them; in the other (C), they are said to possess, or to have reasonably imputed to them, intrinsically, a sense or function. The difference is this: in the relational sense (B), it matters not at all what the supposed nature of these distributed referents may be since their significance is assigned as a result of our contingent interest in them; in the intrinsic sense (C), they must be supposed, already, to have a "nature" suited to such ascriptions, that is, there must be some conceptual "adequation" be- tween what we predicate of them in this way and the kind of thing they are.4 For example, a pencil may be construed (interpreted) as a clue to the solution (the explanation) of a murder: "its" interpreted significance is relationally assigned in accordance with our using an explanatory schema in which it figures in the explanandum. This is surely the legitimate point of the Olduvai Gorge example. Anything may be made a text (in this distributed sense) by being structurally included in an explanation. This is the minimal sense in which physical nature is a field of distributed texts or artifacts: there is no point at which anything es- capes our symbiotized world, and there is no limit to the possible revision and proliferation and the overlapping uses of our conceptual and explanatory schemes. "Ordinarily," as we say, physical nature is entirely mute; it has no secret meaning. There is nothing to inter- pret, although there is everything to understand. Only human actions and institutions and artworks and histories and language, we say, are rightly interpretable; they are the kinds of things that invite, perhaps even require, interpretation. They have or possess or have rightly im- puted them, intrinsically, "meanings," the discerning or deciphering or construing of which is what is properly called interpretation. But, of course, if that's conceded, then it is a very small liberty that justifies us in speaking, relationally, of the interpretation of physical nature. Physical nature lacks the intrinsic attributes (may we now say inten- tional or intensionalized properties?) of the other; but, after all, it too is subject to the initial symbiosis (A), and it too may be rendered textual when characterized as instantiating this or that explanatory scheme or when conceptualized in some way suited to explanation (B). Even the categories of our most refined descriptions are hostage to our explana- tory expectations-shifting under historical pressures. If so, then the whole world is a text, or is textual, although very likely not in any simple uniform way. A "mere" stone will not usually support interpretation in the intrin- 4. I have elaborated this notion of "adequation" (or "ontic adequation") in a num- ber of places (see, e.g., Margolis 1989b: chap. 6; 1991a).</page><page sequence="8">200 Poetics Today 14:1 sic sense, although it may in the relational sense. Arthur Danto (1985) inadvertently betrays the decisive limitation of the relational idiom: it cannot possibly do justice to the intrinsic idiom, that is, the second cannot be reduced to the first; the second serves as an exemplar for the first. And, of course, if that is so, then the world is more complex and diverse than any reductive physicalist ever supposed. If cogniz- ing persons cannot be reduced in a physicalist way (by elimination or identity or extensional equivalence or the like [cf. Margolis 1989b: chap. 6]), then the global sense in which the world is, symbiotically, a text cannot be avoided; and if the cognitive role of persons may (still) be regarded as benignly compatible with the relational interpretation of physical nature taken as a text, then the most important barrier against viewing the ontology of texts as completely heuristic depends on whether the intrinsic reading may be waived in favor of the rela- tional reading-everywhere. The short answer is: it cannot; and, if it cannot, precisely because human actions and artworks are the exem- plary sites of intrinsic interpretation (C), as well as because they are the exemplars of human artifacts (the work of poesis, in Aristotle's sense) and of artifactual events (the work of praxis, on the same ac- count5), then the world includes texts-artifacts apt for interpretation in the strongest possible sense-that is, includes them as real and as clarifying, paradigmatically, the textual nature of everything. In any case, Danto offers the following account in developing his own theory of history. Consider . .. certain stones on the Aventine, which once were makeweights for the public scales in an ancient marketplace. As such they were part of the complex of commercial life in Rome, saturated with Zuhandenheit: things merchants would lay hands on when parcelling out foodstuffs to housewives. As the empire waned and Christianity rose, churches often and naturally rose up where marketplaces had been, and these very stones, having long since lost their Zuhandenheit but felt, perhaps to have some rea- son for existence, found their way into odd corners of the churches, as at Santa Susanna. They did not thus become mere stones, and their proximity to churches suggested to the naively susceptible mind of the time a meaning: they were there as some sort of sacred object-relics, perhaps. In time they were believed to have figured in the lapidation of saints! Those stones are there today, their function in the present being due to their bearing histori- cal meanings which mere specimens for the petrologist blankly lack. What I mean to stress is that the self-identical stones have come under different and nonoverlapping descriptions for differing sets of people who, though they shared these stones, lived in different worlds. (Danto 1985: 336) Notice that Danto speaks of "the self-identical stones," identified quite differently in terms of their (interpretable) significance-now as 5. For a bare clue, see the Nicomachean Ethics, book 6, chapter 4.</page><page sequence="9">Margolis * Texts 201 weights, now as part of the structure of Christian churches, now as relics-as resting "in different worlds." Danto means "different worlds" not in Kuhn's sense, but, more blandly, in the sense that in different historical periods the same stones might or would be de- scribed in different ways, answering to the historical beliefs that, rela- tionally, would justify assigning them certain functions or meanings. The stones, he says, remain the same, although the interpreting beliefs and histories do not. This is precisely the same sense in which Danto speaks of ordi- nary things being "transfigured" into artworks, without actually being transformed into them: that is, something like Duchamp's snow shovel (In Advance of the Broken Arm) remains numerically identical with a particular, quite ordinary, manufactured artifact-a snow shovel-all the while it is transfigured into an extraordinarily important artwork (Danto 1981: 45). This "is" of "artistic identification," Danto says else- where, is not the same as the "is" of numerical identity (Danto 1964). By parity of reasoning, the objects or referents of historical interpreta- tion (the stones, for instance) are only relationally affected by the interest we take in them. In short, numerical identity addresses entities, refer- ents; but "artistic identification" involves only predicates-and those, only relationally, extrinsically, figuratively applied. Danto never actually says whether there is some viable sense in which persons or societies intrinsically have histories, or have inter- pretable lives; or whether, in the benign sense allowed a moment ago, they "have" histories only because we, either reflexively or at some later point in time, impute histories and meanings to them (ourselves!) relationally. Ultimately, of course, the reductionist's bill must be paid in full; or, histories and interpretations must be treated in a temporizing way as purely heuristic and arbitrary; or else, some account of objective rigor with respect to intrinsic meanings and the like must be con- ceded. There are lots of promissory notes outstanding for the first two options, but there are none that have been satisfactorily redeemed. For example, by an unintended analogy Donald Davidson offers the most economical view (of the physicalist's sort) of human actions (not altogether different in this regard from Danto's, although Davidson criticizes Danto's notion of "basic acts")-in effect, a view of individu- ating bodily movements that are (are numerically identical with) our actions, which then reduces all intentionally complex descriptions of action to alternative ("interested") descriptions relationally imputed to the same or different bodily movements: "We must conclude, perhaps with a shock of surprise," says Davidson, "that our primitive actions, the ones we do not do by doing something else, merely movements of the body-these are all the actions there are. We never do more</page><page sequence="10">202 Poetics Today 14:1 than move our bodies; the rest is up to nature" (Davidson 1980: 59; cf. Danto 1965). But this is an utterly idle view if (as happens to be the case) Davidson nowhere shows us how to understand human pur- posiveness, deliberate action, historically pertinent behavior, in the purely physicalist idiom that he favors. The entirely heuristic (also, possibly, an instrumentally useful) read- ing of the intentional idiom of action and history-the one that a relational, but not an intrinsic, account of interpretation could favor- lies behind both Danto's and Davidson's theories. Both disappoint us for the same reason: they never deliver; they never plausibly match the obvious facts of, say, purchasing and treasuring paintings, or of trust- ing or challenging what people conclude about the lives of the sub- jects of biography and history. There are real texts, therefore, artifacts genuinely apt for intrinsic interpretation: ourselves, our actions, our artworks, our lives and histories, our institutions, our utterances. The animal world is assimilated here (however uneasily and by whatever degree) by anthropomorphic analogy; and the merely physical world is, as we have seen, included only relationally by being redescribed in accordance with our frankly explanatory interests. Having said all that, we must also admit that the argument for the admission of intrinsically interpretable texts is not the same as the arguments regarding how to define their "nature" as texts or how to judge the validity of interpretive claims about them. We must make another move. 3 The important thing to bear in mind is that there is no canon for char- acterizing or individuating things de re in terms of their intentional or intensionalized properties; and there is no canon for judging whether such properties, sorted in a determinate sense that would match the disjunctive ascription of physical properties, are intrinsically possessed (or not) by a given text or artifact. The obvious temptation is to deny the reality of such things-which is just what Danto's and Davidson's canny philosophical prudence insinuates. But what if we must admit their reality? Apart from the obvious adjustments needed regarding the informality of interpretive attribution, it is not at all certain that we should be obliged, for merely logical reasons, to abandon the coher- ence of interpretive discourse or even a measure of objectivity among pertinent ascriptions. We should also confess that the picture is even more complicated than we have so far admitted. For it may well be that, on the argu- ment being developed: (1) interpretations obtain that, on a bivalent logic (but not now: that is, now on a many-valued logic, one in which strict truth, if not strict falsity, would be pertinently restricted in range of application), would yield contradiction or incompatibility;</page><page sequence="11">Margolis * Texts 203 and (2) among such interpretations, putatively intrinsic properties would be subject to profound alteration under historical circumstances or as a result of the history of interpretation itself. These are two options that may rightly disturb our sense of philo- sophical tidiness. But they are not incoherent; and, judging from the history of criticism in the arts and from the very history of history, there is much to suggest that they may be close to the mark-on texts. Certainly, such achievements as George Thomson's (1941) close read- ing of the Oresteia in Marxist terms, or Ernest Jones's (1949) Freud- ian reading of Hamlet, or, perhaps even more spectacularly, Roland Barthes's (1974) structuralist joke in reading Balzac's Sarrasine will convince you that both of these options are reasonable or at least not easily denied. The fact that they go completely counter to the prevail- ing themes of analytic philosophy says as much about the self-imposed limitations of that philosophy as ever they do about the supposed confusion of admitting interpretable texts to be real. A few, now nearly commonplace, remarks drawn from current liter- ary or interpretive theory are enough to focus the conceptual puzzles that the notion of texts obliges us to consider. For example, Mon- roe Beardsley, whose entire conviction and practice went against the admission, nevertheless did concede, with his usual admirable can- dor, that the boundaries of textual meaning... are not all that sharp. Some things are definitely said in the poem and cannot be overlooked; others are suggested, as we find on careful reading; others are gently hinted, and whatever meth- ods of literary interpretation we use, we can never establish them decisively as "in" or "out." Therefore whatever comes from without, but yet can be taken as an interesting extension of what is surely in, may be admissible. It merely makes a larger whole. (Beardsley 1970: 36) We may simply add here that there is no known way to confirm that the boundaries or outer limits of any intentionally or intensionally com- plex referent-a text or an interpretable artifact-are crisp or deter- minate in the way that physical objects are said to be (which, of course, is hardly to establish that physical objects are completely determinate). But if texts are not determinate through and through in their most salient features, then a bivalent logic, an insistence on an excluded middle, a rejection of "incongruent" judgments (i.e., judgments that would be incompatible on a bivalent logic but not now), could not but be refused. The theme, in fact, is a deep one, which Charles Sanders Peirce had once, in a most original way, closely examined-and had shown to affect the scope of the laws of noncontradiction and excluded middle.6 6. I have pursued this issue in many places. For the most sustained formal account, however, see Margolis (199lb: chap. 2), where Peirce's view is explored.</page><page sequence="12">204 Poetics Today 14:1 Secondly, Harold Bloom has since, quite ingeniously, "normalized" the relation between poetry and criticism so that, particularly in the hands of a "strong" poet, the two may be construed as aspects of one and the same process-what Bloom calls "misreading or misprision." Reading ... is a belated and all-but-impossible act, and if strong is always a misreading. Literary meaning tends to become more underdetermined even as literary language becomes more over-determined. Criticism may not always be an act ofjudging, but it is always an act of deciding, and what it tries to decide is meaning.... Influence, as I conceive it, means that there are no texts, but only relationships between texts. These relationships de- pend upon a critical act, a misreading or misprision, that one poet performs upon another, and that does not differ in kind from the necessary criti- cal acts performed by every strong reader upon every text he encounters. The influence-relation governs reading as it governs writing, and reading is therefore a mis-writingjust as writing is a misreading. As literary history lengthens, all poetry necessarily becomes verse-criticism,just as all criticism becomes prose-poetry. (Bloom 1975: 3) The extravagance of Bloom's prose is perhaps pardonable. Clearly, when he speaks of there being "no texts, but only relationships be- tween texts," he means to deny the canonical thesis that particular, individuatable things must have determinate boundaries and fixed natures. Texts do not. (Here, he implicitly goes against Danto and Davidson.) If anything like the practice he endorses holds in literary criticism, then Bloom is right to insist that texts are not like that: they have no determinate boundaries. Still, Bloom nowhere addresses the question of the logic and coherence of the adjusted discourse-hence his ex- travagance; and we are accordingly obliged, in treating texts as real, to resolve the apparent anomaly. At the very least, however, Bloom confronts us unblinkingly with the deepest conceptual challenge entailed in the admission of texts as real: first, that there are real "things," things that are able to function in discourse as logically stable referents-never mind whether they should be construed as objects or events or whatever-in spite of the fact that their properties (their "meaning," says Bloom) are not deter- minate through and through and in spite of the fact that their "nature" (since that depends essentially on their meaning) is not fixed and is never entirely secure against radical transformation through the his- torical process of ongoing criticism and interpretation; second, that their sustained individuation and identification depend on grasping the continuous narrative process of interpretive history (literary his- tory, in Bloom's case), which therefore provides the ground on which more persuasive or plausible interpretations ("objective" interpreta- tions, may we say?) can be considered; and third, that the conditions of both the individuation and the identity of texts entail the priority</page><page sequence="13">Margolis * Texts 205 of intensionalized criteria, which utterly reverses the systematic pre- tensions of current analytic philosophy. Even if we cannot resolve these matters to everyone's satisfaction, their mere acknowledgment draws attention to the profound concep- tual contest that the reality of texts forces upon us. Recall, for example, that both Davidson and Danto try to neutralize the logical effect of proliferating intentional (and intensionalized) descriptions of human actions by allowing them to apply: relationally, to initially specified bodily movements (or, in the case of artworks, to initial physical materials). Bloom's maneuver, generalized for the whole of human culture, challenges at its core the adequacy of any such strategy-as did, in fact, Herbert Feigl's well-known honest worry about what he called the "many-many" problem.7 For Feigl, merely attempting to integrate the human sciences within the unity-of-science program forces us to consider the troublesome fact that, for any given bodily movement, there are indefinitely many different actions that could be said to be performed through it (in familiar intentional contexts and on familiar intensionalized descriptions) and that, for any given putative action, there are indefinitely many different bodily movements that could have enabled that action to be performed. (A movement of the arm, say, might signify any one of a variety of actions, none of which could be determined from a knowledge of its merely physical properties or from any of the physical features of its environs [signaling, pretending to signal, inadvertently signaling, and the like]; an action [making a chess move, say] could be instantiated by any one of a variety of bodily movements, not determinately favored or required by any intentional criteria subtended by that action; and, moreover, there is no known rule or law correlating the two.) If this holds for actions (which, of course, on the theory being advanced are texts in their own right), then it would be hopeless to suppose that literary texts, other art- works, or discourse in general could possibly support a restoration of the unity canon. A third familiar remark about the interpretive tradition may be drawn from Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic thesis, which iden- tifies (by specifying what it calls the subtilitas applicandi, i.e., the insepa- rability of interpreting or understanding a text and its application to the self, the self-interpretive application of an interpreter's reading of a text within his own historical space) that most troublesome dimen- sion of the theory of texts: namely, the construing of human selves as themselves (reflexively) interpretable texts. 7. The term is Feigl's. Although he often broached the problem in live exchanges, I have not found it in his published papers.</page><page sequence="14">206 Poetics Today 14:1 The historical movement of human life consists in the fact that it is never utterly bound to any one standpoint, and hence can never have a truly closed horizon. The horizon is, rather, something into which we move and that moves with us. Horizons change for a person who is moving. ... A hermeneutical situation is determined by the prejudices that we bring with us. They constitute, then, the horizon of a particular present, for they rep- resent that beyond which it is impossible to see. ... In fact the horizon of the present is being continually formed, in that we have continually to test all our prejudices. An important part of this testing is the encounter with the past and the understanding of the tradition from which we come. Hence the horizon of the present cannot be formed without the past.... Of course, the reader does not exist before whose eyes the great book of world history simply lies open. But nor does the reader exist who, when he has his text before him, simply reads what is there. Rather, all reading involves application, so that a person reading a text is himself part of the meaning he apprehends. He belongs to the text that he is reading. (Gadamer 1975: 271-73,279, 304) Gadamer's account of these complexities, it must be said, is not alto- gether perspicuous: both because he somehow manages to save, from a radically changing history, "a higher universality" of mankind, "the one great horizon ... that embraces everything contained in historical consciousness," a vision that somehow (endlessly and miraculously) re- covers the relatively constant norms of classical Greece (ibid.: 271-72, 253-58), and because, in admitting the dual, interpenetrating herme- neutic problem of the "fusion of horizons" that involves (1) the past and present of (literary) texts, and (2) the past and present "nature" of the interpreters of those texts (both read in terms of present preju- dices), Gadamer never actually addresses the conceptual puzzles of reference and predication and objectivity in anything like a methodical way (ibid.: 305-41). We need not follow Beardsley or Bloom or Gadamer in these re- spects. But what they point to convergently is distinctive of the logic of intrinsic texts (of actions and artworks) and does prove, on inde- pendent grounds, to be both coherent and viable. And that comes as a surprise. 4 We have identified too many puzzles, of course, and those puzzles are much too fundamental for anyone to hope, in the space of a few closing remarks, to set the required record entirely straight. But let us try to cover a few of the essential worries. We may at least lay out an orderly set of claims that the defense of a theory of texts like ours would need to address. First of all, texts or interpretable artifacts-real "things" intrinsi- cally possessing intentional or intensionalized properties-can emerge as real only within the (correspondingly real) space of human culture.</page><page sequence="15">Margolis * Texts 207 Cultural emergence must be, sui generis, not reducible to the slight forms of emergence admitted (say) by the various strands of the unity- of-science program.8 The best clue is probably this: human cognizers identify whatever they discourse about in terms of conceptual distinc- tions that endogenously limit what they can conceptually imagine- compatibly with their understanding that they are doing just that- and, as a consequence, the nature of the real things that they thus encounter need not be explicable in terms of what they also posit as the structure of the ultimate substance from which everything emerges. In favoring categories congruent with their own cognitive intervention, humans may be ineluctably bound to select certain categories that thereupon affect the functioning of all other categories that facilitate or inhibit reductionism. Physical reduction, then, would be limited in being itself posited at a level of cognizing activity not actually reduced in its own terms-possibly even incapable of being so reduced. This would match, of course, our having ventured, earlier on, to treat the physical world as itself a "text." Secondly, if reductionism fails, if Cartesian dualisms of every sort are to be avoided, if the intrinsic intentional or intensionalized prop- erties of texts are to be taken as real (not merely heuristically allowed), then there remains only one possible conceptual or ontic strategy: we are bound, in addition to treating texts as culturally emergent, to treat them also as indissolubly complex, embodied entities whose in- trinsic properties are, correspondingly, indissolubly complex incarnate properties-that is, when taken as real in cultural space. Very briefly put: on this view, persons or selves would be taken as indissolubly embodied in specimens of Homo sapiens (as far as we know); sculp- tures, in marble or wood, say; words, in sounds or marks; actions, in bodily movements; and so on.9 Furthermore, their properties would include such complex intrinsic properties as the pathos of Michelan- gelo's Pieta, which exhibits an expressive or semiotic aspect analyzably distinct but inseparable from the physical features of the marble in which, in the cultural space of producing and appreciating sculpture, it may be convincingly discerned and ascribed to the Pieta. Along the same lines, a gesture (not a mere bodily movement) may be a command or an insult, which we discern in sharing a social practice. Here, we begin to meet the requirements of conceptual (or ontic) adequation and critical objectivity. We begin to see the sense in which the whole of human culture (science, discourse, action, art) must yield to a single vision. We may add, however, some further details. For one thing, logically, 8. For a sustained discussion of the matter, see Margolis (1987: chap. 10). 9. For a convenient summary of the "embodied" and the "incarnate," see Margolis (1984a: chap. 1).</page><page sequence="16">208 Poetics Today 14:1 interpretation is always made of the descriptively stable properties of things. This does not mean that description and interpretation need address discernibly different kinds of property. If, of course, the in- trinsic properties of texts are intensionally complex incarnate proper- ties, as we have claimed, then there will always have to be (incarnating) properties admitted that are not interpretable in the way of artworks and the like; but then they (the latter) could always be interpreted in a further, relational sense in which (as we saw) physical nature may be treated as textual. Also, the relation between description and inter- pretation proves to be merely relative to the moment of rendering an interpretation: what was interpreted at some earlier time t may now be "sedimented" as a stable descriptive property at t' later than t-with- out changing its logical status. And, of course, the distinction between description and interpretation does not bear at all on the certainty with which we may suppose we are discerning the "independently" real properties of anything: there are no such properties-on the symbiotic thesis already given. Finally, the indissolubility of incarnate properties is a logical mat- ter affecting the nature of what is culturally emergent. Their admis- sion does not entail assigning any epistemic priority, regarding either reference or predication, to physical properties. It is, for instance, entirely possible that, as with multiple prints pulled from the same etching plate used in printing Durer's Melancholia I or as with mul- tiple performances of a Mozart sonata, the same indissoluble complex property may be incarnated in different printings or in different per- formances.10 Incarnate properties must be incarnated, of course, but they need not be incarnated exclusively in the physical properties in which they happen to be incarnate; and their being the properties that they are is not determinable in any way from the real features of their incarnating properties. Such considerations as these begin to suggest the viability of a rami- fied theory of texts. But they obviously presuppose solutions to even knottier puzzles. We have already featured two: one, the individua- tion and reidentification of referents (texts) in ways that are either nonextensional or not entirely or primarily extensional; the other, the radical alterability of the intensionally complex properties of texts as a result of historically evolving interpretations. These puzzles may well pose the most radical conceptual challenge to the prevailing practice 10. This and similar problems lead us to postulate that texts, or cultural enti- ties in general, may be individuated as tokens-of-types. Incarnate properties are, it should be noted, not merely abstract functional properties-as informational properties are often thought to be, and as mental or psychological properties are certainly not. The maneuver forestalls functionalism (see also Margolis 1984b: chap. 4; 1987: chap. 9).</page><page sequence="17">Margolis * Texts 209 among analytic philosophers. But the general lines of coherent and favorable resolution are surprisingly straightforward. The answer to the first puzzle simply confirms that there is no completely adequate extensional treatment of reference operative in a cognitively apt way for human speakers (as distinct from God); that is, effective reference is always contextual, always implicating "story- relative" intentions, and is therefore effective only practically, with- out ever uniquely designating anything. For instance, the Leibnizian option, about which Leibniz himself had serious doubts (but that W. V. Quine never doubted)-that everything there "is" could be desig- nated in principle by a uniquely instantiated predicate (if instantiated at all: "Socratizing" as opposed to "Pegasizing")-is clearly beyond human cognitive capacities. (Numerical identity is not general indis- cernibility.) Hence effective reference and reidentification depend on our narrative memory of what we take to have been identified (inten- tionally) at some earlier moment of discourse.1 Correspondingly, if, along the lines suggested, we treat reference grammatically, as not entailing ontic commitment, then it becomes relatively easy to separate what we take to be the constraints on refer- ence and predication from what we take to be the "natures" of what- ever we discourse about. On that maneuver, we may hold (coherently enough) that some of our referents, texts in particular, lack natures, are not "natural-kind" objects at all, have (or are) only histories-in the precise sense that we may continue to individuate and reidentify them only in intensionally complex narrative ways all the while that the properties imputed to them as intrinsic at some particular time t may be altered or affected, interpretively, at some later t'. Assuming some deep familiarity with our forms of cultural life (in ways that draw variously on the work of such theorists as Hegel, Marx, Nietz- sche, Wittgenstein, Gadamer, or Foucault), we begin to see the sense in which the admission that texts lack determinate or final natures need not altogether disqualify the notion of a certain (admittedly relaxed) objectivity with which interpretation may be practiced.12 In fact, it is the same narrative memory that ensures the effective- ness of reference that now permits us to ensure as well a measure of objectivity (doubtless at least consensual) regarding the diachronic course of interpretation. Reference, everywhere, is fixed on practi- cal grounds, fixed in contexts that are remembered within our own form of life; reference to texts is additionally assisted by subordinate memories of the particular material embodiment of this or that text, 11. For a sustained discussion of the matter, see Margolis (1989b: chap. 7). 12. I have attempted a sustained account of the logic of such a view in Margo- lis (1989a).</page><page sequence="18">210 Poetics Today 14:1 artwork, artifact, action, utterance, person, or the like. Predication similarly depends, everywhere, on remembered paradigms within the practices of our form of life and the improvisational tolerance, within our collective life, for extending the use of predicates. That we pro- visionally collect certain subsets of predicables as the "nature" of, or as what is "intrinsic" to, this or that particular text and then allow such attributes to change without their "home" texts' losing thereby their numerical identity is, however radical vis-a-vis the canonical view of things, no more difficult to concede than the other-and just as difficult to resist. Well, these are promissory notes, of course. But they are not junk bonds. References Barthes, Roland 1974 S/Z, translated by Richard Miller (New York: Hill and Wang).
