NOVEMBER 7, 1912 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS THE KINDS OF POETRY THE many attempts in the last quarter-century to describe or define literary genres have assumed in poetry some such evolu- tion as can be demonstrated in geology or anatomy. Literary schol- arship has chiefly taught itself to see in the drama a development from the religious rites of Greece or of the Middle Age, to hear in the lyric thin echoes of Lesbos or Provence, and to suspect behind these beginnings, as behind the Homeric epic, lost tracts of primi- tive poetry that reach to the earliest mutterings of the race. To this understanding of poetry and its career the anthropologists, beyond their intention, have been most friendly; their gatherings of folk- song from races or tribes all but incoherent, furnish oblique evidence for the scholar's guess after forgotten poetic origins, much as the surviving monkey witnesses to kindred aspects in our parentage. The study of the beginnings of poetry is now usually supposed to call for the same kind of deduction and induction from fossils and belated survivals as the study of the origin of the horse. Is it too presumptuous to suggest that in this whole drift of literary research there is confusion of ideas? In the first place, you can not follow the track of anything that changes until you have some minimum of definition or standard or guide to assure you that from change to change you are still follow- ing one thing, and not discovering something new. If this general- ization is sweeping, at least it can hardly be disputed by the his- torians of literary genres, who have all in some measure assumed and acted upon it. But so far as literature is concerned it does not seem too sweeping. Before you can inquire into the lowliest phases of life you must assume, as a scientist, what every man instinctively feels, that life under all its appearances is one thing. To uncover the history of any kind of poetry, you must carry along with you an image, a definition, of what you would identify. Yet the lyric, the drama, the epic, are still after much discussion undefined, and stu- dents of literature are become so reconciled to the unscientific slip- 617</page><page sequence="2">618 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY periness of their terminology that they expect no one to mean any specific thing by "lyric" or "drama"; they merely try to discover, in each use of each term, the user's idiosyncrasy, the unconscious mark of himself or his breeding. Or, if they feel the need of taming this chaos, they put their hope in those histories of genres, already mentioned, which are supposed to describe if not define. Yet until there is first a definition of what is eternally lyrical, eternally dramatic, how can they know the evolution of lyric or drama? Such a definition-in the second place-is indispensable not merely to any logical inquiry into evolution, but much more to any fair statement of what men in general think poetry is. In our ordinary thought we conceive of poetry just as we conceive of life itself, as subject to no development whatever. Things either have existed or they have not; the utterances of the race, similarly, have been either poetry or not poetry. It is no contradiction of this view that what to one age seems poetic is often unpoetic to the next; for in every such case it is not the poetry, but the language, the medium of it, which time has rendered obsolete. Nor does materialistic science present any obstacle to this instinctive selection of the eternal and universal in life and poetry. Indeed, the more materialistic our explanation of life and the more anatomical our account of poetry, the less importance will the evolution of either have in comparison with its permanent aspects. If consciousness is but a fortunate conjunction and behavior of atoms, how wonderful that the myriad different combinations of atoms should have a consciousness in com- mon and should understand each other. If poetry is but an acci- dent of syllables, a fortunate stirring of connotations, emotional and mental, how extraordinary that we should agree that some connota- tions are poetic and others not! To be sure, life and poetry do appear in degrees and variations; but to say quantitatively that a man is barely alive or that a piece is almost poetry does not in the least affect the qualitative distinction we all make between living and dead, poetic and unpoetic. Yet, though the evolutionary historian has not shared this view of poetry as an unchanging function of an unchanging life, it will not do to say, even to imply, that he has contributed nothing to our knowledge. He has only failed to add to our knowledge of poetry. He has made clearer some aspect of the form, the meter, the imagery -what in a large sense we may call the language-of poetry; and in this field his method is practicable, since language does undergo evolution, and its relation to poetry is only secondary though indis- pensable, like the relation of the body to life. To take a ready illus- tration, the accounts of the development of the drama are for the most part studies of the expression of drama-studies of language,</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 619 in the large sense-of the number of actors, the shape of the stage, the conditions of presentation; or, more subtly, studies of theme, of reversals of fortune and combat with fate. In every such case the preliminary definition which determined the evolution was based not on the drama, but on the expression of it, or on its subject-matter. Drama is that which can be acted, postulates one historian, and then goes trailing the drama with this lantern, though perhaps he would not agree that everything actable is dramatic. Tragedy, begins the more subtle scholar, taking his cue from Aristotle, is that kind of drama which deals with a tragic incident, a destructive or painful action, such as death or agony or wounds. Yet the Tale of Troy furnishes as apt subject-matter for the lyric or the epic as for the drama, of which the scholar told us tragedy is a kind. And even if he hedges himself round with all these postulates at once, and says that tragedy deals with such and such subject-matter and must be actable, we still can see how the Tale of Troy might be staged and yet turn out to be a lyric after all. The scholar has simply failed to put something in his definition that would make certain the dramatic quality of his tragedy. Illustrations from other kinds of poetry are as easily cited. He who traces a literary genre like the elegy, let us say, and determines what is an elegy by some metrical characteristic, is really chronicling the use of that meter-just as the scientist who would write the history of man by showing the evolution of his anatomy, really traces only the history of his anat- omy. That language, the whole dress of poetry, is as necessary to it as the body is to the phenomenon of life, justifies any amount of study upon it, but it should not be confused with the study of poetry. Even if poetry were subject to evolution, it would be wise to study it in its latest development. The significance of life is not in the lowest cell, but in the soul of the most spiritual man; and if we are interested in defining the oak, why turn our back upon it, to draw conclusions from an acorn? But it is time to distinguish between language, which has an evolutionary career, and poetry, which has not. The English tongue has evolved since Shakespeare's day, but poetry is just what it was. Kill off every horse in the world, and you destroy the species. Kill off every known and sus- pected poet, and there will be as many as ever after a generation or two. If the language were destroyed, ages would be needed to evolve another; but poetry, being a constant function of life, is rooted as it were perpendicularly in every moment of consciousness, and not horizontally, trailing back long feelers into mist-hidden swamps of primitiveness. It is the aim of this paper to see what progress can be made toward defining poetic genres by throwing overboard all idea of</page><page sequence="4">620 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY evolution and considering poetry as an invariable function of life. In one sense, all poetry is of one kind, and is easily described. Ordi- narily the emotions aroused by experience are used up in the further process of living. The poet differs from his fellows only in the greater power of his emotions, in the greater imperativeness of his intuitions, whereby it is easier for him to express them in words than to consume them in life. The stimulus that enters the poet's nature and comes out as epical or dramatic or lyrical expression, enters equally the nature of ordinary man and is consumed in lyrical or epic or dramatic living. However theoretical or dogmatic this parallel may seem, in practise it is recognized by all men. A poet's temperament prescribes into which of the three genres his work shall fall; and similarly the temperament of average men prescribes whether they shall live in the present, or in the past, or in the future. In these three eternal ways of meeting experience, it is believed, are to be found the definitions of the lyric, the drama, and the epic. The qualities to which we give the names "lyrical," "dramatic," "epic," are no less normal and fundamental than these three apprehensions of life-as simply a present moment, or as a present moment in which the past is reaped, or as a present moment in which the future is promised. We are accustomed to say that the lyric expresses emotion, with or without an admixture of intellectual content; the emotion is the essential. Emotion, however, is the nearest intimation we have of the present moment. A man may act, and not realize that he has done so until afterwards, but he can not have an emotion until he feels it. Yet vivid as is the response to immediate experience in the lyric, it is also as transitory as time itself-the lyrical is the most evanescent attitude toward life; and as all feeling tends to subside after the exciting cause is removed, so the lyric is the representation of a changed and dying feeling. Because the emotion is involun- tary, its career in the poet's spirit will be to a degree a revelation of his character, and in that revelation some glimpse of his past and future will be involved; but the emphasis will remain upon the sense of the present, and from this flow the lyrical qualities-the immediate emotion and its subsiding. This transitory nature of feeling has troubled both poets and critics, as the passing of time troubles every meditative spirit, who would make eternal the high moments of life. In the lyric to fix the most fleeting emotion has seemed imperative, but how? Many a poet has been disposed to let the emotion subside into a broad gen- eralized frame of mind-into a reflection or a prophecy-and so rescue a permanent lesson from the sinking mood. But whether this disposition tactfully insinuates itself, as in Wordsworth, or bluntly</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 621 obtrudes, as in Longfellow, the suspicion grows upon the reader that it is a defect of art; the poet's reflection, or whatever else he gets from his emotion, is likely to be personal and peculiar-more and more so as time separates him from his audience, for ages differ in their conventional thoughts more than in their feelings. Recognizing this difficulty, criticism has never agreed with the poets that the eternity of the lyric should be provided for in the end of it, in the more intellectual part; rather, theorists of literature have formulated a platitude that the lyric is great by virtue of elemental, universal emotion. This would seem to be, however, a reading of history into a prudent recipe for fame. Unless it is an affectation, the lyric renders an emotion truly felt, and this sincerity of intuition appears to be all that the poet can be expected to care about. So far as his fame is concerned, the greatness of his poem will depend upon the number of men who share his emotion. That he ought not to take thought overmuch, nor choose between emotions even if he could, seems proved by the very large number of lyrists who have come to their own through the belated sympathy of a new age, to which they would never have appealed had they consulted contemporary preferences in their emotions. And even if the lyric poet has missed fame by the singularity of his reactions to experi- ence, his work is still recognized as lyrical if it have the attitude that responds to life always as a rapturous present moment. In its unconscious revelation of character, every lyric suggests a momentum of previous conduct, choices made, habits formed; and to the extent of this implication of the past, a lyric is a kind of drama. The difference between them is only a shifting of emphasis. Every drama is in a high sense lyrical, for it must be imagined as happening in the present; and every character in it, supposed to be living in the present, is a lyrical character. But the emphasis of the whole is upon the past. That the drama is the exhibition of human will is true only so far as it exhibits a harvested past, char- acter returning upon itself in the guise of fate; for if a person in a play should will something inconsistent with his known past, or if some trick of fortune should release him from his past, the play would not satisfy the dramatic sense. That situation is dramatic which brings men suddenly to account, and he who has the eye for drama sees in life a perpetual judgment day. It is not a matter of analysis, nor of training, but of temperament, and therefore the young Shakespeare, when he writes a sonnet-sequence, manages to write a drama, and later, when the structure of his plays seems premeditated or elaborated, the complexity can be accounted for by the dramatic sense through which he apprehends life. There are</page><page sequence="6">622 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY two plots in the "Merchant of Venice"; how clever Shakespeare was, say the commentators, to join both in one play. But given the character of Antonio, the merchant, and Shakespeare would have been forced to invent the equivalents of those two plots, if he had not laid hands on them. For Antonio is a moody creature, extrava- gant in his generosity, careless and reckless in his prejudices. He is a contradiction of himself, and his life, viewed dramatically, must show the simultaneous reaping of his good and bad acts. His insult- ing bravado with Shylock gets him into danger, but his loan to Bassanio, the generosity bound up with the insult and the bravado, brings Portia to his aid; and when the two streams of fate balance, he becomes again what he was before-moody and contradictory. To say that Shakespeare constructed this consistency is to forget that without such consistency one can not conceive of life as the accomplishment of the past. The secret of this harmony of form is not in Shakespeare's craft, but in his intuition. Nor need we attribute to the Greek dramatist any particular theory of heredity, if in the CEdipus story the past that is reaped extends over two generations. His parents grasped at opportunity at all costs, and lEdipus inherits their impulsiveness, their inability to consider. To be sure he is indifferent to the identity of the old man he killed on the highway, and he risks his life to share the throne of a queen whom he does not know and has never seen. But only his father would so forget his royalty as to quarrel on the highway with a young vagabond, and only his mother would promise herself indif- ferently to whoever should answer the Sphinx. It is the same char- acter in all three, and the fault is alike ruinous to all. The fact that all three characters submit, as it were, to the same judgment day and are punished for the same fault, suggests the observation in passing, that the dramatic point of view tends to unify life at any given moment by discovering in it a homogeneous past. Just as the student of anatomy sees the passers-by as skele- tons, and as the journalist who investigates graft comes to attribute every defect of government to peculation, so the dramatist, studying the past as reaped by one person in his play, is likely to attribute a similar past to other characters. This duplication of theme is so familiar as hardly to need illustration. "Twelfth Night," a love story, shows all its characters except the clown to be in some stage of love; "Measure for Measure," similarly, exhibits the degrees of the fear of death in various natures; and "King Lear" studies life as a problem of filial relations. The significant thing is that this economy of situation and theme is not a matter of choice or craft with the dramatist, any more than the observation of men as skele- tons is economy of point of view with the anatomist; it lies rather</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 623 in the method or means of perception-in the dissective eye, and in the dramatic sense. The immediate effect, however, of any play read or seen, is less logical, less rigidly consistent, because of the lyrical element-the emphasis of the present moment in all the characters. If the story is to be of value as proving the past, the persons must all speak and act conscious only of the present, without suspicion that they are terms in a demonstration. That is, they must act and speak lyric- ally. Each present moment, as it passes through the reader's or the spectator's mind, will be interesting in proportion to its emotional intensity, which is furnished partly by the lines, partly by the acting, partly by the situation. These all are lyrical elements. Situation has nothing to do with the dramatic sense, except as it affords character an opportunity to display itself; it looks to the present, and sometimes to the future, but never to the past. How unconscious of the past the acting must be, has just been suggested. The lines may be very lyrical, as in "Romeo and Juliet," without much glancing at the dramatic drift, or they may be capable of a double meaning, lyrical to the speaker and dramatic to his hearers, as in "Macbeth." The kind of character or emotion revealed in the lyric, we saw, has been thought to have a bearing upon its probable fame. It is obvious, however, that drama may be judged either by the kind of emotion, the kind of character exhibited-from the standpoint of the actor-or by the extent to which the reaping of the past is felt. It is a common enough phenomenon of stage history that the popular favor often leans to the lyrical side, and many a play dramatically bad succeeds because it contains some character lyrically good. But if the play gives a strong enough sense of the past, that is, if the characters are consistent with their own history, they may be lyric- ally what they please; they must in any case appeal less upon the virtue of their emotions than upon the justice of their fate. An audience will permit the lyric to express only such emotions as they at the moment understand, but in the drama they will accept the emotion tentatively until they see what is to become of it. Satan cursing God in a lyric will not please the pious, who yet would be delighted to see him in a drama cursing God and getting punished for it. The drama has one other lyrical effect, in the general emotional tone it conveys. This tone is serious in proportion as the work is felt to be a reaping of the past; every judgment day is serious, even if we are acquitted. Therefore there is no clear line to be drawn between tragedy and comedy, for different men and different ages will disagree as to what is serious; nor is there any essential differ-</page><page sequence="8">624 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ence between tragedy and comedy, since a mere change of opinion as to what is serious so easily converts one into the other. The occa- sion of laughter or merriment in the play is from the lyrical part- from the speech or the situation or the acting-and we enjoy it for the passing moment; but every comedy which is really dramatic becomes serious with time, as men more highly value the sacredness of human nature. Beatrice and Benedick amuse us while they are joking or while others trick them, and Petruchio's behavior at his wedding is funny while we hear of it, but in so far as we care about those characters, such episodes grieve our sense of the dignity of life. The difference, then, that at first sight appears between comedy and tragedy depends upon nothing but whether we care so little for the characters that laughter is adequate armor against the judgments they unconsciously pronounce upon themselves, or whether we require a nobler kind of fortitude. The lyric is closer to the drama than to the epic, and there are fewer epics than either lyrics or dramas. The reason is probably that a sense of the future--the ability to see life as a prospect of destiny-is far rarer than a sense of the past, to say nothing of the immediate sense of the present, and it seems to have always some- thing of the miraculous in it. If each moment can be seen as a harvest of previous moments, there is every logical reason why the interest of the present should be the future it promises; but only men of unusual faith have risen to this logic, and even they felt the promise of destiny more as a gift from a superior being than as a consequence of the present. Indeed, where the promise reveals itself to a nature of great optimism, it often takes the form of strong contrast with things as they are, and the lyrical and the epical moods in the poem are almost miraculously contradictory. Azneas is humanly weak, his expedition but a frail band to make certain the destiny of Rome; the poet intends us to set the lyrical mood of the hero-regret, reluctance, even terror-over against the majesty of the imperial doom he served. It is a contrast, not a consequence; or if a consequence, then too much a thing of wonder for the logic of normal man. A more superficial reason has usually been given for the small number of epics in literature, especially for the total disappearance of the genre in modern times. It is said that every epic must have a plot in heaven, working itself out in human fortunes on earth, because the epic exhibits divine will, as the drama exhibits the will of man; and since we no longer have a well-peopled anthropomorphic heaven, we can no longer show the gods plotting there. But to say that the epic exhibits divine will is only to say that it gives the sense of destiny, the feeling of guidance to an end. Why can not men</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 625 express such a feeling without a scene on Olympus? The gods and goddesses of the old epics were but part of the language with which the epic feeling was expressed; they are no more essential to the rendering of that sense than the kings and queens of the old plays are essential to the drama. If only we had an epic to express, we could make the language for it. But, say the historians, the epic has always dealt with a world crisis, involving a higher and a lower civilization; how can we have this large kind of poetry again until we have another great crisis? If the historian be American, he often concludes by wondering why the Civil War, so easily comparable to that of Troy, never found its Homer. Yet these explanations, and the description of the epic implied in them, are not sufficiently searching. The world crisis which is clear enough now in the Lneid was probably not clear until Vergil made it so, and whether he believed in the mythology and the heaven he wrote of, made no difference poetically to him, and makes none to us. The essence of the epic is that attitude toward life which sees in the moment a destined future. Without this attitude, no epic is possible. If literature is now barren of this kind of poetry, may it not be because this age, in spite of much theorizing, has no confidence as to what its destiny may be? It is not that we have lost the gods. If we no longer have Milton's celestial personages and geography, we have the idea of evolution, which ought to give the strongest pos- sible conviction of our future. But evolution, whether in the hands of the literary historian or in those of the scientist, has been exclu- sively occupied in clarifying and reinforcing our sense of the past; it has not even suggested whither we are bound. No wonder that its chief service has been to the drama, which with a new, scientific confidence now shows us the inevitability of one moment upon the next, the sins of the fathers visited mathematically upon the chil- dren; no wonder that with this rejuvenated day of judgment per- petually before us, our drama is dark and tragic, and deals, however wholesomely, with our worse selves. The beast we were, constantly returns to bear witness against the man we think we are. Exactly what sort of epic we shall have when science becomes once more prospective and hopeful it is hardly worth while to guess, but the permanent traits of the genre are fairly clear. Just as the lyric enters into the drama, so the drama enters into epic; for a sense of destiny involves some guidance out of the past and the present, the direction of to-morrow being found as it were by the two points of to-day and yesterday. To the ancient mind all this meant simply the will of the gods, within such limits as the gods were free; therefore a drama was enacted in heaven reaping the past of the divinities, and that harvest became on earth man's fate.</page><page sequence="10">626 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY To state it another way, man would be most devout, most ready to attribute his future to the past of the gods, at those moments of history when he felt himself in a world-current of destiny. Tasso and Milton felt such prophetic influences, though they substituted the Christian heaven and divinities for the pagan. And however the future poet creates new imagery or modifies the old, he will keep unchanged the soul of the epic-the prospect of the race; and in this prospect will remain, if only in a diffused state, a dramatic consciousness of the past from which it grew. The lyric also enters into the epic, not only as it is included in the heavenly drama, but throughout the poem-most obviously in the character of the hero, upon whom the will of the gods falls. Here again the poem may be judged by the lyric impression-by the behavior of the hero. Such a standard, however, leaves us dis- appointed with most epics. For it is to the poet's advantage to minimize the strength of the hero and magnify his obedience, in order that the power of destiny on him may seem irresistible; other- wise the poet may find he has written not epic but drama. It is best rather to judge a poem by the quality that distinguishes its genre. The test of the epic attitude is in the consistency of its sense of an inexorable future-which is quite apart from its lyrical excellenees. Finally, the epic, like the drama, has a total lyric aspect, as naturally hopeful as the sense of the past is naturally serious. No matter how somber the incidents or the situation, they are in the epic but opportunities for the display of destiny; every moment promises a new beginning. For an epic to be pessimistic is a paradox, and indicates a confusion in the poet's view of life. If these definitions of the kinds of poetry are just, they would seem to open for the student of literature, if he so desires, a new field besides that of language in which to apply the principle of evolution. The changes that can be traced in literary history are changes not of poetry nor of its kinds, but of the spiritual ideals, the social conventions and proprieties, the political conditions, which at any given time are as it were the raw material of literature; and in this material some principle of evolution may perhaps be found. For example, the history of English drama, if drama is the sense of the past called to judgment, should study the changes in the English conception of what is a test of character. The Elizabethan stage dealt with situations of great adventure-with murders, shipwrecks, plots, and surprises; whereas the modern play usually prefers a test of character taken from an ordered, quiet life. Evidently there has been a change in the English ideal of success and failure. It will not do to assume that the nature of drama has changed, nor even that the process of time has made the modern play more dramatic;</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 627 "Lear" and "Macbeth" and "Othello" hold their own by any definitions. But it is illuminating to remember that the successful man, in the Renaissance ideal, was one who could cope with every public or private emergency. It was not enough that he should be morally good-a beggar might be that; but he-and the women as well-must have the varied efficiency of gentlefolk born to a career. Viola, Portia, Orlando meet emergencies with success; Hamlet and Othello do not. The modern playwright, however, would be most unlikely to represent any of these excellent persons as tragic vic- tims, because the modern ideal of success is a matter of living, as it were on the defensive, not by rising to extraordinary accomplish- ment, but by avoiding such errors as later may embarrass us; our typical tragedy shows some weakness overtaking us in the very routine of our existence. Between this idea of failure and the Elizabethan, there is a change that can not be understood without the historian 's help; and there are similar changes, calling for similar help, in the crude material that has gone into lyrics and epics. If the study of these changes is not specifically the study of poetry, at least it is the study of man's way of accounting for him- self to himself-not an ignoble study; and its effect would be to show the kinship of poetry with life, by illuminating man's eternal effort to restate life so that it will satisfy him, and the eternal moods through which the eternal effort is made.
