Advanced Technology Center Buffalo, NY ALL AUTOMOBILES CURRENTLY manufactured or marketed in the United States are equipped with either "active" or "passive" occupant restraint systems. The active systems consist of lap and shoulder belts for the outboard front seat occupants. These systems are termed active because they require overt action on the part of the person to buckle the belt across his or her lap and torso. Failure of a considerable percentage of the motoring population to use these restraint systems has prompted an interest in the development of passive belt restraint systems which would protect the occupant during a collision. A system is termed passive (presently referred to as "automatic") when no overt action is required by the occupant to deploy or engage the system. Passivity is not a necessary condition for a high percentage usage rate but it has been generally assumed to be a sufficient one. Other considerations must be taken into account when evaluating the sufficiency of passivity toward raising the use level of a restraint system. In any belt restraint system there is an inherent requirement for the person to be able to disengage the belt after a crash. Unfortunately, if the belt and mechanisms for deployment and use are cumbersome and/or uncomfortable to the user, - - ABSTRACT Development of a producible preloaded, force-limited passive belt restraint system for small cars has been completed at Cal span Corporation. The restraint system has been developed and evaluated through computer simulations and sled tests. This paper presents and discusses the results of the developmental program at velocity changes of 34, 40 and 45 MPH during symmetric frontal barrier crash sled and computer simulations with regard to the effect upon 50th, 95th, 5th percentile and 6 year old sized anthropometric test devices (ATDs) . Data obtained include head and chest triaxial accelerations, femur loads and belt loads for the ATDs. High speed movies allowed comparisons of ATD kinematics during the sled tests with ATD model kinematics obtained from the computer simulations. A commercially available belt pre- loader was used during the sled tests along with: nylon webbing, polyester webbing and two levels of force limiting webbing. The system was also evaluated using a force- limiting active lap belt and these results are compared with non-preloaded, standard webbing belt system responses. Results of this experimental and simulation study demonstrate that the FMVSS 208 performance evaluation criteria are met at 45 MPH velocity change for the 50th percentile ATD right front passenger and at lower speeds (but greater than 30 MPH) for other adult-sized right front passengers. Compliance of a 50th percentile driver is also demonstrated at 34 MPH. 1296 0096-736X/81 /8902-1 296$02.50 Copyright 1981 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">the system will be disengaged prior to the crash, thereby being no more effective than the unused active system. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has defined an auto- motive crash safety program wherein passive occupant protection goals in frontal impacts are being extended first to higher speed and more recently to greater emphasis on small cars. Traditionally when one thinks of passive restraint systems one thinks of Air Cushion Restraint Systems (ACRS) commonly called "air bags". ACRS and standard webbing passive belt restraint systems have been demonstrated to be effective occupant protection devices in car crashes at 30 MPH in both large and small cars (1)(2).* Further- more, research and development have shown that occupant protection capability exists for the ACRS at even higher speeds, 40 to 45 MPH, and in smaller vehicles (3,4). Alternatively, belt systems comprised of standard webbing (nylon or polyester) have been shown to impart loads to the upper torso that could be injury-producing (5). Herein lies the rationale behind this reported development work . The objectives of this program were multi-faceted. They were: (1) to develop a producible belt restraint system that in addition to limiting the upper torso load applied to an anthropometric test device (ATD) would include: a capability for passivity, a capability for determining use of the belt under load after the crash, produce perform- ance evaluation criteria data less than or equal to the limits prescribed in FMVSS 208 at speeds of 40 MPH or higher in a small car (Chrysler L-body) during frontal impact sled testing; (2) to investigate the effects of pretensioning of the belt system; and (3) to compare the results of three dimensional computer simulations of the occupant with the results of sled tests. In order to develop and evaluate this system Calspan Corporation performed 40 sled test crash simulations on the 12 inch HYGE sled facility and 28 three dimensional computer simulations utilizing the Calspan- developed CVS III digital computer program. RESTRAINT SYSTEM DEFINITION This section describes the considerations evaluated in the evolvement of the force limited belt restraint system for small cars. Because of the desire to develop a system that would have at least a "near-production" capability, only currently producible components were considered. VEHICLE DETERMINATION - The first step in the development of any restraint system is the determination of a representative vehicle. For this work a Chrysler Corpora- tion L-body (Omni -Horizon) was chosen based upon information supplied to the NHTSA that it was Chrysler's intent to maintain production of this basic interior for at least a five year period. Chrysler agreed to sell an L-body (body-in-white) to Calspan Corporation for the purpose of building a body buck for sled testing. Chrysler also supplied a 30 MPH barrier crash pulse from an L-body crash test. Having determined the vehicle and, through the crash deceleration pulse, the crash environment (crash environment in this context only means the deceleration severity in the longitudinal direction and does not take into account such parameters as vehicle pitch, intrusion, etc.) performance evaluation criteria limits were determined. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CRITERIA GOALS - As stated earlier, one of the objectives of this program was to develop a belt restraint system for small cars that would produce performance evaluation criteria levels that are less than or equal to those upper limits stated in FMVSS 208 at a velocity change of 40 MPH or greater. In an effort to minimize the number of sled tests required to develop and evaluate the system it was decided that the 50th percentile male anthropometric test device (ATD) would be the primary surrogate used and that the performance evaluation criteria goals for this ATD would be 75 percent of the FMVSS 208 limits. It was believed that if these goals could be attained then there would be a high prob- ability that the other-sized ATDs (5th percentile female, 95th percentile male and 6 year old child) would produce performance evaluation criteria within the FMVSS 208 limits. These goals were: Head Injury Criteria (HIC) 750 Chest Resultant Acceleration 45 Gp Femur Compressive Loads 1700 lbs. In addition to meeting these specifically defined upper limits, it was determined that upper torso belt loads would be limited to a force of 1500 lbs. PASSIVITY AND COMFORT CONSIDERATIONS - The FMVSS 208 implementation dictates that all automobiles manufactured or marketed in the United States by 1984 must afford passive protection for front seat occupants. In light of this, the decision was made that the belt system developed should have the capability of passivity. It was also decided that comfort (implying greater consumer acceptance, thereby use) to the occupant should also be considered. The primary comfort consideration in a passive belt system (according to Dr. Woodson of Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. 1297</page><page sequence="3">1298 M. J. WALSH AND B. J. KELLEHER Manfactors Corporation) is the Scrubbing1 effect of the upper torso belt on the occupant's shoulder when the emergency locking retractor (ELR) is positioned inboard. It was decided. that the ELR in this system would be positioned outboard of the occupant. Discussions with Drs. Woodson and Black of Manfactors Corporation aided in the final choice of the ELR, D-Ring and anchor point locations. FORCE LIMITING CONSIDERATIONS - The Takata-Kojyo Company of Japan was selected as the supplier of force-limiting energy absorbing belt material for several reasons: 1. Their webbing produced excellent force deflection properties and upon short notice they could produce webbing with accurate force-limiting properties in the 500 lb. to 2000 lb. range. 2. The webbing provided excellent indication of use due to the clearly visible broken belt fibers after loading. 3. Their webbing was production feasible, consumer acceptable (its appearance is that of conventional webbing, but slightly thicker) and its availability was immediate and economical. Due to the ease of availability of this material it was decided that two levels of force limiting would be evaluated, 1500 lb. and 1000 lb. Consideration was given to one other device in production that was advertised to be an energy managing and use indicating product. A.B. Stil of Sweden manufactures a web shredding D-ring and, since some of these D-rings were available to the program, it was decided that they also would be evaluated. BELT PRETENSIONING CONSIDERATIONS - In general, passive belt systems require that more webbing be stored on the reel of the ELR after belt deployment. This additional length of webbing increases the 'spool off' length normally observed when active belt systems are used for occupant protection in crash situations. In systems designed to limit the forces in the belt by elongation (be it metal forming, webbing shredding or webbing stretching) this 'spool-off' problem is compounded by the very nature of the energy managing mechanism. The loss of effective stroking distance dictated by the above requirements is of even higher concern when the available space of a small car occupant compartment is considered. For these reasons it was determined that the use of a belt pretensioner would be investigated. A pretensioning device, manufactured by Repa of Germany, was commercially available at the outset of this program (6). This device consists of a Pelton wheel mounted on an ELR (Figure 1). For operation the unit requires a crash sensor and power source to fire a powder charge. The expanding gas drives a piston that forces a fluid over the Pelton wheel attached to the ELR spool. The direction of rotation of the spool is such that the belt is tightened on the spool and tension is produced in the webbing. The Repa unit, being close to a production piece of hardware, was chosen as the primary pretensioner for this effort. In summary, the definition of the force limited restraint system, based upon the foregoing descriptions was as follows: An ELR (incorporating the Repa belt pretensioner) mounted in the front door of the Chrysler L-body would allow the energy managing webbing to proceed upward just forward of the door to B-pillar junction and travel through a D-ring, attached to the door, down across the upper and lower torso of the occupant and be terminated at a solid anchor point on the inboard side of the vehicle front seat. An energy managing knee bar would be placed approximately four inches in front of the knees of a 50th per- centile male sized ATD when the seat was placed in the mid seating position for the purpose of controlling the lower extremities (hips, femurs, etc.) loads and displacements. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS Concurrent with the restraint system definition phase of this program, an analytical effort to determine and ultimately to predict performance criteria was carried out by means of three-dimensional computer simulations. The computer program used in this study was the Calspan-developed Crash Fig. 1 - Repa belt pretensioner utilized in the force limiting belt system</page><page sequence="4">PASSIVE BELT SYSTEM 1299 Victim Simulation version 18C, (CVS- III). A secondary objective of this computer simulation study was to define the sensitiv- ity of the various input parameters. The CVS III program is described in detail in Reference 7, but for the sake of complete- ness a brief description is presented below. CALSPAN 3-D CRASH VICTIM SIMULATION PROGRAM - The manner in which the crash victim has been modeled in most applications of the simulation to date is illustrated in Figure 2. The human body is represented as being composed of 15 segments connected by 14 joints. The simulated torso is articulated in thr.ee segments and the neck is approximated as a single segment with two joints. All joints are usually considered to be ball and socket joints except the knees and elbows which, because they effectively permit only a single degree of freedom, are represented as pin joints. Ellipsoids are used to approximate the surface of each body segment. The computer program requires literally hundreds of inputs to describe the ATD model parameters which include the length, weight, center of gravity location and principal moment of inertia about each of three orthogonal axes of each segment, and the joint torque characteristics as a function of the angular displacement and velocity of each joint. In addition, inputs are required that include the geometric and compliance properties of the vehicle interior surfaces, a tabular or functional definition of the deceleration time history of the vehicle, and the occupant restraint characteristics (e.g., belts, knee bars, etc.). The vehicle interior and seating surfaces are represented in the program input as planes, each requiring a force-deflection characteristic in either tabular or polynomial form. Contact between selected occupant segments and interior planes is designated in the allowed contact matrix which is also part of the program input. The extensive output from the program is controllable through input code and includes such items as the components and resultants of linear and angular acceler- ations, velocity and displacement of specified segments, joint, vehicle, and belt loads. A simplified representation of occupant kinematics is also provided (designated as a printerplot) showing the location of body segment joints and centers of gravity at specified points in time. Figure 3 illustrates printer plots which were selected at significant time intervals and overlaid giving a visual display of occupant kinematics. The program generates a binary unformatted tape (or disk) , which may be accessed to list tabular time histories and to plot, as a function of any ( y) JOINTS AH ' HP HEAD PIVOT &gt; ^ &gt;f ^yÇ f NP NECK PIVOT J ' J W WAIST '#HP^^ p PELVIS J RH RIGHT HIP S I NP^' Lc RK RIGHT KNEE / S I I -A Lc RA RIGHT ANKLE yRsV M LH LEFT H,p / I It J LK LEFT KNEE iti I UT /' LA LEFT ANKLE I I I I I LUA RS RIGHT SHOULDER ''l I Ji J I RE RIGHT ELBOW RUA I I Ls LEFT SHOULDER [ /IT LE LEFT ELBOW SEGMENTS I J H HEAD ill I / N NECK III / L L'- UT UPPER TORSO il!

The plotting capability of the CVS III program is especially adaptable to this belt study in that all the data can be easily compared with the sled data. Figure 4 presents an example of head excursion comparisons between simulation and sled data. CVS III INPUT PARAMETERS - Vehicle interior geometry is normally obtained from either production drawings or actual measurements taken from the vehicle under investigation. The contact surface data are usually input to the CVS III program as a series of appropriately sized and placed flat planes although when necessary, a contact surface may be input as an ellipsoid. Initial input parameters to the CVS III program for this study were based upon the restraint system definition described previously. These input parameters consisted of: dimensions of the occupant space determined from a full scale drawing of the Omni-Horizon, typical force-deflection characteristics of contact panels that had been determined from previous CVS III simulations of small cars (8), an energy managing knee bar force-deflection curve estimated on the desired performance char- acteristics of the system to be integrated into the body buck, belt force-deflection characteristics based upon available data on standard and energy managing webbing (9) (10), a 30 MPH barrier crash pulse supplied by the Chrysler Corporation, and a model of the 50th percentile Part 572 ATD. The above input parameters were tailored somewhat to assess the impact of input changes and to bring the simulation occupant- response data closer to that observed in the sled tests. Because the determination of belt force-deflection characteristics was critical to this study, this effort will be discussed in some detail. BELT FORCE-DEFLECTION CHARACTERISTICS - This task consisted of refining the dynamic belt force-deflection functions and analyzing the resulting occupant responses. With regard to this particular belt study, it should be understood that the CVS III version available for use at this time (Version 18C) does not take into account such phenomena as belt slippage on the ATD, actual belt friction, irregular belt stretch and belt rotation from the lower anchor points to the ATD H-points. The belt force- deflection input curves actually simulate mutual ATD/belt effective interaction characteristics. Thus, the belt curves generated include dynamic spool -off, dummy compliance, effective force-limiting levels and effective webbing elongation . A typical belt force-deflection function curve for 150.0 lb. force- limited webbing is presented in Figure 5.

Section b of the curve indicates that 1500 lb. force limiting webbing, when faired through the oscillations found on sled data traces, force-limits at an average load of 1350 lbs. with 30 percent elongation. When the force-limiting elongation has been expended the belt stress/ strain properties revert to nylon webbing characteristics (section c) . Belt force-deflection function curves were determined for all of the belt con- figurations used during the sled testing and a data base of computer simulations was created. Table 1 presents a description of these simulations. The sensitivity of the belt force- deflection function input curve can be seen in comparison plots of shoulder belt load vs. time as displayed in Figures 6 and 7. The simulation belt input curve contained 4 inches of spool-off. Figure 6 shows that when this simulation data is compared with sled data with a measured spool-off of 4 inches the correlation is quite good both in pulse shape and peak value. On the other hand, (Figure 7) when a comparison is made with a sled run having identical nylon webbing but a measured spool -off of 8 inches,</page><page sequence="6">PASSIVE BELT SYSTEM 1301 Table 1 - Computer Simulation Data Base S i mu 1 at i on of Sled Run Number Descript ion 1 Baseline System With Nylon Webbing No-Preloading 2 Dynamic Pre-Loaded System With Nylon Webbing 7&gt; Porce- Limited Webbing With No Pre- Load ing 4, S Dynamic Pre-Loaded System With Force Limited Webbing 6 Dynamic Pre-Loaded System With Force- Limited Webbing And Active Lap Belt 8 Dynamic Pre-Loaded System With Force- Limited Webbing 0 40 MPI I 10 Dynamic Pre-Loaded System With Force- Limited Webbing O 45 MPH 11 Statically Pre-Loaded System With Force-Limiting Webbing 'J 45 MPH 10 Dynamic Pre-Loaded System With Lower Level Force-Limiting Webbing* 1000 lb. force- 1 im i ted webbing.

PREDICTIVE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS - The baseline CVS simulations of the occupant and the system responses, having displayed an acceptable correlation with the corre- sponding sled test responses, were then used to predict responses of the occupant and the system at higher sled velocities. As would be expected, the simulations predicted larger belt loads and head accelerations as a function of increasing velocity (Figures 8 and 9) , It is interesting to note that on the subsequent sled tests at these higher velocities the data recorded indicated not only the same trends but acceptable magnitude and waveform correlation with the predicted values . Utilizing the 'full system' (i.e., preloaded 1500 lb. force- 1 imited webbing) input force deflection function described earlier, the simulations predicted lower head and chest resultant acceleration peak values than would be obtained with the baseline system (i.e., nylon webbing). As was the case with the velocity change simulation vs. sled tests the sled tests of the full system produced data that indicated similar trends, magnitudes and waveforms to those predicted by the CVS program (Figures 10 and 11) .

Energy-Managing Kneebar - When a torso belt only is used as the major component of a restraint system it is necessary that a device be incorporated into the system to control both the femur compressive forces and the knee excursion. For the development of this reported system it was decided that femur loads on the 50th percentile male ATD be held in the neighborhood of 1600 lbs, It was also determined that this level of loading be controlled with a knee penetration of between 4 and 5 inches. A kneebar was designed and installed into the sled body buck. The design used hexcel aluminum honeycomb as the energy managing agent (1/4-5052- . 0007, 1.6 lb) with a sheet of 1/2 inch insulite covering for load distribution.

(1) Electrical noise precluded calculation of HIC. percentile female and the 95th percentile male size ATDs performance evaluation criteria values would allow for protection at higher velocity changes. The preloaded force-limited belt system did not perform as well for the driver as it did for the right front passenger. Table 2 presents baseline system and force limited system data (Runs 17 and 18) for comparison. During these tests there was head and chest contact with the steering wheel rim. The results of Run No. 18 indicate lower HIC and chest resultant values than those obtained from the baseline test. The torso belt loads are considerably less. It is believed that this phenomenon indicates that for a driver system the 40% stretch webbing allows too much stroking distance even when preloaded. A lower percentage stretch webbing and/or a higher level of force limiting may be required in order for a similar level of performance to that obtained with the right front passenger system to be realized. The purpose of Runs 6 and 14 was to evaluate whether or not the performance of the restraint system when used with an active force- limited lap belt would be denegrated. Head acceleration (implying HIC magnitude) increased in both cases while the chest resultant accelerations were relatively unaffected. The greater than 100 Gr value obtained from the head of the 50th percentile ATD during Run No. 6 was caused by head contact with the ATD knee. While the results from both of these runs are below 75 percent of the FMVSS 208 limits, the more subjective evaluation of the occupant kinematics indicate that the abrogation of the knee stroking distance into the knee bar causes 1 jackknifing' that is not necessarily desirable. The results of this development and evaluation program are presented in detail in Reference 12. The remainder of this discussion will address the specific areas of preloading, force- limiting, use indication and the six- year old size ATD problem. PRELOADING - Inherent in any belt restraint system is the requirement that a certain length of webbing be stored on the spool of the ELR after belt deployment. Generally the length of stored webbing is increased in a passive belt system. The webbing is loosely wound up on the spool after a normal belt deployment and during a crash, once the ELR has locked and the occupant starts to load the belts, the webbing tightens on the spool. Depending upon the length of stored webbing (the number of wraps about the spool) a certain length will 1 spool-off T at a relatively low force level. This 'spool-off1 essentially lengthens the belt while absorbing very little of the crash energy. In these reported tests the firing time of the gas generators of the belt pre- tensioners was set at 8 ms after time zero (time zero on the Calspan HYGE sled is defined as that time when the sled experi- ences an acceleration of 0.25 Gy) . This is approximately the same actuation time that is used during tests of air cushion restraint systems . Reidelbach has reported (6) that when comparing preloaded and non-preloaded belt systems the accelerations on the head are reduced by 57% and accelerations on the chest are reduced by 15.7%. In the work reported herein the observed percentages were 23% and 5%, respectively, for both nylon webbing and the 1500 lb. Takata-Kojyo webbing. It must be understood, however, that</page><page sequence="13">1 308 M. J. WALSH AND B. J. KELLEHEF these data have not been obtained from identical restraint systems and therefore a discrepancy in results may not exist. Figure 19 presents data relevant to the spool-off problem. Displayed in this figure are chest resultant acceleration as a function of spool-off length, upper torso belt loads as a function of spool-off length and upper torso belt loads as a function of chest resultant acceleration. It is seen that for a nylon belt system both chest accelerations and belt loads increase with increasing spool -off length but these parameters remain relatively constant for the force-limited system. Included in these graphs are the results from one test with the AB Stil web shredding D-ring used with nylon webbing and one used with polyester webbing. Unfortu- nately there is only one data point for each of these webbing materials. The nylon webbing, when shredded, provides lower chest accelerations and belt loads for the same amount of spool -off than does the non- shredded webbing. The polyester webbing on the other hand provides significantly higher accelerations and loads. The dynamic loading results of nylon and polyester webbing deserve further investigation. With regard to the occupants1 chest resultant acceleration, it is noted that there is little effect from preloading in this force- limiting restraint system. For standard nylon belt systems this is not the case as both belt loads and chest accelerations increase as a function of the effectiveness of preloading on eliminating spool-off. The average spool -off measured in non- preloaded systems was 5.6 inches while the average for preloaded systems was 1.0 inches. In an effort to determine if the performance could be improved at 45 MPH if the preloading were static (and constant) as opposed to dynamic (and transient) a sled test was conducted with a static preload of 300 lbs. on the belt. The results of this test (Run 11), when compared with the results of the Repa pre-loaded test (Run 10), indicate that the HIC number was reduced by the static preloading but that the chest resultant acceleration and upper torso belt loads were denegrated. FORCE LIMITING - Table 3 presents the sled test data for comparison of the results obtained from a 50th percentile ATD right front passenger at 34 MPH velocity change. This table displays data from the baseline system, the 1000 lbs. force-limited, pre- loaded system, the 1500 lbs. force-limited, preloaded system and two web-shredding, non- preloaded tests using polyester and nylon webbing. The parameters held constant in these tests were: the ATD, the seat position and the sled velocity change.

At first glance it might appear anamolous that the upper torso belt load on the test wherein 1000 lb. force- limiting webbing was used is higher than that of the test wherein</page><page sequence="14">PASSIVE BELT SYSTEM 1 309 1500 lb. webbing was used. This difference is explained when one considers that the 1000 lb. webbing is a 20% stretch material while the 1500 lb. webbing is a 40% stretch material. During the test, once the 20% stretch capability was used the material reverted to its basic nylon characteristics and the loads increased. Head excursions, in the X-direction, were not significantly different in any of these tests and there was no head contact with the vehicle interior components during impact. USE INDICATION - One of the objectives of the development of this belt restraint system was that it provide for an indication of usage. The interpretation of use indication is that the restraint system must graphically indicate that not only was the belt in use at the time of the crash but, more importantly, whether the belt system has been subjected to loads that require its replacement if the vehicle is repairable. While it is unlikely that it would currently be cost beneficial to repair a small car that had undergone a collision at velocity changes in excess of 30 MPH, use indication would be advantageous to the accident investigation and occupant protection evaluation disciplines. As stated earlier, and with both of these reasons for use indication having been taken into account, the Takata-Kojyo webbing was selected as the most likely system component to provide both use indi- cation and consistently reliable force- limiting in a near production restraint system. The high level use indication capability of this material is displayed in the differences in appearance of the webbing that are apparent between the pre-test and post-test photographs of Figures 20 and 21, respectively. Once the normally monochromatic (in this reported work the webbing was black; however the manufacturing process would allow the use of colored fibers) webbing (Figure 20) is stressed beyond its design load, white fibers appear (Figure 21). The AB-STIL web-shredding D-ring used with both polyester and nylon webbing also functions well as a use indicator due to the shredding effect. However, as stated earlier, there was no strong indication that a force-limiting capability was present. THE SIX YEAR OLD-SIZE ATD PROBLEM - Early in the course of the sled testing, a serious problem with regard to protection of the 6 year old sized ATD in a passive torso belt system was discovered. While attempting to obtain results for the baseline restraint system, the ATD restraint was observed to load the neck and left axilla only. A run was performed with the upper anchor point Fig. 20 - Takata-Kojyo webbing prior to loading Fig. 21 - Takata-Kojyo webbing after loading location lowered in the vehicle by 10 inches in an effort to attain a more optimum belt deployment over the right shoulder and thereby eliminate the neck loading. The results of this test were essentially the same as they had been for the previous test. Analysis of the high speed movies showed that the knee bar (designed for adult sized ATDs) was ineffective in restraining the lower torso of the child size ATD. The kinematics and loading mechanisms were improved by the addition of an active lap belt. It is the authors1 opinion that, based upon these tests, this size occupant</page><page sequence="15">1310 M. J. WALSH AND B. J. KELLEHER demonstrates a requirement for special considerations in passive belt restraint system design. CONCLUSIONS Based upon these limited numbers of tests it may be concluded that: • A torso belt restraint system with passive capability, force-limited at 1500 lbs., is feasible for adult occupant protection at frontal crash speeds above 30 MPH in a small car. • Preloading of the torso belt is not required in order to meet FMVSS 208 perfor- mance criteria for a 50th percentile ATD right front passenger at 30 MPH. • With dynamic preloading, FMVSS 208 performance criteria can be met for a 50th percentile male size ATD right front passenger at sled velocities up to 45 MPH. t Protection at higher test velocities may be attained with higher level, longer duration preloading than is currently available. • 50th percentile drivers and 95th percentile right front passengers may also require a higher level of force-limiting in order to meet FMVSS 208 performance criteria at speeds above 30 MPH velocities. • 6 year old size ATDs may not be properly protected by an adult passive belt restraint system. • Additional development testing is required to define the optimum force limiting and preloading as functions of occupant size, occupant position and crash velocity. • FMVSS 209 should be amended to allow the use of a torso belt only and the higher elongation required to effect force-limiting by the webbing.
