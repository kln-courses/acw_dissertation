<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRESENT CHAOS IN PSYCHOLOGY AND THE WAY OUT Professor WILLIAM McDOUGALL There is at the present time a bewildering variety of schools of psychology in open rivalry and conflict with one another. The Press and the general public, in America, at least, seem to be aware of only two of these, namely the psychoanalytic and the behaviouristic schools; and the newspaper writers and the average highbrow are content to mix snippets and catchwords from these two utterly different schools, ignoring all the rest, unless they add to their shop- window display some uncertain reference to the work of the mental testers. It is true that the energies of the departments of psychology in American universities are largely devoted to mental testing and to teaching behaviourism. Yet many other lines of research are actively pursued and many other schools are represented. In the universities of Europe, on the other hand, the psychoanalytic and behaviouristic schools are feebly represented; but many interesting develop? ments are taking place, all leading away from the psychology that was orthodox and predominant at the end of the last century, and constituting a veritable revolution in the science of human nature. Even the two popularly recognized schools are divided into a number of sub-schools: the psychoanalytic doctrines of Freud, of Jung, and of Adler differ widely; while behaviourism is of many types, ranging from the subtle and distinguished teachings of Professor Perry of Harvard (of which it is difficult to say why the behaviouristic label is claimed for them) to the crude materialism and rather childish negations of the extremists. Amidst this diversity of schools, only some knowledge of the history of thought can make the student feel at home and enable him to choose wisely among the many rivals competing for his favour. The history of psychology has been grossly neglected in the universities; but that state of affairs seems about to be remedied, for the last few years have seen the publication of several excellent historical surveys. My aim in this paper is to suggest how the various schools and their historical affiliations may best be understood by relating them to one deep-lying division which we can trace all through the history of European thought, but one which is not defined in any of the historical studies. Tracing this line of division down the ages to the present day, we 353</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES can by its aid introduce something of order and system into what must otherwise seem a chaotic welter. The clue I propose to use was first given form by Nietzsche* when he pointed to two very different attitudes to life and nature, and especially human nature, expressed in the religious beliefs, the rituals, and the arts of Ancient Greece. On the one hand was that view which is commonly regarded as characteristic of the classical period. It represented man as dwelling at ease in a world wholly intelligible to him, if he would but open his eyes to it and freely use his reason. The world was a fair and smiling scene of which man was lord and master. In this scene man's wonderful power of reason, of intellect, would enable him to guide himself without error or mishap, if only he found by its aid some simple formula which should be the cue to understanding of the physical world. At a very early period Democritus seemed to have provided this clue in his doctrine of the atoms and their perpetual dance. Others sought similar clues, Pythagoras in numbers, Euclid in the science of geometry, Archimedes in mechanics, all allied in their aim of achieving a per? fectly transparent or intelligible account of physical nature. There were then two great types of agency, Mechanism and Reason; and Reason could fully grasp and master its only rival, Mechanism. It is true there was religion; but in this mode of thinking the Gods themselves were fashioned after the image of man, and stood only a little above him through greater knowledge and more complete rationality; and they tended to fade into little more than graceful mythological figures, useful in the arts as symbols and as ideals of human perfection. The culmination of this view was the identifica? tion by Socrates of virtue with knowledge or the reasonable use of knowledge. This classical Greek view has permeated and in the main domi? nated European culture all down the centuries as the tradition of intellectualism. Nietzsche called it appropriately the Apollinian view. Alongside the Apollinian tradition, orthodox and official, accepted by philosophers and taught in the school and the forum, ran a very different current, one less bright, less clear, less sunny, but one which was perhaps nearer to the truth. For this view, man's Reason was but a weak and very fallible part of him, in itself quite unable to penetrate the mystery of the physical world, of life, and of man's own nature, and still less capable of controlling the dark depths from which his feelings and his actions spring. According to this view man was not set apart from and above Nature, near to the Gods by virtue of his God-like Reason. Rather he was part of Nature; and Nature everywhere gave glimpses pi powerful forces similar to those he vaguely felt at work within himself, forces tremendous and * In his early work, The Birth of Tragedy. 354</page><page sequence="3">THE PRESENT CHAOS IN PSYCHOLOGY ruthless, neither mechanical nor rational, biit rather of the nature of blind strivings, insatiable cravings, restless urges towards goals unpredictable, ill-defined, and indefinable, forces at once destructive and creative, forces with which man's Reason was destined to struggle during long ages before it could begin to achieve control of them by way of some dim and imperfect understanding of them. For this view, whatever God or Gods there be dwelt not apart upon Olympus, careless of the world. Rather the divine creative power that had brought forth all things was immanent in Nature, and was an awful mystery, not easily to be understood in anthropomorphic terms, not easily to be propitiated by gifts and rites, not surely beneficent to man, but inscrutable and dark, ground for fear, though perhaps also for hope. But, though the intellect was powerless before this dark mystery, some understanding of it might be achieved by way of intense feeling and emotion sympathetically shared. Hence alongside the officially accepted religion of Olympus was another religion of Nature-worship, culminating in the Dionysiac mysteries; and behind Olympus lurked the dim and awful figure of Fate or Destiny to which the Gods themselves were subject. This world-view, contrasting so sharply with the Apollinian, Nietzsche proposed to call the Dionysian. The Dionysian view of man may be said to have been given sober and scientific formulation by Aristotle, the great biologist, in his essentially teleological or purposive psychology, in his recognition, as the fundamental biological fact, of horme, the urge within every creature towards the realization of its specific form and destiny. To the modern mind it may seem f antastic to assert that these two opposed world-views have never ceased to struggle for supremacy, and still survive as active rivals. But such is the fact, and at the present time they are entering a phase of their long struggle more acufe, more defined, more decisive than ever before. Let us skip the Middle Ages to consider the modern age alone. For the Middle Ages of Europe were a period in which the natural course of development of European thought was distorted and overwhelmed by the dominance of the Christian Church, with its authoritarian claim to impose a supernaturally revealed religion. The Renaissance was a rebellion against the authority of the Church and a revival of the Apollinian world-view. With it came the beginnings of modern science in the work of Kepler and Galileo. Descartes gave to the movement the shape that it was to retain throughout the modern period. He extended to the organic sphere, the world of life, the strictly mechanical principles of the astronomers. He represented all animal bodies as mechanisms in the strictest sense, as machines and nothing more. By aid of his brilliant fore- shadowing of the principle of reflex action he made plausible the view that every animal action was the outcome of a strictly deter- 355</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES mined sequence of purely mechanical events. Thus all of Nature, every natural event, was made to seem perfectly intelligible. Man alone was an exception; to his bodily machine was attached a rational soul, which could interfere with the mechanical processes of the body, guiding them according to the light of Reason. Descartes thus founded the mechanistic physiology, which, begin? ning with the museles and the organs of digestion, circulation, and respiration, seeking mechanical explanations of all their processes in terms of an atomic chemistry modelled upon astronomy, ascended to the brain, and claimed to find all its processes to be equally ex? plicable in terms of the same mechanical principles. The brilliant successes of the principles of strict mechanism in the physical sciences, and their initial successes in biology, gave to these principles an immense prestige which prevailed throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only quite recently has begun to wane. Newton gave precision and new confidence to the Apollinian world- view by showing how completely the strictly mechanical principles render intelligible the motions of the heavenly bodies. The whole of Nature was viewed as a vast but perfectly intelligible mechanism, itself created and set in motion once for all by the Supreme Reason. And man, with his mysterious participation in the life of Reason, was but a helpless spectator of the strictly determined course of events. Thus the Renaissance and Descartes led to an age in which the Apollinian view seemed to have finally triumphed, the age of Spinozistic pantheism, a clean-cut piece of Apollinian intellectualism, the age of Reason, of the Deists, of Voltaire and Newton and Pope. The guesses of Democritus, the poetic fancies of Lucretius, had become the accepted creed of a science growing every day in authority and power. And it became the task of Philosophy, a task with which she has vainly struggled throughout the modern period, to reconcile this scientific view of the world with moral and religious beliefs, beliefs that seemed to be indispensable if man was not merely to live, but to live with some hope of living well. In the eighteenth century, then, the Apollinian view was trium- phant, and psychology, the theory of the nature of man, conformed to the prevailing intellectualism. The cosmos was a vast mechanism; the mind of man merely reflected this mechanical cosmos in an imperfect manner; and the problem of psychology was to give some account of the way in which this passive reflecting took place. John Locke, taking up Plato's great word "idea," gave it a new meaning by taking over also the ancient theory of perception propounded by Democritus. Ideas are subtle little copies of things which somehow get into the mind through the sense-organs. And having thus mys- 356</page><page sequence="5">THE PRESENT CHAOS IN PSYCHOLOGY teriously entered the mind, there they are, the content of the mind; the mind itself being but the empty receptacle, the clean waxen tablet in or on which these copies are received and stored. Then came Hume with his doctrine that there is but one law and one principle according to which the play of ideas takes place, the principle of association. And David Hartley, the physician, presently showed that this principle of association might be regarded as a purely mechanical law of the brain-processes. Thus the Reason of Descartes was resolved into the play of mechanical processes and his soul shown to be otiose. These simple mechanical principles were carried over to the nine? teenth century and actively developed by the Mills, father and son, by Herbert Spencer, and by Bain. And, in Germany, Herbart gave currency to a very similar psychology, of which also the essence was the mechanical interplay of ideas. Thus Reason, which Descartes and Newton had allowed to man as his soie distinguishing mark, was itself reduced to the play of Mechanism, and the Apollinian view of the complete intelligibility of man and Nature was apparently perfected; but at the cost of destroying Reason itself, the absolute competence of which to the interpretation of the world had been its initial postulate. Man had become a mechanical microcosmos that merely reflects the equally mechanical macrocosmos; his Reason an irrational excrescence upon a mechanistic universe, a universe of mechanical events of wonderful complexity, but empty of creative activities. In the later nineteenth century the Darwinian theory gave new confidence to those who accepted the mechanical interpretation of life, of man, and of Reason itself; and psychology became experi? mental and strictly "scientific," that is to say, modelled upon the physical sciences. It is true that the relation of the ideas (which were said to be the substance of the flux of consciousness) to the brain- processes, which they seemed so faithfully to accompany, remained utterly mysterious. But this mystery was for the time successfully shelved by the doctrine of parallelism, or the allied doctrine of epi- phenomentalism, according to which the ideas are, as it were, semi- real shadows east by the mechanical events of the brain. Wundt, the founder of the experimental method in psychology, though he claimed to be a voluntarist, contributed mightily to the predomi- nance of the mechanical view of man, largely by rendering orthodox the theory of psycho-physical parallelism. We see this most clearly if we consider the psychology of the late Professor Titchener of Cornell, Wundt's most faithful disciple, who carried his principles to their logical conclusion. In Titchener's hands psychology becomes, not the science of mind or of human nature, but merely the attempt to render a complete analytic description of states of consciousness 357</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES conceived as complex conjunctions of ultimate atoms of conscious? ness; a psychology of processes, but no activities; a psychology that refuses to take any account of meanings and motives, and thus, since it has no bearing on the problems of human life, which are essentially problems of meaning and motive, relegates itself to a position of academic seclusion. In France the development of psychology ran a parallel course through the nineteenth century. French science and philosophy have been predominantly Apollinian, priding themselves on their clarity and rationality. Laplace, with his claim to make all events strictly predictable by the mathematician; and Condillac, who converts his mechanical model of a man into a real man by adding to him one sensation after another, these are the typical French thinkers. And we see the tradition culminating in the atomistic mechanical psychology of the earlier works of Professor Pierre Janet, the contemporary dean of French psychologists. The predominant philosophies of the modern period have run on two parallel courses in the positivist and mechanist naturalism of Comte and Spencer and in the pure intellectualism of the idealists. Consider the culmination of the latter with the English Hegelians. Bosanquet accepted psycho-physical parallelism and the validity of the mechanistic interpretation of life and mind. Bradley, his colleague and leader, declared that the use of the term "activity" in psychology was a scandal. I said just now that Titchener's psychology was the logical out? come of the Apollinian tradition. But certain American psychologists claim the distinction of having carried the process one step farther, a step which, whether logical or not, was natural enough. I mean, of course, the development of Behaviourism, a childish caricature of the Apollinian ideal of perfect intelligibility. All human action is made to seem perfectly intelligible by reducing it to nothing more than a series of mechanical reactions to physical impressions, reflexes, and conditioned reflexes; the stream of consciousness, since it is denied all influence upon or share in these processes, is ignored, as unworthy the attention of any serious person. This ideal result is achieved by resolutely turning the eyes away from all the many facts that will not fit into this too simple scheme, and by refusing to recognize the problems which those many facts so urgently press upon us. That step I say was natural enough, so natural that it has found high favour with multitudes of freshmen and sophomores and with a half-educated Press. So much for the Apollinian tradition in psychology. It has arrived at an impasse, has provoked its own Nemesis in the form of radical Behaviourism. It has achieved its own reductio ad absurdum. Let us go back to pick up the traces of the Dionysian tradition. At 358</page><page sequence="7">THE PRESENT CHAOS IN PSYCHOLOGY the beginning of our era it was represented by the religion of Mithra, at that time a serious rival of the Christian religion. Christianity itself, with its doctrine of sin and redemption, may be said to have embodied it. But we jump again to the modern period. There for long it was literally snowed under by the new-blooming of the Apollinian view, which, in spite of its proud claim to sweetness and light, to unimpassioned rationality, was in fact an orgy of intellec? tualism, whose devotees were intoxicated by the successes of the mechanical theory of the world. We find only sporadic expressions of the Dionysian view. Jacob Boehme's mysticism was one such. Another is Pascal's famous aphorism: "The heart has its reasons of which Reason knows nothing." It is chiefly the poets rather than the professed thinkers who express it. It would be easy to cite many passages from Shakes? peare in illustration: "After life's fitful fever he sleeps well"; or, "Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, that would not let me sleep. . . . Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well; when our deep plots do fall; and that should learn us there's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will." But the Apollinian current was too strong even for the poets; and Pope's Essay on Man and Herrick's trivialities take the place of true poetry," which is borne only on the Dionysian stream. In science it makes a feeble and little regarded stand against rationalism in the doctrine of the vital force. At the end of the century a Dionysian revival finds expression in the romantic movement of which the poets Goethe, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other nature poets were the mouthpieces. About the same time it flourished in the Scottish school of philosophy, in the formal works of Dugald Stewart, Hutcheson, and others, until Bain capitulated to the rationalism of the English Association school. In France appeared one powerful, but isolated, exponent, Maine de Biran. In England utilitarianism was dominant. It claimed to be a purely rationalistic philosophy based on the intellectualistic psychology of association. Yet its most powerful exponent, Jeremy Bentham, introduced into it psychological hedonism, the doctrine of pleasure and pain as the springs of all human action, a perverted Dionysian element which could never be intelligibly combined with the pure rationalism of the association psychology. In Germany there was a brief out burst of Dionysian thinking in the nature philosophers. In the persons of Oken and Schelling it ran amok, brought disrepute upon itself, and was utterly repudiated by all the academic thinkers. In the middle of the century came the beginnings of the present Dionysian revival in philosophy and psychology. Schopenhauer, with his teaching of the primacy of will, and von Hartmann, with 359</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES his mysterious Unconsciousness and its all-powerful impulses, broke away from rationalism and founded a truly voluntaristic or hormic psychology. Lotze, in his restrained and sober fashion, shows some? thing of this influence. And indeed from this time many of the psychologists began, like Wundt, to render lip-service to the Dionysian view, to admit, if only in words, that will and impulse and feeling and emotion are not merely incidental accompaniments or attributes of, nor yet complexes of, sensations and ideas, but rather the very core and foundation of man's being, to which his intellect and reason are accessory and subservient developments. An inter? mediate, unstable position was found by those who, like Brentano and Stout and Kiilpe, could not content themselves with a purely passive flow of ideas, and, without adequately recognizing the intellect's vast foundation of subconscious impulse and desire, sought some place for true activity within the intellectual processes themselves. The so-called functional school of American psychologists, repre? sented by Angell and Woodworth, belongs here, presenting as it does a mechanistic basis with some uncertain and incompatible admixture of hedonism and a touch of the truly Dionysian hormic psychology. It was Nietzsche who pointed the way to a thoroughly Dionysian view of man, and to a hormic psychology which sees the creative urge to activity as the common foundation of human and animal nature; a psychology which frankly admits the obscurity of this foundation, without seeking to disguise it in a cloud of words, which refuses to pretend to the illusory clarity that comes from the accept? ance of rationalism and mechanism; a psychology which recognizes as obscure many problems that truly are obscure; which admits that we are very far from an adequate understanding of man or Nature; and insists chiefly that we do not distort and falsify the immediate teaching of experience in the interests of the spurious clarity and symmetry of a rationalistic system. It gives the name "instinct" to these obscure racial foundations of our active nature, without pretending that in naming them it has made them intelligible. Instinct is thus restored from the debased and false conception of it by the rationalists, from Descartes onward, as a mere link in a mechanical sequence, and becomes at once the deepest foundation of human nature and the prime problem of psychology. Man is conceived as having his roots deep in Nature and in common with the animals; and the animals are no longer mere machines, but, in their various grades, express, however humbly, the same obscure but powerful forces which have shaped all life, formative, construc? tive, anergic, creative forces, of which we obtain some understand? ing only through experience of their working within ourselves 360</page><page sequence="9">THE PRESENT CHAOS IN PSYCHOLOGY and by sympathetic intuition of them in other men and other forms of life. This is the essence of the Dionysian view of man which just now is coming rapidly to the front, displacing the threadbare and sterile view of man as a machine plus Reason, or as a machine whose Reason is but part of the mechanism. In France, Bergson has given it, in very independent fashion, a powerful advocacy. In the German world we see it attaining great influence in the somewhat distorted one-sided psychology of Freud and Adler, and in the more rounded and comprehensive psychology of C. G. Jung; for all of whom Reason is but a feeble shoot springing from the deep, dim, massive foundation of subconscious strivings of the instinctive tendencies. We see it in the personalistic psychology of William Stern of Ham? burg; in the now very influential school of Geisteswissen-schaftliche psychology, of which Spranger is the best known exponent; also in the verstehende psychology of Erisman and Jaspers and others, who frankly renounce the attempt to explain the course of mental life, seeking rather to understand it sympathetically and intuitively. These schools have rejected the mechanistic intellectualistic psycho? logy, because they have found it useless as a basis for the various social sciences and for application to the practical problems of education and psychiatry. We see a cautious trending in the same direction of the now so influential Gestalt or configuration school of Wertheimer and Kohler. And Nietzsche's view is being directly expounded and developed, by Ludwig Klages and Hans Prinzhorn, as a psychology of personality or of character, a characterology, as they prefer to call it. Common to all these schools is the repudiation of the mechanistic principles of explanation and of the attempt to describe our experience as a composite structure of atomic ele? ments, and the recognition of purposive activity, as something other than and at least as fundamental as mechanical process. And coinciding in time with this revival of the Dionysian view of man comes the revolution in physical science which is showing the in- adequacy of the mechanistic principles even in the physical sciences, and throwing grave doubt upon the validity, even in the inorganic sphere, of rationalism's favourite dogma, the strict determination of all events. The physiologists are coming into line. J. S. Haldane, distinguished among British physiologists for his many exact measurements of bodily processes, declares in his recent Gifford Lectures that to say as so many do, in parrot-like repetition, that physiology is revealing the mechanism of life is mere claptrap. In America three at least of the leaders in biology, Jennings and Herrick and Lillie, are in open rebellion against the mechanistic physiology. Two of the most influential psychologists of America are peculiarly interesting in this 2A 361</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES connection. William James represented very clearly in his great work, the Principles of Psychology, both types, without attempting to reconcile them; the Apollinian in his physiological speculations and his sensationism; the Dionysian in his recognition of the sub? conscious activities, of freedom of will, of creativity, and in his life- long interest in the varieties of religious experience and in the obscure phenomena of "psychic research." In this duplicity of outlook he not only expressed the width of his sympathies, but also he well repre? sents the time in which he flourished. Munsterberg represents the transition from the one type of Psychology to the other in a more explicit manner. Much more con? cerned than James ever was to attain formal consistency of doctrine, he began by accepting and teaching very confidently the rationalistic mechanical psychology. Then, in middle life, he became interested in the problem of values, and in the various practical applications of psychology. Now, in a purely mechanistic world there can be no valuation and no values, and for pure rationalism there is only one value, namely logical consistency. And, when we come to make practical applications of psychology, we soon find that man is any? thing but a piece of mechanism which in some utterly mysterious and passive fashion mirrors the world about him. And so these two interests naturally led Munsterberg to realize the limitations of his mechanical rationalistic psychology, and to attempt in his last book to construct a psychology of a radically different kind, namely a purposive psychology. He went over to the Dionysian tradition; for the clearest, sharpest distinction between the Apollinian and the Dionysian view is that the former leads inevitably to a psychology fashioned after the pattern of the mechanistic atomism now obsolete in the physical sciences; while the latter recognizes the all-importance of purposive striving and tries to trace the development of human volition in the increasing range of foresight which transforms the subconscious cravings and purblind urges of the animal plane into far-sighted, intelligent efforts towards distant goals and high ideals. I suggest, then, that we may most profitably group the many schools of psychology of the present and the past according as they reveal the predominance of Apollinian intellectualism or of Dionysian intuition, finding in this a principle of classification more significant than any other; and especially we find in it a clue with which to thread our way among the many existing rival schools towards the psychology of the future, which at last shall be able to assert its true place as the crown of the biological sciences and the base of all the social sciences. In conclusion, a word about the relation of the Dionysian view to metaphysics. European metaphysic has been in the main the attempt to reconcile the facts of experience with a rational, an Apollinian, 362</page><page sequence="11">THE PRESENT CHAOS IN PSYCHOLOGY view of the world; and it has commonly assumed that such a view must be monistic, that is to say, must represent all events as essen? tially of one kind. We have no guarantee that this Apollinian demand can ever be satisfied. It is certain that every monistic scheme hitherto proposed, whether idealistic, materialistic, energetic, neutral, or mentalistic, meets with difficulties that to the majority of thinkers seem insuperable. It is too early to infer that the search for an Apollinian answer to the world riddle is doomed to failure. But we who recognize that the Dionysian view includes truths which the Apollinian persistently ignores, deprecate the attempts, constantly renewed throughout the history of thought, to shape our science, and more especially biological and psychological science, in accord? ance with the demands of the monistic assumption. We regard such attempts as premature and as leading to the neglect and distortion of facts of experience of the first importance. We urge, as did Lotze in the middle of last century and as Lord Balfour has again done very recently, that, though a monism of some kind may be the ultimate outcome of man's efforts to formulate an intelligible account of the universe, no such monistic account is yet possible for science. So long as science shall interpret the inorganic world mechanistically, biology must recognize that it cannot do its work in terms of the ultimates or primary postulates of physical science, and must formu? late its own postulates. So long as it has not the courage for this task, it runs in a blind alley; it confronts the dualism of Mechanism and Reason; and Reason remains in constant danger of being swallowed by its monstrous rival. Only the recognition of the realm of events so difficult to grasp, so inadequately indicated by such terms as elan vital, libido, vital impulse, hormic urge, can lead us out of this impasse to an intelligible and perhaps a monistic interpreta? tion of the world. 363</page></plain_text>
