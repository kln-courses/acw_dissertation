This paper describes the complex of beliefs and practices surrounding death in the traditional and contemporary culture of the Heiltsuk (Bella Bella) of coastal British Columbia. Focusing on the culturally-constructed category of the person as both the object of mortuary rites and the key to their interpretation, I examine the symbols and practices of the mortuary process. The Heiltsuk person can be viewed as a construction of elemental forces; the mortuary process involves a deconstruction of these forces and the reconstruction of society. In the process, both positive and negative images of society and personhood are articulated. INTRODUCTION The significance of mortuary practices in the context of Northwest Coast ceremonial exchange has been examined in recent sym- bolic interpretations (Kan 1986, 1989; Seguin 1985). The importance of the dead generally in Northwest Coast cultures has been demon- strated by a number of works (Blackman 1973; Kan 1982; Wike 1952). Drawing from these and other sources, it is evident that specific modes of symbolic association among mortuary practices, ceremonial exchange, and the cultural construction of the person dis- tinctively characterize the cultures of the Northwest Coast (Kan 1982). I will here explore these associations in traditional Heiltsuk (Bella Bella) culture. The Heiltsuk are a native group of the central coast of British Columbia. In his- torical times they have lived mainly in and around the village of Bella Bella (now called Waglisla). The Heiltsuk language is spoken as well by the Xaixais, a more northerly group, most Ã³f whom settled in the village of Klemtu with a group of Southern Tsimshian (Miller 1981). Farther north, the Haisla of Kitimaat speak a related language. To the south, the neighboring Oowekeno of River's Inlet are separated only by a dialect boundary, and are culturally extremely close to the Heiltsuk. This fact justifies my use of Oowekeeno data. Farther south, the Kwakiutl speak a language, Kwak'wala, definitely not mutually intelligible (Rath and Lincoln 1980:2-3). Culturally, the Heiltsuk show affinity primarily with the groups north of the Kwakiutl, including those - the Bella Coola and Tsimshian - who speak unrelated languages (Rath and Lincoln 1980:2-3). The error in calling the Heiltsuk "Northern Kwakiutl," as has been done in previous anthropological literature, is obvious. Nevertheless, strong links exist between the two cultures, a primary one being the diffusion of important myths and rituals, e.g., the hamaca dance, from the Heiltsuk to the Kwakiutl (Boas 1966:114-116). l For the contemporary Heiltsuk, mortuary practices are at the center of symbolic cul- ture. Indeed, they constitute the most important link with traditional beliefs and Recently, the direction of cultural in- fluence has been reversed, with the revival of traditional culture centered at Alert Bay strongly affecting the Heiltsuk. Kwakiutl experts are brought in to assist with ritual performances.

Historically, the Heiltsuk accepted many of the cultural forms of white society at an early stage (see Harkin 1988a). However, imported forms were neither received uncritically nor to the exclusion of traditional culture (Harkin 1988a; see Blackman 1973). Continuity as well as discontinuity characterize Heiltsuk culture through time. It is important to keep in mind that cultures are always temporally constituted; the creation of an artificial dichotomy between a changeless aboriginal past and a degenerate present is such an obviously pernicious cliche that it need not be addressed here (see Fabian 1983; Smith 1982). The data presented are derived both from late nineteenth and early twentieth century sources, and from contemporary field research. I follow Fenton's methodological principle stating that when early and late sources are consistent they are mutually reinforcing, and provide access to a relatively stable level of culture (Fenton 1957:21-22). Certainly this coincides with the belief of contemporary Heiltsuk who live a Heiltsuk culture that is both modern and traditional. INDIVIDUAL, PERSON, AND SOCIETY For Durkheim, the individual is the product of society (Durkheim 1933:346-350). The concept of the person is a reflection of the essential categories of society; these categories organize both the positioning of the individual within society and the symbolic construction of the person itself. On the one hand are the explicit political, economic, and social structures that refer to the specific individual, on the other the mental categories that organize thought. Moreover, the "higher" aspect of the person, usually encoded as a "soul" is a simple reflection of the category of sacredness constructed socially (Durkheim 1915:262-263). A paradox presents itself in the dynamic expression of these categories, found in collective rites of passage, particularly those of initiation and death. These rites construct categories of society immanent in the minds and actions of the actors, by focusing on the individual as the locus of these categories. The categories are made manifest only as the product of a process that operates on the individual subject. The ideal image of society itself is made explicit only on such occasions. Moreover, this process in which social symbolic categories are made manifest highlights the very paradoxical, self-negating quality of these categories (Bloch 1982:218). Thus, mortuary and puberty rites focus precisely upon the very untenability of normal social forms in the face of biological flux. A model that grounds the concept of the person in normal social forms is thus problematic; a problem realized, at least implicitly, by Van Gennep (1960) and Hertz (1960). Rather, it is precisely in such liminal processes that the person is "constructed" as a social being. While the category of the person is thus the product of society, it nevertheless transcends, negates, and threatens society itself. It reflects cosmological , and not merely sociological structure (Hallowell 1976:359). Thus in the context of specific rites, ritual action upon the individual subject implicates society. Categories that are manipulated with respect to the deceased are the reflection of basic cosmological categories that organize the elemental forces of the universe, forces that threaten as well as constitute the social order. The object of rites - and particularly those of death - at the most fundamental level is to order and chan- nel these forces in such a way that the continuation of social authority is ensured. This continuation is marked by fertility, in the most general sense of social and biological reproduction (Bloch 1982:227). A living, active member of society is in this sense a carefully constructed arrange- ment of categories of forces. In general terms, the categories that organize the Heiltsuk universe and person can be seen as enabling substance, animating energy, and symbolization. At death this order is destroyed, creating danger and disorder: a negative image of society in which elemental forces are uncontrolled. This danger is reflected in pollution, closely related to desired fertility, but lacking control and order (Bloch 1982:227). Female sexuality and bodily putrescence are the two foci of pollu- tion, as I will demonstrate for the Heiltsuk, as elsewhere (Bloch 1982:227). The goal of mortuary rites is the management of pollution (i.e., contact with uncontrolled forces) through the creation of temporal and spatial boundaries in the form of taboos, and the careful deconstruction of the deceased1 s person (Kan 1986:196; see Douglas 1966:94- 115). HEILTSUK SOCIAL ORGANIZATION The basic social unit of the traditional^ Heiltsuk was the "noble house," (nuyemgiwa = "carrying forth" a mythical narrative) , a local "lineage" whose legitimation derives from its access to ceremonial names, privileges, and</page><page sequence="3">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 89 stories (Olson 1955:324; Boas 1966:37; see Levi-Strauss 1982:163-87). Nomenclature is cognatic but the matriline was, according to most sources, the preferred line of succes- sion, generally in accordance with the prin- ciple of primogeniture (Drucker 1936; cf. Olson 1949[6]:58). While descent was basically matrilineal, various modes of inheritance, including patrilineality , appear, especially in the case of chiefly titles (Olson 1935[5]:33, 1949[6] :58-59; Drucker 1936). However, nonm at riline al inheritance in at least some cases required fictive "adoption" into a clan different from the natal clan, which was definitely matrilineal, because names are associated with specific clans (Olson 1949 [6]:59). Finally, in addition to rules of inheritance, the personal feelings of the deceased and the ability to afford the position were taken into account (Olson 1935[5]:24). The nuyemgiwa was associated with an actual material house, in the winter village, bearing the lineage crest. Secondary houses often existed for supplementary living space and were headed by lesser chiefs of the lineage. Traditionally, only men held the high names, although female chiefs constituted an aristocracy through which names and privileges were transferred (Olson 1955:324). An individual house held several titles, including the title of the head-chief, asso- ciated with the founding mythological an- cestor. Membership in houses was qualified by degree, and fuzzy around the edges. The aristocracy was separated from commoners by their closeness to the privilege -holding center (Kirchoff 1955:7). Endogamy was frequently practiced by the aristocracy in order to concentrate privileges (Olson 1935[5]:33). CommonersT allegiance to a house was not absolute, and membership could overlap or be transferred. Similarly, chiefs in the post- contact era occasionally held rights to titles in different nuyemgiwas and changed affilia- tion during the course of a career. Above the level of the house, names and privileges are organized into a system of four clans (or septs): Raven, Eagle, Killerwhale/ Whale, and Wolf, in modern Bella Bella. Although the Wolf clan had no titles asso- ciated with it (and thus was a commoner's clan), the other three contained names and privileges: in some cases names referring to manifestations of the clan ancestor. The names (and thus the houses) within each clan were strictly ranked, as were the clans themselves (in the order presented above; Olson 1955:326). Although nuyemgiwa and clan affiliation was not in all cases absolute, a strong sense of identity with the totemic animal and crest existed, as among the neigh- boring matrilineal Tsimshian (Halpin 1984). Another relevant grouping was the village- tribe, consisting of those who shared a winter village, usually including two or three clans. In the postcontact period these village -tribes consolidated into the modern village of Bella Bella (Olson 1955:320). Titled persons held privileges in two dance series: the dhuelaxa and the caiqa. The former was based on the "secular" title and position in the house /clan structure. The Â¿aiqa, however, constituted an overturning of the secular order and consisted of a series of possession dramas involving spiritual entities representing negative elemental forces (hunger, death, consumption, etc.). Although only chiefs and nobles participated in the caiqa, the ranked order of those participating did not coincide with the "secular" rankings. The dhuelaxa was held in late winter, perhaps 10 days after the caiqa (Drucker 1940:205; Olson 1954:246). As the timing suggests, the dhuelaxa represented a restoration and reassertion of the "secular" structure of society, which was based on the relation of living chiefs to "heaven" and the ancestral spirits who dwelt there. The relationship of that which is living and temporary to that which is permanent and changeless is one of the central themes of Heiltsuk culture. As I indicate below, this relationship characterized the naming system. An individual "passed through" a series of names in his life, each one the manifestation of certain eternal attributes of a mythical ancestor. Heiltsuk social organization, from the level of the house up to larger associations based on clan and village organization, was basically segmentai, not segmentary, in that structural transformation occurs as a response to demographic, political, economic, and other historical forces, rather than as "regular processural events" (Stearns 1984; Boelscher 1988:28). The system was open to two modalities of transformation which constituted its underlying political dimension. These modalities can be described most generally as incorporation and opposition (see Harkin 1988a, 1988b). Thus, units at the same organizational level, e.g., the nuyemgiwa, are structurally opposed to one another. The relations between such groups are normally characterized by reciprocity and antagonism. Contrariwise, the relationship of smaller units to structurally higher-level ones is normally expressed symbolically as incor- poration. This incorporative modality may also obtain between structurally identical groups in extraordinary, dynamic contexts. Historically, external factors produced permanent incorporations or fusions. For instance, the reorganization of material relations effected by the fur trade and the reduction of population owing to pandemic disease led to extreme nucleation of the Bella Bella and other groups. Similar</page><page sequence="4">90 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 incorporations on a lesser scale apparently occurred in the precontact period as well. In the traditional system, incorporation was an aspect of any contact with the super- natural; thus, initiates to the caiqa were subject to incorporation, especially symbolized as orali ty, e.g., anthropophagy. All chiefs manifested specific, owned supernatural power. Thus formal relations with any chief were temporarily characterized by incor- poration, owing to the incorporative quality of. the supernatural. The act of giving away goods in a marked fashion - the prerogative of the chief - is thus always read symbolically as incorporation (see Goldman 1975:185). The human chief imitates the supernatural donor, and so incorporates the recipient (Drucker 1936). Thus in the limited context of the feast or potlatch, the host /donor who stands for his riÃ¼yemgiwa incorporates chiefly re- cipients who stand as well for their own nuyemgiwa. In situations where supernatural powers are encountered or displayed, the dynamic, incorporative modality transforms relations between social groups and between indi- viduals, with implications for roles of sub- ordination and superordination . The static ordering of titles and social units is over- turned to a greater or lesser degree by such occurrences, from the very limited extent of the feast to the more radical dimensions of the caiqa and mortuary rites. In such con- texts, negative elemental forces impinge upon and threaten this static order. The sociali- zation or "taming" of these forces is thus an imperative of the politico-symbolic system. As I will demonstrate, the sociological func- tion of the mortuary complex is fundamentally to reconstitute the social unit in the face of such a threat. The ability of a social group to reconstitute itself after losing a member is essential to its continuing integrity and survival. HEILTSUK CONCEPTS OF PERSON By "person" I do not mean the minimal conditions of merely human existence, but rather the symbolic dimensions of personhood as a cultural model of the actor in society: a relationship which is one of microcosm to macrocosm. Mere existence is the lot of socially marginal individuals who, unlike persons, are incapable of instantiating the categories of social life (cf. LaFontaine 1985:126). Mauss, writing about the Kwakiutl and Heiltsuk, describes the person as an actor in a bounded social setting in which "ail the actors are theoretically the sum total of all free men" who participate in a drama in which the totality of cultural categories are engaged (Mauss 1985:7-11). This notion of the person as a totalizing category can be extended further to include the criterion of a potential founder of society (see below). Mauss infers this by identifying the person acting in a social drama - in this case the Kwakiutl Winter Ceremonial - as the "reincar- nation" of the original founding ancestor (Mauss 1985:10; Allen 1985:32; see Seguin 1985:54-55). Individual and person can be seen as relative terms with respect to a dimension of "realness": a concept explicit in Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, and Heiltsuk mythology, combining notions of power, self-containedness , im- mutability, and connection to place (Cove 1987:75-78; Seguin 1985:45; Boas 1921:357, 1928:26-27; Goldman 1975:52; see Hallowell 1976:377). Real beings appear as founders of lineages (Cove 1987:113). A person is real to the degree that he is capable of reproducing human society, that is, precisely to the degree that he has the necessary qualities to do so. This concept of realness represents an important corollary to the notion of person- hood. It is the qualitative aspect of the categorical reality of personhood. Cate- gorically, the Heiltsuk notion of personhood can be seen as the product of three pro- gressively enabling components: body, anima, and persona (personne in Maussf terminology). These categories constituting the person are transformative rather than additive. To cross the boundary between any two of these is to engage in a transformation in the nature of a rite of passage. An individual minimally possesses a physi- cal body and a soul. The two are separable. During sleep, the soul frequently departs, causing dreams. This is perilous if one dreams of dead kinsmen, who may tempt the soul to the underworld. If the soul goes there, the person will die soon. If the soul goes only part of the way, he will become sick but recover (Olson 1949[3]:1). During waking life, the soul walks in front of the body, prey to shamans or sorcerers (Olson 1949[1]:69). The soul (p/cvai) is central to the Heiltsuk concept of person. It is identical to life itself when it resides with the physical body; its absence causes one to "forget oneself. M According to a contemporary informant, picvai is precisely an animating principle: Talk about our lives... if you donft under- stand anything, when you're sick, some people say your life - mind's^-going, mov- ing away now. That!s pfcvat. . . 'Hua, qvelakv pfcvÃ Ã¬ qents txa. ("Hey! Our life itself [is] our soul") (Mrs. Esther Lawson) . Loss of one's pfcvaT is the loss of control over one's life force, corresponding both to</page><page sequence="5">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 91 psychological and physical illness, as viewed by biomedicine. Thus, one may "lose the will to live" as the result of an emotional trauma. This condition, if unameliorated , leads cer- tainly to death. The final physical cause is often an accident, brought on by forgetful- ness or carelessness: "See, if Ifm too sick I donft care about anything, and my mind's going away. I forget everything . ( _ I don't care about anything when my pkvÃ¡Ã­ ( _ is going" (Mrs. Esther Law son ). Loss of pfcvai leads to a loss of "care," (sorge) in the Heideggerian sense of a being preoccupied with itself with respect to the future and the possibility of his own death (Heidegger 1977:22). At the moment the pkvm departs, one "forget (s) everything," especially with respect to future action and being. True existence then ceases, even if biological life continues temporarily. Indeed, if the sufferer recovers from this state - e.g., in a case of sorcery - loss of pJcvÃ¡? is identical to the cessation of life, even if this cessation is in some cases reversible. Thus I shall use the terms plcvai, soul, jtnd anima more or less interchangeably. PJcvai is the personal mani- festation of the basic animating force. At birth, souls come "from above," but also from the underworld. The former is the realm of the ancestors and founders of the world; the latter is where individual human souls reside. The underworld is considered to be a mirror image of human society, con- sisting of villages, but with all basic terms reversed (Olson 1949[6] :46-48). Thus, night is day, destruction is consumption, and death is birth (Olson 1949 [6] : 46-48; Boas 1932:142- 143; see Seguin 1985:51; Harkin 1988a: 131- 133). Reincarnation is one of the essential modes of communication between the human world and the underworld. It is common. Reincar- nates are recognizable by bodily signs and other personal characteristics recalling an- cestors. In particular, precocious speech, answering to the name or kin term of the deceased, addressing others by a reciprocal kin term, and a familiarity with possessions of the deceased, identify reincarnates (Boas 1923:22; see Adams 1973:26-32; Seguin 1985:53; Mills 1988). Twins are reincarna- tions of salmon and have special powers of healing (Olson 1949[6]:12). Indeed, children were considered spirits until they learned to talk; hence no funeral arrangements are necessary if a young child dies (Boas 1923:22). In addition to reincarnation, dead souls visit themselves upon the living in the form of nawalakv or supernatural power. Indi- vidual spirits may attach themselves to living persons as guardian spirits (Olson 1935[2]: 13). More generally, the spirits of the underworld are the source of the powers and privileges of the caiqa series in the Winter Ceremonial and also of shamanic power (Olson 1935[5]:104-105, 1949[6]:49). Conversely, death consists of the transmigration of souls from the human world to the underworld. At or frequently before physical death the soul separates from the body and joins the spirits of the deceased. An 1834 account states: "When a death occurs the spirits of those long before de- ceased crowd about the dwelling and receive the new member of their society" (Tolmie 1963:319). A third aspect of the self, which I will call the persona, can be identified. By this I refer to the social self, closely related to the ability to speak. The social self is precisely what is lacking in presocialized children who require no special funeral rites. The embodi- ment of the persona is the title name. The name is a complex phenomenon in Northwest Coast culture generally and cannot be described here in detail. For our pur- poses, I will distinguish two types of name: those that require potlatches, which I will call "titles," and those that do not. Of the latter sort are primarily kin terms used as voca- tives, nicknames- often derived from acci- dents or physical deformities - and birth names (Olson 1949[3]:110, [4]:90, [6]:60).2 Titles are members of an ordered set. They are inherited and are accompanied by specific rights and privileges, both ceremonial and material. Above all they imply certain characteristics in their holder and impart certain responsibilities: in particular to distribute wealth (Olson 1935 [2]: 24, [5]: 32; see Goldman 1975:56-62). A career begins at the age of 10 months with the first title. Ten months is the culturally-defined length of human gestation. Thus naming represents a second, social "birth." A normal career consists of five or more names, each of which requiring at least one potlatch (Olson 1935[5]:31-32). The proper way to "fasten on" a name required that four successive potlatches be given by the holder (Olson 1935[5]:31-32). The title mediates between a fixed symbolic order based on supernatural donation and praxis in two ways. First, with chiefly titles go control of resources and thus the ability 2 In some cases nicknames would be potlatched for, making the name the property of its holder and preventing its use without permission. This withdrew embarrassing names from circulation (Olson 1949[4]:90). They did not thereby become titles, as they could not be passed down. This does not invalidate the general distinction between titles for which one must potlatch and other classes of names.</page><page sequence="6">92 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 to distribute wealth. Second, the act of supernatural donation which establishes the title is analogous to the act of natural dona- tion that pertains to hunting and fishing, as well as to prestations that are the currency of social life (see Goldman 1975:61). Thus the title also mediates among titled persons, each of whom has particular prerogatives of giving and receiving that determine his or her relationship to other persons and to society. The obligation of the person who possesses - or is possessed by - a title is exactly to "live up to" the title by providing the "substance" with which to maintain it. The title epitomizes the persona in the sense that it is only through the title, and in the capacity of a titled person, that it is possible to "face" others. Like the mask in the Winter Ceremonial - which refers inter alia to titles- - the title presents a symbolic form to society that enables and structures communication. Thus the persona can be seen, as its ety- mology suggests, as being like a mask among masks. Although the majority of people had such titles, a class existed that had none, called xÃ¡mala ("orphan"; Boas 1924:330). This includes outright slaves, i.e., war captives, as well as persons such as orphans, the very poor, and others who lack access to titles or resources (Olson 1949[6] :60). The Heiltsuk call such people pJcvs, which also refers to a hairy humanoid creature that lives wild in the woods: a monster consisting of parts of dog, bear, pig, and eagle according to Boas (1923:24). Drucker calls it a "monkey dwell- ing in the bush," while Olson associates it with the sasquatch (Drucker 1936; Olson 1935 [2 ]:70; see Halpin 1980). Interestingly, pfcvs_ derives from the same root, /bfciW, as p/cvÃ¡i. The basic meaning is "human." PÃcvÃ lÃ , for instance, means "to speak, to use language." The term for "spokesman" ("talking chief") is pkvalÃ©lks. Thus, a pfcvs is one who is merely human, and has no supernaturally-based privileges (see Rath and Lincoln 1980:53). In this sense the pfcvs can be defined as the minimal condition of human existence, lacking in all symbolic value and "realness . " Not merely persons of low status, pfcvs were outside the social order altogether. They were barred from participating in or viewing the Winter Ceremonial on pain of death (Olson 1949[3] :109). Formal marriage was impossible, as it required the exchange of names (Olson 1935[5] :102). Most aspects of life during the sacred winter season were closed to a pfcvs, who found himself also on the outside of the formal order of society that organized economic activity (see Reid 1976:48- 49). The distinction between these two terms, xÃ mÃ la and pfcvs, seems to be that the former connotes status with respect to the secular order, while the latter connotes exclusion from the closed circle of the "secret societies" of the Winter Ceremonial. An interesting transformation of the concept of pfcvs is seen in the fact that both Heiltsuk and Kwakwalla speaking people, as well as the Tsimshian, found in the pfcvs monster a source of supernatural power, presumably because it is outside the cultural order. It was used as a mask within both series of the Winter Ceremonial (Reid 1976:24; Curtis 1915:156-66; Cove 1987:201-202; Halpin 1980). 3 The life of a pfcvs is a negative image of Heiltsuk symbolic life; such persons lack personae entirely. A human being living in society can be imagined as a concatenation of three progressively enabling aspects: body, anima, and persona. Certain persons - presocialized children and pkvs - lack per- sonae. The former retain the otherworldli- ness of their origin, while the latter remain on the outside of society, lacking a medium for relating to it. With these important exceptions in mind, and their negations of marked social life, I will attempt an analysis of Heiltsuk mortuary practices for a titled adult. Only in this case do we see fully the function of the mortuary process, the object of which is the deconstruction of the person and reconstruction of society. MORTUARY PRACTICES BURIAL If a person dies of illness or in another prolonged manner, a death-watch is set up involving close relatives. During this period, the dying person makes arrangements for the disposal of his material goods, including those with which he wishes to be buried (Tolmie 1963:308). Shortly after the moment of death, the corpse is removed from the house. Tolmie described one such scene witnessed in 1834: The sufferer [was] moribund, his head was adorned with down, and supported by a male relative, face painted and body covered with a new blanket. Close by stood an open chest intended for the coffin - at his feet sat a grey-haired crone who chaunted a dirge or coronach in which several other women who sat around occa- sionally joined (Tolmie 1963:310). 3This figure is distinct from ,_ al though semantically related to, the pgvis, a humanoid maritime creature, used as a mask in the Winter Ceremonial. This is probably connected with the land otter masking compie^ among the Tsimshian and Tlingit (De Laguna 1972:745-748; Halpin 1980).</page><page sequence="7">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 93 Mourning thus begins before the moment of physical death; this suggests that the loss of the pkvm is the crucial factor determining the end of natural life. The body was washed and dressed by paid attendants of the same sex as the deceased. They were unmarried and of a different clan from him (Curtis 1915:54-55). Today certain members of the community at large have taken on this role. The corpse was then placed in a box in flexed position, along with certain items from the dhÃ¹elÃ xa (Curtis 1915:54-55). Often, it had to be forced into the coffin, in such a violent manner as to cause the spine to crack (said to "release" the spirit; Curtis 1915:55). It lies in state in the house of the deceased for four days preceding burial (Tate 1883:111). During this time, the bereaved receive visitors. In certain cases the body was prepared by being disembowelled and dried over a fire (Boas 1923:6; Olson 1935[5]:70).It Later, the body was taken away, in some cases by three or four men in a canoe and deposited in a cave on a nearby burial island (Tolmie 1963:310). Another common burial site was in the hills behind the village (see Kan 1986:195-196). A nineteenth century geologist reported prominent burial sites, draped with red bunting, in the hills sur- rounding the old village of Bella Bella (Chittenden 1984:74). The body was placed at times in a small grave house rather than a cave. In postcontact times, miniature Victorian frame houses, with windows and doors, were erected for the disposition of the corpse (see Nabokov and Easton 1989:44). Pallbearers received rights to fishing (for males) or berrying sites in return for their services (Olson 1935[5]:70). No direct evidence exists for tree burial, although myths concerning the origin of death refer to it (Boas 1932:29-30). Grave sites, and in some cases even corpses, were maintained long after the death, whether in houses or caves (see Mcllwraith 1948[1] :453). In the best description of cave burial, two coffins were said to be contained within a single cedar structure (Tolmie 1963:306). Also present were animal skins, HudsonTs Bay Company blankets, masks, "and all the para- phernalia of the Tseetsaiak [cicaiqa = pl. caiqa] or conjuring" (Tolmie 1963:306). In addition, "five wooden figures resembling the arm and hand in an extended position were deposited in a niche of the wall- they as well as the masks bear the general name of nawilock" [nawalakv] (Tolmie 1963:307). NawÃ lakv is a general term for spiritual power and specifically for objects or spaces con- taining power, such as wooden figures "ex- tracted" from the bodies of initiates in the dhÃ¹elÃ xa dances by a shaman. In this case, the carvings appear to be associated with a dance involving the apparent breaking and severing of the arm. The mouth of the cave was concealed by brush wood and urine- soaked blankets hung from the opening (Tolmie 1963:307). Urine was thought to be anathema to ghosts. One major exception to the above types of burial occurred in cases of violent death, in particular if the instrument of death was a knife or gun. In such cases the body was cremated soon after death, rather than buried (Tolmie 1963:308; see Kan 1986:196). MOURNING The period of mourning actually begins, as mentioned above, before the moment of death, when women of the household begin to wail and sing mourning songs. This continues for four days. Each morning these women gathered on the beach, wailed, and scratched and cut their faces with shells and knives (Boas 1889:840). Mourning songs (qvÃ yayu) were sung each night after the death for four nights. A theme of the qvÃ yayu is the deceased's appearance in the land of the dead, where the old spirits are in awe of him, owing to his earthly greatness (Olson 1949[4]:32). During this period immediately following death, the body is attended by mourners. Food is smoked or burned so that the de- ceased receives it (see Boas 1928:143). In addition, the deceased's possessions are burned in order to reach him. If the object is to be given away, it is smoked and the "essence" of it goes to the deceased. Burn- ing and smoking are the essential means of communication with the underworld. The period between death and the funeral feast was one of high taboo: especially for the widow.5 One communal taboo existed; against bathing for the three days immediately fol- lowing the death. On the third day, ^Disembowelled, dried corpses were used in the hamaca or cannibal dance of the caiqa series (Boas 1923:6). It is almost certainly the case that only corpses intended for the hamaca were so prepared. 5 1 speak here of the "widow" because the case of the female mourner is the unmarked form. This is made clear by the association of mourning with menstrual isolation, and the fact that all the other mourners are explicitly female. These same proscriptions applied to a certain degree to widowers as well. It is interesting to note that contemporary con- sultants use a feminine pronoun when describing a bereaved spouse.</page><page sequence="8">94 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 however, the entire village, except the widow, was enjoined to bathe (Boas 1889: 839). In addition, close female relatives of the deceased, excluding the widow, had some of their hair pulled out by male relatives. Taboos and injunctions on the widow were especially strong in the four days following the spouse's death. She could not bathe and wore clothes of the deceased; later she must bathe each morning for the duration of the taboo period (Boas 1889:839, 1890:610). The widow was painted in black, or possibly red (Olson 1935[5]:8).6 She was not to cut or comb her hair for 16 days (Boas 1890:610). During a silent vigil near the gravesite, she maintained a flexed position, with knees under her chin. The only movement allowed was the stretching of the legs , which was done four times in succession (Boas 1889: 839). She had supernatural powers of vision at this stage. She imagined people she knew: if she saw them close up, they would die soon; if far away, they would survive. Thus, although she did not completely control her visions, the strategy was to try to imagine an enemy at close range (Boas 1889:839). Many taboos applied to the widow for a longer period, even up to the point of the mortuary potlatch. She avoided food- producing areas, berry patches and fishing grounds, lest the food sources dry up. Thus she was forbidden even to travel by boat over fishing grounds (Olson 1949[4]:78). Likewise, she was not allowed to cook or eat warm food (Olson 1949[4]:78). She was not to use a knife, axe, or other sharp object, for that would be "like cutting the throats of her relatives."7 She was fed during low tide by an old woman who brings dried salmon caught the year before, to be eaten with utensils belonging to the deceased (Boas 1889:839). Most significantly, she could not remarry until the mortuary potlatch released her from all taboo (Boas 1889:840). Her 6 According to contemporary informants, only black was used, and that only in the form of a small dot on the cheek. Boas mentions black paint used in connection with the baiqa (Boas 1923:60). Among the Bella Coola, who are said to have borrowed their mortuary practices from the Oowekeeno and Heiltsuk, red paint was a prerogative of males in the descent group of the decedent (Mcllwraith 1948[1] :464). Clearly, the oppo- sition of red and black is significant in certain contexts. For instance in the dances of the kaiqa series red button blankets are worn reversed, showing the black side. 7 This is a quote from Mrs. Esther Lawson. Many of these practices continue today, although they are not followed by everyone. inactive demeanor and the role of the attendants closely resembled the isolation of a young woman during puberty; both types are in fact called by the same term, Aikela. Its main function was to keep the widow out of society and the public eye as much as possi- ble. In particular, she avoided any stage of food gathering or preparation. Failure to adhere to this regimen brings "bad luck" and a "bad reputation," as well as the specific penalties. On the fifth day following the death, the body is buried and a funeral feast is held. This is the culmination of the initial period of mourning. Qvayayu are sung and the great- ness of the deceased is praised (Olson 1954: 234). At this point, a successor to the title of the deceased is named. The title is not, however, assumed until the mortuary pot- latch, which takes place at least 10 months later (Olson 1955:329). A second major function of the funeral feast is to repay those who rendered services in the preparation and burial of the body, as well as with the funeral feast itself. This can only be done with outside assistance, as "no chief dies with anything," i.e., he has given it all away (Olson 1949[4]:93). The widowTs kinsmen and others make donations so that all the ex- penses can be met (Olson 1935[5]:37). In addition, the widow is given material goods by her family to compensate for the destruc- tion of the deceased1 s property. Finally, the occasion can be used as a public forum for prestations that ostensibly are unrelated to the death: in particular, gifts to outsiders (Large 1906:249). This is especially true in contemporary society, as all public ceremonial undertakings have an omnibus quality. Detailed data exist on the funeral feast of the neighboring Oowekeeno which appear to agree in outline with what we know about Heiltsuk practices. Everyone in the village was summoned to the house of the deceased by an official inviter. The corpse lay in state behind the screen at the "head" of the house. Songs of the deceased from the dhÃ¹elÃ xa series were sung. Four attendants announced that the deceased had become a spirit, and named the spirit, which depended upon the deceased!s privileges. Horns were heard from behind the screen or on the roof, while dancers masked as clan animals entered 8 The same basic concepts - isolation and avoidance of the food production /preparation process - apply to a young woman at menarche. Her success or failure in hikelÃ¡ determines her future character and the course of her life. It is clear that the pri- mary referent of ÃÃ¬kela is ( female. Mrs. Esther LawsonTs gloss of Ydkela is "to take care to keep away from danger."</page><page sequence="9">iarkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 95 the house to take away the "body": a bundle of some sort, which was lifted through the smokehole. (Olson 1954:235). Alternatively, the body went to a spirit called hÃ yalhilaqs ("woman who heals or sets things right"), which was considered a lucky occurrence.9 When the dancers were in the house, the deceased's kin, excluding the widow, stood up, marking the transformation of the corpse into spirit, which fact was announced by the speaker. Four attendants uttered cries of "up Â¿p" to pacify the spirit, and then fol- lowed it outside the house, where horns were heard four times. They then returned to the house and called upon the high ranking ladies to sing the cry song. After five to ten minutes, the speaker told them to stop. At this point, gifts were given out by the rela- tives of the deceased, the main purpose of which was to pay those who rendered services to the bereaved in some capacity during the mortuary activities. A speech tracing the deceasedTs life and accomplishments was made. An heir was named who will inherit the title name of the deceased at the mortuary pot- latch. Finally, the speaker said in an off- hand manner to the heir "Now, young man, be around tomorrow and we will hide this box," the implication being that the coffin was empty since the body had been taken away by the clan spirit (Olson 1954:235; see Curtis 1915:57-58). After the burial and funeral feast, a slight easing of taboo occurred. The widow could lie down at night, but resumed the vigil at dawn (Olson 1954:235). She was allowed to bathe, but only in a special hole dug for that purpose and then only by gradations (Olson 1954:235). Her clothes were then burnt, along with remaining possessions of the deceased (Olson 1949[3]:2). The next taboo was lifted after 16 days, when the widow was allowed to return to society. However, she could not mingle with others for four months after the death of her spouse (Boas 1889: 839-840). A separate door was cut for her use. The first time she passed through it 9This figure occurs in an important dance in the dhÃ¹elaxa series; the mask represents a human face with desirable features. It is also associated with exorcising the possessing spirits in both the dhÃ¹ela&amp;a and the caiqa: in particular, the hamaca and the War Dancer (Drucker 1940:203-311). It thus has the quality of overcoming negative elemental forces, and acts as a restorer of normal human life. Paradoxically, to become a hÃ yalikila, or "Healer" in the caiqa, one must undergo possession as a hamaca (Drucker 1940:206). Perhaps being taken by this spirit signifies the decedent had been a hamaca. she approached it three times before entering (Boas 1889:839-840). Long-term taboos remained in effect for 10 months. The widow must not cook, must avoid food producing areas, must not handle sharp objects, and must bathe for four days each month during the waxing of the moon (Olson 1954:227). She discarded her mourning clothes by plac- ing them on a stump (Boas 1889:839). Her hair was cut (Boas 1889:840). She remained in mourning and thus could not remarry for at least 10 months, i.e., until the mortuary potlatch had been given (Boas 1889:840). The period of 10 months from death to the end of the taboo period is related to the culturally defined gestation period. Thus the widow underwent a symbolic "rebirth" into society, while the deceased was socially "born" into the society of the dead. MORTUARY POTLATCH10 The mortuary potlatch occurred at least 10 months and sometimes several years after the death, depending upon the resources available (Olson 1955:329). It is sponsored by the widow1 s family, and her brother or another close male relative will usually act as host. The main purpose of the potlatch is the succession to the title name. The heir will "bring out" the name on this occasion for the first time. Commemoration A second major function of the potlatch was to pay for the erection of a mortuary pole- or, at a later historical point, a tomb- stone - in memory of the deceased. The pole was erected by a different clan from that of the deceased and the heir. Payment was made to the chiefs of that clan (Olson 1935[5]:39). Historically, community or- ganizations such as the basketball club took over this role. At present the family itself is primarily responsible. Finally, the mortuary potlatch functions as a last occasion on which to mourn the deceased; the qvÃ yayu is sung for a final time (Boas 1889:840; Mcllwraith 1948[1]:472). Before the qvÃ¡yÃ¡yu is sung, a clansman of the deceased wearing a mask of the clan animal as a supernatural being brings out a copper, which he then hands to the heir. The heir broke it and distributed the pieces, referring to them as "the bones of the 10By "mortuary potlatch" I refer to Hertzfs "funeral feast"; the latter term is used by the Heiltsuk themselves to refer to the imme- diate postmortem ceremony.</page><page sequence="10">90 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 deceased" (Drucker 1950:292). This masked figure is said to represent the deceased himself (see Mcllwraith 1948[1] :472). His presence is necessary as an authorization for the dances to be used in the potlatch. After the singing of the qvayayu, the "deceased" departs, and the matter of his death is said to be "swept away," to make room for happier business (see Kan 1986:205). DISCUSSION: HERTZIAN STRUCTURE Hertz1 model of the mortuary process posits a tripartite rite of passage structure, consisting of rites of separation, liminality, and aggregation. Such rites can have as their referent the body or soul of the de- ceased and the survivors. In the most general terms, the function of the mortuary cycle is to achieve a transformation between contradictory states. Thus, the body is transformed from living flesh to dry bones; the soul, from the society of the living to the society of the dead; the widow, from a state of marriage to one of marriageability . Be- tween these terminal states lies a dynamic period of liminality that Hertz calls the "intermediate period" (Hertz 1960:29; Huntington and Metcalf 1979:9; see Kan 1986). I will discuss the Heiltsuk data in light of this model and proceed with a critique . RITES OF SEPARATION The period immediately following death is one of great danger. The deceased himself is the source of this danger, which spreads to close relatives and, to a lesser degree, the entire community. The body has begun a process which is the essential source of pollution, while the soul is dangerously unsettled: neither having been accepted into the land of the dead, nor able to remain part of the society of the living (Hertz 1960:34). The body requires constant attention during this period to guard against dangers resulting from this unsettled state (Hertz 1960:33-34). When death is violent, the dangers are so great that the body must be cremated. As Hertz states, "the violent action of the fires spare the dead and the living the sorrows and dangers involved in the transformation of the corpse" (Hertz 1960:43; see Kan 1986:196). The fundamental object of the rites of separation is to control the danger presented by the rotting corpse and unsettled soul by removing the body from the house and the widow from society. The Oowekeeno funeral feast described above was concerned mainly with the former operation. The "removal" of the body by the clan spirit simplified the mortuary process by creating the fiction that the body simply transmuted into that of the clan animal. This fiction was evident to all (in light of later handling of the corpse) but was nevertheless iconic of the process of separation. The funeral feast marks the end of the deceasedTs career as a participant in society by recounting his achievements and paves the way for passing on privileges to the heir. Finally, the close relatives of the deceased are separated from the rest of society by standing in relation to the others as host to guest (see Kan 1986:200). The isolation of the close relatives of the deceased, and above all the widow, is central to this stage of the mortuary cycle. Con- cepts of contagion and pollution dictate that the widow be removed from contact with all but those who are themselves close to death (i.e., the elderly attendant). Other close relatives, although less proximate to the deceased, warrant special taboos (see Hertz 1960:36-38). The identification of the widow with the deceased was for a time almost complete, as she maintained a physical pos- ture identical to that of a corpse in a box - as burial was in a flexed position - and must avoid movement. Also, the taboo on cutting or combing the hair gave the widow a corpse- like appearance.11 Taboos on grooming also served to separate the widow from other close female relatives of the deceased, who were required to cut their hair short. Injunctions concerning hair had the prophylactic function of removing those dangerously close to the death from the total pollution of the widow. The widow!s sole connection to the living world, eating, was maximally removed from sources of vitality, specifically, human society and the water inhabited by salmon and other life forms. Her food was dried fish, caught the previous year at low tide, and served with the utensils of the deceased by an ancient woman herself close to death. From the point of view of society, the widow was herself virtually dead (Hertz 1960:52). INTERMEDIATE PERIOD The length of the intermediate period is related to the time the corpse is perceived to require to transform into dry bones: "it is 11 The association of corpses and long, tangled hair, possibly related to the appear- ance that hair continues to grow after death, is pervasive in Heiltsuk thought. For in- stance, in the Ghost Dance the novice, repre- senting a partly decomposed corpse, had messy hair, and was accompanied by four ghosts also with messy hair (Olson 1955:341).</page><page sequence="11">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 97 usually over the dried and almost unchangeable remains that the funeral rites are celebrated" (Hertz 1960:44-45). A homol- ogy pertains between the process of bodily decomposition and that of progressive reinte- gration of the widow into society. As the polluted flesh sloughs off the bones of the corpse, so the tinge of pollution is lifted from the widow, who is by stages readmitted into active participation in society (Hertz 1960: 45). Taboos were lifted, beginning with the ones that maintain an identity between the widow and the deceased. The restrictions on movement, bathing, and grooming were first eased, then lifted, until the widow was al- lowed, after 16 days, to return home. Two essential taboos remained in effect for the entire intermediate period, however: she must avoid food producing areas and may not remarry. That is, the widow was not to be involved in social or biological reproduction. Indeed, she avoided anything connected with vitality. SECONDARY BURIAL A second homology obtains between the process of bodily decomposition and the condition of the deceased's soul. Not until the mortuary potlatch removes the bodily pollution will the soul be finally admitted to the society of the dead (Hertz 1960:45). The Heiltsuk did not have a true secondary burial. The body was not, under normal circumstances, handled after initial burial. However, the mortuary potlatch functions very much as Hertzian secondary burial: it "brings about a profound change in the condition of the deceased; it delivers him from the isolation in which he was plunged since his death" (Hertz 1960:55; see Kan 1986:197). Likewise, it replaces feelings of disgust towards the pollution of death with "feelings of reverent confidence" towards the deceased (Hertz 1960:57). In short, the deceased becomes an ancestor. Finally, the mortuary potlatch disposes of the "bones" of the deceased in the form of the ceremonial breaking and distributing of a copper (Hertz 1960:66). This transformation is seen in the text of the qvayayu itself. These mourning songs are among the most valued property of the house and clan and play an important role in focusing the collective emotions of the pot- latch participants (Kan 1986:200). The deceased is portrayed as a chiefly manifes- tation of the clan animal as mythological founder living in the realm of ancestors (also the source of the dhÃ¼elÃ¡xa): Going around the world, soaring around the world Is the owner of the Daylight, Oh great Chief Raven of the Daylight. You are the only one who owns that which sits in the sky Oh great chief Raven of the Sun in the Sky, You are the Owner of Daylight Oh great Chief Raven of the Daylight. (Mabel Humchittfs qvayayu of the Raven Clan. Collected and translated by Heiltsuk Cultural Education Center. Used with permission).12 This completes the process begun in the funeral, when the clan animal took the body away. The chief, specifically, his anima, becomes identified with the clan animal and its mythological prerogatives, as the body had earlier been incorporated by the clan as natural species /social body. The clan thus is associated with two distinct aspects of the person. As social group and natural species it is substantively connected with the body: hence they are the ones who "remove" the body and are one of the relevant groups marked off by the death. However, the clan is also associated with the dhÃ¹ela&amp;a of the Winter Ceremonial, as the dances are repre- sentations of the clan animal as mythical founder. This aspect is expressed in the qvayayu. Thus, the mortuary process re- veals two distinct modes of inclusion in the clan: incorporation and manifestation of permanent qualities. This final transfor- mation, whereby the dead chief is identified with the founder, can occur only when the body has been reduced to bones. The transformation from the state of pollution and taboo to one in which the de- ceased is an object of reverence, as depicted in this qvayayu as well as in the erection of a mortuary pole, is achieved in the Hertzian model by a type of sacrifice (Hertz 1960:63). Where is the sacrifice in the Heiltsuk mor- tuary potlatch? The answer lies in the destruction of the copper, referred to as "the bones of the deceased." Coppers are a complex symbol in Northwest Coast culture and are associated with blood and vitality (ilÃ¡qva = copper, red). They are in some respects analogous to human beings. They have anthropomorphic design, are named, and were explicitly destroyed in a manner remi- niscent of human sacrifice (see Boas 1897:564; Goldman 1975:155-158). Significantly, on this particular occasion, the distribution of pieces 12 Not all mourning songs are stately expressions of the heavenly repose of the decedent. Many emphasize the more contin- gent, if recurrent, aspects of death and bereavement: similar to what Kan (1986:198) reports for the Tlingit. This distinction is very likely correlated with status.</page><page sequence="12">98 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 of the copper incurred no implicit or explicit debt (Drucker 1950:293). Rather than refer- ring primarily to status relations between donor and receiver, the act of destroying the copper and distributing the pieces (to other chiefs) instead "establish (ed) a means of communication between the sacred and profane worlds through the mediation of a victim" (Hubert and Mauss 1964:97). Through this act of sacrifice, the deceased was introduced into the society of the dead as the heir was introduced, in his new capacity, into the society of the living. A Koskimo (Kwakiutl) account states this explicitly: when the copper is broken the heir says "so now GwaTimkin (i.e., the deceased) is dead" (Drucker 1950:292). Not only was the copper the sacrificial victim, but it was analogous to the deceased himself. Like the deceased, the copper began as a body (coppers have "heads," "eyes," "backbones," and "ribs") and ended up as merely "bones." Concern for proper disposal of bones is intense. Bones can be misused as objects of sorcery. Sorcerers projected bits of bone into a victim to kill him, precisely the opposite of the healing shamanic operation of removing objects from the body (Olson 1935[2]:79). Likewise, improper distribution of "the bones of the deceased" would prevent the deceased from achieving a proper place among the dead, and the heir among the living. The distribution of such "bones" thus established solidarity among the recipients and the host. Secondarily, the high value of the copper and other goods distributed rein- forced the status of the hosts. However, this aspect cannot be seen apart from the sacrificial, cooperative function in the context of the mortuary rites (see Kan 1986:201). From the perspective of the widow, the mortuary potlatch represented her release from taboo and non-participation in society. Just as the deceased was introduced into the society of the dead, so the widow was re- introduced into the society of the living (Hertz 1960:64). Most importantly, she was allowed to remarry, and thus to become a complete and full-fledged participant in society as a potential genetrix. Likewise, she returned to the cycle of food production and consumption. She became an agent of social and biological reproduction, and thus was incorporated into the body of society. This is the universal resolution of mortuary rites, the reestablishment of principles of life and reproduction (Huntington and Metcalf 1979; Bloch and Parry 1982; Kan 1986:205). CRITIQUE: DECONSTRUCTION OF THE PERSON According to Hertz, death effects the destruction of the "social being grafted upon the physical individual and to whom the collective consciousness attributed great dignity and importance" (Hertz 1960:77). Thus, society is "stricken in the very prin- ciple of its life" when an important member dies (Hertz 1960:78). Contrariwise, when children or socially marginal people die, there is little or no social reaction (Hertz 1960:84). This is explained by reference to the fact that such persons never participated fully in society, and hence society does not miss them (Hertz 1960:84). Yet this in an important sense contradicts the notion that it is the destruction of the idea of the person as a "grafted" being that is so devastating. Rather, it implies that the value of the indi- vidual to society is what is most importantly lost. Why should the loss of the socially marginal be any less important if it is the very principle of individual human life that is shaken by death? A partial answer to this dilemma can be found in Hertz1 implicit acceptance of a dualistic model of the person. Although he speaks of the social existence of the indi- vidual in the collective consciousness, he never considers that social existence to be integral to the person: as equivalent to the terms "body" and "soul."13 I have described a tripartite notion of the person for the Heiltsuk that I believe more accurately re- flects the reality of the data in this case, and probably in others as well. Each of these aspects has an existence independent of the individual person. Indeed, each has its own field of semantic association, and the indi- vidual is, in this sense, constituted as an intersection of fields. The body is associated with natural species: the totemic animal and, in certain contexts, salmon. The body is permanently part of the collective regenerative vital sub- stance of the world and is thus continually capable of manifestation as flesh after the death of an individual. Bones contain the seed of this regeneration. For instance, sal- mon bones thrown back into the water pro- duce more salmon. Therefore the proper dis- posal of bones of any sort is vitally important (see Hertz 1960:70). Bones that are im- properly disposed of come back as Â¿Ã¡Ã­qa. This can take the form of the "shamanic" 13 This is a direct inheritance from Durkheim, who rather confusingly sees the relationship between body and soul as analogous to that between profane and sacred (Durkheim 1915:262-263; Lukes 1972:467). Inasmuch as the sacred is a collective representation, this formulation equates society and soul: clearly an unacceptable position, and one that inevitably leads to a static view of mortuary rites.</page><page sequence="13">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 99 {caiqa) series of the Winter Ceremonial as well as shamanism proper. Thus, preserved corpses appeared in the hamaca and "ghosts" with decomposing bodies appeared in the Ghost Dance of the caiqa series. The pres- ence of body parts in such a manner, beyond the control of the organizing principle of personhood, creates danger. Only when the caiqa dancer is "tamed" is the danger finally and with difficulty overcome. In the case of the shamanic use of body parts for the pur- pose of sorcery, the danger is ever present. The anima, or p/cvÃ³i, is an autonomous soul that can exist in the worlds of both the living and the dead and can communicate between the two in several specific modes. In addition to birth and death, souls can depart for the land of the dead during sleep or vision states, while souls of the dead can appear to the living as guardian spirits or simply as ghosts. Ghosts are feared and avoided. However, manifestations of power not associated with a specific human being are nÃ walakv (supernatural power) which is at once specific and generalized. That is, nÃ walakv always takes the form of a named supernatural being and yet is always essen- tially the same: an animating principle that brings an increase of wealth and life, or what the Heiltsuk colloquially call "good luck." The persona is a social essence that is manifested in title names and privileges, especially in the dhÃ¹elÃ xa. These privileges originate in specific manifestations of nÃ walakv in the world. It is the stable, fixed, constituted aspect of nÃ walakv. Like- wise, the persona is a stable complex of power, privileges, and personality traits that is animated by nÃ walakv, and more specifi- cally, by the anima of an individual human. The relationship between the two is bilateral: while the person must "live up to" the persona, he also may choose which titles to acquire. Moreover, among the titles he possesses, the one to serve as his name (i.e., term of address) depended upon which best suited him (Olson 1949[4]:90). Similar- ly, the relation between the persona and the body is bilateral: a new mask was made for each new holder of a title (Olson 1935[5]:39; Fogelson and Bell 1983:63). A living person is a complex and temporary phenomenon, an intersection of symbolic fields. The relationship among the component elements can be described thus: persona stands to anima as container to contained, while anima stands to body as energy to substance. A basic meaning of death is the deconstruction of the person, or the gradual analysis of the complex whole into constituent parts, which then revert to their specific spheres (see Kan 1982:45-80, 1986:196). Each element on its own, i.e., during the intermediate period, is to a greater or lesser degree disruptive. The persona is ambiguous, the anima potentially dangerous, and the body positively danger- ous. On this level, the purpose of the mortuary process is to achieve a successful separation and disposition of each of these elements. The mortuary cycle represents this process iconically. During the first stage, the body separates and reverts to the clan animal (i.e., as natural species), becoming part of a generalized vital substance. During the second stage, the soul is at home in neither the world of the living nor of the dead. Finally, the soul becomes a full member of the society of the dead, in the guise of clan animal as mythological founder, while the body is recognized as purely bones and the persona is passed onto a new holder. Each process is analogous to the others, and they occur more or less in tandem. The Tlingit recognized this analogy explicitly. When a successor takes over the name of the dead chief, the latter is released into the land of the dead, while the successor "represents" him on earth thereafter (Hertz 1960:147, quoting Krause 1956). RITES OF PASSAGE AS TRANSFORMATION This analysis of the mortuary process as a deconstruction of the person localizes its paradoxical aspect in the category of person. The two most important transformations, of the deceased and the widow, are simultaneous and complementary transformations of person. The former is, as I have argued, a decon- struction; the latter is a "radicalization." The widow was reduced to the most basic aspect of person, the body, while maximally removed from the source of vitality, asso- ciated with water (see below). The anima is weakly attached to the body, which fact was evident in the widowfs visions. Persona, the form through which one participates in society, is absent, since the widow was entirely removed from society at first, and then only gradually reinstated. She entirely avoided the central consociation of food production and consumption. Further, this state of isolation (hÃ­kela) is considered the same as the liminal state of a pubescent girl who has not yet received her adult name. This condition is formally associated with a state of namelessness. From a perspective of a static, categorical understanding, such a transformation of the person is profoundly contradictory. Person- hood, normally manifested, does not admit of the possibility of being overturned or trans- formed. It is the unstated principle upon which all possible relations are based. Thus, rites of passage as "horizontal" transitions</page><page sequence="14">100 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 between terminal states, themselves acceptable as either presence or absence of personhood, involve inevitable contradiction. The liminal state, by virtue of its contra- dictory expression of two or more exclusive sets of roles, can be considered a transcen- dental level, which stands in relation to the rest of the system as "becoming to being, generalized potential to specific realization, dynamic to static, and transcendent to imma- nent" (Turner 1977:58). From the perspec- tive of normal social life, liminality appears as a source of uncontrollable, potentially dan- gerous power (Turner 1977:58). This danger takes the form of "implied negation" of the boundaries of "categories, relations, or groups, and . . . fixed relations" (Turner 1977:58). From the perspective of the system itself, the liminal phase is not simply contradictory, but rather an alternate state in which the elements of personhood are made explicit. However, in making these elements explicit, the very category of personhood as a stable articulation of elements, and thus the possi- bility of society, is threatened by the free play of elemental forces. Society is thus "stricken in the very principle of its life" because personhood and society are, tauto- logically, images of each other (Hertz 1960:84). Society is of course composed of persons. More importantly, a theory of personhood is a mapping of society's relation- ship to the outside, which is in turn reflected in social institutions (see Hallowell 1976:359). For the Heiltsuk such a mapping can be seen in the personal series (body, anima, persona) which js homologous to the societal series (clan, caiqa, dhÃ¹elaxa). This is not to say that a direct equivalence holds between corresponding items, but rather that each series can be described most generally as enabling substance, forces that are naturally uncontrolled but controllable, and formal manipulation and display of power. Ritual is effective insofar as it is capable of modelling subjective (egocentric) and objective (sociocentric) perspectives at once, of reorganizing the actor's experience while manipulating the hierarchical relations between higher-level structural principles and specific elements and objects (Munn 1973:605-606; Turner 1977:63). This structural homology between the categories of the person and of society enables ritual to act on both the individuals involved and society itself by reference to a single symbolic framework (Munn 1973:593). This framework is actualized in ritual, which in turn is iconically manipulated so that the situation can be restructured (Munn 1973:597). Specifically, the mortuary ritual involves the construction, maintenance, and crossing of boundaries . Boundary maintenance, the function of taboo, is a central aspect of Heiltsuk mor- tuary rites. Boundaries are maintained on three levels. First, society is separated from those afflicted by death. This takes strong and weak forms: relatively strong with respect to the corpse, relatively weak with respect to relatives of the deceased (other than the spouse). Secondly, within the community of the afflicted, boundaries are maintained between different degrees of closeness to death; only the deceased himself is fully and irrevocably outside society. The widow was separated both from the deceased and from other relatives, which fact was marked by, e.g., the contrasting injunctions on hair for the widow and for close female relatives. Finally, boundaries are maintained between constituent elements of both the person and society. In the context of a transformational framework, boundary crossing itself becomes a sacred, constituting act. Thus, in "the pivoting of the sacred" society itself appears to the subject as sacred; sacredness is a relative, not absolute, term that is defined with reference to ritually-constituted bounda- ries (Van Gennep 1960:18). A model for crossing boundaries and achieving successful transformation is common in Northwest Coast mythology (Boas 1921:1127; Goldman 1975: 100). The basic elements of this model are as follows. (1) The protagonist is in an incom- plete or inadequate state, owing to some humiliation or as an autochthonous condition. (2) He successfully crosses a margin, either by undergoing some type of desubjectification (e.g., being killed or eaten) or owing to a particular ability. (3) He returns to a state of normality, but with the addition of a supernatural power resulting from his trans- formation, which then is controlled as a privi- lege. (4) From the perspective of the narra- tion, this privilege is a fact, part of the world as constituted. The particular forms of boundary crossing in the mortuary cycle are similar to this mythological model; the mortuary rites them- selves are a model for the constitution of so- ciety. The crossing of boundaries not only articulates the elements thus separated, e.g., in the deconstruction of the person, but cre- ates access to the generative ground of the system and thus provides for the reconstitu- tion of society. The final result of the mor- tuary cycle is the realization of the trans- formation which is embodied individually in the title name and collectively in the dhiielaxa series. The mortuary potlatch, at which the name is claimed by the heir, involves the performance of the dhÃ¹elaxa , which fits Durkheimfs criteria as "the eminent form and ...the concentrated expression of the whole collective life" (Durkheim 1915:466). The</page><page sequence="15">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 101 dhÃ¹elaxa, an ordered series of masked and "semi-masked" dances in which ranked chiefs display crests and other privileges, is a representation of authority, in the dual sense of structures of legitimate power and the sources of this legitimacy.11* Its performance at the mortuary potlatch reestablishes this authority and reconstitutes the social unit. LIFE AND DEATH: SYMBOLIC ASSOCIATIONS Ritual symbols are by nature multivocal (Turner 1969:52). This is particularly true of mortuary symbols, which are concerned with the general distinction between the opposing states of life and death. It is impossible here to trace the associations of all the symbols involved in the mortuary cycle. However, by analyzing a specific myth, I hope to establish semantic associations for several of its central symbols: water, fire, salmon, hair, and bones. I shall examine the myth "Raven Creates the Salmon" (Boas 1928:27-33) in light of my discussion of mortuary ritual.15 Real-Chief faces a dearth of salmon which he tries to correct by making a trap, which produces no fish, then by carving a salmon of alder and animating it, again without success. The reason is that he lacks salmon bones, and particularly the nose bone. Real-Chief visits Owner-of-Salmon and at- tempts to steal a bone by hiding it in his mouth when he is given salmon to eat, but is caught. Next, he hits upon the idea of finding the grave of dead twins, and in fact disinters a female twin and reanimates her with his Water of Life. He marries her, and explains to her his lack of salmon. His wife then begins to bathe at the beach, first merely washing her little finger. Real-Chief 1HAs opposed to the caiqa series, dancers in the dhhelaxa wear only frontlets displaying the ownerfs crest, permitting identification of the dancer. Moreover, the dhÃ¼elÃ¡&amp;a stresses a controlled "heavenly inspiration" rather than the uncontrolled "possession" of the caiqa. The dancer dances as himself, in his capacity of embodiment of legitimate authority, and not as a master of ecstatic experience. One possible exception to this distinction is the War Dance, no longer performed, which Drucker called "the only dangerous dancer in the series" (Drucker 1940:206). iÃ¼ See Curtis (1915:245-247) for a Nakwoktak variant. That version is trun- cated, and focuses much more directly on the thanatological and etiological aspects of the story. The text here is my paraphrase of Boas* interlinear translation. finds one salmon in his trap, which they proceed to roast and eat. She then suggests washing Real-Chief's hair, which she does at the same beach. She then combs his hair which feels, to Real-Chief, "as if [it] had been pulled." His hair then becomes longer and longer, to the point where it reaches the small of his back. The next morning his wife bathes again, this time washing two fingers. Real-Chief finds two salmon in his trap, which are roasted and eaten. The following morning his wife again bathes, putting an entire hand in the water. Real- Chief finds many salmon in his trap, so many that they are not eaten fresh but are dried. The hanging up and drying of the fish require the labor of both Real Chief and his wife. Real-Chiefs hair has become so long that it gets tangled in the drying line. A very old woman has appeared and is sitting in his house. Real-Chief, referring to catching his hair in the line, states "You tried to pull me, you who came from the ghosts." His wife hears this and asks Real-Chief what he has said; Real-Chief says that he "spoke gratefully of [the] food," to which his wife replies "That is right." She speaks to the old woman, telling her to "put fire under the salmon" when the wife goes away. The wife then tells Real-Chief that she heard correctly what he had said. She then begins to whistle; the salmon that had been hung up also whistled. The wife and the salmon disappear, as does Real- Chiefs long hair. This narrative consists of three parts. The first contains the statement of the problem (Real- Chief has no salmon) and a possible solution, the second its temporary resolution, and the third a return to the initial state. Thus Real- Chief has Water of Life but no bones with which to create salmon. Next, he attempts to steal bones from Owner-of-Salmon, but fails because he is caught. Finally, he hits upon the correct solution: he finds the corpse of a twin and revives it with his Water of Life. Twins are reincarnations of salmon. This imparts two qualities to them. They are closely related to salmon - that is what they "really are" - and thus have control over the presence of salmon in fishing grounds. Like salmon, they have a supernatural power continually to regenerate through reincarnation (see below). In the context of the above discussion, twins and salmon are associated primarily with the body and bodily vitality, or Water of Life. Proper disposal of bones is in this sense the central issue of the first section of the myth. Water of Life combined with bones create the necessary and sufficient conditions for regeneration, which is Real-Chief's objective.</page><page sequence="16">102 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 The middle passage of the myth involves the proportional variation of four elements: bathing, hair, salmon, and desiccation. First the wife bathes a single finger, and a single salmon is caught. Then she bathes the head of Real-Chief, and his hair is "made long." She washes two fingers, and two salmon appear. Finally, she goes entirely into the water and is "just sitting in it," and the river becomes filled with salmon. Progressive bathing is reminiscent of the injunctions placed on the widow during the intermediate period: she may not bathe at all initially, and then only by increments. However, the relation of bathing to salmon is here reversed. If a widow were to bathe in fishing grounds, the fish would, propor- tionately, disappear rather than appear. Hence the widow is banned from fishing grounds for the duration of the intermediate period. The third term in this relationship is hair. Hair is an ambiguous symbol in this instance. While the grooming of hair is, like bathing, a taboo imposed on the widow during the intermediate period, and one that is lifted gradually, uncontrolled growth of hair is associated with the corpse and with the uncontrolled spirits of the baiqa. A fourth element is introduced at this stage: the drying and roasting of salmon. Again, this activity relates proportionately to the other elements. As more salmon are caught, more must be roasted or dried. This also is an ambiguous symbol. While salmon must be dried to be preserved and roasted to be eaten, an excess connotes death. Clearly, these activities involve the extraction of Water of Life. The dead are said to eat salmon that is black; salmon must be burnt or smoked over the fire in order to transport it, or anything else, to the land of the dead (Boas 1932:142; Olson 1949[3]:4). During the period of high taboo the widow eats extremely desiccated salmon, i.e. , salmon that is maxi- mally devoid of Water of Life. The middle section of this myth can be characterized as ambiguous and potentially dangerous. Four elements, two of which are ambiguous (hair and dessication) , and two pairs of which are potentially opposed (water and dessication, salmon and hair), are in- volved in a relationship of positive feedback or, to use Batesonfs term, "schismogenesis" (Bateson 1958:171-197). The final section is the climax or crisis of this unstable situation. It is marked by three events: the appearance of the old woman, Real-Chief catching his hair on the fish that had been hung up, and the cursing of his wife. His hair catches on the drying fish because both elements have increased beyond control. Real-Chief accuses his wife of pulling his hair, which she did in fact do earlier, thus creating the situation of uncontrolled growth of hair. In the Winter Ceremonial, pulling the hair connotes "posses- sion" in the sense of being taken away to the spirit world by a particular being. Thus in the Ghost Dance, a hamaca dancer grabbed the novice by the hair and musses it, and in the fnitha dance of the dhueldxa series the novice is pulled by the hair to the spirit world (Olson 1955:341, 1949 [6]: 31). The implication is that Real-Chiefs wife is attempting to take him with her to the land of the dead in an inversion of the initial Orphic mytheme. Further, recall that the close female kin of the deceased have some of their hair pulled out. At this point, an old woman appears. Juxtaposed with the desiccated salmon, she is strongly reminiscent of the widows attendant, who is old, female, and serves salmon. Real- Chiefs wife tells him to "put a fire under the salmon that has been hung up, when I go away" and then disappears. This refers to the practice of burning or smoking food for the dead, who can thereby enjoy it (see Boas 1932:142). She leaves with a whistle- the salmon also whistle - clearly to return to the land of the dead. Whistling signifies the onset of the calqa and is associated with spirit possession in the constituent dances, as well as with the departure of the body during the funeral feast. This myth clearly parallels the mortuary cycle but is, in a significant sense, an inver- sion of it. Thus, at the terminal stages, life is absent, while during the intermediate stage it is present. Likewise, the problem pre- sented by the myth is the reverse of that presented by death: how does one construct rather than deconstruct personhood? This, rather than the more general problem of creat- ing life, is the object. Real-Chief is seeking to create personhood and thus society. He possesses Water of Life but lacks bones. He achieves bodily vitality by the conjunction of Water of Life and the bones of the dead twin, who then becomes his wife and the potential genetrix of society. According to a common mythic model, this would occur; she would obtain ceremonial privileges and found a village (see below). The crest would remain as a commemoration of this transformation. How- ever, in this case the essential forces that enable society to exist are not properly articu- lated but are overwhelmed by uncontrolled bodily growth. The boundaries created by the mortuary process, that achieve articulation within a social framework, are absent in this primal, mythic world. Real-Chief fails not simply because of improper handling of the dead, but more fundamentally because of a failure to order the world in a cultural fashion. This failure is symbolized by the fact that his wife is never named, and thus lacks a persona and membership in society.</page><page sequence="17">Harkin: Heiltsuk Mortuary Practices 103 This narrative thus functions in part as a negative image of the intermediate period of the mortuary cycle, which is the locus of articulation in these elements. The myth describes the dangers inherent in the mor- tuary process, during which these elements are initially uncontrolled. It is, as well, a model for mourning, as it introduces the concept of bereavement. That is, the termi- nal stages are not identical because the first describes a state in which personhood simply does not exist, the second describes one in which potential personhood has been lost. Finally, it is possible that this myth can be taken as an "ernie" account of death and mourning. It is a commonplace of Heiltsuk and Kwakiutl thought that the land of the dead is reversed in every sense from that of the living, particularly with respect to ordinal and sequential series. Thus the period of dangerous lack of control in the myth coin- cides with the period of careful separation in the mortuary cycle. As the latter represents an articulation of the categories of society and personhood, so the former describes the essential identity of death as nonpersonhood. CONCLUSION: DEATH AND THE RIGHT HAND A further set of associations concerning vitality and the notion of the person can be developed with respect to HertzÂ» concept of person as a doubled entity, homo duplex (Hertz 1960:112). Hertz makes a simple distinction between the adroit right hand and the sinister left: the former representing sacred power, efficacy, and goodness; the latter, the "ambiguous conception of the profane and the impure," feebleness, danger, and dread (Hertz 1960:100). Perhaps more significant is the fundamental opposition between homo duplex as a completed person, in the sense elaborated above, and an incom- plete half-man, incapable of producing life and closely associated with exogenous, dangerous powers. A narrative collected by Olson tells of an autochthonous half-man named Qa'sana, with half a face, one arm, one leg, etc., who lives with four sons and no wife on one side of Cascade Inlet (Olson 1955:332, 1949 [6]: 7-8). The sons had had no mother. They live solely by hunting mountain goats. He wants wives for his sons and so carves four alder- wood figures, placing them on a cedar mat, but he cannot bring them to life. Each day the sons go hunting in the mountains. One day they find four young women seated where the figures had been; they are *"hai'-^ asdelux," "flying beings" (/hikastualuxv/ = those who fly high). However, they flee when the dogs come in the house. One day QaTsana tells the boys to tie the dogs up outside. He surprises the creatures, who immediately marry the sons. Qa'sana dances and sings a song that runs "one eye, one arm, one leg," etc. Qa'sana is removed from the source of life. Although he lives on one side of the inlet, he cannot fish for salmon but only hunts moun- tain goats. Like Real-Chief, he cannot animate the carvings. By contrast, Raven lives on the other side of the inlet, and is capable of transformation: he can transform objects into geographical features and is himself both a raven and a person. Indeed his name, Mini'galis, means "the only person there": implying that Qa'sana is precisely not a person. Qa'sana is close to the source of uncontrolled power. Mountain goat meat contrasts with salmon, as the latter is closely associated with life and regeneration, while the former is hunted in the early winter, when the caiqa is held, and is served at funeral feasts. The mountains are the source of caiqa. The Oowekeeno held that the spirit of the caiqa comes down from the mountains with the first snows (Olson 1949[4]:1). Qa' sana's state is objectified by his lack of a wife or daughters-in-law. He tries to remedy the problem in an appropriate way, analogous to Real-Chief's regeneration of salmon from bones, but he lacks the animating force to add to the lifeless structures. Flying creatures appear, which may be asso- ciated with the dhuelaxa or "heavenly" series. The spirits of the dhÃ¹elaxa invariably come from above, through the air. Finally, he succeeds, by employing a mode appropriate to his state: he captures them like game. Hunting as opposed to salmon fishing (i.e., the two basic modalities of obtaining food) is characterized by contingency and luck, and takes place outside the realm of socially- controlled space. Salmon fishing, on the other hand, is relatively predictable, and hence controllable, especially with regard to time and place. This distinction corresponds to the larger distinction between controlled and uncontrolled forms of power, as repre- sented in the dhuela&amp;a as opposed to the caiqa and in the final versus the intermediate stage of the mortuary process. Having gained wives for his sons, Qa'sana is able to turn his peculiarity into a cere- monial privilege. Two factors enable him to do so. First, the immediate fact of a mar- riage involves the transfer and display of ceremonial privileges. Second, like Raven, Qa'sana has accomplished a transformation by becoming a person. He is a person insofar as he becomes the founder of a village, the population of which is a conjunction of Qa'sana's body (they are somatically marked by having only one eye), the life force he has captured, and the persona inherent in</page><page sequence="18">104 Arctic Anthropology 27:1 the ceremonial privilege. Ceremonial privileges are commemorations of transforma- tions, their constituted aspect. If the myth of Qa'sana refers to the trans- formation of a half-man into a person with ceremonial privileges, other data throw light on the concept of one-sidedness. Thus, paralytics, who are thought to be paralyzed on one side, could visit the underworld at will and have visions similar to those of the widow during mourning (Olson 1949[3]:4). Among the Oowekeeno, the widow was washed for the first time after the death by atten- dants who rubbed pebbles on the right side of her body (Olson 1954:227). For the entire period of mourning the widow slept on the right side of her body and chewed only with the right side of her mouth (Olson 1954:227). Thus, one-sidedness is particularly associated with death and the power of and over death. As such, paralytics were associated with warfare: a Tlingit war helmet depicts a man paralyzed on the right side (Boas 1955:184). Further, among the Oowekeeno and elsewhere paralytics were commonly shamans. In addi- tion, the right side has connotations of vitality, the side of control, which must be stimulated and favored during the dangerous post-mortem period. However, neither side alone can be said to symbolize life, for it is only in the conjunction of the two that life is possible. The reverse of the image of the half-man is that of the doubled man, i.e., the twin. Twins are reincarnations of salmon; thus they are maximally associated with life. Paralytics can be cured by skin taken from the right side of a twin's body (Olson 1935[2]:9). Twins have the power to call salmon to fish- ing grounds, also to drive them away, as we saw above (Olson 1935[2]:10). However, twins do not live long, although they are assured of reincarnation (Olson 1949[4] :102). After the birth of twins, the parents and infants are isolated on an island, and a taboo on bathing is in effect for a certain period. If they violate it, stormy weather will appear (Olson 1949[4]:102). Mothers of twins have made for them special paddles with holes in the blade "so the salmon can pass through" (Olson 1935[5]:94). These proscriptions- isolation, avoidance of bathing, and avoidance of fishing grounds - are reminiscent of mor- tuary taboos. The term hikela is applied to both, suggesting that twins are dangerous in a fashion analogous to the dead. However, twins are closely associated with life and regeneration, rather than death and decay. The danger is that, like sorcerers and the dead, twins are beyond social control. Since they are half supernatural and thus only half human, women fear having them (Olson 1949 [4]: 102). Their power of vitality can be used to create dearth (of salmon) or an equally dangerous surfeit (of water), exactly as we saw in the previous myth. A model for socially controlled doubling (and thus vitality) can be found in marriage. The return of the brideprice, alone of all return payments, must be double the original amount (Olson 1935[5]:102). This return parallels the biological "doubling" of fertility that occurs as the result of the marriage. This is possibly related to the concept of the heaviness of the bride, who is said to be "heavy" with wealth, in promise of the return payment. This corporeal heaviness, not surprisingly, has cultural and linguistic associations with pregnancy as well. Marriage involves the transfer of privileges to the woman, who will pass them on to her children (Olson 1935[5]:102). As in the myth of Qa'sana, the necessary ingredients for the constitution of personhood, and thus of society, are brought together. In the mortuary process, the matrimonial state is the opposite of the liminality of bereavement. This opposition refers not merely to the condition of the individual ritual subjects, but to the state of the social unit as a whole. Marriage is the model for con- trolled power, through which the social unit is mythically established and through which it reproduces itself. Acknowledgements.
