<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIVIENNE ROCHE RIVERRUN GALLERY DUBLIN 27 September ? 17 October Vivienne Roche was born in Cork in 1953, and she was one of the artists whose for mal vocabulary and outlook were decisive ly shaped by the flowering of assembled and-painted-steel sculpture, a la Anthony Caro, under the aegis of John Burke, at the Crawford Municipal School of Art when she was a student there in the early 1970s. Eilis O'Connell, another sculpture student significantly influenced by Burke's institution of an important if short-lived tradition, moved on fairly quickly to preoc cupations rooted more in personal interests and international developments, including a long hard look at the so called 'new' in ternational sculpture with its leaning towards natural form and metaphorical abstraction, which has proved very impor tant for her continuing development. Roche, on the other hand, clearly a figure of considerable ability, seemed to hold firmly to the hard-edge ethos, to a belief in formalist abstraction. Her work was fundamentally architectonic, even drawing its inspiration from the clean lines and opaque, refective surfaces of moder nist office blocks. Perhaps, over the years, this adherence to the party line, so to speak, has militated against her general ac ceptance. In critical terms she looks com paratively hard-done-by given the con sistency and continuing high level of am bition of her output. In fact, her progress has not been as single-minded and exclusive as it might sound. Her glass and steel pieces always managed to call up substantial energies, and they developed to encompass devices of suspension and balance that explored areas of tension and mass: engineering as art, perhaps, in that emotionally it remain ed cool, detached, even remote. More recently, as her large Riverrun ex hibition, Northern Light, demonstrates, Roche's work has broadened im measurably in its range, admitting a whole new gamut of outside associations, and try ing to evolve a formal apparatus to deal with these associations. Most notable is her interest in sound, beginning (and continu ing, for that matter) with nautical and other bells. Pieces like Pendate which consists of a supporting framework and a suspend ed concave form, suggests not only the outward form but a sound of a bell: the flattened, concave shape is like a sheet of sound, that is, a concrete correlative of sound. The framework, however, is per haps overly elaborated. Its triangular base and top reiterate the acoustic theme, but they still comprise part of a heavy, intrus ive stand that seems disproportionately emphatic. Tellingly, it is the rigidity of the geo metrical design which gives a debilitating ly arbitrary feeling to the overall piece, a lession that Roche seems to have learned and, elsewhere, applied to useful effect. Northern Light is particularly noteworthy for the way it indicates her desire to in crease the flexibility and versatility of her formal grammar. It includes work from two series, Grave Goods and North Drawings, both of which have their inspiration in periods of time spent in Sweden in the last two years. They make explicit references to Norse mythology, as in Freya's Bell and Trior's Ring, and to sites in Sweden where sub stantial Viking remains were discovered. Thus the Vendel Pair are a pair of stirrups from Vendel and the Klint Staff is just that. There are, however, several successful pieces that apparently adhere to a purist idiom, expounded like illustrations of mathematical formulae. Kai Curve, Con structed Blue, and Arc Assured all utilise graceful curvilinear forms unfolding in space in accordance with ordered, if in stinctively derived, sequences of progres sion. Their elegance, and the way their forms are developed recall some aspects of Eilis O'Connell's burnished, undulating shapes, but O'Connell invariably incor porates resonant cultural references. Her shapes are human shapes in the way they relate to human implements or human characteristics. Roche's forms, in these works, have more of an air of exploring geometrical possibilty. Nevertheless, cultural and human references are certainly evident elsewhere. There is explicit imagery, as in Vendel Arc, in which an anthropomorphic fish emblem transfixes a sickle outline, a motif perhaps derived from a piece of Norse decoration, or in the case of the several bells, which come with anthromorphic trappings and are tied to mythic referents, to Freya, Norse goddess of love, for example, or to more general metaphors, like the organically shaped Earth Bell. It can be argued that there are specific elements of Roche's sensibility as manifest ed in her sculpture that are echoed and perhaps amplified in characteristic Norse qualities, in the rigours of a harsh northern climate, or Viking virtues, for example. Her work is tough and very definite. Though her forms are frequently ambiguous they are always forthright. Even Siden Stroke (Silk Stroke), though referring to a soft, flexible material, and though it apes the fall of fabric, presents a fixed metal skin, as do the leather fragments attached to the stir rups in Vendel Pair, or the venerable, weathered and distorted Birka Column. The wall mounted reliefs described as "drawings" further spell out a contradiction between form and substance. They seem to aspire to the casual flexibility of the drawn line, consisting of curvilinear motifs against given geometric grids, but they are fixed, unequivocally heavy objects. Fur thermore, they clearly accept their limita</page><page sequence="2">IHBPvJ Vivienne Roche, Drawing No.2, 1989, Steel, 162x 106 cms.</page><page sequence="3">36 tions, living happily within the contradic tions. Similar contradictions are apparent in the frequent references to sound, from Case Note by way of Earth Bell to Sistrum though the hardness and certainty of the sculptures could be said to point to clear, precise sounds, like the tolling of a perfectly cast bell. Northern Light is a substantial exhib tion. It is appropriately titled: a cold, rak ing light is exactly what seems to illuminate Roche's crisply delineated forms. While there is a clear continuity to the work the show nevertheless reads more as a near miscellaneous collection of pieces than as a concerted statement. It looks transitional. The "drawings" particularly, seem to be leading off into some distinct, new direc tion, while the bells head inexorably to wards the sound they promise. Aidan Dunne</page></plain_text>
