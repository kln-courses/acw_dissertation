<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hudson D. Walker MARSDEN HARTLEY M^t ARSDEN Hartley, nearly four years after his death, is a controversial figure in the development of American paint- ing. Estimates vary between the contention that he did not know how to paint, and the assertion that he approached Winslow Homer in originality and power. These diverse opinions have been expressed by two museum directors, equally respected in the field of contemporary American art. I had the privilege of knowing Hartley well the last six years of his life, and during the past ten years have seen the bulk of drawings, lithographs, pastels and paintings which he produced. No doubt remains in my mind that Hartley was a great American painter. Alfred Stieglitz gave Hartley his first one-man exhibition at "291" (Fifth Avenue) in 1909, when the artist was 31. He ex- hibited a series of Maine landscapes, depicting hillsides at various seasons of the year. Although he had studied in the Chase School, the influences evident in his earliest work are Segantini and Twachtman. These solidly painted studies are of themes to which the artist returned in later years. They are handled with sensitivity, and the brushwork is already distinguished. The combinations of reds, blues, whites and greens, while similar to his use of them in his late work, do not have the same logical arrangement, and the intent is often blurred by hasty manipulation of the medium. Autumn effects, snow scenes and sunlight in summertime are handled broadly, without undue detail, but they do not achieve the monumental design which was intended. In color they range from high-keyed autumn and summer compositions, to low-value hill- sides at dusk, foreshadowing the artist's consistent practice of</page><page sequence="2">HUDSON D. WALKER 249 producing in the same season subjects in full chrome, followed by studies in near monochrome. This practice undoubtedly contri- buted to the impression that Hartley was inconsistent, for which he was criticized throughout his life. Only now the pattern which governed his experimentations can be seen with clarity. Hartley never considered himself a "professional" painter, meaning by this, one who learned his technique and then poured it consistently into subject moulds. Instead he chose to extend his kno,wledge of his craft by any means which presented itself, in whatever part of the world he was working. He responded alike to the work of other artists which could provide nourishment and to his human and natural environment. He was an eclectic paint- er, mirroring the restlessness of his times, on a constant search for varied experience. The word "eclectic" has taken on a con- notation of weak imitation, but in view of the development of the international character of 20th Century painting, should be re- defined more correctly as intelligent selection from various sources. I emphasize this in considering his early work, because his love of Nature compelled him to find the best mode of treating it. This underlying motivation was the tap root of his artistic being. Deviations ended, he always returned to the main path with re- newed vigor and knowledge. Shortly after his first exhibition, the work of Albert Ryder struck him with all the force of a revelation. Intentionally, know- ing what he wanted, and shamelessly, he proceeded to paint a few pictures-the "black" landscapes-"as close to Ryder as he could," which is how he described them to me years later. I write with one of them before me, called "Deserted Farm." In the foreground are large gray rocks from which grow rhythmic, twisted tree trunks. Beyond in the valley is the farmhouse and its tumbled barn. A dark mountain rises up nearly to the top of the canvas, its gulleys running down into the deep valley. The sky is subdued and the cloud patterns are like Ryder's, though less angular. It is a dark picture, moody, but with none of the fortifying highlights in land-</page><page sequence="3">250 KENYON REVIEW scape or sky he later achieved. It shows progress in handling the medium. The pattern is stronger than in the earlier hillsides, but there is a deadness in the sky, a lack of volume in the rocks. This immersion in Ryder's spirit greatly strengthened the course of Hartley's development. After working in entirely different man- ners, he returned again and again to this sombre mood. In 1912 Hartley made his first trip to Paris. His first painting there, a large still life with red peppers and bananas, is reminis- cent of the Maine hillsides in the way he painted the patterned textile in the background, but the color is much stronger, the treat- ment approaching the abstract. This was followed by a handsome series of still lifes, many of pears done in low values, with areas of low-value russets and yellows for color interest. Most of them are painted against solid black backgrounds, giving more monu- mentality to the compositions than he had previously achieved. Some, however, are marred by careless ways of handling, such as brushmarks in the paint surface which add nothing to the drawing or definition of forms. A large abstract composition of pears, which still belongs to the artist's estate, is probably the latest in the series, and strongly suggests the next phase of his work in Berlin. Hartley was invariably motivated by significant content in addition to purely artistic experimentation. Therefore, when he arrived in Berlin during 1914 and the war spirit was everywhere evident, he did a great many abstracted paintings which well ex- press this war fever. Most of them are large compositions in which he used military insignia, symbolic figures of mounted Prussian officers and the black cross to express the chromatic nervous tension. The high point in this series is the well known "Portrait of an Officer," in which he achieves a vigorous com- position by the juxtaposition of the attributes of his Prussian officer friend. At this time, on the invitation of Frans Marc, he exhibited with the German experimentalists, along with Feininger, whom he knew well, thus being one of the few Americans who</page><page sequence="4">Marsden Hartley, by Jacques Lipchitz.

WALKER 253 were intimately, though briefly, allied to and influenced by this movement. With the exception of a few compositions based on music - such as the "Bach Prelude et Fugue"-I feel that Hart- ley's personal touch is revealed in his objective approach to ab- straction, and in the sensuous handling of pigment. He reserved purely poetic expression for his poems - and in this he is unlike Kandinsky, whose work these Berlin abstractions resemble. These fevered impressions again indicate Hartley's sensitiveness to his surroundings, because on his return to America he did not con- tinue the same color experiments, but launched forth in a mood more consistent with the cool New England atmosphere of Pro- vincetown. The series painted in Provincetown in 1916 carries on the ab- stract approach of the Berlin pictures, with a very different palette. Again he abstracted the attributes of the place - sails, pennants, flowers and still life and the New England houses. He did not retire from nature to create symbols personal to himself. His colors are cool, his values are low, and the whole tempo reduced to a New England quiet. Whereas in Berlin much of the ex- pressiveness in his work depended on the juxtaposition of circles, angles and jagged lines, these Provincetown compositions play angles on angles, the effect depending on right shapes and subtle color variations. Perhaps the high point of the series is "Province- town Houses," in the Stieglitz collection. It has warmth and is treated with more impasto than the others. I wish to emphasize the significance of Hartley's change of pace between Berlin and Cape Cod. A weaker creator would undoubtedly have returned and continued the Berlin technique for the shock value, merely pouring that technique into the new subject matter forms. About 1918 Hartley settled in New Mexico, and from his brush came light-keyed landscapes and still lifes employing in- digenous church effigies. The "El Santo," now in the Museum of New Mexico, Santa Fe, and others in the Stieglitz collection, are treated with reverence, employing strong color and a semi-</page><page sequence="7">254 KENYON REVIEW realistic approach. The landscapes of this period, such as "Cash Entry Mines," are high in key, warm in color and catch the dazzl- ing light of that locale by the repetitive use of flowing forms. Many of the arbitrary cloud forms suggest Ryder, but there is nothing else of his mood in the production of this period. Hartley also worked in pastels at this time, to very good advantage. The medium emphasized the softness of form in the dry mountain ranges of New Mexico. On the whole his work at this period is slightly too decorative to rank with his finest. In 1922 Hartley returned to Berlin. He found everything changed by the war, many of his friends dead, and none of the electric spirit of the war years. He painted memory landscapes of the Southwest that are very dark; black, grey and green. The rocks and trees often take on anthropomorphic semblances, and the pictures are stylized, rather than realized, expressions. From these he worked into abstracted still lifes which are richly pigmented, clean and clear in design and color. He also did an unusual series of pastel nudes. Forms are exaggerated and the colors arbitrary, but they are powerful. The only previous figures which survive are a series of drawings from 1908, and a few Ryderesque com- positions done about 1909. The figure compositions for which he is now known were not started until fifteen years later, but these Berlin pastels are the prototypes. The landscapes done at Vence in the Alpes Maritimes and later at Aix-en-Provence between 1924 and 1929 are little known but extremely fine. Working under Cezanne's influence, and in- spired by Cezanne's country, Hartley was much more successful than in the Southwest landscapes done from memory in Berlin. He responded to the country. His paintings of Mont St. Victoire are the closest he came to being completely under Ce6zanne's spell, though in his stubborn, abrupt forms, he kept the necessary indi- viduality to make the work his own. The degree to which some would like the work of this period as Hartley's, and others dislike it because of the obvious source, is a matter for individual taste.</page><page sequence="8">HU DSON D. WALKER 255 If his work ended here, had he died in 1929, there is little doubt he would have to be considered only as an experimentalist. In this period he also painted many decorative still lifes, of merit, but often hastily done, and not individual enough to have established a personal idiom. What now validates these expressions is his final achievement of integrating his varied styles in his last period. Beginning in 1930 when he did such landscapes as the Whitney Museum's "Kinsman Falls," Marsden Hartley came down the home stretch to his final fulfilment. In New Hampshire he painted a group of dignified summer and autumn landscapes which echo the Mont St. Victoire canvases mentioned above. The earliest of these still strongly suggest Cezanne, but again the local spirit prevailed, and the work gained in personal expression as he got deeper into his subject matter. "Beaver Lake," which was shown at the Carnegie International in 1930, is completely simpli- fied, the brush work integral with the drawings, and the blues, greens, and greys held to narrow and subtle modulations. This is a lush, gray country, which could produce only monotonous paintings if the artist had not such a command of personal ex- pression. When Fall returned he painted brilliant autumn foliage against the green pines, with such strength of design and mastery of the palette as only comes through the complete integration of emotion and technique. These were followed by a striking group of paintings done in Dogtown Common on Cape Ann - a wild region which for him evoked the spirit of the Druids. While some of the forms may be disturbing because of their anthropomorphic character, these are clean-cut, powerfully designed, personal and original expressions. Until his death in 1943, only one painting experience pro- duced inferior work. These are the paintings he did in Mexico on a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1932 and 1933. He was not well, and with certain notable exceptions, such as the "Fish" and the Hart Crane memorial canvas "Eight Bells Folly," beat up an esoteric side-current more literary than plastic, doing symbolic works with</page><page sequence="9">256 KENYON REVIEW such titles as "The Cascade of Devotion, or The Blood of the Dreamers." He left Mexico and returned to Germany, settling at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Austrian Tyrol. There he pro- duced remarkable canvases of the Alps, many in monochrome which suggest Oriental scrolls. These are all starkly simplified, richly painted and powerful. A trip to Bermuda produced lighthearted fantasies in still lifes of fish and other sea creatures, gay in color, skilful in handling, but leaving one unprepared for the great power unleashed in the final phase. Going North from Bermuda in 1935, Hartley visited Dogtown Common for the third time, and hit that wild scenery with all the painting force at his command. His other work there definitely seems a preparation for this series of chunky rock walls, set in greenery of the utmost intensity. The rocks, trees and fence posts are outlined in black and there is the greatest unity in taut composition and powerful brushwork. Not easily understood at first, they gain tremendously on further study. The "Old Bars Dogtown" in the Whitney Museum is one of the best of these. All previous influences are now annealed into a vehicle of personal expression seldom seen in American painting. His failing health seemed only to spur Hartley on, for besides a great deal of writing in verse and prose, a good two hundred canvases, and scores of drawings in addition, flowed from his hand during his last eight years. Haunted by the fear of financial insecurity in his old age, (he had an assured income of only $25 a month), and in spite of a minimum of sales until the last three years of his life, he produced work in this period which must go down as monumental and American. The old love of place asserted itself. He had "come home," and this emotion fused the old manners of painting, even sublimating the love of place into a universal expression. I have mentioned previously "series" of paintings by Hartley. The greatest resulted from a tragedy in the family with whom he was staying in Nova Scotia. The two brothers were drowned at</page><page sequence="10">HUDSON D. WALKER 257 sea. Hartley felt this tragedy most poignantly, immediately painted the strong and poetic "Northern Seascape" as a memorial. The Ryder influence returns suddenly in this canvas, integrated with the special emotion of the tragedy. Rocks on the shoreline resemble an angry row of huge teeth. The white waves dashing on them are like froth on a mad beast's fangs. Two fishing vessels under angular, light-rimmed clouds complete the external inven- tory of this work, but the emotion runs as true and deep as water runs from the surface to the bottom of the sea. Other small can- vases repeat a similar theme, each gem-like in subdued color and rich pigment. In the same year, probably before the boys drowned, he painted the attributes of the sea - as he had painted the attributes of the officer in Berlin - sea shells, starfish, ducks, rope, lobster, buoys, and fish nets. Two years elapsed before he continued the memorial series, which I will describe below, after mentioning some great paintings which intervened. "Fox Island, Georgetown, Maine," painted in 1937-38, now belonging to the Addison Gallery, recreates the rocky coast of Maine, with all the small islands offshore, as no one who didn't love the scene, and no one who hadn't complete mastery of painting, could do. Of like quality is the rich autumn scene "Smelt Brook Falls," in the City Art Museum of St. Louis. Painted the same year, still lifes of garden implements, men's gloves and ladies', are comparable to Courbet in trenchant ex- pression. People have thought his personalized titles for some of these paintings are affected - closer to poetry than need be - but I am convinced part of the splendid plastic qualities of "Flowers from Lachaise's Garden" spring from his desire to memorialize his friend, who had recently died. He had promised the fisher family in Nova Scotia never to use their true names when writing or painting about Nova Scotia. Therefore, when he turned to painting memorial figures of this family, he adopted pseudonyms of great beauty. The father, "Cleophas, Master of the Gilda Grey," is painted over life size,</page><page sequence="11">258 KENYON REVIEW with a brilliant red jacket, mahogany face, deeply lined. One son, "Adelard, the Drowned, Master of the Phantom," is less compro- mising in treatment, his black hair symbolically standing straight up, a flower over his right ear, hands folded at the waist, jacket open and a pipe stuck in his pocket. The sister, "Marie St. Esprit," is dressed in a black dress, over which is her white apron, hands folded at the wrists, and depicted half-length as are the other two. In this remarkably cool painting Hartley's veneration for the Fayum encaustic portraits is most evident. She is seated full face, staring straight ahead, with the suggestion of a tear on the cheek. "Nova Scotia Fishermen," which he sent to the Whit- ney Annual, was his first figure painting to be shown anywhere. Here the two brothers are shown at their fisherman's chore, in the light snow fall, with lowering blue-gray clouds over the ocean. Bright red fish are scattered on the wharf, sparsely, and the nets are contrived like writhing figures. There is an archaic, poetic feeling in this composition very akin to his "Fisherman's Last Supper," whch shows the whole family seated at table. He did two versions of this theme, and intended doing a large mural, but the commission never came, and death intervened. Another important one of this series is "The Lost Felice," showing the two brothers, dressed in their oil skins, behind the tragic figure of their sister. She is dressed in white, which stands out against the blue of the boys' oil skins, and the red of their faces and hands. It is a very strongly patterned and moving interpretation of the tragedy. "The Gardener's Gloves and Implements," painted in 1937-38, appears to be the first of these late paintings to seek a new naturalism. This painting led to other still lifes, particularly of birds like "The Black Duck" in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which are rendered with great fidelity to nature, although still keeping a simplified design. One of the last still lifes he did was of a dead plover, which he called one of his triumphs in mono- chrome. At the same time, a new naturalism in landscape is</page><page sequence="12">HU DSON D. WALKER 259 evident in the development of the great series of paintings he did of Mt. Katahdin, the highest mountain in Maine. The earliest of this series is the "Mt. Katahdin Autumn Number One" which again combines strength of design, daring color, and a moving phenomenon of nature to achieve a new high in American land- scape painting. He did others of Mt. Katahdin in the winter and continued using this theme for three years after his trip to see the mountain. The last of these are less startling in color and achieve great depth and atmosphere. The same tendency is to be noted in this development of Maine coastal seascapes. The atmospheric quality of "Evening Storm, Schoodick, Maine" is quite different from the "Fox Island" mentioned above, and signifies the artist's complete return to naturalism. The abstract qualities of design are present, but this is not an abstract picture. The colors are pure, but they are not strident. Hartley came to the logical conclusion of his life of experiment when he returned to his native Maine and painted its landscapes and its attributes with a knowledge which could have been obtained in no other way than by living the life of an experimental artist.' 1.
