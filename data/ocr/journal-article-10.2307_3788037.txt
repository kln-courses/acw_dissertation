<plain_text><page sequence="1">Odessa: A History, 1794-1914. By Patricia Herlihy (Cambridge, Mass: Distributed by Harvard University Press for the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 1986. xvii plus 422 pp.). If a tree fell in pre-revolutionary Odessa and Professor Herlihy did not learn about it, did it make a sound? I doubt it. There seems to be little about the city that the author does not know. The imaginative reader of this book has to stand in awe of the long years of meticulous research that must have preceded its writing. The work is a compendium of information - some important, some unfortunately less so - drawn from a multitude of sources, including foreign consular reports and local Odessa archives. Those seeking to know the names and characteristics ofthe kinds of wheat shipped through Odessa, the length of the top and bottom steps ofthe famous Potemkin staircase, or the condition ofthe first governor-general's eyesight will find their searches rewarded. Those, however, seeking a strongly argued, well-organized, highly-analytical work that maintains a consistent com? parative perspective will be disappointed.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 839 The book is less a case-study in urban social history than a biography ofa city; Odessa is not so much subject as protagonist. This perspective results in frequent anthropomorphic personification of the city, a tendency to evaluate events and people according to their contributions to Odessa's fortunes, and occasional lapses into sentimentality over the good times gone by. More problematically, the book tries to treat almost every aspect of the city's development, and is only marginally concerned with historical or analytical issues beyond the city's boundaries. The first weakness contributes to problems of argument and organi? zation, the second diminishes its utility to the non-specialist. The book attempts to cover the municipal politics, agricultural and industrial economics, foreign trade, demographics, social structure, and special character? istics ofthe city for 120 years. It is probably this effort at histoire totale that accounts for the difficulties with the argument and the organization. The encyclopedic nature of the author's concerns precludes any overarching thesis save the most general, as evidenced by the absence of an introduction and the threadbare conclusions. These latter muster a bare 475 words and boil down to three propositions: Odessa grew rapidly when the international grain market was favorable, faded as Russia lost out to more competitive producers, and was marked by significant and occasionally violent ethnic diversity. Certain ofthe component parts also advance subsidiary arguments or themes. Thus, we are told that Odessa's successful development depended on continued imperial sponsorship, that its industrial growth was impeded by inherent inade- quacies of water and fuel, and that the fundamental bottleneck in its foreign trade was in the transportation network with its hinterland. The force of these observations, however, is substantially weakened by the casualness of their presentation. They are seldom advanced as theses, linked explicitly to evidence, or argued consistently throughout the book. Rather, they emerge intermittently from the separate thickets of descriptive detail from which the work is fashioned. The points are reiterated from time to time, they seldom connect or build. This weakness links the problems of argument with those of organization. The book as a whole is neither strictly chronological nor strictly thematic, but is rather a confusing hybrid. Roughly speaking, the study covers each of its major areas of interest from 1794 to 1861 in the first half, then returns and covers them again from 1861 to 1914 on the second. However, the years 1803-1814 receive separate treatment, the chapter on municipal finance and government extends across the entire 19th century, and the topics in the first half do not always match those in the second. Within each chapter, the author's difficulties in marshalling the wealth of data increase. Information is lumped together arbitrarily, almost as if each section, sometimes each paragraph, had been conceived and written independently. Thus, a discussion of marketing and middlemen follows immedi? ately after an excursus on Odessa and the emancipation, the Crimean War is sandwiched between public participation in government and the sources of Odessa's revenues, and the India mutiny makes a gratuitous appearance in the middle of a description of Odessa's export industries. The effect produced on the reader by this amalgam is annoying in the extreme. Ultimately, one has to share the author's enthusiasm for Odessa in order to appreciate this book. This fact confronts the Russian historian who would like to</page><page sequence="3">840 journal of social history integrate Odessa's experience with that of the rest of the Empire. When the author attempts to address larger historiographical issues, such as the motivations for Catherine's reforms or the causes and consequences ofthe emancipation ofthe Russian serfs, these treatments are brief, uninformed, and inadequate. Nowhere is this clearer than in the last chapter on the revolutionary events of 1904-14, which is episodic, unanalytical, and confuses basic categories such as liberal and radical. It is probably non-specialists, however, who suffer the most. As they are led on a tour of downtown Odessa's fashionable cafes, or treated to brief biographies of as many governors-general, temporary governors-general, city chiefs, and mayors as the author could find information about, historians of other times and places might well ask: why should I care? One legitimate answer to this question would be implicitly comparative. Odessa's experience is important either because it is typical ofa general class of phenomena or because it is atypical - an exception which proves a rule. The author addresses such concerns only sporadically. We hear something about the 19th century being an age of frontiers, of which the Odessa area was one, but that idea is never developed. Odessa's growth is described as extremely rapid, but the comparative growth rates for other cities are never given. And an attempt to distinguish between the "traditional" and the "modern city" never gets far beyond the author's "first and most salient" characteristic - "sheer size." In general, as well as in the specific treatments of demography, epidemiology, and the geography of the city, the non-specialist seeking points for comparison will be frustrated by the fact that the author's concerns are much more descriptive than analytical. This is a book that simultaneously attempts too little and too much. In failing to integrate Odessa's experience either into the larger context of Russian history or the analytical concerns of urban historians, the work limits its contribution and its audience. And in reaching for histoire totak without the esprit de systeme that informs the best work of this genre, the author has buried the core of significance under a disorganized mass of detail.
