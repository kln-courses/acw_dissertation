<plain_text><page sequence="1">TUCH AS A SYMBOL FOR ART IN STIFTER'S "DER HOCHWALD" Christine Oertel Sj?gren, Oregon State University The descriptions of nature in Adalbert Stifter's "Der Hochwald" have attracted attention ever since the story was first published.1 While some interpreters consider the story to be a diatribe against "the dissonance and unnatural savagery" of the civilized human world, which is destruc tive to the peace and harmony of the majestic primeval forest,2 and others see in the plot an admonition against the inevitable flaw of ego tism inherent in sexual love, which therefore impairs the purity of the human heart,3 the general opinion is that the most significant character istic of the story is the extensiveness of its symbolism. In 1948, Robert Ulsh?fer summed up this distinction in terms that are still valid: "Der 'Hochwald' ist in seiner scheinbaren Anspruchslosigkeit ein vollendetes Kunstwerk, eine 'symbolische Dichtung' hoher Ordnung: Symbolisch ist die Form, von starker Symbolkraft die Sprache, und symbolisch sind die einzelnen Gestalten, Ereignisse, Bilder und Gleichnisse, ohne da? sie dadurch ihre Besonderheit und Einmaligkeit einb??en."4 The high metaphoric content of the nature description in "Der Hochwald" has been recognized, and the more obvious symbols have been pointed out, but some less noticeable images remain to be explored in this richly symbolic landscape. Several scholars have contributed to a better understanding of the work by investigating particular symbols within it: Herbert Seidler notes that the basic situation itself images the wide discrepancy between the insignificance of man in the foreground and the grandeur of the 1 See, for example, the earliest domestic and foreign reviews of this work, as given in Moriz Enzinger, Adalbert Stifter im Urteil seiner Zeit (Wien, 1968), p. 33: J.

In Heinrich Mettler's words: "Der pl?tzliche Einbruch in 'die Ruhe und Sicherheit' des Waldes ist grauenhaft. Die ganze Ordnung der Natur scheint dies nicht zulassen zu k?nnen."9 Ulsh?fer observes that the main symbols are two bodies of water mentioned in the first pages: Waldsee and Moldau, indicating "zwei verschiedene Wesensz?ge der Natur und zwei Stimmungsbereiche" and establishing dualism as the main theme of the work. This dualism ("Doppelgesichtigkeit des Daseins")10 is seen eventually to resolve itself and be reconciled as "Polarit?t und Einheit als Idee und zugleich als Formgesetz der Dichtung."11 Hans Dietrich Irmscher regards the forest realm as an image of man's original innocence and Ronald's intrusion into this sanctuary a blasphemy.12 The author himself calls the lake within the forest "Herzschlag des Waldes."13 The black forest lake, looked upon by Walter Muschg as a death symbol,14 is brought deeper into the realm of mythology by Christine Wolbrandt, who sees it as "dunkles ruhendes Wasser, das wohl am urspr?nglichsten empfundene Todessymbol der Menschen."15 The en virons of the lake also 'provide symbolism associated with "Wasser, Steine, K?hle, Stille, Reinheit, ewige Dauer, Tod, Narzi?."16 Roy Pascal has recently given a close textual analysis of the descrip 5 Herbert Seidler, "Die Natur in der Dichtung Stifters," ASILO 17 ( 1968), 231. 6 Konrad Steffen, Adalbert Stifter: Deutungen (Basel und Stuttgart, 1955), p. 70, "Die Ruine mit dem gro?en Schuttkegel am Eingang der Novelle und die rauch geschw?rzte des letzten Kapitels . . . sind eindr?ckliche Bilder von der zerst?renden Macht der Zeit." 7 Urban Roedl, Adalbert Stifter (Bern, 1958), p. 140. 8 Blackall, p. 117. 9 Heinrich Mettler, "Der Hochwald" (pp. 101-21), in Natur in Stifters fr?hen Studien: Zu Stifters gegenst?ndlichem Stil (Z?rich, 1968), p. 118. 10 Ulsh?fer, p. 78. 11 Ulsh?fer, p. 81. 12 Irmscher, p. 229. 13 Adalbert Stifter, "Der Hochwald," Studien, ed.

Listing various images present, Pascal notes the metaphors for Tuch used here to describe objects in the landscape and he suggests that these "Tuchmetaphern" belong to the sphere "des intim Bekannten, H?us lichen," introduced here to balance and tame the terror of the death imagery otherwise prevailing in the passage.17 While not demonstrably false, this interpretation of the cloth imagery does not seem fully satisfying. Even if all the cloth images in the passage?Tuch, Samt, Fichtenband, Streifen gr?nen Mooses?had been employed to bring the comfort of domesticity into this otherwise power ful evocation of bleakness and disorder, one would have to judge the imagery sentimental and ineffectual, for the elemental reality of death cannot be tamed by a touch of the domestic. Indeed, Pascal himself is irritated by the second occurrence of Tuch in the passage, a repetition that he interprets as a "Stilbruch." Another possibility is to accept the repetition as the author's device to call attention to the image. If the second (or the first) use of the image Tuch is deliberate and not a stylistic error, then perhaps our puzzled irritation at the incongruity of cloth in these surroundings is a clue to look beyond domesticity for larger implications. To ascertain the possible import of the image, one must examine the concept Tuch itself and then relate its meanings to the story as a whole. In the process, we shall find that the image Tuch is as important a symbol as the Waldsee itself, upon which it has been superimposed by the author in the startling description of the water: "ein gespanntes Tuch ohne eine einzige Falte" (p. 195). The following discussion will show that Tuch is not a peripheral domestic image, but a general and central metaphor conveying one of the main ideas from which the story was generated. The most useful function of cloth is to cover something, thereby protecting and concealing what is underneath, and at the same time perhaps enhancing and beautifying the covered object or even revealing something of its essential quality. Beyond that, a Tuch can also be readily associated with the idea of creativity, for a piece of cloth is a product of man's creative effort, through the processes of spinning and weaving threads. Fabric also lends itself to creative manipulation, in that it may be cut, sewed, embroidered, and fashioned into a garment which, in a new form, fulfills functions similar to Tuch: to cover, conceal, protect, beautify, and reveal inner qualities of what is underneath. 17 See page 64, of Roy Pascal, "Die Landschaftsschilderung im 'Hochwald/ " Adalbert Stifter: Studien und Interpretationen, ed. Lothar Stiehm (Heidelberg, 1968), pp. 57-68.</page><page sequence="4">378 Sj?gren While in "Der Hochwald" the idea of a cloth is used several times directly, there also are many allusions to the diverse attributes and func tions embodied in the concept Tuch. Numerous coverings and envelop ments that serve the uses ascribed above to cloth appear in the landscape as well as in the home interiors. Even the plot, concerned with the at tempt to conceal and protect some precious human beings, relates to the Tuch-image. The story tells of two young girls, the daughters of Heinrich von Wittinghausen, who are required to flee from their home, which is being threatened by the invading Swedish army at the time of the Thirty Years' War. They seek sanctuary in a remote forest area, where a tem porary home has been prepared for them, "sch?n . . . still . . . abge schlossen und unzug?nglich" (p. 209). In an idyllic secluded oasis ,where nature is yet in a state of pristine innocence, the refugees find shelter from the outside world. The author emphasizes the various aspects of the asylum which is to keep the girls safe: The isolation of this spot, "so einsam, so abseits alles menschlichen Verkehrs, da? kein Pfad, kein Fu?tritt, keine Spur davon ersp?hlich ist," is itself a shield ("ihr gr??ter Schutz sei ihre Einsamkeit"?p. 233); fog enveloping large areas of woods in the sur roundings helps to conceal them, forbidding cliffs and a vast lake constitute natural barriers; there is even a cave available for an emer gency, When an intruder eventually does appear, further means are taken to bar access to the girls: locks are added to the gates, boards of the fencing are made more secure, the girls are watched over more carefully by their guardian Gregor. But the extreme precautions do not permanently safeguard the girls from involvement v/ith hostile forces. A gunshot which kills a bird of prey soaring over the lake announces the presence of the Swedish prince, Clarissa's former lover, and breaks the enchantment of the idyll. The passion that had invaded Clarissa's childhood and robbed her of her innocence again overwhelms her. She succumbs to Ronald's ardent entreaties and enters into a hasty and irregular marriage ceremony, with little concern for her obligations to her family. Later when Ronald seeks to negotiate peace with Heinrich von Wittinghausen, the latter misin terprets the purpose of Ronald's approach, and attacks him in a rage. The ensuing bloody battle between the Swedish force and the Witting hausen defenses brings about the devastation of the castle, the death of the prince, and Wittinghausen's own death, along with that of his son. The two girls never marry, but spend the rest of their life together, bereft, in the ruins of their castle. Fundamental to the situation presented is the thesis that fragile human life must be protected and concealed from destructive powers,</page><page sequence="5">Tuch as Symbol in Stifter s "Der Hochwald" 379 here exemplified by the war. The basic theme of protection and conceal ment is reinforced by the symbolism, which deals with various means of safeguarding tender forms of life. In the realm of nature and in the human world, objects are shown enveloped and enfolded, encapsulated and immured?that is, provided with a cover of some sort.18 Just as Gregor lines the walls of the house with a "Winterkleid" of moss, so nature prepares for winter's cold: moss covers the branches of the trees; under the "H?lle" of grasses, seeds of forest plants hide; an armor ("Panzer") encapsules the buds; the fir trees are swathed in "M?ntel," the oak trees hang on tightly to their garment of foliage. Delicate human faces, appearing "aus dem wallenden wei?en Schleier des Kopfschmuckes" (p. 218), are protected by the enveloping veil. After Clarissa hears of Ronald's death, she wears a veil of mourning, which enfolds her vulnerable, pale face like a precious gem: "Ein Antlitz, wei? wie Alabaster, sah aus der schwarzen Florh?lle" ( p. 292 ). Tears form a veil that covers the eyes, preventing the full exposure of human grief: "Schleier ?berzog ihr Auge" (p. 269); "Tr?nen umflorten seinen Blick" (p. 276). Clothing provides physical protection, of course, but it can also serve as a shield for emotions, as is shown when Clarissa wears her most regal garments to spare her from the advances of the prince. He senses the effect of "etwas Fremdes und Abweisendes" (p. 262 ) in her splendid dress and is temporarily intimidated. As the most vulnerable part of a human being, the heart must be kept from injury. A cloth image does not suffice as metaphoric protection for this most tender entity; the heart requires "eine eherne Mauer" which can be supplied only by faith and love. Clarissa and Johanna assure each other mutual protection by their kisses; this sign of love comforts their hearts and mitigates their fright over the "drohenden Wirrsal" (p. 231) outside. As a rock in nature lies on its "Schwesterstein" (p. 225), or as "zwei Tauben"19 enfolding each other, the sisters lie together in close embrace, wishing to bury their hearts in each other and hide them from the threatening world: "Herz an Herz verbergend, ja fast vergrabend ineinander" (p. 231). Besides giving protection, the coverings in this story can also enhance 18Irmscher (p. 199) indicates that Goethe, in Bildung und Umbildung orga nischer Naturen (1807), already notes that the "H?lle," as a protective cover, is essential to all tender forms of life: "Diese H?lle mag nun als Rinde, Haut oder Schale erscheinen; alles was zum Leben hervortreten, alles was lebendig wirken soll, mu? eingeh?llt sein." Irmscher regards even the Waldhaus and the Waldsee as examples of fragile and precious life-forms, which must be shielded from the profane world by a H?lle, provided by the surroundings. 19 The dove, symbol of tender, innocent life, appears again in connection with Johanna, whose small soft hand seeks the "H?lle" of Gregor's fingers, like a dove nestling in the shelter of rocks: "wie eine Taube in die Felsen seiner Finger" (p. 221).</page><page sequence="6">380 Sj?gren and beautify. For example, dresses may be worn simply for beauty, as Clarissa and Johanna illustrate when they put on their finest clothes just to admire themselves. Landscapes too acquire overlays that function mainly for adornment. The ground in the woods is covered with needles "von dem schwarzen Samte" (p. 195), suggesting sensuous beauty; grass makes a luxurious carpet: "ein reines Tuch . . . ein Teppich, weich genug selbst f?r den Fu? einer K?nigstochter" (p. 215); "zarte Streifen gr?nen Mooses" (p. 195) soften the stern effect of the grey cliff wall; the granite gains color and charm "mit einem gr?nen Tuche des feinsten Mooses ?berh?llet" (p. 195). Shrubs glow with a cover of berries ("mit fremden gl?hend roten Beeren ?bersch?ttet" (p. 218), and raspberry bushes are brilliantly decorated, "als h?tte man ein rotes Tuch ?ber sie gebreitet" (p. 227). Elegant cloth imagery is used for the frosty winter forest, "zart wie Spitzengewebe" (p. 283), "ein durchbrochner Eispallast" (pp. 282 f. ). On another occasion the forest is dressed with a white garment of frost ("in lauter wei?en Funken brennend und glitzernd"?p. 284), as if all the stars in the night sky had drifted down upon it. The revelation of personality through clothing, a frequent device of the author, is used in the description of the characters. Johanna's dress, for example, shows her to be neat, energetic, purposeful, and unaffected ?a personality in accord with the order of her environment: "Alles ist nett. ?rmel und Mieder schlie?en reinlich, jede Falte der Schleppe liegt bewu?tvoll, jede Schleife sitzt wohlberechtigt, und jede Puffe gilt" (p. 199). Clarissa's first appearance suggests languor, delicacy, and luxury. Not yet dressed, she reclines on her "Ruhebett" in a nightgown with an abundance of snowy white folds ( "den faltenreichen Schnee des Nacht gewandes"?p. 200). Her nature, extreme both in its passionate and its angelic quality, is indicated in the contrast of her absolutely black hair cascading down over her perfectly white garment, a contrast repeated in the dark eyes set against the pallor of her face. The two older men are also characterized by their attire: Heinrich von Wittinghausen wears black velvet, indicative of his aristocratic and aesthetic inclinations, while the poet and protector of the girls, Gregor, merges with the grey rocky cliffs in his grey clothes, as a "Bruder des Felsens" (p. 220). Adopting the harsh austerity of rocks by effacing his ego, he appears only "in dem gr?bsten grauen Tuche" (p. 220). Creative manipulation of cloth is a favorite diversion of the girls in "Der Hochwald." In their home, Clarissa and Johanna sew their own dresses, and even in the forest house they continue to work with fabrics. Great quantities of silks, woolens, and linens are sent out to them in the woods, together with other materials for creative pursuits ( books, paper, paints, inks, harp, and telescope). Although there is little occasion to</page><page sequence="7">Tuch as Symbol in Stifter s "Der Hochwald" 381 display their finery, the girls enjoy making beautiful gowns. Using the fabrics according to whim, Clarissa and Johanna engage in their tailor ing with zeal, "an all ihren Stoffen und Kleidern schneidend und n?hend und ?ndernd" ( p. 240 ). At the first appearance of the girls, Johanna is embroidering roses on a piece of cloth. As she lets her mind wander to thoughts of a fearful huntsman said to be lurking in the vicinity, the rose takes on an ugly shape. Clarissa chides her sister for not paying attention to what she is doing. This modest art work serves as object for a moral lesson fre quently demonstrated in Stifter's works, namely that man can function properly only when he is in control of himself and free from passions and self-interest, for only then can he give objects around him their proper due. Spinning and weaving, the basic processes of cloth-making, figure prominently in the imagery of "Der Hochwald." Much like human artists, elements of nature are ever creating new aesthetic forms, as metaphorically they are said to spin and weave. The sun, for example, is engaged in this process: "Die Nachmittagssonne . . . spann schon manchen roten Faden zwischen den dunklen Tannenzweigen herein, von Ast zu Ast springend, zitternd und spinnend durch die viel zweigigen Augen der Himbeer- und Brombeergestr?uche" (pp. 222 f.). Sunlight produces "die langen F?den des Nachsommers" (p. 244), "jene gl?nzenden F?den" (p. 274); "die Sonne . . . wob hei?e, wTei?geschmolzne Blitze und kalte feuchte blaue Schatten" (p. 278). The fog, in a frenzy of creativity, also weaves new formations in the landscape: "Der Nebel . . . wogte und webte . . . drau?en, entweder Spinnenweben ?ber den See und durch die T?ler ziehend, oder silberne Inseln und Waldesst?cke durcheinander w?lzend" (p. 278). The rocky cliff appears to be "aus Luft gewoben" (p. 230). The moon's rays spin from peak to peak ("spannen von Berg zu Berg"?p. 232). Rays of moonlight hang like threads and seam the water like a cloth: "Vollmond hing lange Strahlen in die Fichtenzweige, und s?umte das Wasser mit stummen Blitzen" (p. 242). Even artificial lamplight spins golden threads which interweave with the fog to embellish what is visualized as the silvery fabric of night: "Lampenlicht [spann] goldne F?den . . . in die Silbernacht des Nebels" (pp. 283 f.). Thread imagery is also applied to sound. The song of a goldfinch, for example, is drawn out "wie ein anderes d?nnes Goldf?dchen von Zweig zu Zweig" (p. 223). Bird calls are not mere sense-phenomena, but take on the aesthetic aspect of human art, in that, like poetry, they commu nicate emotion and message: "Schmelz, oder Klage . . . Ruf oder Mah nung" (p. 218) from deep within the forest.</page><page sequence="8">382 Sf?gren Even motion is described as thread interweaving a fabric; so the horizontal flight of the geese: "durch den grauen Himmel der graue Faden der Wanderg?nse" (p. 283), and the vertical drift of smoke: "ein d?nner blauer Rauchfaden" (p. 291 ). The flight of the bird of prey also produces designs, "langsame Kreise und Figuren" (p. 245), against a background of sky, much like figures woven into cloth. Soaring in majesty, the bird puts on a spectacle of "Kreise und Figuren," "gro?e Bogen" (p. 245), "Kreise und Linien" (p. 246), which the girls admire as a "Naturspiel" (p. 245). Nature's artistic creativity, which produces aesthetic forms of light, sound, and design, is most frequently pictured as the process of "spin ning and weaving." This homely term applying literally to the making of cloth applies metaphorically here to the creation of all kinds of art forms and thus provides a clear connection between the concept of cloth and the concept of art. Spinning and weaving is but one metaphor used to indicate the creative aspect of nature, which is experienced here as a field of aes thetic activity. Everything in nature has the urge to express itself, to communicate its meaning and its feelings: "Alles schiebt und dr?ngt sich, Alles spricht, Alles erz?hlt," "in Allem ist Sinn und Empfindung" (p. 225). Illuminated with magical light and color, nature is full of anthropomorphic entities producing forms of beauty: sunrays ignite the bushes into green fire, bringing forth colored mushrooms, and coax silver sparks from invisible waters. The aspen tree shaking its leaves in the wind brings about "Gezitter von Gr?n und Silber" (p. 217); the pine trees form "erhabene S?uleng?nge" (p. 218); the vaults of their branches toss out "blitzende gr?ne Karfunkel," decorating the white garments of the girls with glittering jewels and fleeting shadows (p. 217), and the moon paints designs on the furniture "malte die Fenster gitter auf die Sessel" (p. 258). Nature in anthropomorphic image works on rocks to fashion chairs: "Die leichten Finger des Regens haben daran gearbeitet und das weiche, aber unabl?ssige Schreinerzeug der Luft und der Sonne haben sie gezimmert" (p. 250). As the representative human embodiment of Nature's creative force, Gregor tosses the images of blossoms and trees, sun and clouds about, with prodigious energy, as the fog tosses lights and shadows about: "durcheinanderw?lzend" (p. 278). There is again allusion to cloth making, in the description of his poetic activity: "Die wunderlichen Gedanken seines Herzens spannen sich . . . aus ihm heraus" (p. 226); the legends he relates enmesh his listeners in "ein Gewirr von Zauber f?den" (p. 241). The concepts of protection and concealment, beauti fication, revelation, and creativity, which merge in the image Tuch</page><page sequence="9">Tuch as Symbol in Stifter s "Der Hochwald" 383 also apply to the functions of the poet: he leads the girls to their hiding place and guards them from evil "mit dem Reichtume seiner Erfah rungen zu [ihrem] Sch?tze beh?lflich" (p. 226). His words transform the forest reality into mystery, magic, beauty, indeed into a "Fabel" and a "M?rchen" (p. 226). Gregor projects Stifter's image of his own poetic self as interpreter and voice of nature, as creator of aesthetic forms, and as savior. The realm that Gregor inhabits is one of myths and patterns, wherein reality is interpreted by the poet, who transforms the phenomena of nature from transient and temporal condition into permanence and beauty beyond decay. The predatory bird may serve as illustration for the transmutation that takes place through art. While alive, the bird displays the marvelous creative power of nature, but when struck down by the bullet, the creature becomes a pathetic, mutilated thing: "Es war ein sonderbarer Anblick, wie die langen triefenden Schwingen hinab hingen, wie die nassen, klebenden Federn den sehnigten K?rperbau blo?legten und die Wunde zeigten, die mitten in die Brust ging" (p. 252). Through Gregor's skillful efforts, the corpse of the bird is recom posed into "sch?ne Ordnung" and the outward form of the feathered creature is re-established and made permanent for the girls as an "Andenken ihres Waldlebens." Art is Gregor's response to the challenge of death and disorder. The author too employs aesthetic devices, as cover-ups, to mitigate the hor ror of the senseless slaughter inherent in the war, which forms the back ground of the story. In the opinion of Walter H?herer, Stifter's use of concealing devices is almost excessive: "In diesem Ansatz liegt auch die Grenze Stifters, die Gefahr des Formelhaften, Allzubreiten, des Verh?llens um der H?lle willen."20 For example, the story, which is set into distant past time, is also placed far away into distant space, by means of an elaborate introduction covering seven pages. In the narra tive itself, the sensuous imagery is so entrancing that the reader barely notices the devastation that takes place in actuality7. The romantic overlay of the grim tale may be exemplified by'a descriptive passage on clouds, which create pictures of ephemeral light, warmth, and beauty, temporarily covering the basic nullity of space ("?de des Himmels"? p. 202) with an illusion. The wanton killing of the bird is the central event of this story, in which all things move inexorably toward death. Although the sisters reach old age, they appear more dead than alive, namely as "das . . . vergehende Gesch?pf" (p. 297), and as "ein gestorbner Engel" (p. 296). Clarissa's tears flow "wie das letzte Blut eines get?teten Gesch?pfes" 20 Walter H?llerer, Zwischen Klassik und Moderne (Stuttgart, 1958), pp. 365 f.</page><page sequence="10">384 Sf?gren (p. 296), and she makes her peace with Heaven only at the cost of capitu lation, total abnegation of her self and her needs. According to Gunter Hertling, the ever-smiling, indifferent Heaven represents "die mitleids los-vernichtende Kraft des Unergr?ndlichen," pushing the innocent into "die letzte Einsamkeit, die im Aussterben des Geschlechts beschlossen ist."21 Death comes to the vegetation as well. With the approach of winter, frost touches the ferns and causes them to droop "gleichsam gesotten und schlapp" (p. 286), as they approach "Veralterung und dem Verfall" (p. 286); the leaves of the trees change color to "rostbraun oder blutrot oder vergelb t" (p. 286)?adjectives with negative connotations sug gesting, respectively, corrosion, violence, and loss of vitality; the red foliage is described as "schwache blutige Streifen" (p. 284) in a repel lent image. The damage inflicted upon the landscape by the senseless battle be tween Wittinghausen and the Swedes leaves its imprint of violence on the castle: "In dem ?u?ern Mauerwerke war manch tiefe Verwundung ersichtlich" (p. 291), and in the surroundings: "Der Rasen umher war verschwunden und glich einer gestampften Tenne, von tiefen R?der spuren durchfurcht, und hie und da mit einem verkohlten Baume oder Tr?mmern unbekannter Ger?te bedeckt" (p. 291). The sinister aspect of the strange black spots ("fremde schwarze Flecken"?p. 286) on the castle walls rises to ominous proportion inside the ruins, where the demon of unreason arouses terror in the beholder: "Hier durch aus gebrannte T?ren und Fenster glotzten ihn G?nge und Gem?cher an, die ihm schauerlich fremd vorkamen, und aus ihren H?hlungen wehte eine ungastliche Luft" (p. 291). Cloaked in elegantly formal style, the milieu of the Waldsee is de scribed as a scene of morbidity and violence: Es ist eine wilde Lagerung zerrissener Gr?nde, aus nichts bestehend, als tief schwarzer Erde, dem dunklen Totenbette tausend j?hriger Vege tation, worauf viele einzelne Granitkugeln liegen, wie bleiche Sch?del von ihrer Unterlage sich abhebend, da sie vom Regen blo?gelegt, gewaschen und rund gerieben sind.?Ferner liegt noch da und dort das wei?e Gerippe eines gest?rzten Baumes und angeschwemmte Kl?tze. (p- 194) The natural objects here termed "Totenbett," "bleiche Sch?del," "wei?e Gerippe" are clearly death images. Haphazard destruction is conveyed in the adjectives "wilde," "zerrissene," "gest?rzten," and "ange schwemmt," all of which deny the presence of any order and rational 21 Gunter Hertling, "Grenz?bergang und Raum Verletzung," ASILO 16 (1967), 7i</page><page sequence="11">Tuch as Symbol in Stifters "Der Hochwald" 385 principle in nature. The forest covering the hills is seen as a vast black coffin-cloth: "das Walddunkel ein riesig hinausgehendes schwarzes Bahrtuch" (p. 289), in a variant of the Tt?c/i-image, here serving the existential function of concealing the ugliness of death and the fright fulness of chaos. In the midst of the death-scape, there is a realm of quietude, perma nence, and perfection: the Waldsee itself constantly mirrors reality in untroubled static pictures. Like a cloth, the lake, "weich zwischen dem harten Geklippe," softens the harshness of the rocky cliffs and covers up the logs that have plunged into the water. In this scene of repose the events of life are transitory and insignificant: the pine cone falls and disappears, the vulture screams briefly and is silent. Beyond change and beyond time, this realm is "regungslos" (p. 195); there is "buchst?blich nie ein Wind, das Wasser [ruht] unbeweglich." The lake shows the events of life as aesthetic phenomena which pose no threat, but merely invite contemplation: "Man kann hier tagelang weilen und sinnen" (p. 195). The lake as both a Tuch and a Glasspiegel hides the underlying ground of reality with a cover of pictures. There is something strange, however, about a body of water visual ized as a taut cloth without a wrinkle, as there is something eerie about the absolute stillness of the lake and the unmarred beauty of the forest refuge. The very perfection of these images indicates a lack of life. Kurt Mautz has taken note of the artificial quality of Stifters landscapes: "Die Vergleichsbilder, deren sich Stifter selber zur Darstellung der 'jungfr?ulichen Wildnis' des Hochwalds st?ndig bedient, entstammen gerade jenem Bereich des von und f?r den Menschen Gemachten."22 Listing a long series of items used by the author as similes and meta phors, he correctly points out that the whole list "l??t eher an die Auslagen eines Juweliergesch?fts und das Interieur eines gro?b?rger lich-aristokratischen Salons des vorm?rzlichen Wien denken als an einen Urwald." According to Mautz, these images indicate "eine ?ber schwengliche Idealisierung der Natur." The process occurring here is so drastic that the term "Idealisierung" cannot adequately define it, however. More precisely stated, what takes place here is a transforma tion from nature into art: the author has turned natural objects into objects handcrafted by man and has created a realm of the aesthetic. Like the bird, who is seen against the sky, "als w?re er eine in diesem Dome aufgeh?ngte gefl?gelte Ampel" (pp. 247 f.), the human char acters are also seen as art objects. Presented as images in poetry, paint ing, and sculpture, the girls are "zart gedichtete Wesen aus einer 22 Kurt Mautz, "Das antagonistische Naturbild in Stifters 'Studien,' " Adalbert Stifter: Studien und Interpretationen ( Heidelberg, 1968), p. 28.</page><page sequence="12">386 Sj?gren nordischen Runensage" (p. 241), "zwei Engelsbilder aus einem Rahmen" (p. 223), and "zwei tadellose Marmorbilder" (p. 258). Their father enters the story by appearing to step out of a painting (p. 206); his appearance is that of a "Ruine" of a statue from antiquity. The girls themselves refer to the unreality and illusory quality of the landscape: the forest seems like "eine Fabel" (p. 222) and they feel they are "inmitten eines M?rchens" (p. 241), while they become fairy tale figures ("sie waren ein M?rchen f?r die ringsum staunende Wildnis"?p. 241 ) .23 From this magical realm the girls voice nostalgia for the ordinaiy life they left behind: "Also ist es wahr, die Heimat, das gute Vaterhaus ist preisgegeben, und verloren, all ihr fr?her Leben ist abgeschnitten" (p. 231). Sensing that they have lost their identity as real persons to become mere actors in a fairy-tale, they feel dizzy and disoriented: "Sie selbst [waren] wie Mitspieler in ein buntes M?rchen gezogen, alles neu, alles fremd, alles seltsam und dr?uend?in dem drohenden Wirrsal kein Halt" (p. 231). As Friedrich Korff has made clear, Stifter himself suffered from the unresolvable conflict between the demands of art and the demands of life.24 The panic voiced by the girls may reflect the distress of the author, who felt threatened by the art which enthralled him while it demanded the relinquishment of ordinary, familiar life. Beneath the rational con cern about losing out in life because of the uncompromising austerity required by art, one can perceive an existential fear of losing reality and self in a lifeless realm of artifice. The first Tuch image, "ein gespanntes Tuch ohne eine einzige Falte," in its tautness, in its general abstract quality, and in the un natural strain of its application to a body of water, makes an unpleasant impression upon the reader. To be sure, through the associations with concealment and beautification, this Tuch embodies symbolic values similar to those of Goethe's "der Dichtung Schleier" in the poem "Zueignung." But the repugnance aroused by the Waldsee image to gether with the threatened loss of human identity in the fairy-tale forest suggests that the eighteenth-century apotheosis of art is no longer fully tenable with Stifter. His faith in art as a means of establishing order and truth within a universe grounded on chaos and nothingness seems 23 Wolfgang Preisendanz ("Die Erz?hlfunktion der Naturdarstellung hei Stifter" WW, 16 [Nov.-Dez., 1966], 407-18) has recognized the landscape's illusory quality, which he interprets as representative of the illusion of art. See p. 414: "Dieses als Fabel und M?rchen charakterisierte Naturerlebnis der Schwestern soll durch die Metaphorik, die Vergleiche und als o?&gt;-Figuren zur Sprache kommen, und selbst verst?ndlich hilft gerade diese perspektivengepr?gte Naturdarstellung, den Leser ?ber das Illusion?re des Asyls vor den Heimsuchungen des Krieges zu orientieren." 24 Friedrich Korff, Diastole und Systole: Zum Thema Jean Paul und Adalbert Stifter (Bern, 1969).</page><page sequence="13">Tuch as Symbol in Stifters "Der Hochwald" 387 to be undermined by a skepticism more characteristic of a later age. While the aesthetic orientation toward life may offer some protection against too stark a confrontation with the terrors of existence, the per fection of the aesthetic realm, as imparted by the motionless Waldsee and the many-splendored forest, is too artificial to be compatible with life. In "Der Hochwald," which on the philosophical level is an ex ploration of the equivocal concept of art, Tuch is a key image. Spread over objects in the landscape, the image conceals and beautifies harsh facts of existence, but in itself it is an artificial thing that in a sense is inimical to living reality.</page></plain_text>
