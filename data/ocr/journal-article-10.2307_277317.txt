<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY WAKEMAP: A COLUMBIA RIVER SITE MISPRONOUNCED In this day when, according to perhaps too sanguine recent reports, physical anthropology, ethnology, lin- guistics, folklore, and archaeology are happily converg- ing, it was a shock to hear that a relatively well-known archaeological site on the north side of the Grand Dalles of the Columbia River in the state of Washing- ton is commonly referred to as Wakemap (rhymes with "lakemap"). According to John M. Corbett of the U.S. National Park Service who has recently visited this old site, originally described in 1805 by Lewis and Clark, such a completely anglicized pronunciation is now com- mon currency among the various archaeological field parties who have been working at or near the site during the last few years, and he never heard of or thought of it as being pronounced otherwise. Actually, the near-correct pronunciation is Wakemap (rhymes with "knock 'em up"). (For a phonetic render- ing see Spier and Sapir 1930: 164.) The name is Wishram in derivation, as given by Sapir (1909: 201), and the traditional site was so identified and designated by Schenck and myself in 1924 (Strong, Schenck, and Steward 1930: 6, 8), and by the Indians in that vicinity. In fact, a very old Indian, Jim Cathlamet, told us a fine vagina dentata story which dramatically accounted for the mound with its numerous broken flint points and pestles. According to him the original Wakemap mound was a female ogress who was filled with sharp flints and lured amorous men to painful death. Fortu- nately, Old Man Coyote heard of this and through the use of 5 long stone pestles accomplished the disintegra- tion of the ogress. Jim was an old, old man with a sugarloaf deformed skull, and, I suspect, may have been a Lower rather than an Upper Chinook Indian. How- ever, the story and its specific identification with the Wakemap mound was known to all the Wishram Indians. Curtis (1911: 113) also gives a local version of the story. A poor linguist, the writer is no stickler for extreme linguistic finesse, but it does seem that the Indians, not the archaeologists, should have preference here. Wak- emap is a fine example of a site that is historically, archaeologically, linguistically, and ethnologically im- portant. It is fervently to be hoped that its full record may be recovered and published before the rising waters cover it. CURTIS, E.S. 1911 The North American Indian, Vol. 8. Seattle.

October, 1954 ANOTHER CRUCIFORM ARTIFACT FROM SONORA In the October, 1954, issue of AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 174-5), A. McL. Howard called attention to a type of cruciform artifact which occurs sporadically through northwestern Mexico and south- eastern Arizona. The writer would like to make note of a similar find from a site in west-central Sonora. This cross (Fig. 135) was found on an extensive vil- lage midden in the vicinity of the pueblo of San Jos6 de Guaymas, approximately 3.7 km. northeast from the Guaymas airport. The site has temporarily been desig- nated 53:F-71. The object was but one of many obsid- ian and basalt artifacts found scattered over the site area. It is possible that this cultural occupation repre- sents the predecessors of the surviving Guaymefias In- dians whom Father Kino encountered in 1687. The artifact is of polished obsidian, with fine second- ary chipping along the arms. It measures 39 and 41 mm. tip to tip, and 8 mm. in thickness. This cross supports the highland-coastal relationship already sug- gested by Ekholm's finds at Guasave and Topolobampo, Sinaloa. Stone artifacts from the site included numerous pro- jectile points (fishtail; notched with convex base; tri- angular with rounded-base corners), spearheads, knife blades (both pressure and percussion flaked), side and end scrapers (predominantly percussion flaked; plano- convex), and large single flakes (possibly for opening mussel shells). No sherds were found on this site, although 2 related sites (53:F-73 and F-74, approxi- mately 1.3 km. away) produced limited amounts. FIG. 135.

The field survey was originally contracted with the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia of Mexico City for the summer of 1952, but the writer was not able to carry out these investigations until 1953. The research was financed in part by the American Philosophical Society (Penrose Fund) and The Kansas Academy of Science. Bill Young, of Spring- field, Massachusetts, served in the capacity of field assistant. GEORGE E. FAY Southern State College Magnolia, Ark. December, 1954 i FIG. 136.
