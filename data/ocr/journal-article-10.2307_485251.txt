<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eugenia W. Herbert. Iron, Gender, and Power: Rituals of Transformation in African Societies. Indiana University Press, 1993. 277 PP. Iron, Gender, and Power is not only a fitting sequel to Eugenia W. Herbert's earlier study Red Gold of Africa: Copper in Precolonial History and Culture (Madison, Wisconsin: 1984), it is likewise a powerful discussion of the articulation of transfor- mative rituals and technologies - mainly iron smelting - found in sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on a broad synthesis of secondary sources - as well as on fieldwork observa- tions at the reconstructed Banjeli Bassari (Togo, 1985) and Ekonda (Zaire, 1989) smelt- ing sites - Herbert meticulously uncovers the intricate cosmologies and ritual infra- structures of iron-smelting processes which are owned primarily by males. (While smithing is commonplace in most of sub-Saharan Africa, Herbert indicates that most iron ore smelting had ceased by the 195 os, to be replaced for the most part by imported iron implements.) Also, the subject of her investigative analysis is the cosmological- ritual discourse surrounding hunting and royal investiture (male endeavors), as well as the less ritualized pottery-making, largely a female craft. The results of this important study are an intricately layered and articulate analy- sis yielding a fourfold discourse: ({) a theoretical paradigm for an examination of the surprising extent to which technologies, cosmologies, and associated rituals were</page><page sequence="2">334 CJAS / RCEA 29:2 1995 deeply gendered in sub-Saharan Africa (while large numbers of furnaces were "females" or "wives," they were "worked" by men who also served as "husband-mid- wives" at the "birthing" of the iron bloom); (2) a powerful and wide-ranging analysis- synthesis of ritual behaviors as they related to transformative processes (iron smelt- ing, hunting, and kingly investiture); and (3) a complicated calculus demonstrating the extent to which age and the generational infrastructure "supported" much of the con- ceptualization and manipulation of gender and power, even in some instances involv- ing gender crossovers. Finally, recognizing that transformative processes occurred exclusively within "power fields," Herbert's study is ultimately the dialogics of power - not the social sci- entist's political power, but rather a transformative power-knowledge (hidden and sac- erdotal) - which, when "owned" and appropriately accessed through prescriptive ritu- alized behaviors, became the means of control over human and spiritual resources. Thus, rather than simply a study of iron technologies in sub-Saharan Africa or another gender dialogue for that matter, Herbert's profoundly complicated discourse reveals the cosmological-and-ritual-texts articulating around gender, sexuality, procreativity, fertility-sterility, age, ancestors, and generational differentials that informed the intel- lectualization of iron-smelting technologies. More specifically, Herbert demonstrates the "close association of iron with fertil- ity and with sources of power seen as both ancestral and largely female. In fact, iron- working in Africa presents us with the apparent paradox of a male-dominated craft that must invoke (and appropriate) elements of female power to succeed. We see this not only in the creation of anthropomorphic (mainly female) furnaces," she concludes, "but also in the range of rituals that are structured around the opposition and com- plementarity of male and female, fertility and sterility, living and dead" (5). In other words, female fertility, procreativity, and birthing were the ultimate paradigms and metaphors appropriated by men who "impregnated" furnaces, "midwifing" them at the "birthing" of the iron bloom. By that same token, the "sterility" and "still birth- ing" of iron ore furnaces were as much disasters in smelting technologies as similar tragedies among women. And because ancestors were integral to a historical under- standing of a social existence, Herbert finds them, especially female ones, important components of the transformative paradigm. Then, daringly extending this gendered paradigm of transformation and ritual to other processes (hunting and royal investitures), Herbert argues that sub-Saharan tech- nologies requiring sacred access to the supernatural eventually drew on the same con- struct, in one form or another, of female fertility and procreativity. Tauntingly, she opens herself to the critique of having reconstructed another undifferentiated, neodif- fusionist, and timeless Africa, bogged down in the template of invariable cultures. Nothing of the sort, she retorts - although if the truth be told, the study's historical- chronological boundaries are all but invisible (unavoidably I suppose, given the nature of her investigation). Instead, Herbert sees to it that the mind-boggling local and regio- nal variations - which inform her richly textured empirical data base - amply demon- strate an incredible openness to historical process and change. Moreover, she argues, transformative processes, in general, owed more to an anthropomorphic template predicated on procreativity, birth, life, and death (and hence, process and transforma- tion), than to any other theory of social change. And because she deals primarily with</page><page sequence="3">335 Book Reviews / Comptes rendus ritual processes, human behavior becomes the dominant configuration for change and agency in a world articulating between life and death, fertility, and sterility. But if Herbert conjures a compelling argument for the articulation and transfer of gender across the prism of transformative technologies, her discussion of the predomi- nantly female craft of pottery-making, conducted usually by the wives of iron workers, seems less cogent. Herbert logically expects pottery technologies and rituals to privi- lege those of the furnace and forge. Not so, however: a phenomenon that she attributes to the "less dangerous and less impressive" conditions of pottery-making, requiring no violence nor life-negating forces comparable to that of smith, king, and hunter. Not invoking the same fusion of masculine and feminine power, pottery-making, like a girl's initiation, belonged more to the females' "'natural' domain" (232-33). Although this is a bold attempt to explain the "under-ritualization" of pottery-mak- ing, I find the argument wanting, since pots were manipulated from "living" earth, water, fire (firing), and light (sun-baked), all part of the spiritual universe articulating with social value, gender, and social change. Thus, simply to argue that pottery-mak- ing was less ritualized because it was less dangerous, impressive, and prone to violence underestimates the fact that potters also interacted with life forces. Not to detract from this powerful book, a further historicized investigation into gendered pottery- making and male-female social relationships does seem called for - an observation that Herbert readily acknowledges.
