<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIETY AND GENDER IN THE GOSPEL OF ST. LUKE William H. Shurr I. Luke's Infancy Narrative 'The Prologue to the Hellenistic biography which came to be known as "The Gospel of Luke" proposes a unique orientation to the life of its subject. Like Matthew's Infancy Narrative, it is constructed as a thematic and theological introduction to the ministry of Jesus. Both Matthew and Luke provide the story of an endangered and suffering child, surrounded by earthly figures and celestial wonders, all suggesting the direction the adult will later follow. Popular constructions of the Christmas Story merge the two Infancy Narratives, as if there were no differences. In focusing solely on Luke's story, we must pare away Matthew's details: the vision given to the supposed father of Jesus in a dream, the wise men with their memorable gifts, the flight into Egypt, the massa- cre of the innocents by a wicked Herod, and the prophetic cita- tions from the Hebrew Scriptures.1 Matthew's Infancy Narrative is fashioned with a view to establishing its hero's continuity with the Jewish tradition of Moses and the Prophets, even in its con- demnation of Judaism's most recent nemesis, the hellenizing Herod. Luke's details are different: the parallel stories of the miracu- lous conceptions of John and his cousin Jesus by surprised mothers; the Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth; the plight of the two puzzled fathers, Zechariah and Joseph; the enthusiastic re- sponses of Anna and Simeon in the Temple - presented with William H.

In both Matthew and Luke, the Virgin Birth is important, but only as a segment of a larger inquiry into Divine origins. Matthew and Luke share this tradition, but their interests immediately di- verge: Matthew's interest is the Virgin Birth as a culmination of the Jewish prophetic and messianic tradition; the Hellenist Luke, on the contrary, uses the Virgin Birth as a center for exploration of the mystery of Divine fertility, a mystery celebrated in just about every Greek shrine of antiquity (Delphi was still the Medi- terranean world's most popular and influential religious center well into the Christian era - it was not shut down until 381 CE). Luke's literary strategy is to construct his narrative from the figures of three paired men and women; in each case, he focuses on what we would now call the sexual life and behavior of the participants. Of the first pair, Elizabeth and Zechariah, Luke reports: "Eliza- beth was barren and both [she and Zechariah] were advanced in years" (Luke 1.7). Zechariah emphasizes their sexual incapability to the angel; "I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years"; she is also barren (Luke 1.18). Yet God produces a child for a couple who are impotent and infertile. Luke suggests that the Divine initiative is the primary cause underlying and even over- riding human mechanisms of conception. Luke's second pair, Mary and Joseph, also exhibit atypical sex- ual behavior. Mary is "a virgin" (Luke 1.27), and when told that she will have a child, she too emphasizes her sexual inactivity: "How shall this be, since I have no husband?" (Luke 1.34). Luke's Joseph is hardly mentioned at all, except to let the reader know the crucial facts: that when Mary became obviously preg- nant he had not yet had sexual intercourse with her; that she is from beginning to end of the story just his "betrothed" and never a wife (Luke 1.27); and that he is with her during the birth of Jesus. In the text they are not married; even at the time of the birth of Jesus, she is still known only as Joseph's "betrothed" (Luke 2.5). By this repetition, Luke seems to insist on the irregu- larity of the relation. Jesus was not born within the structure of a traditional or legal marriage, nor by ordinary sexual intercourse. For Luke's second couple, the Divine initiative is just as strong and determining as it had been for his first couple.</page><page sequence="3">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 183 Sexual status and behavior continue to be of interest in the description of the third couple, Anna the Prophetess and Si- meon. During the ritual of purification, Luke gives Anna nothing to say. He only reports her words indirectly: "she gave thanks to God and spoke of him . . ," (Luke 2.38). But he then provides several details of her sexual history, including her relatively short encounter with heterosexual activity: she was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity, and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple. . . . (Luke 2.36-37) Paired with Anna is Simeon, a wise and holy old man who also lived out his life in the Temple and who emerges to identify and acknowledge the Messiah. There is no sexual relationship sug- gested or implied between him and Anna. Simeon seems to be extremely elderly, with no wife, children, or family anywhere in sight. He is a dedicated c√©libataire, a man of wisdom and spiritual insight. It is he who tells Mary that her son will be "a sign" of contradiction (Luke 2.34). He is among the first to recognize the new Messiah and the only one to embrace him. It is clear from this sequence that all three couples play roles that are essential for ushering the Messiah into the world, and that their sexual status and behavior have something to do with it. Luke's Infancy Narrative is constructed precisely to emphasize the idea that Divine fruitfulness does not depend on legitimated heterosexual congress. In fact, the relations between the three couples progress from married but infertile (Zechariah and Eliz- abeth); to fertile but only "betrothed" and not married or sexu- ally active with one another (Joseph and Mary); to not married or sexually active at all (Anna and Simeon). In Luke's descrip- tion, not even the pairing of Joseph and Mary falls into the cate- gory of a legal marriage or traditional family. None of the couples would fit any supposed societal norm, but each of the couples has something to do with bringing the Divine to birth in the world. In fact, Luke seems determined to explore relations that transcend traditional and cultural notions of sexual behavior. Luke himself seems to have given considerable thought to the question of sexuality in its various manifestations. Even the quick- ening of John the Baptist happens only when two loving women</page><page sequence="4">184 SOUNDINGS William H. Shurr meet; the older one feels for the first time a "leaping" in her womb when she meets the young virgin (Luke 1.41-44). Even the two temple celibates who pronounce on the event play a part in ushering the Divine into the world. Luke's Infancy Narrative is anything but a sanctioning of the traditional nuclear family, as it has often been presented homilet- ically. Instead, this Infancy Narrative is a philosophical commen- tary on Divine initiative that can override human limitations (Zechariah and Elizabeth) and even incarnate Itself in a histori- cal human setting. At the beginning of his Gospel, Luke relegates human and het- erosexual fertility to a lower level of importance than the com- plex wonders of Divine fertility. At the end of his Gospel, he confirms this theme in a framing episode. While carrying his cross, Jesus is met by a group of weeping women (Luke 23.27). The scene, uniquely Luke's, confirms the ideas on sexuality presented in his Infancy Narrative. Jesus's words, which seem ur- gent and almost angry, are: Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for your- selves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, "Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck!" (Luke 23.28-29) Heterosexual marriage is by no means centered and privileged in The Gospel of Luke. Here, as at many other points in Luke's Gospel, one cannot help but think of a canonical Greek writer and his earlier meta- physical speculation on sexuality and Divine generativity. At the high point of Plato's Symposium, Socrates recounts the doctrines on love revealed to him by the prophetess Diotima. At this heart of the Symposium is a sequence of language and idea that seems relevant here. Diotima proposes to Socrates that the highest goal of life is "having the good for oneself always" (101). The method is "a breeding [procreating] in the beautiful, both of body and of soul" (101). In her use of figurative language, Diotima sets up two parallel situations: that of love between a citizen and his wife, and the higher love between a mature man and a boy. On the first level, a man might be "pregnant in body" and turn to a woman with the desire to beget children, to "secure for themselves, so they think, immortality and memory and hap- piness" (103). At the higher level, a man is "pregnant in soul"</page><page sequence="5">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 185 (103). He has "divinity in him; whose soul from youth is preg- nant with [the desire for wisdom and virtue]"; he goes out to find "the beautiful thing in which he can beget" (103). For this sec- ond ideal level, Diotima boldly uses the procreative language of the first level: in Rouse's translation, men become pregnant with the desire for Beauty and virtue, then copulate, conceive, carry, bring to birth, nurture, and protect the resulting wisdom and vir- tue and the contemplation of "the great ocean of beauty" (105). The creativity at this second and higher level results in a kind of fusion with the Divine: it is "granted him to become the friend of God and immortal if any man ever is" (106). The Hellenistic Luke corrects and extends Plato, and prefers the Greek philosopher's thought over the Hebrew sources be- hind Matthew. Sexual behavior exists beyond and outside of the confining context of mere reproduction. Plato's metaphor of sexual behavior leading to the appearance of the Divine leads to Luke's still bolder analysis of the actual birth of the Divine in the human world. Luke takes a provincial incarnation and sets it in an intellectual context that is meaningful to a wider audience. Writing for a Hellenistic audience, Luke has to solve the very great problem of how to get a god - - mostly known for his human life, teachings, and death - creditably born for his "gen- tile" audience.3 II. The Male-Male Embrace All commentators note that Luke presents materials no other Gospel records. But far from being of doubtful significance or importance, as Schweitzer maintains (46), these unique stories bring us directly into the center of Luke's personal insights as author. Among these unique materials are three of the tradition's greatest stories: the Prodigal Son, the Good Samaritan, and the finely conceived story of justice achieved in the after-life, Dives and the poor beggar Lazarus.4 So instructive and well-told are these stories that many commentators have wondered why the other Gospel writers did not record them. They are among the most popular elements in the Gospel tradition. The modern reader discovers a common thread. All three par- ables rise to a high point with a tableau of one male embracing another in an ecstasy of spiritual union. The man from Samaria</page><page sequence="6">186 SOUNDINGS William H. Shurr medicates and binds the wounds of the man who had been at- tacked; he lifts the injured man and "set[s] him on his own beast" (Luke 10.34); then he carries him off to be further nursed and healed. The male-male embrace is a trope for Christian ten- derness and self-sacrifice, for healing and for self-less concern.5 As for the Prodigal Son, returning home after a period of youthful rebellion and waste, "while he was yet at a distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him" (Luke 15.20). To focus only on the expressive body language at the climax of this richly narrated story, the male-male embrace here stands for reconciliation, forgiveness, a gathering into union with the Father. In both stories, the narrative suggests that this embrace is re- ally a metaphor for God's attitude toward man and, by imitation, the Christian's attitude toward his neighbor. In Luke's third unique parable, Lazarus has had a miserable life as a sick beggar at the door of a selfish rich man's house. After death, poor Lazarus finds his Heavenly reward in the em- brace of Abraham. The story follows the same paradigm: once again the male-male embrace represents a state of the highest spiritual significance - here, justification and the ecstatic reward of Paradise, denied to the selfish Dives. The writer's artistic signature becomes obvious in the un- folding of these three stories. Luke's unique emphasis on the male-male embrace, once isolated and identified, can then be seen as a pervasive feature of his Gospel. The embrace is repeated, for example, almost as if in framing narratives, at the beginning and the end of the Gospel. At the beginning of his Gospel, Luke's Infancy Narrative comes to a cli- max with Simeon. In a highly dramatic gesture, Luke has him embrace the Divine Child (Luke 2.28), lifting and enfolding him in an adumbration of the ecstatic male-male embrace that can now be seen as one of the characteristic features of this Gospel. And in what will be virtually the last act in his life, Jesus, with his arms nailed open on the cross, promises the penitent thief: "Today you shall be with me in Paradise" (Luke 23.43), recalling Abraham's embrace of Lazarus. While the male-male embrace was common in Mediterranean cultures, and still is, only Luke elevates it to the status of a trope and gives it such profound religious significance.</page><page sequence="7">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 187 Luke's personal signature as a writer, beginning with the In- fancy Narrative, is the transformation of sexual and physical materials into theological statement and religious insight. Luke takes a conventional Mediterranean greeting and turns it into an intense religious action. In his hands the tender, male-male em- brace becomes a powerful metonym for the many aspects of re- ligious salvation in the preaching of Jesus: forgiveness, salvation, spiritual ecstasy, union with the Divine, transcendence, reconciliation. III. Luke's Meals Still another conspicuous structural principle in the Gospel of Luke is the series of nine meals that punctuate the narrative.6 Considering Luke's Hellenistic interests, the prominence of meals suggests a parallel with the most famous pagan meal of antiquity. Plato's Symposium dramatizes an extended conversation on friendship and love by a group of male philosophers. The discus- sion concerns the ascent to the perfection of love in the appreci- ation of Beauty. Sexuality, taken both literally and metaphorically, holds an unabashedly central place in the pro- cess. Luke's meals are not only appropriate to his inherited Gos- pel materials, they also rise to heights of transcendental love and insight in the context of the great enlightening meal of Greek literary tradition. Luke looks both ways - towards Judaism and towards Hellenism - and brings the traditions together. Luke's Hellenism is evident in part in his language. The verb Plato uses for the posture of his Symposium participants is katak- lino. At 175e, for example, the verb appears when Socrates comes in late and takes his place at the dining couch. Luke uses the same verb for several of his meal scenes: in 7.36 where Jesus is dining with an important Pharisee and disputes with him about the nature of hospitality and forgiveness; in 9.14, a preview of the messianic banquet where Jesus feeds five thou- sand from five loaves and two fishes; in 14.8 in the parable of the marriage feast while dining with another Pharisee; and in 24.30 where the heights of Divine love are revealed to the disciples at Emmaus after the resurrection.7</page><page sequence="8">1 88 SOUNDINGS William H. Shun It is important to note that the word kataklino does not appear in any of the other Gospel writers, even when they describe the same scenes. It is Luke's alone, for his own literary allusion. What is it that binds together the early symposium meals in Luke? Once the reader has asked that question, the answer be- comes obvious. Each meal includes a hostile attack on Jesus's as- sociation with outsiders like prostitutes and tax-collectors.8 Jesus takes the opportunity to describe true virtue and authen- tically religious behavior, as opposed to the conventional and le- galistic views of those who challenge him. In the first several meals, Jesus defends the outcast, the despised, the marginalized minority against the establishment figures in his society. At the first meal, a "great feast" with Levi the tax collector and his friends, Jesus is criticized both for consorting with "sinners" and for sumptuous dining (Luke 5.30-31). (Jesus is "reclining" [5.29 n.r] like Socrates in the Symposium', the synoptic parallels have him sitting [Matt. 9.10; Mark 2.15].) He responds to his critics with ominous messianic materials and the trope of marriage used in a new way: "Can you make wedding guests fast when the bride- groom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them" (Luke 5.34-35). Luke's use of the traditional figure of the Bridegroom fits a pattern of interests in sexual materials already identified, and his narrative implies that Jesus is already an outcast from Jewish orthodoxy, poised to spring from provincial preacher into the larger world as a So- cratic teacher. Luke's second meal occurs at the house of a Pharisee - as do several in Luke's narrative - as if Luke were emphasizing Jesus' s equality with the most learned, observant, and authoritative relig- ious leaders of his day. During this second meal, a woman identi- fied as a "sinner" anoints the feet of Jesus with expensive oil (Luke 7.37). The same tale is told in the other three Gospels, where the platitudinous point is made that the money spent on oil could have been more piously used to feed the poor (Matt. 26.8-9; Mark 14.4-5; John 12.5). Luke bends the story in an en- tirely different direction, making it instead the story of Jesus's forgiveness of the woman's sexual sin, if such it were. Luke's tol- erant Hellenistic view of sexuality determines his interpretation of the episode, which is entirely different from that of the other Gospel writers.</page><page sequence="9">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 1 89 Luke makes other important additions to this episode. He em- bellishes with sensual details: standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with ointment. (Luke 7.38) Buried within these additions is the phrase "standing ... at his feet." No other writer uses this detail. Matthew and Mark indicate that Jesus sat at the dining table (Matt. 26.7; Mark 14.3). Luke alone makes this a meal in the Greek style, a symposium with the diners reclining. His Jesus is again a Socratic figure of wisdom, authority, and virtue, a figure recognizable to his Hellenistic readers. Still further details become clear, illuminated by the prompt- ings of Luke's interests and methodology. In Matthew and Mark, the woman pours oil over "the head" of the seated Jesus (Matt. 26.7; Mark 14.3), making the interpretation inevitable that this was a kind of early anointing of the Messiah by a woman who vaguely discerned his true role. Matthew and Mark piously omit the fact that she is a prostitute. Luke alone makes it clear that the woman - with her foot-washing, scented oils, and unbound hair - was actually a prostitute in the act of soliciting. The cosmopol- itan Luke seems to have been comfortable with such a scene be- ing played in the life of the Messiah, a situation that the Jewish writers buried as improper. Luke's account carries no mention of any messianic anointing. Rather, Luke's Jesus is a religious leader quick to lift the stigma from the life the woman has been driven to lead. He picks up a fellow outcast and lifts her into a state of grace-filled action. But the scene is a rich one, as yet another of Luke's deviations from parallels makes clear. While Matthew and Mark place the incident in the house of Simon the Leper (Matt. 26.6; Mark 14.3), Luke changes the host to an official representative of the Jewish religion, "one of the Pharisees" (Luke 7.36). The point then becomes the difference between the official Jewish host's horror concerning the sexual "sin" of the woman and the more tolerant Hellenistic view held by Luke's Jesus towards a woman whom society had apparently reduced to this occupation. Some of the later meals reveal similar uniquely Lucan inter- ests. The seventh meal, famously called the Last Supper, is the Passover meal which Jesus conducts with his closest disciples,</page><page sequence="10">790 SOUNDINGS William H. Shurr binding his male friends together for the trials to come, showing how his life was the fulfillment of incidents historically significant to Israel, and providing them with the basis for future Eucharistie meals. Once again, Plato's Symposium looms strikingly as the para- digm. The secular Symposium of a pagan author had brought ancient thought to its highest spiritual development, with Socra- tes's recounting of Diotima's parable of the "Ladder of Love." Now, even this peak would be transcended by a new Socrates, as the meal for the male friends of Jesus unfolds and evolves into the Eucharist, the Divine meal in the Greek Christian community. For Luke the Eucharistie symposium is both outgrowth and culmination of the Greek spiritual tradition. Luke suggests by his development of narrative materials that Christianity has evolved from Judaism and merged with Hellenism to bring forth a still higher synthesis of religious wisdom and Divine love.9 Then, as a superb literary surprise, Luke has the Last Supper disintegrate into petty wrangling among dim-witted disciples who have no sense of the historical and religious importance of this meal. In the other three Gospels, the Eucharistie celebration ends with courage, unity, understanding, and even triumph.10 Luke rewrites history with dramatic irony, to suggest that the spir- itual unification of the disciples and their understanding of the messianic events will take place - as it does in his Gospel - only at a later climactic moment, only after the death and resurrec- tion of the new Socratic hero. According to Luke, it is in the final two meals after the resur- rection that Jesus will most dramatically show himself to be Di- vine, confirming the wonder stories of the Infancy Narratives which introduce his Gospel. In the first, the dinner with the two disciples at Emmaus, the setting is once again a Greek meal (the participants recline), and the company is two male friends. The men seem not to have appeared in the Gospel earlier - indicat- ing a stratum of friends and intimates not mentioned in other portions of the Gospels. At this meal, Jesus repeats the gestures of the Last Supper, the breaking and sharing of the bread. Only after this repetition of the Eucharistie gestures do the two disci- ples recognize him and believe his resurrection, and when they return to Jerusalem, disciples, they report that "he was known to</page><page sequence="11">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 1 91 them in the breaking of the bread" (Luke 24.35). The pattern of repetition is significant: as at the Last Supper, Judaic fulfillment merges with the literary conventions of Hellenistic mysticism rooted in the Symposium. Finally, to prove his resurrection and to fortify their spirits, Jesus appears at the end of Luke's Gospel to share a final bond- ing meal with the disciples. Luke's is the only Gospel in which the risen Jesus actually eats and drinks with the disciples; in the other Gospels, he watches but does not participate. Luke's is also the only synoptic Gospel in which Jesus charges his male friends to touch him after the resurrection - emphasizing in both cases the physical reality of his risen body. Perhaps there is a polemic here against Gnosticism or early Monophysitism, but it also mixes well with Luke's respect for the sensual. As Luke portrays Jesus in the sequence of meals, he is far more sensual and physical than he is in the other Gospels; he is not only the Divine messiah of Jewish expectation, but a great teacher in the Greek mold as well; and his chosen forum is the symposium/meal. In these ways, Luke succeeds in separating Jesus from provincial Judaism and reconstructing him as a wis- dom figure fully understandable and acceptable in a larger Hel- lenistic context. IV. Luke's Sources and Parallels Issues of gender and sexuality play out clearly in the Infancy Narrative, in the three unique Lucan parables and their associ- ated narratives, and in the meal/symposium structure. These his- torical issues may also furnish the keys to unlock the rationale behind Luke's creative departure from sources and parallels. An easily explainable addition, for example, if it is genuine, is Luke's placement of an angel, a friend, in the garden, to strengthen Jesus's resolve during the unbearable isolation just before his ex- ecution. No other Gospel provides this comfort, and it is textually dubious in Luke as well. With some of his changes, Luke rejects a determined and rigid anti-sexuality that afflicts other New Testament writers. Matthew has Jesus saying "everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (5.28). Luke does not equate fantasy with actual sin and omits the saying en-</page><page sequence="12">192 SOUNDINGS William H. Shun tirely. His Jesus is described from a different set of authorial values. In Matthew, Jesus teaches that divorce coupled with remar- riage is adultery, and Luke repeats the saying. However, Matthew goes on to add, when the disciples opine that it might be better not to marry at all in such a case, that: Not all men can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. (Matt. 19.12) Luke omits these statements as if they were fanatical and repul- sive. Surely he knows about birth defects and mutilations, but his broader Hellenistic sympathies seem not to allow them into a privileged religious status; and the ultimate of religious fanati- cism, self-mutilation, is not even to be mentioned. In fact, in the Acts of the Apostles, Luke still seems to be brooding over this subject when he records that the Ethiopian eunuch, an early con- vert, was a very important man as well as serious and studious, and ripe for instruction in the new religion (Acts 8.27-40). One of Luke's most astonishing transformations of a source involves his re-writing of the incident of the fig tree. In Matthew and Mark, the disciples try to find something to eat from a leaf- ing fig-tree that has not yet begun to bear fruit; Jesus curses the tree, and it withers (Matt. 21.19; Mark 11.13-14). The issues in Matthew and Mark are barrenness and fertility, with an unquali- fied curse on barrenness. Matthew and Mark present Jesus as a wizard or magician, and his message is rather stark and simplistic: be productive or die. Luke brings a different perspective regarding gender and sexual- ity to the story. He not only challenges but actually reverses the teaching of Jesus. Matthew and Mark have Jesus rather petulantly kill the fig tree because of its barrenness, and they record it as a real incident in the life of Jesus. Luke casts it as a parable, provid- ing the opportunity for a more flexible exploration of its the- matic potential. In Luke, the barren tree is spared, and the owner is encouraged to dig around it and fertilize it, in the hope that it might "bear fruit next year" (Luke 13.9)! I find a wry hu- mor here in the suggestion that one is not to be killed for the mere fact of not providing offspring. It seems an ironic corree-</page><page sequence="13">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 1 93 tion to Luke's fellow writers, with their grimly literal system of rewards and punishments and their arguments that people should be fruitful and multiply. Luke bends the story to correct their narrow-minded literalness and possible homophobia. Mark's description of the healing of Peter's mother-in-law also compares interestingly with Luke's (Mark 1.30-31; Luke 4.38-39). Mark specifies two vivid details: "[Jesus] took her by the hand and lifted her up" (Mark 1.31). Surprisingly Luke omits these details, refusing to allow Jesus to touch and embrace a woman. The omission might slide by unnoticed and unremarked, except that a few verses later in both accounts Jesus heals other people by touching them. Mark comments that Jesus heals a male leper by "stretch [ing] out his hand and touch [ing] him (1.41), while Luke reports that he heals a group of people who are "sick with various diseases" by "[laying] his hands on every one of them" (4.40). Luke tells another healing story (in 7.1-10) that also appears elsewhere in the Gospels, in this case in Matthew (8.5-13) and John (4.46-53). All three versions describe the Roman Centurion and his belief that Jesus can heal his servant even from a dis- tance. But only Luke adds the detail that the young slave with whom this Roman officer travels "was dear to him" (Luke 7.2), a distinctly Platonic addition. If the final words of Jesus before his death on the cross can be taken as thematic climaxes to the narrative - and surely they must - then reconciliation and male bonding can be seen as the heart of the message of Luke's Gospel. In fact, of the traditional seven last words of Jesus on the cross, three of them are unique to Luke. The fact would suggest that Luke gives some special weight to these three climactic utterances, that they will provide a final insight into the author's themes. Luke is the only New Testament writer who records the words of Jesus to the thief who declares him to be innocent: "Today you shall be with me in Paradise" (Luke 23.43), recalling Lazarus in Paradise in the bosom of Abraham. In the second addition, he asks for his Father's forgiveness of his executioners "for they know not what they do" (Luke 23.34). Both statements are thematically similar to the three uniquely Lucan parables in their embracings and reconcilings, confirming a major theme of this Gospel.</page><page sequence="14">194 SOUNDINGS William H. Shun The third of the last sayings of Jesus record his final union with the Father, with a poignant physical detail: "Father, into Thy hands I commit my spirit" (Luke 23.46). Luke deliberately changes the singular "hand" of his original (Psalm 31.5) to a plu- ral, thus increasing the anthropomorphism, the physicality of the Divine embrace. Matthew's Jesus dies alone and in despair. Only in Luke does the dying Jesus imagine being received into the hands of God - into the male-male embrace of God - a vision that enables him to endure the torture of his death. One might die joyfully if he knew the Hands of God were there to receive his spirit. Such physicality linked with transcendence is in fact a hallmark of Luke. In the other synoptic Gospels, immortal flesh does not touch mortal flesh. Considered from the point of view of gender and sexuality, these several differences demonstrate a startling coherence and contribute to a distinct profile of the author and his interests. V. Conclusion Recent methods of reading - some of them recorded in the following bibliography - have suggested that a more focused look at issues of gender and sexuality can open texts to a larger range of meaning. Such a reading suggests that Luke's is a unique and original version of the materials he inherited. The first discovery is richly metaphysical: Luke's prefatory tab- leaux concerning fertility and sexual behavior, and their relation to the entry of the Divine into human affairs. All manner of sex- ual relationships surround the conception of divinity in a human body. Luke's theology pushes far beyond the usual privileging of heterosexual behavior into the mystery of Divine creativity which transcends what would become in other societies a "normal" un- derstanding of sexuality. Thus oriented, a reader can pick up the highly charged nu- ances that characterize the teachings of the Messiah through a series of symposium-like meals, which are charged with sexual and generative materials. Luke has Plato in mind as a model in two different ways: for describing the death of the saintly intellec- tual and spiritual leader and for the importance of the Sympo- sium meal as the forum for discussing metaphysical truths. He moulds a new figure from the provincial Jewish Messiah of Mat-</page><page sequence="15">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 1 95 thew and Mark. He creates a heightened figure of Socratic wis- dom and authority, accessible to a more secular Graeco-Roman readership. Next, several unique passages, especially the uniquely Lucan parables, present vivid images of male bonding and reconcilia- tion, furnishing a dramatic climax at many points in the Gospel through the trope of the ecstatic male-male embrace. It is a ges- ture that, in the writing of Luke, creates a bridge between flesh and spirit, between human love and Divine. It is also a gesture richly symbolic of salvation, reconciliation, and Divine joy. And there are, as well, more incidental features of the Gospel uncovered by this methodology: a sharper focusing of the impor- tance of the all-male Symposium behind Luke's meals and a ra- tionale for several of Luke's unique additions to his sources. Like every work of art, Luke's Gospel has highlights and shad- ings, dramatic centers, a climactic narrative structure, various methods of thematic development, figurative language, and sym- bolic heightening, all of which carry the distinctive signature of the author's personal vision. Christianity issues from his pen as something larger and more universal than earlier writers had sensed it to be, as a rich and spiritual religion fit for the sensibili- ties of a secular Hellenistic world beyond the Temple and Synagog.11 NOTES Let me record here my indebtedness to several careful readers who, while not always sharing my point of view or my conclusions, have generously contributed their learning and their critical abilities; I thank especially Father John Kilgal- len, S.J., Father Ed Ingebretsen, S.J., Father Vernon Ruland, S.J., Professors Jack Miles, Bart Ehrman, James Brown, Donald Lauria, Raymond-Jean Frontain, and Kenneth Reckford. It is also a pleasure to record my respect for Father Joseph Fitzmyer, SJ., one of my earliest professors in this field; his edition of Luke is a resource I lean on heavily. Thanks also to those who taught me the languages and the methods of biblical criticism. I am grateful to some of the authors listed in the bibliography below for sensitizing me to issues of gender and social con- struction in reading. I don't believe that there is any need to decide, for the purposes of this essay, the identity of "Luke" or the actual dating of his text, though I find Burton J. Mack's 110-120 CE dating to be interesting and productive. I have treated "Luke" as an individual because of the coherence of his themes and interests in the works that come to us with his name attached. This does not</page><page sequence="16">196 SOUNDINGS William H. Shurr preclude the possibility that he is the final strong-handed redactor of inherited materials. 1. See Matthew 1.18-2.19 for Matthew's account of the Infancy Narrative. Un- less otherwise noted, all scriptural references are to The New Oxford Anno- tated Bible with the Apocrypha. 2. See Luke 1.5-2.52 for Luke's version of the Infancy Narrative. 3. The sources of Matthew's inspiration seem to be Jewish prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, Micah, and Hosea. Luke's, on the other hand, are the secular writers of the larger Graeco-Roman world. He seems to model his two books on journey motifs that go as far back as Homer. "Luke" could easily be excerpted from its context in the New Testament and placed among the Greek and Latin writers who were his exact contemporaries: "Longinus" (early first century CE), for example, who counseled in his trea- tise On the Sublime that the writer's goals were "excellence in language," the "expression of a great spirit" in the writer himself, and the provocation of "ecstasy" in the reader; and Suetonius (second century CE) , who wrote Gos- pel-length biographies of the twelve Caesars; and Plutarch (46P-120? CE), who did not merely record the events in the lives of his subjects but sought out the shape and meaning of those lives and made up appropriate speeches for his subjects. If, as I believe, Luke was writing for a "pagan" audience, using their tradi- tions, he would be aware that Vergil and Horace - and others - also boasted of famous patrons, as he does at the beginning of each of his works. Bart Ehrman, in the work listed below, frequently reminds the reader that the Hellenistic context is important for all of the writings of the New Testament. 4. See the story of the Prodigal Son at Luke 15.11-31, the Good Samaritan at Luke 10.25-37, and Lazarus at Luke 16.19-31. 5. Luke's unique treatment of the city of Samaria provides another illustration of his Hellenistic orientation (as opposed to the strictly Jewish backgrounds of the other New Testament writers). This city to the north of Jerusalem had been built and rebuilt many times from the time of Alexander. Most recently, in 30 BCE, Herod the Great had rebuilt it as a lavish Hellenistic city surrounded by two miles of walls with several watch towers and fortified gates. He embellished the city with a copious water supply, lavish baths, gymnasia, a theater, and fine public buildings. In the center he had erected a temple and an altar in honor of the Emperor Augustus and renamed the city after him. The demonized Herod who slaughters innocents is a figure only in Matthew's Gospel, not in Luke's. But as if a second, almost superimposed city existed, Samaria was also the centuries-old center of a conservative form of Yahweh worship, so extreme that the citizens were considered a heretical break-away sect by the ortho- doxy in Jerusalem (see Grant, 108ff). It was this "double" city which Luke knew and admired: for its piety, he awarded it the honor of being the Good Samaritan's native city and the home of the only one of the lepers who bothered to thank Jesus for his cure. It is worth noting that there are three places in his Gospel where he goes out of his way (and apart from the other writers) to praise the Helle- nist city of Samaria and contrast it with the orthodox Jerusalem (9.52-3; 10.33-36; 17.15-18). For its connections with the larger world of the Empire, it was - according to Acts 8 - the first place where the new Christianity was preached once it began to move out from its place of origin. For Luke, "Samaria" is at once more intensely devout in its orthodox Judaism and</page><page sequence="17">Society and Gender in the Gospel of St. Luke 197 more hellenistically cosmopolitan than its neighbor Jerusalem - it is a wor- thy site for Christianity's first step from minor Jewish heresy to world religion. 6. Luke discusses the meals in the following sections: 5.27-39; 7.36-50; 9.10-17; 10.38-42: 11.37-54: 14.1-24: 22.7-38: 24.13-35: 24.36-50. 7. See the relevant passages in The Greek New Testament. 8. Only in Luke are tax-collectors prominent and treated well. It is speculative but possible that the author of the Gospel of Luke was a Greek slave in the employ of an official high in the Roman tax bureaucracy. The relationship may be mirrored obscurely in Luke 7.1-10. Luke addresses his patron as 'Your excellency" at the beginning of the Gospel and of Acts. The word is reserved for such high Roman dignitaries in Acts 23.26, 24.3, and 26.25. 9. Luke is a writer with a kind of "global" consciousness, aware that he is living near the center of the world (see note 11 for more on Luke's connections with Rome). He lives in the administrative center of the vast territories con- quered by Alexander and only recently re-conquered by the Romans, who left the Greek moral codes, institutions, and mentalities pretty much in place. In at least four places Luke brings the life of Jesus into world history, that is into the chronological framework of the Augustan age. Luke's was the world of the gymnasium, the baths, the symposium, rather than the temple, the Sabbath, the rabbinical dispute. The other writers of the New Testament would have called him a pagan. The attitude of the rabbis from a time somewhat later than Jesus is quoted by Fitzmyer: "Cursed be the man who teaches his son Greek wisdom" (1088) - exactly what Luke brought to his inherited materials on the life of Jesus. 10. See other accounts of the Last Supper at Matt. 26.7-19, Mark 14.12-16, and John 13-17. 11. I find some confirmation of this shift in what seems to me to be Luke's treatment of Paul. Paul's sermon's, as Luke reports them in Acts, have none of the heavily theologized attempts to understand Jesus in terms of Jewish theology that are found in the Epistles. Not only does Luke omit Paul's rabbinical style of argumentation about the Law and its interpretation, but so also does he omit the complex christology of Paul's letters, as well as Paul's tangled theology concerning the place of Faith in the economy of salvation and the relation of the new Christian to the old Law. Missing from the Paul portrayed by Luke in Acts are Paul's tormented wrestling with sex- ual issues (see, for example, 2 Cor. 12.7-8). Luke's Paul preaches a simpler belief in the resurrection of the body and the notion that Christianity ("the Way") has grown out of the traditions of the great prophetic figures of Israel. As I read Acts, it seems to me that Luke appears to be praising Paul as one of the great founders of Christianity, while at the same time removing some of the theology which for some reason Luke found difficult or of limited appeal. I take it that the Pauline epistles had not yet been collected or "canonized," and so Luke was trying to re-establish the foundations of the Church on grounds that he feels are more compatible with the Helle- nistic Roman world in which he would like to see the Church flourish. The ending of Acts has a very "Roman" feeling, as if the new religion has achieved a kind of centrality and universality in the larger world of the Hel- lenist Roman empire. If, as legend had it, Paul had been murdered by the Romans (an event which surely would have already happened by the time "Luke" was written) then Luke passes over it in silence. At the end of Acts, Paul seems to be in comfortable semi-retirement, apparently exonerated,</page><page sequence="18">198 SOUNDINGS William H. Shurr even financially self-sufficient at this point in his life, living and teaching contentedly in Rome. Luke seems to describe an age that was a kind of pax romana for the Christian church - or at least he seems to have wanted to create that effect in his writings. If Luke's Gospel leads to a climax in the religious center of Judaism, then Acts brings the action forward to climax in the center of the empire. SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY Boswell,John.
