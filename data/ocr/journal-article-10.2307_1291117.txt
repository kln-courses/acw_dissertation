Gregory of Nyssa is the only one among the Cappadocian Fathers who wrote a systematic anthropological treatise: his book, IIEpL KaTa0rKEV~p avOpco'rrov, De hominis opificio, On the Making of Man.' The depth and eloquence of this work make the Bishop of Nyssa the natural center of any account of Cappadocian anthropology. In De hominis opificio ancient philosophical elements are more prom- inent than in Gregory of Nyssa's other writings. Even here they are sub- ordinate to the biblical image doctrine; but in some of his more explicitly mystical treatises the Bishop of Nyssa reaches a still higher spiritual level, hardly ever surpassed by later Christian mystics, whose indebtedness to him has been fully recognized only in recent years.2 The scope of this 'Migne, Patrologia Graeca (hereafter PG) XLIV, 124D ff.

LADNER paper does not permit me to go far beyond that more philosophical anthro- pology 3 which appears particularly in De hominis opificio, to some extent also in Gregory of Nyssa's other works such as De anima et resurrectione 4 and Oratio catechetica,5 and similarly, though less clearly, in the writings of the other great Cappadocians, St. Basil and St. Gregory of Nazianzus. To all of them, of course, and to Gregory of Nyssa especially, philosophical and mystical anthropology really form one whole: philosophy to them is only a way of approach toward union with God, though an indispensable and an exalted way. In trying to penetrate to the vital core of Gregory of Nyssa's anthro- pology, one is necessarily led to a question which in various forms underlies much of the saint's philosophical speculations: why, if man was created according to the image and likeness of God and at the same time was made a spiritual-corporeal compound, should his God-given bodily condition be an occasion for so much suffering and evil? The relationship of the material body to the immortal spirit and the position of the soul and mind between the two were among the principal problems of Gregory of Nyssa's philosophical anthropology, if not the principal ones.6 Gregory was conscious of the excellence and dignity not only of the human mind, but also of the human body, for he saw both as creatures of God.' He had as a twofold spiritual inheritance the Pauline conception of human bodies as temples of God and members of Christ, and the millennial Greek effort to achieve kalokagathia, to attain the right balance between physical and mental perfection. Yet to explain the ircaWq of the body, which are both passions and sufferings, he could no longer be content merely with pursuit of the origins of certain mediaeval ideas, I wish to emphasize my great debt to the works mentioned and to the other studies quoted in this paper. ' Certain aspects of Gregory's mystical anthropology, contained, for instance, in De vita Mosis and in the homilies In Cantica canticorum and De beatitudinibus, were explained by Professor Werner Jaeger in his two lectures at the 1956 Dumbarton Oaks Symposium. For the rest, see the literature quoted in the preceding note. "PG XLVI, 12A ff. 'Ed. J. H. Srawley, The Catechetical Oration of Gregory of Nyssa (Cambridge Patristic Texts, Cambridge, 1903); also PG XLV, 9A ff. 'This was recognized by H. Cherniss in a study - The Platonism of Gregory of Nyssa (University of California Publications in Classical Philology XI, 1, Berkeley, 1930, hereafter Cherniss, Platonism) - which is of great significance not only where it makes positive con- tributions to the understanding of the anthropology of the Bishop of Nyssa, but also where Cherniss' criticism of Gregory's thought and character invites counter-criticism. I hope to show toward the end of this paper that the Gregorian doctrines which Professor Cherniss criticizes are indeed crucial, but crucial in the sense that without them Gregory's anthro- pology would be incomplete.

Like other late Platonists, Origen had cut through the delicate weave of man's composite nature; if he did not as a Christian, to whom the Incarnation of the Son of God was essential, consider the body the source of evil, he nevertheless assumed that corporeal life was only a punitive, pedagogical, and re- demptive consequence of creatures' lapse from pure spirituality."' It will be seen later that Gregory of Nyssa in this respect did not pursue Origen's way of thinking to its logical end. A higher logic, that of the excellence of all of God's creation, forbade his eliminating altogether the corporeal mode of existence from the beginnings of the world and of man. As to the relationship of Gregory's anthropology to that of the Greek Fathers in general, it is important to note that he did not distinguish, as most of them had done and were to do, between the terms and concepts ELKWV (image) and 6zLoicor-L (likeness) in the account of man's creation by God according to Genesis 1:26: "Let us make man to our image and likeness."

LADNER fully existent already in the creational eikon, though it must be regained after man's loss of it through original sin. Gregory could therefore, use the words "image" and "likeness" interchangeably, and use the static terms 6ptoitopa (that which is alike) or 6oLtorrTo (being alike) beside the more dy- namic term 60.oikooL (which means both becoming alike and likeness). Clearly, he considers man's creational resemblance to God as the foundation by divine grace of all human and divinely assisted efforts to become similar to Him again. Dom Hubert Merki in his study 'OMOIfloII OEMI has firmly estab- lished the equivalence of the Gregorian terms eikon and homoiosis, both in the creation and in the reformation of man. Gregory is the first of the Fathers to attribute to man full 6Otoio-w s OEE not only at the end, but at the beginning of his history."2 For the rest, similarity, even more than the image, is the dominant rela- tion which links man to God in all Greek patristic thought with the obvious exception of Athanasius.'3 This emphasis on homoiosis - similarity, re- See, for instance, De virginitate, ed.

Merki, however, was not aware of the fact that the two homilies which go under the name of St. Basil and under the title De structura hominis (PG XXX, 9 ff.) constitute a longer and modified version of those entitled In verba: Faciamus . . . and attributed to Gregory of Nyssa; cf. the article of Giet, quoted in the pre- ceding note, 317 ff., D.

Danielou believe that the shorter recension of the homilies (i.e., In verba: Faciamus . . .) is based on notes taken after homilies given by Basil. - In general, see, for in- stance, R. McL.

R. Bernard, L'image de Dieu d'apres Saint Athanase (Theologie XXV, Paris, 1952), 27 ff. The altogether infrequent use of the term and concept of homoiosis in Athanasius' anthropology - cf.

Greek early Christian Platonists did not altogether give up the Platonic conception of an image as something inferior or second best if compared to its arche- type, the one great exception being, of course, the equal image of God in Christ. The dialectics of like and unlike on the other hand, as it appears in Plato's late dialogues, must have been congenial to Christian thinkers who desired to make use of Platonic formulations in order to illustrate the closest possible relationship between the creature man and the creator God. For it had been one of the main concerns of Platonism to show that, while it is impossible for man to speak of like without unlike, of same without other, of one without many, of being without non-being, this fact does not destroy the positive meaning of a concept such as likeness."4 One Platonic text above all was of the greatest assistance in this respect to Greek patristic theological anthropology; it is the famous sentence from the Theatetus: "Wherefore we ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible . . ." (. .. 6p`oikco-1 OE Kara rT 8vvar'dv).15 Clement of Alexan- dria and Origen used this text."' Gregory of Nyssa no doubt knew it and, as Merki has shown to be probable, Gregory also utilized Plotinus' version." In Gregory's thinking at any rate Platonic assimilation to God was fully absorbed into the scriptural doctrine of man's creation and reformation according to the image of God: eikon and homoiosis were one and the same thing, in the sense that biblical-Platonic homoiosis was the content of the creational as well as of the redeemed and restored eikon. This doctrine of image-likeness is of interest not only because it has a bear- ing on the more mystical aspects of Gregory's anthropology, but also be- the consubstantiality (the 4toov'/Loq) of the Son with the Father, and on the other hand opposed the pretension of any essential resemblance between God and man; cf. Bernard, op. cit., 114 ff. and 29. " For Plato see, especially, Parmenides 132D and 148, Sophist 259. Cf. La Touche Godfrey, "Plato's Doctrine of Participation," Hermathena LXIII (1944), 4; J.

LADNER cause it forms the basis for his more philosophical considerations in De hominis opificio. This principal anthropological treatise of the Bishop of Nyssa is not a work of biblical exegesis in the strict sense, but rather a logos, as Gregory himself calls it,'8 a discourse in the vein of Origen's De principiis or Philo's De opificio mundi. The relation to Philo's work is in fact quite close, as will be seen. The very plan of De hominis opificio proves that the apparent antinomy between man's perfect creational image-likeness to God and his partly corporeal nature really is a central problem of Gregory of Nyssa's anthro- pology. For, in the first part of the book,19 he beautifully praises man's creation according to God's image, showing that man's physical nature is only a reflection of his spiritual resemblance to God; then, halfway through the treatise, he rather suddenly contrasts man's high origin with his present misery, as apparent in the deficiencies of his corporeal condition; to the explanation of this contrast most of the remainder of the work is dedicated.20" Though this second part, which deals with the loss and the restoration in the Christian dispensation of man's image-likeness to God, contains Gregory's most original contributions to Christian philosophical anthropology, the first part lays the indispensable foundations. It describes and defines the image-likeness on the creational level, including the instrumental or tele- ological relationship of man's body to his mind, and then probes more deeply into this relationship by investigating the threefold nature of the soul and its temporal and spatial unity. In the two opening chapters of the De hominis opificio, the reader is given a picture of the beauty of non-human nature which waits for its master, man.21 Then, with the creation of man, something altogether new and different begins. This is indicated according to Gregory by the de- liberative announcement made by God before he created man: "Let us make man to our image and likeness." 22 Here God does not only say: P ev78r0To, Fiat, "Let there be," but in view of the importance of the event, He takes counsel with Himself. The plural, "Let us make," Gregory interprets according to an old patristic tradition as * In dedicating the work to his brother Peter Gregory says: Tob Si 86 pov Xoyo ai T . . .

"The Godhead," he says, "is Mind (Noi3i) and Word (A6yog), so also in yourself you see word or speech (rwv Xoyov) and intellect or thought (8tcvotav), an imitation of Him who is truly Mind and Word." 24 There can be no similarity between divine simplicity and the multi- plicity of human sense perception,25 man is like God through similitude to aspects of God's spiritual life in which he can participate, such as purity (KaOap`6r), freedom from passions (&amp;r-rWELa), bliss (,uaKapLd7orr), separa- tion from all evil (KaKoD ircvro~ aXXorpltoo-tq), love (ayarTrr).26 Man's virtues thus correspond to God's attributes. As a whole, man is an image of the majesty of God, because he, too, is a king; and he is a king because of the superiority of his soul, which possesses free will, over all other animated beings. Because through his soul man rules himself, he has rulership also over the rest of creation.27 And yet, Gregory of Nyssa tells us that the best artificer made our nature fit for the exercise of rulership not only through our soul, but even through the organization of our body.28 This does not mean that Gregory has in any way an anthropomorphic concept of God or that he retracts from his spiritual conception of the divine image-likeness in man. The relation of body to mind is in his view a teleological one. In this connection he explains man's apparent inferiority at birth as compared to the animals: " De hornm. op. 6, loc. cit., 140B f.

It is rather characteristic of the Cappadocians, in fact of Greek patristic image doctrine in general, to take the metaphor of an art image's resem- blance to its model very seriously, and always to return to royal imagery. Gregory of Nyssa, for instance, treats the virtues that make man similar to God as so many colors and icono- graphical attributes of a king's portrait which, as it were, constitute the effigy.

For the body's share in divine image-likeness consists essentially in man's upright posture which in an ingenious adaptation of Posidonian ideas Gregory of Nyssa links directly to the function of the hands, indirectly to the origin of language, and ultimately to man's entire spiritual life which makes him the master of creation. The Bishop of Nyssa's argument runs thus: Man is upright and his gaze is directed upward to heaven. This symbolizes his royal dignity, his power over the other animalic creatures.32 But there is more: Because man stands erect, he does not need forelegs and could develop hands. Only because he has hands, which besides being put to a thousand other uses can serve for the provision and preparation of food, could his mouth, his lips, his tongue, and the other related parts of his face and throat be shaped for the purpose of the articulation of words rather than for such animalic needs as the tearing of grass from the ground or the tearing apart of raw meat.33 Thus, just be- " De hornm. op. 7, loc. cit., 140D: v.. . 7/v~ Vu TJ V rcfv TtKGV KElTracT/LTW V ao0rXO 7 9S Ka 67 ?rCVJ3 o apvPrrI7r Kalt rTV ?TpOV V'av xpcvEvE-,;a' 7 rVa " rt rov 8'ov wrapayraL, i EdrOaL LaXXov i) FLaKaptEoaL Ka7T aT 6CatXVC/LEVOV atog. 3o De hornm. op. 7, loc. cit., 141B-144A. 1 Cf.

That se- quence of cause and effect which led from man's upright posture via the creation of hands to the eminently spiritual gift of language also brought about the formation of a whole complex of vocal organs, comparable to a combination of lyre and flute, through which his mind can express itself, as a musician on his instrument.3" There is little doubt that in this whole part of De hominis opificio, as in some other physiological metaphors and examples which he uses, Gregory of Nyssa, notwithstanding his general Platonism, was influenced by Stoic thought, in part at least through the Posidonian tradition.35 Yet, his manner of tying the theory of the mind's instrumental use of the body to the doc- trine of spiritual image-likeness is his own; it is not found even in Philo, who was so often his immediate source. Thus, while Philo with reference to the creation of man's body says only that God chose the purest earth to mold the house or temple which was to harbor the reasonable soul,"3 Gregory gives a detailed account of how body and mind cooperate through sense perception, imagination, and conceptualization. This cooperation, however, the effectiveness of the one mind in all the various sense perceptions, is something so mysterious that he can explain it only through the very image- likeness of the mind to God: the nature of the human mind is as incompre- hensible as the essence of God Himself.37 Gregory of Nyssa's reasoning on the body-mind relationship is im- portant, especially because the relatively close bond, which he recognized, between man's mortal body - it, too, a creature of God - and the divine immortal image in the spiritual or rational soul, greatly enhances the dignity aVTW KaO 0/JAJLOT7-Ta TOV TETpawTroSWV Kc1a X V 17 Tfl TV)F TPO4)?

His conception of man's spiritual-material nature was based on two fundamental assumptions, already briefly referred to. These are the threefold nature of the soul in its relationship to matter and to spirit and the temporal and spatial unity of the human soul, in which mind and body exist as unified, notwithstanding the great distance which separates them in the hierarchy of values. In Gregory of Nyssa's view man contains in himself all previous stages of living creatures. "For," he says "this rational animal, man, is mixed from every idea of soul. He is nourished in accordance with the vegetative species of soul; but, in addition to the [vegetative] faculty of growth, there arose that of sense perception [characteristic of animals], which stands in the middle between the proper natures of the intellectual and the more material nature. . . ; then there takes place a certain appropriation as well as a blending of the intellectual essence to the fine and luminous part of the sensible nature, so that man is con- stituted by all three [souls]. .. ." 38 This threefold classification of souls is ultimately derived from Aris- totle.39 Gregory does not integrate it with the Platonic three soul parts, the appetitive, the irascible, and the rational,4 which he took over elsewhere in different contexts.4" He does, however, relate the three soul forms of De hominis opificio to the Pauline concepts of body, soul, and spirit,42 so that man's body corresponds to the life of the plants, man's soul to animal life, De hom. op. 8, loc. cit., 145C: Ah rdauq3 yap 183a r Ov qvXcV KaTaKpvraL Trb tXoyLKv TOVTO ~OOV 0o6 avOpOro)O.

" More than forty years ago, it was shown by W. Jaeger in his path-finding book on Nemesius of Emesa,45 and later also by Karl Reinhardt,46 that the conception of a universe ascending in steps from inanimate nature through the various forms of life to God corresponds to the Posidonian version of Stoic monism and pantheism." In Gregory of Nyssa as well as in Nemesius this conception blends with the Platonistic syndesmos-doctrine of man as a link ( Eo-pxr), as an in-between (lpE'tpog) between the animalic and the divine.48 The latter doctrine is found also in Gregory Nazianzen who " De hom. op. 8, loc. cit., 145C: . ..

He opposes only that version of it that, following Apollinaris of Laodicea, holds it possible to separate the rational from the irrational part of the soul (cf. Ad- versus Apollinarem 8, loc. cit., 1140A f.) and to dissolve the unity between mind, soul, and body (Adv. Apollin. 46, loc. cit., 1236B). For Apollinaris of Laodicea see 0.

LADNER speaks of God as tying together earth and spirit in man, who thus becomes a mean between greatness and lowness.4" But here again the great Cap- padocians successfully transformed ancient theorems in a Christian sense. Gregory of Nyssa, especially, not only applied, in his ascetical works, the bathmos-concept to man's mystical ascent to God,50 but, as a philosopher, achieved also a real synthesis between the Posidonian-Neoplatonic view of cosmical order and the Christian doctrine of creation ex nihilo. This syn- thesis is both cosmological and anthropological, and incidentally is of some interest for the question of possible patristic anticipations of biological evolution doctrine." In his Homilies on the Hexaemeron, that is, on the six-day-work of creation, sermons which were intended to defend and to supplement St. Basil's work on the Hexaemeron, Gregory had already interpreted the six days not literally, but had spoken of simultaneous creation.52 The concep- tion of creation as simultaneous he probably took over from Philo."3 Yet Gregory differed from Philo in one important respect. For Philo simul- taneous creation had occurred both ideally in the mind of God and actually in the making of the sensible universe after the ideal pattern. The Genesis- account of God's six-day-work, according to Philo, first describes ideal creation, which is called the first day, and then actual, sensible, or corporeal, creation to which the other five days correspond. Nevertheless, it was in one creational instant that all the works of God made their appearance. The six days only indicate a perfect logical order which adumbrates the post-creational growth of all living beings from matter to seed and fruit.54" For other Philonian tests cf. Jaeger, Nemesios, 140 f., and Reinhardt, article "Poseidonios," in PW, RE XLIII, 773 ff. In spite of Reinhardt's contradiction the syndesmos-doctrine, too, seems to be of Posidonian origin, and, together with other Posidonian and Philonian ideas, seems to have been transmitted to the Cappadocians and to Nemesius through Origen's lost com- mentary to Genesis; cf.

Contrary to Philo, he dis- tinguished between an only potential or virtual existence of all things when they were simultaneously created, and their actual successive or temporal emergence. This seems to be the earliest clear occurrence in hexameral literature of the idea of a "seminal power" or "reason," 56 which Gregory, and later Augustine, could find in ancient philosophy."7 In De hominis lrl oa, &amp;~rLKdvtuia, of the intelligible archetype) see ibid., 10(36 ff.), ed.

It is through his theory of the simultaneous creation and successive appearance of the three kinds of souls and of the bodies appertaining to them - the nutritive soul corresponding to plants, the sensitive soul to animals, the rational soul to man - that Gregory of Nyssa is able to preserve the unity between the material and the spiritual part of man: it would be as wrong to assume that in man these three souls exist in a mixture of distinct entities 58 as it would be to believe that man's body and soul, even Adam's did not make their appearance together." We must imagine Adam's actual appearance in body and mind as a terminal event, comparable to the emergence of the perfected rational state in every post-Adamitic man after a long development from the embryonic to the mature stage.60 Only the rational soul is the full and true soul created as such in the beginning, but not immediately apparent; 61 in order to become what it really is, it must traverse the logically earlier stages of the plant-like and animal-like souls; 62 therefore, in the Genesis-account of timeless creation, plants and animals are mentioned before man."6 Just as every man's soul was made virtually or potentially in the original instant of creation, so was his body, but the actual union between the human soul and body took and takes place anew in every individual case.

Gregory of Nyssa's elaboration of the doctrine of a o-irEpFrTtK-K 8~nvpq enables him to explain how spirit and body in spite of their very unequal relationship to God can and must coexist in man. He thus overcomes the radically dualistic doctrines of the pre-existence of souls and of metempsy- chosis, which he rejects explicitly."6 At the same time in clearly stating the created character of the seminal power as a "natural principle" (~rv'ENc X/yog), ordained by God, he maintains a moderate Christian dualism against the Heraclitan-Stoic-Posidonian conception of universal sympathy in a graded cosmos lacking true distinction between God and man. The human soul is neither forever material as well as divine, as it is for the Stoics, nor is it originally created purely spiritual and divine as for the Platonists. It is rather the vital link, the true syndesmos, between matter and spirit from the beginning. The explication in time of the timeless moment of creation proceeds from matter to spirit through the soul of man, 14 That this union took place at the moment referred to in Genesis 2:7 is implied in De hom. op. 28, loc. cit., 229C, and 29, loc cit., 233D. SDe hornm. op. 27, loc. cit., 229A. ' What is the relation of Gregory of Nyssa's development of the concept of "seminal powers" in the frame of a Christian doctrine of creation to philosophical and theological in- terpretations of biological evolution? His and St. Augustine's slightly different views have often been adduced by those who have tried to reconcile evolutionist theory and Christian theology. Cf., for instance, J. A. Zahm, C.S.C., Evolution and Dogma (Chicago, 1896); H. de Dorlodot, Le darwinisme au point de vue de l'orthodoxie catholique (Brussels, Paris, 1921); E. C. Messenger, Evolution and Theology (New York, 1932). Yet, it has been rightly objected that the seminal powers or reasons are principles of fixity rather than of evolution. Cf., especially, Meyer, Keimkriifte, 184 ff.; L. Rebecchi, "L'antropologia naturale di San Gregorio Nisseno," Divus Thomas XLVI (Piacenza, 1943), esp. 309 ff.; C. Boyer, S.J., "La theorie augustinienne des raisons seminales," Miscellanea Agostiniana II (1931), 795 ff.; J. O'Toole, C.S.C., The Philosophy of Creation in the Writings of St. Augustine (Washington, D.C., 1944). So, for instance, Gregory of Nyssa considers man's soul and body as logically and "historically" posterior to the bodies and souls of animals, but he never thought of interpreting the shaping of man from earth according to Genesis 2:7 as a metaphor for the descent of man's body, much less of his soul, from those of animals. With regard to the human body it may nevertheless be possible to prolong Gregory's and Augustine's thinking along the lines of evolutionist thought. Under the impact of the facts ascertained by modem genetics, and especially by the study of heredity and mutation, some modifications of Darwin's theory of evolution do come rather close to the Gregorian and Augustinian conceptions of the origin and history of life in general. If it is assumed that the origin of new species cannot be explained by natural selection alone, but presupposes unpredictable mutations, such a view seems less incompatible with patristic ideas on "seminal reasons," which combine creational origin and evolutionary novelty of species. Any newly emergent species could then be conceived as novel, not with regard to God's original plan, but with regard to actual appearance in time and as compared to previous species. 6 Cf.

LADNER just as in every human being all its corporeal and intellectual potentialities are virtually present in germ-like fashion from the beginning of its existence. His interrelated doctrines of a threefold soul and of simultaneously created, but temporally unfolding, seminal power assist Gregory of Nyssa in the explanation of the problematic doubleness of man as body and man as spirit. His assertion of the ubiquitousness of the mind as against its localization in any particular part of the body serves a similar purpose. And here again the solution of the psychosomatic problem is based on the close relationship between God and man, which, nevertheless, includes infinite distance between the Creator and the created. Just as the spiritual and the corporeal part of man form a unity in time because they were both poten- tially created in the simultaneous eternal order of God's creation, so the rational soul ubiquitously pervades the whole body rather than dwells in any of its parts, be it even the most noble parts such as the brain or the heart."6 For, made according to the image of a God who cannot be circum- scribed, the human mind cannot be restricted in space. Neither is it in the body, nor is the body in it, as Plotinus had taught. It joins the body from the outside in a mysterious way, and vivifies and rules it in its entirety."6 As was seen before, the mind's and soul's image-likeness to God consists in part in its mysterious relationship to the body. The very fact that man cannot really circumscribe and comprehend his own mind shows that it is similar to God. Yet, how far removed is man from God in whom being is knowing and willing Himself,70 as well as knowledge and love of the world. Gregory admits that the senses affect the mind through the brain," that the mind can become deranged through physical illness and dulled by somatic conditions,72 that dreams are often caused by physical circum- stances.73 But when the normal relationship between body and mind is not severed temporarily as in sleep, or disturbed by illness or passion, the life of man, though it cannot exist without the material body, is ruled by the rational soul.74 The mind is made according to the image of God and reflects Him as a mirror; so also the physical part of man is made beautiful by " De hornm. op. 12, loc. cit., 156C ff.

All three great Cappadocians felt these realities profoundly. Perhaps one may say that Gregory of Nazianzus, poet that he was, transcended them in the inspired lyrical expression of his faith; 77 but only his friend and namesake of Nyssa tried to probe and span the depth of these problems systematically, philosophically as well as mysti- cally. As to St. Basil, his attitude toward the imperfections and transitoriness of terrestrial human life was harsher, his anthropology more severe, than that of the two Gregories. Dom Amand, in his book L'ascese monastique de Saint Basile, has shown very well how uncompromisingly Basil combined an ultra-spiritual Platonist conception of the psychosomatic relationship with the Pauline teaching on the sinfulness of the flesh.78 Yet, the difference between his thought and that of the two other great Cappadocians was perhaps not really as great as it may seem. He was rather the active legis- lator of the very way of life which was their common ideal. His younger brother of Nyssa was its great theoretician. His friend of Nazianzus em- braced both wrpa"t and IOopla, but in a very personal way, which was neither that of the hierarch Basil nor that of Gregory of Nyssa, who, though a mystic, was also a systematic thinker. It must be realized, of course, that the practical or active bent of Basil's anthropological thinking was funda- mentally ascetic; that is to say, Trpa&amp;~L meant for him not practical life in the modern sense, but training in virtue as a preparation for OEplia, the vision of God.7" Yet, the practical exigencies of Basil's monastic legislation " De hom. op. 12, loc. cit., 161C f.: "'f2rrnE 8' E'OaceEv rT? ,oo '(ELT 70r rpTOTV7orVOV Ka/LNovg KaCraKo7LEUTdOaC TO VOVV OLv o 7v t Ka70ro7rpov 7 XapaK7rptL 70o) qll palVoEVoov z0opOdpoV/LEov, KaTa 7Tv aVT-qVa 0vakoylat cKaU TOV OtKOVOLOVLooEV-qV VE aVTr o V pvoiv EXETOcLL O701)T VOVX- yCOEOa KEL T9 lracpaKctq.uV9 KaLXEL Kat av"TV Ko.Y/LEato-aL OLOV TL KtaTO7rTpOV KLTO7TTPOV XLVOLE'VV KpaTdELOaL E Vf TaTT719P Ka' mvEX, OarTO\ VXLKOV T- rV'OUTdaTEoro7Epl ?VV OEopEtTrat y7 fvuai.

LADNER and of his special responsibilities in the eastern Church, perhaps as much as his personality, prevented him from attaining the anthropological syn- thesis which his younger brother achieved. Basil's doctrine of man not only rejected what he characteristically called rroXvo-apKia and EiJXpoLa, the full- bodiedness and good color of a physically perfect athlete,"s but also postu- lated that the demands and even the existence of the body be acknowledged only when absolutely necessary.81 In spite of its admitted excellence 82 as a vehicle of the soul,s" the body remains simply a shackle, a prison."4 These views of Basil's are relatively narrow when compared with his brother's great attempt to explain why and how man's body is at one and the same time a wonderful creature of God and an occasion for evil. Even the brief suggestions concerning Gregory Nazianzen and Basil, to which I must here limit myself, are, perhaps, sufficient to show that Cappadocian anthropology indeed reaches its fullness only in Gregory of Nyssa. Given the problematics of passion, suffering, and death, it is not an accident that a whole section of his De hominis opificio, which forms the transition from the first to the second part of the treatise,85 and again a final section, which deals with the body-mind relationship in view of the resur- rection of the bodies,"8 are replete with physiological and pathological lore. This material is largely taken from Galen or derived from the Galenian tradition as Reinhardt, Janini Cuesta, and Peres Laplace and Danidlou have, independently, shown."87 These medical chapters are, however, by no means a mere display of adventitious knowledge; they lead directly to the central problem of the evils of the body.

What he says here is far from mere rhetoric. The tone is sincere, as it is also in similar passages in the Oratio catechetica and in De anima et resurrectione, and in some of Gregory Nazianzen's great poems, such as De natura hominis89 and De animae suae calamitatibus.90 While the first part of Gregory of Nyssa's book On the Making of Man was concerned with the essence, so to speak, of man's image-likeness to God, which consists primarily in spirit and mediately in his whole being, the second part deals with the image's pre-existential, existential, and supra-existential destinies; one might almost say with its history, which is a tragedy if considered in the time dimension and, nevertheless, a Dantesque Divina Comoedia when its beginning and end are considered. "What then," Gregory asks in chapter 16 of De hominis opificio, "is the meaning of the image? Probably you will say: How can the in- corporeal be assimilated to the body, how to the eternal the time- bound, to the immutable that which becomes different by change, to the passionless and immortal the suffering and corruptible, to that which lacks all evil that which constantly dwells with evil and feeds on it. . . ? If the image has resemblance to the original, it is prop- erly called thus; but if the imitation is perverted from its subject, then the thing is something else and not its image. How then is man, this mortal and passionate and shortlived being, an image of the un- mixed and pure and ever-being nature?" 9' Death, of course, in itself seems to be the worst negation of God-likeness. In his Catechetical Oration Gregory puts himself into the position of a man who, regarding only the dissolution of the body, finds it greatly disturbing, and holds it to be the extremity of evil that our being should be quenched by this condition of mortality.92 Similarly, in his treatise On the Soul and the Resurrection, which has the form of a dialogue with his dying sister Macrina shortly after the death of their brother, the great Basil, he begins " Gregory Nazianzen, Carmina moralia XIV, De humana natura, PG XXXVII, 755 ff.

LADNER with a vivid description of the common deep-seated abhorrence of death and of all men's instinct and contrivance to avoid it.93 This according to Gregory is the dilemma: On the one hand, the divine word does not lie when it says that man was made according to the image of God. On the other hand, there is no likeness between the misery of human life and the bliss of the impassible life of God. If we compare God and man, it seems that we must necessarily either make God passible or man impassible."9 Is there any way out of this impasse? "Let us then," Gregory says, "take up Holy Scripture itself, to see if through that which is written there we might be led to what we are seeking." 9 And Scripture does hold an answer for Gregory, as it did for Philo, whom the Bishop of Nyssa here again follows and modifies. This answer lies in the double account of creation in the book of Genesis and in a doctrine of double creation built upon the scriptural foundation. Philo in De opificio mundi states that there is a vast difference between the man formed from earth according to the first part of verse 7 of Genesis 2 91 and the man after the image of God according to Genesis 1:26.97 Philo also identifies the meanings of the first part of Genesis 2:7 and the last part of Genesis 1:27; 98 for he says that the man formed from earth is also the one who is male or female, according to Genesis 1:27.99 He furthermore identifies Genesis 1:26 and the second part of Genesis 2:7; 100 for he says that man was made an a7TECKOVtL0LCa KacL p-ILCa, a copy and imitation of the 8 De anima et resurrectione, PG XLVI, 13A: II r E"7rv, rov, iv avOpwo`ro3 70o70 (i.e., re- straint from sadness about our mortal condition) KaropowlGvaI oVTW &amp; iv EKacoT OVatKO0 rLvo3 7rpO TOv Odlvarov , 8tao3poX V rapxoVo" Kat OV'TE TO)V OypVWVTrOy ro7v roOV7 KOVTL EvKA KaTasEXOLIEVW T)V 8EaV OL Ev o 7rpoU- 0 O dvaro J dropJeyOvrto E4' 0rov OlOv 1E; . .

The man of Genesis 1:26 then, he who is pure divine image-likeness, is an idea or a generic intelligible and immortal pattern,"' which is itself an "imita- tion" of God or, more exactly, of the Logos, of the word and thought of God.'05 This does not mean for Philo that the ideal man was not real; on the contrary, as a good Platonist he believed the ideal to be more real than the sensible-corporeal. Yet, this ideal man was not created separately within the Hexaemeron; the first actual man, Adam, who had an earthly as well as a heavenly part, was: Genesis 1:26, Genesis 1:27, and Genesis 2:7 represent one identical (non-temporal) moment in the six-day-work of creation. Philo does not tell us why God formed an earthen body for man, a body which is sexually differentiated and mortal. He does not explain why, if God is good, he is also the originator of the corporeal condition of man and of its empirical inferiority to the life of the spirit. But this is the problem which Gregory of Nyssa wants to settle in the same context, and for this purpose he more or less hypothetically,'06 though no doubt with serious intent, advances a doctrine of double creation which significantly differs from that of Philo.

When Holy Scripture says "God created man according to His image and likeness," it does not speak of Adam nor does it mean a mere idea or abstract genus; it has in mind humanity as a whole, a 6boov r' r davOponr6- rvrrog 7r~-Xrpcoa, the fullness of all men to come, who are already present to God's foreseeing power, as if they formed one body.'07 Gregory thus trans- forms Philo's ideal and generic creation of man into a virtual creation of all mankind, a conception which corresponds exactly to his general view of a simultaneous creation unfolding in time. If the creation of man according to Genesis 1:26 included virtually the entire future history of mankind, it is clear that man's creational spirituality must be linked to his eschatological spirituality: this means also that the pleroma of mankind will not be fulfilled until in the resurrection of the bodies man's spiritual soul will have been integrated with a body, which, too, has become spiritualized. Putting aside for the moment the question whether or not Gregory of Nyssa could conceive of a spiritual body of man also in creation, there is no doubt that in his view the body has been bound up ever since Adam's and Eve's original sin with all the potentialities of grossly corporeal passion, in the sense of both suffering and vice. Even though he realizes very clearly that the body cannot be the ultimate cause of evil in the world,108 he con- 107 De hom. op. 16, loc. cit., 185C: . . . o9'ro olal KaCialrEp iv iv' guaT. oJhov TO TrT~ LWepW~TO~T?7T770rX'qpwf~ T 7rP071,q JTLKYVN007 aVCLJLEL 7Crap\ O ?EoVT Jv o"Xwov J7rEptXEEO)VClL KCU i To^To &amp;C'oKEtV' 70v XdyovO 70\v' ETrovVTa O7"t Ka, E ITrot ' - 0OE0 V T pOrov K0LvvOprov Kcti Ka-rKOvac O'OEV E'TrOitr?7oV abrdv.

The empirical body is certainly less spiritual than the rational soul. Through its close connection with the lower, the vegetative, and the animalic parts of the soul it is apt to drag the spirit down to an ever lower material level.109 Of this anti- spiritual tendency in the body, its bisexuality is the principal symptom and symbol though not the full content. Often Gregory simply identifies the sexual organization of man and his corporeal condition, or, more exactly, the constitution of the body after Paradise and before the resurrection. The event related in the last sentence of Genesis 1:27 "male and female he created them," is most closely related in Gregory's mind with the making of man's body in that instant of simultaneous creation when everything was created virtually. Contrary to Philo, he bases his concept of a double crea- tion almost exclusively on Genesis 1:26 and Genesis 1:27; not on Genesis 2:7. This is a very interesting divergence to which it will be necessary to return. The construction of his double creation doctrine around Genesis 1:26 and Genesis 1:27 is a prerequisite for Gregory's rather original solution of his principal anthropological problem; these two verses form the hub around which, for him, the body-mind relationship turns. They define the Archimedian point from which he tries to move the great dilemma between man's spiritual image-likeness to God and his involvement in the irrational tangles of this world. It is best again to turn to his own words: "Thus the making of our nature is in a sense twofold: one made similar to the divine, the other divided according to that difference [between the sexes]. .. ." 110 "How was it that after the making of His image God contrived for His creature the difference according to male and female? . . . He who brought all things into being and formed man as a whole by His own will to the divine image, did not have to wait to see the number of souls perfected to its proper fulness by the gradual additions of those coming after. .. ." (This, of course, still refers to the virtual simultaneous creation of the pleroma of all mankind according to the image of God).1' o" Cf. De horn. op. 18, loc. cit., 193C, and 22, loc. cit., 208A.

LADNER But, Gregory continues, "[God] foresaw by His all-seeing power that [man's] free will would not go straight forward toward the beautiful and good, and thus would fall off from the angelic life. In order, therefore, that the full number of human souls might not be curtailed by the fall from that mode by which the angels were in- creased to full number - for this reason, He prepared in our nature the device of increase suitable to those who have slipped down into sin." 112 God then created man as a composite being, not only spiritual, but also sexual-corporeal, because He foresaw his fall, his original sin, which was Adam's and Eve's disobedience, and all the dire consequences which cul- minate in fallen man's mortality. As did most of the Fathers, so also Gregory of Nyssa assumed that the sexual condition of man is most representative of his brute corporeality, that it constitutes the most powerful of his passions and the main difference between man and God. Yet, his principal reason for laying such emphasis on man's bisexuality was, as pointed out, other than this. The source of evil is not in God: it is rather man's withdrawal from the God-given good and therefore something purely negative."3 But God knows that man, through the perverse use of his free will, of his spiri- tual liberty, would lose his God-like, his quasi-angelic, his immortal life. Was he to lose it forever? One might resume Gregory's answer to this ques- tion thus: Only if man received mutability, which is essentially linked to his bodily constitution, and the gift of sexual propagation, would mankind as a whole, be able to reach its pre-ordained pleroma, only thus would it have the opportunity to return to God. Without the mutable and mortal body man would have remained fixed in spiritual aversion from God, to- gether with the fallen angels; 114 without sexual propagation mortal fallen Xltyov 7rpcx7O7KaLs rT v f7rcy1vo0JVWV CLvqkELavcv 6dL 7TL ov TXTkpw)/A L v optL0lov rwv AvXWV reChCoo'/zfvov .... 1" De hornm. op. 17, loc. cit., 189C f.: . .. .r8r IrpoeE rTf- 8paTLKl 8vvdz1 / E VT0ropo(av I-TP KcT XOV rrqv 7rpoa potv Katl a L VT o0To p1a 7 7yyXLK ga r 7 rrTr[ovuv, cog av Uq'l o~(OkvEt?7 rb rWv IvXoWv TwoV CVOp7v0wVrV o 7rXrOEfr0CfV oKVOV o70o TpIOV Ka' V o ; yyEXoL -rposT 7- rXk0og rV3 48'aUav, &amp;L TOVOTO rrjv KaT AXX'qXOV TOL3 EL' 1aP3apl/ KaTOXt(YGT L T37 (UOWc ELV5L LV E/KKa~acrKEva'CEL tT7 ^/4)EL n Oratio catechetica 5, ed.

At the end of time, in heaven, where, as Gregory reminds us, there is no marriage,"' the first creational image-likeness with God, with Christ, in whom there is neither male nor female,11 will come to the fore again in undiluted fashion. Mankind's task in time and history is to become what it is in God's original plan: a spiritual being or, more exactly, a being in which the full dignity of man is vindicated not only in his mind but also in a spiritualized body. Had not St. Paul said: "What is sown a natural body, rises a spiritual body"? 118 Gregory's theory of time is closely bound up with this anthropology, in spite of the fact that, contrary to St. Augustine's, his concept of time is basically cosmological rather than psychological. Foresight of corporeal mortality, which is a result of the protoplasts' transgression, necessitated both man's constitution as a bisexual being and the temporal organization of the world.119 For, that fulness (pleroma) of a God-like human race which God contemplated at the very beginning and which, in a sinless state, could have been accomplished, along with the pleroma of the angels, with- out death, without sexual propagation,120 and without temporal delay, must and will now be achieved by a long detour. Sexual propagation must make up for individual mortality; the passions which, because of the animalic mode of our conception and birth, are common to us and the animals - although worse in us because of the contamination with a perverted spirit,121 - must be slowly and laboriously purged and rectified; 122 the fullness of essentially not &amp;KiVnTOLt, but only 8V0LETadOETot or 8VcTKl VVT0L (cf.

It appears to me very probable that for Gregory of Nyssa, too, it was only after the fall of the bad angels that the good angels were certain to adhere to God forever: in the case of the angels, apparently, only one single decision for or against God could be envisaged. (Whether Gregory of Nyssa thought that the bad angels, too, would finally be redeemed in the apocatastasis of all things seems doubtful; cf. J. Daniblou, S.J., "L'apocatastase chez Saint Gr6goire de Nysse," Recherches de science religieuse XXX [1940], 328 ff., Gr.

LADNER mankind, which might have been ever-present in a timeless instant of eternity, must become reality through a long chain of generations whose end only God knows.123 This, according to Gregory of Nyssa, is also why we must wait so long for the resurrection of the bodies and the restoration of all things.24 But in man's fallen state this temporal delay is a necessity and a boon not only with regard to the physical completion of the human race, but even more with regard to its spiritual reformation.'25 The temporal rhythm is one of life and death, of wakefulness and sleep, of tension and relaxation, of continuous renewal until time be consumed and consummated in eternity. What Gregory says about reformation and time, resurrection and eternity, stands on the border line between the philosophical-physio- logical and the mystical-ascetic aspects of his anthropology. While these latter aspects fall outside the scope of this paper,'26 it is necessary before summing up Gregory of Nyssa's philosophical anthro- pology to add a few clarifications concerning his concept of the body and of its union with soul and mind. Gregory himself must have felt such a necessity when in De hominis opificio, after having traced man's spiritual drama from creation to the resurrection of the bodies, he returns once more to the psychosomatic relationship."'27 The question in fact arises why, if the body as we know it was created by God only in foresight of the fall, the final reformation of man's image- likeness to God should include the resurrection of the body. From a philo- sophical point of view this question is even more important than the other, discussed by Gregory in De hominis opificio and elsewhere: how such resurrection of the bodies is possible; in other words, how a body dissolved into its elements can be reunited with its appertaining soul.'28 The first question in part coincides with a third one: If, as Gregory often asserts, the reformation of man in this life and beyond is an d&amp;rOoKa- ' De hom. op. 22, loc. cit., 205B-209A.

" De hornm. op. 28 ff., loc. cit., 229B ff.

For this whole trend of thought Gregory no doubt was indebted to Origen who in the same context of the doctrine of the resurrection had spoken of an indestructible J3o3 xapaKrrTpPtov Tr caoa, cf.

For, did not God originally create man in His image which is spiritual? But did Gregory of Nyssa really believe that God would not have given man a body at all, had He not foreseen the protoplast's sin? This is probably the most difficult question of Gregorian anthropology, since Gregory is far from explicit in answering it. While he definitely asserts that God made man bisexual only because of His foreknowledge of man's transgression, Gregory did not look at the creation of the body as such in the same merely condi- tional and derogatory way. In the Catechetical Oration he gives as a reason for the mingling of the intelligible and the sensible in man God's desire that "no part of creation might be rejected [cf. I Timothy 4:4] . . . nor deprived of divine communion" and that "grace, as it were, might evenly extend through all creation. ... ." 130 There remains here, nevertheless, a certain lack of clarity or explicitness in the Bishop of Nyssa's doctrine, which, perhaps, explains in part the serious charges against Gregory's consistency raised by H. Cherniss, whose doubt of Gregory's intellectual integrity is less justifiable.'13 Cherniss' arguments, though based on a some- what too exclusive view of Gregory's Platonism, to the exclusion, that is, of essential Stoic elements, are nevertheless, very penetrating and deserve more attention than they have so far received. I am convincd that a definitive evaluation of Gregory of Nyssa's anthropology requires a more thorough examination of this criticism of his thought. Here I must limit myself to an attempt at a brief elucidation of the point just touched upon: Gregory's teaching on the resurrection of the body, which in H. Cherniss' view amounts to a full antinomy between the Bishop of Nyssa's Platonic spiritual- ism and his allegedly uneasy acceptance of the Christian dogma. The coherence of Gregory's whole anthropology does indeed hinge on the question whether or not he believed that it could have been meaningful for man, the spiritual image of God, to have a body even without sin. If it can be shown that his opinion in this matter was affirmative, it is not surprising that the eschatological resurrection of the bodies was not a See, with regard to the resurrection of the bodies, for instance, De anima et resurrec- tione, PG XLVI, 148: T&amp;rL v1rcalc ~ EyrrTv LV eqi rO apxatov Try cvroIm q(licv dr/oKa0rdVcract, also ibid., 149D and 156C, and Oratio catechetica 8, ed.

LADNER stumbling block to him in the elaboration of his anthropological doctrine. And I believe it can so be shown, though only fragmentary efforts in this direction have so far been made. It will be remembered how strongly Gregory of Nyssa stressed the unity of body and soul in actual man, that is to say, in Adam and Eve and all their descendents.832 His entire conception of the unfolding of simul- taneous virtual creation is teleologically geared to the actual simultaneous emergence of the mind or the rational, spiritual part of man's soul, and the lower soul and body. This event no doubt took place at the stage of Genesis 2:7, when God formed Adam from earth and vivified him by His breath, though in De hominis opificio Gregory glides very quickly over this first moment of man's actual history,'"" and in the Oratio catechetica he does not clarify the relationship between the man of Genesis 1:26 f. and the Adam of Genesis 2:7.134 However, what he does clearly indicate on many occasions is the moment in which Adam actually, and historically so to speak, assumed that passible and passionate, corporeal-sexual condition which man has had ever since. This moment was not that of Genesis 2:7, but it corresponds to a somewhat later stage of the Genesis-account, when God gave Adam and Eve garments made from the skins of animals. These are the famous xLrCTove~ EpCLdr/LvoL, the "tunics of skin" of Genesis 3:21 135 which have a long history in late classical and early Christian thought.136 These super-added skins or garments, which Adam and Eve had to put on after the fall, Gregory of Nyssa expressly identifies with man's actual assumption of that coarsely corporeal mode of existence 17 which God had at first created only poten- 1"2 See supra pp. 69 ff.

Gregory's whole anthropology is directed toward the overcoming of cor- poreality as it exists in man after the fall. This is why Genesis 1:27, which stresses the origin of sexuality and Genesis 3:21, which in Gregory's inter- pretation refers to mortality 138 or to irrationality "39 and in any case to brute animalic existence, through the metaphor of the skins of dead animals, are for him the crucial scriptural texts concerning the creation of man's body. He has little to say about man's origin from earth, according to Genesis 2:7.140 He would no doubt have elaborated on it had he considered the earthen shape of Adam a symbol of gross, material corporeality. That he did not do so would seem to confirm that for him Adam's actually emergent body, the body of Genesis 2:7 which was shaped from earth but enlivened by God, was not yet the wretched passionate and passible body that poses such an exasperating problem for Gregory. One is justified, I believe, in surmising that to Gregory of Nyssa the bodily condition as such, as it existed in Adam and Eve in Paradise before the fall, was not affected and afflicted by passions, that it was a corporeality very much like the spiritual one which will again prevail after the resurrection, and that this spiritualized corporeality was in God's plans for man from the beginning, quite apart mortuis, PG XLVI, 521D-524D. - That the tunics of skin of Genesis 3:21, and not the creational body of Genesis 2:7, correspond to the material corporeality virtually created in the beginning according to Genesis 1:27, but conditional upon the fall, is confirmed by a passage in the Catechetical Oration, where Gregory directly identifies God's providential and remedial action in creating the mortal body with His clothing Adam and Eve in the "dead skins" of Genesis 3:21.

In his interpretation of Genesis 3:21 Gregory probably used and modified Philo's allegorical exegesis. Philo, Questions and Answers on Genesis I, 53, ed. Marcus, loc. cit., 30 f., interprets the XurmwVe Epldrwo of Genesis 3:21 allegorically as man's body, whereas the man molded from clay according to Genesis 2:7 is, for Philo, not yet the body, but rather the earthlike mind which mixes with the body, but has not yet actually been mixed with it, cf. Legum Allegoria I, 12, 31 f., ed. Cohn, loc. cit., 68 f. (see also p. 81). As Wolfson, Philo I, 118 f., has shown, Philo's assumption that the creation of the body proper occurred as late as Genesis 3:21 corresponds to a Jewish tradition which included all events preceding Adam's and Eve's expulsion from Paradise in the six days of creation. Gregory differs from Philo in that for him the Xmrovews p/EPdrvot do not mean the body as such, but only its passionate, passible and mortal aspects. In this he may be in- fluenced by Origen; cf. In Leviticum homil. VI, 2, GCS, Orig. VI, 362, but see also Origen's doubts, Selecta in Genesim, to Genesis 3:21, PG XII, 101B. ` Cf.

Gregory speaks of x&amp;TWoVEg or vUs ara 4TroEL~86 or XapTrpc, of tunics or garments that man wore before he had to put on the tunics of skin, and that he will regain through Christ.'42 These luminous and aerial garments - they, too, incidentally, are an older concept of the history of religious thought '" - correspond to the paradisiac condition of man. A Christian receives them back in baptism; he can make them his lasting possession even on earth in his mystic-ascetic ascent to God, and they will be an eternal reward of the saints in the resurrection of their bodies."' It would really seem that for Gregory the body was originally spirit-like as it will again be in the end.'45 True, the creational body was bisexual, while the resurrec- tional body will be neither male nor female; "46 but, in Paradise, sexuality was not yet operative; "' the creation of the sexes according to Genesis 1:27 141 Holl, Amphilochius von Ikonium 202 ff., also stresses the fact that Gregory saw in Genesis 3:21 an allegorical expression of a real transformation of man's corporeal existence in the sense of a change from a more spiritual to a more material body. In this connection cf. E. F. Sutcliffe, S.J., "St. Gregory of Nyssa and Paradise," The Ecclesiastical Review LXXXIV (1931), 338. For Gregory the spiritual restoration of man by Christ, including the spiritualiza- tion of the body in the resurrection, is a return to his spiritual state in Paradise. Since this restoration is at the same time a reformation of man's original image-likeness with God, one is led again to a realization of the unified character of man's creation: for God the virtual creation of the pleroma of mankind in the spiritual image of God (see supra, p. 82) and of the spirit-like uncorrupted and passionless body of the first individual man are one. It is therefore not advisable to distinguish sharply, with Schoemann, "Gregors von Nyssa theologische An- thropologie .. . ," Scholastik XVIII, 34 ff. and 42 ff., between the "original supra-historical image of God" (i.e., the pleroma of mankind) and the "original historical image of God" (i.e., man's state in Paradise); Schoemann himself admits that a strict distinction is impossible. It is essential to recognize that in Gregory's view, while spirit remains supreme, the body - but not sex - was not an "afterthought" of God. 142 See, for instance, De oratione dominica 5, PG XLIV, 1184B: the descendants of Adam wear the "tunics of skin," 7tW, (SlO" TE Ka' XaL7rrpWV vSvza'Tw V7V yV VTE . . . .

For, in Paradise before the fall, man was similar to the angels. Gregory says explicitly that man's mode of propagation, too, could have been an angelic one.148 If then man's creational body was close to spirit, the Gregorian doctrine of the resurrection of the bodies is not inconsistent with his anthro- pological system, not even with his Christian version of Platonism."49 Thus Gregory of Nyssa, after all, saves the dignity of the body as well as that of the mind, though it is only a fully spiritualized body which seems to him worthy of man. This conception of a victory of mind over matter is Christian, but it is also in the tradition of Greek paideia. In the mystical anthropology of his Life of Moses and of other exegetical and ascetical treatises Gregory describes in combined Christian and pre-Christian terms 150 the road to that spiritualization which in some degree can be attained even in this life. sexes&gt; chez Gregoire de Nysse," Revue des sciences religieuses XXVII (1953), 108, rightly points to the fact that only after the fall of Adam and Eve and after their being clothed in the "tunics of skin" does Gregory use such terms as marriage (ycdLos) and sexual union (CAet); regarding the time before the fall he speaks only of the distinction of male and fe- male (e.g. De hornm. op. 16, loc. cit., 185A: " '-rcpt 7- appev Ka' O3kXv 8taoopd).

Cf. St. Augustine's implicit criticism of this view in De civitate Dei XIV, 26, Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina XLVIII, 449 ff., and St. Thomas Aquinas' explicit rejection of Gregory's exposition of it, as expressed in De hominis opificio, in the Summa Theologica I, 98, 2. 1" Cherniss, Platonism, 57 f., holds that Gregory in conceiving of the resurrection of the body as a restoration of man's original state, and of the resurrectional body itself as lacking the body's 7rdO7/ contradicts himself; also, that Gregory accepts the doctrine of the resurrec- tion only because he is forced to do so. Cherniss' argument would be valid, if for Gregory the restoration of man necessarily means in an Origenist sense return to purely incorporeal intelligibility; actually it means the "recreation" of the spiritualized body of Adam in Para- dise. In De anima et resurrectione, PG XLVI, 137B-145A, Gregory deals at considerable length with objections similar to those of Professor Cherniss: it would indeed seem that in the resurrection man must either lose his identity, if his body is no longer an ordinary body, or, if his body were to be the same as in this present life, the resurrection would be disas- trous and, at the same time, monstrous, since it would have to recall to simultaneous existence all the various ages and stages of an ever-changing material entity. Gregory overcomes these difficulties with the help of St. Paul's doctrine of death and resurrection according to I Cor- inthians 15:42 ff.: just as a grain "is sown in corruption," molders and dies in the ground to rise as a new ear, "in the same fashion human nature, while in death it drops all properties surrounding it, which it had acquired through its passionate disposition . . . , yet does not lose itself . . ."; for the risen spiritual body, though it is something nobler than the terrestrial body of post-paradisiac man, is still "nothing else than what it was at first," i.e., in Paradise (cf. De anima et resurrectione, loc. cit., esp. 156A-C). " Cf. Jaeger, Rediscovered Works, 76 ff.</page><page sequence="34">92 GERHART B. LADNER On the philosophical level Gregory of Nyssa's ultimate answer to the great anthropological problem of the body's relation to the God-like mind on the one hand and to passion and death on the other seems to be the following: Even though bisexuality of the body was given to man in fore- sight of sin and death, the body of Paradise was still very close to spirit. It was and is man's sin, his turning away from true beauty and goodness, that made and makes the body not only actively sexual but also a source of evil. In a striking passage of De hominis opificio Gregory says: "While . . . [our material part and our mind-ruled nature] cling to one another, the communion of the true beauty extends propor- tionally through all, making beautiful through the superior that which is next to it. But when there occurs any gap in this good con- nection or when even, on the contrary, the superior in turn follows the inferior, then . . . the shapelessness of matter comes through. . . . Thus the transmission through [our] nature of material ugli- ness arrives at the mind itself, so that the image of God is no longer seen in the character of the creature. . . . And in this way there comes about the genesis of evil . . . and thus it is shown that our material part remains firm and subject when it is governed by [our] nature [which is held together by our mind], but on the other hand it is dissolved and falls asunder when it is severed from that which holds it together and in subjection and when it is torn away from its connection with the beautiful and good. But this happens only when [our] nature turns to [its] opposite, when our desire inclines not to the beautiful, but to that which is in need of being made beautiful. For it is absolutely necessary that that which becomes similar to matter, which is in want of a form of its own, be transformed also into something formless and unbeautiful. .. ."151 151 De hom. op. 12, loc. cit., 161D-164B (this text is the continuation of the one quoted on p. 77, note 75): "Eo ~iv oiv EXrac 70~o iorpov r Torepov, 8ta ravrwv ava'dyw~ 70 ro- vrOM KaXXoVU KOLVoVla 8&amp;EeELTL 8Lt 70' TO YTE"pKEL EVOU 70 T pOOE?XO KaXXrtr.lOvoa.

It is not difficult to integrate it with Gregory's interpretation of man's double creation according to the book of Genesis. Once more: God according to Genesis 1:27 gave man a mortal and bisexual body because He foresaw how he would act and because He knew that under these circumstances mortality and sexuality would have a remedial function; but neither Adam nor any man had or has to do evil. Only when Adam and Eve actually committed sin did the inferiority of man's bodily constitution make its appearance, symbolized in Holy Scrip- ture by the XtTGVE9 p8Epa'rwoL of Genesis 3:21. As far as its relation to evil is concerned, the body was and is only an instrument, and it can be an instrument also of good. In Paradise, before the fall, the body was in full unison with the highest part of the soul, and, after its resurrection, it will again be in harmony with the spirit. On earth the ascetic way of life mysti- cally anticipates man's return to Paradise and must, therefore, tend toward spiritualization of the body and thus toward re-assimilation to God. It was not my intention in this paper to smooth out all the difficulties of Gregory of Nyssa's anthropological thought.152 It is quite certain that he himself did not believe that he had said the last word on a Christian anthropology. On the contrary, he often humbly advances theories as hypotheses, even his pivotal doctrine of the double creation of man.'5 There is, nevertheless, an imposing unity about Gregory of Nyssa's thought on man and on the dignity of human nature. Spirit, soul, and body are one in man. His image-likeness to God was true resemblance from the very beginning: eikon and homoiosis were one even in creation, just as they will be one again in spiritual reformation and in corporeal resurrection. The creational body itself does not disturb Gregory's vision of God's plans for man and the universe, for that body was indeed a light burden - luminous, spirit-like. Even now it is beautiful and marvelously adapted to the mind: it has remained a work of God who obviously did not consider bodies valueless if He created them. 15 Some of the difficulties in the thought of Gregory of Nyssa and of the other Cappa- docians, particularly in their conception of sin, are dealt with by Professor Otis in this vol- ume. It seems to me, however, that Professor Otis somewhat overstresses the element of ig- norance in the Cappadocians' concept of sin; I cannot quite share his view that this con- ception accounted for their difficulty in explaining the sin of spiritual creatures, especially of the angels. The Cappadocians' apparent perplexity before the fact that angels and "spirit- ual" men should choose evil knowingly, seems to me to derive, rather, from a genuine realiza- tion of the "mystery of iniquity." 1 Cf., for instance, De hom. op. 16, loc. cit., 180C: WHdE 8e, KaO' ocrov XwpoVpEv, crroXa- o0totg TLOL KalL UVTrovoLat~ TO Aoes gvtX1EvOVTE.

LADNER Yet, there remains in Gregory of Nyssa's thinking, I would not say, a contradiction, but a tension which, it seems to me, is also a part of his greatness. It is, in short, the tension between the Gregorian, the Cappado- cian, and, generally, the Platonizing form of Greek Christian spirituality and the ineluctable materiality of the physical world which includes non- human nature. This beautiful world, of which God was the creator and man was to be the master, cannot be fully real and at the same time fully spiritualized after Paradise and before the general resurrection and the restoration of all things. Perhaps this Greek and Christian tension between matter and spirit is resolved symbolically in the sacred art of Byzantium, where figures of angels and of saints, almost disembodied in Basilian con- tempt of all 7roXvo-apKia, weightlessly glide past the jewel-like beauty of a not-quite-real nature.</page></plain_text>
