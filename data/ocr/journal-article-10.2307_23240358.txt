The violence is both material and symbolic and relies on the elision of internal distinctions between animals. This article is concerned with what constitutes a sufficient response to violence. Animal and feminist geographies challenge instrumental abstractions of space to 'raw materials'; the suppression and/or exclusion of emotional responses to space and place; and document current and alternative engagements with animals and environments. However, to challenge violence they must also address issues of power, ethical dimensions of action, and generate new conceptions of animal-human spatial relations. This article argues for a compassionate geography informed by Derridean philosophy, which reconceptualises and reconstructs animal-human spatial relations and postcolonial ecocriticism, which attends to the colonial politics of images, stories of place, and their imaginative reoccupation.

Indeed it can be argued that the violence of the 'imaginary' constitutes the very nature of dis ciplinarity itself (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010). In his work on the question of the animal Jacques Derrida deliberates on the material and symbolic violence we do to animals. I argue that his address to human-animal relations also serves as an address to human-social relations and human-environmental relations. In short the question of the animal serves as an address to the violent materialities and imaginaries of geography itself. Of geographical significance in Derrida's work is the challenge it poses to our capacity to represent places in relation to beings. Importantly it raises the question of responsibility and compassion. For Derrida there is no escape from the violence and suffering we have caused and continue to cause; even as we empathise and seek to reduce it. Compassion in this sense is to bear suffering; to suffer with and alongside. What compassion implies for geography goes beyond the sympathetic desire to improve or make amends. It brings questions of responsibility and ethics into historical and lo cational contexts and requires an understanding of how we come to be in this condition; how it disorders and calls all our actions into question; and how we might differently occupy spaces and places. Derrida's work raises the question of what constitutes a 'sufficient response' to our assault on animal life, human life, the world and our diminishing capacity to imagine things otherwise. His arguments do not negate the work undertaken by animal and feminist geographers who document current and alternative human-animal-environment relations. Rather, they press geography into more direct engagement with issues of violence, ethical dimensions of actions and the capacity to imagine things differently - beyond that of adding an animal dimension to pre-existing forms of disciplinarity. However, while Derrida's philosophical work might urge reconsideration, it does not direct us to resources that may enable us to rethink the colonial politics of images, to revise and reconstruct stories of place or to imaginatively reoccupy places and spaces. I suggest that texts identified and debated in green postcolonialism or postcolonial ecocriticism are a rich source of such ideas. However, it is important to note that they are not the only source (see for example the accounts by Somerville and Perkins (2010) and Bird Rose (2008) of Australian Indigenous knowledge and Haraway's (1989) discussions of interspecies encounters). The political and practical implications of an alliance between postcolonial studies and geography are identified by Amstrong (2002) who calls for: Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="3">127 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL sharp, politicized, culturally sensitive, and up-to-the-minute local histories of the roles that animals and their representations have placed - or made to play - in colonial and postcolonial transactions (Armstrong 2002,416). In addition, colonial and postcolonial accounts of animal-human relations docu ment issues such as the treatment of the colonised as if they were part of nature and akin to animals, the colonisation of indigenous worldviews, the release and breeding of European species in the colonies to create new markets, the decimation and exploitation of native animals through hunting and, 'acclimatisa tion' practices involving the replacement of native fauna with European fauna (Tiffin, 2007). Such work supplements studies in animal geography which have highlighted the environmental and ethical dilemmas of new animal economies and have investigated the global expansion of meat consumption, meat driven agricultural practices such as factory farming and associated environmental problems, the loss of habitat, wildlife trade, extinction, animal research, and biotechnology and its commodification (Wolch and Emel, 1998). A focus on the absolute particularities of situated material places is a char acteristic of animal geographies that highlights animal-human coexistence and interaction in specific locations. Animal geographies explore the complex eco nomic, political, social and cultural pressures informing spatial relations between people and animals. The discipline is concerned with material places and how exclusions, inclusions and physical distance between people and animals are managed and imagined (Philo and Wolch, 1998). It is also interested in new ways of conceptualising animal-human spatial relations (Philo and Wilbert, 2000; Wolch, 2002). In challenging the anthropomorphic distinction of animals and humans, and nature and culture, animal geography encounters the question of how to undertake research and representation that acknowledges the problems of writing about 'others' (Johnston, 2008). This crisis of representation is one which risks voyeurism and the perverse thrill that can be an affect of scrutinising miser able abjection and/or ventriloquism which silences others at the same time as it purports to 'give voice' and speak for 'them'. Indeed, the rigorous pursuit of knowledge about 'the other' can as much comprise a flight from knowledge that is fundamental to the constitution of ourselves (Matthews, 1998). Derrida's longstanding engagement with the question of the animal challenges essentialist determinations and assumptions about what constitutes 'animality' or the being of'The Animal'. In addition, it argues for a situational ethics that interrupts our being and calls into question our mode of existence (Calarco, 2008). Derrida suggests that the escalating annihilation of non-human species is an effect of the ways we speak and name ourselves and others. This article outlines the rudiments of Derrida's thinking about animals and locates his work in relation to Agamben's (2004) analysis of the production of 'the human', and other interdisciplinary studies. The fundamental concern Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="4">128 JULIE MATTHEWS of this article is what constitutes lesser violence or a sufficient response to the question of the animal in light of the material and symbolic violence we do in the name 'animals'. The violence elides internal distinctions between animals. It takes it that all animals, including human animals are similar and share ani mality and yet at the same time it amplifies the difference between humans and other animals. It involves naming practices that affect the actual violence done to countless animal and human beings. Animal geography offers enormous potential for bringing Derrida's episte mological desire to fruition. Derrida's desire is nothing less than a rethinking of the fundamental premises of anthropocentric humanist knowledge. Such a project is necessarily limited by its location in philosophy and reliance on metaphysical abstractions and requires models of alternative ways of know ing and doing animal-human relations. Ecofeminism challenges instrumental abstractions of space to 'raw materials' and bring to light the suppression and exclusion of exploration of emotional responses to space and place (Smith et al., 2009). In a similar vein, animal geography calls for the repoliticisation of space and its reinhabitation with 'beastly' bodies (Wolch and Emel, 1998; Philo and Wilbert, 2000). While animal geography documents current and alterna tive engagements with animals and environments, it must also challenge the palpable and unanticipated affects of everyday action. To make a difference, it must address issues of power and the ethical dimensions of action, and it must formulate and reconceptualise spatial relations. This article argues for a compassionate geography committed to reconcep tualising and reconstructing animal-human spatial relations. I suggest that such methodological approach can be achieved by drawing on Derrida's deconstruction of anthropocentrism. The geographical significance of Derrida's concern with the question of the animal is that it brings ethical thinking into the trajectory of specific historical and location contexts. Like ecofeminism it challenges normative dualisms and value hierarchies where superior value is attributed to one or other side of a value hierarchy; however it does not assume a necessary complementarity between either side of the dualism, nor the possibility of rec onciliation (Warren 1996). Rather it seeks to proliferate other ways of doing and therefore undoing their arrangement by underlining the unsystematic diversity of complex life forms and processes constituting geographical systems. Anthropocentrism centres the primary importance of human being over all else and serves to disavow the havoc and violence we have perpetrated, and continue to escalate, in the name of the human It is a worldview that perme ates all disciplinary forms of scholarship, even the most radical philosophical critiques of humanism undertaken by Heidegger, Levinas and Agamben. With this in mind, I argue that the reconceptualisation and reconstruction of animal human spatial relations is further assisted by mustering another interdisciplinary force. An alliance with postcolonial ecocriticism would underline the colonial Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="5">129 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL politics of images and stories of place, while at the same time kindling and sustaining their reoccupation so that animal-human relations are refigured in a practice that proliferates and reimagines ways of being with, beside, around and even within animals; that displaces and replaces, disconnects and reconnects animals, fauna, creatures, beasts, wildlife and 'us'. Human liberation will never be fully achieved without challenging the historical conditions under which human societies have constructed themselves in hierarchi cal relations to other societies, both human andnonhuman, and without imagining new ways in which human societies, understood as being ecologically connected, can be creatively transformed (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010: 22). Compassion and empathy play a key part in motivating individual action which can flow on to initiate broader changes. Jurisprudence, for example, often takes into account victim impact statements in the process of conceptualising appropriate sentences for those found guilty of criminal violence. Recently this mode of representation was applied to a case of animal cruelty and resulted in the imposition of the maximum sentence of two to four years, and $8,335 restitution to the new carers of a badly beaten puppy (Friedlander, 2010). These types of cases have the capacity to facilitate larger social change by way of our legal institutions. 'I was only 5 months old. He got mad at my owner. Then he hurt me - he beat me at least 3 times. He broke out some teeth and broke 2 legs and then he took me to a park and he left me - but I couldn't walk and I was afraid' (Friedlander, 2010). FIGURE 1. Victim impact image and statement presented to court However, a reliance on emotional empathy and compassion is unable to direct the extent of the change required due to the sheer incomprehensibility of the quantity of violence we need to comprehend: Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="6">130 JULIE MATTHEWS Regarding the 10 billion animals killed eveiy year for our consumption, let's say, conservatively, that .1% of those (1 out of every thousand) do not lose consciousness (via stunning or electric water bath). This means that one million animals are skinned alive each year - a large number, but one that, in that it is comprehensible, we can empathize with and at least begin to imagine the horror of that experience (Shapiro, 2010). The sheer magnitude of escalating animal brutality militates against this empathic response because: 'We lose the sense of an individual animal's life when he or she is placed in, really lost in, an unfathomably large aggregate' (Shapiro, 2010). This is a problem for the animal rights movement, which relies on empathy and imaginative identification with animals. The compassionate practice suggested by Derrida's work does not rely on a fixed set of emotional or ethical responses derived from external stimuli, but a practice of care and mindfulness based on a passion for living and a fear of death; the shared cor poreality of living with the other (Lawlor, 2001: 109). In a gesture intended to counter powerlessness engendered by the enormity of the problem of violence against animals, Shapiro (2010) recounted the story of a person who, whilst walking along the beach, picked up one of the countless little creatures left behind by the tide and threw it back into the sea. When asked what difference that effort could make, the person replied, 'all the difference in the world to that starfish'. Shapiro highlights the importance of a single animal life and focused consideration of the importance of every action; however it is evident that such actions are insufficient. They are insufficient for the 50 per cent of species likely to become extinct in the next decade, the 44,838 species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of threatened species (Vie et al., 2009) and for the 125 million animal slaughtered every day in the US (Patterson, 2002: 71). THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT The question of what for Derrida constitutes a sufficient response to animal suf fering is discussed at length by Lawlor (2007). Lawlor is interested in changing people's perceptions of, and attitudes to, animal-hum an relations. Derrida disputes both the Cartesian view that animals are machines who merit no compassion (metaphysical separationism), and the Animal Rights view that they should be shown the same compassion as shown to humans (biological continuism). While it is necessary and important to support animal rights, the approach is problematic because it reduces humans to animals or elevates animals to human existence: If one raises animals to the level of humans, or if one lowers humans to the level of animals, one ignores the difference that requires living beings to be treated in a variety of ways (Lawlor, 2007: 25). Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="7">131 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL Derrida's deconstructive position seeks to proliferate and multiply the limits of the animal/human binary in a theoretical practice that works from within the terms of the discourse to identify internal contradictions, dependencies, implicit premises and elisions. Deconstruction shows that binaries are untenable because one term necessary depends on and infects the other. It challenges the understandings we depend on to generate truth by questioning the privileging of certain truths and considering how truths are produced (Spivak, 1990). It shows that we are neither continuous with, nor entirely distinct from animals. APPROACHING ANIMALS Before further examining Derrida's philosophical thoughts, it is useful to rec ognise the recent expansion of research and writing in interdisciplinary fields of animal-human relations. These include animal geographies (Whatmore, 2006; Wolch and Emel, 1998), animal studies (Brady, 2009; Lloyd and Mulcock, 2007; Shapiro, 2002; Simmons and Armstrong, 2007), animal rights (Franklin, 2005; Regan, 2004; Singer, 2006), environmental and animal ethics (Acampora, 2006; Wapner and Matthew, 2009), animal philosophy (Atterton and Calarco, 2004; Calarco, 2007), the history and anthropology of animal-human relations (Kalof, 2007; Ritvo, 2002), studies of interspecies relations (Haraway, 2008), animal sociology (Franklin, 1999, 2007; Irvine, 2008), ecofeminist studies of animals nature and gender (Gaard, 1993; Kheel, 2008), and green postcolonial ism and postcolonial ecocriticism (Cilano and Deloughrey, 2007; Huggan and Tiffin, 2007,2010). While postcolonial perspectives (Sharp, 2009) and animal human relations (Whatmore, 2006; Wolch and Emel, 1998) have been discussed in relation to geography, animal-human relations from a postcolonial perspective rarely figure in human animal studies. An exception to this is found in the work of Armstrong (2002) who suggests that one reason for the omission is that a focus on animals and colonialism risks trivialising the suffering of people under co lonialism. However, as Armstrong (2002) notes, the problem goes to the very heart of human animal studies because the notion of 'animal' is fundamental to the conceptual categories and hierarchies laid down in colonialism. Indeed, the idea of a hierarchical relationship between animals and humans is a product of colonialism and European modernity and non-Western value systems offer entirely different ways of understanding the human-animal relations. Even though studies of animal-human relations may be increasing, there remains a heretical and unscholarly resonance to speaking about animals in non physiological terms. Discussions about animal-human relations remain outside mainstream social science, humanities and arts discourse where it is commonly taken that animals are most properly investigated by science and biology in Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="8">132 JULIE MATTHEWS fields such as zoology (the study of behaviour and habitats) and ethology (the study of instinctive and natural behaviour such as communication, emotions, culture, learning, sexual conduct and physiology). A good deal of social science and humanities research is influenced by anthro pologists of the 1970s who showed that 'human conceptualization, classification, and theorization of animals signify or encode social thought' (Franklin, 1999: 9). In other words, animals are good to think with. They enable us to think about what it is to be properly human and the 'socially constructed' animal world is then used to provide clarification of human social structures, morals and con flicts. Also of significance during this era were environmental ethics debates which investigated how humans treat nature and why they mistreat nonhuman entities. Whether deemed a consequence of the Judeo-Christian tradition and the dominion of humans over nature, an effect of modernity, patriarchy, and/ or capitalist commodification, the fundamental problem has been identified as anthropocentrism and the privileging of human life over all else (Wapner and Matthew, 2009). Strong arguments have been made for broadening the moral considerations extended to humans to animals. Animal rights theorists such as Regan (2004) argue that animals' lives should not be dependent on their utility to humans because they are subjects of life and have moral right to just treat ment. Animal life has inherent value because animals are independent subjects who care about life. They have perception, desire, belief, memory, intention and a sense of the future. It is precisely because of our similarity and shared biology that Agamben (2004) observes the necessity to establish binary distinctions between animals and humans. For Agamben politics itself is produced by an 'anthropological machine' that constructs the category 'human' against the category 'animal'. The category 'human' is of itself empty because it simply depends on a disa vowal of animality. Traditionally, the anthropological machine functioned to humanise animals such that barbarians and slaves were regarded as animals in human form. Later it animalised humans to constitute the outside of humanity as in the case of the Jews: If, in the machine of the moderns, the outside is produced through the exclusion of an inside and the inhuman produced by animalizing the human, here [the machine of earlier times] the inside is obtained through the inclusion of an outside, and the non-man is produced by the humanization of an animal: the man-ape, the enfant sauvage or Homo ferns, but also and above all the slave, the barbarian, and the foreigner, as figures of an animal in human form (Agamben, 2004: 37 cited in Oliver, 2007: 1). Agamben seeks to render inoperative the process that governs our conceptions of humanity by exposing operations of mastery, comprehension, technological calculations, and biopower (Ziarek, 2008). While his work may expose the politics of animal-human relations, it does not interrogate the ways we come Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="9">133 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL to treat animals as we do, how animality justifies violence (Oliver, 2007), and how we live within this condition (Derrida, 2002). THE ANIMAL THAT THEREFORE I AM (MORE TO FOLLOW) Like Agamben, Derrida (2002) problematises the positing of man over and against the animal. But his path and conclusion is rather more laborious. Finding himself naked in the gaze of his cat he takes the occasion to consider its otherness and his human being. The reflective moment makes him conscious of his shame and embarrassment for 'being as naked as an animal' (Derrida, 2002: 373). In the question of the animal Derrida deconstructs the foundations of Western metaphysics. He challenges philosophers such as Levinas and Heidegger who have called humanism into question, but who continue to inscribe the animal/ human binary opposition. While they have been credited, along with Marx, Nieztche, Althusser and Foucault, with bringing about the 'death of the subject', in actual fact they have only complicated it. Their unquestioned anthropocen trism 'ties them firmly to the humanist tradition they attempt to call into ques tion' (Calarco, 2004: 187). They fail to challenge the primacy of humanity, or in Derrida's terms, the acceptability of putting non-humans to death; 'they do not sacrifice sacrifice': Discourses as original as those of Heidegger and Levinas disrupt, of course, a certain traditional humanism. In spite of the differences separating them, they nonetheless remain profound humanisms to the extent that they do not sacrifice sacrifice [en tant qu'ils ne sacrifient pas le sacrifice] (Derrida cited in Calarco, 2004: 180). Derrida refers to this form of subjectivity as 'carno-phallogocentrism'. It is constituted through the real sacrifice of animals, and the symbolic sacrifice of animals and human beings: 'Being a subject means being a self-present, speak ing, virile eater of flesh' (Calarco, 2004: 90). Vegetarianism is not less party to carno-phallogocentrism, they may not consume animals, but their being is sustained through violence and other products requiring the death of animals (Calarco, 2004). It is just a matter of where the line is drawn between real and symbolic violence and indeed the universalisation of a singular being; 'an animal' under the name 'animals' is no less a symbolic sacrifice which extinguishes the existence of others. Derrida's cat is a real living being. It looks and can be spoken to but it doesn't reply. Even when it responds to its name, 'it doesn't do so as the exemplar of a species called cat, even less so of an animal genus or realm' (Derrida, 2004: 378). It is an 'existence that refuses to be conceptualized' (Derrida, 2004: 378). Indeed, 'animal' is a term that eludes and defies the capacity of language and philosophy. As Calarco (2008) observes it is impossibly singular: Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="10">134 JULIE MATTHEWS To behold, and even be struck and wonder about, this plurality of forms, modes, and relations of animal life is one of the events that the philosophical tradition has worked consistently and persistently to block (Calarco, 2008: 144). An animal can look: It has its point of view regarding me. The point of view of the absolute other, and nothing will have ever done more to make me think through this absolute alterity of the neighbour than these moments when I see myself seen naked under the gaze of the cat (Derrida, 2002:380). And yet while it occurs to Derrida that he understands what his cat wants he is unable to comprehend its perception in the very same moment as he recognises its address. This recalls a profound disavowal in philosophical and theoretical discourse: It is as if the men representing this configuration had seen without being seen, seen the animal without being seen by it, without being seen seen by it; without being seen seen naked by someone who, from the basis of a life called animal, and not only by means of the gaze, would have obliged them to recognize, at the moment of address, that this was their affair, their look-out [que cela les regardait] (Derrida, 2002: 383). The disavowal is what institutes the 'proper' of man to itself and to 'a hu manity that is above all careful to guard, and jealous of, what is proper to it' (Derrida, 2002: 383). The animal is a word, it is an appellation that men have instituted, a name they have given themselves the right and the authority to give to another living crea ture (Derrida, 2002: 392). In this disavowal we subjugate and establish our right and authority to our own subjectivity and superiority. Derrida does not stop with the observation that in naming we commit symbolic violence. The violence 'has been accelerating, intensifying, no longer knowing where it is going, for about two centuries, at an incalculable rate and level' (Derrida, 2002:393). Here Derrida refers to 'forms of knowledge' and 'techniques of intervention' such as the annihilation of entire species, the exploitation of animals in factory farms and experiments, and the industrialisation of animal meat production. It is a disavowal and subjection of unprecedented proportions, a dissimulated globalisation of cruelty, a genocide of monstrous proportions: Everybody knows what a terrifying and intolerable picture arealist painting could give to the industrial mechanical, chemical, hormonal, and genetic violence to which man has been submitting animal life for the past two centuries. Everybody knows what the production, breeding, transport, and slaughter of these animals has become (Derrida, 2004: 120). Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="11">135 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL Derrida's work underlines the symbolic and material boundaries that prevent us from thinking differently about ours and their modes of existence (Calarco, 2008). As mentioned earlier, practices of differentiation do not settle an absolute and final animal/human distinction, but at various points in time constitute as non-human women, children, and Indigenous and other cultures and communi ties. These practices thereby serve to justify violence and oppression against humans and animals (Calarco, 2008). Compassion in terms of pity and pathos has failed to establish an ethics of duty or obligation to animal justice or animal rights. The solution for Derrida is deconstruction, and the scrutiny of how we think and construct our lives, and for what purpose. The animal in general, what is it? What does that mean? Who is it? To what does that 'it' correspond? To whom? Who responds to whom? Who responds in and to the common, general and singular name of what they thus blithely call the 'animal?' Who is it that responds? The reference made by this what or who regarding me in the name of the animal, what is said in the name of the animal when one appeals to the name of the animal, that is what needs to be exposed, in all its nudity, in the nudity or destitution of whoever, opening the page of an autobiography, says 'here I am'. 'But as for me, who am I (following)?' (Derrida, 2002: 418). Derrida seeks to achieve lesser or least violence by moving us closer to recog nising the singularity of animals. We should say 'an' animal not 'animals', they should be spoken by name in a 'mad rationality' that prevents us from forgetting who they are and makes way for compassion. In proliferating how we speak about and name animals we can exercise unconditional hospitality, welcome without reserve or calculation, make place, internalise, make no judgement and even eat them in a 'kind of asceticism' (Derrida cited in Lawlor, 2007: 105). Below is a condensed version of Lawlor's (2007: 109) methodology for compassion. A seven stage 'recipe' which engages our passions so we might feel, think and act differently. 1 Recognise that we do not have the capacity to keep others out, so let them in, in their singularity; 2 Make the admittance unconditional, unconditional friendship, uncondi tional forgiveness; 3 Name every other in its singularity recognising that naming does violence to singularity; 4 Recognise that the violence of the name must be done with the least amount of violence; 5 Step back, show restraint, let them be protected by the name, to be left alone; Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="12">136 JULIE MATTHEWS 6 Recognise that this 'recipe' is necessary but not sufficient, because there is still violence and suffering; and 7 Feel compassion, have passion with com-passion, recognise that animals and all 'others' fear in the face of death, that death comes from me, you, us or them. Like Derrida, Haraway (2008) challenges the anthropocentrism of western philosophy and its ontological human-animal distinctions. Compassion, following Haraway is not to be found in the dispassionate meditations of philosophy, but in the impassioned grounded relationalities of everyday physical interactions, play and joy: 'Species interdependence is the name of the worlding game on Earth' and it involves response, respect and learning to pay attention: I am who I become with companion species, who and which make a mess out of categories in the making of kin and kind (Haraway, 2006: 102). Haraway (2006) quite rightly observes that Derrida's refusal to speak for 'the other' leads him to underestimate the importance of considering alternative engagements with animals found in the work of ethologists and animal behav iour scientists who live and breathe the question of the animal. Since Derrida's intention was not to give voice to the voiceless, the oversight does not render his work illegitimate. Indeed, it can be argued that Haraway's account of in terspecies connectivity and plurality overestimates the magnitude of human/ companion species receptivity. Unfortunately not all species are able to qualify as companions and judging by our ever-increasing capacity to destroy non companion species and demolish habitats, it would appear that not all humanity has the capacity to pay attention. GREEN POSTCOLONIALISM (POSTCOLONIAL ECOCRITICISM) Our relations to animals have been subject to a massive transformation that far exceeds the monstrosities ofanything we have previously thought or practised. We have generated a new experience of compassion, animals live with us, alongside us and yet we have no need for care or consideration (Derrida, 2004). It turns out that for Derrida the only sufficient response to the magnitude of contemporary violence against animals is one that is avowedly insufficient. Not only must one question the problematic notion of'the animal' and how it is used oppositionally to define and delimit the equally problematic notion of 'the human' (Calarco, 2004), but one must learn new forms of address and compassion. The nascent field of postcolonial ecocriticism faces similar challenges and demands similar practices. Its task is to interrogate colonial depictions, the hierarchicalisation of life forms, the category of the human and how it is constructed against nature, Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="13">137 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL as well as the reimagining and reconfiguring of human place in nature (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010). Postcolonial ecocriticism recognises that the legacies of ongo ing inequality can only be addressed if the category of the human, in relation to animals and environment is also scrutinised. In addition investigation of history and contemporary range of animal-human relations is necessary to realise their centrality to the generation of old and new conceptions of post imperialist and environmentally based community: ... a re-imagining and reconfiguration of the human place in nature necessitates an interrogation of the category of the human itself and of the ways in which the construction of ourselves against nature - with the heirarchisation of life forms that construction implies - has been and remain complicit in colonialist and racist exploitation from the time of imperial conquest to the present day (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010: 6). Postcolonial ecocritism underlines the politics at large in images and stories while at the same time seeking to occupy and refigure them to sustain a pedagogi cal practice that places and displaces, connects and disconnects animal-human relations. Postcolonial ecocriticism is interested in the colonial and imperial foundations of environmental practices in colonising and colonised societies. It understands not only that the colonised were invariably treated as part of the non-human world, but that they were framed within a western perspective of the natural environment, rending cultural and environmental reclamation and reconstruction problematic. European colonisation was premised on the con viction that non-Europeans were bestial and savage and required a civilising mission (Huggan and Tiffin, 2007,2010). This was of course ironic, since, many non-European cultures accommodated alternative and relational understandings of animals and the environment (Huggan and Tiffin, 2007). The inseparability of anthropocentrism and colonisation is the fundamental point of the emergent field of postcolonial ecocriticism (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010). Following the pioneering ecofeminist work of Plumwood (1993), Huggan and Tiffin (2010) underline the naturalisation of anthropocentrism and its pri oritisation of human species over all others. Complemented by Eurocentrism, colonisation established a rationale that justified European invasion and coloni sation. Historically the Western definition of 'human' has depended on the pres ence of the not-human, uncivilised, animal and animalistic, and this naturalised view justified European colonisation and Eurocentrism. Indigenous societies were not only regarded as 'flora and fauna', but drawn over time into western environmental world views. The environmental impact of invasion, settlement and western environmental attitude was exacerbated by wide spread ecosystem change brought about by the transport of animals, plants and people throughout the empires of Europe (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010: 6). It is not therefore a matter of deconstructing the means by which oppression and inequality are brought into being through language. What is required are Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="14">138 JULIE MATTHEWS understandings of how different languages enable different historical and cultural understandings and knowledge; and how these were, and continue to be, deployed at particular times in the creation of 'art' (Huggan and Tiffin, 2010). What is required is an address to the real worlds we inhabit and how these are depicted. It is interesting to note that Merleau-Ponty in his last three lecture series (1956-1960) on 'The Concept of Nature' argued for a revised phenomenologi cal understanding of nature which also recognised that perceiving nature from within nature comprises a creative endeavour fuelled by interpretations which meditate on our 'strange kinship' with animals. In seeking to understand 'how things hang together', Merleau-Ponty underlines a kinship based on shared em bodiment: 'we have bodies that relate to their environments and to other bodies' and 'differences between life-styles or styles of being' (Oliver, 2007: 18). The interpretive imagining of this strange kinship of embodiment and styles of being has the capacity to recover something of the mystery and magic of science and biology (Oliver, 2007). As Oliver observes: ...to follow Merleau-Ponty's revisioning of science as a creative endeavour mo tivated by the infinite mysteries of life and fulfilled by on-going interpretations of the between, the chiasmus and the kinship, that together signal both the gap and the intertwining between living creatures as a fold in life itself that is part of the mystery of life (Oliver, 2007: 20). CONCLUSION Despite disavowals of the violence that humans cannot help but do to all plan etary life forms, including ourselves, it is apparent that we are poised on the precipice of climatic changes which will undoubtedly bring about major social, economic, political and cultural upheaval. We are responsible and we must give account of ourselves. A compassionate geography understands and seeks to act to reduce violence and suffering. In accounting for how and why we have come to this position it respects all beings while at the same time calling 'being-ness' into question. In this a compassionate geography threatens the established and familiar (dis)order of things to comprise an imaginative, sensitive occupation of the spaces and places we inhabit and denote. It is in the depiction of places in relation to beings that the practical and political implications of a more-than-human come to fruition. Compassionate geography goes to the core of disciplinarity beyond accounts of places and people and requires an address that takes accounts of life forms and historical processes constituting geographical systems. I have suggested here that this task requires the capacity to imagine and act ourselves into a world of lesser violence and that green postcolonialism may be able to point us towards a literature able to proliferate place-based narratives which understand, imagine and enact a Environmental Values 21.2</page><page sequence="15">139 COMPASSION, GEOGRAPHY AND THE QUESTION OF THE ANIMAL different diversity, spatiaiity, physicality and relationaiilty. In drawing on old and new knowledge and imaginaries as well as on locational and historical culpability we may find the means to examine how historical and cultural forms of knowledge represent, divide, differentiate and unite the socio-physical world of cultures and creatures. It might appear to us that human knowledge, intellect and capacity to think and reason merits the highest form of admiration and respect. What we know of ourselves is, however, a located, place-based earthly product of human ex istence and will vanish as soon as the material conditions rendering it possible cease to exist. In some remote corner of the universe, poured out and glittering in in numerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. That was the haughtiest and most mendacious minute of 'world history' - yet only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die. One might invent such a fable and still not have illustrated sufficiently how wretched, how shadowy and flighty, how aimless and arbitrary, the human intellect appears in nature (Nietzsche cited in Calarco, 2008: 39). Sooner or later we clever animals have to die. We might note that in hastening our own demise, we are even less clever than we think; the problem for Derrida is that we continue to script our 'clever being' such that all else becomes a target of violence. A final and somewhat misanthropic point to make is that while the future of our species and others is at risk, what is different about climate change, over all other spectres of annihilation, is that the world itself is not at stake. It is just us. It is mainly humans who are at risk. The world, the biosphere, the environment, those creatures who survive us will go on without us. I am ever hopeful that we have the capability to speak, imagine and act ourselves into a new world of lesser violence. But then again if we are unable to affect, space and story through the reoccupation and refiguring of animals, fauna, creatures, beasts, wildlife and 'us' - if the clever animals have to die, perhaps the not-so clever ones will remain.
