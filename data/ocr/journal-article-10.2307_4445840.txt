<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bio-Logical Dissection of Rhetorica flora John R. Jungck JACK RYAN OF EL PASO Community College has re- ferred to campers' litter as Campa flora. I would like to discuss how nonmajors taking biology courses can be shown how to recognize litter in scientific prose, or Rhe- torica flora. I believe that developing the skills for critical analysis of scientific literature, of the type that most nonmajors will be exposed to as citizens concerned with the ramifications of science, is as an important part of a biology course for them as biological knowledge itself. In fact, many biologi- cal principles, especially evolutionary reasoning, can be introduced in this format. Because nonmajors will seldom have the substantive background to evaluate facts reported in a magazine, newspaper, or television or radio documentary, their sub- jective reaction to the validity of such a report can be based on more objective criteria if they are able to recog- nize teleology, anthropomorphism, tautologies, argu- ments from authority, and obvious types of illogical conclusions. Their subjective opinion will also depend on their understanding of the somewhat loose distinctions between facts, empirical generalizations, postulates of a theory, hypotheses, predictions, theories, and laws. Fur- thermore, an understanding of the role of controls, of the difference between causation and correlation, and of the nature of scientific proof are integral aspects of an analy- sis. Finally, the ability of students to recognize the paradigm of the author of the report or of the original investigator whose work is being reported can also affect subjective judgments. Teleology Teleology can frequently be one of the most invidi- ously subtle kinds of errors to recognize. This seems to be especially true in the arena of evolutionary discussions. George Williams (1966) has stated: In discussions of the role of adaptation in the survival of populations one often finds statements to the effect that selection caused certain developments because they were necessary. It is often difficult to distinguish semantic and con- ceptual, but I believe that there are common conceptual falla- cies such as might be illustrated by this statement: The white coat of the polar bear is necessary for the stalking of game in the snowy regions in which it lives. The whiteness was favored by selection because darker individ- uals were unable to survive. I would correct this argument by substituting advantageous for necessary in the first sentence, and by adding the words as well to the end of the second. Ecological or physiological necessity is not an evolutionary factor, and the development of an adaptation is no evidence that it was necessary to the survival of the species. The beauty of William's statement is that it explains both why teleology is unnecessary (and improper) and how teleology can be avoided, and I might note, it does so in language that can easily be understood by the non- philosopher. My students are encouraged to look everywhere for examples of teleology. If they scan just a few articles in Time, Newsweek, their newspaper, or even their own textbook, they are usually able to collect a barrage of The author is assistant professor of biology at Clarkson College, Potsdam, New York 13676.

For example, here are a few they found: This Amazon species [the Polyergus ant] is built to fight, their sharp mandibles able to puncture bodies of other ants. (Science Digest. September 1975) Mitosis, then, is a mechanism insuring genetic continuity. (BSCS Yellow Version) In Darwinian terms, animals compete for the unwitting purpose of getting as many of their genes as possible into the next generation. (Time, May 10,1976) Plants are beautifully designed for reproduction," says Richard Mahoney, "but their efficiency as providers of food is just lousy. They never had any intention of feeding human- ity." (Time, May 31,1976) By using such passages, students quickly learn to be suspicious whenever the words "purpose," "goal," "must," "to," "for," etc., show up in an explanation of a biological phenomenon. Just to protect myself from those readers who are members of S.P.C.D.H., the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Dead Horses (Koestler 1968), I would like to note that the quoted violations in this paper are primarily articles that have appeared in the past few years. Some students who ardently believe in teleology or orthogenesis have a difficult time seeing why they should avoid the use of statements that explicitly or im- plicitly invoke purposeful behavior. About all one can do in these circumstances is note that in science we attempt to explain phenomena in the minimal number of observa- tional and operational components without invoking parameters not susceptible to experimentation. Even tele- ologists, like the biologists Francisco Ayala and Conrad Hilton Waddington, or the popular writer Arthur Koestler, usually end with an understated position such as that of MacLeod (1957): I am not arguing that science should suddenly have a change of heart and reinstate Aristotle's final causes. The physical sciences have done fairly well without them. The biological sciences seem to be admitting formal causes with- out yielding to final causes, although some biologists are striv- ing manfully to reduce formal to material and efficient causes. What I do suggest is that the social sciences, dealing as they do with the very phenomena that invite a teleological ex- planation, should not scurry away from these phenomena but should look at them fearlessly and be prepared to think in more global terms. I think my strong advocacy of "material and efficient" explanations is an important counter-atitudinal position to that which students are frequently exposed to in psy- chology, anthropology, sociology, political science, re- ligion, and Thomistically-oriented philosophy courses. Anthropomorphism While anthropomorphic language is usually much easier for students to recognize than teleological lan- guage, they have much greater difficulty in understanding why it is improper scientifically. In fact, Ashley Montagu and Edward Darling (1970) believe that it is entirely proper because: Since human beings have the minds of man, it follows that their thought is, as the phrase goes, anthropomorphic. It is difficult to understand why the term should carry a deroga- tory undertone or a suggestion of ingenuousness: if we had the minds of fish, we would think in a fishlike manner and one could call our thinking piscatorial. But there should be nothing umbrageous about it. No apologies required. Thus to the intended canard "Now you're falling into anthropo- morphic thinking," one replies quite reasonably, "Could anything be more natural?" Even though Michael T. Ghiselin has vigorously at- tacked anthropomorphism in his Economy of Nature and the Evolution of Sex (1974), his earlier book, The Tri- umph of the Darwinian Method (1969), is one long apologia explaining why Darwin's metaphorical language was not "genuine anthropomorphism." However, if we look at some typically anthropomor- phic statements, their scientific meaninglessness is ap- parent; for example, So as not to lose his way, the scout ant lays down a scent trail, and, finding the column, quickly moves down the line, touching antennas briefly with each of his fellow ants." (Science Digest, September 1975) Consequently, the pack will kill for fun: rabbits, chickens and deer. When they maul some schoolchildren, a dog hunt is launched that includes hunters with personalities as varied as the hunted. (New York Times Review. May 30, 1976) The Islands of Langerhans, secreting insulin, take care of the metabolism of carbohydrates and ward off diabetes. (New York Times Magazine, May 30, 1976) Attributions of volition to instinctual behavior and inani- mate objects or of human qualities to other species may reflect our egocentricism; nevertheless, they violate the principle of parsimony, are not heuristic in natural sci- ence, and are not susceptible to scientific investigation (Bernatowicz 1958). We see this especially in taxonomy: Anthropocentrism has a remarkably broad range of conse- quences, ranging from strip mining to whale killing. In folk taxonomy it leads us to make fine distinctions among crea- tures close to us and very broad ones for more distant, "simple" organisms. Every novel bump on a tooth defines a new kind of mammal, but we tend to lump all single-celled creatures together as "primitive" organisms. Nonetheless, specialists are now arguing that the most fundamental dis- tinction among living things is not between "higher" plants and animals; it is a division within single-celled creatures- bacteria and blue green algae on the one side, other groups of algae and protozoans (amoebae, paramecia, and so on) on the other. And neither group, according to Whittaker and Margulis, can be fairly called either plant or animal; we must have two new kingdoms for single-celled organisms. (Gould 1976) RHETORICA FLORA 143</page><page sequence="3">Students found that the usual excuse for anthropomor- phism, that it is more "emotive" (Penoyer 1976), simply did not hold when put to a test in which they compared the narratives of William Conrad and Lorne Greene of two TV nature series. Furthermore, the subject of anthro- pomorphism stimulated students to initiate discussion on the uniqueness of humans, which served as a convenient vehicle to introduce experiments and observations about language development by Washoe and Lana, self-aware- ness differences between macaques and chimps, and tool-making as well as tool-using activities of chimps. Tautologies Some biologists are so concerned about arguments that the basic principles of ecology and evolution are tautological (Peters 1976) that they are somewhat self- conscious about developing the skill of their students to recognize tautological logic. However, if these accusations are ever to be satisfactorily settled, students must under- stand what is being debated. Circular reasoning is more difficult to find in cursory examinations of popular re- ports, but seems to crop up very frequently in antievo- lutionary articles. Here are a few examples: A carbon dating laboratory cannot measure time. It can only determine the present level of radioactive carbon activ- ity in a sample. The radiocarbon age reported for this sample is the amount of time which would be required for an activity which has characterized the atmosphere in recent times to diminish by natural spontaneous radioactive decay to the level which has been determined for the sample.... Accord- ing to the limitations on historical time which are established in the Bible, the examples presented in the preceding para- graph would be expected to have an historical or real time age no greater than in the order of six thousand years and no less than approximately four thousand years. The radio- carbon data for these samples (dated as being greater than 40,000 years old, my inclusion) may then be taken to indi- cate that between Creation Week and the Flood the atmos- phere of this planet contained a negligible amount of radio- active carbon." (Signs of the Times, June 1973) "But this [circulatory migration] would be preposterous, might the evolutionist say-no bird would be that crazy. But why, then, didn't the Terns stop when they found warmer climates? Why did they keep right on going, to the frigid shores of Antarctica to "winter" there?.. . EIGHT THOUSAND MILES, JUST TO TURN AROUND? That's getting ridiculous! Obviously, migrations CANNOT be the result of "natural selection." (Armstrong and Kroll 1968) Back in the mid-50s, a playwright named Robert Ardrey was standing with Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, looking at a beautiful pink flower. Leakey waved his hand; the flower dissolved into a swarm of tiny pink insects. A few minutes later they all resettled on the bare twig, crawled busily over one another's backs-and again turned themselves into the imitation flower, whose blossoms ranged through delicate shades of pink to unripe green. This little insect is called the flattid bug. And there is no way to explain how hundreds of them evolved this ability to imitate a flower-at least, no "imechanical," Darwinian way. You have to make the assumption that the flattid bug simply wanted to imitate a flower in order to preserve its life, and not only learned to do so, but also managed to pass on its learn- ing genetically to its children-which, accrording to the Dar- winians, is an impossibility, because the mind cannot influ- ence the genes. (The Illustrated London News, November 1970) Circular reasoning of the types committed above are frequently tricky for students because they are not just like the classic one sentence textbook statement where synonyms of common etymological origin are used to define one another. Nevertheless, the fallaciousness of conclusions that are already stated in some alternative form within the premise is usually grasped by students after a few examples are presented. Once students appreciate the nature and the inherent lack of content of such simple tautologies, then the accu- sation that biological principles are tautologous can be discussed. Before considering evolutionary and ecologi- cal laws, I present Bertrand Russell's 1948 statement: The laws of physics themselves are partly tautologies, but in their most important parts they are hypotheses that are found to explain great numbers of subordinate inductions. Even stronger statements of this sort have been made; for instance, Hans Reichenbach (1968) said: Logical necessity and emptiness go together and make up the analytic, or tautological nature of logic. All purely logical statements are tautologies. These two quotes bother students because they seem to contradict what they have just learned. I explain the paradox with an anology I have heard ascribed to Gilbert N. Lewis. If we look at a helix end-on, its planar projection is a circle. However, if the helix is viewed perpendicular to its axis, the linear dimension becomes apparent. Lewis said that scientific statements can be reduced to a tauto- logical form (a circle); however, when they are used "to explain great numbers of subordinate inductions," then the linearity (helicity) of the reasoning also becomes apparent. Examples from physics, chemistry, and biology can all be used to illustrate this point. In physics, the ideal gas laws can be derived from statements to the effect that ''gases are fluids which have neither independent shape or volume, but tend to expand indefinitely" (Websters Dictionary 1961). Alternatively, the second law of ther- modynamics can be derived from such statements as "All bodies which fall have mass" or "Any raised ball eventu- ally will fall" (with special thanks to Henry Bent, author of The Second Law). Neither of these look very much like their alternative, familiar formulations: PV nRT and A/G =A/H - TA/S, respectively. I like to give the following analogous situation from biology. If we begin with the statement "Raspberry eyed flies are less fit than red eyed flies because fewer will survive," then the tautological equivalence between fit- ness and survival is obvious. However, by simple deriva- tion using simplifying assumptions, just as one does in 144 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, MARCH 1977</page><page sequence="4">the derivation of either the ideal gas law or the second law of thermodynamics, we can show that: qn = qo (fig. 1). 1+nqo Furthermore, we can cite the experimental evidence of Merrell (1953) that this quantitative prediction is consist- ent with experimental evidence. Thus, the criterion for judging the scientific merit of tautologies is: Does a circular statement lead to an ex- planation of a great number of subordinate inductions that are amenable to empirical analysis? PV= NRT AG =AH-TA Q = QN 1 N "GASES ARE "ANY RAISED "RASPBERRY EYED FLUIDS WHICH BALL WILL FLIES ARE LESS HAVE NEITHER EVENTUALLY FIT THAN RED EYED INDEPENDENT FALL.

"The laws of physics themselves are partly tautolo- gies, but in their most important parts they are hypotheses that are found to explain great numbers of subordinate inductions." -Bertrand Russell, 1948. Ergo Propter Hoc Fallacies Among the many other types of improper reasonings one could discuss, I feel that the post hoc fallacy deserves the most attention. It is one of the most serious yet com- mon of all errors of logical inference. Ergo propter Hoc (post hoc) fallacies are the usual source of confusion between causation and correlation and they also can be used to infer the need for controls. One of the most com- mon situations in which students deal with such reason- ing is in reports on the etiologx of diseases or the effec- tiveness of cures. Bruno Bettelheim (1967), for example, has reasoned that since some autistic children improve when they are shownl considerable love and given emo- tional support, the cause of autism must be the lack of affection and emotional support. Medical history is loaded with examples in which the cause of a disease was not due to the lack of a sufficient amount of the cure; e.g., Wilson's disease leads to accumulation of toxic amounts of copper, which can" be decreased by addition of the synthetic drug, penicillamine. Consider also the following: One of the most impressive cases involved a patient with a cancerous kidney. Except for a small portion that had ap- parently been missed by the radio field, the entire tumor was destroyed." (Time May 24, 1976) The conclusion, although only suggested, is surely unwarranted without controls for several variables. The students do not need to feel such statements are neces- sarily wrong, only that a sufficient degree of critical doubt should be retained. Extrapolations from a single or only a few instances can be extremely dangerous as can be easily illustrated by demographic predictions based on too short a time interval. Similarly, correlations are worth- while because they lead us to seek causal relationships; however, correlations can exist totally without causative connections due to chance. Furthermore, the existence of a single instance of noncorrelation can be used to rule out one-to-one causation. "In other words, if a given conse- quence (e.g., bad luck) does not always follow a presum- able causal antecedent (e.g., the breaking of a mirror), then the consequence cannot be said to be caused by the antecedent event" (Lastrucci 1963). Two topics on which I have found that students will enjoy arguing about correlation and causation are vitamin C and the common cold and fiber in our diet and cancer of the colon. Both issues are ones on which many stu- dents have had strong enough preconceptions that many of them have adjusted their eating habits accordingly. Such commitment usually preconditions them to oppo- site viewpoints and we are able to dissect what caused their subjective decision. Impossibility, Authority, and Name Calling Although the triplet combination of arguments from authority, arguments re impossibility, and name-calling are easily discernible to students once they have been pointed out, their emotive force remains for most stu- dents except for those considered almost cynical by their peers. This triplet has obvious power, as is seen by the success of evangelistic literature: Then we have to consider that various birds migrate in different fashions and that each seems to respond to a dif- ferent stimulus. All this then had to evolve TOGETHER! We're talking about mathematical odds which would be im- possible. (Plain Truth, 1968) According to their calculations, based on the assumption that random mutational changes were involved in the evolu- tionary process, a vastly longer time would have been re- quired for evolutionary origins than the several billions of years postulated as having been available. (American Biology Teacher 32:495) RHETORICA FLORA 145</page><page sequence="5">Mathematical improbability statements are subject to a large degree of subjectivity, as recognized by Ovendon (1976): Robert Temple is not the first non-astronomer to be misled by calculations of the 'probability' of life on other worlds, which are simply the prejudices of the respective writers dressed up in a spurious numerical precision. The other two kinds of arguments can be just as didac- tic, but usually the fallacy of their reasoning is more evi- dent as this example illustrates. Thus the growing fear in our cities, the breakdown of families, and the widespread abuse of drugs can be traced largely to the theory of evolution. So, likewise, can many of our ecological problems.... Evolutionists.. .have repeatedly asserted that the chief end of life is to reproduce.... This low estimate, we suggest, has contributed significantly to the wanton destruction of our forests and wildlife." (Signs of Our Times. June 1973) Surprisingly, such verbal barrages and inuendoes by association are not limited to popular literature. As a case in point, I refer you to the "academic vigilant- ism" of Science for the People against sociobiology. In a privately sold bulletin called "Against Sociobiology," Science for the People wrote: "For if our behavior is genetically determined, then efforts to alleviate social problems must fail, since genes are beyond control. Further, genes are beyond anyone's responsibility, so we need not search for the human causes of hierarchies or genocide. It is in this sense that we associate sociobiologists with Spencer, Lorenz, Ardrey, and Jensen. All would have us believe that our behavior is biologically determined and therefore immutable. All rest their conclusions on an implicit political conception of the proper social order. In so doing they turn us away from the true causes and valid solutions to social problems. Their oral statements at the last AAAS Annual Meeting in Boston (1976) were even stronger in that the associa- tion with genocide was directly linked to Hitler. E. 0. Wilson (1976) has responded: The cause of the Fallacy of the Political Consequent is the failure to appreciate adequately that scientific theories and political ideas are both complex and tenuously linked, and that political ideas are shaped in good part by personal judge- ments lying outside the domain of scientific evaluation. Thus, it seems that science will continue to use its language to explain and record. That is in part true; but language is also used to conceal, to hide, to obscure, and to protect.... to mislead and to obfuscate. . . . to soothe and pacify, to arouse and irritate, .... and for many other purposes other than sheer communication. The evidence is on every hand. (Montagu and Darling 1970) We need to show our students that scientists are hu- man in the whole range of political, religious, and emo- tional commitments. We cannot just tell this to our students; in order for them to really appreciate such varie- ties they need actually to dissect debates that occur in the public press such as those above. Scientific Proof and Laws Karl Popper has defended the proposition that science can only disprove hypotheses. Science cannot prove a hypothesis; it can only show that the evidence collected is consistent with a hypothesis. Considerable confusion has been perpetrated in many scientific reports because of a lack of understanding of this basic nature of scientific advance. If science can only refute and not verify, then the loose distinctions among hypothesis, theory, and law are usually dependent on time and convention. Lewontin (1971) has shown that this has led many popular writers to impute different degrees of confidence to the laws of gravitation and the theory of evolution. "It is interesting to speculate what the effect on the Texas and California Boards would be if we talked about the "laws of evolu- tion" but "Newton's theory of gravitation." Until an international poll of all scientists determines consensus on whether X is a theory or a law, the decision will always be in the hands of the particular author to choose the label he prefers and, it is hoped, justify it. The situation is further compounded by the lack of distinction between theories and empirical generaliza- tions. A good case in point is that the cell theory is actu- ally an empirical generalization. Such arbitrary labels which have lasted eons in the history of science have strong connotations for the nonscientist. Consider the implicit strength inferred by the phrase: the "central dogma" of molecular genetics. In order to appreciate some of this confusion, note how ardent journalists can use these loose distinctions for their own purposes: In this article, you'll read of some of the most astounding creatures alive-and read of the UPSETTING FACTS WHICH bewilder and confuse evolutionists. But first, re- member-evolution is a THEORY. When To Alter a Theory It should be an honest and correct method of research that each theory is altered to admit new facts; but not so in the case of evolution. You see, a scientist first may observe certain "things" which he calls "Phenomena." Wary of calling anything by the level of "truth" or even a facsimile, such as "fact," the evolutionist uses the more modern, acceptable term, "data," in his research. Postulating that such and such is "so," based upon observ- ing certain phenomena-the scientist collects his "data." Facts. There is a LAW, however-and it is a moral and truthful law that, whenever a theory or postulate is contrary to ob- served and proven FACTS, then that theory MUST BE ALTERED TO ADMIT SUCH NEW FACTS. The theory must always ALLOW THE NEW EVIDENCE. But if evidence-if FACTS-DIRECTLY CONTRADICT the theory, then the theory MUST BE DISCARDED AS UNTRUE! As we have shown in many past articles-this is not done in evolutionary thinking. Rather, mountainous piles of evi- dence, facts, data, and measurable, observable, provable TRUTHS are swept aside, ignored, or glossed over-as the 146 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, MARCH 1977</page><page sequence="6">FACTS are continually altered to fit the theory! Believe it or not, evolution is one of the greatest HOAXES ever foisted on an unsuspecting world -and it has come to deeply permeate the whole of modern education, and with it, society. (Plain Truth. July 1968) No provable living chain of life forms exists from amoeba to man, as the theory of evolution postulates. Such a pro- posed chain of life forms is an assumption or a philosophic conclusion, but neither a scientific nor a biblical fact. (Plain Truth, June. July 1974) Obviously, nonscientists are bound to be confused by such loose distinctions among facts, postulates, observa- tions, inferences, theories, generalizations, and laws. Even within the mainstream of science, Robert Heinlein's 1970 comments seem appropriate: William of Occam's Razor. It's a name for a principle in logic; whenever two hypotheses both cover the facts, use the simpler of the two. When a conventional scientist has to strain his orthodox theories all out of shape, 'til they resemble something thought up by Rube Goldberg, to account for unorthodox phenomena, he's ignoring the principle of Occam's Razor. It's simpler to draw up a new hypothesis to cover all the facts than to strain an old one that never in- tended to cover the non-conforming data. But scientists are more attached to their theories than they are to their wives and families." The same notion can be found in a professional journal in reference to Gilbert N. Ling's association-induction hypothesis, which is so vigorously attacked by membrane physiologists (McElhaney 1975; Kolata 1976): The history of ideas shows that whenever a monistic con- cept is developed which connects previously unconnected aspects of a large field in a powerful unifying configuration, another monistic concept soon emerges which is its anti- thesis. The coexistence of these opposing configurations is intolerable; the partisans on both sides, utilizing the "either- or" weapon of Occam's razor, attack with data. In the ensu- ing struggle evidence accumulates so that one concept is victorious and becomes generally accepted; the other is re- jected. As time passes and increased understanding of the overall system is achieved, it then becomes clear that the ac- cepted concept has been based upon an overly simple model of the field encompassed. In the context of new information some ideas from both poles of opposition are now found to be valid, some invalid. In effect, a resolution of the conflict is achieved, as the also and the and of pluralism replaces the monolithic dichotomy of either-or. (Hechter 1965) If we enter into such discussions of the fluid nature of scientific credibility, I believe we also are able to show to our nonmajors that the real excitement in science is pur- suing the resolution of such conflicts. Problem solving can be more enticing than simply regurgitating old "facts." It usually totally surprises students that something as coldly factual as membrane function or the mechanism of oxi- dative-phosphorylation can conjure up so much ill will amongst investigators. Furthermore, students are amazed that fights based on very subjective criteria have charac- terized science as far back as recorded. Steven Bush's article (1974) entitled "Should the History of Science Be Rated X?" is thoroughly enjoyable in this regard. Many of my colleagues have indicated to me that all these issues are airing our dirty linen to the public and thus degrading the image of science. Although I have somewhat ambiguous feelings about their criticisms, I believe that the "sacred cow" approach in the past has contributed significantly to the loss of confidence in sci- entists. Let the merit of scientific conclusions stand the same scrutiny of rational logic that all other issues in the public forum must meet before acceptance. Conclusion In order to enable students to judge rationally the merit of a scientific conclusion that will affect citizens' lives, courses for them need to examine typical flaws in report- ing. Rhetoric has powerful emotive force in our decision- making process; the ability to dissect the language of re- porting science critically is a sine qua non for deciding on the merit of the conclusions. What I am pleading for is something Jean Rostand (1960) wishes that he could give to the citizen, namely, healthy scepticism: Since then I have become a self-made skeptic, and have slowly come to appreciate the fact that many a book consists of nothing but lies, that entire libraries are devoted to the works of impostors, and that the most intelligent and best- informed of men do not always talk the least nonsense or make the least mistakes. I have learned that no fact is ever reported just as it happened, since however truthful and dis- interested he may be, every witness is prone to unconscious fabrication. Above all, I have learned to suspect those very slight and unconscious modifications which can so twist a 'fact' that it becomes something quite different. If only this valuable acquisition, scepticism, could be handed to others on a platter! Alas, each one of us has to ac- quire it for himself, and to bear the taunts of those who will for ever accuse him of being a doubting Thomas. References BERNATOWICZ, A. J. 1958.

ENCROACHMENT ON ARCTIC MAMMALS The effects of civilization's encroachment on high arctic mammals and their habitat will be studied by University of Montana scientists under a $233,000 grant received from the National Science Foundation. The 30-month study will focus on the polar bear, con- sidered a threatened species and protected under interna- tional law. This research is expected to evaluate the polar bear's future as it faces new incursions from oil explora- tion and pipeline and shipping activities. The Montana researchers will collaborate with Cana- dian, Danish, Norwegian and Soviet scientists in the proj- ect, which is expected to provide a plan for managing polar bears in the arctic basin and produce information for understanding man's pressure on bear populations. 154 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, MARCH 1977</page></plain_text>
