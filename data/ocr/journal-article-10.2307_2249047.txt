Second edition, with a Supplement on the Commentaries of Proclus, Demy 8vo. I2S net. Slight alterations only have been made in the text and notes of the book as it appeared in 1go0, but the Appendix on the outlying subject of Gnosticism has, in view of recent research, been re-written, and in the Supplement on the Commentaries of Proclus, which is the feature of the new edition, a more cir- cumstantial account of the Athenian period of Neo-Platonism is given. The book thus receives the completion which the author felt was desirable, and it is his hope that he has been able to set before the reader an account of the principal commenstaries, bringing out their distinctive features and the new developments by which its finished form was given to the great system of philosophy initiated by Plotinus two centuries earlier. War Neuroses. By JOHN T. MACCURDY, M.D., Psych;atric Institute, Ward's Island, New York, Lecturer on Medical Psychology, Cornell University Medical School, New York. With a Preface by W. H. R. RIVERS, M. D. (Lond.), Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. Demy 8vo. 7s 6d net. " The book describes the experience of one with a long record of skilful investigation of the psycho- neuroses of civil life when brought into contact in British hospitals with the special forms of neurosis which are produced by the shocks and strains of warfare. The cases on which the book is based are not startling rarities especiallv selected to show features of scientific interest, but are characteristic straight- forward cases such as may be met with by the score in any hospital especially devoted to functional nervous disorders. The merit of the book lies, not in the nature of its material, but in the skill with which this material has been treated and the clearness with which the essential facts have been set down and utilised to illustrate the special problems presented by the neuroses of wvar. Dr MacCurdy's book is so written that any intelligent layman will be able to follow its essential lessons."-Extract from Dr River's Preface.
