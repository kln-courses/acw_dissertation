But, thou sayest, they are like the wine-god's holy priests, Who go from land to land in the holy night. Hölderlin, "Bread and Wine" Τ woke up one morning last spring remembering nothing of my dream except the long title of a poem: "Love Song To This Doomed Self-Destroying But So Beautifully Creative Spe- cies Of Which I Am A Member." If in waking life I were a poet, I would use my gift for words to write this poem; I would com- pose a lovesong dedicated to our species that would celebrate how splendid, how creative, how worthy of honor we have been. This poem needs to be written now. For if we die, if our species and most of the life with which we have shared this planet is destroyed, there will be no one left to mourn, no one with the capacity to remember us, to say how beautiful we were - no one to write the poem or to hear it. I believe the urgency of my longing for such a poem grows out of some particular recent conjunctions. It feels significant that just as my family was celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of our arrival in America from Nazi Germany, all of us throughout the world should be called to remember the nuclear explosions that had devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki forty years earlier. Christine Downing is a Professor of Religious Studies at San Diego State University and a member of the Senior Faculty at The California School of Professional Psychology. She is author of The Goddess: Mythological Images of the Feminine and is now working on a book about sisterhood. This article was presented as the memorial lecture at the annual meeting of the Society For Values in Higher Education in August 1985. 301</page><page sequence="2">302 SOUNDINGS It seems eerily appropriate that my winter journey to Egypt, a place associated with the beginnings of human history, was fol- lowed by a trip in the spring to Nagasaki, a place which warns about the ending of that history. In another sense the poem would echo familiar themes of my adult life. I have thought often in recent months of a meeting that took place shortly after the end of World War II with a young man of my own age, a German who had directly exper- ienced those revelations of what human beings can perpetrate and can suffer from which my family's escape had protected me. "How on the other side of all that," I wanted him to tell me, "can one still live as human being?" "By showing that it is still possible to live an ordinary human life, to raise a family in an ordinary way," he said. The poem I imagine would most probably be written by a woman. That there is a woman's voice, in poetry, in psychol- ogy, in theology, is something that keeps getting clearer to me as the years go on. I had occasion recently to review an autobi- ographical essay I'd written while I was in graduate school. It was fascinating to reread this ancient manuscript, to discover the ways in which the young woman who wrote it is like and unlike the woman I take myself to be today. What struck me most was the section where I wrote, "Perhaps because I am a woman, the issues that seem most important are the ones in which I am personally involved," and then went on to describe how a social vision that began with the concrete demands of family life radiated to concerns about racial injustice, nuclear war, the environment, third world poverty. The paper ended: "I want my children to understand what I am doing and why." Then, almost twenty-five years ago, I was far from any ex- plicit feminist consciousness. No one had yet coined the slo- gan, "The personal is the political" or "The political is the personal." But already I had a sense that my view might be different because it was a woman's view. It has since become self-evident to me that women do have access to a different vi- sion than men or, at least, that it is easier for women than for men to see through the prevailing vision which is so intricately related to the history of male dominance. This perspective is one I might never have discovered on my own. Only as women have begun talking about their experi-</page><page sequence="3">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 303 ence with one another have they become fully conscious of hav- ing been objects, not subjects, during the long period when male experience was taken as the norm of the human. Wo- men's talking to one another has taken many forms in the last two decades - informal intimate exchange, consciousness rais- ing groups, organized classes and symposia, articles and books, art - but always it has been the sharing of our vulnerability and pain, our confusions, hesitations and hopes, and our experi- ence of objectification that has enabled us to recognize our dis- tinctive vision. (Not suprisingly, what we see from the perspective of the objectified gender is at many points closely related to what is seen from the perspective of those objectified by race, class or sexual orientation.) Having now assumed the subject role, we find it necessary to name what is visible to us as women. Our new consciousness allows us to see much which has been hidden - including much which it might be easier not to know - but about which, having seen, one must speak out. My own awareness has been confirmed and clarified by the testimony of many other women, but recently I find myself par- ticularly indebted to Christa Wolf, the east German novelist, born less than a hundred miles from my birthplace a year or two earlier than I. I sense a deep affinity with this woman, Ger- man but not Jewish, whose life has been so different from mine and yet whose recent writing voices a vision and urgency more closely related to what I feel compelled to say than anything else I know. About two years ago Christa Wolf published a novel accom- panied by four essays in which she examines the figure of the mythic Greek heroine, Cassandra - the woman who saw what only a woman would see and was not believed. The novel's epigraph comes from Goethe: "This dark race is beyond help; for the most part you have to remain silent so as not to be con- sidered mad like Cassandra, when you prophesy what already lies outside the gate." Through Wolf's Cassandra we are made to participate in the pain of becoming a knowing subject, of seeing too much, of needing to speak out yet not expecting to be heard. Wolf wonders, "Where did Cassandra get the desire and strength to contradict her compatriots' vision?" She asks, "Does there exist an ominous right or duty to bear witness?"</page><page sequence="4">304 SOUNDINGS Cassandra's prophesying serves as a prototype for Wolf's own writing about the disastrous fate she sees ahead for her own people, us, humankind. I, too, must name my fear that we may be moving toward the death of our species and articulate my understanding of what has brought us to this point, though to help with my saying I will rely not on Cassandra but on an image from Egypt. When Troy's doom was sealed, Cassandra fled to the temple of Athene and clung desperately to the goddess's wooden image. Wolf, too, turns to Athene, the goddess of clear vision and ar- tistic power, to sustain her in this time of need. In the language of Greek mythology I would see my witnessing as inspired by Aphrodite, the goddess of love; but her Egyptian counterpart, Hathor (and Hathor's dark other self, Sekhmet) has come to seem even more the figure empowering me to say what I must say - and to say it with love. But before invoking Hathor and Sekhmet, I want to name our situation in terms not derived from mythology, and I want to explain why I believe the particular view of it which has taken hold of me is more available to women. When I was in graduate school studying theology I was al- ready uncomfortable with the hierarchically defined distinc- tions between the human and the natural, historical time and cyclical time, distinctions I was taught are central to biblical be- lief. I resisted the equation of human suffering and failure with sin and guilt. But my dis-ease was inchoate, inarticulate. I had no sense then that the radical separation of the human from nature was potentially disastrous in its consequences nor any suspicion that it represented a specifically masculine perspective. Because I have come to believe that both are true, I consider it vital to speak specifically about the cost of the dichotomy be- tween the human and the natural and about how it derives from some specifics of male development. What I have to say here is not original; it has been said before and in more carefully elaborated form by Dorothy Din- nerstein, Nancy Chodorov, and others. Both have learned much from Freud - and gone beyond him. They set out from the conviction that the beginning of self-aware identity is asso- ciated with separation from the mother and the discovery of</page><page sequence="5">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 305 gender difference. For the son the experience of separation is at the same time the experience of difference; his identity as a male means "not being female." (The daughter, on the other hand, experiences separation from another like herself; being other does not imply being different.) Freud describes how traumatic this discovery of their original dependence on an- other different from themselves is for young males to whom it discloses their vulnerability, their contingency and their fini- tude. "Castration anxiety" is his name for their fear of losing that which sets them apart. This fear, like all fears, masks a wish: the wish not to be separate, not to be different. To give in to that wish would be to lose one's identity. What being masculine really means is well nigh unbearable and so it is rein- terpreted. The experience of initial dependence is repressed and with it the original primacy of the female mother. Being male is made correlative with being human and being female comes to mean being a deficient, castrated male. Learning who we are by contrast is natural to sons as learn- ing who we are by analogy, by mirroring, by the discovery of differences so subtle that logic cannot encompass them, is natu- ral to daughters. The exaltation of difference and separation as virtues leads to a valuing of autonomy, heroic achievement, ego consciousness, rationality, abstraction, unity and permanence. All differences come to be cast in hierarchical terms: the supe- rior and the inferior, the dominant and the oppressed. Not surprisingly the correlation of identity and differentiation has issued in a focus on human identity as a trans-natural mode of being, and a valorization of history, the unique and novel, pro- gress and change. It is easy to criticize an analysis like the one just put forward as a psychological one which ignores equally salient sociologi- cal factors. However, the analysis is one that begins precisely with social experience. The historical development of the op- pression of the other (women, blacks, the poor) is a compli- cated and varied tale, but it has its origin in the developmental pattern just rehearsed. The gender that needs to dominate in order to feel real will come to dominate. The oppressed group, the inferior one, is also always regarded as less fully human, as less successfully differentiated from nature. As the human is to the natural, so the male is to the female, the white</page><page sequence="6">306 SOUNDINGS to the black, the capitalist to the proletarian. Women may re- sist that identification in anger - and, paradoxically, perhaps also celebrate it as giving us access to a healing relation to na- ture the white male has forfeited. Because the notion that the only way to respond to the differ- ent is to overcome or dominate it has led to making objects of women, it has been not surprisingly primarily women who have examined those distinctive elements in male development. Women see more easily how these perspectives have injured not only us but also men and the other lifeforms among which we live. Men (partly in response to feminist critique) have also become aware, sometimes painfully aware, of what their one- sided reliance on rationality and autonomy, power and achieve- ment, have done to them, to us, and to our world. That the patriarchal value system no longer has the taken for granted authority it once had may paradoxically reinforce those anxieties that inspired its creation in the first place. We try to fix the problem thus engendered with more of the same: we deal with the nuclear threat by building bigger bombs, with ecological imbalances by resorting to further, more sophisti- cated interventions. I share Christa Wolf's conviction that if women had had more voice during these last 3000 years our plight might not be so desperate. Not because we are pure or perfect, but because our earliest experiences are ones that foster in us a sense of affiliation and interdependence. As Wolf says, "It is not merely a dreadful, shameful and scandalous fact/or women that women were allowed to contribute virtually nothing to the culture we live in, officially and directly, for thousands of years; no, it is strictly speaking the weak point in our culture, which leads to its becoming self-destructive." But Wolf sees that blame and anger are beside the point, which is not to villainize men but to see better where we are and how we got here, to acknowledge the pain and the danger of our separation from the natural world and to recognize that there is no simple going back, no magic reunion. Even though I am a feminist and in recent years have chosen to focus my personal love on women, I continue to love men. I believe it is important to take into account the vulnerability and the anxiety that make otherness so fearful to them and that un-</page><page sequence="7">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 307 derlie their focus on achievement and autonomy. I know men as fellow humans and believe our perspectives represent com- plementary not contradictory realities. Women's early exper- iences of same as and separate from the mother may prepare us to view the differences between male and female in a less po- larized way. We may not as easily exaggerate and reify dissimi- larity. We may be able to respond to the differences creatively, to view them as enhancing our lives, not diminishing them. We might then come to participate in the other's vision as a corol- lary human possibility - with love and gratitude. The fears about identity and differentiation so emphatic in male psychology are fears women also experience, albeit per- haps not so intensely or so obsessively. In a culture long domi- nated by the male perspective, women's experience of these fears has inevitably also been amplified. Many of us have dis- covered to our chagrin that as women enter traditionally male worlds and take on traditionally male roles, we frequently take on competitiveness, aggressiveness, and impersonal objectivity. These perspectives may be exaggerated among males for whom separation from the mother is more traumatic, but they are integral to our bisexual species, part of us and not just them. The long period of human infantile dependence and our being conscious creatures make the tension between dependence and autonomy, merging and separation almost too much. The con- tingency of our origin, the known inevitability of our death, make our deep ambivalence about both separation and fusion the central problematic of human existence (as Otto Rank saw so clearly). If we are honest, we need to admit that modern feminism is itself the product of a particular phase of material- ist culture. It is no accident that just as our economy needed women to move out of the house, we should all find that we want to. Yet the need for feminism at this point in our culture is much more far-reaching than that. We are needed now be- cause our view of things is necessary to living this terminal phase in a whole way. Freud ended "Analysis Terminable and Interminable" with the observation that the last and most diffi- cult task in an analysis, in an individual life, is integrating the despised feminine aspect, overcoming one's misogyny, one's resistence to the passive or receptive attitude indispensible in</page><page sequence="8">308 SOUNDINGS so many life situations. Now, I believe, this most difficult task confronts us as a species. My vision has a tragic dimension, for I see the experience of separation which forms male psychology as an aspect of human experience which we can do little to change. (I have much less confidence than do Dinnerstein or Chodorov that changing our childrearing practices so as to include fathers in dramatically more equal ways could suffice to avert the catastrophe I fore- see.) The conviction that there must be some resolution may be even harder for Americans to surrender than for Europeans. Perhaps it is my European origin that leads me to agree with Wolf that there may be no resolution and that where we find ourselves now may have been determined very far back. "What I ask myself and you," she writes, is: "Was it necessary that man should come to stand 'alone' before Nature - opposite Nature, not in it? ... Were there cross- roads and turning points where humanity - that is European &amp; North American humanity, the inventors and carriers of techno- logical civilization - could have made different decisions, whose resultant course would not have been self-destructive? Was the foundation for future development laid down with the invention of the first weapons for the hunt, with their use against groups competing for food; with the transition from matriarchally struc- tured, less effective groups, to patriarchal, economically more effective ones? When proportions still commensurate with human experience were exceeded? Or was it laid down from the beginning?" In his beautiful poem, "Brooding," Eugênio Montale sug- gests a similar view: Probably evening is falling. . . . If it becomes clear the First Causes already contained the explosion of the ridiculous then we'll have to look elsewhere, though without success since the future already passed some time ago. I am no Cassandra; my question is a subtly and yet significantly different one from Wolf 's. What I ask myself and you is: "If it was laid down from the beginning, how can we most wholly live this end time bequeathed to us?" I want to emphasize what Wolf only intimates: that the very values which are self-destructive are also beautiful - worthy of our respect, our love and mourning, as those who have lived by</page><page sequence="9">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 309 them and who may also be destroyed by them are worthy of our compassion and honor. What is most beautiful in us humans, what is most distinctive about our species, may destroy us. Not something evil or accidental and eradicable but rather some- thing inherent in that combination of consciousness and fini- tude which characterizes human being - our longing to understand, to make, to transform, to perpetuate. It seems nearly inevitable that we should have believed ourselves tran- scendent to nature - and then have had to rediscover our con- tinued subservience to her. A return to nature or to the early stages of human history would not be possible or desirable. As Wolf says, the motto "Know Thyself" could not have occurred to any goddess in the undifferentiated age. On the other hand, it is also true that the equation of the feminine and the natural is a simplistic dichot- omy. It seems likely that women began culture, agriculture, though that discovery was probably understood as a participa- tion in natural processes rather than as an abrogation of them. The urges toward differentiated knowledge, rationality, mas- tery, and autonomy are precious urges. But because they have for these many millenia not been balanced by the equally pre- cious pulls toward intimacy, the concrete, and acceptance of the given, they may do us in. As Dinnerstein puts it, we now face the challenge of learning to reconcile our wish for 'T'ness with "our wish to survive as a species and the wish to enjoy the color, taste, texture and smell of our short individual lives." That women have a voice again cannot change what has hap- pened, but it may enable us to live what is still to happen differ- ently. It may enable us to face together that we human beings may bring about an end to the life of our species and to most of the other life on this beautiful planet. Perhaps through the bomb, perhaps through some more gradual irreparable trans- formation of the environment on which life depends. Perhaps not immediately, perhaps not even in our children's time, but very likely sometime, very likely too soon. That is painfully sad, but to me it is even sadder that we put all our energies into denying the possibility or into trying to avert or at least delay its realization. I value those valiant ef- forts to avert, but fear that they, too, serve as a kind of denial which may inhibit us from attending to another task: honoring</page><page sequence="10">310 SOUNDINGS who we have been and grieving that we may soon not be. And I wonder if our averting may not express the hubris that brought us here to begin with, the hubris of thinking we can know enough to comprehend the whole. As with Oedipus, what we do to avoid our fate may only make it more inevitable. I, too, know the superstitious fear that imagining brings it on, that Cassandra is responsible for Troy's doom. I, too, often feel that I can only bear to believe it might all end, if I can also believe that it won't if we respond rightly. But as a post- menopausal woman I have found that the most important per- sonal life task I now confront is learning how to die well (that is, how to live well in the face of my oncoming death); I have also come to see that the most important service I can now render to humankind may be encouraging us to think together about what dying well as a species might mean. I see us in a situation analogous to that of an individual suffering a terminal disease. We can put all our energies into looking for every pos- sible remedy or delay, so busy averting that we leave no time for celebrating what has been, mourning what will not be, or saying farewell. Some would choose that as the most coura- geous response; it would not be my choice. To move, even now, to a different understanding of the rela- tion between the human and the natural world might help us toward a different response - toward an acceptance of the fini- tude not just of the individual human but of our species, to- ward a realization that we are not in control, do not ultimately have dominion over nature and that we will end. Just as we have for so long identified the human with the male, so we have seen the divine only in human terms, thereby disavowing our dependence on nature. It is deeply moving that we take ourselves so seriously, love our form of life so much, that we can see the divine only in this image. But this means that if we die, the gods die with us - which somehow (at least for me) makes our probable death even more unbearable. I mentioned earlier that during this last year I have been not only to Nagasaki but also to Egypt. The exposure in Egypt to a consciousness so ancient that even the Greeks were awed at its age has played an important part in my own working through toward a reconciliation with the possibility that we may really die as a species.</page><page sequence="11">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 311 I was in Egypt at the time of the winter solstice, the time of the year's beginning, and felt myself to be at the place of begin- nings. I have been to Delphi and felt the presence of the divine there. I understand fully why the Greeks knew it as the navel of the world. But to be at Karnak at dawn in midwinter and to watch the sun rise perfectly centered between that long line of gates is another order of experience. There I knew myself to be at the place where humans first left enduring evidence of their response to the divine. I remembered my own early fasci- nation with Egypt, older even than my fathertaught love of Greece, and my childhood dream of going there and beginning at the beginning . . . Our sources for knowledge about Egyptian divinities are temples like the one at Karnak, tombs, reliefs, statues and ritual texts. These monuments and documents are full of allusions to familiar myths but never really narrate them; indeed, there are no shaped literary versions of the mythology like those pro- vided by Homer and Hesiod. The only fully rendered Egyptian myth available to us from the ancient world is Plutarch's late retelling of the Osiris tradition. The absence of a literary tradi- tion (which means that Egyptian mythology was never exposed to the esthetic concern for shaping, defining, simplifying) may help explain its immediately evident greater fluidity. Egyptian mythology is closer to the mythic as opposed to the esthetic imagination, closer to primary process, closer to the logic of dreams than to the logic of waking life, to a logic to which we still have access but which we tend not to trust. The Greeks themselves seem not to have recognized the pro- fundity of the difference. They were awed by the antiquity of Egyptian religion and the otherness of its manifestations; their initial response was fascination and antipathy. Yet because they believed that their own divinités were universally valid ar- chetypes, they assumed that the Egyptian divinities were essen- tially the same as their own but with different names; thus they equated Isis with Demeter, Hathor with Aphrodite, Nut with Rhea, Neith with Athene. This is to miss the point: it is what is unique and distinctive in the Egyptian apprehension that speaks to me. I recall Rilke's passionate plea: "Let none of the gods vanish. We need each and every one. Every one should matter to us, every perfected image."</page><page sequence="12">312 SOUNDINGS What the Greeks found most bewildering and repellant were the multiplicity of divinities and the archaic composite animal- human forms. It is precisely these features that I hope may help us to imagine a way of thinking different from our own - less dependent on dichotomies and hierarchies, less afraid of finitude, less obsessed with demarcation between the human and the natural. Egyptian mythology suggests a consciousness that might help us toward a more wholistic reading of our own situation. Because to the ancient Egyptians changelessness equalled death or nonexistence, they assigned no fixed, final form to any divinity. All their deities were alive, and thus still in process, like their temples which were always being changed and en- larged. When analogies between two divinités were appre- hended, these divinities were combined through a process of assimilation, not repression. Re and Amon are both sun gods. They do not supplant one another, nor is either regarded as the real one. In conjoining a third being, Re-Amon, is created. Re and Osiris are daily unified: Re becomes Re-Osiris as the sun sets and he enters Osiris's underworld realm; they are daily separated as Re rises from the underworld at dawn. Isis and Hathor combine as do Mut and Sekhmet, Sekhmet and Bast, Sekhmet and Hathor - but, as in dreams, only temporarily. The union can be dissolved; the separate divinities continue to persist; the combined form is a distinct creature. Egyptian my- thology expresses a delight in polytheism, in variety and differ- entiation. The Egyptians seem not to have had a sense of the divine apart from its particular manifestations. In Egyptian religion the recognition of the sacredness of nat- ural elements, the worship of aspects of the natural world in- cluding animals, is not characteristic only of some early, later discarded animistic phase, but persists long after the introduc- tion of anthropomorphic deities. Their religion communicates the original sense of the power of the natural world as a power greater than human power. Gods were seen as in these ele- ments and animals but not as indentical with them. The word for sun is different from the name of the sungod; the god of the Nile bears a different name than does the river itself. Among the most memorable features of Egyptian iconography are the strange combined forms, the divine beings who are part</page><page sequence="13">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 313 human, part animal. We should not imagine that the Egyptians thought that there are such creatures but rather recognize this as their way of representing the complex attributes of a mode of divinity, and the simultaneous presence in that divinity of complementary realities. There is nothing sentimental in this apprehension. The animals they worshipped were often fearful and destructive: scorpions, vultures, cobras, lionesses, croco- diles, and hippopotamuses. The same divinity could be repre- sented in animal form, in combined form, in human form. Hathor, for instance, might be a cow giving suck to a pharoah, a human with cow face, or a beautiful human female. None of these was a truer representation. There was no development toward an anthropomorphic or abstract conception of divinity. The images were seen as the most telling representation. These forms express the Egyptians' sense of their closeness to nature, their interdependence with it, and its transcendence. But not everything in nature is divine; there was no develop- ment in Egyptian religion in the direction of pantheism. That would be too abstract. Nor were the Egyptian divinities con- ceived of as eternal. Unlike the Greeks who saw in the immor- tality of the divine its chief distinction from mortal human being, the Egyptians believed that their gods, too, would die. The scale of the gods' lifespan is of a different order from ours but not endless. From the Egyptian perspective immortality or infinity would mean nonexistence, death. Egyptian religiosity thus encompassed an acceptance of the variety of the ways in which the divine shows itself as an ulti- mate not penultimate truth, an acknowledgement of the divin- ity of the natural not just the human world, and a valorization of change and death. I was, of course, especially interested in the goddesses of an- cient Egypt - who, I'm persuaded, are more important than most studies of Egyptian mythology have recognized. There are touching and powerful myths told about these goddesses, and beautiful sculptural and pictorial representations as well. In other contexts I would want to write at length about Nut and Mut, about Isis and Hathor, but here I will speak of only one of the many, the goddess Sekhmet, whose name means "the Pow- erful One."</page><page sequence="14">314 SOUNDINGS A daughter of Re the sun god, Sekhmet was identified with the scorching power of the noonday sun and most commonly represented as a lionheaded humanlike female. She was known as the Eye of Re and as defender of the divine order. She is placed as the uraeus serpent on Re's brow and is herself de- picted as wearing the solar disk and the uraeus. As Re's Eye Sekhmet is also the creatrix: one of the many Egyptian creation myths relates that humans grew from the tears shed by Re's eye when, having gone off on its own, it was forced to return. Ad- joining the Atum-dedicated temple complex at Karnak is a Temple to Mut where archaeologists have found 365 statues of Sekhmet, each subtly different, indicating her dominion over every day of the year. As fearsome maintainer of order, she is regarded as the punisher of the damned in the underworld. Though paired with both Ptah and Atum, she is never viewed as a subordinated spouse. Associated with Mut, consort of Atum, at Karnak, Sekhmet is also associated with Bast, the mild catfaced goddess who personifies the fertilizing warmth of the sun. Though a goddess in her own right, she is also seen as a manifestation of Hathor, the goddess of love, pleasure and beauty. Hathor is revered as one who gives support and nor- ishment to living humans who suck at her breasts and to the newly dead as they arrive in the underworld - but as Sekhmet she is terrifying. The most powerful Egyptian myth I know is one that involves Hathor in her Sekhmet aspect. The Egyptian gods who will someday die are also, of course, susceptible to aging as their Greek counterparts never are. In this particular story Re has become an old man, incontinent, dribbling from his mouth, se- nile and powerless. When the humans become aware of his weakness and begin to plot against him, Re sends out his Eye in the shape of his lioness daughter to subdue the rebellion. Although initially Sekhmet sets about her destructive work in order to restore balance, she soon gets carried away with her own bloodthirstiness. "When I slay men, my heart rejoices," she proclaims. Having tasted blood, she will not be appeased. She seems prepared to annihilate all humankind. But Re had meant only to uphold the divine order, to restore the balance between gods and humans, and knows that somehow his daughter must be stopped. The gods in concert come up with</page><page sequence="15">WHAT USE ARE POETS? 315 a solution. They fill the battlefield with several thousand urns of beer mixed with pomegranate juice. Greedily Sekhmet swal- lows the contents of the first vessel. "Ahah, more blood" she gloats, as she empties urn after urn, until finally she falls asleep in a drunken stupor. When she awakes she has come back to her senses, to her more Hathorlike nature. Modern commentators always speak of Sekhmet as a destruc- tive goddess, but when I remember the facial expression on the many ancient statues of Sekhmet that I have seen at Luxor, in the museums of Cairo, New York and Europe, I perceive some- thing different, an acceptance of the deathbringing energy that sometimes possesses her as integral to her nature. I see a look of weary compassion, the look of someone who sees the irre- ducible tragedy of life which she can do nothing to avert and which, indeed, she knows she has herself helped bring about, but who does not hide from the pain. I recall also the attitude toward her of her contemporary Egyptian attendants. How at Karnak the guards assume that to be taken to the dark locked shrine in which stands a perfectly preserved statue of a regal Sekhmet is the most valuable perquisite that is theirs to offer. How at the Temple of Mut the guards show enormous reluc- tance to share their goddess with anyone not able to communi- cate their worthiness. At both sites I was moved by the love, not just awe, that these attendants feel for her and by the sen- suous appreciation with which they stroke her breasts. Clearly they know her as a source of blessing and not only of destruction. The myth about Sekhmet is a powerful reminder of the im- portance of coming to terms with destructive energy. The dark side of the Greek goddesses is comparatively so muted, so human-scale, so much easier to acknowledge and integrate. Sekhmet reminds us that there are darker energies in us as humans and as natural beings. It is time now to acknowledge these energies as natural, not as evil or as satanic, but as part of a whole - as Sekhmet is an aspect of Hathor. We humans are like her with her initially creative energies so fearfully out of hand. And I mourn what we may do. The only poem I know which hints at the recognition that the energies which produced the atom bomb are our creative ener- gies, are expressions of eros and not only of death-longing was,</page><page sequence="16">316 SOUNDINGS it turns out, not written by a woman after all. It is William Car- los Williams' "Asphodel, That Greeny Flower": The bomb puts an end to all that. I am reminded that the bomb also is a flower dedicated howbeit to our destruction. The mere picture of the exploding bomb fascinates us so that we cannot wait to prostrate ourselves before it. We do not believe that love can so wreck our lives. The Egyptians knew that everything eventually comes to an end - even the gods, even the ba that survives the death of the body. For them endlessness was itself death, nonexistence. Yet they also loved ordinary daily life in this world so passion- ately that they did everything they could to extend it, even after death. The tombs, the funerary temples, the elaborate death cult, all mark a celebration of life. Accepting that we as a species may die means celebrating the beauty of our everyday life, living it as fully and creatively and gratefully as we are able. I remember again the answer given by that young German to my intense questioning about how I might most meaningfully live my life - by showing that it is still possible to live an ordinary life. . I understand why Christa Wolf included in her essays not just the conclusions of her thinking but its contexts, the bread she had just finished baking, the appletree outside her window, the conversations with her husband. My vision is not apocalyptic. I do not see our probable end as punishment. I do not see our present world as ugly or evil. I delight in my sunset walks on the beach.

What the Egyptians recognized as there, transcendent to us, will still persist, albeit changed, in forms we might not recognize. To celebrate life, the Egyptians knew, means not holding on to the forms of it immediately given. I bless what I have learned from those who lived near the beginning that helps me to understand what it is like to live near what may be the ending.</page></plain_text>
