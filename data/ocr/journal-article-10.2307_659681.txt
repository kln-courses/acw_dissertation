CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.- Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending directly to Dr A.

Eth- nol., Berlin, 19O8, XL, 241-253, 273- 276.) Discussion of the question of the origin of iron-smelting (replies, re- joinders, etc.), the share of the Pales- tinian peoples, etc., in this invention. See American Anthropologist, 1907, N. S., Ix, 749. Cunningham (J. T.) The evolution of man. (Science Progress, Lond., 19o8, III, 192-201.) Treats of "some of the modern conceptions of biology in relation to the human species," arguing that "anthropology requires to be reinvesti- gated from modern points of view." Ac- cording to Dr C. "man affords an ex- ample of a single species which has started a new group, which might be- come a genus or family " ; and " adap- tive characters are due, not to selection, but to the effects of functional and phys- ical stimulation." Also "diagnostic characters are not adaptive, and there- fore not due to selection, but to blasto- genic variation." Dussaud (R.) Anciennes civilisations orientales, fouilles et decouvertes. (R. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1908, xvIII, 267-276. ) Notes on chronology of an- cient epochs (studies of King,\Lehmann, Hilprecht, Thureau-Dangin, Meyer), in- vestigations in Palestine (Petrie, Schu- macher, Vincent), Elam and the Egean (J. de Morgan), the Mycenean at Delos (Holleaux), ancient Jewish documents from Elephantine (Sachan), scientific expedition to Abyssinia (Littmann, etc.), level of the Mediterranean in antiquity (Cayeux), etc. van Gennep (A.) Le rite du refus. (A. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1907, XI, I-10.) Treats of "ceremonial refusal" (bishops of early Christian church, Popes, petty kings of Loango, Nigeria, etc., early Khalifs,-- sometimes the order of an old woman is necessary to cause the office to be taken) in various parts of the world. Van G. considers this "a ceremonial socializing of responsibility," the chief being thus made responsible and his people with him, not he alone. Giannelli (A. ) Sulla interruzione del sul- cus Rolandi. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 19o8, XIV, 44-59, 2 fgs.) Describes 4 cases of interruption of the sulcus Rolandi (3 female, I male; 3 Italian, I Jew; all psychopaths, 2 idiots). G. regards the presence of the median fronto-parietal fold as a mark of in- feriority and an arrest of development. Gothein (M.) Die Todsiinden. (A. f. Religsw., Leipzig, 1907, x, 416-484.) Discusses in detail the 7 peccata mortalia or "deadly sins," as regarded by the early Christian church, its theologians and philosophers, their connection in hermetic thought with the 7 planets, the 8 mortal sins of the Eastern Church, the deadly sins in Alcuin, Prudentius, Cassian, Gre- gory (cf. Horace) and his successors, the 7 deadly sins in ecclesiastical art, in poetry and prose of the Middle Ages, etc. (Dante, Alanus de Insulis), the ordering of the punishments of hell ac- cording to these sins (in a group of works of the end of the 15th and begin- ning of the I6th centuries), the order of the 7 deadly sins (the salzgia scheme for remembering taken up by the Jesuits) ; the correlation of the deadly sins with animals (the high tide of representation of these sins comes in the 13th century; the Christian fights against evil spirits,. wild animals, etc., the death-dance, morality plays--in England the alle- gorical figures lingered longer than else- where), etc. Interesting is John Lilly's 1 Beginning with Volume XI (I909) the reviews of periodical literature will be published annually instead of quarterly. An opportunity will be given to members and subscribers to procure separate copies if desired. 677</page><page sequence="3">678 AME'RICAN ANTtHROPOLOGIST [N. S., IO, 1908 The Woman in the Moon, as showing how long the idea continued that the planets are responsible for calamities that lead men to sin,--a belief not yet extinct even in the most civilized quar- ters of the globe. Hambruch (P.) Das Meer in seiner Be- deutung f'ir die V61kerverbreitung. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 19o8, N. F. VII, 75-88, 4 maps.) Discusses the sea in relation to the dispersion of human races over the globe, currents, winds, etc., in particular. Few peoples have willingly set forth on the sea, and travel on the high seas has been developed only by some coast-folk, e. g., Phenicians, Northmen, Eskimo, Malays, Polynesians, Japanese. Australia and Africa (with few exceptions such as the Papel of Senegal and the Suaheli of M'rima) have no sea-faring peoples. In Indonesia and Polynesia the aborigines equal or exceed the Northmen of old. River-navigation does not necessarily lead to sea-faring; deltas and, estuaries often hinder it. Ethnic pressure, love for conquest, over- population, etc., have stimulated sea- travel. Winds and currents have been powerful factors. Herv6 (G.) L'anthropologie de Voltaire. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, I9o8, xvIII, 225-255.) Discussion of the anthropological ideas of Voltaire set forth chiefly in the Dictionnaire Philo- sophique and the Philosophie de l'His- toire, the Singularitks de la Nature, etc. Voltaire was a somatic and lin- guistic polygenist; he also affirmed the existence Qf a " natural religion," which he termed theism. He had met aborig- ines of several regions of the globe, in- cluding the four American Indians from the Mississippi, whom he examined at Fontainebleau. de Huelguero (F.) Dell' influenza del Gozzo sulle statistiche della statura. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 19o8, xiv, 61- 69.) On the basis of the statures of 3,861 recruits (for 1855-59) of the dis- trict of Aosta (av. 160.29 cm.), the author concludes that the morbidity is independent of stature, likewise the effect produced by the disturbing element. Morbidity (or diminution of develop- ment through the disturbing cause) may be a little greater for those of low stature. Livi (R.) Sulla causa del destrismo e del mancinismo. (Ibid., 91-94.) Dr L. concludes that the fundamental cause of the predisposition to righthandedness and lefthandedness is "uterine posi- tion." This predisposition may how- ever be counterbalanced by a number of minor causes, so that one born right- handed may become lefthanded and vice versa. Making bread in differeut parts of the world. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1908, XIX, 165-178, 11 pl., I fg.) The illustrations (with descriptive notes) show cassava-making in West Indies, tortilla- making in Mexico and Central America, a bread "wallah" in India, bakery in Japan, grinding at the mill in Palestine, baking bread in Syria, Egyptian and Turkish bread, making Norwegian "flat bread," etc., modern American bread- making. Mochi (A.) La discriminazione delle forme craniche e il sistema del Sergi. (A. p. 1'Antrop., Firenze, 1908, xxxvIII, 87-126, 2 fgs.) Detailed discussion of the methods of distinguishing cranial forms, and the Sergi system in particu- lar. According to M. the system of Sergi, while very efficacious for descrip- tive craniology and useful for recognizing and distinguishing cranial forms, all va- rieties are not comprehended under the 9 " types " established by him. Papillault (G.) L'anthropologie est-elle une science unique? (R. de 1' c. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o8, XVIll, I 7- 132, 1 fg.) Dr P. defines anthropology as "the science of human groups, lead- ing to integral knowledge of their com- position, their functioning and their needs by the help of all the technological uni- ties having as objects the study of collec- tive phenomena." There are somatic, sociologic, economic, and ethnologic an- thropology, the last embracing very indi- vidualized technologies such as linguis- tics, religion, archeology, folk-lore. Penck (A.) Das Alter des Menschenge- schlechtes. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19o8, XL, 390-407, 3 fgs.) Discusses the antiquity of the human race, particularly in reference to the glacial age, etc., in Europe, and in relation to various recent theories. Not till we know for certain that the eolith-maker was man can we put back the race into millions of years, but must content ourselves with millen- niums.

Politische Geographie. (Globus, Brn- schwg., 1907, xcII, 94.) R6sum6s H. Gaidoz's article, "Introduction de l'eth- nographie politique," in the Revue In- ternationale de I'Enseignement (Paris), 1907. Puccioni (N.) Di alcune omologie fra le ossa dello scheletro cefalico e viscerale dell' uomo e dei cranioti inferiori. (A. p. I'Antrop., Firenze, 19o8, xxxvnii, 37-85.) Treats, with bibliography of 161 titles, of homologies of the bones of the cephalic and visceral skeleton (occi- pital, sphenoid, temporal, parietal, frontal, ethmoid, lacrimal, nasal, max- illary, malar, and hyoid ; visceral arches, sutures, fontanelles, fontanelle and wor- mian bones) in man and the higher vertebrates, r6sumeing the present state of knowledge on the subject. The most complex of the cranial bones is the temporal, the series of whose points of ossification has not yet been clearly fixed. The parietal is generally given but one ossifying center, the frontal two principal ones; the ethmoid four, the lacrimal and nasal one each, the upper maxillary five, the malar one or more, the lower max- illary perhaps six, the hyoid five. The normal fontanelles in the human skull are 4, the theoretic ones numbering 22. Rademacher (L.) Schelten und Fluchen. (A. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1907, xI, II -22.) Treats of the conjuration of the dead in the Orestes of Euripides, the meaning of the terms used, etc. As power over good spirits is gained by prayer, so the evil are won over by curses. Per- sonal abuse gains the help of the dead. Rohrer (F.) Eine neue Formel zur Be- stimmung der K6rperffille. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Braunschweig, 19o8, xxxIx, 5--7.) For Livi's index ponderalis R. would substitute the for- mula Ioo - weight of body heights 3 Schuster (E.) The promise of youth and the performance of manhood, being a statistical inquiry into the question whether success in the examination for the B. A. degree at Oxford is followed by success in professional life. (Univ. of Lond., Eugenic Lab. Mem., Lond., No. III, 1907, 1-16.) Based on data in Crockford's Clerical Directory for the year 1899 and Foster's Men at the Bar (I1885) and the records of Oxford. S. concludes that " success both at the Bar and in the church has a quiet well- marked causal relationship with success in the Oxford final schools, and it is probable that if a better measure of suc- cess in these professions had been avail- able, this relationship would have been found to be still more intimate." De- tailed tables are given, the lawyers involved numbering 634, the church- men, 1,748. - and Elderton (E. M.) The inherit- ance of ability, being a statistical study of the Oxford class lists and of the school lists of Eton and Charterhouse. (Ibid., Lond., 1907, No. I, 1-42.) Based on data in Foster's Alumni Oxonienses (continued, Oxford Men and their Col- leges), the Harrow Register and Harrow Calendar and the Charterhouse Register. The Oxford material gave a correlation between father and son of .312 and be- tween brother and brother of .405 ; Eton and Charterhouse a correlation between brother and brother of .398. Detailed tables are given. Sergi (G.) Sul limite posteriore del lobo parietale e sui solchi occipitali esterni nel cervello dell' uomo. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 19o8, xIv, 75-89, I pl.) R6sum6s previous studies (Kohl- brugge, Zuckerkandl, Elliot Smith, Hall, etc.) and own investigations on the limits of separation between the parietal and occipital lobes on the brain-surface, the Affenspalte, etc., in man and the anthro- poids. Sollas (W. J.) Paleolithic races and their modern representatives. Part I. (Sci- ence Progress, Lond., 19o8, ni, 326-53, 6 fgs. ) Argues for the recognition in the Quaternary epoch of 4 glacial and 4 genial ages. Prof. S. holds that of the existence of man previous to the begin- ning of the great ice age "not a vestige of evidence, forcible enough to compel universal belief, has up to the present time been discovered." The Pithecan- thropus, the flints of Thenay, Puy Coumy, Yenang-yung (Burma), etc., are dis- cussed. Strassmann (P.) Die anthropologische Bedeutung der Mehrlinge. (Z. f.

Treats of multiple-births from the anthro- pological point of view : Frequency (race, culture, ways of life, environment exert</page><page sequence="5">680 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., IO, 190g no influence; multiple births rise and sink with increasing and decreasing birth rate, with the fertility of woman), hered- ity (frequent), relation to age of mother (more common in later years of mar- ried life), sex (with multiple births as with normal single births, more boys than girls are produced), weight and height (the average of the child of a multiple less than that of a single birth), mortality and prospect of life (single children more favored), etc. S. con- cludes that multiple births (twins, trip- lets, quadruplets, etc.) represent a re- versive sort of reproduction becoming rarer and rarer, and the dangers to the mother accompanying such indicate a still further reduction of multiparity and the ultimate rule altogether of single births. Vierkandt (A.) Das Problem der Fels- zeichnungen und der Ursprung des Zeichnens. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., I908, N. F., viI, IIo-II8, 3 fgs.) Dis- cusses the question of rock-drawings in relation to the origin of drawing, with particular reference to Koch's studies of the rock pictures and drawings of S. American Indians. V. notes the poverty of elemental forms, the iriclination to- ward agglutination of geometric elemental forms, the growth of figures from "' scribblings" through the processes of agglutination and "reading in," and the giving up of the original signification for a playing with the meaning, as the chief marks of this sort of primitive art. Drawing here originates in scribblings repetitive or imitative of strioe made for practical purposes; the third stage was the drawing of significant figures,- only in the broadest sense was there at first in this stage an imitation of real objects. Gesture language may have contributed something. There is parallelism with the development of drawing in the child. Die Anfange der Religion und Zauberei. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, 21-25, 40-45, 61-65.) Treats of the beginnings of religion and " magic " (near, beginning, at distance). The psychological basis of "magic," lies in "Ithe confusion of subjectivity and objectivity in both the practical and the theoretical field, " - this confusion is a common human quality and not a mere isolated or peculiar phenomenon in the culture of the race. The mental life of the child offers many phenomena ex- planatory of the psychological mechanism of "magic." It is improbable that cul- tus is older than "Imagic," and has an independent origin. The two oldest simple religious ideas are that embodied in the Iroquoian orenda, Siouan wa- kanda, etc., and the anthropomorphic or analogizing concept of nature. The third stage is animism, which is not at all, as some suppose, the most primitive re- ligious idea. A pre-animistic period ot religion, in spite of Wundt's argument to the contrary, has surely existed. Virchow (H.) Ueber Einsetzen der Zfhne nach Form. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19o8, XL, 254-257, 2 fgs.) Describes method of securing accurate placement of the teeth in skulls (after softening) by means of a mould, also the position of the lower to the upper jaw. Volz (W.) Ueber das geologische Alter des Pithecanthropus erectus Dub. (Glo- bus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, 341-342.) Gives results of author's investigations in the Trinil region in 19o6. Dr V. con- cludes that the strata with the remains of the P. e. are not earlier than the old diluvial, nor later than late diluvial, being therefore, probably middle-dilu- vial. The P. e. is a fossil anthropoid, "' an unsuccessful attempt at man." Waldeyer (-.) Ueber Gehirne men- schlicher Zwillings- und Drillingsfriichte verschiedenen Geschlechts. (Z. f. Eth- nol., Berlin, 19o8, XL, 262-272.) After references to previous investigations of sexual differences in human brains and in those of twins (Riidinger, Passet, Karplus, etc.), Dr W. treats of the brains of fetal twins and triplets of dif- ferent sexes (3 cases of twins; 3 cases of triplets, - 2 boys I girl, 2 girls I boy, 2 boys I girl). While the majority of the male brains show a greater development of the furrows and convolutions of the cerebral hemispheres, some do not, and Dr W. does not accept Riidinger's "Ilaw" to that effect, holding with Karplus and Retzius that much more extensive and varied material (racial especially) is necessary (to say nothing of the question of individual variations) before a dog- matic position can be taken. Dr W. desires anatomical material of the kind in question. Wide (S.) Chthonische und himmlische G,5tter. (A. f. Religsw., Leipzig, 1907, x, 257-268.) Treats of chthonic (earth) deities and their transformation into celestial ones, particularly among the peoples of the ancient world, a meta- morphosis less known than the reverse</page><page sequence="6">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 68 1 process. Chthonic deities are subterran- ean deities, but they are found also in the air (e. g. some of the wind-gods). The example of Hera as a chthonic deity passing over into a celestial one is discussed with some detail. Another instance is that of the Dioscuri. Under the influence of the Olympic religion a strong effort was made to raise the posi- tion of other chthonic deities as well; some of them spend part of their time above and part below. Wodan was originally an earth-god and a god of the dead made celestial under the influences of the Viking age. Wintemberg (W. J.) Myths and fancies of the Milky Way. (J. Roy. Astron. Soc. Can., Toronto, 19o8, 235-247.) Cites myth, legend, folk-lore and poetic ideas from all ages and peoples. The Milky Way is "mother of stars," star- dust (Peruvian); the belt of God (Lett); the lovers' bridge (Finnish); the crooked serpent (Hebrew); the long blue cloud- eating shark (Polynesian); bridge of Asgard (Norse); the path of God, of heroes, of spirits, etc. (with many widely scattered peoples); the way of birds (Finnish), the dog's trail (Kootenay and Cherokees), the wolf road (Black- feet), the snake's path (N. India); the path of Noah's ark (Panjaibi), the pil- grims' path (Turkish), the way to Rome (medieval European), way of St James (European); Watling Street (early Eng- lish), Winter Street (Swedish), and the street or path of divers saints, gods, heroes, etc., in European religions and mythologies; river of heaven, river of light, white river, etc., the heavenly Ganges (Hindu); the straw road (Arabic, etc.); the trail of the swimming turtle, the buffalo and horse racing, the snow- shoes of the creator, the road where the spirits hunt ostriches, etc. The term " Milky way " is ancient and widespread. Another curious belief is found in The- ophrastus and Diodorus Siculus, viz. that "it was the junction between the two hemispheres, which together formed the vault of heaven: and it was so badly made that it let through some of the light supposed to exist everywhere behind the solid sky." The appellations of the "Milky Way" serve admirably to illus- trate both the differences and the re- semblances of thought among the races of man. Zanolli (V.) Studio sulla obliterazione delle suture craniche. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Anthrop., 19o8, xIv, 13-44.) R6- sum6s previous studies and gives details of own investigation of 25 male and 25 female Bolognese and 14 male and 6 female Paduan skulls in the Anatomical Laboratory of the University of Padua, with respect to obliteration of sutures. Dr Z. concludes that the sutural course is not as regular or as constant as certain authors hold; synostotic concomitants are very frequent; suturation is rela- tively precocious (at about 25 years) in man and late (at 30) in woman; the rhythm of the course of obliteration is more regular in woman; asymmetries of obliteration are frequent, but there is no relation between these and normal plagio- cephaly. EUROPE Andree (R.) Jiidische Museen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, o17-1o8.) Based on Dr S. Weissenberg's article in the Mitteilungen zur jiidischen Volks- kunde, Heft 28, treating of Jewish anti- quities and other objects in German Mu- seum. The historical and cultural value of Jewish Museums is emphasized, i. e., of museums setting forth the cultural de- velopment and historical evolution of the Jews in Germany. Baudouin (M.) La croix blanche des fermes du bocage "vend6en B. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o8, ve s., Ix, 42- 77, 5 fgs.) Treats in detail of the white cross painted on farm-houses in the wooded region of the Vend6e,--in the plain and marshy country it is now rare,--its distribution, signification, varia- tion in form, comparison with similar symbols elsewhere, etc. Dr B. believes this cross, now interpreted by the peasants as the Christian sign of the cross for pro- tection against the devil, to be the Chris- tianization of a prehistoric cult (all the intermediary stages between the typical prehistoric sculptures and the purest form of the cross are found), the intent being the same to-day as of yore, to protect agriculture against evil spirits. The white cross is confined to farm-houses, etc. Fouille et restauration de 1' all6e cou- verte de Querellio h Saint-Mayeux, C6tes- du-Nord. (Ibid., 78-79.) Note on the restoration since 1906 of the megalithic monument of St Mayeux belonging to the close of the neolithic period. Breuil (H.), Peyrony (D.) et Bourinet (J.)

Brief account of stalagmitic concretions bearing imprints of cave-pictures (horse, etc. ) from the prehistoric grotto of Tey- jat, and of some retouched and replaced pieces of rock with engravings upon them (two human occupations are thus indicated and the antiquity of the earlier pictures proved beyond doubt). In the discussion M. Baudouin called attention to the fact that the pictured horse of the caves seems identical with the modern horse of the Ile d'Yeu, which by reason of environment, etc., seems to have re- verted to the primitive type.

Die Festcyclen des r;imischen Kalenders. (A. f. Re- ligsw., Leipzig, 1907, x, 333-344.) Treats of the festival-cycles of the an- cient Roman calendar, -around some one chief festival in each month were grouped the minor ones, all standing in certain relations to one another. The chief festival of August was the Volcan- alia on the 23d, introduced by the Con- sualia of the 21st and ending with the Opiconsivia of the 25th. There were also the Portunalia of the 17th, the Vinalia of the 19th, and the Voltur- nalia of the 27th. The whole festival cycle was ruled by Vulcanus. The cycle of December was ruled by the deity of the germinating seed. March and April are dominated by generation, and the moving of life; and so on with others. The cycle of Roman festivals begins in December with the adoration of the power that renews life in the death of winter, passes life at its height in June, and in October with an attempt to ensure the well-being of the year to come. Eichhorn (G.) Depotfund im Miinchen- rodaer Grund bei Jena. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19o8, XL, I194-200, 25 fgs.) Describes find of bronze objects (sword, celt, armlet, bosses, rings, spirals, etc.) made in 1885 at Miinchenroda near Jena, and now in the Germanic museum of the University. Feilberg (H. F.) The corpse-door: a Danish survival. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 364-375, I pl.) Treats of the custom (and its analogies elsewhere) formerly widespread in Denmark of hav- ing a door through which the corpse was carried out and which was afterward bricked up. Digging under the threshold, making a hole in the wall, etc., are some of the related practices intended to avoid carrying the dead through the usual en- trance to the house in the hope of pre- venting the return of the ghost. Fisher (E.) Ueber den Ursprung der rumAnischen Bojarenfamilien. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19o8, XL, 343-361.)

(A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., I908, N. F., VII, 1-15, 2 pl., II fgs.) Treats of the hair-dress and clothing of the prehistoric peoples of the Carpathian and Balkan countries. According to F. the modern Balkan peoples have pre. served in their essential features the hair- dress and costume of their Thracian an- cestors of Butmir, Jablanica, Adam- klessi and Cucutenei, a further proof of the identity of these peoples with the prehistoric "Thracians," already dem- onstrated for certain aspects of architec- ture, art, music, custom, belief, etc. Furtwangler (A.)

G. raises the ques- tion whether the spread of this mantle is not due to the Portuguese. Another view brings it originally from China. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Contributo all' antropologia fisica delle regioni dinariche e danubiane e dell' Asia anteriore. (A. p. I'Anthrop., Firenze, 19o8, xxxvIII, 127-180, I pl., 2 fgs.) Treats of ancient and modern (Gothic, Croatian, Slavonian, Veneto-Illyrian, Dalmatian, Montene- grin, Albanian, Bosnian-Herzegovinian, Rumanian, Armenian, Maronite, Kurd, etc. ) skulls from the Dinaric and Danubian regions and from Asia Minor (measure- ments of 6o Armenian, etc., skulls are given). The conclusions reached are: Ripley's identification of the Veneto- Illyrians with the Alpine type is incor- rect, - the Illyrians were dolicho-meso- cephals; the modern Greek and Balkan peoples are less brachycephalic than is generally supposed; Asia never sent brachycephals into the Danubian plain and the latter has never been the center of brachycephaly imagined by De Michelis, etc.; hypsiconchia, a character supposed to be peculiar to Asiatic skulls, no longer occurs in adjacent Rumania, a fact not favorable to the theory of brachycephalic transit from Asia to Europe. Pages 176- 18o are taken up by an argument of Prof. C. Sergvic that the Croatians are wrongly considered Slavs, being really Avars. v. Hahn (-) Nomina geographica Cau- casica (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, XCII, 127-130, 140-143). Discusses numer- ous geographical names of the Caucasus, their etymology, meanings, etc. These names represent ethnic and tribal history, m ig ra tio n s, intermixture (Kwemo- Schawaliit, e. g., is Grusinian-Tatar; besides the Caucasian peoples themselves, Armenian, Persian, Turkish, Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Italian influences are present) ; climate and natural condi- tions, the fauna and flora, the mineral realm, industries and occupations (also physical and moral characters of locali- ties, --blason populaire), religion and older heathenism, legends, etc. Some of names of mountains and rivers are very interesting. Mt Elbruz has at least Io names. To the Ossetes it is known as Tseristitsub, or " Christ Mountain," from the folk-belief that Christ once lived in one of its caves. Henkel (L.) Die Gegend von K6sen. (Ibid., 293-296, 2 fgs. ) Contains some notes on the presence of man from the later stone age down, archeological re- mains, etc. Hertzog (A.) Schaustiicke und Samm- lungen im alten Strassburg. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr. Brnschwg., 19o8, xxxIx, 1-5.)

Aus dem Asklepion von Kos. (A. f. Religsw., Leipzig, 1907, x, 201- 228, 400-415, I pl.) Treats of the dis- covery of the Asklepion at Kos, the serpent-offering (the fourth mimus of Herondas, the Koan temples, offerings to openings in the earth, Charon and Cerberus, serpent and dog), the worship of Demeter at Kos, etc. Hollack (E.) Die Grabformen ostpreus- sischer Graiberfelder. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19o8, XL, 145-193.) Treats of the various forms of graves in East Prussia, - La Tine, the so-called Roman and post-Roman graves of the Masurian region and south Ermland, the graves of the central belt of the province, the graves of Samland. The graves of Sam- land indicate for the post-Christian cen- turies a constant specific Prussian popu- lation. The stone-protected graves of Samland and the region south of the Pregel are to be attributed to a Prusso- Lettish population. In Samland the graves yield evidences of 4 cultures: Early Roman with inhumation (corre- sponding to La Tine of the S. W. of the Province) ; full Roman culture with cre- mation; post-Roman with cremation; so-called "late-heathen." Jaeger (J.) Das Gasteiner Tal. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 373-378.)

F., VII, 72-74, 3 fgs. ) Brief account of diluvial bones of animals from Neustadt on the Haardt, discovered in 1901. Among these are pieces of reindeer bone and horn with incisions and other marks of human origin. These are probably the old- est relics of diluvial man in the Rhine country. Moriz von D6chys Forschungen im Kau- kasus. (Globus, Brnschwg., I907, xcII, 296-301, 7 fgs.) Resume and review of Moriz von D6chy's Kaukasus, Reisen und Forschungen im Kaukasischen Hochgebirg (3 Bde.

There were 37 different types made at different prices per thousand in 1865, at present only 13. Miihlhofer (F.) Ueber knochenfiihrende Diluvialschichten des Triester Karstes und Karstentwaldung. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, 109-Ill, 3 fgs.) Treats of the bone-bearing strata, the paleolithic and neolithic artefacts of the " Red field" cave in the Karst of Trieste, etc. Two ice-periods, an interglacial and a post-glacial are distinguished. Evidence of man's presence is met with in the first interglacial. The deforestation of much of the Karst may have been due to the Romans. Neger (F. W.) Im Reich der Pinsapo- tanne und der Korkeiche. (Ibid., 309- 314, 5 fgs.) Describes the region of the pinsapo-fir and the cork-oak in Andalusia and the utilization of these trees. Osthoff (H.) Etymologische Beitrige zur Mythol ogie und Religionsgeschichte. (A. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1907, xI, 44- 74-) Discusses the etymology and sig- nificance of Iris, the Greek name of the messenger of the gods, the terms for "rainbow," " sun drawing water," "Milky Way," etc., in the various Indo- European tongues, particularly Greek and Latin. According to O., the goddess Iris was the path-walker, viatrix, the carrier of messages from gods to gods, between sky and earth, from one end of the world to the other. Later on, through folk-etymology, she was identi- fied with the rainbow. Patiri (G.) Le mura e le costruzioni ci- clopiche della contrada Cortevecchia, in Termine Imerese.

Pekokultus (Der) bei den Setukesen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, XcII, 19I.) Based on M. J. Eisen's article in the Fin- nisch-Ugrische Forschungen for I906. Peko is the deity of agriculture and cattle-breeding and his cult is more ex- tensive among the Setukeses than among the Karelians. Perko (G. A.) Aus der Unterwelt des Karstes. (Ibid., 359-365, 377-383, 4 fgs. ) Treats of the caves of Bresovizza, Slivno and Nabresina, - those of the last two regions contain animal remains and human artefacts, etc. The Moser cave yielded a human skeleton with grave- gifts, flints, weapons of bone, etc. The man of these caves was a nomadic hunter, changing later on to sedentary life (pastoral and fishing), with culture like that elsewhere in Europe of the period. Pittard (E.) Ossements utilises (dia- physes) de la p6riode moust&amp;ienne, sta- tion des Reb'ires, Ourbi&amp;res, Dordogne. (R. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1908, XVIII, 255-261, 5 fgs.) Treats of cer- tain animal bones bearing marks of use, cuts, etc., of human origin from the Mousterian period at the "station" of Rebi'res in the Dordogne. The pur- pose for which they were employed is not clear. Reche (0.) Zur Anthropologie der jiing- eren Steinzeit in Schlesien und B6hmen. (A. f. Anthrop.. Brnschwg., 1908, N. F., VII, 220-231, I pl., 5 fgs.) Treats of an- thropological types in the later stone age in Silesia and Bohemia,-in the " Schnur- keramik" and the " Band-keramik " periods and the transitional epoch. Some 90 skulls and skeletons were studied (detailed measurements) and two distinct types, one meso-brachy- cephalic, the other dolicho-hyperdolicho- cephalic, the second being identical with the North European or Nordic race. In the course of the stone age a change in race took place, the type of the North European race (bringing with it the " Schnur-keramik") suppressed the other type (brachycephalic), and married the women of the stock, producing thus a mixed race. The second type appears to have had no culture-creative r81e, the Nordic type being the carriers of both cultures, "Schnur" and "Band- keramik." Samter (E.) Der Ursprung des Laren- kultus. (A. f. Religsw., Leipzig, x, 368-392.) Discusses the origin of the Roman cult of the Lares, the theories of Wissowa in particular. The terms com- pitum and Lares the considered; also the doll-offerings, dress, participation of slaves in the compitalia, etc. Against Wissowa's contention, that the Lares are protective deities of the soil, S. holds that they represent the cult of ancestors and souls. Schmidt (R. R.) Die neuen paliolithi- schen Kulturstiitten der Schwaibischen Alb. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1908, N. F. VII, 62-71, 31 fgs.) Treats briefly of the new paleolithic "stations" in Swabia, discussed in detail in Prof. E. Ko- ken and Dr R. R. Schmidt's recent work Die diluvialen Kulturstdtten Deutsch- lands. Very important is the Sirgen- stein cave in the valley of the Ach, where the Mousterian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, Magdalenian are all represented. The Hohlefels cave near Hiitten exhibits a later Magdalenian epoch. The paleo- liths of the Swabian Alb represent the same stages as those to the East and West. With the appearance of the last glacial period man began to spread over south Germany, the highlands of that region being then for the first time inhabited. Schnippel (E.) Die oberlindische Haube, genannt " das Miitzchen." (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, 238-240, I fg.) De- scribes the cap called Miitzchen used in the Prussian Oberland within a genera- tion, and the dress corresponding. Sim- ilar caps were formerly known in parts of Magdeburg, Thuringia, and the mod- ern nurse's cap resembles the Miitzchen much. Its origin is possibly due to the old Dutch settlements in this region. Seidel (H.) Bemerkungen zu den neueren Karten des Hohen Tatra. (Ibid., 152- 154.) Contains some notes on place- names, etc., in the Tatra region of the Carpathians. v. Seidlitz (N.)

Treats of the natural gifts and mental characteristics of the people of the region of Biassa, customs and habits, dress, ornament, etc. One marked trait is continuous litigation; theft and dissimulation are. others. Knowledge is chiefly tenacious tradition. Tetzner (F.) Die istrischen Slawen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, 85- 89.)

AFRICA Avelot (R.) Le ouri. Un jeu africain A combinaisons mathematiques. (B. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1908, ve s., ix, 9-22. ) Treats in detail of uri, an African game with mathematical combinations, the na- ture and distribution in Africa (map) of the three species of dish-games, tshela, tab, uri, their migration, etc. The game of uri is African, having had its origin among some Hamitic people in the neighborhood of Ethiopia and hav- ing spread in four directions,- by way of the Fulas to the north Sahara, Sene- gambia and Guinea to the Gaboon; by way of Nubian slave-traders down the Nile; through the Jaggas to Angola; by some Negro-Hamitic tribe south to Man- ica. The so-called cup-stones have nothing to do with the game. Bieber (F. J.) Das Recht der Kaffitcho. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, 365- 367.) Treats of law and legal ideas and institutions among the Kaffitcho, a Hami- tic people of the Abyssinian highlands, - judges, formulae, courts, ordeals, inheri tance laws, marriage, crimes and punish ments, appeals to emperor, etc. Many aboriginal (non-Abyssinian) ideas have developed in Kaffitcho law.

Genius in soothsaying skips a generation according to the Wajagga. In the valley of the Niger. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1908, xix, 164, 2 pl., I fg.) Illustrations of ethnologic interest (granary, burnt clay walls of hut with animal figures, etc., native ,types), fur- nished by " La Soci6te d'Etudes Colo- niales de Belgique."' Karutz (R.) Tatauiermuster aus Tunis. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1908, N. F., VII, 5I-6i, 38 fgs.) Treats of tattoo- patterns from Tunis, particularly those of a tattooing-book obtained by the author in 1906 in Kairouan, with account of the process of tattooing and notes on the various figures. K. believes that tattoo- ing is basally an ornamental art, all re- ligious, social and personal elements having been secondary, but in itself is not of esthetic origin. Tattooing goes back to the treatment of wounds and scars by rubbing in soot, ashes, draw- ing thread through the opening made by a needle, etc., - cf. the medical " hair- rope." Out of this came rubbing color- substances and finally the process of tattooing as we have it. - Nach den H6hlenstidten Siid- tunisiens. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcII, 117-123, 133-140, 201-205, 215- 218, 229-236, 50 fgs.) Describes visit in 1906 to the "cave-cities," etc., of Southern Tunis,-Bon Amran, Matmata, M6denine, Douirat, Chenini, Germersa, - architecture, implements, furniture, character of cave-dwellings, origin, notes on the people (mostly Berber in the midst of Araboid nomads), their family- life, customs, industries, etc., with some account of the surrounding population. Some of these caves are quite modern and due to their present possessors. The explanation of their use (" they are cool in summer and warm in winter") given by the troglodytes of Toujane, indicates a climatic reason for their existence. The natural caves have often been abandoned for artificial ones possessing greater advantages. Their form does not justify the refuge or defense theory. Klose (H.) Die Behandlung Eingeborener im Hinblick auf unser Kolonisations- werk. (Ibid., 316-320.) Discusses the treatment of African aborigines in relation to German colonization, the use of native troops, police, etc. Justice, respect for native sanctuaries, knowledge of political and social conditions, tact, industrial and economic education are necessary.

Notes on the pre-Mohammedan population of northern Adamaua (the Islamic Fulla began their invasion in the beginning of the I9th century), occupying the moun- tain regions, etc., - Batta tribes, Falli, Mundang, Margi, Gamergu, Musgu, etc. The map shows the distribution of heathen and Islamised peoples. The change of this heathen population can be made but gradually; their industry in- sures a good futue for them. de Morgan (H.) Notes sur les stations quaternaires et sur l'Vge du cuivre en Egypte. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1908, xvIII, 133-149, 19 fgs.) Treats of the "stations" in the region of Esneh and the implements of paleolithic type (quaternary) in that part of Egypt, the paleolithic culture, passing from Assuan to the Delta with 3 types of burial, cist graves, knee-elbow inhumation, graves with burnt offerings, grave pottery, etc. Also copper objects (hatchet, chisel, etc. ) from the kitchen-middens of Adimieh. de M. believes that in Egypt the bronze age has been preceded by a copper age. The axe of Adimieh has been copied from one of stone. Certain engraved stone cylinders belong to the same period, comparable with others from Thebes, Negadah, etc. The finds at Adimieh and Esneh are of great importance.

Religsw., Leipzig, 1907, x, 269-294.) Treats of blood and spittle covenants among the Wajagga, a mountain people of the Kilimandjaro region. The more im- portant " blood covenant " is described in detail; the spittle-covenant is per- formed by the two parties alone, as the other, now more ceremonially developed, once was also.

K. thinks that his Australian and Tasmanian material "strikingly confirms the chief results of Rutot's most recent work," but arranges it according to his own independent principles. The parallel between the Australian-Tasmanian ma- terial and that from primitive Europe is many-sided. Rutot's most primitive specimens of the Mesvinian or Rutelian find their counterparts in Australia or in Tasmania. Tertiary man has existed in Europe as well as in Australia.

The Sakei of Su- matra belong with those of Malacca. The Sakei strikingly resemble the Veddas and the dwarfism of the latter may be only secondary. The Sakei have pile- dwellings on land. Unlike the Akett, the Sakei have a great surplus of women. POch (R.) Eine Reise an der Nordost- kiiste von Britisch-Neuguinea. (Globus, 1907, xcII, 277-283, 5 fgs., map.)

The cult is still making headway, not declining. Voo- doo came into the U. S. from Haiti, whither it was carried " by slaves from Ardra and Whydah," where the faith still remains to-day. To ceremonies of the snake god were added human sacrifice and cannibalism, rites of the god Shango. Voodoo came to Louisiana about 18o9. Gonzales de la Rosa (M.)

Koch-Griinberg (T.) Das Haus bei den Indianern Nordwestbrasiliens. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 19o8, N. F., VII, 37-50, 3 pl., 29 fgs.) Describes the maloca or characteristic house of the Indians of N.W. Brazil, situation (on high land), construction (work of men), size (sometimes very large), form (oblong or square with variations; sometimes semi-circular or round foundations), orna- mentation (paintings,- human and ani- mal figures, conventional designs, etc., on walls and posts, - sometimes the designs are in black, red, yellow, and white on a purple-red ground, a common post-design being that of the serpent. Animal figures made of maize-ears and figures of birds and snakes from palm- leaves are hung up in some of the houses, The divisions of the house, furniture, etc.- are treated. The interiors are generally clean. The inhabitants of a maloca (mostly one family, often an old couple with their grown up sons and their families; owing to extra-tribal marriage women speaking entirely different lan- guages are often to be found under the same roof) number from io to Ico and the author testifies to the good behavior and morality of the Indians. Some of the great dance-festivals are held in the malocas. The sick are cared for there and the dead buried under the floor. The maloca "is thus the home of the Indian in life, and in death."

Notes on visit to the American Museum of Natural History (New York), Pea- body Museum (New Haven), Peabody Museum (Cambridge), Panama, parts of Costa Rica, and the Central American antiquities in the various museums, etc. While in Costa Rica Dr L. collected ex- tensive Chirip6 and Bribri vocabularies, measured a number of Indians (among the Chirip6 two physical types occur), made extensive archeological collections from Nicoya and Teraba and obtained a brief vocabulary from Indians of the Rio Lari in Tuls. Among Chirip6 children several cases of " Mongolian spots" ( I -2 yrs. ) in the coccygeal region were noted,- one had a smaller "blue spot" on 'the upper arm. According to the Indians these spots, called sulA~'-fii (" spot of Sula ") indicate that the god- dess SulI' has touched the new-born child with her finger. Marcel (G.) Le PZre Yves d'tvreux. (J.

Haus und Dorf bei den Eingeborenen Nordamerikas. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 190o8, N. F., VII, 119-215, 84 fgs., 3 maps.) This well- documented monograph treats in detail of house and village among the various aboriginal peoples of North America. General culture (collectors and hunters, fishers, "hoe-culture"; nomads, half- sessile,- summer-sedentary and winter- sedentary), general traits of house- architecture (temporary and permanent, sommer and winter houses), material used, peculiarities of house-building (pit, doors and openings, communal houses, in- terior), round (tents of several varieties, houses of bark and wood, straw, grass, 1 eaves, earth-houses, snow-house of Eskimo, etc.) and four-cornered (wedge- style, saddle-roof, wooden-house winter and summer; earth-houses, straw mud houses, Pueblo dwellings). The North American Indian houses " appear every- where as a function of climate and vegetation." Five chief round house and four chief four-cornered types, with numerous variations, are distinguished. In the section in the village (pp. 187- 21II) origin and situation, fortification (also Pueblo as artificial fortification), public buildings, etc. (village-house, sweat-house, village square, etc.), are treated. Of villages 4 types are dis- tinguished ("line village," Pueblo, round village, "weiler"). Influence of European culture can be traced in the villages of the Hurons, etc. Some Eskimo and California villages represent the primitive type. Schmidt (M.) Ueber altperuanische Or- namentik. (Ibid., 22-36, 2 pl., 42 fgs.) Treats of the ornamentation of the pot- tery and textile products of the ancient Peruvian culture of the Ica valley. Ac- cording to Dr M., " the ' textile-square ' in its characteristic form with the diag- onally running step-lines and the figures in the two opposite corners is the basal element of the whole surface-ornameta- tion in the strict sense. This is true of the old Ica material as it is also of that of certain modern Indians of the Xingri region. And a great part of the geo- metric and figurative ornamentation has grown out of the typical models neces- sarily produced in textile technique, e. g., the use of the palm-leaf. There are two chief groups of ornamentation of surface which are distinct in origin, - natural representation entirely independent of textile ornament and that which has arisen first as textile model and then has been applied secondarily as surface orna- ment in the narrower sense." The de- velopment of various figures from the "textile square " is shown both on basketry and pottery (hook-pattern, swastika, certain bird and animal figures, etc.). Interesting is the human figure (fig. 40) which has been developed on a basis of technique and the "textiile square." Schuller (R. R.) Die Araukaner in den Missionen von Siidchile.
