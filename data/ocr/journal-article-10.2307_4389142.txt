XXI, No. 21, WHOLE No. 578 ---- -------~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ REVIEWS Die Religion der Griechen. Erster Band: Von den Anfangen bis Hesiod. Von Otto Kern. Berlin: Weidmann (1926). Pp. viii +308. In no field of classical study have the results of the last hundred years done more to change prevalent conceptions than in the study of Greek religion. Evi- dence of several sorts, archaeological, epigraphical, linguistic, anthropological, and, above all, the study of the literature with a new sense of historical per- spective have revealed unsuspected depths in Greek religious experience. But the task has required great tact and patience and more caution in discriminating between facts and speculative interpretations than some of the investigators have possessed. It is the special merit of Professor Otto Kern that he combines with a wide knowledge of the data a laudable deter- mination to draw only such conclusions as the data will fairly warrant. In the work under review, Die Religion der Griechen, Von den Anfangen bis Hesiod, he cites Greek texts adequately; he draws freely on the con- clusions of numerous German treatises, without often citing the special evidence involved; writings in English and other modern languages he all but completely ignores (a glaring instance is the total omission of any reference to A. B. Cook's work, Zeus). The book is obviously not intended for beginners; if it were, a more systematic exposition of many points would be necessary. The chief argument of the book may be briefly summarized for the benefit of those who are not special- ists in the field. The author first threads his way warily through the earliest phases of pre-Hellenic religion in the Aegean world, fetish stones and blocks of wood, and beast cults (but not totemism, in the strict sense); survivals of these he notes in the epithets of later anthropomorphic gods, and in myths and works of art that represent metamorphoses. He traces the gradual emergence of anthropomorphic divinities, recognizing the transitional stages indicated by the use of empty thrones and such symbols as double axes. An important section deals with the pre-Hellenic chthonian cults, those of the dead being distinguished from those of gods of the underworld. The cult of an Earth-Mother appears to be pre-Hellenic; the Greeks in general introduced male divinities. Some of the pre-Hellenic divinities (notably Demeter) were trans- formed and included in the Olympian religion. The story of the War of the Gods with the Titans is the old- est aetiological myth preserving the memory of the pre-Hellenic religion; some of the epithets of Zeus show clearly his appropriation of the names of earlier mountain gods-for example, the epithet expressing his descent from Kronos, a pre-Hellenic mountain-god. Other survivals of this early religion are to be found in classic and even in modern times in the form of ghosts, witch craft, and the tradition of a 'wild hunt'. The first traces of anthropomorphism are obscure. Apart from the notion of a divine fragrance revealing at times the presence of divinity, Professor Kern finds the germ of the idea of anthropomorphism in the reproductive forces of nature, which seemed to require family relationships. The cult of fertility, prominent in the pre-Hellenic mysteries at Eleusis and elsewhere, thus projected into cosmic forms the human marriage-relationship in a 'sacred marriage', and also permitted diverse cults to be united by myths repre- senting divine genealogies. Interesting survivals show the fusion of anthropomorphic religion with previous cults. Thus we have the Arcadian legend linking Demeter and Poseidon with an ancient horse-cult; and Leto, a pre-Hellenic goddess, is connected with Apollo by the myth of her marriage with Zeus. The conflicts of cults resulted in the complicated family re- lationships of the gods, and often developed the myths of polygamy that have seemed, if they were not under- stood, intrinsically immoral. Again, the hostility of Hades and Persephone, two chthonian divinities, is symbolized by the myth of a marriage by capture. The immortality of the gods is not the original con- ception (there was a 'grave of Zeus' in Crete), but was derived, it seems, from vegetation cults that repre- sented the perennial rebirth of nature. And, finally, when the conception of a 'scul' arose, it took the form of a bird, or of some other winged creature, often in human shape. The gods might come and go; the place of worship, mountain or cave, remained a hallowed spot. Temples were therefore built on the sites of earlier shrines, and attributes of earlier gods were retained. But Professor Kern disputes the current derivation of modem shrines of St. Elias on mountains from a primitive cult of the sun (Helios); Apollo as a sun-god, and Artemis as a moon-goddess were later developments. Apollo was at first a shepherd-god; Artemis, though a great goddess in primitive times, had no great cult (save at Eleusis), and had no temple at Athens (but rather a number of small shrines), because, as Professor Kern argues, her worship was one of the heart and was confined to no special sites. Other gods, such as Ares, presided over special occupations; still others, like Herakles, best distinguished as 'heroes', won divinity through toil. There always remained a class of nameless gods, un- differentiated beings, or beings named onlv by epithets or by terms of relationship, as having significance only as associated with other gods; some, perhaps, remained nameless through rieligious awe. With the beginnings of the Mysteries at Eleusis and the Orphic Mysteries, Professor Kern deals briefly; doubtless the fuller treatment will come in a later volume. He emphasizes, of course, the fact that this form of religion is pre-Hellenic and is in many of its features un-Greek. It may be questioned, however. whether Professor Kern and many other writers sufficiently appreciate the close connection between the askesis of the mysteries, crude though it be, and the qualities of mind and character that are most Greek and that find their perfect expression in Plato and Aristotle. ,Many elements in primitive worship are well re- viewed by Professor Kern: invocations to the gods, like 'konx ompax !', surviving from remote ages and no longer understood by the worshippers; ritual hymns</page><page sequence="2">APRIL 2, 1928S THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY 165 from which gods and epithets were hypostatized (Hymen, Paian, Iakchos); offerings to the gods, closely related to their anthropomorphic character; the build- ing of temples; the absence of a priestly class; ritual dances and the evolutions of bands of mummers; the 'things done' (ta dromena, the original meaning of the expression being narrowed to signify the enactment of a sacred myth-i. e. 'drama':-one at Eleusis was strangely like the Christian Nativity); games, pro- cessions, and consecrations of offerings (especially locks of hair). Next comes an account of the victory of the religion of the Hellenes-the cult of Zeus, the god of heaven, whose site was first at Dodona, and then on Olympus and other mountains. On Nit. Lykaion his worship was fused with an earlier wolf-cult and human sacrifice; elsewhere he absorbed, as Zeus Chthonios or Zeus Meilichios, elements of chthonian cults. At first he was merely the type, translated to heaven, of the heroic absolute monarch, modelled on the character of the earthly princes who claimed descent from him. But he had to find a relationship with earlier gods. Therefore Athene, a pre-Hellenic goddess, was born of him with- out a mother; to other pre-Hellenic goddesses of earth he was married in as many myths. With only one of them, Hera, however, was associated a special site, Argos; she became a goddess of heaven. Poseidon, too, was transformed from being a land-god, presiding over horses, springs, and streams, into his more fa- miliar character as a sea-god. These and other divinities had found their respective functions before the com- position of the Homeric Poems; but, as Herodotus observes in a famous passage (2.53: slighted by Profes- sor Kern), it was chiefly Homer and Hesiod who fixed their functions and attributes in men's minds. As examples of the spread of the cults of individual divin- ities from their original cult-sites, and of their acqui- sition thereby of new traits and functions, Professor Kern deals in some detail with Demeter, Dionysus, and the Kabeiroi (all essentially pre-Hellenic or non- Hellenic, it should be noted). A chapter discusses the work of Hesiod, a peasant, but the exponent of the religion not of Mother Earth but of the Olympians. Professor Kern rightly observes that, in spite of his ethical interest, Hesiod's theogony hardly becomes theology. Yet his thought, containing scarcely a hint of mystical religion, nevertheless was the vessel into which the wine of Dionysus was later poured. A final chapter deals with Eusebeia, reverence first for fetish objects and then for gods who can help mankind. It is a curious fact that, although a familiar trait of the Olympian gods is their 'envy', there is not a trace of this quality in the chthonian gods. It is perhaps first in Hesiod, after all, that we find the idea that the gods are not merely powerful monarchs, and that we can demand even greater moral excellence of them than of men; the idea is carried much further by Aeschylus, aided by the teaching of the Orphics. Professor Kern adduces an interesting array of evi- dence for the presence of reverence or piety among the Greeks: the ritual of daily life and of the calendar; the eternal sanctity of ancient sites and of old offerings once dedicated; the depiction in early art of men as smaller than the gods, and of women kneeling in prayer; the preservation of primitive words in ritual and in magic. But he does well to remark in conclusion that the Greeks were not mere idol-worshippers, and that, though they were mostly conservative ritualists, we shall miss the meaning of their religion if we do not realize that still more significant than their outward piety is their sense of relationship to nature or to a power behind nature, that could evoke, at its best, such a prayer as that of Socrates at the end of Plato's Phaedrusl: 'Beloved Pan, and all ye other gods who haunt this place, give me beauty in the inward soul; and may the outward and the inward man be at one'. This deeper significance of Greek religion, it is to be hoped, Professor Kern will discuss in the later volumes of his work. HARVARD UNIVERSITY WILLIAM C. GREENE</page></plain_text>
