STIGLER Columbia University The growth of individual firms to great size through merger with rivals is an outstanding development of modern econoinic history. As late as 1890, Marshall could view the life history of the firm as a sil- houette of that of man in an age of high infant mortality: the firm began as a small venture; if it survived the early years, it straggled along or grew at a rate governed by the entrepreneur's ability-occasionally reaching large size if his ability was extraordinary or his children's abilities great-but eventually it languished into obscurity and then into oblivion.1 The whole process usually took place, one infers, in one or two generations. I have no reason to question the realism of this picture in the age of noncorporate enterprise; and there are reasons for not wholly abandoning it even today. An anthropomorphic theory of the growth of the firm, however, scarcely fits our modern giants. There are no large American companies that have not grown somewhat by merger, and probably very few that have grown much by the alterna- tive method of internal expansion.2 The present paper seeks to summarize some of the major episodes in the developinent of the merger movement, with special reference to the question of monopoly. The discussion is restricted to so-called "horizontal" combinations, which are quantitatively much the most important form of merger.3 I. Some General Theoretical Considerations We wish to examine the conditions under which it is profitable for competing firms to merge for monopoly. It is expedient to begin with four unpromising assumptions, all of which will be relaxed or defended subsequently: (1) long-run average and marginal cost of production ' Principles of Economics (Sth ed.; London, 1920), Bk. IV, Ch. XI, XII. 2 Unless otherwise indicated, size of the firm is to be measured relative to the size of the industry. 'In 1937, 85.7 per cent of the manufacturing establishments belonging to "central offices" (i.e., multiple-plant firms) were en-aged in "uniform" activities. Of course many of these plants were constructed by the parent concern, and there are other deficiencies in the data, but it is probable that horizontal mergers are more important than all otlher forms of interplant relationship combined (see TNEC Monograph No. 27, The Structure of Industry, p. 164).</page><page sequence="2">2 4 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION are equal for firms of all relevant sizes;4 (2) entry of new firms is free, although not necessarily inexpensive; (3) the demand for the output of the industry is stable; (4) the specialized resources ("fixed factors") employed in the industry are indestructible. Under these conditions, will mergers for monopoly occur? The tempt- ing offhand reply is in the negative, because under these conditions there can be no monopoly profits in the long run; the first two conditions are sufficient to insure this. This offhand reply, however, is to the ques- tion: will mergers for monopoly exist? It is not an answer to our ques- tion: will mergers for monopoly occur? They may occur. The argument that monopolies may be profitable even under these unfavorable conditions will be developed with a partial geometrical illustration. Consider an industry meeting the four conditions listed above and consisting of numerous identical firms which are in long-run competitive equilibrium. Each firm will have the short-run cost curves displayed in Figure 1, and it will be operating at output OA, price OB, FIGURE 1 p Mc D AC AR C A and making no profits. All the firms are now merged into a monopoly, and each plant (= former firm) now has a pro rata share of aggregate demand, AR, with corresponding marginal revenue, MR. Accordingly it operates at output OC and makes profits of OC times DE. Entry of new firms therefore takes place, and the pro rata demand curve of each plant in the merger now shifts to the left, price falls, and profits 4This assumption will be discussed below, but perhaps a remark is called for on the indeterminacy of the output of the firm under competition when its long-run average cost curve is horizontal. The simplest way to eliminate the indeterminacy is to sacrifice the perfection of competition (but nothing else) by having each firm have a demand curve with an elasticity of (say) -100.</page><page sequence="3">CAPITALISM AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION 25 diminish.5 Eventually the number of rivals will grow until the merger is reduced to the long-run equilibrium level of permanent loss, since neither the merger nor the new rivals can withdraw from the industry. The simple but important conclusion to be drawn from this argument is that a merger for monopoly may be profitable, in the sense that the present value of the monopoly profits and (so to speak) monopoly losses is positive. If the entry of new firms is not too rapid, the merger may make monopoly profits for a considerable period; and, even though thereafter the losses are permanent, their discounted value need not be so large as to wipe out the initial gains. The essence of the explanation of mergers under these conditions therefore lies in the time required to achieve long-run equilibrium; and this essence lingers in the more general case. If we relax our assumptions "2," "3," and "4," the prospects of net gain from merger for monopoly are increased in frequently encountered circumstances. If the specialized resources of the merger are not in- destructible, investment can be withdrawn from the industry so that, after the initial period of gain and a subsequent period of loss, the long- run equilibrium will be attained, with the merger receiving a competi- tive rate of return on its investment in the industry.6 If the industry's demand is growing, the amount of resources the merger must withdraw will be reduced; and, if the demand is growing sufficiently rapidly, no investment need be withdrawn: the merger can maintain its absolute size but decline in relative size.7 If the entry of new firms and the ex- pansion of rivals can be hindered or prevented, of course the monopoly profits will accrue for a longer period. If the rate of entry is a function of price and profits, the merger can reduce or retard entry by a lower price policy; in effect it buys a longer period of monopoly at the price of a lower rate of monopoly profits. Let us consider now the mechanics of mergers for monopoly. (We defer the question of why mergers occur when they do.) If there are relatively few firms in the industry, the major difficulty in forming a merger is that it is more profitable to be outside a merger than to be a participant. The outsider sells at the same price but at the much larger output at which marginal cost equals price. Hence the promoter of a merger is likely to receive much encouragement from each firm-almost ' The explicit analysis can be carried through by a conventional application of the dominant-firm analysis; that is, by constructing the demand curve for the monopoly by subtracting from the aggregate quantity demanded at each price the amount that the new firms (acting competitively) will sell (see my Theory of Price [New York, 19461, p. 227). 8The period of loss arises because in general it requires less time to increase than to withdraw investment. 'This assumes (with what validity I do not know) that the rate of entry of new firms will not be increased by the existence of the merger; but see the last point in the para- graph.</page><page sequence="4">26 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION every encouragement, in fact, except participation. In order to over- come this difficulty, it will often be necessary to make the participation of each firm contingent on that of other firms and execute the merger in a single act. We know too little of the theory of coalitions to be able to predict the percentage of the industry that will be merged, but of course it must be fairly high if it is to have any purpose. If there are relatively many firms in the industry, no one firm plays an important role in the formation of the merger; and it is possible for the merger to expand in a more gradual process and acquire firms on less exacting terms. In fact, several firms may enter upon programs of growth by merger. Let us return to our first two assumptions. Our first assumption- that there are neither economies nor diseconomies of scale-will please few beside Euler. Two widely accepted, and somewhat inconsistent, be- liefs clash with this assumption: (1) mergers are effected to obtain the economies of large-scale production and (2) the diseconomies of scale are the chief bulwark of competition. Both these beliefs will be dis- cussed below; here we shall enter briefly into discussion of the validity of the assumption of constant returns to scale. The comparative private costs of firms of various sizes can be meas- ured in only one way: by ascertaining whether firms of the various sizes are able to survive in the industry. Survival is the only test of a firm's ability to cope with all the problems: buying inputs, soothing laborers, finding customers, introducing new products and techniques, coping with fluctuations, evading regulations, etc. A cross-sectional study of the costs of inputs per unit of output in a given period measures only one facet of the firm's efficiency and yields no conclusion on efficiency in the large.8 Conversely, if a firm of a given size survives, we may infer that its costs are equal to those of other sizes of firm, being neither less (or firms of this size would grow in number relative to the industry) nor more (or firms of this size would decline in number relative to the industry). A combination of this argument and casual observation suggests that the economies of scale are unimportant over a wide range of sizes in most American industries, for we commonly find both small and large firms persisting. We shall recur to this matter, but two observa- tions should be made now. The first is that our analysis of mergers still holds if there are minor economies or diseconomies of scale, but fails 8 As commonly conducted, statistical comparisons of costs or rates of return are not even conclusive on the "static" problem. They demand arbitrary asset valuations to avoid the tautological result that differences in costs measure returns on differences in capital values; and they usually cover too short a period to avoid the regression problem (on which, see M. Friedman and S. Kuznets, Incomes from Independent Professional Practice [New York, 19451, Ch. VII).</page><page sequence="5">CAPITALISM AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION 2 7 if they are large. With large diseconomies, mergers are unprofitable; with large economies, monopoly or oligopoly is inevitable, and there will not be many rivals to inerge. The second point is that the equality of private costs carries no implication that social costs of firms of different sizes are equal.9 Free entry-our second assumption-may be defined as the condi- tion that long-run costs of new firms if they enter the industry will be equal to those of firms already in the industry. This does not mean, as many infer, that a new firm can enter and immediately be as profitable as an established firm. We do not begrudge the new firm a decent in- terval in which to build its factory; we should be equally willing to concede a period during which production is put on a smooth-running schedule, trade connections are developed, labor is recruited and trained, and the like. These costs of building up a going business are legitimate investment expenses, and, unless historical changes take place in the market, they must be equal for both established and new firms."0 With this understanding, free entry seems a valid characterization of most American industries. One may concede this and still argue that, because of the large capital requirements necessary to establish a new company of minimum efficient size, free entry is often difficult, and firms in industries with (absolutely) large capital requirements have a sheltered position. I have as little basis for my skepticism of this argu- ment as its many adherents have given for supporting it. This brief discussion leaves many questions about mergers unan- swered. We shall attempt to answer some of them-and in the process discover new questions-by an examination of the merger movement in America. We shall find it useful to divide this history into two periods, in which monopoly and oligopoly, respectively, were the primary goals. II. Ml erger f or Monopoly The era of merger for monopoly ended in this country roughly in 1904, when the Northern Securities decision made it clear that this ave- nue to monopoly was also closed by the antitrust laws. The transition was abrupt in a historical sense. It is revealed by the fact that the United States Steel Corporation, which had quietly picked up in 1902-04 'A comparison of the social costs of firms of different sizes would require, for example, the elimination of differences in private costs arising out of differences in "bargaining power" in purchasing inputs. It is tempting to argue that if the large firm is not more efficient than the small firm in private terms, it is less efficient in social terms (for then its monopolistic advantages are eliminated). I am inclined to yield to the temptation, al- though small firms have some private advantages (chain-store taxes) and large firms have private disadvantages (maintaining good public relations). 10On this view, the infant-industry argument for tariffs is mistaken (at least when ex- ternal economies do not enter).</page><page sequence="6">28 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION a few steel firms overlooked in the haste of organization, felt it neces- sary to obtain permission from President Theodore Roosevelt to acquire the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company in 1907.11 When and why did the merger movement begin? Sporadic mergers, often founded on marriage, are no doubt as ancient as man; probably for long they were occasional and relatively small in scale, and they were offset by the divestitures necessary to endow sons in a more fer- tile age. In this country mergers for monopoly began on a large scale only in the eighties, they reached a minor peak at the beginning of the nineties, and they attained their pinnacle at the end of the century.12 Our theory is that mergers for monopoly are profitable under easy assumptions that were surely fulfilled in many indtustries well before the mergers occurred. The only persuasive reason I have found for their late occurrence is the development of the modern corporation and the modern capital market. In a regime of individual proprietorships and partnerships, the capital requirements were a major obstacle to buy- ing up the firms in an industry, and unlimited liability was a major obstacle to the formation of partnerships. General incorporation laws antedate the Civil War,"3 but the powers of these early corporations were severely limited. They could not hold stock in other corporations; they could not merge with another cor- poration; limits were placed on their capitalization; often they could not do business outside the state of incorporation; exchange of capital assets for stock required the unanimous consent of the stockholders; etc. Only in the eighties did New Jersey initiate the competition among states for corporations, which in twenty years eliminated almost every restriction on mergers.'4 In this same period the New York Stock Ex- change developed into an effective market for industrial securities. "lUnion Steel (1902), Troy Steel Products (1903), and Clairton Steel (1904) together had twice the ingot capacity of Tennessee' Coal and Iron. On the last merger, see the hearings of the Stanley Committee, Hearings before the Committee [of the House] on Investigation of United States Steel Corporation (Washington, 1911), Parts 1-6. 12 The number of combinations with capitalization of 1 million dollars or more, as compiled by Luther Conant, varied as follows: 1887 ................. 8 1892 ................. 10 1897 ................. 4 1888 ................. 3 1893 ................. 6 1898 ................. 20 1889 ..... . 12 1894 ................. 2 1899 ................. 8 7 1890 ................. 13 1895 ................. 6 1900 ................. 42 1891 ................. 17 1896....... 5 (Eliot Jones, Thte Trust Problem in the United Sta'tes [New York, 1921], p. 39.) There was an earlier era of railroad consolidations (see, e.g., George P. Baker, The Formation of the New England Railroad Systems [Cambridge, 1937], especially Ch. XI). 1 See G. H. Evans, Business Incorporations in the United States, 1800-1943 (New York, 1948). 14 See E. Q. Keasbey, "New Jersey and the Great Corporations," Harvard Law Review, 1899-1900, pp. 198-212, 264-278; W. C. Noyes, A Treatise on the Law of Intercorporate Relations (Boston, 1902), and, especially, R. C. Larcom, The Delaware Corporation (Baltimore, 1937).</page><page sequence="7">CAPITALISM AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION 29 These institutional changes seem to be the proximate causes for the development of the merger movement in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Almost invariably the leading firms joined together simultaneously, as our theory leads us to expect.15 The combinations frequently attained high percentages of national output but seldom became strict monopo- lies. The contemporary estimates of their shares of the market are rough, and little attention was paid by the estimators to the shares of the firm in particular geographical and product markets. With these provisos, we may note that the mean share of the market controlled by the mergers studied by the Industrial Commission was 71 per cent.'6 In the ninety-two large mergers studied by Moody, the distribution by share of market was similar: seventy-eight controlled 50 per cent or more of the output of the industry; fifty-seven controlled 60 per cent or more; and twenty-six controlled 80 per cent or more."7 Even in Dewing's fourteen industries in which the mergers failed, the mean percentage was 54.18 Almost invariably the share of the merger in the market declined substantially as time went on. Sometimes the entry of new firms was suc- cessfully prevented or delayed by ruthless warfare (National Cash Register), patents (Eastman, United Shoe Machinery), or coercion of suppliers or buyers (American Tobacco). These instances are not numerous, however, and such tactics were successful chiefly in small in- dustries; in steel, sugar refining, agricultural implements, leather, rub- ber, distilleries, cans, etc., the dominant company lost ground relative to the industry.'9 Why was merger preferred to collusion? Part of the answer lies in the prima facie illegality of collusion after 1890. This point should not be pressed, however. The effectiveness of the Sherman Law in dealing with conspiracies was not clear until 1899, when the Addyston Pipe case was decided;2" and there was a contemporaneous wave of amal- gamations in England, where conspiracies were unenforcible but not ac- 15 The most prominent exception, Standard Oil, is in on-e sense no exception. It is more an instance of involuntary merger, and its history seems to me one of the relatively few cases appropriately analyzed in analogy to warfare.

I am inclined to place considerable weight upon one other advantage of merger: it permitted a capitalization of prospective monopoly profits and a distribution of a portion of these capitalized profits to the professional promoter. The merger enabled a Morgan or a Moore to enter a new and lucrative industry: the produc- tion of monopolies. It is sobering to reflect on the attitudes of professional economists of the period toward the merger movement. Economists as wise as Taussig, as incisive as Fisher, as fond of competition as Clark and Fetter, insisted upon discussing the movement largely or exclusively in terms of industrial evolution and the economies of scale. They found no difficulty in treating the unregulated corporation as a natural phe- nomenon, nor were they bothered that the economies of scale should spring forth suddenly and simuiltaneously in an enormous variety of industries-and yet pass over the minor firms that characteristically persisted and indeed flourished in these industries.

Merger for Oligopoly One great change has taken place in the merger movement since the Northern Securities decision: the share of the industry merged into one firm has fallen sharply. In the early period, as we have seen, the leading firm seldom merged less than 50 per cent of the industry's output; in the later period the percentage has hardly ever risen this high. The new goal of mergers is oligopoly. The change has been most striking in the industries which were merged for monopoly at the beginning of the century. The merger firm has declined continuously and substantially relative to the industry in almost every case. The dominant firm did not embark on a new program of merger to regain its monopolistic position, however; the new merg- ers were undertaken by firms of the second class. The industry was transformed from near-monopoly to oligopoly. Cement, cans, petroleum, automobiles, agricultural implements, and glass are examples. We may illustrate the development by the steel industry (Table 1): United States Steel's share of ingot production dropped sharply, but the com- pany absorbed only two small rivals (Columbia Steel, 1930; Geneva plant, 1945), and the chief mergers have been Bethlehem and Republic. Even if one lumps together the (say) four largest firms in the industry, in general there has been a decline in the concentration of production.22 TABLE 2 MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS IN CENTRAL OFFICES, 1919 AND 1937 Industry 1919 1937 Food and kindred products .............................. 4,544 8,529 Textiles and their products .............................. 2,832 2,703 Iron and steel and their products. 1 ,602 2,420 Lumber and its remanufactures . .2,829 2,390 Leather and its finished products . .495 503 Paper and printing . .918 1,865 Liquors and beverages. 268 738 Chemicals and allied products . .2,409 2,800 Stone, clay, and glass products . .1,100 1,325 Metal and metal products other than iron and steel . . 445 530 Tobacco manufactures . .533 124 Vehicles for land transportation . .287 390 Miscellaneous industries . .1,362 1,382 Total ............................................... 19,624 25,665 Source: 1919 data from W.

"See my Five Lectures, pp. 63ff.</page><page sequence="10">32 AMIERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION The merger movement has also reached the many-firm industries in the later period. We may measure mergers between 1919 and 1937 in a rough fashion by comparing the number of manufacturing establish- ments belonging to central offices at the two dates (Table 2); it appears that the food industry was the chief center of merger activity, although the paper and printing and iron and steel industries also saw much merger activity. National Dairy is perhaps the most striking example of merger in the food industries-it acquired 331 firms in the decade ending in 1933 3-but Borden, General Foods, General Mills, and the bakery chains also date from this period.24 In general, such mergers led to local oligopoly in the primary products (fluid milk, bread, etc.) and to national oligopoly in lesser products such as cheese. The Sherman Law seems to have been the fundamental cause for the shift from merger for monopoly to merger for oligopoly. Sometimes its workings were obvious, as when Standard Oil was dismembered and when the leading baking mergers were prevented from combining.25 More often, however, its workings have been more subtle: the ghost of Senator Sherman is an ex officio member of the board of directors of every large company. This explanation for the new direction of merg- ers is vulnerable to the criticisms that it is simple and obvious, but no plausible alternative explanation is available.26 It is my impression-based chiefly upon the more modest issuance of securities of mergers and the apparent ease of entry into the new merging industries-that the mergers for oligopoly in the later period have been less effective in restraining or postponing competition than the earlier mergers for monopoly. This is not to argue, however, that they left competition as they found it; indeed, the one important weakness in the Sherman Act as it is sometimes interpreted is the belief that oligopoly affords a satisfactory form of organization of our economy. This belief is apparently held, as it was certainly fostered, by one of the greatest of contemporary judges, Learned Hand, the author of the famous dictum that control by one firm of 64 per cent of an industry may not be monopoly and that 33 per cent surely is not.27 It is true, no doubt, that oligopoly is a weaker form of monopolization than the single firm, but it is not so weak a form that it can be left to its own devices. If this view-which is almost universally held by modern economists-is 23 Federal Trade Commission, Agricultural Income Inquiry (Washington, 1938), I, p. 237. 24 There was also much merging in fuel and ice; City Ice and Fuel is perhaps the largest merger, but several others, such as American Ice and Atlantic Company, were very active. 25Agricultural Income Inquiry, I, p. 308. 2? Is is suggestive that mergers for monopoly continued to be typical in England in the twenties (see Patrick Fitzgerald, Industrial Combination in England [London, 1927]). 27". . . it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four per cent would be enough [to con- stitute monopoly]; and certainly thirty-three per cent is not" (United States v.

IV. Conclusions The foregoing survey of the merger movement raises a set of inter- related questions; they concern the economies of scale, the capital market, and the entry of firms into an industry. The broad sweep of our discussion would suggest that the private diseconomies of large-scale production are only an occasional and minor barrier to merger for monopoly. The chief barriers to monopoly, in ad- dition to the Sherman Act, have been the capital requirements of merg- ers and the tendency of rivals to grow in number and size. To find in an imperfect capital market a bulwark of competition seems paradoxical, but the paradox is not deep. Until recent times the personal distribution of wealth set a limit upon the size of firms, and modern economic societies have been sufficiently egalitarian to make personal monopolization of large industries impossible. The corporation and the securities markets have severed the connection between per- sonal wealth and industrial size and thus weakened the institutional basis of competitive enterprise. The diseconomies of scale offer a weak supplement to the limitations once provided by personal wealth. Properly interpreted, conventional theory does not contradict this tentative finding. We customarily find in entrepreneurship the limitation to the size of firm, and we find the chief tasks of the entrepreneur arising out of uncertainty. Much, al- though of course not all, uncertainty stems from the competitive be- havior of rivals, so that entrepreneurship may well be subject to in- creasing returns to relative size as well as to decreasing returns to abso- lute size, with no clear verdict for either force over a wide range of sizes. We are thus led to "new entry" as the chief defense of competition- a most unseemly reversion to the ruling economic theory of 1900. It is now popular to deprecate the importance of new entry because few firms can accumulate the capital necessary to produce efficiently in the great industries. To the extent that the criticism rests on the alleged economies of scale, I have argued that it is mistaken; to the extent that it rests on imperfections of the capital market it runs contrary to (but is not necessarily inconsistent with) the argument we have advanced that the capital market has been improving-in certain directions, at least-too much! Yet there is support for the skeptics of easy entry in the fact that the mergers for monopoly have frequently been very profitable.</page><page sequence="12">3 4 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION Such inconclusive conclusions are not too troublesome. This paper is designed to be only an introduction to the merger problem. To this end, it is sufficient if I emphasize again the significance of the movement. To the theorist it offers a stimulating challenge: the merger movement does not fit too well inito the received categories of stable competition and irresistible monopoly. To the student of social policy it offers the promis- ing hypothesis: it is possible to change the trend of industrial organiza- tion by the lackadaisical enforcement of an antitrust law. And to the student of social sciences it offers the supremely optimistic-and pessi- mistic-suggestion: when economists agree that a movement is inevi- table, it is not.</page></plain_text>
