<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOUTHERN IDAHO PLAIN: IMPLICATIONS FOR FREMONT-SHOSHONI RELATIONSHIPS IN SOUTHWESTERN IDAHO by Mark G. Plew ABSTRACT It is proposed that a new pottery type referred to as "Southern Idaho Plain" be recognized to distinguish a more finely made pottery than the classic thick walled, flat-bottomed vessels characteristically referred to as "Shoshoni" ware. Strong similarities of this pottery with Great Salt Lake Gray variants, suggests the extension of a Fremont or Sevier pottery tradition into southern Idaho. Much of the pottery found in the Great Basin has been traditionally referred to as "Shoshoni" ware (Coale, 1963; Metzer, 1976; Rudy, 1953; Thomas and Bettinger, 1976; and Touhy, 1956). The purpose of this paper is to suggest with specific reference to Idaho that the general tendency to lump pottery under the rubric of "Shoshoni" ware has resulted in misrepresenting apparent ceramic variations within Idaho and has complicated the problems of discussing origins and distribu tion of possible variations. The terms "ware and type" have been used rather loosely to describe variations within Shoshoni pottery. Owing to the lack of consistent and well controlled data regarding much of this pottery, and its distribution it is difficult to adhere to the more traditional taxonomic ordering of ceramics characteristic of the Southwest (see Colton, 1952). Fowler (1968: 10) in a brief discussion of Shoshoni pottery has indicated that such modified usage of these terms is perhaps appropriate in discussions of Shoshoni pottery. That variation exists within "Shoshoni" ware and specifically Idaho wares has been previously recognized by Rudy (1953: 97-98) and Touhy (1956: 68) Gruhn (1961: 100) and Neudorfer (1976: 53). Gruhn (ibid) has noted the need for a refined classification of such wares in order to "determine more precisely the geographical distribution and chrono logical sequence of the types."

Southern Idaho pottery producing sites. 329</page><page sequence="2">Shoshoni pottery in the Great Basin and Plains has been summarized or noted by a number of writers including Butler (1978: 70-71), Coale (1963: 1-11), de Laguna (1947: 247), Fowler (1968: 10-13), Mulloy (1952), Rudy (1953), Touhy (1973: 54-78) and Wedel (1954: 406-408). Touhy has described "Idaho Shoshoni Ware" (1956) and has defined and further described a type variant called "Riddle Textile Impressed," the type site being near Riddle, Idaho (Touhy, 1963: 62-63; Touhy and Palombi, 1972: 46-48). The present paper suggests that some of the variation noted within what has generally been called "Shoshoni" ware, constitutes a separate pottery type. Consequently, some of the pottery which has been previously considered "Shoshoni ware or variations of such pottery, may be more appropriately referred to as a distinct type. This will permit a more precise determination of the temporal and spatial distribution of Idaho ceramics. The present investigation does not represent an exhaustive analysis of all Idaho ceramics, but a tentative proposal based on the examination of representative sherd samples from selected pottery producing sites in the state and ceramic descriptions within the literature. Unfortunately, we do not really know any more about the distribution and origin of such wares than we did when Gruhn (ibid.) observed the need for a refined classification. In this vein, the prime objective of this paper is to point to the lack of systematic study of Idaho pottery and again suggest the need for recognition of variations and subsequent refinements in our classification of these types. During the course of an inventory survey of the Camas Creek drainage in south-central Owyhee County, Idaho (Plew, 1976), a number of smooth well made thin walled sherds were recovered from four campsites. The campsites are located within a sagebrush juniper zone at elevations of 5650-5700 feet within the Owyhee Uplands and are associ ated with Camas Meadows and an intensive occupation tentatively cross-dated at A.D. 600-1200. These sherds were believed to be distinct from the common "Shoshoni" ware and somewhat similar to plain Fremont forms. Subsequent examination of southern Idaho pottery collections and the regional literature indicated the occurrence of such pottery at a number of sites throughout Idaho. The ware in question is a thinner walled, finer tempered and much smoother finished (in fact occasionally polished) ware than the common "Shoshoni" type. Additionally, there appear to be consistent differences in terms of coloration, temper, core texture, surface finish, wall thickness and finally vessel form. I have chosen to refer to this better made pottery as Southern Idaho Plain Ware. For comparative purposes, type descriptions for "Shoshoni" ware and Southern Idaho Plain follow: "Shoshoni Ware" (after Rudy, 1953: 94) Construction: Coiled and molded Firing: Uncontrolled atmosphere (?) Core Color: Generally reddish brown, ranging from dark gray through reddish brown to almost black. Temper: Variable; when reviewed with a hand lens it appears as quartz sand ranging from fine to coarse, with occasional fragments of a light, opaque angu lar material and small amounts of mica. The thin section analysis shows the temper to be "crushed granitic rock or subangular sand that has been derived from granitic rock." Core Texture: Coarse, occasionally medium. Surface Finish: Poorly smoothed; scraped by a stick; striations common. Surface undulating. Occasion al sherds well smoothed but not polished. Surface Color: Reddish brown or buff, occasionally gray grading into dark brown; some almost black. Vessel Walls: Strong to friable?principally friable. Shapes: "Flower pots" and jars with pointed bases. Ethnographic reports also indicated bowls. Rims: Straight and out-curved. Wall Thickness: Average, 7 mm; range, from 4 to 8.5 mm. Decorative Techniques: Occasionally fingernail impressions vertically placed in horizontal bands just below the rims; most sherds plain. Tuohy's (1956: 61-65) classification of "Idaho Sho shoni Wares" generally conforms to the type descrip tion given by Rudy. Southern Idaho Plain Ware Construction: Coiling and scraping Firing: Reducing atmosphere Core Color: Dark gray/black/dark brown Temper: Fine Sand containing quartz/occasionally basalt or other crushed granitic material/mica. Material appears to be locally acquired. Core Texture: Medium to relatively fine Surface Finish: Smooth. Striations are usually not vis ible, with a light polish occurring on some sherds. Luster: Dull to waxy Surface Color: Gray/gray-brown/beige with oc casional dark black sherds Vessel Walls: Strong 330</page><page sequence="3">Vessel Shape: Mainly body sherds representing what frequently appear to be bowl forms. Occasional evidence of globular vessels with vertical-necks. Rim Form: Straight to excurvate with occasional marked lips which are flat and well smoothed. Wall Thickness: Average range is 4-5 mm in diameter. Occasional specimens may be 7 mm. Decorative Techniques: None Flat bottomed "Shoshoni" vessels tend to taper outward from heavy bases 10-12 mm thick (see Tuohy, 1956: 56-65) to relatively thin rim sections. This may result in misident ification of some sherds. It is also noteworthy that the range for wall thickness given by Rudy (1953: 94), for "Shoshoni" ware, falls within the range for Great Salt Lake and Snake Valley Gray Wares (see for a refine ment of the classification Madsen, 1977: 1-19), and the range provided for Southern Idaho Plain. This suggests that the traditional use of wall thickness as a simple means of classifying "Shoshoni" pottery may not be a consistently reliable method. It is obvious from the comparison of these two types that there are similarities between the wares. The fact, however, that these types are con sistently separable on the basis of technical criteria indicates the need for an evaluation and refinement in the classification of the pottery in Southern Idaho. DISCUSSION Southern Idaho Plain Ware corresponds to the better made pottery described by Touhy from Indian Point and Little Canyon Creek near the Snake River and a single sherd from eastern Owyhee County (Tuohy, 1956: 66, 1963:64). It generally resembles Wilson Butte Plain Ware (Gruhn, 1961: 99-100). Gruhn (1961) considered this pottery to be a variety of "Shoshoni" ware, although it was better made, marked by round bottomed vessel forms and contained fingernail incisions under the rim. In this regard, Gruhn (1961) cites a communication from Rudy (see Gruhn, 1961: 99-100) who considered the ware to be "Shoshoni" but similar to Deep Creek Buff. Deep Creek Buff as defined by Malouf (1946: 120) is a Fremont type pottery. Malouf notes (1946: 120) the occasional difficulty of distinguishing Deep Creek Buff from "Sho shoni" ware but indicates that the pottery is well made and is characterized by round bottoms and handles. In general, there is a a Fig. 2. a-b, Southern Idaho Plain Ware rim sherds. need to reconsider the classification of the pottery in southern Idaho to determine if some of the pottery presently considered to be variations of typical "Shoshoni" ware are not more closely related to Fremont-Sevier types in Utah. The pottery from the Meadow Creek Rockshelter (Powers, 1969: 35) is less well made but similar to Wilson Butte Plain Ware in the punctate designs below its rims, which are similar to Fremont designs. This and the pottery from Wilson Butte Cave may represent variations of Southern Idaho Plain. Other references to what has been defined as Southern Idaho Plain include: Bucy (1971), Cinadr (1976), Plew (1976, 1979) and Tuohy and Swanson (1960) (see Table 1, Figure 1). Generally, the strongest evidence for South ern Idaho Plain Ware is found in the area close to or south of the Snake River. Test excavations at sites in the Camas and Pole Creek drainages, Owyhee County, Idaho have demonstrated an association of South ern Idaho Plain sherds with Rose Spring-East gate series projectile points (Plew, 1976, n.d.). The chronological dates assigned to this series includes dates within a range of 680 B.C.-A.D. 1720 (Hester and Heizer, 1973: 7-8). The majority of dates fall between A.D. 900-1100. Bucy (1971: 24) noted Southern Idaho Plain pottery in a surface context with Eastgate series projectile points near Twin Falls, Idaho. These associations suggest that ceramics were present in southwestern Idaho 331</page><page sequence="4">somewhat earlier than the A.D. 1700 date assigned to its arrival by Swanson et al. (1964: 9). This range approximates Gruhn's (1961: 101) dating of the plain ware from Wilson Butte Cave. Indeed the Camas Creek associa tion of Southern Idaho Plain sherds with Rose Spring-Eastgate series projectile points may represent some of the earliest pottery in southwestern Idaho. Neudorfer (1976: 52) has radiocarbon dated seven sherds from an earth oven in southeastern Idaho at A.D. 1222. As noted, Southern Idaho Plain ware sherds resemble Fremont forms with respect to descriptive attributes. In fact, the technical type description provided in this paper for Southern Idaho Plain is very similar to that of Great Salt Lake and Snake Valley Gray wares (see Madsen, 1977 for recent type refine ment). The possibility that what I have called Southern Idaho Plain is in fact Fremont pottery is an intriguing and not altogether fanciful notion. The extension of Fremont manifestations into Nevada (Loud and Harr ington, 1929; Wheeler, 1942; Fowler, Madsen and Hattori, 1973), Colorado (Burgh and Scoggin, 1948; Burgh, 1950; Breternitz, 1970; Irwin and Irwin, 1959; Lister, 1951; Worming ton, 1955) and Wyoming (Sharrock 1966) are well known. Fremont encursions into southern Idaho are not well documented. It is noteworthy that Aikens (1966: 3), presumably on the basis of its similarity to Deep Creek Buff, considers the pottery at Wilson Butte Cave to be Fremont pottery. Because of the similarities between Southern Idaho Plain, Great Salt Lake Gray and variants such as Knolls Gray (Marwitt, 1970: 72), I am inclined to consider some of this pottery to be of Fremont origin. Indeed, some of the pottery from Southern Idaho probably marks the extension of a Fremont-Sevier tradition into the area. Mater ial culture similarities include projectile points, groundstone, pecked and smoothed stone balls and petroglyphs. A knowledge of clay modeling is indicated by the occurrence of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines from Dry Creek Rockshelter near Boise (Webster, 1978: 14) and Columbet Creek Rockshelter (Lynch and Olsen, 1964: 10) along the western Snake River in Owyhee County. Bonnichsen (1964: 33) recovered Fremont-like figurines from a cremation site near the Snake River in southwestern Idaho. a c Fig. 3. a-c, Southern Idaho Plain Ware rim sherds. These figurines and the zoomorphic repre sentation from Columbet Creek Rockshelter are associated with Rose Spring-Eastgate series points (Bonnichsen, 1964: 28). The Rattlesnake Canyon site is also characterized by bi-points called Bliss points (Bonnichsen, 1964:28-29), which are found at Camas Creek (Plew, 1979: 53). Gruhn (1961: 100) recovered four cigar shaped objects and a clay disk from the uppermost levels of Wilson Butte Cave. Whole pottery vessels of a non-Shoshoni type, include a ladle from southwestern Idaho near Boise (Swanson et al., 1964: 9) and a polished round bottomed vessel from Ameri can Falls (Tuohy and Swanson, 1960: 22). It is also naive to assume that the indigenous or pre-Shoshonean peoples of the area were incapable of pottery manufacture. In a recent monograph, Madsen and Lindsay (1977) have suggested that Sevier and Parawan Fremont regional variants be con sidered a separate cultural entity from the core San Rafael Fremont of the Colorado Plateau. They argue convincingly that the western Fremont variants are characterized by 332</page><page sequence="5">pottery making hunters and gatherers whose dependence upon agriculture was minimal. This is particularly important with regard to the general tendency to view pottery pro ducers as relatively sedentary peoples. This recognition is a significant step in defining what may be localized centers of pottery manufacture pre-dating what is believed to be the arrival of pottery into various areas in the Plains and Basin. While the position of this paper is that a Fremont-Sevier tradition may have extended into southern Idaho prior to the Shoshonean expansion, it does not preclude the possible distribution of a Fremont-Sevier technology by northward expanding Numic peoples. Madsen (1975) has archaeologically demon strated the Numic expansion model and suggested that Shoshoneans may have moved into Southern Idaho ca. A.D. 1300 1400. This corresponds to Gruhn's dating (ibid.) of Wilson Butte Plain Ware at ca. A.D. 1300 and would fall within the general range determined for Camas Creek (Plew, 1976: 36) and the Twin Falls county sites (Bucy, 1971: 24). As noted, the presence of pottery in Southeastern Idaho has been radiocarbon dated at A.D. 1222 by Neudorfer (1976: 52). Additionally, Keyser (1975) has suggested that the distribution of the shield bearing warrior motif is associated with the northward movement and expansion of the Shoshon eans. Southern Idaho Plain occurs in general context with shield petroglyphs at Camas Creek (Plew, 1976b: 112) and at other sites in southwestern Idaho (Plew, n.d.). Fowler, Madsen and Hattori (1973) and Madsen (1975) note the contemporaneity of Fremont and Shoshonean occupations in Eastern Nevada and have suggested the possibility of considerable group interaction. In this context some of the better made pottery in southwest and southcentral Idaho may be associated with the Shoshonean expansion and represent a Shoshoni know ledge of Fremont pottery making techniques. The distribution of a Fremont-Sevier tech nology by northward expanding Shoshoneans could account for the presence of "Sho shoni" ware and Southern Idaho Plain in the same contexts. In summary, I have proposed the definition of a new pottery type referred to as "Southern Idaho Plain." The type which as described in this paper is more finely made and distinguishable from crude, flat-bottomed "classic" Shoshoni vessels. The pottery exhibits similarities with certain Great Salt Lake Fremont and Sevier types. Although its distribution throughout Southern Idaho is Table 1. Sites Containing Southern Idaho Plain.
