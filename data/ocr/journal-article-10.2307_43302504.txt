<plain_text><page sequence="1">Problems of Iconometry: Comparing the Citrasūtra with the Citralaksana • • Matteo Martelli In Tibetan art, models - both pictorial and sculptural - must follow definite icono- graphie and iconometric canons. In fact the image of a god becomes recognizable and sacred only if some standard rules are respected concerning the colour, the body position, the sacred emblems held in the hands, definite proportions and so forth. Any aesthetic element should be always subordinate to the system of religious and philo- sophical beliefs underlying every religious artwork. First of all a statue or a painting is an expression of devotion to the god, an attempt on the part of the artist to under- stand its religious essence, which may be conpared to the meditation of an ascetic. This mystical and religious connotation of art is very clearly shown in the texts we are going to take into consideration. In chapter 40 of the Citrasūtra , after facing the tech- nical problem of preparing its background, the author clearly states that a painting can only be started on definite days (sacred to the gods, following precise astronomical calculations) and that the artist, in white clothes, and with a pure body and soul, must contemplate the god he is going to represent, after reading the sacred hymns of the Vedic seers. He is not just required to make a fine painting or a beautiful statue, but he must portray the deity as it is, so that the believer can recognize and worship. In the Citralaksana (ch.2) one can read that the gods developed their anthropomorphic shape, after the instructions of Brahmā, their creator. They made themselves beautiful in proportions, developed harmoniously both their main and minor limbs, and decked themselves with weapons and precious jewels. In that way they could be worshipped in their might with prayers, offerings and sacrifices. Therefore, if the field of icono- metry is to be taken into consideration, an artist must know the divine bodily measure- ments and the proportions of the different limbs, in order to make an image with a real religious value which can become an object of worship. Such concern is very common in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist, as well as in Tibetan art, whose iconometric patterns are based on the translation of important Sanskrit texts, which are included in the Buddhist Canon. In fact, even though one should consider first of all the modus operandi of individual artists and schools,1 the religious texts which present detailed descriptions of the gods are regarded as essential for the painter and the sculptor. There is no doubt that the Citrasūtra, included in the Visņudharmottara-purāņa, and the Citralaksana , hold an important position. The former is one of the most ancient Hindu texts based on a deep analysis of visual arts, dated between the sixth and seventh century A.D. The latter, dating back around the same period, is one of the four Indian texts devoted to iconometry which were included in the bsTan 'gyur.2 In my opinion, a comparison between these two texts may offer interesting clues to understand while studying the cultural continuity linking the religious and artistic Indian world to the Tibetan one.</page><page sequence="2">1 50 THE TIBET JOURNAL In fact, even though there is no evidence of a Tibetan translation of the Citrasūtra,3 its numerous points of contact with the Citralaksaņa show how much of the Indian tradition of citra has been included in the Buddhist tradition of the Land of Snows. Although the Citralaksaņa belongs to the Buddhist tradition, it surely goes back to the same Hindu background to which the Citrasūtra belongs. This is clearly confirmed both by its beginning, where numerous Brahmanical deities appear,4 and by the two narrations of the mythological origin of painting (ch.l and ch.2), where the god Brahmā appears as the main protagonist. In the first chapter Brahmā appears as an intermediary in the furious struggle between the god of the dead Yama and the king rNam grags 'jigs thul, a rightful man who knows the dharma. In fact, the latter wanted Yama to bring back to life the young son of a brahman , who was desperate for his loss. But the god refused to grant his request and therefore there was a terrific fight. Thanks to his powers, the king was the winner and succeeded in defeating the servants of Yama (pretäh , "the spirits of the dead"). All living creatures and the inhabitants of the underworld quaked with fear and only the intervention of the god Brahmā succeeded in bringing back peace. He called the sovereign Nagnajit, because he had been able to win the nagnãh pretãh (the naked pretāh ), and ordered him to paint an accurate image of the brahman's son, into whom he then infused life again. Then, after praising that wonderful painting,5 he sent Nagnajit to Višvakarman, so that he could learn all the rules of art. In the second chapter, as previously said, Brahmā appears again as the creator of the deities and of the world, giving the gods the canons to take on an anthropomorphic look. The text (ch.2, 432-527) reads:6 [...]After Brahmā had finished this task,7 he directed his mind to the thoughts of the salvation of the Creation. As he was immersed in these thoughts his spiritual state produced such an effect that all beings, Kings and Gods, now possessed of the knowledge of the name, offered him humble worship constantly and without cessation. Through these thoughts of Brahmā, Mahādeva, Visņu, Indra and all the Gods received great blessing. Through their own power, they became handsome in proportions and merits, and became like those that are endowed with good characteristic attributes [...] In spite of the fact that the narration of the birth of citra does not take such an important space, also in the Citrasūtra we find a story similar to the one told in the first chapter of the Citralaksaņa. The first lines of chapter 35 read:8 And now I will tell you the sūtrā about art, O sinless man. The Citrasūtra is ancient, O king coming from yourself, a work of the wise Nārāyaņa Who wished to do well to the worlds and created Urvasi To deceive the heavenly women who had approached him. After taking some mango juice,9 the great wise man drew10 on his thigh A pretty girl, endowed with as much beauty as a handsome apsaras. All heavenly maids, as they saw her, went away in shame. The great sage, in fact after painting a picture which followed the canons depiction, Became the infallible Višvakarman. A representation of the three worlds is included in art, in the same way as in dance.</page><page sequence="3">PROBLEMS OF ICONOMETRY. ..151 In both tales, the birth of visual arts and mainly of painting is therefore connected with the figure of Visvakarman, the great divine architect, similar to the creator god Prajāpati, who is present in the Indian subcontinent since the cosmogonie hymns of the Veda. Surely the same cultural and religious layer is the basis for both texts, which also resemble in the technical parts related to the measures and rules of visual repre- sentation. In fact both accounts, after emphasizing the importance of figurative arts by explain- ing their origin and functions, enter the core of the topic with a detailed analysis of the proportions and features of figures. The third chapter in the Citralakçam is totally devoted to iconometry. The god Visvakarman addresses the noble king by saying (ch.3, 528-539): "Brahmā himself has expounded for me on the different bodily proportions of the kings and other beings. I will explain these methods of measurement to you, as will you do it to other men [...]". 11 Then there is the explanation of the measurement system on the basis of its fundamental units. The smallest measure is the atom (Skt. paramānu or trasarenu , Tib. rdul phra rab), from which all the others are drawn by multiplying them subse- quently by eight: 8 atoms = 1 point of a hair (Skt. aņu, Tib. skra 7 rise mo). 8 points of a hair = 1 nit (Skt. liks or liksā, Tib. sro ma).12 8 nits = 1 louse (Skt. yãkà or yükay Tib. shig). 8 lice = a grain of barley (Skt. yava , Tib. nas). 8 grains of barley = 1 finger [Skt. angula Tib. sor (or sor mo)].13 In the end the figure of the ideal Indian monarch, the cakravartin (lit. "he who turns the wheel") is analysed following a well-defined order: after giving the total measure of the height, the text analyses of the individual sizes of the head, bust, legs, feet, hands and arms, and finally of the shoulders. In the Citrasütra only chapters 35 and 36 deal with the same subject with the same coherence. First the general measures are given (ch.35), then the ones related to the individual parts of the body (ch.36), some of them, such as the head, hands and feet, in a rather detailed way, and others, such as the bust and the arms, rather scantily. There are no measures mentioned before the descriptions, though the angula is used; in chapter 35, 1 1, we find: "[...] A tāla is 12 angula long, this is what was laid down". Furthermore the text distinguishes five purusas,14 that is five varieties of men, each with his own measures;15 but after giving the height of each of them, it describes only the first one, the hamsa , stating that the proportions of the others can be drawn from that one. The figure of the hamsa looks almost exactly like that of the cakravartin , starting from the total height of 108 angula. Besides, in chapter 40, the Citrasütra states that the cakravartin are to be represented by using the measures of the first mahã- purusa. This creates an important link between the two texts, because a fundamental correspondence appears between the human figure as described in the Citralaksaņa (the cakravartin) and the one found in the Citrasütra (the hamsa who corresponds to the cakravartin).</page><page sequence="4">152 THE TIBET JOURNAL Head Both texts give the height of the head as 12 angula and its girth as 32. Moreover the face is divided into three parts: 1) Forehead (Skt. lalāņa ): 4 angula high; the Citrasūtra lays down also its width in 8 angula. 2)Nose (Skt. nãsã ): 4 angula high. Moreover the other measures are speci- fied: according to the Citrasūtra (ch.36, 10-11): "The nose is 4 angula , 2 angula deep and 3 angula wide. The nostrils are 1 a águia broad and 2 angula wide" in the Citralaksaņa , instead, the tip of the nose is 2 angula high and "more" than 2 angula wide. The nostrils are 6 grains of barley wide and 2 high. Basically we find real differences only in the measurements of the nostrils, while as regards the nose in general the two texts state nearly the same. 3) Chin (Skt. hanu): 4 angula high. In this case both the texts show a particular analogy: first, by dividing the face into three parts, they state that the chin should be 4 angula high; then after describing the mouth, they come back to its measure and they say it should be 2 angula. In the first case the texts con- sider the part of the face which is between the basis of the nose and the end of the jaw, while in the second case they take into consideration the chin in itself. In this connection the author of the Citrasūtra uses two different words: first hanu 16 namely the jaw; and then cibuka , that is the chin. Then the two texts conclude the description of the face analysing the ears, eyes and mouth. Both of them state that the ears should be 2 angula wide and 4 angula high; the opening of the auricle must be half an angula wide and 1 angula high.17 Finally there is no definition for the measure of ear lobe. The section related to the eyes is very detailed as not only does it give the measures of each part, but also describes the different types of expression. The Citrasūtra gives reasons for that in chapter 38, maintaining that a fundamental element for a painting to be auspicious is the way the figure glances: it should look neither upwards nor downwards; and the look should be neither too strong nor too weak, neither too angry nor too fierce. Each look, which is not correct, is matched with a definite misfortune: for example, if the eyes look downwards, they will bring sorrow and pain, if they look sideways, they will destroy riches, if they look sad, they will bring death. As regards the measures, the Citrasūtra , chapter 36, 19-22 reads: "The eyes are 1 angula high and 3 angula wide. The black round18 is the third part of the eye. The pupils are the fifth part. The eyebrows are half an angula thick and 3 angula long". In the Citralaksaņa slightly different measures are laid down: the eye is 20 angula wide and 1 angula high; the eyebrows are 4 angula long and lÁ angula thick. The pupils19 are 1/3 of the eye. Consequently we have the following chart: Eyebrows Citrasūtra : 3 angula long Citralaksaņa : 4 angula long Va angula thick !/2 angula thick Eyes Citrasūtra : 3 angula long Citralaksaņa : 2 angula long 1 angula wide 1 angula wide</page><page sequence="5">PROBLEMS OF ICONOMETRY. . . 153 Iris Citrasütra : the third part Citralaksaņa: the third part of the eye of the eye Pupil Citrasütra : the fifth part Citralaksaņa : - of the eye Then the author of the Citralaksaņa examines five peculiar types of eyes, which are almost the same, both in shapes and measures, like the ones mentioned in the Citrasütra (ch.37): Cāpākāra (bow-shaped): both texts state the measure is 3 y ava. Matsyodara (like a fish belly): Citrasütra : 4 y ava, Citralaksaņa : 8 yava. Utpalapatrabha (like an utpala petal)20: both texts fix a size of 6 yava. Padmapatranibha (like a lotus petal): both texts state a size of 9 yava. Sankhãkrti (as round as a shell): both texts state a size of 10 yava. Every type corresponds to a peculiar attitude, so that the first one is typical of the yoga meditation, the second suits the look of women and lovers, the third that of common people, the fourth suits scared or crying people and, finally, the last one suits people who are angry or plagued with suffering. There is a surprising analogy between this part of the Citrasütra , chapter 37, and the Citralaksaņa , chapter 3, 619-656: [...] In the case of Yogis, their eyes, bespeaking of equanimity, should be made to re- semble a bow made of bamboo. In the case of women and lovers should be made eyes that resemble a belly of a fish. In the case of ordinary persons, eyes that resemble an utpala should be adopted. It is laid down that to express fright and crying, eyes resembling the petal of padma lotus should be used. The eyes of those troubled by anger and grief should be painted resembling a cowrie shell [...]. 21 Finally, only the examination of the mouth remains, by which the description of the face is concluded. The Citralaksaņa , chapter 3, 665-674, reads: The upper lip has the thickness of one digit, and it is laid down that the lower lip has the thickness of half a digit. One should know that the length of the upper lip and the lower lip measures 4 digits. The part lying above the upper lip has an expanse of half of digit t...]22 The Citrasütra , chapter 36, 12-14: 'The space between the nose and the lips is Vi angula. The upper lip is 1 angula. The mouth is 4 angula wide. The lower lip is 1 angula ." Therefore also in this case the measures are the same, but for the thickness of the lower lip, which in the Citralaksaņa is smaller (Vi angula instead of 1 angula). Trunk In the examination of this section of the figure we find greater differences between the two texts. Furthermore the indications that we are given do not suffice at all to repre- sent the bust of the cakravartin or hamsa in full, and they often tend to get lost in details rather than describe the proportions of each part (chest, abdomen, belly, etc.). First of all the Citralaksaņa does not deal with the classical division of the trunk into three parts, although that division will become a typical element of the various</page><page sequence="6">154 THE TIBET JOURNAL Tibetan iconometric systems, as we find it, for instance, in the practice of the great 1 5th century artist, sMan thang pa sMan bla don grub, who divides the figures to be represented into six principal classes23 and lays down the proportions for each of them: 1) chest; 2) stomach; 3) lower abdomen. That division is found, instead, in the Citrasūtra , which describes it in chapter 35, 13, as it follows: "(the hamsa) from the penis up to the navel there is 1 tāla and the same from the navel to the heart and from the heart to the throat." However, dealing again with the bodily measures in the following chapter, also the Citrasūtra is rather indefinite and, in some passages, obscure. In chapter 36, 25-27, it reads: "The nape is 10 angula high and has a 21 {angula) long girth. The distance between the nipples is 16 angula. The space between the chest and the clavicle is 10 angula". Then, in the same chapter, lines 37-42, it states: "The abdomen measurement is 42 angula. The navel is 1 angula in the medical knowledge. The hip is 42 angula wide. The penis, as regards its size, is 6 angula ". The Citralaksaņa , chapter 3, 705-734, gives a survey which can hardly be com- pared with the previous passages: for instance it also lays down the size of the penis in 6 angula , dwells upon the navel, which should be a spiral of Vi angula , and on the nipples, which are 1 yava. Moreover, in a subsequent passage (ch.3, 895-926), it comes back to the topic, without however being clearer. We can conclude that neither text develops the description of the trunk accurately and coherently, and leaves several doubts to the artist, in case he would like to make a figure, following the given indications, which confirms that scholarly tradition does not always correspond with the artist's practices.24 Legs and Feet Both texts deal with this subject very accurately, by giving the sizes of the individual toes and of their nails. The Citrasūtra , chapter 35, 12-13, gives us the following general indications: "The height of the foot up to the end of the ankle should be Va tāla. The legs from the ankle to the knee are 2 tāla and the knees are the same as the foot. The thighs are the same as the shin-bone". Therefore we find again the same division of the leg which will appear in the Tibetan iconometric systems, where thigh and shinbone on one side and knee and foot/ankle on the other, have the same sizes.25 The Citralaksaņa , is less systematic and gives the sizes of the different parts without mentioning the shin-bones. In chapter 3, 735-784, we find: "From here we come to the thighs and, with regard to their measurement in length, they should be 25 digits. The knees are 4 digits (long), the sides of the ankles 4 digits [...]".26 We may surmise that, in this case as well, the size of the shin-bone is the same as the thigh and that, therefore, the author did not mention it. Should this be true, we would find the above mentioned division in the Citralaksaņa too. Finally, if we take for granted this hypothesis, we can state a comparison as follows: Thigh Citrasūtra: 24 angula Citralaksaņa : 25 angula Knee Citrasūtra : 3 angula Citralaksaņa : 4 angula</page><page sequence="7">PROBLEMS OF ICONOMETRY. . . 155 Leg-bone Citrasūtra : 24 angula Citralaksaņa : 25 angula Foot/ankle Citrasūtra : 3 angula Citralaksaņa : 4 angula Therefore in the analysis of the width and girth of the different parts, the Citralak- saņa is much more accurate and rich in details, while the Citrasūtra only gives few indications. There are no real elements for comparison, as the measurements that are given are often related to different divisions of the leg, however the total measure of the length from thigh to ankle is identical in both texts. Furthermore the Citralaksaņa , chapter 3, 735-784, dwells upon the ways of representation: [. . .]The front portion of the thighs is raised and both of them should be swelled because of the muscles inside, tender and devoid of unevenness, like the trunk of an elephant. The ankles and the knees should got be visible, even as the veins are not. The calves should be rounded[...]27 As for the heels and feet, they show different sizes in the two texts: Heel Citrasūtra: 3 angula wide and 4 angula high Citralaksaņa: 3 angula wide and 5 angula high. Foot Citrasūtra: 12 angula long and 6 angula wide. Citralaksaņa: 8 angula long and 5 angula wide. As regards the toes, following the Citrasūtra , the big toe is 3 angula , the next toe is as long as the big toe and the other toes are 1/8 shorter than those. Instead the Citralaksaņa tells us that the big toe is 4 angula long and 2 angula wide, the next toe is slightly longer than the thumb, and the other toes decrease in order down to the small toe, which is 1/6 of an angula. Moreover, after affording these strictly iconometric indications, the text dwells on the typical signs of the cakravartin , some of which are identical to Buddha's laksaņas. The feet should be decorated with wheels and have webbed toes, and the instep should be shaped like a tortoise shell. Besides, the nails should be shining and red, smooth and like a crescent moon. Also the Citrasūtra dwells upon some of these elements and in chapter 40 it lists the haws a' s characteristics, among which there are webbed toes and marked soles. We can see rather clearly a slow process of evolution and change of Indian iconography, which is reflected in its developments in Tibet, showing that we cannot speak of a definite canon of representation in Buddhist art. Hands and arms With the description of these two last bodily parts, the survey of the hawsa and cakra- vartin figures respectively is concluded. In this last section new analogies appear so that, in some passages, the Citralaksaņa seems to follow faithfully - word by word - the Citrasūtra. Citralaksaņa , chapter 3, 81 1-838: Hear now the characteristic attributes of the hand of the Master of Men. The palms should be made 7 digits (long) and 5 digits in breadth. The middle finger should be made to measure 5 digits. The forefinger reaches up to half the nail (of the middle finger) and the</page><page sequence="8">156 THE TIBET JOURNAL fourth fìnger has also the same measurement. The little finger should be made the smallest of all [,..]28 Citrasütra, chäpter 36, 30-34: The palm is 6 angula , 5 angula wide. The middle finger has a measure of 5 aňgula. The forefinger is half the size of a part of this less.29 The fourth finger has the same proportions. The little finger is the smallest among them. According to both texts, the thumb should be divided into two parts, even if it has different measures: 4 angula in the former, 3 angula in the latter. The Citralaksam goes on describing the hands by dwelling upon some details, which are not considered by the Citrasütra : "As regards the ball of the thumb, it is to be 3 digits. The measure of the lower part of the inner side of the thumb should be 9 barley grains, and of course, 8 barley grains in breadth and 9 barley grains in length."30 Besides, some characteristic attributes appear that, as we noticed in the description of the feet are identical to the Buddha's lakçanas: the fingers should be webbed and the nails are to be as red and shining as mother-of-pearl. The insistence on webbed fingers -jãlãnguli in Sanskrit - is a confirmation, also in this case, of the link with the Citrasütra and with artistic practice. Finally, on coming to the arms, the Citralaksam is extremely accurate: their measure is 36 angula and they are divided into two parts (from the shoulder to the elbow and from the elbow to the wrist) of identical length. As regards breadth of the arm, the upper part is 6 angula , the lower part 4. If the arms include also the hands, they are 48 angula 31 and they reach down to the knees.32 On the contrary there is some difficulty in the corresponding Citrasütra passage, related to this topic. In fact, in chapter 35, 15-16, it says: "[...] the two rājanbāhū are 17 angula . The two prabāhū are the same measure Now, the two Sanskrit words show as a second element the word bãhu, which means both arm and forearm In my opinion, as a comparison with the Tibetan text may suggest, they mean both parts of the arm, that is the upper one (from the shoulder to the elbow), and the lower one (from the elbow to the wrist), which have the same measure. They are different, instead, in their girth, as it is pointed out in chapter 36, 2 1 : "The arm (bãhu) girth is 16 angula at one end (we can suppose near the shoulder) and 12 at the other end (that is at the wrist)". If this interpretation sounds correct, we can summarize the information drawn from both texts as follows: From shoulder to elbow Citralakçana : lays down a length of 18 angula and a breadth of 5. Citrasütra : lays down a length of 17 angula and a girth of 18. From elbow to wrist Citralaksam : lays down a length of 1 8 angula and a breadth of 4. Citrasütra : lays down a length of 17 angula and a girth of 12.33 We have thus finished with the examination of the last parts of the figure. However, in order to complete the comparison between the two texts, we must notice a further similarity in the description of the characteristic features of the hamsa and of the</page><page sequence="9">PROBLEMS OF ICONOMETRY. ..157 cakravartin. The Citrasütra lists the typical features of the hamsa , including the ūrņā (a tuft of hair on the forehead, between the eyebrows) and the u$ņī$a (a sort of protrusion of the skull); these are present also in the Citralaksaņa , which lays down the following measures: XA angula for the former, and 4 angula in height and 6 in width for the latter. These two distinctive elements characterize the image of the Buddha since its first anthropomorphic representations. We have already seen how the Citrasütra and the Citralaksaņa describe other features which are typical both of the cakravartin and of the Buddha: webbed fingers and toes, feet decorated with the dharma wheel, particular features of the instep, toes, fingers and nails. It seems, therefore, that some iconographie and iconometric elements which developed during the early period of Buddhist art are found in these two texts, in spite of the fact they are both clearly of Hindu origin. In fact, if we substituted the name of the Buddha for that of the cakravartin in the Citralaksaņa, we would have a perfect Buddhist text. This should not sound surprising at all, since the earliest extant examples of Indian art are indeed Buddhist. These two texts may well represent the earliest systematic attempts in India to codify the visual representation of human and divine images known to us. In fact the Citrasütra is found inside the Vi $ņudharmottara-purāņa , the puräna being encyclopaedic texts making up the main source of the Hindu belief system, including anatomy and aesthetics. It is not surprising that the effort to codify all knowledge was extended to citra , too. This attempt is even clearer in the Citralaksaņa , where we read (ch.l, 10-29); "I am going to write a fìlli survey of the theory of Visvakarma, Prahlāda and Nagnajit;"34 probably the author tried to codify the various traditions of his time in a single iconometric system and therefore looked up in texts dealing with the subject. The Citrasütra may have been among them, for it provides precious informations on the subject, although it is less complete than the Citralaksaņa. With the inclusion of the Tibetan translation of the Citralaksaņa in the bsTan ' gyur , the Tibetan tradition seems to have inherited Hindu as well as Buddhist iconometric elements from Indian aesthetics (cf. Table. 1). It is somehow paradoxical that the Indian iconometric tradition - at least at a scholarly level - should have been preserved in Tibet through a text of Hindu origin. It should be pointed out, however, that the Hindu component in the Citralaksaņa was ultimately indebted to the Buddhist artistic production that predominated in India during the early period. Notes 1 . D. Jackson, History of Tibetan Painting, Wien, 1996. The several painting schools which developed in Tibet during the centuries often went back to different iconometric canons established on the basis of different interpretations of the canonical texts and oral traditions, and by comparing images previously produced. 2. The three others are the Ätreya's Pratimãmânalakçana , also known as Ãtreyatilaka, the Dasātālanyagrodhaparimaņ()ala-buddhapratimālak$aņa, considered a revelation by Buddha himself, and the Sambuddha-bhā$ta-pratimālak§aņa-vivaraņa , a commentary to this work attributed to Ãtreya by Bu ston.

But for the angula , these measures are actually never used by Tibetan artists; instead the terms most frequently used to indicate the iconometric measures can be outlined as follows: 4 nas (skr. yava) = 1 rkang 4 rkang = 1 sor (or sor mo, Skt. angula) or 1 cha phran (small measure) 4 sor mo = 1 chag (a fist's width) 1 2 sor mo = 1 thai mo (or mthil, Skt. tāla , palm) or 1 mtho (or mtho zhal, span) or 1 zhal (or zhal tshad) or 1 g dong (size of the face) or 1 cha chengrezt measure) 24 sor mo = 1 khru (Skt. hasta , cubit) 14.

For example, about the first man, the text states: "The hamsa should have eyes as sweet as honey, should be as</page><page sequence="11">PROBLEMS OF ICONOMETRY. . . 159 fair as the Moon, as strong as an elephant's trunk, with a bearing of a swan, a fine breast and a handsome face". 15. Five different figures are introduced also at the end of the Citralakçana. Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original Sanskrit words from Tibetan, to be able to compare them with the names of the five men of the Citrasütra , but the results have not been unusual. 16. In the Rãmãyana , the head of the apes, who enters into an alliance with Rāma is called Hanumat: "wide-jawed". 1 7. Actually, the Citrasütra is not so accurate, but as regards the auricle, it says in chapter 36, 7-8: "[...] The centre of the ear is 1 angula. And the lobe measurement, from the basis of this cavity, is not laid down". 1 8. In the Sanskrit text we find "kr$m mandala which literally means "black circle". It probably means the eye iris, which in the Indian people is almost always dark. 19. The text may refer to the iris and the pupil as a whole, as also shown in the comparison with the Citrasütra . 20. Traditionally Uptala is defined as "the blossom of the blue lotus (Nymphaea Caerulea) " (M. Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford, 1 899, p. 1 80). However, laboratory analysis has revealed that Uptala actually indicates the Meconopsis discigera (G. Doije &amp; F. Meyer, Tibetan Medical Paintings , London, 1992, p.334). 21 . Laufer (ed.), op.cit., p. 84. 22. Laufer (ed.), op.cit., p.85. 23. D. P. &amp; J. A. Jackson, Tibetan Thangka Painting , Methods and Materials , London, 1994, pp.50-53. According to sMan bla don grub, the six classes are five for gods and one for men: 1 . Buddhas; 2. peaceful Bodhisattva, such as MañjusiT and Avalokitešvara; 3. goddesses (for example Tärä, Prajfiāpāramitā); 4. tall wrathful figures, such as the Bodhisattva Vajrapāņi; 5. short wrathful figures; 6. humans, including some Šrāvakā? (the early human disciples of the Buddha Säkyamuni) and Pratyekabuddhäh. 24. See Lo Bue, op.cit, 1990, pp. 188- 197. 25. See sMan thang pa sMan bla don grub s measurements as reported in Jackson, op. cit., 1994, p.51. Actually in the measures of the first class of images, that is Buddha's, the knee and the ankle/knee are different: the first element is 4 angula and the second is 4 Vi angula. The other five, instead are exactly the same. 26. Laufer (ed.), op.cit, p. 88. The height of the foot up to the ankle is given again in chapter 3, 735-784, and it is always in the measure of 4 angula. 27. Laufer (ed.), op.cit, p.88. 28. Laufer (ed.), op.cit, p.91. 29. 1 believe this to mean that, taking into account the three parts making up the middle finger, the forefinger measures two parts plus half a part, as it is shorter than the former. 30. Laufer (ed.), op.cit., p.91. 31 . Actually, by adding the 12 angula, which represent the measure of the hand to the 36 angula of the arm we get 42. The CitralakĢaņa actually does not give the total length of the hand, which, however, can be easily calculated by adding the palm measure to the one of the index finger, that is 7 + 5 = 12. The Citrasütra , instead, chapter 35, 16, tells us that the hand is 1 tāla , that is 1 2 angula. 32. This characteristic corresponds to another lakçana of the Buddha. 33. We may try to state a ratio between the measures of the girth of both parts of the arm given by the Citrasütra and the measures of width given by the CitralakĢaņa : 18:12 = 5:4; in order to get a correct ratio, we should change 12 into 12.8. 34.
