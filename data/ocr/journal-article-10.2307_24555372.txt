<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATTHEW MARKS GALLERY, 1018 Mad ison Avenue, New York, New York 10021. Just bigger than pocket-size, Julian Schna bel: Works on Paper 1976-1992 is an agreeable, floppy catalogue accompanying the recent exhibition at Matthew Marks. Vast shifts in scale are reasonably addressed by reducing everything to much smaller-than-life nota tions, from the earliest—and tiniest—draw ings, some slightly larger than 8x5 in., to more recent "anthropomorphic size" works on paper topping 8x5 ft. An intimate inter view by Francesco Clemente, more like a series of conversational leading questions, fills the volume, starting with a provocative challenge to spit out the names of "five paint ers who can draw and five who can't." As they ruminate on drawing, the conversation hones in on Schnabel. There's talk of travel ing and shadows and the "bigger picture" near the end, concepts not easily describable in words. A 1985 Clemente poem on Schna bel, binding together images of place and time, is a poignant last word. 60 pp. 38 illus trations. Price: $12 postpaid.</page></plain_text>
