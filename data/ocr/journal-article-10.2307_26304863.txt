<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARALD HÖFFDING The Conscious and the Unconscious From Outlines of Psychology (1881) In the preceding account of mental life, stress has been laid on two chief distinguishing traits—on the occurrence of a change, through which new elements of consciousness emerge, and on the connection between all elements of consciousness. If this account is correct, then consciousness may cease from two causes: either because the individual elements do not possess strength enough to make themselves felt, or because the connection between them ceases. So long as we adhere strictly to the principle that the mind is known only through the manifestations of consciousness, the province of mental life is not widely extended. Nerve processes are not all of the kind which we have reason to think accompanied by consciousness, and even those with which this is the case may be carried on without consciousness, if their intensity is not sufficiently great. Thus a physical stimulus may take effect on the nervous system without a sensation arising; the sensation arises only when the stimulus has reached a certain strength. The nerve process, on the other hand, must begin at lower degrees of stimulation, and has thus already reached a certain strength when the sensation crosses the threshold of consciousness. Let x, for example, denote the degree of strength of a nerve process, which is just strong enough for a scarcely perceptible sensation, which we will call y, to correspond to it. We then have a peculiar relation: while the degrees of strength on the physical side continuously decrease from x downwards, the psychical side remains empty, stops suddenly at y. This is how the relation presents itself, whatever fundamental conception as to the relation between the mental and material we start from. It is the same with combination as with degree of strength; for there is only a difference of degree between the American Imago, Vol. 61, No. 3, 379-395. © 2004 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 379</page><page sequence="2">380 The Conscious and the Unconscious structure and mode of action of the lower and the structure and mode of action of the higher cells. Now is it probable that at a certain stage of the scale a something should arise which did not exist at all at the lower stages? If the series in the one sphere is continuous, must it not be supposed to be so in the other? We have no right to assume that there are chinks or gaps anywhere in nature; at any rate the advances of knowl edge principally consist in the filling up and connecting of interstices and clefts. The question before us is, whether the unconscious can be other than a purely negative conception. In daily speech (and, more than is proper, even in the scientific use of language) we use such expressions as unconscious sensations, unconscious ideas, unconscious feelings. As, however, sensa tions, ideas, and feelings are elements of consciousness, the expression is in reality absurd. If by an unconscious idea is meant an idea which I have, then the predicate "unconscious" signifies only that I do not think of or pay heed to the fact that I have it. This use of the word unconsciousness is connected with a twofold use of the word consciousness. It is used to denote not only the inner presentation of our sensations, ideas, and feelings, but also self-consciousness, the attention expressly directed to our sensations, ideas, and feelings. We have, of course, many sensations and ideas without being conscious that we have them; many feelings and impulses stir within us, without our clearly apprehending their nature and direction. In this sense we can speak, for example, of uncon scious love; a man who has this feeling does not know what is astir in him; perhaps others see it, or he himself gradually discovers it; but he has the feeling, his conscious life is determined in a particular way. In desiring to examine here, however, the relation be tween the conscious and the unconscious, we understand by unconsciousness a state which lies below the threshold of our consciousness in general (not merely of our self-conscious ness). We wish to examine whether it may not be shown that the unconscious is related to the conscious, and the difference on the psychical as well as on the physical side consequently one of degree only. But for the present we take it as a purely negative conception. It is not the intention to follow Edward v.</page><page sequence="3">Harald Höffding 381 Hartmann in the mystical paths which he believes he has opened up in his Philosophy of the Unconscious. Hartmann not only without more ado makes the unconscious into a positive conception, but also uses it as an explanatory principle wher ever he thinks that the physical and the psychological causal series fail. Psychology is on secure ground only when it confines itself to the clear and certain phenomena and laws of consciousness. But starting from this standpoint, it discovers the unconscious, and sees to its astonishment that psychologi cal laws prevail beyond the province of conscious life. In what follows we shall adduce some examples to make this clear.1 Reference has repeatedly been made to memory as the typical phenomenon of consciousness. But memory presup poses change in the elements of consciousness. Now what becomes of the ideas that have disappeared, in the interval before their recall? In daily conversation the memory appears as a storehouse or treasure-chamber, where ideas are saved up for future use. It is only figuratively that actual existence can be in this way attributed to the ideas which have disappeared from consciousness. But the remarkable fact is that it seems as if, nevertheless, they played a part in the actual activity of consciousness. If we want to recall something that is in our memory, and cannot come upon it, it is a well-known resource to leave off the search for it, and to think of quite different things; then the idea wanted may suddenly emerge. Here we give up the conscious search, and allow instead an absolutely unconscious process to begin. The case is similar when we have collected materials for some work, as e.g. the treatment of a scientific question. We are then often so overwhelmed by details as to be unable to arrange and combine the matter. Here again occupation with quite different matters may be a good resource. In the midst of the new activity, the proper mode of treating the question may suddenly, as of its own accord, present itself to consciousness. Unconscious action has effected what conscious, direct, and strenuous work might never perhaps have succeeded in. Of course such results are never obtained in sleep; strenuous work is presupposed, the unconscious operation crowns the labor. Some psychologists explain phenomena of this kind quite simply, by the greater freshness of the brain and mind, when a</page><page sequence="4">382 The Conscious and the Unconscious thing has been "slept upon." But this explanation can apply only to cases in which the question is directly taken up again after the break, not to those in which the abandoned subject suddenly, in the midst of occupation with other matters, presents itself to thought in a perfectly clear light. Here the subject has in the interval undergone further treatment, but this treatment has taken place below the threshold of con sciousness; it has been carried on in us, not by us. And yet this unconscious working bears the impress of the same principles and laws that control conscious working. What is true in this way of many of our thoughts, is true also—as has been proved by the physiology of the senses—of our apparently simple and immediate sensations and percepts. We make for ourselves a continuous visual image, although in the retina there is a point (the blind spot) which receives no excitation. Many of our sensations of color which we regard as immediate, are determined by the effect of contrast with other colors. The conception of space, which discloses itself to us at one stroke, has arisen by the combination of diverse impressions. Our two eyes have not the same range of vision, and yet we imagine that with both eyes we survey the binocular range of vision immediately. We judge the direction of the line of sight (according to Helmholtz) by the effort of will with which we try to alter the position of the eyes. But of all these combinations we are not conscious, and when it is said that our sensuous percepts are results of "unconscious inferences," it must be carefully noted that this expression is permissible only because we have no means of denoting these processes, known to us only by their results, except by expressions derived by analogy from the higher conscious life.2 We employ here a sort of inverted anthropomorphism. Not only may conscious results come from unconscious working up, but there may also be unconscious intermediate links in the midst of conscious work. Supposing the idea a to be linked with the idea b, and b again with c, then a will finally produce c directly, without the intervention of b. A proposi tion, which we have learned to understand by way of proof, remains in our consciousness after we have forgotten the proof. All education rests on the possibility of the intermediate links thus sinking below "the threshold." The authority of the</page><page sequence="5">Harald Höffding 383 educator is at first indispensable, but gradually falls into the background. The intermediate links are often so numerous that they cannot be recovered at all, or only with great difficulty. Many psychological paradoxes and sudden sugges tions have their explanation in this unconscious determining of conscious ideas. Everything that we call instinct, tact, self-acquired or innate disposition operates in this way. Habits and tendencies which we have acquired or yielded to, or which are be queathed to us from earlier generations, endure long after the causes of them have passed away. The ideas, feelings, and actions to which these tendencies lead do not receive a complete explanation in the conscious life itself. There are always intermediate links which are passed over, and can be discovered only by physiological and sociological research. The conscious motives have passed away, but their effects remain. Instinct therefore has been defined as an acting for ends of which we are not conscious. Conscious effort is partially determined by unconscious motives, and leaves be hind it unconscious effects. In the individual as in nations, sudden revolutions avail but little; below the surface tenden cies persist, which it takes time to overcome. Thus it was necessary for the Israelites to wander forty years in the wilder ness. Herodotus relates (IV.3-4) how the slaves of the Scythians, while their masters were away on distant expeditions, had married their women and secured supremacy. When the masters returned, they could not by force of arms subdue the young generation that had sprung from these marriages, but obtained their submission so soon as they cracked the whips which ordinarily served for the punishment of slaves. This narrative may serve at any rate as a poetical representation of the force of inherited habit. In the lives of eminent and leading men, we often see how they have to struggle to overcome what the impressions of youth and habit have implanted. Every mental revolution disturbs at first only that which stirs in clear consciousness; the unconscious undercurrents may long pursue their course, without being reached by the movement of the surface.3 The reaction after a revolution often discloses how little real hold the movement has ob</page><page sequence="6">384 The Conscious and the Unconscious tained. What has been consciously attained has not taken real root until it operates unconsciously or, as we say, has become part of the flesh and blood. Conscious work acts as pioneer; but it is also important that the unconscious machinery should be set in motion. Conversely, we may practice something quite mechanically, which afterwards gradually gains control over consciousness. Forced conversion may lead to zealous faith, if not in the same generation, yet in later generations. Compul sion works against that of which there is clear consciousness; so that compulsory conversion succeeds only where no such consciousness is as yet developed. But mechanical exercise may gradually weaken consciousness. We are, according to Pascal's expression, automata as well as spirits, wherefore Pascal counsels us to begin with taking holy water and observ ing ceremonies; the rest will come of itself. This is his notori ous principle: Il faut s'abêtir [We must make half-wits of ourselves.] An unconscious activity may be carried on simultaneously with a conscious. The spinner turns the wheel and draws out the thread, while all her thoughts are far away. A reader may be wholly absorbed in the contents of the book or even in other thoughts, while he sees the letters and pronounces the words corresponding to them. In these instances the subordinate action at any rate approximates to the unconscious, and there can be litde question that the boundary-line may be crossed. And yet that which has thus taken place unconsciously may afterwards assert itself in consciousness. Fechner relates {Ele ments of Psychophysics, Vol. ii, p. 432), that one morning in bed he was surprised by having a white image of the stove-pipe when he closed his eyes. As he lay with his eyes open and speculated, he had seen before him, without being conscious of it, a black stove-pipe with a white wall as background, and what now made its appearance was the negative after-image of this.4 The physical excitation had thus been of such a nature that the visual sensation might have arisen; but the attention being otherwise engaged, what appeared to consciousness was not the sensation itself, but only the more impressive after image. In like manner, when we listen in a state of abstraction to some one speaking to us, we may not until long afterwards become conscious of what he has said. It is only by the express</page><page sequence="7">Harald Höffding 385 direction of attention that the impressions unconsciously received are here raised above "the threshold." That we are able to remember something is therefore no decisive proof that we consciously apprehended it at the time of its occur rence. By connection with that which has been consciously apprehended, even an unconscious impression may be called to memory.5 Unconscious impressions play an especially large part in the development of the feelings. Feeling is determined not only by clear and distinct sensations and ideas, but also by imperceptible influences, the sum of which only takes effect in consciousness. Hence the mystical and inexplicable character of so many feelings; especially when first excited are they incomprehensible even to the individual himself, since he does not know their definite causes. The vital feeling results from the effect of the organic functions on the brain; but the single impressions do not here stand out clearly, but combine to produce an obscure and changing background of well-being or discomfort. The feeling of love has, especially in its first dawning, a mystical character due to the arousing of uncomprehended organic instincts, and to the influence of these on the vital feeling and on the imagination. There is something of the sort even in other feelings, since we are never fully conscious of the influence of our experiences and the conditions of life on our state of feeling, until the feeling acquires a distinctly marked character or even perhaps breaks forth in actions. Such influences are like the air we breathe without thinking of it. They occasion within us a quiet growth which is often the most important and decisive factor in the mental life. This points us back to the general condition of conscious life and of nerve-process, that only a more or less sudden change arouses either to activity. A slowly increasing application of heat or of electricity may cause the death of a frog, without its ever stirring from the spot. In the history of individuals and of the race, inner connection is preserved by means of this unconscious growth, which determines a great part of the content and of the energy of conscious life. It is only when attention is confined to the distinctly marked states of consciousness, that there appear to be sharp lines of demarcation and sudden revolutions; far</page><page sequence="8">386 The Conscious and the Unconscious below, infinitely ramified connections are discovered. So the coral-zoophytes build always below the surface of the sea, and what they build is not discovered until it rises above the sea-level. Leibniz was the first to call attention to the significance of the infinitesimal elements in psychology (as also in mathemat ics and physics). He brought this view into connection, more over, with the law of continuity so energetically maintained by him. By means of unconscious impressions (which he called petites perceptions) he explained the connection of the single individual with the universe, a relation which is much closer than the individual is himself clearly conscious of; and he also employs them to explain the way in which the past determines, and is continued in, the future. In the state of dream we have an intermediate stage between the purely unconscious and the conscious state. The analogy exhibited between the dream-consciousness and the waking consciousness may so far throw light on the relation between the conscious and the unconscious. Sleeping and waking are usually contrasted as strict oppo sites. But just as in the waking state there are innumerable degrees of energy, clearness, and connection of consciousness, so there are many shades of transition from waking to sleep, and conversely; and there are also different degrees of sleep. Thus the following descending stages in the scale of psychical energy have been distinguished: ( 1 ) Dreaming in a half-dozing state; (2) the light morning sleep with vivid dreams; (3) deep sleep with obscure, fluctuating dream-images; (4) the deepest sleep without dreams (?); and (5) a yet lower degree experi enced in illness, the state of lethargy or fever-sleep. The deepest sleep is that which we have immediately after falling asleep. The question whether we always have dreams receives different answers. Those who believe this to be the case appeal partly to metaphysical arguments—that the mind cannot from its nature refrain from activity; partly to physiological—that movements must go on continuously in the brain, and that impressions must be continuously received. It is at any rate clear, that dreaming is a step closer to waking life than dreamless sleep, if there be such a thing. The connection of the dream-consciousness with the waking consciousness is shown, in the first place, by the fact</page><page sequence="9">Harald Höffding 387 that the dream-consciousness is frequently occupied with that which is the object of waking interest. Difficulties and annoy ances, which were insuperable in a waking state, are overcome or thought to be overcome in dreams, while on the other hand familiar and simple situations present inconceivable and insu perable difficulties. In the next place, the elements of which the world of dreams is composed are for the most part derived from the experiences of waking life, though these are brought into new, often fantastic, combinations. During sleep, however, impressions are continuously received not only from within the organism (from the respiratory and digestive organs), but also from without (impressions of touch, sound, light, etc.). The connection with the external world is thus not entirely broken. Now, these impressions are interwoven with the after effects of waking life into a new world of images. But the formation of this new world takes place under conditions which differ from those of the waking state. There is lacking that firm concentration of attention and the universal control which waking life calls out or imposes. Individual impressions, especially the organic sensations, obtain in consequence a power which thrusts unity and continuity aside. A free and bold interpretation of each individual impression is the result. Dreams acquire what has been appropriately called a mytho logical character. If the breathing is unusually easy and free, we think we are flying; if it is difficult, we are oppressed with nightmare. If the sleeper becomes cold through losing the bedclothes, he finds himself on a journey to the north pole or promenading the streets naked. A man who had a hot-water botde at his feet dreamt he was walking on the crater of Mount Etna. Often a most complicated event is constructed to explain some quite simple impression, as when the falling of a curtain and the appearance of light in the room calls up a dream of the day of judgment depicted with a host of details. In the waking state also we explain individual impressions according to their relation to our other experiences. The dream-consciousness follows the same method, often with great ingenuity and great perseverance, and with a certain artistic capacity; but it cannot as a rule keep individual impres sions under control; each several impression sets up its special current of thought, which then takes possession of the entire</page><page sequence="10">388 The Conscious and the Unconscious consciousness, until it is dislodged by the next impression. There is not sufficient power of resistance against the indi vidual elements. Hence the shifting and disorderly nature of dreams, resembling insanity, which is also a state of disorgani zation. It is possible even that many dream-images arise with out being determined by sensuous impressions, quite auto matically; but even to this there is something corresponding in waking states, namely in hallucinations and sudden sugges tions. The dream-state shows us, then, psychological laws in operation, but below the threshold of consciousness proper. It is a station on the road from unconscious to conscious life. In the act of awaking there are sometimes circumstances which may throw light on the relation between the conscious and the unconscious. When we are awaked, it is not always the physical strength of the stimulus which determines the event, but its relation to the weal and woe of the individual, to his waking interests, what Burdach6 has called the psychical rela tion of the stimulus. An indifferent word softly spoken does not rouse from sleep; but a mother will wake at her child's slightest movement. A very avaricious man was awakened by a coin being placed in his hand. A naval officer who slept in spite of a great tumult awoke at the whispering of the word "signal." To conclude from such cases with Burdach that the mind during sleep distinguishes sensuous percepts is not admissible; on the contrary, they point to the view that an individual impression attains to consciousness only by connection with other experiences. It sets free a whole series of effects in the brain, and therewith consciousness is given. The act of awak ing, which is transition from an at least relatively unconscious to a conscious state, is brought about by the individual impres sion obtaining, by combination with other impressions, the background it requires, in order to become conscious. It accords with this that consciousness is apparently connected with very complex nerve-organs, in which many currents may meet together. This circumstance may perhaps throw some light on a psychological paradox already mentioned—that a perfectly simple and unattached sensation cannot be conscious, and on the associated difficulty of representing the beginning of</page><page sequence="11">Harald Höffding 389 consciousness. This beginning might be thought of as having for its condition that a single impression should at once call up several conscious elements. Just as it seems that what has taken place unconsciously can be remembered, so an impression might be able to arouse consciousness by simultaneously freeing both foreground and background. But this does not imply that the origin of consciousness can be thought of as a single, momentary act. Notwithstanding the intimate connection and close inter action between the conscious and the unconscious, the latter remains for us a negative conception. The unconscious pro cesses are cerebral processes just as much as the conscious, but whether, like these, they are of several kinds, we do not know. Instead of speaking of unconscious thought or unconscious feeling, it would be safer—if we wish to avoid all hypotheses— to speak with Carpenter and John Stuart Mill of unconscious cerebration, were not this expression unsuitable, as suggesting, in the first place, the mistaken notion that there may be consciousness of cerebration, properly so called, and because, in the second place, it might appear to affirm that there is nothing at all in unconscious activity related to what we know in ourselves as conscious states. Just the impossibility of draw ing a sharp line of demarcation between the conscious and the unconscious, together with the thoroughgoing analogy be tween their mode of action and their results, might perhaps justify an hypothesis upholding the law of continuity in the world of ideas, even as in the material world everything seems obedient to it. To all the different material phenomena of movement there would then correspond different degrees and forms of what in us appears as thought and feeling. As the organic world is built up of elements and by means of activities which make their appearance, though more scattered and without unity and harmony, in inorganic nature also, so in the sensations, feelings, and thoughts of conscious beings we should have higher forms of development of a something that, in a lower degree and in a lower form, exists in the lower stages of nature. We should escape from the paradox that conscious life begins without any previous preparation. Leibniz drew this very conclusion from the law of continuity: Rien ne saurait naître tout d'un coup, la pensée non plus que le mouvement [Nothing is</page><page sequence="12">390 The Conscious and the Unconscious able to be born suddenly, thought no more than movement]. He instituted an analogy between the relation of living force to tension and the relation of the conscious to the unconscious. As tension (potential energy) is living force in equilibrium, so might unconsciousness be consciousness at rest or neutralized. This would agree very well with the fact that change or destruction of equilibrium is so essential a condition of con sciousness. As in the external world there is no such thing as absolute rest, so—it might then be said—there is no absolute unconsciousness. Unconsciousness would then not be a nega tion of consciousness, but would be a lower degree of it, the continuation backwards of the series of degrees of conscious ness.7 Empirically, conscious life appears as united to certain forms or functions of the nervous system. But the nervous system has itself arisen by differentiation out of uniform protoplasm; the properties of the nervous system must like wise, therefore, be higher grades of something already corre lated with general organic matter. There is nothing here to justify the introduction, at a certain given stage of material development, of wholly new points of view. The nervous system is, so to speak, only the highest flower of material existence; it is distinguished above other forms only by its higher degree of development. For this reason modern physiologists (e.g., Claude Bernard) trace sensibility back to the irritability (the power of receiving and responding to excitations) of organic matter. Conscious reaction would thus be only a higher form of unconscious reaction. Bernard finds evidence for this in the effect of stupefying drugs (anaesthetics). The power of such drugs (opium, chloroform, etc.) to suspend consciousness is due to the fact that they take effect first of all on that part of the organism which is most susceptible to excitations, and this is the nervous system, the most highly differentiated organic matter. But by the use of stronger doses, or by continuation of the effect, the remaining vital activity is also gradually affected. Now that which is influenced by one and the same thing in the same manner, only in different degrees, can be different only in degree. In this way we ascend gradually from the lowest manifestations of life to that highest vital activity, with which consciousness is linked.8 The difference between human con</page><page sequence="13">Harald Höffding 391 sciousness and the psychical element associated with the group of atoms must be supposed to be as great as is the distance between the functions of the human brain and the movements of the inorganic group, though it may be one of degree only. Here, therefore, we are brought to recognize a continuation downwards of the scale previously given. A difference of degree, however, does not exclude the possibility of the emergence of absolutely new forms and properties, to which we have no parallel in the lower stages; a body acquires, e.g., other properties when its temperature is changed, and a compound substance may possess properties which belong to none of its constituents. We cannot, therefore, form any idea of the character of those forms of mental life which lie lower than what is to us the threshold of consciousness. There still remains an important consideration. In what precedes, stress has been laid on the principle of the persis tence of physical energy, a principle which expresses a grand coherence in the material world, but prevents the acceptance of a causal relation between matter and consciousness. But the principle of the persistence of energy is only the special, precise form which the general causal principle takes in the physical province. In this province the causal principle is satisfied if physical causes have physical effects. But now consciousness makes its appearance as a plus which is added at certain points to these physical effects, as a something over and above, that cannot be explained by physical causes. Dubois Reymond, in his treatise On the Limits to the Knowledge of Nature (1872), concludes from this that mental phenomena stand outside the law of causality and indicate a breach with the principle of sufficient reason. After all we have said, he must be allowed to be right, so long as we keep to a purely deductive standpoint and derive the premisses of the deduction from the principles of physical mechanics. But we have no right to regard these principles as the only ones. They are, as already pointed out, the presuppositions on which it has been possible to erect the proud structure of the natural sciences; but it does not follow that they exhaust the nature of being. The same being, which, looked at from one side, may be apprehended and explained from points of view contained in the law of persistence and in the law of energy may well have other sides,</page><page sequence="14">392 The Conscious and the Unconscious not to be explained from these points of view but involving new principles, though these cannot of course contradict the others. Now we have shown in the first chapter that the principle that psychology is independent of natural science (in the narrower sense) is indicated by the fact that psychology is not merely based on the consequences of physics and physiol ogy, but draws also from a totally different source of knowl edge, namely, from inner subjective perception. If, then, experience is not exhausted in physical experience, we under stand the necessity—after drawing the final consequences of the fundamental laws of physical experience, and finding that they do not lead to consciousness—of instituting a new induc tive investigation, of apprehending a new empirical starting point. Here two tasks present themselves, the one the discovery of a conformity to law in the psychological world of experi ence, the other the discovery of the relation in which the psychological experiences must stand to the physical. With the first we shall occupy ourselves in the subsequent chapters; the second we have treated in the preceding chapter. There it was seen to be difficult, if not impossible, to interpolate conscious life in interstices or gaps of external nature, and we were led to conceive of it as another form of manifestation of the same being that operates in the material world. Herewith Dubois Reymond's paradox falls to the ground. For there is now a possibility of supposing a connection as thoroughgoing in the one province as in the other. That consciousness seems to us to arise out of nothing is in that case only an illusion, precisely as it is a delusion to suppose that in external nature anything arises out of nothing. The apparent emergence of conscious ness is then only a transition from one ideal form into another, just as every new material movement is produced by conver sion from another form of movement. Such an hypothesis must be taken at its proper value. The unconscious is a conception that marks a limit in science, and when we stand at such a limit, it may have its importance to try and measure, by way of hypothesis, the possibilities which suggest themselves as consequences of our knowledge; but any real extension of knowledge in this way is impossible. The psychologist acts here like the philologist, who supplements the fragment of an ancient author by critical conjecture. The</page><page sequence="15">Harald Höffding 393 mental world—as compared with the physical world—is to us as a fragment; it is possible to complete it only by means of hypothesis, and even such completion has great difficulties, which have already been touched upon. This fragmentary character of the psychological phenom ena, as known to us, makes it impossible for psychology ever to become an exact science, such as physics is already, and as physiology is in process of becoming. The inner incompleteness of psychology is connected with the fact that we can propound no principle to which both our psychological and our physical knowledge can be traced back. Philosophical speculation has sought for some such principle, from which both the world of spirit and of matter might be deduced. Spinoza found it in "substance," the infinite original essence, Schelling in "the absolute identity," Hegel in the "absolute idea." But it has been proved of every principle of this kind that it contains no real explanation, and that the deduction rests on unwarranted assumptions. Starting from experience, we are led to formulate such an aim, but perceive at the same time that it can never be attained. But if we cannot at once reach an exact deductive psychol ogy, to say nothing of a higher knowledge from which both psychology and physics might be deduced, we may establish by way of induction significant laws, which hold good in matter of fact for both conscious life and external nature. To Herbert Spencer belongs the credit of having first really worked from this point of view.9 He has shown that all phenomena known in inner as well as in outer experience are subject to evolution, and has tried to lay down laws of evolution common to both. In all departments evolution consists in transition from an inco herent, indefinite, and homogeneous state to coherence, definiteness, heterogeneity. By these common laws and forms mental life appears from a new side as closely bound up with the general life of the universe; with this its paths are inter laced. Here we will call special attention only to the fact that progressive individualization may be given as the common mark of evolution in all its forms. Everywhere in nature smaller totalities form themselves within the great, infinite totality, each with its particular relation of interaction with the sur rounding world.10 An individual is a being which is in such a</page><page sequence="16">394 The Conscious and the Unconscious way separated off from and independent of its surroundings that it can react upon them with a certain uniqueness. But as already hinted, the full stamp of individuality is found only in the province of conscious life, where are given inner centres of endurance and action. This law of the universe receives therefore its clearest expression in the mental province, as a sort of compensation for the fact that the more elementary law of the persistence of energy cannot be established there. Could these two laws be brought into inner harmony or reduced to a yet deeper principle, all problems would be solved. Translated by Mary E. Lowndes ( 1891 ) Notes 1. In Carpenter, Mental Physiology, p. 515 seq., there are a great number of examples. Some of those quoted in what follows above, are taken from this collection. Benecke in the first chapter of his Psychological Sketches (Göttingen, 1827) has inquired with great acuteness into the relation between the conscious and the unconscious. 2. Helmholtz, Physiological Optics, p. 811. Afterwards Helmholtz avoided the use of this expression on account of the misuse made of it by Schopenhauer and Hartmann. But he still adheres to the position that we have here to do with an elementary process, which lies at the bottom of all thought properly so-called (The Facts of Perception, Berlin 1873, p. 27 seq.). 3. In H. Bröchner's treatise, On the Course of a Development in the History of Philosophy, (Copenhagen, 1869), will be found many interesting indications of the way in which ideas may unconsciously influence their advocates; even their opponents, in the age which has produced them. See also his paper in New Danish Monthly (1871) on the relation between the conscious and the unconscious. 4. I have myself had an exactly similar experience. 5. Koch, Of Consciousness in States of so-called Unconsciousness (Stuttgart, 1877): "There may be remembrance even of what was absolutely unconscious, as when, e.g. of a series of events, which did not come into consciousness, the last member joins on to a conscious state, and from it the whole series is raised by reproduction into consciousness; or when, in some later conscious state, the brain is disposed somewhat as it was in an unconscious state, and the correlated processes are then reproduced as conscious, as memory" (19). 6. Physiology, Vol. iii., p. 460. Carpenter also cites a number of examples (pars. 479-80). 7. This view is held by various more modern writers. The most interesting development is that of Clifford (Lectures and Essays, Vol. ii., pp. 61-84 seq.). Virchow, who contested this hypothesis in his speech on "The Liberty of Science," made nevertheless in regard to it the significant admission that, if the mental processes could be completely brought into connection with what takes place in the rest of the world, the province of mental phenomena would necessarily be extended far below the human consciousness—down to the lowest animals, to plants, cells, and atoms (p. 27). Monistic speculation cannot be called inadmissible, if it really is the only logical method of postulating connection between the mental phenomena and the rest of the world.</page><page sequence="17">Harald Höffding 395 8.
