Copenhagen (Munksgaard), I949. Pp. xvi, s5i, illus., bibliog. Price Sw. kr. 30 This book is the life work of an Esthonian folklorist who, in 1927, founded the Esthonian Folklore Archive, and during fifteen years collected more than 252,000 pages of new material, assisted by several hundred collaborators, until he was removed from his office by the Nazis in I942. From the Communists he fled to Sweden, where he was asked by the Gustavus Adolphus Academy to prepare a survey ofEsthonian folk religion. The first thick volume of the survey, which has now been published in German, gives us ample material for the study of the comparative folklore and the science of religions. Loorits has made full use of old chronicles and other archives, of the special literature of the subject and, above all, of the hitherto unpublished notes of all Esthonian folklore collec- tions. Besides the source material we find archxological, linguistic and historical information from subsidiary fields. Loorits seems to be wholly versed not only in Esthonian and other Finno-Ugrian folk religions, but in the cultures of neighbouring nations, presenting particularly often German, Slavonic and Baltic (i.e. Latvian and Lithuanian) parallels. Loorits does not divide the religious conceptions of the Esthonians historically into periods, but analyses them according to phenomena and structure, explains them psychologically and functionally, examines the geographical, social, economic and cultural milieu, and deals with pagan as well as Christian folk traditions. He does not start from a scholar's or a theologian's doctrines, but is all the time trying to convey to us what people themselves believe in and how they themselves interpret their religious experiences. Yet in this respect he places the Esthonian material against the background of the Finno-Ugrian peoples' cultural history during thousands of years, and elucidates the fundamental problems of the history of religion mostly from the aspect of the Uralic culture area, drawing parallels or showing contrasts with the corresponding process of development in the Altaic, Arctic and Indo-European culture areas. In this way each problem has received a thorough treatment, beginning with the oldest elements and proceeding step by step through their original development and the evidence of the foreign loans, and ending with the newest folk traditions. Loorits is not at all as pessimistic as, e.g., Jan de Vries and many other scholars con- cerning the value of folk traditions as source material when recon- structing the oldest epochs and elements. But quite often Loorits establishes the existence of syncretism, in which elements from different periods and culture areas have melted into a unity, so that it is impossible either to separate them from each other or to divide them into atoms. Vivismus, dynamismus and animismus are the basic problems with which Loorits deals in his book. W. Wundt's old classification of different forms of the soul has here reappeared in a modern version in chapters that give us a synthesis of the folk traditions about body, shadow, atem and name (or word). Loorits does not speak unequi- vocally about body soul, organ soul, shadow soul, etc., but accepts the viewpoint of Frazer, van der Leeuw, Gronbech and others with reference to vital substance and different powers (physical and psychological), both in microcosm and macrocosm. In treating the body Loorits deals also with the corpse in Esthonian religious traditions, and shows how even the term 'living corpse' is to a certain degree based on fact. He analyses the connexion between the corpse and the burial place more thoroughly, and states that the oldest method of burial by Finno-Ugrian people was the air or platform burial, followed by earth and fire burials. He elucidates with many examples on the one hand the transformation of the dead into bad spirits or Christian devils, and on the other points out how the shadow conception has favoured the creation of various ghosts. And from the shadow conception comes the figure cult which is confined by the Finno-Ugrians mostly to the cult of dead people (or ancestors). Finno-Ugrian motifs about the atem soul are explained by Loorits as Indo-European loans (to which the whirlwind also belongs), but in the chapter about 'name' and 'word' there is fascinating material, treated in rather a new way, elucidating both the Finno-Ugrian and the Aryan mentality. For the conception 'external soul' Loorits has created a new German term, Sonderseele (frisjdl in Scandinavian languages), and he pays much attention to a thorough analysis of this conception. This brings him near to the problems of shamanism, and enables him to show the great degeneration of shamanism in Esthonian folk religion. The idea of transformation does not seem to be original to the Finno-Ugrian tribes and occurs in Esthonian folk religion only in connexion with the werewolf, whereas the concept of the transmigration of souls is very characteristic of Uralic religion. Here, too, Loorits creates a new German term Wanderseele ('wander- ing soul'), to designate a soul transferred from one body to another. He shows how, in many rudiments of Esthonian folk tradition, the soul of the dead is transferred to animals, insects (particularly lice and bedbugs), reptiles, etc., and originally into migratory birds. The climax of the book is to be found in the long chapter on Naturgefulhl ('nature feeling'), Lebensauffassung ('conception of life'), and Weltbild ('the idea of the universe'). Here Loorits gives us material that has been hitherto quite unknown to historians of Uralic culture. It represents an essential addition to the comparative science of religion about the cosmogony and the system of the world, particularly about the idea of the universe, etiology, eschatology, and giants as beings forming Nature. In the next chapter the conception of 'spirit? in Uralic religion is thoroughly dealt with for the first time. He elucidates the process of anthropo- morphizing nature beings, and the book concludes with a chapter that gives us ample material about the guardian spirit in Esthonian religion, formed mostly on the pattern of Indo-European neighbours. Loorits' book is above all an ideologically systematized Hand- wdrterbuch des estnischen Aberglaubens, as it were, wherein we can find much detail and descriptive documentation of different motifs by using the adequate index of catchwords. But many questions of principle and method are also dealt with. An interpretation worthy of the eminence of the modern science of religion is given to magic and sorcery (p. 9), the death problem (pp. 70f.), revolutions in the belief in the dead (pp. I27ff.), phantom figures (p. I58), idols and processions (pp. I76ff.), conceptions of honour (pp. 2IOff.), voice (pp. 223ff.), word tabu and pseudonyms (pp. 240f.), herrnhutismus as the new form of shamanism (p. 262), revolutions in the belief in sorcery (pp. 264f.), the power of attraction of the Puck conception (p. 298), statics and rhythm as life principles of the Uralic tribes (pp. 348, 46i), migratory birds as symbols (pp. 362f.), adornments and offerings (p. 376), the problem of divinity (p. 396), the idea of the universe (pp. 4i6, 446f.), evolutionism and promonotheismus (p. 421), particular strata of the etiological tales (pp. 459ff.), the path traversed by the Uralic culture between the Ural mountains and the Caspian Sea (p. 46i), giants and heroes (pp. 483f.), cavemen and tribal organization (p. 485), after-effects of a historical act of terrorism (p. 487), spiritualism (p. 502), anthropomorphism and animism (pp. 540f.), the idea of the guardian spirit (pp. 543f.), the king idea (p. 549), the cult of saints (pp. 570ff.), the conception of God (pp. s89f.), etc. A specialist may note that Loorits very often adopts a rather inde- pendent standpoint, usually without criticism of other scholars; see, for example, the problem of the first and the last sheaf (pp. 32ff.), the interpretation of poetic figures and fictions (pp. 366, 38I, 555), the explanation of the so-called 'dream soul' (pp. 5I5ff.), etc. His opinion on the interpretation of chain songs deserves consideration (pp. 225f., 388), and also that of the characteristics of folk songs (p. 371). A complete change in theory is implied in the map on p. 531, where the method of diffusion of Esthonian folk songs is defined quite differently from the hitherto accepted hypotheses of the Finnish scholar K. Krohn. More than hitherto we have to observe the phenomenon that what were once fairy tales are trans- formed into folk songs (p. 323). But Loorits opens wide perspectives on the many problems of cultural migration and geography (pp. 132f., 152, 298, 46i, 466, 558, S70ff.). When. penetrating deeply into these problems, the reader will realize how Esthonian folk religion has been transformed into a synthesis of oriental and occidental elements and how here, to a peculiar degree, 'an occi- dental building has been erected on a certainly Nordic and partly oriental foundation' (p. 2). We must moreover give due weight to the author's assertion that Esthonian folk tradition had absorbed 98</page><page sequence="2">JULY, 1950 Man Nos. 152-I58 mostly German elements and consequently presents complementary material for the investigators of the older and newer strata of German religious traditions. Among printer's errors is the misprint on p. 274: the work by Dionysius Fabricius was not published in I792 but in I592. AKE CAMPBELL</page></plain_text>
