<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TRUE IMAGE OF CHRIST: EUSEBIUS'EUSEBIUS' LETTER TO CONSTANTIA RECONSIDERED' The letter of Eusebius of Caesarea to the Empress Constantia2 is an important part of the literary dossier on early Christian attitudes to 1 This is an expanded version of a communication read at the Fifth Annual Byzantine Studies Conference in Washington, D.C. in October 1979. The following abbreviations for the titles of Eusebius' works will be used: H.E. = HistoriaHistoria Ecclesiastica; D.E. = Demonstratio Evangelica; P.E. = Praeparatio Evangelica;Evangelica; L.C. = De Laudibus Constantini; V.C. = De Vita Constantini; E.T.E.T. = DeEcclesiasticaTheologia;C.I. = Commentariainlsaiam. Unless otherwise noted, the references are to the edition of the texts in the Berlin corpus (G.C.S.). * The first piecing together of the fragments of the letter was undertaken by F. Boivin in a note to his edition (1702) of the Byzantina Historia of the fourteenth century scholar Nicephorus Gregoras, on the basis of the edition of the Acts of the council of 787 and one manuscript of the patriarch Nicephorus's Contra</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND STUDIES 461 religious images. If genuine, it is in fact the earliest extant sustained theological argument against Christian religious art proper. Eusebius addresses the Empress Constantia, sister of Constantine the Great and wife of Licinius, who has apparently asked him for a pictorial represen tation of the Saviour. Taking his departure from one strand of Pauline Christology in the Epistle to the Philippians, and identifying the concepts of μορφή and είκών, Eusebius first draws a distinction between the image of the divine Christ in his pre-existent state and the 'shape of the servant' after the Incarnation. Eusebius professedly can scarcely conceive that his correspondent should be asking for the divine image; the request must be for an image of the incarnate Lord. But Eusebius rejects its legitimacy, on the grounds that the divinity which continually invested the Saviour even during his earthly life (as shown by the Transfiguration epiphany), and of course in his post-resurrection state of exaltation, effectively precludes his depiction in material form. As subsidiary arguments, Eusebius first appeals to the second command ment and the fact of its strict observance in all Christian churches. He mentions then that at one time he has already confiscated, from a woman, supposed pictorial representations of Paul and the Saviour, to avoid the charge of idolatry being brought against Christians. Furthermore, an idolatrous worship of images of the founder of the sect is seen only among the godless heretics: thus, it is rumoured that Simon Magus' depiction is an object of worship, and Eusebius himself has seen the picture of Mani being carried around in a ceremonial manner by his adherents. Christians, by contrast, behold their divine Saviour spiritually, when they have purified their hearts; those who desire to see images have the divine Logos as the best of painters. The letter to Constantia contains arguments of obvious value to later opponents of image worship; the text was in fact adduced by the EusebiumEusebium et Epiphanidem (Par. gr. 910, olim 1989). For purposes of anti-Palamite polemic, Gregoras uses and cites from the Contra Eusebium in his Historia as well as in his Antirrhetica (ed. H.-V. Beyer, Nikephoros Gregoras, Antirrhetika, i (Vienna, 1976), pp. 309-15). Boivin's edition is reproduced in the notes to the Bonn edition of Gregoras' work (ed. L. Schopen, Nicephori Gregorae Byzantina Historia,Historia, ii (Bonn, 1830), pp. 1301-3). Boivin's text was further reprinted by Migne (P.G. xx, cols. 1545-9) and thence in turn by H. Geischer (Der byzanti nischenische Bilderstreit (Giitersloh, 1968), pp. 15-17). J. B. Pitra's collection of the fragments follows Boivin's, though it is based on a larger number of manuscripts of Nicephorus' work; somewhat misleadingly, it is incorporated as a separate chapter in the edition of the Contra Eusebium (Spicilegium Solesmense, i (Paris, 1852), pp. 383-6). H. Hennephof's recent edition is basically a reprint of Pitra's, though a few readings from the text of the Refutatio et Eversio in Coisl. 93 are registered (Textus byzantini ad iconomachiam pertinentes (Leiden, 1969), pp. 42-4). In the subsequent discussion the text will be cited according to page and line numbers in Hennephof's edition.</page><page sequence="3">462 NOTES AND STUDIES eighth-century iconoclasts, first in the patristic florilegium attached to the nevoeis of the Emperor Constantine V, written prior to the council of 754,1 and then in die horos of that council.1 Two extracts from the letter are cited in the horos,3 and additional portions are preserved in two works of the ninth-century iconophile controversialist Nicephorus, the Contra Eusebtum et Epiphanidem* and the (still unpublished) RefutatioRefutatio et Eversio.s It is quite clear from the fragments themselves as well as from the manner of their citation that the whole of the letter has not been preserved. In particular the beginning as well as the end of the letter are lost, and there are gaps between the several fragments, though these are apparently cited in the original sequence. Though quotations from the letter are interspersed with quotations from other Eusebian as well as non-Eusebian texts, the thrust of the reasoning, although meandering and repetitive, can be, I think, recovered. The letter first emerges embedded in eighth-century controversial literature: there is no prior independent attestation of any sort for it. This should of course make one consider the possibility that it was in fact forged by the iconoclasts themselves to support their case;6 to be sure, the iconophile polemicists, rather than arguing for inauthenticity, 1 See my monograph, Byzantine Iconoclasm during the Reign of Constantine V, with with Particular Attention to the Oriental Sources (Louvain, 1977), pp. 37-5«, esp. p. 47. 2 Op. cit., pp. 85-6. נ As is of course well known, the horos is preserved only as part of the Acts of the council of 787; for the Eusebius passage see J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Con ciliorumciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio, xiii (Florence, 1767), p. 313A-D. * Extant in five Paris manuscripts (Par. gr. 909,910,911,1250, and Coisl. 93); see R. P. Blake, 'Note sur l'activiti littiraire de Niciphore I,r patriarche de Constantinople', Byzantion, xiv (1939), pp. 1-15· The work was edited by Pitra as two separate texts, entitled by him Eusebii Caesarensis Refutatio and Pseudo EpiphaniiEpiphaniiEpiphanii sive Epiphanidis Confutatio. The exact title in Coisl. 93 (fol. 20r) is: ΆντΆντΆντΙρρησκ και άνασκινη των Eiatβίου καΐ 'ΕπιφανΙΒον λύγων των κατά τη! τοΰ Σωτηρο! ήμωνήμων Χρίστου σαρκώύΐω! ληρωδηθίντων (Blake, op. cit., p. 11). On the work see further P. J. Alexander, The Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople: Ecclesiastical Policy Policy and Image Worship in the Byzantine Empire (Oxford, 1958) pp. 173-8. 55 Par. gr. 1250, fol. 216r-216v = Coisl. 93, fol. 43r (two citations from the letter corresponding to p. 42, lines 12-13, p. 42, line 16-p. 43, line 5); Par. gr. 1250, fol. 307" = Coisl. 93, fol. 133v-!34r (two citations corresponding to p. 43, lines 1-5, and lines 24-30). It should be noted that the second pair of Eusebius quotations occurs in that part of the Refutatio et Eversio which is devoted to the iconoclastic florilegium, in the midst of a series of quotations from Epiphanius (see P. J. Alexander, 'The Iconoclastic Council of Saint Sophia (815) and its Definition (Horos)', Dumbarton Oaks Papers, vii (1954), p. 64). There is a strong possibility that the Eusebius quotations (overlooked by Alexander in his edition) may well have formed part of the florilegium of 815. 6 This was of course argued by G. Ostrogorsky for the majority of the icono clastic quotations from Epiphanius (Studien zur Geschichte des byzantinischen BilderstreitesBilderstreites (Breslau, 1929), pp. 61 ff). Rather surprisingly, Ostrogorsky does not discuss at all Eusebius' letter, though there are affinities in the Christological</page><page sequence="4">NOTES AND STUDIES 463 considered the testimony to lack value simply because of the heretical, Arian sympathies of Eusebius. Though some modern scholars have expressed doubts or reservations about the genuineness of the letter,1 no detailed investigation has yet been undertaken to attempt to settle the matter. The comments that follow are intended to contribute to this still outstanding task. Though it should give one pause, the lack of independent manu script evidence and external attestation by itself is not a matter of much moment. The letters of Eusebius do not ever seem to have been collected into a corpus,2 and those that are extant survive because they are cited in other works;3 in particular the only evidence for another letter of Eusebius, addressed to Alexander of Alexandria, is again the citation in the refutation of the horos in the Acts of 787.♦ What about the addressee and the occasion of the letter ? The Empress Constantia, as is well known, was a supporter of the Arian party and exerted an influence on her brother even after the fall of Licinius.5 Though no mention is made in the sources of her connection with Eusebius of Caesarea, they belonged to the same party in the Nicene argument and in some of the phraseology to the Epiphanius fragments. Cf. E. Kitzinger, 'The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm', Dumbarton Oaks Papers,Papers, viii (1954), p. 93 n. 28 (= The Art of Byzantium and the West: Selected Studies Studies (Bloomington, 1976), p. 93). 1 In particular Ch. Murray, 'Art and the Early Church', J.T.S. N.s. xxviii (1977),(1977), pp. 326 ff. R. Grigg, though inclined to accept its genuineness, never theless thinks that 'the question of the authenticity of the letter has not been forthrightly dealt with' ('Constantine the Great and the Cult Without Images', Viator,Viator, viii (1977), p. 31 n. 179). 2 The vague reference to το συγγράμματα και αί imaτολαι αϋτοΰ πάσαι (Mansi, xiii. 3!6α), does not, I think, refer to the existence of a 'Briefsammlung', pace Harnack (Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur, ii/2 (Leipzig, 1958), p. 126 n. 2). 2 See Harnack, op. cit. i/2, pp. 583-4. The famous letter to Carpianus on the use of the canonical tables is transmitted in gospel manuscripts (op. cit., p. 573). 4 Mansi, xiii. 316c. In the Acts reference is made to the other letters of Eusebius to Alexander (31 7a) ; it seems that in the eighth century the patriarchal library in Constantinople still preserved letters of Eusebius which are now otherwise unknown. In this connection, it is significant that the eighth-century patriarch Germanus I explicitly says that the heretical works of Eusebius were kept in a separate chest in the patriarchal library (P.G. 98, 53A. cited in V.C., ed. Winkelmann, p. xxviii). On this library in general cf. C. Mango, 'The Avail ability of Books in the Byzantine Empire a.d. 750-850', in Byzantine Books and Bookmen Bookmen (Washington, 1975), p. 34. Incidentally, the lack of inclusion of the Eusebius text among the proof-texts in Par. gr. 1115 should hardly occasion surprise (pace Murray, pp. 327-8), since we are there dealing with an iconophile florilegiuml! 5 See O.

Hh</page><page sequence="5">464 NOTES AND STUDIES controversy, and one can without difficulty envisage a correspondence, in the course of which the request for the icon of Christ was made. It has been found incongruous that Eusebius would have addressed a letter written in such peremptory terms to a member of the imperial family;1 but one should keep in mind that we do not have the opening section which may well have been filled with the customary courtly flattery, to soften the admitted abruptness of the theological rebuke proper. The letter may have been written prior to the council of Nicaea, but this is not entirely certain.2 One can further speculate, on the basis of the fact that Constantia is not elsewhere mentioned by name in Eusebius' works,3 that there was an early estrangement between them, perhaps even occasioned by Eusebius' handling of this matter of the icon. This same silence, at any rate, makes it extremely unlikely that an eighth-century forger would have hit upon the idea of making specifi cally Constantia the recipient of the letter. How do statements in the letter fit into the general fourth-century artistic milieu? Is there in particular a discrepancy between the firm rejection of images in the letter and Eusebius' well-known description of the statue of Panaeas?4 Though of course to some extent it is a matter of taste whether one regards Eusebius' description of this work of art as being characterized by 'sympathy and interest',5 or merely as being neutral and detached, it is clear that Eusebius is referring to what he deems to be a work of pagan origin; the question of a Christian's image of Christ simply does not arise. What about his enthusiastic comments in the V.C. about the artistic works commissioned by the emperor?6 It is, to my mind, quite unnecessary to resort here to any drastic theory of post-Eusebian interpolation;7 rather, in line with prior ' Murray, op. cit., pp. 335-6. 2 As Harnack points out (Geschichte, ii/2, p. 127) the addressing of Constantia as 'Augusta' (Mansi, xiii. 313A; replaced by Nicephorus with βασίλισσα (Adversus Eusebium,Eusebium,Eusebium, ed. Pitra, p. 382, line 24; Par. gr. 1250, fol. 216r) indicates that Licinius is still in power; i.e. the letter is to be dated before 324. But, though her title after Licinius' fall was legally only nobilissima femina (Seeck, loc. cit.), Eusebius may have continued to use the earlier title as a form of flattery. Th. KlauserKlauser does not adduce any evidence for his date of c. 327 (Gesammelte Arbeiten zurzur Liturgiegeschichte, Kirchengeschichte und christlichen Archaologie (Miinster, !974). PP· 332, 340· 2 Eusebius notes in passing that Constantine bestowed the hand of his (unnamed) sister on the ungrateful Licinius (H.E. x. 8, ed. Schwartz, p. 892, line 15; V.C. i, 50. 1, ed. Winkelmann, p. 41, lines 16-17). But admittedly the avoidance of the direct mention of names belongs to the encomiastic style of the V.C.V.C.

The letter notes the binding force of the second commandment, but, to my mind, does so in a peripheral fashion,1 and almost as a concession, it seems, to what may have been the standard response to the problem at hand.2 Eusebius, as other Christian exegetes, took a nuanced view of the legal prescriptions of the Old Testament, and in particular of the Decalogue; but a simple allusion to the commandment, after his sophisticated Christological argument, is not at all discordant with his usual attitude to the lasting pedagogical and civilizing value of the Old Testament Law.3 The appearance of the motif of the liberation of mankind from demonic error by the incarnate Logos4 is characteristic for Eusebius;5 the designations of Christ as 'God' and 'Logos' are consonant with Eusebius' customary terminology.6 The description of the animate and divinized earthly body as the very image of Christ7 (in implied contrast to lifeless idols) is authentically Eusebian.8 The central point in the Christological argument is concordant with Eusebius' position that, though the Incarnation was important and real, the humanity was utterly transformed and absorbed by the divinity.9 The criticism which finds the Christological emphasis 'curious' and, in some way inconsistent with Eusebius' espousal of Arianism,10 shows a serious (there is the reproduction of the scene in an oriental manuscript illustration in K. Rudolph, Die Gnosis (Leipzig, 1977), Tafel 23; see further C. R. C. Allberry, 'Das manichaische Bema-Fest', Zeitschriftfiir die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, xxxvii (1938), p. 9). In view of the Eusebius text and the iconographical evidence the interpretation of the hikon (άκων) in the Coptic Manichaean texts as an illustrated book (L. J. Ort, Mani, a Religio-Historical Description of His Per sonalitysonality (Leiden, 1967), p. 253) lacks cogency. 1 Pace Murray, op. cit., p. 332, and Breckenridge, op. cit., p. 103. 2 For instance, Clement of Alexandria explicitly says: ,άπηγόρευται ήμΐν αναφανδόν αναφανδόν άπατηλόν εργάζεσθαι τεχνην. "ου γαρ ποιήσεις" φησιν ό προφήτης, "παντός ομοίωμα,ομοίωμα, όσα έν τω ούρανψ άνω καΐ όσα εν τη γη κάτω."' (Protropticus, ch. 4, ed. Stahlin, p. 47, lines 28-9). It is curious that this well-known text (noted already by G. W. Butterworth, 'Clement of Alexandria and Art', J.T.S., xvii (1916), p. 69) is not discussed at all by Murray in her attempt to show that Clement is not hostile to the making of images (op. cit., pp. 320-1). 3 Cf.

An indirect clue can be found, I think, in Nicephorus' refutation of the letter. After criticizing some features of Eusebius' Christology,2 Nice phorus abruptly denies that Eusebius can even be called a priest since he holds heterodox views of the eucharist.3 Nicephorus further argues against the legitimacy of some specifically spiritualizing terminology being applied to the eucharistic elements.4 He closes his attack with a blast against those disciples of Eusebius who call the elements 'image of the body'.5 Now, the case for the general Eusebian inspiration of the iconoclasts' eucharistic image doctrine has been presented in detail elsewhere;6 it seems that one can in fact argue that at this point in the missing portion of the letter to Constantia, Eusebius, appealing to his sacerdotal status, told the empress that he could give her the true image of Christ—the eucharist, the one licit material image. Eusebius' subsequent polemical remarks against specifically anthropomorphic pagan representations7 indicate that in this missing segment of the letter Eusebius may already have emphasized (as did the eighth-century iconoclasts) the appropriateness of the 'abstract' nature of this Christ image, as an antidote to idolatry.8 ' On the transcending, according to Eusebius, of normal human nature through the union of the Logos and the flesh, and the production of a 'naturally higher being', in the context of the still prevalent 'Logos-sarx' Christology, see A. Grillmeier, Christ in Christian Tradition, vol. 1, 2nd edn. (Atlanta, 197s), p. 183. 22 Contra Eusebiumf ed.

Pitra, p. 439» lines 7-11). 4 Judging by Nicephorus' wording, it seems that Eusebius emphasized the simultaneous intellectual and physical perception of the true nature of the euchariet: Τ α ουν υπ' οφιν ημών ερχόμενα, και χερσ ι περιγραφόμενα, και όδοΰσιν εδεστά γινόμενα,γινόμενα, πόθεν ημΐν άληπτα και ανεκδιήγητα, και νοερά φανείται.

Some general features of Eusebius' style can be readily recognized: the frequency of rhetorical questions,4 the piling up of synonyms,5 the separation, by the verb, of nouns from their adjectives or pronouns.6 Eusebius' Atticizing and archaizing tendency can also be noted in the letter; it is shown by the spelling of words with double τ7 and the predi * The solitary exception is K. Holl's remark that, from an unbiased viewpoint, 'Sprache, Standpunkt, Auffassung stimmen ganz mit dem unangefochtenen Eusebius Uberein', (Gesammelte Aufsatze zur Kirchengeschichte, ii (Tubingen, 1928), p. 387 n. 1). He makes the further, entirely correct, observation that 'Ware das Schreiben in einen spateren Jahrhundert gefalscht, so muBte die dogmatische Begrundung scharfer gefaUt sein', (loc. cit.)· It is regrettable that Holl, with his unsurpassed knowledge of fourth-century vocabulary, did not undertake to substantiate this brief comment elsewhere. 2 The most detailed study of Eusebius' language is still E. Fritze, Beitrage zur zur sprachlich-sttlistischen Wiirdigung des Eusebios (Borna-Leipzig, (1910). It should be noted that the analysis is not based on the entire corpus, but only on the text of the H.E., V.C., and L.C. For a more recent study of the language and style of the last work, see V.C., ed. Winkelmann, pp. lvii-lxiv; the analysis, to my mind, supports strongly the Eusebian authorship of the V.C., despite Winkel mann'smann's own more neutral conclusion (p. lvii). 3 See P. Winter, 'Matthew xi. 27 and Luke x. 22 from the First to the Fifth Century', Novum Testamentum, i (1956), pp. 121-2, 139, 147. * * Ti! οδν . . . όμολογήσαντε!

To conclude then: if the letter to Constantia is not genuine, it must have been produced by someone intimately familiar with Eusebius' cultural milieu, theological stance, as well as his peculiar grammatical style and vocabulary. However, this brilliant forger must then also have been aware of Eusebius' reputation for heterodoxy, which, as the iconophiles noted, automatically vitiated his testimony in theological 1 ίφίκοίντο (p. 43. line 22); ζοιγραφησίίΐν (p. 43, line 24); άναζωγραφήσ(κν (p. 43, line 25); φαΐα&gt; (p. 43, line 27); iSiXouv (p. 43, line 28); ίχοιμ^ν (p. 44, line 27).

As we have already noted, the choice of the relatively minor figure of Constantia as addressee is also strange if the letter is a later pseudograph. It seems that inauthenticity has no single powerful argument in its favour, and a host of reasons, specific and general, against it. To accept that the letter is indeed genuine and was discovered during the iconoclasts' archival search for patristic proof-texts seems to be the most cogent solution. What is then, in a minimal fashion, the importance of Eusebius' letter f It represents a pioneering and consequent application of fourth century Christological views to the emerging image question. Eusebius' work certainly served well the theoreticians of the iconoclastic movement in identifying the crucial issues and in providing a basic theological agenda. Though the letter cannot, I think, be regarded as the missing link between a specifically Origenistic Hellenization of Christianity and eighth-century iconoclasm,2 it clearly stands in the tradition of austere Alexandrian intellectualism and elitism, so to speak,3 to which Clement as well as Origen belonged—and a tradition to which mature Byzantine iconoclastic theology is, in an indirect way, deeply indebted.

Irmscher (ed.), ByzantinischeByzantinische BeitrageBeitrage (Berlin, 1964), pp. 91-119. 1 1 have adduced some objections to this thesis of G. Florovsky elsewhere (Byzantine(Byzantine Iconoclasm . . ., pp. 103-5). Additionally it may be noted here that Origen, unlike Eusebius, is not interested in the Transfiguration as a divine epiphany, but rather regards it as the symbol of the enlightenment gained through the allegorical exegesis of Scripture (see M. Harl, Origbie et la fonction revelatricerevelatrice du Verbe incarne (Paris, 1958), pp. 252-3). 3 On this last matter, see my article 'Hypatius of Ephesus on the Cult of Images', in Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults, Studies for Morton Smith at Sixty, Part II: Early Christianity (Leiden, 1975), pp. 208-16.</page></plain_text>
