<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steve Baker Re-reading The Corporate Personalit Introduction It is an inestimable advantage that nothing worth calling a history of corporate identity design has yet been written. It means that there is still a certain space to negotiate what kind of historical perspective we might want to take on the version of corporate identity that has been constructed in recent years, what the priorities of that perspective should be, and why. What little historical commentary does exist on the question of corporate image-making tends to fall into one of two categories. On the one hand there is scholarly writing which bears only rather indirectly on contemporary notions of corporate identity design. Examples would include David Nye's research on the corporate uses of photography at General Electric in his excellent Image Worlds, and the scattered comments on corporate publicity and advertising in Richard Tedlow's Keeping the Corporate Image.' On the other hand there is some writing which is more directly concerned with the subject, and this seems generally to have adopted a more popular style. There is, for instance, the incautious sweep of the historical generalizations in the opening chapter of Wally Olins's The Corporate Personality (his claim that 'the mediaeval commercial world ... was so rudimentary that visual imagery didn't play much of a role' is not unrepresentative); or, worse by far, there is Philip Meggs in A History of Graphic Design fussing over who had trademarks by when. Aside from Meggs, the only design-historical survey to devote any amount of space to corporate identity is Adrian Forty's Objects of Desire, though all but the opening of Forty's chapter on 'Design and corporate identity' is devoted to a case study of London Transport's design policy, and deals largely with questions of stylistic unity and aesthetic standards in design.2 From this brief glance at the literature it is far from clear exactly of what it is that a history has not yet been written. And what corporate identity currently is, I would contend, is largely the result of the ways in which Wally Olins defined the field in 1978 in his first book, The Corporate Personality. Subsequent writings, including Olins's own new Corporate Identity,3 can hardly therefore help but be judged in relation to The Corporate Personality's shaping of the subject. This is a contention which seems to pose difficulties for some design historians. Faced with an earlier version of the present paper, the Journal of Design History's editorial board seemed, on balance, to be rather surprised that Olins's popularizing writings should be thought to merit such detailed analysis. This surprise was accompanied, however, by an acknowledgment that Olins 'is almost the only plausible authority in the field'. How Olins arrived at his views on corporate identity (by reading James Pilditch, by talking to Eliot Noyes, and so on) is, for the moment, beside the point. The popular view that he is an authority on the subject, however, is entirely to the point, and can be accounted for as follows. Olins, as is well known, is chairman of the design firm Wolff Olins. In the entry on Wolff Olins in the 1984 survey Contemporary Designers, Catherine McDermott wrote that the firm's 'major contribution to design in Britain is their development of the notion of corporate identity'. As recently as Novem- ber 1988, the Design Week/Marketing Week Client Survey named Wolff Olins as Britain's 'best known corporate identity consultants'. This would have come as little more than confirmation of received wisdom, since the special issue of Design Week on corporate identity the previous month had variously described the firm as 'Britain's market leader in corporate identity' and as 'Britain's best known identity consultants'.4 Olins is an aggressive publi- cist of his firm's approach to corporate identity: he claimed in 1988 that 'there's nobody else from Britain apart from us doing it properly'. His writings must, of course, be understood as inseparable from his business activities. In a 1981 article in Designer called 'Getting new business', he suggested that any Journal of Design History Vol. 2 No. 4 ? 1989 The Design History Society 0952-4649/89 $3.00</page><page sequence="2">effective design consultant should ensure that they published articles 'in influential publications like Management Today or The Director'. He also explained that one of his firm's tactics for attracting a particular company's business was to send its chief executive a copy of The Corporate Personality.5 Whatever the motive for Olin's writings, in the years since the book's publication he has become the most prolific British writer on corporate identity. In addition to a steady flow of articles, the mid-198os saw the publication of The Wolff Olins Guide to Corporate Identity and The Wolff Olins Guide to Design Management, and now of course there is Corporate Identity, Olins's self-styled 'magnum opus' on the subject.6 The early writings, and especially The Corporate Personality, have had considerable influ- ence. David Bernstein, in his 1984 book Company Image and Reality, acknowledged his debt 'to Wally Olins for showing all of us the way'; and Adrian Forty went so far as to state in the opening of his own chapter on corporate identity that Olins's book 'is so informative that I need do no more here than summarize his argument'.7 Olins has also, not surprisingly, shaped the ideas of many contemporary practitioners of corporate identity. Recent writings by both Nicholas Jenkins of the Jenkins Group and Alan Siegel, chairman of Siegel &amp; Gale, seem to me to be heavily influenced by Olins's understanding of the subject.8 The example of Siegel is particularly significant: it suggests that Olins's well-known admiration for the American approach to corporate identity is now being reciprocated, and, perhaps more importantly, that Siegel's own book on corporate identity is unlikely to lead to a significant re-evaluation of the subject.9 Even a position which is undeniably different, such as David Davies's notion of 'corporate styling', seems in large part a frustrated reaction to the ubiquity of Olins's views and priorities, and it would in fact appear to take the form of a simple inversion of them rather than defining an independ- ent approach.10 At least as far as putting ideas on the subject into writing, therefore, Olins seems to have the controlling hand. For all these reasons, it is logical that an assess- ment of the contemporary understanding of corpor- ate identity design will focus on Olins, and will take his views seriously. It will focus on his writings rather than on particular corporate identity pro- grammes carried out by Wolff Olins bcause, notwith- standing the firm's success, it is the writings which have shaped that understanding and had a lasting influence. More specifically, its central focus will be The Corporate Personality. This is because, prior to the very recent publication of Corporate Identity at least, the later writings have been little more than footnotes to that first book, elaborating its themes and occasionally modifying its metaphors. This is not to propose that The Corporate Personality represents the origin of a particular set of ideas. Its significance in the present context stems rather from its status as an influential and polemical popular source, which articulates with some clarity a variety of contemporary design attitudes and cliches. The Surface of the Text In an essay on Gustave Flaubert's intolerance of stupidity and received ideas, Christopher Prender- gast emphasizes Flaubert's particular contempt for the bourgeois urge 'to draw over the void a veil fabricated from a bland and nauseous tissue of reassuring, instantly consumable meanings, to create a world with a totally smooth surface, without leaks and gaps'.' Without any wish to prejudge The Corporate Personality as an example of the kind of bourgeois mystification which Prendergast describes, it may none the less be productive to borrow Prendergast's analogy and to posit Olins's text as a world, a self-sufficient entity, which aims (notwithstanding its chummy prose style and its commercial motives) to map out the definitive account of its subject. This might help to explain the book's lack of an obvious or predictable narrative structure; in attempting to situate himself (and the work of his firm) in a terrain whose boundaries he is simultaneously marking out, it is as though Olins has had to move back and forth over the surface of his text, smoothing it out, covering something previously missed, while thus, in several instances, inadvertently opening up further questions or ambiguities. The result is a text which effectively resists easy narrative closure: the book's principal definitions are held back until the postscript, for instance, and the fragments of historical material and commentary are scattered across Chapters i, 2, 4, 12 and 15. Olins's account of the history of his subject is itself a 276 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="3">pluralistic one. Although he seems on balance to favour the competition between the nineteenth- century English railway companies as marking the arrival of 'the age of corporate identity as we know it',12 he does so without closing off the possibility of regarding the complex structure of the early Roman Catholic Church, or Goebbels's and Speer's work for the Third Reich, or Behrens's work for AEG as being the crucial founding examples. (If the world-text he outlines can reasonably be seen as extending to other writings and other writers, this list can quickly incorporate further options: the French Revolution, or the Cluniac monastic order, or tribal body painting.13) The task of the present re-reading will be to be attentive to the 'leaks and gaps' in the surface of Olins's world-text-to its inconsistencies, its unremarked metaphors, its areas of silence. The challenge is to do so without creating the pretence that the basis for this re-reading, the reader's position, is somehow outside that same text ('thereby inhabiting more naively and more strictly than ever the inside one declares one has deserted', as Derrida warns14). This is not at all a matter of what has been dismissively called 'the reduction of discursive practices to textual traces',15 with its implication of the abnegation of all political responsibility. Some design historians would indeed insist that the priority for any 'serious' analysis of corporate identity should be an investigation of the political ramifications of its practice-whether through specific contemporary instances such as its applica- tion to government departments, to the police, and to nationalized industries in the run-up to their privatization,16 or through a more general analysis of design consultancy's complicity in the structures of corporate power. Urgent as such analyses un- doubtedly are, the cost of this priority is typically an inattention to the visual, as though the visual was really too trivial, too transparent, to be political (or historical). It is a priority which allows its pro- ponents to ignore the absence, or to disclaim responsibility for the absence, of any real framework for discussing the visual workings (whether principally aesthetic or communicative) of what Peter Dormer has called 'the much vaunted design process', and implicitly to condone the continuing mystification of that process in design writing. The problem, again, comes down to what exactly it is that is being described. Peter Gorb has written, with corporate identity in mind, that 'the most complex in all design activity is the design of identities'.17 This complexity might reasonably be presumed to stem, at least in part, from the fact that the designer appears to be faced with the task of devising a way of giving the rather abstract and problematic notion of identity a concise visual or pictorial form-a form which will be readily under- stood by viewers as a kind of visual equivalent to the identified group's conception of itself. If this simplistic description of the task is even vaguely accurate, it is a task for which the literature on graphic design presently offers astonishingly little guidance. Graphic solutions are typically explained either in stupidly simple terms ('a wheel shape for the transport conglomerate', as Peter York aptly satirizes it), or else are of the make-up-the- symbolism-as-you-go-along variety: a random but representative example from the pages of Design Week describes a logo's use of dark blue to 'reflect financial integrity', with light blue highlights to imply 'an enterprising spirit'.18 To excuse this nonsense on the basis that it is intended merely for clients' consumption is to miss the point that there isn't an alternative, less inane mode of explanation hidden away somewhere else in the design litera- ture. The designing bit of the design process is allowed to pass as something designers just do, naturally, intuitively ... veiled from words. Design history's fragmentary contributions to the subject have so far done little to alleviate the overlooking of these problems of description, because the overriding preoccupation of the writers has been the aesthetic quality of the design solution. Thus Forty's thin and disappointing conclusion is that 'London Transport's design identity was nothing if not a very high class piece of tailoring'; while Meggs's prose at times simply floats off from sense, as when it describes how, in the 1950s, Paul Rand realized that to be functional over a long period of time, a trademark should be reduced to elementary shapes that are visually unique and also styleless; that is, the various forms composing the mark are reduced to elementary shapes that are universal and timeless.19 Meggs is an easy target, of course, but the point is a serious one: design historians are not at the moment Re-reading The Corporate Personality 277</page><page sequence="4">providing their readers with any understanding, historical or otherwise, of how the complexities of identity are given visual form by the designer, let alone going on to consider whose ends the resulting identities serve, and how they do so. The purpose of looking again slowly and closely at Olins's text is therefore, above all, to establish whether or not these unanswered questions are at present even being framed in an answerable way. Dealings with Identity It may be well to start with the question of visual equivalence-the question, that is, of whether or not Olins regards one of the principal tasks of a corporate identity programme as being the devising, by the designer, of some kind of visual equivalent to the organization's conception of itself. There is evidence that he does. Towards the end of The Corporate Personality, pouring scorn on the ubiquity of hackneyed i96os-style graphic solutions to identity problems, he asks: Why are graphic designers still ... churning out these symbols consisting of initial letters tormented into a bizarre shape and ending with an arrow, preferably pointing upwards and slightly to the right, indicative of Progress, Dynamism and a controlled but powerful thrust towards what is clearly a Better and Brighter Future? Why is it that the design idea that ultimately emerges is so often banal and trite?20 His answer involves a consideration of 'the pressures that influence designers', one of which he describes thus: Another pressure is that most large organizations want to say the same thing: they want to be friendly, progressive, modern, efficient-human and dynamic. These worn out and meaningless verbal cliches have visual equivalents- that's where these arrows darting desperately about the place come from. (p. 189) Certain assumptions can be teased out from this suggestion that trite graphic solutions result from trite corporate requirements. They may be expressed as follows: visual equivalence is no problem-the corporation's cliches simply 'have' visual equi- valents, and it is up to the designer to use them; in doing so, the designer may have to forgo originality, but at least the meaningless image will be a truthful reflection of the meaningless identity the organiza- tion apparently desires to promote; and if similar organizations are intent upon communicating similarly vacuous ideas, then of course their design programmes will tend to look the same. Taking this a stage further, if the designer's principal responsibil- ity is to communicate visually the identity which a company already has or believes itself to have, and if (as Olins seems to believe) visual styles and images can be relied on to signify in a relatively constant manner in any given period, then of course visual equivalence is no problem. Designers have simply to turn to the appropriate page of their conceptual pattern-books, and the job is as good as done! This is of course to caricature Olins's views, but it is worth exploring further how he gets himself into this particular fix. Of the first generation of modern American design consultants, the one most respected by Olins is Eliot Noyes. Noyes was associated with and was largely responsible for IBM's corporate identity programme from about 1948 until his death in 1977. IBM's example is praised repeatedly in The Corporate Personality and, both there and in one of Olins's earlier articles, Noyes's views on corporate identity are presented as being exemplary and authoritative.21 In a conversa- tion shortly before his death, Noyes told Olins that his IBM identity work was not based on a detailed analysis of the company. Instead, as Olins reports with the sense of communicating a truth of inestim- able value, 'he said that the programme was based simply on the idea that IBM was a modern company producing modern products and that was what it ought to look like'.22 It seems likely that this is the source, or at least that it is a major source of substantiation, for Olins's apparent belief that a company should and can unproblematically look like what it is like. Noyes's philosophy, as reported by Olins, carries the implication that companies do have a sense of identity (no matter how trivial, as in 'we are modern') and that the designer's job is truthfully to reflect that identity. This is not simply a matter of stating the obvious, but of emphasizing the fact that in the pages of The Corporate Personality the designer is indeed regarded as dealing with visual identity, and not with something rather different which might be char- acterized as visual style, or visual image. The rhetoric of many of the basic 'how to do it' writings on corporate identity and corporate advertising reflects 278 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="5">the belief that 'image' is not enough. James Pilditch insisted in 1970 that an essential aspect of any corporate identity brief was the requirement that 'image and reality must be integrated'; Olins has argued elsewhere that 'it is all very well for people to talk about giving companies "a new image", but the image is counter-productive if there is no reality underlying it'; and David Bernstein concurs that the tendency 'to treat image as detachable from reality ... has exacerbated the problems which business has with its publics'.23 This rhetorical opposition of image and reality is fundamental to The Corporate Personality, where Olins makes it explicit that the 'reality' is that of the organization's identity. This is most fully explained in the book's postscriptal definitions, as Olins offers his own interpretation of some of the 'loose and sloppy' terminology used 'in the trade': My definitions relate largely to the depth in which the subject is perceived. I start with the term house style, which defines the subject at its most superficial level. A house style is a graphic design scheme applied to some, most or even all of a company's visible manifestations. House style to my mind implies a cosmetic job. Corporate personality, on the other hand, embraces the subject at its most profound level. It is the soul, the persona, the spirit, the culture of the organization manifested in some way. A corporate personality is not necessarily something tangible that you can see, feel or touch-although it may be. The tangible manifestation of a corporate personality is a corporate identity. It is the identity that projects and reflects the reality of the corporate personality. (p. 212) This passage itself involves ambiguities of termino- logy and of attitude, and I shall return to these. For the present the important thing is the book's proposal that a corporate identity programme should project and reflect an organization's sense of itself, and that the designer's job thus goes, somehow, beyond styling. Olins's criticisms of house style and of image can be regarded as representative of a long-standing set of objections to undue emphasis being put on the role of the logo within a corporate identity pro- gramme. Objectors range from Henrion in the i96os calling for 'a great anti-symbol campaign', to Nicholas Jenkins in the late 198os criticizing 'the "new heraldry" so often depicted in the pages of Design Week'.24 In a paper delivered to the Royal Society of Arts in December 1978 Olins himself stated quite explicitly that he found it much easier to grasp what corporate identity is really about or at any rate what it should be about by reference to historical, social or political precedents than by plunging into the minutiae of letterhead designs, symbols, logotypes, colour schemes .. 25 At one level Olins's position here is understandable and laudable: it represents his stand against the kinds of impoverished formalist account of corporate identity which can result from homing in on the aesthetics of the logo to the exclusion of all else. At another level, however, it appears to signal a marginalization of the graphic designer's role in corporate identity work-a marginalization which will be seen to have problematic and disruptive effects throughout the text of The Corporate Personal- ity. In his splendid tongue-in-cheek summary of the recent history of corporate identity, Peter York writes as follows of the new-found pretensions of post-war British designers: These sixties designers were completely different. They'd ask you what 'your company really did, what its philosophy was and how people related to it, and ask to see the company archives and talk to the senior manage- ment. And they sent memos about it all. You'd think they were management consultants from the way they carried on, not sign-painters.26 The whole of Olins's writings on corporate identity, including the new book, could reasonably be seen as an attempt to blur or to eradicate this kind of hyperbolic distinction between management con- sultant and sign-painter. Although Olins has often drawn attention to the fact that he himself is 'not a designer', even his most management-oriented writings display a strong design bias.27 The dif- ficulties of maintaining this balance are already evident in The Corporate Personality in 1978. The book claims to be aimed primarily at managers but, as Olins no doubt anticipated, it has also been read by very large numbers of graphic design students. Olins's conviction that effective corporate identity should be centred on something more substantial than stylistically fashionable letterheads leads him, in extremis, to make assertions such as the following: 'It is manifestly impossible for a graphic designer by Re-reading The Corporate Personality 279</page><page sequence="6">himself to comprehend clearly the nature of an organization's identity. Too many cultural, organiza- tional, political and psychological factors are involved for which the designer has no training' (p. 157). This is a salutary warning to the over- confident graphic design student, but it seems less certain to inspire confidence in a company manager to whom design consultancy is an unfamiliar idea. Similarly, the book's general mistrust of the visual-a principal theme to be explored in the present re-reading-will be shown to sit a little uneasily with Olins's statement in the preface that 'I am a design consultant and I am therefore particu- larly ... concerned with the way the corporation manifests its identity visually' (p. 9). 'The way the corporation manifests its identity visually': what does The Corporate Personality actually say about this process? Olins's own account of the 'depth' in which he perceives his subject, quoted earlier, leads at the very least to the expectation that the book will explore the strategies by which the designer and his or her associates might seek to translate 'the reality of the corporate personality' into an intelligible visual form, and the ways in which such solutions would avoid the graphic superficiality of the 'house style' approach. In this particular respect the book turns out to be a serious disappointment. The clearest and most detailed account of how Olins sees the equivalence between a company's identity and aims and the design consultancy's visual solution concerns Wolff Olins's corporate identity programme for Bovis, centred on the famous humming-bird logo. Olins explains: One relatively large company that has produced a popular design programme is Bovis. The Bovis company is in civil engineering and construction. It is trying, with who can say how much success, to improve the quality of life on the building site, to make people work more effectively and to co-operate more. Its design scheme, based on a humming- bird, is not simply picked out delicately on an executive's tie; it appears on helmets, working clothes and T-shirts. Bovis site workers put stickers of the humming-bird on their cars, not because they are asked to but because they think they look nice and they want to associate themselves with the company. The design scheme is popular in the sense that people like it. It tries to show without crudely saying so that Bovis does care for the environment, is committed to managing by consent, and wants to be involved with the rest of the world outside the organiza- tion. (p. 77) This account of the design process, which is, remarkably, just about the most detailed to be found anywhere in Olins's published writings to date, is content to limit its analysis to little more than half a dozen words: the design scheme 'tries to show without crudely saying so ...'. Nothing is said of how or why the humming-bird image should be thought to 'show' such things, nor indeed of how any image (let alone a humming-bird!) might be understood to communicate concepts as specific as a commitment to 'managing by consent', and such- like.28 To pose such questions here is to risk 'plunging into the minutiae of letterhead designs', as Olins puts it, and thus failing 'to grasp what corporate identity is really about', but the questions are unavoidable given that The Corporate Personality's account of the Bovis scheme focuses exclusively on the humming-bird logo. In many ways the manner in which the text dimisses these questions of design is no more perfunctory than that to be found in any other account of how design schemes work,29 but the reader expects more here because of Olins's insistent emphasis on identity, as opposed to mere styling. He would certainly have been safer to restrict his comments on Bovis to the claim that 'the design scheme is popular in the sense that people like it', but that of course would have been to say nothing about its success as an identity. Some kind of summary might be useful at this point. In terms of what has so far been established, The Corporate Personality appears to make the following proposals, or to involve the following assumptions. Organizations do have identities, and the responsibility of a good corporate identity programme is truthfully to reflect the reality of the pre-existing identity, as opposed to constructing a visual identity ex nihilo. The ideal is that the organization will look like what it is like (Noyes's philosophy for IBM), though in less successful cases the notion of visual equivalence may lead to no more than a proliferation of 'arrows darting desperately about the place'. The possibility and desirability of visual equivalence is therefore asserted, but the process of translating idea into image is not described. It is, in fact, deemed unworthy of detailed consideration, because the 'graphic design scheme' deals with identity 'at its most superficial level' (p. 212), and corporate identity supersedes or 280 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="7">transcends mere graphics. The contribution of graphic design to corporate identity is thus marginal- ized, as indeed it must be: the book's organizing rhetoric of image versus reality leads to graphics being associated uncomfortably closely with the unfavoured term image. To move on from here it is necessary to consider how the book's oppositional rhetoric is elaborated. Much hinges on Olins's very brief comments on the debasement of modernist design, which he blames in The Corporate Personality for 'all those corporate identity programmes that end up saying "Me big powerful corporation-you small stupid consumer"'. He blames in particular 'the Swiss school of graphic designers and typographers' for a distortion of Bauhaus teachings which has resulted in 'the wholesale rejection of decoration and frivolity in favour of simplicity and sobriety', and which 'has too often meant that straight lines are in and squiggles are out' (p. 191). The bearing of these aesthetic matters on corporate concerns is described thus: The Bauhaus traditions or the corruptions of it in which most successful graphic designers have been trained, and which in unsympathetic hands are so often cold and inhuman, are particularly attractive to the big company that wants to look cool and rational. (p. 191) These comments appear to hark back to a passage from far earlier in the book: If companies share the idea of corporate omniscience, it is also inevitable that they will tend to look similar. To allow humour or whimsy to play a part in the way they look or behave would be to imply that the company had human as opposed to superhuman characteristics ... Since the intention of the corporation is to look superhuman and not human it is inevitable that its visual style will tend to be severe, powerful and withdrawn. The corporation will look classical rather than romantic; cubist rather than surrealist. (p. 46) One American reviewer of The Corporate Personality, focusing on precisely this passage, objected that 'this over-all generalization is simply not accurate, and can be easily refuted'.30 From the point of view of the present re-reading, such appeals to evidence from the world beyond Olins's text are very largely irrelevant. It matters not at all whether Olins's view of 'the corporation' is considerably over-simplified; nor whether his criticisms of Swiss typography are justified; nor even that his apparent support for 'whimsy' and for 'squiggles' was offered, in all probability, with one eye on an emergent post- modernism. What is far more important in this context is the cumulative effect of the series of binary oppositions which Olins sets out in the above passages: superhuman versus human, classical versus romantic, sober versus humorous, and so on. Unstated among all these adjectives is another, controlling, opposition: traditional corporate identity versus Olins's ambitions for corporate identity. The effect of the rhetoric is to mark out a vacant and more loosely defined space in which Olins can operate. Against the cliches of an 'inhuman' corporate modernism connoting severity and power, he seeks to open the possibility of a 'human' corporation which might allow itself a whimsical or even a surrealist look. And this, it seems, is why Olins- despite his admiration for Noyes-can be con- sistently scathing about designers' stocks of ready visual equivalents for corporate cliches, while at the same time declining to explain the relation of the humming-bird image to the Bovis identity. He seems to believe that it is principally within the debased Bauhaus tradition of easy, stereotyped, readerly graphic solutions that visual equivalence has come to seem unproblematic; his own vision is of something more demanding, meaningful, writerly. A cautionary note on method is called for here. While it is by no means surprising that a popular polemical work such as The Corporate Personality should make considerable use of culturally- established binary oppositions, and that it should do so in a manner which associates its writer's position with the favoured term in each of those oppositions, it will be clear by now that the present re-reading is itself employing such oppositions in its attempt to make sense of some of the book's apparent contra- dictions. Readers had best decide for themselves how far the binary structures in the original text can be distinguished from the similar interpretative structures being superimposed on that text by the present writer. In the sections that follow, however, it should become rather easier to identify the imposed structures. It will be argued that much of the text of The Corporate Personality can be under- stood as being organized around two intersecting themes, not named as such by Olins, but which might broadly be characterized as those of system and of Re-reading The Corporate Personality 281</page><page sequence="8">selfhood. It will be shown that neither of them in fact serves Olins ideally as a model for understanding corporate identity, but that between them they shed considerable light on The Corporate Personality's consistent mistrust of the visual. Of System Directly after The Corporate Personality's account of 'the distorted and degenerate Bauhaus tradition', Olins offers a revealing glimpse of how he thinks corporate identity design ought to be approached: Whether the job is large or small, complex or simple, the design consultant needs to develop not just a symbol and a few colours, but a visual system that allows the organiza- tion to express moods and make a series of interrelated statements. (p. 192) The system as a model for corporate identity is an image which recurs throughout the book, even when the word system is not itself used. The fine equi- librium of the successful corporate identity pro- gramme as system is evident in the following observation, for instance: Each time the organization commissions something, whether it is a new building, a new pack or a pair of cufflinks, consideration of the balance of a whole series of factors must take place. Each time one of these factors outbalances any of the others, problems arise. (p. 198) The emphasis on the visual in these last two quotations is perhaps rather misleading, because it seems that for Olins the principal attraction of the systematic is its supersession of the merely cosmetic. This can best be understood through one of Olins's key historical .examples: There is no more dramatic and truly horrific example of corporate identity at its most glittering, powerful and hypnotic than that of the Third Reich ... The Hitler Youth, the Auto Union and Mercedes Benz racing cars, the 1936 Olympic Games, the Autobahnen, the virulently anti- semitic newspaper Volkischer Beobachter and the SS were all different manifestations of the identity programme of the Reich. The whole thing was developed and packaged in brown and black and red and white. It was given a symbol, uniforms and flags. (p. 22) From here he goes on to discuss Speer's role in the co-ordination of the visual aspects of the Nazi identity, especially at the mass rallies, after which he comments: The Third Reich not only used colours, symbols, buildings, uniforms and signs in order to manipulate its identity, but it also went so far as to use body movements-the outstretched arm-and speech-the 'Heil Hitler' greeting. (p. 25) Olins's account of this key example ('corporate identity at its most glittering, powerful and hypnotic') never underestimates nor understates the power of the visual, but its real significance is in its emphasis on the non-visual, or at least the non- pictorial. In the short extracts quoted here Olins draws attention firstly to the social ambitions of the identity, and then to that identity's incorporation of the body. Despite his own political abhorrence of the Third Reich, the ideal identity system he has in mind in The Corporate Personality will be shown also to be one in which bodies are among the units which constitute that system. The interrelation of body and system becomes particularly apparent as Olins moves on to consider the implications of the Third Reich for his own theories: Not many people have had Hitler's opportunities to launch a corporate identity, nor have they seized it with such maniacal enthusiasm. To find another example on such a large scale with such a massive impact both internally and externally is not easy. What we are looking for is a highly institutionalized society with special clothing, ways of speech, body movements, buildings, vehicles, food and way of life. (p. 25) Olins briefly considers the examples of the US Army and the English public school, but settles instead on the United Parcels Service (UPS) of Greenwich, Connecticut, which he describes as 'probably the largest independent parcel moving service in the world', whose 'main competitor is the US Post Office'. The last part of his description of UPS is as follows: UPS had to develop an intricate programme in order to motivate its people and keep their standards up. It practises elitism through a private language and complex symbolism. Delivery trucks or vans, for example, are called package cars. These package cars, and indeed the entire fleet, are specially adapted to suit UPS' requirements. All Steve Baker</page><page sequence="9">vehicles appear in a standard brown livery, the name of the manufacturer is removed and certain modifications are made to most of the bodies to disguise the vehicles' origins. No UPS vehicle has Mack, GMC, Chevrolet, Dodge or Ford badges on it. All UPS package cars are washed daily. According to the American Commercial Car Journal everything is standardized and coded: a flat tyre is a 471, a road service call is a 386. What most transport people would call a break-bulk terminal or major distribution centre is, in the world of UPS, called a hub; what you or I might call a branch is an operating centre and every package is a shipment. The man who drives the package car and delivers the shipment is a parcelman. UPS, with its own language, uniforms and specially adapted vehicles is in many ways a private world, carefully developed with the intention of making people behave predictably. (p. 27) Behaviour is a recurrent theme in The Corporate Personality, indeed one of its principal themes, and it is absolutely central to Olins's conception of corporate identity. Although he states in the preface that the book 'is written for people who are interested in why companies behave in the way they do and about how their behaviour relates to their appearance' (p. 9), it soon becomes clear that he is equally fascinated by (and committed to) the idea or ideal of 'an organization influencing the behaviour and thought processes of those who belong to it' (p. 28). When, in his discussion of Unilever, for instance, he asserts that 'there is a Unilever way of behaving', he is referring not to the organization's behaviour but to the way its 'training systems' and 'indoctrination methods' have shaped its employees, and it is their standardized individual behaviour for which he reserves the title 'Unilever- ness' (p. 30). In the case of UPS it is clear that the parcelman's behaviour is only one aspect of the systematicity of the organization's identity. It has been argued, in books such as Erik Schwimmer's Power, Silence and Secrecy and Berger and Luckmann's The Social Construction of Reality, that jargon and other forms of systematic mystification are typically employed by social and professional groups in order to maintain their internal and external boundaries, their exclus- iveness, their order, and the sense of identity that stems from these;31 the thoroughgoing policy of redescription in the 'private language' of UPS is an unmistakable example of such a procedure. Olins's description of the UPS vehicles offers more evidence of an obsessive systematicity. The removal of the van manufacturers' badges ensures that the smooth and continuous surface of the organization's identity is not punctured by evidence of other identities, even when they are not those of UPS's commercial rivals. The modification of the bodies 'to disguise the vehicles' origins' might even be read as an explana- tion, at one remove, of the systematic modification of the parcelman's body and behaviour. And finally of course, the daily washing of the vehicles seems an attempt to hinder any contamination of the system which might result from contact with the world at large. All in all it is a classic example of what Stephen Bann has termed 'the paranoia of an all- embracing system'.32 This paranoia stems directly from the inevitability of such a system's failure. Designed in isolation, the self-contained and perfect system must engage in a constant but hopeless struggle with the general messiness of the world. Saussure makes the point with reference to artificial languages: Whoever creates a language controls it only so long as it is not in circulation; from the moment when it fulfills its mission and becomes the property of everyone, control is lost. Take Esperanto as an example; if it succeeds, will it escape the inexorable law? Once launched, it is quite likely that Esperanto will enter upon a fully semiological life; it will be transmitted according to laws which have nothing in common with those of its logical creation, and there will be no turning backwards. . . . for the realization of language, a community of speakers is necessary. Contrary to all appearances, language never exists apart from the social fact, for it is a semiological phenomenon. (emphasis added)33 Contrary to the impression given by his use of the UPS example, Olins would in fact almost certainly go along with this, as will now become clear. Given his apparent commitment to the (unsemio- logical) system as a model for corporate identity, Olins is surprisingly frank in The Corporate Personal- ity about the difficulties of controlling such a system. The chapter on 'The personality of the modern industrial corporation' opens with the observation that the corporation 'operates on the implicit assumption that it can control its own destiny'. Olins doubts the legitimacy of this assumption. As he explains: Re-reading The Corporate Personality 283</page><page sequence="10">It ignores the fact that the world is in more or less constant turmoil; that many people, including some of those in important political positions, behave irrationally in their public as well as in their private lives; and that the nature of human society is that it should operate in chaos. (p. 44) He blames 'modish management consultancy tech- niques' for creating the impression that corporate planning will work, but he does accept that his manager-readers will feel duty-bound to maintain this impression: It wouldn't do to let on that the whole apparatus of planning is an elaborate, inefficient and unreliable aid to common sense and that things go wrong more often than not. (p. 45) One of the most surprising aspects of these observa- tions is that Olins does not appear to think that they apply to him, and thus does not realize how close he comes to asserting his own irrelevance and power- lessness. Here, uncharacteristically, he seems to be positing a major and clear-cut distinction between management consultancy and design consultancy, between corporate planning and corporate identity. That there is, in fact, a connection between Olins's conception of each of the two areas can be seen if passages from different parts of The Corporate Personality are juxtaposed. He imaginatively con- structs corporate planning and corporate identity in very similar ways, as systems, and it is therefore not surprising to find that these two hypothesized systems are flawed at the same point: both are merely paper systems. It is in the interstice between the corporate paper system and 'the outside world' that control is lost. This begins to emerge in the passage on corporate planning, where Olins grants that a corporation 'has to plan, however unreliably', but objects that: a plan, however tentative, somehow develops a life of its own when it gets put on paper. It becomes more certain, more comfortingly reliable. (p. 45) He clearly regards the purity and exclusiveness of the system as an illusion, but the collapse of this kind of systematicity or paper life is only described more fully much later in the book, in relation to corporate identity. On this later occasion it is the sham systematicity of the corporate identity manual which is the object of Olins's scorn: What is significant about these design manuals is that for the most part they are written and illustrated in such a way as to bear no relationship to reality at all... The trouble with most design manuals is that in their attempts to enshrine what the corporate identity is all about they almost inevitably emphasize its mechanistic aspects at the expense of its ultimate intention ... If the newly painted vehicle is left to get filthy, if it is badly maintained so that its lights don't work properly, if its driver behaves offensively to other road-users, then the implementation programme might just as well not have taken place. (pp. 204-7) The 'reality' of a corporate identity, its 'ultimate intention' and purpose, is not in this account to change a company's look but to change its behaviour (and that of its employees). If the behaviour fails to change, the new look is a waste of time. Here Olins pits the graphic designer against both the 'reality' of the company's identity and the 'reality' of the world's chaos; the designer loses out both ways because of the very thin-ness of the paper system. (Some chapters earlier, illustrating his point about the superficiality of most design solutions, Olins had invented a hapless graphic designer to whom he gave the name Gavin Thinwall.34) All of this, it seems, is a reflection of Olins's general mistrust of the purely visual, and of his belief that the visual (as opposed to the behavioural) system convinces no one but the complacent designer, especially in the face of larger shifts in attitude in the outside world. Arguing against the Bauhaus style which typifies the corporate look of the multinationals, he writes: There can be no doubt at all that, as concepts like devolution and regionalism become more fashionable all over the world, corporate identity programmes must take this into account. (p. 51) However, in 1978 he could see little evidence that this was happening: So far as the visual identities of companies are concerned, there has for the most part been little change during the past o1 or 15 years. All the traditional aggressive tribal markings with which companies have surrounded them- selves in the past-the war paint they have put on to terrify the outside world-have remained almost untouched. (p. 76) Here reinforcing his opposition of the designer and the world, Olins's somewhat ethnocentric phraseo- 284 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="11">logy seems intended to exemplify his contempt for the naivety of cosmetic identities, no matter how confidently they are worn. It must also be seen as part of a broader attempt by Olins to align himself with the reality (or realism) of 'the world' and its chaos, and against self-deluding and self-conscious design. The idea is returned to in some brief comments on British Rail elsewhere in the book. After praising the complex developing identity of British Rail in the post-Beeching era-the way in which, for instance, it had attempted to come to terms with and incorporate the obstinately Victorian look of King's Cross and St Pancras stations-Olins complains: The British Rail programme is not often shown in books on design-in its application it is too messy, too cluttered, too closely linked with the past, too much of a compromise. In fact, the self-appointed design critics tend not to admire it because it is too much a part of real life. (pp. 104-5) Examples such as this seem indicative of a consider- able but unacknowledged ambivalence in Olins's views, so that The Corporate Personality in fact shifts from praising the strict systematicity of UPS in its early pages to a call, at the very last moment, for a kind of semiological mutability in corporate identity systems: a coming to terms with the rest of the world. In the closing pages the idea of 'the classic house style', where the designers come in, revamp the graphics, and then go away, leaving the new identity to go stale again in a relatively short time, is contrasted with the desirability of a flexible approach which can cope with changes in cultural attitudes, in stylistic fashions, and in the developing structure of the organization itself. The contrast represents for Olins 'the difference between an intelligent under- standing of identity as an active management tool and its passive and mechanistic use' (p. 211). The final chapter of The Corporate Personality closes at this point, leaving certain ragged ends. What seems to have happened is that somewhere along the way the opposition of the behavioural and the visual got tangled up with the opposition of the designer and the world. UPS may have been praised specifically as a behavioural system, but its behavi- oural rigidity was aimed specifically at warding off the world's chaos. In the end, unworldly system and worldly chaos seem to have served Olins almost equally well as means for attacking the visual, but this joint onslaught critically undermines the ability of the system to serve as a model for the understand- ing of corporate identity. Of Selfhood In her detailed analysis of the rhetorical structure of writings on war, Elaine Scarry has noted that accounts of war generally have little to say about individual soldiers' real bodies, but that the body 'is allowed to re-enter' these discourses 'in an only slightly unexpected place': Each of the two armies periodically becomes a single embodied combatant, with the real human body's elemental duality of being at once capable of inflicting injury and of receiving it ... If such descriptions were sustained . .. the text would become a mythology of giants It is precisely because this form of description is a widely shared convention that it need not often be sustained over an entire passage but can instead be invoked with a single word or phrase, the fragments of a story whose outlines are familiar to all.35 Olins, as readers will doubtless be aware, makes considerable use of a body/company analogy which is generally very similar to the body/army analogy described here by Scarry. He takes it for granted that his own readers will understand the convention, and he himself uses it unselfconsciously. There are no statements in The Corporate Personality as overt as the claim in David Bernstein's Company Image and Reality that: I ... believe corporate advertising should treat the company as if it were a person. I'm stuck with this anthropomorphic view of companies. I can't help thinking of them as people.36 The open-ness of Bernstein's admission suggests that his anthropomorphizing of the company, however habitual, is recognized by him to be no more than a sustained analogy. In contrast, Olins's somewhat indiscriminate use of the word reality in relation to the 'corporate personality' suggests that he tends to forget that his particular version of the body/company analogy is of his own construction. Before dealing in more detail with Olins's notion of 'the reality of the corporate personality', it is worth trying to establish what is achieved through the use of a body/company analogy. Despite Re-reading The Corporate Personality 285</page><page sequence="12">Bernstein's espousal of anthropomorphism, his own analogies tend to be more architectural: he com- plains about corporate identities which are 'no more than a fresh coat of paint on a rickety building', and advises that 'if all a company wants is a fagade it doesn't have to pay for the laying of foundations', or elsewhere that 'painting the privy won't cure the plumbing'.37 More positively, Elaine Scarry suggests that the body/army analogy and related analogies have 'the virtue of bestowing visibility on events which, because of their scale, are wholly outside visual experience'.38 Visibility, however, is hardly a sufficient justification of the symbolic body- Bernstein's architectural analogies could equally be said to bestow visibility. To visibility must be added the sense of motivation and appropriateness behind the various body analogies. As Roy Baumeister argues in his recent book on identity, 'the continuity of the physical body is an important source of the sense of identity'.39 Although what Baumeister has in mind is the body's importance for the embodied individual, his point is highly pertinent to the present discussion. Groupings such as the nation, the army and the commercial company all lack the apparent unity and continuity of the body. What they therefore gain in taking the body as a metaphor or analogy (and what equivalent architectural analogies cannot provide) is precisely Baumeister's 'sense of identity'. The Corporate Personality's own version of the commonplace anthropomorphic view of corporate identity is centred principally around an opposition which, in its baldest form, might be stated as that of surface versus depth. In the book's postscript, as already noted, Olins suggests that his definitions relate 'to the depth in which the subject is perceived': the idea of a house style, a graphic design scheme concerned only with the visual, is criticized as 'superficial' and as 'a cosmetic job'; it is contrasted with the 'profound' and often invisible corporate personality, which is 'the soul, the persona, the spirit, the culture of the organization', and which above all is a 'reality' (p. 212). These ideas are brought together in a concise form in the postscript, but earlier chapters of the book had already advised companies of the need for 'a real self knowledge and a genuine and deep corporate identity' (p. 116), and had recommended that 'visual identity' should be 'part of the deeper identity of the group, the outward sign of inward commitment, serving to remind it of its real purpose' (p. 15). Even from these brief quotations it is clear that The Corporate Personality is employing a series of oppositions, each of which reinforces and elaborates upon the rest: the inner and the outer, the profound and the superficial, the real and the apparent, the metaphysical and the physical. The company is thus presented not merely as a symbolic body but as a fully-formed symbolic self, with all the complexity of a human 'self'. The structure of this company self reflects what The Corporate Personality appears to propose-and what a large number of its intended readers could no doubt be expected to accept-as the absolute nature of the human self.40 It reflects, in other words, the current (though long-standing) popular Western conception of selfhood. The historical specificity of this universalized notion has been considered in Roy Baumeister's Identity: Cultural Change and the Struggle for Self. Despite itself being something of a popularizing synthesis of historical evidence on these matters,41 Baumeister's account provides a useful background for understanding Olins's views on identity in general and on visual identity in particular. Baumeister notes that the modern understanding of identity has come to rely heavily on the odd spatial metaphor of the 'inner' self, which is often regarded not as a metaphor but as a literal fact. and he suggests this origin for the idea: It seems likely that our belief in an inner self can be traced to the medieval Christian concept of soul. The earliest notions of soul did not distinguish it very carefully from the body, but that distinction was accepted by the Middle Ages. By the early Middle Ages, people believed that an invisible, nonphysical entity was an important part of each person's existence. By the late Middle Ages, the concept of soul had evolved into a rather good forerunner of the concept of inner self.42 Baumeister argues that: the next big step toward the modern inner self occurred during the sixteenth century. The popular discovery of that period was that visible phenomena often disguised or concealed underlying realities that were quite different from the visible phenomena. The popular opposition of the 'real' and the apparent, which has been seen to play a crucial role 286 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="13">in Olins's anthropomorphic account of company identity, is explored in more detail elsewhere in Baumeister's book under the heading 'The hidden self'. There it is noted that it was also in the sixteenth century that the concept of the person came to include having a kind of internal space and self not directly visible in social actions and roles ... People began to regard the self as a hidden entity that might or might not be reflected in outward acts. Baumeister explains the evolution of the concept as follows: Obviously, this idea did not appear out of a void. The contrast between the visible phenomena and underlying or hidden realities is an old one in Western thought, dating back at least to Plato. Christianity made extensive use of that distinction, and medieval Christian thought regarded events in this world as imitations of the ultimate realities of God's divine plan and of scriptural truth. This medieval 'figural' view of earthly reality began to die out in the sixteenth century ... but the distinction between appearance and reality survived and took on a new significance. Indeed, it is fair to describe the sixteenth century as obsessed with contrasts between appearances and underlying realities. The philosophy, politics, and literature of that era ... show tireless concern and preoccupation with that issue. Applied to the individual, these developments began to make identity seem problematic. They led to an atmosphere in which 'necessity dictated distrust of the "outer" self, and the "inner" self was born'.43 The gradual filtering of this mixture of Plato, the Bible, Shakespeare, and so on leads to the popular modern conception of the self which Olins bestows upon the anthropomorphized company. It seems highly likely that the roots of Olins's general mistrust of the visual can be found in this conception of the self. Baumeister's account will also provide a useful perspective from which to begin to consider Olins's notion of the 'corporate soul'. In a paper published in 1979 Olins described the kind of identity problems likely to be faced by particularly large organizations: The colossus company finds itself with a heaving mass of companies, brands and products ... It may realize that as things stand it has no clear personality itself-that nobody quite knows who it is and what it stands for ... In the end the colossus has to take action-to rediscover its own identity. Somewhere beneath all those acquisitions there must be a corporate soul, some goals, some intentions, a way of behaving, of doing things ... It is these standards which have to be unearthed and then made visible . . .44 In a similar vein, Chapter 7 of The Corporate Personality is given the title 'The search for the corporate soul'. This language of 'searching' and 'unearthing' would be likely to be seen by Bau- meister as having its origins in Puritan attitudes to the self: The Puritans regarded the soul as fixed and unchangeable in its essential properties. The condition of the soul was thus something you could learn or discover but could not create or modify. Self-knowledge came to be conceptual- ized in metaphoric terms of search and discovery- searching for something that is already there, has always been there. Today we still think that way about inner selves.45 Although this seems to lend support to the view that this popular version of the self is the basis for Olins's body/company analogy, Olins's particular concep- tion of the corporate soul is complicated by two other factors. The first is his inconsistent terminology; the second is the role he assigns to a company's founder. Taking the terminology first, readers will probably have noticed that in the short extract from Olins's 1979 paper quoted above, the terms personality, identity and soul were used in an apparently interchangeable manner: the company presently 'has no clear personality'; it must therefore 'rediscover its own identity'; because beneath everything 'there must be a corporate soul'. The Corporate Personality displays a similar terminological inexactitude, but there Olins's precise position becomes even harder to ascertain because of his views on the founder's relation to the company. The early chapters pose no real problem. The company's identity (or personal- ity, or soul) is generally described in terms that conform to Baumeister's account of the Puritan con- ception of soul-as something, in other words, that the design consultant discovers rather than creates. It is simply there, whether or not it happens to be 'clear' at any given moment. When the founder's role comes to be discussed in detail in the chapter on 'The search for the corporate soul', however, this position is modified signific- antly. The modifications are summarized in the chapter's short opening abstract: In the first or heroic period of a company's development the personality of its founder gives it its identity. In the Re-reading The Corporate Personality 287</page><page sequence="14">second or technocratic phase the carefully cultivated and developed corporate identity is the major element that provides this link. It becomes the substitute for the personality of the entrepreneur. (p. 78) From this it seems that at the start a company does not have its own autonomous identity; the identity of the founder is somehow metonymically imposed on the whole organization, impressed on it. (Later in the chapter, on page 84, Olins quotes with approval Anthony Sampson's view that despite the current internationalism of the world's main oil companies, 'each still bore the marks of its own history, and lived partly in "the long shadow of its founder"'.) There is thus, in Olins's words, a 'link' between the founder's personality and what is subsequently perceived to be the company's identity. Once the founder has gone, however, far from the company having established a natural or inherent identity or personality (as might be supposed from earlier chapters) it is in fact left with a lack, which is then filled by a 'carefully cultivated' corporate identity programme. The role of the designer or design consultant is thus safeguarded here, as the skilful cultivator of this identity. This programme, however, is a mere 'substitute' for the real personality of the founder who, of course, also represented the source of the body/company analogy. These impressions seem to be confirmed in The Corporate Personality's subsequent example of Jack Cohen's Tesco stores, which in the 196os 'reflected his background and early years of training as a street trader' (p. 79). Olins's account of their identity concludes as follows: The Tesco style, which was idiosyncratic, unpolished and owed nothing to professionals ... made its crude but powerful appeal because it was seen to have a genuine character, a genuine corporate identity, which emanated, of course, from its founder. Today the business has become much too big for one man to handle, Jack Cohen has now retired as Sir John and the technocrats have moved in. The old rugged Tesco personality has disappeared and Tesco is becoming just like any other supermarket chain. Soon it will be so bland that it may need some professionals to come in and give it a corporate identity. (p. 80) Once the influence of the founder's personality 'has disappeared', then, Olins seems to suggest that professional design or management consultants are likely to be called in, to 'give' the company an identity which they as outsiders have invented or constructed. However, as he goes on to insist: This is not to say that it no longer has a personality, or that the corporate identity of a company in a technological phase of development is a wholly artificial creation. What it does mean, however, is that such a corporate identity is less natural and intuitive; it is more carefully contrived and developed. (p. 81) Even in this qualified form, this is the most explicit admission anywhere in The Corporate Identity that the design consultant's work is not entirely a matter of reflecting a 'natural' inner identity. This apparent shift in attitude is not sustained, however. On the very next page Olins reverts to the view that a company's 'inner' identity is natural and intrinsic, stating that 'if it is to mean anything, the corporate identity must say something about the organization that is intrinsic to its personality' (p. 82). At this particular point in his chapter on the corporate soul Olins seems to realize that he has talked himself into a very confusing and ultimately unworkable model of identity, and to try to back away from it. It is as though the correspondences between the 'real' body of the founder and the symbolic body of the company will not stand up to a too detailed scrutiny. For all the influence of the founder's 'personality' and 'identity' on those of the company, no reference is ever made to the founder's 'soul'. The word soul is not in fact used at all until later in the chapter, by which time discussion of the founder's role has been dispensed with and Olins has reverted to the simpler and safer model of the company's 'intrinsic' personality. Thus he is able to claim of organizations which are 'not dominated by a person but by an idea, an obsession' (p. 87) that, for instance, 'the soul of Daimler-Benz lies in its technological obsession' (p. 82), 'the soul of Rank Xerox is in selling' (p. 83), and so on. It seems, ironically, that despite the founder's prompting of the body/company analogy, the analogy can only be sustained by the expulsion of the founder from the text. To Differ A re-reading of The Corporate Personality was justified at the outset as a means of investigating the 288 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="15">difficulties of writing about exactly how notions of identity are given visual form by designers. Today, at a moment when Olins's influence on our thinking about the subject may be reinforced by the arrival of his new book, Corporate Identity, the alternatives which The Corporate Personality has now been shown not to have explored may be the ones which most deserve attention. If an organization was not described in anthropo- morphic terms, and if its 'behaviour' was not seen principally as the result of an internal systematicity, and if its visual imagery was not regarded as the natural manifestation of an innate identity, how would our understanding of the designer's work change? If, additionally, the idea of identity were to be externalized, and it was seen principally as a matter of dealing with differences rather than essences, what would be the potential for a theory of corporate differentiation rather than of corporate identity? These two questions can be taken together, though firstly it is necessary to consider how far Olins himself has gone in this direction. Throughout his writings Olins has given some small credence to the notion of differentiation. In his 1979 paper 'Corporate Identity' he described 'one of the aims of the corporate identity business' as being to help organizations to 'express' the difference between themselves and their competitors, or even, more controversially in his view, 'to create such a difference' if none seemed to exist.46 The idea is restated most clearly in a 1986 article in Campaign where, as in other of Olins's writings from the mid- 1980s, it appears to be the counterpart to an increasing confidence in the graphic designer's role in corporate identity. Olins writes in the Campaign piece that 'in an increasingly competitive environ- ment, only those companies which successfully differentiate themselves ... will survive'; that it is design which 'is almost always the most significant way in which the organization can differentiate itself in the market-place'; and that 'differentiation is the inevitable next step in corporate development'.47 The notion of corporate differentiation does play a part in the new Corporate Identity (where it is generally discussed in terms of 'positioning' within the market-place), but only as one of corporate identity's several priorities. There are two principal reasons for the limited influence of this notion within Olins's writings, despite the promise of the 1986 Campaign article. One is that the wide-ranging text of The Corporate Personality and the popular notions of individual identity on which it drew offered no real supporting structure for a popularly intelligible theory of differential identity. The other is that Olins has always been particularly concerned with the internal audience for corporate identity programmes, the organization's members or employees, for whom the sense of identity-as-belonging is the crucial issue. The fact that Olins's writings have been much influenced by this inward-looking priority, however, does not mean that a broader-based theory of visual identity need conform to it. It can in fact be argued that at theoretical, at historical, and at practical levels there are positive advantages to an outward-looking notion of corporate differentiation. In terms of theory, such a notion would be broadly compatible with much semiological and post- semiological writing, particularly that which acknowledges its debt to Hegel, where there is a recognition that the terms identity and difference are interdependent. Saussure spoke of 'differences and identities, the former being only the counterpart of the latter', and Julia Kristeva has more recently described the origin of 'the striving for identity, a difference' in terms of 'the immemorial violence with which a body is parted from another in order to be'.48 In both cases there is an echo of Hegel's view (expressed here in Peter Singer's words) that self- consciousness 'cannot exist in isolation. If conscious- ness is to form a proper picture of itself, it needs some contrast. It requires an object from which to differentiate itself'.49 In works such as Roland Barthes's 'The death of the author' or Foucault's 'What is an author?',50 of course, this same area of theory has also mounted a sustained critique of precisely the kind of individualism that The Corporate Personality takes for granted in its concern with the truth of an inner self. In historical terms, an emphasis on differentiation is likely to lead to a very different and far richer potential history of corporate identity design. Such a history would need to be as attentive to the construction of (frequently hostile) images of 'others' as it would to corporate identity's exclusive concern with the construction of idealized images of self. Corporate identity would thus, rightly, be more likely to be viewed as inseparable from the larger Re-reading The Corporate Personality 289</page><page sequence="16">history of visual identity as a whole, instead of merely as the frequently marginalized visual bit of the modern corporation's concerns. Olins has, in fact, gone further than most writers in this direction, but his often imaginative comparisons have still concerned only manifestations of selfhood. What is needed is a wider recognition that corporate identity design is as dependent on the conventions and subtleties of hostile image-making in, say, wartime propaganda imagery or contemporary party-political advertising as it is on those of what Allan Sekula has called 'the ceremonial presentation of the bourgeois self'.51 Coming to regard identity as differential would also have positive practical implications. One is that it should help to eliminate the mystification of the design process in design writing, by focusing on an identity programme's public reception rather than on its imaginary private origin. In place of heroic descriptions of design teams trawling the company archives for the hidden heart of the organization and searching for the symbol that would magically express it, designers would be understood to be trading in visual connotations with the public. It would no longer be a question of how successfully the designer had translated the organization's unique and innate identity into visual form, which is what The Corporate Personality seems to ask; but rather one of how skilfully the designer had worked with current public perceptions of what different images and styles connote. It might well mean reviewing all those 'arrows darting desperately about the place' in an altogether more positive light.52 As in so many other circumstances, it can only be regretted that Barthes's proposed Compila- tion of Visual Stereotypes was never produced. Even without it, however, it is clearly going to be easier to analyse what design does and how design com- municates if it is conceived in these terms. If such a proposal seems to call into question the whole idea of the designer's 'creativity', all to the good; it certainly doesn't demean the designer's skills or doubt the importance of design. There is, in my opinion at least, another practical advantage to such a view in an age when the effectiveness of visual communication is acknow- ledged on all sides but when its corporate use predominantly supports the status quo. If the imagery of corporate identity programmes comes to be more widely understood to depend on differential or oppositional meanings, it becomes altogether easier to imagine how sophisticated and persuasive design schemes might effectively be countered visually by those who oppose them. At a time when corporate identity is being seen as the solution to projects as bizarre and contentious as the creation of a 'caring, customer-oriented face' for nuclear power stations,53 this is a matter of no small importance.

I am particularly grateful to Wally Olins for allowing me to read the text of Corporate Identity during the preparation of this article in February 1989, several months prior to the book's publication. 4 See Contemporary Designers, edited by Ann Lee Morgan, Macmillan, London, 1984, p. 632; Jeremy Myerson, 'Marketing monitor', Design Week, 18 November 1988, p. 22; and the 'Corporate Identity Special Issue' of Design Week, 28 October 1988, pp. 16 and 21. 5 See Jeremy Myerson, 'Names and faces', Design Week, 28 October 1988, p. 16; and Wally Olins, 'Getting new business', Designer, December 1981, pp. 16-17. 6 The two Wolff Olins Guides, sponsored by the Design Council, were published in 1984 and 1985 respectively. Olins is quoted as describing his new book as 'a magnum opus on corporate identity' in the unsigned news item 'Olins takes up new design chair at Imperial College' in Design Week, 22 January 1988, p. 4. 7 See David Bernstein, Company Image and Reality: A Critique of Corporate Communications, Holt, Rinehart &amp; 290 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="17">Winston, Eastbourne, 1984, 'Acknowledgments'; and Forty, op. cit., p. 223. 8 See, for instance, Nicholas Jenkins, 'Approaching an identity crisis', Design Week, 26 February 1988, p. 20, and 'One from the art', Design Week, 28 October 1988, p. 26; Jeremy Myerson, 'Plain speaker' (interview with Alan Siegel), Design Week, 9 September 1988, p. 12; and Alan Siegel, 'Soldiers of fortune', Design Week, 28 October 1988, pp. 18-19. 9 Siegel's book was still unpublished at the time of writing this article. In conversation in February 1989, Olins told me that he considered his and Siegel's attitudes to corporate identity to be very different, but this is not evident from the items cited in the previous note. 10 See Rick Poynor, 'Identity's new image', Designers' Journal, no. 24, 1987, pp. 36-44. iI Christopher Prendergast, 'Flaubert: Writing and negativity', Novel, 8, no. 3, 1975, pp. 197-213 (p. 206). 12 Olins, The Corporate Personality, p. 19. 13 These last three options are suggested respectively in Wally Olins, 'Corporate identity-the myth and the reality', Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, no. 5272, 1979, pp. 208-23 (p. 209); Forty, op. cit., p. 222; and Jenkins, 'One from the art', p. 26. The opening chapter of Olins's new Corporate Identity, called 'The invention of tradition', suggests still further possibilities. 14 Jacques Derrida, Margins of Philosophy, translated by Alan Bass, Harvester, Brighton, 1982, p. 135. 15 Michel Foucault, 'My body, this paper, this fire', translated by Geoff Bennington, Oxford Literary Review, vol. 4, no. 1, 1979, pp. 9-28 (p. 27). Foucault is here offering his opinion of Derrida's methodology, in response to Derrida's criticism of his. 16 Regular readers of the British design press will be aware of examples of Wolff Olins's involvement in all of these areas in recent times. 17 Peter Gorb, 'Using design', in Living by Design: The Pentagram Design Partnership, edited by Peter Gorb, Lund Humphries, London, 1978, p. 9. 18 See Peter York, Modern Times, Heinemann, London, 1984, p. 35; and Gaynor Williams, 'Insurance revamp by Lewis Moberly', Design Week, 16 December 1988, P 5. 19 See Forty, op. cit., p. 238; and Meggs, op. cit., p. 430. 20 Olins, The Corporate Personality, p. 188. (Further page references to The Corporate Personality are generally given in the text.) The irony of Wolff Olins's own subsequent use of precisely such an onward-and- upward arrow in its logo for the Department of Trade and Industry is noted in Roger Cooper's letter in Design Week, 29 January 1988, p. io. 21 See Wally Olins, 'Over America 2: Masters, Heavies and The Rest', Design, no. 343, 1977, pp. 36-43; and The Corporate Personality, passim. 22 Olins, The Corporate Personality, p. 159. 23 See James Pilditch, Communication by Design: A Study in Corporate Identity, McGraw-Hill, Maidenhead, 1970, p. 57; Wally Olins, 'Corporate identity', in Design History: Past, Process, Product, edited by Terry Bishop, Design Council, London, 1979, pp. 7-10 (p. 8); and Bernstein, op. cit., p. 11. (Bernstein's preface in fact opens with the assertion that 'image is a reality', but he is clearly aware that in setting out to argue this case he is going against the popular consensus.) 24 See F. H. K. Henrion, quoted in Pilditch, op. cit., p. 12; and Jenkins, 'Approaching an identity crisis', p. 20. 25 Olins, 'Corporate identity-the myth and the reality', p. 209. 26 York, op. cit., p. 34. 27 See for instance the following, all written by Olins: 'Management by design', Management Today, February 1985, pp. 62-9; The Wolff Olins Guide to Design Manage- ment; and 'Design and the organization', Designer, February 1985, pp. 15-19. 28 For a rather more detailed assessment of the logic of the humming-bird image, see Wally Olins's 'The invention of tradition at Bovis', forthcoming in the Journal of Design History. Also see note 52 below. 29 See for instance the explanation of the Woolmark and other logos in ch. 5 of Pilditch's Communication by Design; and the explanation of the Lucas identity in Gorb's Living by Design, especially p. 23. 30 John Young, review of The Corporate Personality, Industrial Design Magazine, vol. 27, no. 3, 1980, 58-9 (P. 59). 31 See Erik Schwimmer, Power, Silence and Secrecy, Toronto Semiotic Circle, Toronto, 1980, pp. 6 and 20; and Peter L.

Thinwall, as readers may by now be aware, takes on a very different and far more prominent role in the 1989 Corporate Identity. 35 Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1985, p. 70. 36 Bernstein, op. cit., p. 13. 37 Ibid., pp. 129, 159 and 241. Re-reading The Corporate Personality 291</page><page sequence="18">38 Scarry, op. cit., p. 71. 39 Roy F. Baumeister, Identity: Cultural Change and the Struggle for Self, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1986, p. 16. 40 My claim here is only that this is the position presented in the text of The Corporate Personality, and not that it necessarily represents Olins's own past or present views on identity. 41 It is necessary to emphasize that this concise and generally rather useful book does need to be treated with some caution. This is not only because Bau- meister, as an experimental psychologist, has drawn on historical and literary evidence which, as he acknow- ledges, 'lay outside my field', and that he has therefore had 'to rely on secondary sources' (p. viii), but also because the book displays some disturbing signs of historical carelessness: at one point, for instance, it looks as though Baumeister believes Berkeley to have been a sixteenth-century philosopher (p. 36). 42 Baumeister, op. cit., p. 257. 43 Ibid., pp. 258, 36 and 144. 44 Olins, 'Corporate identity-the myth and the reality', p. 217. 45 Baumeister, op. cit., p. 259. 46 Olins, 'Corporate identity', p. 7. 47 Wally Olins, 'How design can breathe new life into yesterday's rebels', Campaign, 12 September 1986, PP. 34-5 (p. 34). 48 See de Saussure, op. cit., p. 108; and Julia Kristeva, Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, translated by Leon S. Roudiez, Columbia University Press, New York, 1982, pp. 82 and 1o. 49 Peter Singer, Hegel, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1983, p. 57. 50 See Roland Barthes, 'The death of the author', in his Image-Music-Text, translated by Stephen Heath, Fontana, London, 1977; and Michel Foucault, 'What is an author?', in Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post- Structuralist Criticism, edited by Josue V. Harari, Methuen, London, 1979, pp. 141-60. 51 Allan Sekula, 'The body and the archive', October, no. 39, 1986, pp. 3-64 (p. 6). 52 Olins's own current stance on such matters is rather difficult to ascertain. On the one hand, delivering his paper on 'The invention of tradition at Bovis' at Middlesex Polytechnic on 7 February 1989, he explained the humming-bird image almost entirely in terms of public perceptions of its connotations. On the other hand, Corporate Identity is rich in references to the 'magic' of symbolism and to the transcendent creativity of the imaginative design solution. 53 Wolff Olins's winning of the corporate identity contract for National Power, the division of the privatized CEGB which is responsible for nuclear power stations in England and Wales, was reported in these terms in Beverley Cohen's 'Power dressing by Wolff Olins', Design Week, 27 January 1989, p. 5. 292 Steve Baker</page></plain_text>
