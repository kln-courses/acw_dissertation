<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Celts in Archaeology (Compiled by members of the editorial board). Though archaeologists have without difficulty identified the remains of developed Celtic culture, the problem of Celtic origins and early movements is still obscure, for it belongs to a time when the excavator cannot seek assistance from literary records, always the easiest source for political history. It seems probable that Celtic culture remained undifferentiated until a late date; down to 500 b.c. it is hard to distinguish as Celtic, objects belonging to the prehistoric sequence of central Europe. The old Celtic languages were fairly pure members of the Indo-European family, preserving much of the ancient grammar and vocabulary. This implies that, in general, their speakers migrated in considerable bodies, without coming into contact with cultures markedly more developed than their own. Anthropologists might to-day hesitate to assume that the Indo-European languages descend from a single parent-speech; but the close local interaction of the languages formerly spoken in central Europe cannot be doubted. One characteristic of this group is the change from the original "qw" to "p," a modification which occurred in Celtic, Italic,! Greek, and rarely in Germanic. It has been suggested that it was 1. This name is applied to the prehistoric dialects of Italy, of which the majority belong to the p-group, and Latin is the only important member of the q-group.</page><page sequence="2">138 The Celts in Archeology due to the absorption by the speakers of these languages of a people with physical characters, such as a long upper lip, which made it difficult for them to pronounce "qw." This change2 was probably taking place in the second millennium B.c.r and sounds akin to the primitive "qw" survived in those dialects which were in general farthest removed from the homeland, for instance Irish, Latin, and Ionic Greek (see fig. 1). Sometimes invading aristocracies have spread in such small bodies that archaeology can detect their traces only in the introduction of new weapons, new ornaments, or similar trifles.3 For the most part they seem to have been absorbed by the people whom they overran, and often they brought with them no women, and so imposed no change upon domestic arts, such as pottery-manufacture. So superficial an invasion is however likely to cause profound modifications in the invaders' language, as was the cause with Hittite, which, though structurally Indo-European, was in vocabulary almost entirely Asianic; or indeed, the new language will die out, as seems to have been the fate of the intrusive p-Celtic languages in the Irish iron-age. The main Celtic invasions must have been more thorough; but near the periphery of Celtic expansion admixture was apparent, so that we hear of Celt-iberians in Spain, of Galatians much influenced by the Greco Asianic culture of Anatolia. After the spread of the Italic peoples into Italy, towards the close of the second millennium b.c., the Celts did not immediately emerge as the dominant group in central Europe. The most vigorous people at this time were probably the Illyrians, though at most a fragment of their speech survives to-day, as an element in Albanian. They were responsible for the type-settlement of the earliest iron-age of middle Europe, Hallstatt in a valley of the Austrian Tyrol. They held the whole middle Danube valley, extending as far north as Bohemia and probably as the Lausitz region of Saxony; to the south-east they marched with the Macedonian kingdom, and the nomenclature and toponymy of both Macedonia and Greece have been claimed to have contained Illyrian elements.* To the west, they entered Italy probably later than the Italic peoples, and populated Venetia and most of the 2. This modification may be illustrated by the following examples, supplied by Mr, H. O. Belfour :? (a) The relative particle, Irish "cia," Latin "quo," becomes in Welsh (p-Celtic) "pwy," in Osco-Umbrian (p-Italic) "paam" (corresponding to Latin "quam"). (b) Cp. Irish "creth" (poetry) with Welsh "prydydd" (poet). (c) In Greek dialects "qw" before back-vowels or consonants becomes "p," e.g., relative particle "pos"; before front-vowels the "p" becomes- "t," except in Aeolic, e.g., "tessares," Aeolic "pissures" ( = four), corresponding to Latin "quattuor," Irish "ceitre." But in Ionic Greek we find a few words with "k" for "qw," e.g., relative particle "kos" for "pos." (d) In Germanic "qw" very rarely has become "f." 3. For instance, the literary evidence gives reason for assuming an invasion of Greece about 1260 b.c. ; but the sole change evinced by the material-remains of this period is the introduction of a new type of sword. 4.

The Raeti of the central Alpine region were probably Illyrian, and Illyrian bands may have spread even farther west. Above all, they were in close contact with, if not akin to, the population of Hungary, where in the later bronze-age was evolved a type of slashing sword so superior to any weapon already in use, that invaders would be able with its aid to overrun Europe (fig. 2a). From about 1200 b.c. there spread over central and western Europe from the Lausitz the custom of burial in flat cemeteries or urnfields, associated with leaf shaped swords from farther south. Elements of this culture extend to the Black Sea, the Vistula, southern Scandinavia, France, Spain, and England.5 On one view, the developing Celtic civilisation may have been stimulated by these urnfield intruders, expanding along the valleys, and fusing in the mountainous country of southern Germany with an upland folk who buried in tumuli. During their dispersal, the Celts may have contained Illyrian elements, though Illyrian influence on the formation of Celtic languages is doubtful, and the attempts to find Illyrian traces in west European place-names have not been very successful. It is difficult to identify the various archaeological invasions with the Celtic groups which we know linguistically or by tradition. The Celtic intrusions cannot be considered as of a simple character. Their tribes were restless, independent units, who crossed and passed each other; literary sources show them undertaking emigrations on a scale and for distances which would confuse the archaeological record,6 were we dependent on it alone. Thus the absence of intermediate links does not at this period disprove the derivation of one culture from another widely separated from it. Most archaeologists agree that the first Celtic invaders reached south-eastern England from the lower Rhineland about 1000 b.c. The attempts to place their arrival earlier than this have not succeeded. The invasion was complex, and the first immigrants may have been refugees from the thrust of the urnfield-people into western Europe. Rather later are found in Great Britain urnfield-cemeteries of continental character. The newcomers brought a fresh cultural repertory. They introduced large urns, mainly of bucket-shape, and decorated with applied bands of clay with finger-tip ornament (fig. 3). Their originality in bronze-types is more significant. They used leaf-shaped spears and slashing swords, socketed axes, tanged sickles, and a wide range of types which have no roots in Britain and are clearly intrusive (fig. 2b). Founders' hoards become common, showing that metal working had been placed on an industrial basis and was practised by probably 5.

Cp. especially the migration of the Cimbri between 115 and 100 b.c., described in detail in Cambridge Ancient History, ix. ch. 3. They started from Jutland, moved up the Elbe to Bohemia, and then across Hungary to Slavonia. Thence they turned backwards into Austria, and round the north side of the Alps into central France. Marching down the Rhone, they threatened Italy, but finally decided to ravage Spain. They returned thence into France, and finally, after again skirting the Alps, they invaded Italy via the Brenner, and were exterminated at Vercellae in Piedmont.</page><page sequence="5">The Celts in Archaeology HI itinerant craftsmen. Iron they did not use; the later movements may have known it on the Continent, but iron-working did not start in England until 600-500 b.c., and its spread in the ancient world was normally due to culture-contact rather than to invasion. The intrusive culture did not however extinguish its predecessor, even in lowland Britain, where the newcomers often used pre-existing tumuli for burial. In the north and west a fusion took place, and the infiltration of new blood may have been limited to an invading military aristocracy. The late bronze-age encrusted urn? developed in this region from the native food-vessel, though urn-fields, typical of the invaders, have occasionally been found. . Recent research has shown the involved character of these movements into England, which continued over several centuries.8 They may be attributable to successive arrivals of refugees, yielding to the pressure of the urnfield-folk expanding westwards to the Rhine; sometimes also urnfield-leaders may have collected and led overseas bands of older inhabitants. We have as yet little evidence in Ireland of the new pottery-styles which characterise the main late bronze-age invasions of Great Britain. There are, however, found urns of several varieties, with overhanging rim, cordoned and encrusted (fig. 2c), of which the last at any rate is indubitably a development from the native north British food-vessel under the influence of intrusive pottery-styles making their way through lowland Britain. At the same time there spread over the uplands the immensely superior new bronze weapons and tools. How far this dispersion of new forms was due to the domination of Celtic overlords must remain a matter for confirmation, but it was doubtless accompanied by the Celtic tongue. At a time which can be reasonably dated between 900 and 700 b.c., this urn-and sword complex entered Ireland through Ulster. This marked, we believe, the introduction of the Gaelic tongue into Ireland. Native craftsmanship was refertilised, and there arose a wealth of original types of tool, weapon, and pottery, which are most common in Ulster and were slowly diffused through the rest of Ireland during the protracted Irish bronze-age. This is the first immigration attested by archaeology as on a sufficient scale to warrant its identification with the advent of the Celts. Some indeed have associated Gaelic speech with the iron-using culture of the next invaders of Britain, about 500 b.c. ; but these did not reach Ireland, and the evidence from Great Britain and the Continent is against such a supposition. The urnfield-dispersions and the disturbances which they caused represent a preliminary series of movements, which were repeated at various times during the first millennium b.c. by tribes which can with certainty be called p-Celtic. From the fourth century Celtic bands established themselves in parts of the lower Danube basin, and as far as central Asia Minor. At an even earlier date, Celts had been conquering north Italy, while their penetration into central Gaul and Spain goes 7. Fox, A.J., vii (1927), p. 115. See fig. 2c. 8. Cp. Hawkes, P.P.5.

About 500. b.c., some of them spread from the Rhin eland over south-eastern England, and rather later another group, whose pottery is characterised by fantastic curvilinear ornament, occupied the western and northern districts of Britain (fig. 1). This ornament, to which the word "Celtic" is generally applied, is thought to have been inspired by Greek influences from the west Mediterranean colonies. These movements affected Ireland little. Ancient geographers locate there tribes whose affinities are with the iron-age-B people9 of Britain?the Brigantes of Waterford whose main settlement was in Yorkshire, the Domnain on various points round the coast who seem connected with the Dumnonii of Devonshire. But we do not know whether these peoples, especially the former, reached Ireland before the 9. I.e., the occupants of the western and northern districts, referred to above. Fig. 3.

Nor is the culture of the early Brythonic Celts found in Ireland. The large contour-forts, enclosing several acres and normally situated on hilltops (fig. 4), are replaced by small circular raths, which, whatever their origin, do not seem akin. They imply a different social system, in which the family-holding is predominant, and there is no incipient urge towards forming a tribal centre or a city. The typical Celtic fields of the uplands of southern England, indicating intensive if primitive agriculture (fig. 4), have not been recognised in prehistoric Ireland ;10 and the modern Irish field-system, which resembles their small enclosures, seems of recent date. Probably agriculture was subsidiary to herding in ancient Ireland, and even in the sixteenth century the principal economic wealth consisted of cattle. Objects of the developed Celtic style, the massive iron swords, the brooches, and spear-heads are rare in Ireland. The elaborate curvilinear decoration of early and middle Celtic artll is conspicuous by its absence, apart from the remarkable collection from Lisnacrogher (Co. Antrim) (fig. 5), and a few rather late objects which may be imports or products of refugees from the Roman conquest of Gaul and Britain. Such objects, moreover, are commonest in Ulster and Leinster. Thus the ancient civilisation of Ireland survived, and Ireland maintained little, if any, contact with the centres of Celtic culture on the Continent. During the last centuries b.c. the Belgic culture had grown up in northern Gaul. This is said to have been a mixture of Gallic and Germanic elements, and its formation was due to the pressure of Germans from north-east of the Rhine. The name can be traced back to 300 b.c. In speech the Belgae were Brythonic, like the other Gauls, but their tribes were less civilised, partly as being more remote from Mediterranean influences. Other cultural differences which they exhibit are of a local character. They may have developed the wheeled plough, which would enable them to cultivate heavy lowland soils; they seemed to have used a terrace field system, which was probably originated by the Germans. A few Belgae apparently took part in most of the later Celtic emigrations, to Asia Minor, Italy, and Spain. About 80 b.c. the Belgic Cassivelauni invaded south-eastern England, and expanded over the territory of the older Celtic inhabitants, who later attempted to obtain help from Rome. Another Belgic tribe, the Atrebates, occupied Hampshire about 50 b.c. These invaders overran a portion of the lowlands, but their advance was stayed by the Roman conquest, which exterminated the Cassivelauni and compelled the Atrebates to submit. The characteristic Belgic pottery of England has not yet been found in Ireland. It is however arguable from tribal names that some Belgae landed there, although 10. O'Riordain claims to have found Celtic fields associated with late bronze-age finds at Cush (P.P.S. (1937), p. 385). Until this site is fully published, *t is impossible to compare it with those in England. The presumably Celtic field-banks of the T oyle Basin [U.J.A., III, \\ (1939)., p. 61) enclosed much larger areas than the Celtic fields of England, and seem to indicate pasture rather than agriculture.

The legendary Fir Bolg may preserve the Belgic name; philological evidence suggests that the Menapii of Wexford, Antrim, and Fermanagh are related to those of the Belgian coast. This movement conceivably included non-Celtic elements. The Cauci of Wicklow may recall the German tribe of Chauci, who lived near the mouth of the Weser and were later an important element in the formation of the Saxons. These tribes may have arrived in Ireland direct from the Continent; we hear of them from Ptolemy, who wrote in the second century a.D., and as the name Menapii had not yet undergone the characteristic Irish modification to Monaigh, they probably had not come long before. It seems best to relate this infiltration to the Roman consolidation of the Rhineland during the last decades before our era. 12 Fig. 5. Scabbards, Lisnacrogher, Co. Antrim. From E. T.

The Roman conquest subjugated, disciplined, and absorbed the Celts of Gaul and Britain, as it had other Celtic lands a century earlier. From this time Celtic culture became in the main, and willingly, provincial Roman, but slightly modified by ancestral tendencies and survivals. Above all, a limit was set to Celtic expansion, 12. Archaeologists are now able to appreciate the widespread reactions of the Roman conquest. The Atrebates in Britain were refugees from Caesar's advance into northern Gaul, and at the same time Veneti from Brittany occupied Maiden Castle in Dorset (Wheeler, Antiquity (1939), p. 58).</page><page sequence="11">The Celts in Archaeology 147 and, apart from readjustments at the end of the Roman empire, the period of Celtic emigration and conquest was closed. The so-called Celtic art of Christian Ireland has little in common with the developed style of the Brythonic Celts some six centuries earlier. Some Irish pieces show typically Celtic spiral motives, but broken up and simplified, and so robbed of much of their charm and significance. The animal-designs of Irish manuscripts are of east-European origin, transmitted by the Germans or the Norsemen. Interlacing, so common in Irish Celtic art, is not originally a Celtic feature, and was widely used in the same period in Croatia. Most Irish figure-sculpture is strongly influenced by late Roman art; the earliest pieces seem to have been derived from wooden originals, possibly indigenous to the country, as the representation of the human form is unusual in the Celtic art of the Continent, which tends to break up anthropomorphic models into curvilinear decoration. Irish Christian art has its peculiar spirit; but instead of Celtic, it were more aptly described as a local phase, with strongly individual characters, of an artistic impulse common to large parts of contemporary Europe. 13 O.
