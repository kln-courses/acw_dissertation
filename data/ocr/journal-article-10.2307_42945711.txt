<plain_text><page sequence="1">Timothy Mathews Apollinaire and Cubism? In this essay I shall be considering the evolution of Apollinaire's poetics through the perspective of his art criticism. I shall be concentrating on Apol- linaire's fascination with cubism, showing that it is neither sudden nor self- interested, but an integrated element of his desire to discover novelty in re- action to the weight of tradition. I shall not be using the notion of "visual poetics" as a means of approaching Apollinaire's own picture-poems. Rather, I shall be situating my study at an earlier moment and showing how Apolli- naire's theorizing about painting affects the production of some of the poems of Alcools (1913), Apollinaire's first major collection of verse. This is not a matter of influence, or even cross-fertilization. It is a matter of developing a poetics- both in visual and in verbal forms of expression- by which the present is espoused in its otherness and novelty explored for its power to overwhelm. * * * Why think of Apollinaire and cubism as related in any way? Why not leave the notoriously unapproachable, anti-illusionism of cubist art to its own devices? Can visual imagery, however loosely defined or dramatically rede- fined, tell us anything about imagery in writing or the action of image in reading? Does Apollinaire's art criticism throw any light on his poetry and its development, and in any event, what pride of place can cubism be said to hold in his perception of the arts? One self-evident reason for considering cubism in this context is the title of Apollinaire's work of sustained art criti- cism, Les peintres cubistes. But this in itself creates further uncertainties, as Apollinaire's own choice of title would have been the words that now stand as the subtitle, Méditations esthétiques. And so again, must we assume that all inroads into the pre-War avant-garde lead to cubism, even if only in the powerful hands of editors and publishers? The development of poetry and painting, both independently and in terms of each other, from about 1900 to the First World War asks us to read and see in many radically new ways. And much of this novelty certainly is highlighted in cubist painting and in the involvement of some of Apollinaire's major poems with it. But at the same time, this novelty cannot be kept within the bounds of cubism as such. In fact, cubism itself cannot be thought of as a self-contained moment in the history of the arts any more than it can be regarded as a break with history. The years leading to the War produced one of the most intense periods of creative activity since the Renaissance, and Style: Volume 22, No. 2, Summer 1988 275</page><page sequence="2">276 Timothy Mathews Apollinaire was involved in all of it. Not only cubism, but also fauvism, fu- turism, and orphism had the effect of reshaping our expectations of art and of fictional artifice generally. It is well known that Apollinaire introduced Bra- que to Picasso and was thus instrumental in giving birth not only to cubism, but to an entirely new kind of art which we loosely call abstract. Not only cubism but this period generally, as well as Apollinaire's Les peintres cubistes itself, charts the collapse of the belief in representation. And yet the issues raised in relating cubism to all this activity are dominant. Gone, in cubism, is any vestige of the sense that visual representation has the power to come to terms with the real world and to penetrate our involvement with it. A new chapter is begun in the awareness that what we know, is not made apparent to us in what we see. The structures of expression, and of artistic expression in particular, are looked into again, explored, in the effort to uncover the processes by which we see and respond. Part of the motivation behind this "avant-gardist" drive towards the so- called abstract is the sense that art works can establish their independence from the links binding them to the concrete world: "Trop d'artistes-peintres," Apollinaire writes in his introductory section to Les peintres cubistes, "adorent encore les plantes, les pierres, l'onde ou les hommes" ( Oeuvres complètes 4: 15) ("Too many painters still adore plants, stones, waves, and people"). His claim is that art prior to the new avant-garde is atrophied in its attitude of worship in relation to nature and appearances. What he sees in the new painting and what he strives for in his own writing is a radical overhaul of the artistic forms in which we represent the world to ourselves, so that the relations we establish between ourselves and the world might be demystified. As I have said, these notions cannot be confined to a cubist school; central as they are to cubist theory and practice, we must consider the immediate history that cubism is responding to. Writers and painters, not only cubist painters, seek to establish a break with previous art in terms of a rejection of Impressionism in the case of painting, and a gradual movement away from symbolism, in the case of poetry. In the pursuit of creative responses able to establish their own independence, Impressionist works such as Renoir's Ball at the Moulin de la Gallette (Renoir 78) came to be seen as inadequately passive. This in spite of the fact that an important concern in such pictures is to move painting at large away from the choice of historical or mythical events for its subject matter and to replant painting firmly in the quotidian and the popular. Moreover, the subsequent concentration by Monet and others on exploring pictorially the effects of light itself seems to shift the focus of painting away from the object and onto the way it is perceived. The use of color in the exploration of light leads Monet to produce a series of paintings depicting objects- such as Rouen Cathedral- under different lights ( Hommage à Claude Monet 291-301). By presenting objects in terms of a series in this way, Monet's work suggests a commitment to the idea of transience and in-</page><page sequence="3">Apollinaire and Cubism? 277 definite passage. This does seem to move attention away from representing objects and from using pictorial fiction to fix objects in time and space. More- over, the use of color in the attempt to trap images of light makes explicit the texture of paint on canvas, and this seems to emphasize, through painting itself, the activity of interpreting objects and coming to terms with them. And yet from a subsequent vantage point in history, Apollinaire and his contemporaries come to see Impressionism as overborn by the cultural ele- ments which give it birth. Apollinaire makes the point in this way in Les peintres cubistes : C'est le propre de l'art, son rôle social, de créer l'illusion du type. Dieu sait que l'on s'est moqué des tableaux de Monet, de Renoir! Eh bien! il suffit de jeter les yeux sur des pho- tographies de l'époque pour s'apercevoir de la conformité des gens et des choses aux tableaux que ces grands peintres en ont peints. ( Oeuvres complètes 4: 22) It is the province of art, its social role, to create the illusion of the typical. God knows how much the paintings of Monet and Renoir were ridiculed. Well, a glance at the photographs of their epoch is enough to reveal the conformity of people and things to the paintings of these great masters. In his pursuit of the novel, Apollinaire's appreciation of the past is here, as ever, highly nuanced. On the one hand, by comparing the works of Monet, Renoir, and Manet with the photography of the period,1 he is indicating the extent to which Impressionist painting at large remains passive and subservient in relation to perceived reality. But on the other hand, Apollinaire is not suggesting that progressive art has to, or indeed can, sever its links with the concrete or with current culture. On the contrary, he indicates that it is the prerogative of art, "son rôle social," to create the illusion or the fiction of "le type," of a definite image of how we reconstruct the world in perception. But by asserting at the same time that such images can only be illusory ones, Apollinaire is making a plea for novelty in art on the basis of a continuing effort to uncover the paths along which we do establish fixed moments and fixed definitions, which we then proceed to identify with. Impressionism, then, in the eyes of the following generation of pictorial innovators, presented itself as a failure to break with representative approaches to expression. But how are we to read Apollinaire's position as poet, rather than as art critic, in relation to his immediate past? It is certainly true that as a young writer in Paris at the beginning of the century, Apollinaire became involved with groups whose aim was to revive the symbolist initiative, rather than to seek new ones. And it is equally clear that the writer seen within these groups to embody the spirit of symbolist poetry is Paul Verlaine. Yet Verlaine's writing has features which seem at odds with the aesthetic concerns Apollinaire voices so consistently in connection with painting. Initially, this might appear surprising, in the same way as the perception of Impressionism as inadequate might appear. For Verlaine is an innovator; his versification loosens the hold</page><page sequence="4">278 Timothy Mathews of classical rhetoric and opens out a poetic space within which to explore the intermeshing of moods and of the senses. Il pleure dans mon coeur Comme il pleut sur la ville Quelle est cette langueur Qui pénètre mon coeur? (Oeuvres poétiques 192) It rains in my heart As it rains on the city What is this languor Which penetrates my heart? writes Verlaine in Romances sans paroles. But Verlaine's concern with re- sponses to objects rather than with description or with analogy is quite different from the Impressionist one. Indeed Verlaine rejects painting generally as being overly preoccupied with imitation and instead turns to a conception of mu- sicality as a way of defining his poetic enterprise. Car nous voulons la Nuance encor Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance! Oh! la nuance seule fiance Le rêve au rêve et la flûte au cor! ( Oeuvres poétiques 326) For we want nuance again Not color, only nuance! Oh! only nuance engages Dream to dream and the flute to the horn! he writes in his Art poétique. This melodic, rather than pictorial, "nuance," while aiming to wrench language from banal designation, also strives to dis- solve the sense of melancholia and alienation that emanates from Verlaine's work as a whole. The desire in Art poétique is to "fiancer le rêve au rêve," to unite one person's dreams with another's. Paradoxically, perhaps, this mel- ancholia and estrangement can only be dissolved if it is indicated. In Verlaine's writing as a whole, a latticework of personalized vocabulary is developed- "langueur," "monotone," "sanglot," "violons," and so on- which has the effect of referring to alienation by providing it with a language somehow all its own, thus defusing it and coming to terms with it. Let us take "Crépuscule du Soir mystique" from Poèmes saturniens : Le souvenir avec le crépuscule Rougoie et tremble à Tardent horizon Noyant mes sens, mon âme et ma raison Mêle dans une immense pâmoison Le souvenir avec le crépuscule ( Oeuvres poétiques 70) Remembrance with the twilight Reddens and trembles at the ardent horizon</page><page sequence="5">Apollinaire and Cubism? 279 Drowning my senses, my soul and my reason Mixes in an immense swoon Remembrance with the twilight The complex circularity in terms of which the poem is constructed seeks to give form to the movements of "le souvenir," to the way in which memory can be prompted by objects, and the way it attaches itself to them. At the same time, what Verlaine creates is the illusion that the impulses of memory and desire are reenclosed within nature and the world at large. Even from within melancholia or sadness, Verlaine locates and thus dissolves the line circum- scribing his seclusion and his difference. In Derain, Apollinaire begins to find an art able to dispense with this kind of nostalgia. Apollinaire had begun to frequent both Derain and Vlaminck in 1904 at the time when these painters were developing their distinctive "fauvist" style. Fauvist images are among those Apollinaire responds to in the generalized "poetic" theorizing of Les trois vertus plastiques, which was orig- inally published as the catalogue notes to a fauvist exhibition in 1908 and which was subsequently to form the first part of Les peintres cubistes. Derain's Le pont de Charing Cross of about 1906 (Figure 1) departs from a desire to represent the diversity of appearance and its effect on us and engages in an attempt fundamentally to reorganize our perceptual responses. Color loses any sense that it is being used to capture the texture of one moment in time or of the sun. In this way, color ceases to be presented as the quality of an object. Equally, the manipulation of line and particularly the Impressionist manip- ulation of points is deemphasized in favor of the manipulation of colored planes and surfaces. The novelty of the impact this creates seems to invite us to reappraise the relation in which painters and viewers are to the world around them. The use of color as an unattached feature comes into play as a structural element in painting itself, or in this painting. This sets up an emphasis on the artifice behind the application of paint to a surface. This is not to say that Derain disregards the world around him and embarks on an arid analysis of the formal qualities of painting itself. What it does mean is that the relation of expression to experience is fragmented, deprived of secure definition and left open to question. Indeed, the fact of presenting objects in terms of colored planes and surfaces recasts appearance as essentially unfamiliar and galvanized. And yet Derain's fauvism is not in itself powerful enough to effect some clear-cut schism in relation to past painting. Nor does it produce a sense of such a breakaway in Apollinaire. Indeed, many poems from Alcools , com- prising work dating from 1900 to 1913, have often been read as Verlainean. Verlaine's "Chanson d'Automne," for example, can be compared to Apolli- naire's "Automne malade." Here is the first stanza of Verlaine's poem:</page><page sequence="6">280 Timothy Mathews Fig. 1.

And this is how Apollinaire's poem ends: Les feuilles Qu'on foule Un train Qui roule La vie S'écoule (Oeuvres poétiques 146) The leaves Which one tramples A train Which rolls Life Collapses Both these poems seem concerned with the anxiety of separation, a melancholic sense of time passing, and with a general nostalgia for a lost unity between the internal monologue of private experience and the socialized language of others. Moreover, each poem seeks a so-called melodic quality in verse: that is, to make verse flexible in meter, rhythm, assonance, and alliteration so that verse itself should have the power to suggest metaphorically the anfractuosities of sense and sentiment. In this way it would appear that both poems, by creating a space for the personal and subjective, the privately melancholic, aim at forcing a recession of an oppressive sense of difference and exclusion. How, if at all, is this to be reconciled with Apollinaire's sense of affinity with Derain's project of reorganizing perceptual response at large? For implicit in that project is an awareness that to challenge accepted response is to espouse shock, surprise, difference, and the resolutely unfamiliar. The problem comes to a head again in the poems from Alcools written with Picasso's pictures of circus figures or harlequins very much in mind. One of those is entitled Young Acrobat on a Ball and was completed in 1904 (Figure 2). Like many other of Picasso's figures in this series, the man seems secluded in his own privacy. Faced with the boy, he seems to brood over the decay of his own magical powers. The figures in their silent dialogue do not seem to suggest a confidence in a strong renaissance in expression or in the possibility of manipulating the world at will. The seated figure, faced with the boy's grace, seems lost in</page><page sequence="8">282 Timothy Mathews Fig. 2. Pablo Picasso. Young Acrobat on a Ball. 1904. Oil on canvas. 147 X 95 cm.

The Colombine is "Frôlée par les ombres des morts" ("Touched by her sense of the dead") and by her elusive involvement in what she has retained from them, in the power they still exercise over her. She appears as "le jour s'exténue" (as "the day dies in exhaustion or in languor"). Moreover, it is a charlatan who an- nounces in the twilight the acrobatic feats that are to be performed by the harlequins and showmen. On the other hand, when the Harlequin appears, he does perform wonders, unhooking a star and juggling with it: Ayant décroché une étoile Il la manie à bras tendu But juxtaposed with this image of a startling ability to manipulate the dimen- sions is the image, derived from Tarot cards, of a hanged man beating cymbals with his feet in the last convulsions of death: Tandis que des pieds en pendu Sonne en mesure les cymbales</page><page sequence="9">Apollinaire and Cubism? 283 In addition to this, Young Acrobat on a Ball is, on one level, more con- cerned with classical modes of artistic expression than with self-consciously modern ones. The presence of the cube on which the man sits and the ball or sphere on which the boy dances suggest that Picasso is concerned with coming to terms with the fundamental structures of his art. In the seated figure's back, Picasso uses anatomy in a further exploration of the possibilities of form, this time the formal qualities of plane and particularly of volume. In effect, the man's back is hollowed out in this way, and formal exploration is thus involved in the sense of depression coming out of the figure as a whole. In Family of Saltimbanques- another picture from the series- Picasso explores the expres- siveness of line (Rubin and Fluegel 58). The hands and arms of these people, particularly those of the women and of the children, are striking in this regard. So in terms of the signifier in these pictures, we have an exploration of the formal features of all drawing- line and surface- and a desire to make plain the expressiveness of their interaction. Yet on the level of the signified, the image represented, we have a sense of decay, of the powers of art and artifice undermined and made unfathomable in memory. What are we to make of this? This is how Apollinaire describes this series of paintings in Les peintres cubistes : D'autres mendiants se sont usés à la vie. Ce sont des infirmes, des béquillards et des bélîtres. Ils s'étonnent d'avoir atteint leur but qui est resté bleu et qui n'est plus l'horizon. Vieillissant, ils sont devenus fous comme des rois qui auraient trop de troupeaux d'éléphants portant de petites citadelles. Il y a des voyageurs qui confondent les fleurs et les étoiles. ( Oeuvres complètes 4: 28) Other beggars are worn out by living. These are the crippled, the lame, and the halt. They are surprised to have reached the goal, which has remained blue but is no longer the horizon. In aging, they have become mad like those kings who might have too many herds of elephants with little temples on their backs. There are travelers who confuse flowers for stars. Emphasizing the infirmity of some of Picasso's figures, Apollinaire also suggests breakthroughs that they have made: they have reached their goal ("atteint leur but"); moreover, they have done away with the horizon, or the idea of it, and thus have liberated themselves from the conventions of perspective. Yet at the same time, they do not dominate the expressiveness they have opened the way to. They are like mad Oriental kings with too many herds, too many elephants with make-believe citadels. And this is perhaps the key to the tension in the pictures between confident manipulation of form and figurations of silence and stasis. The sadness of the harlequins in Picasso's picture as well as in Apollinaire's poem seems to derive from an awareness that whatever new configurations it is in their power to create, whatever new forms they can recast the world in, the associativeness that they open up is as unbounded and uncontrolled as it is expressive. Expressiveness is not something which can be</page><page sequence="10">284 Timothy Mathews simply made plural or unleashed or increased. It is more a galvanized sense of urgency, a galvanized desire for ways to intervene in material coming at us from our subjective past and from cultural history, material which, in the present, is beyond our conscious perception or grasp. This notion creates purchase on what in many ways is one of the most dramatic events of the period. Picasso's Les demoiselles d'Avignon, completed in 1907 (Figure 3), is often thought of as marking the beginning of modern art generally, and of cubist thought in particular. And yet with hindsight, its impact is not one which we would immediately identify as cubist. The drama of its production is centered on the eruption into it of the African masks and figures to the right. Now, do they represent a self-evident break with the quasi- classical understated exploration of form on display in the harlequin series? Or is the relation between the two more complex? The answer is not, as has often been suggested, that Picasso, in his search for the essentially expressive features of art, is drawn to so-called primitive forms. We cannot simply assume that the use of primitive figures suggests a belief that these figures in themselves hold the key to a source of untapped creative power. In his own appreciation of these Oceanic figures, Apollinaire stresses that the sense of the masks, the mythological purposes behind them are absent from our consciousness and from our way of thinking (Guillaume 1). We cannot become involved in the same mythological interplay involving desire, fantasy, and everyday life like the indigenous people who produced these figures originally and used them. So the appeal of these figures seems to be this: for those seeing and using them in 1906 and 1907, they put on display the problematic nature of the relation between experience and history. On one level, we are products of history; on another, our involvement with the present effaces from view the paths binding us to the past and recasts those paths in familiar or unfamiliar form. We need systems and methods to unearth these paths or structures, and these themselves form a part of our vision of the present. Several years later, in "Zone," which appears at the head of Alcools and which was written at a climactic moment in Apollinaire's pursuit of the modern, he evokes the African figures in the following terms: Ce sont les Christ inférieurs des obscures espérances ( Oeuvres poétiques 44) Christ, on the axis of the spiritual and the material, has been lowered ("in- férieurs") from his position of universal signifier. A space opens out where our yearnings ("espérances") take forms that are themselves "obscure" to us. The African figures are recast as icons in search of a context, masking with their magnificence our feelers into them, our efforts to interpret them and our re- lations to them. It is the formal qualities of the figures which make this level of expression possible, rather than any mythological or primitivist content. Just as in the</page><page sequence="11">Apollinaire and Cubism? 285 Fig. 3. Pablo Picasso. Les demoiselles d'Avignon. 1907. Oil on canvas. 96 X 92 inches. Collection, Museum of Modern Art, New York.

Bliss Bequest. © SPA- DEM, 1988. harlequin series, what we are invited to share in here is a delving into the relation of form to expressiveness and into what form makes unavailable in the very process by which it reveals. More firmly than in Young Acrobat on a Ball, in Les demoiselles Picasso engages in an emphatic manipulation of planes and surfaces. On this rests the radical disruption of perspective for which the painting is renowned. In Les peintres cubistes, Apollinaire remarks</page><page sequence="12">286 Timothy Mathews that the goal of the new art is to "embrasser d'un coup d'oeil: le passé, le présent, et l'avenir": that is, that the objective of art is to embrace at a glance the past, the present, and the future. Picasso's Femme aux poires of 1909 (Rubin and Fluegel 133), casts this project in spatial terms. The disruption of perspective involved in Picasso's manipulation of planes or surfaces here cre- ates an illusion that a totality of points of view or of perspectives has access to the canvas. The picture abandons the fiction that looking at points arranged from here to a point on the horizon tells us all we need to know about the world as it falls under our vision. At its most sophisticated, as in Picasso's Man with a Mandolin, (191 1) for example (Figure 4), cubist art seeks to exploit the flatness of the canvas to suggest everything that is not flat. Apollinaire describes the process as "imitant les plans pour représenter les volumes" {Oeuvres complètes 4: 30). At the same time, we must confront the obvious, which is that such pictures are all but indecipherable. Apollinaire's remark about objects being seen from an indefinite series of perspectives simultaneously is perhaps a state- ment of cubist purpose. But it is in tension with cubist productions, for the object is lost in Man with a Mandolin. There is no sense of a unique plan for each object providing it with definition and significance.

Despite its apparently abstract quality, it is in many ways highly concrete: it relies on the painterly qualities of color, surface, and line, and it exploits the flatness of the canvas. The so-called ab- stract art reminds us in this way that it is attempting to deal with the real and our perception of it rather than with something abstract in the sense of some- thing purely conceptual. What the painting, and its indecipherability, give form to is interpretation itself. The man and his pipe each disappear in a multiplicity of facets and thus become lost in one another. To look at such a picture is to become involved in seeking out fixity where there is none, in striving to es- tablish stable relations where all relation is mobile. Saying that cubist painting gives form to the movements of interpretation is not to say that it breaks through into some different dimension. Man with a Mandolin is very much about the here and now. It seeks to represent the way we come to terms with the world around us over a period of time. It is therefore also concerned with the way memory becomes involved in this pro- cess. Hence the whole picture consists of a number of unpredictable shifts, changes of direction, reappraisals. At the same time, the picture seeks to come to terms with what Apollinaire calls in Les peintres cubistes "la vérité des objets." What he means by this seems to be that in the reality of our perceptual lives, objects do present themselves in a single perspective by displacing others. As we look around us, we select objects, exclude others, or emphasize them hierarchically. It is this displacement which cubist painting comes to terms with via the flatness of the canvas just as the potential indecipherability of the picture gives mobile form to what objects in perspective hide from view. The picture does not set out to achieve what is impossible in terms of our experience of perception: that is, to create an indefinite access to all the stimuli that might come at us from any moment in time. It has a less idealist objective. It suggests that this diversity, or our sense of it, assumes the form of groups of objects that we see and that it is for this reason that we analyze them and delve into them so methodically. So there is a tension in an analytic cubist picture such as Man with a Mandolin between simultaneity of points of view on the one hand and a sense of displacement or unavailability on the other. The same is true of "collage" works. "Collage," as is well-known, is a practice initiated by cubist artists and consists in applying pieces of colored paper, pieces of newspaper or other flat objects from the concrete world directly onto the canvas. What is the point of disrupting the rationally constituted world by mixing up objects from a multiplicity of different contests in a variety of painterly and nonpainterly media? The objective is not a kind of proto-Surrealist pursuit of the irrational. This art is nothing if not rational. Indeed it is in relation to a "collage" work- Picasso's Still Life with Chair-Caning of 1912 (Figure 5)- that Apollinaire makes his comment about "la vérité des objets":</page><page sequence="14">288 Timothy Mathews Fig. 5.

L'art du peintre n'ajoutera aucun élément pittoresque à la vérité de ces objets. ( Oeuvres complètes 4: 29-30) Sometimes Picasso deigned to confide to the light real objects: a two-penny song, an au- thentic postage stamp, a bit of oilcloth on which was printed the caning of a chair. The painter's art will add no picturesque element to the truth of these objects. Just as in his painting, in "collage," with its juxtaposition of a variety of objects and different pictorial elements, Picasso asks questions about our relation to the objective world. The fact of bringing objects from a range of different contexts to bear on one another in fact means that the idea of memory is again involved in the impact the work creates. We may wonder where the objects come from, how they relate to each other, what associations they carry for us, and what information we bring with us as we confront the picture. The ques- tions, of course, remain unanswered. As Marjorie Perloff puts it, "the intro- jected fragment retains its alterity" (52). Once again, the terms are unavailable by which we could specify objects or fix their relations to each other. So the picture does not suggest that different moments in memory have an uncomplicated access to each other or that memory at large has an automatic access to us as we see and think in the here and now. As Apollinaire says, by including the artificial imprint of a piece of chair-caning in what is to be received as a work of art, Picasso is confronting something about the reality of the way we perceive. And his "collage" constructs a new visual fiction with which to do so. The chair-caning in the picture has become textualized. Picasso has prevented us from associating it with a particular chair and has involved it in the network of shapes and indefinite changes of direction that make up the rest of the picture. In this way, instead of presenting memory as something which is simply extendable, the picture is itself, in the moments we look at it, the form taken by our efforts to interpret and come to terms with the world of objects and of images. In this way, the picture concerns itself with the way we all operate in the present and adopt attitudes to it. Cubism as a whole complicates the idea of the present as something which can be simply identified, as something which we are in possession of and which we can identify with immediately. On the contrary, Still Life with Chair-Caning redefines the experience of immediacy and sends it back to us as a sense of fragmentation. Each element is either embodied in others or absolutely different from them. This not only asks questions about how we seek to define. It also presents the world in images which are continuously unfamiliar. Cubist art concerns itself with an indivi- sible unfamiliarity which permeates our experience of the present and our involvement with it. I have indicated the extent to which Apollinaire in his art criticism is involved with the complex project that cubist art sets itself, in fact involved</page><page sequence="16">290 Timothy Mathews in shaping it. But what of his poetry? It is often overlooked that the poems of Alcools coincide in time with the development of cubism, rather than his later collection Calligrammes with its more self-evident poetic innovation. The poems in Alcools were produced between 1900 and 1913, those of Calli- grammes not until 1 9 1 3 to 1 9 1 6. The composition of "Automne malade" spans almost all of the Alcools years. As I said earlier, it is one of the Alcools poems often thought of as Verlainean in mode. Like other poems in the collection- such as "Automne," "Cors de Chasse," "Rhénane d'Automne," "L'Émigrant de Landor Road"- "Automne malade" seems more concerned with familiar poetic form and imagery than with novelty, disruption, or a sense of continuous difference. It deals with nature and nostalgia, it is introverted and private in tone, it plays with reference to Rhineland mythology dear to German roman- ticism. But in his use of seemingly backward-looking lyrical features, Apolli- naire in fact creates a network of imagery impossible to stabilize. Initially, the signifying elements within each image make this clear. Take this one, for example: Au fond du ciel Des éperviers planent In the depths of the sky Sparrow-hawks glide On the one hand, we can read this in terms of familiar lyrical metaphors of distance and nostalgia: the sparrow-hawks float in the depths of the sky. But the phrase "au fond de" makes the image more complicated than this, since it means both at the back of and at the bottom of. These meanings, taken either separately or in conjunction, result in the sparrow-hawks not being stabilized in the sky; they move in a space which perspective cannot define and in which the horizon is not active. Pauvre automne Meurs en blancheur et en richesse De neige et de fruits murs Poor autumn Die now in the whiteness and richness Of snow and ripe fruit. Apollinaire writes at another stage in the poem. He presents us with an autumn which disappears and yet which suggests fertility. Again it is possible to read this in terms of a conventional lyrical interplay of opposites operating under the dominant metaphors of transience, the passage of time, distant receptacles of associative potential. But the image is not simply an interplay of opposites. It involves another process of displacement. The fertility of previous seasons does not coexist with the whiteness of the snow that succeeds it. The white covers the past, making the wealth of past association unavailable, rendering</page><page sequence="17">Apollinaire and Cubism? 291 it implicit, making us read it in the whiteness of the snow which gives it form and displaces it simultaneously. Nostalgia in the poem is galvanized and rep- resents the unavailability of remembered experience. This is intensified in the memory that finds expression exclusively in forms or images from which it is different, that is, the whiteness of the snow. This applies to the overall me- taphoric structure of the poem involving nostalgia, autumn, transience, and so on. The poem does not do away with the recognizable lyrical responses that it elicits, any more than Apollinaire in general is able to step out of history. Similarly, cubism does not seek to do away with the object. "Automne malade" turns lyricism in on itself, makes it an instance of thought or interpretation at grips with itself. We may glibly call the poem lyrical, or autumnal in theme, but these are the things in terms of which our experience, as we read, is pre- sented to us. The same is true of the chair-caning in Picasso's collage: this object is the form taken by our efforts to interpret it and see beyond it. Thus in the last lines of "Automne malade," Apollinaire steers the language of the poem towards an overwhelming intensification of everything autumnal and poetically transient. In this way and with the use of rhythm, he steers us into a confrontation with language as such and into a sense of an unstoppable process of wiping out as we read or perceive words and images alive in the present: Les feuilles Qu'on foule Un train Qui roule La vie S'écoule The leaves We trample A train That rolls Life Collapses. I would like to end this study by looking at this dynamic in one of Apollinaire's longer poems in Alcools , although there is not enough room here to read it in its totality. "Les Fiançailles" ( Oeuvres poeêtiques 128) in its com- position is typical of the nonlinear historical development of "modernism" in this period and of Apollinaire's ability to shuffle the cards of the cultural events going on around him. Completed in 1908, it is a poem written in response to the neosymbolist revival spearheaded by Jean Royère. And yet it is also ded- icated to Picasso, whose Demoiselles had appeared a year earlier. In the opening section of the poem, Apollinaire seems to entertain the symbolist imagery of the previous generation, but the narrator ends up with foresworn lovers and broken contracts. There follows a section evoking the decay of past modes of expression and of the creative ambitions associated with them. Apollinaire</page><page sequence="18">292 Timothy Mathews then embarks on a number of rhetorical assertions of the creative ego. He compares himself to Icarus, seeking to reach the sun and rise above the con- structions of the material world and above any worship or imitation of it. But the narrator is undermined in this by the weight of associations coming at him from the past and by his language in which these associations are made un- fathomable. He then looks behind him in an aggressive effort to reorganize his past; but instead of this, he finds memory bearing fruit all around him in the present. We then come to this climactic plea for integration: Pardonnez-moi mon ignorance Pardonnez-moi de ne plus connaître l'ancien jeu des vers Je ne sais plus rien et j'aime uniquement Pardon me my ignorance Pardon me for not knowing the old play of versifying I no longer know anything and I only love A plea for integration on the basis of ignorance, then. But it is an ignorance which allows him to find new forms of expression with which to approach the world, for he no longer understands the old verse. From within this state of enjoying a sense of history being kept within the bounds of the here and now, the narrator is able to take part in the novelty of everything around him. That is, he is in a position to enjoy the difference between everything around him, and anything that he could call "himself': Et je souris des êtres que je n'ai pas créés And I smile at the beings that I have not created And yet once again in the poem, confidence of this kind is not allowed to go unchecked. Here, though, it is not undermined, but complicated: Mais si le temps venait où l'ombre enfin solide Se multipliait en réalisant la diversité formelle de mon amour J'admirerais mon ouvrage But if the time came when the shadow, at last solid Multiplied by creating the formal diversity of my love I would admire my work If the narrator could discover a language as mobile in form as experience is diverse, he could admire his work. But in reality, his language, he implies, does not relate to his experience in this way. In relation to language, his de- sires- "mon amour," that is- are deconstituted; there is no sense of an object which would fulfill them. In the language that he uses, the poetic narrator lacks an identity. The same is true of him as he meets the variety of images, words, and associations- "les êtres que je n'ai pas créés"- that come at him and that</page><page sequence="19">Apollinaire and Cubism? 293 remold him continuously. It is to a point such as this that cubist art leads us. We are left with the awareness that as we move out from under old forms, the pursuit of the modern is a process as estranging as it is liberating. We are not freed from the world as we find it or from the structuring in history and in memory of the ways we perceive. Objects and figures are made ever more complex in the effort to unearth the ways in which we build them up in our own perception. Equally, such art, from its inception to the heights of its analyticism, brings itself up against objects once again. It fails to distinguish itself from the object-ness of objects and from our involvement with them. Indeed, it does not seek to. Braque's La portugais (Figure 6) seeks to reconfront the present as we find it: that is, as half memories, remnants, vestiges, or fragments, which are the material with which the picture itself is built up. This art creates images of our existence in what we think of us "now." And these images are as res- olutely decentered as those other images coming at us from outside the art gallery and the art book, and as decentered as all those things that waking moments blot from view and give life to simultaneously. ♦ * * I would like to conclude with some theoretical considerations.

Implicit in my ap- proach is the view that it is in interpreting cubism- as well as the orphism which Delaunay developed from within it- that we gain a sense of the poetics of the estranged and the decentered pursued by Apollinaire. Equally implicit in my approach is the view that Apollinaire's response to novelty is an active and aware one with regard to our power to intervene in perceived forms. Marjorie Perloff, on the other hand, has argued the case for endowing futurism with the power to have propelled the language of rupture into our current, "postmodern" consciousness. Her book The Futurist Moment is a galvanizing one in the breadth of its range and in the insight it displays in engaging with a variety of divergent and self-exploding verbal and/or visual artifacts. What I want to take issue with here briefly is the attempt to encompass this fertile "avant-garde" of the pre-1914 years within futurism or indeed within any notionally dominant theory. Having begun with the question "why cubism?", I propose to conclude with the question "why futurism?" In doing so, I shall necessarily do scant justice to the mobility of Perloff s argument. I can only invite readers to engage or reengage with it for themselves and to judge its theory and practice accordingly. Perloff argues that a nationalist rivalry is responsible for the rift which occurred between Italian futurist practice and cubist artists, which many critics since have interpreted as a sign of a radical theoretical variance between the two groups of practitioners.2 She suggests that futurist collage has as much to do with decomposition and the problem of context as does cubist collage and that it forces us to reconsider critically the futurist boastful pursuit of a vast and indefinite interconnectability, interpénétration, and analogy. In the reality of the viewer's experience, futurist collage "is characterized by accretion rather than synthesis." On this basis, futurism is seen to absorb the cubist drive and discovers the power to build with the cultural material which forms our con- sciousness and to resist being swamped by this material. Futurism, it is once again implied, succeeds where cubism falls short: it achieves that goal deemed to be common to all activity in this hyperactive "avant-garde": "the obliter- ation of the distinction between the pictorial field and the 'real' world outside the frame." Clicheé and cultural reference at large form a space within which an indefinite, unoppressive, and detached mobility can be pursued within ci- tation, formation, and absorption. For Perloff, the futurist perspective provides access to "the way we make the public world our own." But such an enterprise might be both dubious and doomed to failure unless it were propelled by the desire to break the seductive power of forms and to intervene in the elusiveness of the terms of represent- ability. The outcome of attempting to dissolve the frame of the picture could</page><page sequence="21">Apollinaire and Cubism? 295 only be participation without representation, and this is a recipe for oppression. The self-evident failure of futurist artifacts to realize the desired synthesis of singular and indefinite perception has different implications from those of the similar failure which occurs in cubist production and which I discussed earlier. For as Perloff herself argues, the futurist fantasy is for indefinite transformation and heroic victory over the material, over its immobilizing weight and its cultural force. The futurist attempt to dispense with the window frame of representation, to suppress awareness of its own functioning and its own ar- tifice, makes its products irreconcilable with Barthes's notion of "le signe pur" and of "la métaphore sans frein," which he brings to play in his ironic analysis of the Eiffel Tower and which Perloff uses in support of her own argument. For there, fantasy, desire, and subjugation are in a mobile and mutually creative relation to each other. Perloff points out that, for Barthes, "le signe pur" created by the Eiffel Tower, that "objet inimitable et sans cesse reproduit" ("that inimitable object ceaselessly reproduced"), detaches itself from the illusion of mastery. But we need follow Barthes much further. To seem to outmaneuver mimesis poses as many problems as it solves. "Le signe pur" is part of the myth and the fantasy articulated in response to La Tour as well as in, specif- ically, "avant-gardist" invention: to move out from inside the oppressive struc- ture of language at large that Barthes so eloquently describes in his Leçon inauguarale. Notre vrai guerre est ailleurs; elle est contre les pouvoirs [as opposed to le Pouvoir], et ce n'est pas un combat facile: car, pluriel dans l'espace social, le pouvoir est, symmétriquement, perpétuel dans le champ historique: chassé, exténué ici, il reparaît là. . . . Cet objet en quoi s'inscrit le pouvoir, de toute éternité humaine, czt: le langage- ou pour être plus précis, son expression obligée: la langue. . . . Ainsi, par sa structure même, la langue implique une relation fatale d'aliénation. (11-13) Our true war is elsewhere; it is against the powers [as opposed to Power], and it is not an easy combat: for, although plural in the social arena, power is, symmetrically, perpetual in the historical domain: chased out, exhausted, in one location, it reappears in another. . . . The object in which power is inscribed for all time is speech, or, to be more precise, in its particular expression: language. . . . Thus, by its very structure, language implies a fatal relation of alienation. The plural, the deferred, the unrespresentable do not, then, undermine the power of public over private, since that power is itself characterized by the plural; it is cast in plurality. "Le signe pur" is an expression of the desire to move out from under the formation of our modes of discourse at the hands of language, and our subjugation by it. The Barthesian "mise-en-scène" ("staging") of the terms of signification, which, Perloff reminds us, Barthes places at the vortex of avant-garde activity, is thus a dramatization, an incarnation of the terms of our alienation in lan- guage and in the structures of its production. To obliterate the frame of rep- resentation is thus to destroy our purchase on the plurality of power, to efface the "mise-en-scène" from view. At the same time, this "mise-en-scène," such</page><page sequence="22">296 Timothy Mathews as is produced in our responses to the Eiffel Tower, accedes to mobility and deferral exclusively in the realm of "l'imaginaire," not to be disentangled from the Lacanian Imaginaire , that discourse of grief and lost origin and of fantasy or illusion of totality: à travers la Tour, les hommes exercent cette grande fonction de l'imaginaire, qu'est leur liberté, puisque aucune histoire, si sombre soit-elle, n'a jamais pu la leur enlever. (see Perloff 2 1 3) by means of the Tower, men exercise that great function of the imaginary, their liberty, because no history, no matter how dark it may be, has ever been able to take it away from them. Our liberty is discovered in our striving to represent and to grasp the inter- actions by which we make sense by which we affirm what is repeated. Our creativity takes the form of the mobility with which the structures of signifi- cation and response are represented. "L'imaginaire" is in flight both from and into the psychohistorically determined desire for wholeness. As Barthes muses in Le grain de la voix, in the sentence succeeding his description of the "mis- en-scène" which Perloff quotes as though it were conclusive, society may well be essentially unable to operate a system such as "/a semiosis," a system not based on "le contenu" ("Contents"), on "le lisible" ("the readerly") and the organizing systems which consecrate them: "II est probable que la société résiste à la semiosis, à un monde qui serait accepté comme un monde de signes, c'est- à-dire sans rien derrière" (Le grain de la voix 225) ("It is probable that society resists semiosis, a world that would be accepted as a world of signs, that is, without anything behind it"). Seen in this light, futurist simultaneity is not a resistance to closure, but a repetition of its effects: citation consecrated in its own quotation makes. The essentially readable/readerly quality of the elements making up futurist pro- duction, which Perloff draws attention to, limits their plurality and makes this production powerless in relation to the structuring of our perception against which it protests so aggressively. In this context, it is not as elitist, nor as specifically Marxist, as Perloff contends, to approach our involvement with language as essentially alienating. To seek to make of this alienation a dynamic response to our structuring at the hands of given language forms is now the challenge thrown down to producers and consumers of art alike. The "destruc- tion of the I," which Marinetti projects and which Perloff examines, is ulti- mately hardly more than a plea against anthropomorphism, and it opens the way to placing the I back in power, behind a "high-powered microscope" exploring "passionate hypotheses," as Marinetti puts it in his manifesto. Post- modern subversion of the I and of the ego, its decentering of the subject, on the other hand, seeks to undermine the myth of creativity itself in an effort to uncover the relations biding the present to history. What is at stake here is the setting in place of an affirmation, a power to maneuver, a power to intervene</page><page sequence="23">Apollinaire and Cubism? 297 in the process of signification without repeating it and without servitude, an affirmation that does not involve collaboration. "On ne peut pas transporter avec soi le cadavre de son père" ("One cannot transport with oneself his father's corpse"), as Apollinaire writes and Perloff so aptly quotes. Equally, to reject representation of "nos pères" and their power to give in to the illusion of burial, is to undermine the basis for the invention of new forms. In the very next paragraph, Apollinaire writes: "Mais, nos pieds ne se détachent qu'en vain du sol qui contient les morts" ( Oeuvres complètes 4: 16; my italics) ("But our feet detach themselves only in vain from the ground which holds the dead"). Notes 1 See, for example, Édouard Maneťs Café-concert (1878) or La prune (1878) in Manet (408, 415). 2 My comment on Perloffs work is a response to chapters 2 and 4 of The Futurist Moment , and all quotations of her work are taken from those chapters.
