<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORY AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE OF THE POTATO. By Redcliffe N. Salaman; with a chapter on Industrial Uses by W. G. Burton. Cambridge University Press, New York and London. $10.00. xxiv + 685 pp. + 33 plates; text ill. 1949. This book is a distinguished contribution to the litera- ture on the plants which nourish mankind. The author has spent more than 40 years in research upon the ge- netics, morphology, and pathology of the potato and in his later years augmented these with a study of the social and economic reactions ensuing from the adop- tion by the masses of a cheap, efficient, and easily pro- duced foodstuff. This unique approach has resulted in a scholarly and fascinating treatise which is of interest not only to botanists and horticulturists but also to historians and sociologists. The history of the potato is traced back to its begin- nings in the highlands of South America. There, primitive man, who had made his way eastward from the lowlands, was enabled to maintain himself at high altitudes through the cultivation of the potato which became his principal food plant. The importance of the potato to the prehistoric peoples of Peru and the adjoining countries of South America is attested by a wealth of archaeological remains, principally pottery, in which the tuber is represented, sometimes quite realistically, sometimes with curious anthropomorphic symbolisms. Botanical researches by the author and his colleagues indicate that the cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum, is actually a form of S. andigenum, a forty-eight chromo- some polyploid species which arose through the chromo- some doubling of S. stenotonum and perhaps other species in the region of Lake Titicaca. Forms of S. andigenum resembling S. tuberosum occur at the fringes of its range in Chile and Colombia. The Russian botanists believed that the European potato came from Chile. Dr. Salaman makes an excellent case for a Colombian derivation. Once introduced into Europe, the adoption of the potato met with considerable opposition from the com- mon people for a great variety of reasons: it was not mentioned in the Bible; it was the first edible plant to be grown in Europe for its tubers; its flowers resembled those of the deadly nightshade; it was confused with the sweet potato which supposedly was dangerously lust- inducing; during the period when the fabulous Doc- trine of Signatures prevailed, the rough scurfy skin of the potato called to mind such diseases as leprosy. But in spite of prejudices and suspicions the potato gradu- ally became an important food plant, partly because it was a "heaven-sent gift" to industrialists eager to find cheap living for cheap labor engaged in producing cheap goods. More than half of the book is devoted to the his- tory of the potato in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Eng- land, and the Channel Islands. Its history on the Continent is, regrettably, barely touched upon. Of particular interest are the chapters on the potato in Ireland. Ireland was the only country where the new crop spread naturally and quickly became the principal food of the masses. In Ireland it eventually brought disaster. There were numerous failures of the potato crop in Ireland in local areas but the universal failures of 1845 and 1946 caused famine followed by scurvy, dysentery, cholera, and typhus. There had been no disaster so acute since the Black Death. The famine was followed by a wave of emigration from Ireland to America. The atmosphere in which American, Irish, and English relations were to develop for the next hundred years was determined in a large part by the failure of the potato crop in these two critical years and by the widespread distress and animosity which followed. The author concludes in a brief epilogue that "After proving itself the most perfect instrument for the maintenance of poverty and degradation amongst the native masses, the potato ended in wrecking both exploited and exploiter."</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 67 There is an interesting final chapter on the potato in the realm of art which complements an earlier chap- ter on the archaeological record. The book contains several useful appendices and the most comprehensive bibliograplhy yet published on the potato. PAUL C. MANGELSDORF</page></plain_text>
