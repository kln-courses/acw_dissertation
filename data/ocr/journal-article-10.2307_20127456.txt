<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE CHARLES TAYLOR A HE ISSUE about hermeneutics in modern philosophy and social sci ence goes back to Dilthey and to his claim that we must distinguish between what we could call the natural and human sciences (Natur and Geisteswissenschaften). The claim is that there is something special about the subject matter of the latter which forbids us simply to carry over the method elaborated in natural science to the study of man. But to many, this distinction has seemed unjustified, even ob scurantist. One of the important traits of modern science has been its concern about method, ever since Descartes' great discourse on the subject. To put the sciences of man outside the ban of the methods of natural science seems to be to put them outside the range of science itself. On this view, science must be in principle a unity; or at least it must involve a set o? d?marches which are the same without discrimination as to the object studied. For some time the battle lines were clearly drawn between pro ponents of the special nature of the sciences of man, which could only proceed by interpretation, and defenders of the unity of science. By far the most influential in the latter camp were the logical empiricists, for whom the unity of science was almost a sacred cause. Logical em piricists elaborated a canonical account of scientific explanation, often called the "deductive-nomological theory," according to which ex plaining some phenomenon amounted to showing how the statement describing it could be deduced from some true general law together with some statement of initial conditions. Debates raged, for in stance, on the question whether historical explanations could be ade quately understood on this model. In those days, defenders of hermeneutics had a clear map of the philosophical universe. They knew who the enemy was, and they knew where to direct their dialectical artillery. But in the last dec ade things have changed in a disconcerting way. Suddenly, logical empiricism is under attack from all directions. Many philosophers who have been formed in its ethos have turned against its cherished doctrines. In particular the deductive-nomological theory comes in for a lot of abuse. And out of the confusion, a new alignment ap pears. Review of Metaphysics 34 (September 1980): 3-23 Copyright ? 1980 by the Review of Metaphysics</page><page sequence="2">26 CHARLES TAYLOR There is now abroad a new thesis of the unity (or at least nondu ality) of science, espoused by critics of logical empiricism. According to this notion, the appearance of radical difference between the two kinds of science was a kind of phaenomenon bene fundatum, a thesis we could all be pardoned for holding as long as the logical empiricist account of natural science was accepted as canonic, because every one could see that the sciences of man weren't like this. Of course, we can't distinguish sharply in the study of man between the data of ex perience and their theoretical explanation; of course, understanding must play an important role; of course, we can't give an important place to exact, formalizable languages; of course, we can't distinguish sharply between facts and meanings. But, the new thesis goes, this distinction disappears once we re alize that the logical empiricists sold us an extraordinary bill of goods about natural science. Once we awaken from our positivist slumbers we realize that none of these features hold of natural science either. The two turn out to be methodologically at one, not for the positivist reason that there is no rational place for hermeneutics; but for the ra dically opposed reason that all sciences are equally hermeneutic. This is an extraordinary reversal. Old-guard Diltheyans, their shoulders hunched from years-long resistance against the encroach ing pressure of positivist natural science, suddenly pitch forward on their faces as all opposition ceases to the reign of universal hermeneu tics. This is a pleasing fancy. Moreover, it has been supported by very insightful people with convincing argument. I think, for in stance, of Mary Hesse ("In Defense of Objectivity," British Academy Lecture) and of one of our present symposiasts, Richard Rorty. But I think this is wrong. I'd like to try to explain why, very tersely. I want to do so by tracing once again briefly the argument as to what is wrong with logi cal empiricism, and the deductive-nomological model, showing how a critique of this model requires us to accept a place for understanding in natural science, then trying to show how the "understanding" which since Dilthey has been claimed as central to the sciences of man is different from this, and attempting to indicate what rides on the issue. All this will be concise and dogmatic, to make an appropriate presentation, but I hope I can defend all the steps of the argument further in discussion.</page><page sequence="3">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE 27 I One of the principal things wrong with logical empiricism was its imprisonment within traditional empiricist epistemology. According to this, what is primarily observed are qualities and events, which latter can be understood as the occurrence of qualities. Substances and causal action are to be understood in terms of these primary ob servables. Substances are reinterpreted as concatenations of pro perties; causal actions are reinterpreted as exemplifications of cor relations of events of similar type. In each case, the interpretation provides all the empirical evidence for the term interpreted; it gives the real cash value. Now without being concerned to the same degree with the men talistic formulations of eighteenth century empiricism, modern posi tivism shared these basic prejudices. Consequently, it could never understand or do justice to an account of scientific explanation in terms of substances (or kinds ofthing), and their causal powers. An account in these terms had always inescapably to be reformulated into one in terms of correlations, for substances and causal powers were themselves to be understood in terms of correlations. Now I think those writers are correct who maintain that scien tific knowledge has to do with our learning to grasp and identify the kinds of things there are and their causal action. The "realist" view, defended by writers like Harr?, is that we explain phenomena by showing them to flow from the operation of the kinds of thing that there are, where our conception of such kinds cannot be reductively eliminated in favor of some other type of concept. But for logical empiricism, substance and kind terms always had to suffer such reductive elimination, in keeping with the conceptions of traditional empiricism. Explaining B by showing how it flows from the causal powers of substance S under conditions C must be interpreted as showing that B follows from the correlation cluster S plus A, because all that S amounts to is a correlation among events of certain types. But this amounts to showing that B is subsumed under the correlation cluster S + A. And so the crucial explanatory relation is one of subsumption. This is the basis of the deductive nomological model. The same epistemological background theory, which made a re strictive view of what was observable decisive for the theory of seien</page><page sequence="4">28 CHARLES TAYLOR tifie explanation, lies behind many of the characteristic errors and blind alleys of logical empiricism, for instance, the various attempts to distinguish between observables and theoretical entities. The realist view, on the other hand, has entirely broken with this epistemology. It recognizes that our scientific understanding arises as a refinement, development, and correction of our ordinary under standing, or perhaps better "pre-understanding," to use a word with Heideggerian resonance. Our pre-understanding of the things which surround us is the knowledge we have prior to any formulation of how to deal with them. This know-how can be the basis of formulations, either state ments about the objects, or recipes for how to deal with them to cer tain ends. And we are often driven by the difficulties of practice, as well as by our own desire for more conscious understanding, to make such formulations. But this pre-understanding can never be exhaus tively expressed in any list, however long, of such formulations. Rather, there is a dependence in the other direction: the formulations are intelligible to us because we share the background pre-under standing. We read a recipe, for instance, telling us how to bake a cake. The recipe consists of a number of injunctions to action: take two pounds of butter, churn well, etc., which injunctions we can follow be cause we know how to carry out these actions. This presupposed know-how is what is not formulated and, in certain cases, seems to be almost incapable of formulation. Knowing what a substance is like is inexhaustible in this way. Here is a chunky rock before me. I recognize this as a rock, as thus hard, heavy, resistant, etc., as is the wont of rocks. I know that it can crush some objects, bounce off others, make a certain sound on impact with others, resist my pressure, depress that pillow, and so on. These powers are not independently discovered; they belong to gether in my recognition of this as a rock. This is not to say that there is some logical connection between these powers: e.g., smashing windows, scratching tables, bouncing off walls. The wind can do the first, but not the second or third; my fingernail can do the second, but not the first or third; a puffball can do the third, but not the first or second. The point is rather that these powers are connected in the rock because I can generate the true statements attributing them and a host of others, indefinite in number, from the same general capacity for dealing with rocks and</page><page sequence="5">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE 29 other things which surround me. These are all articulations of the same pre-understanding. This is not to say either that this pre-understanding is not in some sense the result of experience. Just about nothing we know about the world could be so described. It is just that experience doesn't teach us to constitute a notion of a kind of thing through asso ciating powers originally identified in isolation. Rather, we are al ways dealing with such kinds of things, about which we could make an indefinite list of affirmations; and experience makes it possible for us to refine and enrich our understanding, draw new distinctions, identify new kinds, and so on. This kind of pre-understanding cannot be exhausted by any list, however long, of formulations. Rather, the formulations themselves rely on our pre-understanding. We know that this object will scratch that table, for instance. But we are also capable of recognizing an indefinite range of countervailing conditions, in which this wouldn't happen. Our formulations stand always against a background of un stated and not-fully-statable defeasibility conditions. Now the realist understanding of natural science explanation sees this as involving a far-reaching refinement, extension, correction, or transformation of this pre-understanding, but one which retains a crucial place for the conception of a substance or kind of thing. The kinds which figure in advanced physics are extremely different from those we are familiar with in ordinary life, are even bizarre or exhibit features utterly incompatible with ordinary objects of everyday con cern. But since our understanding of them is related as an extension to our pre-understanding of the things surrounding us in ordinary life, it retains this character of being the potential source of an indefi nite number of formulations. The understanding we gain through a scientific theory always goes beyond the laws or formulae which ex haust its present formulation. This is what logical empiricism was incapable of recognizing, for it looked on the existing formulation as everything, and the explana tory power of a theory as defined by what could be deduced from this formulation. That is why it was powerless to explain what made a theory really explanatory, while the mere deduction of the explanan dum from true general laws could often be utterly jejune and unin teresting. It was also why it could never recognize that what made the best explanation best was never subject to complete articulation, without for all that being a matter of quite arbitrary choice, as Po</page><page sequence="6">30 CHARLES TAYLOR lanyi so well recognized (and as Quine still doesn't; the "indetermi nacy of theory" is frequently an indeterminacy simply relative to ex plicit bits of evidence, i.e., the phenomena a theory must "save," not relative to the underlying conception of the kinds of thing proposed; from this latter point of view, it may be quite evident which theory is superior.) But now if this is so, then it is clear that some kind of under standing, a partially implicit grasp on things which cannot be ex hausted by exact formulations, plays an essential role in natural sci ence. But this sounds very much like what "hermeneuticists" have been claiming all along for the sciences of man. But now it might ap pear that they themselves were victims of the empiricist illusion in believing that natural science was different in this respect. Once one overcomes this illusion, are not the two to be seen as on the same footing? II No, because the kind of understanding involved in the two cases is different. The understanding which is relevant to the sciences of man is something more than this implicit grasp on things. It is re lated rather to the kind of understanding we invoke in personal rela tions, when we say, for instance: "I find him hard to understand"; or "at last I understand her." To switch for a minute to another lan guage, it is the kind of understanding one invokes in French when one says "maintenant on s'entend. " We are talking here in these cases of what you could call human understanding, understanding what makes someone tick, or how he feels or acts as a human being. To circumscribe this kind of understanding less intuitively, we might say that it is the kind of understanding we need to grasp desir ability-characterizations. Let's say we know someone whose behav ior and reactions are opaque to us. He is refusing a promotion we see as eminently desirable. After a long talk with him, we come to see what he is about. We see, for instance, that he has a fastidious revul sion to pushing his own prestige, to seeking an important role. We may not agree or approve of his reaction, but now we understand it. Understanding this kind ofthing is bound up with understanding the way in which the relevant courses of action can be desirable or undesirable. We see what he's about, for instance, when we under</page><page sequence="7">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE 31 stand that he hates above all to be pushy, insensitively self-assertive, to come across as one who has no doubts about his worth and how others should treat him, who is self-infatuated to the point of blind ness. Some of the terms I have just used in this last sentence are terms that he might use to himself, such key desirability-characteri zations (or in this case tmdesirability-characterizations) as "pushy," "insensitive," "blindly self-infatuated." We come to understand what makes him tick when we understand what these terms mean, when we know how to use terms like this. In that way, human understanding is closely bound up with being able to apply terms of a certain kind, what I have called (follow ing Elizabeth Anscombe) "desirability-characterizations." Now the claim made by followers of Dilthey is that this kind of understanding is what is crucially involved in the sciences of man. Does this make a difference? I think most certainly it does. For desirability-characterizations belong to a range of descriptions which lie outside what has been con sidered the limits of natural science. They violate one of the require ments which has been traditionally been seen as central to the science which emerges from the intellectual revolution of the seventeenth century, what one might call the requirement of absoluteness. (I am borrowing this term from Bernard Williams's discussion of Descartes in his recent book.) The requirement of absoluteness might be put in the following way: that the task of science is to give an account of the world as it is independently of the meanings it might have for human subjects, or of how it figures in their experience. An adequate scientific account should therefore eschew what one could call subject-related proper ties. I introduce this as a term of art for properties of things which they have only insofar as they are objects of experience of human sub jects (or of subjects of some specific kind, whatever it be). The para digm example of such subject-related properties in the seventeenth century discussion were the famous secondary properties, like color or felt heat. Color is a property of things which they have only in the experience of sighted subjects. If there were no such subjects, they would indeed continue to give off light of a certain wave length, but the phenomenal property we call color would not exist. In a universe without sighted subjects, it would make no sense to speak of things as colored. An account of things which eschews such subject-related de</page><page sequence="8">32 CHARLES TAYLOR scriptions can be called an absolute account. And it has seemed a sound principle of scientific explanation since the seventeenth cen tury that the world should be accounted for in absolute terms. For after all, it exists independently of us human percipients, and hence must be understood in terms which reflect this. There is no doubt that this principle has been sound in natural science; and since the intellectual revolution which adopted it we have seen spectacular progress in our knowledge of nature. But it is a very controversial matter whether it should be applied to the sciences of man. The issue between the hermeneutic approach and the pro tagonists of the unity of science really turned on this question. And that is why it survives untouched the demise of the peculiar concep tions of logical empiricism and the deductive-nomological model. For the claim that what I have called human understanding is es sential to the sciences of man amounts to a claim that the two kinds of science are distinguished from each other at least in this, that the re quirement of absoluteness can be made (and indeed, we all agree that it must be made) of natural science, but is inapplicable to human sci ence. For one thing which is eminently clear is that the properties described by desirability-characterizations are paradigmatic subject related properties. To understand someone is to understand his emotions, his aspira tions, what he finds admirable and contemptible, what he loathes, what he yearns for, and so on. Understanding doesn't mean sharing these emotions, aspirations, loathings, etc., but it does mean seeing the point of them, seeing what is here which could be aspired to, loathed, etc. Seeing the point means grasping the objects concerned under their desirability-characterizations. To use the language made familiar by phenomenology, under standing another person is understanding his world; it is grasping the significance of things for him. And this can only be articulated in subject-related terms. Consequently the only science of man which could meet the requirement of absoluteness would be one which could do without this kind of understanding. My thesis is that the nub of the hermeneutic claim is that this kind of understanding is essential to human science, and therefore a distinction must be drawn with natural science. It is clear that this alleged point of difference is not rendered irrelevant by a proof that the deductive-nomological model is bankrupt, or that we can't sharply distinguish between observation and theory, or that some (other kind of) understanding is essential to natural science.</page><page sequence="9">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE 33 III So the issue about the distinct status of human science turns on the question whether the requirement of absoluteness can be made of it. That this is the issue, and that it is still a live one, can be seen if we examine the kind of battle that rages within each one of the sci ences of man between protagonists of the two philosophical tradi tions. I think that a closer look makes evident that the theories of one school are in fact designed to conform to the requirement of abso luteness, whereas the other school attacks just those features which meet the requirement. It may seem to an uninstructed outsider that there is some ab surdity in imposing the requirement of absoluteness on the sciences of man; that to have a physics freed of anthropomorphism is sensible enough, but that a human science similarly purified would be a kind of contradiction. In the last analysis, I believe that the unsophisticated outsider turns out to be right. But when one examines what is in volved in applying the absolute requirement, it becomes evident both that this is what many, perhaps the majority of contemporary practi tioners, are doing and also that they have serious reasons for doing so?even if in the end (as I believe) they are wrong. They are not just carrying on blindly and unthinkingly with a formula successful in physics. Let us see what is involved. The requirement of absoluteness can be seen as the requirement to avoid subject-related terms. But understanding people in terms of the value or significance of the things in their world?the possible actions, outcomes, the situations in which they find themselves, their possible relations with others? understanding them, in other words, in terms of desirability-charac terizations, means violating the requirement. On the other hand, it is clear that we have to explain what people do at least in part by their interests, desires, aversions, aspirations, what they admire or de spise, and so on; in other words, we explain what they do by the same factors that we usually characterize in subject-related terms. An absolute science of man would attempt to describe these fac tors in a different language, one meeting the requirement. This de mands that we avoid subject-related terms, and these are terms which characterize things in properties that they only have as objects of experience of subjects. But in the sciences of man, the experience of subjects plays an indispensable role, insofar as what people believe and desire, what they admire and condemn figure essentially in ex</page><page sequence="10">34 CHARLES TAYLOR plantion. We can't do without any reference to experience at all (al though some rather dotty thinkers have believed that this was the only way to fulfil the absolute requirement, e.g., the well-known case of Skinner). But what we can do is avoid characterizing the things that surround us in terms of experience-related properties. We can operate a split, in which the things that impinge on us are character ized in absolute terms, and our experience of them or reactions to them are identified independently, and our resulting behavior is un derstood as the joint product of the two. In other words, in an absolute account of the universe including man, no one can deny that experience, too, really occurs. There are human subjects who have desires, hopes, beliefs, aversions, etc. So we have to be able to describe this; but let it be in an "intrinsic" lan guage, that is, one which identifies our desires, etc., not in terms of the subject-related properties of the things desired, feared, admired, condemned, or whatever. But these are the terms in which our language of desirability characterization is couched. We explain our friend's action by show ing how he wants to avoid self-infatuation, or how he seeks a certain integrity in his knowledge of himself, an honesty in what he projects to the world, or something of the sort. These descriptions apply to actions or ways of living, not simply to feelings or experiences. But they describe them in subject-related terms. In a world without sub jects of the specifically human kind, with language and hence moral, aesthetic, evaluative consciousness, there couldn't be such properties as integrity applied to ways of life, or honesty applied to the appear ance given to the world. These terms can't be applied to other living beings, for instance. They straddle the gap between things and our experience of them; they characterize reality, but in experience-re lated terms. The same can be said of a host of words in which we characterize relationships as desirable or undesirable: "close," "dis tant," "strained," as well as with such key terms as "love," "commu nion," "estrangement"; or the way we characterize situations: "humil iating," "fulfilling," "frustrating." What is needed to meet the absolute requirement is a way of talking about this kind of thing, but in a language which segregates reality and experience. Instead of speaking of some situation under its description as desirable, we should be able to describe it in abso lute terms. Then if we wanted to invoke this situation in explaining our action, we would have to add to this neutral description the fact that we favor this situation, that we have a pro-attitude to it. What</page><page sequence="11">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE 35 was originally encapsulated in the single desirability-characteriza tion, would now be analyzed into two components: a neutral, absolute description of the consummation we seek, and a constatation of our inclination, or pro-attitude, towards it. A redescription of this kind would meet the absolute require ment. There would be no description of the things we experience in subject-related properties. Rather we would have only descriptions of these things in absolute properties, with alongside them, charac terizations of our reactions, our feelings, our inclinations. These latter would be intrinsic descriptions of experience. Or, alterna tively put, they would describe our reactions in a "colorless" way. To expand on this latter point a little: our language of desirability allows us to define the types and nuances of our feelings, aspirations, aversions, and so on. When I know that a situation is humiliating, I know more than that the subject is averse to it; I know that his aver sion has a different quality than to a situation which is physically painful, or one which is embarassing, or one which awakens guilt in him, or unbearable pity, or which induces despair. There is here a set of alternative terms for feeling or reaction: "guilt," "shame," "de spair," "embarassment," "pity," which are correlative to and are only understood in terms of the type of situation: wrongdoing, the humil iating, the hopeless, the embarassing, the pitiable. We experience in each case aversion to such situations; we want to avoid them, flee them, prevent them from arising. But in each case our aversion is, as it were, differently "colored"; it is quite a different experience. But we specify the "coloration" through the kind of situation, de scribed as desirable (or undesirable) in a certain way. As a number of philosophers have pointed out, we cannot distinguish between the feelings/reactions here simply on the basis of the "raw feel" of the ex perience itself. The difference between, e.g., shame and guilt is es sentially that between their respective situations, not that between two different kinds of feeling, discriminable by their phenomenal quality, which we might later discover empirically to be linked caus ally to the two different kinds of situation. But to meet the absolute requirement, this kind of coloration must go. Our reactions have to be characterized intrinsically, that is, no longer in terms of the situations to which they are essentially re lated. And this means colorlessly. They are described purely in terms of their general direction, as pro-attitudes or con-attitudes to some state of affairs described in absolute terms. Now my claim is that this attempt to split our desirability-de</page><page sequence="12">36 CHARLES TAYLOR scription in this canonical way, into absolute descriptions and color less reaction terms, is very widespread in the sciences of man. For instance, the focus on "behavior" in political science is an attempt to characterize human action in neutral terms, in language purged of de sirability-characterizations. It is naturally complemented by what one could call a subjectivist view of culture, which is dominant in soci ology and political science. By this I mean a view of culture which tries to conceive it as a set of (cognitive, or affective, or evaluative) "orientations" of individuals to the (neutral) world of institutions and behavior. Behavior and institutions on one hand, culture on the other, represent the two sides of the canonical split: the neutral, ab solutely-described reality on one side, and the colorless reaction, pro or con, to this reality on the other. We see it again in naturalist conceptions of motivation, such as the various functionalist theories, where the ends defining the func tions are postulated as, e.g., survival, or social equilibrium, or social cohesion, which are supposedly identifiable in absolute terms, that is, independently of the desirability descriptions of the agents con cerned. We can see it again in the acceptance of the requirement of value freedom. But here we open up another issue: that there are serious reasons for imposing the absolute requirement. The drive to analyze away the language of desirability, to operate the canonical split, comes not just from a kind of scientistic reflex among students in a discipline which is overshadowed and overawed by the prestige of natural science. It is also because the alternative seems to run us into serious difficulty. One of the strong reasons for sticking with ab solute descriptions is that they seem to offer the hope of intersubjec tive agreement free from interpretive dispute. But our desirability terms are all articulations of our sense of what is significant in different ways to ourselves as human beings. What is a shameful situation? What is a fulfilling life? What is it to have integrity? To answer these questions, I have to draw on my sense of what is significant in human life, of what men ought to be, of what they most deeply seek, and so on. It is not just that I draw on this sense in order to determine what I consider shameful or fulfill ing. It is also that without it I have no hope of seeing what you or another finds shameful, even if I don't share this view. Indeed, with out some sense of what is afoot, I may find certain of these desirabil ity terms quite opaque. What exactly is integrity? Explain that to a</page><page sequence="13">UNDERSTANDING IN HUMAN SCIENCE 37 mediaeval knight. If his puzzlement ever lifted, it would be because he took you to be talking about honor. Such misunderstandings abound among men. Because they are articulations of what is humanly significant, such descriptions are subject to endless interpretive dispute, which absolute terms are not (or not normally) subject to. Consequently, a science which has not purged desirability terms seems open to such endless dispute concerning even1 the description of its most important phenomena. And this would seem to make impossible the kind of in tersubjective agreement which a truly valid scientific result ought to be able to win over time. A valid result ought to be valid for every body, to be replicable by all competent inquirers. But this seems jeopardized in a human science using desirability terms by the poten tial endlessness of interpretive dispute. And there is more. Desirability terms are value terms. They characterize situations, actions, relationships, etc., as worthy of real ization, or as to be shunned or avoided. But values are and will re main controversial between us. A science able to command universal consent must surely be value free. But a science which is value free must eschew desirability descriptions. Only absolute descriptions hold out the hope of real neutrality. Here are two serious (and connected) reasons for adopting the absolute requirement and operating the canonical split, which have to do with what seems to be a valid requirement on a science, that of replicability or general consent. From this we can see not only that, but also why many practitioners of human science see the canonical split as essential to the scientific status of their study. IV So an issue is drawn here around the place of human understand ing in the sciences of man, which can be more narrowly defined as one concerning the place of desirability-characterizations, or what is the same thing from another angle, the appropriateness of the absolute requirement for these sciences. It is clear where the debate ought to go from here. Those who hold that desirability language is essential have to show that the rede scription of what men desire or seek in conformity with the canonical split leaves out something crucial; that is, a) that it can't offer descrip</page><page sequence="14">38 CHARLES TAYLOR tions which are equivalents of the desirability-characterizations; and b) that what is lost in this canonical transposition is crucial to a satis factory explanation of human action in the various disciplines. I don't want to undertake either of these tasks here. (I have tried to some extent to argue these two theses elsewhere.) I wanted only to show that there is a serious issue about the distinction be tween natural and human science, substantially the one that theorists of hermeneutical science have been raising since the turn of the cen tury. It can be defined as the issue whether the requirement of abso luteness ought to be imposed on the sciences of man. There are prima facie strong reasons on both sides. For the distinction, there is the seemingly indispensable role of human understanding in any valid science of human action. Against the distinction, weighs the sacrifice of universal agreement free from interpretive dispute, and also of value-freedom, hence of the requirement of intersubjective consensus. The case against the distinction shows that it is not a trivial one, that, if valid, it would mark a crucial difference between the two kinds of science. Some of the most basic groundrules of one would not apply to the other. I think the distinction in fact holds, but whether this is so or not, it must be clear that this issue has in no way been laid to rest by the well-deserved demise of old-style logical em piricism. Indeed, even if the logical empiricists had never written, it couldn't help but arise for students of man in a scientific-technological culture. McGill University.</page></plain_text>
