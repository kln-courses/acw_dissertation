Separate copies of the PROCEEDINGS may be obtained of the Secretary or of the Publishers. 3. The Report of Publications by members of the Association since July I, I895, showed a record of books and pamphlets by over fifty-five members. To ensure the completeness of the report, it is earnestly re- quested that every member enter his publications upon the blanks to be sent out in June of each year. It is desirable that only those publications be entered on the list which have a distinctly philological character. 4. The contract with the publishers, Messrs.

V The reading of papers was then begun. At this time there were present about fifty members. At subsequent meetings over seventy members were in attendance. i. Children on the Stage in the Sanskrit Drama, by Professor A. V. Williams Jackson, of Columbia University. A motto for the paper was found in Hamlet's allusion to the children players in London in the days of Queen Elizabeth (Ham. ii 2. 330). Other instances of children on the stage in the English drama from its beginning to the time of Shakspere were brought out, and attention was called to the presence of children, as a recognized element in histrionic productions on the Greek stage, and sporadi- cally also in the Latin theatre. The investigation then turned to India. The romantic character of the ancient Hindu plays was first treated of with reference to the free non-observance of the unity of time. The plot of Kalidasa's Cakuntala was chosen as an illustration of the lapse of time during the progress of a play. The dramatic part which Sarvadamana, the little son of the hero and heroine, plays in the denouement of this romantic piece (act vii) was emphasized. Also in Kalidasa's Vikramorvaci, the character of Ayus, scion of the king, served as a good example of a youth's bringing about the happy solution of an involved play. Bhavabhuti's Uttara-Rama-Carita, a sort of Sanskrit Winter's Tale, offered parallels to Shakspere. Kuca and Lava, placed under the guardianship of the sage Valmlki, become striplings of heroic mould like Guiderius and Aviragus reared by old Belarius in Shakspere's Cymbeline; and in the sixth act these manly youths are restored to their father, Rama. In the interlude, or masque produc- tion, which is presented in the last act of the drama (act vii), the circumstances of the birth of the two heroic princes are enacted in mimic reality before the king. In this scene the banished queen appears before the audience, supported on either side by Earth and Ganges. These latter impersonations, as the paper showed from the stage-direction, were intended to be represented as holding each an infant boy in the arms (tatah pravi(aty utsangitdi 'kdikaddrakhdbhyaik prthv- ga-zgdbhydm avalambiMt sitd). In whatever manner the scene was presented, whether merely by pantomimic gesture or by some more realistic device, none the less, the notion of a child in swaddling clothes is portrayed dramatically, just as in the Winter's Tale (ii. 3) or in Terence's Andria (ii. 6-7). The royal boys whose birth the mimic play enacts, are now grown to be twelve years old, as the play tells us (act iii el al.). Like Ayus of the Vikramorvaci, they speak Sanskrit, not Prakrit. As already noted of the fakuntala, the paper observed that also in the Mrccha- katika the little Rohasena, son of the hero whose fortune has been ruined, is very young and speaks Prakrit in the climax scene where the lad is introduced. This is the scene, so full of tenderness, that gives the name 'Toy Cart' to the play. In the last act of the same drama (act x), the little fellow is again brought in to add to the pathetic situation of the last hours of a father unjustly condemned to die. The dramatic character of this scene was criticised with some detail. A parallel situation was cited from Viqakhadatta's Mudra-Rakshasa (act vii), where a child is similarly brought on the stage in the scene of the impending execution</page><page sequence="7">vi American Philolgical Association. of a guiltless father sentenced to death. In this play also the young child speaks the Prakrit dialect. One other instance of a touching r81e played by a child was adduced from KshemiTvara's Candakau9ika. The tiny boy's thoughtless and childish Prakrit prattle 'me too' (mam pi) adds depth to the heart-rending nature of the scene in which the unfortunate parents are sold into servitude (act iii), and his seeming death and miraculous restoration to life, in the last act (act v), complete the mingled woof and weft of joy and sorrow that make up the material of this noble tragi-comedy. The paper closed by estimating the importance of the r81e played by children in the Sanskrit dramas, as compared with the histrionic productions of other nations; and it favorably criticised the faithfulness of touch and the power of expression in portraying the natural love of children which the Hindu plays showed. The concluding paragraph emphasized several points of interest which the early dramas of India possess in the light of parallels that they offer to the plays of Shakspere. 2. Age at Marriage in the Roman Empire, by Professor Albert Granger Harkness, of Brown University. This paper is printed in full in the Transactions. 3. Notes on the Etymology of Atrium, by Dr. H. W. Magoun, of Oberlin, O. Probably no other word in Latin, or indeed in the classical languages, has had more etymologies proposed for it than the word atrium. No less thah seven have been seriously put forward. Two of them are Greek, a'p6ov, suggested by Becker, and atOpLov, once largely accepted, and by general consent attributed to Scaliger, who seems to have been the first to propose it. His contemporary, Casaubon, advocates this same view, and in his notes, animadversiones, p. 99, on Suetonius, Augustus, 29 (p. 37, 1. 25, atrizum Libertatis), he says: "in medio erat area sub dio, columnis cincta: ideo is locus etiam peristylium appellatur. Idem quoque i/plztuium dicebatur. Atque hoc proprie atrium est, non atrii pars: nam atrium ab at'Opov, significat locum in aedibus sub dio. Graeci v7railpov frequentius vocant: sed ai'ptov pro atrio notauimus saepe apud LXX. &amp; Iose- phum. . . . Extat &amp; apud Lucianum," etc. If these two etymologies presented no phonetic difficulties, there would still remain the question of the historical connection to be solved. It can hardly be supposed that the word came into Latin from the Greek through Tuscan and, if it did not, no other bridge appears until the fourth century B.c., which hardly gives time enough for the Romans to completely forget such an origin, as they must have done to accord with the facts. In the case of atfptov, it is clear that its adaptation to the meaning atrium, which from the late date of its appearance in Greek in this sense is plainly only a case of popular etymology from the Greek side, has led to the error of reversing the truth in a sense and supposing that atrium came from aOptopv. Ottfr. Mueller, Etrus. I. 256, draws a comparison, which might possibly be ex- pressed in the form of an equation, between the Atrias on the Adriatic Sea and</page><page sequence="8">Proceedings for JuLly, 1896. vii the atrium. He says: " Wie der Atrias am adriatischen Meer urspriinglich das Land der zusammenfliessenden Strome (Athesis, Tartarus, Padus u. s. w.) und der Sammelplatz aller Gewisser Ober-Italiens ist: so ist das Atrium der Theil des Hauses, wo das Wasser, welches auf das Dach herabregnet, im compluvium und impluvium zusammenfliesst." See Beck. Gal.2 II. p. 25I. This needs no com- ment; it is the conception of a poet or a Donnelly. Festus, quoted by Paulus I. 12, gives two alternatives. The first agrees with Varro, cited below, to which he adds: vez quod a terra oriatur, quasi aterrium. This also may be passed over. Isidor. 0 -. XV. 3, 4, says of it: dictum est atrium, quod addantur ei tres por- ticus extrinsecus. Aliis atriurm quasi, etc., which may well be classed with the etymology proposed by Mueller. The other view which he proceeds to give is the same as that of Servius cited below. Varro, L. L. V. i6I, says: Atrium appellatum ab Atriatibus Tuscis; i.e. from the Tuscan town of Atria, a suggestion which is plausible, although Casaubon ridicules it with others, loc. cit.: "Varronis aliorumque veterum notationes quis non rideat?" Varro's view, however, carries with it more than seems probable. If the etymology is correct, the Romans either had no atrium at all or none properly speaking until the Tuscan form of building was adopted. The first supposition is contrary to the natural development of the doamus from the casa: in fact all building everywhere seems to have begun with the tent or hut or cave having a single common room to which others were added in the course of time. The second supposition restricts the application of the word originally to the Tuscanicumi, which Mau (Marq. Privatll. d. Rm?.2 I. p. 223, n. 4) believes to be the meaning of Varro. But this involves both the question of the date of the adop- tion of the Tuscan form of building, which Goll (Beck. Gal.2 II. p. 253) thinks may have become general after the burning of Rome by the Gauls (390 B.c.), and the name applied to the original living room of the early Romans before the Tuscanicum became common. It also leaves such expressions as atrium Vestae to be accounted for and presents other minor difficulties. Such questions as these, which may never be finally settled, manifestly cannot be included within the scope of the present paper. Servius, Ad Aen. I. 726, in speaking of the atrium, says: " Ibi et culina erat: unde et atrium dictum est; atrum enim erat ex fumo." Strangely enough, Becker (Gal.2 II. p. 251) says of this etymology: "Servius zu Aen. I, 730 leitet es gar vom Rauche ab:" but Servius plainly gives the word a history similar to that of the Greek i\XaOpov, and by so doing allows a very early origin for it. The extreme probability of the correctness of this view has now led to its general acceptance; see Marq. Privalt.2 I. p. 218. It is, moreover, a curious fact that Varro himself indirectly supports this etymology; for he derives the masculine form from the same stem. lie says, L. L. VIII. 451: alia [nomina] a vocabulo utab albo Albius, ab atro Atrius. 4. The Problem of the Atriolum or the meaning of the word in Classical Latin, by Dr. H. W. Magoun, of Oberlin, O. The atriolum, so far as has been noted, is mentioned but twice in Classical Latin, and both passages are in Cicero: ad Att. I. 10, 3: praeterea typos tibi</page><page sequence="9">viii American Philological Association. mando, quos in tectorio atrioli possim includere, et putealia sigillata duo,; and ad Qu. r. III. i, I, 2: quo loco in porticu te scribere aifunt ut atriolum fiat, mihi, ut est, magis placebat. Neque enim satis loci videbatur esse atriolo, neque fere solet nisi in his aedificiisfieri, in quibus est atrium maius, zec habere poterat adiuncta cubicula et eiusmodi membra. The word also occurs in an inscription; a few times in the LXX., and occasionally in the writers of mediaeval times; but these passages do not materially affect the question. Both of the citations occur in the Letters, and it may perhaps be inferred that the usage was colloquial. It appears from Cicero's words that the room was adorned with figures on the walls; had a puteal, cubicula, etc.; and was in short very similar to an ordinary atrium. The natural inference is that it was merely a second atriumt of smaller size than the first. Metcalf concludes (Beck. Gal. p. 253), that it served as "an antechamber to a greater hall, peristylium with a porticus," and that the atriola " were only to be found in large mansions." Marquardt finds in Pliny, Ep. II. 17, an explanation of their character, and his position is accepted by G611 (Beck. Gal.2 II. p. 246) as sound. He assumes (Privatleben d. Roa.2 I. p. 223, n. 4) that the D-shaped porticus with their included area formed the peristylium of Pliny's villa, and that the cavaedium hilare must have been identical with the atriolum which Q. Cicero wished to join (anlegen) to the porticus. (This notion that the D-shaped porti- coes fortned the peristylium was suggested as early as 1832, Lib. of Entertaining Knowl., Pompeii, II. p. 8, footnote, issued by Soc. for Diffus. of Use. Knowl., and the suggestion seems plausible except that peristylia were regularly rectangular in shape, or at least their sides were straight. According to Vitruvius, VI. 4, they should be a third part longer than wide, and be placed transversely.) The resulting villa, if Marquardt be followed, would be of a very unusual construc- tion : first, an atrium with its vestibulum; then, a peristylium whose area was very small, parvula, ' a little bit of a one '; next, a small atrium; and behind this, a triclinium or oecus. Nothing of the sort appears to have been found, and it is doubtful whether it ever will be; for an interior atrium, where there is an exterior one, seems to be an anomaly, and an atriolum is merely a small atrium. Of the twelve conjectural plans of the villa, which I have been fortunate enough to collect (Scamozzi, I615; Felibien des Avaux, I699; Castell, 1728; Marquez, 1796; Hirt, 1827; IHaudebourt, 1838; Schinkel, I841; Bouchet, 1852; Burn [after Hirt], 1871; Cowan, I889; Winnefeld, 1891; and Magoun, I894) not a single one can be regarded as favoring the view of Marquardt; for in no case is the cavaedium represented as smaller than the atrium, which it must be, to be the atriolum (cf. Cicero's statement), and four, including the two latest, regard the cavaedium hilare as a peristylium. Now it appears that there were porticoes in villas besides those in the peristylium,; for Vitruvius, in giving the arrangement of a country villa, says, VI. 8: ruri aultem psezudourbanis statimn peristylia, deinde tunc atria habentia circum porticus pavimentatas spectantes ad palaestras et ambulationes. Moreover, in the passage from Cicero upon which Marquardt bases his theory, no perislylium is mentioned. In fact the word does not occur in either epistle; but in the preceding section he says: villa mihi valde placuit, propterea quod summnam digfnitatemn pavimentata porticus habebat:. and again, in the other passage just preceding the citation above, he says: Signa nostra . . . velim imponas, et si quod aliud oiKELov . . . reperies, et maxime, quae tibi palaestrae gymnasiique videbuntur esse. Etenim ibi sedans haec ad te scribe-</page><page sequence="10">Proceedings for July, 1896. barn, ut me locus ipse admoneret. The conclusion seems plain that Cicero and Vitruvius refer to the same porticus (both pavimentatae), and, if so, the supposi- tion of Marquardt falls to the ground; for the porticus in question had nothing to do with the peristylium, which was entirely distinct, and lay, according to Vitruvius, next the entrance, i.e. in the place of the atrium, which in turn took the place of the peristylium. The D-shaped porticus of Pliny may perhaps have stood in some such relationship to the atrium (the whole arrangement is appar- ently old-fashioned, and does not correspond to the rules of Vitruvius, who puts the peristylium first, as has been said), in which case the peristylium still remains to be accounted for, and should be in the position assigned to the cavaedium. It is probable that it was identical with it, as I have elsewhere endeavored briefly to show (Proc. Amer. Phil. Assoc., Dec., I894, p. xxxiv f.). It is hardly to be sup- posed that a villa would be erected in which both styles of building were com- bined; that is too modern; and, if the new style were followed (peristylium first), and then a second atrium were added later as a sort of vestibule (he men- tions the vestibulum distinctly, and a few have supposed that he uses the term as synonymous with atrium), it would be natural to suppose that this would be the atriolum rather than the one in the interior of the house (cf. Cicero's statement again). It seems more reasonable to believe that both atrium and atriolum should be banished to the rear, where that form of construction was used, and that both should be in the front part of the house when the regular form was retained, as must frequently have been the case. Two atria in one house were common enough to judge from Pompeii; but there they both opened upon a street. So far as I can discover, no interior room of this description has been found. It has been supposed that two atria in one building resulted from the purchase of an adjoining house which was then partially torn down and united with the first (cf. Cic., De Of. I. 39); but it also held by Mau (Marq. Privatl.2 I. p. 22I, n. I) that two atria were sometimes built in a single dwelling inten- tionally, and the position seems reasonable. How, then, were the two distinguished in ordinary speech? At Pompeii, they lie side by side as a rule, though the house of Lucretius has its second atrium in a sort of aisle opening on a side street; each has its cubicula, etc., and one is always larger and apparently finer than the other. The peristylium generally lies beyond, and commonly extends along the inner end of the larger and a part of that of the smaller, though it sometimes lies between the two next the street, as in the house of Castor and Pollux (house of the Quaestor), which seems, however, to have been a double house. One atrium, the larger, seems to have been intended for clients; the other, for slaves and freedmen, though it may possibly have been part of a hospitiumn. What could be more natural than to suppose that the larger, with which the tablinum is regularly connected, was the atrium, properly so called, while the other was the atriolutm, ' the little atrium '? Some such distinction seems inevitable, and it would appar- ently soon be easy to associate, in common speech, the term atriolum with a sim- ple, plain atrium of small size, since the smaller of the two at Pompeii appears to have commonly been of this character. It often happened also that it was built in the Tuscan fashion, while the larger, or atritum maius, was tetrastyle or Corin- thian in its construction; at least that is the case in several instances at Pompeii. Here then is the solution of the riddle, and Cicero says in effect that it is not customary to place an atriolum in houses [of the wealthy] unless they also con- ix</page><page sequence="11">x American Philological Association. tain an atrium maius, or atrium properly so called; for the atria of men of Cicero's standing had become very fine in his day (cf. Cic. In Ver. I. 23 and 56), and to him and to his family an atrium of the common sort would be merely an atriolunm. It is probable, therefore, that there is nothing strange or peculiar in the question at all. The atriolum was the smaller of the two atria often found; Cicero had two atria in his villa; and Quintus, having none (cf. villa of Diomedes at Pompeii), talked of putting a little one (the space was small) into his. (The porticus may have been arranged somewhat as the cryptoporticus in the villa or Diomedes at Pompeii was; see Guhl and Koner, L. of G. and '. p. 373.) He was then gently told by his brother that it was not good form to do so, unless he also had one worthy of his position in life (cf. Vitr. VI. 8); for that is practically what is meant by the implication that it would not be in good taste to have an inferior atrium (at/riolum) unless there was also a main atrizum{ (atrizum maius), with which was connected the tabli/num. When the position of the wealthy Romans of Cicero's day is remembered and the part which their elegant atria and tablina played in the politics of the time (cf. ibid.), it can readily be seen that to omit the fine ahtiumi and insert a plain small one, would be regarded by them much as we should regard the plan of building an aisle and omitting the main house. 5. The Origin of the u form of f3lTa in Greek MS., by Dr. W. N. Bates, of the University of Pennsylvania. The development of the forms of the letters used in Greek minuscule writing is as a rule not very difficult to trace. The letters for the most part do not differ very greatly in form from the same letters written in capitals, so that the connec- tion between the two either reveals itself at a glance or becomes apparent after a few moments of study. With one letter, however, such is not the case. I refer to the peculiar form of jTra found in Greek manuscripts of the eighth and ninth centuries which resembles our letter u printed in italics. This character has no resemblance to the early capital B or to the later minuscule 3 and yet was the prevailing character for P3iTa for several centuries. It is the object of this paper to show how this form of the letter originated. In the various works on Greek palaeography little or nothing is said about this form. Most of the writers simply record it without making any attempt at expla- nation. Wattenbach 1 and Gardthausen 2 have made attempts to explain the form but the absence of evidence at the time when they wrote made their attempts at explanation little more than guess-work. In the Herondas papyrus, however, which was published in I892, there are some interesting forms of /3^ra which make it possible to supply the missing links and show how the form developed. Including the fragments the letter 3rjTa occurs in this manuscript I40 times, and in 117 of these cases the letter is perfectly clear. The forms vary greatly and are apparently used promiscuously, no one form being used alone in any one portion of the work. I have arranged them in what appears to be in a general way their order of development from the capital B. The figures in parenthesis 1 AnZeitung zzur Griechischen Palaeographie, 2d edition, p. 30. 2 Grzechische Palaeographie, p. 184.</page><page sequence="12">Proceedings for July, 1896. xi denote the number of times each form occurs; only letters which are perfectly distinct are counted. They are:- i. B (12); 2. 'Bor (9); 3. L(:4); 4. 6(I6); 5. 0 (12); 6.1(4); 7.- (4); 8. d (o); 9. &amp;(4): 10. A(27); Ir. L( (o); 12. (5). Numbers 8, 9, and IO are closely related forms. No. 9 is simply a variation of No. 8, and No. IO differs from No. 8 in having the two down-strokes start from two points side by side instead of from a single point. In No. 3 and more clearly in all the following forms we find the principle which explains how the u form originated. The scribe is trying to make a rlTra in two down-strokes. No. II, and still more plainly No. 12, is nothing more or less than the u of the minuscule alphabet, No. 12 being an exact counterpart of the earliest form of the letter in parchment manuscripts. Previous to the discovery of the Herondas papyrus no example of this form appears to have been known earlier than the sixth century. It is now proved to have been in use at least as early as the third century of our era and no doubt continued to be used along with the capital form until in the seventh century it began to be the prevailing one. The reason for the adoption of such a form is apparent. On papyrus a down- stroke of the pen is much easier to make than an up-stroke, and the attempts of the scribes to make a i7rTa rapidly in two down-strokes resulted in the forms shown above. When the change in writing material was made from papyrus to parchment there was no longer the same need of a letter which could be made with two down-strokes, but this form had become established and passed into minuscule writing with the other letters of the alphabet. The fact that in the earliest minuscule manuscripts this letter had twice the height of the other letters seems to show that its origin had not at that time been forgotten and that the right-hand part of the character was still felt to represent the right-hand part of capital B. The five examples of U as P7ra in the Herondas papyrus occur in column I8, line 2; column 22, line I8; column 27, line 14; column 30, line 5; column 37, line i6. 6. Notes on Lucian, by Professor Francis G. Allinson, of Brown University. I. Lucian, Timon, ? 18: w'crrep {K KOrlVOV TeTpvJr-qggvov. The edd.1 find this hard to explain. If Ko0/ivov be retained, may it not be here used in the rare sense of a liquid measure (see ad Strattis Kin. I)? This interpretation has not before been suggested, possibly because the meaning ' basket' is so much the more usual one. It seems probable, however, that Lucian wrote KOcKlvoV. The reference to the jar of the Danaids immediately follows and it is probable that Lucian had the conventional imagery of the myth in mind as we find it in Plato, Gorgias, 493 B, where the Danaids carry the water in a perforated sieve to a perforated jar. Cf. the account Rep. 363 D, where also the sieve is used to carry. Lucian would thus have here the sieve (K60-KLOv) as well as the jar (7riOos), both of which 1 e.g. Hemst. Vol. I. p. 374; " vix ac ne vix quidem intelligo." Williams, pp. 211, 212; "to this notion (i.e. of a liquid) 'basket' is abhorrent." Mackie, p. 113: " K61bvoS = rrLOo, = a tub (sic!) with a hole in it."</page><page sequence="13">xii Amecrican Philological Association. are necessary to complete the figure. For the combination with this verb cf. his KoOKLtvrlbv &amp;areTpvr?oTOat, Sat. Epist. 24. For the variant ptc. from rerpalvco and rpvTraw, cf. the parallel pass. Dial. Inf. II, ? 4. Compare this, in fact, throughout with Plato. Finally, as an indication that Plato's words were in Lucian's mind, cf. orreyav6v of the Gog-ias with /A' rT7yOVTOs in the 7'imon an(l r-TIyeiv ov bvvaue'vov in the citation from Dial. Inf The interchange of cK and 0 is obviously easy. 2. Gallus, ? 22: U7repplrs Tr OpYKtiov &amp;top6vas TrOv roiXov. The roLxwpvXos is a familiar acquaintance, but what does v7repI3ds etc., mean? Were the houses of the rich constructed with sloping roofs and openings under the eaves, or above the wall, corresponding to the enclosed metopae of a temple? The two well-known Euripidean passages may be compared. In I. 7. 113, Pylades points out that there is room for a man to let down his body between the triglyphs, and in Orest. I37I a slave escapes by one of these apertures. Unless reference is here made to some such opening, - usual, perhaps, for the sake of the light, -the alternative meaning would seem to be an entrance effected through the tiles or opening of the flat roof itself. Cf. N. T. Luke 19. The translation, 'lorica domus superata' (Reitz-Hemst.) assumes that rb OptyKiov was a parapet built around a flat roof. But would not Lucian have used some less vague expression, such as 6r1a Ttc Kepda/Lwv, or 8a&amp; TrjS aryT, if this had been his meaning? Hermann (Lehrbuch d. griech. .4ntiq. IV. p. I54, note 2) says: "der Giebelbau des Tempels ist ohne vorgangige private Bauweise nicht denkbar." This passage also may indicate that the slanting roof was not monopolized by temple architecture. 3. Icaromenippus, ? 13: e7rt rT7 Ka7rvolS6Krs, 'over (or ' at') my smoke-vent.' Reitz's translation, 'in fumario,' is, I think, clearly wrong. Pauly does better: 'unter meinem Rauchfange ein Trankopfer darbringen.' But why not take not only KaTrvo66K-7 but also the preposition in the most literal sense and give a more burlesque, and therefore more probable, coloring? Icaromenippus promises that, alighting on his roof, he will pour a libation over (iri, not 'unter') the smoke-hole, that it may be wafted up to Empedocles. To illustrate cf. the two passages in Herodotus where Karrvoao6K7 is mentioned. In VIII. I37, the sunlight streams in KaTra rjv Ka7rvo86K7qv (evidently here a mere hole in the roof). In IV. 113, e7r- with the gen., Lucian's exact expression, is used. Herod. here represents the Taurians as transfixing their enemies' heads upon a pole and setting them up on their house-tops and by preference over the smoke-vent - adXtrr' e7rt rijS Ka7rvo86KjS. Lucian could not have missed this passage in Herodotus. In Icaromenip. ? 25, Zeus seats himself at one of the scuttles (irl- rjs 7rp7SrTs) in heaven's floor and bends over it to catch the incense. To illustrate this and the whole meaning of Ka7rvo6bK?7, one could wish for the context in Pherec. Tyran- tlis, 2, where Zeus out of thoughtfulness for the ' altar loungers' 'made for them a very large smoke-vent.' However the much-debated chimney-question, Ar. Vespae, I39 sqq., may be decided, it would not interfere with this view. Even if a real chimney be under- stood here, the translation 'over the smoke-vent' would, I believe, be the best; the burlesque element is in either case the same.</page><page sequence="14">Proceedings for July, I896. 4. Use of 6rt Ij. In oU68v y&amp;p 6rT jh, Somnium, ? 9, 'rSt 1x means ' nothing but,' and Icaromenip. ? 9, ' nothing else.' Williamsl annotates these two passages as instances of Lucian's careless use of A, for ou, and refers to Professor Gildersleeve's article, A. f. P. Vol. I. I. Heitland2 also, although stating that 6rt is here the neuter of 6-rts, says: "It will be noticed that the uO is, as often in Lucian, unbearable." This use of 6Tr 0!77 (= 'except') is expressly mentioned by Gildersleeve (l.c.) as 'well known and legitimate,' and is used as partially explaining the extension of the combina- tion elsewhere. In addition to the examples of this use of 6rt A?', cited from Homer, Herod., Thuc., Plato, and Arrian, in L. and S. (vide sub 6oT (neut. 6frts) II.), may be added (from Abicht's Herod.) Herod. II. 13 and 50, and (see La Roche, II. XVI. 227) Herod. I. 183, III. 155 and 160; Thuc. IV. 94. 2, VII. 42. 6. Lucian may, therefore, be here relieved of the charge of being 'unbearable.' 5. The Arrangement of Guests in Lucian's Symposium (see the plan on p. xiv). Reitz3 and Wieland4 assume the triclinium arrangement. A careful reading of the text will contradict this assumption, and the accompanying plan is intended to meet the conditions in the text, viz.: (I) In ? 8 Lucian says: "On the right as you entered, the women - and they were there in full force - took up all that bench, and among them the bride," etc. (2) ?? 8, 9. "On the side over against the door the rest of the company, each according to his rank. And first, beginning opposite the women, Eucritus," etc. [Twelve banqueters are here named.] (3) These twelve with Dionicus and Alcidamas, who arrive later, are the only men expressly mentioned, and Reitz and Wieland in their arrangement assume that there were no more. Certain expressions, however, imply that there were other guests in the company. Cf. ?6. " Why should I tell you of the others? It is chiefly about the philosophers, I think, and the litterateurs that you want to hear." Again, in ? 35, Lucian clearly implies that there were others besides the philosophers when he says: "The laymen (ot itWTrat) dined in a very orderly fashion." The single candelabrum (r XvXviov) --which in ? 46 is overturned, leaving the company in utter darkness-may, however, seem to forbid the as- sumption of any large number of guests, and the seeming contradiction involved in fwCra elt'eKEK6bftTo (? 15) is to be explained as a reference to the separate lamps placed on the several trays of the large holder. (4) The uninvited cynic Alcidamas is urged by the host to take a chair by Nos. II and 12. (5) Dionicus the last comer, although invited, had no place reserved for him after the signal to lie down was given. He therefore squeezes in (? 20) near, or next to, No. 12. (6) From direct mention (? 38) we learn that each pair of banqueters had a separate small table. I C. R. Williams, Selections from Lucian, John Allyn, I882. 2 W. E. Heitland, Somnzum, etc., Cambr. Un. Press, I885. 3 Cf. Vol. IX. p. 359, where, too, he speaks of Histiaeus and Dionysodorus as lying ' in tertio lecto ultimi.' This would imply that there were no other banqueters beyond: but see below (3). 4 Wieland says: 'Ieder von diesen Triclinien hatte seinen eigenen Tisch,' but we know from the text that there were six small tables for the twelve male guests first mentioned. xiii</page><page sequence="15">x .?

Only some such arrangement as that here proposed can meet the requirements of the text. The question of the length of the couches and whether they were placed closely together or continued on around the left-hand end of the room must, I think, be left open. In regard to the place of honor 1 a word may be said. The rich old father of the bridegroom - the guest of honor- lies first of all and next above the host - thus combining two of the points mentioned by Plutarch (Quest. Sympos. II. ? 4 and III.). The bridegroom, too, might be regarded perhaps as in one of Plu- tarch's places of honor. He comes ueo-alraros so far as the twelve guests ranged along r6 avrlOupov are concerned. Becker, or the reviser (Charik., Goll's revis- ion, 1877, Germ. ed. Vol. II. p. 305), makes a curiously vague or inaccurate statement. He says: "Auch bei Lucian (Conv. 9) liegt der Briutigam neben dem Schwiegervater und Wirth." As a matter of fact he lies (No. 7) five places below them. 7. A Study in the History of German Metrics, by Professor Julius Goebel, of the Leland Stanford Jr. University. I. Accent. Among the German grammarians of the sixteenth century who made the first attempt at a scientific inquiry into the nature of German versifi- cation, Johann Clajus (I535-92) takes the principal place. In his Grammatica Germanicae linguae (1578) he devotes two chapters to German metrics in which he exhibits a clear understanding of the vital differences in verse-structure that separate the Germanic languages from the ancient tongues. Besides, he defines in the same chapters with remarkable precision the law upon which the metrics of all the Germanic languages are based: the law of accent. While the critical efforts of Clajus produced little effect upon contemporary German versifiers, the little book by Martin Opitz, Buch von der deutschen Poeterey (1624), also marked an epoch in the history of German metrics. In the seventh chapter of this famous book he says:- 'Nachmals ist auch ein jeder Vers entweder ein Iambicus oder Trochaicus; nicht zwar, dass wir auf Art der Griechen und A'omer einze gewisse Grisse der Sylben konnen in acht nehmren, sondern, dass zuir aus den Accenten und dem 7'hone erkennen, welche Sylbe hoch und welche niedrig gesetzt soil werden.' It seems that Opitz in establishing this fundamental fact concerning German metrics did not know of Clajus. Nor is there any evidence of the influence of Opitz on Friedrich von Spee, who, in the preface to his Trutznachtigall (written previous to 1635), makes the same discovery of the law of accent in German versification. Spee goes even beyond Opitz and approaches the modern view by claiming that the accent of the verse must be that of the living speech. 'Die 1 Jowett's trans. of earXarov, in Plato's Synmfosiumn, as ' at the end of the table' is infelicitous for other reasons and possibly misleading to the English reader acquainted only with the Roman arrangement of the tables.</page><page sequence="17">American Philological Association. Quantitat aber, das ist die Liinge und Kiirtze der Syllaben ist gemeinlich vom Accent genommen, also dass diejenigen Syllaben, auf welche in gemeiner Aus- sprache der Accent fallt, fiir lang gerechnet seind und die andre fur kurtz.' For more than a century the influence of Opitz's book made itself felt in a great regularity of German versification, a regularity too painfully regular for the genius of the German language. The negative result of Opitz's rules-that verses constructed after the principle of quantity were impossible in the German language - found, however, less attention than one would expect from poets and the writers on metrics. This becomes evident especially during the eighteenth century when the revival of Humanism kindled the desire of imitating the much- admired Greek metres. Happily the great poets like Klopstock, Goethe, and Schiller were possessed of too fine a feeling for the genius of their language to allow themselves to be ruled entirely by metrical law-makers like Joh. Hein- rich Voss. Still we can notice in their metrical practice a constant struggle between their German Sprachgefii/l and the rigid requirements of the classical metricians. We have an amusing document of this in the famous strophe by Goethe: Ein ewiges Kochen statt fr6hlichem Schmauss! Was soil denn das Zahlen, das Wagen, das Grollen? Bei allem dem kommt nichts heraus, Als dass wir keine Hexameter machen sollen, Und sollen uns patriotisch fiigen, An Knittelversen uns begnugen. In 1832 Lachmann's famous essay, Ueber althochdeutsche Betonung und Vers- kunst was published, a treatise which, by a careful inquiry into the nature of accent, laid the foundation for all the future investigations of Germanic metrics. Starting from the fact that in all the Germanic dialects the principal accent is placed on the first syllable of every word, Lachmann establishes the following laws of accentuation: - (I) Wenn in drei- oder mehrsilbigen Wortern des Alt- und Mittelhochdeutschen die erste, d. h. die betonteste Silbe lang ist, so hat die zweite den nachsthohen Accent; (2) ist dagegen die erste kurz, so hat die dritte den Nebenton. Although later investigations modified and corrected these laws, by their dis- covery, Lachmann was enabled to unfold the secrets of Old-Germanic versifica- tion, especially in Otfrid and in the Iildebrandslied. Starting from the verse of Otfrid, Lachmann pointed out that the Old Germanic verse consisted of four arses or accents, showed why the thesis in certain cases could be omitted, and, by a careful examination of the various parts of speech, established the rules which governed the position of the accent. An excellent account of Lachmann's prin- ciples, supplemented by original research and subtle mretrical observations, may be found in the Deutsche Verskunst nach ihrer geschichtlichen Entwickelung by Vilmar-Grein (I870). While Lachmann had confined himself chiefly to the word-accent, Max Rieger in his essay Die Alt- und Azngelsdichsische Verskunst (Zeitschzr. f deuttsche Phil. Vol. 7) made the sentence-accent and its relation to Germanic versification the object of his investigations, reaching the result that alliterative verse had but two and not four accents. xvi</page><page sequence="18">Proceedings for July, 1896. II. Rhythm. The importance of rhythm for Germanic versification was not recognized by the writers on metrics during the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies. Our knowledge of the nature of rhythm and its relation to metrics has a history like that of the accent. The first attempt at a scientific treatment of rhythm in German versification I believe is found in the Zeitmessung der deutschen Sprache (I802) by the same Joh. H. Voss, who must be considered the strictest advocate of ancient metrics in German versification. In'the chapter Vom Verse (p. 170) he says: - Der gemessene Gang des Verses, worin eine Folge ausdrucksvoller Bewegungen zu einem harmonischen Ganzen sich vereinigt, muss fur sich ohze Worte gedacht werden. .. . Ein Versmass also oder ein Metrum heisst uns eine rhythmische Composition der man zutreffende Worte unterlegt. A revolution was caused in the history of German versification, when, in 1870, R. Westphal published his Theorie der neuhochdeutschen Metrik. Proudly he could say in the preface of the first edition: Bisher sind die rhythmischen Formen der deutschen Poesie noch in kein System gebracht. Selbst den Begriff des Verses zu bestimmen hat bisher unserer Aesthetik nicht gelingen wollen. He begins his discussion with a careful analysis of rhythm, the nature of which he finds in motion (Bewegung), and which he defines as the order of time in which this equally measured motion takes place. While his predecessors had always treated of single feet, of verses composed of feet, and strophes composed of verses, Westphal discards these terms by saying: - Wollen wir uns iiber unsere Metrik wirklich ins Klare bringen, so diirfen wir nicht mehr mit den drei Kategorien: Versfiisse, Verszeilen, Strophen operiren, sondern mit folgenden vieren:, mit Tacten, mit rhythmischen Reihen oder Gliedern, mit Perioden, mit Strophen. Westphal's theories were in their essential features verified and supplemented by Briicke in his little book Die physiologischen Grundlagen der neuhochdeutschen Verskunst (I871). For the history of rhythm the chapter on Versaccent (p. 5) in Briicke's book is especially interesting, for it is here that he makes the discovery of the change of rhythm in the same verse or strophe. He says: der Wechsel des Rhythmus in einem und demselben Systeme der Versification ist nicht nur erlaubt, sondern hiiufig sogar geboten und Niemand wird z. B. Anstoss daran nehmen, dass in den folgenden Trochien zuerst der Ictus auf der ersten Arsis der Dipodie liegt, dann aber ein Wechsel eintritt, so dass der Ictus bei sachge- miissem Vortrage auf die zweite Arsis der Dipodie fiillt:- Keine hat wie ich im Herzen Immerdar dein Bild getragen, Eine Braut war ich im Geiste, Wars in Wonne, wars in Thranen. Briicke's fundamental discovery was soon afterwards applied to German lyric poetry of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by W. Brambach in his excellent little pamphlet Ueber die Betonungsweise in der deutschen Lyrik (I871). Bram- bach shows that without the various changes of rhythm, the rhythmic construc- tion of the German lyrics of the last five centuries cannot be understood, saying: es haben sich Eigenthiimlichkeiten in der .nordnung (ler Hebungen bis in unsere xvii</page><page sequence="19">xviii Amcrican Philological Association. klassische Zeit erhalten, welche ihrem Ursprung nach auf die Technik des Vers- baues im 15. und I6. Jahrhundert, und weiter ins Mittelalter zuriickgehen. Auch unsere klassischen Dichter gestatten noch eine zweifache Accentriickung: erstens unterbrechen sie die Folge von Hebung und Senkung durch einfache Umkehr, es wird z. B. eine trochaiische Betonung eingemischt, wo das Accentschema eine jambische verlangen wiirde, zweitens riicken sie Hebungen an einander ohne die enlsprechende Senkuk&gt;ng einzulegen. The influence of these theories and discoveries concerning rhythm beginning with Westphal, may also be noticed in the famous recent attempt of Sievers, which aims at a systematization of the rhythmic forms of old Germanic allitera- tive poetry (cf. Sievers' A4ltermanische Metrik). Sievers' theory is known as the 7ypentheorie, or the theory of certain types of rhythm which he claims to have discovered for the first time. I believe that I am in the position to show that the various forms or 'types' of rhythm, named A, B, C, D, E by Sievers, were already known to Lachmann, as is made evident by the latter's accentuation of the verses of the [Iildebrandslied, from which I quote below, giving at the same time Sievers' accentuation of the same verses.

Heribrantes sunu Heribrantes sunu To be sure, Lachmann does not speak of these various forms of rhythm, nor does he anywhere attempt to systematize them, but he evidently had them in mind when he said in the essay on the Hildebrandslied (cf. Kleinere Schriften, I. 414): So entsteht bei sehr strengem Rhythmus eine grosse Mannigfaltigkeit der Betonungen; zwei bis vier hochst betonte Silben auf Hebungen, und, sind ihrer nur zwei oder drei, noch zwei oder eine ebenfalls starke Hebung, ferner vier schwachere Betonungen auf den iibrigen Hebungen, alle diese Betongungen in villkiirlicher Ordnung. I will add in conclusion, that previous to Sievers the various forms or 'types' of rhythm in the alliterative verse had been systematized by Grein in the Deutsche Verskunst (1870) quoted above. He says in ? I8: Bei zwei I-aupthebungen</page><page sequence="20">Proceedings for July, 1896. sind es die erste und dritte (Type A) oder die erste und vierte (Type E) oder die zweite und vierte (Type B) oder endlich die zweite und dritte Hebung (Type C); and in ? 20 he adds: das zuniichst aus Otfrid erkannte Gesetz fur die Stellung der Haupthebungen (? I8) gilt aber ebenso auch fur die althochdeutsche Alliter- ationspoesie. 8. An Important Side of Aristophanes' Criticism of Euripides,' by Professor H. Rushton Fairclough, of the Leland Stanford Jr. Univer- sity. Aristophanes' most concentrated criticism of Euripides occurs in the Frogs, where he makes Aeschylus recite parodies upon the choral songs and melodies of the younger poet.2 According to the commentators the following points are to be noticed in the parodies: (I) The general confusion of the scenes; (2) the trivial objects and circumstances; (3) the niisuse of rhetorical figures; (4) the unnecessary repetitions; (5) metrical and musical innovations. These additional features, however, should be observed: (a) The prominence given to the sights and sounds of external nature, e.g. vines and grapes; the sea, rivers, and dewy3 water; the halcyons chattering, the spiders spinning, and the dolphin at his gambles. In Euripides the botanical world plays a much larger part than in Aeschylus or Sophocles. He revels in meadows and grassy glades, forests and groves, fruits and flowers, and some of his plays, like the Bacchae, Iolt, and Phoenissae, are permeated with the beauties of hill and field and dale. More varied and abundant, too, are his references to birds, insects, and animals, wil(l and domestic,4 and in some of these allusions he displays a peculiar tenderness.5 More conspicuous, too, in him are streams and rivers, which are often invested with considerable sentimental interest. (b) The invocation and the characterizations of night (11. I33I, I335, I337). Some of the most beautiful characterizations of night and day to be found in all Greek literature are in Euripides.6 Picturesque night scenes are also frequent.7 (c) A reference to Euripides' fondness for various expressions for darkness 8 and light. (d) A hit at Euripides' fondness for color (v. irplpais Kvuatetb6Aot, I. 1318). Euripides indulges in more frequent references to color and has a wider range of color-vocabulary than either Aeschylus or Sophocles. He is fond, too, of contrasting different hues.9 I This paper will appear in full as a chapter in The Attitude of the Greek Tragedians toward Nature, published by Rowsell and Hutchison, Toronto, Canada. 2 Ran. 1301 ff. 8 Sp6aos of water is very common in Euripides. 4 His allusions to the horse, cow, dog, and sheep are nearly twice as frequent as those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together. r Cf. [ou I79, El. 151, Iph. T. o089, Tro. 669, etc. 6 Tro. 847, Ion 1150, Fr. 593, El. 54, Or. 174. 7 Rhes. 41-3, Tro. 543, 547, Ale. 450, Iph. Aul. 6. 8 v. Kve4abo;, 1. 1350. Besides Kveua;og (found once in Aesch.

On the other hand, Euripides is even more lavish than Sopho- cles in his use of terms that denote brilliance and splendor, and he has a wider vocabulary. o Cf. Iph.

The sentimentalism, therefore, for which Aristophanes assails Euripides con- sists largely in a proneness to minute and toying descriptions of external nature. Euripides lived at a time when the old Greek spirit was giving way to the new, and men were becoming more reflective and introspective. There were also peculiarities in Euripides' own life and circumstances which must have largely affected his tone and character. He was a recluse, of artistic sensibilities and wedded to books. Hence his sentimentalism. The Greeks were not a sentimental people, but had a practical, common- sense, objective way of looking at things. Aristophanes, a man of the world, regarded the new spirit as unnatural and unmanly, and though he himself appre- ciated keenly the beauties of nature, he did not regard tragedy as a fitting vehicle for the expression of such sentiments. The most romantic of Euripides' plays, the Bacchae, - a drama which exhibits a deep love for nature, - was composed amid the wilds of Macedonia, where the poet's spirit had free range and the emotions were unchecked in expression by the sneers of hostile critics. The Bacchzae and the Frrgs have much in common, and no doubt Aristophanes had learnt much of the character of the Bacchae before that play was exhibited in Athens. The Secretary then read an invitation to a reception on Wednes- day, July 8, extended to the Association by Professor and Mrs. Albert Harkness. The invitation was accepted. The Committee, consisting of Professors Allen, Gudeman, and Plat- ner, which was appointed to report a recommendation concerning a uniform standard of Latin Orthography for the use of School Text- books, then reported through its chairman, Professor Allen. Discussion of the report was postponed. Adjourned at 6.Io P.M. EVENING SESSION. At eight o'clock the members, together with a large number of the citizens of Providence, assembled in the Lyman gymnasium to listen to the address of Professor March, the President of the Association.' The speaker was introduced by Professor Albert Harkness, of Brown University, who welcome(d the Association on the occasion of its second meeting at Providence. 9.

Professor March was one of the founders of the Association, and its President in 1873-74.</page><page sequence="22">Proceedings for Jly, I1896. The speaker referd to and commented on filological studies of literature, mostly found in the publications of the Association, belonging to the following classes. STUDIES FOR THE ACCUMIJLATION OF SCIENTIFIC DATA. i. The enumeration and classification of the words in literary masterpieces according to the grammatical forms; as, so many hundred subjunctivs, or con- junctions, and the like. 2. Similar studies of the historical etymology; as, so many Anglo-Saxon words, so many Norman, and the like. 3. The once-used words. 4. The oft-used words. 5. The words used for the first time. 6. Words of sensation, for colors, sounds, and the like, to build up the world of a story as it appeard to the author. 7. Accumulation of descriptivs applied to a natural object, as the ocean, the sun, and the like. 8. Studies of syntax, classification and enumeration of the different kinds of sentences, periods, paragrafs, in a literary work. 9. Studies of rhythm and meter; classification and counting up to establish authorship, as in Shakespeare and Homer. STUDIES OF INTERPRETATION. Io. Of simpl sentences as gems of thought. (a) To clear up the precise meaning of the words; (b) to gather up the accumulated associations of the vital words. Ii. Of the whole utterances of characters in pictures of life, as of Hamlet, Caliban, to realize the characters. 12. Of the whole works of an author, to realize his character and his en- vironment. 13. Of the literature of a nation to read the character of the nation. I4. The comparativ study of national literatures to lern the character of man, his best, his worst. Most of these essays ar naturally works of curious investigation and reserch. The scolars who produce them labor harder on books for simpl utility, lerned editions of important literary works, concordances, grammars, and dictionaries. Child's Ballads, Furness's Shakespeare, Abbott's Shakespearian Grammar, Schmidt's Shakespeare Lexicon, Murray's Historical Dictionary of the English Language, - the greatest filological work of our generation, - bring the filological labors of hundreds of investigators within easy reach of all students of literature and language. The dictionary of English dialects, the first number of which is just printed at Oxford, is another great work for the science of language. The complete con- cordance and dictionary of Chaucer, which the Early English Text Society has been so many years cherishing, is at last redy in manuscript, a more valuabl work than even the Shakespeare Dictionary. The next thing is to get it printed. We shal soon hav the opportunity to make our subscriptions for it. xxi</page><page sequence="23">xxii American Philological Association.

The President appointed the following committees: On Auditing the Treasurer's Report: Professor Albert Harkness and Dr. Sewall. On Time and Place of Meeting in 1897: Professors C. L. Smith, Lodge, Clapp. On Officers for I896-I897: Professors Allen, Seymour, Owen. Professor Allen then explained the Report on Latin Orthography. After discussion it was moved to print a summary of the Report in the Proceedings. The chairman gave the Committee's reasons for confining its report to School Text-books proper, -the grammars, lesson-books, and elementary editions which serve for the first introduction to the study of Latin. In such books, if anywhere, a conventional standard of orthography may be desirable. The authors first put before young pupils are Caesar, Cicero, Vergil -perhaps also Sallust and Cornelius Nepos. All are writers of the end of the Republic or of the first years of the Augustan age. The Committee thought it wholly impracticable -for the present at least-to print these authors, for learners, in the spelling of their own times, as exemplified in such inscriptions as the Lex Julia Municipalis, and the Lex Rubria (45 and 49 B.c.), and the newly discovered inscription relating to the Secular Games of 17 B.C. It was shown that this would necessarily involve not only such forms as quoius, quoi, equos, relinquont, aestumo, but also servei in the nominative plural, and serveis in the dative and ablative plural. Although the latest of the above-named inscriptions, cut two years after Vergil's death, no longer adheres strictly to this use of ei, still we have reason, it was urged, to sup- pose that Vergil's own spelling was more conservative than that of this inscrip- tion. The report then proceeded as follows:- Your Committee is clear that, as a standard for elementary books, it is best to adhere to the tolerably uniform system of the first century of our era, and that in particular the spelling of the Monumentum Ancyranum - thought by Mommsen to be that of Augustus himself-may well be to us a sort of pattern, so far as it goes. This system is, in truth, only a little later than that which we have been describing. We shall then write servi in the nominative plural, servis in the dative and ablative plural; optinmus, aestimo, lacrirna, cuius, cui, curm; vultus</page><page sequence="24">Proceedings for Jily, 1896. xxiii and servus. As regards the most crucial point--the use of uu, vu--it should be said that this spelling did not prevail all at once. From Quintilian 1 it appears that uo, vo were affected by conservative schoolmasters as late as the middle of the first century, and this statement is borne out by inscriptions - for instance by the laws of Malaca and Salpensa in Spain, from Domitian's time, in which divom, vacuom, etc., occur. We should then have warrant for voltus and servos. Nevertheless it is certain from the Monumentum Ancyranum2 that uu, vu were in good use early in the century, and the practical advantage of having uniform endings, -us and -urn, is so great that it should turn the scale in favor of this spelling. A middle course -voltus, volnus, but parvus, perpeetus - which we find pursued in several recent schoolbooks, seems to have no historical justification. It is more difficult to decide what to do with -quu-, as in equus, reliquus, sequuntur. It chances that no words involving this combination occur in the Monumentum Ancyranum. Brambach believed equus to be of equal age and respectability with divus, and thought that its adoption, as part and parcel of the standard orthography of the Empire, was necessary. He was obliged, however, to except quum and quur, as non-existent forms, and he was unable to deny the correctness of the spelling with -cu- (ecus, secunlur) in the other words con- cerned. Notwithstanding Brambach's defence, -quu- has fallen into much dis- favor among Latinists, and, as your Committee incline to think, with justice. The combination is of the rarest occurrence in inscriptions of any period. Newer and more careful researches have made it probable that it was never much else than a theory of grammarians, who sought to remove an apparent irregularity in the paradigms of inflexion. We may refer to the discussions of Stolz (Histor. Gramnre. I. p. 254), and of Lindsay (Latin Language, p. 86 f.), both based on Bersu's collections.3 There seems to be little doubt that -quo- passed, in the course of the Augustan period, into -cu- (sometimes written -qu-4), but never into -quu-. The Committee accordingly think that ecus, relicus, secuntur, relin- cunt, parallel to cum, cui, cuius, are the begt forms for our elementary books. In like manner exstingunt will be the third person plural of exstinguo. It will, of course, be necessary to provide in our grammars for this replacement of -quu- by -cu-, but this does not seem difficult to do. Respecting the assimilation of prepositions, it is clear that no hard and fast rules can be laid down, and that a wooden uniformity would not represent ancient usage. The Monumentum Ancyranum has conlegium and collegium, impensa and inpensarum, immortalis and inmissa. The inscription about the Secular Games has similar doublets. There is room to doubt whether ef- for ex- (effugere, eficere) was in use at the time of Augustus' death. At any rate there are significant traces of ecferre and the like in the manuscripts of both Cicero and Vergil. But the evidence is not clear enough to warrant a reversal of the customary spelling. It is hard to know what to recommend about ob, ab, sub before s and t. Yet there can be little doubt that the usage of the early first 1 I. 7, 26. 2 annuunm, riv[um, vivus. 3 P.

The Committee furthermore suggests the use of the contracted genitives conle^i, fluvi, etc., the avoidance of final / for d (set, haul, aput, etc.), and the sparing use of ch, th, ph in Latin words (it will perhaps be safest to restrict this to the four words named by Cicero as those in which he gave way to the inroads of secondary aspiration).2 Incohare should be so spelled. This word occurs in the Monumentum Ancyranum. We may add that the above recommendations require little break with current usage as shown in the most carefully prepared text-books. A word is perhaps desirable respecting the accusative plural of the third declension. Otto Keller, in his second volume Zur lateinischen Sprachgeschichte has given us a fresh discussion of this subject, with full statistics of the occurrence, in inscriptions and manuscripts, of the endings -es and -is. From these statistics he deduces, for adjectives and participles,3 the rule that -is is the only proper form for all words, whether original i-stems or not, which have -iurm in the genitive plural, and -es the proper form for those which have -urn in the genitive plural. This rule he considers applicable to the Augustan poets and the prose- writers of the Republic. The encroachment of -es upon -is he believes to have begun in the Augustan period, but he thinks that the poets, at least the older poets of this period, were not affected by it. The Monumentum Ancyranum, however, shows evident traces of this encroachment; it has labenles, omnes side by side with agentis, omnis. In view of these facts, the Committee feel some uncertainty; but bearing in mind the advantages of a fixed usage, we recom- mend, with some diffidence, conformity to Keller's rule, at least so far as adjec- tives and participles are concerned. Respecting another question of some practical importance, the use of j and v, the Committee are unable to make an unanimous recommendation. One member is in favor of discarding both these modern devices, and accustoming the learner from the outset to distinguish i and u consonant from i and u vowel as Roman boys were obliged to - by sense and surroundings. Another thinks that a system which fails to differentiate volvit from voluit is too hard for the beginner, but he dislikes j and v, as tending to fix and perpetuate the notion that the Romans had separate letters for vowel and consonant, and would like to see in use i and u with some diacritical mark, which might be dropped in all but the most elementary books. A third member of the Committee would adopt i forj, but would continue to distinguish v and u by separate letters. This use of v withoutj has been resorted to in a number of recent schoolbooks. The incon- sistency has this practical justification, that the difficulty of distinguishing vowel and consonant is greater with u than with i. 1 Quintil. I. 7, 7. 2 Orator, 48, i6o. 3 In substantives -es is more prevalent, and the rule does not always hold. The most that Keller asserts is that all which have (or can have) -i in the ablative singular, either have or can have -is in the accusative plural. Substantives in -x have -es. For many individual nouns, however (as aedis, finis, hostis, turris, mons, gens, pars, etc ), Keller allows only the accus plur in -is. The Monumentum Ancyranum has, it may be observed, aedes, fines, and gentes. xxiv</page><page sequence="26">Proceedings for July, 1896. io. The Origin of Sigma lunatum, by Professor John H. Wright, of Harvard University. This paper is printed in full in the Transactions. It was discussed by Professors Smyth, Allen, and by the author. ii. A Discussion of Catullus LXII. 39-58,' by Dr. Charles Knapp, of Barnard College. The author's purpose was to show that in vv. 45 and 56 dum . . . dum are correlatives, to be interpreted as literally = "the while . . . the while," i.e. as equivalent to quam diu . .. tam diu. This view is not new, having been held by Quintilian (ix. 3. I6), Haupt, Riese, Baehrens, Schmalz, and Hale. Its rejec- tion, however, by such recent editors as Ellis and Merrill justifies a new examina- tion of the whole passage. Further, the author claims to have supported the old view by a line of argument never before brought to bear on our passage. Strong exception was taken to the method adopted by both Ellis and Merrill in their attempts to interpret this passage. Both seek to determine the text and the reading of v. 45 by an appeal to v. 56. This the author held to be a complete reversal of the proper method. He came thus to the statement of his main point, which was that more attention must be paid to-the form of the poem than has been accorded to it by recent editors. Several scholars -e.g. Ellis, Riese, and Baehrens-call attention to the amoebean character of the poem, but none of them makes adequate use of this point in its criticism and interpretation. Attention was then called to the fundamental law of amoebean poetry, namely, that the utterances of the second speaker should correspond in form and contents to those of the first. See Conington's introductions to Vergil's third, seventh, and eighth Eclogues, and Page's prefatory note to HIorace, C. iii. 9. In Edl. iii. the amoebean dialogue covers 48 vv.,-each competitor delivering twelve strains of two vv. each; in Ed. vii. we again have 48 vv., divided into twelve strains of four vv. each. Every one knows how admirably Horace obeyed the law in the poem referred to. The author then asked, How far did Catullus obey the law in this poem? The carmen amoebaeunm proper consists of vv. 20-59. Originally there were three pairs of stanzas. The second of these is now mutilated beyond recovery; only six vv. (32-37) remain. We may therefore leave this portion entirely out of the discussion. The first strophe and antistrophe contain five vv. each, besides the refrain; no trace of incompleteness can be discovered. The third strophe and antistrophe originally contained, it is probable, ten vv. each, besides the refrain. See Riese and Baehrens on v. 41. We may conjecture, therefore, with much probability, that in the matter of form this carmen amoebaeum obeyed the first law of such compositions. Turning to the language, we note at once striking correspondences between the several strophes and antistrophes. In vv. 20-24 the girls say, " How cruel thou art, Hesperus, to tear the maiden from her mother." The lads reply (26- 30), "How kind thou art, Hesperus, to give the maiden to her lover." Each utterance consists of three sentences: a question in one v., a relative clause in I See Classical Review, X. 365. XXV</page><page sequence="27">xxvi American Philological Association. three vv., and a second question in the concluding v. These final questions are clearly examples of amoebean "tit for tat." In our passage (39-58) the strophe (39-47) forms a single sentence, composed of two clauses correlated by ut and sic. Each clause falls into two parts, with adversative asyndeton at the joints, i.e. at vv. 43 and 46. In the antistrophe (49-58) the structure is the same, save that in v. 54 the conjunction is expressed. (See further, Carl Ziwsa, Die eurhyt/l- misc/e Technik des Catullus, II. Theil, pp. 11, 12, Wien, 1883.) These resem- blances in the language strengthen the hypothesis accepted above, that in external form there was originally complete correspondence between the parts of the song. The author dwelt thus on the amoebean character of the poem because on that he rested his special line of argument. His points were: (i) We have here a good specimen of the carmen amoebaeum; (2) the law of such carmina is that the leader sets the pace to which the other must conform; (3) here the girls lead; and hence (4) their utterances must in each case be perfectly intelligible, when taken by themselves. At v. 49 the lads were bound to reply to the girls; they were bound, furthermore, to do this in ten vv., and the form of their deliv- erance must be as like as possible to that of the girls. It is self-evident that to accomplish this task at all it was necessary for them to understand in every detail what the girls had said. So in our reading of the poem we must put ourselves in the position of the lads by interpreting vv. 39-47 by themselves, and then we must apply the same line of interpretation to vv. 49-58. The author then proceeded to analyze vv. 39-47. Vv. 39-44 he paraphrased thus: Dum fios intaclus est, carus est pueris et puellis; sed cum tactus est, non carus est, etc. When one reads sic in v. 45, his natural expectation is that the correlating clause will itself be broken into two parts, corresponding exactly to those of the u/-clause. These can readily be found, since diam inlacta (virgo) manet = dum flos inlaclus est of our paraphrase, and dum cara suis est, if taken as Quint. interprets it, is a complete correlative to carus est fjos, etc. Again, v. 46, which = sed cun virgo tacta est, corresponds exactly to v. 43, which = sed cum jfos tactus est, and v. 47, which = virgo non cara est pueris et puellis, is cor- relative to v. 44, which =ftos non carus est, etc. If this stanza be interpreted by itself, its parts can be arranged in no other way. The beauty and flawlessness of the poet's workmanship are then self-evident. The author then presented his objections to the views of Ellis and Merrill. The former says: " Sic may well contain the predicate optata est implied in the protasis of the simile," etc. A sufficient answer is the fact that the protasis of the simile contains not merely optata est, but non oplata est as well. If, then, est be supplied at all after sic, we must take as its predicate the whole contents of the protasis, not a part, as Ellis has done. The same argument disposes of Merrill's view, which is thus expressed: "The two dume-clauses are not correlative, but co-ordinate, both modifying sic VIRGO (sc. est), while sic is emphatic, referring to v. 42. Thus v. 45 corresponds alone to vv. 39-42, while vv. 46-47 correspond to vv. 43-44." Sic must refer not to v. 42 alone, but to all that is contained in vv. 39-44, and the predicate to est must, as already urged, be the whole contents of those six vv. Thus, v. 45 would correspond, not to vv. 39-42 alone, as Merrill would have us believe, but to all the vv. 39-44. In that event vv. 46-47 would be wholly unnecessary and therefore weak, and the perfect artistic balance which we obtained before would be wholly destroyed.</page><page sequence="28">Proceedings for July, 1896. We may now without trouble apply the same line of interpretation to vv. 49- 58. We may paraphrase again: Dum vitis intacta est, non cara est; sed curm tacta est, cara est. This is balanced by Dum virgo intacta est, non cara est; sed cum tacta est, cara est. V. 56 means simply: "So the maiden, the while she remains intacta, the while she grows old uncared for." The paper closed with a brief consideration of the question whether dum . . . alum could bear the meaning assigned them throughout the discussion. On this point the author had nothing new to offer, but contented himself with compiling, more completely than has heretofore been done, a list of the authorities by whom this view has been defended and illustrated. Quint. ix. 3. I6 explicitly upholds it, implying that it is an archaism, a very plausible suggestion. The only parallel thus far cited is P1. 7'ruc. 232, where Lambinus' reading Dum habeat, dum allet is "accepted or repeated by Hand, C. F. W. Miiller, Fleckeisen, Schwabe, Sch11, and Key, L. D., s.v." (Ellis, p. 248, footnote). See also Haupt, Opusc. II., p. 473; Riese and Baehrens in their editions; Schmalz in Miller's Handbuch, II2., p. 509; Hale, Anticipatory Subjunzctive, pp. 68, 69; and finally the critical note in the Goetz-Loewe-Sch6ll edition of the 7'Tuculentus. Both Riese and Baehrens cite by way of illustration Verg. Ed. viii. 42 Ut vidi, utperii, referring to Savelsberg, Rhein. Mus. XXVI. (1871), p. 135, the latter adding Corssen, De pronunt.

It was discussed by Dr. H. W. Magoun, and by the author in reply. I3. Euripides, Hlippolytus, 42, by Professor Francis Kingsley Ball, of the University of North Carolina. Se&amp;o 8e lro7eCL 7rpayita, Kd.KCavr'7aTaL. The plot of the Hippolytus is set forth in the prologue by Aphrodite: Those who do her homage she puts first in honor; but she throws down all who act presumptuously toward her (5, 6); Hippolytus declares that she is basest of deities, and will pay her no regard (13, 14); she means to be revenged upon him (21, 22). Her plan of revenge she proceeds to explain. Phaedra, the [second] wife of Theseus, is deeply in love with Hippolytus through Aphrodite's designs (26- 28). This shall be made the means of accomplishing her purpose (41: dXX' o7vr TrazrT r6v8' gpwra xp Tree?vv). But how? Why, Theseus shall be informed of the affair, and he will curse Hippolytus and put him to death (42-44). But be informed of what affair? Certainly Theseus will not kill his son because Phaedra is enamored of him. Xxvii</page><page sequence="29">xxviii American Philological Association. Wecklein explains that the verse is general in its signification (the matter shall be made public; and I will see that it reaches the ears of Theseus). Mahaffy and Bury follow Wecklein, and say further, " Euripides does not add that it was to be represented in a false light, for his prologue is only to give a sketch of the plot, not to enter closely into the details." Wilamowitz says that the uninformed hearer can expect nothing from these verses but the guilt of Hippolytus. Wilamowitz, however, is not entirely right. If we join his note with that of Mahaffy and Bury, we shall arrive at what ought to be the conclusion drawn by the uninformed hearer or reader, namely, that either Hippolytus does wrong or his father is misinformed, the latter of which proves to be the truth. Doubt as to the outcome of the play ought to begin, really, with verse 41, where Aphrodite proposes to make use of Phaedra's infatuation as a means of destroy- ing Hippolytus. Hiller and others object to the verse on the ground that it is contradictory to the issue of the play: Aphrodite does not reveal to Theseus the love of Phaedra for Hippolytus. To remove the apparent contradiction, Weil suggests the reading 6e^at 5 earet 7rpayxLa. Other readings proposed are as follows: Ir cps U8 dei'w 7rpaySua (Bar- thold); 7jr1 8 8eto 7rppayAka (Fecht); Metow 8' o X\-et 7rpaoyLa (von Arnim); and, perhaps the most noteworthy, that of Wilamowitz, BeiLw 8 O0Jaows 7rat8i, KadKfavo-Je?ra. Wilamowitz points out that Aphrodite states what takes place immediately and at the end of the play, but leaves out the middle part, namely, the aversion of Hippolytus and the slandering of his character by Phaedra. On the other hand, we have, in favor of the MSS. reading, the following con- siderations: - I. The reading eitw 80 077-?e has the support of all the MSS. without any variant. 2. The meaning is not really inconsistent with the development of the play. It is true, as has been objected, that it is Artemis who reveals to Theseus the love of Phaedra for Hippolytus. But is this what is referred to in verse 42? Not at all. Verses 41-44, though obscure, have but one explanation, as is shown by the development of the plot. " I will use Phaedra's infatuation," says Aphrodite, "to overthrow Hippolytus. Theseus shall hear of the affair (7rpay7/a), and he will curse and destroy my foe." Let us follow, now, the development of her plan: Phaedra at first concealed her love for Hippolytus (394), but finally revealed it to her nurse (350-52); the nurse informs Hippolytus, and is reviled by him (565-90); Phaedra, now that her love has been revealed (596), wishes to die (599), and hangs herself (777); Theseus finds a letter on Phaedra's person (856), in which she accuses Hippolytus (874-86); Theseus bids Hippolytus begone from the country (973); Hippolytus' death is reported (1162); Artemis informs Theseus of the innocence of Hippolytus (1298, 1299) and of the infatua- tion of Phaedra (1303). It is clear, then, that the prologue is not really inconsistent with the develop- ment of the play, as the information given to Theseus by Artemis is of a sort to clear Hippolytus from censure, while that referred to in the prologue is intended to work his ruin, and reaches Theseus by means of the nurse's revelation to Hip- polytus, which causes the writing of the letter and the suicide of Phaedra; - all caused directly or indirectly by Aphrodite, the author of Phaedra's infatuation.</page><page sequence="30">Proceedings for July, 1896. The apparent inconsistency, already referred to, that the prologue does not state exactly what takes place in the play itself, may find a parallel in the Ion. We are informed by Hermes, in the prologue of the Ion, that Xuthus and Creusa, being childless, have gone to consult the god at Delphi (64-67); Apollo is to present his own son by Creusa to Xuthus when the latter enters the temple; Xuthus is to take the boy to Athens, where he is to be made known to Creusa and obtain his rights (69-73). The development in the play, however, is as follows: Creusa is greeted by Ion at the shrine at Delphi (237); Xuthus, on returning from the neighboring oracle of Trophonius (405), meets Ion in the temple and greets him as his son (517); an explanation takes place, and Xuthus bids Ion go to Athens (577); the chorus is commanded to reveal nothing to Creusa on a penalty of death (666, 667), but they tell her everything (761 if.); Creusa wishes to kill Ion, as she thinks herself wronged by Xuthus (979), but her plan fails (1194 ff.); Creusa recognizes Ion by the garment in which he was exposed when an infant (I395 ff.); -the recognition taking place at Delphi, and not at Athens as told in the prologue. 3. The reading 6eitcw 8 e0i7e maintains the line of thought better than any other reading suggested. Nobody, to my knowledge, disputes the genuineness of verse 44. This verse helps out the MSS. reading in 42. The line of thought is this: " Phaedra loves Hippolytus; this infatuation is good for my purpose; Theseus shall hear of the affair; he will destroy Hippolytus; Phaedra shall die." Theseus is the one to be informed because the one most concerned. When informed, he will kill Hip- polytus, -not of course because Phaedra is in love with him, but for one of the reasons given above, namely, that Hippolytus is guilty, or that he believes him guilty. Suppose we read, with Wilamowitz, 6e18w 0-to-ows 7raL5l. Then the line of thought is: "Phaedra loves Hippolytus; this is my opportunity; Hippolytus shall know it; his father will kill him; Phaedra shall die." By following the MSS. we are left in doubt as to the real cause of Hippolytus' death; but by following Wilamowitz we can arrive at only one conclusion, and that erroneous, the guilt of Hippolytus. Furthermore, Aphrodite does not give the information to Hippolytus any more than she gives it to Theseus. To both it comes indi- rectly- to the one, through the nurse; to the other, through Phaedra's letter. To conclude: The objections to the reading &amp;8elw 8i eo-ea 7rpay,ua are not well sustained. I think the reading should be retained, (a) because it has the unanimous support of the MSS.; (b) because it is not really inconsistent with the plot, does not force us to an erroneous conclusion, and may be paralleled in Euripides' own works; (c) because it is suited to the context.

Harrington, of the University of North Carolina. Although, unhappily, it is quite beyond our power to estimate accurately all the debt of Roman literature to early Roman tragedy, it is clear that the tragedies xxix</page><page sequence="31">American Philological Association. of Livius Andronicus, Naevius, Ennius, Pacuvius, and Accius were quite largely responsible for at least the following effects: I. The awakening of an interest in Greek literature and the cultivation of literary taste. 2. A dissemination of knowledge of Greek mythology. 3. A metrical revolution. 4. The develop- ment of a polished literary standard of forms, syntax, and style, which is rendered more noticeable when compared with the colloquialism of comedy. 5. The enrichment of the language by the coinage of new words. The purpose of this paper is to determine as far as possible to what extent, and along what lines, the language and literature of Rome were enriched by the word-coinage of these early tragic poets. The period from Livius Andronicus to Accius was the great formative period of Latin. The Romans were suddenly awakened to the fact that their language was a rough and primitive instrument for the expression of the exact, the delicate, the picturesque idea. The early tragic poets must therefore have been constantly hampered, among other difficulties, by the lack of suitable words with which to convey their finer shades of meaning. We must acknowledge at the start the limitations within which we are com- pelled to work. We seldom, if ever, can attain mathematical certainty with regard to the author of a word, and the date of its genesis; for some earlier writer, whose works are lost, may have used it. Moreover, a large proportion of the meagre tragic fragments that we do possess have been preserved to us merely because they contain in each instance some unusual word. Again, the condition of the text sometimes leaves us in doubt. Having frankly admitted, however, that we may look for only a varying degree of probability in our conclusions, we may take courage from the following facts: I. The old Latin grammarians frequently leave us no reasonable ground of doubt. 2. A comparison of the original Greek in many cases makes it nearly certain that the word arose then and there as a translation. 3. A large number of words bear on their faces the stamp of mere linguistic experiments that were never imitated. 4. A reasonable regard for the laws of word-derivation in Latin and a constant comparison with what seems to have been taking place in that line in each period of the language will enable us to keep our conjectures from going too wide of the mark. In the preparation of this paper Ribbeck's collection of the fragments of the tragic writers has been used for the text; but, as a rule, conjectural readings have not been taken into account. LIVIUS ANDRONICUS. There are but 42 verses or fragmehts of his tragic writings extant. Of the IO words which appear to have more or less claim to be considered the creations of Livius Andronicus, 3 are transliterations from the Greek, 4 are new compounds, I is a new form of derivative, and 2 are new adverbs. Not a single one seems to have become very common in the language, and 2 (g of the whole number) never occur again. More of the new words are new compounds than are found under any other head. The proportion of new words is nearly one to every four fragments of verses. Two (simeus and inhumigo) seem worthy to have endured. XXX</page><page sequence="32">Proceedings for July, 1896. NAEVIUS. In the case of Naevius more new words occur in his comedies and his Bellurn Punicum than in the tragedy fragments; with the former, however, we are not now concerned. There appear to be about 17 new words in 65 verses, the percentage being but a trifle larger than in Livius Andronicus. Of these, 6 (more than 3) are taken from the Greek, 5 are new compounds (3 of these being of the poetic picturesque type), and the others are new derivatives. Although but one of this list is surely a &amp;7rac Xey6tuevov, most of them seem to have been confined to the ante-classical period, except in so far as they were revived in comparatively late Iatin. It is perhaps noteworthy that there are more Greek words in the Cam- panian Naevius than in the Greek slave Andronicus. It was worth while to use valentia, which might well have held its own against the more cumbrous vale- tudo; and of course such words as szavisonum and frondifer deserved to be repeated often by succeeding poets. ENNIUS. With Ennius the field of our investigation widens. There remain of his tragedy over 400 verses or fragments. Here the proportion of new words appears to be much smaller than in the two preceding writers, there being but 42, or about I in io. A study of these, however, brings out several points of interest. I. There are only 2 Greek words in the list. Ennius was too great a poet to borrow his diction extensively from the Greeks. 2. On the other hand, there are about 20 new compounds (about I of the whole number); there are also several derivative verbs and nouns in -men and -menurn. 3. The i7ra~ Xey6bseva number 7; signitenens and velivolans are typical poetic descriptive words, sueh as every true Roman poet in the earlier period coined; blandiloquentia and visceratim are strong words and deserved the better fate of being incorporated in the permanent body of the language; obvaro and augifico seem rather needless compounds; but hariolatio is a word that has no good equivalent, and could ill be spared. 4. Derivatives like hostimentum and peniculamentum apparently did not meet with a favorable reception. Compounds in -ficus and -fico seem to have been overdone, e.g. in the case of augifico and regifice. 5. Quite a number of these words coined by Ennius became the lasting possessions of the language, such as: exalbesco, flammifer, velivolus, deflagro, reciproco, regimen, inauratus, optumates, pervicacia, nearly } of the whole number. 6. Several more were used by the early poets after him, influencing the whole language through them, and then, falling out of use for awhile, were taken up again in the post-Augustan or post- classical period, such as: propitiabiis, derefpente, nitido, elimino,.jacceo, ezisce- ratus. 7. Ennius was not conservative in the form of words, as is evidenced by his variant forms in the case of common words. So, for instance, he uses cae- mcenla (f.), but caementum (n.) was the form that endured; similarly sanguen for sanguis, veter for vetus; further we find velivolans and velivolus side by side, the latter of which endured; and tabum was added to tabes, and both endured. 8. It is not easy to see why such words as expectoro, allisonus, scrupeus, con- vestio, and conglomero should not have cut a more important figure in the later language. 9. If, on the whole, Ennius coined fewer words than might have xxxi</page><page sequence="33">xxxii American Philological Association. been expected from his unique position in Roman literature, his efforts were on sounder lines, and the effect on the language of his successors is discernible at once, particularly in the line of expressive compounds. PACUVIUS. The bulk of fragments of the tragedies of Pacuvius is little greater than in the case of Ennius; but the proportion of new words is considerably larger, the total number of 66 being nearly one in 6 verses. Furthermore, we discover at once a marked tendency to experiment with the language, not only on the lines already followed by Ennius, but on others, in some of which none had led, and few would follow. An examination of the complete list of words brings out the following facts: I. Only one Greek word occurs. 2. Nine compound adjectives, all the way from the picturesque tardigradus to the monstrous incurvicervic:ts, and 6 compound verbs illustrate an increasing tendency. 3. The most striking phenomenon, how- ever, is the appearance among the derivatives of not less than 17 new abstract nouns, 6 ending in -tas, 8 in -tudo, and 3 in -or. These range from the indis- pensable to the fantastic, from unanimitas to anxitudo; and remind one of the two periods in the development of the English language (one immediately after Chaucer, the other during the "revival of learning") when it was the fashion to produce such words as ' facundious,' 'pulcritude,' 'consuetude,' 'mulierosity,' 'solertiousness,' etc. Various derivative verbs (some 13 in all) should be added here, especially 4 inceptives. 4. Other words include but 3 adverbs, and do not need especial notice. 5. That Pacuvius was an experimenter who went too far to be cordially and thoroughly imitated is evident at once from the fact that 25 of these 66 new words never occur again. On the other hand, quite a number found a permanent place in the language. Of course Latin did not need pro- lixitudo and concorditas; and geminitudo and matresco were plainly called for only by the occasion. But there was undoubtedly a place for mollitudo and tirmi- ditas, while bonifer and globosus could hardly be spared from the working force of the language. Although the verse containing the two enormities, incurvicer- vicus and repandirostrus, is commonly cited to prove the devotion of Pacuvius to outlandish compounds, a careful search fails to discover good ground for the charge. 6. Tardigradus is worthy of Lucretius, and should have endured. The same is true of macor, taetro, cornifrons, and abjugo; while unanimitas, largfii- cus, and flexanimus certainly deserved a more extended use than they ever enjoyed. 7. On the whole, the inference can hardly be avoided that the com- plete works of Pacuvius would doubtless show extensive contributions to the language along the well-established lines of composition and derivation. Accius. In Accius the total number of new words is larger than in any of his prede- cessors in Roman tragedy; but, the number of verses being about 700, the 78 words do not bring the percentage up so high as was the case in Pacuvius, and not much above that of Ennius. Of those 78 words, 25, or nearly 1, are d7rca Xey61,eva. Accius evidently followed the general tendencies already observed in Pacuvius.</page><page sequence="34">Proceedings for July, 1896. I. We find no case of borrowing from the Greek except the imitation of rerpd- roXts, quadrurbem. 2. Among new compounds, the adjectives number 6, the verbs 9, and the nouns 2. There is an apparent falling off in the coinage of the picturesque descriptive adjectives; sonipes endured as a poetic word; while such compounds as taurigenus and fallaciloquus were doomed to retirement. But disicio, allido, oblittero, and eniteo were valuable acquisitions to the language. Such a noun as vitisator, used later by Vergil, is hardly more than an epithet. 3. The craze for new abstracts has not died out yet. There are 12 in -tas, and I I in -tudo. Vastitas, crudeli/as, and stupidilas were useful additions; magnitas, honestitudo, and that ilk, are mere doubles of words already in common use; while noxitudo, nitiditas, and the like, did not secure the stamp of popular approval. Of the derivative verbs the inceptives in -sco continue to be the most noteworthy additions; yet most of them died a speedy death. Such formations as vastesco and sanctesco do not seem in harmony with the genius of the language. There were, however, several useful derivative verbs, like divito and locuplelo. 4. The list of derivative adjectives shows the largest increase of any, including I words, of which exspes, fr-elibundus, vorax, and praefervidus endured. 5. Indecorarbilier is the only new adverb and that a d7rat Xey6uTevov. 6. Appe- tisso, delitor, celebresco, perfremo, tabificabilis, orbifico, and taetritudo might well have endured. 7. Accius illustrates pretty well what was to be expected from one who kept up to the mark of word-coinage set down by his immediate prede- cessors. There are fewer fanciful forms, but a more earnest effort to broaden the language and to give parallel forms to many already existing words. The lan- guage did not, however, in most cases, care for doubles of this kind, and hence it is that so large a proportion of his new words perished at once. In the somewhat more than 600oo fragmentary verses of Roman tragedy we find, accordingly, 213 words which there is more or less reason to consider coined by the tragic writers. Of these, 55 (or a little more than 1) never appear again; and of the rest, a good-sized majority never came into very common use. This fact may appear a little disappointing at first thought, but we have already seen that the conditions under which we study this question are such as to bring the rarest words into special prominence. And even those which did not themselves become a permanent part of the language, exercised an indirect influence that cannot be estimated. Not only did the tragedians set the pace in word-building, but also scores of their new words were accepted and incorporated in the lan- guage. It is remarkable, considering the source of this body of dramatic litera- ture, how few Greek words (not over 18 in all the fragments) were borrowed. It indicates a better self-denial and a keener industry than we have sometimes been inclined to credit to these writers. It was rather in the lines of the expressive compound and the timely derivative that we find the tendencies most marked. Probably the least valuable fashion was that of multiplying ponderous abstract nouns, which seem particularly out of place in poetic composition. Tragedy showed the Romans how to write dignified Latin poetry, combining beauty and feeling, and marked out plainly the line along which the vocabulary of each author should enrich the language in a perfectly rational development. In the main the succeeding Roman writers followed suit. The greatest failure to measure up to the possibilities before them was in the expressive composition of words. Such word-painting as we find in Ennius and Pacuvius might have been xxxiii</page><page sequence="35">xxxiv American Philological Association. continued by the poets that followed, and extended indefinitely; and geniuses like Lucretius and Catullus made good use of the example. But, as in English, by non-use the facility of such composition was rapidly diminished, and the lan- guage lost here much of its flexibility. Remarks were made by Professor A. G. Harkness and by Dr. Knapp. Adjourned at I2.45 P.M. AFTERNOON SESSION. The Association reassembled at 3.15 P.M.

Notes on the ve:vla of Peisandros, Aristophanes, Aves, I553- 1564, by Professor B. Perrin, of Yale University. This is a parody on the vPKvta of Odysseus, full of Homeric reminiscences. The X\ivrl is the 'OKeavos of K 508, X I3, w II, and the unwashed Socrates as /tvXacywyos answers to the Hermes of w. Peisandros takes the rale of Odysseus in X, and goes down to the confines of Hades to consult his own spirit, not that of Teiresias. As a sacrifice, - the ram and black sheep of Odysseus, Peisandros has a camel-lamb. IHe sacrifices it, then like Odysseus turns away (d7ri'X6e I561), when up there comes to him from the lower world-Chairephon the Bat (so called as the spirits of the suitors are compared to bats w 6 ff.). In I561, noting the surprising lack of correspondence with X 36 ff., commen- tators almost universally suspect or correct dirXO\e. Kock's earlier Kaao-To, and his later KarT\XOe are fair examples of corrections made to restore correspondence with Homer. But the a7ri\X0e of Aristophanes is faultless in its tradition, whereas X 35-49 shew clear signs of alteration from an original context which corresponded minutely with K 526-536, the forerunner-passage. At just the 'point where the minute correspondence is broken, we find in X a group of verses to which the Alexandrian critics took exception. They are memorable and faultless verses in themselves, but they are not adapted closely to their present context. At some point in the tradition of the Homeric poems, probably the time of their committal to writing, the desire to preserve this &amp;vOos led to its substitution in X in place of verses corresponding minutely to K 528-530, where there is an expression of which the cariX\0e of Aristophanes is a faultless parody. It is most natural surely that a brilliant parody of the VKKv&amp;a of Odysseus should base itself on the main account of that veKcvLa rather than on its forerunner-pas- sage, i.e. on X rather than on K. Either, then, the manuscript of Aristophanes' Odyssey had at X 38 something corresponding to the d7rov6oba rpacr'o-faOa of K 528, or the oral tradition of the poem, kept vivid by public recitation, had this. We thus get a glimpse of a written or oral status of a famous passage in Homer</page><page sequence="36">Proceedings for July, 1896. which was superior, in point of exact correspondence, to the subsequent vulgate which became the basis for Alexandrian criticism. The Homer of Plato has been shewn to differ in more than mere minutiae from this vulgate. In one case, at least, the Homer of Aristophanes so differed. It was probably a long and gradual process by which the vulgate won its ascendancy. Remarks were made by Professors Gudemann and Elwell, and by the author in reply. I6. QO2crr in the Orators, with special reference to Isocrates, by W. A. Eckels, of Baltimore. Professor Gildersleeve (A. J. P. XIV. 241) records his conviction that "it is safe to speak of stylistic effect within the range of 5TO-re," and indicates as a marked source of such effect the use of &amp;(Tre with or without a preceding correlative (oTSrws, rotoiroS, etc.). The same writer (A. J. P. VII. 171) notes Isocrates' effec- tive use of &amp;orre correlative in the construction of long periods. Seume (De Sen- tentiis Consecutivis Graecis) speaks of the large use of the (O-T?e sentence in the orators, and its "great oratorical force." This paper aimed to give a few results of a study undertaken in pursuance of these suggestions, with a view to testing the value of &amp;Tre as an index of style in the orators. Only the more general and obvious results could find place in so brief a summary. Isocrates is an author in whom we especially look for the conscious use of rhetorical effects. The plan of this study has been to compare Isocrates' use of tbare (I) with that of several other orators; (2) in the different classes of Isocratean writings; (3) in different orations of the same class; (4) in differ- ent parts of the same oration. The points especially studied have been (I) the use of the moods, (2) the employment or omission of the correlative, and (3) the frequency of occurrence of ia-re in general. The conclusion was reached that (3) is of minor importance as a stylistic test, while (2) is of decided value. Taking the average occurrence of %crre to the Teubner page in six orators, the curve runs thus: Antiphon .28; Lysias .95; Isocrates I.oo; Isaeus .69; Demos- thenes .49; Aeschines .30. These results are interesting, but it is not easy to connect them with characteristic differences of style. We should hardly expect, e.g., so close a correspondence in authors differing so widely as Isocrates and Lysias. But the test of correlation brings out a real difference. In Isocrates, correla- tive fo'-re greatly preponderates over non-correlative. In Lysias it falls a little below it. Isoc. correlative: non-correlative :: 21: I; Lys. I: I1-. Here we seem to have a true norm of style -the free &amp;oTTr in the simpler, less periodic style of Lysias, the correlative rore in the more complicated structure of Isocrates. Isaeus marks a further gain for the non-correlative type- cor. I; non-cor. II. The closer "grip" of argument in Isaeus still had need of tSrre as a logical instrument; it could better dispense with the rhetorically effective o-cws - &amp;tre, which was brought into frequent service by the narrative of Isocrates and Lysias.1 1 The ratio of correlative to non-correlative in the six orators studied stands thus: Ant. I: 2?; Lys. I: Ig; Isoc. 21 : i; Isae. I: T3; Dem. i : I; Aesch. xl : i. XXXV</page><page sequence="37">xxxvi American Philological Association. Again, compare two works of Isocrates. The Adv. Euthynum is a strictly foren- sic work-close argument, almost devoid of narrative, so concise and plain in style as to be denied to Isocrates by some. The Helen is an epideictic speech of the most ornate type, full of flowing periods and involved sentences. In the average of the occurrence of 5o-Tr they both occupy a high place,- the Eut/h. first of the twenty-one works, the Helen sixth. But these Z6are sentences differ widely in rhetorical effect. Out of 15 cases in the Euth., 12 are of the non- correlative type; and almost all these represent what may be called the "%O-rTe of logical inference," -a sort of "therefore," introducing an opinion or conclu- sion. Out of 18 examples in the Helen, I6 are of the correlative type-the oU'Tws often at the head of its clause, giving an effective balance. For the two types, compare Euth. 5 and Hel. 37.1 The predominance of these two types in ratios of 4: I and 8: I respectively seems an excellent index to the widely differing styles of these two orations. Attention was now concentrated on Isocrates, and a table presented showing the average occurrence for each oration, for each class, the number of correla- tives and non-correlatives in each oration, and the ratio of correlatives to non- correlatives for each class. The works are classified according to Jebb, thus avoiding any tendency to twist the classification in the interest of a theory. The ratios of correlative to non-correlative for the several classes are as follows: (I) Epideictic, 33-: i; (2) Philosophical (Essays on Education), 2?: I; (3) Politi- cal, 2X: I; (4) Forensic, I: I; (5) Hortatory, l 1': I. Assuming that the correlative 6aTre is suited to a dignified, elaborate, and consciously rhetorical style, this order of classes is much what we should expect. Epideictic discourse is the natural home of this kind of writing, and the Philo- sophical and Political, in Isocrates at least, are much tinged with it. Hortatory and Forensic work involve an opposite tendency (on the ?yvos 8KavK6uv, cf. Panathl. i), and are unfriendly to elaborate periods and correlative structure. The test of correlation was next applied to the individual orations within each department. When we find a work differing widely in its use of ao-TE from the normal usage of its class, we inquire whether it is in other respects abnormal - whether it is a fair representative of that class. In nearly every instance wide departures from type in the use of So-TE were found to coincide with lack of conformity in other respects. The Archidamus, e.g., stands lowest in the Politi- cal class in use of the correlative type, - correl. I ?: non-correl. i, as against 24: I for its class. But this speech was noted by the Pseudo-Longinus as an instance of 7rpo-w7rovrotla-feigned speech of another; the speaker is a young man and a Spartan prince. In closeness of argument and earnestness of tone it approaches the forensic class, and recedes furthest from the epideictic coloring which marks the Areopagiticus and Panegyricus- orations which stand at the opposite end of this class in respect to correlation, with ratios of correl. 4 : non- correl. I, and 3: i, respectively. The widest variations in style in any one class are found in the Forensic, and here are seen the widest extremes in the use of 6o-Tre correlative and non- 1 Euth. 5: NtKias roivvv EvOvvov rAeiw tiev eXe, rTTov Se Svarat Aeyetv * (LOa' ovK eoaT 6S' TtL av 47TrhpOl a&amp;SiKcw enr' EOvvvovv ekOeiv.

Here, too, the question of genuineness has been oftenest raised. The non-correlative extreme is represented by the Euthynus, whose peculiarities have already been noted, and which may be called the " ultra-forensic " specimen of Isocrates' style. At the opposite poles stand the 7raieziticus and De Bigis. The former was regarded by Benseler as a school exercise; and Dionysius of Halicarnassus lays especial stress on its " epideictic " character. As to the use of M&amp;TTe, it shows a ratio of correl. 33: non-correl. I. The De Bigis, ostensibly a court speech, is in effect a glorification of the elder Alcibiades. Jebb notes its "thoroughly epideictic" character. In its use of cor- relation it stands highest of the Forensic works, and second in the whole Isocra- tean corpus: - correl. 41-: non-correl. i. But the tone is not uniform throughout the whole fragment, and an analysis was here presented showing its composite structure. A speech assigned to one department may show clearly-marked strata of material belonging properly to another. The divisions made were: (I) (secs. 5-21) narrative mixed with argument--the tone partly apologetic; (2) (25-38) pure narrative--bold and unqualified panegyric; (3) (39-50) argument and personal plea. In use of iaTTe, (I) shows correl. 3: non-correl. I; in (2) (having o1 examples in all) every one is correl.; in (3) all are non-correls. This analysis and the estimate of the stylistic features of the several divisions are closely confirmed by Drerup (ANeu. yahrb. Suppl. Bd. 22, h. 2). He concludes that " this oration proves the forensic diction in Isocrates to be different from the epideictic." An analysis was also made of the Panegyricus, one of the longer speeches and one of the most consciously artistic. The sections which are clearly of the epi- deictic order,-pieces of "fine writing," recounting the ancient achievements of Athens, -aggregating one-half of the speech, show a ratio of correl. to non- correl. of 411: I, as against 3: I for the whole work, and I\: I for those portions which could be described as the opposite of epideictic. Analyses of a number of other orations showed similar results, not always so striking as those presented, but in the main consistent with them and tending to show the stylistic belongings of these two types of 5TTE sentence. The use of the moods after SOTTre appears not to be, per se, an index of style. It is true, e.g, that Lysias has a larger ratio of finite verbs to infinitives than Isocrates, - 2: 1 as against i : i; but this loses independent significance when we recall the larger use in Lysias of the non-correlative type of &amp;To-r- sentence; for in this type the finite verb, for obvious reasons, almost crowds out the infini- tive. To get at the separate value of the mood test, we ought to eliminate the factor of correlation, i.e. compare the use of moods within each type. The differences are found to be very slight. In non-correlative examples we find that the ratio of finite verbs to infinitives is as 3: I for Lysias, 33 : i for Isocrates. In correlative examples, Lysias has 7 finite : 6 infinitives; Isocrates, I : 9. So, in different speeches and parts of speeches of these authors, so long as we study the correlative and non-correlative types separately, statistics of the moods have no story to tell of a difference in style. That the use of the finite verb is not a mark of negligentia, its preponderance in Isocrates would seem to show with sufficient clearness. The fact comes out still more clearly in a comparison of Isocrates and Xenophon. In Isocrates finite verbs stand to infinitives as i-: I; in Xeno- phon, as I}: i (according to Wehmann's figures). XXXVll</page><page sequence="39">xxxviii American Philological Association. I7. Plato's Studies in Greek Literature, by Carleton L. Brownson, of Yale University. External evidence regarding Plato's literary tastes and studies is not wanting, but it is far less adequate and trustworthy than the internal evidence. It is the latter, therefore, which the present paper aims to collect and analyze, considering first, the comments which are to be found in Plato's dialogues upon poetry and the poets, and second, his citations from the works of poets of his own age and of the earlier centuries. The few famous passages, however, which condemn so sternly the moral teachings of Homer, Hesiod, and the dramatists are reserved to be the subject of a later paper. I. Plato regards the poets as the earliest sages of Greece, "our fathers and leaders in wisdom" (Lys. 214 A.), their mission corresponding to that of the philosophers in later times (cf. Prof. 316 D., Theaet. 152 E.). They differ, how- ever, from the philosophers in that their wisdom is the product of inspiration, not of reason. This difference is everywhere (e.g. Apol. 22 C., Ion 533 D. ff., Leg. 719 C.) strongly insisted upon, as marking the superiority of the philosopher. In general, Plato sometimes speaks kindly of the poet (cf. especially Syrmp. 209 A. ff., Phaedr. 245 A.), but more often slightingly. He is one of the unnecessary additions to a state (Rep. 373 B.), his aim is merely to flatter and give pleasure (Gorg. 501 ff.), and he is rated among the very lowest as regards his comprehen- sion of truth (Phaedr. 248 D.). Plato has nevertheless made the art of the poet a subject of careful study. This is shown by the well-known passage (Rep. 392 D. ff.), in which he marks the boundaries between the various types of poetry. The first lines of the Iliad are referred to as illustrating a combination of the narrative and mimetic methods. Change the direct to indirect discourse, and the result is simple narrative; or drop the lines which intervene between the speeches, and we have tragedy. It follows, then, that poetry may he either simple narrative or imitation or a com- bination of both. Clearly Plato is here preparing the foundation upon which Aristotle builds in the Poetics, while at the same time making it evident that he might himself have reared the superstructure. Plato also proves by very frequent allusions his full knowledge of everything pertaining to the art of the dramatist. Not only does he resort to the theatre for illustrations and comparisons in almost all the dialogues, but he employs in at least two instances (Symp. 194 B., 'ep. 373 B.) technical expressions of the playwright which are found nowhere else in classic Greek literature. II. Plato's references to individual poets and his citations from their works are so numerous that they can only be treated in the most cursory manner. Even the earliest, half mythical bards of Greece - Amphion, Marsyas, Olympus, Orpheus, Musaeus, Eumolpus, Thamyris-are all known to him. Orpheus, indeed, is directly quoted in several instances. Coming to the more real names of later times, we find Plato gleaning over the entire field of Greek literature. In all his citations he is seeking primarily such passages as will serve his purpose in philosophical argument, either by way of proof or of illustration. This fact explains why he cites Theognis more often than Sappho, and Euripides more often than Sophocles. On the other hand, he often quotes what seems to him false or injurious doctrine in order to refute it, while again, laying aside any utili-</page><page sequence="40">Proceedings for July, 1896. xxxix tarian motive, he simply yiells to the natural impulse of the widely read man of letters. Plato seldom suggests, even by a word, his opinion of the poet from whom he is quoting. Only to Homer does he award an unstinted measure of praise, to Hesiod the lesser honor which constant association with Homer reflects upon him. Among the writers of elegiac verse, Plato quotes more or less frequently from Tyrtaeus, Solon, Phocylides, and Theognis. Archilochus, the iambic poet, is not quoted, but is mentioned with honor. The lyric poets, excepting Pindar and Simonides, receive rather scant attention. Plato has not transcribed a line from Sappho, Alcaeus, or Anacreon. Simonides, however, is quoted in several dia- logues, being even thought worthy to furnish a theme for discussion to such men as Socrates and Protagoras. From Pindar we have no less than eleven citations in almost as many dialogues, a fact which must be taken as showing how highly Plato regarded the Theban poet. Among the comedians Plato has rather a wide acquaintance. He either quotes or alludes to Epicharmus, Pherecrates, Eupolis, Plato Comicus, and Aristophanes. On the other hand, it is very noticeable that he neither mentions nor quotes a single tragedian except the three great masters and Agathon. Euripides, the most quotable of the three, is quoted rather more frequently than Aeschylus, i.e. the former in eleven instances, the latter in nine. Euripides is also referred to in at least two passages (Rep. 568 A., Phaedr. 268 C.) as a representative trage- dian. Sophocles, strange to say, is almost ignored. He is not once mentioned by name as the author of a single quotation, and only once (Symp. 196 C.) can we be entirely sure that Plato is quoting from him. This fact has given rise to the supposition that the philosopher cherished some ill feeling towards Sopho- cles. Such a supposition is rendered entirely improbable by a consideration of the two passages in Plato (Rep. 329 B.C., Phaedr. 268 C.D.) in which Sophocles is mentioned by name. Epic poetry to Plato is comprised in the works of Homer and Hesiod. The cyclic poets are not so much as mentioned. Only once (Euth yphro I2 A.B.) two verses are cited which the scholiast ascribes to the Cypria. Hesiod is directly quoted fourteen times in eight dialogues. But one of these quotations is from the Theogony, the rest from the Works and Days. The references to the poet are comparatively numerous and, as has been suggested, for the most part com- plimentary. Nevertheless Plato seems to have been less thoroughly acquainted with Hesiod than with any other great poet. The most inexact quotation in all the dialogues (Rep. 469 A., Crat. 397 E.) is one from the Works and Days, while on the other hand two passages in the Cratylus (396 C., 402 B.) show that Plato was entirely unfamiliar with the Thleogony. Coming now to Homer, we find that Plato quotes from the Iliad 77, from the Odyssey 35 times. The total number of quotations, therefore, is 112, of lines quoted 212. From all other poets cited we have a total of about 170 lines in about 75 quotations. Further, apart from direct quotations or general allusions, Plato refers to individual Homeric lines or passages 77 times. He either quotes or refers to passages in 23 books of the Iliad and I8 of the Odyssey, 41 in all out of 48; and some Homeric quotation or reference is found in all the dialogues which Christ (Griech. Litteraturgesch., p. 376 if.) classes as genuine except two -the Parnzeni.les and Crilias. The Republic contains rather more than a third of the total number of citations.</page><page sequence="41">American Philological Association. The first question suggested by an examination of Plato's citations from Homer is, how correctly does he quote? This question has been recently treated by Prof. G. E. Howes,1 who finds that Plato is in general remarkably true to his text of Homer, and that apparent mistakes cannot fairly be charged to his igno- rance or carelessness. A few further points may be stated which make the case even stronger for Plato. First, in at least two-thirds of his quotations it is cer- tain or altogether probable that he either gives us the exact words of his text or changes them only in so far as the structure of his sentence requires. Second, only two cases can be found where it even seems that he has quoted the same Homeric verse differently in different passages (Z 211I in Soph. 268 D., Rep. 547 A.; and K 495 in Rep. 386 D. and Meno Ioo A.). The variants are in the one instance rot and rts, in the other at and rat. Surely such differences as these are more probably to be charged to copyists than to Plato. Third, Plato perfectly understands every line which he quotes, perfectly appreciates the spirit of Homer, and continually reveals a boundless reserve fund of knowledge. In truth "Plato kannte seinen Homer vortreflich.' 2 Did he then quote from memory? Such a supposition seems to offer the only possible explanation for two well-known passages (379 D., 408 A.) in the Republic. In none beside these can we surely convict Plato of lack of knowledge and failure to look up his authority. In general I believe that while Plato did refer to Homeric lines without verifying his references, he did not in the majority of cases quote from memory. This is a question of probability and not one where proof is possible. My conclusion is based first, upon the remarkable accuracy of much the greater part of Plato's quotations. Second, despite mistaken references which reveal the inexactness and incompleteness of his knowledge, he is as pre- cise when quoting less familiar passages as when dealing with the first lines of the Iliad. Third, a close comparison of Rep. 405 E. and Ion 538 C. seems to me to show either that Plato verified his quotation in the Ion, or that he knew or remembered his Homer better while composing the Ion than while composing the Republic. The first conclusion is the easier and, if valid, is significant in its bearing upon the entire question. 18. Rome's Foreign Population, 00oo B.C.-Ioo A.D., by Dr. W. F. Palmer, of West View, Ohio.

X. Con- clusions. I subjoin some brief remarks with reference to a few of the topics discussed. II. It is impossible to ascertain with even approximate accuracy, either the total population of the city at this time or the proportion of foreigners. Citizens in provinces and municipal towns are usually included in the few statements bear- ing upon the population of the city (Val. Paterc. II. 7. 7; Livy XLI. 8; XLII. 10). Julius Caesar alone distributed 80,000 citizens among colonies across the sea (Suet. 7ul. 42), and Augustus I20,000 (Monum. Ancyr.). Mithridates put to death 80,000 Roman citizens who were doing business in Asia (Val. Max. IX. 2, 3). The data furnished by the Monumrentum Ancyraznum (tabula tertia a laeva 15-I6) and by Suetonius (7ul. 41) regarding the distribution of money and grain to the plebeians are insufficient. After making computation for the women, children, equites, and senators, we shall do little but guess-work in attempting to reach a numerical conclusion, for the number of freedmen, slaves, and foreigners is wholly past finding out. IV. The Jews. The conclusions regarding the Jews are based upon the fol- lowing passages: Cicero, pro Flac. 28, 66; de provin. consul. 5, 10; Horace, Sat. I. 4, 140-143; 9, 61-72; Ovid, Remed. Amor. 219, Ars Arnat. I. 76; Josephus, Antiq. XIV. o0. 2-8, XVII. Ii. I, XVIII. 3. 5; Persius, V. I84; Juvenal, VI. 543-547, XIV. 96-106; Tacitus, Ann. II. 85, XV. 44, Hist. IV. 3-6, V. 5. 13, frag. 2; Suetonius, 7ul. 84, Tiber. 36; Appian, II. 39; Dio Cass. LX. 3. At Rome there were enough Jews to form by themselves an important city. Many of them were business men, some were slaves, some artisans, and others were engaged in the work of proselyting, while still others, especially women, made gain by working upon the superstition of the populace. V. The Chaldeans. The following passages are most valuable in giving infor- mation regarding the Chaldeans: Cicero, de div. II. 42-47, 99; Val. Max. I. 3, 3; Pliny, H. N. XXX. 2, XXXVII. Ioo; Juvenal, VI. 553, X. 93; Tacitus, Ann. II. 32, XII. 22; Dio Cass. XLIX. at end, L. 56. LXV. I. This people in a way seems to have supplied the place of the old oracles which had fallen into disuse at this time. Much of the superstition which so characterized the Roman populace at this time was due to the practices of this people. Their power over those high in the state, as Nero, Agrippa, and even Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar, is evidence of their number and pervading influence. One of the strongest pictures in Juvenal is that in which the emperor Tiberius is represented as sitting upon the rock of Capri with his flock of Chaldeans about him. In our abstract we shall consider only Asia, Syria, and Cappadocia, for from these districts the Romans obtained the most of their slaves. IX. (a) Asia. Our information must be based chiefly upon the following citations: Cicero, pro Flac. 2, 3; 27, 65; Catullus, X. 6; Livy, XXXIV. 4, XXXIX. 6, XLV. 23; Strabo, XIV. 5; Pliny, H. N. XXXV. 199; Juvenal, V. 56, VII. 130; Florus, III. 12. 6; Justin. XXXI. 8, 9. The occurrence in Roman comedy of such names for slaves as Lydus, Lesbia, Mysis,-names derived from their native countries (cf. Varro, de L. L. VIII. 9), -is evidence of the kind of employment followed. Youths of high birth from these districts xli</page><page sequence="43">xlii American Philological Association. were much used upon the stage, and often danced in Caesar's shows for the amusement of the people. Female players from Asia often played at Roman banquets upon the cithera and sambuca, and acted as pantomimists. Our conclu- sion, then, is that these Asiatics, apart from being used in large numbers as ministers to luxury and amusement, were very extensively employed in the hardest and most menial public and private services. Among them were to be found great extremes: the most valuable and skilled-- therfos Asiae of Juvenal-- and the cheapest and most ignorant of all the slaves acquired by the Romans. IX. (b) Syria and Cappadocia. The following passages will be sufficient to show the magnitude of the slave traffic between Rome and this section: Cicero, post red. in sen. 6, 14; de oratore, II. 66, 265; in Pisonem, I; Verres, II. 5, 25; Horace, Epist. I. 6. 39; Sat. I. 2. I; Strabo, XIV. 5. 2; Livy, XXXV. 49; Propert. II. 23. 21; Persius, VI. 77; Martial, VI. 77. 4, X. 23, 9, 76; Juvenal, III. 62, VI. 351, VII. I5, VIII. 159; Suetonius, Azug. 83, Nero 27, Gr. 8. The term Syrian is quite general and includes the people on the coast from Egypt to Silicia and far inland. Slave dealing was the chief reason for the fact that the Mediterranean Sea was so infested with pirates. The profits were immense, and slaves could be acquired with great facility. The imbecility of the kings of Syria and Cilicia made easy the constant marauding enterprises directed against their subjects. The Rhodians, Cyprians, and Egyptians, who were enemies of the Syrians, did what was in their power to direct the attacks of the pirates against Syria. The Syrians were immoral. They were extensively used as ministers to luxury. Many were employed as carriers of sedans, some as tavern keepers, others as grammarians. Numbers of them became successful traders and business men. Many of the artisans in Verres' shop in Sicily were acquired from pirates. And since the pirates largely obtained their slaves from Syria, we may infer that in Rome great numbers of these slaves were engaged in the mechanical arts. Professor Clement L. Smith then reported as Chairman of the Committee on Time and Place of Meeting in 1897. The Committee recommended that the next annual meeting be held at Bryn Mawr College, beginning July 6, I897. The report was adopted. The meeting adjourned at 4.50 P.M., in order to enable the mem- bers to attend the reception at the residence of Professor and Mrs. Albert Harkness. EVENING SESSION.

The Form of Philosophical Discussion before Sokrates, by Dr. Arthur Fairbanks, of Yale University. To understand the art of Plato it is necessary to consider the earlier efforts to express philosophical reasoning. Down to the time of Sokrates I find three forms of philosophical expression: (i) the "saying" or proverb, (2) the didactic poem, and (3) prose exposition. We can affirm nothing confidently as to the form of discussion in the early Ionic school. Apparently Thales left nothing in writing. His successor, Anaxi- mander, wrote a work from which Theophrastos quotes the saying that all things return to the first principle "of necessity, for they suffer punishment and pay the penalty to each other for their injustice." The fragment confirms the statement of Theophrastos that his phraseology is rather poetical. Of Anaximenes' writ- ings we know almost nothing beyond the statement of Diogenes that he wrote simple, plain Ionic. Something resembling the style of Anaximander reappears in the writings of his noted successor in Asia Minor, Herakleitos. His play on words (66: "The bow /L6s is called life gtios, but its work is death"), his irony (127: "If it were not to Dionysos that they made the procession and sang the phallic hymn, they would be acting most shamelessly"), and his pregnant statements (51 a: "Oxen are happy when they find bitter vetches to eat"), all contribute to make his writings obscure. He chose the pithy saying, the aphorism, as the form to express his views, but his purpose in doing so does not seem to have been to give currency to his thought. Rather he supremely disregards the attitude of others; he goes his own way, criticizing alike those who think and those who do not think; and the form of his writings is admirably adapted to the man and the thoughts he would express. Single deep glances into the reality of things, and single cuts across the views of others, constitute his philosophy. He has no complete rounded system, and I find no proof that he wrote any complete book. 22: "All things are exchanged for fire, and fire for all things; as wares are exchanged for gold, and gold for wares." 36: " God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace . . .; he assumes different forms as incense does; every- one gives him the name he likes." 41: "You could not step twice in the same rivers; for other and yet other waters are ever flowing on." In such pointed statements did Herakleitos express his belief that fire is the first principle of things, that opposites are one, that change is universal. In the same manner he criticizes others. I6: "Varied learning does not teach any man wisdom; else it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hekataios." While of Pythagoras he went on to say, I7: "Prosecuting investi- gations more than any other man, he made a wisdom of his own, - much learn- ing and bad art." The proverb has always been a favorite form for the expression of popular philosophy; Herakleitos used it to express an abstruse philosophy, and that primarily for himself rather than for others.</page><page sequence="45">xliv American Pliiloiogical Association. Herakleitos founded no school, and he had no successor in this form of literary expression. Zeno came nearer to it than any later philosophic writer, in the riddles by which he sought to confirm the position of his master, Parmenides. Contests in propounding and solving riddles were by no means unknown in Greece and Sicily, and it is truly remarked by Schneidewin that here is to be found the beginnings of the later Eristik. The arguments from Achilles and the tortoise he could not overtake, from the arrow that is at rest in its onward flight, from the pile of grain that makes no noise in its fall because the single grain makes no sound,- show how Zeno used the riddle to enounce and enforce his philosophic position. The second general form of philosophic expression to take its rise in Greece is the didactic poem. Philosophic speculation as to the origin and interpretation of the world was preceded by mythical and cosmogonic speculations in poetic form. The Theogony of Hesiod, the early speculations of the Orphic school, the cosmogony of Pherekydes, are not philosophy, but they stimulated thought which became philosophic, so that it would not be unnatural for early philosophy to adopt their poetic form. The immediate occasion for the use of poetry in philo- sophic writing was the poetic genius and spirit of one of the earlier Greek philoso- phers, - Xenophanes. Parmenides, his successor, adopted the form as well as the doctrine of his master; Empedokles, himself a poet of no mean order, followed the example of Parmenides; and, perhaps fortunately, ancient philosophy had no other poetic expounder with the single exception of Lucretius, the brilliant imitator of Empedokles. Xenophanes is best known as a lyric poet. His purely literary productions contain a spirited critique of ordinary views, and in this respect they resemble the so-called philosophic fragments; for in these, too, he criticizes popular views of religion and of nature with the freedom and power of a poet. According to Diogenes, Xenophanes made his living in later years by reciting his own compo- sitions at the festivals of different cities, and we can well believe that both the elegiac verses and the hexameters on religion and philosophy might have been composed for such recitation. 5-6: " Mortals suppose that the gods are born, as they themselves are, and that they wear man's clothing, and have human voice and body; . . . but if cattle or lions had hands, so as to paint with their hands and produce works of art as men do, they would paint their gods and give them bodies in form like their own, -horses like horses, cattle like cattle." Such is the poet's statement of the transcendency of God, the poet's criticism of popular anthropomorphic ideas of God; and such verses make it clear that even in his philosophic writing Xenophanes was a poet, aiming to please and interest the people. Poetry became the vehicle of philosophic teaching because this poet used his ordinary means of expression for his scientific and philosophical views, and Eleatic thinkers who accepted his views continued to express them in verse. With Parmenides the verse form which he inherited is somewhat external, so much so that he is said to have rewritten his views in prose. His poem on the nature of things begins with an elaborate, not to say a labored prooemium, describing his approach to the palace of the goddess in whose mouth are placed his philosophic opinions. Different views have been held as to the poetic merit of the prooemium, but there can be no question that the lines which follow are exceedingly barren. The hopes held out by the goddess to the enquirer are</page><page sequence="46">Proceedings for July, 1896. expressed with some vigor. 133: "Thou shalt know the nature of the heavens and all signs that are in the sky, the hidden toils of the pure bright torch of the sun, and whence they arose, and thou shalt learn the wandering course of the moon and its nature. Thou shalt behold the sky surrounding all, whence it arose, and how necessity directing it chained it so as to serve as a limit to the courses of the stars." The remainder of the poem is as prosaic as is possible even for a scientific treatise. The third Greek thinker to write in poetry, the only one who really succeeded in the difficult task of uniting philosophic thought with true poetic form, was Empedokles. Philosopher and poet, mystic thinker and thaumaturge, priest and statesman, -the many-sided life of Empedokles is reflected in the variety of his writings. Tragedies, an epic poem, and hymns to the gods are referred to him by Diogenes Laertius. We possess fragments only of his great philosophic poem and of that on lustral rites. His predecessors had used daktylic hexameter for their poems; Empedokles, I believe, sought to conform much more closely to the pure epic model. From the study of the fragments that remain to us, we find that he keeps in mind the epic standard, in verse, in language, and in style. He uses the hexameter as it was used in the epic, not as a mere form, but as a form bringing out his thought and emphasis better than it could otherwise be expressed. In language one marks the occurrence of purely epic words, of epic forms, and of epic constructions. The use of epithets is clearly influenced by the epic model, - epithets are chosen for picturesque effect rather than for the development of the argument, the same epithets occur with the same nouns, and the epic series of three nouns having a descriptive epithet with the third is not infrequent. It is certainly a bold idea to make an epic out of the scientific description of the origin of nature, but the breadth of plan and the general mode of treatment point to this. I will only quote one of several similes, to illustrate how scientific descrip- tion is clothed in epic language, 3I6 if.: " And as one with a journey in prospect through a stormy night provides himself with a lantern and lights it at the bright- shining fire, lanterns that drive back every sort of wind (for they scatter the breath of the winds that blow); and the light darting out, inasmuch as it is finer [than the winds], shines across the threshold with untiring ray; so the elemental fire, shut up in membranes, it entraps in fine coverings as the round pupil; and the coverings protect it against the deep water which flows about it, but the fire darting forth, inasmuch as it is finer . . ." The rise of simple prose exposition is to be more briefly told. I have already called attention to the statement of Diogenes that Anaximenes wrote "plain Ionic," presumably prose. Some half a century later we find Melissos, a pupil of Parmenides, using simple prose to state again the doctrines of the Eleatic school. His prose, still in the Ionic dialect, is labored and confused and can claim no literary merit. His effort to introduce a logical form into the discussion of philosophic questions can hardly be called successful. In his attempts to expound scientifically the idealistic views of his school, he only deserves the credit of a bare and crude simplicity. The prose of Anaxagoras stands on a higher level. His long residence in Athens, his connection with the brilliant circle gathered by Perikles, his alleged influence over Euripides, and finally the forebodings of a new era in thought which appear in his philosophy, interest us in Anaxagoras more than in his xlv</page><page sequence="47">American Philological Association. predecessors. His writings seem to have met with much favor, as we may infer both from Plato's reference in the Apology to the price of his works, and from the fact that they were preserved long after the writings of so able and learned a scholar as Democritos were lost. Diogenes informs us that Anaxagoras was one of the philosophers who left but a single work, and this, he says, "was written in a lofty and agreeable style." Allusions to other works seem to be due to misunderstanding or to deliberate forgery. In the fragments of the first book, preserved by Simplicius, he states his philosophic positions in a straight- forward way, with only an occasional comment or proof. He is not easy to understand, however, because he is not entirely successful in creating a philo- sophical vocabulary to meet his needs. With the Sophists began the new era of philosophic thought, and the develop- ment of earlier forms of thought, like the development of the content of philosophic systems, found a partial conclusion in the work of Anaxagoras. 22. Notes on the Function of Modern Languages in Africa, by Professor W. S. Scarborough, of Wilberforce University. It seems to be a universal law that a conquered people shall forsake its own speech for that of the conquerors,-provided the latter are superior in civiliza- tion, culture, and refinement. The Kelts in the time of Caesar's invasion did so. While, on the other hand, the Germans, who later invaded the same country, forsook their own language for that of the conquered but more civilized race. The French language, like the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, is derived from the popular Latin, - like them it is the " product of the slow development of the common Roman speech." The phonetic changes observed in the development or decadence of a language may be attributed in part to the structure of the vocal organs as well as to the difference in race or climate. All of these have their influence. As examples, we note the Langue d'Oil and the Langue d'Oc of north and south Gaul respec- tively. What is true here is true elsewhere. What is true of Europe, of America, is true of Africa under the same or similar conditions. It is the survival of the fittest whether in the realm of linguistics or of animal life. Civilization is the mighty power that shapes the destiny of language. Dialects crumble before it and diversity of tongues drift toward unity. The stronger will swallow up the weaker until the speech of the dominant people prevails; jargon at first, perhaps, extinction later. From an early period, from the time that African ethnology, African linguistics, African folklore, began to attract the attention of ethnologists and philologists to any considerable extent, a scheme of classification of these African speech forms has been a matter of serious study. But in an unexplored field like this, however, difficulties of an insuperable character are wont to arise, making it impossible to arrive at anything definite. A classification of these on a purely scientific basis seems out of the question. Dialects and sub-dialects, the product of ignorance and environment, are so numerous that philologists are baffled to find a starting- point. It is not straining a point to declare that the native African is a linguist of no mean sort -that many of them speak several languages and dialects apart from xlvi</page><page sequence="48">Proceedings for July, 1896. xlvii their own; even the rudest of them seeming to pick up speech wnerever they find it. As an example we may mention the Veys and the Deys, the Golahs and the Pessas from the interior, who, from contact with foreign-speaking people, and especially the English, learn the language of their superiors sufficiently to con- verse intelligently with foreign residents. The Krumen may be taken as another example. Both the Kru and the Grebo tribes belong to the agglutinative speak- ing class. In the language of Cust, "travelers allude to the jargon of Sierra Leone English, and state that the people of Lagos speak a patois of English which closely approximate to Yariba." Clicks form a curious linguistic feature of the Hottentot group. Sayce speaks of an unpronounceable click not otherwise found in the language, as associated with the folk story of a hare, which story in turn is traced from the Bari of Central Africa, through Melagasy, Swahili, Kaffir, Hottentot, back to the Bush- men. It is well to note here that these clicks are found in connection with beast fables of the backward tribes of southern Africa. HIe refers to them as the bridge that marks the passage of inarticulate cries into articulate speech; "we may see in them survival of those primeval utterances out of which language was born." Herodotus says of the Ethiopian Troglodytes (IV. 183): ,yXwo-rav 68 o8Se/zty \XXy 7rapoloolJv vevo/uAIKactL XX&amp; reErplyact KacOd7rep al VWKrepL&amp;Fs. These clicks are expiratory sounds, consonantal in their character. I prefer the classification into dentals, palatals, and laterals, of the three out of the four found in the Hottentot speech. These three clicks are also found in Zulu and in the speech of other tribes who seem to have caught them by contagion. I have found natives of the Ama-Xosa, Ba-Suto, Tembu, Zulu, and what is called the Fingo tribe, who spoke English fairly well, using these same clicks- all of which are difficult for a foreigner to incorporate with any readiness into the word he wishes to utter. C, q, and x are the characters that the English translator has made use of to represent these clicks. C stands for the dental, q for the palatal, and x for the lateral. The letter c, as found in the word ncapai, is to our ear nearly like the sound produced by a kiss; but it is made by the compression of the tip of the tongue between the teeth and then drawing it back in haste. The sound repre- sented by q is made by placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth and then withdrawing it quickly -the effect being a cracking sound. The letter x, repre- senting the third of these clicks, corresponds to the sound we use in clucking to a horse - the tongue unites with the double teeth as in the pronunciation of the word box. This sound, in common with the others, does not come at the close of the word, but before the vowels as we find it in the tribal name Ama-Xosa. These clicks are never found in the formative part of a word. The fourth sound in the Hottentot speech, referred to above, not a click proper, is guttural, from the bottom of the throat-rough, and made by contracting the throat, while forcibly expelling the breath, and moving the epiglottis so as to modify it tremu- lously. It seems almost impossible to be made except by natives. These can drop it with seeming ease, so far as I have observed, and substitute the English sounds for c, q, and x, pronouncing words containing them without hesitancy.</page><page sequence="49">xlviii American Philological Association. SOME EXAMPLES OF WORD FORMATION. Of all the European people the Portuguese were the first to become established on African soil. Their language soon became fixed and exerted an influence over the native speech that quickly determined the future of the latter. Piccaninny is Portuguese in its origin, but of African mold. It is what some would call a loan word incorporated into the native speech. It seems to be from picade nino or pequeio nifo, a little infant. Sifted through the African speech it comes out piccaninny, a term that is often applied in the Carolinas and on the coast to a negro child. Palaver is Spanish from palabra, and usually denotes idle talk or gossip, but, like piccaninny, it too became an incorporate part of the native speech, taking on the form, accent, and peculiarities of the same in parts where the Spanish is predominant. The terms for knife in the Basque language are all loan words so called -e.g. ganibeta, from the French canif, and nabala from the Spanish nabaja (novacula - Latin). As the result of these mixed speech forms we note the jargon of the negro of the Danish West Indies. It is a specimen of broken Danish and is sometimes called Creolese. It seems to have neither gender, number, declension, nor con- jugation. Another example is found in the negro-English Dutch, which includes also words from the Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Thus it will be seen that in the changes resulting from blending all these tongues, the speech forms of the more intelligent survive, though the process of development is slow. Adjourned at 9.10 P.M. MORNING SESSION. PROVIDENCE, July 9, I896. The meeting was called to order at 9.30 A.M. The reading of papers was begun at once. 23. The Satirical Element in Ennius, by Professor E. M. Pease, of Leland Stanford Jr. University. Writers on the history of Latin literature are accustomed to speak of the Saturae of Ennius as "a collection of miscellaneous poems of a didactic nature, written in different metres," and to refer to Lucilius as the author in whom the elements of satire, in the modern sense of the word, first occur. It was the aim of this paper to question this established view, and to suggest presumptive evi- dence in favor of the genuine satirical spirit in Ennius. The thoughtful study of literature, which traces step by step the influences bearing upon each author and notes the causes producing each new feature, shows that there are no great breaks in the line of development, but on the other hand that there is a regular and steady growth, as truly conformable to the law of evolution as the growth in the physical world. The supposition that satire</page><page sequence="50">Proceedings for July, 896. burst out in full bloom in Lucilius was shown to be due in part to his misinter- pretation of certain passages in Latin, and to have no sufficient basis. The apparent contradiction of Horace in speaking of Lucilius as the inventor of Roman satire (Sat. I. 10. 48), and of Ennius as the rudes et Graecis intacti carminis auctor (Sat. I. IO. 66) is wrongly explained by the supposition that Horace had reference to the satirical spirit in speaking of Lucilius and to the form in the case of Ennius. The same unwarranted inference that the satirical spirit did not exist in the Saturae of Ennius has been drawn from the description of satire in Diomedes (p. 485, Keil), whose whole statement may be somewhat discredited on account of his manifestly extravagant description of Horace and Persius. In the other references to satire in Latin literature there is nothing to prevent one from assuming the elements of satire in Ennius. In attempting to show an organic relation between the Saturae of Ennius and the old dramatic Saturae we must first notice the origin and characteristics of the latter. According to Livy's condensed and somewhat confused account (7. 2), it would seem that the Romans were indebted to Etruria for certain elements of the Satura. At the celebration of the harvest-home and other rural festivals the light-hearted merry people of Latium had long been accustomed to the jovial banter of the Fescennine verses - an entertainment consisting of dialogues of coarse jokes and personal abuse in metrical form, perhaps enlivened by the exhila- rating tones of the pipe or by the beating of time with the feet. In 364 B.c. the magistrates invited a band of Etrurian actors to Rome in the hope of staying the ravages of a terrible pestilence. These actors danced a sort of pantomime to the accompaniment of regularly composed music, and so pleased the people with their performance that Roman youths-the same ones no doubt whose quick wit and dramatic power had made them the leaders in the merriment of their native entertainments- began to imitate the Etruscan actors, and to com- bine the elements of the musical pantomime with the metrical dialogue of the Fescennine raillery, to which they applied the name Satura, "medley," from its composite nature.1 Cf. Ital. farsa, Fr. farce, Arabic Quasstde as applied to poetry, and Juvenal's term farrago for his satires. As the Satura developed under the control of the Roman youths, and the acting became more and more an art, it finally passed into the hands of professional actors, and the young Romans contented themselves with the less exacting performances of after-plays - exodia, to which the Atellanae also were reduced after the introduction of the regular drama. As the versus Fescennini were superseded by the Satura as a dramatic entertainment, but lived on in the scurrilous verses of the marriage celebration and triumphal songs; so the Satura supplanted by the fabula Atellana and the regular drama passed into that branch of poetry known as the literary satire. It is a fair inference from Livy 7. 2. 8. that Andronicus, qui ab saturis ausus est primus argumiento fabulam serere, had been in the habit of writing Saturae before he turned to the regular drama; and in all probability the Satura of Naevius mentioned by Festus 257 (M) is one of the last examples of the old dramatic Satura, rather than the beginning of the new literary Satura. The con- servative spirit of Naevius, his plebeian sympathies, and his adherence to the old It is pleasant to find Mr. Tyrrell presenting this explanation of Satura in his Latin Poetry, p. 217, thus confirming the view I had previously advanced in lectures. xlix</page><page sequence="51">American Philological Association. Saturnian verse, in which the old Saturae were probably written (the verse quoted by Festus is apparently Saturnian) render this all the more probable. One of the chief characteristics of the Roman genius was the fondness for the display of satire and ridicule, and it is worthy of note that the literature of the Romans is more deeply tinged with this spirit than that of any other nation. Up to this time these old Roman burlesques had served (like the editorial page in the modern newspaper) as the principal instrument for publishing the criti- cism of men and measures, and for hurling the shafts of satire against the vices of society. With Ennius, an innovator in so many ways, Satura took on a new form, and for this reason: The success of the new drama, with its fully developed plot, killed the demand for the old dramatic medley, as a theatrical entertainment. The new plays, however, were moulded on the type of the new Attic comedy, the comedy of manners, and gave little opportunity for the display of satire and ridicule, which had so characterized the old time burlesques. Nothing could be more natural then, than that Ennius should remodel the old satirical medley into the literary Satura, and form thus a proper channel for the expression of that sort of miscellaneous criticism which formerly was current in the old Satura, and which is referred to by Horace (Epist. II. 1. 145-I60) in his description of the spirit of the indigenous drama. Ennius retained the name, the spirit, and the essential features of the old Saturae. The characteristics of his Saturae are trace- able throughout the whole history of satire down to Juvenal. The language never rises to the height of other kinds of poetry (Hor. speaks of his satires as 'sermones,' and his muse as 'pedestris'). The peculiarities of the Sermoo Fami- liaris are everywhere noticeable. There is a strong tendency to dramatic form. Dialogue forms an important feature. The personal, autobiographical element is everywhere noticeable. The inordinate amount of obscenity likewise portrays its peculiar origin. Unusual laxity in structural arrangement, the easy change of topic, variety of metres, are other characteristics; and can we believe, as the writers on satire would have us, that the spirit of satire and ridicule was current in the old Satura, and in all the authors of the literary Satura except Ennius and his nephew Pacuvius? In the fragments of Ennius, scanty though they be, there is evidence of all the elements of the Roman Satura, including that of satire. Later writers developed these characteristics each in his own peculiar way, the conditions of society and the temperament of the writer being the leading influences. We cannot believe that Ennius, the man who was perhaps more influential than any other Roman in moulding Roman thought on Greek lines, in introducing Greek culture, in awakening scepticism in religion, and in dispelling superstition, accomplished this without the instrumentality of satire. It was shown that there was good evidence of this spirit of satire in his Saturae in their very titles, in the sources which he drew upon or used as models, in the various topics of which he treated and which became the stock subjects of later satirists, and to some extent in the language itself. This paper was read for the author by Professor William A. Merrill. Remarks were made by Professors A. G. Harkness and Gude mann. 1</page><page sequence="52">Proceedings for July, 896. li At the request of the Committee on Officers for I896-97, the Secretary read the following nominations:- President, Bernadotte Perrin, Yale University. Vice-Presidents, Minton Warren, Johns Hopkins University. Clement L. Smith, Harvard University. Secretary and Treasurer, Herbert Weir Smyth, Bryn Mawr College. Executive Committee, The above officers, and 0. M. Fernald, Williams College. Basil L. Gildersleeve, Johns Hopkins University. Francis A. March, Lafayette College. Samuel Ball Platner, Western Reserve University. John Henry Wright, Harvard University. The report was adopted, and the above-named officers elected. In the absence of a member of the Latin sub-committee of the Committee of Twelve, the Secretary announced that the report on Latin would shortly be sent to all the members of the Association for their approval. The report is here inserted. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TWELVE ON THE STUDY OF LATIN. The Programmes of secondary education put out by the Committee of Ten in their report published in I893, proposed the reduction of Greek preparatory studies from three years to two, and the reduction of Latin preparatory studies from five periods a year for four years to five periods a year for the first two years and four periods for the remaining two years. The harm which would have been worked by the acceptance of the proposi- tion with regard to Greek was so great and unmistakable that immediate and unhesitating protest was demanded. Accordingly the American Philological Association, at a large meeting held in Philadelphia, December 28, I894, unani- mously adopted a motion (now generally made known throughout the country) that, in any programme designed to prepare students for the classical course, not less than three years of instruction in Greek should be required. The harm which would have been worked by the acceptance of the proposi- tion of the Committee of Ten with regard to Latin was appreciable, and the point of view from which the reduction in that subject was made was a dangerous one. Nevertheless, since the proposed reduction in Greek was the more serious of the two, the Philological Association confined its immediate expression of opinlion to that subject, charging its Committee of Twelve, however, with the further duty of considering the questions involved in the propositions with regard to Iatin. The Committee accordingly gave the question careful thought, and conferred also with a large number of other members of the Association engaged in the teaching of languages, ancient or modern, in schools or colleges. It found a striking harmony of opinion, which was further evinced at the meeting of the American Philological Association held in Cleveland on July 13, I895, by the unanimous passage of the following resolution:</page><page sequence="53">lii American Philological Association. "The American Philological Association is of the opinion that the best interests of education demand the retention of the full amount of five weekly periods for four years now generally given, throughout the country, by schools that have a four-year course. And it would be glad to see an increase of the number of years devoted to the subject, either through an extension of the high-school course to five or six years, or through the carrying of some of the high-school subjects into the grammar-school curriculum." The Association recognizes the fact that the prevailing crowding and lack of uniformity in our secondary education in America are serious evils. Accordingly it is in sympathy with the desire of the Committee of Ten to relieve the present congestion of studies and at the same time reach a national programme or series of programmes which might everywhere be adopted; but the Association differs radically from that Committee with regard to the method to be employed. It is of course clear that, under the present circumstances of increasing demands for time on the part of many of the so-called newer subjects, the results desired cannot be obtained unless there is either a general reduction of the time given to each subject or a complete omission of some of the subjects or a relegation of some of them, in whole or in part, to the grammar-school grade. In the judg- ment of the Philological Association the first method, which was the one proposed by the Committee of Ten, is not the true one. It is not best to relieve an over- crowded programme by reducing studies that are of central importance. It is better in any case to make sure that the few essential things in any programme of study, whether classical or scientific or of any other kind, are given their full weight and effectiveness, than to teach many things incompletely through an insufficient allotment of time. It is to be clearly understood that the Association is not now concerned with the question whether every one should be required to study Latin, but is simply laying down the proposition that those who do desire to study it should find a sufficient amount of time devoted to it to enable them to gain the best results. In point of fact there seems to have been a general agreement that five periods a year for four years is none too large an amount to assign to the subject. No demand for a reduction from this amount has come from the schools themselves. On the contrary, it seems to be generally recognized that a larger amount of time, rather than a smaller, ought to be given to the subject of Latin. In a number of schools in different parts of the country courses of five or six years have already been developed ; and the feeling which led to this movement found formal ex- pression, at the meeting of a large and widely representative Classical Conference held at Ann Arbor in March, 1895, in the passage, without a dissenting vote, of a resolution in favor of a six-year course. This belief in a longer course, rather than a shorter one, appears most natural to one who studies the problems of education not simply from the point of view of American experiments, but with the knowledge also of the experience of other countries. Our better schools usually provide four years for the study of Latin, with five exercises a week. If to this amount be added the two years of Latin regarded as normal by colleges which prescribe a part of their work, American education has at best a six-year Latin course to present as against the nine-year or ten-year course found in Germany and England. Moreover, the number of weekly exercises given to the subject is smaller in this country than in Europe.</page><page sequence="54">Proceedings for July, I896. liii A reduction to a still lower standard, such as is proposed by the Committee of Ten, would he uncalled for and unfortunate. We protest against it, because such a reduction would tend to cripple the study of Latin and other studies which are appreciably affected by its welfare, and because such a reduction would postpone the hopes we entertain that Latin studies will be developed in this country until the opportunities afforded equal the best open to students of the old world. We therefore appeal to our universities, our colleges, and our schools, and to all friends of sound education, in whatever occupation, to see to it that our prepara- tory Latin, in place of being weakened, is strengthened and developed as soon as practicable into something more substantial than we now possess. To this end we especially ask the co-operation, not only of all classical teachers, but of those who are interested in our own and other modern languages; and in general we ask the support of all men who believe in a well-rounded liberal education, in which literary studies constitute an indispensable part.

The following resolution was offered by Principal E. W.

The Report as approved was afterwards ordered printed in the Proceedings of the National Educational Association. A telegram from the Secretary of the National Educational Asso- ciation, then in session at Buffalo, was then read, as follows: - The joint committee on college entrance requirements of the departments of higher and secondary education, of the National Educational Association, for- mally invite the American Philological Association to prepare at its convenience a report on the proper course of secondary instruction in Latin and Greek, for the information and use of our joint committee. After discussion, it was voted that the Committee of Twelve should prepare such a report, and that, in so doing, they should take into consideration the results reached by the conferences of the College and School Associations of the New England and Middle States. It was then voted to authorize the Chairman of the Committee of Twelve (Professor W. W. Goodwin, of Harvard University) to fill vacancies in the Committee created by the temporary absence in Europe of two members, - Professor Goodwin, and Professor Warren, of Johns Hopkins University. In place of Professor Goodwin, Professor Herbert Weir Smyth, of Bryn Mawr College, was appointed; in place of Professor Warren, Professor Clement L. Smith, of Harvard University. At the request of Professor Goodwin, Professor T. D. Seymour, of Yale University, accepted the position of Chairman of the Committee.

Professor Hewitt, of Williams College, then proposed the following vote of thanks, which was carried: Resolved, That the members of the American Philological Association desire to express their hearty thanks to the Trustees and Faculty of Brown University for the use of their buildings and for their many courteous attentions on the pres- ent occasion; to the Local Committee,--of which Professor William C. Poland is Secretary,-for their efficient labors in the interests of the session; and also to Dr. and Mrs. Albert Harkness, for the pleasant reception given at their resi- dence on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 8. Professor F. A. March, of Lafayette College, reported as Chairman of the Committee on Spelling Reform. The Committee has not been calld on for any official action since the last meeting of the Association. It reports progress. The " Orthographic Union" of publishers, authors, and the like, with a new Secretary, - F. A. Fernald, Morris Heights, N. Y. City, - has been adding to its membership, and preparing a word-list of "such changes only as a considerable number of authors, editors, and educators have exprest willingness to unite in using." The London Times opend its columns towards the close of I895 to corre- spondents who protest against the tyranny of orthodox spelling, especially against examiners in the schools and Civil Service Commissioners, who 'pluck' a lad because he spels 'judgment' with two e's. Professor Earle and Dr. Abbott join the protestants, and the editor of the Times sums up, agreeing with Dr. Abbott that "moderate latitudinarianism would be reasonable." "The present system is wasteful and unprofitable." Professor Earle wrote that "the way to slow but natural reform is to relinquish coercion and let all men spel as they like, trusting that the natural process of survival of the fittest wil in due time bring about improvement." The practical necessity of uniformity of spelling in a printing establishment has heretofore bard the progress of spelling reform. But varied spellings hav now cumn to be recognized in dictionaries and lernd by printers to such an extent that the London Association of Correctors for the Press recognize it as a cause of the loss of so much time and money as to call for action. They hav compiled a list of the most common doutful words, and agreed upon the spelling they wil use. Mr. Horace Hart, printer to the University of Oxford, has also compiled a set of rules to bring about uniformity in connection with the Clarendon Press. Upon his offer to send copies to those chiefly interested, he receivd letters asking for them from all parts of Britain, Ireland, India, America, and the Colonies. It seems that the same difficulties which hav led to the appointment of government commissions on the spelling of geographic names ar leading the printers to demand authoritativ regulation of all doutful spelling, and there can be no dout that all regulativ action deliberately taken wil promote orthografic reform. The action of the United States Board on Geographic Names constituted by President Harrison in I890 has been cordially accepted by the general public, and embodied in gazetteers and school books. It may be hoped that President</page><page sequence="58">Proceedings for July, 1896. lvii Cleveland wil constitute a similar Board of Scientific Terms from the specialists whose reports ar printed by the goverment. The Committee was continued. 24. Vergil's use of the word Atrium, by Dr. H. W. Magoun, of Oberlin, O. The word atrium occurs in Vergil six times. Servius and the commentators seem to take it for granted that he always had a Roman atrium in mind, and either ignore it altogether or comment upon it as though used in its ordinary sense. There are, however, reasons for believing that Vergil was strongly influ- enced in certain passages by his Homeric sources, and took atrium as the best Latin equivalent for a word which had long been obsolete in this sense in the Greek itself, and could not therefore be readily Latinized. The passages are all in the Aeneid, and are as follows: - I. 725 f. fit strepitus tectis, vocemque per ampla volutant atria; II. 483 ff. apparet domus intus et atria longa patescunt; apparent Priami et veterum penetralia regum, armatosque vident stantes in limine primo. 528 f. porticibus longis fugit et vacua atria lustrat saucius [Polites]. IV. 665 f. it clamor ad alta atria; etc. VII. 378 ff. ceu quondam torto volitans sub verbere turbo quem pueri magno in gyro vacua atria circum intenti ludo exercent; etc. XII. 473 ff. nigra velut magnas domini cum divitis aedes pervolat et pennis alta atria lustrat hirundo, pabula parva legens nidisque loquacibus escas; et nunc porticibus vacuis, nunc umida circum stagna sonat: etc. The two last citations occur in similes - Amata raving through the city like a flying top, and Juturna driving through the ranks of the foe like a swallow that flies through the house of a wealthy man. They offer little to consider; for the plural is the favorite form in the poets, and is therefore without special significance. It has been questioned, Beck. Gal. tr. by M., p. 251, whether the "fountain" men- tioned in the last passage is the one in the atrium; but it seems best to take it so; for passages in Cicero make it clear that in Vergil's time atria built in the Corinthian style with pillars were common among the rich, and it may be assumed that he refers to such an atrium here. The citation from book IV. refers to the main hall of Dido's palace and may be passed over, since the passage from book I. refers to the same, and it will be quite sufficient to consider that. The citations from book II. refer to a single room. Vergil is describing the assault on the</page><page sequence="59">lviii American Philological Association. palace of Priam. 'Pyrrhus is raging at the doors, a hole is cut through the stout oak, and the interior is seen [citation]. Terror reigns within, the women run to and fro, the Danaans burst in the doors, and the guards are overcome. In the meantime, Priam puts on his armor; the women flee to an altar in the midst of the palace, near which were the Penates, shaded by an aged bay-tree; and Hecuba sees Priam and calls him to her side. Then a son of Priam, escaping the general slaughter, flees [citation] through the long porticoes and traverses the deserted halls, only to be overtaken and slain in the sight of his parents.' There are now several things to be noted. The bay-tree, 513, growing in the house, aedibus in mediis, seems to be Homeric and may perhaps have been suggested by the olive in the house of Ulysses, Od. XXIII. 190 f., although Ser- vius places it in the impluvium, as if it were like the foliage in the later Roman atria, and Metcalfe, Beck. Gal. p. 251, thinks that Vergil has the atria of his own day in mind. They have failed to note, however, that the house seems to have been built about the tree as it stood in the primeval forest, cf. VII. 59-63, which was not the Roman method by any means in the days of Vergil; and where atria were fine enough to contain trees, the Penates in his time were provided with a special place in the interior of the house. It may safely be asserted that they were never found in the atria of such houses in his day, although they may possibly have been in those of the humbler sort. Again, Priam has scarcely armed himself before Hecuba sees him and calls him to the altar. The arms, then, must have been somewhere near. Lastly, Polites flees, after the slaughter at the threshold, first through porticoes and then through atria, and is finally slain in the penetralia, since it is close by the altar and the Penates that he falls and perishes at the hand of Pyrrhus. Now it appears from such passages as Hom. I/. VI. 242 ff. and 316, that the Homeric house had first an avX7, an open court made with porticoes, and then a large hall, the /Aeyapov (called also 5C/4a), in which the arms were hung, cf. Od. XIX. 4 ff. and XXII. 23 ff., and at the inner end of which the hearth was placed, cf. Od. VI. 303 ff. and XX. I22 f. This hearth, oaX6dp7, which might also be termed the altar of 'IoTrl7, was the sanctuary of suppliants, cf. Od. VII. I53, and it is further clear from such passages as Eur. Med. 396 that the Oeol KTr7^ot (the Greek Penates) were regularly placed in its near neighborhood, although the Oeol 7rarpyot had an altar in the avX\, cf. Ii. XI. 774. Vergil must have been acquainted with all these facts, and it is hard to escape the conviction that he had them in mind in this place. The description of the first glimpse of the interior (see citation) also agrees with this idea and becomes, on this basis, very lifelike and natural: a hole is burst in the door, a swift glance reveals the aiX5 (domus intus), the tueyapov (atria) with the hearth, or altar, and the Penates at its further end (penetralia), and the eye then returns and rests upon the armed men that await them at the threshold. Moreover, the Homeric arrangement of the Penates and the hearth appears to be referred to in other passages dealing with the city of Troy and the camp of Aeneas, cf. II. 297 and V. 660; and finally, in line 503, in the very midst of the story he distinctly mentions the 7revr4KovTra OdXafIoL of I/. VI. 244. The use of penetralia in line 508 does not invalidate the reasoning; for Vergil uses the word in a still more general sense of the cells of the ant, Geor. I. 379, and it may here be taken to mean that he saw the enemy invading the sanctity of his home. On the above considerations, it seems only fair to Vergil, although this view</page><page sequence="60">Proceedings for July, 1896. upsets the theory held by Metcalfe, Henry, and Kappes that Vergil follows the plan of a Roman house in this place and refers to the cavaedium by cavae- aedes in line 487, to suppose that he uses the word atria in these two passages, not in its ordinary sense, but as an equivalent for the Homeric uityapov, which appears to have also had an open roof. The remaining citation has reference to the feast in the palace of Dido, of which he says, I. 638: mediisque parant convivia tectis; cf. the Homeric use of ZJola for Agyapov, I1. VI. 316, etc. Servius regards both this passage and the citation as having reference to the early customs of the Romans, and Metcalfe, Beck. Gal. p. 250, cites his quotation from Cato on line 726 (730) as an evidence that in the early days the atrium was the dining-room of the house. The same authority, however, on the following page cites the passage itself as an evidence that the atria of Vergil's time had become "very magnificent." This comes painfully near convicting Vergil of an anachronism; but is it necessary? We have no means of knowing what idea Vergil had of a Carthaginian house; but as Carthage was destroyed more than seventy years before he was born, and the scene is laid in Homeric times, it seems very unlikely that any factor of that kind entered into the question. On the other hand (there is hardly a page of the Aeneid which does not contain some item suggestive of Homer), the palace of Dido is represented as magnificent, I. 637, cf. Od. VII. 8I if., the city excites the admiration of Aeneas, I. 421 f., cf. Od. VII. 43 ff., and the whole setting of the passage seems to be Homeric. Again, the d4cyapov, or 6w/sa, was the dining- hall in which feasts were held, cf. Od. XX. 248 ff. etc., and finally, Dido, while upbraiding her faithless lover, laments that she has no little Aeneas to play in her aula, IV. 328. It does not help matters to suppose that aula here stands for atrium, as is commonly done in the case of III. 354 (Servius and Heyne seem to regard it as an a6Xh), although Vergil expressly says, 295, that Helenus is reigning over Grecian cities. It is much simpler to believe that Vergil is con- sistent (it is like him), and as he must have been acquainted with Greek houses, cf. Hor. Car. I. 3, i-8, it seems quite probable that he conceives of Helenus as receiving his guests in an abX4 such as he himself had seen. The other three passages in which aula occurs all point to an intentional use of the word as appropriate to the passage, not as a poetic makeshift- Aen. I. I40, the palace of Aeolus, cf. Od. X. 10; G. II. 504, of foreign conquests, cf. lines 487-97, which tend to give a Greek tone to the passage and suggest that the conquests are in the East; and G. IV. 202, where the bees in question are of the Greek variety, cf. I77, and therefore make an aiX\, figuratively speaking, even if they do elect Quirites, 201; for the poet is not to be held to too strict an account. Again, there is abundant evidence that Vergil was a careful user of words. The huts of Carthage are called magalia, I. 42I and IV. 259, and those of Libya mapalia, G. III. 340; a Trojan in prayer speaks of the tholos of a temple, IX. 406; and even his use of thalamus (the metre forbids cubiculum and dormitorium is late) goes to show how careful he was to be consistent. In three passages it refers to a room in Dido's palace, IV. 133, 392, 495; but in fourteen (?) others,- G. IV. I89, 333, 373: Aen.

IV. 18, 550; VII. 253, 388; IX. 59I; X. 388, 648; yet all but two of these, IX. 59I and X. 388, seem to be in keeping with the other passages and both cases occur in the later books, which show other evi- dences of increasing freedom in dealing with his subject. It is very probable, then, that Vergil means an abX\ when he uses aula; and, if he does, it seems clear that here again, in the two passages relating to Dido's palace, he has used the word atrium as an equivalent for the Homeric peyapov. Such an explana- tion relieves all four of the passages from difficulty, is in strict keeping with Vergil's methods and character, and is far more natural than the supposition that he pictures the houses of his own day and then attaches usages and customs of his remote ancestors to give the whole an antique flavor. He may indeed have been influenced somewhat in his conception of ancient palaces by what he saw about him in Rome; but that is quite a different matter from supposing that he took these things as a basis rather than his Homeric sources. I have thus far been able to find nothing in positive support of the above views. Ileyne compares I. 725 with Od. I. 365, and adds below: "Non lucernas vel candelabra posuit sed lychnos, funalia . . . cf. Odyss. 77, de regia Alcinoi, Ioo sqq.," and he says of porticibus longis, II. 528: " Si Homerica et non sua potius tempora sequutus est, atOovaav expressit, quae aiX//v ab utraque parte orna- bat"; but his note on II. 512 and the excursus on the passage make it clear that he holds practically the common view. He says: " Graecis poetis erat ara Iovis Hercei (Ai6b 'EpKetov) in atrio aedium Priami, iv aitzAx' eam aram Virgilius in impluvium, si interiora domus ita appellare licet, transtulit . . . ut Penatium ara esset; propius hoc ad Romanum morem. v. Excurs." In the excursus he makes interiora domus refer to the peristyliutm of a Roman house. He does, however, recognize that there are difficulties in the passage. If Vergil means the /J/^yapov, all these difficulties disappear, and that he does seems to be the only logical con- clusion; for, as was suggested at the beginning, he could not use a Latinized form of t?yapov. In the sense of the main hall of the avSpc^v, the word is cited only in Homer. In Herodotus it is used of sacred edifices alone, and in later times it seems to have been confined entirely to underground caves sacredc to Demeter and Persephone, in which sense it would probably have been understood by his readers, if Vergil had been bold enough to turn it into a Latin word. The best thing that he could do was to use the word atrium in its place, very much as we should use the word hall or halls to-day if writing a poem in English under similar circumstances; for it is probable that every foreign word which he used was familiar to his readers in the sense in which he used it. He accord- ingly used the technical term where he could do so, and translated elsewhere. Finally, the common view, that atria in the passages corresponds to aIX1, loses sight of the fact that the Homeric aOX1 was not a room at all, but an open, unpaved court. 25.

Notes on the Hippolytus of Euripides, by Professor J. E. Harry, of Georgetown College. I. THE CHARACTER OF PHAEDRA. Down to the time of Wilamowitz-M6llendorff it was generally believed that Euripides represented Phaedra as being what she pretended to be - a virtuous woman, who really tried to remain true to her husband, and earnestly desired that her passion for Hippolytus should not be revealed to the young man. Wilamowitz says this view is not the correct one, that Phaedra is only playing a part in her dialogue with the nurse (516-524), that she really sees through the design of her servant, and hopes that she will approach the youth for whom she has conceived such a strong passion. Kalkman follows W.-M.'s lead, and others subscribe to the same opinion. But, if we should adopt this view, would we not impute excessive subtlety to Euripides, as well as to Phaedra ? Would we not demand too much of the audience ? The average Athenian was not dull, but could he (in the brisk dialogue of Euripides) have taken all these subtle points which have escaped the scrutinizing glance of all the painstaking students, only to be discovered after the lapse of twenty-three hundred years ? If this was the poet's design, and he has lacked an interpreter from that day to this, was it not too deep for even the quick-witted Athenian ? Could he understand the real significance of Phaedra's words when she declared over and over again what her feelings are and what she has determined to do? Phaedra was not spotless any more than Hippolytus, but she could not be called unchaste.1 Every utterance of hers shows how she tried to stem the tide and die 6eKXEfs. Her great misfortune is not to have hearkened to the voice of reason in time. Whither her passion might have carried her (even the strongest have succumbed) we can only conjecture, for the nurse precipitates matters by revealing to Hippolytus the whole situation. That this was done without the queen's knowledge and consent is clear. That she, perhaps, intuitively divines somewhat of her servant's purpose without knowing to what lengths she would go, does not affect the question. In her present state of mind she is easily led on by the nurse. She is not able to take the lead herself until she is roused by the terrible reality, until her worst fears have been realized. Then she summons up all her strength and carries out her previous resolution, viz., to take her own life. But now her reputation is at stake, and another shall suffer as well as she KaK6Jv ye X&amp;TrPpy yev4ao-oaL Oavova' (728). This conception of Phaedra harmonizes with the circumstances attending the production of the two dramas. Euripides must have intended that his second play should be entirely changed: he could not have retained the old Phaedra without deceiving his audience, and this he would not wish his players to do; for, as Hamlet says, their business is to tell all.

In view of the stand taken in some quarters recently against the 'no-stage' theory, I merely wish to emphasize what Pickard says in the American Journal of Philology, Vol. XIV., p. 83: "The height of this 'stage,' the lack of means of communication with the orchestra, its slight depth, its distance from the cavea, the doors leading out on the level of the orchestra, the arrangement of the seats themselves, all unite to prove that this structure could never have been used as a stage.' At line 58 of the Hzippolytus a chorus of attendants enter, remain for some time, and depart with their master (1. II2). For this scene the broad level of the orchestra is better suited than the narrow platform of the stage. Indeed, to one who has had something to do with the management of a troop of young men on a much wider platform under not entirely dissimilar circumstances (at least so nearly alike that any difficulties of representation in the one would obtain for the other) it seems almost impossible to put this scene on a stage eight feet deep. So in the scene where Hippolytus and the nurse are within the palace. Phaedra is farther away from the audience than the chorus, and consequently nearer the palace. Suddenly she hears a noise within and commands the chorus to keep quiet that she may hear. It is Hippolytus upbraiding the nurse, and, as soon as she discovers the real state of affairs, she breaks out with: lh AfoL, alaJ alaZ. w o vaurdXava rdv itCSv 4 raO7i,drTwv (569-70). The chorus does not understand, and Phaedra bids the choreutae step up to the door and listen for themselves (ra?o5' nartraoa 7rt6XaLs). She does not tell them to mount an elevated stage. True, they do not move, but this is clearly a device of the poet to convey to the audience an account of what is going on in the palace (577-80). III. MISCELLANEOUS. 1. 32. C'K&amp;Srov is read by MAC2P and the scholiast, WK,rXov by VC1N. Editors vacillate between the two. Nauck reads 'K7c\XOp and says: " Kc8rnIov deteriores libri" (which is not true). Wilamowitz has cK85fJxov and translates ihr fernes Lieben. Wilhelm Pecz (in his study of the tropes in the three tragic poets, Berliner Studien fir class. Phil., Vol. III.) considers 9KcSrxJov as referring to Hip- polytus by metonymy (love for the lover). Weil proposes to alter these three lines, and omits pwo"' gpwr' CKor8bov. Bury (Class. Review, III. 220) feels sure that /KrlXov must be the true reading, but his arguments are not convincing. gK8a1Xov, conspicuous (cf. II. V. 2), makes sense-such as it is; the opposite dor\Xov, secret (7huc. VIII. xo8), would be just as appropriate. Cf. 40, 42, I39 (KpUvrrT irhvOe.). The passion was secret in both places (in Athens and at Troezen); it only became more violent when Phaedra came to the latter place. But many conjectures might be made, e.g. dX\yev6v (cp. 775), and yet none of them could be received as certain emendations. Blomfield, as well as Hartung, excises 32 and 33, but if these verses are removed, a sufficient explanation is wanting for 30 and 31: these two in turn are made necessary by 29. Moreover, iTrel 8U in 34 corresponds to 7rplv uv in 29. 1. 33. wcvbJ6uaev is the reading of the MSS. and the scholiast. Several changes have been suggested. Meineke and Wilamowitz read wv61aaoo. Kirch-</page><page sequence="64">Proceedings for July, 1896. hoff has 6vodao-ovt. The future is certainly to be desired, but the change is un- necessary: the tense can be explained on the basis of the praesens propheticum. 1. 42. 7rpa.ycua: MSS. Wilamowitz changes to 7rat5l, unnecessarily. His reviewer in the Classical Review says that it is a harmless reading, if it had MS. authority, and harmonizes with 520, as the traditional reading does with 690. Neither line affects the question particularly. Line 41 gives the negative, 42 the positive side. In 11. 43-46 mention is made of the death of Hippolytus, in 47 of Phaedra; so we have a regular gradation in time: Theseus, Hippolytus, Phaedra, the events referred to occurring in the reverse order -a sort of VOTepov rp6repov. The chorus swears /uzq&amp;v KaOKWV aov is /dos &amp;eietv 7rOTr (714); never- theless, the whole matter does come to the light. Cf. the exclamation of the chorus in 367 6XwXas, i~&gt;roaqvas es cdos KaKd. 1. 79. t'aots: MSS. Porson changed oaots to aorLs, a reading which is not objectionable, to be sure; but it is not so natural as 5aoos. Nauck says: mit Porson's Aenderung ist dem Sinn der Stelle wenig gedient. In spite of the fact that most editors have followed Porson (Monk, Weil, Wilamowitz, Nauck in the third edition) the MSS. reading seems to me to be preferable. Cf. 3, 6, 442, 451, 10I5, I302. Consider the sentence dXX' ... . 6. ws parenthetical, under- standing acIroIs with etrXerv, and it becomes clear. It is not necessary to make erX-Xev neuter, as in Hom. Od. IX. 160, for the verb means here 'took them for her own.' 11. i68-I69. Translate ' Much-revered by me she always comes to the rescue,' not as Mahaffy and Bury (after Weil) explain: 'she walks in the number of the gods,' nor as Paley takes it, 'thanks to the gods.' oipv OeolZo is a stereotyped phrase meaning ' with the blessing of heaven.' o5t-r is not used absolutely (the meaning is ' she comes to me') and this verb is purposely selected. /perT&amp; Oewv occurs only in H. F. I8o, where it is a matter of gods among gods. It is strange that this line has been so often misunderstood. Tycho Mommsen explained it correctly. Herwerden in Revue de Philol. for I878, p. 19, says: requiro Iv Oeo?otL otri, showing that he has the same conception of the passage as Weil, but is dissatisfied with the preposition o6v. Hadley changes porT' to oirTa, unnecessarily. 1. 277. Oave7v. This is the reading of the MSS. The only possible interpre- tation is that the nurse repeats the Oave?v of the chorus by way of reply, and then adds do-re6 5' els d7r6orTao-v f3lov to explain the means Phaedra chose: ' she desires to die, and to accomplish this, you see, she is starving herself.' The nurse knows her mistress wishes to die (248-9, 305, 314, and especially 322), but the cause which lies back of this resolution (rTb eLvov roO' 0 o-' ?jalpet Oaveiv) is what she has been trying so hard to discover (39-40, 271, 273 lrdvra -yAp oay? 7Trde, 279, 283, 284, 297, 303) and the very thing which Phaedra takes such pains to conceal. Consequently, no valid objection can be raised to the reading of the MSS. Wilamowitz feels sure that OaveZv has crept in from the preceding line; so he removes the word and fills up the gap with oicK o18', a harmless reading, but no better than many others which suggest themselves, eg. oy17 (cf. 273, 279, 297): the nurse reiterates that all her efforts have been in vain, and this word would be very appropriate here, in fact, more appropriate than oicK ol8', for the nurse does know the answer to the latter of the two questions (OavTeIv ~retpw/lUvr), as is shown by her interrogation in 322.

Barthold rejects the three lines: Nauck reads aKpitS-atLev and Wilamowitz a&amp;v rKplSfa3av for the MSS. dKpLPccbjetav. Probably the whole difficulty originated with this verb. If Eur. wrote aKcpi3a?et' &amp;v, the two words would soon coalesce, forming the plural, which would account for the changes in the preceding line.

Wecklein, Johnson (conj. et opt. usu Etripideo), Hadley and others transpose these two lines. The order in the MSS. is correct, for as soon as Phaedra says eetpcydateOfa, the chorus is eager to know what is the matter and can not refrain from asking. This necessitates a repetition of the command, which is given, not because the singing annoys the queen, but because she wishes to hear what is going on inside. Then the chorus complies with Phaedra's request and answers o-7y5. 1. 485. i\XXov dX'yiwv- this is a pleonasm which occurs as early as Homer. In Latin it is very old. Of the double comparative Pautus has three examples (Men. prol. 55, Poen. prol. 83, Pseud. 220-1). In early English it is by no means rare. I have been at the pains to count the number in Shakespeare's plays, and find 29 examples (not counting ' lesser'). 1. Ioi9. 7rpdoaa-eev y&amp;p ei: this is the reading of CVPNr and the scholiast. Nauck and Wilamowitz omit the et and insert re before yap. If this reading be accepted, the meaning must be: 'you have time to work,' i.e. to devote to any- thing which may interest you or engage your attention, whereas a monarch has no leisure, and, indeed, this is the interpretation of Wilamowitz, for he translates: so bleibi Raun zu schaffen und zu wirken. But 7rpcda-etv without a complement is rare except in the phrase Xiyet ref Kai 7rpdcaTetv. Ion, 730, seems to indi- cate the true reading: crbv ros qptXots 7&amp;yp i85 Atv TrpdCaetYv KaXws. This verse (xoI9) is introduced merely as an explanation or amplification of the preceding -- rpdcrOetv eF is merely another way of saying eOrvxeiv. Moreover, this thought harmonizes with the character of Hippolytus. 1. Io69. The MSS. read KaKc.v at the end. So Nauck and most editors. The text must be corrupt. Wilamowitz reads 86Jiwv.

In his "Old Northern Runic Monuments" (III. p. 236 = Handbook, p. I93), Stephens places side by side two gold coins, one of which presents a runic inscrip- tion. This coin was found in England, and is in the British Museum; the other is in the Leyden Museum. Stephens, as usual, regards the foreign coin as a copy of the English, but this is manifestly impossible; both are, rather, barbarian</page><page sequence="66">Proceedings for Jruly, 896. imitations of the same or similar originals. The faces of the coins present the head and shoulders of a beardless person facing the right. At his back is a square cross followed by an inscription running around the edge of the coin. The reverses of both present two full figures, hand in hand, and at the left a square cross followed by an inscription, of which only the letters ENE seem cer- tain in both. The inscription on the faces of the coins is, however, much better preserved. On the Leyden coin it appears distinctly +C 0 R N I L I 0 For the English coin Stephens gives +Cflfl fln i +IL I 0 It will be observed that the engraver had first copied CORNILIO from his original, and had then erased as much as was necessary to make room for his runic inscription, which is written from right to left, as is often the case in very early runic inscriptions. Inverting the runes, they are:- f't- I I :r ni All of these are regular Germanic as well as Old-English runes with the exception of the one before the last, which could only be a Scandinavian form of the rune for k. As nothing Scandinavian can be made out of the inscription, it is simplest to suppose that r is for ', and the loss of the small stroke is due either to inaccuracy in copying the coin, or to the fact that the coin is imperfectly struck, the ornamental rim being quite gone at this point, while the edge of the metal runs across the top of the rune itself. The inscription is then quite clear f --I DA P r h[A a n i b u uf u ' unity love' Of these, hlfu is the regular Old-English form for ' love.' In Tnibu we have a primitive Old-English form of an abstract formed from an 'one' by the usual abstract ending -ibu (Kluge, Stammbildungslehre, ? 121, etc.), the later classical form of which would be *en/zu, still later *9n,b (Sievers, ? 144 b, 244). In showing the original unsyncopated -i- of the ending -ibu (Gothic -i?ba), this primitive fnibu is, so far as my knowledge goes, the only Old-English form yet found. It might be asked whether the inscription is not perhaps to be read dnibu, that is, that b has its Germanic value of a rather than the Old-English value of e, and that the inscription belongs to the time preceding i-mutation. But, as I have shown in an article in Modern Language Notes for June 1896, the change of Germanic ai to Old-English d was accompanied by the change of runic | to , and we should therefore expect v if the d were not yet mutated to i. The inscription ini,bu iifit, or ' unity (and) love,' may have a political appli- cation, like the "Concordia," "Consensus," etc., of Roman coins (cf. "Consesus exercit" around two figures clasping hands, on a coin of Vespasian); or the coin lxv</page><page sequence="67">lxvi American Philological Association. may have been struck in honor of a royal wedding, and the figures on the reverse be regarded as symbolic. It may be added that Stephens' interpretation of the inscription is, as usual, not worth copying. He does not hesitate to render " by k, as though he were dealing with a Scandinavian inscription, and he perverts the perfect D (=b) into a bad p (=w), and then reads iEniwuluku(nung), which he thinks means ' King Anwulf,' though it sounds more like the name of a king of the Sandwich Islands. The consideration of the original of these barbarian coins, and of the lettering on the reverses, I shall reserve for another occasion.
