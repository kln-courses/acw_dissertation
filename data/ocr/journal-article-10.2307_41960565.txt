The problematic transnational links constructed between Italy, the Horn of Africa, and the Red Sea would also surface in the works of the most prominent film directors during Fascism, Alessandro Blasetti and Mario Camerini, and other important writers, like Giovanni Comisso, Ennio ñaiano and Giorgio Manganelli Introduction Italian colonialism in North and Northeast Africa began in the Red Sea area in the early 1880s and lasted until the early 1940s. Italy acquired Assab in 1882 and Massawa in 1885; in 1890, it established as a colony the whole of what was then called Eritrea. Italy started occupying Somalia in 1889, Libya in 1911, and finally occupied Ethiopia from 1935-36 until 1941. In 1936, Mussolini - who was in power from 1922 to 1943 - proclaimed the empire and created Africa Orientale Italiana (Italian East Africa) in the Horn of Africa. Although Italy obtained the fiduciary administration of Somalia between 1950 and 1960 from the United Nations, Italian colonialism in Africa came to a sudden, formal end through Italy's defeat in World War II, outside a proper decolonization process. In Italy's former colonies, the memory of colonialism has remained vivid. Yet for decades, Italian historiography after World War II tended to exclude colonialism from national history: in schools and universities, as much as in everyday life, the whole country largely forgot its colonial past. This happened for numerous, complex, and partly unclear social and historical reasons,1 including the difficulty of "digesting" the fascist past and the aforementioned lack of a decolonization process. The presence of Italian communities in northern Africa (Tunisia and Egypt in particular) in the nineteenth and twentieth century was also largely forgotten.2 Starting in the 1970s, the historiography has slowly begun to develop, mostly thanks to Angelo Del Boca's pioneering research.3 In the last ten years, there has been an increasing interest in the history of Italian colonial- ism from a postcolonial perspective.4 However, many of its aspects remain unexplored, particularly those related to the history of culture. Thus the interconnections between twentieth century Italian literary representations</page><page sequence="3">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 275 of the Horn of Africa and academic schools and anthropological scholarly theories during Italian colonialism have been largely understudied and underestimated. This article will thus explore, with an interdisciplinary démarche , the symbolic role played by colonialism in Italy following the country's unification in the 1860s. It will also consider the intellectual, cultural, and literary elaborations that stemmed from or were related to it. A close study of Italian literary and cinematic representations of Eritrea, Massawa, and the Red Sea reveals that during and after Italian colonialism, Italy and the Horn of Africa were interconnected through the Mediterranean and Red Sea by a link with many scholarly, literary, cultural, religious, and imaginary implications. This happened not only because the Horn of Africa found itself at the intersection of numerous colonialist, archeological, linguistic, commercial, and religious interests by the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but also because - as this article will argue - the transnational and multifaceted link designed by the Italians between Italy and the Horn of Africa articulated issues that, both before and during Fascism, agitated Italy's self-representation, its construction of a peculiar "modernity," and the building of Italian-ness. For these reasons, Italians looked at the Horn of Africa ambiguously in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. They constructed a cultural and scholarly "Mediterranean Africa" that was based on the legacies of ancient Rome and Latin antiquity, the age-old presence of a non-Western form of Christianity in "Abyssinia,"5 and the problems posed at home by the dualistic theorization of the Southern question and the mass-migration of working- class Italians overseas, and this "Mediterranean Africa" was instrumental to justifying Italian colonialism in North and Northeast Africa. In the 1930s, Fascism tried to stress the complete "otherness" of Northeastern Africa vis-à-vis Italy for political, strategic and racist reasons, while post-World War II Italy was strongly marked by a general oblivion towards its colonial past, including the cultural and intellectual elaborations connected to it.6 Nonetheless, some notions and ideas from the colonial past continued to operate throughout the twentieth century and survived until the 1970s. This article will also argue that, despite the aforementioned oblivious- ness, the transnational, scholarly, imaginary, and religious ties designed during colonialism resonated in the works of two of the most important Italian writers and intellectuals of the twentieth century, whose positions were in many aspects antithetical: the Egypt-born founder of Futurism,</page><page sequence="4">276 ■ Giovanna Trento Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944), and the writer and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975). In the first half of the twentieth century, the representation of Eritrea and the Red Sea in transnational terms had complex, challenging implications for Italian fictional literature and cinema and for Italy's self-representation. Other prominent intellectual figures also engaged with it, such as the two most active film-directors during Fascism, Alessandro Blasetti (1900-1987) and Mario Camerini (1895-1981), whose works were crucial for the development of neorealist cinema after World War II, Blasetti in particular. Writers Giovanni Comisso (1895-1969) and Ennio Flaiano (1910-1972) also focused on Massawa and the Horn of Africa, while in 1970, Giorgio Manganelli (1922-1990) still resorted to the established construction of "Mediterranean Africa" in his descriptions of Ethiopia. Most importantly, Pier Paolo Pasolini - one of the most prominent, radi- cal, leftist, antifascist, and (pre-)postmodern Italian intellectuals - repeatedly described Massawa, Eritrea, and the Eritreans in terms that were not only impregnated by his transnational, fluid, and "panmeridional" approach to the South(s), but also by previous Italian "orientalist" and colonialist discourses that ambiguously stressed the continuities between Italy and the Horn of Africa. Indeed, thanks to numerous epistemological, poetic and political tools (including the centrality of the Italian Southern question, the post-Gramscian discourses on Italian southern subalternity, and the influence of Panafricanism), Pasolini was able to build a de-territorialized and idealized never-ending South that included, produced, and reproduced multiple "Souths."7 Pasolini's "Pan-South" ( Panmeňdione ) is thus a non- geographical topos where "traditional" values are used in non-traditional and subversive ways, with the goal of resisting industrialization, mass media, and late-capitalist alienation.8 Nonetheless, Pasolini's "panmeridional" approach to Africa, the South, and subalternity somehow resembles the fluidity of "Mediterranean Africa" constructed during Italian colonialism. Even though Pasolini never appreciated Marinetti, the two are the twentieth century Italian writers who most focused upon Africa in trans- national terms. In so doing, both addressed Italian colonialism in Africa, though obviously with very different political and aesthetic goals. Pasolini was decidedly antifascist, while Marinetti was close to Mussolini, though political differences existed between them. Although further research should be carried out to critically compare and interrogate the fluidity of both Marinetti's Africa and Pasolini's "Pan-South," Pasolini's "panmeridional"</page><page sequence="5">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 277 approach pushes us to re-read Italians' unstable representations of the Horn of Africa, Massawa, and the Red Sea - places that, throughout the twentieth century, were subject to literary and cinematic representations as "liminal spaces" and repositories of "cultural ambiguities." North/South Dichotomies and the Fluidity of "Mediterranean Africa" Between the end of nineteenth century and the 1930s, some fluidity in the perception of Northeastern Africa emerged in both Italian anthropological theories and literary texts. However, such a transnational African-Medi- terranean intellectual, poetic, and imaginary space - where aesthetics and politics often interacted or collided - was connected to and complicated by some crucial "local" Italian factors that, through migration and colonialism, also had "global" repercussions. I will provide the reader with some preliminary tools to understand Italy's self-representation and the building of Italian-ness that I consider essential for understanding the symbolic role Italian colonialism in North- eastern Africa had for Italians before and during Fascism. Our re-reading of twentieth century Italian literary and cinematic representations of the Horn of Africa in a transnational perspective must take these elements into consideration. Italy's unification as a nation-state happened in the 1860s. Despite the fact that a massive process of industrialization occurred relatively late in comparison to other European countries,9 Italy began to accumulate small overseas possessions from the 1880s onwards. The Italian colonial enterprises to some extent resulted from British international policies and had "imitative" motivations related to national and international prestige. Hence in Italy the Oltremare (meaning "the colonies"), more than playing an active role in jump-starting industrial capitalism, had a symbolic and "imagined" role in perceiving "ourselves" as "more Italian" and "more modern" (an aspect that would be shared by Futurism). Considering Mediterranean theory and Mediterraneism in contemporary Italian thought, Claudio Fogu notes that: "In the decades after its national formation, and increasingly so in the first years of the twentieth century, Italy sought to appropriate the ancient Roman past of the peninsula for the</page><page sequence="6">278 ■ Giovanna Trento declared purpose of adding a sense of grandeur to its national identity, as well as to boost its claims to 'Great Nation' status." One key element of this reclaimed Roman heritage was the symbolic centrality of the Mediterranean Sea, the notion of Mare Nostrum, a concept that was able to provide "both an antidote to a widespread complex of 'military inferiority' following the defeat at Adwa in 1896 and a 'supplementary idea of belonging.'"10 More- over, as Ruth Ben-Ghiat points out, colonialism and the strengthening of the country's presence in the Mediterranean and Red Sea promised to allow Italy to finally emerge from marginality "by positioning it as the crucial bridge between Europe and Africa. The Italian south, in particular, would be rehabilitated, becoming a national asset rather than a site of backwardness and foreign scorn."11 On many levels, the Oltremare was one of the "driving myths" of Italy since the unification of the country and before and during Fascism.12 Colonialism in Africa and the dualistic theorization of the Italian Southern question had great symbolic relevance for the building of Italian-ness and Italy's attempts at "modernization," an issue Futurism engaged with directly. Indeed, "Italian Africa" did not only represent the "elsewhere"; it was also instrumental to the self-representation of Italy. This became quite evident in 1911, when many intellectuals, including anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi, proudly celebrated fifty years of unification and modernization by stressing the myth of the "greater Italy" (Grande Italia ) and strongly endorsing the Libyan war.13 The occupation of Libya was supported not only by nationalist and conservative groups, but also by groups and individuals with socialist sympathies, including poet Giovanni Pascoli. Pascoli's speech La grande Proletaria si è mossa ( The Great Proletarian is Moving On), first published in La Tribuna on 27 November 1911 and often republished, evoked Italy's efforts of nation-building through the Risorgimento and colonialism. It praised the ancestry of Rome, recalled the trauma of Adwa (where Italians had been defeated in 1896 by "barefooted Africans"), and welcomed the Libyan campaign as the "national" solution for the painful international mass-migration of working-class Italians.14 Similarly, Enrico Corradini and many right-wing intellectuals believed the welding of "modernity" with spiritual values of ancient Rome's heritage was the key trait in the search for a foundation myth for the very young Italian nation.15 All this happened in a country where the sense of belonging to a unified</page><page sequence="7">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 279 nation was (and partly still is) based on picturing a clear division between a developed North and a rural South. After unification, the need to consider the social and economic problems of southern Italy as essential elements of the new Italian state was accompanied by the need to build up an exhaustive and comprehensible description of the South. The notion of the Southern question ( Questione meridionale ) thus arose in the 1860s in the work of Pasquale Villari and was developed by many others,16 including Gaetano Salvemini and Antonio Gramsci. The latter did so in new, challenging terms, and provided southern peasants with some agency and new political self-determination within and beyond Marxist discourse. Nevertheless, in the nineteenth century, the concept of the Southern question emphasized the gap between North and South, so much so that the image of southern Italy became increasingly homogeneous and the Italian South was finally perceived as the "other."17 During the colonial period, this foundational duality between two different geographical and symbolic topoi - the North and the South of Italy - remained important to Italy's self-representation. The dualistic theo- rization of the Southern question crystallized in the image of the landless southern peasant who came to be an insider and an outsider simultaneously, a foundational element of the national identity and the "other inside the country."18 Such dualistic and oxymoronic baggage has produced persistent confusions among Italians between the "self" and the "other than one's self," as much as between "colonizer" and "colonized," and these are particularly evident in the ambiguities that characterized how colonial concubinage was managed and perceived by Italians during and after colonialism.19 While Italy's North-South dichotomy was a meaningful symbol within the national borders, an ambiguous solution of the dualistic theorization of the Southern question was attempted in the colonies. The colonial Horn of Africa thus became the extreme southern Italy of and for a "greater Italy," where landless peasants were supposedly going to find their piece of land and become less subaltern. Already by the end of the nineteenth century, prime minister Francesco Crispi wished to combine the expansionist African policies with the phenomenon of Italian mass emigration, expecting Africa (the "Abyssinian plateau" in particular) to supply land to Italian needy farm- ers and peasants.20 As Gramsci sharply noted in his Prison Notebooks , "The Southern peasant wanted land; Crispi did not want to give it to him within Italy itself, he did not want to practice 'economic Jacobinism'; he presented</page><page sequence="8">280 ■ Giovanna Trento him with the mirage of exploitable colonial lands. Crispi's imperialism was a passionate rhetorical imperialism without a financial-economic base."21 These complex political and cultural scenarios were accompanied by zealous "scientific" efforts by Italian anthropologists and sociologists like Cesare Lombroso, Giuseppe Sergi, and Alfredo Niceforo. Their notions of "race" or "species" fluctuated between positivistic enthusiasm, the memory of the Risorgimento1 s spiritualism and patriotism, "Roman-spiritualistic" racism, and the legacies of Latin antiquity.22 Following the unification of the country, Italian scholars formulated multiple and ambiguous responses to North-European Aryanism, the "Indo-European" concept, and the so-called Latin/southern degeneration.23 At the very end of the nineteenth century, the locally influential and internationally well-known anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi responded to the claims of Aryanism by theorizing the "Euro-African species,"24 which in his view had not come from Asia and the North but instead from Africa and the Mediterranean. Sergi's Homo eurafricanus had three varieties, the African, the Mediterranean and the Nordic, and the Mediterraneans and Nordics - both "Hamites" - had originated in the Horn of Africa.25 Besides elevating the populations of East Africa in contrast to those "prognathous" of Sub-Saharan western Africa, Sergi's volumes26 on the genetic continuity between the northern and southern populations of the Mediterranean and those of the Horn of Africa implicitly sanctioned the legitimacy of Italian colonialism, though Sergi himself was not especially militaristic.27 In addition, Sergi's theories constructed the inhabitants of western Sub-Saharan Africa as the "absolute other," while the "insider" of Italian East Africa became the "internal other" within a larger Empire, thus projecting and reproducing on a colonial scale the national terms of North/ South dichotomies and ambiguities. Although the ideas of Latin regeneration and Mediterranean unity flourished until the mid 1930s, Aryanism and Mediterraneanism coexisted in Italian colonial discourse, and the two racial ideas alternately converged and diverged.28 Christianity was - at least in theory - an additional ele- ment of cohesion between Italy and the Horn of Africa, since the Horn was inhabited by Orthodox Christians, especially in the highland plateau. However, from the 1890s onwards, relations with Islam in the Italian colony of Eritrea were a key issue for Italian colonial rule and became instrumental to stability in the region.29 Although Fascism officially banned</page><page sequence="9">From Marinetti to Pasolini m 281 any theorization of consanguinity between Italians and Northeast Africans by the late 1930s,30 the construction of "Mediterranean Africa" (as far as the Horn was concerned) kept operating through the study of Greek and Latin antiquity.31 Although Giuseppe Sergi's theories were officially displaced by those of other fascist scientists like Lidio Cipriani, they remained somehow valuable to the regime through their stress on the centrality of Rome and the Mediterranean area.32 Hence Giuseppe Sergi remained influential for much of the twentieth century, as attested by the fact that his son, Sergio, was a prominent anthropologist during Fascism and kept his academic position even in post-fascist Italy. Marinetti's Africa, Modernism, and Futurist Primitivism After World War II, Italy largely forgot its colonial past on many levels. Such a lack of awareness seems particularly inappropriate in a country where "culture" has for centuries been considered potentially crucial to effecting social change,33 and where modernism bound together "culture" and "politics" at the beginning of twentieth century.34 The founder of Futurism, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, was born in Alexandria in 1876 to Italian parents, and was raised in there speaking French, Arabic, and Italian. He began his literary career in 1902 as a francophone writer and wrote the Futurist Manifesto, which was published in 1909 in Italy and France, most famously in the French newspaper Le Figaro on 20 February 1909. 35 As Emilio Gentile points out, "Italian modernists, much more than other European modernists, had a political vocation, with strong national- ist connotations which manifested themselves principally in the myth of national regeneration."36 The birth of Futurism was influenced by numerous political issues related to Italian colonialism and imperialism, migration to Africa, the building of Italian-ness, and the urge for "modernization" of the country, symbolized by the futurists' focus on the city, the machine, and - partly - the colony. Marinetti's excessive love for his motherland can be partly explained as the loud nationalism of an "Italian from overseas,"37 but it also has much to do with his desire for "modernization." Marinetti's perception of Italy's late industrialization as a shortcoming constituted one of the main motivations of Futurism's antipassatismo ("anti-traditionalism").38 Moreover, Marinetti was</page><page sequence="10">282 ■ Giovanna Trento one of the main exponents of what Emilio Gentile defines as early twentieth century Italian "modernist nationalism," characterized by an enthusiastic and tragic sense of "modernity," a "modernity" conceived as an explosion of energies and combative vitality.39 While the nationalistic and imperialistic view expressed in the early twentieth century by writer and politician Enrico Corradini, and later by Fascism, praised Latin antiquity and stressed the legacies of ancient Rome, Futurism's imperialist "modernist nationalism" rejected the myth of ancient Rome as the glue between Italy and its colonies in the name of anarchist "anti-traditionalism."40 Nonetheless, Futurism's iconoclastic dreams and Italian colonial imagery shared some basic characteristics at the beginning of the twentieth century. One of the main goals of futurist artists and activists was to perceive themselves and the whole country as "more Italian" and "more modern" by pursuing a "wild," anarchic, and oxymoronic "futurist primitivism."41 Influenced by Nietzsche's philosophy, Marinetti wrote his first work set in Africa before drafting the Futurist Manifesto, the grotesque, flamboyant, and sometimes pornographic novel Mafarka le futuriste.42 His later works repeatedly focused on Africa: La battaglia di Tripoli ( The Battle of Tripoli), of 1912, meant to support the Libyan Campaign; the novel Gli indomabili (The Indomitable Ones), of 1922; the travel-book II fascino dell'Egitto ( The Charm of Egypt), of 1933; Il Poema Africano della Divisione "28 Ottobre " (The African Poem of the "October 28th" Division), of 1937, which supported the Ethiopian Campaign; and finally the paper he delivered in fascist Rome in 1938 at the Vili Convegno Volta, titled L'Africa generatrice e ispiratrice di poesia e arti (Africa Generating and Inspiring Poetry and Arts), published in 1940.43 Mafarka must be read as the foundational myth and the primitivist allegory of Futurism, and it was preceded by a call for poets and artists to support Futurism and get rid of sentimentalism and traditionalism. Mafarka portrays the huge virility of the African king Mafarka, who is a grotesque self-portrait of Marinetti himself.44 King Mafarka autonomously gives birth to an immortal being named Gazurmah - Futurism itself- which is "something" between a human being and a machine, thus highlighting the futurist aesthetic approach to technology and the anthropomorphic forms taken by futurist machinery. Mafarka is set in Africa, but where exactly the reader is not told. Here Africa is a fluid notion, which has both autobiographical and literary</page><page sequence="11">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 283 connotations. Mafarka celebrates the mythical shift from the ancestral and irrational era of matriarchy to the dynamic, free and rational era of patriarchy; a shift that takes place on the regenerating African soil from which the futurist being can finally spring forth. In the novel, one can perceive subtle references to Aeschylus's tragedy, the Oresteia, mediated through Bachofen's work on matriarchy ( Das Mutterrecht, 1861), which had far reaching reverberations in Europe during the second half of the nineteenth century.45 Surprisingly, sixty years later, Pasolini would also set his version of Aeschylus's tragedy in Africa, filming the 1970 work Appunti per un'Orestiade Africana (Notes for an African Oresteia ) for the most part in the erstwhile colonial territories of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Tanzania and Uganda. Although Marinetti's political and aesthetic positions did not allow him to pursue the fluidity of "Mediterranean Africa" by stressing Romanità (ancient Roman values), numerous details in Mafarka - the names given to places and characters, the nuances of people's skin colors, the style of their clothes, and more - suggest that the novel takes place somewhere in the fluidity of Northeastern Africa. If Mafarka's picture of Africa owes much to nineteenth century French literary culture, Marinetti's Africa is also impregnated with issues related to Italian colonialism and - as ever - Italy's self-representation. Although Giovanni Lista sees Futurism as a "strong historiographical object" which impregnates the arts in Italy throughout the twentieth century, he stresses the influence of French symbolist poetry and the decadent movement on Mafarka and denies the legacies between this novel and Italian colonialism and colonial imagery.46 In contrast, Luigi Ballerini and Mario Casari (thanks to Alessandro Bausi's indications) highlight how Mafarka contains a wealth of eccentric terms that Marinetti re-invented after taking inspiration from not only his North African childhood, Arabic, and Berber, but also from colonial atlases, Amharic, and other languages of Eritrea and Somalia.47 Indeed, when Marinetti wrote Mafarka, the battle of Adwa had taken place a dozen years earlier, and Italians had already spent approximately twenty-five years in Eritrea. The first chapter of Mafarka, titled "The Rape of Black Women," pro- vides a long scene of group-rape preceded by a powerful and carnal image of cannibalism. The rape symbolizes a purifying bath in the African mud and a regenerating leap into primordial sexual violence. When the black</page><page sequence="12">284 ■ Giovanna Trento soldiers rape black women, we read: "These [the soldiers] had laid down all the writhing, battered negresses in the slime, as they wielded their tanned black members, more sinuous than tree-roots. You saw the lithe glistening bellies of the young women, and their little breasts the color of burnt cof- fee, writhing with pain under the heavy fists of the males, whose loins of bronze threshed tirelessly up and down amid the churning dance of green putrefaction. [ . . . ] For sometimes the women bucked with a pleasure all the more bitter for being unwilling, in the backlash of a forcible spasm."48 Ruth Ben-Ghiat does not hesitate to label Mafarka a "colonial novel," seeing it as a canonic literary example and antecedent of that "tradition of fetishizing the female black body that had permeated Italian high culture and commercial culture by the 1930s."49 However, despite the novel's unquestionable ties with Italy's "diffused colonial culture,"50 the majority of characters are Blacks and/or Africans, and some have autobiographical goals, making the novel's play of roles particularly complex. Of particular interest is the image of cannibalism contained in the first chapter of Mafarka, which recalls the notion of the Italian "other inside the country" (the icon of the landless southern peasant) and the shift of such a notion from Italy to Africa through colonialism. In fact, when Magamal - king Mafarka's beloved African brother51 - refers to the "black Africans" (mes nègres ) who were about to become his subjects, he envisages an act of anthropophagy according to which the "subject," the "other," and the "subjugated self' are simultaneously portrayed as oppressed and rejected by their "master" and "colonizer," and yet also as retained and introjected by him. Magamal states: "I'm drinking in your stinking oily breath with such intense delight, my beloved negroes, my future subjects! ... I feel you all in my mouth, and chew you gladly, like fine ripe figs . . . Soon I shall swallow you without spitting out the skin!"52 Liminal Spaces and Cultural Ambiguities (1930s-1940s) In the 1930s and 1940s, the relations between Italy and the Horn of Africa were marked by violent dramatic events - the invasion of Ethiopia, the promulgation of racist legislation, World War II, the fall of Fascism, and the sudden end of Italian colonialism. These events entailed the deployment of hundreds of thousands of men from Italy to the Horn and the Red Sea area,53</page><page sequence="13">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 285 and also the transfer of goods and symbolic objects, such as the arduous 1937 shipping of the Aksum stele from Massa wa to Naples as a spoil of war.54 At the beginning of the 1930s, Fascism motivated subaltern Italians to fight a war in the Horn of Africa through propaganda and popular culture, both to "redeem" and colonize Ethiopia and to become "more modern" and "more Italian" through colonialism. The fascist invasion of Ethiopia in 1935-36 was accompanied by cultural and economic autarchy policies.55 The invasion resonated loudly nationwide because it was associated with the establishing of the empire and avenged the defeat suffered by the Italian army in Adwa in 1896. The 1930s were marked by more violent and racist approaches to Africa and colonialism and by a conservative radicalization of the sense of Italian-ness. In the Horn, Fascism increased street violence, banned (or tried to ban) amorous relationships between Northeast Africans and Italians, and pursued racist segregation.56 Nevertheless, two significant films of the 1930s, Aldebaran and II grande appello, show that prominent Italian directors still perceived the Red Sea as a fluid topos , apt to fantasize Italians' uncertain, elusive and in-progress sense of Italian-ness. Here I obviously cannot outline the complexity of Fascism's cultural policies.57 Fascism's necessity of building an Italian popular culture and its pursuit of a fascist national tradition were articulated through the stress put on Strapaese and Stracittà, meaning on both "traditional" and "modern" aspects, "rural" and "urban" models in Italian society.58 Film directors Mario Camerini and Alessandro Blasetti articulated, respectively, the urban and the rural vocation of Italian cinema during Fascism, although they often contaminated both aspects.59 Around 1930, Blasetti - one of the main precursors of post-war neorealist cinema60 - set out to discover the underrepresented, popular and rural Italy and directed Sole (Sun) and Terra madre ( Mother Earth).61 In 1935, Blasetti directed Aldebaran, a film in which the protagonist is actually the Red Sea. Although it is never openly portrayed, it is constantly evoked. In Aldebaran, the Red Sea is presented not only as a source of orientalist icons and exotic beauty, but also as an ideal transnational topos through which the leading characters finally manage to find their "appropri- ate" place in the Italian civil society and familial order. Indeed, Aldebaran focuses on the conflicting marriage relationship of a young Italian woman and an officer named Corrado. Their restless love is ultimately elevated and cemented by Corrado's departure to the Red Sea as captain of a military</page><page sequence="14">286 ■ Giovanna Trento ship. The couple's sense of Italian-ness eventually finds a more harmonious, less contradictory, and ideal realization by being projected onto the Horn through the Red Sea. The man's honor, implicitly strengthened by the fascist colonial "exploits" in Africa alluded to in the film, also reverberates onto his woman since it is transmitted patrilineally among "pure" Italians from father to son, echoing the first "symptoms" of the fascist racist legislation enacted in the colonies by Mussolini in the 1930s. In fact, during the first half of the 1930s African-Italians in the Horn, the meticci, became the target of a preliminary set of racist decrees issued from Rome,62and in 1937, the banning of colonial concubinage between Italian men and African women paved the way to wider racist legislation enacted in 1938 against Jews, Africans, homosexuals, and other minorities.63 During the 1930s, métissage and its representations were progressively abolished by Fascism.64 Nevertheless, at the beginning of II grande appello {The Big Call ) - co-written by Mario Soldati and filmed by Mario Camerini in Italian East Africa in 1936, at the dawn of State racism - we can clearly see Marinetti's eloquently titled 1918 booklet How to Seduce Women ( Come si seducono le donne ) in the hands of an Italian sailor leaving for the Red Sea ,65Aldebaran and II grande appello are indeed indicative of the complexity and the contradictions of the Italian case, since both films mix together explicit or implicit references to the legacies of Roman antiquity, the patriotic fascist appropriation of Giuseppe Mazzini's ideas, Mediterranean- ism, the erotic icon of the "black Venus," fascist racism, and the banning of miscegenation. James Hay notes that "as a geographical and cultural frontier, colonial Africa was (for Italian movie audiences) emblematic of 'contested space,' a realm where the rules seemed to be renegotiated at every turn."66 In II grande appello, the protagonist Giovanni runs a bar and hotel (indicatively called Oriente ) in French Djibouti on the Red Sea that is such a "contested space." It is a place where at the beginning of the film cultural and linguistic displacement are performed through the use of many different languages, and one where Giovanni's sense of Italian-ness finally starts to awaken, despite and thanks to this displacement. After spending his life abroad in mediocrity and subterfuge, constantly escaping his moral and civic respon- sibilities, Giovanni finally abandons his dubious activities and his "foreign" Spaniard lover in Djibouti.67He returns "home" to "Abyssinia" and joins with his righteous and patriotic son on the Italian frontlines. Giovanni finds a</page><page sequence="15">From Marinetti to Pasolini m 287 noble and worthy death in the Ethiopian campaign, his final redemption coming at the hands of those "Abyssinians" that he had previously helped to arm from Djibouti.68 Despite being the first patriotic colonial film openly devoted to the Ethiopian campaign, fl grande appello was not widely supported by the fascist cinema system because it was not considered sufficiently propagandistic, since it showed Fascism in an anti-heroic fashion.69 As Ruth Ben-Ghiat points out, "Giovanni embodies the uncertain nationality and low status which was the destiny of the diasporic Italian before fascism. "70Ultimately and essentially, Giovanni remains an anti-hero, whose renewed attachment to Italy is only due to his provisional displacement in the Horn of Africa. Writer Giovanni Comisso sailed to the Far East in 1929-30, with a stop in Eritrea. Although he was not a big supporter of fascist colonialism, he later reported in 1937 from "Italian East Africa" for the newspaper Gazzetta del popolo .71 In his memoir Amori d'Oriente ( Oriental Loves), written in 1929-30 and published in 1948, Comisso referred to the Red Sea as a trait d'union between Italy and the "Orient." Similar is his Gioco d'infanzia ( Childhood Game), written in 1931-32 and published in 1965, a memoir that largely takes place in Massa wa, a sensual city hit by an "infernal climate." While on the ship entering the Red Sea through Suez, Comisso's autobiographical main character fantasizes about his arrival on the Eritrean coast: "He was thinking of unexpected adventures in the new imminent lands. He desired pleasure."72 In Comisso's descriptions of Massa wa, the Italian presence in the area is clearly stated. Gioco d'infanzia also lingers on local brothels and the fear of contagion through sexual intercourse with Africans (elements that would also appear in Ennio Flaiano's African novel), revealing Comisso's concern with the issues of contamination and miscegenation that fascist colonialism directly faced.73 In postwar, post-fascist Italy, the difficulty of "digesting" the fascist past was one of the main reasons the country was marked by a strong, but some aspects only apparent, general "colonial oblivion" that dragged in pre-fascist colonialism. For this reason, literary and cinematic representations of Italy's former colonies (and of Africa in general) were very rare after World War II and the fall of Fascism, with Ennio Flaiano's 1947 novel Tempo di uccidere ( A Time to Kill ) representing an important exception.74^ Time to Kill is the first and only novel written by Flaiano, who later became internationally famous as a screenwriter who worked extensively with Federico Fellini and</page><page sequence="16">288 ■ Giovanna Trento other prominent directors. Despite the fact that Flaiano's novel won the first award of a very prestigious literary prize in 1947 ( Premio Strega ), the style of the book, its oneiric and non-realistic atmosphere, and - most of all - its colonial topic made it an isolated literary case that did not match the Italian "neorealistic" (often South oriented) literary and cinematic vogue of those years.75 Although Flaiano's novel has recently received increasing national and international attention (including in postcolonial studies), the colonial dimension of the book has been underplayed by Italian critics for decades.76 The novel features the non-heroic adventures of an Italian lieutenant in the Horn of Africa during the Ethiopian campaign, which Flaiano himself took part in as a second-lieutenant.77 The lieutenant semi-accidentally kills an African he had occasionally had sex with. Afterwards, he wanders in "Abys- sinia" haunted by various distressing feelings. Tempo di uccidere provides numerous anguishing and humorous descriptions of the Horn's landscapes and inhabitants, directly engaging Italian colonialism in the region, and it closes with the main character's relief-providing departure for Italy from the port of Massawa. Ultimately, though, the entire book rotates around the fear of contagion, making the sexual encounter between the Italian protagonist and the young Northeast African woman that is recounted at the beginning of the story the core of Flaiano's novel. Even more strongly than in Comisso's work, Flaiano's protagonist's obsession with contagion expresses the ambiguous mix of desire and rejection, of mirroring and oppression, that characterized Italy's approach to African colonial subjects. For this reason, I am keen to consider A Time to Kill more as the last Italian "colonial novel" than the first postcolonial one, despite the fact that the novel's main male character is definitely a post-fascist anti-hero.78 Flaiano's novel possesses several elements that recurred in colonial fictional representations of Ethiopia and Eritrea: the centrality of the erotic element, the relevance of military life, and the use of biblical references,79 which as Charles Burdett points out, were common in 1930s' Italian descriptions of Ethiopia.80 By 1970, Pasolini would also occasionally rely on biblical images to describe Eritreans. Pasolini in Eritrea The poet, filmmaker, and prolific writer Pier Paolo Pasolini is the Italian author who most continuously and significantly focused on sub-Saharan</page><page sequence="17">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 289 Africa, Africans, and their diaspora in the second half of the twentieth century. In so doing, he also described Eritrea and Eritreans in terms that - exceptionally in those years - allowed Italian colonial memory to emerge, despite the general "colonial oblivion" of the era. The entirety of Pasolini's "African regard" was influenced by Marxist, Panafricanist, anticolonialist, Gramscian and post-Gramscian discourses,81 but it was also affected by Italy's self-representations (including the centrality of the dualistic theorization of the Southern question) and by the construction of a "Mediterranean Africa" that emerged during Italian colonialism.82 Between 1968 and the mid-70s, an Eritrean corpus can be detected in Pasolini's work.83 In those years, he travelled more than once to the Horn of Africa. In his writings, he repeatedly focused on Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Eritreans: the 1968 Poesia amanea, in which Pasolini tries to transcribe some Amharic words;84 the two posthumous travelogues La grazia degli Eritrei (The Eritreans' Grace ) and Postscriptum a "La grazia degli Eritrei " ( Postscript to the " Eritreans ' Grace"), written, respectively, in 1968 and 1973, but both published in 1981; and the article Le mie "Mille e una notte " ( My "Arabian Nights"), published in 1973. Pasolini also filmed approximately one third of his 1974 film II fiore delle Mille e una notte (Arabian Nights) in Eritrea in the vicinity of Asmara.85 His last works, the film Salò , or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975) and the unfinished novel Petrolio (1992, posthumous), also explicitly or implicitly refer to Eritrea and Eritreans, at least in terms of self-quotations from the "Eritrean texts" mentioned above.86 In La grazia degli Eritrei, Pasolini described Eritreans as follows: "Very beautiful, indeed. [ . . . ] Their heads, with frizzy, almost shaved hair, are heads of statues. Their Semitic or Arab traits are as perfect as those of animals, and there isn't an eye that shines without a wonderful light that has no depth, a grace that is mysteriously without mystery. [ . . . ] They are a population of peasants, but for centuries in their villages private property has not existed. The land is held collectively and the fields' ownership rotates among families. This means that Eritreans have not been used to ownership for centuries. This probably gives them that graceful detachment from all things and the sense of natural (neither servile nor proud) equality with everybody."87 When reading this passage, it should not be forgotten that while Pasolini was growing up in colonial and imperial Italy, the fascist regime republished many colonial works that had been written during pre-fascist colonialism,</page><page sequence="18">290 ■ Giovanna Trento with the aim of building up an "imperial culture" that would prepare Italy for the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. La grazia degli Eritrei is Pasolini's work that most sharply - if partly unconsciously - bears reminiscences of nine- teenth and early twentieth century Italian scholarly and missionary writings on the Horn of Africa. These include Giuseppe Sapeto's Viaggio e missione cattolica ai Mensa ai Bogos e agli Habab, an 1857 book that highlighted the "classic beauty" of those East-African peoples,88 the anthropological theories on race and species like Giuseppe Sergi 's aforementioned Homo eurafricanus, and scholarly literature produced during Italian colonialism in the region, especially the 1916 study by linguist and ethnographer Carlo Conti Rossini on different forms of land tenure in the region,89 from which Pasolini might have taken his references to collective ownership of Eritrean lands.90 Writer Giorgio Manganelli, a prominent exponent of literary neoavan- guardia whose intellectual positions were far from Pasolini, also travelled to central and eastern Africa during this same period. In 1970, Manganelli wrote Viaggio in Africa (A Journey in Africa ), published "privately" in 2006 but still unavailable on the editorial market,91 a short African travel-book that offers interesting notes on Ethiopia and Addis Ababa and highlights how the legacies of the supposedly archetypical Mediterranean culture and the archaic Ethiopian one remained fundamental to Manganelli's representations of the Horn of Africa. Pasolini's La grazia degli Entrei, (The Erìtreans ' Grace ) exalted the "grace" of Eritreans and presented their physical beauty as both an ethical and aesthetic value: "It is their inner beauty that is physical beauty."92 Although Jonathan Miran notes "the captivating grace that anyone who knows Eritre- ans recognizes instantly,"93 the term "grace" is recurrent in Pasolini's work and does not uniquely apply to Eritreans. "Grace" summarizes theological, aesthetic, and erotic elements proper to his epistemological and poetic approach to subalternity, peasantry, and the "Pan-South," an approach that is sometimes marked by the essentialization and idealization of subaltern bodies.94 From the late 1960s onwards, Pasolini saw Italian subaltern classes undergoing dreadful and destructive "anthropological mutation, "95thus sinking into the "unreal" and alienated condition proper to late-capitalism.96 Yet in 1968's La grazia degli Eritrea, he described Eritreans' bodies as the repository of the "grace," "reality,"97 and sacredness that in his view characterized the peasant, subaltern, and "popular body."98 But five years</page><page sequence="19">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 291 later, in 1973, the enthusiastic portrait of Eritreans contained in La grazia degli Eritrei would be completely overturned by Pasolini's second Eritrean travelogue, Postscriptum a "La grazia degli Eritrei, " highlighting the great instability that characterized Pasolini's approach to the Horn of Africa. This instability was perfectly in tune with the liminal place that Eritrea occupied for decades in the eyes of Italians. The term "grace" also has a clear religious connotation in Pasolini's work, since it echoes the theological concept of "charisma," a divinely conferred power or talent. Referring to Christian and biblical elements to describe the Horn of Africa and its peoples was not unusual, and can also be found in colonial literature such as Alberto Pollera 's I Baria e i Cumana, among others." Similarly, after visiting Eritrea as vice-president of the Royal Commission of Inquiry, the writer and politician Ferdinando Martini published a book in 1891 in which "Affrica" - instead of the standard Italian Africa - is described not only as a miserable place, but also as a pure and primordial one, where the human spirit can elevate itself and meet God.100 Such religious baggage is evident in Pasolini's description of old Ortho- dox African priests in his article Le mie "Mille e una note. " He writes, "Three or four old men - tall, dressed in white biblical rags - were praying holding a book. Their way of praying was completely different from the Catholic one (maybe a little closer to the naive and idealistic way of the protestants). In fact, they were not ashamed of praying. They did not internalize praying. They did not hide it from the gaze of others. On the contrary, praying provided them with a sense of self-completeness; it exalted them for what they were; it made them manifest in their full presence."101 This passage vaguely alludes, among other things, to the presence in Eritrea of various Christian churches and traditions, including protestant missionaries. By 1923 though, they had all been expelled by Rome.102 Before describing Eritreans, La grazia degli Eritrei stereotypes Eritrean landscapes, referring to Massawa and Asmara.103 The first city appears as a smaller, "domesticated" and completely unexpected version of "Babylon the great, the prostitute," with implicit references to John's apocalypse. Pasolini writes, "I think none of us would ever expect Massawa to be anything other than the replica of a petty, miserly and provincial Italian town, with its Veneto's family-names on shop-signs and its espressos . . . Nothing of that, nothing. Massawa is a small apocalyptic city."104 Massawa is blessed with "the suffocating, corrupting air of the tropical apocalypse,"</page><page sequence="20">292 ■ Giovanna Trento with its port, big ships, sailors, prostitutes, desperate night-clubs, and the pervading memory of war that also characterizes Asmara; "Nothing pleasant, just the usual tragic, tropical air, corrosion and decay."105 Nevertheless, for Pasolini Massawa is African, Arab, and marvelous; it provides the sensual and adventurous European (as Pasolini implicitly pictures himself) with the full and unusual "thrill of the exotic realistic" ( l'ebrezza dell'esotico realistico ): "For those who love that Africa influenced by Arab culture, the whole is a wonderful thing: the city-center dense and narrow, with its pale blue and yellow portico little houses; that is, plastered with those sad colors of dirty laundry that, wholly, provide the sensual and adventurous European with the thrill of exotic realistic (which is doubtlessly a new mental category)."106 Conclusion Pasolini's description of Massawa introduces the new category of the esotico realistico ("exotic realistic"), which, on one hand, summarizes the "realistic" and "exotic" - or better the political and aesthetic - concerns that were oxymoronically proper to Pasolini's poetic universe in its whole, and to his approach to subalternity and "otherness" in particular. But this new category also reminds us of the problematic convergence between nineteenth century exoticism and colonialism and late twentieth century postmodernism.107 Indeed, Pasolini was the Italian author who not only focused most continuously on the African "other," but also one of the writers who, most strongly and incisively, pioneered "postmodernism" in Italy, as is particularly evident in his posthumous novel Petrolio. While acknowledging Pasolini's originality, daring courage, and dis- turbing provocativeness, other important and still understudied aspects of his work need to be highlighted. In particular, the fluid, "panmeridional" approach that characterized Pasolini's attitude towards peasantry, the Italian South, urban ghettos, Africa, and the multiple "Souths" that he observed and re-elaborated throughout his life is partly indebted to the early twentieth century fluidity of Marinetti's Africa and the colonial construction of "Medi- terranean Africa." Such subtle fluidity and continuity is evident in close, interdisciplinary and critical observation of the representations of the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea in Italian literature and cinema. This observation must be further explored by taking into consideration the multifaceted</page><page sequence="21">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 293 intellectual, cultural, anthropological, and imaginary links forged between Italy and the Horn in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.108 After the unification of the country and until the rise of Fascism, colonialism in Africa and the dualistic theorization of the Southern ques- tion were fundamental for Italy's self-representation and the building of Italian-ness. They also influenced the shape taken by Futurism and the fascist construction of a national popular culture. Despite the fact that Fascism tried to stress the complete "otherness" of East-Africans through the promulgation of racist legislation in the 1930s, the sudden end of both Fascism and colonialism in the 1940s, and the "colonial oblivion" that characterized post-World War II Italy at many levels, the intellectual and cultural construction of "Mediterranean Africa" operated throughout the twentieth century until the 1970s. The current, ongoing migration from the Horn of Africa to southern Italy,109 through the Sahara desert, northern Africa (Libya in particular), and the Mediterranean Sea, again raises the issue of this African-Italian transnational link.

Around 1900, the first waves of Italian mass-migration overseas took place. In 1911, 170,000 Italians living in the African continent were censed; on this topic, see: Labanca, Oltremare , 33. In 1898, scientist and anthropologist Cesare Lombroso noted: " [In Calabria] emigration also started with the new Kingdom of Italy, after our soldiers had seen new lands and shed the fear of the unknown. In particular, after the cutting of the Suez isthmus that drew cheap labor from all over. Curiously enough, at first, the strongest migration consisted of wet-nurses to Egypt, because of the high wages offered; so much so that the orphanage in Catanzaro became overly crowded and female migration outnumbered that of males."

After publishing in 1 965 a first, well-received, small book on the occupation of Ethiopia, La guerra di Abissínia 1935-1941 (Milan: Feltrinelli, 1965), former journalist and historian Angelo Del Boca, between 1976 and 1988, published six volumes devoted to various aspects of Italian colonialism in Libya and the Horn of Africa. 4.

As Jonathan Miran outlines, "Missionaries had been extremely active in the Ethiopian region since the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Medieval European perceptions of Ethiopia as an isolated Christian kingdom somewhere between the Orient and Africa aroused the particular interest of the Roman Catholic authorities in Rome. The famous legend of the Kingdom of 'Prester John,' located beyond the limits of the Christian 'civilized' world but peopled by mysterious Christians, epitomizes the imaginative images that inspired early missionary quests in the region." See Jonathan Miran, "Missionaries, Education &amp; the State in the Italian Colony of Eritrea," in Christian Missionaries &amp;the State in the Third World, eds. H. B. Hansen and M. Twaddle (Oxford/ Athens: James Currey and Ohio University Press, 2002), 122. 6. Today, the memory loss of the transnational links that were constructed in the nineteenth and twentieth century by missionaries, anthropologists, writers, and scholars, who stressed the continuities between the Mediterranean and Northeastern African peoples and sites, seems to me all the more striking. In fact, the current ongoing migration from the Horn of Africa to southern Italy, through the Sahara desert and northern Africa (Libya in particular), again raises, in dramatic terms, the issue of the African- Italian transnational link. For instance, in the year 2004, 1 3,635 people arrived alive by boat onto Italian shores, in Sicily in particular. Abandoned corpses are frequently found in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, before the 201 1 Libyan war, many Africans were kept in Libyan camps and prisons to prevent their trans-Mediterranean migration.

I forged the concept of Panmeridione ("Pan-South") and the notions related to it ( Pameridionalismo , or "Panmeridionalism," and panmeridionale, or "panmeridional") in order to be able to critically explore Pasolini's approach to Africa and the South. These concepts are primarily heuristic tools that allow us to grasp the complexity of Pasolini's political and aesthetic elaborations of peasantry, subalternity, and the "popular body." For an explanation of these concepts, please see my book Pasolini e l'Africa, V Africa di Pasolini Panmeridionalismo e rappresentazioni dell'Africa postcoloniale, pref. H.

The first thematic issue of California Italian Studies, devoted in 2010 to "Italy in the Mediterranean" and edited by Claudio Fogu and Lucia Re, addresses the scholarly and critical discourse around the Mediterranean and Mediterraneanness that has emerged internationally over the past two decades. This thematic issue provides some additional cues for a further, comparative and interdisciplinary analysis on Mediterranean, transnational, trans-Mediterranean, and, implicitly, "panmeridional" topics. 9.

Jonathan Miran notes that "Chronologically we can distinguish roughly three phases: a period characterized by the politics of conquest, the response to the Mahdist threat, and Governor Martini's 'Muslim policies' (1885-ca. 1910); the phase following the conquest of Libya and the elaboration of Italy's attitudes towards Islam (1910s-20s); and the period of overt pro- Muslim policies under the fascists and the more pronounced articulation of Italy as a 'Muslim power' (1920s-1941)." See Jonathan Miran, Red Sea Citizens: Cosmopolitan Society and Cultural Change in Massawa (Bloomington/ Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2009), 182. 30. The point 8 of the Manifesto della razza (the fascist racist manifesto, first published on 14 July 1938 as "Il Fascismo e il problema della razza" in the newspaper Giornale d'Italia) explicitly stated that: "it is necessary TO MAKE A CLEAN DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MEDITERRANEANS OF (WESTERN) EUROPE ON ONE SIDE AND THE ORIENTALS AND THE AFRICANS ON the other. Therefore, the theories that support the African origin of some European peoples - and include in a common Mediterranean race also the Semitic and Hamitic populations - must be considered dangerous, because they establish inadmissible affinities and ideological sympathies." 31. Alessandro Bausi notes, "Highlighting the essentially 'Mediterranean' character of some aspects of Ethiopian culture, as it emerges from the study of writing techniques, can raise some concern. Between October 1935 and May 1936, meaning the very crucial period when Italy invaded Ethiopia from North and South through an aggressive war held up by the regime as the quintessential 'fascist war,' famous classical studies scholars - such as, among others, Giorgio Pasquali and Goffredo Coppola - timely wrote on this topic."

The second phase, conceptualized as the period of rational imperialism extended from 1 908 until 1 932, where native policy was predominantly</page><page sequence="28">300 ■ Giovanna Trento paternalist. The third phase, which lasted until the demise of colonialism, was marked by the assertion of an indisputable dominance over the colonized."

On this and related topics, see Ben-Ghiat, Fascist Modernities. 58. The literary and cultural debate around notions of "hyper-rural" ( Strapaese ) and "hyper-urban" ( Stracittà ) took place, in particular, in some reviews founded in the mid 1 920s. The Strapaese supporters gathered around "Il Selvaggio" and "L'Italiano," while "900" - and particularly Massimo Bontempelli - articulated a Stracittà perspective. 59.

Hay, Popular Film Culture in Fascist Italy , 1 98. 67. Since in the 1930s the representation of relationships between black-Africans and white-Italians had been discouraged by Fascism, Giovanni's Spanish lover in Camerini's film is, in 1936, an acceptable version of one of the essential elements of the Italian colonial imagery, the "black Venus." In JZ grande appello the "different" and "foreign" woman is finally "righteously" rejected by the Italian protagonist of the film. 68. As Giorgio Bertellini pointed out, Il grande appello may simply appear as another story of moral conversion, redemption, and national reconciliation; however, the most original aspect of the film lies in its linguistic fabric and blend of standard Italian, national dialects and other languages and idioms, Amharic included.

However,</page><page sequence="30">302 ■ Giovanna Trento Flaiano's novel would reach its definitive revised version only in 1968. The latter is the one republished in 2000, to which I refer here: Ennio Flaiano, Tempo di uccidere, pref. A. Longoni (Milan: Rizzoli, 2000); the English translation isA Time to KiĶ pref. and trans.

Appunti per una canzonetta is the title of the diary kept by Flaiano in Africa between November 1935 and May 1936, reprinted in Ennio Flaiano, Tempo di uccidere. 78. Even if we choose to use the word "postcolonial" in the terms in which it was used in the early 1970s - when "postcolonial" was merely a periodizing term and a historical notion, but not yet an ideological concept - Flaiano's A Time to Kill appears only as partly "postcolonial," because, although in 1 947 Italy had just lost its colonies, the majority of European powers still had colonies overseas. Moreover, Flaiano's novel doesn't really match the most influential definitions of postcolonial criticism that were formulated at the end of the twentieth century, such as Homi K. Bhabha, The Location of Culture (London/New York: Routledge, 1994), 171-173), and Antony D. King's "Writing Colonial Space," Comparative Study of Society and History 37 (1995): 543-544. It does not suggest a critique of Eurocentrism, nor does it show, obviously, any connection with poststructuralism. However Neil Lazarus asserts that "In opposition to King, we could argue that 'postcolonial criticism' could not possibly have existed before the 1980s, not because it would have lacked an adequate audience then, but because it would have made no sense at all in the historic-ideological context of the 1970s." See Neil Lazarus, "Introducing postcolonial studies," in Postcolonial Literary Studies , ed. N. Lazarus, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 7. 79. Flaiano opens his novel with a famous quotation taken from the book of Ecclesiastes: "A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to . . ." 80.

Ethnographer and anthropologist Ernesto De Martino (1908-1965) played a relevant, intellectual role in post-World War II Italy. De Martino's important works on Italian southern folklore - that are close to both philosophy and psychiatry - were affected by the publication of Gramsci 's essays. See Ernesto De Martino, Mondo magico (Turin: Einaudi, 1948);</page><page sequence="31">From Maririetti to Pasolini m 303 Ernesto De Martino, Morte e pianto rituale. Dal lamento pagano al pianto di Maria (Turin: Einaudi, 1958); and Ernesto De Martino, Sud e magia (Milan: Feltrinelli, 1959). Pasolini's "African regard" and his construction of the "Pan-South" were also influenced by De Martino; on Pasolini's readings and misreading of De Martino's theories, see Armando Maggi, The Resurrection of the Body: Pier Paolo Pasolini from Saint Paul to Sade (Chicago/London: University of Chicago Press, 2009), 6-9. In the meantime, Claudio Fogu notes, "It was in the field of anthropology that in the 1960s and 1970s a truly 'modern' Mediterranean area studies began to emerge"; however, as Fogu points out, "The reasons for the rise and fall of Mediterranean anthropology are diverse and quite important, but what needs highlighting here is the relative absence of interest in the study of Italian peasant communities and the marginalization of Italian scholars in the field. Suffice it to mention that the seminal writings of Ernesto De Martino on Southern Italian rituals were not translated into English until 2005, and thus took no part in a conversation that appears to have been monopolized by scholars influenced by the British school of social anthropology well into the 1990s."

La grazia degli Eritrei is most likely linked to Pasolini's location hunting in the Horn of Africa to set up his unfinished in-progress project Appunti per un poema sul Terzo Mondo (1968, Notes for a Poem on the Third World). Moreover, between 1968 and 1973 Pasolini kept traveling in East Africa and in the Horn in order to realize his films Appunti per un'Orestiade africana (1970) and Arabian Nights. Both texts Le mie út Mille e una notte" and Post- scriptum a "La grazia degii Eritrei" were, indeed, connected to Pasolini's journeys to the Horn of Africa to film Arabian Nights.

I lineamenti semiti o arabi, hanno la perfezione degli animali, e non c'è occhio che non brilli di una luce stupenda e senza profondità, di una grazia misteriosamente senza mistero. [ . . . ] Si tratta di popolazioni contadine. Ma nei loro villaggi, da secoli, non esiste proprietà. La proprietà della terra è collettiva, e c'è una rotazione del possesso dei campi tra le famiglie. Ciò significa che da secoli gli Eritrei sono disabituati al possesso. Questo dà forse loro l'aggraziato distacco dalle cose, il senso di parità naturale (non servile né orgogliosa) con tutti."

At the end of the nineteenth century, Italians relied on the Habab people to play an important tactical role and aid Italian imperialism in the region; on this topic see Nicola Labanca, In marcia verso Adua (Turin: Einaudi, 1993), 300-304.

As I was reminded by Alessandro Bausi in 2011, during Italian colonialism (the period when Pasolini attended school and, partly, university), case studies on local customs, rules, and land tenure in Italian territories in Africa circulated widely in Italian society at different levels. For example, various school and university textbooks would include a chapter on Italian colonies (for instance law textbooks, as "colonial law," diritto coloniale).</page><page sequence="33">From Marinetti to Pasolini ■ 305 91.

Pasolini's notion of "reality" is very close to that of sacredness and has little to do with "realism." René de Ceccatty, Sur Pier Paolo Pasolini (Monaco: Editions du Rocher, 2005), 56, 112. For Pasolini, "reality" is a sort of "primordial authenticity" that finds full application in popular bodies and sexuality. 98. The notion of "popular body" ( corpo popolare ) - with its blend of "reality," "grace," sacredness, sexiness, resistance to the establishment, and mocking impudence - is fundamental in Pasolini's political and aesthetic approach to subalternity and the "Pan-South." I introduced this complex matter at the conference Pasolini's Body: New Directions in Pasolini Scholarship , held in 2011 at the University of California Santa Cruz, where I presented the paper: "II corpo popolare according to Pier Paolo Pasolini: body, sexuality, subalternity, reality, resistance, agency, and death."

Pier Paolo Pasolini, La grazia degli Eritrei, 52. 107. As Cinzia Sartini-Blum noted: "One step to avoid falling back into the essentializing, assimilative rut of exoticist discourse might be to recognize the genealogical link between the protagonists of exoticism and postmodernism.
