<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious Typologies and Popular Religion in Restoration England C. JOHN SOMMERVILLE There have been numerous studies of the religious leaders of early modern Europe, but accounts of the religious attitudes and interests of the general public have been highly impressionistic. It might seem a hopeless task to try to re- construct a profile of the religious mind of such a remote period, and yet his- torians are not deterred from making broad characterizations, and other disciplines sometimes build on them. The question is not so much whether we must give up such descriptions entirely, but how rigorous we can be in making them. For instance, what can one say of the popular religious mentality of Restora- tion England-the time when the various processes of secularization began in the country. It was in the late seventeenth century that social and cultural life began to grow away from mnanifestly religious assumptions, and it became possible to discuss politics, economics, and philosophy without reference to Christian doc- trine. To what extent was society at large receptive to these trends? What was the character of popular piety? How could the populace have been swept up in the religious revivals of the next century? Two things make a rigorous study of this period (1660-1710) possible. First, there was a regulation in the publishing industry that limited an edition to 3,000 copies. The type then had to be redistributed and set up again for a new edition -a laborer's "feather-bedding" rule. We may conclude from this that the works with the greatest number of editions were roughly the most popular works. There are sometimes questions as to what constituted a new edition, and whether a cer- tain edition was merely a reissue of older sheets. But the inflation of edition num- bers for promotional purposes should not have been as necessary for genuine best-sellers as for others. And it does not appear that free distribution of re- ligious books and pamphlets or the founding of the first lending libraries need affect our calculations on the distribution of this literature.' Even the existence of censorship until half-way through this period (1695) need not affect the in- ference that religious best-sellers represented the popular mentality. Freethought and immodesty regularly passed the censors in the form of translations of clas- sical literature, and yet they were no competition for religious works. Secondly, seventeenth-century best-sellers had a distribution comparable to that of twentieth-century best-sellers. The most popular of them-The Whole Duty of Man, The Christian Monitor-apparently sold sufficient copies that every tenth family in the kingdom could have owned one. Today in the United States that would require 5,500,000 copies, and only a handful of cookbooks, atlases, dic- A version of this paper was read in the Religion and Social Sciences section at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in Oct,ber 1974. 1.

Ken- nedy's Profiles in Courage.2 This discovery tends to confirm Lawrence Stone's surprisingly high figures for literacy in early modern England, which indicate that a third to a half of adult males could read,3 It also justifies the inference that these best-sellers do represent a popular religious mind. For works were not popular only by default; there were nearly a thousand religious works popular enough to require at least one reprinting in this period of 1660-1710. Best-sellers may give a better picture of the public's interest than questionnaires, were they possible, for they avoid some of the problems of sampling and of the obtrusive- ness of the measuring device. With these assurances, I identified the forty-two most popular religious works of the period 1660-1711, which were, incidentally, the most popular works of any kind.4 These works were subjected to a content analysis, coding paragraphs by a very long list of su;bject-matter categories to show the proportions of space given over to various doctrinal concerns, philosophical commitments, and social interests. Rather than impose functionalist categories drawn from psychology or sociology, it seemed best to leave the categories in the form which they would take in the literature. This made it possible to get at more latent attitudes by combining and recombining the categories into religious or psychological typologies 2.

Some books popular earlier had already fallen out of favor, so only editions falling within our period were counted. To balance the advantage of thos3 books which had the longest period of sale, some books written and popular toward the end of the century were included even though they passed through fewer editions than some of those excluded. Given the length of sale, however, the former showed a more lively demand.</page><page sequence="3">34 CHURCH HISTORY of a fairly rudimentary sort.5 These were familiar polar typologies such as: churchly versus sectarian ecclesiology, traditional versus prophetic authority, a stern or a benign God, anxiety or confidence, a passive or an active tone, and authoritarianism over against liberalism, the last of which had to be broken down into sometimes conflicting authoritarianisms-social, intellectual, and religious.6 Other typologies were simply the major divisions of interest: for example, God, society, and self. The overlap involved in the construction of these nominal typo- logies will help explain some of the highest of the correlations between them, re- ported in the accompanying table. So the present study concentrates on the anom- alies which appeared in the correlations. Usually there were recognizable differences over these matters between groups of the books, either between those by Dissenters and those by Anglicans, or be- tween those popular earlier and those popular later in our period. It is the more surprising to find statistically significant differences between Dissenting and An- glican works in light of the fact that the books chosen were not extreme or even typical examples from these parties, but only such works as appealed to the widest audience. This would qualify the denials that there were consistent differences be- tween the Puritan tradition and a more normative English Protestantism.7 The most popular categories related to God's expectations of man, the health of the soul, the means of grace, and the afterlife. This is only to say that this was a literature of religious direction, and neither devotional, inspirational, nor theological in the strictest sense. These interests were especially characteristic of those books which maintained their popularity through the whole of the period. In general, the books neglected social or ecclesiastical subjects as well as questions of history or of the abstract nature of God or of man. And they did not directly face the problems of the basis of religious motivation or of religious knowledge. It appears that the intellectual basis of belief was shifting faster than any specific doctrine. Books popular in the later part of the period were less likely to appeal to history, nature, or reason (or tradition for that matter) to back up their statements. These sources of intellectual authority were becoming equivocal; they 5. Operational definitions of the hundred-odd categories appear in tlhe appendix to the dis- sertation; see note 1. Reliability checks by a ncn-experienced coder showed agreement of 75%, 76%, 89%, and 83% on four books chcsen at random. Checks by my own recod- ing after several months were nearly the same: 85%, 74%, 78.5%, and 84.5%. The most general categories proved least reliable, and these were the categories that were most eas- ily combined into the typologies. Reliability for these typologies seldom fell below 90%, indicating that the variation in coding was due to some overlapping in the categories more than to judgments as to which were the primary themes of a paragraph. 6. Other typologies were supernaturalism/naturalism, Old/Newr Testament emphasis, conver- sionism/moralism, sacramental/ethical emphasis. For ccnstruction of the typologies, see my dissertation, "Popular Religious Literature," pp. 373-390. 7. By F-ratio and t-tests it was determined that Dissenting and Anglican best-sellers differed significantly over the subjects of (giving the Dissenters' emphasis, in each case) social liberalism, sectarianism, and prophetic religiosity (at the .01 level) and over religious authoritarianism, anxiety, and conversi nism (at the .05 level). There were sigJnificant differences between books popular earlier and later in the period over Old Testament orientation (.01), anxiety, a stern inage of God, and an ethical (as opposed to sacramen- tal) piety (.05). The poles named here characterize the earlier group. There were som?- times significant differences between a grcup of perennial best-sellers and thle other groups, the former showing the greatest attention to God, to the benign image of Gor!, and the most passivity. saeramentalism, and general auhoritarianism. Several of the tv- pologies did not show up significant differences cither according to time or party. These were passivity, supernaturalism, intellectual authoritarianism, alnd the mlajor distributions of emphasis-to God, self. or society. That is to say, either there were no differences between the books or the differences within groups were too random for the groups to be significantly at variance.</page><page sequence="4">RELIGIOUS TYPOLOGIES no longer obviously supported Christian doctrine. Books popular in the later part of our period tended to direct their appeals toward scripture alone. And beyond that, later authors began to show greater discrimination in the sections of scrip- ture they invoked. Citations from the Old Testament fell very markedly. An Old versus New Testament emphasis was the one typology for which the greatest dif- ference between books showed up over time. There was no difference between the Puritan (or Dissenting) and the Anglican works in this respect. Puritans have often been called Old Testament-oriented. Yet even if they had been, an inclination toward the Old Testament was not indicative of anything much beyond itself. It correlated significantly with only one other typology-a relative naturalism-while a New Testament orientation correlated with a relative supernaturalism, perhaps indicative of a growing "spiritualization" of religion. Contrary to expectations, this Old Testament emphasis actually correlated with the more benign image of God, though not significantly. The shift toward New Testament citations probably represents a growing em- barrassment over certain parts of scripture. Intellectual authoritarianism also de- clined somewhat, and there was no Dissenter-Anglican difference here either. So even within this popular literature there was some awareness that the cultural con- sensus was shifting, that Christian belief was becoming isolated from the national life. This change may well have been caused by printing--not only secular pub- lishing but religious publishing as well. Printing allowed the clerical elite to ad- dress the laity, but it also allowed the laity to let the clergy know what they ap- proved-by what books they purchased. Of course this affected publishers, and it would affect authors in time, especially at a time like the 'Restoration, when there was a general crisis in philosophy. In transitional periods confidence in the intellectual establishment is shaken, and in the Restoration we do see polite so- ciety beginning to replace the clergy as arbiters of intellectual debate. Whatever could not be simplified so that the lay elite could understand it had not passed the test of "reason" and "nature" and came to be labeled "traditional." Thus, part of the intellectual change and simplification of that time was a change in social composition of the jury that sat in judgment on philosophical questions. Age-old aristocratic prejudices and classical scepticism may well have been more important than the rise of science in the decline of religious belief. In reference to God and the supernatural realm, the books already showed a very attenuated sense of the numinous. The Devil was hardly more personalized than Mammon, and was ordinarily synonymous with temptation. One writer al- luded to his collection of case histories of demon possession, as one might refer to a collection of ontological specimens, to prove the reality of the spirit world.8 The need for that kind of proof does not argue a very secure belief. Still, unbelief was not perceived as so great a threat as superstition-which always meant Roman Catholicism. There-was a bare handful of references to witchcraft and to supernatural por- tents in this popular literature. But God loomed so large as to reduce all other forces to insignificance. Even the figure of Christ was so awe-inspiring that the dimensions of the subject could not be made out. In particular, there was almost no historical appreciation of the figure of Jesus. Similarly, while there was a considerable sense of God's providences, there 8. Richard Baxter, The Practical Works of Richard Baxter, 4 vols. (London, 1854), 2:506. 35</page><page sequence="5">CHURCH HISTORY was little awareness of historical change. After all, even the great parliamentary struggle had brought only illusory changes. Writers did not use providences to prove anything, perhaps feeling that they could only be recognized by the eye of faith. So the period represents a kind of dead spot between the Reformation hope for a world-shaking spiritual renewal and the Enlightenment expectations of an earthly and human progress.9 As for the tone in treating God, there was considerable range even within single books. Dissenters showed more fear of God than Anglicans. But they also showed more affective mysticism. The greater emotion of the Dissenters' works came out both in this greater religious dread and in a greater love for God, in contrast to the cooler respect that was characteristic of Anglicans. All this may have something to do with the social isolation of Dissenters. In terms of Durk- heim's notion of the interchangeability of religious and social symbols, Dissenters apparently looked to God for the approval and support that society provided for Anglicans. Books which emphasized the sterner side of God were not those which were most authoritarian. And the sterner image of God did not have the expected correlation with conversion, which would have suggested an Oedipal interpreta- tion. Rather, a concentration cn the harshness of God was related to a neglect of the whole subject of God and to a concentration on society instead. In fact, a relative emphasis on social categories (as opposed to an emphasis on the self or God) showed the largest number of significant correlations with our other typo- logies, making it the best indicator of other attitudes. Emphasis on society therefore seemed to be the closest thing to an inde- pendent variable within Restoration piety. Very tentatively, we might consider this better evidence for Durkheim's analysis of the social determinants of the re- ligious consciousness than for Freud's specific emphasis on the importance of the father. It was a time when a very large percentage of English children, possibly a majority, were separated from their natural fathers-as orphans, bastards, ap- prentices, boarding scholars, or servants-and must have had a rather diffuse image of the father. It did not occur to writers to use the term "father" for God, as their usual designation, and there was scarcely any difference between the respect shown the principal of the Trinity and that shown toward the Son. An emphasis on God was most tightly correlated with a benign image of God, with confidence, sacramentalism, and a passive tone. This devotional and de- pendent piety was especially characteristic of the books that maintained their popularity through our whole period. Emphasis on society had the reverse of these correlations, being significantly related to anxiety, social authority, an active tone, and a relative neglect of God. And this syndrome was characteristic of the books which fell in popularity during our period-in other words, those popular in the earlier years of the period. It is as though an emphasis on society and an emphasis on God were in competition within the religious mentality. Books which emphasized categories relating to the self or man had a higher correlation than those concentrating on God or on society as regards conversion- ism, supernaturalism, and prophetic and sectarian attitudes. These were the em- 9. David McClelland's The Achieving Society (Princeton: Van Nostrand, 1961), pp. 132-149, indicates that this period gave less evidence of achievement crientation than any other period between 1400 and 1830, suggesting a general crisis of confidence within English society. 36</page><page sequence="6">RELIGIOUS TYPOLOGIES phases of Dissenting authors, emphasizing the association of individualism with that tradition. Since the image of a personal God is necessarily anthropomorphic, one would expect that a change in the understanding of man would bring change in the idea of God as well. A very portentous change was in the offing, which would blossom into the sentimentalism and romanticism of the eighteenth century. But two views of man ran through our period without either one coming to predominate in this religious literature. One we may call the Reformed or "Calvinist" view, and the other might be termed semi-Pelagian.10 The latter was characteristic of certain of the Anglican writers, especially Jeremy Taylor and Richard Allestree. These two views differed in their understanding of sin-emphasizing rebellion of the will and concupiscence of the flesh, respectively. And their differences over man's justification implied all the difference between a religion of redemption and a religion of moral effort. The moralistic Anglicans turned out to be the most con- cerned with sins of the flesh, with ascetic practices as a means of appeasing God, and oddly enough, with the "Puritan ethic" of work as a religious duty. It may be that Puritans could assume all these things; their asceticism had proceeded to the problem of control of the mind and of avoiding sin, rather than with the matter of acting revenge upon themselves, as the Anglicans put it. The Anglicans' at- tention to diligence in one's calling is perhaps more easily explained than the same theme among predestinarian Puritans. For the moralistic Anglicans it was a part of earning one's salvation. Certainly success in business was no sign of God's favor for our Dissenters; Baxter scoffed at such an idea in his most popular work. And another stated as a commonplace that riches and grace were usually found in inverse proportions." Anglican moralism would naturally have been a help toward social control. But judging from the popularity of their most moralistic authors, readers must have welcomed it. Perhaps the Restoration was escaping from the strains of a conversionist piety into legalism as well as into libertinism. And yet the con- versionist tradition also continued in popular favor. This raises a question of real consequence for recent historiography. His- torians have argued over whether legalism or a predestinarian piety caused more damaging anxieties. But perhaps the period was not motivated primarily by the desire to reduce anxiety. It is as though readers were trying to maintain a certain level of tension in their lives, if only to combat boredom. Perhaps too much has been made of religious anxiety as the mainspring of the modern consciousness. The most popular of the Dissenters' works did discuss the problem of assurance of salvation, but in the end they did not settle on any definite criteria of judg- ment, leaving readers to search their own hearts. Of our popular authors, only Bunyan addressed himself to the problem of despair; the other writers thought that the real threat in that secularizing age was presumption rather than anxiety. There was another surprise in that a conversionist piety did not show signi- ficant correlations with anxiety, as one would expect from discussions of the "twice-born" experience. Conversionism correlated with social categories more than with psychological ones-that is, with antagonism toward traditionalism and a churchly ecclesiology and social authority. The social function of conversion was clearly to enable men to break free of a corrupting world and even from a 10. See C. F. Allison, The Rise of Moralism (London: S.P.C.K., 1966). 11.

Dissenting lterature did show significantly more anxiety than Anglican works. This is the first systematic collection of evidence for this fact, which has long been taken for granted. But anxiety-versus-confidence was also the only one of our typologies to show a significant difference over time as well as between parties. Anxieties declined markedly through the period, just as Dissenting works fell in popularity. It is therefore impossible to say whether our evidence indicates that the anxieties were due to changing social circumstances, as Michael Walzer argues in The Revolution of the Saints, or due more largely to the theological factors which Max Weber discussed.l2 Like conversionism, anxiety correlated more closely with social interests than with more personal ones. The semi-Pelagianism which Taylor brought over from Catholic sources (speci- fically St. Francis de Sales)l3 lacked the latter's entire trust in the sacraments, and was more simply a moralistic piety. Anglicans like Taylor tended to sum up the religious life in the terms of duties-to God, to the state, to social superiors and parents, and to inferiors. Indeed this was the point of the most popular Anglican work, The Whole Duty of Man. Dissenters would only have accepted with qualifications that verse from Ecclesiastes: "Fear God, and keep his com- mandments: for this is the whole duty of man." It did not fit with their more evangelical doctrine of grace. Semi-Pelagian piety did not come to predominate even within popular An- glican religious literature. Rather, it helped to launch the moralistic novel, with its cult of sexual purity and the economic virtues. Many of the early novels were, of course, written by clergymen or devout laymen who sensed that the older works of "religious direction" were not reaching an audience for which religion, providence, and morality itself were in question. Robinson Crusoe and Pamela probably did more to promote nineteenth-century Victorian mo- rality than did any specifically religious works. And the semi-Pelagian strain in that literature helps to distinguish Victorian from Puritan morality. There may be something in the fact that, just as the rise of the novel is associated with the increase of women in the reading public, so Taylor and Allestree and Henry Hammond began this semi-Pelagian tradition under female patronage.14 Meanwhile, there was no general movement toward a prudish ethic within the specifically religious best-sellers. And they were not becoming more prudential in their morality; the blatant instrumentalism of modern inspirational literature was noticeably absent.15 Compared with these suggestive differences over the nature of man, the old controversies over church order appear to have been exhausted. It is true that the typologies concerned with this area-church versus sect and traditional versus prophetic authority-showed up the most significant differences between the par- ties in a statistical sense. But of course the parties were defined by their differ- 12. The largest difference over anxiety was between the Anglican group and the early best- sellers, which does not suggest any obvious interpretation. 13. Stanley Morison, English Prayer Books, 3d. ed.

And the tensions which a reader feels between these authors did not concern these past quarrels. It was here that a certain inadequacy of method began to appear. The area in which authors were groping for novel ex- pression and rhetorical advantage was the subject of man's nature and God's ex- pectations of the individual. Dissenters were of course much less interested in so- ciety, much more individualistic in their emphases, than Anglicans. But even Anglicans were beginning to feel isolated within English society, and wary of so- ciety's standards. They did not dare to make an issue of the church's authority, for instance, but tried instead to win men over by the reasonableness of its doc- trine and the beauties of its liturgy. The question of authoritarianism and liberalism proved complex. On a mea- sure which emphasized humility and awe as opposed to a melioristic view of life and a more comfortable relationship with God, Anglicans were significantly more religiously liberal than Dissenters, while the latter were significantly more so- cially liberal than Anglicans. There was no difference between the two parties over an intellectual authoritarianism, even though this typology was significant- ly related to the social authoritarianism more characteristic of Anglicans. So- cial and religious authoritarianisms correlated negatively at the .005 level, re- flecting the very different bases of established church and the reforming movement. Still, it is meaningful to speak of a general authoritarianism, since when the typo- logies were taken together all of the books fell heavily on the authoritarian side except for a sometimes fawning work addressed to the upper classes: Allestree's The Gentleman's Calling. The most authoritarian works positively neglected the emphasis on God; besides anxiety, this was the only typology with which a gen- eral authoritarianism showed a significant (negative) correlation. Beyond these, only the correlation with social interest approached significance, again indicating the religious importance of social sensitivity. The overall impression of the literature is one of shrinking interests and con- fidence-a decline of social interest, of historical interests, a shrinking of the in- tellectual and motivational bases. Popular religious books became less colorful and their emotional level fell, as Anglican works replaced Dissenting ones in popularity. There was gain as well as loss in this. Anxiety was falling as a more passive tone was coming to predominate. In the nineteenth century many would have con- sidered this a purification of religion from social concerns, a spiritualization of life. The coming revivals were in this pietistic mode. For the heroic age in religion had ended, and Englishmen 'were learning the new lessons of spiritual inwardness.
