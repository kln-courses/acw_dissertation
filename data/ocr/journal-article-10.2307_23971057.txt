These are the material-cultural study of peasantry in relation to the running of secondary states, archaeology and iconography of the late monarchic period, and the sociology of official and popular religion. Social studies of Judah under Assyrian domination show how the mechanism of labour coercion was refined under Hezekiah and Manasseh. This brought the peasantry into a position of loss of political and material freedom, but willingly so. Such willing submission may be ascribed to the religious legitimation of power structures in the pervading world view and the position of the king within it. This is no wonder, since sociologists of religion have recognized that there is a reciprocity between popular and official religion, rather than a polarity. Essential to this world view is the goddess, who is closely allied to the king in both inscriptional and iconographic portrayals from Iron IIC. Likewise, in the peasant's domain the role of the goddess is also represented by material remains. In a chant-like penitence liturgy employed as an ironic jibe in Jer. 3:24a divine figure. Ha Boshet, is blamed for 'consuming' a list of material things dear to peasants: their fathers' toil, flocks and herds, sons and daughters. If Boshet is a divine title, as some have argued, then its occurrence in this Hebrew chant could be viewed as a denunciation in the same breath of the goddess and the royal administration. I wish to thank the students who since 2004 have endured my classes in Israelite Religion and Advanced Exegesis where we wrestled with these problems. I also wish to thank my assistants Carolyn Finamor, who practised 'reading with' First Nations groups on Vancouver Island as part of this project, and Kenneth Brown, who proofread a final draft. I acknowledge gratefully an internal grant from Trinity Western University funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada to aid research in Religion as Social Capital. A special note of appreciation must also go to Gerald West and the School of Theology in the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, who invited me to present this research as a departmental seminar, as well as to Holly Nelson, Dorothy Peters, and my colleagues in the Religious Studies Department at TWU for valuable comments.

It also stands out for a list it contains of material things dear to subsistence communities: property,3 flocks and herds, sons and daughters. Not only that, but someone or something (Ha-Boshet) is said to have 'consumed' these things. I shall argue that this rhythmical refrain had a life of its own and fits well as a song of peasant resentment during the seventh century, and was taken up by the framer of this Jeremianic passage (hereafter Jeremiah) to serve an ironic purpose. As set out below according to the Masoretic accents, the refrain is very uneven in its colometry.4 The only discernible structure is found in the positioning of key concepts such as unfaithful behaviour and by the double occurrence of the root ש1ב in 3:22 and 4:1. Moreover, 1אלהינ ΠΊΓΡ occurs four times, arranged symmetrically around the complaint of loss (אכלה) and who is to blame—הבשת and 1בשתנ (IV-V). Clearly, loss and blame are being highlighted. In featuring this complaint, the writer may have intended the punning of ש1ב of the surrounding context and בוש found in the double occurrence of the lexeme בשת in IV and V. But it is this word בשת that deserves careful attention. It first appears as the articulated titular form 'The Shame' and is followed by the adoption of 'shame' by the penitents. It makes little sense to emend הבשת אכלה to הבעל אכל as suggested by Rudolph in the BHS apparatus, since the pun would be lost. 1 For a detailed discussion of this section, with extensive literature, see Μ. E. Biddle, A Redaction History of Jeremiah 2:1—4:2 (Zurich: Theologischer Verlag, 1990). In his view the consensus is that Jer. 2—3 'exhibits some conscious structure' (p. 31). 2 Cf. R. Mosis, 'Umkehr und Vergebung — eine Auslegung von Jer 3,21-4,2', TTZTTZ 98 (1989), pp. 39—60, who calls it 'Bussritus' (p. 46), 'Bussliturgie' (p. 47); also J. T. Willis, 'Dialogue between Prophet and Audience as a Rhetorical Device in the Book of Jeremiah', JSOT 33 (1985), pp. 63-82, who regards it as a repentance liturgy sung in the Jerusalem cult (p. 66). 3 Literally 'fathers' toil.' HALOT glosses יגיע as product of labour, acquisition,acquisition, citing Deut. 28:33, property, citing Neh. 5:13. 4 Ziegler's text in the Gottingen LXX contains the entire v. 24 as it stands and the Greek manuscript omissions do not overlap with the phrase suggested by Rudolph in BHS to be a gloss. For an approach in which glosses are excised and the order of strophes is rearranged, see D. Jobling, 'Jeremiah's Poem in III 1-IV 2', VT 28/1 (1978), pp. 45-55.</page><page sequence="3">480 DIRK BlICHNER Unfaithful behaviour: כי העוו את־דרכם שכחו את־יהוה אלהיהם Return: שובו בנים שבבים ארפה משובתיבם 1: 1: הננו אתנו לך כי אתה יהוד. אלהינו 11: אכן לשקר מגבעות המון הרים 111: אכן ביהוה אלהינו תשועת ישראל 1V: והכשת אכלה את־יגיע אבותינו מנעורינו את־צאנם ואת־בקרם את־בניהם ואת־בנותיהם ν: נשכבה בבשתנו ותכסנו כלמתנו V1: כי ליהוד. אלהינו חטאנו אנחנו ואבותינו מנעורינו ועד־היום הוה νιι: ולא שמענו בקול יהוה אלהינו Return: אס־תשוב ישראל נאכדיהוה אלי תשוב Unfaithful behaviour: ואס־תסיר שקוציך מפני ולא־תנוד A suggested function for this penitence liturgy in the context of the harlotry cycle has to do with the fact that it is found at the end of a lawsuit, publicly staged to draw on the energies and backing of an audience. Shaming speech is liberally employed; the purpose, when used with a positive intent, is not to harass or dominate the accused but to elicit a re-evaluation of actions in an honourable fashion before harsher measures are taken.5 And so a penitence refrain occurs just in the right place, were it not for the two lines that follow it. Instead of bringing the cycle to a close, they serve to heighten the irony by reopening the proceedings. Jeremiah tries to stir his audience by recalling a chant of the Boshet that ate their livelihood, and of their own shame in relation to this loss. There is, however, no real shame, no real penitence, and therefore no return. McKane calls their attitude a ,deliberate cultivation of amnesia, a desire for forgetfulness under a blanket of disgrace'.6 What would have been the Sitz im Leben of such a song? Let us approach it from the two intersecting themes: loss of material goods and the double blame of Ha-Boshet and boshtenu. Three comments may be made at the outset. The first is that the hearers of this oral performance would have recalled another list in which the kings were blamed for taking away these very things. Secondly, this loss is somehow tied up with religion since Ha-Boshet is to blame. It is the only time in the Hebrew Bible that this divine epithet takes an 5 See V. Η. Matthews, 'Honor and Shame in Gender-Related Legal Situations in the Hebrew Bible', in V. H. Matthews, Β. M. Levinson, and T.

Had the speakers regarded YHWH instead as the Salvation of Israel, presumably their experience would have been different. A polarization is thus established between Η a-Boshet/ material Η a-Boshet/material loss and Yahwism/salvation. These topics within Israelite religion—loss (and its cause) and Yahwism vs 'other' religion—are well represented in contempor ary research. To begin with, social-scientific approaches to the Hebrew Bible and especially ethnoarchaeological work on ancient Near Eastern states address the perennial threat of material loss by peasants and who is typically responsible for it.8 Next, the growing list of publications on religion and iconography of Iron IIB and C is providing a better understanding of the cultic activity of all levels of society during the last century of the Judaean monarchy.9 Added to this, recent work on popular vs official This is also observed by G.

A text such as this may subtly reveal, as she says, 'the moral questions inherent in the concentration of power in the hands of a few'.11 I shall argue that particularly from the seventh century onwards, the Judaean monarchy perfected a successful but repressive economic policy, legitimated by the official cult, whose prominent feature was the goddess. She was the symbol that bound royal administration and populace together in a functional but strained relationship. This song reflects something of a slumbering bitterness whose liturgical expression was a form of popular resistance, that Jeremiah now includes in an ironic statement: you would like to be freed from your circumstances (while the opposite is true: you are too happily enmeshed in them). In seeking to create dialogue, as it were, between the biblical text and societal analysis based on mute evidence, it is inevitable that sides will have to be taken in disputed matters, or else one remains in a limbo of over-caution. In the first place, it will not be taken for granted that so great a disjuncture exists between written text and reality in the pre-exilic period that the only way to work with text is analytically.12 I shall assume, despite his use of polemical language and formulaic vocabulary, that Jeremiah's portrayal of pre-exilic Judaean material culture can be taken at Oriental Publications, 57; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000); and K.

A third debate concerns the divine epithet 'boshet' as replacement for 'baal'. The view that 'boshet' was the dysphemistic creation of scribes has merit and is well defended. However, some arguments will be presented in section V below to suggest that 'boshet' may have been a real linguistic element, meaning dignity or protective spirit, that played a rhetorical role in a number of settings alongside the homophonous word 'shame'.14 II I begin with the refrain about consumption of 'our' valued goods. Such a state of affairs mentioned in the text finds corroboration in the material remains and in sociological analyses. The point raised by the text is the loss of material elements dear to the subsistence sector.15 It is probably the closest thing we have of the people's 'crying' over what they have lost as a result of the monarchy (1 Samuel 8). It recalls the Naboth account where loss of land is the result of Jezebel's interference (1 Kings 21) and Isaiah's bitter observation that some are able to accumulate property at the expense of others (Isaiah 5, cf. Mic. 2:2). All these texts reflect 13 Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, p. 10, warn against driving a wedge between text and material culture, with specific reference to W. Dever.

Though sociologists are uncomfortable with the idea of upstreaming from contemporary sociological studies, the gains often outweigh the pitfalls (ibid. p. 16).</page><page sequence="7">484 DIRK ΒϋCHNER social change felt by subsistence peasants when economies are brought to flourish by oligarchies who are able to exert control over others with little or no remuneration. That this happened in Israel and Judah is well attested in the material remains.16 Holladay notes that from earliest times, Israelites had acceptable means at their disposal for achieving such control: managing the labour of impoverished individuals as dependents, obtaining taxes or labour from free citizens and securing rents from large land holdings.17 This is compatible with Frick's sociological character ization of an early state, which includes the maintenance of surplus, the formalizing of social stratification, and the existence of a common ideology on which the legitimacy of the rulers is based.18 Ordinarily, subsistence peasants do not produce a surplus available for use outside the peasant group. Only once an economic elite arises within a population does one find surplus production by coercion and the subsequent management of that surplus.19 It is remarkable to see how these three strategies of establishing social stratification, managing commodities, and producing surplus in the form of cash crops were fine tuned during the seventh century, which may be regarded as a fitting backdrop for our passage. Hezekiah's time is pivotal because not only did he achieve crown supervision of commodities known to us from the ImlkImlk and winged solar-disk impressions on vessels, but also because, as Halpern puts it, he and Sennacherib between them emptied the countryside and destroyed ancestral ties to the land.20 By centralizing the cult Hezekiah ensured that tax farming via 16 On the appearance of fortifications and grain storage see Coote and Whitelam, 'Emergence of Israel', p. 368 and Holladay, 'Kingdoms of Israel and Judah'. Note, however, the criticism of his method by Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, p. 4. 17 Holladay, 'Kingdoms of Israel and Judah', p. 378. 18 F. Frick, 'Social Science Methods', pp. 20-1. 19 In discussing the emergence of the monarchy, Finkelstein notices this factor mentioned in one model after another ('Emergence of the Monarchy', 52). He suggests that the westward movement of the population during the Iron Age requires the kind of agricultural organization whereby surplus produced by horticulturalists can be traded for grain. This created a group not involved in subsistence production that contributed to the stratification of society (p. 60). 20 B. Halpern, 'Jerusalem and the Lineages in the Seventh Century BCE: Kinship and the Rise of Individual Moral Liability', in B. Halpern and D. W. Hobson (eds.), Law and Ideology in Monarchic Israel (JSOTS 124; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1991), pp. 11-107, esP■ 27 and 48. Lowery cites extensive literature in dealing with the relationship between patrimony which became no more than legal fiction, and the more dominant economic system of the monarchy that arose out of that system (Reforming Kings, pp. 39—61).</page><page sequence="8">BOSHETBOSHET IN JEREMIAH 3:24 485 rural shrines made way for bureaucratic taxation, that is to say, through nothing less than religious sanction.21 To Manasseh remained the task of restoring the financial fortunes of the monarchy while acceding to Assyrian demands. This meant thinly repopulating the countryside only by such manpower as could be spared from Jerusalem and which could effectively run the strategic enterprise of producing non-subsistence goods demanded by lucrative markets on his borders. As a consequence, traditional Judaean agriculture was transformed into a cash cropping industrial economy in the wake of Sennacherib's departure, a situation that may have lasted well into Josiah's reign.22 Here brilliant statesmanship and social upheaval were operating side by side. Patrimonial land tenure was in tatters and those farmers able to return to their land would have been faced with paying taxes from what little surplus they had or turning to the more risky business of growing monoculture cash crops. Studies of both ancient and modern peasantry have shown that peasants, for whom risk avoidance and/or risk spreading are more important than profit, invariably prefer growing subsistence crops to inedible cash crops.23 A picture of the winners and losers during the seventh century is offered by Ekron, with its large-scale olive oil production. Since olives cannot be grown there, it is logical to suppose that they were imported to this thriving centre from the Judaean or Samarian highlands, driven by the new agricultural-economic programme. The towns of the Shephelah, however, never recovered.24 By the middle of the seventh century, the Judaean state, a model Assyrian vassal state, exhibited conditions under which social stratification and monarchic control existed in uneasy equilibrium, to the benefit of the state and its foreign overlord but to the detriment of the common populace.

Hezekiah amassed goods under cover of contributions to YHWH's temple. Manasseh, who had an Ashera in the Temple, was no doubt accommodating to the prospering role of the goddess in the astral pantheon of Assyria, and would have made the most of her nourishing aspects to the benefit of his populace (see below). It is little wonder, then, if Halpern and others are correct, that there was a thriving Ashera cult in Ekron at this time.21 It may be useful to read the picture of peasant loss and social change in the seventh century against the ideological legitimation essential to ancient Near Eastern monarchic states.26 The relationship between palace and temple in the Hebrew Bible is that which is assumed everywhere else in the ancient world, and has been well documented.27 While the role of religion was to provide 'world building', the king was the representative of divine order that undergirded the social order. As divine son he was appointed co-regent of the creator deities and as such became the guarantor of the sacred order of creation, the well-being of the state, and even the fertility of the soil.28 David's prayer of thanks in 2 Samuel 7, 25 Halpern, 'Jerusalem', p. 46 with bibliography; but note the caution of Hadley, Cult of Ashera, pp. 179-84, who argues that asherat is to be taken as 'the sanctuary'. 26 One needs to bear in mind that for some theorists ideology is something unconscious rather than voluntaristic, and something that is illusory, i.e. it mystifies all classes, not only those who regulate ideas. Berlinerblau calls ideologies 'not possessions but possessors' ('Ideology, Pierre Bourdieu's Doxa, and the Hebrew Bible', Semeia 87 [1999], pp. 193-216, esp. 198). Rainer Albertz is correct in saying that the ruling classes would simply have seen their riches and prosperity as 'the blessing of Yahweh at work and therefore a complete justification' (A History of Israelite Religion in the Old Testament Period,Period, vol. 1: From the Beginnings to the End of the Monarchy, trans. J. Bowden (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 1994), p. 162. 27 See e.g. M.

Keel, The Symbolism of the Biblical World (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1997), esp. pp. 280—90. Albertz notes that in Deuteronomistic theology all these claims are negated for Israelite kings (History of Israelite Religion, p. 213). Prohibitions are frequently good indicators of actual practice.</page><page sequence="10">BOSHETBOSHET IN JEREMIAH 3:24 487 in which he gushes with delight that YHWH will establish and maintain his בית (five times), reflects just how attractive this sacred political arrangement was to Israelite and Judaean kings. That ancient kings in general were more committed to the ethical mandate built into royal ideology than to maintaining their power has been questioned. Whitelam showed that the king's judicial function in Israel and the ancient Near East is often confused with the ideal presentation of it, and in reality royal actions often amounted to an abuse of authority.29 By and large, the successes and blunders of the Israelite and Judaean monarchy seemed always to be accepted by the population through the religious authority of the national cult in which the Davidic king was revered as co-regent of YHWH.30 Such religious authority would have been more acutely needed in overcoming the kind of financial crisis faced by Manasseh in the aftermath of Sennacherib's campaign. Added to this is the fact that the neo-Assyrian royal system would have offered Manasseh further sacro-judicial innovations to employ. As Zevit puts it, he 'took advantage of all divine succor and prognosticating technologies available to him'.31 This situation of a successful, religiously legitimated economy and an unhappy populace can be further illuminated by two things: the workings of popular religion and the resurgence of the iconography of the goddess at that time, in all levels of society. Ideological coercion of the many by the few can be accounted for by recent theoretical proposals in the sociology of official and popular religion, to which Jacques Berlinerblau has made a significant contribution.32 In his opinion the model of official Κ.

A corollary of this is that the dominant religion is able to gain majority assent through the use of force. This seems to be the uncritical view of Yahwism sometimes held within the Guild of Biblical studies, a view that makes no allowance for a nexus existing among various religious groups in a society.33 It merely assumes that Yahwism as official religion had the means to exert authority and exclude. But, says Berlinerblau, coercion on its own is ineffective and costly, as we are told by Antonio Gramsci.34 An official religion therefore needs to achieve consensus. That is to say, in order to succeed, official religion has to become popular religion and the two must influence one another in overt ways.35 Only then may it achieve what any hegemonic system needs: the ability to dominate by consent.36 It seems as if the situation in late monarchic Judah under Assyrian domination answers well to this proposition of religious and social co-dependency between advocates of the state religion and those who practised domestic modes of worship.37 Manasseh's religious achievements were brilliant. He steered a safe course between placating his Assyrian masters on the one hand and serving the religious needs of his population on the other, by maintaining the YHWH cult as the official cult, but resuscitating within it older expressions of folk religion, which included veneration of the goddess and now also Assyrian astral deities, who were visibly portrayed as part of YHWH's court.38 Albertz describes this as a socio-religious system from which the lower (2000), η.ρ; id., 'Preliminary Remarks for the Sociological Study of Israelite "Official Religion"', in R.

IV Recent studies of Israelite religion have focused on the variegated nature of Yahwism, particularly following epigraphic and artifactual finds which suggest a similar role for the goddess within that religion as found within the cult of El or Adad. The importance of the goddess for both family and state religion is therefore a good vantage point from which to view the social fabric of the late monarchy as it is from which to read Jer. 3:24. As mentioned above, the king, of whom Realpolitik demanded that he maintain his power base and extract revenue from his populace, was at the same time vicar of divine protection and fecundity. To add to this picture, one sees in the iconographical record that the goddess was often the means of mediating these benefits to all under his care.40 Keel and Uehlinger have argued from the evidence that the relationship between king and cult hinged not only on his association with the victorious warrior deity but also on his association with the goddess as protective and life-giving emanation of that deity. These emanations took on different forms over time, and sometimes they even elided with the figure of the king. As early as Middle Bronze IIB, Canaanite iconography of the king shares common features of the symbolic universe of the goddess: uraei, caprids, and the lion.41 In the Iron Age the stylized tree is the dominant goddess symbol and portrays the presence of divine power in the form of prosperity and blessing.42 The continuity between king and goddess during this period Religion,Religion, p. 224. 40 This is not to deny the relationship between the king and the male national patron deity. In this context, YHWH and Baal as patron deities coalesce in their role as guarantor of royal might and slayer of the king's enemies. See Smith, Early History of God, pp. 91—107. For a summary of the present state of research into the form and function of the goddess, with a particular apology for visualizing, see I.

It is likely that from early on, an Ashera as stylized tree in the Israelite royal cult may have been regarded as having a mediatory function for YHWH.43 When the Ashera of the Khirbet el-Qom and Kuntillet 'Ajrud inscriptions is mentioned in the context of a blessing, it confirms the iconographic evidence: she/it may be viewed as an emanation of YHWH by which his blessing is mediated.44 Though the goddess becomes noticeably absent in Iron IIB and seals from Canaan reflect instead a royal fascination with Egyptian power symbols featuring the male gender and solar powers, it would appear, say Keel and Uehlinger, that the goddess who receded into symbolic representation by a tree in the Early Iron Age becomes 'resemanticized' into the figure of the king by Iron IIB, as did the lion and the caprid.45 If they are correct, the king's identification with the goddess remains unbroken. It is in Iron IIC with the increase of Assyrian influence in Canaan, and coincidental with the reigns of Hezekiah and Manasseh, that the anthropomorphic representation of the god dess along with the astral powers return to prominence as symbolic of the visible power of the deity to bless, a possible revival of an older 'Canaanite' tradition from the Bronze age.46 This revival is accompanied by an increase in the number of cylinder seals imported into Palestine from Assyria, whose most frequently occurring motif is the king engaged in cultic activity before the starry deities, with whom the goddess Ishtar shared a privileged connection. His loyalty to the heavenly powers effects 43 Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, pp. 234-6. Cf. Schroer, In Israel gab es Bilder, pp. 44-5; Koch, 'Aschera', pp. 99—100 and P. D.

The artwork at this site showing aspects of the goddess (nursing mother, caprid, and stylized tree) is in striking contrast to the lack of goddess motifs found in contemporary local glyptic art, something Keel and Uehlinger, following Beck, regard as evidence that the artwork is Syro-Phoenician (Gods, p. 278). 45 Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, pp. 248-81 and esp. 270. See also Smith, Early History History of God, pp. 154-5· 46 Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, p. 317.

One of these from Shechem, shows her surrounded by a wreath of stars with the king making a vow before her.48 Schroer and Koch have proposed that she is synonymous with the Queen of Heaven mentioned in Jeremiah 7 and 44.49 Koch goes as far as considering the triad Baal, Ashera, and the starry host of the Deuteronomists in 2 Kings 23 to be the equivalent of Asshur, Ishtar, and the Great Gods of the neo-Assyrian pantheon.50 In addition to this, trees recalling the Branch Goddess are seen in Palestinian stamp seals emphasizing Sin of Haran in his nearness and ability to bless. From this and other portrayals of the crescent the likelihood exists that YHWH was conceptualized in Iron IIC Judah as a celestial or lunar El whose Ishtar mediated his nearness, order, and blessing.51 A cylinder seal from Beth Shean shows an El figure with a non anthropomorphic cultic symbol (an Ashera) in the form of a stylized tree mediating the blessing of that deity. A similar symbolic system would have existed for worshippers seeing an Ashera in the Jerusalem temple during this time.52 It is clear that a king in Manasseh's position would have fallen heir to the Ishtar symbolism and exploited it to the full. This brings us to the role of the goddess in popular religion. The presence of the terracotta doves and the pillar figurines appearing from the eighth to the seventh centuries in and around Jerusalem has created significant interest in the goddess of the domestic sphere, though scholars remain uncertain about their precise function. Keel and Uehlinger propose that a lack of attention to the reverse side of the figurines compared to the careful depiction of their faces suggests that they personalized Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, pp. 288-92. 48 Schroer, In Israel gab es Bilder, p. 276; Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, p. 292.

Van der Toorn calls it a form of devotion that may be seen as 'derived from and dependent on the official religion'.55 So too does Byrne, who infers from the provenance of the figurines and their distribution across social boundaries that the lines between national cult and popular cult were blurred.56 Of particular interest to officialdom would have been the ideology of reproduction.57 Thus far it may be proposed from the artefactual and iconographic evidence that during the late monarchic period the goddess or her symbolic representation appears in both official and popular worship as the High God's mediatrix of fertility and protection. The goddess was, moreover, vital to royal ideology, as shown by the close relationship between king and goddess symbol on numerous cylinder seals. The exact identity of such a personalized goddess is not important to our argument.58 What is 53 Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, pp. 323-32 and esp. 336. 54 See Albertz, History of Israelite Religion, p. 193 and Hadley, Cult of Ashera,Ashera, pp. 202-5. A number of other scholars suggest that Ashera is represented by the Pillar figurines: Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, p. 333; Schroer, In In Israel gab es Bilder, p. 44; Van der Toorn, 'Israelite Figurines', pp. 50 and 61-2; Miller, Religion, 35, and R.

I am indebted to Gordon Hamilton for pointing me to this source. 57 Byrne, 'Lie Back', pp. 140—5. The Josianic reforms appear to have had little effect on the prevalence of the figurines. One wonders if there is not a similar ideological explanation for the proliferation of Yahwistic theophoric names at this time, a practice, Albertz notes, pioneered by the royal family in the name of official kingship theology (History of Israelite Religion, p. 187). The point has been made that there is not always a correlation between the deities of theophoric names and the worship of those deities. See Smith, Early History History of God, pp. 5 and 131, and Keel and Uehlinger, Gods, p. 310. 58 Smith finds minimal evidence for a goddess Ashera during the monarchic period (Early History of God, p. 131). But Schroer argues for a goddess Ashera as a protective entity and/or fertility symbol alongside of or subordinate to YHWH (In Israel gab es Bilder, p. 44). In similar vein, Koch advances various plausible reasons for regarding the Queen of Heaven and Ashera as being one and the same goddess ('Aschera', p. hi). S. Ackerman, Under Every Green Tree: Popular Religion in Sixth Century Judah (HSM 46; Atlanta,</page><page sequence="16">BOSHETBOSHET IN JEREMIAH 3:24 493 more important is to determine how characters in the symbolic world related to one another. The king in Jerusalem who mediated the divine role of providing fertility would have regarded himself in symbolic unity with the goddess, and the general subsistence population, whose need for protection and life-giving forces was more visceral, would have had an equal or more acutely felt vested interest in her closeness.59 Here then were all the components of the perfect hegemonic system where king and populace are bound together in co-dependence, with the throne as the beneficiary. V At this point we need to return to Ha-Boshet, who consumes in Jer. 3:24. The Queen of Heaven of Jer. 7:18 and 44:17, in contrast, was acknowledged by the common people to have given food in plenty, prosperity, and protection from misfortune. It would be reasonable to suggest that in the symbolic world of Iron IIC such a goddess would have been called to mind also in this passage. In the light of this symbolism it is worth turning our attention to some recent re-examinations of the term Boshet. The standard approach to ha-Boshet in Jeremiah 3 is that it must be read in its regular meaning of 'shameful thing', in which case it was substituted for Baal.60 In support of this it is argued that in theophoric names, the MT of Samuel substitutes -boshet/-beshet for -baal found in Chronicles, where it is more original.61 Objections to this have been raised by Tsevat, Hamilton, and more recently by Schorch,62 who contend that this lexeme is a real linguistic element, in other words, that it is not a hybridized form GA: Scholars Press, 1992), p. 34, suggests that the Queen of Heaven is a syncretistic deity displaying aspects of Astarte and Ishtar. Delcor, in trying to provide a solution to the conflicting evidence about goddesses, nonetheless notices the 'astonishing continuity' that exists across time periods and cultures for goddesses who bear the title of Queen of Heaven (M. Delcor, 'Le Culte de la "Reine du Ciel" selon Jer 7,18; 44,17-19,25 et ses Survivances', in W. C. Delsman, J. R. Τ. M. Peters, and J. T.

Instead, it may have functioned as a divine epithet in the feminine. I find their contribution compelling for the following reasons: 1. 1. It is methodologically suspect to assume that scribes are responsible for textual readings that appear to be emendations, without first exhausting alternative possi bilities. Tsevat traces the origin of the substitution theory to Abraham Geiger.63 Geiger's notion of theologically motivated emendation has had a wide reception, judging by the influence it has exerted also on Septuagint studies.64 In the meantime adequate linguistic evidence has come to light from the advances made in Assyriology to suggest that these theophoric forms are original.65 Apart from this, premisses about revocalization are applied to some divine names, e.g. Molek and Astoreth, but not to others, e.g. Ishtar, which are assumed to be natural.66 Also, evidence from the Septuagint is selectively employed. For example, the phonology of Αστάρτη is adduced as evidence for the original pronunciation before the vowels were changed to those of boshet,boshet, but the vocalization Μολοχ of LXX Reigns and Jeremiah is not regarded as significant evidence for an etymology of *mulk, a divine epithet.67 2. Bst in theophoric names typically does not mean 'shame' but is a divine title. Tsevat, following Jastrow, Bohl, and Lewy, suggested that here we have the divine epithet bastu of the 'Baal oder Boschet? Ein umstrittenes theophores Element zwischen Religions und Textgeschichte', ZAW 112 (2000), pp. 598-611. 63 Tsevat, 'Ishbosheth', p. 71, with full bibliographical references. 64 John Wevers, for example, has a great fondness for quoting Zacharias Frankel, who was influenced by Geiger. Frankel's book is entitled Uber den EinflussEinfluss der palastinischen Exegese auf die alexandrinische Hermeneutik (Leipzig: Verlag J. A. Barth, 1851). See e.g. J. W. Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Leviticus Leviticus (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1997), p. ix. As a consequence Wevers has been criticized for his favouring of inner-Septuagintal scribal activity over textual variants. Jobes and Silva lament that Wevers 'did not even choose one of the Qumran readings as original' (K. Jobes and M. Silva, Invitation to the SeptuagintSeptuagint [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 2001], p. 170). 65 Tsevat, 'Ishbosheth', p. 74. However, Hamilton rightly criticizes Tsevat for making too hasty a semantic connection between Akkadian and Hebrew, without explaining how the connection might have come about ('New Evidence', p. 231, n. 12). 66 Tsevat, 'Ishbosheth', pp. 74 and 75. 67 Ibid. p. 74.</page><page sequence="18">BOSHETBOSHET IN JEREMIAH 3:24 495 Amarna Letters, glossed in the CAD as 'dignity, pride, vigor'.68 Hamilton provides additional evidence that has come to light since Tsevat's article, i.e. that the term bst is attested once in a Punic name, and 15 times in Amorite names.69 The Amorite occurrences are closer chronologi cally to the time of the biblical names carrying -boshet such as Mephiboshet and Ishboshet. Following HufFmon's sugges tion that bst was an Akkadian loanword in Amorite, he infers a similar meaning for *bast- in Hebrew and Punic. The difficulty one would have to surmount in accepting this is to show that the Akkadian meaning 'protective spirit' would have replaced the usual Amorite meaning of 'shame'. Hamilton asks whether the meaning 'shame' found in names such as 'my shame is my guardian' would be more plausible than 'my protective spirit is my guardian'. To strengthen his case he turns to the occurrence of the Akkadian meaning in the Amarna letters written in Canaan at a time post-dating the Amorite names by four centuries, but predating the Hebrew usage by four centuries.70 Using the data from Chronicles to infer that emendations are present in Samuel is problematic. Schorch's treatment of the correction theory deals with the issue that scribes made tendentious changes in the text of Samuel, while Chronicles represents the original forms. He observes that where MT Samuel has אשבשת and MT Chronicles has אשבעל, it is attributable to deviation between Samuel and Chr, and there is no text-critical case to be made that there ever was a variant containing בעל- in Samuel. מפיבשת, on the other hand, seems to offer a more clear-cut case for substitution, until one notices that the variation also affects the non-theophoric element of the names. That is to say, in Chronicles the names appear as מריבעל or מר יבבעל. One cannot then assume only a substitution of the theophoric element without explaining the substitution of the other.71 Similarly, where Jerubbaal occurs as Jerubbeshet, it further complicates the 68 Ibid. p. 76. 69 Hamilton, 'New Evidence', p. 230, citing J. D. Fowler, Theophoric Personal Personal Names in Ancient Hebrew: A Comparative Study (JSOTSup 49; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1988), pp. 58-9, and I. J. Gelb, Computer-Aided Analysis Analysis of Amorite (Assyriological Studies, 21; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), p. 115. 70 Hamilton, 'New Evidence', p. 234. 71 Schorch, 'Baal', 601; compare Tsevat, 'Ishbosheth', pp. 81-2 and Hamilton, 'New Evidence', p. 239.</page><page sequence="19">6 DIRK BUCHNER substitution theory, since -boshet is not -beshet. McCarthy's explanation that this indicates a third stage of neutralization is for Schorch just another attempt to shore up the emen dation theory at all costs.72 Furthermore, argues Schorch, those who hold to this theory have to prove that first, the meaning 'shame' is intended, and secondly, that secondary corrections were being made. In his opinion, theological tendencies that demythologize or excise references to Baal are not discernible in the books of Samuel.73 4. The theophoric elements -baal and -boshet are interchangeable. Persons carry different theophoric names, and it may very well be that -baal and -boshet are closely associated, as has been suggested by Bohl as early as 1909, from which Schorch concludes that -boshet may stand in for -baal.74 This makes it less surprising that in the Hebrew Bible בעל and בשת occur in parallel (Hos. 9:10 and Jer. 11:13). 5. The Septuagint offers further support for point 4. At 3 Reigns 18:19 and 25, Codex Β (which is generally regarded as the older tradition, and adopted by Rahlfs) against Codex A reads της αισχύνης for הבעל of the MT.75 This means that there may have been a Hebrew Vorlage containing הבשת that was altered to read הבעל, this alteration being in the opposite direction usually assumed for Samuel. Or, the translator regarded בשת and בעל as interchangeable.76 Schorch, 'Baal', p. 602: 'Wiederum muss also eine komplizierte Konstruktion bemiiht werden, um die Erklarung als Korrektur aufrechthalten zu konnen.' 73 Ibid. p. 606. 74 Ibid., and compare Hamilton's argument about Jerubbaal/Jerubbeshet ('New Evidence', p. 236). This would answer the objections raised by Day that this substitution only occurs in names containing Baal (Yahtveh and the Gods, p. 62). 75 Schorch, 'Baal', p. 608, who probably meant בשת and בעל not בשת and בשת. Cf P. K. McCarter, II Samuel (AB; New York: Doubleday, 1984), p. 86, who simply refers to 'the Greek'. 76 If this is true, it would account for the number of instances where the feminine article is employed by the Septuagint translators for βααλ in a number of different contexts: 2 Kgs. 21:3, Tobit 1:5, Hos. 2:11 and 13:1, Zeph. 1:14, as well as consistently throughout Jeremiah. The traditional argument put forward by Dillmann ('Uber Baal mit dem weiblichen Artikel', MonatsberichteMonatsberichte der koniglich preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Berlin, 1881),1881), pp. 601—20) is that αισχύνη is being presupposed, but Vonach has argued in the opposite direction, i.e. that the substitution is too hurriedly assumed, and on insufficient evidence, particularly as regards the occurrence of the feminine article in LXX Jeremiah ("H Baal in der Jer-LXX: Erschliessung</page><page sequence="20">BOSHETBOSHET IN JEREMIAH 3:24 497 In any case, the regular transcription βααλ occurs in adjacent verses. Secondly, while Hebrew בשת is frequently rendered by αισχύνη, one sees that in the theophoric names, the Greek translators offer the transliteration -βοσθε, suggesting a Hebrew form בשתי, i.e. with hireq-compaginis. It is known that older forms are preserved in names and usually such forms predate MT since they are usually corrected in the Qere.Qere. It is likely that the LXX preserves a pre-MT pronunciation of a theophoric name, and this is for Schorch the most weighty piece of evidence that counts against scribal correction.77 In view of these arguments one could propose that Boshet in Jer. 3:24 was understood as an actual female entity, in which case the feminine verb with this noun makes good sense;78 or at least that the chant in Jer. 3:24 contained a pun on a real linguistic element in the vernacular.79 In his treatment of Ha-Boshet as a free standing title (Hos. 9:10, Jer. 3:24, and Jer. 11:13), Hamilton finds it difficult to decide whether the prophets invented the epithet 'The Shame' from the common noun or expected their hearers to recall the rare sense 'the Protective Spirit' (or if one accepts Day's corrective 'Pride', 'Dignity', 'Vigour').80 It is likely that Jeremiah, like Hosea, attacked the onomastic sense by the use of a pun. The hearers would have been well aware of the onomastic sense since three names containing the epithet belong to four Israelites from the pre-monarchic and early monarchic periods.81 I would only differ from Hamilton in suggesting that rather than associating the epithet with Baal, who was not regarded as an emanation of Yahweh at this time, the hearers would more likely have associated 'the Protective One/Vigour' with a goddess figure.82 This may have been Ishtar as emanation neuer Horizonte als Ubersetzungstechnik', in Horizonte bihlischer Texte: Festschrift Festschrift fiir Josef M. Oesch [OBO 196; Fribourg: Academic Press and Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Rupprecht, 2003], pp. 59-70). 77 Schorch, 'Baal', pp. 609-11. 78 The concord in gender of noun and verb could merely be a grammatical category. But as was mentioned at the beginning, this is the only time that BoshetBoshet takes a verb. 79 That a Punic term would be employed in Palestine is not unlikely, since a Syrian connection has been posited for cultic practices outlawed by Josiah, notably the Molech cult and the כמרים (Koch, 'Aschera', p. 118). 80 Yahweh and the Gods, p. 62. 81 Hamilton, 'New Evidence', p. 242. 82 See ibid. p. 245. The attributes that YHWH shared at this point in time were more likely those of Sin and El. Baal would have been more closely associated with Iron IIB symbolism of the solar 'Lord of Heaven' (Keel and</page><page sequence="21">498 DIRK BLJCHNER of Adad or Ashera, as she was named in Canaan, widely revered as the mediatrix of the blessing of El and subsequently also of YHWH. Hamilton is not averse to considering the Queen of Heaven to be a possible referent of this title at Jer. 11:13.83 In conclusion it may be said that the penitence chant included in Jeremiah's harlotry cycle is a spindle on which to thread some strands from politics, society, and the world of the goddess. It echoes not the voice of the dominant (who tended not to lose things) but the first-person voice of the dominated who suffered the kind of loss that peasants throughout history have tended to do. The occurrence of boshtenu in the next line shows that some of their own complicity, willing or unwilling, is being evoked in the hearers and readers.84 They lived and moved in a sacred universe whose material benefits were guaranteed by the monarch and his goddess, in the same way that his successes were those of the male patron deity. One wonders whether the goddess venerated in the domestic cult as the tried and trusted hedge against misfortune was ever stripped of her symbolic unity with the figure of the king. If not, then every king would have been able to exploit this symbolism to his benefit: your goddess is mine. The penitence liturgy may then be read as a song of resistance that twice denounces the goddess. Instead of being given a glorious title such as 'Excellent Lady' or 'Splendid Lady' she is given one that is homophonous with 'The Shame'. Instead of bringing fortune and fertility, she devours.85 Uehlinger, Gods, pp. 283—314). Compare also what is said of the goddess PTGYH in the Ekron Inscription of Akhayus (2.42): 'May she bless him, and protect him and prolong his days, and may she bless his land' (W. W. Hallo [ed.], The Context of Scripture, vol. 2: Monumental Inscriptions from the Biblical World World [Leiden: Brill, 2000], p. 164). 83 'New Evidence', p. 248. 84 This is true to the definitions offered by Ewick and Silbey of power: it is something that circulates, that operates in a net-like organization, and is 'a series of transactions whose consequences are contingent upon the contributions of all the parties, those who turn out to be the more powerful... and those who turn out to have been less powerful' (P. Ewick and S. Silbey, 'Narrating Social Structure: Stories of Resistance to Legal Authority', American Journal of Sociology 108/6 [2006], pp. 1328—53 and this citation from p. 1332). 85 Compare the praise of Anat in the Ninurta-Kudurri-Usur (2.115D) inscription, who is given these grand titles and held to be guarantor of prosperity and abundance (Hallo, [ed.], Context of Scripture, vol. 2, p. 283). Hamilton points out that the clauses following the reference to Ha-Boshet in Hos. 9 provide a hint of what is expected of this deity: birth and pregnancy ('New Evidence', p. 244).</page><page sequence="22">BOSHETBOSHET IN JEREMIAH 3:24 499 As a postscript one might add a brief theological reflection. A liberationist or socio-critical reading of a prophetic text such as this also requires a redemptive perspective. This chant as well as its ultimate setting are profoundly negative. YHWH's תשועה is inoperative: in Holladay's words, the Shame has always been eating up the gain of the nation. Neither is תשובה anticipated; not by YHWH nor by the bearer of his message. Here Rogerson's insights are helpful. Like Jeremiah, he is uncertain whether in the present century inhumanity will in any way be mitigated by human action, and therefore a pessimistic reading of the Hebrew Bible is compelling.87 It is only once a situation is read from what he calls a 'negative dialectic', in other words, 'what is not', that it can be viewed in the light of redemption.88 YHWH's תשועה is operative when he is truly worshipped (instead of בשקר—v. to) by all and when as a consequence, the nation is whole and nourished.
