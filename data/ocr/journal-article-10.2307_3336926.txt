(Clifford 1986:10) This message lies at the heart of "African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire," a traveling exhibition organized by the Amer- ican Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and curated by anthropologist Enid Schildkrout and historian Curtis A. Keim. "African Re- flections" is a cross-disciplinary examination of a regional African art style in the wake of immense social and political change. The exhi- bition traces the impact of exploration and colonialism on northeastern Zairian art during the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies, and in so doing helps to dissolve the fiction of a "timeless" Africa and exposes the interface of this region's encounter with the West. As its title suggests, "African Reflec- tions" is about the refracting perceptions and stereotypes that result from "outsiders" look- ing into a culture, and from insiders reversing the gaze and reflecting it back. The exhibition's premise is that what was identified in early-twentieth-century Euro- pean art circles as "traditional" Mangbetu anthropomorphic art-characterized by a bound, elongated head and a certain style of body painting, hallmarks of late-nineteenth- century royal Mangbetu fashion-was actual- ly made by neighboring groups such as the Zande and the Barambo, and then only by the Mangbetu as a response to the encounter with the West in the late 1800s. For centuries, the Mangbetu people produced an array of objects and art forms that incorporated a variety of geometric and decorative patterns. The addition of the human form occurred only during the early colonial period, intend- ed to satisfy the aesthetic preferences of a new foreign audience. This theory of the rise of Mangbetu-style anthropomorphic art provides the exhibi- tion's visual focus and thematic thread while also addressing a broad range of related issues, many of which are avoided or sup- pressed in most treatments of African art. Such issues include the art historical implica- tions of Africa's confrontation with the West; the complex interregional dynamics and approaches to ethnicity; the formulation of myths about other cultures; and the stereo- types and prejudices that color ethnographic research and influence perceptions of artistic style. "African Reflections" is exceptional in the way it dissects historical data, tests the validity of secondary sources, and visually demonstrates how the image of a non- Western culture was invented by the West and then reappropriated by Africa in a circu- lating pattern of mythmaking and recycling. Northeastern Zaire-for decades called the "heart of darkness" in literature and pop- ular language-has long been subject to Western myths and stereotypes of a remote, exotic, and mysterious Africa. Beginning with the early Greek historian, Herodotus, myths have proliferated about a land just south of the Sahara inhabited by "cannibals" and "dwarfs." Even with the arrival of the first explorers and scientists in northern Central Africa in the latter part of the nine- teenth century, elements of such myths were retained, passed on from one writer to anoth- er in spite of knowledge to the contrary. A pivotal turn in the literature can be traced to 1870, when the German botanist Georg Schweinfurth stayed for twenty days at a Mangbetu king's court and wrote the first eyewitness account of the culture. In an exalted writing style, Schweinfurth, who sought to portray the Mangbetu as the most "civilized" of the peoples in the region, describes a sumptuous court life, a refined tradition of decorative art, a distinctive form of body adornment, and a highly centralized kingdom. Nowhere, however, does he or any other precolonial observer mention the pres- ence of an anthropomorphic Mangbetu artistic tradition. And yet the objects that constitute the early colonial collections amassed by sev- eral expeditions show a strong emphasis on the human form. This contradiction between the early accounts and the material evidence impelled Schildkrout, Curator of Anthropology at the AMNH, which holds one of the world's most extensive collections of northeastern Zairian art, and Keim, Chairman of the History Department at Moravian College and a Mangbetu specialist, to reconstruct an art his- tory of the region through this exhibition and the accompanying book (see review, p. 14).

Conducted by two scientists-Herbert Lang, a mammalogist and photographer, and James P. Chapin, an ornithologist and painter who was only eighteen years old at the time-the expe- dition returned to New York with fifty-four tons of material acquired from 1909 to 1915. Keim's recent field research among the Mangbetu and his critical reading of these early documents, coupled with Schildkrout's expertise on ethnicity and her museum research on the Lang/Chapin expedition, merged to form a presentation as comprehen- sive as it is analytical. "African Reflections" expresses its ideas through an exhibition for- mat whose crispness and clarity resulted from Schildkrout's close collaboration with exhibi- tion designer Clifford La Fontaine, in associa- tion with Marlene Adlerblum. In the installation at the AMNH, "African Reflections" opened with an orientation gallery, where a wall panel introduced the theme of anthropomorphism in northeastern Zairian art, and the broader historical context. Maps and enlarged photographs acquainted the viewer with the region's geography, land- scape, and linguistic and ethnic complexity. Selected objects, including knives, horns, pots, headdresses, and masks, reflected the range of materials, styles, and forms of northeastern Zairian art. The forest-green walls were occa- sionally interrupted by a silkscreened band of Mangbetu design. Variations of this band appeared at intervals throughout the exhibi- tion, holding it together like a ribbon. The exhibition itself occupied one large rectangular space honeycombed into a maze of smaller galleries. The ability to see through glass cases to angles of previous gal- leries or to catch a glimpse of one to come seemed fitting for an exhibition that sought to illustrate a region's reflecting and refract- ing forms and styles. One of the most striking moments in the exhibition occurred at the beginning, where a life-size diorama featured King Mbunza holding a ceremony at his court. Except for the mannequin of the king and one fiber belt, all objects in the diorama were collected between 1869 and 1915, and some may actu- ally have belonged to Mbunza. The scene was based on an original 1874 drawing by Schweinfurth-copies of which were placed nearby along with his descriptive text-and was set against an enormous photographic mural of another Schweinfurth drawing, which depicts the Mangbetu king's 180 wives wearing the celebrated fan-shaped hairstyle of the period and sitting on sculpted stools in his great hall. The label accompanying the diorama discussed the creation of a "Mangbetu myth," which was to appear in subsequent Western writings and even in the artistic productions of neighboring peoples seeking the trappings of Mangbetu royalty. The next three sections dealt with explo- ration, colonialism, and the AMNH expedi- tion respectively. They presented the first objects identified as Mangbetu and visually illustrated how the misnomer of "Mangbetu" figurative art both originated and was per- petuated in the early colonial era. For exam- ple, a haunting leather-clad figure collected by Emin Pasha (Eduard Schnitzer) in 1883 and now in the Museum fur Volkerkunde in Vienna, along with two masks collected by Guy Burrows in 1895-96 and currently in the British Museum, were all originally cata- logued as "Monbottou." Yet as a label ex- plained, "Monbottou" was used to designate all of northeastern Zaire before the area's eth- nic complexity was unraveled. The Mangbetu had neither anthropomorphic figures nor a masking tradition at the time these objects were collected, so the masks were probably made by the Bua or Budu. In addition to showing how Westerners misinterpreted the region's art by relying on generalized, uninformed labels for it, these galleries also revealed that much of what we know as Mangbetu art is actually the work of other peoples. Neighboring groups began to carve objects representing Mangbetu people as a form of identification with and emulation of the dominant political force in the region dur- ing the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One case displaying figurative harps was accompanied by an original Schweinfurth drawing of the carved head on a Zande harp. An inscription in Schweinfurth's writing next to the sketch explained that the carving depicts King Mbunza, the Mangbetu king at that time. It was probably made by the Zande to honor their powerful overlord. This section of the exhibition also intro- duced the individuals who contributed to the collection and, in so doing, to the creation of a Mangbetu ethnography. Through their eyes the past has come down to us; their percep- tions are the lenses through which we must peer into the precolonial and early colonial period. Of special interest was a case with some of the original articles belonging to Lang and Chapin, such as a hat and an intri- cate and well-used bird-skinning kit. Another case of arresting charm showed how artists ingeniously incorporated the two Americans into the iconography of various objects. For example, in a pair of European-style pipes depicting the scientists, Lang's portrait is identifiable by the thick brown mustache. The next suite of galleries treated multiple aspects of the life and art of northeastern Zairian peoples, including architectural sculpture and furnishings of the royal court, musical instruments, healing and divination paraphernalia, secret association insignia, hunting and fishing implements, pottery, bas- ketry, household items, brideswealth, chil- dren's accoutrements, body adornments, art "to look at," and art produced for the tourist market. Amidst a wealth of excellently craft- ed objects, a number of sculptures stood apart and enchanted the eye, such as a moth- er and child whose bodies were fused into a single torso and a sanza musical instrument in the form of a dancing human figure. Equally beautiful were fine ivory hairpins, fantastic feather hats, and brass knives with sickle-shaped blades. Three musical recordings filtered through designated areas of the exhibition space. For example, the section on the royal orchestra featured music of the court, whereas visitors to the family gallery were treated to children's songs and songs of everyday life. An alcove at the end of the exhibition showed a continu- ously running fifteen-minute video commis- sioned by the AMNH and produced and directed in 1989 by Jeremy Marre (Harcourt Films, London) in consultation with Enid Schildkrout and D. J. Demolin. A sixty-minute film titled "Spirits of Defiance: The Mangbetu People of Zaire," produced by the BBC, the Arts and Entertainment Network, and the AMNH, was also featured periodically in the museum's auditorium. In both the video and the film, photographs of objects in the exhibi- tion were shown to present-day Mangbetu people to elicit comments from them about their own history, and to lend a modern Mangbetu voice to the exhibition. Interspersed among the works of art-and sometimes placed behind them-were superb photographic enlargements and murals of varying size, seventy-seven black-and- white photographs taken by Lang between 77</page><page sequence="3">1909 and 1915, and nine color photographs taken by scholars during the 1980s. The con- trast between the black and whites and the color prints transported the viewer back in time and reinforced the exhibition's histori- cal dimension. Because of Lang and Chapin's fastidious collecting techniques, most of the objects exhibited were dated, and some were signed by the artists who made them, a feature that set "African Reflections" apart from many African-art exhibitions that leave objects undated due to a lack of collection records. It was also one of the first exhibitions to display objects made upon commission by European visitors, or by African rulers for Europeans, without differentiating them from those art- works already in use at the time of their col- lection. The curators' rationale was that these new commissions reflected the changing political environment in which art was being produced, and, therefore, should not be con- sidered "fakes" or "tourist art." Nevertheless, questions arose as to which objects were made for Lang and Chapin and what the pro- cess and economics of commissioning trans- actions involved. For example, the label for an immense ivory horn emphatically stated that the surrender of such a horn "meant absolute submission to the chief's victorious enemies." The catalogue adds that Lang col- lected a large ivory horn said to be like one owned by Chief Zebuandra (Schildkrout &amp; Keim 1990:187). One wonders how and by what means the nearly 2.5-meter-long horn ended up in the museum's case, and whether it is a replica or an original work. Depending upon the data available to the curators, certain themes in the exhibition received fuller treatment than others. For example, the exhibition was strong on the role of women in Mangbetu history and art. There was considerable information about Nenzima-Chief Okondo's senior wife and Mbunza's daughter-who judged cases and was considered to be the most powerful per- son at Okondo's court. And sections on body adornment offered an intricate understand- ing of Mangbetu concepts of feminine beauty and aesthetics. By contrast, the section on secret associa- tions was spare, presumably due to the diffi- culty of penetrating these closed institutions. This was unfortunate, since they might have provided some pieces of the puzzle that underlies the rise and decline of Mangbetu anthropomorphic art. In other Central African societies, such as the Lega and the Luba, secret associations play an important part in dictating aspects of form and iconog- raphy in art. A similar imbalance in the historical record distinguishes the wealth of early colonial data from the dearth of precolonial evidence. The almost total absence of archae- ological research in this area leaves one to contemplate what ceramic sequences might have revealed about anthropomorphism in precolonial art, and what ironworking tech- nologies could have suggested about artistic change. The exhibition also might have bene- PHOTO LYNTON GARDINER fited from an investigation into the etymolo- gy and the significance (if any) of geometric and other nonrepresentational design ele- ments, which both predate and survive the anthropomorphic genre. "African Reflections," with its 452 objects and 86 photographs, is one of the largest traveling African-art exhibitions to date, testi- mony to the sheer proliferation of art produc- tion during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although 452 is a modest number considering that Westerners collected more than 20,000 objects in northeastern Zaire between 1898 and 1915-4,800 of which now belong to the AMNH-it is a large number for a standard museum exhibi- tion. This size resulted in considerable repetition of certain object types, such as anthropomorphic harps. Before the exhibi- tion travels to other venues, it will be pared down to a more select assortment of objects and photographs. While this might elevate the aesthetic level of the exhibition, it may prove less representative of the actual cor- pus, reflecting the arbitrary modifications that non-Western exhibitions undergo in order to meet the particular requirements of art and anthropology museums. As indicated by the exhibition's title, all of the objects included were classified as "art," whether they were strictly utilitarian hunting tools, musical instruments, hair ornaments, or sculptures meant to be appreciated for their form. Indeed, one of the exhibition's many achievements was to show that north- eastern Zairian sculpture was often made and enjoyed for its aesthetic appeal, and not strictly for ritual purposes. Defining art of non-Western peoples only as functional objects of ritual is a legacy of the colonial past. This point was especially well made in the last section of the exhibition, which FEMALE FIGURE. MANGBETU. WOOD, GLASS BEADS, BARKCLOTH, PLANT FIBER; 43cm. LANG COLLECTION. NIANGARA, 1910. AMNH, NEW YORK, 90.1/4295. showed how anthropomorphic art reflected fashions of body adornment and how some objects were made exclusively to be contem- plated by their owners. One of the labels quoted Lang, who wrote that chiefs kept such figures in their rooms to admire them. Although this point was made effectively, it did not account for all the objects in the exhibition. A large proportion of them re- mained material culture and not art (by Western standards and probably by Mang- betu standards as well). The curators' intent was to show that even the most mundane objects-for instance, arrow shafts and drink- ing cups rendered with decorative motifs- were worked, embellished, and transformed into objects of beauty. In other words, the exhibition conveyed two messages simulta- neously: that African works of art are not always intended to be ritually functional, and that functional objects-tools, imple- ments, and objects of use-are often en- hanced and beautified, thus obscuring and transcending rigid Western categories of "art" versus "artifact." "African Reflections" was an exhibition with multiple levels of information and sig- nificance. On one level, it was a comprehen- sive ethnographic presentation of a Central African region at the turn of the century about which little was previously known. Its meandering galleries covered a broad spec- trum of information and material culture, thus filling a considerable gap in the litera- ture on African studies. On another level, the exhibition treated the complex interregional dynamics of north- eastern Zaire, the sharing and copying of artistic styles, and the difficulty of assigning ethnic attributions to objects based on their form, style, and iconography. This facet of the exhibition has ramifications for many parts of Africa, particularly other Central African regions such as the Luba sphere of influence in southeastern Zaire, where cross-ethnic bor- rowing of metaphors, insignia, scarification patterns, and other cultural artifacts has led to fluid inter-ethnic identification. Third, the exhibition, which traced change and continuity in style and form dur- ing a particular time period, was a veritable art history. It demonstrated the extent to which contact with other cultures influenced the region's artistic development, and it showed how rapidly artists and patrons responded to the changes occurring about them: "The art traditions of northeastern Zaire were being continually redefined as peoples migrated, extended trading net- works, conquered each other, and resisted conquest. The art of the early colonial period was just one phase in the continual transfor- mation of these traditions; it just happens to be in the one period most accessible to us" (Schildkrout &amp; Keim 1990:27). The historicity 78</page><page sequence="4">of "African Reflections" will serve as a model for future exhibitions on African art. Finally, one of the exhibition's greatest contributions was its critical analysis of the sources for, and its insights into the "writ- ing" of, cultural history and ethnography. At a moment in the history of Western social scientific inquiry when the question of self/other hovers over all attempts by Western scholars to penetrate non-Western thought and aesthetic systems, this exhibi- tion addressed the issue with a concrete set of historical encounters and a corpus of material evidence, whose unfolding and transformation over time resulted not from one civilization casting its gaze upon anoth- er, but from the two-way commerce and exchange of perceptions and myths. "African Reflections" demonstrated that no matter how unobtrusive ethnographers may believe themselves to be, no matter how objectively they set down their obser- vations, all portrayals of culture are biased. Keim and Schildkrout presented the visitors to northeastern Zaire as products of their time, influenced by the language and the expectations of their generation and social background. Western writers often empha- size and exaggerate those things that are easiest to comprehend from a Western point of view, that are most facile to control, and that serve to elevate their own status or that of their society: "This strange dichotomy between myth and reality is ever-present, ever-changing. Western perceptions of other societies have often fluctuated with the esteem in which Westerners held their own civilization" (Fagan 1984:7). But just as Schweinfurth, Lang, and Chapin were products of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century attitudes, so are Keim and Schildkrout very much in sync with the intellectual currents of late-twenti- eth-century thought. "African Reflections" is a self-reflexive exhibition in its emphasis on whose eyes we are seeing through and on the motives behind the collection of art and ethnographic material at a particular moment in history. To look back and detect the errors and the limitations of a previous era is a step forward, but it does not make one resistant to the conventions of one's own time. As Vogel writes about scholarship in general: "Knowingly or not, we are all parti- sans on one side or another, and we all speak for our moment in time. If these texts had been written ten years ago, or ten years hence, they would tell a different story" (Vogel 1991:9). In addition to being a model of didactic coherence and visual richness, "African Reflections" successfully investigates com- plex theoretical issues through an exhibition format. It is a must for all people, especially for scholars and curators of non-Western culture and art. Those who see it will never look at archival sources or collections in quite the same way again. Through "African Reflections," Schildkrout and Keim remind us that the portrayal of culture is never wholly objective, that all cultures are in con- tinual flux, and that ethnographic research is a dialogue in which both parties are affected and reflected by the presence of the other. [ References cited, page 96 "African Reflections" will be on view at the National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C., until January 12, 1992. It will then travel to the Denver Museum of Natural History (February 14-June 2, 1992), the High Museum of Art, Atlanta (April 6-July 4, 1993), and the San Diego Museum of Art (September 11- November 6, 1993). One other venue for 1992 is still to be announced. The exhibition catalogue (see review, p. 14) is available in both hardcover ($39.95) and softcover ($27.50) from the Museum Shop of the AMNH The hardcover version is also available from the University of Washington Press ($45). The 60- minute film, "Spirits of Defiance: The Mangbetu People of Zaire," is available in VHS videotape for $19.95 from the AMNH Museum Shop. For all of the above, there is a $3.00 fee for postage and handling. A handsome brochure with color illustrations and a concise synopsis is available free of charge at the entrance to the exhibition. The exhibition was accompanied by a two-day symposium on October 12-13, 1990, titled "Tradition, Innovation, and Interpretation: Issues in the Collection and Display of the Arts of Zaire in Historical Perspective." In addition to schedul- ing lectures and films throughout the exhibition, the AMNH commissioned the production of "Azapane and the Peanuts," a children's play based on a Mangbetu folktale. "African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire" has been supported in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the New York State Council on the Arts, and the Ambrose Monell Foundation. INTO THE HEART OF AFRICA Royal Ontario Museum Toronto, Ontario, Canada November 16,1989-August 6,1990 Reviewed by Simon Ottenberg This was a controversial exhibit. Its aims are well presented by its originator, anthropolo- gist Jeanne Cannizzo, Curator of Ethnology at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), in the epilogue to her catalogue, Into the Heart of Africa (1989, p. 92): By studying the museum as an artifact, reading collections as cultural texts, and discovering the life histories of objects, it has become possible to understand something of the complexi- ties of cross-cultural encounters. In the same process, the intricacies of different cultural configurations are revealed in objects through which various African peoples have expressed not only their individual artistry but also their deep- est communal concerns. Finally, by placing in context the relationships, however brief, problematic, and painful that developed as Canadian soldiers and missionaries travelled into the heart of Africa, it has become clear that the past is part of the present. The exhibit belonged to a growing genre in African art studies that analyzes particular museum collections through the publications, diaries, and letters of the collectors, in the framework of ideas of the time. Other exam- ples of this genre are the recent northeastern Zaire exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, the evaluation of the collec- tion of Emil Torday by John Mack at the British Museum, and Mary Jo Arnoldi's con- tinuing study of Herbert Ward as a collector. "Into the Heart of Africa" explored the kinds of objects gathered, the reasons for their collection, in some instances the uses they were put to, and the attitudes of the col- lectors toward Africans. The pieces in the show, collected by members of the Canadian military and Protestant missionaries in the last quarter of the nineteenth and the first quarter of the twentieth centuries, form the bulk of the African collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. Most of it had never been exhibited before. Added to them were some objects on permanent loan from the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto. Comprising some 370 pieces, as well as over 20 photo blowups and several maps, the exhibit was divided into two parts. The first concerned how Canadians regarded both their work in Africa and African cultures, and the second focused on how Africans as well as museums have viewed the objects as cultural elements. A separate color scheme was employed for each room. A small introductory section, in blue, was linked to a prominently depicted Union Jack. It contained photographs explain- ing how Canadians became involved with Africa. Then there was the military gallery in gray, the color of Canadian uniforms, fol- lowed by the cruciform missionary hall in white. Cannizzo states that white represented the light that the missionaries thought they were bringing to Africa (pers. com., 1991). Next came a hall in sand and maroon, the rich colors of Africa, in which pieces were exam- ined as cultural objects. Lastly, a small gallery brought the exhibit up to the present. African musical and dance groups, storytellers, and films were presented here on various occa- sions during the exhibit's run. In the military room were objects collected by named Canadian military officers who fought in the Zulu and Boer wars, against the Asante, and in the conquest of northern Nigeria: stools, cloth, knives and swords, drums, and a wide-ranging collection of Zulu adornment and utilitarian objects. Label copy noted that Livingstone was once presented as a missionary model for Canadians. The focus of this room was the collection of the Reverend Walter T. Currie and the Ovimbundu mission at Chisamba, Angola, where many of 79</page><page sequence="5">A$FuA BOOKS African, ethnographic, and ancient art.

SMITH OMARI: Notes, from page 75 1. The validity and usefulness of the term "traditional" have been much debated but not satisfactorily resolved by histori- ans of African art in recent decades. As used here, it refers to an identifiable indigenous corpus of conventions that have remained little modified even in colonial- or postcolonial- contact situations. 2. All of the forty individuals I interviewed during the com- bined 1977 and 1989 research periods expressed this view, registered through dissatisfaction with the mainstream American status quo. Most residents I talked with were col- lege educated (at least one had earned a master's degree) and were fully aware that they were dropping out of the dominant society, frequently against their extended family's wishes. 3. Roy Wagner's theses in The Invention of Culture (1981) that cultures all over the world maintain a dialectic between con- vention and invention, and that all cultures are constantly invented and reinvented by both culture bearers and culture recorders, bear important theoretical ramifications for a clearer understanding of Oyotunjians (generally regarded as an anomaly in the African Diaspora) as conscious creative cultural "actors." These ideas are most convincingly articu- lated in the chapters "The Power of Invention" (pp. 35-70) and "The Invention of Society" (pp. 103-32). Oyotunji presents an interesting contrast to contemporary West Africa with its dialectic of movements toward mod- ernism or Westernism, and counter-movements toward the traditional. 4. This situation contrasts with those found in Brazil and Cuba, where direct and indirect historical links to slavery can be traced. Although the term "survivals" has received a great deal of bad press in the literature, it is my view that the true essence and positive value of the term can only be appreciated if understanding is attempted from the culture bearer's point of view. In this context, the emphasis is placed on the idea of tenacious adherence to African beliefs and behaviors despite often overwhelming adversity from the dominant European-oriented culture. The concept of sur- vival is seen by informants as being closely related to the concept of resistance. 5. "Society in this instance is conceived and operated (from 'within') as a set of (differentiating) devices for eliciting consistency and similarity, and its most basic distinctions are the ones that 'put the world together.' " (Wagner 1981:121). 6. I have observed a number of consultations with Merindinlogun (sixteen cowries) divination in 1977 and 1989 and been told of Ifa divinations and "roots readings" performed for local residents as well as those who regular- ly come from Savannah, Charleston, and other nearby areas. 7. Ifa, a pervasive literary and divination system among the Nigerian Yoruba, is very important in New World religions and culture. Ifa is one of the primary initiations given to beginning devotees to ensure a measure of control and har- mony in their lives. 8. Both in 1977 and in 1989, U.S. government food stamps were used by the wives, who take personal responsibility for feeding their children. 9. Both the Obi and the Merindinlogun divination systems are learned in Oyotunji only after the second, more intensive phase of initiation (Osu-Meta) is completed. The Obi system is simpler and derives its name from the one used among the Yoruba in Nigeria. In this system a form of obi (African fruit) known as obi merin (whose parts fall naturally into four divi- sions) is used by initiates to communicate on a daily basis in their ritual care of the gods. (In Oyotunji the same principle operates, but four dried bits of coconut shell are used instead.) Merindinlogun (sixteen cowries + one for Esu- Elegba) is received for each ikoko-awo (orisa pot). This more elaborate system is used for initiations and deeper consulta- tions with clients. 10. I was surprised that the children were cognizant of the latest rap groups (e.g., Run DMC and Slick Rick) and the words to their songs; many of the boys wore versions of the flat-top and razor-design haircuts so popular with the Hiphop subculture. 11. The flag, composed of red, gold, and green verticals with a Black Egyptian ankh (symbolizing life), was designed by Kabiyesi. 12. A significant reason for this amalgamation is that the Oba, who is the Chief Priest, was initiated in both Cuba (as a babalosha) and Abeokuta, Nigeria (as a babalawo, or Ifa priest). 13. This appears to be an insertion of the American concern with astrology that was popular when the village was founded. 14. An odu is a permutation of binary numbers achieved by throwing the opele. Each odu has a vast number of verses. The odu verses may be in prose or poetry and form the body of what we know as Ifa divination. In the New World, the odu has extended meaning as a "personal signature" like one's handwriting, or even a prediction of the future. Odus can also provide advice and solutions to problems which people follow as they would a medical physician's orders and pre- scriptions. 15. The sociologist Clovis Semmes (1981) asserts that orga- nized resistance actually began on the slave ships bound for America (e.g., the Amistad mutiny by Cinque). 16. This ceremony was performed in June 1981 in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, by the Ooni Okunade Sijuwade Olubushe II, at the first International World Congress of Orisa Culture and Tradition. Oba Adefunmi was proclaimed the Alashe of New World "Yoruba" in America and was given a sword as a symbol of his office and authority. References cited Bascom, William. 1969.
