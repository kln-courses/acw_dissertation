FARMER Department of Art History Virginia Commonwealth University P.O. Box 843046 Richmond, VA 23284-3046 ABSTRACT Revised iconographic interpretations of Anasazi Basketmaker art and related burial items suggest that many Basketmaker rock art images depict decapi- tated or dismembered sacrificial victims or casualties of war. Comparisons with contemporary burial goods, including human remains, support this ar- gument. Atlatls, large basket trays, clay figurines, and full scalps reflect im- ages and designs that can be directly or symbolically related to human sacri- fice. Basketmaker warfare and sacrifice are also examined in the context of similar themes depicted in the art of earlier and contemporary Precolumbian cultures of Middle and South America. This context offers iconographic sup- port to the ethnographic evidence for the appearance of these themes.

This study uses two methodological approaches to consider artistic evi- dence of warfare and human sacrifice from the Anasazi Basketmaker period on the Colorado Plateau. The most common approach to interpreting prehis- toric cultures of the Southwest is to draw analogies to modern Pueblo cul- tures, assuming that a significant degree of continuity persists between these groups and their Anasazi predecessors (Smith 1990:109-130). An alternate approach not so commonly used in Southwestern studies, however, is a con- textual approach, in which Anasazi forms are analyzed in relation to other contemporaneous ancient American forms, the assumption being that to some degree, the Basketmakers shared certain social and political beliefs. This approach emphasizes structurally analogous similarities and provides a methodological crosscheck to the "historical analogy" approach, in effect re- 391</page><page sequence="2">392 FARMER ducing dependency on modern Pueblo models for interpretive information. The study of Anasazi warfare and sacrifice has generally focused on the Pueblo periods, dating from approximately the eighth through the sixteenth centuries, during which the greatest developments in Anasazi architecture and ceramics occurred (Ellis 1951; Haas 1990; Roberts 1996). Scholars such as Haas (1990) and Creamer (Haas and Creamer 1993) have investigated the evolution of warfare at the tribal level in the Southwest, in the Basketmaker III and Pueblo periods, but the Basketmaker II period remains problematic, since social organization at this level is generally ascribed to the pretribal or band level. Any Basketmaker warfare activities at this level probably oc- curred as "small-party" warfare, a designation coined by Beals (1933:16) to describe small-scale independently organized raiding parties seeking cap- tives. In considering the evidence for Basketmaker warfare in some detail, Haas and Creamer (1993) have argued that warfare strategies were key ele- ments in the development of Puebloan communities. Evidence for Basket- maker II warfare and human sacrifice has been more extensively considered by Wilcox and Haas (1994:230), particularly focusing on evidence of Basketmaker decapitation and atlatl weaponry. The authors suggest a rela- tionship to similar Fremont rock art imagery, and even the possibility of in- fluence from the Xipe Totec fertility cult of Mesoamerican origin (Wilcox and Haas 1994:230). The present study is in many ways an extension of their work. The Pueblo periods parallel the rise of major contemporary Meso- american cultures such as the Toltecs and Aztecs of central Mexico, but postdate just as significant, yet older, cultures throughout Middle and South America. The earlier Basketmaker II and III periods, however, also gener- ally parallel the development of major Classic period cultures throughout Mesoamerica, including Teotihuacan in central Mexico, the West Mexican shaft tomb cultures, the Zapotecs of southern Mexico, and the Maya of southeastern Mexico and Central America. This period also corresponds to major Early period Peruvian cultures such as Paracas, Mochica, and Nazca (Stone-Miller 1995:8). Analysis and comparison of Basketmaker imagery from rock art, basketry, figurines, and certain other Basketmaker remains suggest that a significant amount of human sacrifice, either in ritual form or as the result of armed hostile conflict, occurred during the Basketmaker pe- riod, and that much Basketmaker imagery can be understood in the context of similar depictions from other contemporary ancient American cultures. The Basketmaker period comprises Basketmaker II, circa 1500 B.C. to A.D. 400, and Basketmaker III, A.D. 400 to 700 (Lipe 1993:2). Rock art and woven objects, including large decorated baskets and trays, though different in style, occur in both periods, while certain other objects considered here from both burial and nonburial contexts date to the Basketmaker III period.</page><page sequence="3">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 393 Basketmaker II rock art is highly representational, the dominant motif being a static, fully frontal human figure frequently surrounded by other rec- ognizable objects. Basketmaker II rock art panels commonly contain a series of these repeated and sometimes paired anthropomorphs. In the most com- mon and widespread variety of this rock art style, termed "San Juan Anthro- pomorphic" by Schaafsma (1980:109), these anthropomorphs average three feet in height. San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures share many features; besides the static, nonnarrative quality of the figures, they generally lack fa- cial features, giving them a slightly anonymous appearance, though eyes are sometimes indicated. Some display elaborate hairdos or head ornaments, and body decoration or clothing. While hands and feet, including distinct fingers and toes, are usually indicated, they are rarely depicted in active gestures; they generally appear to hang limply from their respective limbs. Several recognizable objects, frequently also found in graves, are also depicted. Overall compositions are distinctly non-narrative in character, however; fig- ures and/or objects rarely overlap or interact. Of the objects depicted with the figures, two particular items are of the most interest here: trophy heads or scalps, and atlatl or spear-thrower darts. Actual examples of both items have been recovered from Basketmaker burials. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF BASKETMAKER WARFARE Archaeological evidence of warlike activities during the Basketmaker period has been posited for some time but, until recently, received little fo- cused attention or research. Recognition of warlike activities in the archaeo- logical record is problematic when supporting cultural or historic evidence is lacking. The Random House dictionary (1991:1501) has several definitions for war : 1. the process of military struggle between two nations or groups of nations. 2. armed conflict between two massed enemies, armies, or the like. 3. conflict, esp. when vicious and unrelenting, between competitors, political rivals, etc. McCauley (1990:1-2), following Carneiro and others, has offered a re- fined definition of warfare employed in the anthropological literature. The two major points of distinction between warfare and random acts of hostility are (1) clearly defined social group boundaries, producing intergroup con- flicts rather than random hostilities and (2) organized, socially sanctioned le- thal weapons. This anthropological definition of warfare is implicitly used in this study. Unfortunately, hostile, traumatic, and fatal encounters between individuals or groups may be the result of many causes such as accidents, feuds, or revenge, none of which are generally identified as warlike activi- ties, yet may be indistinguishable in a particular archaeological context.</page><page sequence="4">394 FARMER How a person died may be relatively easy to discern, but why he or she died is usually more difficult to determine. Warfare in the traditional Western sense generally presumes some political or economic incentive or is enacted under a particular social covenant, such as ethnic or religious sanction (much scholarship exists on this topic, though most modern considerations of war- fare theory are in some way a response to Clausewitz [1989]). Only when some clue exists as to either the social or historic context of the event, how- ever, can the context of warfare be confidently applied to archaeological re- mains exhibiting clear evidence of aggression. Without these contexts, inter- pretive reconstructions of archaeological materials and the prehistoric cultures that produced them are more susceptible to biases of the interpret- ers; if one does not believe that formalized warfare existed in a given cul- ture, then one will not be disposed to recognizing the aftermath of warfare in a given archaeological context. Such evidence may be explained in a variety of ways. A particularly prominent example of this problem is Classic Maya cul- ture. Since its first discovery and recognition by Western explorers early in the nineteenth century until the 1940s, the Classic Maya of the first millen- nium A.D. were believed to be dominated by peaceful, non-aggressive farm- ers and priests living in Arcadian harmony with each other and nature. This romantic image of the Maya persisted despite the existence of archaeologi- cal and ethnohistoric evidence to the contrary (Schele and Miller 1986:18- 32). Since the 1940s, however, several intellectual and archaeological devel- opments, including the decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphic writing system, reinterpretations of Maya iconography, and recent archaeological finds, have shown convincingly that warfare and related forms of human sacrifice were integral to Maya culture. Similar interpretive biases may also have affected previous scholarship regarding the Basketmaker Anasazi. Digging in Basketmaker graves from Grand Gulch, Utah in the 1890s, Richard Wetherill recovered desiccated bodies and skeletal remains with embedded dart points. Other bodies exhibited evidence of extreme mutila- tion, including massive gashes and lacerations running the length of the chest, and missing or severed limbs, heads, hands, and feet (similar to bodies later recovered by Morris at Canyon de Chelly; see below): One of these was a very old man, nearly six feet tall. He had been slashed, apparently with a stone knife, across the full width of his back and also across his lower abdomen. The ragged wound had been sewed up with cord of braided human hair an eighth of an inch thick, the stitches spaced roughly half an inch apart as rudely as one might mend a gunny sack. In the same grave were other grisly remains: a pair of feet and legs cut off at the knees, and with them a pair of hands and arms amputated at the elbows. The rest of the body was missing (McNitt 1966:68). While excavating Basketmaker sites in Canyon de Chelly, Arizona in</page><page sequence="5">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 395 the 1920s, Earl Morris (1925:263-299) uncovered both individual and mass burials of adults and children. He believed that the burials were the result of a massacre of a group of Basketmakers by an opposing hostile group. Bro- ken atlatl darts and embedded dart points were found among the bodies, along with clear indications (at least to Morris) of extreme physical trauma to the skeletons, such as crushed and broken skulls and bones. One passage from Morris (1939:19) is particularly noteworthy: While I have no confirmation of the use of bow and arrow by people of Basket Maker II, one find in Canyon del Muerto leaves no doubt that they were in contact or, better, in conflict with an arrow-using tribe. Opposite Antelope House there is a cave, one end of which is the most typical Basket Maker II site I know of in the entire canyon. There a massacre took place and the remains lay about until largely skeletonized before they were gathered and dumped into the jug-shaped cysts which riddle the floor. Among the many artifacts found with the dismembered skeletons there was only one definitely atypical specimen-a slender arrow foreshaft of wood embedded between the ribs and skin of the left side of an old woman. The stone tip had emerged just above the breast and been snapped off, leaving the slender straight stem in place in the foreshaft. Obvi- ously the bow was in use by whatever tribe the attacking party represented. Many individual burials excavated by Morris contained only partial or disarticulated skeletal remains consisting of isolated limbs, hands, feet, or heads, sometimes purposely arranged in the burial, and by his accounts, in- tentionally removed or severed at some point from the original complete body. One burial was described as The Burial of the Hands-On a bed of grass, side by side, with palms uppermost, lay the ligament-bound hands and forearms of an adult. The severed elbows touched the wall of the cyst, thus proving that the burial as it was found was complete . . . the rest of the body had never been included in the interment (Morris 1925:291). Most significant was the report by Kidder and Guernsey in 1919 of a full head scalp from a Basketmaker burial near present-day Kayenta in the Marsh Pass area of northern Arizona (Kidder and Guernsey 1919:109); more recent work by Howard and Janetski has added other evidence of scalp-tak- ing during the Basketmaker period (Howard and Janetski 1992:125-132). For the Wetherill-Grand Gulch Research Project, Hurst and Turner (1993) analyzed Basketmaker lithic and skeletal material from Cave 7 in southern Utah that they argue represents individuals who probably died of atlatl dart wounds, in addition to "showing evidence of bludgeoning, scalping, and possible torture" (Hurst and Turner 1993:169). Motsinger and Chenault (1995) have also revealed evidence of stockaded Basketmaker III sites from the Mesa Verde area, to which they tentatively assigned defensive purposes. BASKETMAKER DECAPITATION AND DISMEMBERMENT Cole (1984) has recognized formal similarities between the actual Basketmaker scalp recovered by Kidder and Guernsey and scalps depicted in San Juan Anthropomorphic style rock art from southern Utah, including the</page><page sequence="6">396 FARMER tLN Yk a. b. c. d. rC- 0 r t Figure 1.

By drawing analogies to modem Pueblo contexts and functions of similar trophy scalps, she suggests that the Basketmaker scalps symbolized or represented shamanic rituals associated with warfare activities (Cole 1984, 1985, 1989). It is important at this point to emphasize that this present study is primarily concerned not with the sig- nificance, either culturally or iconographically, of the act of decapitation it- self, but with the significance of the depiction of these acts in Basketmaker subject matter. Although it is possible that decapitation in some form pre- dates the early Anasazi period (there is no archaeological evidence for it), the significance lies in the fact that, apparently, pre-Anasazi artists did not depict decapitation or its results in their art. While I generally accept Cole s association of scalping with shamanic activity, certain distinctions between the Basketmaker examples and historic Pueblo scalping practices may influ- ence this interpretation. There are many references to Pueblo scalping practices in the ethno- graphic literature. However, they mention only vaguely actual decapitation or the taking of full-head trophy scalps such as the Kayenta specimen or those depicted in Basketmaker rock art (Parsons 1924). Furthermore, schol- ars have not clearly distinguished between full-head and partial scalps. How- ever, analogies to modem Pueblo scalping practices (and perhaps associated beliefs) may not be the most fruitful approach to understanding the signifi- cance of the full-head scalps to Basketmaker art, particularly since images of trophy heads were produced by cultures contemporaneous with the Basketmaker Anasazi, and archaeological evidence confirms the practice of ritual decapitation in many of these cultures. Artistic depictions of trophy heads and decapitation occur throughout the Precolumbian world prior to, and including, the Basketmaker period. What is perhaps just as significant about the Basketmaker scalp depictions is that their appearance is an abrupt artistic change from the previously dominant styles in the Four Corners area at approximately the same time as their initial appearance in several other prehistoric cultures. Depictions of headless human figures also occur in the San Juan Anthro- pomorphic style. One pictograph panel from the Green Mask site in Grand Gulch, Utah displays solid white San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures that at a later Basketmaker date were overpainted in red detail (Cole 1990:115). The red details emphasize or omit certain features in the original white figures, such as the omitted heads and different decoration of the tor- sos and limbs (Figure 2.a). In the same panel, additional figures were added in the same red pigment next to the original white, overpainted figures, yet again, without heads (Figure 2.b). These additional figures are depicted in outline contours rather than thin lines or solid areas of color. The absence of heads in these images may reflect a technical problem relating to either the</page><page sequence="9">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 399 ! iij) .rl1 d. e. f. Figure 2.

It is also possible, however, that the headless figures appear as the Basketmaker artists intended them to, as decapitated figures. Since pictographs would be extremely difficult to "erase," overpainting the figure without the head might serve the symboli- cally equivalent function of ritual decapitation or killing the figure. Related ideas concerning the symbolic alteration of rock art imagery and its some- times violent end have been addressed by Cole (1990:79-82), and many ex- amples of "killed" rock art images (as well as other prehistoric art forms) are clearly documented. Some San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures are missing hands or feet. One Green Mask figure displays a full-fingered right hand and a red stump for a missing left hand (Figure 2.b). At Painted Cave in northeastern Ari- zona, a similar green San Juan Anthropomorphic style figure displays red claw-like appendages for hands and feet (Figure 2.c). These appendages may represent items of clothing, or the figures may be fantastic depictions of either mythological creatures or shamans in a state of supernatural transfor- mation. However, given the highly representational nature of the San Juan Anthropomorphic style, I suggest that these images may also be read liter- ally as public records of victims with severed limbs graphically spurting blood, as they certainly would have in life, and reflecting the actual grave contents. A similar interpretation can be offered for other body decorations associ- ated with San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures. Cole (1984) suggested a similarity between a body exhumed from a burial in Grand Gulch, slashed vertically down the torso from neck to stomach, and the appearance of a ver- tical red streak of pigment down the torso of another white San Juan Anthro- pomorphic style figure from the Green Mask site (Figure 3.a). Other figures exhibiting similar zigzag slashing elements across the torsos occur through- out the San Juan Anthropomorphic style, including petroglyphs found along the San Juan River and pictographs from Canyon de Chelly (Figures 3.b-e). Clearly, this may entail a semiotic problem, since one might argue that the elements do not specifically depict body slashing, but merely body painting, or even types of costuming. Such interpretations cannot be categorically dis- counted, but the suggestion here is that the elements maintain a certain sym- bolic or semiotic consistency, whether one reads them as actual slashes, or as body decorations meant to symbolize such acts. Again, the similarity to actual disfigured Basketmaker corpses is compelling, and the interpretation corresponds well with the static, lifeless poses of the San Juan Anthropo- morphic style figures. The implication is that the figures may depict portrait- like images of the dead or their associated spirits.</page><page sequence="11">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 401 a. b. c. d.

Following Schaafsma's definitions (1980:121-122), the major rock art style for the Basketmaker III heartland previously dominated by the San Juan Anthropomorphic style is the Chinle Representational style, again centered on the area around Canyon de Chelly. Anthropomorphic figures in this style are smaller, and narrative scenes in- volving interactions between figures are more common than in the previous period. Trophy heads and paired atlatl darts disappear from the visual record, but other images suggest a continued reverence for this iconography. Figures holding or displaying atlatls and darts are depicted in Canyon de Chelly in an active fashion not seen in the Basketmaker II period (Grant 1978:Figure 4.45e). Besides variations in the rock art imagery, particular varieties of agave or yucca held great significance for the Basketmaker Anasazi. Beginning in Basketmaker II, the yucca was widely exploited for various utilitarian rea- sons (Gentry 1982:3-23). More important for this study, the yucca also may have carried significant symbolic and ritual associations. Petroglyph images of yuccas in fruit in conjunction with Basketmaker II San Juan Anthropo- morphic style figures are common near the confluence of Butler Wash and the San Juan River (Cole 1989:Figure 3b). In Basketmaker burials, a large woven yucca tray with a hole punched through the center was commonly placed below and over the body of the de- ceased (Morris 1925:295). During later Basketmaker III, these trays are decorated with both abstract and representational imagery (Figure 4). Three subjects are common: birds, butterflies, and a type of canine. Each subject served a double iconographic function throughout ancient America, refer- encing both the transformed spirits of the dead, and specific warrior cults. Butterflies were historically honored by the Tarahumara of northeastern Mexico as the spirit of dead warriors (Bennett and Zingg 1935:91-92), and specific butterfly-warrior cults existed throughout central Mexico and Gua- temala (Berlo 1983). Coyote warrior cults were also common in the central Mexican highlands at Teotihuacan (Berrin 1988:207-208). For the historic Pueblos, Coyote was symbolically associated with scalps, mist, rain, and the legendary cult hero Poseyemu, son of the Sun and one leader of the first people upon their emergence into the fourth world (Parmentier 1979:612). Poseyemu was the first great mediator or shaman between heaven and earth, and as such he symbolized several broad, interlocked Puebloan concepts of fertility, hunting, agriculture, warfare, and social integration. Each of these ideas may be reflected in Basketmaker iconography. As Coyote, his role as an intermediary is particularly appropriate to his depiction on war shields</page><page sequence="14">404 FARMER that doubled as burial coverings, both contexts emphasizing qualities of transformation. The trays themselves may also have served as shields, either practically or symbolically. This identification is supported by their general similarity to shields from later contexts (Wright 1976:4; Morris and Burgh 1941:Fig- ure 31). The Zuni attached several layers of symbolism to shields. On a more esoteric level, beyond being an implement of war, the shield was viewed as a metaphor for transformation, or more specifically as a symbolic portal for passage of the transformed spirit between two realms (Cushing 1896:383). When the shield was functioning, the portal was closed; when the shield was put away or damaged, the portal was open. The two realms equate conceptu- ally with such universal dualities as "nature" and "supernature," the material and spiritual, or (in the context of war) the living and the dead. Cushing (1896) reported accounts by Zuni informants of netted "cloud shields," shields spun from clouds and serving as magical transportation devices for the Twin War Gods between this world and the underworld. This in part might explain the symbolic significance of the punched holes in the tray bot- toms as permanent openings in the portal. Clay figurines associated with the Basketmaker period offer additional evidence of possible sacrificial uses for yucca. These figurines in general date to Basketmaker III, though no clear temporal boundaries are defined for their appearance in the Basketmaker area (Morss 1954:11-12). Earl Morris collected numerous examples from Basketmaker III caves in the Prayer Rock District in 1931 (Morris 1980:xiii), descriptions of which were subse- quently published by himself (Morris 1951) and Elizabeth Morris (1980: 141-142). These unfired clay figurines are predominantly female and prob- ably represent some form of fertility cult object, similar to clay figurines from other prehistoric American cultures (Morss 1954:32-37). Yucca thorns were commonly used as punches to decorate the Basket- maker figurines, and several examples survive in which the thorns were in- serted in the figurines at various evenly spaced "strategic" locations (Morris 1951:38; Morris 1980:89) (Figure 2.d). One example has thorns placed evenly across the body, while another head has thorns inserted over the en- tire face. Both Earl and Elizabeth Morris believed that this suggested the "intriguing possibility of witchcraft" or "black magic" (Morris 1980:89; Morris 1951:33,39). At least one figurine was also encased in juniper bark and yucca strips or fiber (Morris 1951:35). These figurines, covered with dozens of yucca "holes," appear similar to San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures covered with red dots (cf. Figures 2.a &amp; c), suggesting a possible symbolic association of these dots with blood. Ritual use of yucca, including its thorns, is documented for the historic Pueblos as well. At Zuni, young male society initiates were ritually whipped</page><page sequence="15">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 405 and rubbed with the yucca's thorny leaves, causing extremely painful lacera- tions and wounds (Stevenson 1904:557,570-575; Tedlock 1992:53). The re- sults of this ritual are strikingly reminiscent of the embedded yucca thorns in the Basketmaker figurines, and, by extension, the red dotted torsos of the San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures from Green Mask and Painted Cave. As part of this initiation ritual, Stevenson (1904:557) reports that After the yucca is laid away the elder brother Bow priest takes a bear s foot skin from the altar, and drawing it over his right hand he rushes toward his brother warrior and, holding him closely, runs the claws up and down his body. A San Juan Anthropomorphic style figure from Canyon de Chelly (Fig- ure 3c) described by Grant (1978:164-165) as having "very large hands and feet" may depict just this type of ritual performer donning similar bear claw mittens and footwear; again, I would suggest that this figure can be viewed as a literal depiction of a participant in a similar ceremony related to the ritual use of yucca and Warrior societies. This image is doubly compelling, however, because the mock bear at- tack described by Stevenson implies that the clawing motion of the bear mit- tens "up and down his body" carries significant symbolic import. Perhaps the accompanied whipping by yucca leaves and the subsequent skin abra- sions functioned as metaphorical substitutions for the wounds one might in- cur from an actual bear clawing. The "up and down" motion of bear claws over the entire body in an actual bear attack could easily resemble the slashed Basketmaker body discussed by Cole in relation to the Green Mask San Juan Anthropomorphic figure (Figure 3.a), as could the use of bear claw mittens. By extension, then, the San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures with zigzag lines on the torso and neck might represent the symbolic after- math of such an attack, iconographically linking these particular San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures to Grant' s "bear-claw" figure from Canyon de Chelly as early references to Warrior society initiation rituals. Stevenson (1904:557) further reports that initiates decorated their bodies with zigzag lines. The San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures with the zigzag lines about their torsos (Figure 3) may simultaneously symbolize ritual perform- ers, initiates, and actual victims, again linking warriors and sacrifice in early Basketmaker art and suggesting an ancestral relationship to modern rituals. Yucca leaves, and related yucca products such as soap, were traditional components of scalp dances and ceremonies. Scalps obtained by war parties were presented to women referred to as "aunts" for care and safekeeping in rituals. Such rituals involved whipping young warrior initiates with yucca leaves and washing both the initiates and the scalps with yucca soap (Stevenson 1894:122, 1904:557). To the Basketmaker Anasazi, yucca was highly valuable as a utilitarian item, and probably equally so as a ritual item. The thorn-encrusted Basket-</page><page sequence="16">406 FARMER maker figurines may reflect a form of autosacrificial iconography, probably associated with fertility and initiation rituals, and perhaps ancestral to his- torically documented instances of Pueblo ritual uses for the yucca. Formal similarities of the clay figurines to certain San Juan Anthropomorphic style figures imply a similar descriptive purpose for the rock art images as well. This suggests equal reverence for the yucca as a vital spiritual source and a potent sacrificial device. It should be noted, however, that the initia- tion rituals described for the historic Pueblos were restricted to young men, whereas the Basketmaker figurines and San Juan Anthropomorphic figures covered with dots or holes are generally female, so this particular analogy is not without certain weaknesses. ATLATL WARRIORS Humans are not the only subjects depicted in the Basketmaker II San Juan Anthropomorphic style. Atlatls, or more commonly paired atlatl darts, are frequently depicted, and actual atlatls were common grave offerings (Grant 1978:30; Amsden 1949:66-67) (Figures 5.a &amp; b). The atlatl in the Americas dates to at least the early Archaic period, some 10,000 years ago (Coe 1994:22), but its appearance in Anasazi art is sudden. Like decapita- tion, it is the appearance of the atlatl as a subject in Basketmaker art that is most significant. The question, then, is why were depictions of atlatls and darts deemed significant to the Basketmakers? One possible answer is that atlatls and atlatl darts also appear at this time in imagery from other prehis- toric American cultures (Figure 5), along with images and remains of sacri- ficed or mutilated figures. A comparison of Basketmaker imagery to earlier and contemporary im- agery of non-Anasazi cultures throughout ancient America offers support for the suggested warfare/sacrifice depictions. Without the ethnographic evi- dence, such a comparison might easily be dismissed as superficial, fortu- itous, or not indicative, but combined with the ethnographic and archaeo- logical evidence presented above, a comparison of Basketmaker imagery in context with that of their neighbors becomes more compelling. The sugges- tion of any similarities between Basketmaker art and the art of their Middle or South American counterparts implies some sharing of influences or ideas. Such a comparison opens the broader debate over the general relationship between the early Anasazi and other prehistoric cultures, a debate that ranges well beyond the scope of this study. A substantial amount of scholar- ship has considered this question, generally in the form of American South- west-Mesoamerican interactions, and most commonly between later post- A.D. 700 Pueblo cultures and their southern contemporaries (Ericson and Baugh 1993; Frisbie 1983). Within this study, such a comparison is intended merely to emphasize two less ambitious, though perhaps just as significant</page><page sequence="17">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 407 b. c. d. a.

In fact, a key as- pect of this second point is the argument, presented below, that the major parallels between Basketmaker art and that of their contemporaries are gen- erally iconographic, rather than formal or stylistic. Following generally held arguments by Kubler (1970) and Panofsky (1960) that form and meaning frequently disjoin and are not inextricably linked, the basic working premise here is that any overt formal or stylistic similarities would indicate some type of direct influence or interaction; general iconographic similarities re- flect only a possible sharing of broadly held symbolic meanings. The ab- sence of strict formal similarities between Basketmaker and other non-Ana- sazi art forms supports the position that the Basketmakers were not directly influencing nor being directly influenced by their neighbors, but instead per- haps participating in a more broadly defined belief system that only mini- mally affected the formal integrity of Southwest culture. Thompson (1994: 95) takes a similar approach in his study of Mimbres iconography, stating the idea as "tangible expressions of widely held concepts reflecting shared ideology, rather than as continuity in art styles or examples of direct diffu- sion." Young (1994:108) echoes this sentiment when comparing historically documented Aztec, Hopi, and Zuni deities: [W]e must look towards the less easily quantifiable and less tangible areas of cosmology and world-view to begin to formulate an idea of the extent of Mesoamerican ideological influence on ancestral western Puebloan cosmology.... From such a perspective, historic, ethnographic, and archaeological models have only limited value for interpreting Basketmaker art, for several reasons. The time between late Basketmaker III (around A.D. 700) and the first documented modern Puebloan practices is nearly 1,000 years. Kubler (1970) and Panofsky (1960) have argued that such a distance weakens the value of ethnographic or historic comparisons, presuming a certain degree of inherent change in both form and meaning of even the most conservative of styles. Given Kim and Smiley's extended Basketmaker II chronology, re- ported by Lipe (1993) to be approximately 2,000 years, ethnographic models in the Southwest are particularly suspect, since many features of Basket- maker style and culture were subsequently abandoned by later Anasazi and Pueblo groups. Of particular note are the replacement of the atlatl with the bow-and-arrow after A.D. 700, the gradual de-emphasis or abandonment of</page><page sequence="19">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 409 pictographic rock art styles in favor of petroglyphs or later mural painting, changes in Anasazi burial practices, and relatively poor historic documenta- tion of warfare and related activities during Spanish colonization. Further- more, assuming a degree of continuity from Basketmaker to present Pueb- loan cultures, at least four major recognizable cultural upheavals have punc- tuated the Anasazi-Pueblo sequence since the Basketmaker period: the shift to true Puebloan lifeways around A.D. 700; the abandonment of the Four Corners area by A.D. 1300; Spanish contact and colonization after 1540; and the modern Euro-American influences since the mid-nineteenth century. Each of these factors weakens the validity of the ethnographic model. Coupled with the problems previously addressed in the archaeological evidence, I suggest that an alternate interpretative model for Basketmaker art, specifically a comparison of Basketmaker imagery with other contempo- rary pan-American cultures, offers at the very least some degree of method- ological cross-checking against the ethnographic and archaeological evi- dence. A CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TO BASKETMAKER ICONOGRAPHY The following discussion considers a general sampling of related Pre- columbian images. It is not intended to be a thorough or comprehensive pre- sentation of all ancient American depictions of the images under consider- ation. The earliest artistic records of decapitation in ancient America come from the Peruvian Andes and possibly the late Formative or Preclassic Olmec of southern Mexico. As early as 1500 B.C., Chorrera style ceramic vessels from coastal Ecuador exhibit evidence of human decapitation (Di Capua 1978). At Sechin Alto, a pre-Chavin site dating between 1700 and 500 B.c., dismembered figures, body parts, and decapitated heads appear prominently in stone reliefs along the exterior wall of Cerro Sechin (Samaniego et al. 1985:178-186; Stone-Miller 1995:26-27) (Figure 1.b). The public context is particularly reminiscent of the San Juan Anthropomorphic style examples. Several subsequent Andean cultures, chronologically con- temporary or overlapping with each other and the Basketmaker period, com- monly included trophy heads as iconographic elements. Paracas burial shrouds from approximately A.D. 100 depict both humans and supernatural beings carrying trophy heads (Stone-Miller 1995:54; Meggers 1972:81) (Figures 1.c &amp; d). On Nazca ceramics, warriors display trophy heads sus- pended from their attire or held in their hands (Meggers 1972:80), and tro- phy heads can also appear as isolated motifs (Stone-Miller 1995:70-71; Hadingham 1987:167-171) (Figure 1.f). In a fashion strikingly reminiscent of Basketmaker burial remains, Mochica vessels depict disarticulated body</page><page sequence="20">410 FARMER parts, including decapitated heads, of sacrificial prisoners (Figures 1.e &amp; o). According to Donnan (1976:117-129), the Mochica performed elaborate bloodletting rituals on their prisoners, piercing them repeatedly to collect their blood in sacred vessels. Cordy-Collins (1992:206-220) has identified a particular Mochica supernatural figure as the "Decapitator" because of its common association with trophy heads, and similar trophy heads appear in contemporary La Tolita style ceramic vessels from Ecuador (Figure 1.g). Moser (1973) has thoroughly reviewed decapitation imagery in ancient Mesoamerican cultures. Generally contemporary with the Andean Chavin culture, the Olmecs of southern Veracruz and Tabasco, Mexico exhibit the earliest Mesoamerican images of decapitation, though some Olmec imagery can only tentatively be identified as such. Perhaps the most famous of Olmec sculpture is the series of large basaltic boulders carved into Olmec portrait heads, some over six feet tall. The identity and purpose of these images are still uncertain, but one possible interpretation is that they are decapitated heads (Moser 1973:9; Coe 1994:69-70). At the site of La Venta, other Olmec images that more clearly reflect de- capitations and trophy heads are more certainly dated to approximately 500 B.C. (Moser 1973:9; Coe 1994:9). This is generally contemporaneous with the Basketmaker II period, and some of these late Olmec images are notably similar to Basketmaker imagery. La Venta Stela 3 depicts two Olmec digni- taries or rulers (Figure 1.h). The right figure clearly displays a trophy head described by Moser (1973:9) as "suspended by the hair or by a cord through the top of the head that loops over a circular neck collar." The description of the cord is strikingly reminiscent of the description provided for the Kayenta scalp and associated Basketmaker rock art images. At the site of Izapa in southern Mexico, a late Formative site exhibiting Olmec stylistic influences, decapitation is graphically depicted in scenes on carved stelae (Figure 1.i). Norman (1976:213) has argued that many Izapa scenes illustrate episodes from the Maya legend of creation, the Popol Vuh, in which decapitation figures prominently in the exploits of the legendary Maya Hero Twins. In defeating the Lords of the Underworld, the Maya Hero Twins perform mock decapitations and dismemberments of themselves to entertain the Underworld Lords. The Lords demand that the same trick be performed on them, but the Hero Twins do not resurrect them after their dis- memberment, thus causing their defeat and the salvation of the Hero Twins (and by analogy the Maya race). This episode from Maya mythology reflects the dual function of sacrifice and bloodletting as symbols of death and re- birth (Tedlock 1985:153-155; Girard 1979:176-201). In later Maya culture, ritual decapitation is symbolically justified through its association with events in the Popol Vuh (Schele and Miller 1986:241-264). A structurally similar justification for decapitation can be detected in modern Pueblo my-</page><page sequence="21">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 411 thology as well. White (1935:191) recounts a Keresan tale from Santo Domingo pueblo in which the Twin War gods Masewi and Oyoyewi must decapitate a young trickster maiden to preserve their supernatural powers. Trophy heads were prominent parts of Maya royal costumes. The Leiden plaque, a jade celt dating to A.D. 320, depicts a Maya ruler with tro- phy heads suspended from his belt (Figure 1.k), and trophy heads continue to appear in later Maya costume (Schele and Miller 1986:121). On Lintel 24 from the Maya site of Yaxchilan, a Maya lord wears a similar trophy atop his own head (Schele and Miller 1986:187) (Figure 1.1). Ceramic figurines asso- ciated with the shaft tomb cultures of west Mexico also begin displaying acts of decapitation at this time (Figure 1.j). Warfare iconography, including atlatl-bearing warriors and specific acts of decapitation, appears to be par- ticularly prominent in the figurines of Jalisco and Nayarit (Kan et al. 1989:42). Farther inland, institutionalized warfare, complete with public dis- play of mutilated sacrificed prisoners, appears between B.c. 700 and 500 in Oaxaca (Marcus and Flannery 1996:121-130). The Zapotecs of Monte Alban depicted sexually mutilated prisoners in carved relief panels erected along the walls of their earliest public architecture. These panels, labeled "Danzantes," include images of dead and disfigured captives, probably sym- bolizing neighboring villages captured by the Zapotec elite of Monte Albin (Marcus and Flannery 1996:152-153). Trophy heads are also a primary ele- ment of Zapotec glyphs denoting military conquests of neighboring villages (Moser 1973:9-12) (Figure 1.n). The Danzante panels date between 500 and 100 B.C., whereas the glyphs are dated slightly later, around A.D. 100-200, both contemporaneous with Basketmaker II. Decapitation is also a central iconographic feature of the god Xipe Totec, a central Mexican god of fertil- ity represented in contemporary Teotihuacan and Zapotec ceramics and later Aztec art (Figure 1.m). Xipe Totec is occasionally depicted holding a staff in one hand and a trophy head in the other, similar to the images from Paracas textiles, the Mochica Decapitator, and Nazca ceramics. Trophy heads are noticeably lacking in contemporary Teotihuacan art of central Mexico, but ritual forms of decapitation were apparently practiced by the Teotihuacanos, as evidenced by several features at the site. Sanchez (1993:109-115) reports mass burials with disarticulated skeletons and skulls that provide clear evidence of sacrificial practices involving decapitation at Teotihuacan as early as A.D. 200. In the same publication, Castro (1993:101- 107) provides significant evidence of human sacrifice, including ritual de- capitation, from the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (or Quetzalcoatl) asso- ciated with temple dedication rituals. The inclusion of actual dogs in Basketmaker burials (Guernsey and Kid- der 1921:44-45) underscores their dual symbolic role as escorts for the dead through the underworld, and as the constant companion of hunters and war-</page><page sequence="22">412 FARMER riors, a belief shared throughout ancient America (Amsden 1949:62-65; Coe 1994:52,58; Alva and Donnan 1993:134). Both actual and ceramic dogs were also included in burials from Teotihuacan and west Mexico (Sanchez 1993:112; Kan et al. 1989), and the Mochica often depicted dogs as compan- ions to warriors and hunters in scenes on funerary ceramics; the dog was a key iconographic element of the Moche Sacrifice Ceremony discussed be- low (Alva and Donnan 1993:133). The bird images on Basketmaker yucca trays recall similar birds depicted as independent figures, heads, or head- dresses in Chinle Representational style rock art (Figure 2.e). Besides the commonly shared shamanic belief in birds as transformed spirits, similar bird headdresses were a frequent component of military uniforms in Teotihuacan, Maya, and other Mesoamerican imagery (Schele and Freidel 1990:146) (Figure 2.a). The use of yucca or agave thorns as sacred bloodletting paraphernalia was common in the central Mexican Highlands. Sahagun documented sev- eral sixteenth-century Aztec ritual functions for the maguey species of the agave, a type of cactus similar in appearance, form, and utility to the south- west yucca, actually a type of lily not directly related to the agave (Gentry 1982:10). Young Aztec boys were frequently disciplined by being pricked repeatedly about the body with numerous agave thorns, and thongs or straps made of agave leaves were used to restrain captured runaway slaves. Maguey thorns and boughs of pine needles covered in blood were offered to the gods in Aztec fertility rituals (Leon-Portilla 1958:55), and blood-coated maguey thorns were inserted into piles of grass placed in significant loca- tions around fields and surrounding countryside (Leon-Portilla, personal communication 1983). At Teotihuacan 1,000 years earlier, fresco murals contemporary with Basketmaker II and III depict similar scenes of costumed priests sprinkling sacred liquids on fields or sacred bundles that have neatly trimmed rows of maguey leaves inserted in them (Berrin 1988:195). Yaxchilan Lintel 24 again provides a graphic seventh century Maya depic- tion of maguey thorns used in a blood-letting ritual. The wife of the Maya lord draws a cord embedded with thorns through her tongue, to later be burned as a ritual offering (Schele and Miller 1986:186-187). Possibly the earliest depictions of the atlatl anywhere in ancient America appear in Lower Pecos River rock art of west Texas (Shafer 1986). Dominated by large polychrome anthropomorphic figures, the Lower Pecos River style is more securely dated to approximately 2,000 B.C. (Shafer 1986:153, 168-169). Lower Pecos River style anthropomorphs clearly dis- play atlatls and figures punctured by atlatl arrows (Shafer 1986:146-147), suggesting the existence of hostilities. Lower Pecos River culture appears relatively isolated in time and place; the other major cultures developing at a similar advanced rate at this time and within reasonable geographic proxim-</page><page sequence="23">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 413 ity (though still at relatively great distances) are the Olmec of southern Mexico, the Poverty Point culture of the Mississippi River valley (Shaffer 1992:28-37), and possibly some Formative cultures of the Andes (Stone- Miller 1995:18-22). Since none of these cultures exhibit any identifiable cul- tural or artistic ties to Lower Pecos River style, the relationship, if any, be- tween Lower Pecos River culture, its contemporaries, and the later Anasazi is undetermined and archaeologically problematic. The Olmec occasionally represented the atlatl in their art, but it does not appear to have been a common subject. An Olmec miniature carved jade atlatl, probably used for commemorative or symbolic purposes, is known from the Puebla valley of central Mexico (Dumbarton Oaks 1963:8), but the iconographic significance of the atlatl to the Olmec appears to have been small. The mass burials and sacrificial victims excavated at Teotihuacan and reported by Castro (1993:101) date to approximately A.D. 200, roughly con- temporaneous with the earliest appearance of atlatl warriors in Teotihuacan art (Berrin 1988:127-132) (Figure 5.c). Nayarit figurines from west Mexican shaft tombs depict similar atlatl warriors (Kan et al. 1989:80) (Figure 5.f), and atlatls may also be depicted in Izapa reliefs (Norman 1976:80-82) (Fig- ure 5.e). In Peru, the atlatl appears in Paracas textiles by A.D. 100 (Figure 5.j), and more frequently in scenes with Mochica and Nazca warriors, along with dismembered captives and trophy heads, around A.D. 200 (Donnan 1976:46- 55) (Figures 5.h &amp; i). These appear to be the earliest depictions of the atlatl in South American art. Actual atlatl hooks of carved shell and stone appear in contemporary Ecuador during the Regional Developmental period, ap- proximately 500 B.c. (Meggers 1966:68), and atlatl-bearing warriors are de- picted during the Jama-Coaque phase of the Integration period between A.D. 200 and 500 (Di Capua 1978) (Figure 5.g). Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions reveal a succinct record of atlatl warfare and related iconography introduced into the Maya area, probably from Teotihuacan, sometime in the fourth century A.D. In A.D. 378, the Maya city- state of Tikal defeated its rival Uaxactun in a bloody conflict (Schele and Freidel 1990:145-153). A major reason for Tikal's victory was its adoption of some innovative warfare techniques derived primarily from Teotihuacan, including formalized atlatl warfare. Prominent iconographic features of this complex included a distinctive balloon headdress, bird headdresses, shields, obsidian flaked clubs, and the atlatl (Schele and Freidel 1990:146) (Figure 5.d). Stela 5 from Uaxactun depicts the victorious Tikal ruler in full battle dress, including a prominently displayed atlatl (Figure 2.f). Maya inscriptions may provide the only absolutely datable examples of a much wider iconographic phenomenon going on throughout much of an- cient America between about 300 B.C. and A.D. 500; the general spread and</page><page sequence="24">414 FARMER influence of an iconographic complex associated with atlatl warfare and hu- man sacrifice. Teotihuacan-inspired warfare iconography in the Maya area was accompanied by specific sacrificial rituals performed in conjunction with the various cycles ofVenus (Schele and Miller 1986:214). In Maya cos- mology, Venus was intimately linked with warfare iconography, and a simi- lar association apparently once existed in the Southwest. The mythological Twin War Gods of many Pueblos were symbolically associated with Venus, particularly as Morning Star (Parsons 1926:4-5; Parsons 1929:265; Parsons 1939:937), the aspect of Venus to which the Maya rituals were also most closely linked. Given Teotihuacan's prominence as the largest and single most influen- tial urban center of the Mesoamerican Classic period, one should expect to find evidence of formal or stylistic influences from Teotihuacan in other contemporary non-Maya areas, but this does not appear to be the case for the Southwest. Indeed, the distinctiveness of Basketmaker style in fact supports the view that Basketmaker culture was not so directly influenced by Teoti- huacan culture. However, the iconographic parallels with Basketmaker art seem too strong to ascribe them to mere coincidence; display of sacrificial figures, atlatls and darts, and trophy heads or scalps suggest, at the very least, the possibility of some form of atlatl warrior cults in Basketmaker so- ciety, iconographically related to, if not directly tied to, other contemporary Middle and South American cultures. REINTERPRETING BASKETMAKER ICONOGRAPHY Evidence of warfare and human sacrifice in Basketmaker society is based primarily on iconographic interpretations of the artistic record, since little if any formal or stylistic similarities exist with other contemporary cul- tures or later Anasazi-Pueblo models. Depictions in such prominent public contexts as rock art or such revered private contexts as burial items suggest that these activities occurred in social circumstances beyond mere occa- sional interpersonal hostilities. Any particular form of Basketmaker warfare cults or societies is not clearly defined archaeologically, though certainly it was not as formally organized as the Aztec or later Pueblo warrior cults. The problem is compounded by the relative difficulty of clearly identifying war- fare activities in the archaeological record, and, in the case of the Anasazi, the immediately succeeding early Pueblo periods are marked by a distinct lack of figurative imagery, obscuring still further any specific warfare refer- ences. The intent of this study is not to suggest that previous interpretations of Basketmaker imagery are erroneous or in need of revision; suggestions by Schaafsma, Cole, Grant, and others of shamanic influence probably hold true for many Basketmaker scenes. However, Basketmaker art was certainly capable of reflecting a variety of themes and subjects about Basketmaker</page><page sequence="25">Basketmaker Warfare and Human Sacrifice 415 Table 1.

Indeed, this study argues that at least in certain cases, some Basketmaker images served a more specifically political and social purpose beyond the general ideological realm. Tables 1 and 2 summarize data for de- pictions of atlatls and trophy heads. Following the temporal divisions, the groupings in these tables imply that a significant increase in trophy head and atlatl imagery appears in a majority of cultures between 100 B.c. and 400 A.D., corresponding to the end of Basketmaker II. It is possible that the iconographic roots of modern Pueblo rituals exist in early Basketmaker art, since Cole (1994:289-311) has presented evidence for numerous continuities from Basketmaker to later Pueblo rock art imag- ery. Similar analogies between Basketmaker imagery, other ancient Ameri- can traditions, and historic Pueblo rituals suggest that the social and political contexts for artistic depictions relating specifically to warfare and human sacrifice were more significant for the Basketmaker Anasazi than have been considered previously.
