<plain_text><page sequence="1">AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE C. J. Herington lHE STARTING-POINT OF THIS article1 is a fact which now seems to me almost certain: that Aeschylus' Suppliants-tetralogy, Oresteia, and Prometheia?in that order?form a compact group of works at the very end of the poet's career. I accept (as I think most people now do) the impli cation of the papyrus-hypothesis that the Suppliants-tetralogy must date from 466 h.c. or later, perhaps 4632. It has always been known, beyond doubt, that the Oresteia was produced in Spring 458. And lastly I am convinced by a number of arguments of varying type, produced over the last fifty years, that the Pro metheia must have been written after the Oresteia if it was written by Aeschylus at all (which I firmly believe).3 The Prometheus must in that case belong to the last two years of Aeschylus' life: between 458 and his death in Sicily, 456/5. These darings mean that we still have, in whole or part, a very high proportion of the tetralogies that Aeschylus actually com posed in his last ten years, or perhaps even in his last seven. It could be that they represent all the tetralogies which he composed in this time; but even if that is not so, there is hardly space for more than one other tetralogy in the period, or two at the outside. Now my belief is that they are not merely chronologically a compact group, but that they are so artistically as well. Even more: that in these last three surviving works Aeschylus created a new art-form, something that differs in kind from any work that was staged under the name of tragedy, either his own or anybody else's, before or after that final decade of his life. A consequence of this will be that the three surviving examples of what I think of as a unique art-form can be used, more than is generally recognized, to explain each other; and that, in par ticular, the Prometheus begins to make more sense than it did. That, in outline, is the position whose meaning and conse quences are to be discussed in this paper. But I feel it necessary, first, to step right back and ask a question of method. There seem to be some artists whose works gain little or nothing in meaning through being dated at a specific point in the maker's life, and grouped with the other works of the same period. This sort of artist engineers internally-consistent structures that are independ ent of himself: the fa?ade is raised, is checked for symmetry and mechanical stress in all directions?and the little architect steps</page><page sequence="2">388 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE from behind it with a wave of the hand and wanders off any where, leaving behind him a thing made. With such work (I think, heretically perhaps, of the plays of Sophocles and the odes of Horace) dating and grouping seem to be largely antiquarian labor. But there exists another sort of artist, whose work, and whose relationship to the work, are altogether different. Not long ago a large exhibition of Picasso's works toured the northern parts of America, showing some of us (at least) for the first time a really representative selection of his paintings and drawings, in chronological order. The first impression of an innocent observer, after walking through the galleries from one end to the other, was: an exhibition by seven or eight different men, practising seven or eight different arts. What it actually was, of course, was an exhibition by an individual who many times, under the stress of a new technical idea or of something he had seen in the world, ruthlessly and abruptly threw overboard his previous achieve ment, and tried again. That drawing of a rampant Minotaur in Room VII really did not have a lot to do with that painting of a serene woman's face under a broad-brimmed hat in Room I. Each, in its own way, gave proof of a treasury of skill and experience. But the woman breathed the air and the style of Paris in the early nineteen-hundreds, the Minotaur had crept out of the labyrinth of the Spanish Civil War. Fully to come to grips with the monster, you had to realize that he was only a study, a fragment of a greater experience; you had to move to the canvases on the wall around him and even, in imagination, to Spain and to the war itself. Now although the point is not mathematically provable, I believe that most people who have spent any reasonable time on Aeschylus will have felt that they are having to do with this second sort of artist. As a citizen and as a poet he lives in an age of crisis. Classical society?or, if you like, modern society?is being born out of archaism. Correspondingly, tragedy is being born out of song. We cannot at any stage of Aeschylus' life say that tragedy is; we can only say that it is becoming. Aeschylus' thought, and the technique to match his thought, are dynamic and evolutionary, receptive always to what is new. Such a poet as that might begin his career with a two-dimensional imagination like a Persian carpet,4 close-woven with archaic centaurs, hippocamps and horsecocks; he might end it with a mind fixed on the profound space that is opened by the coming of philosophy. If that was in fact so, then the grouping of the plays by date would be an unavoidable stage towards understanding. On these assumptions I again turn to the main position: that the Suppliants-tetralogy, the Oresteia, and the Prometheia (to which I shall refer from now on as "the late group," for short) were composed in that order during Aeschylus' last ten or seven years, and that they represent most, if not all, of a phase in the</page><page sequence="3">C. J. Herington 389 tragic art which is sharply set off from anything discernible before or after. The first step must be to survey the tragedies which lie on either side of the late group, chronologically speaking. Before 466 R.c. Aeschylus had already been composing for well over thirty years?a good working lifetime in itself. During that time the only two fixed dates and fixed points, so far as present knowl edge goes, are the production of the Persians in 472, and that of the Seven Against Thebes in 467. Now, wildly different as these two tragedies are, thematically and musically, they yet imply the same cosmic background, and the same view of the human situa tion and human destiny. The cosmos here is?by comparison with what is to come in the late group?almost a comfortable one; in the sense that, however grim it is, however frightful the choices to be made within it, at least the roots of things remain the same. The archaic powers, both those in heaven and those below the earth reign each unquestioned in their own spheres; in the Seven, infernal Furies and Olympian Apollo conspire towards the down fall of the house of Oedipus.5 And in this universe the laws, though harsh, are not blind, nor purely deterministic. Catastrophe, when it comes, is doubly motivated: something said or done in the past (an oracle, a family curse) preordains it externally, but it is only triggered off by something internal, something in the man himself. The two types of motivation are not, indeed, equally stressed in each play. In the Persians the disaster due to Xerxes' pride is already known when the ghost of Darius suddenly produces an oracle (otherwise unrecorded, either in history or in the actual play) which has foretold the downfall of the Persian army (Persians, 739-44, 801); conversely, in the Seven, it is the inner rage of Eteocles?long ago destined to destruction by the Curse?that is held back from the audience until comparatively late (653 ff. ). But in both plays the dual motivation of catastrophe is there for all to see. I would stress that it is not, of course, just a superficial matter of plot-mechanics; it involves, in itself, a subtle and not yet quite disproved view of human nature and destiny. So much for the two tragedies that survive from the period before the Aeschylean late group. Paradoxically, but I believe truly, it must now be observed that their closest relatives, in some important respects, are to be found not in that late group, but in the earlier surviving plays of Sophocles: the Ajax, the Antigone, and the Oedipus Tyrannus, which were produced within the twenty years or so following Aeschylus' death. For those three Sophoclean plays fundamentally imply for dramatic purposes the same cosmos, and are constructed round the same double motiva tion, as the Persians and the Seven. In saying this, of course, I am not forgetting the great differences between the plays, and be tween the poets; each play has its individual soul, as it were, which at the moment I am not trying to approach. But behind</page><page sequence="4">390 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE all the differences I seem to see the same frame of reference, within which the drama is built. That is true, also, of yet another tragedy written down in the same period as the earlier Sophoclean plays, probably in the forties of the fifth century: the prose tragedy of Croesus, King of Lydia, which stands at the opening of Herodotus' History.6 Here, in fact, the two motivations which converge towards the downfall of the hero are emphasized almost too clearly?the oracle which foredooms the end of Gyges' dynasty in the fifth generation (I. 13, 91), and the recklessness which springs from within Croesus himself. So far as our evidence goes, then (and there seems just enough of it to exclude the possibility that we are being deluded by the accidents of preservation), tragic writing both before and in the generation after the Aeschylean late group, for all its variety in detail, moves against the background of the same universe. If there is any rift in that universe, it is between man and the unseen powers; whose laws he may challenge or misread, just as he may misread his own nature. In any of those events he, the individual, is due for destruction; but the universe itself remains as it was before, static, undivided. I repeat that the variety of movement against that cosmic background is immense, even to judge from the extant plays. And we should certainly have some shocks if the sands were to open up and yield some of the more eccentric lost tragedies of which the fragments now allow us only glimpses ?Jason and the Argonauts rolling drunk on the stage in Aeschylus' Kabeiroi; the sword doubling back against the invulnerable flesh when the Aeschylean Ajax tries to commit suicide;7 or the Aeschylean Priam literally weighing Hector's body in the scales against gold.8 But there is nothing in the fragments to indicate that such plays, too, did not move within the frame of this unified, archaic universe. It will at once be clear that the Aeschylean late group? SwppZianfs-tetralogy, Oresteia, Prometheia?will not fit into that frame at all; that from this point of view it forms a completely separate enclave in the known history of Greek tragedy before c. 440 b.c., or rather of all Greek tragedy. But, although that is to my mind the most striking of the features that link the three works together, I do not think it is the only one, either in detail or on the grand scale. Of the many others, there are four which seem to be of special significance: the technique of trilogy composition; the involvement of Gods in human feuds; the comic (in the technical sense of Old Comic) element; and the intrusion of contemporary philosophical speculation. I shall look at these in turn, with just one remark by way of preface. Throughout this article, but especially here, I am obliged to pass over many con troversies and doubts as to points of detail, simply in order to keep the outlines clear at all. But I hope that this is not for lack of</page><page sequence="5">C. /. Herington 391 careful consideration, both of the basic evidence and of much of the controversy about it. Probably the most striking feature is the first of those men tioned: the technique of putting together a tragic trilogy. The Aeschylean late group shows an odd, unbalanced relationship between the three plays which constitute the trilogy on the one hand, and the traditional myth which contributes its subject matter on the other. The complete Oresteia is the simplest ex ample. Its trilogie form can be symbolized as A, A, B: two re sponding plays to begin with and the third wild, non-responding. The Agamemnon and Choephori not only respond to each other in movement?murder and counter-murder?but they are also grouped together by the fact that the basic story in both, and even the characters, are in conformity with the traditional myth already known (in outline at least) a century before Aeschylus, and in part known to Homer too. (Again I should emphasize that I am not trying to touch the soul of these plays, nor forgetting that Aeschylus slants the traditional story in ways all his own. Here I am trying to view the grand overall movement, as if through the eyes of the designer as he makes his first outline, sketch-block on knee. ) But the third member of the Oresteia, the Eumenides, has a totally different character and movement from the first two; and all the evidence which we have so far, both internal and external, suggests that its plot was freely invented by Aeschylus ad hoc, to resolve the issues raised, through the me dium of the traditional story, in the first two plays. The only traditional legendary element visible in the Eumenides is, prob ably, the purification of Orestes at Delphi?and my own reading of the play suggests that even this element is not so much re-used by Aeschylus as perverted. Instead of a proof of Apollo's ultimate healing and reconciling power (as which it was surely intended by its inventors) it has become, in the context of this play, a proof of Apollo's inefficacy; instead of a pious and harmonious finale to Orestes-story it now serves merely as a horrific proagon, in which the two parties to the coming cosmic agon are first alternately paraded and then confronted. The same curious principle of trilogie composition seems to have applied in the remaining two trilogies of the late group. Appallingly fragmentary as the Suppliants-trilogy and the Pro metheia now are, there are still more solid reasons than one might think for this belief. To take the Prometheia: the basic story here, that Prometheus was bound by Zeus and later released by Her akles, is standard in Greek mythical accounts from Hesiod (The ogony 52Iff.) until the end of the ancient world (and beyond the end). But there is no such universal agreement as to what happened after the release. Hesiod says nothing on the point, and if we look to the many later ancient versions of the Prometheus story we find the wildest diversity. Now Aeschylus' Prometheus</page><page sequence="6">392 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE Bound and Prometheus Unbound, for all their deliberate re handling and censoring of Hesiod's story, were fundamentally based on that story, and presupposed a knowledge of it in their audience. In fact, we know enough of the two of them to be sure that between them they covered approximately the same legend ary area as the Hesiodic version, the boundary being drawn between the two antithetic parts: the binding and the releasing (compare the murder and counter-murder in the Agamemnon and Choephori). It is a necessary inference from these facts that the third play of the trilogy?which I believe, in common with the majority of those who have considered the problem, to have once existed, and to have been entitled the Prometheus Pyrphoros ?abandoned Hesiod entirely. And it is a likely inference, since no important pre-Aeschylean source for the Prometheus story other than Hesiod is known, that it must have contained a freely in vented synthesis of the antithesis set up in the first two plays. Finally, the evidence about the earliest of the Aeschylean late group, the Suppliants-trilogy, strongly suggests the same pattern. All versions of the legend of the Danaid girls, at all dates, agree on the basic story: the escape of the girls and their father from Egypt to Argos, chased by their cousins; their eventual unwilling marriage; and those 49 murders on the wedding-night. But there is no fixed tradition at all as to what happened after that night; thenceforward there are as many versions as there are tellers.9 What is known of Aeschylus' Suppliants-trilogy suggests, beyond reasonable doubt, that the first two of its plays, the Suppliants and the Aigyptioi, between them contained the two responding movements that are found in the universal tradition?the enforced flight, the enforced union. The third and last play of the trilogy, the Danaides, evidently opened10 with the discovery of the mas sacre in the wedding-chamber, on the dawn after the wedding. But the most important fragment from this play ( 125 Mette; one of the most famous passages of Aeschylean poetry in its own right) indicates that it, too, subsequently ran wild, like the Eumenides and the Prometheus Pyrphoros. The speaker is the goddess Aphrodite herself, who has, it must be noticed, no busi ness in any other recorded d?nouement of the Danaid legend. And she is speaking, not about the human sexual relationship, with which the earlier two plays of the trilogy were concerned, but about the love which unites the Earth and Sky in the spring rains: "Now the pure Heaven yearns to pierce the Earth; now Earth is taken with longing for her marriage. The rains showering from the mating Sky fill her with life, and she gives birth, for man, to flocks of sheep and to the lifegiving wheat. And from that liquid exultation springs, perfect, the time of trees. In this I share."</page><page sequence="7">C. J. Herington 393 It seems certain from these lines that a deity has materialized in person on the stage in the Danaides, presumably to take one side or the other in the human feud. And it further seems likely from their mutilated context (preserved on a papyrus11) that Aphn&gt; dite's speech dealt at length with the question of the relationship between male and female right across the cosmos, including vegetable and animal fertility as well as the primal marriage be tween Earth and sky. This development, of course, would closely associate the ending of the Suppliants-trilogy with that of the Oresteia; where we can still observe in detail how one of the human motifs of the Agamemnon and Choephori, the relative roles of man and woman, is raised to cosmic importance in the Eumenides. In the latter play, as we all know, the male Olympian powers are ranged on one side, the female pre-Olympians on the other; holding the balance is the sexually ambiguous figure, Athena (daughter who has no mother, earth-deity and Olympian deity, woman in hoplite-armor) ; and an issue that becomes of increasing importance as the play marches to its climax is the fertility of Athenian crops, cattle and women. To summarize: the principle of trilogie composition that ap pears to obtain in the Aeschylean late group means that the first two members of a trilogy follow the outline of the traditional legend and have responding movement, while the third is largely free invention, designed to synthesize the antitheses set up in the former two. It is useless to look for such a principle of com position in anything that was written after Aeschylus' death, be cause of course the practice of composing connected trilogies was then almost entirely abandoned (there are only three re corded instances later than 456 B.C., and no details survive of these). But we do possess one example of a connected trilogy from immediately before Aeschylus' late group, the Theban tril ogy of 467 B.C., and the comparison is startling. Here there sur vives only the last of the three plays, the Seven Against Thebes, but the titles of the two plays that stood before in the trilogy, the Laius and the Oedipus, are known, and are revealing enough for the contents. The third member of this trilogy?which, as already mentioned, is played out against the background of a still un divided archaic cosmos?comes to its grim end in accordance with the universal legendary tradition, with the annihilation of the princely brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, at each others' hands. In the Seven there seems to be very little rehandling of the basic legend, except to make it slightly more ghastly than the versions known to Pindar earlier and Herodotus later by causing the princes to die without issue. Here the Gods do not materialize on the stage; they do not take sides in the human feud, nor are their relationships in any way affected by it; far from being divided, they join hands to bring about the disaster on the mortal plane. In fact, in the Theban trilogy Aeschylus retains</page><page sequence="8">394 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE both the archaic cosmos and the archaic story, dramatizing the saga right to the end. A word should be said here about the tetralogies of Aeschylus that are represented only by fragments, and by no surviving plays. Not one can be precisely dated, but the vast majority must cer tainly belong to the thirty-year period before the late group; as we have seen, there is simply not room for more than a minute fraction of them in the years from 466 onwards. What little can be seen of these lost works?and it must be admitted that it is little?implies the trilogie technique of the Theban trilogy rather than that of the late group; dramatization, that is, of the ancient saga to the end, not free invention and synthesis in the third play. This is almost certainly true of one of the most deplorable losses from ancient poetry as a whole, Aeschylus' trilogy on Achil les;12 the final tragedy in that, the "Phrygians or Ransoming of Hector" followed the outlines, at least, of the twenty-fourth book of the Iliad. And the trilogies on Ajax and on Odysseus respect tively, though no-one would dare to speak dogmatically about their contents, would seem to suit a straight treatment of the heroic saga, rather than the A, A, B movement of the late group. Trilogy-technique, then, is one major feature which certainly links together the three works of the late group, and at the same time sets them sharply off from the immediately preceding The ban trilogy, if not perhaps also (though this is obviously far more speculative) from some other earlier trilogies. A second such feature has already entered this argument, and I need not add much to it here: this is the involvement of the Gods as partisans in the issues of the trilogy, and the concomitant split, not just on the human level, but in the cosmos itself. This happened very probably in the last play of the Suppliants-trilogy (we recall the speech of Aphrodite), and certainly at the end of the Oresteia. The Prometheia evidently contains this same feature, but gives an amazing twist to the pattern; for here the trilogy opens in stantly with the involvement of the Gods and the cosmic split, and the humans, except the semi-human Io and (in the Unbound) Herakles, are kept off the stage altogether, at least in the first two plays. There is a distinct possibility, however, that the humans came back in the third play, the Pyrphoros; many en quirers have guessed, and with some sound reasons, that this play may have culminated in the founding of the Athenian torch-races in honor of Prometheus. If that is so, there will have been in the Prometheia a sort of inversion of the process seen in the Sup pliants-trilogy and the Oresteia (where the problem climbed up through the human level to the divine), but the strong family resemblance is still there. A third feature common to the late group must be stated at this time with dogmatic brevity;13 it is the appearance in these trilogies of the forms and techniques of Old Comedy?an art</page><page sequence="9">C. /. Herington 395 which became a respectable form only in the last twenty years of Aeschylus' life. If I am right in my belief that the whole struc ture of the Eumenides is largely explainable in the light of the Old Comic convention, and that there are distinct traces of the same convention in the Suppliants and Prometheus, then this is at least further proof that Aeschylus' art was receptive, even in his comparatively advanced old age, to what was new: to what was new outside tragedy, as well as within it. But there is one likeness to Old Comedy (at least as we know it from Ari stophanes' earlier plays thirty years later) that goes deeper than mere formal considerations. I think we are all agreed, unless we are theorists of the medieval school, that a play need not end in physical catastrophe in order to merit the name of 'tragedy.' And yet what other Athenian plays, outside the Oresteia, end in posi tive outbursts of joy, in a triumphal torch-procession, and with benedictions on the land for the fertility of its crops and its women? Practically the whole of the final song of the Eumenides consists in such benedictions, with the loud refrain 'Rejoice,' Xaiperel (xat/3 T ,) xaiP?T &amp; aurtpiaiai ttXovtov. XatpcT aori/co? Aew?, . . . "Rejoice, rejoice in your just shares of wealth! People of the city, rejoice!" (Eum. 996f.). XCtt/ocrc, xaLP T S avOis, hrv) 8?7rAo??&lt;D, 7ravT ? &lt;h Kara itt?Xw, . . "Rejoice, again rejoice, our cry redoubles: all who in the city live!" (Eum. 1014f.). In fact, that sort of benediction is only heard once elsewhere in Aeschylus, in the Suppliants of all plays (625ff.); while for dramatic finales which contain such benedictions, and a torchlight procession, and the redoubled cry 'Rejoice!', we have to turn to a comedian, Aristophanes. The end of the Peace, for instance, combines all three ( 1317ff. ) : "We must carry torches . . . and pray the Gods to give wealth to the Greeks, and that we may all alike raise much barley and much wine, and eat figs, and that our women may bear us children..." And then, in the final words of the Peace (1355ff.) : &amp; XatV T Xa'/? T &amp;v~ Spec, ko?v ?jweTrrjcrOe pot 7rXaK0vvras cSeaOe. "Rejoice, rejoice, people, and if you follow me you'll have cakes to eat!" The Oresteia, I think beyond doubt, ended in what the spec tators could at once see was the manner of Old Comedy?though of course transposed into a nobler key. In estimating what this means we must not forget that Comedy, down till near the end of the fifth century, was much closer to its origins in actual</page><page sequence="10">396 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE popular religious cult than Athenian tragedy was at any stage where we have knowledge of it. Paradoxically, to the conservative religious or pious spectator, an Old Comedy was probably a more serious act than tragedy itself; in that not only by its origins, but by its costumes and the very form of many of its jokes, it con cerned the most ancient and urgent of human needs?the repro duction of crops, of animals, and of the race itself. Aeschylus, it seems to me, so modelled the end of the Oresteia that it would appeal to that primeval religious feeling too, besides appealing to the more modern type of mentality among his audience; to the old tribal consciousness as well as to the New Learning in that hectically changing community which was the Athens of his last years. It would be a bold man?certainly a bolder man than I am ?who flatly asserted that the finales of the Suppliants-trilogy and of the Prometheia must have shared the Old Comic character of the Eumenides. Yet three considerations certainly point strongly in that direction. First, few who consider the extant material will doubt that those two trilogies must have ended in harmony, in a synthesis of the antitheses expounded in their first two plays. Second, the great Danaides fragment, quoted and discussed above, shows that the last play of the Suppliants-trilogy moved into the same ambit?fertility?as the Eumenides does; a subject which otherwise is the province of comedy, not tragedy. Third, one notes with great interest the theory already mentioned, that the Prometheus Pyrphoros culminated with the founding of the Promethean torch-races. Torchlight at the end of the play, with its symbolism of triumph and marriage, would again link the Prometheia to the Oresteia, and at the same time distinguish the pair of them from any other Attic drama whatsoever except Old Comedy; where torches appear towards the end more commonly than not, and in which three of the eleven extant finales actually consist of torchlight processions. The last characteristic feature of the late group which I am going to speak of can be dealt with more briefly because the individual facts involved have long been recognized. There is a number of passages in the plays of Aeschylus which are so close to doctrines known to have been under discussion by contem porary pre-Socratic philosophers that mere coincidence seems ruled out. What is not so early recognized, but is (I believe) true, is that all the reasonably certain instances of this sort of allusion are found in the plays of the late group.14 They are not specially obtrusive in their dramatic contexts, but if one reflects on them as a whole they add up to a certainty: that in his last years Aeschylus was, at least, aware of the philosophical movements that were gathering in strength across the Greek world (especi ally in Sicily, which Aeschylus knew well in the last two decades of his life, and where, in fact, he died)?a rising hurricane which,</page><page sequence="11">C. /. Herington 397 by the end of the following generation, was to have swept away the structure of archaic thought and religion. How much does that awareness have to do with the new shape and new tend encies of the late trilogies? Are the late trilogies a sort of re sponse by an enquiring, but still essentially religious late-archaic mind, to the coming of philosophy? The answer to that may become clearer a little later. Mean while, to sum up on what has been said so far, I suggested at the beginning of this paper, first, that these three trilogies stood close together chronologically. That belief was reached in the first in stance from external and technical considerations, but I hope that what has been said since may reinforce it; thematically too, and compositionally, they seem to belong together. Second, I sug gested that they were in fact so different from anything called "tragedy" before or after them that they practically constitute an art-form of their own, a very short-lived art-form that flourished, at the outside, for a decade, and was never revived. One of the trilogies concerned does not even begin like a conventional trag edy; the stock complaint, and a well-justified complaint, about the Suppliants is that it is not "tragic." And while the Oresteia may seem to begin like tragedy of the older type?the Agamemnon in many ways reads like a maturer draft of the Persians15?it is, taken as a whole, almost a denial of tragedy. To seek a name for the new form would be pointless; "tragicomedy," which might have served, is already in use for something quite different. But one may look for a parallel to it, and I do not think it too fanciful to find that parallel centuries later and in a sphere far from Athens: in Dante's Comedy. Dante, by the way, would have called the Oresteia too a "comedy" without hesitation, if we can trust the views put forward about his own work in the letter to Can Grande: a principio horribilis et f?tida quia Infernus; in fine prospera, desiderabilis et grata, quia Paradisus . . . et sic patet quare comedia dicitur.16 But perhaps it is better not to quibble over names; I see more than a superficial likeness between the things, between Dante's Hell, Purgatory and Paradise and Aeschy lus' Agamemnon, Choephori and Eumenides. In both the tripartite works there is a similar movement, a gradual climb from torment, through testing, into the fight. Indeed, if Headlam's and Thom son's ideas about the Orphic symbolism of the Oresteia are anything like correct, there is not only a likeness but?at a vast distance?a historical connection. For there exists a certain under ground current of mystical belief which flows for ever, calmly ignoring frontiers and religions. But to come back to that troubled decade, 466-456 B.C. Another of the suggestions made at the beginning of this paper was that once these three trilogies were firmly grasped as being a unique group, produced within a short period under a single</page><page sequence="12">398 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE impulse, they would throw considerable light on each other, and especially on the Prometheus. It will be worth while to end by outlining the way in which the grouping might help towards the understanding of that most problematic of all the characters in Aeschylus: Zeus. The great argument here for the last century or more has been, of course, that the tyrant-Zeus of the Prometheus will not fit?that he is irreconcilable with the sublime Zeus known elsewhere in Aeschylus' work. Does he really not fit? The question is worth reconsidering. Through the series Suppliants-trilogy, Oresteia, Prometheia, I trace two new and even more urgent preoccupations, which I believe, must explain each other. A preoccupation with the split in the cosmos; and a preoccupation with the possibility that Zeus may emerge from the chaos as the ultimate authority, Travamo?, iravepyeras, all-responsible, all-worker (to quote the Chorus of the Agamemnon, 1486). I think we need have little hesitation about the significance of the cosmic split in these late trilogies. When archaic man runs head-on into classical free enquiry, when a tra dition of static authoritarianism in politics and religion finally comes face to face with classical democracy (and it happens that the emergence of full-blown democracy, both in Athens and in Sicily, coincides very closely with the last ten years of Aeschylus' life)?when these confrontations occur all at once, the world will in fact seem to split; from the microcosm of the mind, through the state, to the divine macrocosm itself. It is almost a matter of indifference at which of those levels you think of the cleavage. Though Aeschylus (characteristically) chooses in these plays to show it primarily in its aspect of cosmic cleavage, one might think that the struggle in the Eumenides makes almost equal sense if you take it as the struggle between the Olympian ego and the infernal id, or, more prosaically, as that between liberal and conservative. Certainly, for our time as well as for that of Aeschylus, it seems to mean more than a momentary disturbance among fading pagan gods. It is a deadly feud from which not one of us is free. Aeschylus, it is true, did not have so gloomy an opinion, for in these same plays, as a possible healer of the cleavage, stands Zeus. Lately an assault has been launched against the idea, so popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, that Aeschylus was the founder of a new and sublime Zeus-monotheism, and it has been held instead that all the difficulties can be swept away by assuming that his Zeus is quite primitive (that is the word used) throughout; no more developed than the Zeus of the epic poets.17 I am coming to wonder whether this assault does not go too far and simplify too much. It has done valuable work by questioning some hardened prejudices. But even apart from the difficult question of its method (the rigidly positivist interpreta</page><page sequence="13">C. /. Herington 399 tion of Aeschylus' language gives me pause, because poets of all people, almost by definition, do not and cannot use words posi tivistically), do its results perfectly fit the phenomena? There is, indeed, a primitive Aeschylean Zeus, no advance on the Zeus of Homer and Hesiod (or, come to that, on the woman and boy-chasing Zeus who appears on early fifth-century vase paintings), but I suspect that he belongs to the dramas of the phases earlier than 466 B.C. This is the Zeus who is cursorily mentioned, with no special emphasis, in the Persians and the Seven; perhaps the fully anthropomorphic Zeus who was actually brought on the stage?on the only occasion we know of in fifth century Attic tragedy?in Aeschylus' Psychostasia; certainly the Zeus who mated with a cow-formed Europa in the play called Kares ? Europe, and who is roundly abused by Danae (whom he has seduced in the golden rain) in the satyric Diktyoulkoi (lines 774-84). But Aeschylus certainly knows of at least one other Zeus, who has nothing to do with Homer or Hesiod, or any writer earlier than his own day: the Zeus of that stupendous couplet from the lost Heliades (The Daughters of the Sun): "Zeus is Aither, Zeus is earth, Zeus is heaven; Zeus is all, and whatever is beyond the all."? Zev? (ttiv ai&amp;rip, Ze?? Se yrj, Ze?? 8 ovpav?s, Zcv? rot r? navra x&lt;wt? r?vfc viriprtpov. (Fragment 70 Nauck, 105 Mette.) The dramatic context of these words is unknown, and the play to which they belong is undated. But even as they stand, even if the play should be rediscovered and it should prove that they were qualified or denied in the next line, they surely constitute complete proof that the poet's mind was at least open to more than the epic and archaic view about Zeus. For a brief and shat tering moment they let us glimpse a universe in which the ortho dox polytheism and anthropomorphism simply cannot exist?in that respect strikingly similar to the universe implied in the writ ings of Aeschylus' senior contemporary Xenophanes (whom, so far as dates and known movements go, he could quite well have met at the court of Hieron in Sicily). If, to Aeschylus, the concept "Zeus" was as malleable as the Heliades fragment suggests, there now seems nothing to forbid the conjecture that in these last three trilogies we see a series of experiments, not only with the idea of a cosmic split, but with the idea of Zeus as the possible answer to the new and chaotic condition of heaven and earth. The experiments will be open minded and honest, though there will underlie them a basic faith, inherited from archaism, in the simple power of the archaic su preme god. In the process of the experiments, Zeus will gradually and naturally move nearer to the centre. The same critic who has assaulted the concept of a sublime Aeschylean Zeus has also objected to the idea (likewise popular in the nineteenth and</page><page sequence="14">400 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE earlier twentieth centuries) of an "evolving" Zeus, which is often brought in to solve our problems. I think he is justified, and I have learned from him not to believe in an evolving Zeus, either. But I do believe, as the whole of this paper has suggested, in an evolving Aeschylus. From that point of view I take a final look at the late group of trilogies. The Suppliants was always famed for its majestic and moving Zeus-hymns.18 And even in the days, not so long ago, when the play was commonly dated in the 490's or 480's B.C., they were customarily compared with the equally splendid Zeus-hymn of Agamemnon 160-183, Zev'?, bans iror ko-riv,. . . ("Zeus, whoever he may be . . .")?without anyone's feeling much embarrassment, apparently, about the almost total absence of such august lan guage from what would then have to be the intervening plays, the Persians and the Seven. Now that the Suppliants seems to be brought down within perhaps as little as five years of the Aga memnon, that difficulty, at least, vanishes. But what is still per haps not enough noticed is that in both these trilogies the Zeus hymns occur fairly early in the first play, and are placed, of course, in the mouth of the chorus. One would naturally incline to take them within rather than outside their dramatic context: as intuitive hopes by the helpless girls and the old men respec tively, rather than, at that stage, as definite statements by the poet. And in fact, in the Oresteia we have to wait very long in deed before that intuitive hope is justified. Not only does unnatu ral murder have to be done, but the universe has to be parted in two, with Apollo and the Furies (and behind them, offstage, Zeus and the Fates respectively) as opposing partisans. And dur ing the middle section of the Eumenides we are to have visions of a universe from which all authority has gone, leaving only that mindless and pitiless chaos across which Euripides, later on, was to move consciously all his life. (But that was after the philosophic revolution was complete.) It is only at the very end of the Oresteia that the gash is healed, and the original intuitions ful filled; but it has been touch and go. We cannot know about Zeus's part in the later stages of the Suppliants-trilogy, for obvious rea sons. The immense importance, however, that is attached to him in the extant play, suggests that he must have been heavily in volved at the end also. And the Danaides-fragment makes it almost certain that the cosmic cleavage was there. In almost every way, even down to minor technical and metri cal details, the Prometheia takes a stride beyond the Oresteia. Here the trilogy begins on the cosmic level, instead of rising to it from humanity, and begins with a total cleavage on that level. And here Zeus, instead of being kept on the periphery of the actual struggle?instead of being the remote object of human hopes?has moved into the eye of the storm. If there was to be anything beyond the Oresteia, it probably had to be this. The</page><page sequence="15">C. /. Herington 401 two preoccupations, with the cosmic split and with Zeus, fuse into one, and the last question is being asked: can the archaic god survive as a viable force in the new world? We only see, now, one side of the debate, not the response. But this much seems likely. In the Prometheus Bound Aeschylus fearlessly and honestly shows, through the eyes of Io and Prometheus, a picture of the archaic power-god which is not really too exaggerated a caricature of the Zeus known to Homer and Hesiod, except that it has taken on political overtones. It apparently includes even Zeus the se ducer, the Zeus of the Europe and Diktyoulkoi, here shown at his worst with Io. There are hints, however, both in the proph ecies of the Bound and in the fragments of the Unbound itself, that in that second play a different aspect of Zeus began to be uncovered: the Zeus who freed the Titans, who at least did not prevent the coming of Prometheus' savior Herakles, who?almost unbelievably?pitied,19 and who in the end came to terms with the intellectual, the aoffrivrfc, Prometheus.20 Anything said about the final synthesis in the last play of the Prometheia is bound to be a guess, but here is one. Those who have claimed that the Zeus of the Prometheia is irreconcilable with the Zeus of Aeschylus' other works have always pointed to the great Zeus-hymns near the beginning of the Suppliants and the Agamemnon, and the absence of anything of the sort in the Prometheia. The guess is that when the Day of Judgment comes and all vanished Greek literature is unrolled before us, we shall find that missing Zeus-hymn?in the finale of the last play of the Prometheia, the Pyrphoros. And that it will be a hymn of joy.21 NOTES 1 Originally given as a lecture at the University of Texas, and here printed substantially as it was delivered. Its main purpose was to ex plore on a larger scale some ideas about the development of Aeschylus' art which the author briefly put forward in the introduction to an article on Aeschylus and Old Comedy: TAPhA 94 ( 1963) 113ff. 2 A convenient publication, translation and discussion of this papyrus is that by H. Lloyd-Jones in his Appendix to H. W. Smyth's Aeschylus, Volume II (secondedition, 1957), 595f. 3 This controversial subject is much too large to be treated here. The writer hopes to discuss it in detail at a later date; for some?but only some?of the strong metrical and stylistic arguments for placing the Prometheia later than the Oresteia, he would refer provisionally to the works cited in CR 14 (1964) 239f. Some?but again only some?the matic and compositional arguments that lead to the same result will emerge later in this article. 4 Compare Aristophanes, Frogs 938. 5 This point is well made by F. Solmsen in TAPhA 68 (1937) 204.</page><page sequence="16">402 AESCHYLUS: THE LAST PHASE 6 Herodotus I, chapters 6-91, passim. If Professor D. Page is right, this Herodotean story will have been based itself on an early fifth century tragedy or group of tragedies by an older contemporary of Aeschylus; see A New Chapter in the History of Greek Tragedy ( Cam bridge 1951), with some startling evidence in support, TCPhS no. 186 (NS 8; 1962). In that case we should have the record of three tragic works, earlier than the Aeschylean late group, which presupposed the undivided cosmos discussed here. But it is right to add that Page's theory, excellently argued as it is, still faces certain difficulties, and does not yet seem to be generally accepted. 7 Aeschylus, Threissai, Fragment 292 in Mette's collection of the fragments. 8 Aeschylus, Phryges e Hektoros Lytra, Fragment 254 in Mette. 9 The ancient versions of the Danaid story are surveyed, for example, by J. V?rtheim, in Aischylos* Schutzfiehende (Amsterdam 1928) lOff. 10 Evidence: Fragment 124 in Mette (43 Nauck, Murray). Although the exact reading of this fragment is in dispute, its general drift and reference seem fairly certain. 11 Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Volume 20 ( 1952), 21f.; reprinted by Mette as Fragment 125. The tiny fragments of the nineteen lines which preceded those translated in my text here contain one, possibly two, references to cattle (lines 2, 6); and perhaps references to the mating of cattle (line 2, as restored by Mette) and to parturition (line 7). 12 It probably consisted of the tragedies Myrmidones, Nereides and Phryges e Hektoros Lytra; see Mette's collection of the fragments, pp. 70-92. 13 For the detailed arguments (as I see them) I refer to the article mentioned above, in the first note. Some new considerations are added here. 14 Summarily: ( 1 ) Suppliants 556ff. implies a theory of the risings of the Nile otherwise attributed to Aeschylus' younger contemporary Anaxagoras (Anaxagoras, Fragment A42; cf. J. V?rtheim, Aischylos' Schutzflehende, 79ff.). (2) Danaides, Fragment 125 Mette, seems closely related to passages in Empedocles (Empedocles, Fragments B71-73; cf. Phoenix 17 [1963], 195n.). (3) Apollo's "biology" in Eumenides 658ff. abruptly introduces almost the sole Athenian refer ence to a problem known to have been under discussion by six non Athenian philosophers and medical men in the middle years of the fifth century (evidence collected by A. Perretti in Parola del Passato 11 [1956] 241ff.). (4) Prometheus 88ff. (allusion to the Four Elements, and perhaps to Empedoclean minking? Compare, e.g., Phoenix 17 [1963], 180ff.). (5) Prometheus, 459f., on the excellence of arithmetic (evidently a Pythagorean notion; cf. G. Thomson, note on lines 475f. in his edition of the play ). 15 Noticed at least as early as 1663 by Stanley (quoted by E.
