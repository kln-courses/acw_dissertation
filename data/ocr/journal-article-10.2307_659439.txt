The editors aim to make the journal a medium of communication between students of all branches of Anthropology. Its contents embrace (i) high-grade papers pertaining to all parts of the domain of Anthro- pology, the technical papers being limited in number and length; (2) briefer contributions on anthropologic subjects, including discussion and correspondence; (3) reviews of anthropologic literature; (4) comments on periodical literature; and (5) minor notes and news. The Editorial Board have undertaken, individually and collectively, to carry out the purpose of the journal and to render it representative of the Science of Anthropology, and especially of Anthropology in America. The journal is conducted under the auspices of the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, and it is the organ also of the ANTHRO- POLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON and of the AMERICAN ETHNOLOG- ICAL SOCIETY Of New York. The Committee on Publication earnestly invite the co-peration of all students of Anthropology. Although contributions submitted for publi- cation are reviewed, so far as possible, by members of the Committee, the contributors of accepted articles are alone responsible for opinions expressed. The purpose of the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST is to disseminate as widely as practicable, for the use of scholars and students, the results of anthropologic investigations. In cases in which the material from the ANTHROPOLOGIST can be utilized to advantage in connection with an- thropologic work, the Committee will be prepared, unless there may be special reasons to the contrary, to give permission for the use of such material. All contributions to the magazine and all correspondence of an editorial nature should be addressed to the Editor, Dr JOHN R. SWANTON, Smith- sonian Institution,Washington, D. C. Correspondence pertaining to subscriptions should be addressed to Mr B. TALBOT B. HYDE, Treasurer of the American Anthropological Association, Ir Broadway, New York City, N.

CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.- Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly oblige this department of the American Anthropologist and the Journal of American Folk-Lore by sending directly to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Ameghino (F.) Origen poligenico del lenguaje. (Arch. de Pedag., La Plata, 1911, IX, 133-192, IO fgs.) Discusses the comparative anatomy of the speech-organs, the evolution of the apophysis geni, vocal or pre- human language, semi-articulate lan- guage, consonants, etc. According to A., " the babbling of infants repre- sents perfectly the human stage im- mediately preceding the beginning of the faculty of articulate language"; the language of " the precursors of man " was exclusively vocal or pre- human; that of the first represen'ta- tives of the human race was "semi- articulate," due to the absence of the apophysis geniglossa. Thus the course of the development of speech has been: Aphonic (lower creatures), emotive (animals), vocal (pre- human), semi-articulate (first men), articulate (man). For A., languages represent species and dialects varieties of them; there are species, genera, families, orders. Monosyllabic lan- guages have preceded polysyllabic, and Chinese is "one of the most primitive tongues." This is a post- humous publication. Anderson (J. H.) An investigation as to the most accurate method of esti- mating the cubic capacity of the liv- ing head, together with some remarks on the relative thickness of the cra- nial integuments. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 191o, XL, 264-278.) Gives re- sults of measurements of skulls of 40 subjects from the Melbourne hospitals and asylums. Technique is discussed in some detail. Dr A. concludes that circumferential measurements are less preferable than diametral; Lee's for- mula No. 14 is better than Pelletier's diametral method; water is best to use to determine cubic capacity of skull. The correct allowance for cra- nial tissues seems to be: for length 9 mm., for breadth 9 mm., for height 7 mm. Bibliography of 33 titles. - The proportionate contents of the skull as demonstrated from an ex- amination of forty Caucasian crania. (Ibid., 279-284.) Same 40 subjects as above. Details of brain measure- ments. Author concludes that brain- volume probably decreases with ad- vancing age; variation in brain- volume is compensated by an inverse variation in the amount of cerebro- spinal fluid present; the dura mater does not increase in proportionate volume with increasing age, nor with size of skull, but remains constant, with a volume of from about 4.5 to 5.5 %. Angelotti (G.) Sui solchi dell' arteria meningea media nell' endocranio. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 1910, xv, 392-395, 4 fgs.) Discusses the sulci of the median meningeal artery in the endocranium-normal, abnormal, primate skulls were ex- amined. Dr A. concludes that there exists a relationship between the de- velopment of the osseous skull and that of the endocranic arterial circu- lation. Anthony (R.) A propos de l'enseigne- 625</page><page sequence="5">626 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 13, 1911 ment de l'anatomie g l'acole d'anthro- pologie. (Rev. Anthrop., Paris, 19II, xxI, 45-55.) Sketches the history qf the teaching of anatomy at the Pcole d'Anthropologie in Paris (Broca, Manouvrier, Marey) and discusses the scope and divisions of the science. Anthropology at the British Associa- tion. (Man, 1911, XI, 154-160, 171- 176.) Abstracts of chief papers on physical anthropology, ethnography and ethnology, and archeology pre- sented at meeting of 19II. Arrhenius (S.) Uber den Ursprung des Gestirnkultus. (Scientia, Bolo- gna, 19II, IX, No. 2, 420-434.) Treats of the origin and development of star- worship among primitive peoples, the ancient Babylonians, Mexicans, etc. Among the lower races the moon (with its phases) is often more note- worthy than the sun, and the latter is frequently subordinate to the for- mer in mythology, etc. The secondary place of the sun in Babylon is also remarkable. Star-worship arose out of the need of measuring time, etc. Astley (H. J. D.) Cup- and ring- markings: their origin and signifi- cance. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., I911, XLI, 83-IOo.) After discussing briefly various theories A. considers cup- and ring-markings " in the light which has been thrown upon them by recent research among the aborigines of Australia," and concludes that they are "totemistic signs," belong- ing with "the special totemistic de- signs of the Arunta, both on the rock- paintings, the Churinga Ilkinia, and the Churinga Nanja." In the Arunta phenomena we have "the germs of the Lingam cult." The signification of cup- and ring-markings is to be found in "the still existent habits and customs of the Arunta, etc." Autobiography of Dr Chas. H. S. Davis. (Amer. Antiq., Benton Harb., Mich., 191I, XXXIII, I-5, portr.) Sketch of life and works of associate editor of the American Antiquarian. Baglioni (S.) Contributo alla cono- scenza della musica naturale. Ricer- che di analysi acustica su alcuni stru- menti di popoli naturali. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 191o, xv, 313-360, 23 fgs.) Gives the re- sults of acoustic investigations of the musical instruments of primitive peoples: Marimba (4 from various parts of Africa); sansa (9 from the Congo country and Central and East Africa); syringe or pan-pipe (6 from various parts of Melanesia, 2 from Africa, and I from the metis and negroes of the Amazon, in Brazil). The chief facts noted are: Oscilla- tions within wide limits; more or less strong alterations of the diverse inter- vals; existence of a large number of consonant intervals (all our four); tendency to approximate insensibly to the diatonic (heptatonic) scale; possibility of having contemporane- ously cases of tetratonic, pentatonic, and semicromatic gammas. Accord- ing to B., the fundamental principle determining and conditioning the genesis and development of our dia- tonic scale is essentially of a biolog- ical character. The progress of cul- ture has induced a better selection and a more exact determination of the 7 elementary tones constituting the diatonic scale. Barnard-James (J.) Nature's night lights. (Oxf. and Cambr. Rev., Lond., 1911, No. 14, III-119.) Con- tains some folk-lore items concerning the will-o'-the-wisp from Argentina and Ireland (legend, p. II6). On p. II3 the author states that Argentine girls on summer evenings put a fire- fly or two under the lace of their mantillas. Beddoe (J.) Sir Francis Galton, D.C.L., F.R.S. (Man, Lond., I9II, xI, 34.) Notes peculiar shape of head; lack of humor due to Quaker ancestry; inventiveness. See Gray (J.). Belden (H. M.) The relation of bal- ladry to folk-lore. (J. Amer. Folk- Lore, Lancaster, Pa., 1911, XXIV, 1-13.) Bernard (F.) La DNpopulation des campagnes. (J. d. Rconom., Paris, 191q, LXX, 201-215.) Author con- siders "la petite propridtde" the best remedy against depopulation of the rural districts. Biasutti (R.) Alcune osservazioni sulla distribuzione geografica dell' indice cefalico e dei principali tipi cranio- metrici. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Fi- renze, 19oI, XL, 353-373, I fg., 2</page><page sequence="6">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 627 maps.) Treats of the geographic distribution of the cephalic index and the chief craniometric types. Accord- ing to B., variations of cranial indices and of the consequent gen- eral architecture of the cerebral cranium, have not the significance of typical (racial) variations, but of phases of craniogenetic devel- opment which may be repeated in any human group. The study of the distribution of cranial forms does not confirm (for modern man) a very great primitiveness of the high doli- choid types. It is not necessary, e. g., to regard individuals with low skulls and individuals with high skulls in a negro, American or European series as typically diverse and phyletically separate, when, at least all the other somatic characters do not confirm such dimorphism. The elimination of dolichocephals from a brachy- cephalic series, or vice-versa, to obtain a " pure " series, is unjustifiable, un- less other reasons strengthen it. - Glaciazioni e umanith secondo il Rutot. (Ibid., 1911, XLI, 188-191.) Resumes and discusses the views of Rutot on man and the glacial period, with special reference to his article in the Bullet. de la Soc. belge de Ge'olo- gie for 191o. B. accepts the chronol- ogy of Rutot. Boekenoogen (J.) Waar de kinderen vandaan komen. (Volkskunde, Gent, 1911, xxII, 18-24, 143-151, 193-198.) First two sections of article on folk- lore of "where the children come from,"-someone brings them (doc- tor, old woman, midwife, etc.); the stork brings them (rhymes are given, pp. 21-24); children come from cab- bages and other plants, from trees, from hollow trees, from under stones, from a well or from the water-mill, out of the water, etc. - Volkshumor in geestalijke zaken. (Ibid., 198-203.) Gives 12 items of folk-wit concerning clergymen, etc. Bolte (J.) Neuere Miirchenliteratur. Z. d. V. f. Volksk., Berlin, 1911, XXI, 180-198.) Reviews, resumes, and critiques of recent literature relating to fairy and folk-tales, etc. General (works of Swanton, v. Gennep, v. der Leyen, Goldenweiser, Sijmons, Aarne, Dihnhardt, Dubsky, Forke, Oertel, Huet, Miiller, Cosquin, v. Sydow, Zwierzina, Armesto, Jones, Wallens- k6ld, Suchier, Johnston, B6klen, Bleich, Class, Tesdorpf, Sperbe, Lee, Barnouw, Gilos, Oliver, Jordan); European (Dihnhardt, Busch, Wos- sidlo, Wisser, Drechsler, Miiller, Parsche, Niderberger, Boekenoogen, Langer, Trevelyan, Brusot, Colson, Sebillot, Roche, Quintin, Polivka, Afanasief, B6hm); Asia (Daniel, Wingate, Macler, Bodding and Bom- pas, Shakespear, Woo, Davis and Chow-Leung, Ramstedt, Nippgen, Basset, Rhodo-Kanakis, Hein) ; Africa (Desparmet, Basset, Artin Pasha, Frobenius, Dayrell, Tremearne, Harris, Joseph, Weule, Lademann, Werner, Jacottet, etc.). Bond (F. D.) The lack of printing in antiquity. (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 584-586.) The author thinks that the main cause of the absence of printing (some sort of stamping or rudimentary printing of course existed) in antiquity, was not lack of paper, but rather the lack of a strong money-making stimulus such as existed in the fifteenth century when printing sprang up in Europe. Bonfigli (R.) Gyrus cunei e plica cu- neo lingualis anterior. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 1911, xVI, 107-II1, 2 fgs.) Treats of the Gyrus cunei and the Plica cuneo-lingualis anterior in the brains of two idiots. The superficiality of the G. cunei is very rare in man. The anomalies noted are interesting for comparison with corresponding phenomena in the brains of the lower races and in those of the anthropoids, etc. Borchardt (P.) Papierabformungen von Monumenten. Winke fiir Reis- ende. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 541-545, 6 fgs.) Treats of paper moulds of inscriptions, carv- ings, and other monuments. The tech- nique is described from personal ex- perience. Bourgin (G.) Histoire de la civilisa- tion. (Scientia, Bologna, 1911, x, NO. 3, 218-222.) Discusses recent works of de Morgan, Dussaud, Dre- rup, Hauser, Piqnet, etc., on the early civilizations of the Mediterranean area (European, African, Asiatic). Burger (Hr.) Demonstration eines Ap-</page><page sequence="7">628 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 13, 1911 parates fiir Kopfmessungen. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 620.) This new apparatus for head-measure- ment may be useful for psychiatrists and sculptors, but hardly for the anthropometrist among primitive peoples. Burne (C. S.) The essential unity of folk-lore. Presidential address. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1911, XXI1, 14-40.) According to Miss B., folk-lore is " the learning of the people," and "it is the product of the thought, the idea of early or barbaric man, ex- pressed in word or in action, in belief, custom, story, song or saying." It is " an entity, the product of the human mind, made up of complementary ele- ments,-belief, custom, and story,-- and liable to be influenced and varied by external circumstances." The bal- lad of the " Bitter Withy " (folk-lore of the willow-tree,--inextricable mingling of belief and practice, myth, song, and saying), the connection be- tween belief and custom, "survivals," the essential solidarity of folk-lore, the racial element, etc., are discussed. In appendix are some notes on Danish dancing-ballads, the dedication of churches, etc. Buschan (G.) Zu dem Kapitel " Mon- golenflecke." (A. f. Anthrop., Brn- schwg., 1911, N. F. Ix, 322.) Cites letter from Dr J. G. F. Riedel of Batavia, dated from Gorontalo, Cele- bes, June 30, 1875, to Charles Darwin, and Darwin's reply. Dr R. notes the "blue spots" on the back above the buttocks of "the children of the primordial North Selebesian tribes." This antedates Dr Baelz's observa- tions of 1883. Carus (P.) Animal symbolism. (Open Court, Chicago, 1911, XXV, 79-95, 16 fgs.) Treats of the fish in ancient classic mythology, the fish-deities of Babylonia and Assyria, Dionysos, Eros and the fish, Christ as Orpheus in the catacombs, etc. - Fish and dove. (Ibid., 212-223, 19 fgs.) Treats of these symbols,- "the sacred animals of Astarte, which reappear during the third and fourth centuries A. D. as important Christian symbols," particularly with reference to the information given by Lucian concerning the worship of Hera at Hierapolis, 'the inscriptions and figures in the catacombs, etc. The fish as treasure-keeper. (Ibid., 314-316, I fg.) Treats of the Apostle Peter and the tribute-money, the ring of Sakuntala, the ring of Polycrates, the dwarf Andwari of the Edda, etc. - The Jonah story and kindred legends. (Ibid., 271-285, 16 fgs.) Treats of Jonah and the whale, Dio- nysus and the dolphin, Arion and the dolphin, Melkarth and the sea-horse, coins illustrating the Greek dolphin legends, Jason and the dragon, Per- seus and the great fish, Heracles and the monster, the Jonah of the Haida Indians, etc. - Some notes on language-study. (Ibid., 292-301.) Discusses the Latin element in English; the change of languages (the author exaggerates the rate among Indian tongues), in words, meanings, pronunciation, etc.; the origin of language, etc. Dr C. thinks that "the most primitive lan- guages appear to have been monosyl- labic," and that "there was a time when the so-called roots were ideas of a general character, which were used for the purpose of communicating intentions, or requests, or declara- tions." They also "first denoted ac- tions," because "language originated as an accompaniment of cooperative work of a communal activity." S Pagan and Christian love-feasts. (Ibid., 513-524, 14 fgs.) Treats of Babylonian communion and fish sacri- fice, convivial scenes depicted on tombs of worshipers of Dionysus and Mithras, a love-feast of the Fabian. family, pagan love-feasts of ancient Rome, etc., the Last Supper, Chris- tian eucharists. - Rivers of living water. (Ibid., 636-639, 3 fgs.) Discusses the pass- age of the New Testament (John VII, 38), " He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water," compared with a passage in the Bud- dhist sacred books. Dr C. refers them to the idea of a divine body partly of flames (or light) and partly of water, inhabited by creatures of earth, air, and water. Chamberlain (A. F.) Some influences of race-contact upon the art of primi-</page><page sequence="8">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 629 tive peoples. (Journ. of Race De- velop., Worcester, 1911, II, 206-209.) Discusses alleged influence (Mason) of introduction of iron upon Eskimo art and on the rock-pictures of Gui- ana (im Thurn) ; the effect of white contact on the art (painting on walls; carving of images, etc.) of South African negroes (Stannus), and on the drawings of Brazilian Indians (Schmidt). - David Boyle.

Neuchat. de Geogr., Neu- chitel, 1910, xx, 213-231.) General discussion of urbanism (cities of an- tiquity, Middle Ages, 19th century, etc.). Religion was at the beginning of Greek and Roman cities. The northern movement of great cities is noteworthy. Coutil (L.) Paul du Chatellier. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 19II, xxII, 364-367.) Note on P. du Chatellier (d. March, 1911) with list of publi- cations (92 studies) chiefly relating to French archeology, Finistere in particular. Decourdemanche (J. A.) Du rapport legal de valeur entre l'or, l'argent et le cuivre chez les peuples anciens et les Arabes. (R. d'Ethnogr. et de Sociol., Paris, 1911, II, 160-173.) Discusses the legal relations of the precious metals in Persia, Cyzicus, Rome, Egypt, and among the Arabs. The value of gold as compared with silver was 13 to I (Persia, Cyzicus, Sicily, etc.) ; 15 to I (Rome, in time of dictator Fabius and down to Con- stantine; after Constantine to fall of empire, 14* to I); among the Arabs 14 to I. The value of silver as com- pared with copper was I128 to I (Egypt, Rome); Ioo to I from re- form of Diocletian; 120 to I after reform of Constantine. Deubner (L.) Moderner Totenkult. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., I911, XIV, 302-303.) Cites curious provisions (yearly festivals, etc.) in the wills pf people dead within the last 30 years, -a sort of perpetuation of the cult of the dead. Dussaud (R.) Totemisme et Exogamie. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1911, XXII, AM. ANTH., N. S., I3-4I 295-305, 2 maps.) Resume and cri- tique of Frazer's Totemism and Ex- ogamy (4 vols., London, 19Io). Enrico Raseri. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 19II, xvI, 181-183.) Note on scientific activities of Prof. Raseri (d. July, 19go) with list of publications, chiefly concerned with demography. Fay (E. W.) Language study and language psychology. (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 369-384.) Discusses article by Prof A. Hill in Pop. Sci Mo., for June, 1907, on "The acquisition of language and its relation to thought." According to Prof. F. "language is the expression of thought, but it is more, it is the prompter of thought." No type of language has ever been found inade- quate to express the thoughts of its native users. Fehlinger (H.) De l'influence bio- logique de la civilisation urbaine. (Scientia, Bologna, 1911, x, No. 4, 421-434.) Discusses recent literature on the subject of "physical degenera- tion," etc., in relation to alleged in- feriority of the city-bred. F. holds that the power of resistance of uncivilized peoples has been greatly exaggerated in the past. The conclusion reached is that "it is a mistake to see in the city, the goal of modern migrations, and the center of mixture of types of different races, a danger to the prog- ress of the development of humanity and civilization." Fewkes (J. W.) The cave dwellings of the Old and the New Worlds. (Amer. Anthrop., Lancaster, Pa., 190Io, N. ., XII, 390-416, 5 pls., 2 fgs.) Franchet (L.) La cuisson des poteries et les phinomenes de la combustion dans l'etude de la ceramique archd- ologique. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1911, 497-499.) Discusses the methods of prehistoric pottery, and particularly the black pottery,- various carboniferous varieties. Frassetto (F.) e Fanesi (F.) Di un nuovo craniostato con movimento compensato. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 1911, XVI, 133-136, 2 fgs.) Describes and figures a new craniostat or craniophor, with com- pensated movement, fitted for any orientation desired for the'skull. It</page><page sequence="9">630 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 13, 1911 is an improvement upon that of Stolyhwo. Friedemann (M.) Die Stellung des Menschen im zoologischen System. (Ztschr. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19II, XLIII, Ir4-II15.) Discussion of article with this title by Friedenthal in I9Io. Friedemann believes that the struc- ture of the human brain entitles man to a special place among the Primates. Friedenthal (H.) Die Stellung des Menschen im zoologischen System. (Ibid., 1910, XLII, 989-994.) Argues for the inclusion of man with the anthropoid apes in a sub-order An- thropomorphae,-from identity of blood, forms of nails and sperma- tozoa, hair, physiological processes of growth, etc. Fritsch (G.) Zweite Vorlage einer Vtbersichtstabelle der Menschenras- sen. Diskussion. (Ibid., 924-929.) Views of Ehrenreich, v. Luschan, Staudinger on Fritsch's scheme of the human races. Dr E. doubts the simple hypothesis of three stem-races--white, yellow, black. The fusion of Amer- ican Indians, Mongolians, and Malays is not so justifiable as F. thinks. Dr v. L. is quite unfavorable to F.'s scheme. Verwertung von Rassenmerk- malen fiir allgemeine Vergleichungen. (Ibid., 1911, XLIII, 272-280, 4 fgs.) F. emphasizes the fact that even the most striking racial characters are not absolutely constant (skull, skele- ton, skin-color, eye-form, hair, etc.), but notes that this need not exclude their use in comparing the races of man. This point is discussed with special reference to hair-form (pp. 276-279) in Chinese and Hottentots. Differences that are of value as dis- tinctions are often made of no value by pedantic devotion to averages, or by misinterpretation of variations. Frizzi (E.) Der Miessche Schiidel- triager.

Qu'est-ce que le to- timisme ? (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1911, xxII, 93-104.) Discusses the views of Frazer in his Totemism and Ex- ogamy. Van G. agrees with F. in separating exogamy from totemism, but not in refusing the latter all re- ligious significance. The difficulties of deciding what "-totemism" really means are emphasized.

Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V-) La quistione dei pigmei e le variazioni morfolo- giche dei gruppi etnici. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 19Io, XL, 289-315.) Treats of pigmies and the morpho- logical variations of ethnic groups (views of Schmidt, Hagen, Stratz, Sanson, etc.), particularly the theory Jield more or less by Schmidt, Hagen, Klaatsch, etc., that the primitive human race (or Urrasse) is "a race corresponding to the infantile stage of more evolved ontogenetic devel- opment." According to G.-R., the</page><page sequence="10">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 631 pigmies may be a primitive human group more or less ecumenic, but to consider them the basis of all others is goiixg too far. The other charac- ters, outside of small stature, are not so convincing, as, e.g., Schmidt thinks. The two types found by Hagen among the Kubu, and Bataks, are not, as he maintains, two human varieties, but the two extremes of a well-known oscillation. Pigmies and tall types are varieties of one and the same species of man, and one need not wonder at their having about the same proportions as the taller types, however much this fact may con- tradict the so-called fundamental bio- genetic law. Gordon (G. B.) The functions of the modern museum. (U. of Penn. Mus. J., Phila., 1911, II, 2-5.) Argues that " the principal function of the modern museum is to promote the in- crease of knowledge and the cultiva- tion of taste." It is the instrument by which "human documents" are to be saved for the uses of science and of posterity. It is "from every point of a view, a necessary instru- ment in modern education." Gray (J.)

Dr B. was eminent as a phys- ical anthropologist (stature, color of hair and eyes, craniology, etc.). - The differences and affinities of paleolithic man and the anthropoid apes. (Ibid., 117-t2o, I fg.) Treats of dimensions of humerus, femur and tibia in Neandertal and Aurignac man, the gorilla, the orang, and the chimpanzee. According to G. "1the Aurignac (and Galley Hill) man dif- ferentiated himself from the chim- pansoids at an earlier epoch than the Neandertal man separated from the gorilloids." The brachycephalic races of Asia may have developed from the orangoids. G.'s theory of the descent of man agrees with that of Klaatsch, except that the chimpan- zee is substituted for the orang. Guerard (A. L.) English as an inter- national language. (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 337-345.)

Hahn (E.) Die Erkenntnis des heuti- gen Volkslebens als Aufgabe der Volkskunde. (Z. d. Ver. f. Volksk., Berlin, 1911, xxI, 225-233.) Discus- ses the knowledge of modern folk- life as the subject of folk-lore. Folk- lore is "ethnology applied to our own people." Important for folk-lore is the age of youth so closely connected with tradition. -- Die Entstehung der Bodenwirt- schaft. (Scientia, Bologna, 1911, Ix, No. I, 139-153.) Discusses the origin of agricultural economy: The three- stage theory, the sex-division of labor, the r61le of woman in the development of agriculture, etc. In human history economic work has been furnished most often by woman, in the begin- ning where only human labor has been present,-" hoe-culture," "gard- ening," etc., as with the modern European peasant woman today in certain areas. Plough-culture means the addition of other than human labor,-that of domestic animals. Harlan I. Smith: Explorer in arche- ology. (Amer. Museum J., N. Y., 1911, XI, 301-302.)

Die Oiltesten Formen der menschli6hen Behapsung und ihr Zu- sammenhang mit der allgemeinen Kul- turentwicklung. (Scientia, Bologna, 1911, x, No. 3, 132-142.) Treats of cave-dwellings, round-dwellings, four- cornered houses (megaron-type, etc.). in various parts of the world, their evolution, relation to one another, etc. Tree-houses and dwellings in hollow- trees can never have been universal primitive forms of habitation. Cave- dwelling, more extended in use and distribution, came nearer being such. The late neolithic hunting tribes of the close of the glacial age had both caves and huts,-the latter of the four-cornered type, for the round- dwelling comes later, and when met with among hunter-peoples is open to the suspicion of having been bor- rowed from other cultures. Certain types of dwelling have apparently grown up under controlling influences of a local environment. Independent invention is not absolutely to be re- jected here and there. von Hornbostel (E.) Ober ein akusti- sches Kriterium fiir Kulturzusam- menhiinge. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 6o0-6I5.)' Treats of the physical-acoustical (measurement of tones) as a criterion of culture-rela- tions. Investigates in,'this way the question whether the African xylo- phone is autocthonous or imported from southeastern Asia, and the ques- tion of the origin and distribution of the pan's pipe. The results favor in- troduction of the xylophone from southeastern Asia, and of culture- relations in the matter of the spread of the pan's pipe. Hough (W.) Edward Palmer. (Amer.

Treats of the origin of the judicium offae (ordeal by which the accused had to swallow a quantity of bread or cheese, or be considered guilty). J. rejects the origin offered by F. Patella in his Le ordalie, from India, and Kober's theory of provenance from England, and seeks to show that the custom is of Christian origin, and stands in certain relationship with the religious and other ceremonials of the eucha- ristic type.

Treats, with bibliography (pp. 560-563), of the lit- erature concerning the couvade in Europe (Mediterranean region), Asia (China, Miaotse; India, Dra- vidians), Indonesia and Polynesia (Island of Buru; Dayaks of Bor- neo), Africa (Congo country), America (Island Caribs, Caribs of mainland, Arawaks and other tribes of Venezuela, Guiana, Brazil, etc.; some tribes of New Mexico and Cali- fornia). Northern South America seems to be "the classic land of the couvade,"-there are two other not- able couvade-areas, one in southeastern Asia, the other in southwestern Europe (cf. the Basques). The author warns against unjustifiable generalization. There are two types of the couvade, one of which is possibly an imitatio naturae, a couvade proper; the other (the South American sort) may in some cases be explained as a "temporary union with the father " for the child,-- or something very like it. This may have been connected with the transi- tion from matriarchy to patriarchy. Possibly type first has grown up out of type second. de Lanessan (J. L.)

Dr M. recog- nizes a primal period of vitalism (fetish, magic), a next stage of soul- belief (spirits, ancestor cult), a third stage (anthropomorphism, man-like deities, temples, statues, etc.). The Teutons when they appeared in his- tory were in this third stage, but pos- sessed also much of earlier origin. Morselli (E.) Etnologia ed etnografia.

Martin, Achelis, Giinther, Kaindl, Tylor, Brinton, M. Ant6n, De Hoyos Sainz, Papillault, etc.). According to Prof. M., ethnology is " the study of races understood and treated from a point of view predominantly natural- istic or zoological"; and ethnog- raphy, "the study of peoples consid- ered rather from a geographical-his- torical aspect." de Mortillet (A.) Survivance usuelle de la pierre. (Rev. Anthrop., Paris, 1911, XXI, 81-97, 6 fgs.) Treats of three phases of the survival of the use of stone: Persistence (the more or less prolonged real employment), habit and atavism, tradition; the survival of stone weapons (e. g. axes among vikings, Saxons, etc.), stone tools (harrow used in Rumania 25 years ago had stone "teeth,"-cf. the classic tribulum; stone saws in bronze age; hafted stone used to bark trees in Ardennes as late as 1858), etc. Niceforo (A.)

Pearson (K.) On the value of the teachers' opinion of the general intel- ligence of school children. (Biomet- rika, Cambridge, 191o, viI, 542-548.) From consideration of the tables and reductions of H. Gertrude Jones (data are from schedules filled in by over 20 Aberdeen teachers concerning 249 boys from 4 different schools, ages 6 to 14,-in groups according to excellent, good, moderate, dull), Dr P. concludes that there is "a sub- stantial correlation between teachers' estimate of general capacity and ex- amination test." Thus such estimate "is not a purely idle character, wholly valueless owing to the personal equation of the teacher." Peirce (G. J.) Civilization and vegeta- tion. (Pop. Sci.

In connection with the story of Pan- darus, the Thessalian, and the trans- ference of the stigmata on his fore- head to Echedorus, the author dis- cusses in detail the meaning, etc., of stigmata, grammata, marks and signs, tattooing, signaculum of con- firmation, mark of the miles Christi, sign of the hand and marked hands, the military sign, etc.,-casterization, scarification, tattooing in various forms and fashions to mark slaves and property, as a religious token, as a mark of soldiers, etc. Branding has but recently disappeared from the penal codes of Christianity. Tattoo- ing was much in vogue in pre-Hel- lenic Greece, but not favored in classic times. Marking cattle by branding was wide-spread in an- tiquity. Slaves and recruits were often "marked " (the military mark was of religious origin in all prob- ability, a special variety of the re- ligious stigmata, and was derived from Syria). The text of the story is from the stelae of Epidaurus. This mono- graph contains much valuable infor- mation. Pessler (W.) System der Ethno-Geo- graphie. (Mitt. d. Anthrop.

There are three pri- mary ethnogeographical questions: How is each particular folk-character distributed, both with regard to its external and its internal limits ? How old are the limits? What are the re- lations to one another of the limits of folk-characters, and how are coinci- dences and deviations to be explained ? Pfeiffer (L.)

Detailed discussion of the preparation of skins in the stone-age, the implements, etc., employed, the further uses of the prepared skin, leather, etc. The subject is illus- trated by numerous references to the finds at Schussenried, Lindenthal cave, Taubach, Krems, in Scandinavia, etc., and to the Eskimo and Ameri- can Indians. The so-called "woman's knife" and its ancient representatives are considered at length and a list given (pp. 889-895) of places (pre- historic) and modern tribes, etc., among which the "woman's knife " and certain other types have been found. Poniatowski (S.) tiber den Wert der Indexklassifikation. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1911, N. F. X, 50-54.) After a historical sketch of the classi- fications of cephalic indices and a dis- cussion of their value, P. concludes that "the abolition of index-classi- fication would mark a great step in advance in anthropology." Literal- ism in the use of such class-terms has led to very many errors; so, too, the dependence upon averages. Proceedings of the Anthropological Society of Washington. (Amer. Anthrop., Lancaster, Pa., 19II, N. S. XIII, 313-319.) Puccioni (N.) Ricerche sui rapporti di grandezza tra corpo e ramo ascendente nella mandibola. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, I9II, XLI, 83- 152, 6 fgs.) Treats of the relations in size between the body and the ascending ramus of the lower jaw- bone in skulls of numerous races and peoples, in children and anthropoids. P. considers that there exist in these relations "ethnic differences indicat- ing true ethnic mandibular types" ; the "fossil" jawbones of Europe are morphologically one with those of modern man; those of the anthropoids present a morphology different from that of man; the jawbone of women and of children have certain char- acters in common and they are mark- edly different from those of adult males. Six ethnic types are noted: Caucasoid (finest), Australoid, Mon- goloid, American, Negroid and Hot- tentot. The Australoid, from one side, the American from another, are near the Caucasoid; the Hottentot and the Mongoloid farthest from it; the Negroid occupies a central posi- tion. Reche (0.) Lingen-Breitenindex und Schidellinge. (A. f. Anthrop., Brn- schwg., 1911, N. F. x, 74-90, 7 fgs.) Discusses in detail, with tables of measurements, etc., the cephalic index and length of skull (a new index, the length-index of the occiput, is intro- duced, by which " it is possible to dis- tinguish short and long skulls without reference to measurement of breadth," -low indexes indicating skulls with short and high indexes skulls with long occiput). Risley (H.) Presidential Address. The methods of Ethnography. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1911, XLI, 8-19.)

Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 19II, XVI, 137-141, 4 fgs.) Treats of the varia- tions of the ducts of venous sinuses of the dura mater, with particular refer- ence to Le Double's Traite' des varia- tions des os du crane de l'homme (Paris, 1903), etc. The relation be- tween the development of the osseous skull and that of the endocranial arte- rial circulation is probably equivalent to that existing between the develop- ment of the osseous skull and the pos- terior venous sinuses of the dura madre. Rutot (A.) Essai sur les origines et sur le developpement de l'humanite primitive. (Rev. de l'Univ. de Brux- elles, 1911, 241-276.) Discusses the origin and development of man and the varieties of man, in prehistoric Europe in particular. R. recognizes two human types the Homo primige- nius (older, more homogeneous) and the Homo sapiens (later, heterogene- ous). The first dolichocephalous, prognathous, with retreating fore- head and chin, no longer having liv- ing representatives; the second doli- chocephalous, mesaticephalous, or brachycephalous, with well-developed forehead and chin, etc., complicated and diversified in its evolution, in- fluenced by metissages, presenting high and modern characters often preserved in the races of today. The oldest precursor of man and the an- thropoids was probably a late Eocene development from the Prosimians, which gave rise to two branches lead- ing on the one hand to the modern Gibbons and on the other to the H. Primigenius. The oldest of the monkeys properly so-called, the Oreo- pithecus, dates from the lower Plio- cene. Up to the close of the Qua- ternary the H. Primigenius was the only representative of the human race. Pre-eolithic and eolithic implements are recognized by Rutot. After this came the H. sapiens and the improve- ment of human intelligence and cul- ture down to the present. Rutz (0.) Der Gemiitsausdruck als Rassenmerkmal. (Anthropos, St Gabriel-Midling bei Wien, 19I1, vI, 147-173, 302-317, 8 fgs.) According to Dr R. every individual possesses a musculature revealing itself in the whole bodily posture and constituting the expression of type of tempera- mental life,-speech, music, song. There are 4 such types (each with a "cold" and a "warm " variety) ,- Teutonic, Italian, French, and another not yet practically in evidence. These are discussed in detail, with examples from the literature of various Euro- pean peoples. The application of these types to Asiatic, African, and American native peoples is also briefly considered. Hindus and Japanese be- long to the Italian type, as do the Annamese; Mongols to the French type; certain African peoples and Malays to the French type; Austra- lians and South Sea Islanders to this type also, together with the American Indians. Sanctity of tabu (The). (Open Court, Chicago, 1911, XXV, 155-175, 22 fgs.) Treats of the tabu of animals (the tabu remains often when the reason for their holiness has long disap- peared). The Semitic tabu of swine, ancient Greek sacrifice of pig in the Elusinian mysteries, the Thesmo- phoria, etc.; the bear among the Ainu, certain American Indian tribes; the fish in Oriental and ancient class- ical mythology, among the Polyne- sians, Melanesians, American Indians, etc. The inheritance of our religion from pre-Christian cults is very great. Schiick (A. C.) Das Schulterblatt des Menschen und der Anthropoiden. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 191o, XL, 231-237, 9 fgs.) Treats of the form of the shoulder-blade, ossifica- tion, dimensions, angles, indices, spina, etc., in man and the anthro- poids. The most removed from man, in all respects is the gibbon. The scapular index of the chimpanzee ap- proaches nearest that of man. Scripture (W.) The sounds of "ch" and "j." (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 350-354, 6 fgs.) Based on data from a voice-recording apparatus. The conclusion reached is that "ch (0) and j (J) are to be recognized as individual sounds quite distinct from the compound sounds tsh and dsh."

Variazioni di sviluppo del lobo frontale nell' uomo. (Ibid., 1910, XL, 361-372.) Treats of the development of the frontal lobe in Herero, Hindus, Javanese, Japanese, Sudanese, and Ovambo (measured by the author) compared with Germans (Tedeschi) and Italians (Chiarugi),-also Ital- ian new-born infants. According to Dr S., the relative development of the frontal lobe has a special formula for each ethnic group, particularly if we consider the lobe as divided into two zones, upper and lower. The pre- dominance in the development of the frontal lobe over the parieto-occipital does not suffice to distinguish man from the primates or higher from lower human races. The progressive elements of the human brain must be sought in other morphological (macro- scopic or microscopic) characters. -- Sui solchi temporo-occipitali in- ferior nel cervello dell' uomo.

Eine kulturhistorisch-ethnographische Skiz- ze. (Archiv f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 19II, N. F. x, 91-150, 9 pls., 7 fgs.; Bibl., 150 titles.) This monograph on the culture-history and ethnography of the knife (" one of the primitive possessions of man ") treats of knives of animal materials (teeth, claws, nails; horn, bone, etc.; shell) of vege- table material (wood, bamboo), of mineral, etc. (stone, flint, obsidian, slate, glass), of metal (copper, bronze, iron,-prehistoric and modern; the knife as weapon among modern peo- ples (dagger, throwing-knife, for striking or cutting, sword-knives, etc., hunting-knife) ; the knife as tool and implement (in cult and ceremony; sacrificial and circumcision knives, etc.; knives for cutting, whittling, shaving, "'woman's knife"). The knife is widespread, "uralt," and some of its forms have been inde- pendently evolved in different regions of the globe. Knives survive in ritual and cult use, when they have disap- peared from ordinary employment. Shufeldt (R. W.) Nakedness and public morality. (Amer. J. Dermat., St. Louis, 1911, xv, 596-6o0, 3 fgs.) Resumes and discusses Dr Havelock Ellis' chapter on " Sexual Education and Nakedness" in his recent work Sex in Relation to Society. Advocates "the accustoming of adults to the sight of the nude form and inculcat- ing in them the, esthetic sense of its beauty, its value, and its power to ele- vate the entire nature of man, and act as a spur to his achievement in all that pertains to refinement and morality,"-and letting this knowl- edge pass to the children. Simmel (G.) Der Begriff und die Tra- godie der Kultur. (Logos, Tiibingen, 1911, II, 1-25.) S. concludes that, unlike the old Franciscans, who de- clared of themselves that nihil haben- tes, omnia possidentes, the men and women of rich and overburdened civ- ilizations must say of themselves omnia habentes, nihil possidentes. Smiley (J. K.) Religious sacrifices. Open Court, Chicago, 1911, xxV, 96- 122.) Treats of origin, development, and decline of this custom. Primitive peoples (Indonesians and Polyne- sians, Africans, American Indians), civilized peoples of antiquity, Japa- nese, Chinese, etc., are referred to. S. believes that sacrifice grew up in connection with spirit-lore,--human and animal both. Idols and fetishes. (Ibid., 455- 470, 540-571, 7 fgs.) Treats in simi- lar fashion the question of idol-wor-</page><page sequence="18">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 639 ship, fetishism, etc. S. believes that "idolatry and fetishism . . . even in the most diverse parts of the world . . are essentially the same, both in their origin and character." They are, indeed, " merely objects for spirits to inhabit." According to S., idols "probably developed in the middle stages of savagery, and abounded in the higher stages of savagery, and on the lower levels of civilization; as intelligence increases they are dis- carded." Idolatry, unknown to sav- ages, will disappear with a high civi- lization. Sollas (W. J.) The evolution of man. (Scientia, Bologna, 1911, IX, No. I, 118-138.) Treats of Magdelenian, Solutrean, Mousterian man and their relations to modern man,-the devel- opment of skull and brain are con- sidered in particular. According to Dr S., " the primitive inhabitants of France were distinguished from the highest civilized races, not by a smaller, but by a larger cranial capacity; in other words, as we pro- ceed backwards in time the human brain increases rather than diminishes in volume." At the same time "as we proceed backwards man departs farther from the ape in the size of his brain, but approaches nearer to the ape in the characters of his bodily framework." There is a serial rela- tionship in the matter of brain be- tween "the ancestral lemurs, the lower catarrhine monkeys, the man- like apes, and, finally, man himself." Human evolution was accomplished, probably, "under the influence of severe competition," but "man seems to have attained, at a comparatively early stage, the full powers of his intellect," and "his subsequent ad- vance has been due less to its con- tinued development than to its con- stant exercise, and especially to the perfection of speech, its great instru- ment." Even since its first appear- ance the human race " has given birth to great discoverers and great dis- coveries." Stratz (C. H.) Gr*sse und Propor- tionen der menschlichen Rassen. (Archiv f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 19II, N. F., X, 226-232, 4 fgs.) Discusses stature and bodily proportions in the protomorphic race (6 to 7 head- heights; excessive length of arms), black race (61 to 71 head-h., excess of arm and leg-length), yellow race (61 to 7J head-h., short leg-length), white race (7 to 8 head-h., normal proportions). On p. 231 is given the photograph of a fisher-maiden of the Island of Urk, with a stature of i,8o8 mm., head-height 196 mm., giving a proportion of 9.2 head-heights,-a unique measurement.

Anthrop., Paris, 19II, XXI, 4-17.) Treats of grammar as "the study of the elements of language: Phonetics, morphology, semantics, syntax." Ac- cording to V., "with a grammar thus methodically made, the theoretic or practical study of any language would be very easy," and character even of the speech of the Martian's could be outlined. A study of the Handbook of Indian Languages recently pub- lished by the Bureau of American Ethnology would, doubtless, modify some of the author's ideas as to the character of certain languages. Virchow (H.) Stand der Rudolf Vir- chow-Stiftung fiir das Jahr I9Io. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 191o, XLII, 982- 987.) Through the Virchow Founda- tion a part of the finds of H. Schmidt at Cucuteni (Rumania) have been made over to the prehistoric section of the Museum fiir VSlkerkunde. From the expedition of Hr Hantzsch some ioo ethnological specimens from Baf- fin Land have been received and loaned to the Museum. Grants have been made to Hr Lehmann-Haupt for aid in publishing his work on ancient and modern Armenia; Dr S. Sergi for his monograph on Abyssinian skulls; Hr M.

R. Schmidt for travels in Europe and N. Africa to study the paleolithic age in those regions. Wead (C. K.) Music and science. (Bull. Philos. Soc. Wash., 9gio, xv, 169-I87.) Treats of primitive, an- cient Greek, and modern music. Four stages in the development of musical scales are recognized: Primitive (no more indication of scale than in sounds of birds, animals or nature); stage of implements mechanically ca- pable of furnishing a scale; stage of theoretical melodic scales (Greek, Arab, Chinese, Hindu, Medieval, etc.); stage of the modern harmonic scale and its descendant, the equally- tempered scale. Though overlapping, even in the same locality, these four stages "correspond, in a rough way, to the recognized four culture-stages, namely: the savage, barbarous, civi- lized, and enlightened." Weatherly (U. G.) A world-wide color-line. (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 474-485.) Accord- ing to Prof. W., " the color line is evidence of an attempt, based on instinctive choice,,-to preserve those distinctive values which a racial group has come to regard as of the highest moment to itself," and " the fact that it is always the lighter race that puts the taboo on the colored, and that the latter is everywhere eager to mix vith the whites, is only an evidence of the general trend of choice towards the higher efficiency of the white race." The color problem is not peculiar to America,-" racial characteristics are the accompaniments rather than the cause of lack of adjustment." The negro is " pliable and imitative" and "tends to take on the psychic tone of the dominant culture." Color preju- dice, in the last analysis," is based on cultural difference more than on the degree of pigmentation." The worst aspects of race animosity are elimi- nated by " narrowing the gap between the actual cultural status of the races." Webster (H.) Rest days: a sociolog- ical study. (Univ. Stud., Lincoln, Neb., 1911, XI, 1-158.) Treats, with abundant references to the literature of the subject: Periods of abstinence at critical epochs (Hawaiian tabu days, Dayak lali days, Assamese genna days); periods of abstinence after a death and on related occasions; periods of abstinence at sacred times and seasons (holy-days and quasi-</page><page sequence="20">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 641 holidays in higher and lower culture) ; periods of abstinence connected with lunar phenomena (lunar supersti- tions and taboos, lunar months and weeks, the hebdomadal cycle); the Babylonian "evil days" and Sabattu (the " evil days, the cult of seven, and the planetary week, Babylonian lunar weeks, tabqos observed on the "evil days," the Sabattu) ; the Hebrew Sab- bath (the Sabbath in the Old Testa- ment, the Sabbath as a lunar festival, taboos observed on the Sabbath); periods of abstinence at unlucky times and seasons (conception of un- luckiness, unlucky days in lower and higher culture). Belief in days lucky and unlucky "has operated, like other superstitions to retard the develop- ment of mankind," but, "nothing is more interesting than the contempla- tion of that unconscious though bene- ficent process which has converted institutions based partly or wholly on a belief in the imaginary and the super- natural into institutions resting on the rock of reason and subserving human welfare." Tabooed and unlucky days originate often in gross superstition, but " sooner or later, they acquire a social significance and may then be perpetuated as the primitive holidays long after their earlier meaning has faded away." The author is of opin- ion that " the passage of the holy day into the holiday, beginning in the lower culture, promises to reach its culmination in the thorough seculariz- ing of all the great festivals of the Christian year." Prof W. intends shortly to issue this interesting and valuable monograph in amplified form. Weinreich (0.) Engastirmythen. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., I9Io, xiII, 622-623.)

Angelotti (G.) Intorno a due tipi cranici del territorio etrusco. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 1910, xv, 285-307, 2 fgs.) Gives results of ob- servation and measurements of two skulls (male,--capacity 1,581 c.c., ceph. ind., 88.7; male,--cap. calc. 1,503 c.c., index 78.4) and the skele- ton belonging to the second. These specimens, now in the Museum of Anthropology, were found in two tombs in the neighborhood of Citta delle Pieve, near Chiusi, in the Etrus- can territory and belonging to the Etruscan period. Dr A. does not be- lieve in the theory of a specific Etrus- can cranial type (better Etruscanized, if any), the Etruscan type being, in the last analysis, Mediterranean. The Etruscan population besides the doli- cho-mesocephalic type, possessed also elements of the brachycephalic type (few of these have been found). The Etruscan people were composed of the same elements that inhabited Italy at the close of the eneolithic period. The height of the man represented by the skeleton was (average of several cal- culations) 1,653 mm. Dr A. thinks that the Etruscans were of medium stature, oscillating between I,62o and 1,67o or i,68o mm. Ashby (T.) Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa. (Ann.

If the placenta were to sud- denly dry up, the glands would also become dry, and suckling be made impossible. Bermbach (P.) "Schutz dem Volks- tum in den deutschen Alpen!" (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f.

Boule (M.) et Anthony (R.) L'ence- phale de l'homme fossile de la Cha- pelle-aux-Saints. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1911, XXII, 129-196, 26 fgs.) Detailed study of the encephalon (after a good cast of the endocra- nium) of the "fossil man" of La Chapelle-aux-Saints, compared with the anthropoids and other primitive men. The general conclusion reached is that "the encephalon of the fossil man of La Chapelle-aux-Saints pre- sents an ensemble of characters of inferiority more numerous and more marked than the encephalon of any existing men," and "if, by reason of volume (absolute and relative) it is human, it seems to approach the an- thropoid encephalon in the majority of its morphological details." The man of La Chapelle-aux-Saints pos- sessed probably a rudimentary articu- late language, and was likewise al- ready right-handed. Bourlon (Lt.) Essai de classification des burins.

Brownlee (J.) A note on the possi- bility of analysing race-mixtures into their original elements by the Mende- lian formula. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst.,</page><page sequence="24">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 645 Lond., 1911, XL, 179-199.) Treats of the Mendelian distribution of jet black hair, the distribution of color of hair and eyes in various parts of Scotland, in connection with other an- thropological characters. Pages 196- 199 are devoted to a table giving " the probable percentage composition (Teutonic, Alpine, Mediterranean) of the population of the different dis- tricts in Scotland based on the obser- vations of Dr. Beddoe." The highest Teutonic percentage (53.6) is found among the farmers of Midlothian, the lowest (29.8) in Arrochar, Tarbet, etc., in the West Highlands. The highest Alpine (49.4) occurs in the city of Brechin, in the Eastern Low- lands; the lowest (26.5) in the Portree district of Skye. The highest per- centage of the Mediterranean race is found in Portree, Skye; the lowest in the Dunse district of the Merse,-- the differences range from 15 to 30 %o' in the inland highland valleys. Ac- cording to B., "nowhere is there any indication that any large tract of country is fundamentally different from the average of the country as a whole," and "early environment tells more than lineage in determining the mental aspect towards the universe," -the psychical differences of high- lander and lowlander are more due to environment than to race.

On pages 451-487 a list of 96 graves is given with brief account of contents, etc.; and on pages 485-497 the various vessels and their ornamentation are discussed. Of the graves 66 contained but one burial, 22 had 2, 6 had 3, and 2 had 4 (in each case 2 children). The crema- tion-material represented ioi adults, 18 young persons, and 17 children. The number of vessels in each grave varied from I to 33 (18 had 5),- there were 569 vessels in all, urns, pots, cups, dishes, jugs, etc. The metal grave-gifts were of bronze (chiefly rings). The grave-cultus represents the mixed northern-Ger- manic and southern-Thracian, and most of the graves belong to the fourth bronze-period or 1200-1ooo B. C. - Ein Rad aus Ton. (Ibid., 19go, XLII, 971-972.) Note on a small clay wheel (four-spoked) found during the work on the great Reiherwerder in the Tegel Lake, district of Nieder- Barnim.

Notes on the discovery of another human skeleton in Sep- tember I9Io at la Ferrassie in Dor- dogne, that of a very small woman (stature ca. 1480 mm.). The authors are of opinion that these " Mouste- rians" were considerably below the. modern Australians in matter of evo- lution. Carus (P.) The Russian fish-epic (Open Court, Chicago, 1911, XXV, 245-248.)

Detailed study pf the skull and brain of a woman of 71 years, native of the commune of Varsi in the Parmese Ap- pennines (46 km. from Parma), who died in 19o6 in the City Hospital of Parma. She was 1,320 mm. in height, ---cranial capacity 67I ccm., ceph. index 94.69. All the organs ex- amined seemed correspondingly re- duced, and no genuine malformations were noted. The brain-weight was 598 gr. No characteristic micro- cephalic features were observed. The case seems to be one of small stature and small cranial capacity occurring with normal intellectual development and to "prove the existence of indi- vidual pigmies in this region." Conil (P. A.) Contribution ' l'Ptude du passage du mousterien S l'aurig- nacien en Gironde. Station de la Verribre. (Revue Anthrop., Paris, 19II, xxI, 182-188, 2 fgs.) Accord- ing to C., the stone implements, etc. (three kinds of flint used; arrow- heads; "coups de poing" rare; scrapers and scratchers, blades; nuclei rare; strikers, etc.) indicate a transition stage from the Mousterian to the Aurignacian at the "station" of la Verriere in Gironde.

The population of the Slavonic areas, ac- cording to C., is a sub-brachycephalic, small-statured, dark-blond pre-Sla- vonic type, which has been overrun by a series of anthropological strata as follows: (I) a blond, tall, short- headed (Sarmatian) type in the re- gion from the Carpathians to beyond the Volga; (2) the Nordic type, which has wedged itself along the Vistula and Dwina far into the in- terior; (3) the very brachycephalic Dinaric type visible in Kiev and East Galicia, which has increased the brachycephaly and likewise the pig- mentation. In West Galicia appears another very brachycephalic element, possibly H. alpinus. Dawkins (W. B.) The arrival of man in Britain in the Pleistocene age. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 191o, XL, 233- 263, 5 fgs.)

Zur Entwicklungsge- schichte der altr6mischen Religion. (Neue Jahrb., f. d. Klass. Alt., Lpzg., 1911, XXVII-XXVIII, 321-335.) Dis- cusses the development of ancient Roman religion, with special refer- ence to G. Wissowa's Religion und Kultus der Rimer (Miinchen, 1902), etc. The rites are more important than the names of the festivals (briefly considered). In some cases deities have grown up out of rites. The de- velopment of Jupiter Lapis is of great interest. Also the Lupercal. - Lupercalia. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1910, xIII, 481-508.) Treats in detail of the Roman festival of the Lupercalia. The etymology of luperci (whence lupercal and luper- ,calia) is discussed, and the derivation from lupus and arceo adopted,- ' wolf-warder," "protector against wolves," as would be natural in a festival of shepherds; the character of the festival considered with the actions of the participants (the relation to women, etc.),-from a pastoral festi- val the old rite changed to a peni- tential ceremony; the bloody ritual is of later origin (cf. Greek ca- tharsis) and came comparatively late as an addition to the ancient Roman ceremony. The story of the Lupercalia, from the simple festival of shepherds to its last appearance among the Romans is a most interest- ing one. Distel (T.) Ein Basler Biinkelsiinger- lied vom Jahre 1566.

Discusses the character and position of the Cro-Magnon type, with special reference to the Galley- Hill skull, etc.-these two types differ in several respects, particularly with respect to the flattening of the cranial vault. According to G.-R., "the Mediterranean pentagonoids are nearest related to the Cro-Magnon type, confirming the view that the Mediterranean is a more highly evolved Cro-Magnon type." As be- longing to the Galley-Hill (so-called Pelasgic) type, G.-R. lists the skull of the Grotta del Tufo (Como), the cranium No. 5 of Remedello, perhaps one of the Este skulls and one of the Picenian skulls from the necropolis of Tolentino; the hypercephalic cra- nium from Conain recently described by Zanolli, some Sardinian skulls de- scribed by Sergi, etc. The author likewise describes in cranium No. 648 of the Anthropological Museum (Florence) the very rare anomaly of a sutural bone in the left coronal,- the skull is that of an adult woman with capacity of 1400 c.c.

The former has a horse's head and appears most commonly on a moor in the Saal forest, and the legend is more than a century old. The identification with a historical personage is a modern invention. " Father Biimke " is likewise " an old worn-down legendary figure." He also is related to the horse. The etymology of both names is rather uncertain. Hall (E.) The ancient hymn-charms of Ireland. (Folk-Lore, Lond., I9Io, xxI, 417-446.)

Describes the deciphering by the author of the disk found by Dr Pernier two years ago under a part of the palace of Phaestos dating from not later than I6oo B. C. Both faces are covered with "characters differing from those employed in all the other Minoan writings." Dr H. has determined the document to be pre-Homeric Ionic Greek in a syllabic script. The disc itself "originated on the southwest coast lands of Asia Minor." This text, concerned with a religious sacri- fice and cast in metrical form, is the oldest written Greek known and val- uable for the early history of Greek sounds, inflections and syntax.

Treats of the ritual gifts in the North Bavarian mound-graves (stone period not represented; early bronze age feebly represented; late bronze age; old and later Hallstatt periods; early La Thne period). There is a paucity of such grave-gifts in the bronze age, due, perhaps, to their symbolic use. The abundance of ceramic gifts in the Hallstatt period is not peculiar to this region. Howarth (W. J.) Comparison between town and country children. (School</page><page sequence="32">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 653 Hygiene, Lond., 1911, VIII, 454-457.) Data from Annual Report to the Kent Education Committee. The figures for heights and weights of children 13 years of age are much the same for town and country,--but " the children of the poorest town schools are inferior to those in the poorest country schools, and the high standard for height and weight found in the best town schools raises the general average to one closely resembling that found in the country schools."

The date of these finds is the later paleolithic period, corresponding to the Aurig- nacian of France. King (I.) Some problems in the science of religion. (Harv. Theol. Rev., Cambridge, 19II, IV, I04-II8.) Re- plies to certain criticisms of the author's recent book on The Develop- ment of Religion. According to Dr K., the rites and ceremonies and other activities of primitive religion (" and to some extent also of the civilized races"), have "a striking similarity to the more general play-customs and economic activities of the society," which suggests that their religious meaning has been acquired, but re- ligious practices are no more an "aside" or "by-product," differen- tiated from the primary adjustment reactions than is any other aspect of present-day human life; also "the hypothesis of a primitive animism is not the only possible view of primi- tive man's attitude toward the world." Magic "is essentially individualistic and private," religion has a "1social quality." The idea of deities devel- oped from primitive objects of inter- est related in some quite acute manner to the welfare of the savage (elemen- tary processes of food-supply, pro- tection, reproduction).

Two other skulls, one with Leontiasis ossea and the other with real exostoses, were ex- hibited. Kondziella (F.) Die Totenbretter. (Mitt. d. Schles. Ges. f. Volks., Bres- lau, 19Io, xII, 149-158.) Treats of " death-boards" in Silesia, etc., in addition to the data in the nine ex- tensive works of Hern, Rieder, and Meyer. Great variety of form exists, also of color; the inscriptions are likewise subject to considerable diver- sity. The "death-boards" are used for placing the corpse on; afterwards they are preserved as heirlooms in the house, placed up against the barn, the hedge, or laid down upon the ground. Sometimes they are burned after the funeral. " Death-boards" with dates as late as 900oo are known. Many superstitions are connected with them. Kyrle (G.) tber einen priihistorischen Glasfund.

The passage from the iron to the bronze age, according to M., dates ca. Iloo B. C. In Armenia and the Caucasus iron was very rare in the 12th century B. C. In the discussion, O. Olshausen called attention to the iron ring found by P. Orsi at Castel- luccio, seemingly pre-Mycenean. Morrison (S.) The fairy child and the tailor: an Isle of Man folk-tale. (Folk- Lore, Lond., I9Io, xxI, 472-475.) Tale recorded from parish of Patrick, of child driven off by exorcisms of tailor. de Mortillet (A.) Fonderie de l'lge du bronze en Danemark. (Rev.

Hoffmann made good use of the treasures of German folk-lore, uniting often delicate understanding with folk-naivete, and some of his psychologizing of sage-motives ran ahead of modern interpretation (cf. Laistner) of myths, etc. Palmer (A. S.) The authorized version of the Bible. (Oxf. &amp; Cambr. Rev., Lond., 1911, No. 14, 29-47.)

The arms, ornaments, etc., and particularly an earthen flask, found in the graves, suggest that these Kentish Saxons may have been Jutes. In the Folkestone Museum with these relics is also a skeleton from the same place discovered in 1907, and believed to be " the only complete skeleton of a pre- Christian Saxon in any museum in the world."

Vber Stonehenge. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, I9II, XLIII, 162-173.) Discusses the theory of Schuchardt that Stonehenge is a grave, not a temple, which P. controverts, holding that the arrangement of the triliths, the orientation, the connection of folk- ceremonies (summer solstice) with Stonehenge, etc., demonstrate its char- acter as " a temple of the sun."

B. C.). They are sometimes mere ornamenta- tion, at others signs resembling writ- ing or intended as such; they had wandered to Crete from the north. Schoonjans (A.) Melk en zuivel in de volkstaal. (Volkskunde, Gent, 1911, xxII, 85-93.) Gives items of folk- lore and folk-speech concerning milk and milk-products in Flemish Bel- gium, etc. Schuchardt (C.) Stonehenge. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 191o, XLII, 963-968.) S. argues that Stonehenge (with re- lated structure) is not a solar temple, but a burial-place, resembling similar ones in ancient Greece. In the dis- cussion, W. Pastor opposed and Hr Strauch supported S.'s theory. - Ausgrabungen auf dem " Heili- gen Stadtberge" bei Sch*ningen, Colbitzow. (Ibid., 973-974.) Notes on recent excavations and finds (pot- tery fragmens Ai Slavonic, ir Teu- tonic on the high-surface; in ditch none Slavonic). Other Teutonic and Slavonic remains are distinguished. Schulte (0.) Das Kindergebet im Grossherzogthum Hessen. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Lpzg., 1911, x, I-16.) Based on questionnaire of the Hes- sian Folk-Lore Society in 1907,- numerous examples, Catholic and Protestant. Form and content, dis- tribution, etc., are discussed. Form, rhyme, figures, testify to the adult origin of children's prayers. The two types are the "thou" prayer and the recitation-formula. In these prayers the belief in angels is promi- nent. Although many prayers are common to both religions, Catholics and Protestants have their own pecu- liar ones, conforming to the different church tenets. Luise Hensel's hymn, " Miide bin ich, geh zur Ruh," has become a prayer with Catholics, and even Jews have been heard to sing this Protestant poem, which has con- quered all Hesse. Even jest has crept into some of the children's prayers. Some localities have almost characteristic prayers. Like the folk- songs, children's prayers are tending to disappear in many places. Schulten (A.) Termantia. Eine Stadt der Keltiberer. (Neue Jahrb. f. d. Klass. Alt., Lpzg., 1911, xxVII-</page><page sequence="42">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 663 xxvII, 241-276, 4 fgs., 2 maps.) Treats of Termantia, a city of the Celtiberians (sister-town of the more famous Numantia) in the interior of Spain (Old Castilian province of Soria). Situation, history, ruins are described. Schiitte (0.) Volkstiimliche Obst- und Speisenamen im Braunschweigischen. (Z. d. Ver. f. Volksk., Berlin, 19II, xxI, 276-278.) Gives folk names of fruits and foods from various parts of Brunswick. Schwerz (F.) Untersuchungen iiber das Wachstum des Menschen. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1911, N. F. X, 1-38, 19 fgs.) Gives, with many tables and curves, the results of meas- urements (stature, weight, length of trunk and limbs, circumference, length, breadth, height and indices of head, face measurements, etc.) of 1,778 (m. 960, f. 818) individuals for stature and weight and 1,245 (m. 721, f. 524) for other data, of whom all but 51 were between 6 and 20 years of age, and all from the country population of the canton of Schaff- hausen, Switzerland. Physically the type is a mixture of the immigrant, northern blond, dolichocephalic Ale- manni, and the brunette, broad-headed so-called Alpine race (predominat- ing). The head-form is hypsibrachy- cephalic (av. index 82.5) ; face meso- prosopic (index 90o.6) with strong tendency toward leptoprosopic; stat- ure av. for adult males 1694 mm. The stature-difference between the Nordic and the Alpine-Mediterranean group appears in early childhood and is not delayed till puberty,-environ- mental influences are also in evidence. Sex differences and class differences (poor and well-to-do) are noted. The nasal index diminishes with growth. Puberty occurs later in the North. Tall children have a relatively smaller head-circumference than shorter ones. In the bibliography one misses refer- ence to the Toronto (Can.) data. Sera (G. L.) Sul significato della platicefalia con speciale considera- zione della razza di Neanderthal. (Arch. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, I9Io, XL, 381-432, I pl., 13 fgs.; 1911, XLI, 4o-82, 7 fgs.) Discusses flat- tening (absolute and relative) of the vertical diameter of the skull as an individual physio-pathological fact and as a physio-pathological fact more or less diffused in an ethnic group, significance of the platy- cephaly of the Neanderthal race, zones of platycephaly and zones of glaciation, descent of man and the Neanderthal race, outlines of a gen- eral theory of the human skull, etc. Dr S.'s general conclusions are: the height of the skull is one of the most variable elements individually for physio-pathological reasons; diverse causes may be responsible for the diffusion in an ethnic group of cases of physio-pathological flattening of the skull; the platycephaly of the race of Neanderthal is not pithecoid but is well comparable to that of many ethnic groups existing to-day, and it is due probably to "a passive adaptation to glacial climate "; the platycephaly of other human groups is capable of a like explanation,- platycephaly coincides in its distribu- tion with the geographic zones of glaciation; the Gibraltar skull rep- resents the last or one of the very last of the "precursors" of man; the human skull has evolved from doli- chocephalic to brachycephalic,-this has taken place gradually. - A proposito di due recensioni del Sig. P. Bartels. (Ibid., 1911, XLI, 192-196.) Points out "inaccuracies, etc.," in Dr Bartels' review of the author's two articles on the Gibraltar skull. Sergi (S.) Mancanza congenita ed ereditaria di un incisivo. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 19Io, xv, 395-399.) Treats of a case (a young Piedmontese teacher) of con- genital lack of the upper right lateral incisor,-his father, two brothers and two sisters (all older) had the same defect, as had also an uncle (only brother of father) and the paternal grandmother. In all cases also there was a notable reduction of the left upper lateral incisor. This is prob- ably a phenomenon of transition. Smith (H. H.) A North Holland cheese market. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1910, xxI, Io5I-Io66, 17 fgs.) Brief account of cheese-market of Alkmaar. Some of the illustrations show dress, etc., of the people of the island of Walcheren.</page><page sequence="43">664 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 13, 1911 Speight (E. E.) A few Norwegian proverbs. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1911, xxII, 213-218.) Cites from various parts of Norway, with English trans- lations, 55 proverbs mainly typical of farm-life. They are in the lands- maal or country speech. Stationary population of France (The). (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 615-617, 4 fgs., 2 maps.) Resumes data in J. Bertil- ion's recent book. Stoecklin (A.) Arbeitslieder. (Korrbl. d. Schw. Ges. f. Volksk., Basel, 19II, I, 6-8.) Notes on Swiss work-songs: rising-song from the Saanental, berry- picking song from the Ziirich Ober- land, turnip-sowing song from Basel, pile-driving song, mowing-song, etc. See Rossat, A. Stiickelberg (E. A.) Die Johannis- haupter. (Schw. Arch. f. Volksk., Basel, 1910o, xI, 287-290, I fg.) Treats of the head of the decapitated John the Baptist as decorations of bowls (part of the liturgical appara- tus of the Middle Ages still surviving in certain places). These " St. John heads" were given by those suffering from severe headaches,-drinking out of the bowls was a cure. The oldest figure of a "head of St. John" appears on a seal of 1344 A. D., and all those still in existence seem to belong to the i5th and following centuries. None has yet been found in the Romance region. Most of them are now in private and public collections. The author enumerates 21 specimens. Tack (P.) De folklore in de heksen- processen te Mechlen. (Volkskunde, Gent, 1911, XXII, 5-14.) Treats of folklore in the witches' trials in Mechlin from 1544 to 1643, particu- larly during the period 1620 to 1640, -folk-medicine, sorcery, and belief in the devil. The author intends to publish a comprehensive work on the Mechlin witch-trials. Tagliaferro (N.) Prehistoric burials in a cave at Bur-meghes, near Mkabba, Malta. (Man, Lond., 1911, XI, 147- 15o.) Treats of the discovery of human remains (35 skulls have been already found) in a natural cave, together with fragments of pottery, rare pieces of flint, animal bones, etc. The pottery belongs to the age of the megalithic monuments of Malta. The corpses seem to have been "laid down horizontally on their left side, in several cases in a crouching position looking east." The skulls and sides were propped up with poles and flat stones were used to underlie or to cover the skeletons. Tschepourkovsky (E.) Anthropolo- gische Studien.. (Archiv f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 19II, N. F. X, 15I--I86, 7 fgs., 2 maps, tables.) Resumis the results of the author's measurements (made in 190oo-19o) of 8o00 skulls, 3,000 Great Russian peasant women, 2,ooo children, 500 men, 164 Russian girls, 118 Jewish boys, and 80 fam- ilies. Topics discussed are changes in the basis of the skull in the transi- tion to brachycephaly, the tendency of the basis to assume a fixed form for each race, the heredity of the index, color of hair and eyes, the resem- blance between men and women of the same race (almost twice as great as that between brother and sister, mother and son, etc.), appearance of racial characters in childhood (Io year old Jewish boys), types of the orthodox Slavic population of Great Russia (blond brachycephalic, rather tall; darker, more dolichocephalic, lower stature, longer face,-the latter a survival of primitive population of the Kurgans of the 7th to the 9th century, and probably of Finnish stock, driven eastward by the blond, brachycephalic Valdai type), etc. Van der Graft (C. C.) Christus is op- gestanden. (Volkskunde, Gent, 1911, XXII, 45-52.) Treats of the old Easter hymn " Christus is opgestand- en," still sung at the market-place in Ootmarsum (Overijsel) on Easter Sunday. The Dutch text is given on pages 50-51. Verneau (R.) La couvade en Espagne. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1911, XXII, 246-247.) Discusses the article on the couvade in Spain by Dr Aran- zadi, in Anthropos for I91o. An in- vestigation is now advisable to deter- mine whether the idea of the couvade is not altogether a myth. Dr D. J. Fuset reports its non-existence on the island of Ibiza, one of the Balearic group, where it has been said to pre- vail. Verworn (M.) Die Anfinge des Ziihlens. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f.</page><page sequence="44">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 665 Anthr., Hamburg, 1911, XLII, 53-55, 5 fgs.) Discusses the origin of count- ing with special reference to the notched bones from the reindeer- epoch of prehistoric France. Dr V. is of opinion that counting by notch- ing was already in use at that early period. -- Die Ausgrabung des neolithi- schen Dorfes bei Diemarden. (Ibid., 46-52, II fgs.) Gives result of ex- cavations of neolithic village-site of Diemarden near G6ttingen.

Viasemsky (S.) Contribution 'a 1'etude de l'anthropologie des Juifs. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1911, xxII, 197-201.) Discusses briefly the com- position of the Jewish people and their physical development, with spe- cial reference to the Slavonic coun- tries. Prince V. concludes that the long-continued and severe laws against intermarriage with foreigners "have created the atmosphere of soli- darity in which they live to-day." The most important element was brachycephalic. With rare excep- tions, the Jews have shown themselves less developed physically than the peoples among whom they dwell. Vierkandt (A.) Hat der Bauer eine eigene Naturauffassung? Eine An- frage. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Lpzg., 1911, x, 125-127.) Discusses the question whether the peasant has nature-concepts of his own, like so many primitive peoples. If he lacks such concept Dr V. is inclined to attribute it to church-influence,-a phenomenon of arrest due to the in- fluence of the higher urban culture and particularly to the teachings of the church. Dr V. desires answers to this questionnaire. Virchow (H.) tVber ein Becken mit un- gewohnlich langem Steissbein. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 622, I fg.) Note on a male pelvis with a coccyx 60 mm. long,-there are but five vertebrae, and the great length is due to the third coccygeal vertebra. -- ber einen menschlichen Schiidel von Oberhausen im Rheinland. (Ibid., 622-627, 4 fgs.)

Treats of a female pelvis (European) with a very marked Sulcus praeau- ricularis (noted by Henle in Java- nese and by Virchow in Greenland Eskimo). The cause of the pecu- liarity is still somewhat uncertain. - u. von Buchwald (G.) Fragment eines Schiidels aus einem neolithischen Begriibnisplatze. (Jbid., 191I, XLIII, 133-135, 5 fgs.) Treats of a skull from a neolithic burial-place in Ban- nerbriick, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with low flat forehead, prominent frontal bases, and large orbits, suggesting a primitive form. Pottery fragments were also found. Walker (R. J.) A fragment of Greek music. (Oxf. &amp; Cambr. Rev., Lond., 1911, No. 15, 113-119, I pl.) De- scribes a Ms. (probably subsequent to taking of Constantinople), in which over the first few lines of the first chorus of the Clouds of Aristo- phanes are written certain musical notes, given "in a miniscule modifi- cation of the characters employed in antiquity to express the notes of in- strumental music." W.'s Ms. differs here from the Messina Ms. of Kircher. Wallner (H.) Die jihrliche Verschie- bung der Bev6lkerung von der Sied- lungsgrenze durch die Almwirtschaft im Lungau. (Mitt. d. k.-k. geogr. Ges. in Wien, 1911, LIV, 358-403, 3 fgs.) Treats of the economics, soci- ology, etc., of the alm country of Lungau,-a sort of "half-nomadism in the midst of European civiliza- tion," as Ratzel styled the alp and alm cultures. Wehrhan (K.) Das Hickelspiel in Frankfurt a. M. (Z. d. Ver. f.</page><page sequence="45">666 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST IN. S.. 13, 1911 Volksk., Berlin, 1911, 234-243, 10 fgs.) Treats of "hop-scotch" and its varieties as played by the children of Frankfort on the Main. Details of the game, diagrams, etc., are given. The Frankfort name Hickel- spiel signifies "hop play." Each variety has its special name, two of which are "German circle," " French circle." Another sort is called after the snail; a fourth from the letter N, etc. -- Einige schweizerische Freimau- rer-Sagen. (Schw. Arch. f. Volksk., Basel, 191o, xIv, 295-299.)

Notes on the use of terra-cotta phallus by native wom- en of the region about Lake Tchad (Wadai, Baghirmi, Burnu). These phalli were made by women potters (at Rabah an old soldier makes them for sale, to European collectors espe- cially, but was taught their manu- facture by a woman). The women never use them alone; one acts as husband for another. Boyce (R.) The colonization of Af- rica. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 191I, x, 391-397.)

X. 9) was Guinea (West Africa),-" the Gold Coast." Dayrell (E.) The incest tabu. (Man, Lond., 1911, xI, 153-154.) Author's experience of 9 years in the Ikom district of the eastern province of Northern Nigeria leads him to be- lieve that "incest is extremely rare; it is entirely against native custom, and in the olden days would have been punished by death." Examples are given. Eichhorn (A.) Beitraige zur Keuntnis der Waschambaa (nach hinterlassen- en Aufzeichnungen von A. Kara- sek). I. (Baessler Archiv, Lpzg., u. Berlin, 1911, I, 155-222, 27 fgs.)

His- torical items and personal sketches of prominent Liberians in politics. Friedrichsen (F.) Mitteilungen fiber Forschungen in Zansibar. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 190Io, XLII, 954-955.) F. maintains that the minarets of the Mahometan mosques, in E. Africa, at least, and the peculiar ornaments on the graves of the South Arabians and their me'tis descendants, are simply more or less conventionalized sacred phallic symbols. Some of the Zanzi- bar grave-ornaments are closely rela- ted to some on the ruins of Zimbabwe in Mashona land. Garstang (J.) Second interim report on the excavations at Meroi in Ethi- opia. Part I.

If the thahu (the person becomes emaciated, breaks out into eruptions, or boils, etc.), said to have been produced by the ngoma or spirits of departed ancestors, is not removed, the person will probably die. The ceremony of the kuchiaruo ringi (to be born again), which pre- pares the child for circumcision, is described (pp. 440-442) and the circumcision ceremonial itself on pages 442-443. The Masai fashion of these ceremonies is also described with some detail.

Hoppin (J. C.) Vases and vase frag- ments found at Cyrene. (Bull. Arch. Inst. Amer., Norwood, Mass., 1911, II, 164-165.) At Cyrene Proto- Corinthian, Corinthian, and Rhodian wares were imported and "the real Cyrenaic probably followed suit as a local industry." A large number of fragments of Arretine ware were found. In a foot-note R. Norton ex- presses the opinion that "besides im- porting the true Arretine ware, the potters of Cyrene made vases of the same type and of equal beauty." Hough (W.)

One of the cases was provoked, the other spontaneous. Both women are now good Chris- tians. " Possession " is more fre- quent with women among the Baronga. Keith (A.) On certain physical char- acters of the Negroes of the Congo Free State and Nigeria. (J. R. An- throp. Inst., Lond., 1911, XLI, 40-71, 4 pls.) Treats with details of meas- urements of the stature of certain tribes (Bushongo 18 males, 2 fe- males; Basoko 11 m., 4 f.; Sango Io m.; 24 males from various regions, Azande, Momuu, Bangelime, Ban- gala, Gombe, Bula, Bapoto, etc.; and 12 females, Gombe, Bapoto, Mongwi, etc.), and 86 craniaof Batela of the region between the sources of the Sankuru and Lomami rivers,-data and skulls obtained by M. E. Torday; also measurements (by Mr P. A. Talbot) of certain tribes of the Oban district of British Nigeria (Ekoi 23 m., I f.; Korawp 13 m., 4 f.; Kabila io m.; Calabar 2 m.; Uyanga 4 m.; 3 m. from the west further beyond the Kalile) and 5 crania (3 m., 2 f.) from the Ekoi country; likewise 5 crania obtained from the delta of the Niger,-at Ogoni, near Bonny. Mr Torday's material is chiefly typical Bantu, Mr Corner's non-Bantu, while Mr Talbot's comes from a re- gion on the border-line between the Sudanese and Bantu-speaking ne- groes. The Nigerian tribes are taller than the Congolese (except that the Korawp belong in the shorter group, while the Congolese Bushongo go with the taller). The finger-reach of the Korawp is 7% greater than the stature. In stature, span, face, head, pigmentation, and nose the Ekoi and Kabila approach the negro average; the Bushongo resemble the Niam- niam rather than the Korawp; the Batetela and the Basoko are types of Congolese contrasting in head-form with the laterally compressed Ni- gerian type. The influence of Arab blood in the equatorial part of Africa has probably been exaggerated. Lang (H.) News of the Congo expe- dition. (Amer. Museum J., N. Y., 1911, XI, 191.) Note on Mangbetu.

According to Dr 0. the negrillos ob- served by him do not use the lan- guages of the peoples surrounding them. The languages of the negrillos in question are of two distinct sorts. One spoken by the tribes of the Lower Sanga, the Ngoko, the Mbimu, and the Kadei, is evidently Bantu; the other, in use among the peoples to the east of the Sanga, the Bukongo country, Lobay and Ubangi, seems to belong to an independent stock, pos- sibly the original language of the negrillos,--but it is difficult to find any traces of it in the dialects of the Bantu-speaking negrillos.

Stature, neck, length of trunk, legs and arms, head and face measurements, etc., are considered. As compared with the man of her race, the negress is not so tall as is the white woman relatively to the white man; the racial characters of the trunk are marked; the legs are longer in the negro than in the white man,-- the arms also. In the "1intermem- bral index," the negro is farther re- moved from the anthropoids and from the infantile type than is the white man; the Mundas are all quite doli- chocephalic and platyrrhine.

The maximum number of children allowed is 9. In ordinary exogamous marriage, children "be- long to the mother's totem, but in cases of civil war they act in con- junction with their father's tribe." Petrie (W. M. F.) Roman portraits in Egypt. (Ibid., 145-147, I pl.) Treats of canvas portraits of the dead, hung in a frame on the wall or over the face of the dead. The four portraits figured represent a young Egyptian with some Sudani ancestry; an old lady of the North Mediterranean type; a Syro-Egyptian; and a man probably of Moresque-Spanish an- cestry. - The excavation of Memphis. (Rec. of Past, Wash., 1911, x, 3-14, 16 fgs.) Gives account of explora- tions of Palace of Apries and Temple of Ptah, with plans, etc. On the blocks of the great gateway are de- picted scenes relating to the installa- tion of the crown prince. Among the smaller finds were part of the fittings of the royal palanquin. Also remains from Persian times (steel scale armor, seals and labels, etc.). Remains of two quartzite sandstone sanctuaries' of Amenhotep III and Amasis were found. From the for- eign quarter were obtained many terra-cotta heads (Iberian, Carian, Hebrew, Kurd). Excavations have also been carried on at Thebes, Mey- dum, etc. Poich (R.) Zur Simbabye-Frage. (Mitt. d. k.-k. Geogr. Ges. in Wien, 1911, LIV, 432-452, 4 pls., I fg.)

Die Religion der Land- schaft Moschi am Kilimandjaro. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1911, XIV, I59-2II.) Gives, from the Ms. of Yohane Msando, a Christian Tshagga teacher, valuable details on the re- ligion and mythology of the natives of the Moshi country (Tshagga) about Kilimandjaro: Spirits (ances- tral worshiped and prayed to; an- cestor-cult here is the family-society continued beyond the grave; the abode of spirits is underground: there are "spirits of the right side" and "spirits of the left side," the latter feared less); burial and dis- posal of the dead, curse of the dying; ideas about God (Ruwa),--probably more celestial than solar on the whole, and prayers to him; medicine-men (ordinary "magic " and evil "mag- ic ") and their activities. Regnault (M.) Les Babenga. Ne- grilles de la Sanga. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 191I, XXII, 261-288, map, I pl., 6 fgs.) Treats of habitat and ethnic divisions, physical characters (av. stature 1,520 mm., lowest 1,350 mm.; prognathism not very marked; pilos- ity not exceeding limit of white races; nose characteristic feature of Babenga physiognomy; arms and legs well- muscled; beard frequent; skin yel- lowish; "race-odor " marked); mu- tilations (teeth-filing, cicatricial tat- tooing, circumcision) ; material life (clothing, dwellings and camps,-- typical sort now disappearing, rec- tangular huts succeeding the round; fire and fire-making; food,--essen- tially hunters,-honey and gathered fruits, roots, etc., no agriculture, to- bacco and palm-wine obtained from neighbors; anthropophagy probable; utensils; hunt of elephant, pp. 275- 279; weapons; music and dance) ; domestic life (woman and marriage; monogamy common but not exclu- sively in vogue; birth, death; social life not very characteristic; ivory- trade; family is social unit; palavers), etc. Riitimeyer (L.) Uber einige alter- tiimliche afrikanische Waffen und Gerite und deren Beziehungen zur Priihistorie. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 240-260, 16 fgs.) Treats of African spears with bone points (rare specimens from the Jambo on the Gelo, a tributary of the Sobat in S. W. Abyssinia); lances with ante- lope-horn points from the Shilluk, etc. (cf. Herodotus' mention of the stone-pointed arrows of the Ethio- pians); throwing-boards from Darfur and the Kongo; throwing-clubs from Nigeria and North Africa and boom- erangs from Darfur, etc.; stone clubs of the Ja-Luo of Kavirondo on the Victoria Nyanza; wooden swords of the Issenghe; small wooden shields from Senegambia; stone pestles from the Sahara; fossil sea-urchins as amulets (so used in the region of Kano) (cf. similar objects from pre- historic Europe) ; soap-stone vessels of the Ababde (cf. soap-stone tobac- co-pipes of the same tribes). Accord- ing to R. the objects discussed offer clear rapprochement with the art and industries of prehistoric man, and prove for Africa not merely a stone age but other developments corre- sponding to those of man in prehis- toric Europe, etc. Some of the ob- jects (bone- and horn-pointed spears, parry-shields, wooden throwing-clubs and boomerangs) are, R. thinks, partly new members in the chains linking together the Nigritic culture of Africa with ancient Australian culture. The oldest population of North Africa was probably negroid. The implements and weapons of the sort here described represent a primi- tive African culture, the " Nigritic" of Frobenius, corresponding to the so-called "boomerang-culture " of Australia and the culture of the primitive Tasmanians. According to Foy, relics of this Nigritic culture occur especially in a belt of country stretching from the Blue Nile through the Congo region to N. Africa. Sayce (A. H.) Second interim report on the excavations at Mero&amp;. Part II. The historical results. (Ann. Arch. &amp; Anthrop., Liverpool, 19II, Iv, 53- 65.) According to Dr S., " the Mero-</page><page sequence="56">CIAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 677 itic civilization seems to have been imposed from without upon a native neolithic population." The city did not become the seat of civilization or government until the ninth century B. C. A marked influence of Greek culture occurs from the age of Erga- menes onward; this was succeeded in turn by Latin influence. After the partial destruction of Meroe in the first century A. D., "the court and priesthood themselves became more African,"-the kings married ne- gresses and their offspring grew more and more negroid. When Meroe fell, in the fourth century, A. D., "it had practically ceased to be Ethiopian (Hamitic)." See Garstang (J.). Schenk (A.) A propos des Fang. (Bull. Soc. Neuchat. de Geogr., Neu- ch tel, 19go, xx, 412-415, I pl.) Treats of the figurine surmounting the box containing the skulls of ancestors among the Fang or Pahouin of W. Africa. This fetish-box is called bieti,--a specimen is now in the Mu- seum of Natural History at Nimes. Seligmann (C. G.) An Avungura drum. (Man, Lond., 1911, XI, 17, I pl.) Note on a wooden drum in the form of a bullock or cow, taken from Yambio, the most powerful chief of the Avungura (Azande) during a punitive expedition in 1905, and now in the museum of Gordon College at Khartum. - The physical characters of the Nuba of Kordofan. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1910, XL, 505-524, 5 pls., map.) Gives observations and meas- urements, made in the spring of 191o, in southern Kordofan, of 32 males and II females from Lafofa and Eliri, 3 men from Jebel Talodi, 8 from Jebel Lumun, and 7 from the hills of Tira Akhdar. The Nuba are not a pure race, as the wide range of variation (e. g. cephalic and nasal indices) show. Mesaticephaly pre- dominates. The average stature of 32 men is 1,730 mm., of II women 1,570; average cephalic index 76.42 and 76.3. - and Murray (M. A.) Note upon an early Egyptian standard. (Man, Lond., 1911, xI, 165-171, 15 fgs.) Treats of hitherto unexplained stand- ard occurring upon the great slate palette of King Narmer found at AM. ANTH., N. S., 13-44. Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt. The authors believe that the irregularly circular, slightly bilobed object, from which depends a streamer, represents the placenta and umbilical cord,--the placenta "plays a prominent part in the cult ceremonies of the Baganda." The name of the standard (" the khenu of the king") can be trans- lated " the inside thing of the king." Note on the " Sa" sign. (Ibid., 113-117, I pl., 2 fgs.) Discusses changes and developments of form; also meaning of word sa. Originally the sa sign did represent a bundle of papyrus-stalks (cf. the bronze amulet of El Kab), but later on "it came to be regarded as representing the uterus and its appendages," as indi- cated, e. g., by the wing-like additions on each side of the main portion of the sign.

Describes, with list of articles 1-44 now in the Royal Ethnographic Mu- seum of Dresden, the equipment of an elephant-hunter among the Baia, a people of French Congo (partly also in German territory, on the Kadei), with some notes on elephant-hunting in the Cameroons. The equipment includes caps, powder-flask, flutes, bells, fly-brush, rings for arms and and legs, purses, pouches, etc., strings of amulets and various other objects, leather thongs and strings of various sorts, knife-sheath, etc. Transforma- tion of men into elephants is believed in. In the Ossidinge district the ele- phant, though a " totem-animal," is hunted. See Stumme (H.). Sladden (A. F. S.) Medical work at Cyrene, Igio-II. (Bull Arch. Inst.

Zum Kultus und Zauber- glauben der Evheer, Togo. (Baess- ler-Archiv, Lpzg. u. Berlin, 1911, I, 223-226, 277-279, 8 fgs.) Treats briefly of the legba-cult (spirit-fetish, human-like figures of clay, male and female), aklama (small, human-like wooden figures of protective spirits), "magic" for pregnant women, and the sacred azadagli stones among the Ewe of Togo-land; the dzogbeme- sikpo " house for the wife a man had before he came into this world "- a little "house" erected in the hut, to which sacrifices, etc., are offered (it is very closely connected with the sexual life); the protective fetish gbone the lower jawbone magic of gldkpedzo, etc. Stannus (H.

Nyasa, particularly those near Ft. Johnston. Physical characteristics in general, senses, etc.; astronomy; enumeration; crimes, etc. (homicide and suicide offenses; all cases heard by chiefs and head-men; punishments practically all meant payments) ; customs, salutations, etc.; disease (names, treatment, med- icines) ; circumcision and initiation ceremonies (pp. 296-298; circum- cision was not practiced by Anyanja) ; morals; religion (mzimu, or spirit, and spirit-lore) ; witchcraft (mphiti, etc.; ordeals) ; superstitions; clans (and clan-names) ; marriage and status and activities of women (child- birth, menstruation, treatment of in- fants) ; death and burial ceremonies; artificial deformations (lip-stick ; some nose piercing; ear-piercing; teeth-filing; cicatrization by both sexes; tattooing); ornaments (hair- dress, beads, necklaces, charms, amu- lets, bracelets, belts; use of pigments on body very limited); clothing (varies from nothing to European garments) ; food (maize and rice staple) ; beer from maize or millet; list of food-stuffs, p. 322; food- taboos; tobacco-smoking (intro- duced from coast) ; agriculture; cattle; hunting and fishing; fire (simple fire-drill) ; habitations and house-life; pottery and basketry (varieties listed) ; leather; dyeing (practically none); painting (out- side decoration of houses of recent origin); stone-work (no implements of stone except for grinding certain grains); metallurgy (iron; copper only in the north, Wahenga); boats (dug-out without outriggers); swim- ming (not taught; most can swim, but not fast or far) ; games (several games of the mancala type; no dice games; children's games); dances (list of 24, pp. 333-335). Staudinger (P.) Funde und Abbil- dungen von Felszeichnungen aus den alten Goldgebieten von Portugiesisch- Siidost-Afrika. (Ztschr. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19II, XLIII, 140-146, 8 fgs.) Treats of pictographs at Chikoloni in the Manu district of Portuguese Southeast Africa and at Katzombo in the Chipeta country. These picto- graphs are not "inscriptions," as some have supposed, although some others found by Wiese and Schlicht may be so in part. Among the ob- jects found under the "inscription- rocks," or in the old mines were stone hammers and pounding tools, clay "mould" (?), fragments of pottery, iron arrow-head, bronze or copper beads and hooks, gold objects, etc. According to Capt. Spring, through whom the specimens were obtained, the limits of the old " gold country" extend beyond the Zambesi to the north. To the northeast in Katanga copper was worked by the natives from time immemorial; to the south, in the Transvaal, iron and copper, and seemingly also tin. -- Bruchstiick eines west-afrikani- schen Riesensteinbeiles.

This native industry, now on the point of being driven out by the manufactures of the whites, has existed for centuries, as Dapper (whose book appeared 240 years ago) already records it. The Riruei peo- ple came from Kano and are Haus- sas. In early days the Haussa tin- smelters exported their product as far as Tripoli and the Nile, but it is doubtful if any ever went outside of Africa.

There is "a nganga for every known disease, and one for every possible emergency in native life." In the ceremonies of some ngangas, white magic is more effective than black; both are practiced by most, " the same fetish being invoked in a slightly different way." Westermarck (E.) The popular ritual of the great feast in Morocco. (Ibid., 1911, xxII, 131-182, 2 pls.) Detailed account (probably the first full study) of the great yearly sacrificial feast, on the tenth day of the month of Du'l- hijja, of the Mohammedans of Mo- rocco. The rites and customs con- nected with it are of various sorts: Practices of a purificatory or sancti- fying character, intended to prepare the people for the holy feast, and its chief feature, the sacrifice; prepara- tory practices, intended to purify or sanctify the sacrificial animal, and also the instrument with which it is to be slaughtered; the act of sacrifice itself; practices by means of which the people aim to utilize the baraka, or benign virtue, of the sacrificed victim; practices, by means of which they aim to guard themselves against, or rid themselves of, the evil influ- ences of the feast and its sacrifice. The Arabs of Morocco call it "The Great Feast," l-'idl'kbir. Notable is the prevalence of cathartic ceremo- nies, and Dr W. suggests "a possible explanation of the principal feature of it, the sacrifice, which was bor- rowed by Islam from pre-Muham- medan Arabian paganism,"-its pri- mary object may have been "to ex- pel evils which were supposed to threaten the people at the time of the year when the sacrifice took place." The ancient Arabs were great be- lievers in the magic influence of cer- tain periods. Witte (A.) Menstruation und Puber- titsfeier der Midchen im Kpandu- gebiet, Togo. (Baessler Archiv, Lpzg. u.

Treats of the caves of Bamako, Kita, Boudoufo, etc., in the French Sudan and the painted figures (most- ly red, sometimes black and white) of men, horses, animals, compart- ment-signs, feather and alphabeti- form signs, hand-silhouettes, clavi- form signs, and others, some of which may be ignorant attempts at copying Arabic inscriptions. One of the ani- mals represented is possibly a camel. While resembling in some points the cave-paintings of Europe and the Algerian rock-drawings these cave- paintings of the Sudan belong rather with " the aversion for realistic art belonging to the western basin of the Mediterranean (cf. Berber art)"- the genius of Altamira is lacking.

Physical char- acters (mitis generally fine from physical point of view; resemble European more in stature; defor- mations rare; "blue spots" in sacral region rare; skin color darker than European; blue eyes not unknown; hair on body less developed than with Europeans; mesaticephaly predomi- nates, with occasional dolichocephaly; voice more metallic than European; growth of children slower than Euro- pean, but reach and often pass the latter at puberty, 12 for girls, 14 for boys; resemblance to Europeans often very great in second generation); intellectual and moral characters (girls often exceed European in domestic labors; succeed well in school; not more immoral sexually than European children; girls make good wives; young mitis seek office; abandoned children well-treated by Anamites; defects of mitis not racial). Me'tis are quite numerous in Tonkin. Braidwood (H. S.) and Crooke (W.) A note on the meaning of " Meriah," (Man, Lond., 1911, xI, 38.) Sug- gests that meriah, applied to human sacrifice among the Khonds, is "probably the Oriyah form of the Kandh meroi, mervi, or mrivi," a human victim. Brewer (E. H.) Peculiar caves of Asia Minor. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1911, xxii, 87o-875, 5 fgs.) Brief account of visit to the ancient and modern "cone-houses " of the lUrgub region.

W.) A "blind calendar" or calendar in rebus. (Trans. As. Soc. Jap., Yokohama, 19Io, xxxvIII, 50-55, I fg.) Reproduces, with description and interpretation, "a picture of the lunar calendar of the 38th year of Meiji (1905)." The model of the rebus is fixed, the dates only being changed from year to year. This pictorial calendar is said to be very ancient in the Nambu district of northeastern Japan, and was there named Mekura-Koyomi or "blind calendar." Crahmer (W.) Uber beilartige Waf- fen im indischen Kulturgebiet. (Baessler-Archiv, Lpzg. u. Berlin, 1911, I, 135-142, 18 fgs.) Treats of bronze axe-like weapons from Java and parts of India (similar weapons appear in the cave-frescoes of Ajanta, in the Tapti valley and on Lamais- tic miniatures, in forms no longer to be found in India). The home of this weapon is somewhere in Northern India, probably Nepal; the Javanese specimens represent a cultural con- ventionalizing of a special form of these Indian weapons. Crooke (W.) King Midas and his ass's ears. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1911, XXII, 183-202.) Discusses this tale in Phrygia, Greece (still current in its original form), among the Celts (the Irish king Labradh Loingseach; "the king with the horse's ears"; Welsh tale of March Amheirchion, one of Arthur's warriors; various Breton tales), the Teutons (W.

The tale itself grew up on the basis of inability to keep secrets, the ass's ears, etc., are due to some animal-cult,-the story being afterwards "connected with a half-forgotten and misunderstood form of ritual, which prevailed throughout Asia Minor and the one subject to Mycenean culture."

According to C., the debt of the Hellenes to Babylon was at first exaggerated, but certain borrowings were undoubtedly made, such as the</page><page sequence="63">684 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 13, 1911 duodecimal and sexagesimal systems of measuring time and things, the gnomon (instrument for taking ob- servations), the knowledge of the most important data of uranography, the ecliptic, the signs of the zodiac ,and the planetal series.

Allusions to witchcraft and other primitive be- liefs in the Zoroastrian literature. (Dastur Hoshang, Mem. Vol., Bom- bay, 1911, 399-453.) Treats of sorcery and witchcraft (attitude of ancient Iranians altogether hostile to black magic; sin of witchcraft a product of the wicked creation of Ahriman); wizards, witches, kavis and karpans (the Iranian witch is more of an enchantress; various noxious creatures were thought to be born of the union of witches and wizards with demons,-also the negro); evil eye (and counter-belief in good-eye); nail-paring and hair- cutting (burial of these) ; noxious creatures (mouse, weevil, tortoise, frog, lizard, scorpion, snake, worm, ant, locust, spider, gnat, toad, louse; bear, ape, cat, wolf, hawk); miscel- laneous (taboo of night-time libations and offerings, etc.; continual fire in house of pregnant woman or new- born child; holiness of cock and cer- tain, other animals; taboo against urinating or voiding faeces while standing or walking; sacred girdle or shirt; law against talking while eating or drinking, etc.); spells and exorcisms (Airyaman prayer Ahu- naver prayer, names of Ahura Mazda, charms, etc.).

The demon Azazel is to be explained from the northwestern Arabian steppe (cf. the rock-hewn figures of demons at el-Oela, etc.). Haas (H.) Lautes und leises Beten. (Ibid., I9Io, xIII, 619-621.) Cites data concerning loud and silent prayer from the Sai-yO-shO, a work by a priest of the J6do sects of Bud- dhists in Japan, written ca. I3oo A. D. The spoken word is better, but neither is insufficient to help enter the eternal life. heard (W. B.) Notes on the Yezldis. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1911, XLI, 200-219.) Treats of history and origin (tribal myths; Sheikh 'Adi), religious beliefs, (deities of good and evil, minor deities), the last day, the 9 archangels, the creation (legends), the ark (rested on Mt. Sinjar), the seven sanjaks (clans), religious hier- archy, secret rites, birth-customs, be-' trothal (same as among Kurds), mar- riage and divorce, burial (specimen prayer), clothing (white; blue is for- bidden), fasts, exemption from mili- tary service (on account of religious taboos), the New Year, names, super- stitions (charming, etc.), Sheikh 'Adi's pilgrimage, shrines, sacred books. On pages 215-219 are given Chapters 1-5 of the Jelwet, one of the sacred books of the Yezildis, adopted from a translation of a Chaldean ecclesi- astic of Mosul, made in 1901. Huntington (E.) Physical environ- ment as a factor in the present con- dition of Turkey. (J. of Race De- velop., Worcester, Mass., 1911, 1, 460- 481.) Treats of nomadism (chief cause of present status of Turkey; Turk not permanently and inevitably a nomad); unrest and devastation on borderlands (largely due to nomad- ism); diversity of races; incompe- tence, inertia, laziness, hopelessness not necessary qualities of Turkish race, but due to physical environ- ment; religion (innate character of Turks may not be greatly inferior to that of Christians). The problem of the Turkish empire one of adapta- tion and the elimination of undesir- able qualities. Improvement of physical environment is absolutely necessary. The race is not neces- sarily bad at the core. Jacobi (H.) Der Jainismus. (Arch. f. Religsw., Lpzg., Ig9o, xIII, 615- 618.) Resumes and critiques of recent works on Jainism: Guerinot's Essai de Bibliographie Jaina (Paris, 1906) and Ripertoire d'Apigraphie Jaina (1908), Barnett's Antagada- dasdo and Anuttaro vavaiya-dasdo (London, 1907), and various mono- graphs including periodical articles by Jacobi, Suali, Belloni-Filippi, Charpentier, Satis Chandra Vidy- bhusana, Hiittemann, Hertel, Meyer, Ballini, etc. Jenkins (H. D.) A word about Turk- ish women. (Open Court, Chicago, 1911, XXV, 264-270.)

Note on a number of fire- sticks from ruined sites on the south and east of the Takla-makan desert collected by Dr M. A. Stein. (Man, Lond., 1911, xI, 34-36.) Describes and figures typical apparatus for the "twirling" method,--in all cases but one the "female" stick alone was found. These Central Asiatic fire- sticks "might, from their appearance, perfectly well have come from East Africa. J. suggests Graeco-Buddhis- tic influence in these firesticks, which from the circumstances of their find- ing, can not be of great age. Kinnosuke (A.) Christian missions in Japan. (Century Mag., N.

S., 13, 1911 (the author is "an outsider pure and simple "), and progress since. Mr. W. E. Griffis adds a comment (pp. 749- 750), in which he estimates that " at least five million Japanese see in Jesus their Master and in pure Christianity the only hope for Japan, and they more or less earnestly strive to live after his example." By way of families (the social unit), if ever, Japan will become Christian. Knosp (G.) Rapport sur une mission officielle d'6tude musicale en Indo- chine. (Intern. Arch. f.

History (Annamite music is of Chinese origin; story of invention of music according to Chinese writers, pp. 124-133), melody (music im- proves from China south; binary rhythm common, ternary rare). Pages 138-149 occupied with Annam- ite texts; pages 15o-I5I music of Annamite song. To be continued. Laufer (B.) King Tsing, the author of the Nestorian inscription. (Open Court, Chicago, 1911, xxV, 449-454.) Treats of the Nestorian missionary Adam, the character of the inscrip- tion (Buddhistic influence, aid of native scholar, etc.), literary fea- tures, etc. The inscription (dis- ,covered in 1625), "is a literary pro- duction of the highest order." The introduction of vaccination into the Far East. (Ibid., 525-531, I pl.) Describes the introduction of vaccination into China, Japan, etc., with particular reference to a color- print (reproduced and explained) by Katsugawa Shuntei, a pupil of Shun- yei, with a long inscription by Sbsai Setto,-Shuntei flourished about I8oo- 1820. The print treats of the intro- duction of vaccination into Japan, and sometime before 1850 (the print is probably posthumous) "a new deity sprang up," for in this print we have "the conception of a power- ful lucky genius, riding on a cow, and driving out, with the force of his spear, the disease of small-pox." The small-pox devil is the typical Jap- anese oni, or the Chinese kuli. v. Le Coq (A.) Sprichwbrter und Lieder aus der Gegend von Turfan mit einer dort aufgenommenen Wor- terliste. (Baessler-Archiv, Beiheft I, I9Io, iv + Ioo, I pl.) Gives native text, phonetic transcription and trans- lation of 312 East-Turkish proverbs and proverbial expressions from the region of Turfan, collected during the Central Asiatic expedition of 1905; and of 7 love-songs, 2 satirical songs, a song on women, and 3 other songs, from the same region. The vocabulary (pp. 8I-too) of words collected at Qara-Ch6dscha contains three columns to the page. The dia- lect of Turfan is not much different from Radloff's Ili dialect of Taran- tchi. According to v. Le Coq the language of Turfan neglects consid- erably vowel harmony and sometimes admits very strange combinations of consonants. For the appellation of the German Kaiser, which had begun to be used in the form gildhd'lim the author was able to substitute giydm, a transcription of the French and less liable to become corrupted. Many of the proverbs are very striking, e. g., "The hero eats the arrow, his child eats excrement," i. e. "the hero dies in battle, his child suffers from pov- erty "; "an official has neither father nor mother"; " only a fool shows his wife to another." The horse and the dog figure often in these proverbs. The explanations of words in the vocabulary contain many ethnological and folk-lore data. Mackenzie (R. D.) India's restless neighbors and the Khyber Pass. (Century Mag., N. Y., 1911, LXXXII, 675-680, 6 fgs.) Contains a few notes on the Afghans, etc. Marie (A.) La decouverte recente de deux livres sacres des Yzzidis. (An- thropos, St. Gabriel-Modling bei Wien, I911, vI, 1-39.) Native texts and translations of the Ktebi Jalweh and Mashaf Ras, two sacred Mss. of the Yezidis, the "book of revelation" and the "black book," preserved among the religious books of this sect in the library on the mountain of the Yezidis. The language of these Mss. is said to resemble ancient Kur- dish. The alphabet is of a mixed character. See Bittner (M.). Messing (0.) Vber die chinesische Staatsreligion und ihren Kultus. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19II, XLIII,</page><page sequence="66">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 687 348-375, 7 fgs.) Treats of the Chi- nese state-religion and its cult,-his- tory development, etc., from earliest times, as represented in sacred books (particularly the Shu-King, the Shi- King, and the Li-Ki), down to the present. The worship of Shangti (" Heaven "), ancestor-cult and sac- rifices, the temple of heaven (pp. 363- 373) and altar of earth in Peking. M. emphasizes the purity of the an- cient Chinese cult (no Bacchus, no Venus, no obscene characters; Yin and Yang were not popular deities, but rather philosophic theories or physical facts). Buddhism, the only foreign culture-element that hitherto has gained a firm and lasting footing in China, is responsible for develop- ments in the direction of priesthood, temples, and picture-cults. M. thinks that in the first period (ca. 2500-1200 B. C.), prehistoric and perhaps half mythical, the ideas handed down by tradition were "purely monotheis- tic"; then after the Chou period a change to a dualistic view (Heaven and Earth) occurred; and later still in the 6th century B. C., developed the still existing materialistic, or rather agnostic, view with some slight echo of monotheism. Moller (A. A.) A girls' school in Manchuria. (Parents' Rev., Lond., 1911, xxII, 224-226.) Notes of visit to girls' school in the inland town of Hsin Min Fu. The girls probably "compare favorably with girls of a similar age in English schools." Mueller (H.) tber das taoistische Pantheon der Chinesen, seine Grund- lagen und seine historische Entwick- lung. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 393-428, 18 fgs.) Treats of the origin and development of the Taoist Pantheon of the Chinese, as distinct from the family-pantheon and the Buddhistic and Lamaistic pan- theons. Terms (Tao, Yin and Yang, etc.) ; the development of the Pan- theon,-the old religion, the Yi-king, Lao-tze, Taoism of the Han-period (golden age), the T'ien-shih (par- ticularly Chang-tao-ling), Buddhism, foreign religions, Persian influences, Manichaean-Taoistic influences, the montheistic religions, further devel- opment), the Taoistic Pantheon in its present form (sources, classification of the gods,-nature-deities, personi- fication of ideas, deification of pre- historic or protohistoric personalities, deifications from the historical period, Buddhistic figures which have made their way into the Chinese Pantheon; Feng-sheu; the Pantheon of the Feng-sheu-yen-yi, etc.). Miiller (W.) Japanisches Midchen- und Knabenfest. (Ibid., 568-580, 6 fgs.) Treats of the Japanese "girls' festival," celebrated on the third day of the third month (pp. 570-576) and the "boys' festival," celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month. The reaction of Japan against too much Occidentalization is revealed in one way in the attention given to "the five festivals,"-the other three are the Jinjitsu or Nanakusa, the Tana- bata, and the Choyo festivals. Nilsson (M. P.) Ariernas fdrsta upp- tradande i frimre Asien. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1911, xxxI, 153-167, map.) Resumes data (from recent works of E. Meyer, H.

Dis- cusses the question of the location of the Sinai of the Bible,-views of Burckhardt, Lepsius, Ritter, Tischen- dorf, Beke, Burton, Gritz, Stade, Wellhausen, Miketta, Gunkel, Meyer, Haupt, Musil, etc. Prof. O. thinks that the recent researches of Musil and Kober have probably made it certain that the Sinai of the Bible was the volcano Hala-l-Bedr, near N. lat. 270 and W. long. 370. This upsets the theory of the wanderings of the Israelites in the Sinai Peninsula. O'Brien (A. J.) Mianwali folk-lore notes. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1911, XXII, 73-77.) Notes on " rain-mak- ing," prejudices against shooting by women, and by husbands of women with child, "evil eye," etc., among Panjab chuprassis (doorkeepers). Offord (J.) A Hittite bronze statuette.

Treats of the HE- miao or "black barbarians,"-tribal divisions, dress, occupations (agri- culture), marriage (daughter of sis- ter marries son of brother), funerals, totemism, political regime, literature (songs and recitatives), traditions (myths of the origin of -man, cos- mogonic ideas, deluge, virgin birth), vocabulary (lists of 75 words in HE- miao and PE-miao; tribes related to the HE-miao) (the Tsin-miao; Ja-tse- miao or Ja-ki-miao,-account of duck-breeding, whence the name; Ka6-p6-miao or mountaineers) ; tribes related to the KE-teou-miao (the Ke- tang, Chouy-sy-miao, Yang-hoang- miao); doubtful tribes (the Ts&amp;- kiang-miao, Kiou-kou-miao, Yang- pao-miao, Yi6-miao, Tsin-teou-miao, Hoa-teou-miao, Tong-miao or troglo- dytes, Sy-miao or "western barba- rians," Tong-miao or eastern barba-</page><page sequence="68">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 689 rians, Tong-jen, etc.); mixed Miao tribes (Long-kia-tse, Tsay-kia-tse, Song-kia-tse, etc.). The Miao are the autochthones of Kwe-Chow. The author thinks they are too subjected to have any future than a subordi- nate one. Shakespear (J.) Notes on the iron workers of Manipur and the annual festivals in honor of their special deity Khumlangba. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1910, XL, 349-359, I fg.) Describes smelting, forging, and the annual festival or La-harauba (pleas- ing the god). Khumlangba is rep- resented by "a piece of iron a few inches square." In the ceremonies figure the aged priestess who gets Khumlangba, the penna or fiddle players, the Lai-pham (or God's place), the fire-kindling and offer- ings of rice, fishes, etc., invocation and offerings of fruit and vegetables, procession, dances, visit to shrine in market-place, prayers, dances of various sorts, a dramatic performance (goddess, comic man, etc.) ,-the rites last for 4 days. The parade of en- gaged couples is not an actual part of the Lai-harauba. What occurs after the obeisance and prayer clos- ing the important ceremonies, does not matter. Sing (S. N.) India's " untouchables." (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1911, XL, 279-290, 5 fgs.) Treats of the "low caste" natives, particularly in Martinpur, settled some ten years ago by some seventy Indian Chris- tian families,-" all of the native Christians of the little town are either pariah converts, or the direct descendants of 'untouchables'; but not one of them follows the hered- itary profession of his forefathers." The progress made is notable. - The work of the Pundita Rama- bai. (Ibid., 562-571, 6 fgs.) Treats of the work of the Mukti Mission at Kedgaon, near Poona, in the Bombay Presidency, where Bible study and industrial training of girls are com- bined. - Boys in India, at home and at school. (Ibid., 14-22, 7 frs.) Treats of home-life (" no easier than school- life"), hours and punishments, vaca- tions, dress, religious ceremonies, marriage (pp. 18-20), plays and games, the "monkey-man," juvenile crime, etc. Smith (M. L.) and Tod (M. N.) Greek inscriptions from Asia Minor. (Ann. Arch. and Anthrop., Liver- pool, 1911, IV, 35-44, I pl.)

Smith (R. A.) The stone age in Chinese Turkestan. (Man, Lond., 1911, XI, 81-83, I pl., I fg.) Treats of worked stones (mostly jasper), in- cluding two jade celts and three arrowheads, collected from the Lop- nor desert by Dr M. A. Stein in 19o6-1908. S. suggests comparison with the diminutive tools of obsid- ian, etc., from the kitchen-middens of Japan, specimens from Hakodate, etc., and thinks that "some connec- tion with the extreme east of Asia is not altogether out of the question." Starr (F.) Japanese riddles. (Trans. As. Soc. Jap., Yokohama, IgIo, xxxvIII, 1-49, 5 fgs., bibl.) General discussion of Japanese nazo, etc., with numerous examples (pp. 14-50) in Japanese and English versions. In Japanese occurs the nazo (includ- ing the true nazo analogous to a cer- tain type of conundrum; children's nazo, approaching the true riddle; and self-evident nazo) and ehanji (rebus and pictures). Prof. S.'s col- lection now includes over 8oo0 nazo. See also his article on "The rebus and its kin in Japan" in The Jap- anese Magazine for June, 19Io. - Lolo objects in the Public Mu- seum, Milwaukee. (Bull. Publ. Mus. Milw., 1911, I, 209-220, 8 pls.) De- scribes and figures articles of dress (cape, skirt, jacket, trousers, cap) and ornament (neckband, ring), carry-net, pipe, bow and arrows, quiver, bowstring, wristguard, sword, scabbard, cuirass, jew-harps, musical pipes. Plates 4-8 contain photo- graphs of Lolos. These specimens probably "the only Lolo objects in the United States" were obtained, during his stay in Sechuen 1899- 1903, by Mr O. L. Stratton. from whom they were acquired by the Museum. To Mr S.'s brief notes of</page><page sequence="69">690 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 13, 1911 his experiences Prof. S. adds some ethnological items. The "non-Mon- golian" appearance of the Lolos is emphasized. Stone (M. B.) Race prejudice in the Far East. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., I9Io, xxI, 973-985, 6 fgs.) Treats of actions and attitudes of Europeans, etc., towards Asiatics. In face of the danger of Asiatic ethnic solidarity, "it is not the Asian who needs educating; it is the Euro- pean." S6me of the. illustrations are of ethnologic interest. Stuinner (H.) Ein brahmanisches Weltsystem. (Baessler-Archiv, Lpzg. u. Berlin, 19II, I, 119-134, 3 pls.) Treats of a water-color copy of a picture (the original is in the Li- brary of Tanjore) representing the Brahmanic world system, now in the Berlin Ethnological Museum. The picture is of South Indian origin and the deity concerned is Vishnu. Heav- en, the human world, and hell are rep- resented. The picture and its divi- sions are discussed in detail. The variety and complexity of the subject is very striking. Strange fate of idols. (Open Court, Chicago, 19II, xxV, 699-701, 2 fgs.) Brief account of two Hindu idols (made by Christian artists, and rep- resenting St. Anne with her infant on her knees, and the Virgin at the moment of the Annunciation), now both worshiped in the old pagan fashion at Chandor in the Nasik dis- trict, India. Strzoda (W.) Die Li auf Hainan und ihre Beziehungen zum asiatischen Kontinent. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19II, XLIII, 193-236.) Treats of the Li of the island of Hainan, China. History (first notices of Hainan 2o6 B. C.-25 A. D., during earlier Han dynasty), population, name, cosmog- ony and mythology (point toward Cochin China), tribal divisions and nomenclature (some 15 or 16 different Li-peoples), physical and mental characters (reports quite discordant), government and social arrangements, bodily deformations (distension of ears, perforation of nose,--customs prevailing in Farther India; tattooing of women only), customs and usages (spring-festival; marriage-rites, blood- revenge; offerings to evil-spirits for the sick), dress and ornament, dwellings (toward the interior the prevailing type is more and more like the Malay pile-dwelling), hunting and weapons (knife, spear, bow and arrow), agriculture. The Hainan Miao live some 40 miles from the west coast, between Chinese and Loi. The Li languages and their relation to those of the continent are dis- cussed (pp. 214-217) and vocabu- laries given (pp. 222-236) of 13 Hainan languages compared with Miao-tze, Pan-yao, Mo-yao, Siamese, and Annamese. On pages 218-221 grammatical items are given. The Li dialects are probably related to Siamese, etc., and the ancestors of these people in Hainan formerly dwelt somewhere in W. Annam or Siam. Ethnologic no less than lin- guistic data suggest this. Suali (L.) Esiste una filologia in- diana? (Scientia, Bologna, 1911, x, No. 4, 352-369; also French resume, 191-211.) Discusses recent works on Hindu literature and language (Jacobi, Barth, Grierson, Fausb6ll, Oldenberg, Garbe, Franke, etc.). S. takes an optimistic view of the status of Indian philology, and looks for- ward to an approaching renaissance of science in India. Trotzig (I.) Ur Japans sagoviirld.

Le premier pasteur pro- testant hindou. (Revue Anthrop., Paris, 19II, xxI, 189-I9I, I fg.) Reproduces from an original drawing of 1744 a portrait of "Rev. Aaron," born in Goudelour in 1695, ordained at Tranquebar, in 1733, "1the first Protestant Hindu minister." The open Bible in his hands is intended to display Acts XI, 18 in Greek and Tamil. Virchow (H.) Ober die Weichteile des Chinesinnenfusses. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19II, XLII, 375.) Note on anatomical examination of the feet of a 63 years' old Chinese woman. De- tails to be published later. Waddell (L. A.) A note on the der- ivation of Miri. (Man, Lond., 1911, xI, 86.) Argues that the tribal name</page><page sequence="70">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 69I of the Miri of Assam means "hill- men"; they call themselves Mishing, " men of the soil,"-mi is the Tibetan word for "man," and "is found with this meaning amongst most of the Himalayan tribes from Ladak down to Assam." W. considers the Miri " a typically Mongoloid people." Weissenberg (S.) Die syrischen Juden anthropologisch betrachtet. (Ztschr. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 80-90, 4 fgs.) Treats of anthropological characters of Syrian Jews. Tables of measurements and descriptions of types, etc., of 30 males from Damas- cus and Io males and io females from Aleppo are given. The Damascus Jews are taller (av. 1663 mm.) than those of Aleppo (av. 1645), longer- headed (indexes av. 80 and 84.3), shorter-faced and more " Semitic" in nose-type. Syria never was a "pure- Jew" country; the Aleppo Jews are more mixed (Spanish blood, etc.). -- Die mesopotamischen Juden in anthropologischer Beziehung. (Archiv f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 19II, N. F. X, 233-239.) Gives results of observa- tion, with detailed measurements (height, finger-reach, head and face) of 49 Mesopotamian Jews (18 men from Urfa, 5 from Bagdad, 14 from Kurdistan; 12 women from Urfa, Bagdad, Diarbekr, and Mosul.) Ac- cording to Dr S., the Mesopotamian Jew is below middle height, with moderate head-circumference and index about 78. Dolichocephaly (rarest in Kurdistan) appears in about I3.5 %. The face is very long (longest in Bagdad) ; the nose nar- row and long and in i of the cases "Semitic" in form. Blondness is rare, some # being brunette. The Jews in Mesopotamia number still some 60,00ooo. They speak Arabic, some from Diarbekr Kurdish, while Aramaic is said to be still used in a few villages of Kurdistan. It is pos- sible that some are relics of the ten tribes taken captive to Babylon. Williams (M. E.) Hittite archives from Boghaz Keui, arranged in chro- nological order. (Ann. Arch. and Anthrop.., Liverpool, 19II, IV, 90- 98.) Gives 23 items translated-from the German transcripts of Dr Winck- ler in the Mitt. d. D. Orient-Ges., No. 35, Dec., 1907. Wilson (E. H.) The kingdom of Flowers: China. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1911, XXII, 1003-1035, 24 fgs.) Gives an account of "the wealth of trees and shrubs of China," etc. Some of the illustrations (votive- offering on tree, temples, timber and tea carriers, rock-cave, etc.) are of ethnologic interest. On page 1022 is noted "our debt to China's gar- dens." Wingate (J. S.) Armenian folk-tales. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1910, xxI, 507- 511; 1911, XXII, 77-80.)

Treats of the rougher local products among the specimens brought back by Dr M. A. Stein from his explorations of ancient sites (Mingoi near Kara-shahr, 6th-9th centuries A. D.; Miran, ca. 9th century A. D.; Lop Nor; Yotkan; Akterek; So- yung-cheng, etc.) in Chinese Turkes- tan and westernmost China. At Yotkan the Gandhara influence is marked, although purely Chinese motives of decoration sometimes oc- cur; Akterek shows numerous anal- ogies (e. g. glazed handles of the shape common on Roman lamps). Wright (A. R.) Chinese tree-worship and trial by ordeal. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1911, XXII, 233-234, I pl.) Note on case of tree-worship near the city of Yung-Ping-Fu, province of Chihli.

T.) A country fair in Moro- land. (Century Mag., N. Y., 1911, LXXXII, 681-685, 3 fgs.) Describes Moro fair and fiesta held at Cota- bato,-the " First Moro Agricultural and Industrial Fair." Exhibits from the Buldom Plateau, Maguindanao, from the pagan Monobos, Bilans, Tiruray, etc., were on view. Many chiefs were present from various parts of the country. The Tiruray dancing girls, Moro girls, etc., were attrac- tions. Brown (G.) A secret society of ghoul- cannibals. (Man, Lond., 191I, XI, 68- 69.) Brief description of the kipkipto (initiation; eating of flesh stripped from dead bodies) society of the re- gion about Bom and Eratubu on the west coast of New Ireland.

The vowel a is also subject to similar harmonic change. - Monosyllabic roots in Pampanga. (Journ. Amer. Orient. Soc., N. Y., I9II, xxxI, 389-394.) Pampanga shows a number of monosyllabic roots, due to contraction from the corre- sponding Indonesian dissyllabic forms (a list of 35 is given). The author zotes "an instructive tendency to restore the dissyllabic character of the affected words which, as mono- syllables, were felt to be incomplete, by prefixing a colorless vowel, gen- erally a." Pampanga shows "a vari- ety of striking phonological pecu- liarities not shared by its neighbor (Tagalog) ." Dempwolff (0.) Sagen und Miirchen aus Bilibili. (Baessler-Archiv, Lpzg. u. Berlin, 191I, I, 64-102.) Native texts with translations of Io tales and legends (2 totemic tales, a savior- legend,-7 minor tales of the sky- woman, the flute-player, origin of coconut, fire, kava, tobacco, why dogs do not speak any more) obtained in March-April, 1906 from an 18-year old man from Bilihili (Astrolabe Bay, Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, German New Guinea). Totemism is here under- stood as "belief in relationship with, or descent from, animals (e. g., as here, crocodile and pig). Kilibob and Manumbu, the brothers, figure as saviors; fire was obtained from the pudenda of an old woman; tobac- co came from the stars; the coconut grew up from the skull of an old dwarf. E. W.

Zur Stellung der Tasmanier im anthropologischen Sys- tem. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLIII, 287-289.) Critique of article of H. Basedow in previous volume on the Tasmanian skull as an insular type. According to Dr v. L. the Tas- manians are Melanesian, not Austra- lian, although both these of course have the same ancestors. The spiral hair-form may have first arisen among the pigmies and may, indeed, be somewhat connected mechanically with dwarf-growth. See also re- marks of Klaatsch on pages 291-292. I- ber Pygmaien in Melanesien. (Ibid., IgI9, 939-945, 2 fgs.) Dis- cusses the question of pigmies in Melanesia (certain skeletal remains indicate the former existence of small- statured people on the Admiralty Is.; in various parts of New Guinea liv- ing pigmies have been met,-on the Gogol by Lauterbach, on the central Ramu by the German expedition of 1896, among the Kai by P6ch and Neuhauss, etc.). According to Dr v. L., a very small skull from the Kaiserin-Augusta River and certain small skulls from New Ireland and New Britain are those of pigmies. He is of opinion that pigmies, wherever found, are merely local stature-varieties of man, fixed racially by long isolation, retaining subse- quently in changed environment their acquired characters. - Zur Ethnographie des Kaiserin- Augusta-Flusses.

Wahrsagekalender (kuti- k&amp;) im Leben der Malaien Zentral- Sumatras. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1910, XLII, 750-775, I pl., 21 fgs.) Treats in detail, with facsimile Ms., of the kutika or divinatory calendars of the Malays of Central Sumatra, their varieties, use, etc. The two chief varieties are the five-sectioned and the seven-sectioned. The word kutika is of Sanskrit origin. The author's collection of kutikas came from Taluk on the Kuantan and Gunung Sahilan on the Kampar Kiri. Hindu influence is marked. Mathews (R. H.) Matrilineal descent in the Kaiabara tribe, Queensland. (Man, Lond., 19II, xI, o100-103.)

Die Schiffahrt bei den Bewohnern von Vuatom, Neu-Pom- mern, Siidsee. (Baessler-Archiv, Lpzg. u. Berlin, 19II, I, 257-268, I pl., 21 fgs.) Treats in detail of the manufacture, equipment, ornament, use, etc., of vessels among the natives of Vuatom (New Pomerania) in the South Pacific: Rafts (of bamboo, banana-stems, etc.), toy-boats (of coconut shells, leaves), outliers, in- struments used, progress of work and " magic" (songs, etc.) employed, paddles, masts, sails, etc., canoes in ceremonial and art. The natives of Vuatom are skilful navigators. Boys of seven know how to paddle and steer; women show less ability in managing boats. Modigliani (E.) Il tatuaggio degli indigeni dell' Is.

Treats of tattooing (with males a sign of right to sit in meetings, etc.; with women mere ornament) among the natives of Sipora, one of the islands of the Mentawei group, off the coast of Sumatra. The native names of all the lines, etc., are given. Volz is wrong in thinking that recondite meanings are hidden in these terms. Mentawei tattooing fol- lows the anatomical lines of the body. Moszkowski (M.) Die V61kerstimme am Mamberamo in Hollindisch-Neu- guinea und auf den vorgelagerten Inseln. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, I9II, XLIII, 315-346, 8 fgs.) Treats of the coastal and inland tribes of the river Mamberamo, etc., in Dutch New Guinea. Coastal tribes' situation, migrations, physical characters (cer- tain things suggest the Veddas and wild tribes of Farther India,--hair, small stature, bony structure, short limbs, convex upper lip, etc.), lan- guages (those of coast tribes Malayo- Polynesian; the interior tribes Pap- uan), temperament and imagina- tion (great liars and gesturers), in- telligence and desire for knowledge (very inquisitive; interested in Euro- pean languages and clever at repeat- ing words), clothing and ornament (tattooing among coast-tribes only), origin-legend (human ancestor a great fish), totemism, marriage-cus- toms, religion (good and evil spirit; culture-hero tale of coast-tribes, etc.), songs and dances (Papuans have marked dramatic sense; amulets con- secrated in dances at the full moon), trade, hunting (pigs, cassowaries, etc.), food and its preparation. In- land tribes taller and more power- fully built; art-sense rude as com- pared with tribes of the Augusta River; paddle unknown generally on south river; r61le of women more im- portant than among coast tribes; food-differences between the sexes; homosexual orgies of " men's house "; imitation of boys with festival in " men's house," etc. In the discus- sion Hr Neuhauss suggested mis- sionary influence in the culture-hero legends and the flood-myth and Hr W.

Reports prog- ress under date of July 25, I9Io, from the mouth of the Maniberamo. A vocabulary, of 6oo words of the Kamboi Ramboi Koassa and data concerning their religion, festivals, customs, etc., were obtained. The deities Mangossi (creator and ruler of the dead) and Sinombi (evil spirit) of the coast tribes (pp. 949-950) are not known to the inland peoples; the moon-cult of the coast tribes has de- veloped into a religion. Amulets are much in use.

Physical characters (broader-skulled than the taller tribes, very small hands and feet, short and broad ear, convexity of upper-lip part), etc. The Pigmies of New Guinea are not a mere chance phe- nomenon (they have a r8le in myth and story); they are not a product of "misery." At pages 282-285 the hair of the Papuans is discussed,- form, color, etc. (artificial coloring is known). The frequent occurrence of blond hair among Papuans, accord- ing to N., separates them from the African Negro, whom they resemble so closely in some other hair-charac- ters. In the discussion Fritsch pointed out that the resemblance of the hairs of human races of the same hair- type (there are only 3 hair-types) is often astonishing, although these races may not belong to one and the same "human race," as generally understood. - Reise nach Deutsch-Neu Guinea. (Ibid., 1911, XLIII, 130-132.) Notes on visit to Kaiser Wilhelmsland in 19o8-I9Io. N. brought back with him hundreds of photographs of natives, etc. The results of the expe- dition will shortly be published in 3 large volumes. The most remarkal'le obj ct hitherto reported from New Guinea is a small figure of hard green stone exceeding in technique all other stone objects from this region, but altogether Papuan. The green stoue is found at Huon Gulf, wher-: t he figure was used for "magical" pur- poses. See also p. I4o. Kinematographische und phono- graphische Aufnahmen aus Deutsch- Neuguinea.

Raymund (P.) Die Faden- und Ab- nehmespiele auf Palau. (Anthropos, St. Gabriel-M6dling bei Wien, I9II, VI, 40-61, Io pls., 86 fgs.) Briefly describes with names and reproduc- tions 76 (and a number of sub- varieties) string-figures, etc., known among the children of the Pelew Is. natives as chalidebdol, i. e. " gift of the chalid (spirits or higher beings)." Nos. 1-12 are played by two people,. the rest by one. Tales go with these: games. Among the figures are:house,. tortoise, crab, various fruits, stars, clouds, fishes, flies, souls, baskets, various birds, women and men at work, sun, plantation, birds in nest, war, peace, etc. In a number of these figures several things are representedl at once.

The richness of animal-plays is note- worthy, scarcely any important ani- mal is omitted (the significance of animals for the natives and a deep nature-feeling account for this). Many hunting games are merely imi- tations of the hunt, e. g., in Mib't. Planting-games which are very common and much liked are not so much in vogue as animal and hunting-games. The dance-games are not numerous (almost all have songs) but the chil- dren are very fond of them. The fire-games result from the high re- spect in which fire is held among these tribes. The games in the sand and water offer many points of con- tact with those of European children at the seashore. The children have A marked tendency to invent new games (one invented in 19o6 is noted on p. 253). Genuine girls' games are very rare (even domestic, or house- hold ones). Games of adults seem unknown, but they sometimes partici- pate in those of the children. Most games belong to certain seasons, months, etc. Evening (a moonlight night is ideal) is the preferred time for play. Schlaginhaufen (0.) Uber Siede- lungsverhiltnisse in Siid-Neumeck- lenburg. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, I9Io, XLII, 822-829, 3 fgs.) Treats of the form of dwellings and their group- ing in villages at Tamm in the Mu- liama district of New Mecklenburg, observed at three different intervals. The typical hut is oval, but rectangu- lar also occur. The dwelling-houses are one for each family. There are also cooking-houses, "men's houses," storehouses, boat-houses, etc. Nearby is the grave-yard. Considerable changes sometimes take place within a short time. Schmidt (W.) Die tasmanischen Worte zur Bezeichnung archriolithischer Werkzeuge. (Ibid., 915-919.) Dis- cusses the etymologies of Noetling (see Amer. Anthrop., 1909, N.

They are said to be "of most unusual and hitherto un- known shape." Worcester (D. C.) Field sports among the wild men of Northern Luzon. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1911, XXII, 215-267, 53 fgs.) Treats of fermented drinks, keeping the head- hunters in good humor, the bird- dance of the Benguet-Lepanto Igorots, wild dances of Bontoc, wrestling, Bontoc slapping-game, foot-races, greased-pole contest, tug-of-war, nose- flute, Ifugao dances, etc. Some of these games and sports have been introduced by the Americans. AMERICA Abel (A. H.) The Indians in the Civil War. (Amer. Histor. Rev., N. Y., 1910, xv, 281-296.) There were divi- sions among the Indians of the Indian Territory, etc.,--the Comanches, Sem- inoles, and Creeks split into two fac- tions. Sometimes a single tribe went for the South. The Choctaws were pro-slavery and the Chickasaws went over to the South. Activities of the Anthropological De- partment of the Field Museum of Natural History. (Amer. Anthrop., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, N. S., xIII, 168- 169.) Adan (E.) Las danzas de Coatetelco. (An. Mus. Nac. de Arqueol., Mexico, 1910-1911, II, 133-194, 7 pls.) Treats of the dances held at Coatetelco in. the Tetecala district of the. State of Morelos in connection with the festi- val of the Virgin of Candelaria, the last Sunday of January, on the shore of the lake of Coatetelco. There are several dances by children from 7 to 15 years of age, having no recitative or dramatic element. The " Los Vaqueros" dance (music and texts of the three parts are given on pages. 144-177) is a dramatic piece treating of the customs, etc., of the Indian vaqueros. On pages 177-183 are given music and text of a briefer dramatic dance, " Los Moros," con- cerned with the struggle between the Moors and the Christians and the vic- tory of the latter. The dramatic- dance, called "Los Tecuanes" (pp. 183-190) is given in mixed Aztec and Spanish. On pages 191-194 the author compares these modern dances with those of the ancient Aztecs, of which they are "degenerations," but of which they have preserved many interesting features. These Indians, now very mixed, are the descendants of the Aztec tribe of the Tlahuicas. The Virgin of Candelaria is looked upon as the titular divinity of the lake, and festivals are held to prevent it drying up. Allen (A. R.)

Sistema silibico en las lenguas de la familia Mixteco-Zapo- teca-Otomi. (An. Mus. Nac. de Arqueol., Mexico, 1910-1911, II, 264- 271.) Treats of the syllabic system of Chatino, Chinantec, Papabuco, Amuzgo, Mixtec, Cuicatec, Mazatec, Popoloca, Otomi. These languages all present only apparent monosyl- labism and Najera is wrong in think- ing that real monosyllabism is their chief characteristic. No one of the tongues of the group in question can be said to be truly a "monosyllabic " or " isolating " language. Monosyllab- ism here is largely due to shortening. Beuchat (H.) et Rivet (P.) La fa- mille betoya ou tucano. (Mem. Soc. de Ling. de Paris, 1911, XVII, 117- 164.) Treats of the Betoyan (Tu- cano) family, with bibliography, comparative vocabulary, grammatical sketches, and texts. The authors rec- ognize a western, a northern, and an eastern group,-tribal lists for each are given (pp. 3-14). For the west- ern group vocabularies (Tama, Cor- reguaje, Proje, Encabellado, and Icaguate), texts (Pater Noster from Brinton and Teza; Sign of the Cross, Pater Noster, Ave Maria, Credo, and Christian Doctrine, from Gonzalez Suarez), and grammatical sketch, with additions to Brinton; the north- ern group is represented by the brief Betoya vocabulary of Hervas and the Pater Noster of Adelung,-to which are added (after F. Miiller) some grammatical notes. On pages 42-48 the authors discuss the possible rela- tionship of the Betoyan with other stocks, especially the Chibchan, and find evidence enough to convince them that the language called Betoya (hitherto considered the northern rep- resentative of the stock) should be classed as Chibchan, thus removing it from the so-called Betoyan stock altogether. For the western and eastern groups (Tucano, etc.) ,-the last have been recently studied by Koch-Griinberg, the name "Tucano family" is suggested (p. 164). - Affinitis des langues du sud de la Colombie et du nord de l'equateur. Groupes Paniquita, Coconuco et Bar- bacoa. (Musion, Louvain, 191o. Extr. 1-94.) Discusses the gram- matical and lexicological relation- ships of the Paniquitan, Coconucan, and Barbacoan languages with one another and with Chibchan. At pp. 9-20 is a comparative vocabulary of Barbacoan, Paniquitan, and Coconu- can; at pp. 45-60 a comparative vocabulary of Barbacoan-Coconucan- Paniquitan and Chibchan (gram- matical resemblances with Chibchan are considered at pp. 61-86). Re- semblances with Quichuan, Chocoan, etc., are also discussed. The authors are of opinion that the Paniquitan, Coconucan, and Barbacoan tongues belong to the Chibchan stock,--the Barbacoan going with the Talamanca and related group, the Paniquitan and Coconucan forming another group together. The most developed languages of the Chibchan stock are the Chibcha and Paez; among the most primitive is the Colorado, which</page><page sequence="78">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 699 has "an astonishing resemblance to the Talamanca."

(Arch. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 191I, N. F. X, 39-42, 27 fgs.) Treats of the eye in ancient Mexican symbolism (the various Codices, etc.). The eye appears as a star; conventionalized eyes as hair and breast ornaments, etc.; eye rep- resents death and night so closely related to it; west is represented by the star-eye, being the region of night; " eye of darkness " found else- where in connection with the gods; eye as light or fire, also life, and chalchiuitl. - Der 28tiigige Monat der alten Mexikaner.

Blanchard (R.) Encore sur les tab- leaux de mitissage de Mexique. (J. Soc. d. Amer. de Paris, 191o [I9II], N. s., VII, 37-60, 9 pls., 5 fgs.) B. con- tinues his interesting and valuable discussion of the me'tissage-pictures in the Museum of Mexico and of the terms applied to the representatives of the various mixtures of white with Indian and negro or both. In the Mexican Museum are a series of paintings of " castas de Mexico, epoca colonial," and a large canvas in 16 compartments, dealing with the like subject; in the Paris Museum are other paintings, which, with those of the Mexican Museum, are probably due to Ignacio de Castro, by whom the large canvas was hardly executed. The list of degrees of me'tissage is discussed with some detail by Dr B., with references to the work of J. J. Virey, Hist. Nat. du Gefre humain (Paris, au IX; 2e ed., 1824), in which a list is given; and to the sec- tion on mestizos (table of "castas" given) in A. L. Herrera and R. E. Cicero's Catdlogo de la Collecidn de Antropologia del Museo Nacional (Mexico, 1895). In the Museum of Madrid are likewise 18 pictures (from Peru) relating to these metissage (one is reproduced on p. 57). The 16 paintings and the one large canvas in the Mexican Museum are repro- duced in this article. Dr B. concludes that there is a great lack of precision about some of the terms used to de- note degrees of metissage.

The build- ings of Alta Vista are unornamented, but many of the specimens found are profusely ornamented. According to Sr G., the ruins of Alta Vista are closely related to those of La Que- mada, etc. They also "constitute the northern limit of structures with dis- tinctive architectonic features (stair- ways, columns, etc.), whose relations are with the buildings of Central, South and Southeastern Mexico." In other words, "they form a real tran- sition between the North and the South "-influences of "Pueblo" cul- ture are recognizable. Gann (T. W.) Exploration carried on in British Honduras during 1908-9. (Ann. Arch. &amp; Anthr., Liverpool, 1911, IV, 72-87, 3 pls.)

Three kinds of burial seem to have been practiced (from poorest class to priests and chiefs, etc.,-the grave-gifts increasing in number and in value). On Wild Cane Cay a copper ornament (" if not a head of Christ, undoubtedly a Christian symbol "), indicating Span- ish influence, was found. At Boston was located a principal center for the manufacture of stone implements and weapons. Sarteneja was the site of a considerable pottery manufactory, several small mounds there being composed entirely of potsherds. Near Morales was found a "Santo," or Indian idol of stone.

The greater include the high pedestal group, the low pedestal group, the zoomorphic group, the group without pedestal; the lesser monuments consist of three specimens found near together in the Cere-</page><page sequence="84">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 705 monial Plaza. At Quirigua "the per- fect chastity of all the sculptures is noteworthy," and there is an " ab- sence of war implements and scenes of combat" as well as also "an entire absence of scenes of sacrifice, cruelty or bloodshed." The figure of the Great Turtle at Quirigua "is un- doubtedly the crowning achievement of a native American sculpture, so far as is now known." Stela E. of Mandslay is "the largest shaft in the whole Maya land." In the minor ruins outside of Quirigua proper some interesting discoveries may yet be made. Highstone (L. S.)

The theater is a natural one. The play, in Ojibwa, lasts four or five hours. Hillman (L.) One of the Seneca stories. (Red Man, Carlisle, Pa., 1911, III, 25.)

Report on the ethnol- ogy of the OkanLk'kn of British Co- lumbia, an interior division of the Salish stock. (J. R. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1911, XLI, 130-161.) Treats of habitat, tribal divisions (formerly Io permanent villages or settlements), language (brief outlines of grammar, etc., pp. 137-141, with native texts and interlinear translations of 3 legends), early home (migration has been from southeast), contact with whites (effect on lives and conditions; decrease in numbers), religious and mythological ideas (first-fruits cere- monies; prominent r6le of Coyote; "the snow-dance of Coyote," a legend bringing out the Indian ideas of the relation between a man and his per- sonal totem or snam, pp. 135-137). Pages 144-161 are occupied with English texts only of Io myths: myth of Coyote; the making of the sun; stealing fire from the upper world; how Coyote brought the sal- mon up the Columbia; skunk and fisher; Coyote, his four sons and the grizzly bear; Coyote and fox; the lazy boy; the grandchildren of the mountain-sheep; fisher and martin. Hrdli'ka (A.) Contribution to the an- thropology of Central and Smith Sound Eskimo. (Anthrop. Pap. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., N. Y., I9Io, v, 177-180, 20 pls.) Treats, with de- tails of measurements, etc., of seven- teen skulls (9 male, 6 female, 2 chil- dren) from Southampton Island and adjacent regions, and of four skulls of Smith Sound Eskimo (who died in New York), with observations of other skeletal parts, measurements, etc. On pages 223-230 are given the details of anthropometric measure- ments of 6 living Eskimo from Smith Sound (3 men, I woman, I boy, I girl), brought to N. Y. by the Peary Expedition in I896. Dr H. concludes that " the rarity of pronounced doli- chocephaly precludes any considerable recent blood relation with the Eski- mo from Labrador or lower Green- land," and also "the Southampton Island and all other Eskimo crania present absolutely no racial affinity with either the diluvial or posterior European crania, and their compari- son, except for contrasts, should once for all be abandoned; the kinship of the Eskimo is with Asia and Amer- ica" (p. 214). Between the South- ampton Island and Smith Sound crania was found "an unexpectedly close affinity in all the principal fea- tures." This indicates that the Hayes collection of Eskimo skulls needs re- investigation. The measurements of several Eskimo when living and of their skeletons, when dead, enable Dr H. to state that caution is necessary in using, e. g., Manouvrier's tables (based on whites) for calculating the stature from the long bones,-some marked differences are noted. The Southampton Id. Eskimo are now believed to be practically extinct. They were known as Sagdlirmiut, first reported by Capt. Lyon in 1825. Ingegnieros (J.) Sarmiento y Ame- ghino.

For comparison, words in other vocabularies of a number of these languages, from Wallace, Cou- dreau, Natterer, Schmidt, Tavera- Acosta, Montolieu, Crevaux, Spix, Chaffanjon, Melgarejo, are given. According to Dr K., the whole CaiarYr- Uaupes region, now largely peopled by tribes of the Betoyan stock, must, as the river-names suggest, have been once in the possession of Arawakan peoples. Acculturation of the Betoyan tribes from Arawakan sources has also occurred. This monograph adds much to the linguistic data of the region in question. - Die Mirinya, Rio Yapuri, Ama- zonas. (Z. f.

(Ibid., 19II, Ix, 273-435, map,) Treats of Miwok, Pomo, Yuki, Wiyot, Yurok, Karok,-phonetics, grammar, vocabulary, etc. Numerous examples illustrating morphological and gram- matical peculiarities, lists of roots and radicals, vocabularies and texts with interlinear translations are given for each stock. In California, "kindred languages are very similar in structure, however much they differ in a large proportion of their vocabulary." The Costanoan lan- guages are thought to be genetically related to Miwok, the dialects of which are discussed on pages 292- 319 (these tongues are without pre- fixes). Pomo is "completely non- pronominal, that is, non-incorpora- tive." The words of Yuki, with few exceptions "are either monosyllabic or resolvable into monosyllabic stems and suffixes." Yurok and Wiyot have certain close structural resem- blances, but few lexical identities are known so far. As Dr K. remarks: "That two languages belong to the same morphological type, or group, does not prove them genetically re- lated in America. A common origin can be asserted only on the basis of lexical correspondence." - Phonetic constituents of the native languages of California. (Ibid., 1911, x, 1-12.) Dr K. notes the pre- dominance of open vowels and "general reluctance toward lip move- ments "; rarity of nasal vowels (com- mon in Siouan); frequent associa- tion of glottal stops with vowels; stop consonants with moderate stress of articulation; lengthened or doubled stop consonants (in northern Paiute, Miwok, etc.); prevalence of the " in- termediateness" sound-type; surds and sonants; sparse representation of fricatives except of the s type; occur- rence of r in a number of languages. - The languages of the American Indians. (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXVIII, 500-513, 2 maps.) Treats of the character, distribution, etc., of Indian languages, the Uto- Aztecan and Algonkian stocks in par- ticular (with distribution maps of Uto-Aztecan, Eskimoan, Athapaskan, and Algonkian). The conservation of these languages is pointed out and some popular errors noted (e. g. the idea of the "scanty vocabulary" of Indian tongues. Methods of scientific study of phonetics and of grammat- ical structure are discussed, also the writing of Indian languages. - Shellmounds at San Francisco and San Mateo. (Rec. of Past, Wash., 1911, x, 227-228, I fg.) Resumes briefly results of Nelson investigations of I909-19II. Dr K. considers probable the estimate of Mr Nelson that the beginnings of at least some of these deposits are 3,000 years old or more. Kunike (H.) Beitrige zur Anthro- pologie der Calchaqui-Tiler. (Archiv f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1911, N. F. X, 203-225, 3 pls., 14 fgs., map.) Treats with descriptions (pp. 204-217) and details of measurements (pp. 220- 225) of 240 crania from various parts of the Calchaqui region of Argentina. The great majority of the skulls are deformed, but only 5 have patho- logical characters. The male skulls run from about 1,400 to 1,500 ccm. in cranial capacity, the female from 1,2oo to 1,3oo ccm., the total range being from ,o010o to 1,710 ccm. The index-types are 4,--normal brachyce- phalic, ca. go, deformed ca. Ioo; normal dolichocephalic ca. 8o, de- formed ca. 75. The preponderatingly brachycephalic element may have come from the north, while the less numerous dolichocephalic element may represent the indigenous popu- lation. Leden (C.) Musik und Tiinze der grnlaindischen Eskimos und die Ver- wandtschaft der Musik der Polar- eskimos mit der der Indianer.i (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1911, XLII, 261-270, 5 fgs.) Treats of Eskimo music and dances (the author was in Greenland, west and north in 19o9, east in 19IO).</page><page sequence="88">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 709 The old drum-dance and duel-song exist still on the east coast and among the Polar Eskimo,-relics also at Umanatsiak, on the west coast. The Polar Eskimo songs are of individual composition, and their melodies have often no texts, unlike those of the east and west coast in general (here occur comic and satirical songs, love- songs, animal-pantomimes). Speci- mens of songs (melody and text) are given from Eskimo of Umanatsiak (west), North Star Bay (Polar), Cape Dan (east), with American In- dian songs (Thompson R., Hopi) for comparison. According to L., the music of the Polar Eskimo is very closely related to that of the Indians; not so that of those of the east and west coasts. Lehmann (W.) Ergebnisse einer Forschungsreise in Mittelamerika und Mexiko 19o7-1909. (Ibid., 19I0, XLII, 687-749, 12 fgs., map.) This valuable monograph gives the results of Dr L.'s archeological and linguis- tic investigations in Central America and part of Mexico during the years 1907-1909. The farthest extension of prehistoric Mayan culture is on the islands of Fonseca Bay; the proto- Mexican culture extended beyond long. 850, lat. IoO; the northern in- trusion of South American stocks is traceable into Guatemala. According to Dr L., the Sumo languages are closely related to the Mosquito, and with them belong also the Matagalpa- Cacaopera (see pp. 714-723) and, remotely the Paya, Jicaque, Lenca and Xinca (a comparative vocabulary is given on pp. 724-727). The Pipil (pp. 728-734) is closely related to ancient Nahuatl. The archeological problems in Salvador are numerous,-- here we have to deal with tribes re- lated to the " Mayoide Zwischen- v6lker" of Mexico (Totonacs, Olmecs, Xicalanca), i. e., peoples, whose cul- ture suggests the Mayas, without their language belonging to that stock. The archeological types include simple stone-yokes (the eastern limit of these is in Salvador); certain flat conven- tionalized stone sculptures of human heads; three-cornered stone sculptures of the Palma-type; great stone sculp- tures of the Chac-Mol type; alabaster vessels; clay vessels with metallic AM. ANTH., N. S., I 3-46 luster; figure-vessels suggesting the Zapotec funeral urns of Oaxaca, etc. The Coribici, Caribici, or Curubici In- dians represent a stock, formerly more widely diffused, of which the Guatusos (or "wild Ramas ") and the Ramas are remnants. The ruins of Copan indicate the former high culture of the Mayan Chorti, whose influence in eastern Salvador and Honduras is pre-Pipil. The lan- guage-distribution map lists 15 stocks: Mixe-Z6que; Mixteco-Zapotec; Huave; Aztecan; Mayan; Subtiaba; Xinca-Lenca-Jicaque-Paya; Matagal- pa - Cacaopera - Sumo -Ulua-Mosquito; Rama-Guatuso; Voto-Guitare-Tala- manca-Terraba-Bonica (Chibchan) ; Guaymi-Dorasque; Cuna-Choco; Cu- eva (Coiba) ; Cariban (Karif, Island Carib). But some of these identifi- cations and applications are still doubtful. Lehmann-Nitsche (R.) Vocabulario Chorote 6 Solote, Chaco occidentale. (Rev. d. Museo de La Plata, I9Io- Ig911, xvil, 111-130.) Gives (pp. 115-128) classified vocabulary (fol- lowing model of the Tabelle zur Auf- nahme siidamerikanischer Sprachen issued by the Berlin Ethnological Museum), containing words obtained from Chorotes of S. Pedro de Jujuy by the author in 19o6 (besides others obtained in 19og at Ledesma, Jujuy, in 19og by S. Debenedetti; also Mataco words obtained by the author and Sr Debenedetti in 19o6 and I909), together with corresponding Mataco words from Pelleschi and Remedi, Nocten words from Massei, Vejoz words from d'Orbigny, etc. On pages 128-130 is a bit of Chorote phrases. The first scientific monograph on the Chorotes is that of von Rosen in 1904. The name is pronounced vari- ously as Chorote, Choroti, Soloti, Solote,--and in 1733 Father Lozano wrote it Xolota.

A study of Chiri- quian Antiquities. (Mem. Conn. Acad. Arts &amp; Sci., New Haven, 19II, III, xx + 249, 49 pls., 384 fgs.) Chiefly the result of "a careful study of the unparalleled collection of Chiriquian antiquities belonging to Yale Uni- versity." Stone (arrow- and spear- points, celts, polishing stones, metates, rubbing or hand stones, stools, images, ornaments, petroglyphs), pottery (unpainted, painted; stools, spindle- whorls and stamps, needle-cases, figurines, musical instruments, rattles, drums, wind instruments), metal (alloys of gold and copper, casting, articles of use, ornaments, figurines of animals, human figurines, figurines with mixed attributes, masks, plaques), etc. This monograph has a historical introduction, bibliography, and a good index. Dr McC. calls attention to " the general phylogenetic trend in the development of Chiriquian art as a whole." Except as regards archi- tecture, "the stone art of Chiriqui compares favorably with that of Mexico or Peru." The great bulk of Chiriquian antiquities consists of fictile products. Classification is ac- cording to animal motives. Notable is the armadillo (Holmes' terra cotta or biscuit); others are serpent, fish, etc. For a small group, with dis- tinctly Costa Rican affinities, the au- thor proposes the name chocolate in- cised. The plastic origin of the arma- dillo motives asserts itself even when transferred from unpainted to painted ware. Alligator motives are in color not relief. Three distinct systems of painting are noted. The great ma- jority of the metal pieces were cast, wholly or in part; the majority of the motives are composite in char- acter. Among deities recognized are the alligator-god, parrot-god, jaguar- god, crab-god, etc. The boundaries of Chiriquian culture exceeded those of the modern province of that name, particularly in the direction of Costa Rica. Evidences of contact with and influence by S. America are not want- ing. - An Aztec "calendar stone" in Yale University Museum. (Amer.

Gives results of Hernmarck expedition to Bolivia in 1908-1909 concerning the archeology of the eastern lowlands, where a " semi-culture " existed which appears to have been completely in- dependent of the culture of the moun- tain-region,-the Inca-culture never reached the plains and primeval forest here, while the rivers favored distri- bution from Brazil. In the M6xos country are mounds (partly dwelling- sites, partly graves,-also used for manioc-culture in swampy-lands). The burial-urns (on three supports) and certain other ceramic remains point not to Peru but to northern S. America,-indeed, the more recent pottery from the mounds belongs probably to the ancestors of the Arawakan peoples now inhabiting the M6xos region. N. is of opinion that by intermediary of the Arawaks culture-influences from northern S. America and Central America have been transmitted to eastern Bolivia and elsewhere in the heart of the con- tinent. The early Jesuit missionaries came across remains of this semi- culture. Oliver (M.

The divisions of the world are pri- mary, the attributes assigned to the gods secondary. The symbolism of the Cora and the old Mexican vessels are strikingly similar (the olin is considered at some length). This example shows, according to the de- tails given by Dr P., how the data obtainable from modern Indian tribes serves to explain and interpret the ideas and symbols of the ancient Mexicans, etc. Religionen der NaturvSlker Amerikas 19o6-1909.

In this brief, well-documented study Dr R. seeks to show that Peru (Piru, Biru, Pelu, Beru), is identical with the Barbacoan word pilu, "hole filled with water," from pi, "water, river." The "river" in question would be the Iscuando of the coastal region of southern Colombia. The name Peru was known in Panama (where the Spaniards picked it up) long before their arrival there. The language of the Caras of Ecuador, as such names as Tumbaviro, Pimampiro, etc., sug- gest, was closely related to the Bar- bacoan. - XVII0 Congres international des Americanistes. (J. Soc. d.

I relievi cerebrali delle fosse temporali nei crani deformati del Peri. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., Roma, 1910, xv, 271-284, 4 fgs.) Treats of the "cerebral reliefs of the temporal fossae in deformed Per- uvian skulls (4 types of deformation are distinguished). According to Dr S., " to determinate conditions of arti- ficial deformations of the skull always correspond determinate aspects of the cerebral reliefs of the temporal fossae. - Sul Diprothomo Platensis, Ame- ghino. (Ibid., 1911, xvI, 13-122, 4 fgs.) Gives results of investigation of the fragment of a skull, considered by Ameghino to belong to a precursor of man in America.

Describes " a ceremonial game of lacrosse [witnessed in the summer of 19Io], which is interwoven with the legend of the Thunderers and revolves about the idea of the birth and death of these spirits in man." The Thunderer-legend con- nected with lacrosse is given (p. 14o) as "gained through the interpreter from one of the oldest Indians of the tribe." Skye (M. L.) The Seneca legend of the seven stars.

The prehistoric ethnol- ogy of a Kentucky site. (Anthr. Pap. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., N. Y., I9Io, VI, 173-241, 48 pls., I fg.) Detailed investigation of village-site (no evi- dences of white contact) on the Fox farm, in Mason Co., Kentucky, about 14 miles south southwest from Mays- ville,-the site, while prehistoric, is of no great antiquity, judging by positive evidence. The topics treated are: Resources in animal and plant materials, securing and preparation of food, habitations, tools used by men and tools used by women, proc- 'esses of manufacture, games, religious objects, pipes, and amusements, war- fare, dress and ornament, art, injuries, and diseases, method of burial, etc. The inhabitants of the village-site built the mounds on the farm, as in- dicated by similarity in the artifacts found. Altogether, "the material culture of this site in Kentucky re- sembles that of the Adena Mound, Baum and Gartner sites, the main or early part of the Robert Harness Mound, and the Oregonia, Fort An- cient and Madisonville sites of Ohio," and "it belongs to what Mills has termed the 'Fort Ancient culture.'" The pottery is of the poor type (Holmes' "archaic northern"). - Primitive work in metal. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1911, XL, 209-218, 6 fgs.)

(Ibid., 472- 479, 4 fgs.) Besides notes on the Iroquoian Hiawatha (pp. 472-474), treats of the Ojibwa Indians of the Great Lakes (environment, language, clothing, ornament, houses, travel and transportation, canoes, food, maple- sugar, agriculture, fire-making, wild- rice, bow and arrow, etc.). It is hardly correct to state (p. 475) that Dakota " differs from the Ojibwa as Spanish does from Russian." - Canoes of the North Pacific Coast Indians. (Amer. Mus. J., N. Y., 1910, x, 243-245, 3 fgs.) Notes on Haida sea-going canoes, Chinook, Kwakiutl, Bella Coola and other types, decoration, use, etc. Canoes are val- uable property. It is very doubtful if sails were used before the advent of the whites, but strips of cedar- bark woven together preceded canvas. - Totem poles of the North Pacific coast. (Ibid., 1911, XI, 77-82, 10 fgs.) Figures totem-poles from Haida, Tlingit, Comox, Bella Coola, etc. The art of the average totem pole "is on the whole symbolic though rather realistic in appear- ance." Carved house and grave posts are akin to totem poles. A crude tamanawas board from Bay Center (Wash.) "shows totem-pole influence south of the North Pacific culture area." ---- (J. B.)

S. might learn from Canada something in the avoidance of fraud and chi- canery, and Canada learn something from the U. S., in the way of making Indians into citizens. Speck (F. G.) Missions in the Creek Nation. (Ibid., 20o6-20o8.) Brief ac- count of present condition of Indians and negroes in the northwestern part of the Creek Nation, Oklahoma, effects of white contact, etc. Although fifty years ago the Creeks were largely Christianized, the percentage of Christians among them seems now to be small. Many are Christian in their ethics, but pagan in all else. Many are neither pagan nor Chris- tian. A few of the old congregations, Baptist and Methodist chiefly, are still left. To-day there are " thou- sands of mixed-blood negroes and Creeks, who pass either as the one or the other." In one little church, the members include negroes, Yuchi In- dians, half blood Creeks, etc. - The Jackson-Whites. (Ibid., 104-107.) Notes on the community known as "Jackson-Whites," in the Ramapo valley from Suffern, N. Y., to Goshen,-character, house, manu- factures (basketry, eel-pots, wooden ware),-a collection is now in Ameri- can Museum of Natural History (N. Y.). They seem to be the result of triple race-mixture, Indian-white- negro. They number some 1,500. A visit to the Penobscot Indians. (U. of Penn. Mus. J., Phila., 1911, II, 21-26, 5 fgs.)

(Ibid., 26-27, I fg.) Treats briefly of a wampum belt obtained from the wife of a Wyandot chief in Oklahoma,,and another (obtained in 1903 from Atowa Tohonadiheta, a Canadian Iroquois), said to have been used at a treaty in 1612. - MacHenry, the Bad-Men; a Creek Indian's story.

At pp. 237-240 is given the Yuchi text, with English interlinear and free translations, of the legend of the origin of diseases and medicines; and at pp. 241-245 the music of two Shawnee love songs. The greater part of the material was obtained from the Creeks of Taskigi town,-the music was transcribed by Dr J. D. Sapir, who "feels that the Creek songs possess a strength and energy that is lacking in the Yuchi songs, while the latter are more har- monious to the European ear." The medicine songs and formulas "1are secret individual property." - Huron moose hair embroidery. (Amer. Anthrop., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, N. S., XIII, 1-14, 3 pls., 8 fgs.)

Brief account of pottery-making as now practiced at the Pueblo of San Ilde- fonso oni the Rio Grande about 20o miles N. W. of Santa Fe. The finest pottery has black designs on a whit- ish ground. The decorative art shows a keen appreciation of nature. Starr (F.), Kinnaman (J. 0.) and Talmage (J. E.) The Michigan archeological question settled. (Amer. Antiq., Benton Harbor, Mich., 1911, xxxII, 16o-164.) Reports on "the famous Michigan 'relics' of a pre- historic Caucasian race." The tablets and other objects of clay, slate, and copper "are plainly recent objects, manufactured to deceive." Father Savage, Mr Soper, and Mr Russell hav been deceived but were not par- ties to any deception. See Kelsey (F. W.). Tahamont (R.) The story of the magic arrow.

Notes on the old drugs used in Chilean folk-medicine -mercurial compounds much used, remedies for indigestion, the "evil eye" and eye-troubles, powders, tinc- tures, etc., balsams, fumigation for rheumatism, etc., love-powders. Pages 277-298 are a reprint of a drug-list published at Santiago in 1813. To this Tarifa Dr R. Lenz furnishes an introduction (pages 273-275). Tozzer (A. M.) The value of ancient Mexican manuscripts in the study of the general development of writing. (Proc. Amer. Antiq. Soc., Worcester, 1911, N. s., xxI, 8o-ioi, 7 pls., 16 fgs.) Discusses stages of "reminders," *pure picture-writing (symbolism, con- ventionalizing, etc.), "ideographs" (suggestions take the place of rep- resentations), ikonomatic writing or phonetic-picture-writing (numerous illustrations), true phonetic writing, -the Nahuas just stopped short of this last stage; the development fur- ther was the work of the Spaniards in their endeavor to teach the natives the creed of the church. According to Dr T. " there is found in Mexico, perhaps to a greater degree than in any other one place in the world, ex- amples of all the different kinds of writing,"-i. e. up to the beginnings of a syllabary. Concerning the Maya writing the author thinks that the true line of research will lie in the direction of" rebus-forms "; also that, as Bowditch holds, "the consonantal sound of a syllable was of far greater importance than the vowel sound." Uhlenbeck (C. C.) Original Blackfoot Texts from the Southern Piegans Blackfoot Reservation, Teton County, Montana. With the help of Joseph Tatsey. (Verh. d. k. Ak. van Wetensch. te Amsterdam, Afd.

Amer. de Paris, 191o [I911], N. S., viI, 85-116.) Critical discussion of the real and alleged Scandinavian expeditions to America. Treats of the original sources of in- formation, the voyages to Vineland, the historical value of the Sagas, the location of Vineland (not placed in America before the I8th century), the inventors of the idea that Vineland was in America (the originator was Jonsson Arngrim, an Icelander, in 1609-161o), the arguments for and against the Scandinavian discoveries of America (distances, astronomic position, vine and wild wheat, natives of Vineland, archeological proofs,- Dighton Rock, Fall River skeleton, stone mill at Newport, Monhegan Id. inscription, inscriptions of Yarmouth, Grave Creek tablet, " Syasi-the- blond," the Minnesota "runic stone," etc.). V. rejects the Kensington stone along with other alleged documents of a somewhat similar nature. There is thus no other evidence whatever as to the location of Vineland and its dis- covery except the mention in the Sagas. V. concludes that the Scan- dinavians never got as far south as New England,-Vineland was pos- sibly some part of Labrador, if in America at all. No real " discovery" of America valid for the world was ever made by the Scandinavians. Wagner (R. R.) La 1lgende du " Cit- priu." (J. Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, I9Io [I911], N. S., VII, 145-147.)

Treats, with trac- ings, indications of lip positions, etc., the phonetic system of the northern Paiute language, the data having been obtained with the help of a full- blood, middle-aged Paiute named Dick Mahwee. Several types of con- sonants are absent from Paiute. Other features are a general lack of incisiveness in articulation, a very much later vocalization of sonants and very much less aspiration of surds than in English. Consonantal clus- ters do not occur, either initially or medially. Webster (H.) The Nebraska Society of Ethnology and Folklore. (Amer. Anthrop., Lancaster, Pa., 1910, N. s., xII, 730.) Wilder (H. H.)

The crossing of the races. (Pop. Sci. Mo., Lancaster, Pa., 1911, LXXIX, 486-495.) In this "study of the general principles gov- erning the successful intermixture of different peoples, with special ref- erence to the question of immigration into the United States," Dr W. con- cludes that of the European immi- grants, in so far as physical type is concerned, " that type of man best adapted physically to the climate and soil will, in the point of numbers, eventually predominate in spite of all restrictive legislation or man-made laws of any kind," and thus " the in- fluence of immigration upon our physical type will, in the long run, be nil." The problem as to the in- fluence of racial amalgamation upon habits of thought, morals, institu- tions, etc., is a much graver one, and here the Jew is the most serious ob- stacle, and he "will continue to be an unsolved and vexatious problem long after the Pole and the Hun and Italian are forgotten." Wissler (C.) Anthropological field- work for the year. (Amer. Museum J., N. Y., 1911, XI, 299-300, 2 fgs.)

Gives results of expedition of 1906,--most of the data is from the Montana Piegans. Tribal divisions (northern Blackfoot differ more from Piegan than latter from Blood), courtship (male usually aggressor; virginity highly esteemed; boys en- couraged to take liberties) marriage and its obligations, plurality of wives (limited only by economic consid- erations), potential wives (" distant wives,"--sisters of wife), mother-in- law taboo, divorce, relationship (list of terms relating to males and fe- males, p. I6), names, bands (imply not only bonds of friendship but bonds of blood; list of bands, p. 21 I), the camp-circle, tribal organization and control (head men of uncertain tenure, head-chief for each tribe,</page><page sequence="100">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 721 everything of importance settled in council, organized men's societies, etc.) property rights (theoretically at least, women owned tipis, travois, horses ridden by them, domestic im- plements and clothing), division of labor, birth-customs (birth-marks evidence of re-birth), menstruation (no special taboo, except woman is not supposed to come near sick), care and training of children (" no definite evidences of puberty ceremonies aside from the boy's change of name"), death and mourning; tales of adven- ture (pp. 32-36), heraldry and pic- ture-writing (decorations of tipi, records of war, capturing of horses, highly conventionalized symbols, sand-map, etc.), reckoning time (month-names, winter-count calen- dars, pp. 45-50), oaths (sun taken to witness), etiquette (visiting, hospi- tality, etc.), amusements and games (jokes common, pranks, etc.; game of tops, arrow-games, bows-and-arrows, wheel-game, ball, wrestling, "kick- ing," etc.), gambling (the hand- game and songs, wheel-gambling, four-stick game, etc.). As to gam- bling, etc., the Blackfoot "on the whole, seem to incline more toward the Plateau and Shoshone area than to the Siouan or Algonkin" (p. 62). - Measurements of Dakota Indian children. (Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci., 1911, XX, 355-364.) Discusses meas- urements (height, weight, chest) of 1,77o and 1,193 individuals out of totals of 5,242 full bloods and 1,877 mixed bloods at the Pine Ridge agency (chiefly Ogallala Teton), made by Dr J. R. Walker, for 13 years phy- sician there. The statistics were com- piled and studied by Dr Wissler in comparison with those of white chil- dren secured under similar condi- tions. In general the Dakota chil- dren are taller and heavier than white children, the mixed bloods standing between the two races; there is prob- ably no difference in the time periods of growth for Indians and whites although there is a suggestion of a later maximum growth period for the Indian; a slightly more rapid mas turity for Indian children during the i5th and i6th years is suggested; variability for Indian children is less than for white; Dakota results con- tradict the idea that children of mixed parents are taller than either parent; the correlation values of the mixed blood do not tend toward an intermediate position between Indian and white; in both mixed bloods and Indians, the pre-adolescent accelera- tion is more in evidence than among white children. Zeh (L. E.) Indian shorthand writers. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1911, xI, 480-485, I fg.) Treats of Father Le Jeune and his labors among the In- dians, near Kamloops, B. C., to whom he taught a shorthand system of writ- ing in which is published in the Chinook Jargon (pp. 482-483 are occupied with extracts), a paper of 16 pp., containing church and local information, etc., called the Kamloops Wawa; it is now printed from type specially made for the purpose. Some 2,000 Indians of this region read and write this shorthand. - Reindeer progress in Alaska. (Ibid., 610-615, 3 fgs.) Notes bene- ficial results. Last census showed 23,000 reindeer, of which 11,ooo were owned by the natives. Of the 28 dis- tributing stations i8 are owned by the Government and 1o by church mis- sions. The Lapp herders often be- come owners. With careful training, the Eskimo boys make excellent herders, and can lasso better than the Laps. The use of reindeer-skin for clothing, etc., is important. Zimmerman (J.) Hewers of stone. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 9igio, xxI, 1002-0II19, 9 fgs.) Treats of the ruins of Mitla, in Oaxaca, from per- sonal observation and information from Prof. W. H. Holmes. The quarries, the temples, the mosaic fret- work, the cruciform cellars (or graves, perhaps), the palace, the hall of the 6 columns, etc., are described and figured.</page></plain_text>
