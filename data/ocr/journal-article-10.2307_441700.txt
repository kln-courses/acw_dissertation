<plain_text><page sequence="1">City Jungles and Expressionist Reifications from Brecht to Hammett JOHN WALKER The subject of expressionism, that tortured mutilation of congealed panic and anxiety, emanates its strongest contours when cast against the back- ground of the modern urban landscape. The noisy and unpredictable ma- chinery of the metropolis confronts the subject as an alien force that con- tinuously threatens any vestige of individual autonomy. The harsh juxtapo- sition of wounded subjectivity with the chaos of commerce, the cacophony of technologies, and the utterly inhuman industrial backgrounds exhibits the dissolution of social community into scattered and disconnected frag- ments. In the midst of the most developed concentration of the forces of technological achievement and civilized social organization, the isolated and alienated character of the modern subject comes most prominently to the surface. The urban zone of expressionism is a monolithic entity that antago- nizes and annihilates the isolated energies of the subject. Walter Benjamin refers to "the impenetrable obscurity of mass existence" (Baudelaire 64) in which the individual is dissolved into the mob. The city itself figures as the anthropomorphic subject of many modernist endeavors, from Fritz Lang's Metropolis to Alexander Doblin's quasi-expressionist Berlin Alexanderplatz, which depicts a protagonist entirely constructed from the assembled rhythms, ideologies, and fragments of information imposed on subjectivity by the monolith metropolis. In the cityscapes of George Grosz and Otto Dix, the geography of the city resembles the infernal regions of Hierony- mous Bosch, where each individual is consigned to a particular torment and compelled to replicate mechanically a specific and pointless task in ut- ter isolation from the swarming multitudes on all sides. Modern literatures unite the paradoxical vision of the urban landscape 119</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE as technological anti-utopia with the metaphor of the primeval jungle. Met- ropolitan technologies contribute to an atmosphere of noise, light, and sud- den violence whose obscure origins and unpredictable concatenations con- jure visions of jungle environments. The arbitrary violence and apparent lawlessness of city life create an atmosphere of anarchy that recalls social configurations of tribal warfare. Economic imperatives that set individuals in hostile competition replicate primeval conditions where survival is based on a struggle against all others. The conflation of city and jungle corresponds to a similar conflation of machine and animal. The total mechanization of activity and the subsequent death of inner life experienced by the subject of modern labor is repre- sented by analogies to inanimate mechanical processes or to the unreflec- tive instinctual violence of the savage beast. The absence of civilized re- sponses of sympathy and social conscience, made obsolete by market im- peratives of total competition, engender a sense of identity with the amoral extravagances of the animal kingdom. American gangster and detective literatures fully incorporate the ur- ban mythos of expressionism; the noir genre is based on the exploration of the underside and the unconscious of the city and its geography. Noir film and the detective story of the 1920s and 30s do not merely adopt the land- scape of the expressionist scene, but further assimilate and develop expres- sionist atmospheres, techniques, and theoretical orientations. These genres intersect most prominently in films like Fritz Lang's M and the works of German emigrant Otto Preminger. The expressionist resonances in Dashiell Hammett's work are so pronounced that direct citations from the move- ment can be clearly identified. The urbanjungle mythos that serves as the background for expression- ism and noir is elaborated in Bertolt Brecht's Jungle of Cities, composed in 1924. Brecht constructs a gigantic Chicago of mythic proportions, a meta- physical projection of Chicago in its distorted and transfigured essence in which the audience is instructed to concentrate on the expressionist agon: "concern yourself with the human element, evaluate the antagonists' fight- ing spirit impartially and concentrate your interest on the showdown" (12). While Brecht was careful to distance himself theoretically from expres- sionism, the aesthetic resonances of the movement abound in his work. Jungle of Cities dramatizes a vast retinue of expressionist styles and tech- niques: Hyperbole, distortion, caricature, and mechanization all modulate characteristic expressionist themes of domestic conflict and a revolt against reification and economic determination. Brecht utilizes the telegraphic fragments of speech and compacted phrases of expressionist dialogue. His protagonist, in the midst of conflict 120</page><page sequence="3">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS and apropos of nothing, suddenly gazes idly out the window and intones, "Ninety-four degrees in the shade. Traffic, noise from the Milwaukee bridge. A morning, like any other" (16). The Salvation Army Officer recites an in- ventory of commodities as if a section from a menu had been cut out and pasted into the dialogue: "Cherry Flip, Cherry Brandy, Gin Fizz, Whiskey Sour, Golden Slipper, Manhattan Cocktail... and, the specialty of this bar: Eggnog. This alone consists of the following .. ." (76). These montaged fragments of discourse are mixed with blunt colloquialisms punctuated by extended lyrical monologues. Brecht's arrangements of scenes recall the stationendrama model of ex- pressionist theater. Certain scenes are arranged as a series of vignettes from isolated stage areas where self-sufficient minidramas or parables are enacted. Scene 5 alternates between the separate dramas going on in a bedroom, a hallway, and a saloon. These seemingly arbitrary arrangements undermine conventional aesthetic models of harmonious transition and organic total- ity, and instead exhibit an organizational principle based on mechaniza- tion and dissonance. The pronounced mechanization of character and discourse is exempli- fied by the sudden appearance and staccato monologue of The Man in scene 8: I've got three minutes to give you some information, and you've got two minutes to act on it. This is it: half an hour ago, Police Head- quarters received a letter from one of the state prisons. It is signed by a certain George Garga, and he incriminates you on several counts. The patrol wagon will be here in five minutes. You owe me a thousand bucks. (Brecht 70) He is paid and immediately disappears in the manner of an automaton. He comes from nowhere and vanishes into nowhere. His totally disinterested attitude, his prefabricated speech and its precise price tag testify to the ad- ministrative zeal and bureaucratic efficiency that not only dictate business affairs and legal relations but thoroughly permeate the consciousness and experience of the economic subject in the modern urban environment. This expressionist trademark of objectification of character by function can be seen in the list of cast members, which includes The Worm, The Baboon, and The Snubnose. These characters are the magnified perver- sion of their economic functions; the mutilations imposed on the personal- ity are externalized and projected in the form of caricature. Expressionist distortions of nature or the urban landscape are precipi- tated by the projection of wounded subjectivity onto the external world. The assault of urban conditions on the senses of the individual is often char- 121</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE acterized by the experience of claustrophobia. Hence Marie complains of the intrusive pressure of the sky against her body. On the shores of Lake Michigan, the only scene outside of the city in the drama, she fails to expe- rience a sense of comfort from the pastoral scene, and instead observes, "Those trees-they look as if they were covered with human shit .... And the sky's so close you could touch it, and what do I care for it" (Brecht 57). Her projected anxiety transforms her environment into a sinister and op- pressive monstrosity. The antagonist Shlink embodies the fully dehumanized being. From poor migrant beginnings, he rose to the position of owner of a timber in- dustry, and the economic exploitations entailed in that rise have reduced him to an empty and dehumanized replicant. He explains, "don't expect any words out of my mouth. All I have in my mouth is teeth" (Brecht 41). His lack of words testifies to the absence of any modicum of humanity ca- pable of expression; there is nothing left of him but material. Shlink's un- derstanding of his condition is based on a corporealization of interiority: He projects his inner state onto his skin and thereby recognizes it as part of his own displaced body. He explains to Marie: my body's gone numb, it affects even my skin. You know, in its natu- ral state human skin is too thin for this world. So men take care to see it grows thicker. There would be nothing wrong with the method, if only you could stop it from growing. (43) The dehumanization necessitated by economic objectification colonizes all other spheres of personal life as well, and the doomed attempt to mediate between objectifying economic activity and human emotional relations reconfigures subjectivity as a form of schizophrenia. Shlink tells Marie about his skin to explain why he is incapable of love. He has no emotional surplus to give her, and the only value she can have for him is market value. Her exclamation "They're selling me!" (53) dem- onstrates the painful awareness of her own objectification in a capitalist economy where prostitution is universalized and desire is bought and sold on the market. Her only consolation for this awareness is in a masochistic identification with her commodity function as prostitute, and she thereby demands to be paid for love from Shlink. The stake wagered on the metaphysical battle of Shlink and Garga is whether or not there is any way out of reification. When Garga refuses to sell his opinion in the opening scene, he affirms that there is some sphere of his existence that remains self-determined and is therefore not for sale. Shlink's response that "Your opinion is immaterial too-except that I want 122</page><page sequence="5">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS to buy it" (14) refutes the prospect of a sphere of existence that is not re- ducible to quantifiable exchange value. As Shlink demonstrates the power of his position by buying off Garga's family, mistress, and job, Garga revolts by stripping off his clothes and run- ning amok. This archetypically expressionistic response to moral conflict is reminiscent of the Cashier in From Morning to Midnight, who performs a simi- lar flight from signifying systems. Intoxicated by the heat of conflict and the suspense of his sudden catastrophic awakening, Garga quotes Rimbaud and raves expressionistically: "And that-is freedom.... I have no knowledge of metaphysics, I do not understand the laws, I have no moral sense, I am an animal" (21). He equates his freedom with the abolition of his inherited civilization and a renewed identification with the primeval beast. He re- sponds to the challenge of urban economic demands by abandoning mo- rality and culture, and reverting to animal instincts. Karl Marx refers to the alienation of labor as a process whereby "What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal" (137). Garga embodies this transposi- tion through a reversion to the uninhibited instinctual activity of the wild beast. Shlink circumvents this strategy by converting Garga into an exploiter and thus reintegrating him into economic determinations. In order to wage conflict, Garga must objectify himself; as an object he in turn objectifies others and thereby enters into complicity with cycles of reification. Con- fronted with the apparent ubiquity of these cycles, he expresses his aware- ness to his mother in terms that do not permit a satisfactory resolution: We aren't free. It starts with coffee in the morning, and blows for being such a bad monkey, and mother's tears are salt to season the children's meal: and she washes their little shirts in her sweat, and you are all taken care of and safe, safe, until the Ice Age comes, while the root grows right through your heart. And when he's grown up, and wants to do something, wants to go the whole hog, what does he find out? He'll find he's already been consecrated, paid for, stamped and sold at a good price, so he isn't even free to go and drown himself! (35) Family life and the maternal relation, ideologically conceived as zones of refuge from economic determinations, are here represented as thoroughly permeated by the paralyzing processes of reification. Even suicide is figured as a prefabricated gesture already inscribed within these ubiquitous cycles. Yet human beings cannot be entirely obliterated: The individual retains a ghost of vanquished humanity even in urban environments of totalizing objectification. The Salvation Army Officer's lament-"People are too du- 123</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE rable, that's their main trouble.... they last too long" (77)-is confirmed by his failure to die even after shooting himself in the head. These rem- nants of humanity, distorted beyond recognition by economic dehuman- ization, come to the surface and reemerge in immeasurably disfigured forms: Love and affection are thereby transformed into sadism and mas- ochism. This is the psychological mechanism implied by the frontier code that motivates the love/hate ambivalence in Shlink and Garga's relations. The objective impossibility of benevolent human contact in an atmosphere of total alienation compels them to seek contact through hatred, conflict, and antagonism. The tableau for the staging of their final showdown is in the gravel pits on the edge of town. The industrial wasteland thus replaces the prairie as the site for the isolated male confrontation in the new world. Shlink con- cedes the inevitable stalemate of their attempt at engagement by emphasiz- ing the impossibility of transversing the utter isolation that separates hu- man beings: I've been watching animals: and love, or the warmth given off by bodies moving in close to each other, that is the only mercy shown to us in the darkness. But the coupling of organs is all, it doesn't make up for the divisions caused by speech.... And the genera- tions stare coldly into each other's eyes. If you cram a ship's hold full of human bodies, so it almost bursts-there will be such loneli- ness in that ship that they'll all freeze to death. (83) Spatial proximity is described as a condition that paradoxically increases spiritual separation, and the metaphor of the ship's hold suggests an anal- ogy to the claustrophobic conditions of modern urban arrangements. Shlink proceeds to invoke the vision of the primeval jungle as a utopian counter- part to the emotional death of the subject of civilization: "The forest! That's where mankind comes from, from right here. Hairy, with ape's mouths, good animals who knew how to live. It was all so easy. They just tore each other to pieces" (83). Far from the cheerful pastoral utopias of harmony with nature envisioned by the Enlightenment, Shlink projects a utopia of anarchic and bestial violence. Characteristic of expressionist reverie, the deepest desire of wounded subjectivity is found in atavistic frenzies of de- struction; existence is validated exclusively by moments of highest passion and fiercest energy. The detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett reproduces the model of human relations exhibited in expressionist drama and developed in Brecht's Jungle. The antagonists are stripped of individual characteristics and reduced to a deformed though imperishable human essence. Against the backdrop 124</page><page sequence="7">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS of a bleak and brutal chaos ruled by utterly immoral forces, they face each other in their respective moral isolation, locked in deadly opposition. The urban zone of the crime novel appropriates the jungle metaphor of the expressionist metropolis by representing the modern city as an arena of anarchic violence where individuals are set against each other in hostile conflict. George Grella observes that "the gangster novel (like many Ameri- can detective stories) seems a kind of urban pastoral" (187). The gangster novel functions as a meditation on the landscape of the modern city. The mythic vision of the American landscape, both urban and rural, has always held a great fascination for European projections of absolute alienation and moral solitude. Brecht and Kafka, among many others, uti- lized this mythic territory as the background for their modernist fictions. Andre Gide remarks that "the American cities and countryside must offer a foretaste of hell" (qtd. in Madden xxvi). In the proportions of mythic America, one confronts the realities of Europe by gazing on them in mag- nified form. Hammett's work performs this same optical demonstration for the natives: By defamiliarizing conditions that have become ideologically obscured by processes of habituation, the horror of those conditions is made manifest. Hammett's Red Harvest presents the modern city as a zone of tribal war- fare where legally justified structures of authority cannot be distinguished from illegal hierarchies of gang rule. These anarchic conditions are indi- cated as the direct result of the antagonistic competition imposed on social relations by capitalist economies. The protagonist's client, Elihu Willsson, has exercised the iron rule of capital over the town for 40 years as baron of the banks and newspapers. This perfect collusion of the interests of capital and the production of ideology does not prevent a mass uprising of the mine workers, and Willsson hires armed mobs to bust the labor unions. By the beginning of the novel, the mobs have shattered the unions and are fighting among themselves to divide up the town, compelling Willsson to call on the Continental Detective Agency to secure his interests. In Carl Freedman and Christopher Kendrick's article, "Forms of Labor in Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest," the resulting social conditions in the town are described as an analogy to fascist Italy in terms of a "feudalization of illicit power" (213). With reference to Benjamin, they observe that "The individualism of the gangster power structure makes for a permanent state of anarchic emergency" (210). The ceaseless cycles of violent retribution among conflicting gangs are assimilated by the populace as the normalized environment of urban life, and economic survival is predicated on a strate- gic alliance with superior firepower. Hammett's town, with characteristic lack of subtlety, is appropriately 125</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE named "Personville" (pronounced by the locals as "Poisonville"), an almost direct citation of expressionist abstraction of place into general category. Hammett's description of the town could serve as stage directions for the backdrop of the expressionist metropolis: the smelters whose brick stacks stuck up tall against a gloomy mountain to the south had yellow-smoked everything into uniform dinginess. The result was an ugly city of forty thousand people, set in an ugly notch between two ugly mountains that had been all dirt- ied up by mining. Spread over this was a grimy sky that looked as if it had come out of the smelter's stacks. (Red Harvest 4) Nature is hereby reified as a waste product of labor, and the claustrophobia imposed by this industrial sky contrasts to the metaphorical transposition of the jungle onto the activity within the city. With characteristic expressionist condensation, Hammett's protagonist is named "the Op": a two-letter abbreviation of his economic function as Continental Operative. After noting the infernal character of Personville, the Op spots three caricatures of policemen, unshaved, unbuttoned, and smoking cigars while directing traffic, and he immediately deciphers the absence of legitimized authority in the town. "Don't kid yourselves that there's any law in Poisonville" (Red Harvest 111), he explains later to his recently arrived assistants. The Op internalizes and absorbs the anarchy of the urban environment and embarks on a strategy based on the provocation of violence and an- tagonisms among rival gangs in the effort to have them destroy each other in the process. He explains to his ally, the junky-prostitute Dinah Brand, that he could have accomplished his ends through legal means, "But it's easier to have them killed off, easier and surer, and, now that I'm feeling this way, more satisfying" (Red Harvest 145). He derives sadistic pleasure from the replication of the cycles of violence, and he describes his desensitized condition with the same corporealization of interiority as Brecht's Shlink: "I've got hard skin all over what's left of my soul" (145). He identifies the encroaching metropolis as the source of the violent fever that penetrates his subjectivity like a disease: "It's this damned town. Poisonville is right. It's poisoned me" (145). The smothered condition of his soul seeks cathartic release in violent agitation, and he refers to the pleasure experienced from this release as an intoxication. The Op internalizes and replicates the violence of his environment in the manner of a machine, yet his delirium precipitates a regression to ani- mal instincts. This paradoxical conflation of machine and animal serves as the principle of characterization that motivates the inhabitants of the ur- 126</page><page sequence="9">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS ban pastoral. In "The Poetics of the Private-Eye," Robert Edenbaum observes that in Hammett's novels, "Action is determined mechanistically-or animalistically" (100). The apparent ease with which Edenbaum equates mechanical and animal determinations reflects the instability of these cat- egories in Hammett's narration. In The Rebel Albert Camus reads the American crime narrative as an aesthetic that operates "as if men were entirely defined by their daily automatisms. On this mechanical level men, in fact, seem exactly alike, which explains this peculiar universe in which all the characters appear in- terchangeable, even down to their physical peculiarities" (265). Camus re- fers to these characters as "the symbol of the despairing world in which wretched automatons live in a machine-ridden universe" (266). The totaliz- ing mechanization of behavior in the crime narrative testifies to the vio- lence done to subjectivity by the encroaching technologies of modern ur- ban conditions. Despite Camus's disparaging view of the crime novel, he perceives what most commentators on the genre have missed: "This technique is called realistic only owing to a misapprehension.... It is born of a mutilation, and of a voluntary mutilation, performed on reality" (265). The conventional circumscription of Hammett's fiction within a tradition of American real- ism totally disregards all characteristic components of his style and theo- retical orientation. Hammett's use of abstraction, mechanization, and cari- cature dismantle realist conventions by mutilating the subject of represen- tation into defamiliarized form. The perfectly prefabricated automatisms of Hammett's subjects con- trasts to a reified animation of the technological object. Automobiles dart about and weapons discharge as if operating according to their own inde- pendent volition. The cigarette ashes on Sam Spade's desk come to life and twitch and crawl about in the breeze. These anthropomorphisms testify to the fetishized character of objects in an urban environment of totalizing reification. Hammett's generally sparse descriptions are based on a rigorous con- densation of the subject, which is reconfigured as congealed abstraction. In "The Farewell Murder," the Op describes a house in terms of a mutilated conglomeration of geometric figures; the intensely asymmetrical arrange- ment of converging diagonal lines reads like a stage setting for Caligari: Take a flock of squat cones of various sizes, round off the points bluntly, mash them together with the largest one somewhere near the center, the others grouped around it in not too strict accor- dance with their sizes, adjust the whole collection to agree with the 127</page><page sequence="10">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE slopes of a hilltop, and you would have a model of the Kavalov house. (278) The Op's observations disdain attention to referential detail. Instead they enact a narrative compression of the scene that approximates an expres- sionist model of prose: His subject is transformed into a generic abstraction that is consequently mutilated into idiosyncratic form. Hammett's prose here undermines realist conventions by emphasizing the discursive construc- tion of the image and directing attention towards the artificiality of the de- scriptive act. Hammett's narration reduces the subject to economic function or idio- syncratic trait, and then distorts and magnifies this feature to subsume the entire individual. Physical characteristics are contorted into cartoon pro- portions and arranged surrealist configurations. In "The Golden Horse- shoe" the Op spots a stranger in the bar and describes him as "A tall, raw- boned man with wide shoulders, out of which a long, skinny, yellow neck rose to support a little round head. His eyes were black shoe-buttons stuck close together at the top of a little mashed nose" (72). This absurd collage of distorted features and incongruous objects has more in common with dada caricature than realism. The description of Willsson in Red Harvest could refer to one of Grosz's sinister portraits: "The short-clipped hair on his round pink skull was like silver in the light .... His mouth and chin were horizontal lines" (135). Hammett's characters are drawn with a mark and a dash: reduced to com- pact visual signifiers and geometries of abstracted essence. The description of Sam Spade that opens The Maltese Falcon evokes a similar geometry of personal characteristics: Samuel Spade's jaw was long and bony, his chin a jutting v under the more flexible v of his mouth. His nostrils curved back to make another, smaller, v. His yellow-grey eyes were horizontal. The v motif was picked up again by thickish brows rising outward from twin creases above a hooked nose, and his pale brown hair grew down- from high flat temples-in a point on his forehead. He looked rather pleasantly like a blond Satan. (3) The alphabetical figure is stamped on Spade's face like a typographical col- lage; individuality is dissolved into typology. Hammett's relentless abstrac- tion of character responds to the increasingly abstract conditions imposed by pervasive modern bureaucracies, which are inscribed as a visual signifier on the subject's body. The nickname, partially necessitated to maintain anonymity in the city crowd, reconfigures subjectivity as caricature. Hammett's novels are popu- 128</page><page sequence="11">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS lated by characters identified according to the conspicuously deformed physical characteristic: the Thin Man, the Fat Man, Big Chin, or Chinless Jerry. In Red Harvest, the villains Whisper and the Voice are named accord- ing to their discursive capacities. The Dis an' Dat Kid and the Whosis Kid are reduced to cartoon parodies of their namelessness. The Op's boss is simply the Old Man, an abstract typology that suggests the presence of au- thority in the colloquial reference to the father. The notoriously compact prose for which the crime novel is famous necessitates a narrative contraction of action into brief staccato segments. These segments tend to focus on the sharply delineated visual image, and the action unfolds like a montage of snapshots. A curtain whipped loose in the rain. Out of the opening came pale fire-streaks. The bitter voice of a small-caliber pistol. Seven times. The Whosis Kid's wet hat floated off his head-a slow balloon- like rising. ("Whosis Kid" 189) Hammett substitutes the empty hat in the place of the Kid, which defies gravity and floats off as if under its own power. The intense objectification of images recalls expressionist contractions of the subject, and the frag- mented pace of the unfolding scene imitates expressionist rhythms of sud- den shocks and abrupt pauses. Human beings are carefully subtracted from the scene, whereas the pistol is invested with the power of speech, and in- animate objects like the curtain and the hat seem to be animated with inde- pendent volition. As the Op walks into a boxing arena in Red Harvest, he gives an atomic inventory of the scene in four sentences, one word each: "Smoke. Stink. Heat. Noise" (69). This intensified brevity recalls the telegraphic conven- tions of expressionism. One of the Op's colleagues speaks exclusively in miniaturized fragments of information. He reports his activities in the man- ner of a speaking machine: "Spot two. Out three-thirty, office to Willsson's. Mickey. Five. Home. Busy. Kept plant. Off three, seven. Nothing yet" (132). The Op then flaunts his semiotic prowess by translating the meaning of these prefabricated signifiers for the benefit of the reader. Hammett paro- dies this convention in a section from The Dain Curse, where the Op objects to the verbosity of a friend who responds, "Tell me what's up while I try to find one-syllable words for you" (20). The brevity of dialogue and description in Hammett makes his novels almost appropriate to stage production. Sometimes he dispenses with de- scription entirely, and large sections of his books (particularly The Thin Man) are composed exclusively of character dialogue and monologue. The ex- 129</page><page sequence="12">TW T ENTIETH CENTURY LITERATU tended monologues, often confessions or case histories, can be highly idio- syncratic in their use of colloquialisms and regional slang. At other times they are simply journalese, speech stripped down to the delivery of commodified fragments of information. In Red Harvest, some nameless de- tective informs the Op, "'Donald Willsson, Esquire, publisher of the Morn- ing and Evening Heralds, was found in Hurricane Street a little while ago, shot very dead by parties unknown,' he recited in a rapid singsong" (7). The detective's mechanical voice confirms what his speech has already made clear: He is an automaton capable of replicating prefabricated speech pat- terns devoid of human inflection or digression. The Op is located in San Francisco, an appropriate city for the gothic atmospheres of Hammett's scenery. The fog hangs low, and figures are ob- scured like ghosts wandering in and out of the darkness. In "The Big Knockover," the shadows themselves are personified, speak and vanish. The Op is often performing the function of the shadow, tailing unsuspecting nomads of the city. During pursuits, Hammett inserts precise geographies of the city streets, reminiscent of D6blin's insertion of urban topographies in Berlin Alexanderplatz. Hammett's interiors, perfectly appropriated by noirfilm, are defined by their angular composition and harsh dark and light contrast. A typical inte- rior is described in "The House on Turk Street": the hall was lighted with the glow that filtered through the glass from the street lights. The stairway leading to the second-story threw a triangular shadow across part of the hall-a shadow that was black enough for any purpose. I crouched low in this three-cor- nered slice of night, and waited. (109) This highly expressionistic scenography suggests the anthropomorphic char- acter of darkness that seeks to penetrate the interior. The unstable demar- cation of inside and outside dramatizes the threat posed to urban interiors by the external forces of crime and darkness. The Op as the morally am- bivalent figure who crosses that boundary is significantly attracted to the darkness in which he seeks refuge and the cover of invisibility. The Op's invisibility constitutes the foremost characteristic of his wa- vering and mutable identity. His capacity as detective consists mainly in his ability to disappear into the background or transform his personality to de- ceive his antagonists. He is presented without preexisting personal relation- ships or familial antecedents. Just as he busily removes all traces of his pres- ence before leaving the scene of a crime, he is constantly erasing his iden- tity in personal relationships. The absence of stable identity in Hammett's work corresponds to an 130</page><page sequence="13">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS epistemological uncertainty concerning the nature of being. The anthro- pomorphic character of objects suggests a capacity for mutability that un- dermines the potential for a fixed essence. The symbol for this epistemo- logical emptiness is the Maltese falcon: the priceless artifact of historical significance that motivates a global pursuit and inspires a murderous deter- mination in all those attempting to take it into possession. At the conclu- sion of the novel, the falcon turns out to be counterfeit: an empty projec- tion of the fictions imposed on it by imagination. The verbal reticence of so many of Hammett's figures can be partially ascribed to a conviction that the act of signification is a philosophically fu- tile process that does nothing to alter the fundamental emptiness of signi- fied phenomena. The Op's customary reliance on tautological utterances reflects a conscious inability to construct an authentic discursive response. After hearing the impassioned confession of a murderous bank clerk strug- gling to understand his own motives, the Op reflects, "I couldn't find any- thing to say except something meaningless, like: 'Things happen that way"' (Red Harvest 57-58). The emptiness of signification in Hammett's work negates the possibil- ity of satisfactory closure to the mysteries and puzzles conjured up in his narratives. The conclusions of his novels are always vaguely unsettling be- cause the final solutions seem like false constructions and shed suspicion on the inventive powers of the detective. The Thin Man concludes with a highly conjectural and somewhat preposterous explanation of events by the protagonist, who concedes that his hypothetical resolution is based on speculation. The last word of the book belongs to his wife, Nora, who re- sponds, "That may be, but it's all pretty unsatisfactory" (180). This is a star- tling concluding note for a genre conventionally based on the expectation of definitive resolution and stable closure. How does a detective operate in an epistemologically uncertain uni- verse in which there is no stable truth behind the deceptive illusions on the surface? The Op responds by abandoning the chimerical search for con- cealed master narratives and instead scrambles signification by inventing falsehoods and projecting them onto phenomena. The Op's most impor- tant talent thus becomes his capacity for discursive intervention as a means of generating conflict. Unlike most detective figures, he rarely resorts to physical coercion, but rather relies on his ability to spread rumor and cre- ate subversive alliances and antagonisms. He walks into a boxing ring in Red Harvest, and merely by the utterance of the phrase "Back to Philly, Al" (72)-which conceals a false threat of reprisal against one of the fighters- he manages to unfix the fight and provoke a series of murders and conflicts among rival gangs. He routinely fixes false alibis for himself and manufac- 131</page><page sequence="14">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE tures evidence against others. In "The Golden Horseshoe," unable to sus- tain a conviction due to lack of evidence, he invents a false crime to hang a criminal for a murder he didn't commit. The Op's illicit tactics of detection suggest the profound moral ambiva- lence of his identity and activity. The diabolical character of Hammett's pro- tagonists is reinforced by the visual analogy of Spade to Satan in the first paragraph of The Maltese Falcon. Edenbaum refers to the Op's method as "not a divine plan but a satanic disorder" (92). The subversive potential to collapse systems of signification places these characters in opposition to the reified administrative structures that dominate and determine their envi- ronment. In Red Harvest, the Op explains his twisted methodology to Dinah Brand: "Plans are all right sometimes ... and sometimes just stirring things up is all right-if you're tough enough to survive, and keep your eyes open so you'll see what you want when it comes to the top" (79). Freedman and Kendrick translate this strategy as "the apparently spontaneous capacity both to activate the energies present in the dialogic world and to weather the anarchic psychological and social effects that are thus set in motion" (217). The Op works to short-circuit the machinery of social relations through an expenditure of surplus energy; his liberating function is his destructive ca- pacity for dismantling systems of signification and discursive alliances and preserving himself in the process of their collapse. Hammett's detectives operate as agents of sabotage in the manner of Benjamin's "Destructive Character": "For destroying rejuvenates in clearing away the traces of our own age; it cheers because everything cleared away means to the destroyer a complete reduction, indeed eradication, of his own condition" (Reflections 301). This reduction and eradication is per- formed by the narrative as well, which obliterates referential capacities through a relentless application of dissonant aesthetic maneuvers designed to dismantle narrative content. The utopian aspect of this narrative is achieved by the momentary liberation from ossified discursive reifications. Freedman and Kendrick contrast modes of detection in Hammett with conventional detective narration by explaining that "it involves not the de- coding of a discrete series of facts but, rather, an encoding process that acti- vates the surplus energy inherent in his world" (217). It is within this en- coding process that the Op enacts his rebellion against instrumental rea- son. By imposing his own creative narrative on the world, he constructs a utopian moment that evades the administrative imperatives of his work. He momentarily defies the mechanisms that otherwise determine his reified function, and gives his labor the aesthetic character of play. 132</page><page sequence="15">EXPRESSIONIST REIFICATIONS WORKS CITED Benjamin, Walter.
