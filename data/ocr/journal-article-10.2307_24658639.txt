<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ontological Responsibility and the Poetics of Nature JOHN LLEWELYN Edinburgh Emmanuel Levinas argues that Heidegger is so preoccupied with giving being its due that he fails to do justice to the human being who is my neighbor. It could be argued that Levinas is so preoccupied with doing justice to the human being that he fails to do justice to the nonhuman being, for Levinas confines direct responsibility to responsibility toward the human being. Could it be argued that Heidegger's preoccupation with giving being its due allows both human and nonhuman beings to be given their due? More particularly, does his reflection on the question of being through Hölderlin's poetics of the holy allow, perhaps even imply, a less exclusive view of direct responsibility? What light is shed on the Auseinandersetzung between Heideg ger and Levinas by the Auseinandersetzung between Heidegger and Hölderlin? An approach to the first conversation through the second is all the more apt on account of the tendency Levinas displays in some of his writings to impute irresponsibility to poetry and to art in general. It is to be expected that he would find the poetry of Hölderlin especially lacking in a sense of responsi bility in so far as it speaks of nature. Responsibility, Levinas maintains, is beyond nature, beyond phusis, metaphysical. Poetry can awaken a sense of responsibility toward nature by describing the aesthetic beauty of natural things. One cannot be indifferent to the survival of something of whose beauty we are aware. Hölderlin's poetry of nature is not nature poetry of this kind, at least not predominantly, nor is it for</page><page sequence="2">4 JOHN LLEWELYN descriptions of the aesthetically beautiful that Heidegger turns to it. In the essay on Andenken included in Erläuterungen zu Hölderlins Dichtung, Heidegger writes that as early as the date of his Hyperion Hölderlin evinces a distaste for descriptive poetry. This is one of the attractions Hölderlin holds for Heideg ger. The former's distaste is matched by the latter's aversion to the contem plation of landscapes. As thinker Heidegger is no more likely to admire the spectacle of his surroundings than are the Swabian farmers and foresters to whom he refers in "Creative Landscape: Why Do We Stay in the Provinces?" (G 13)1 or the peasant referred to in the first verse of Hölderlin's Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . who, although it is on the morning of a holiday that he is visiting his fields, is not there to gaze at the view but to check how well his crops have stood up to the thunder storm that raged during the night. His main concern is for the future. "Assured, he looks forward to the coming gifts of the field and vine. Fruit and man are protected in the favour that prevails through earth and sky, securing what endures" (G 4, 51). Is not the first verse of Hölderlin's poem descriptive? Heidegger himself says that it is as though its aim were to describe a picture. However, it is not description for its own sake or for the sake of recording or impressing the reader with the aesthetic beauty or picturesqueness of the scene. The point of the description is to draw an analogy between the poet and the peasant. Like the countryman, the poet is supported by nature. Nature for Hölderlin is not the aggregate of stones, trees, animals, etc. The aggregate of such real entities is the outcome of nature. Hence, although elms, poplars, clouds, lightning, rivers, and streams figure in his poems, they do not do so for their own sakes. This might well be a disappointment to anyone hoping to find in Hölderlin a foundation for the construction of a concept of direct human responsibility toward nonhuman beings, that is to say, a responsibility to nonhuman beings which is not derivative from a responsibility to human beings. Such disap pointment would be misplaced if it were the result of supposing that something can be approached for its own sake only if it is approached in isolation from other things. Just as other human beings can be esteemed for their own sakes although their lives are inextricably bound up with those of other human beings and with a nonhuman environment on which they depend for their existence, so nonhuman beings can be cherished for their own sakes despite or because of such interconnection. True, it is not an ecological connection of a biological or social kind that Hölderlin and Heidegger have in mind when they speak of the interconnectedness entailed by their notions of nature; but the latter might be an enabling condition of the former: the ontological origin of the ontic relationship, the relationship of all other relationships. If the poetry of Hölderlin is nature poetry it is because for Hölderlin nature is the always and already present. Omnipresent, nature is present not only in</page><page sequence="3">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 5 what is set over against the human. Nature, in Wordsworth's phrase, "rolls through all things." It is present not only in stones, plants and animals. Its presencing embraces also the work and works of man, the history and destiny of peoples, and the so-called supernatural and divine. Nature, as understood by Hölderlin, has a beauty that is, he says, divine; but nature is not a goddess or a god. Nature, in his sense, holds together what are usually contrasted as the natural and supernatural. But this holding together is not a neutral synthesis or undifferentiated intimacy. Although in Hyperion Hölderlin treats of a desire to become absorbed in an undifferentiated one and all, very soon thereafter he emphasizes the importance of difference, a shift that anticipates Hegel's dissatisfaction with the night of Schellingian identity. Like Hegel, Hölderlin stresses the alterity (Andersheit) that invests the unity of nature. In this apartness the extreme opposites, the higher and lower in the classical chain of being, are at their most conspicuous and most captivating. In the second edition of the Erläuterungen (1951) Heidegger notes, presumably with Phaedrus 250 in mind: ekphanestaton , , to kalon erasmiötaton. Highlighted through extreme opposition, the appearances are lovable, lovely, and captivating, das Berückende. If this loveliness is the loveliness which the gods are capable of making appear, it is not pure beauty. Where there is pure beauty, there is an accord of captivation and setting free, Entrückung. Of all the beings there are, it is the gods who are preeminent in the capacity to make manifest the captivatingly beautiful, as when one of them shows himself, like the god incarnate in Christ. A god is also the being best able to provide mortals with an experience of Entrückung, as in the transport of mystical abandon. That is why the beauty of nature is called divine. It is called divine by analogy with the impure beauty of which the gods are capable. Only nature is capable of pure beauty, for this requires, not captivation masquerading as setting free, nor setting free masquerading as captivation, but both simultaneously, yet without the clear distinction be tween them getting lost to view. It is as though Hölderlin, after dreaming with his Hyperion and Empedocles of saving himself by losing consciousness of himself through immersion in nature or death, realizes that he is dreaming and that he must wake in order, like Empedocles, to shoulder his responsi bilities, among them the special responsibility of the poet in the time of need. It is as though, having been inclined, like Levinas, to equate art with reverie, intoxicated revelry, magic, or mystical confusion, he wants, like Celan, to show that a poem can reach out soberly to shake its reader by the hand. What Hölderlin calls the pure and divine beauty of nature is not what we have been calling aesthetic beauty. The latter is the beauty of the appearances</page><page sequence="4">6 JOHN LLEWELYN of entities taken in isolation and framed, the beauty of the world dismem bered, in seiner Widerspenstigkeit auseinandergespannt, as Heidegger says, or, as Michel Deguy and Frangois Fedier translate this phrase, ecarlele, rent in four. Their translation is inspired perhaps by the conception of nature as a fourfold (Geviert) which Heidegger draws from his reading of Hölderlin. An understanding of Heidegger's studies of Hölderlin's poems and of the notion of the fourfold of earth, sky, mortals, and immortal divinities is advanced by the reading of such pieces as "The Thing," "Building Dwelling Thinking," "The Origin of the Work of Art," and "The Question Concerning Technol ogy." In addition to mapping out the topography of the fourfold, the latter essays elaborate the difference between objects and things. Conversely, the interpretations of Hölderlin explain the role that the thinking poet plays in enabling the turn from regarding beings as objects to treating them as things. This turning is a turning from the everyday mode of seeing entities as either subservient to the achievement of human interest (zuhanden) or else tempor arily disengaged from such service so as to become the object of disinterested description and pure science (vorhanden). The alternative way of being with beings to which the thinking poet and the poet thinker would have their readers attend puts in its place the referential context (Verweisungsganzheit) that serviceability and even the project of pure science presuppose, locating it from the perspective of a quite differently structured whole. Heidegger would say, perhaps having in mind that, as well as meaning to refer, verweisen can mean to displace, that the Verweisungsganzheiten of handiness and scientific method and system are ontologically secondary to the totality hinted at when on page 70 of Being and Time he writes of the power of nature, Naturmacht, an allusion picked up twelve years later in the lecture on Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . where nature is called powerful precisely because it is divinely beautiful and omnipresent. Its omnipresence is an aspect of its beauty in that the beautiful, the schön, is the appearing, the Erscheinen, that shines from each thing as a point of convergence of each region of the fourfold. This belonging together of each partner in the fourfold is what makes the difference between a being's being an object and a being's being a thing. The Ding is the meeting place of the four members through whose belonging together and responding to one another the Ding is constituted a Ding: bedingt. (The Scottish town Dingwall gets its name from the Norse Thingvollr meaning parliament field.) Just as pure beauty is beauty of nature, not of the gods, and the beauty of nature is called godly by an analogy in which an attribute of a being is extended to what is not a being, so the power which is ordinarily attributed to the gods devolves upon them thanks to nature. Their life comes from nature which is divine and is now named the holy, das Heilige (G 4, 64). The heil is the unbroken, the whole. The holy is also pure on Heidegger's interpretation of Hölderlin, according to which, as we saw, beauty is pure</page><page sequence="5">ONTO LOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 7 because it respects the distinctness of the partners that belong in the holy. Impure beauty is manifest where nature is confused with a natural being, hence where nature is identified with a god or an object of mystical com munion. The holiness of which Hölderlin and Heidegger speak shares with the Hebrew qadosh this implication of apartness and purity. The holy is the radically other, das Un-nahbare (G 4, 63), the untouched and inapproachable. However, its apartness is not the apartness of a being such as the God of the Old Testament, or of a rabbinical mysticism that emphasizes God's utter and unutterable remoteness and denies the possibility of mystic union. On Heidegger's interpretation of Hölderlin, the holy is beyond habitual experi ence and deprives every experience of any firm base. Nature is no more a ground, on Heidegger's reading of Hölderlin, than earth in "The Origin of the Work of Art" is a sufficient ground. Only a being can be a sufficient ground. What the denkende Dichter, Hölderlin, calls nature is not a being. It is what the dichtende Denker, Heidegger, calls being; and it is what calls to be reflected on in its difference from beings. What Hölderlin helps Heidegger to say is that the relationship between man and nature is a belonging that does not annul the distinction between the regions of the fourfold of which man is himself one member. Rather as, in Being and Time, Sein is already presencing in Da-sein, so, in the later writings, man belongs to himself only when he belongs listeningly to the other members of the fourfold. The fourfold is at the same time a onefold. It is a four in one. Having proceeded to a fundamental ontology judged to be neglected in Husserl's regional ontology, Heidegger becomes discontented with the fundamental ontology of Being and Time and, assisted by Hölderlin, outlines a quarternitology that takes up again the question of regionality and insists that the regions are in-finitely (un-endlich) and internally (innig) related (G 4, 163, 170). But if only the regions as regions are internally related, what hope is there of deriving from Heidegger's quaternitology pointers toward a protoecological conception of responsibility? It is already beginning to become plain in "The Origin of the Work of Art" and the study of Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . and has become quite clear in "The Thing" (1950) and Hölderlins Erde und Himmel (1959) that the belonging together of the regions has immediate consequ ences for the interrelationships among things in the regions. The thinker as such is primarily concerned with how the reciprocity among individual things of different regions exhibits the, so to speak, "categorial" reciprocity among the regions, whereas the poet as such is primarily concerned with the reciprocity among individual things. This is why we can formulate the difference between dichtendes Denken and denkendes Dichten by saying that whereas the vocation of the former is the being of beings, the vocation of the latter is the being of beings.2 And this is why Heidegger can say that neither while "nature" is a basic word for Hölderlin nor when it is no longer a basic</page><page sequence="6">8 JOHN LLEWELYN word for him does Hölderlin understand being as such any more than phusis is being as such for Heraclitus. This does not mean that they do not have what in Being and Time is called a preontological, that is to say, preanalytical, understanding of being. All mortals have that. Because the difference between the poet and the thinker is one of emphasis, a particular person may be both, as were both Heidegger and Hölderlin. Heidegger's relationship with Hölderlin is an aspect of his relationship to himself, an aspect of his own identity. But this notion of identity must be interpreted in the light of the notion of the fourfold. It cannot be based on a constatation of scientific or metaphysical properties. Science, lay or sophisti cated, can provide an account of the identity of an object or subject, but an object or a subject is not a thing in the sense explained by Heidegger in his essay entitled "The Thing" and in "Building Dwelling Thinking." When in these essays and elsewhere Heidegger writes of what makes a jug a jug or a bridge a bridge, he is not substituting for descriptions of objects in terms of primary and secondary qualities descriptions in terms of functions. He denies explicitly in his discussion of Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . that a thing is what it does. "The truth of the matter is that a thing does only what it is," and every thing, including every human being, " 'is' only according to the 'way' nature, the holy, which draws its essence from itself, remains present in it" (G 4, 65). Hence in the paragraphs where Heidegger writes that a jug, unlike a hammer or a scythe, permits the pouring out of a drink or libation provided it is not empty, whereas the hammer and the scythe neither succeed nor fail in permitting this, he is not aiming at a classification of the functional proper ties that provide criteria by which jugs are distinguished from other artifacts. What he is primarily concerned with is not the properties possessed by objects which define their nature, but the belonging of a thing within the fourfold of nature or being as a whole in relation to which identification and classification into natural or artificial kinds are of ontologically secondary concern. II We are asking whether, following the account of belonging within the fourfold that Heidegger derives from Hölderlin, we can derive or forge an account of responsibility broad enough to accommodate direct responsibility toward nonhuman beings. Is not Heidegger's account too accommodating? For is not the reciprocity and mirroring of which his account speaks a correspondence among all members of the fourfold? Hence, if an account of responsibility is to be derived from the Hölderlin-Heidegger account of the fourfold, will it not be one that permits a responsibility not only of human beings towards other</page><page sequence="7">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 9 human beings and nonhuman beings but also a responsibility of nonhuman beings toward other beings? To meet this difficulty we must look in what Heidegger and Hölderlin write, for what they consider makes a difference between the belonging of mortals to the fourfold and the belonging of immortals, sky, and earth. This distinguishing factor must not be the ethical character of man's responsibil ity, for Heidegger denies that he is dealing with a question of ethics. Of course, if he denies this because, like Levinas and Kant, he holds that ethical responsibility, or at least direct ethical responsibility, is always responsibility of human beings toward other human beings, this bodes ill for our hopes of learning from him how to see our way to a conception of direct responsibility toward nonhuman beings, including nonhuman beings that are not divine. We should be put on the way to such a conception, however, if the mode in which human beings belong to the other members of the fourfold could be specified so as to yield a conception of what we might call ontological responsibility that a human being can have toward a jug or a tree, but that a jug or a tree can not have toward a human being. Is this specification provided by letting be or letting belong? Is Seinlassen or Gehörenlassen what marks off man's belonging to the fourfold from the way in which nonhuman beings belong? In the third verse of Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . Hölderlin writes: And they who smiling worked our fields for us, Assuming the shape of labourers, now are known, The all-alive, all-animating powers of the gods. Heidegger comments that the word "field" here is a passing reference to the first verse and stands for that on and from which man lives. It deserves comment, too, that the Greek word for field or allotted abode is nomos and that this is affiliated to nomos, usage or apportioning law. Man once cultivated the fields without being insensitive to the omnipresence of the holy. But he has been in too much haste to subdue nature to his own needs. The poet is the one who can remind us that man is not the only participant in the fourfold that has needs. Man himself is needed by the others, by the immortals, by the sky and by the earth. It is thanks to this recognition of needs other than human need that we can speak of a human responsibility which is, if not yet ethical responsibility, already more than response as aesthetic Erlebnis. Earlier in the third verse Hölderlin writes: A fire has been lit in the souls of the poets. And that which happened before, but hardly was felt, Only now is manifest, The feeling here alluded to is stabilized, on Heidegger's reading, through being attached to a structure of reciprocal ontological need. When Heidegger</page><page sequence="8">10 JOHN LLEWELYN reflects on the poems of Hölderlin after publishing Being and Time, he does not abandon his analytic of Dasein. Although he abandons the terminology in which he conducts this analysis, he is keeping the promise he made in Being and Time to go on and reflect on being, instead of concentrating his attention on There-being. At no time does Heidegger turn a deaf ear to the words of Parmenides' Fragment 6: chre to legein te noein t'eon emmenai. Parmenides' chre is ontological need. It is this that is in Heidegger's thoughts when he writes in Hölderlins Erde und Himmel, after citing Hölderlin's fragments: Die Erde. . . . Grossen Gesetzen nachgehet, die Wissenschaft Und Zärtlichkeit. . . . "The earth 'abides by great laws.' The 'laws' here named are the nomoi in the sense of the injunctions of great destiny that direct and allot each thing to the place required by its essencing" (nach seinem Wesen gebraucht ist) (G 4, 167). Admittedly, it is verging on anachronism to employ the expression "ontologi cal need" in connection with something Heidegger says as late as 1959. By then his thinking is centred on Ereignis and es gibt rather than on the contrast between "ontic" and "ontological." We employ the word "ontological" nevertheless because it is handy to have an adjective cognate with "being" and because it keeps in view the question of the bearing of what Heidegger says about and through the word brauchen upon Levinas's response to Heidegger which continues to be cast in terms of the ontological, the ontic and the ethical. More particularly, the expression "ontological need" makes it possible to mark the difference between Heidegger's brauchen and the vital needs of whose satisfaction and enjoyment Levinas treats in detail especially in Totality and Infinity. Levinas and other readers of Heidegger have com mented on his neglect of the topic of life and its enjoyment. That this neglect is not an oversight can be seen from his gloss on Brauch in "The Anaximander Fragment" (1946). There we come across the notion of what it is convenient to call ontological enjoyment which he explicitly distinguishes from enjoy ment of biological, psychological and any other animal or anthropological kind. Heidegger would say that ontological enjoyment is phenomenologically more original than these ontic enjoyments. Levinas would say that more original than both ontic and ontological enjoyment is ethical responsibility toward the other man. Our question is whether ontological need and ontological enjoyment, as explained by Heidegger with recourse to Hölderlin and the Greeks, bring with them a notion, albeit pre- or protoethical and pre or protojuridical, of ontological responsibility. That it does is suggested by the way in which Heidegger, in conformity with his belief that if we are to think the eschatology of being we must think the Greek morning of the history of being through its Hesperian departure (Abschied) and through the</page><page sequence="9">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 11 impending dawn which is at issue for Hölderlin and for us today, interprets Parmenides' Fragment 6 and the Anaximander fragment kata to chrtön; didonai gar auta diken kai tisin allelois tes adikias. The translation of these words at which Heidegger eventually arrives is: ... entlang dem Brauch; gehören nämlich lassen sie Fug somit auch Ruch eines dem anderen (im Verwinden) des Un-Fugs (H 342), for which David Krell's translation is: "... along the lines of usage; for they let order and thereby also reck belong to one another (in the surmounting) of disorder" (EGT 57). In the course of his discussion of the Anaximander fragment, Heidegger notes that the generally accepted Diels translation of kata to chreön and the translation that Nietzsche gives in Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks is "according to necessity," nach der Notwendigkeit. Of this translation Heidegger writes: "we err if we adhere to this derived meaning exclusively" (H 337, EGT 51). This suggests that the derived meaning is part of what the phrase means, that some notion of Notwendigkeit must be included in our reading of the Greek. Our suggestion is that the expression "ontological need" be adopted to convey this notion. The adjective "ontological" serves to warn that Heidegger considers "it is needed" or "it is necessary," on its own, inadequate and superficial (WHD 117, WCT 190), requiring supplementa tion by some notion of usage or custom. The problem is, to some extent, that of keeping the connection between the noun Brauch, meaning usage, and the verb brauchen, meaning to need, of reading Anaximander's kata to chreön along with Parmenides' chre, and of reading Hölderlin and Heidegger along with what is said by these two Greeks and by Heraclitus. The usage or custom at issue here is "older" than the Sitten that are at issue for Hegel, though, like them, it is geared to what is in some sense useful, needed, called for or meet. Heidegger goes as far as to say of brauchet in the lines of Hölderlin's Die Titanen·. unter dem Maasse measure demands that Das Rohen brauchet es auch Crudity, coarseness, exist, so that Damit das Reine sich kenne What is pure shall know itself "Perhaps we shall be able to hear Hölderlin's language properly only when we comprehend the 'it is meet' that is beginning to sound in the chre of Parmenides' saying" and "In this Brauchen is hidden a calling (Geheiss) and command (Anbefehlen)" (WHD 118-119, WCT 196). Responding to this call is in die Acht nehmen or achten. Corresponding to ontological need is ontological heed, taking to heart in care and esteem, schätzen, allowing a thing the enjoyment of flourishing according to what is meet: ontological usufruct. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines usufruct as "right of enjoying the use and advantages of another's property short of destruction or waste of its sub stance." This conveys something of what Heidegger wants to have us</page><page sequence="10">12 JOHN LLEWELYN understand by Brauchen and to chreon provided that ontological enjoyment is not confused with the ontic enjoyments of human consumers. To prevent this confusion he refers us to the archaic German verb brücken, to brook, and to Augustine's gloss on frui as praesto habere, where the praesitum or hupokeimenon is "that which already lies before us in unconcealment, ousia, that which lingers awhile in presence" (H 338, EGT 53). So brauchen in this context does not mean only to be in need of, benötigen. Its primary "high" meaning is to let a thing be what it is and how it is, etwas in dem Belassen, was es ist und wie es ist (WHD 168, WCT 191), "to admit into its essential nature and to keep safely what has been admitted." In two words: Seinlassen and Gehörenlassen. Ill In Der Ister Hölderlin writes: Es brauchet aber Stiche der Fels It is however meet that the Und Furchen die Erd', rock be broached Unwirthbar war es, ohne Weile; And the earth furrowed, Without welcome would it be else, unabiding; "In this passage," Heidegger writes, "the 'meet' designates an essential belonging together of rock and well-shaft, earth and furrow. This essential belonging together is in turn determined by the nature of welcome and abiding." He adds: "The welcome and the abiding are what mark the dwelling of mortals upon earth. But dwelling, in its turn, is not grounded in itself" (WHD 169, WCT 192). That is to say, the welcome, accueil, that according to Levinas is a welcome of the other person into my home, handshake and giving, is encompassed within a wider hospitality that Heidegger construes ultimately as the es gibt of Sein articulated by the holy fourfold of nature with the aid of the German poet of poets and the thinking of being that is emergent in the Greeks. Abiding (Weilen or Verweilen) and hospitality {Bewirten), as represented in Hölderlin's poem by sinking a well for water and ploughing a field to plant corn, are contrasted in Heidegger's thinking, as is accueil in the philosophy of Levinas, with sheer persistence in being, Sucht des Beharrens (Η 331, EGT 46), that is to say, with what according to Levinas is typified by the conatus essendi in the system of Spinoza that shuts out from his Ethics the least trace of the ethical. Beharren is inconsiderateness, thoughtlessness, whereas Verweilen is taking time, the attentive and patient dwelling that is called for by "the dwelling (wohnen) of mortals on this earth." Beings that abide rather than persist "let order belong, and thereby also reck, to one another," didonai. . . tisin allelois. But the other in Heidegger's thinking of being is not only the other human being. The other is not only the human neighbor who is the centre of gravity from whose point of view my</page><page sequence="11">ONTO LOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 13 striving to persist is, in Levinas's metaphysic of ethics, accused. The other, in Heidegger's retrieval of Hölderlin and Anaximander, includes other mortals, but it also includes other regions of the fourfold. This perhaps is one of the reasons why Heidegger "presumes" to say that the Anaximander fragment, cited, it will be recalled, in Nietzsche's Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, puts into words an experience of beings in their being that is neither pessimistic nor optimistic nor nihilistic but tragic. As Heidegger makes clear in "The Letter on Humanism" and "The Anaximander Fragment," which date from the same year, he is not purporting to advance a metaphysical or ethical view of the world. His purport is to interpret the conflictual belonging together alluded to in Heraclitus's remark that phusis is polemical. We catch a glimpse of the nonmetaphysical, nonethical, nonpsychological and non aesthetical essence of tragedy when we read Anaximander's didonai, not just as giving away, Weggeben, but as granting, Zugeben. "Such giving lets some thing belong to another which properly belongs to him." What belongs to him belongs to him not as a consequence of a contract between him and me. To this extent Heidegger sees my giving to another human being, for example, giving him a drink, as Levinas sees my giving to the other the bread from my mouth: as a giving of what is owed prior to ethical, juridical, and any other social contract. Both authors are conducting a radical rethinking of the foundations of the traditional theories of natural justice and natural law. However, where Levinas argues for a meta-physical grounding or dis grounding, Abgründen, outside the realm of nature, epekeina tes ousias, Heideg ger's Abgründen is meta-metaphysical in the sense that it breaks with philosophy that posits an ultimate principle of sufficient ground; and yet, paradoxically, it is also physical in the sense that it thinks phusis and nature as the being of beings, not, like metaphysics, physics, and the other sciences of nature, as their beingness. Hence whereas for Levinas, following Plato, primary justice is non natural, for Heidegger, following Hölderlin and the pre-Platonic Greeks, original justice is dike "thought from being as presencing" (H 329, EGT 43). Furthermore, according to Heidegger, this primary justice or Fug is de manded of mortal beings toward every other being, to whatever presences itself, whatever whiles (weilt), whatever comes to be and passes away in the totality which is the four in one. When mortals regard other mortals and nonmortal beings as no more than commodities to which we have recourse for the satisfaction of human need, greed and will to power, there is primary ontological injustice, adikia. What Levinas considers to be secondary justice arises only when the third person is taken into account. Then I can be confronted with problems of distributive justice and with moral dilemmas that may have the structure of irresoluble tragedy. It follows from what Heideg ger tells us, however, that the tensions between claims and counterclaims</page><page sequence="12">14 JOHN LLEWELYN that constitute this structure are there from the beginning. Indeed, they are there already at the level of primary dual justice for Levinas, too, if the trace of the third person is never absent from the second person's eyes. The other other is always there in Heidegger's view because to be mortal is to be Be-Dingt, be-thinged (VA II 53, PLT 181), bedingt, conditioned both by other mortals and by nonhuman beings that call to be given their due and to be seen not merely as objects but as things in the high sense of the word that Hölderlin teaches us. The essence of tragedy according to Hölderlin is the simultaneity of the "monstrous" (ungeheuer) belonging together and apartness of men and gods, mortals and immortals. In the Anmerkungen gum Odipus he writes: "The representation of the tragic depends above all on comprehend ing the monstrosity of the coming together of god and man and of the infinite union through demonic strife of the power of nature and what is most profoundly human, as the purification of infinite union through infinite separation." This is how Hölderlin sees his own Trauerspiel The Death of Empedocles, and the works of Greek tragic art which he translated, Oedipus Tyrannus and Antigone, the last of these three being the work containing the chorus that Heidegger discusses in An Introduction to Metaphysics and elsewhere in connection with Hölderlin and that treats of the same theme of man's place in nature as is treated in lines we have reproduced from Wie wenn am Feiertage . . . and Der Ister. It is precisely in the work of art that there takes place this tragic conflict of which Hölderlin and Heidegger speak, in the work of art and in the poet who is the mediator between the gods and other men. This tragic separateness in unity holds for the bond between logos and phusis (EM 103ff, IM 114ff). It holds therefore not simply for the relations between man and man and between man and the gods. It holds too for the relation between mortals and all the other regions of the fourfold. We must now consider more closely the difficulty that this consequence presents. In doing so we shall answer the still unanswered question about Seinlassen and Gehörenlassen asked in section II. IV The endeavour to elicit from Heidegger, Hölderlin, and the early Greeks an ecologically broadened understanding of responsibility requires that in giv ing being its due we also do justice to beings. This attempt would be embarrassed by the supposition Heidegger makes in the Postscript to "What is Metaphysics?" in 1943 that "being doubtless prevails without beings, but a being never is without being." Fortunately, in the 1949 version of the Postscript this sentence is changed to "being never prevails without beings, a being never is without being" (G 9, 306, EB 385). As Heidegger writes in "The Anaximander Fragment," "to be the being of beings is the matter of</page><page sequence="13">ONTO LOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 15 being" (H 335, EGT 50). We have seen that "The Anaximander Fragment" also says, however, that the alternatives of persisting insistently in its own being and taking heed of what is due to other beings is open to every being, not to human beings alone. Does this imply anthropomorphism?3 That implication would incommode at least one participant in the "Conversation on a Country Path," namely, the man of science who, when asked by the man of learning "What name should we give to the regioning of that which regions (das Gegnen der Gegnet) with respect to the thing?" responds "It can hardly be regioning with respect to man (die Vergegnis) for that is the relation of that which regions to Gelassenheit, and Gelassenheit is supposed to shelter in itself the essence of thinking, whereas things themselves do not think" (Gel 54, DT 75-76). May we assume that Gelassenheit, usually translated as "releasement" or "being released," is the family name for Seinlassen, Gehörenlassen and other formations with lassen to which Heidegger has re course? One way of escaping the anthropomorphism that appears to be implied in our reading of Heidegger's reading of Anaximander would be simply to decide that Heidegger is here putting his finger on an assumption made by Anaximander which we are free to set aside as outdated and misleading for our purposes, and that we can take seriously only the account of Verweilen to be found in those paragraphs of "The Thing" in which the Verweilen of the four regions is an aspect of their being coincident in a human practice such as pouring out a drink. We could say, for instance, that Anaximander is engaged in speculative natural science that posits an environment in which organisms and other entities are engaged in a struggle for existence, hence disposed to appropriate whatever they need for their survival or to adapt themselves in other ways conducive to the survival of the species. There is no reason to believe that Heidegger's interpretation of Anaximander and other early Greek thinkers is eclectic in this sense and no sign that in his glosses he perceives them as natural scientists speculating on physical, biological, or other objects and events. That way of perceiving them would be deemed anachronistic by Heidegger because it appeals to an idea of objectivity and event that emerges only in a later epoch of Western thought. If we reflect on this later conception, as he says we must if we are to understand what it is for something to be a thing (VA II 58, PLT 185), we may recognize that perhaps it is because of the difficulty we have breaking away from this scientifico-methodological conception that we find ourselves confronted with the dilemma from which we are trying to find an exit: the choice between humanizing the Verweilen of non-human beings and dehumanizing the Verweilen of human beings in order to cope with the apparent implication of Heidegger's commentary on Anaximander that beings of all regions heed one another and let one another be and belong. Perhaps this dilemma arises</page><page sequence="14">16 JOHN LLEWELYN precisely because we have failed to think of things in our reading of Heideg ger's pages on the fourfold and persist in conceiving them as individual objects in isolation one from another or interconnected only by some physi cally, biologically, psychologically causal, or other scientifically discoverable ontic relation. Whereas, as we have noted, Heidegger's exposition of the fourfold is a reversion to regional ontology and a revision of the Husserlian version in the light of the question as to the meaning of being as such. So the question of what Heidegger means by a thing can be answered only if we acknowledge its inseparability from the question of the meaning of being. Now Heidegger never turns his back on the thought he discerns in Parme nides' Fragment 6. Whatever turn there may be in his thinking of Dasein when he departs from his original plan for the completion of Being and Time, he continues to hold that being is in need of thinking and therefore in need of man because only man is capable of thinking the as such of being as distinct from representing it. The mirroring that thinking is, is no more the portrayal of a likeness than is the mirroring, "each in its own way" (VA II 52, PLT 179), with which the nonhuman regions of the fourfold also respond. We are representing and therefore misrepresenting the fourfold if we treat it only as some sort of picture or diagram, a landscape for our contemplation, the Darstellen eines Abbildes (ibid.), just as we fatally misrepresent the Kantian schema if we reify it, taking as Vorstellung what should be taken as Verfahren—or, Heidegger might say, as Erfahren. True, in conceiving the fourfold as a complex object or a complex of objects we are not leaving man out of the picture, since man is one of the four. But his belonging with the regions and their belonging with him "cannot be conceived at all so long as we want to re-present it to ourselves, that is, forcibly bring before ourselves an objectively given relation between an object called 'man' and an object called 'that which regions' (Gegnet)" (Gel 64, DT 83). If we do so conceive it, we shall imagine that when Heidegger calls the human members of the fourfold mortals, he is just wanting to remind us that their lives come to an end. In "The Thing," that is to say as late as 1950, he writes that mortals are those who are capable of death as death. That may sound like another statement of fact. If that is how we hear it, what Heidegger means has not gotten home. Only when we become mortals will we begin to understand what is at stake in his quaternitology. That understanding will be a self understanding. This does not mean that it will not be an understanding of others too. There is no self-understanding that is not at the same time an understanding of others, of others of all four regions. But mortals, surely, are not understood by earth and sky, or by jugs, bridges, rivers, and trees. We do not want to be committed to saying that they are, do we, by the fact that in "The Anaximander Fragment" Heidegger appears not to have any difficulty with the thought that beings of every region</page><page sequence="15">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 17 linger or abide, (ver)weilen? Although David Krell's translation introduces an "every" into his version of Heidegger's zum anderen Weiligen, that this conveys the author's sense is clear from the beginning of the sentence in question: "Only when we have already thought ta eonta as what is present, and this as the totality of what lingers awhile . . (H 332, EGT 47). The relevant distinction is, not that between beings of different kinds, but that between different ways of beirig of every being, the way of persisting and the way of lingering or abiding. This is confirmed by the trouble Heidegger takes to explain that when he translates Anaximander's tisis by considerateness or reck, Rücksicht, the word must be understood in a neutral (but presumably not neuter) sense which permits of nonhuman beings being "considerate" or "solicitous." The inverted commas here are a guard against anthropo morphism, as, too, is the qualification that each region of the fourfold mirrors "in its own way." This is the key to the dilemma over anthropomorphism and to the question posed in section II whether Seinlassen or Gehörenlassen mark off man's belonging to the fourfold from the way in which nonhuman beings belong. It would seem that the answer to this question must be negative, since in the essay on the Anaximander fragment, Heidegger attributes not only abiding but also letting belong to every kind of being. This follows immediately from his statement there that beings which abide let one another belong (H 331, EGT 46). However, he writes a few para graphs later that whatever lingers awhile comes to presence "in each case in accordance with its while," Je und Je ihrer Weile. So the letting belong will be a letting belong which is peculiar to each different being and kind of being. If we remember this, the answer to our question as to the differentiating powers of letting be and letting belong will be affirmative, assuming, as seems reasonable, that letting belong is a way of letting be. But perhaps we ought not to assume that Gelassenheit is the family name for the various formations of lassen to which Heidegger resorts. In our quotation of one exchange in the "Conversation on a Country Path," we followed the published translation which has one speaker saying that the name for the regioning in relation to (of) things cannot be Vergegnis, "regioning with respect to man," human regioning. Although this phrase is the translators' interpretation of Vergegnis and not a translation of words explicit in the text, the text does go on to say that Vergegnis is a relation of regioning to Gelassenheit, and Gelassenheit involves thinking; therefore, neither Gelassenheit nor Vergegnis can be the name for regioning of or "with respect to" things that do not think. Here Ding is not being given the Eckhartian scope it is given in "The Thing," where it is used also of beings that think. But the "Conversa tion," written five years before "The Thing," and the address commemorat ing the birth of the composer Conradin Kreutzer, written five years after, supplement the account which is given in "The Thing" of the belonging</page><page sequence="16">18 JOHN LLEWELYN together of the regions of the fourfold with a name for what is distinctive of the letting belong of mortals. Gelassenheit is also the name for what is distinctive of human responsibility. Just as the genitive of the letting belong of mortals is ambiguously subjective and objective, "speculative," so is the genitive of the responsibility of mortals. It is a responsibility that they exercize. But it is at the same time a responsibility that exercizes them. This is why it is first and last ontological responsibility. Heidegger asks at one point in "The Anaximander Frag ment," "But to whom does whatever is present let the order of jointure belong?"—" Wem aber lassen die Anwesenden den Fug der Fuge gehören?" (H 333, EGT 48). The dative wem is the dative of what is present, beings, but at the same time the dative of presencing, being. It is to mortals that es gibt Sein. And it is therefore to mortals that is given the responsibility to give being to nonmortal beings. If, as Hölderlin says, the poet is the mediator between gods and men, this is only because the poet is a mortal whose responsibility it is to mediate being to non-mortal beings, and because a mortal, like Dos toevsky's monk Markel, can sin not only against the gods, but against "birds, trees, meadows, sky." "Sin" is a word that Heidegger would be reluctant to use without inverted commas and other precautions in the context of ontological thinking. But Levinas would be no less reluctant to use it unreservedly in his philosophy of ethics, notwithstanding his willingness to equate the ethical with the reli gious, in the sense in which the religious is that by which—or by whom—we are obliged. He would never agree, of course, that ethics is contained within Heideggerian ontology. But what does Heidegger mean by the ontological when in the "Conversation" he has the scholar say: "the relation between that which regions and Gelassenheit, if it can still be considered a relation, can be thought of neither as ontic nor as ontological . . ."? Is this not inconsistent with our assertion that Gelassenheit is what is distinctive of ontological responsibility? No, it is not, for at the stage in the conversation at which these words occur, "ontic" is being employed for a relation such as the relation of cause and effect with which a scientist might be occupied, and "ontological" is being employed for the transcendental-horizonal relation that occupies Husserl in his phenomenology of representation. It is just from this that Gelassenheit, releasement, is a releasement. It is a releasement to ontology in the liberated sense it has when, for the reasons given above, we speak of ontological responsibility despite the qualms Heidegger comes to have over using the word except of a style of thinking he no longer wishes to pursue. No one is more alert than Heidegger himself to the difficulty of his later style of thinking, in particular the difficulty of thinking es gibt Sein without slipping back into representing being as an ontotheological principle and ground. This is not simply a technical difficulty to be overcome by taking</page><page sequence="17">ONTOLOGICA I. RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 19 extra pains. It is an ontologicai error in that being itself conceals itself in revealing itself as a being. Men will forget, but at least with the help of the denkende Dichter and the dichtende Denker, they may come to remember that they are ontologically predisposed to become oblivious to their responsibility toward being and the responsibility toward beings, human and nonhuman, that that entails. When phenomenology or philosophy in general forgets that there is more than objects represented, willed, or desired by subjects, it represents itself as ontotheology. It forgets responsibility. That it is irresponsible to construe responsibility ontotheologically is one thing on which it is certain that Heidegger and Levinas agree. This is one reason why they could both be described as humanists. Levinas's humanism is more thoroughly humanistic than Heidegger's in that it allows direct ethical responsibility only from and to a human being, whereas on our reading of Heidegger his humanism leaves room for direct ethical responsibility to nonhuman beings as well. Allows room, we say, because Heidegger insists that the thinking of being must not be mistaken for ethics. It is because of this insistence that care must be taken to anticipate a mistaken inference from the statement that his thinking of being is a humanism. If Heidegger insists that he is not aiming to develop a theory of ethics, he insists no less that he is not developing a case for religious agnosticism or atheism, so in the sense in which humanism is one of these, his thinking is not humanistic. When he writes of the gods as participants in the fourfold he is writing of a region of thinking shared by theology and atheology, irrespective of whether there is a god who can be present in or absent from his temple, synagogue, mosque, or church. His ontology can be called a humanism only if this is kept in mind and if we take seriously its claim to remain uncommitted to any specific theory of ethics. That is its power and that is why we are taking seriously its power to clear space, even if it does not itself occupy that space, for an ethics of direct responsibility toward nonhuman as well as human beings. With the support, as he sees it, of Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Hölder lin, Heidegger comes to think that Parmenides' Fragment 6 entitles us to say that although things do not appear by human making, they do not appear without human vigilance (VA II 54, PLT 181). That.is, if the movement of Heidegger's reflection is "through phenomenology to thought," it is "through" in the sense that phenomenology is not left behind.4 Thought remains a thought of appearing—and disappearing. Now the part human beings play in the appearing of the fourfold is twofold because it is reflexive in that its being is an issue for the human being. Its being is ontologicai, because being toward death, it is being toward there being nothing and no thing, hence being toward being. And just as we must take steps to prevent ourselves from thinking of being as a being, so we must take care not to</page><page sequence="18">20 JOHN LLEWELYN represent the fourfold as an aggregate of objects. One of the steps Heidegger takes early on to guard against the first error is to emphasize that Sein is a participle, not a simple noun. One of the steps he takes later on to minimize the risk of erring in the second way is to stress that the fourfold is a fouring, the Geviert a Vierung and Vieren (VA II 53, PLT 180). Vierung is the Vorbeigang which the Verweilung of the beings that make up the fourfold makes manifest provided one of those beings, the human being, is in a mood to let beings be and belong to one another. This human letting belong means, we have seen, letting each participant in the fourfold belong in its own way according to its own way of being, fügsam seinem Wesen (VA II 55, PLT 182). This means that the Verweilung of non-human beings is not to be assimilated to that of human beings. Gelassenheit prohibits anthropomorphism. It requires that no beings be treated only as objects requisitioned in order to calculate and as far as possible totalize the satisfaction of human need and greed. A bridge may serve as an example for our reflections. . . . Even where the bridge covers the stream, it holds its flow up to the sky by taking it under the vaulted gateway and then setting it free once more. . . . The bridge lets the stream run its course and at the same time grants their way to mortals so that they come and go from shore to shore. . . . The bridge gathers to itself in its own way earth and sky, divinities and mortals. (VA II 26-27, PLT 152-153) There is also a lesson to be learned from the rose of Angelus Silesius, whose words Heidegger cites in Der Satz vom Grund: The rose is without why; it blooms because it blooms; It is regardless of its self, asks not if it is seen. It is not true that if the desert rose is born to blush unseen, it wastes its sweetness on the desert air. Vierung is coming to be and passing away in good time with respect to the regioning of four-dimensional space. In the words of another preacher poet: To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance. . . .5 The poet who has been mainly in question in this essay is the poet of mourning and morning who writes in the elegy Brod und Wein:</page><page sequence="19">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF NATURE 21 One thing stands firm: whether it be near noon Or close to midnight, a measure ever endures, Common to all; yet to each his own is allotted, too, Each of us goes toward and reaches the place that he can. (H 251, PLT 95) And when the thinker who has been mainly in question in this essay says that the thinking that must be given to the pas de quatre of mortals, immortals, earth, and sky is responsible remembrance, Andenken, he is responsibly remembering the title of the hymn by that poet on which he dwells in one of the essays published in the Erläuterungen zu Hölderlins Dichtung and in the lectures published in the Gesamtausgabe as volume 53. A topic of this and other works of Hölderlin is the coming and going of the gods and the absencing of past and future inherent in the presencing of things: Abschied and Adieu or, as Levinas writes, A Dieu. Our discussion has scarcely touched on this question of historicity and the way it connects with the special responsibility Hölderlin and Heidegger ascribe to the poet of mediating between the divinities and men, thereby running the risk of sacrilege, a risk of which, it deserves to be said, Hölderlin is no less afraid than Levinas, if by sacrilege is understood a failure to observe a proper distance from the holy (G 4,62, 104). So afraid of this is Hölderlin that according to Beda Allemann there is only one piece of textual support in the late works of Hölderlin for the idea that he sees the poet as a demigod acting as mediator like Empedocles or Christ.6 And is it not important for our interpretation of Hölderlin Heidegger to play down this widely held idea, for if the poets are entrusted with the task of mediating between the divinities and men, does it not follow that there will be no responsibilities left for ordinary mortals? This does not follow because, first, there are other responsibilities than this special one ascribed to the poet, some of them, we have been arguing, responsibilities to beings of the nonhuman regions of the fourfold. Second, those mortals whose special responsibility it is to name the holy need the response of ordinary mortals, their hearers and readers, for the preservation of their words, as Heidegger acknowledges when in "The Origin of the Work of Art" he writes "the preservers of a work belong to its createdness with an essentiality equal to that of the creators" (H 58, PLT 71) and as Hölderlin acknowledges in the final paragraph of the letter he sent probably in November 1802 where he asks Böhlendorff to write soon because "I need your pure accents. Communion with friends, germination of thought in conversation and letter is necessary for artists." As Celan notes, winning Levinas's agreement, a poem can be a handshake. And there is agreement between Hölderlin and Heidegger and Levinas and Celan that ordinary mortals are extraordinary, even if there is not general agreement among them on the reasons for saying this. One reason on which at least Heidegger and Hölderlin agree is that the so-called ordinary mortal who hears the</page><page sequence="20">22 JOHN LLEWELYN poet's words must himself be a poet in his way. The ordinary mortal shares with the poet who is "struck by Apollo" and whose "eye too many" is dazzled by the fire of the sky (G 4, 189-190) the responsibility of loyally remembering the extraordinariness of ordinary beings, whether they be human beings or not: "the jug and the bench, the footbridge and the plough . . . tree and pond too, brook and hill . . . heron and roe, deer, horse and bull. . . mirror and clasp, book and picture, crown and cross" (VA II 55, PLT 182), where the book may be the Book or may not, its word the word of the prophet or the word of the poet, where the cross may be the cross of the Word, of the Trinity, or may not, because the cross of the word, the Quaternity, and the burden of ontological responsibility it carries with it, are prior to theistic and atheistic faith as well as to rational ontotheology and ontoatheology. VI If ontological responsibility is also prior to ethics it may seem that the burden it brings is vanishingly light. It may strike the reader of the hundreds of pages in which Heidegger meditates on Hölderlin and the early Greeks that there emerges and could be expected to emerge from them no directive whatsoever as to what their readers should do other than, so to speak, wait upon grace. When asked by the young student Büchner with what authority the author of these pages says what he says in them, Heidegger responds with another question: Where do Plato and Kant get theirs? "It never occurs to anyone to ask whence Plato had a directive to think of being as idea, or whence Kant had the directive to think of being as the transcendental character of objectness, as position (being posited)" (VA II 58, PLT 185). This response, although it may sound slightly arrogant, is in fact a sign of humility. Thinking of the thing is "a thinking that thinks about the possible advent of the world, and keeping it thus in mind (andenkend) perhaps helps, in the humblest and inconspicuous matters, such an advent to reach the opened-up realm of man's nature as man." Humility, however, is not passivity, any more than is the waiting on grace that in both senses calls for religious faith, paradoxically presupposing what it pursues, seeking what it must already have found. It is not the advent of an object upon which poetic thinking waits. By now we have heard Heidegger say often enough that poetic thinking is not (p)re-presentation, Vorstellen. And by now it should be clear that the waiting for which poetic thinking calls is rooted in our belonging in that upon which we wait, and it is from this that it receives its movement (Bewegung) toward it (Gel 51-52, DT 73-74). The "higher doing" (Gel 35, DT 61) that poetic thinking calls for is neither activity nor passivity. It is less like the derivation of conclusions from authorized premis</page><page sequence="21">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 23 ses than criticism if this critical testing is taken to be, not, as in Popperian criticism,7 the application of a method, but rather the following of contours in the opening up of a way, where the opening up of a way is what Heidegger would call Be-wegen and perhaps even Tao (US 198, OWL 92) and where the contours are a changeable configuration of the Vieren of the history of being. To think the thing is to think being, and "To think 'being' means: to respond to the appeal of its presencing (dem Anspruch seines Wesens entsprechen). The response stems from the appeal and releases itself (entlässt sich) toward the appeal" (VA II 56, PLT 183). The response must be historical in that it must be tested by listening with one ear to words that have been spoken, for example by the early Greeks, and with the other for words that are on the way. The response will not be an answer, but another question, for "the essence of man is never an answer but essentially a question" (EM 107, IM 118). Hence ontological responsibility is an Antworllichkeit ohne Antwort. That is what marks it off from ethical responsibility that believes it knows the answer, and from calculative thinking that believes it can prove which answer is right. Because the Prüfung des Gehörs to which ontological responsi bility must be open calls for "the complete concentration of care and caution toward being that has already come to language," already come to language, it calls for the commemoratively thinking poet and the commemoratively poetic thinker respectively to name the holy and to say the words for being. We have been saying something about one of those words, to chredn, of which Heidegger writes that it is the oldest name for the being of beings. Since we began this essay by describing our question as a question of doing justice, what is due, to beings, let us end it by returning to one of the other words in the fragment from Anaximander. Dike, the fügsam, as this emerges from Heidegger's intertextual reading of Hölderlin with Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, must not be identified with the fitting as this is conceived in theological, rationalist, nationalist, or naturalist theories of ethics. To do that would be to conceive Gesetz as Gestell. It would be to fail to recognize that ethical, theological, and religious criteria and standards of propriety are appealed to responsibly only when understood as expressions of the precriteriological authenticity and propriety mentioned in the statement part of which was cited above: "If authentic rcleasement is to be the proper (gemässe) relation to that which regions, and if this relation is determined solely by what it is related to, then authentic releasement must be based upon that which regions, and must have received from it movement toward it." Gelassenheit is guardianship, Wächterschaft', and guardianship is vigilance, Wachsamkeit, motivated by what in Being and Time is named Gewissenhabenwollen, wanting to have a conscience, an ontological conscientiousness which is prior to and unfixated by principles: Entschlossenheit, the authentic opening of man for the open (Gel 61, DT 81).</page><page sequence="22">24 JOHN LLEWELYN Hermeneu tically intermediate between his earliest unarticulated thinking of being and his later Hölderlinian topography of the fourfold are Heideg ger's explorations of the dyad of earth and world in "The Origin of the Work of Art" and his reflections on early Greek thinking of dike as the order of worldhood as such which is in tension with and against the propensity for disorder that erupts in the world when man, who in the words of the chorus of Antigone "comes toward nothingness" (G 53, 92), suddenly finds himself struck by the strange thought that there is a world and there are things. World and things as such are sung into existence, it might be said, as Arkady does say in Bruce Chatwin's The Songlines of the Australian aboriginal world. "Sometimes," said Arkady, "I'll be driving my 'old man' through the desert, and we'll come to a ridge of sandhills, and suddenly they'll all start singing. 'What are you mob singing?' I'll ask, and they'll say, 'Singing up the country, boss. Makes the country come up quicker.'"8 World comes up quicker when it is sung. The waxing and waning of the world as a whole is the unsaid. It is also in Wittgenstein's strict sense unsayable. In Heidegger's strict sense it calls for the aboriginal Sage for which the poet has an ear, "the music of the spirit of apartness that has been spoken to the poet" (US 70, OWL 188). The measure of the music, its nomos, is dike, the tempo of the music of time, the measureless measure of four-dimensional regioning, the "principle" of all principles. Dike in Heidegger's thinking of the Greeks corresponds in Hölderlin's thinking of them to what Allemann names the royal principle. This is the principle of organization and Ortschaft, the principle of return to hearth and home. Dike is in tension with the violence of techne. Techne corresponds to what Allemann names the Empedoclean princi ple. This is the aorgic principle, the principle of Wanderschaft, the principle of departure and of exile, nomadism or walkabout. Hölderlin's departure and return become, on Heidegger's reading of him, a journey to the unheimisch and a return home which together enable him "to know the place for the first time," to know that the unheimisch is the home, the ungewöhnlich the Wohnung, and that being is the hearth, the human habitation to which the man of science, the man of learning and the teacher come back at the end of their conversation on the country path, where the teacher says "perhaps we can express our experience during this conversation by saying that we are coming near to and so at the same time remaining distant from that which regions; although such remaining is, to be sure, a returning" (Gel 67-68, DT 86). What Hölderlin's experience and the ebbing flow of the river Ister teach is that Ortschaft is Wanderschaft-, the royal principle and the Empedoclean principle are the same. When at the end of the hymn Andenken Hölderlin writes: ι But memory Is taken and given by the sea,</page><page sequence="23">ONTOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE POETICS OF Ν A TÜRE 25 he "names the law of being away from home as the law of homecoming," though this law, Heidegger adds, reaching a point of almost absolute proximity to Hegel, is but an empty rule unless we also name the essential trait in which the history of a historical people resides (G 53, 166, cp 156 and 177). Heraclitus says in Fragment 80 that we must remember that the law of being is a law of laws, a Gesetz of the way order, dike, nomos, belongs to setting apart,polemos, Auseinandersetzung (EM 127, IM 139). This Auseinandersetzung is then a Gegensetzung in which the^en is not only an against but also a toward. This law of being or nature, phusis, is the law of the historical fourfold of mortals, divinities, earth, and sky, that is named when the unsettling techne of the poet in man and the orderliness of dike, both spoken of in the last strophe of the choric song from Antigone, respond to each other in what Hölderlin calls the harmonious Gegensetzung of what Heidegger calls the regioning, Vergegnis, of the fourfold. We have called this law of being or nature the law of ontological responsibility or ontological justice in order to bring to mind the question whether my responsibility toward the next man which Levinas counts to be primary justice and a condition of ethical justice where three persons are gathered together, has as its condition in turn justice among the human and non-human members of the quaternity. Although there is no question of deducing particular ethical responsibilities from this ontological justice, it makes room for the direct responsibilities toward human beings which Levinas holds to be the only direct ethical responsibilities we have, but for direct responsibilities toward nonhuman beings as well, toward birds, trees, meadows, sky . . .
