<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guide to the Year's Work in Victorian Poetry: 1976 Note. The editor of Victorian Poetry welcomes among the contributors to the 'Tear's Work " Evelyn Barish (on Arthur Hugh Clough) and Allan R. Life (on the Pre-Raphaelites) and wishes to thank John P. Farrell (on Matthew Arnold), who after this year is passing on the burden of this survey to other hands. These annual reports are intended to serve as continuing supplements to Frederic E. Faverty's The Victorian Poets: A Guide to Research (1968). Copies of the special Victorian Poetry supplement Guide to the Year's Work in Victorian Poetry and Prose (1974) are still available. The contributor's choice or a dearth ofreportable materials accounts for the absence of reports on certain authors in the "Year's Work" for any given year. Materials for next year's guide (books for review and offprints) should be sent directly to the Editor, Victorian Poetry, 129 Armstrong Hall, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506. General Materials Richard Tobias Patricia M. Ball's The Heart's Events: The Victorian Poetry of Relationships is her third book seeking to establish an essential pattern of nineteenth-century art. The three books- actually one large book, The Central Self, The Science of Aspects, and this one- show that we read to see how a personal event or a sight affects and changes the person seeing. How did Hallam's death create Tennyson's soul? In this book, she starts with Wordsworth's Lucy poems and Byron's 1816 poems to Lady Byron and his sister Augusta to show how loss and separation upset, disturb, confound, and create the poetic intelligence. Her book ends with an exegesis of Clough's Bothie and Patmore's Angel in the House', these two poems reverse the pattern to show that establishing a relationship serves to define the self just as much as destruction of a relation- ship defines the self in Arnold's Marguerite poems, Clough's Amours, Tennyson's In Memoriam and Maud, Meredith's Modern Love, and Brown- ing's "James Lee's Wife." 241</page><page sequence="2">242 / VICTORIAN POETRY She quotes Clough's 1853 demand that poets treat more with the "general wants, ordinary feelings," and she shows that the poetry, without being novelistic, did incorporate the ordinary. Thus Arnold's condemnation in 1853 was in fact the success of the poetry: the Victorians wrote about "real houses" but not with the architectonice that Arnold wanted. Since her study climaxes in two poems, the Bothie and Angel, that few modern readers can sustain interest in, Ball seems bent on proving Arnold's point by reversal. She provides entrance into the real psychic history of the period 1830-60 so that we can understand how Bothie and Angel so fully represent and enact their period. Her book asks us to read these poems as if we were Victorian readers. The writing is clear, but her previous two books stimulated me more. Possibly I am becoming too familiar with her method. The analysis of Maud and "James Lee's Wife" concentrates so fiercely on the poems that I lost the central perception of the book. Like Harold Bloom, she wants to chart a new and striking line in the century, but she lacks Bloom's surface excitement and audacity. The poems fascinate her more than the idea. She does redirect her reader in an essential way; most critics try to make the poems work in our new experience, but she tries to take us as readers back into the original experience. She demands more of her readers, and we should be grateful to her for what she asks us to do. From the plangent simplicity of the title to the end of the two thousand pages, the two-volume Victorian Literature edited by Donald Gray and Georg B. Tennyson is both a monument and a garland. It will be the anthology for the rest of the century, and since it may well be the last big anthology to be made, Gray and Tennyson work seriously and permanently. Gray is respon- sible for Victorian Literature: Poetry and Tennyson for Victorian Literature: Prose. Their anthology is neither revolutionary nor revisionist; it is solid. Tennyson's preface justifies the prose for both its content and its artistry. Gray defines his selection as the "idea of poetry . . . enacted in the lyric." Gray notices the narrative tradition outside his anthology, and he includes what samples he can, but fundamentally he prints the short, intense, lyric poem. Both editors make proper obeisance to Victorian modification and adaptation of the lambent romantic flame. Like other monuments and gar- lands, the volumes make their reader sad. What high hopes failed to become reality; how brief the moment seems in retrospect; how thorough and complete Victorianism was; how much more it was in fact than such volumes can show; how over and gone it all is. The age fits neatly (and ironically) between these imperial covers. We open such books first to make sure that our own admired leaf has been included. Gray does not print Hopkins' "Carrion Comfort"; Tennyson almost ignores William Morris (he has one page more than Charles Bradlaugh).</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD TOBIAS I 243 We should not argue about what they omit but test to see if any that they include could have been omitted. Gray prints over one hundred and fifty pages of Tennyson, every poem necessary. The ten pages for Aylmer's Field are proper since the poem seems so quintessentially Tennyson and so quintessentially Victorian. Gray could not print Enoch Arden or any of the other rural idylls, but this poem communicates their charm without their gaucheries. The poem varies Tennyson's theme of the marriage of true minds blunted by foul pride and wealth. Who else but Tennyson in 1864 could write a sermon in blank verse to climax a narrative poem Tennyson fully entraps his female character; he lards his verse with tradition and talent until the head swims; he seems compulsive to connect sex and revolution. The poem has to be included. Gray also prints both 1832 and 1842 texts of "The Lady of Shalott" and "Oenone." He refuses to print any of The Ring and the Book on the excellent grounds that the poem makes sense only as a total experience, but he does print twenty -seven pages of Browning poems written after 1 867. For Arnold he prints all of Empedocles and Sohrab. As someone said in another context, there is God's plenty. Use the mimeograph for the odd bloom still needed. The second question for an anthology is "Are the texts accurate?" Both editors emphasize that they print from the last text supervised by the author; they acknowledge only three or four modern copyrighted texts, but they have clearly listened to and attended to textual discussions. Gray cites Ricks's Tennyson and the Arnold editors in his notes. Thus Gray faithfully repeats the obvious error at line forty-nine of Aylmer's Field (it should be a comma, not a period), which is in the Eversley Tennyson but which Ricks corrects. In his selection from Pauline, Gray has two better readings than the Ohio Browning (he calls it a "variorum") because he follows the 1888-89 text. Gray might have given the original line numbers in his text of Pauline so that anthology readers could tell where the selection occurs in the poem. I sense that Gray and his publisher have taken great care to insure accuracy; the anthology is as sound in its texts as it is in its selections. Gray divides his poets into ten sections. First he sets out the "Principal" poets for each generation: 1830-50, 1850-80, and 1880-1900. Following each of these sections, he has sections simply called "Early Victorian Poets," "Mid," and "Late." Poets in the "Principal" category such as William Barnes, Coventry Patmore," and Robert Bridges- along with the more familiar names- receive full introduction, chronology, and book lists with editions, biographies, and "Useful Books," but the others have only italicized intro- ductions and rudimentary citations to studies. Following these six sections, Gray has four more sections: (7) Comic Poems, (8) Songs, (9) Religious Poems and Hymns, and (10) Victorian Poetics. The Poetics section is brief but useful, and it complements material printed in the Prose volume. Gray's</page><page sequence="4">244/ VICTORIAN POETRY aim is to "enlarge the usual idea of Victorian Literature" in these sections, and he succeeds very well. The comic poems are especially fine to have, but one also appreciates the twenty-seven pages of street ballads, broadsides, stage songs, parlor songs, and political songs. Some hymns prove unexpectedly familiar and unexpectedly good as poems. Gray is "cool" rather than "hot" in the apparatus that he provides to help his reader. His lists of "Useful Books" are genuinely selections. At the back, he prints a succinct and brief four-page "General Bibliography." The introductory essays are brief, pointed, and critical; the essay on Browning, for example, is very well done. He is curiously reticent about illness and deaths, but his critical tact is sound. Compare his essay on Hopkins with Harold Bloom's essay in the Oxford Anthology, both connect Hopkins to the Romantics and deny Modernist adulation, but Gray's good sense and moderation are more persuasive and true. His explanatory footnotes are succinct and useful. Even on "The Wreck of the Deutschland" Gray supplies readings rather than quarrels. One final word: anthologies create the futures of poets by giving them readers. John Clare, Thomas Hood, Emily Bronte, and William Barnes get more attention here than they have in the past. Clough, Patmore, and Bridges become principal poets. Meredith does very well with the full text of Modern Love and two texts for "Love in the Valley." Rossetti, Swinburne, and Hopkins hold steady. The Kipling selection is generous; Gray limits Yeats, Housman, and Hardy to nineteenth-century poems. Wilde gets short shrift, but Wilfred [sic] Scawen Blunt has six poems. The Tennyson Prose demands comparison to the magisterial anthology prepared in the 1930's by Charles Frederick Harrold and William D. Templeman. Although Tennyson's page is slightly larger, the older anthology (I would guess) is about thirty percent larger; the older anthology has supplementary texts from Marx, Darwin, and Spencer, and it has Harrold's eighty-page "Introductory Survey." Tennyson wisely restrains himself to a "Preface" on essentials. Tennyson includes writers that Harrold and Templeman ignored: Jane Welsh Carlyle, Harriet Martineau, Disraeli, Maurice, Gladstone, Mayhew, Pugin, Smiles, Victoria, George Eliot, George Meredith, John Morley, and Oscar Wilde. The older anthology allocated 200 pages each to the big figures; in the new one, Carlyle gets 207, but Newman 170, Arnold 160, Ruskin 144, and Mill 117. Macaulay is down to less than thirty pages. Tennyson prints James Anthony Froude's "Words About Oxford," which contrasts nicely to Arnold's "Preface" to Culture and Anarchy, the one part of Arnold's book not printed. Tennyson prints five pages from Richard Hurrell Froude's Remains to give us some idea of what the fuss was about. How unpleasant to meet Mr. Froude! How pleasant to contrast Newman's noble prose to Froude's mawkish prose.</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD TOBIAS / 245 Tennyson prints his selection by birthdate of author, but within that order he does distinguish between his major and minor figures; for major writers, resource material is listed alphabetically, but for lesser lights, the material is listed by chronology. Like Gray, he rigorously and properly selects his bibliographical citations, but an eyebrow goes up that he omits E. P. Thompson's 1955 book on Morris. Also, the reader could use a "General Bibliography" like the one in Gray's book, especially to list those treatments of Victorian artistry that Tennyson's preface mentions. He lists Holloway's Victorian Sage under Arnold; I can't find the Levine and Madden Art of Victorian Prose; his Preface does mention the David De Laura Victorian Prose: A Guide to Research and individual listings cite it. One could use more help to critical judgment. Tennyson's introductory essays are clear, interesting, and stimulating (except for a tendency to announce at the end that the subject died in the same year given after his name). The Carlyle essay is masterful. The notes are light and informational. He, like Gray, respects his reader. He gives his space to Victorian prose and not to prosing about it. They are handsome books. They may, in fact, be the last events of the Victorian period. I cannot imagine that such an imperial, majestic, magiste- rial, consensual anthology will be made again. The paper is good; the binding excellent. The Tennyson volume has sixteen pages of excellent black and white illustrations, all contemporary to the period. The volumes have been prepared, in short, to last as monuments and to give long service. They deserve to be owned by serious students who have the same commitment that Gray and Tennyson have. A more modest anthology- probably designed for students in the social sciences- is The Victorian Sages, edited by Alan W. Bellringer and C. B. Jones. It is organized by seven topics: prophecy, Whig history, fiction, sociology, religion, evolution, and art and society. A final section, headed "Matthew Arnold," prints the first and third chapters of Culture and Anarchy. The editors extract from texts in order to provide basic thoughts of the high Victorian period. The editors are not interested- as the title might suggest- in the art of prose, but in the connection between art and society. It is a useful collection, harmful only if a reader assumes it represents a full picture of the period.</page><page sequence="6">246 / VICTORIAN POETRY Matthew Arnold John P. Farrell Only one book on Arnold appeared this year, A. L. Rowse's Matthew Arnold: Poet and Prophet. It has no scholarly or critical significance. As one might expect, it stresses and sentimentalizes Arnold's Cornish ancestry. The best thing about it is the remarkably good quality of its illustrations. A number of interesting articles have appeared. Among these "Arnold's Empedocles on Etna and the 1853 Preface" (VP 14: 311-324) by Manfred Dietrich seems at first glance potentially the most significant. Dietrich promises to take us beyond Coulling (and, implicitly, others) in working out the complex relationship between the poem and the Preface that rejects it. However, Dietrich really covers mainly familiar ground. Indeed, he even loses some ground on the larger issues in spite of making good use of intimations in Arnold's earlier letters and poems which would suggest why he wrote the Preface. More tantalizing is his attempt to demonstrate the deliberate inaccuracy of Arnold's report that he withdrew the poem when fewer than fifty copies were sold. Dietrich is very possibly right. Unfortunately his case rests on shrewd guesses rather than convincing evidence. His hypothesis might be borne out in other ways, perhaps by the deductions one might reasonably make on the basis of a census of known copies. It would be extremely illuminating to know if Empedocles had a much wider circulation in 1852-53 than we have traditionally believed. Several essays published in the last two years document various influences on Arnold's work. Barbara T. Gates, "Arnold's Empedocles and the Book of Common Prayer" (Renascence 28: 215-222), follows up a suggestion originally made by Kenneth Allott. Jerold J. Savory, "Matthew Arnold and 'The Author of Supernatural Religion': The Background to God and the Bible" (SEL 16: 677-691), shows that Walter R. Cassels' anonymously published book had a direct influence on Arnold's decision to expand his reply to the critics of Literature and Dogma into a book. Arnold used Cassels as he had previously used Colenso: to define the limits of rationalistic analysis. Martin Jarrett-Kerr, "Arnold versus the Orient" (CLS 12 [1975] : 129-146), is a fairly routine study of Arnold's passing enthusiasm for Eastern thought. Jarrett-Kerr's familiarity with the sources of Arnold's ideas, especially as they were derived second-hand from Victor Cousin, gives the essay scholarly weight. The best of these articles is Ellen S. Gahtan's " 'Nor help for pain': Matthew Arnold and Sophocles' Philoctetes" (VN 48 [1975] : 21-26), which makes a persuasive case for the Philoctetes as the main inspira- tion behind Arnold's crucial allusion to Sophocles in "Dover Beach." Although the key lines were cited in the Tinker and Lowry Commentary,</page><page sequence="7">JOHN P. FARRELL / 247 Gahtan draws interesting connections between the general myth and the kind of poetry Arnold wrote. Very little of what we usually mean by straight criticism of the poetry has recently appeared. Frank Giordano has written a subtle analysis of "Rhythm and Rhyme in 'Self-Dependence' " (ELN 13 [1975] : 29-35). Of wider scope is Ronald E. Becht's "Matthew Arnold's 'Switzerland': The Drama of Choice" (VP 13 [1975] : 35-45), a fresh and appealing analysis of the way Arnold finally organized the Switzerland lyrics. Becht sees this organization as dialectical rather than narrative. The poems are preoccupied with an effort to circumvent, by self-conscious acts of will, the bitter know- ledge of experience learned by the poet before his meeting with Marguerite. These acts fail. The speaker learns what he already knew. Though Becht identifies disengagement as the stage toward which the poems develop, his readings point more in the direction of poems on the theme of eternal recur- rence. They might even be said to be Nietzschean in their analysis of experi- ence, except that they utterly lack Nietzsche's ecstasy in the model of recur- rence and give themselves entirely to the very anxiety that Nietzsche down- played-but certainly recognized- as an emotionally appropriate response to the sense of recurrence. Francine B. Malder does not use Nietzsche in "Matthew Arnold and the Circle of Recurrence" (VP 14: 293-309). Nevertheless, her essay, which in many ways derives from Murray Krieger's well-known analysis of "Dover Beach," does propose that the early poetry treats history as a cycle in which Arnold sees himself as trapped. This situation is to be distinguished, according to Malder, from the linear or spiraling development of history imaged in Arnold's later work. Malder's approach is overly schematic but it does help to extend our understanding of Arnold's complex attitude toward the experi- ence of time. Malder suggests that we bypass Vico in reading the early poetry and, instead, keep in mind the pre-Socratics. She quotes Heracleitus from Arnold's Note-Books: "Immortal mortals, mortal immortals; one living the others' death and dying the others' life." She then stresses the relevance of the Greek historians to Arnold's view of history and notes that he shared their dismay at the endless flux in human affairs. In a separate essay, "Matthew Arnold and the Idea of Progress" (CentR 19 [1975]: 232-248), Malder reviews some of the elements that sometimes contributed to the pro- gressive view of history that Arnold sometimes held. George Forbes in "The Reluctant Lover and the World: Structure and Meaning in Arnold's 'Resignation' and 'Stanzas in Memory of the Author of "Obermann" ' " (SEL 16: 661-676) superficially treats the anthropomorphic strains in the two poems. Perhaps the most genuinely helpful essay of the year is Mary W. Schneider's "Arnold's Two Regions of Form" (VN 49: 22-24). Schneider's</page><page sequence="8">248 / VICTORIAN POETRY purpose is to show that Arnold's important letter of August 6, 1858 to his sister, Jane Forster, in which he describes a poetic "where form is every- thing," does not reflect his desire to escape from a more demanding kind of poetic which entails "an actual tearing of oneself to pieces." The region where form is everything is prose. What Schneider does for us is to decode a sort of shorthand Arnold was using. Her reading of the letter clarifies a good deal. Similar analyses of Arnold's notoriously elliptical letters to Clough would be very valuable. At the other extreme stands Stephen Prickett's half-chapter on Arnold in Romanticism and Religion: The Tradition of Coleridge and Wordsworth in the Victorian Church, which may be the year's most misguided analysis. The analysis is alluring, which is part of the trouble. Prickett is working with important materials, the relationship of theology and politics in the nineteenth century, but his discussion of Arnold finally obscures more than it clarifies. Prickett wants to demonstrate that Arnold rather haplessly muddled the premises of his religious criticism in such a way that he ended by reversing the very tradition upon which his criticism was founded: the Coleridge- Wordsworth-Keble tradition of intimate interplay between aesthetic and theological thought. At the core of this tradition is a valuation of poetry as a privileged form of knowledge. Arnold's religious criticism sets out to elevate the symbolic content of the Bible over dogmatic content. However, in trying to establish that the language of the Bible cannot be strictly mimetic, as the Higher Criticism demonstrated, Arnold, in effect, erects a barrier between poetry and truth. The result is that he actually undermines "poetry" and enhances dogma. To some extent Prickett's analysis is a companion to Vincent Buckley's discussion of Arnold in Poetry and Morality. Prickett is looking at what Arnold says about religion in order to see what he means about poetry in something of the way Buckley looks at Arnold's definition of poetry to see what he means about religion. Prickett, however, lacks Buckley's finesse. More egregiously, his analysis stems from the otiose dualism that he reads into Arnold's thought. This comes through most seriously in his failure to see that while Arnold did, indeed, conceive of a moral consciousness in man which poetry simply assisted, he also ascribed to poetry, in its perfected moments, a capacity to make a privileged record of reality. Joseph 0. Baylen has published some brief but intriguing Lingen letters that illustrate, indirectly, Arnold's tense relationship with Gladstone. The letters are incorporated in his "Matthew Arnold, R. R. W. Lingen and Gladstone: An Episode in the Career of Matthew Arnold (1883)" (EA 28 [1975]: 325-330). Articles such as Baylen's appear regularly in The Arnoldian, which is ably edited by Allan B. Lefcowitz and appears three times a year. Recent issues have contained a report on editing the "Yale</page><page sequence="9">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 249 Manuscript," letters from Arnold to Henry Montagu Butler, Cardinal Manning, and Millais. Brief papers read at the Arnold Seminar (MLA, 1976) are abstracted in the Fall, 1976 issue. Two essays by Thomas S. Snyder on Arnold and Ireland have also appeared in The Arnoldian, the latest in the Winter, 1977 issue. The same issue contains a further note on Arnold and Hutton by R. H. Tener, an analysis of "Dover Beach" by Roger P. Wallins, and David J. De Laura's illuminating commentary on a recently published reference to Arnold in Newman's letters, "Arnold, Newman, and T. S. Eliot: A Note on the Disappearance of God." Robert Browning Thomas J. Collins Two unfortunate books were published on Browning in 1976: Betty S. Flowers' Browning and the Modern Tradition is a serious but unsuccessful endeavor to meet the challenge issued in G. Robert Stange's 1954 essay "Browning and Modern Poetry" for a detailed study of Browning's "influ- ence" on modern poetry; Charles Leo Rivers' Robert Browning's Theory of the Poet, 1833-1841 is simply a reprint, but not acknowledged as such, of a pretentious series of monographs published by Rivers between 1961 and 1972 in The Northwest Missouri State College Studies series. Since I have already discussed the Flowers book in the latest issue of Studies in Browning and His Circle, it is sufficient to say here that the author conspicuously fails to delineate "influence," although her "Introduction" leads the reader to believe that this is her purpose, and that the book is seriously marred by manipulation of evidence and misinterpretation. The Rivers publication requires brief comment because it represents a practice, hopefully not wide- spread, which should be discouraged as silly and professionally dishonest. In 1958 Rivers completed his Ph.D. thesis on "Browning's Theory of the Poet." The monographs which followed, in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1970, and 1972, were drawn from that thesis, with no updating of materials to account for the development of bibliographical, biographical, or critical studies during the decade in which they appeared. With only slight changes of phrasing, all of the same materials have now appeared again in this reprint. In Chapter VII, "Conclusion," we are informed that "Browning's critics . . . have been far from clear in explaining the importance of his early work in his development as a poet" (p. 164). The same declaration appears in the 1961 monograph (p. 27) and, since there is no reference in the reprint to any secondary studies</page><page sequence="10">250/ VICTORIAN POETRY after 1956, one can only assume, with astonishment, that the author actually believes its validity. One cannot discount the possibility that an original and brilliant study might appear which ignores the development of scholarship, but this work is not a realization of that possibility. The larger issue involved here is, however, of more importance than this particular publication. Most university libraries, with the tacit agreement of departments they serve, and as a matter of convenience, receive publications such as this through a "standing order" arrangement with publishers or publishers' agents. My own library, for example, automatically accepts and processes at least three different series from Salzburgh Studies in English Literature, one of which includes the Rivers work. Through this ordering procedure, the profession therefore implicitly supports such publication. If the Rivers work is representative of the quality of the Salzburgh series, and recently published reviews of other items in it certainly indicate that this is the case, we should seriously reconsider our practice of library ordering, and our concomitant financial subvention of such series. Two items of biographical interest were published in 1976, both in Browning Institute Studies, My "Letters from Robert Browning to the Reverend J. D. Williams, 1874-1889" (4: 1-56) contains thirty-eight letters from Browning to the obscure clergyman who translated selected Browning poems into Latin, one suspects for his own amusement and Browning's delight, and who shared with Browning an interest in English and Classical poetry. An unusual feature of this small collection of Browning letters, which made the editing particularly enjoyable, is that both sides of the correspon- dence are extant. Ronald A. Bosco's "The Brownings and Mrs. Kinney: A Record of Their Friendship" (4: 57-124) is a thoroughly researched piece blending a good deal of previously unpublished material (most significantly letters from EBB and the "Journal" and "Personal Reminiscences" of Mrs. Kinney) with diverse items already published. This consolidation allows the author to trace the relationship between the Brownings and Mrs. Kinney in Florence, particularly as it developed between 1853 and 1856. The informa- tion presented is both personal and literary, with particular focus, in the latter area, on their mutual involvement with the American medium David Douglas Home. The past year cannot be considered one of outstanding critical achieve- ment in Browning studies; however, a number of essays have been published which deserve attention. The following remarks are not exhaustive; I have attempted, after reading the publications listed in the advance copy of the bibliography, to choose for discussion those which readers might find of interest and value.</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 251 Essays by Dorothy M. Mermin, "Speaker and Auditor in Browning's Dramatic Monologues" (UTQ 45: 138-157), and Ralph W. Rader, "The Dramatic Monologue and Related Lyric Forms" (CnY/3: 131-151) deal with the theory and practice of poetic form. Mermin argues that the conventional approaches to the monologues, as character studies or as enunciations of doctrine, do not enable us to answer the question of why the speaker engages in the act of speaking at all. On the premise that in most of the poetry before The Ring and the Book Browning is exploring the nature and significance of audible utterance, and through an investigation of the relationship between speaker and auditor, Mermin demonstrates three distinct phases of Browning's development of the focus of the monologue on the act of speech. In the poems of the early 1840's auditors are used to create situations in which significant speech is possible; in certain of the monologues in Men and Women to show how difficult it is to communicate one's deepest thoughts and feelings to another person; finally, in the casuistical monologues, includ- ing Blougram, to explore abuses of speech and show that persuasive utterance may be an inaccurate index of character and character a bad criterion for truth. Her evidence is convincing. Rader's essay, which is not limited to Browning, is the result, he explains, "of [his] long attempt to understand and resolve the conflicts between [the] persuasive and mutually exclusive conceptions" of Robert Langbaum and Elder Olson. While "Langbaum sees the matter of both kinds of poems [the dramatic lyric and the dramatic monologue] as essentially real, free of the constructive control of the poet," Olson, in contrast, "sees both kinds of figures as artistic constructs, created and controlled by the poet's art, whose shape and effect are single and determinate." Rader explains that these views "are not so much contradictory as complementary; these poems are most adequately seen as both determinate artistic constructs and as embodiments, in different senses, of real experience." "But," he continues, "to show that this is so will require the development of formal concepts more various, complex, and precise than these critics offer" (p. 133). I have quoted at length in this instance because paraphrase could easily distort or misrepresent an argument which is "complex," "precise," and also subtle. Readers will find that the author's development of the formal concepts which demonstrate his thesis is the result of serious consideration, genuine insight, and wide ranging knowledge. The essay is, in my opinion, the most significant theoretical work on the monologue in recent years. The remaining essays, most of which deal with individual works, will be discussed in the order dictated by the chronology of Browning's publications. I have not yet had the opportunity to read Clyde de L. Ryals' "Browning's Pauline: The Question of Genre" (Genre 9: 231-245), but the perplexing</page><page sequence="12">252 / VICTORIAN POETRY mixture of elements, autobiographical and dramatic, in that poem- and its anticipatory Spasmodic tendencies- invites analysis, and I look forward to perusing Ryals' attempt to resolve its generic polarities. "Browning, Eglamor, and Closure in Sordello" (SBHC 4, ii: 54-70), by Herbert F. Tucker, Jr., will probably not be of much interest to the general reader, but those who are fascinated by the Sordello enigma should find it rewarding. Tucker discusses lines 797-819 of Book VI of the poem, analyzing Browning's confrontation in these lines with Eglamor, Naddo, and the problem of poetic closure. With the summoning of Eglamor, the poet naively devoted to the formalist poetics of complete correspondence between fixed form and fixed meaning, Browning begins one of the least formalist passages of the poem: he interrupts the continuity of his own storytelling to contradict himself; he finds meaning not in obeying formal limits, but precisely in transgressing them. The result of this confrontation, in Tucker's view, is the discovery on Browning's part of writing an ending which eludes orthodox closure by embracing closure as its subject. And the meaning of such an ending, that meaning itself is endless, that no comprehensive cognitive statement will suffice, precisely because it would deny the possibility of fresh re-cognitions, is one of the central concerns not only of Sordello but of the Browning canon. One of the least appealing aspects of writing this annual review is the inevitable task of reading and evaluating yet more material published on Pippa Passes. Critical opinion on Pippa offers such a conflicting and contradictory set of variations that one is tempted to request a publication moratorium on the poem in order that readers can get on with the more fruitful and important task of engaging the work itself. But then an essay such as E. Warwick Slinn's " 'God a Tame Confederate': The Reader's Dual Vision in Pippa Passes" (UTQ 45: 158-173) appears, successfully overcoming these reservations because it stimulates its reader to return to the poem with newly informed vigor. Slinn contends that the structure of Pippa Passes emphasizes the multitudinousness of life, which is more the raw material for irony than for the theological optimism frequently associated with the poem. Through a detailed investigation of the varying degrees of ambiguity in the concluding actions of each scene, the further ambiguity inherent in the morality of each response to Pippa's songs, and the seriously questionable degree and nature of Pippa's influence, Slinn exposes the ironic nexus of the poem which provides us with its dual vision of melancholy innocence and knowing skepticism. In the process of establishing his case, Slinn clearly identifies the manner in which his reading modifies and extends the inter- pretations of other recent commentators. This is an impressive piece- a model of clarity and good sense.</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS J. COLLINS / 253 I am somewhat less enthusiastic about Addison C. Bross's "Easter-Day. Browning's Changing Concept of Faith" (VP 14: 11-23), not because I dis- agree with its findings, but because I am unconvinced that the view of the poem as the dramatization of an individual's attainment of faith through a conscious altering of his concept of its nature is as innovative as the author appears to think. Despite this qualification, the essay is worth reading because it clarifies the nature of the debate concerning faith which is at the core of the meaning of the poem, and it properly emphasizes the importance of the poem at a crucial stage of Browning's development. Brahma Chaudhuri's modest but suggestive essay, "Browning, Benjamin Jowett and English Higher Criticism" (SBHC4, ii: 1 19-132), is also concerned with Browning's beliefs, particularly in relation to the contrasting develop- ment of continental and English Higher Criticism. Commenting on Christmas-Eve, as well as poems horn Dramatis Personae, Chaudhuri proposes that, although Browning was opposed to the theories of Strauss and Renan, his views on Christian faith were strikingly similar to those expressed by the English Higher Critics, especially Jowett, who were denounced by the English public as the Septem contra Christum. Three essays deal with poems from Men and Women. John Maynard, in " 'Can't One Even Die in Peace?' Browning's 'A Serenade at the Villa' " (BSNotes 6, i: 3-10), reacts to the tendency of criticism to lump Browning's love poems together as exhibiting "typical" patterns, and he believes that "A Serenade" is a good, difficult, and interesting poem which has been neglected and, when discussed, misinterpreted. His skilful discussion of the structure and meaning of the poem validates his conclusion that Browning looks at love and the literary conventions of love poetry not as a special kind of honey- moon experience, but as a part of man's overall attempt to understand himself and his place in the universe. Browning criticism is not replete with studies which, with wry and grace- ful good humor, attempt to illustrate the ways in which individual works can be approached in the classroom, with the basic tools of analysis and interpre- tation, as examples of "how to read" a Browning poem, much less as examples of "how to read" a Victorian poem. Maurice B. Cramer's enter- taining and instructive " 'A Woman's Last Word': Paradise Lost or Paradise Retained?" (BSNotes 6, ii: 3-17) does; we should thank Cramer for his felicitous reminder that reading and writing about poetry can be fun. Cramer approaches this gemlike poem from so many angles that his article defies summary or paraphrase. I would only note that his view of the poetic speaker, which is at odds with that of most recent commentators, is utterly convincing.</page><page sequence="14">254/ VICTORIAN POETRY Bishop Blougram, Browning's crusty cleric, continues to stir critical interest. Robert G. Laird's " 'He did not Sit Five Minutes': The Conversion of Gigadibs" (UTQ 45: 295-313), attempts to correct some generally accepted misinterpretations of the poem by examining four problems in the work to which he believes no fully satisfactory solutions have been offered: the historical model for Gigadibs; the date of the composition of the poem; the setting of the poem and its importance ; and the reason Browning wrote the poem when he did. Laird presents new evidence to justify his view that Richard Hengist Home is the prototype for Gigadibs, that the poem was written in 1852-53, and that the post -dinner conversation occurs in the rectory of St. George's Cathedral, Southwark, on the feast of Corpus Christi. These findings, when coupled with Laird's belief that the composition of the poem was the result of the influence of certain of Ruskin's remarks in Volume One of Stones of Venice, serve as the basis for his illuminating reinterpretation of the meaning of the poem. Finally, Kay Austen's "The Royal Casanatense Document: A Third Source for Browning's The Ring and the Book" (SBHC 4, ii: 26-44), re- examines the possibility, first suggested by Hood, that the account of the murder of Pompilia Comparing discovered in the Royal Casanatense Library in 1900, was more important as a source for Browning in the composition of The Ring and the Book than has hitherto been realized. She satisfactorily demonstrates that parallels of fact and attitude between the poem and one of its likely sources are too numerous and too substantive to be merely, as C. W. Hodell and others have contended, matters of imagination or coincidence. Arthur Hugh Clough Evelyn Barish A handful of articles and a new edition of The Bothie constitute the new work on Clough for 1976. R. B. Rutland contributes "Some Notes on the Highland Setting of Clough's Bothie" (VP 14:125-133), giving the kind of details about social modes and class antagonisms (e.g., the competition among English visitors for authenticity in their assumed tartans) which make up a pleasant garnish for this most richly topical of all Clough's long poems. Patrick Scott has produced The Bothie: The Text of 1848 (Victorian Texts IV, Univ. of Queensland Press), following the format of his earlier edition of Amours De Voyage. His notes go over material similar to Rutland's, less discursively but more extensively. There are no real problems of vexed read-</page><page sequence="15">EVEL YN BARISH / 255 ings, since Clough himself oversaw the first printing and revised the poem for the 1862 edition, but Scott's work enables us clearly to see how closely Clough attended to nuances of language in The Bothie, despite the great speed of its composition, revising and improving almost every line of the fair copy to heighten subtlety and texture. The critical stance that emerges from Scott's non-textual notes is centrist: Clough's poetic technique is "novelistic"; Hewson, though known in the poem as "the Chartist," is Carlylean, not radical, in spite of Carlyle's opposition to Chartism. More seriously there seems to be confusion as to the fictive nature of the personae, and a good many words are spent on such considerations-part of an undying English game started by Clough's friends which treats the poem as a memoir- as whether it is Hewson or Adam who is more like Clough himself. However, the edition is a labor of love and a pleasant thing to have. Paul McGrane continues his work, singling out nine minor items over- looked by Mulhauser as recently as in the 1974 revised edition of tho Poems ("Unpublished Poetic Fragments and Manuscripts of Arthur Hugh Clough," VP 14: 359-364). Jerold Savory has enterprisingly visited the graveyard in Charleston, S. C, where Clough's brother George was buried and gives us the text of the twelve-line epitaph, which he attributes to both Clough and his elder brother, Charles ("An Epitaph Poem by Arthur Hugh Clough," VP 14: 264). Two minor letters from the '50's by Clough to R. M. Milnes have been discovered by Stephen Leach in Trinity College, Dublin (N&amp;Q 23: 57-59). The temptation to treat Clough topically will always allure us, for he repays it in a certain way. Yet what his oeuvre needs most for its long-term survival is first-rate criticism: let us hope that present and oncoming scholars will begin to look up and seek larger issues. Thomas Hardy Frank R. Giordano, Jr. The writing of books about Thomas Hardy seems to be a growth industry lately, according to Desmond Hawkins in the preface to his own new study. The blue chippers among last year's contributions are three very different kinds of books, written by established and dedicated Hardy scholars. F. B. Pinion, Hawkins, and Harold Orel are all thoroughly familiar with the most current and authoritative scholarship about Hardy's life; and each has worked for many years to make that knowledge the basis for responsible critical judgments about Hardy's poetic art.</page><page sequence="16">256/ VICTORIAN POETRY Pinion's A Commentary on the Poems of Thomas Hardy attempts "to provide as far as possible information and background which will assist in the interpretation of the poems." In its form and intention it resembles J. 0. Bailey's earlier handbook and commentary, to which it is much indebted. Pinion has had the advantages of reading most of Hardy's extant correspon- dence (still largely unpublished) and of consulting James Gibson's notes on Hardy's manuscripts (from the new Complete Poems of Thomas Hardy); his own research in preparing A Hardy Companion (1968), R. L. Purdy's invalu- able notes in his bibliographical study, and Bailey's findings contribute to the value of the book as a research source. Other attractive elements are the reproductions of some of Hardy's own drawings for Wessex Poems, the glossy plates, maps, and glossary of Wessex names. Pinion occasionally supplements his essentially factual study with critical comment. His sensitivity to Hardy's allusions and his care in identifying Hardy's borrowings from earlier poets reveal how deeply Hardy's poetry is rooted in literary tradition. There is some helpful explication of difficult verses (of which there are more than many readers realize); and Pinion some- times sheds new light on well-known poems, as when he demonstrates John Keble's influence upon "The Darkling Thrush." As always, Pinion is scrupulously wary of biographical readings which make unsubstantiated claims; his own commentary on the Tryphena poems rests on a basis of established fact. With Robert Gittings, Pinion may be consulted by anyone who wishes to know how far the Hardy-Tryphena relationship, described over a decade ago, may be credited. Instead of simply reprinting his earlier book on Hardy the novelist, Desmond Hawkins expanded it and sent it forth re titled Hardy: Novelist and Poet. Conceived as an introduction for the general reader, Hawkins' book aims "to bring within a critical and interpretative framework the whole of Hardy's formidable creation in prose and verse, and to associate with it as much biographical and historical material" as may be needed for a compre- hensive appraisal. A handsomely produced, reasonably priced ($10), grace- fully written study, Hawkins' book serves the needs of the common reader while it provides some fresh insights, new information, and worthwhile subjects for further research. Hawkins' sure grasp of Hardy's nature and his understanding of the operation of an artist's imagination (a novelist himself, Hawkins has dramatized Hardy's fiction for the B.B.C. radio and produced natural history programs for television) qualify him to assess Hardy's penchant for "falling in love" with a sense of balance and probity often lacking in previous studies. "In feminine company Hardy could often find in quite a slight incident a sufficient impulse to project the sort of fantasy from which a poem developed. When he needed to do so he could talk himself into a poetic</page><page sequence="17">FRANK R. GIORDANO, JR. / 257 relationship which had very little correlation with anything that occurred in the literal world of 'real life'." The chief value of this insight is in what it tells us about Hardy's imaginative processes and in what it implies about our giving too much biographical importance to the "brides of his imagination." Later, however, in a moving conclusion to his discussion of Hardy as widower and lover, Hawkins pays tribute to Hardy's first wife, Emma, the woman who mattered most for his life and art, "The woman whom I loved so, and who loyally loved me." The general nature of Hawkins' critical biography prohibits him from giving extended treatment to all the subjects he raises, but his book is an unusually provocative example of its type. We hear a good deal, for example, about Hardy's Weymouth experience and the group of poems it elicited, and we learn of his relationship with Lady Agnes Grove; about these and other issues, such as the musical traditions Hardy absorbed, his interest in Anglo- Saxon alliteration, the quality of his humor, and his relations to earlier poetic traditions and writers, the reader is stimulated to discover more, to return to the works themselves for another look. Hawkins is not unwilling to make judgments about the quality of Hardy's achievement; and he will admit that some poems have interest merely as technical exercises. But even when a reader wishes to defend what Hawkins considers an inferior poem, or add his own favorites to Hawkins' list of Hardy's "best" poems, or disagree with his estimation of The Dynasts as a tour de force, he recognizes the innate critical taste and considerable scholar- ship that give substance to Hawkins' readings. From its title, one would be led to think that Harold Orel's The Final Years of Thomas Hardy, 1912-1928 completes the splendid work begun in Robert Gittings' Young Thomas Hardy. This is not the case, although Orel's book is solidly founded on his impressive acquaintance with Hardy's life. Rather, Orel's intention is to demonstrate the phases of development in Hardy's poetic career; he believes that there is a late Hardy and that all his ideas and modes of expressing them were not formed by the 1860's. The working out of Orel's thesis does not result in a conventional critical bio- graphy, however; it is rather a collection of essays dealing with some principal topics that informed Hardy's last five volumes. The Final Years begins by surveying the influences in Hardy's early life at Dorchester, which led to his participation in the larger world of London and his career as a professional author. There is a fine discussion of Hardy's poems about the past world of Dorset and his childhood among people he knew there; a chapter on Hardy's occasional poems; another on the relation of forces in nature to humanity. The most satisfying portions of the book, which demonstrate most effectively Orel's contention that Hardy's poetry grew increasingly somber and cheerless toward the end of his life, are those</page><page sequence="18">258/ VICTORIAN POETRY which treat Emma (as Hardy's "inspiration, and often as failed goddess"), his views on Christianity, and his desperation brought on by the Great War and its aftermath. Orel's chapter on Hardy's ideas about drama and the con- temporary theater is welcome; in it he treats The Queen of Cornwall more fully and adequately than anyone previously. A decade before he died, Hardy's meliorism proved untenable and, Orel contends, he became a true pessimist. The causes for his despair were numerous, for Hardy at Max Gate kept his eyes and ears alert to what was happening throughout the world: humankind's present vaingloriousness; the development of mechanical and scientific progress; the lack of philanthropic, ameliorative progress in the use of new knowledge ; man's inability to awaken from the nightmare of history; the presence of suffering and consciousness in nature; the hopelessness of internationalism; the failure of Christianity to shed its supernaturalism; and the inefficacy of poetry to change people's lives. Hardy's final views on Christianity, which he considered a dying creed, are treated in Orel's best chapter, a piece of criticism as intensely felt and honestly, inexorably argued as its subject demands. Gerard Man ley Hopkins Howard W. Fulweiler A particularly important event in Hopkins scholarship this year has been the publication of Tom Dunne's useful Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Compre- hensive Bibliography. With a terminal date of 1969-70, this work attempts, with brief annotations, a comprehensive list of writings about Hopkins in English and a selective list of writings in other languages. There are 2473 entries in all, divided into four sections: published writings by Hopkins; writings about Hopkins in English; writings about Hopkins in other languages; and notes on locations of source materials. An introduction intelligently surveys critical history and defends Bridges' judgment in delaying full publica- tion of Hopkins until 1918. In "Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Comprehensive Bibliography" (HQ 2: 143-151) Dunne describes his bibliography, showing how it differs from those of E. H. Cohen (1969) and Ruth Seelhammer (1970) and from all other bibliographies of Hopkins. Norman H. MacKenzie has published three intriguing and valuable essays on the complex problems of editing Hopkins. "Forensic Document Tech- niques Applied to Literary Manuscripts" (BLR 9: 234-240) shows how "some techniques used by police laboratories in the detection of forgery may prove</page><page sequence="19">HOWARD W. FULWEILER / 259 a major help" in working with literary documents. MacKenzie's problem was centered in MS. B, the album of Hopkins' poems copied out by Bridges. Although the handwriting is mostly Bridges', editorial changes were made by both friends, and Hopkins sometimes tried "to imitate his friend's script- exactly the action of a forger, though from a different motive." A visit to Scotland Yard introduced MacKenzie to the Infrared Image Converter and a binocular microscope with a zoom lens. The former instrument can identify inks of different chemical composition and thus distinguish the editorial changes of Hopkins from those of Bridges. A Converter was subsequently made for the Bodleian, which Professor MacKenzie has used in his interesting and important work on a Hopkins text. In "Hopkins, Robert Bridges and the Modern Editor," Editing British and American Literature, 1880-1920, ed. Eric W. Domville, MacKenzie discusses informatively the relationship between Hopkins and Bridges, and the A and B MSS. "The Lost Autograph of The Wreck of the Deutschland' and Its First Readers" (HQ 3: 91-115) tries "to reconstruct ... the hazardous travels of the autograph up to its silent dis- appearance" and then suggests some of the problems in establishing a defini- tive text for "The Wreck" which result from the loss. Especially interesting is MacKenzie's judicious defense of the often maligned Bridges. Critics usually overlook the fact, for instance, that when Bridges received the MS. of "The Wreck" he was exhausted from hard work among the poor at St. Bartholomew's Hospital- treating nearly 31,000 patients a year. It is remark- able that Bridges was able to be as careful with his friend's work as he was. David J. DeLaura continues ably the task of establishing Hopkins' Victorian background in "Hopkins and Carlyle: My Hero, My Chevalier" (HQ 2 [1975] : 67-76) by showing how "Carlyle's doctrine of work provides the fullest contemporary background for the controverted doctrine of 'The Windhover'." Besides demonstrating the striking parallels in phraseology and thought, DeLaura indicates how "the 'Victorian' Hopkins also marks his distance from, not only the non-Christian Carlyle, but all 'broad' and muscular Christian activists and voluntarists of the Kingsley variety." An interesting reading of the dramatic monologues of 1864-65 appears in "Hopkins' Dramatic Monologues" (HQ 2 [1975] : 51-66). Here Florence K. Riddle suggests that these early poems are dramatic monologues very much in the sense of Robert Langbaum in The Poetry of Experience (1957) except that, unlike certain examples in Tennyson and Browning, they do not put moral absolutes in question, "even when they ask us to sympathize with a deluded or morally reprehensible point of view." Robert C. Wilson once again discusses the Pre-Raphaelite influence upon Hopkins' poetic theory in "Hopkins and the Art of Painting" (Thought 51: 147-160). Jerome Bump provides a thoughtful and informative discussion of Hopkins and Pater, emphasizing their serious differences, in "Hopkins, Pater, and Medievalism" (VN50: 10-15).</page><page sequence="20">260/ VICTORIAN POETRY Taking issue with Harold Bloom's reassessment of Hopkins in The Anxiety of Influence (1973), Paul L. Mariani's thought provoking "Hopkins: Towards a Poetics of Unself consciousness" {Renascence 29: 43-49) sees in Hopkins not "the ghosts of Keats and Tennyson- but a poet attempting to get out from under the Romantic revolution in sensibility altogether; to check the romantic ego, the flaunting Self." He chooses finally to "sing in harmony with the chorus" of the English tradition, "swerving away from the Spenserian / Keatsian / Tennysonian music towards the austerities of Dry den and the late Shakespeare." Wendell Stacy Johnson's "Sexuality and Inscape" (HQ 3: 59-65) offers an intelligent and balanced consideration of sexuality in Hopkins. Hopkins is not a repressed poet in Johnson's view, but evidences an open response to sexual attractiveness. Although sexuality was potentially sacred for Hopkins he believed certain of his sexual responses "required restraining." Unlike many of his contemporaries, Hopkins "was able to put sex in what he clearly saw to be its place." In "Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Study in Counterpoise" (SoR 12: 64-82) Elizabeth Walsh, RSCJ, considers the often discussed problem of Hopkins' suffering in relation to his artistic and his religious vocation. The issue is not whether he could have been a greater poet had he not been a priest, "but was the anguish he suffered an inherent part of his vocation, of his developing to the full the 'inscape' that was his own peculiar individuality." The theme of his life and work was his expression of "the oneness of Being and sacrifice." Our understanding of Hopkins' emphasis on the notion of Duty is enlarged by Norman H. MacKenzie's publication of the poet's unfinished lecture on Cicero's De Offtciis (On Moral Obligation) with a broad and intelligent introduction in "The Imperative Voice- An Unpublished Lecture by Hopkins" (HQ 2 [1975]: 101-116). Combining a thorough grasp of nineteenth-century intellectual history with a penetrating critical intelligence, Gerald L. Bruns has written a distin- guished and illuminating essay in "The Idea of Energy in the Writings of Gerard Manley Hopkins" (Renascence 29: 25-42). As most commentators have noted, "figures of energy fall regularly from Hopkins' pen." Bruns suggests many possible sources for Hopkins' interest in the subject, including Coleridge's concept of mind as "intellectual energy" and Newman's notion of "living intelligence," in which reasoning is a "living spontaneous energy within us." Even more significant, however, was the development of thermo- dynamics, electromagnetism, electrochemistry, "and an array of new physical theories that took recourse to the concept of energy the way Newtonian physics had taken recourse to the idea of substance." Although the "humanists" of the period were more interested in Darwin and evolutionary theory, "the most striking scientific achievements of the century belonged to men like Maxwell, Michael Faraday," and other physicists. Hopkins did</page><page sequence="21">HOWARD W. FULWEILER / 261 attempt to keep up with developments in physics and chemistry. His journal and his poetry come closer to being "the literary equivalent of the scientific energetics" than other literary canons. Hopkins' vision was "predicated upon an idea that would dissolve or overcome the fundamental Victorian opposition between technological power and biological generation." The twentieth-century inclination, however, has been to assimilate energy into a conception of things more darkly problematical than anything the Victorians had imagined- more darkly problematical, because the concept of problem itself has become our regulative idea, the intellectual model to which we habitually recur whenever we try to define our relation to the world and to matters of value. We rarely speak except in terms of "problems"- and seem hardly conscious that we do so- whence follows the powerful irony that both the word and the valuations of our culture have become unspeakable- susceptible to investigation and control, but not to understanding. Given our problematical preconceptions, "the universe of Hopkins- that plenum of energy speaking in luminescent and companionable utterances- seems unimaginable." Bruns's essay is not only historically informative but an important contribution to understanding Hopkins in the twentieth century. Max Keith Sutton ably argues that Hopkins' "serving" may be compared to Jung's process of individuation in "Serving as Individuation in Hopkins: A Jungian Reading" (HQ 2 [1975] : 119-129). Sutton points out quite correct- ly, however, that the analogy cannot be complete since "Jung's sense of reality would have been too subjective for a priest deeply influenced by Aristotle, Aquinas, and Duns Scotus." Two essays consider Hopkins in rela- tion to formal philosophy. Leonard J. Bowman in "Another Look at Hopkins and Scotus" (Renascence 29: 50-56) argues that Scotus alone is not adequate as an influence on Hopkins, but that Scotus must be considered in relation to "the older Franciscan school." Emphasis on "the doctrine of the primacy of Christ, which has been noted as the primary link between Hopkins and Scotus, is merely a suggestion and development in Scotus of the Christo- centric exemplarism that forms the whole thought of Bonaventure." In " 'Each Tucked String Tells': Hopkins and the Word" (Mosaic 9, iii: 41-55) Ronald Marken compares Hopkins to Heidegger, interestingly relating Hopkins' insistence on hearing his poetry aloud to Heidegger's "The Nature of Language" in On the Way to Language (1971). Two linguistic studies of Hopkins have appeared this year. Archibald A. Hill has reprinted his controversial PMLA article, "An Analysis of The Wind- hover. An Experiment in Method," in Constituent and Pattern in Poetry. Ann Harleman Stewart analyzes seven poems with diagrams, attempting a "systematic treatment of surface structure, independent of deep structure" in "The One Less Travelled by: Grammaticality and the Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins" (Lang&amp;S 8 [1975] : 189-210). In "The Musical Analogy" (English 25: 111-134) Michael Black offers an excellent discussion of the musical analogy to poetry, which includes an interesting analysis of "Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves."</page><page sequence="22">262/ VICTORIAN POETRY The year's work brought a number of discussions of individual poems. David J. De Laura's "Hopkins and Mrs. Gaskell: Margaret, Are You Grieving?" (VP 14: 341-345) makes an interesting case for the influence of Mrs. GaskelTs North and South (1854-55) on "Spring and Fall." Amy Lowenstein in "Seeing Tied Beauty': A Key to Theme and Structure" (VP 14: 64-66) intelligently links the visual data of "Red Beauty" with Impressionism, while Conrad Festa's "The Cow, the Finch, and the Trout in 'Pied Beauty' " (HQ 2 [1975] : 93-96) turns to scientific classification to suggest that the creatures of the poem are "representatives of genera whose members are numerous and various. Yet they are unified by a higher principle of family relationships which ultimately extends to and binds together all of creation." Shyamal Bagchee's " 'The Exequy': A Source for Hopkins' 'The Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo' " (HQ 2 [1975] : 131-137) suggests part of Henry King's "The Exequy" as a possible source for Hopkins' poem. "How and why does it go to hell?" Gary L. Stonum asks in "The Hermeneutics of 'Spelt from Sibyl's Leaves' " (HQ 3: 117-129). He attempts "to show that the question finally turns on the relationship of the poet to his poem and of the poem as a piece of language to the kind of hermeneutic process it dramatizes." Hopkins "restricts his activities to those of the unaided human capacity for interpret- ing and understanding." Although Hopkins is not damning himself, there is a possibility he would be if his poem could be "an exact mimesis of the apocalypse it describes." Finally, thus, "the ontological status of the language ... is the sign of the poet's relationship to his prophetic knowledge, and it is also the mark of the ambiguous presence of the divine in the poem." Basing his discussion on Hopkins' undergraduate theorizing in "On the Origin of Beauty: A Platonic Dialogue," Philip Page makes an informative and occasionally illuminating close reading in "Unity and Subordination in 'Carrion Comfort'" (VP 14: 25-32). John Pick's useful "Hopkins and 'Ribblesdale' " (The Stonyhurst Magazine 39: 337-343) discusses the place of the poem in Hopkins' career, its art, its relation to ecology, and its theological aspects. The past year has seen an enormous amount of work appear on "The Wreck of the Deutschland," some of it, of course, owing to the centenary observance of the maritime disaster. Elgin W. Mellown's "The History of the Critical Reception of 'The Wreck of the Deutschland' " (VP 14: 1-9) is a solid survey, divided into three periods: composition until 1930; 1930-36; and 1936 to the present. Mellown concludes that we still lack a "complete, satisfying interpretation" because of the inability of critics to reconcile two divergent attitudes: that which sees the poem "only as an expression of faith" and that of "traditional humanists who value the poem for its aesthetic merit and for its revelation of the human mind which was responsible for it."</page><page sequence="23">HOWARD W. FULWEILER / 263 Beginning with "But it rides time like riding a river" in stanza six, Robert Boyle, S. J., in "Time and Grace in Hopkins' Imagination" {Renascence 29: 7-24), develops a broad theological and aesthetic discussion of the whole poem and of the Hopkins canon. Boyle suggests that "riding a river" is a "rhetorical inversion for reasons of rhythm," as in "To own my heart." "A riding river" seems better to represent the relation of the mystery of grace to time. R. K. R. Thornton suggests in "The Diagram of a Mind" (HQ 3: 47-58) that Hopkins' mind probably "did not develop a great deal after the writing of his first major poem." Searching for "a reconciliation of that division between art and morality" suggested in his undergraduate essay on "The Origin of Our Moral Ideas," Hopkins could see for the first time in "The Wreck" the "way to making his art part of his religion rather than a distraction from it." Although some of his parallels are a bit strained, James W. Parins traces interestingly Coventry Patmore's "Nuptial Analogy" as it is paralleled in "The Wreck" in "Orion of Light: The Patmorean Flavor in Hopkins' 'Wreck' " (HQ 3: 23-33). Orion is not only a great hunter, but "he is also renowned in the world of mythology for his insatiable sexual appetite." Peter Milward, S. J., assisted by Raymond Schoder, S. J., has edited an important, though uneven, volume of fourteen essays devoted to "The Wreck": Readings of the Wreck: Essays in Commemoration of the Centenary of G. M. Hopkins' The Wreck of the Deutschland. Although space precludes review of all the essays, some should be mentioned. Norman H. MacKenzie's " 'Thy Dark Descending': Light and Darkness in The Wreck" offers a potpourri of details: brief discussion of the Board of Trade Inquiry; sources in the Douay version of Job and the prophets and in the Book of Common Prayer version of the Psalms; possible influence of the "overintense" religious novel, the Rev. Edward Monro's The Dark Mountains (1858); the fact that Joseph Conrad was at sea on a French ship during the same storm; and a comparison of light and dark imagery with "A Vision of the Mermaids." In "Christens Her Wild-Worst Best: The Experience of the Nuns and the General Significance of The Wreck" Philip Martin argues that the nuns are not so much special martyrs but are exercising an "ordinary" Christian vocation as is evidenced by the central Baptismal imagery of the poem. Paul L. Mariani's " '0 Christ, Christ, Come Quickly!' Lexical Plenitude and Primal Cry at the Heart of The Wreck" sees the central significance of the poem in "the simple yes paid out to Christ," the first word and alpha of creation and of the poetic creation echoing that, with its Thou at the beginning and its omega word at the end, Lord. Peter Milward, S. J., emphasizes in " 'On a Pastoral Forehead in Wales': The Composition of The Wreck" that the Ignatian composition of place in the poem is the place of composition- the countryside around St.</page><page sequence="24">264/ VICTORIAN POETRY Beuno's and the Vale of Clwyd. James F. Cotter, in his theologically oriented " 'Thou Mastering Me, God': Unity in The Wreck" finds the unity of the poem in the act of faith in Christ's divinity. Warren Anderson's " 'Never- Eldering Revel': The Wreck and the Ode Tradition" is a useful and informa- tive attempt to place "The Wreck" in the ode tradition, emphasizing its relation to Milton and to Pindar. Kunio Shimane in " 'Speech Framed to Be Heard': The Function and Value of Sound Effects in The Wreck" considers the poem as "speech," making a general phonetic examination and emphasizing Hopkins' own accent. The two best essays of the volume are those by Robert Boyle, S. J., and Alison D. Sulloway. In " 'Man Jack the Man Is': The Wreck from the Perspective of The Shepherd's Brow" Boyle offers a perceptive reading of "The Shepherd's Brow" in which a mature Hopkins looks back at the grandiose, but narrow younger poet of "The Wreck." Boyle suggests an interesting parallel in Joyce's looking back at Stephen Dedalus' histrionic "non serviam" and Hopkins' mature judgment of his own "almost frenetic 'Serviam!' " Alison Sulloway 's " 'Strike You the Sight of It?' Intimations of Myth and Tragedy in The Wreck" portrays the poem as a theophany "during which Christ's appearance upon the waters fulfills intimations of earlier theophanies in pagan myths and the bible." She shows interestingly through the processional order of ritual events identified by Gilbert Murray as characteristic of myth and tragedy how "The Wreck" shows "Christ's passion was a divine completion of the plan glimpsed first, among other places, in the imperfect, yet impressive, sacrificial rituals of Greek tragedy." Finally, some miscellaneous items should be mentioned. Margaret Bottrall has edited Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poems. A Casebook (1975), a useful introductory collection of materials about Hopkins. Jean Mambrino has translated six sonnets into French with a brief introduction and notes in "Poemes de Gerard Manley Hopkins" {Etudes 3AA: 79-92). Carl Sutton's "' ... As a Tree Whose Boughs Break in the Sky' " (HQ 3: 19-22) describes a Hopkins exhibit of memorabilia, paintings, and photographs organized in England under the auspices of the Sunderland Arts Centre. A related item is R. K. R. Thornton's handsome All My Eyes See: The Visual World of Gerard Manley Hopkins (1975), a collection of "materials which relate specifically to Hopkins' visual world": portraits of the poet, photographs of people and places he knew, drawings by the poet and other members of his family, and the like. There are informative essays by Thornton, Bevis Hillier, Norman White, Jerome Bump, and Tom Dunne. In conclusion, all students of Hopkins will wish to read Norman H. MacKenzie's "Tribute to John Pick," which opens the special Festschrift number of Renascence devoted to Hopkins in Pick's honor. Other essays from this issue have been noted above.</page><page sequence="25">ALLAN R. LIFE I 265 The Pre-Raphaelites Allan R. Life Since William E. Fredeman surveyed Pre-Raphaelite scholarship to the end of 1972 in Guide to the Year's Work in Victorian Poetry and Prose {191 A), the energetic study of visual and literary Pre-Raphaelitism has continued. Admittedly, a good deal of this activity has been on works that are still in progress or forthcoming, and a disturbing amount of the published criticism, especially of Rossetti, continues to be sensational or superficial. Yet an increasing number of publications of scholarly and critical excellence have conferred new prestige on the study of Pre-Raphaelitism. The painting of the movement has been considered in such books as Allen Staley's The Pre-Raphaelite Landscape (1973) and Penelope Fitzgerald's Edward Burne- Jones: A Biography (1975), and there are enough significant treatments of the literature to require that this survey be extremely selective. With that understanding, this paper will examine major trends in the study of Pre- Raphaelite authors between 1973 and 1976, inclusive. Items from the former year included in Fredeman's 1974 survey are omitted, along with numerous articles detecting Pre-Raphaelite characteristics in authors as disparate as Hopkins and Waugh, Shaw and James, Hawthorne and Joyce. I One indication of the growing interest in Pre-Raphaelitism is the appearance of two new collections: Pre-Raphaelite Writing: An Anthology, edited by Derek Sanford for Everyman's University Library (1973), and Pre-Raphaelitism: A Collection of Critical Essays, edited by James Sambrook (1974). The first offers extracts on Pre-Raphaelite aesthetics, personalities, and controversies, along with an abbreviated sampling of the poetry. The second provides an admirable selection of critical commentary with a judicious introduction. For longer poetic works by the major figures, the best anthology remains Cecil Y. Lang's The Pre-Raphaelites and Their Circle, reissued in a revised second edition (1975). A seminal work on the origins of Pre-Raphaelitism is William E. Fredeman's edition of The PR.B. Journal: William Michael RossettVs Diary of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, 1849-1853 (1975). Mutilated for undetermined reasons by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, this factual yet vivid chronicle by the Secretary of the P.R.B. remains, as Fredeman declares in his Introduction, "the single most important document of the movement." Editing the truncated manuscript, which its author published only in excerpted form in 1900, presented unusual problems, but Fredeman has</page><page sequence="26">266/ VICTORIAN POETRY solved them with a full critical apparatus, accompanied by valuable documentary material in the appendices and detailed explanatory notes. II Though it began with a retrospective exhibition of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's pictures at the Royal Academy (1973), the period under review has essentially been a transitional one in Rossetti studies, with a number of scholarly works in progress and fewer noteworthy critical treatments than appeared in the preceding four years. Compounding this situation is the fact that two volumes listed in Books in Print for 1976, Stanley Weintraub's Four Rossettis and Francis L. Fennell, Jr.'s The Rossetti-Leyland Letters were still unobtainable by the middle of the following year. Other forthcoming books include C. L. Cline's edition of Rossetti's correspondence with Charles Augustus and Kate Ho well; among works in progress, the most substantial is William E. Fredeman's Centenary Edition for the Clarendon Press of Rossetti's letters, which will more than double the contents of the Press's earlier edition by Oswald Doughty and John Robert Wahl. In the meantime, Clarendon has published Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Jane Morris: Their Cor- respondence (1976), edited by John Bryson in association with Janet Camp Troxell. With its thorough annotations and appropriate illustrations, this book provides an indispensable record of a tortuous relationship. Unquestionably the major impediment to studying Rossetti's poetry is the lack of a critical edition giving the variant readings that are abundant for some of his works. The challenging editorial decisions demanded by such an edition are exemplified in two excellent articles: Carl A. Peterson's "The Pierpont Morgan Manuscript of Rossetti's 'The Blessed Damozel': Dating, Authenticity, Significance" (PBSA 61 [1973]: 401-429), and William E. Fredeman's "Rossetti's 'The Blessed Damozel': A Problem in Literary History and Textual Criticism," in English Studies Today (International Association of University Professors of English, 1973), pp. 239-269. Using similar arguments, both authors identify the controversial Morgan Library manu- script of "The Blessed Damozel" as the one sent by Rossetti to Robert Browning in 1855, and both demonstrate that it constitutes an intermediate stage between the printed versions in The Germ (1850) and the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine (1856). Besides considering the Morgan manuscript, Fredeman also proposes that two American printings of the poem contain authorial revisions which are indicated in his appendix, a table of "Variants in the Five Earliest Versions of 'The Blessed Damozel'." As Fredeman and Peterson argue, the revisions of Rossetti's poems docu- ment the "fundamental brain work" that he continued to apply to many works after their composition. The critical significance of these variants is</page><page sequence="27">ALLAN R. LIFE / 267 further demonstrated in Robert N. Keane's "Rossetti: The Artist and The Portrait'" (ELN 12 [1974]: 96-102), which charts the poem from the embryonic first draft of 1847 to the published text of 1870; and in D. M. R. Bentley's "The Belle Assemblee Version of 'My Sister's Sleep' " (VP 12 [1974] : 32 1-334), where an unrecorded first printing of this work is published and discussed. Bentley's discovery is particularly interesting because it substantiates and clarifies Herbert Sussman's argument in "Rossetti's Chang- ing Style: The Revisions of 'My Sister's Sleep' " (VN 41 [1972] : 6-8): that the Germ version of the poem uses its Christian symbolism more conven- tionally than that of 1870, and that the emphasis recently placed by Jerome J. McGann and other critics on Rossetti's "transubstantiated" iconography can distort his intentions in his earlier poetry. A better understanding of Rossetti's use of religious symbolism would also illuminate his pictures, which are being discussed increasingly in analyses of his writings. In theory, this interdisciplinary approach to Rossetti is welcome as well as inevitable; in practice, it has chiefly clarified his poems and pictures that are explicitly related. An exhibition of these works has been shown at Yale University Art Gallery, accompanied by a handsome catalogue, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the Double Work of Art (1976), with essays by Maryan Wynn Ainsworth and other graduate students on the progressively "symbiotic relationship of Rossetti's art and poetry." With rare exceptions, however, even the burgeoning discussions of direct parallels between Rossetti's "double works" have been hindered by inadequate critical methodology: judging from their impressionistic vocabularies and indeter- minate points of reference, art history in Heinrich Wolfflin's or Erwin Panofsky's sense does not even exist for some of these critics. Superior to most recent examinations of Rossetti's "double art" is Richard L. Stein's The Ritual of Interpretation: The Fine Arts as Literature in Ruskin, Rossetti, and Pater (1975). As its title suggests, Stein's book focuses on the responses of these writers to particular artifacts, in a "litera- ture of art" that becomes ritualistic in its intensity and its capacity for affecting "the reader-spectator." Of Rossetti's sonnets for specified pictures, Stein provides sensitive explications; when he turns to the poet's other works, his efforts to relate them to his central theme are sometimes strained. To Stein, the link between Rossetti's poetry and painting, and between these works and "the literature of art" is obtrusive and elliptical form: "Much as his ritual of interpretation enables us to participate in the process of an artist's imagination, Rossetti's dialectical poems require that we actively reconstruct the ideas controlling the polarities of the verse" (p. 163). Further- more, this reconstruction process often reveals "the implicit weakness in such poetry, as in much of the literature of art": "a problem of thought is con- verted into a problem of aesthetics" (p. 194). Stein argues, indeed, that much</page><page sequence="28">268 / VICTORIAN POETRY of Rossetti's poetry is concerned either with art or with perceptual issues that are potentially aesthetic; he regards art as the dominant theme and the most durable hope in The House of Life, and even the gold bar in "The Blessed Damozel" "suggests the protective barrier placed in front of paintings . . . ; Rossetti is playfully underscoring the theme of the DamozeFs unreality" (p. 148). As this comment suggests, Stein's emphasis on the formal, dialectical aspects of Rossetti's work is excessive, and he advances dubious generaliza- tions to relate not only Rossetti but the whole of Pre-Raphaelitism to his major thesis. Fortunately, Stein's analysis of specific works often transcends these fairings; especially welcome is his discussion of the minute details of early pictures by Holman Hunt and J. E. Millais, where the prominence of form "alerts us to the possibility of different levels of meaning" (p. 170), Though a similar interpretation of these works is provided by Carol T. Christ in The Finer Optic: The Aesthetic of Particularity in Victorian Poetry (1975), she lacks Stein's perception that the emphatic structure of Rossetti's pictures, as much as the detailed rendering of canvases by other Pre-Raphaelites, can be related to the formalism of his poetry. Like Stein, Gilnther Jarfe regards The House of Life as preeminently concerned with art, and he explores this theme and its ramifications in Kunstform und Verzweiflung: Studien zur Typologie der Sonettgestalt in Dante Gabriel Rossettis 'The House of Life' (1973). In the process, he classifies each sonnet under one of four types of "train of thought," further subdivided into categories of "emotional" or "reflective" character. These analytical distinctions will be too fine for many readers, but Jarfe links this framework to perceptive comments on the relationship between allegory and drama in the work, and on the speaker's diminishing hope of attaining lasting beauty. Unlike Jarfe and Stein, Florence Saunders Boos emphasizes the compositional history of The House of Life in The Poetry of Dante G. Rossetti: A Critical Reading and Source Study (1976). Treating sonnets from the sequence as examples of Rossetti's creative periods, she chiefly considers the issues of internal unity that preoccupy Jarfe and Stein in copious notes, where the arguments of her predecessors are summarized and evaluated. This procedure is characteristic of Mrs. Boos's study, where the main text con- centrates on works or approaches to them generally neglected before 1972, when most of this book was completed as a dissertation subtitled with the major concerns of the published version: "Sex, Prosody, and Literary Antecedents." Less consistent and sophisticated than that in Joseph F. Vogel's Dante Gabriel Rossetti's Versecraft (1971), Mrs. Boos's analysis of Rossetti's prosodic development still contains genuine insights, and her notes and appendices devoted to antecedents make important points. Unfortu- nately, her treatment of these subjects is sometimes vitiated by a pseudo-</page><page sequence="29">ALLAN R. LIFE I 269 sociological perspective on the first topic in her original subtitle. Persuaded that Rossetti was "sexist in a sexist era," and that the "predominant trait of [his] character was . . . guilt," she provides the most hostile reading of "Jenny" since Buchanan, denying Rossetti the dramatic objectivity that she concedes him when he treats themes less susceptible to his- or her own- prejudices. Though Mrs. Boos contrasts Rossetti's subject in "Jenny" with the "more remote" one of A Last Confession, she provides neither an analysis of the second work nor any consideration of the first as a dramatic monologue. Significantly, Rossetti's mastery of this poetic form is clarified in a recent article by Carl A. Peterson, whose 1961 dissertation has avowedly influenced other sections of Mrs. Boos's study. In "Rossetti's A Last Confession as Dramatic Monologue" (VP 1 1 [1973] : 127-142), Peterson demonstrates both the psychological consistency of this portrayal of a "physically and spiritually tormented lover" and the role of recurrent patterns of imagery in creating this effect. One of the least appreciated aspects of Rossetti's canon remains his translations, which offer unique opportunities to study his sources of inspira- tion. These works receive informative treatment in "Rossetti's Translations of Early Italian Lyrics" (VP 12 [1974] : 351-362), where Elisabeth G. Gitter shows that Rossetti, while endeavoring to capture the spirit of these works, also reconciled it with his own dominant themes and techniques. If her article has a fault, indeed, it is a basic lack of sympathy for the Romantic tradition to which Rossetti belongs, reinforced by the assumption that he elaborated for its own sake the visual imagery of his early Italian originals. A study of the "significant details" of Rossetti's translations, along the lines evolved by Jerome J. McGann (VP, 1969) and continued in such studies as Carol T. Christ's The Finer Optic, might well suggest a more complex intention than Gitter recognizes behind this accentuated pictorialism. Ill Though her work has been examined in a few perceptive articles, the study of Christina Rossetti, like that of her brother, has been retarded by the absence of a critical edition of her poetry. Such a work is being edited by H. B. de Groot, who discusses the poet's recently discovered manuscripts for the "Portfolio Society" in "Christina Rossetti's 'A Nightmare': A Fragment Completed" (RES 24 [1973] : 48-52). Another edition is being prepared by Rebecca W. Crump, who has published Maude: Prose and Verse (1976), a meticulous edition of Christina Rossetti's early novella. R. W. Crump has also published Christina Rossetti: A Reference Guide (1976), an annotated list of primary and secondary works that will encourage</page><page sequence="30">270/ VICTORIAN POETRY future study. Its value would have been increased, however, if Mrs. Crump had adopted a more critical tone, along with a simpler format: the number of entries simply does not justify a chronological inventory with yearly divisions into "Books" and "Shorter Writings." Considering the amount of scholarship in progress on this poet, this reference guide is basically premature ; even the indefatigable Twayne's English Authors Series, with two hundred titles to its credit, has waited until 1977 to devote the two-hundred-and-first to Christina Rossetti. IV In the "Introduction" to the essays on William Morris that he edited for Victorian Poetry, William E. Fredeman confesses "to having been initially surprised that the editors . . . should have selected Morris for a special number, since he has not, in the first twelve volumes of that journal, been conspicuously prominent" (VP 13 [Fall-Winter 1975- hereafter cited as "Morris number"] : xix-xxx). Two years later, this handsome collection has taken its place beside several major reassessments of Morris' accomplishment. His work as a designer and a printer has been particularly appreciated: besides excellent exhibitions at Stanford University (1975) and the Pierpont Morgan Library (1976), there have been A. Charles Sewter's The Stained Glass of William Morris and His Circle (1974, 1975), and such sumptuous editions as The Story of Cupid and Psyche with Burne-Jones's illustrations, introduced by A. R. Dufty (1974). Dufty's introduction is especially notable because it concerns designs largely engraved by Morris for his own poem; the poet's illuminations for his own lyrics are among the works discussed in Joseph R. Dunlap's principal contribution to the Morris number of Victorian Poetry, "Morris and the Book Arts before the Kelmscott Press" (pp. 141-157). Aside from such treatments of interrelated works, however, there has been little on the general affinities between Morris' work in different arts beyond K. B. Valentine's essay in the same issue, "Motifs from Nature in the Design Work and Prose Romances of William Morris (1876-1896)" (pp. 83-89). Though it suggests a few parallels between Morris' writings and his designs, Jack Lindsay's William Morris: His Life and Work (1975) con- centrates on less aesthetic patterns to clarify the "central dynamic" behind Morris' career. Primarily, Lindsay identifies this force with Morris' efforts to recapture the literal and metaphorical forest of his childhood, and this idea even permeates the conclusion of the book, where Lindsay suggests how Morris infused the Marxist concept of "liberated work" with his own "effort to link art and life, art and productive process." Lindsay's eloquence in discussing this insight makes one wish that he had written a critical study instead of a chronological biography, dominated not only by its subject's</page><page sequence="31">ALLAN R. LIFE / 271 nostalgia for the forest but by the unsupported theory that Morris endured frustrated passion for his eldest sister, whose marriage introduces a "theme" that Lindsay pursues through the life as well as the work. Even in its interpretive excesses, however, Lindsay's biography epitomizes the fascination with Morris' personality that has accompanied the growing appreciation of his genius. Both trends have intensified the need for the scholarly edition of Morris' letters that Norman Kelvin is now completing. In the meantime, it is good to have Richard L. Harris' account of the largely unpublished correspondence between Morris and Eirikur Magnusson (VP [Morris number] : 119-130), which documents Morris' relations with Iceland and its sagas. Unpublished literature by Morris is also being recovered. Particularly valuable are two articles by K. L. Goodwin: "Unpublished Lyrics of William Morris" (YES 5 [1975] : 190-206), where these works are listed, discussed, and selectively quoted; and "An Unpublished Tale from The Earthly Paradise" (VP [Morris number] : 91-102), which establishes the significance of Morris' "The Story of Dorothea" in its own right and as a treatment of a theme also used by Swinburne and Burne-Jones. A third unpublished work, previously dismissed as an "abortive novel," is related to Morris' development as a prose writer by Jessie Kocmanova* in " 'Landscape and Sentiment': Morris' First Attempt in Longer Prose Fiction" (VP [Morris number] : 103-117). The reassessment of Morris' achievement exemplified by these articles has stimulated interest in the Victorian reception of his writings. A capable discussion of this subject is provided in Delbert R. Gardner's An "Idle Singer" and His Audience: A Study of William Morris's Poetic Reputation in England, 1858-1900 (1975), and Peter Faulkner has assembled an admirable collection of essays and unpublished comments from the same period in William Morris: The Critical Heritage (1973). Primarily concerned with nineteenth-century viewpoints, Gardner's conclusion and Faulkner's introduction themselves illustrate opposed attitudes to Morris' canon that have become more emphatic with increased appreciation of the later works. The Earthly Paradise and the other long narrative poems that resonate for Gardner with "maturing poetic power" are to Faulkner less characteristic of Morris' genius than the early romances in prose and verse, which he has also edited for Everyman's Library (1973). Though Faulkner's preference for the early writings is shared by many critics, Gardner is not alone in an admiration for the later poetry which is conclusively justified by Blue Calhoun's The Pastoral Vision of William Morris: uThe Earthly Paradise" (1975). Focusing on Morris' reference in an 1886 lecture to "the mood of energy and the mood of idleness," Blue Calhoun identifies in this poem and in such later works as News from</page><page sequence="32">272/ VICTORIAN POETRY Nowhere a "dialectical perspective," analogous to the "double vision" through which the pastoral form encounters conflicting social and natural realities. Her argument is intricate and sophisticated, demanding from the reader a thorough acquaintance with the poem. One of her central concerns, the relationship between the "energy" of the quest and the "idleness" inherent in the pastoral tradition, also informs another seminal discussion of the work, Carole G. Silver's "The Earthly Paradise: Lost" (VP [Morris number] : 27-42). Denying the prevalent charge that the poem is escapist, Carole Silver interprets the work as a progressively despairing exploration of the psychological quest for immutable love. Just as the external paradise is discounted in the prologue, so hopes for the paradise within are gradually abandoned amid the frustrated love of the concluding tales. With their direct and oblique embodiment of Morris' final commitment to social change, such late prose fictions as A Dream of John Ball and News from Nowhere have always commanded some appreciation, and News from Nowhere, in particular, has received mounting praise on aesthetic as well as didactic grounds. The work is lauded on both counts by Patrick Brantlinger in "'News from Nowhere': Morris's Socialist Anti-Novel" (VS 19 [1975]: 35-49), which proposes that the book represents a conscious departure from the "great tradition" of nineteenth-century fiction "and an example of the collective art which will become possible in Utopia." For the commensurate decline of "noncollective" art, Brantlinger expresses little regret; it seems a small price for escaping the conflict and morbid introspection underlying modern "creativity." Less rejoicing at such a prospect is conveyed in the "Introduction" to the Morris number of Victorian Poetry, where William E. Fredeman confesses misgivings about a work in which "the author of the longest poem in English writes himself into a corner, for he would, in his own terms, have no place in the new Jerusalem of News from Nowhere." Still more emphatic reservations about the message of the book dominate Lionel Trilling's "Aggression and Utopia: A Note on William Morris's 'News from Nowhere'" (Psychoanalytic Quarterly 42 [1973]: 214-225), where B. F. Skinner's thesis in Beyond Freedom and Dignity is linked to Morris' conviction that happiness entails "the surrender of ... the imaginative will of genius in aggressive adversary relation to the world as it is, shaping the intractable stuff of error-laden and suffering humanity into high art." Though this controversy is ultimately more doctrinal than literary, the distinction is elusive with a work as systematically Utopian as News from Nowhere. That it can still inspire such provocative responses is one measure of the book's, and Morris', achievement.</page><page sequence="33">ALLAN R. LIFE I 213 V Of the minor Pre-Raphaelites, only William Michael Rossetti and William Bell Scott have received noteworthy attention. William Rossetti's art notices in the periodicals from 1850-78 are listed in an annotated checklist by R. W. Peattie (VPN 8 [1975] : 79-92), and his slender but genuine creative gifts are recognized in "A Key Poem of the Pre-Raphaelite Movement: W. M. Rossetti's 'Mrs. Holmes Grey'," contributed by William E. Fredeman to Nineteenth-Century Literary Perspectives: Essays in Honor of Lionel Steven- son (1974). Marked by an "intensity of... overall surface realism" reminiscent of early Pre-Raphaelite pictures, "Mrs. Holmes Grey" is printed as an appendix to Fredeman 's edition of The PR.B. Journal. Fredeman 's edition also includes an introductory reassessment of William Michael Rossetti, an enlightened man disparaged by popularize rs as insuffi- ciently sensational. William Bell Scott has been assailed for more complex reasons, but he too has found a champion in Fredeman, who since 1967 has based three Rylands Library monographs on the Scott papers that he discovered at Penkill Castle in Ayrshire. In " 'From Insult to Protect': the Pre-Raphaelites and the Biographical Fallacy," contributed to Sources for Reinterpretation: . . . Essays in Honor of C. L. Cline (1975), Fredeman gives an entertaining account of these papers, which document not only Scott's activities but those of his entire circle. Furthermore, Scott's letters to the owner of Penkill, Alice Boyd, are of independent literary value, establishing him for Fredeman as "a letter writer at least equal to Rossetti." Certainly, the excerpts from this correspondence published in Fredeman's The Letters of Pictor Ignotus (1976) preserve the reflections of an observant and articulate man; whether his subject is Whistler or Ruskin, Whitman or the Rossettis, Scott illuminates the period when Pre-Raphaelitism affected the current of aesthetic life.</page><page sequence="34">274/ VICTORIAN POETRY The Poets of the Nineties Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV Materials are not abundant for 1976. I mention several articles, then concentrate upon three books. F. G. Atkinson's "John Davidson- Some Contributions to Standard Biography" (N&amp;Q 220 [1975] : 449-450) should interest all students of Victorian poetry. More than just biographical data, the two letters from Davidson to Quiller-Couch and Atkinson's comments about poems included in the 1900 and 1939 editions of The Oxford Book of English Verse throw light upon the reputations of Davidson, Meredith, and Watson. Similar is I. C. Small's "Lionel Johnson's 'A Friend': A Probable Subject for the Poem." Pater is the subject, and the article conveniently assembles documents about the Pater-Johnson relationship (N&amp;Q 221: 69-70). Reviewing Fraser Harrison's selections from The Yellow Book, J. M. Munro (VPN 8 [1975] : 142-144) may surprise some with his ideas concerning the relative unimportance of that periodical now so legend -encrusted. He sees its value as the limning of tensions between the sexes at the close of the nineteenth century. Not so surprising is G. A. Cevasco's "John Gray (1866-1934): A Primary Bibliography and an Annotated Bibliography of Writings about Him" (ELT 19: 49-63). We learn much here about Silverpoints and, to a lesser degree, Spiritual Poems as representing decadence. An addition, or a compilation for someone else to do, not merely for the Gray specialist but for students of the nineties, is an annotated census of manu- scripts, particularly in the light of Anthony Ross's comments (Blackfriars 44 [1963] : 444-445) about the lack of Gray MSS. in the Dominican House, Edinburgh. Another repository, holding several signed autograph letters, a MS. of Silverpoints, and pertinent documents, is the Rare Books Room of Princeton's Firestone Library. The artistic Housmans continue to draw attention, with biographical and bibliographical works coming to the fore. Alan Bell's A. E. Housman: Fifteen Letters to Walter Ashburner increases the amount of published correspon- dence, as well as the biographical dimension. Ashburner, an American who lived long in England, then Florence, shared with AEH a love of classical pursuits, good food, and fine wine. A friend of both was Horatio Brown, Venetian chronicler and biographer of J. A. Symonds. Ashburner's Housman was not the familiar personage of glacial isolation, although, Pro- fessor of Jurisprudence at Oxford as he was, Ashburner had to endure AEH's barbs about his legal writings. Remarks about Andrea, Housman's Venetian gondolier toward whom he entertained more than casual feelings, add to the value of Bell's book. So does the last letter, dated December 27, 1930, in which AEH expresses his not-so-warm emotions for Cyril Clemens, relative of</page><page sequence="35">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV I 275 S. L. Clemens and promoter of the Mark Twain Society. AEH refused the "very vacuous" Cyril's request to write a biography of him, late in 1931, although that worthy did print essays about him in the Mark Twain Quarterly, which Cyril edited. Now in the National Library of Scotland, these letters were apparently unavailable to Henry Maas when he prepared his edition of AEH's correspondence. Yet another assemblage of unpublished AEH letters, in the New York Public Library, as well as one owned by me will be described (the former) and published (the latter) in the next issue of the Housman Society Journal. Having recently consulted significant Laurence Housman signed autograph letters in the New York Public, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, and Huntington Libraries, I see the need for a good edition of his letters, literary- graphic artist that he was. The Beardsley revival continues apace, most notably in two seasoned Beardsleyites' revisitations of their subject. Brigid Brophy's Beardsley and his World and Stanley Weintraub's Aubrey Beardsley: Imp of the Perverse complement each other in biographical and critical detail, although the former more consistently interlards analyses with chronology. Brophy also seems intent upon putting both Robert Ross and R. A. Walker (with side glances at Ellen Beardsley, who supplied much of Walker's information) in their places- both pretty low on the ladder of worthwhile climbers toward comprehending Beardsley. Weintraub's revision of his earlier biography aims, more evidently, toward providing a reliable "life" with sufficient "letters" to make it a critical biography, but with biography uppermost throughout. His is a balanced presentation of the fated young artist, with none of the thesis- riding popular some years ago in Beardsley studies. Strangely, in outlining the Beardsley-Dowson relationship, Weintraub bypasses Longaker's Ernest Dowson, itself a model of balance, in any of its three editions since 1945. Perhaps typically, Longaker casts Beardsley into much deeper shade in this context than Weintraub does. What feelings may or may not have existed between these young, dying artists gets a skirting handling, although Weintraub gives amplitude to other pieces in the puzzle that is Aubrey Beardsley. The unpleasant working relationship with Symons on the Savoy, for instance, indicates but one of several high points in Beardsley 's artistic career during which the ill will of another person caused the young illustrator more bother than he merited. In this situation Beardsley maintained a calm, if sometimes barbed-humorous demeanor, evident in his letters to Smithers wherein he mentions Symons' dislike of his verse (the published examples not so bad, those unpublished but quoted revealing promise). That this same impishness could wax more perverse, maybe fittingly so in this matter, is evident in the Beardsley-Wilde saga. Once Oscar's downfall brought about Aubrey's dismissal from The Yellow Book, the illustrator pretty much</page><page sequence="36">276 / VICTORIAN POETRY avoided, while he graphically satirized, the man who "made" him in consent- ing to Beardsley's illustrating Salome. As usual, Wilde overstated his case, although he later requested Beardsley illustrations for The Ballad of Reading Gaol- in vain. Beerbohm, Lane, Matthews, Whistler, Smithers, figures central to the nineties, all receive just due in Weintraub's pages. Smithers' friendship with Beardsley, to say the least, was odd, and had no favors given it in the erratic memoirs of his son, Jack. Smithers was, in his fashion, faithful to Aubrey Beardsley, more so than to any other in his coterie. Brophy and Weintraub forge more and more links in the chains binding literature and other arts during the nineties. Brophy gives greater prominence to the impact of William Porden's Dome and of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton upon Beardsley's art than some might accept, although she argues convincingly. The Dome was indeed mosque-like, and the mingling of "Moorish, Tartar, Gothic, and Chinese" in the latter could have stimulated young Aubrey's imagination into assimilating those elements into his own art. They could also have taught him "the lesson of truth to the imagination" (pp. 6-7). Both Beardsleyites agree, Weintraub elaborating more than Brophy, that music, the theatre, and literature unmistakably shaped Aubrey's artistic bent. Both also concur that his art is lyrical, although neither speculates, as they might, upon the figure of Pater in this carpet. Weintraub notes that many of the Rhymers who had contributed to The Yellow Book and went on to work for The Savoy were inspired by the twin influences of Rossetti and Pater, and I would wonder if Pater's theories of art's aspiring toward the condition of music did not lead on to some of Beardsley's creations. Pre- Raphaelitism more generally, introduced to the developing young illustrator by Burne-Jones, was transmuted by Beardsley, and by his imitators, into Art Nouveau, and thence to the increasingly abstract ventures of the twentieth century. Morris, by default, also looms as another figure in the Beardsley carpet. Insulted by the older man's denunciations of his drawings, Beardsley took frequent opportunities to satirize Morris' type of medievalism in illustrating the Morte d 'Arthur for Dent and elsewhere. Like Poe, whose works were childhood delights, Beardsley never suppressed his penchant for insinuating mockeries and hoaxes into apparently serious work, and it is worth pausing over the later nineteenth-century artist's talents along these lines. Critiques of Beardsley have been customarily too ready to pounce upon the erotic, morbid aspects of his work, overlooking until recently (as is the case with Poe) the comic potential that makes these drawings and writings genuinely grotesque- which is what Beardsley stated his art assuredly was. Brophy discerns the use of black and white, the colors of print, to imply other colors. In his own imagination Beardsley may have</page><page sequence="37">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV I 277 realized that these colors are the colors of literature, and in using a medium at once expressive of written and graphic expression he created word pictures in the famous black and white like those attempted by Rossetti and Morris, who crossed media lines in their experiments. The blurring of the line between the medium and the reality it mimes suggests Poe again, whose "Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym" has been read much in the manner of Brophy's reading of Beardsley. The abundant illustrations in Weintraub and Brophy's books make the reading of them almost Beardsleyesque, and recall the illustrator's own observations about the mixture of beauty and usefulness in the poster form (quoted by Weintraub, pp. 90-91). These writers shed much illumination upon their subject, performing great services not just to Aubrey Beardsley but to cultural studies of the late Victorian and Edwardian milieu. Furthermore, because the genres that were once so formally separated have been merged in many recent critical approaches, Beardsley, like Beerbohm, comes much more emphatically to deserve the title "Poet of the Nineties." His eerie combina- tions of the comic with the horrifying or the morbid make him indeed a master of that grotesque that he so dearly loved, and place him in the company of other artists in that mode, such as Dickens, Swinburne, and Poe. With tuberculosis dogging him at every turn of the road, it is no wonder that suffering and humor are his hallmarks. His fashionings in these materials make him akin to Frost, with his "momentary stay against confusion." Tears are ever close to laughter in the Beardsley world, and his expressions of them place him high among the creators of fantasy art, a subject not overlooked by Brophy and Weintraub. Weintraub 's bracketing of Beardsley's graphics with Faulkner's haunting prose is splendid, and others have begun to realize greater affinities between the two. Both are, fittingly, the embodiments of numerous contrarieties, and both are only newly being treated as less than freakish. Today Beardsley emerges as Poe has: legends disappear and the creative artist appears. Brophy and Weintraub deserve congratulations for hastening the removal of three-quarters of a century's accumulation of cobwebs.</page><page sequence="38">278 / VICTORIAN POETRY Swinburne Robert A. Greenberg Unpublished materials continue to come to light, though the interest of this year's offerings tends to be somewhat marginal. Two of the brief essays retrieved in Edward P. Schuldt, "Three Unpublished Balliol Essays of A. C. Swinburne" (RES 27: 422-430), are essentially formal Latin exercises, one on the reasons for survival of ancient writings, the other on the life of Henry VIII; the remaining essay, a disquisition in English on the roots of "false impressions," is rather tightly argued and also curiously provoking in its anticipation of a theme that will resonate polemically at later stages of the poet's career. Though none of the three approaches distinction in its own terms, collectively they provide that much more information about Swinburne's Oxford time. Nor are there significant surprises to be found in the miscellaneous correspondence printed by Terry L. Meyers, "Two Swin- burne Letters" (N&amp;Q 23: 63-66), and Francis Jacques Sypher, "New Letters by Swinburne" (HLB 24: 55-59). The total of eight letters, ranging in date from 1872 to 1909, tells us virtually nothing new of the poems and adds only incidental biographical details to what already exists in print. Douglas C. Fricke's "The Idea of Love in Swinburne's 'The Sundew' " (ELN 13: 194-201) relates the poem to elements of the Romantic tradition and emphasizes its positive vision of love and of the interrelate dness of the whole natural world, including man. Fricke finds in the speaker the emergence of a stable, coherent sense of self and life- a motif he implicitly returns to when discussing the speaker of the "Hymn to Proserpine" in another essay, "The Proserpine Figure in Swinburne's Poems and Ballads I" in Aeolian Harps: Essays in Literature in Honor of Maurice Browning Cramer, ed. Donna G. and Douglas C. Fricke. "The Garden of Proserpine" and "Hymn to Proserpine" are here read as antithetical responses by the "personality" (not Swinburne's) animating the whole of Poems and Ballads, as it seeks to cope with the certitudes of change and death. In their opposition, the poems are said to reflect the larger pattern of conflict manifest in the volume. The essay is suggestive, but not entirely convincing: one asks if the moods and attitudes given play in the Proserpine poems are not so much antithetical as complementary, and if it is not merely a fictional convenience to postulate an independent "personality," apparently apart from Swinburne, as the animat- ing presence in a collection written variously over a seven-year period. Swinburne's classical and mythological impulses and the literary context of his work seem, indeed, to dominate this year's work. Apostolos and Lilika Marmaras, "An English Translation of the Ancient Greek Dedicatory Verses to Atalanta in Calydori" (in Aeolian Harps), provide a verse version of the</page><page sequence="39">ROBERTA. GREENBERG / 279 dedication to Landor and consider the relationship of its style and content to the Greek elegiac tradition. Though comment is discouraged on essays appear- ing in Victorian Poetry, note should be taken of Terry L. Meyers' "Shelley's Influence on Atalanta in Calydon" (14: 150-154) and Robert A. Greenberg's "Swinburne and the Redefinition of Classical Myth" (14: 175-195). Antony H. Harrison's "Swinburne's Tristram of Lyonesse: Visionary and Courtly Epic" (MLQ 37: 370-389) makes a case for the high quality of the poem and offers an interesting, if somewhat discursive, discussion of its epical mode, relating it to a variety of other traditions, especially those of Courtly Love and Romantic Narrative. The poem is best read as a visionary recreation of established materials. Swinburne's recourse to other poets is once again argued in Stephen Clifford Wilson's "Swinburne, Tennyson, and 'The Sisters' " (N&amp;Q 23: 407-408), which proposes an indebtedness to Tennyson for elements of plot and character in Swinburne's late play. Tennyson Joseph Sendry One of the most significant developments in Tennyson scholarship during this decade has been an effort to account for the elusive complexity of the poet's style. Alan Sinfield began his study The Language of Tennyson's "In Memoriam" (1971) by noting that the methods for close reading devised during the ascendancy of the New Criticism were inappropriate for Tennyson because his verse generally lacked "the irony, the paradox, the extravagant metaphor, the tough reasonableness, the rough, colloquial rhythm" that those methods were at their best in disclosing. By focusing on characteristic patterns in Tennyson's use of language, Sinfield was able to uncover new layers of subtlety and richness in the texture of the elegy. More inclusive in scope, F. E. L. Priestley's Language and Structure in Tennyson's Poetry (1973) used his subject's developing sense of language at a number of levels as an approach to the artistic growth of a lifetime. Especially noteworthy were Priestley's chapters discussing Tennyson's experimentation with genre and the poet's reflections on the limitations of language for communicating experi- ence directly, and hence on the need to improve its efficacy through strategies of indirection. Now Tennyson's Style by W. David Shaw comple- ments and enlarges upon the work of Sinfield and Priestley, to both of whom he acknowledges indebtedness. Shaw's book is the centerpiece for the past</page><page sequence="40">280/ VICTORIAN POETRY year's work on Tennyson and indeed a high point in recent Tennyson scholar- ship. In addition to being the weightiest study of the poet to appear in the period under review, it is central here for another reason: Tennyson's use of language has, more than any other single issue, captured the attention of the Tennysonians who published during 1976. Shaw, like Sinfield, begins his book by clearing away lingering preconceptions that stand in the way of a just appreciation of Tennyson's style. He quotes T. S. Eliot's complaint about the crudeness of Tennyson's blank verse, alleging it to be incapable of registering "complicated, subtle, and surprising emotions." But the standard (and standing) objections to the style go back farther. Among the Victorians Walter Bagehot criticized Tennyson's ornateness, and Ruskin consigned him to the second rank of poets, those who- in Shaw's words- "use ornament functionally, to create an atmosphere of indistinct illusion." Taking such criticisms as his point of departure, Shaw undertakes to vindicate Tennyson's style by demonstrating its complexity, subtlety, and variety. The study follows a predominantly, though not exclusively, chronological order marked off into stages corresponding to the principal stylistic modes that Tennyson evolved over his long career. If any one principle underlies Shaw's approach, it is the interplay of contrasting elements. However ornate Tennyson's style may be or however much it may deal in illusory states, Shaw finds that the ornateness coexists with other qualities and that the illusion is controlled by functioning within larger patterns. "My conclusion," he writes, "is not simply that Tennyson is a master of directness and indirectness, of stable identities and dissolving roles, but that in his best verse ... he has an extraordinary talent for introducing both effects at once." It is to indirectness (a concept invoked frequently in the course of the book) and dissolving roles that Shaw pays most attention. These considerations will help in distinguishing the contours of the many-sided argument of the book, which I can hope only to sketch here. Shaw finds Tennyson at the beginning of his career least successful when he is most direct: in such affirmations as "The Poet" or in the unmediated imagery of work like "Recollections of the Arabian Nights"- what Hallam called the poetry of sensation. More successful are poems in which the young writer found ways of refining sensations, as, for example, by mirroring the city in the river of "Timbuctoo," introducing thought at the end of "The Lotos Eaters," or juxtaposing incongruous images in "The Hesperides." For its significance in the poet's career, Shaw compares Tennyson's breakthrough to a simpler, elegiac mode (in work leading to "Tithonus" and "Ulysses") with the traditional graduation of the pastoral poet to higher themes. But it was through the dramatic monologue (that intermediary between lyric on one</page><page sequence="41">JOSEPH SENDR Y I 281 hand, drama and narrative on the other) and more gradually in narrative itself that Tennyson learned his major lessons in indirection. With The Princess, where mock-heroic adjusts the perspective on dream romance, narrative indirection becomes part of the poet's repertory. As he approaches the longer poems of Tennyson's maturity, genre plays an increasingly important role in Shaw's analysis. On this matter he follows Priestley, who argues that Tennyson came to use genres not in the traditional way as fixed forms, each with its own stylistic decorum, but in the manner of the Romantics, as a range of effects which the poet might choose from and combine. The three poems that Shaw judges to be Tennyson's best (In Memoriam, Maud, and "Lucretius") are all, in his words, "poems which combine genres and mix techniques." Thus, lacking the coherence of a single genre, In Memoriam draws on the coherences of several- "pastoral elegy, philosophical treatise, lyric sequence, and autobiographical poem"- leaving readers to constitute the final order for themselves. Maud combines dramatic catharsis with lyric power. And in "Lucretius" the opposing strains that Shaw finds inherent in the dramatic monologue as a literary type, psychology and rhetoric, merge. Through a psychological study of Lucretius, whom Shaw labels a positivist, Tennyson is able to launch a rhetorical attack on positivism itself. In the Idylls, however, Tennyson's strategy of intermixing begins to lose its effectiveness. Shaw thinks that manifold styles and multiple oppositions make the poem "the victim of its own duality," and that of twelve idylls only "The Holy Grail" and "The Passing of Arthur" fully succeed. A chapter on the political and visionary poetry finds Tennyson using a reflective mode marked by tentativeness, the idealist's indirection as he confronts a bleak, changing world. Against the "ceremonial richness" of some autumn flower- ings like "Demeter and Persephone" the late elegies reveal a drastic bareness of style, the price paid by the poet for a newly won serenity in the face of death. Shaw's study is often at its best when he is engaged in the analysis of individual poems. A typical analysis includes placement of a poem within one or more general stylistic modes. In Memoriam, for example, is seen as combining epigraphic concision and reflective digressiveness. By treating "Ulysses" as an intermixture of the heroic and elegiac, Shaw is able to throw fresh light on that much analyzed poem without departing from our common sense perceptions of it. At another level of analysis he examines the individual components of a style, singling out the ones which function most crucially within the total configuration of a poem. The introduction lists the components with which he will be working: "tone, genre, prosody, rhetoric,</page><page sequence="42">282 / VICTORIAN POETRY and syntax." The usual method is to chart the interrelations, whether congruence or counterpoint, among patterns formed within a poem by the elements listed. In practice Shaw is eclectic, appropriating Eisenstein's ideas on film- making to elucidate Maud as comfortably as Hopkins' distinction between diatonic and chromatic beauty to describe Tennyson's poetic structures. The arsenal from which he brings a major part of his critical ammunition, however, is the venerable trivium, and his list of five stylistic components might well be adjusted to include grammar and logic. Shaw's analyses gain solidity from the figures of formal logic and the terminology of classical rhetoric that he deploys with ease- always taking care, considerately yet unobtrusively, to remind us of the meaning of the terms used. But if grammar and rhetoric get no mention at the start of the book, they and the other main critical terms used ("indirection" is one) are well represented in a most help- ful index at the end. One section of the adjacent bibliographical essay will even tell the reader where to learn how much and what kind of rhetoric Tennyson knew, and where he was likely to have learned it. The biblio- graphical essay covers not only matters of style but also a number of other fundamentally important topics: Tennyson's thought, his poetic develop- ment, his experiments with genre, Victorian poetic theory, dissociation of sensibility, major classes of his works, and individual major poems. Readers will find themselves well briefed on the present state of these questions and offered a select bibliography for each. Perusers of the year's work especially will be grateful for these aids. To pass from W. David Shaw to Alan Sinfleld is to go from an abundant eclecticism to a more rigorous stylistics, one that successfully combines the narrower focus of linguistic and quantitative approaches with broader humanistic concerns. He accomplished this in The Language of Tennyson 's "In Memoriam " by confining himself to a single poem and by organizing his analysis according to formal categories: diction, syntax, imagery, sound, and rhythm. In a new article, "Tennyson's Imagery" (Neophil 60: 466-479), Sinfleld refines his earlier treatment of one of those categories. His concern is to account for an ambiguous area in Tennyson's style, somewhere between literal and figurative, where the usual labels such as metaphor and simile do not satisfactorily apply. Within this gray area Sinfleld distinguishes three linguistic operations: "displacement," "fantasy," and a combination of the two. In displacement the reader is impelled to transfer to a second object tonal qualities from a literal description of a first. Reading "Oenone," for example, we displace to the three goddesses the sexual vigor implied in the description of the lush vegetation amid which they appear. In fantasy the poet gives a literal report of a dream or hallucinatory state, which report stands in figurative relation to the rest of the poem. Sinfield finds this device</page><page sequence="43">JOSEPH SENDR Y / 283 effectively used in "Lucretius," but his simplest illustration is from "The Last Tournament." In that poem Tristram dreams that one Isolt has white hands, one red. In waking life the first loves purely, the second adulterously, an adultery that leads eventually to bloodshed. In Maud the two methods are combined. Tennyson reports the consciousness of a hallucinating speaker (fantasy), and that speaker describes his surroundings in terms that apply also to his own emotions (displacement). The result is a seeming dissolution of the boundaries between real and unreal, literal and figurative. Sinfield believes that in using these methods Tennyson stakes out an aesthetic position halfway to Symbolism. Like the Symbolists he lets images suggest rather than state meaning, but unlike them he retains statement and story as well. To provide himself a constant within which to discuss these stylistic variables, Sinfield restricts his analysis to those passages in Tennyson's poetry that contain erotic imagery. A second contribution by Sinfield, " 'That Which Is': The Platonic Indicative in In Memoriam XCV" (VP 14: 247-252), gives more evidence of the importance of language in current Tennyson studies. Here the grammar of one passage becomes the crux in a dispute involving fundamental questions about the interpretation of the poem. Sinfield's piece answers Harry Puckett's 1974 article "Subjunctive Imagination in In Memoriam" (VP 12: 97-124)- itself an excellent treatment of Tennyson's language- which argued that recurring subjunctives give a provisional quality to Tennyson's affirma- tions through most of the poem. The "indicative" of Sinfield's title specifies the grounds for his dissent: that the vision of XCV, which he takes to be an encounter with ultimate reality ("that which is"), puts an end to the poet's wavering. Thereafter the indicative supersedes the subjunctive as the dominant grammatical mood of the poem. He argues, moreover, that in the last portion of the elegy the subjunctive is so manipulated as to reinforce, not diminish, affirmation. Sinfield arrived at the "Platonic" of the title by way of the Eversley notes (with aid from Churton Collins); they gloss "that which is" as "Absolute Reality" in a Platonic sense. Augustine's Confessions (with an acknowledgment to Jerome H. Buckley) is mentioned as another possible source. I would agree with Sinfield that the vision of XCV reverses the whole movement of the poem. I might add that the controverted phrase could also be taken as an allusion to the Old Testament language by which God refers to Himself in Exodus (3.14): "I AM THAT I AM." Puckett indicates in a rejoinder (VP 14: 340) that he stands by his original reading. John D. Boyd contributes to the ongoing discussion of language patterns in the great elegy through his article, "The Principle of Analogy and the Immortality Question in Tennyson's In Memoriam" (UTQ 45: 123-138). Its focus on differentiations within a single figure puts it in roughly the same class as Sinfield's article on imagery. Besides describing the figure, however,</page><page sequence="44">284/ VICTORIAN POETRY Boyd undertakes to use it in showing the unity of the poem. Boyd's most subtle insights arise out of his identification of a special use of analogy in argumentation, one that lies between illustration of an assertion and compressed argument in support of the assertion. When the poet says in Section CXXIV, for instance, that he was like a child who, though crying, "knows his father near," he is illustrating a frame of mind but also supplying an implicit argument for the existence of a father (understood: God). Most of the study is devoted to a more expansive notion of analogy, not unlike the "corresponding planes" within the hierarchy of being that Tillyard distin- guished in The Elizabethan World Picture. Here the corresponding planes are graded variations on the theme of immortality, which Boyd takes to be the central theme of In Memoriam. There are three such planes: immortality as existence in the mind of the speaker through love and memory, as personal survival in a Christian sense after death, and as survival of the species. Analogy provides a means for articulating the extensive and diverse roles that this theme plays in Tennyson's poem. As an instrument for establishing the unity of the poem, however, it proves awkward. In one final stylistic investigation, "Tennyson's Landscapes of Time and a Reading of The Kraken' " (VP 14: 197-204), James D. Welch holds that the poet used landscape as an image of time and that he had two opposite ways of looking at time: one is static, repetitive, without goal, and associated with isolation; the other is dynamic, non-repetitive, purposive, and associated with human community. By analyzing passages of "Mariana in the South" (static), "Move Eastward, Happy Earth" (dynamic), and "The Dying Swan" (static, then dynamic), Welch links the opposing images of time with characteristic ways of using language. He then applies his results to "The Kraken," which he reads as an embodiment of Tennyson's deepest feelings about time. The kind of analysis that Welch performs recalls Shaw's practice of describing the interplay of patterns within a poem. The closed, static quality of the kraken's undersea world is traced through dislocated syntax, retarded rhythm, and an emphasis on spatial relationships. Accumulated tension is then released in the dynamism of the closing lines, where tenses shift, spatial gives way to temporal imagery, and normal syntactic order is observed. A second book to appear on our poet during 1976- non-stylistic in its orientation- is Paul Turner's Tennyson, published in the Author Guides series of Routledge and Kegan Paul. As B. C. Southam, general editor, explains in his preface, the series is directed to non-specialists and is designed to highlight "the social and historical context of the writer's life and times, and the cultural and intellectual tradition in which he stands." If they contain no surprises, Turner's opening chapters on Tennyson's age and biography are succinctly informative. More information on the age is woven into the</page><page sequence="45">JOSEPH SENDRY I 285 succeeding chapters, which follow the main phases of the poet's career. Many of the topics are familiar: the status of women in The Princess, science there and in In Memoriam, adulteration of food and Crimean War politics in Maud. Others are unexpected: a suggestion that in "Ulysses" the metaphor of the "arch wherethrough / Gleams that untravelled world" was inspired by a tunnel on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway or that in "Guinevere" Tennyson was reacting to changes in Victorian divorce laws. On the familiar matters Turner achieves freshness by including overlooked details and by skillful use of background material to highlight the foreground of a text. His introduction of unexpected historical data, on the other hand, can become strained, as when he proposes Florence Nightingale as the model for Elaine in the Idylls (both took care of wounded warriors). Turner's main interest appears to lie much less in the social and political world that his subject inhabited than in the literary tradition that the poet inherited. The most valuable contribution of the book lies in its treatment of Tennyson's debt to the classics. Chiefly in the Eversley notes (now incorporated into the Ricks edition) the poet himself identified many of his borrowings from the ancients, and commentators have pointed to others. In many such cases Turner uses his knowledge of an ancient source to spell out its literary significance in a Victorian context. The author himself identifies classical sources for a number of passages, but since the book does not include notes, the reader cannot be sure which attributions of influence are original and which are not. Homer is the name encountered most often. Turner believes, for example, that the Iliad, not Lucretius, is the main inspiration for Tennyson's portrayal of the gods in the revised ending of "The Lotos Eaters"; he pinpoints some noteworthy Homeric (and other classical) echoes in "Ulysses"; and he rescues the ending of Enoch Arden from its long disrepute by taking it as an allusion to the last line of the Iliad. His discussion of the way in which contemporary views of Homer helped to shape Tennyson's view of genre in the Idylls is especially illuminating. Moving to other ancient writers, Turner sees the Ovid of the Heroides standing behind a whole class of forsaken females in Tennyson's early work, and Theocritus' presence is felt as strongly as that of Virgil or Horace. Apart from the classics Turner is alert to finding inspiration for Tennyson's work in Dante, earlier English poets, and even the novel. One might with fairness complain that he is too alert, for many of the texts that he affirms positively to be sources might better be termed analogues. Nor does he seem sufficiently aware that to discover its source, or even to explain the way in which sources are transformed in their new environment, is scarcely to render an adequate account of a poem. Especially with Tennyson's longer poems, overzealousness in enumerating literary models (at</page><page sequence="46">286 / VICTORIAN POETRY the expense of discussing more general features) lessens the usefulness of the study as an introduction for the general reader. All things considered, non-specialists will find Turner's Tennyson abundantly informative, usually reliable, and always readable. Specialists will be well advised to check him (along with Mustard, Bush, and the Ricks notes) on matters relating to Tennyson and the classics. One such matter, Tennyson's differing interpretations of the same classical theme through a series of rewritings, provides the subject of David F. Goslee's article "Three Stages of Tennyson's 'Tiresias' " (JEGP15: 154-167). The manuscripts show that two versions of the Tiresias story were written in 1833, one before and one after Hallam's death. The third dates from 1883, the poet's old age. In Goslee's reading Tennyson's successive interpretations of the myth are founded on the poet's own- mainly psychological- concerns at the time of each writing. These were a guilt-induced nostalgia for lost innocence at the first stage, a longing for his own death (brought on by the loss of Hallam) at the second, and a sense of estrangement from society and the cosmos at the third. These concerns govern in turn the relation in which the poet stands to his hero: Tennyson first uses the prophet as his spokesman, then identifies alternately with him and with the young Menoeceus, and at last gives him autonomy. Goslee effectively points out the major differences among Tennyson's three versions of the Tiresias myth and describes the general character of each. His unusual point of entry into the poetry leads to some worthwhile insights. In the third stage, for example, Menoeceus' self-sacrifice promises to win for Tiresias a reconciliation with his society and with the gods. Goslee points out that this is precisely the kind of redemptive reconciliation for which the poet would have sought. In the long run, however, the author's reliance on a complicated set of psychological specula- tions leaves the argument as a whole open to serious question. Along with style and classical subjects Tennyson's political verse drew special notice during 1976, chiefly in three articles published in these pages. Margery Strieker Durham ("Tennyson's Wellington Ode and the Cosmology of Love," VP 14: 277-292) and Elizabeth Francis ("Tennyson's Political Poetry, 1852-1855," VP 14: 113-123) discover redeeming interest in work admittedly flawed by chauvinist sentiment. For Durham the Wellington Ode and for Francis "The Charge of the Light Brigade" make most poetic sense when read as utterances by which the Laureate summoned the British people to join in rituals celebrating or defending national values. Francis links the shrill pseudonymous newspaper pieces that Tennyson wrote in the early 1850's alerting his countrymen to the danger of French invasion with apocalyptic and prophetic strains dormant in his verse since Poems by Two Brothers in the later 1820's. Her informative discussion serves as a good preface to F. J. Sypher's more wide ranging essay "Politics in the Poetry of</page><page sequence="47">JOSEPH SENDR 7/287 Tennyson" (VP 14: 101-112). Sypher's Tennyson saw history as apocalypse without the millenium promised by Christianity. With reason powerless to resist inevitable cataclysm the poet looks elsewhere for answers: to the "I have felt" of In Memoriam and to action, particularly military action, in Maud and the Idylls. Given these premises, the newspaper verse of the 1850's with its peremptory call to action against the French is of a piece with Tennyson's major poetry. Summary can hardly do justice to an article like Sypher's, where no word is wasted. As a masterly condensation of underlying themes from a large part of the Tennyson canon, it is among the year's finest studies. Finally, it would be impossible to ignore Harold Bloom's chapter "Tennyson: in the Shadow of Keats" from Poetry and Repression , the latest of four books in which Bloom develops his theory of poetic "misreading." Since the chapter is embedded in a highly complex volume and within an elaborate conceptual system beyond that, it would be equally impossible to treat the argument intelligibly in the space available here. In the most general terms Bloom is concerned with Tennyson's relation to his poetic pre- decessors, primarily- as the chapter title indicates- with Keats. The poems he subjects to scrutiny are "Mariana," "The Hesperides," "Ulysses," "Tithonus," "Tears, Idle Tears," and a passage from "The Holy Grail." Each is seen as an expression of the poet's "belatedness," his plight of having arrived late in literary history and of having to struggle against the consciousness of the debt that he owes to his precursors. Further discussion is, in fact, unnecessary in light of the excellent review article that James R. Kincaid published in this journal (14: 365-382), "Antithetical Criticism, Harold Bloom, and Victorian Poetry." Kincaid provides cogent exposition and balanced criticism of Bloom's controversial position as it is developed in all four books, and he ends by commenting (now enthusiastically) on the chapter on Tennyson in the last. In my capsule judgment, the chapter tells more about the critic than it does about the poet. Professor Shaw and Professor Bloom stand at opposite ends of this survey, and at times the methodological ground on which they stand is as far apart. But they (and, I should think, most if not all of the other scholars discussed here) meet at one point, what Bloom calls "the magnificence of Tennyson's style." Yet for all the work on this subject in 1976 and previous years, much territory remains uncharted. Shaw's book, for example, concentrates on the peaks and some of the more interesting foothills, leaving the plains for the most part unmapped. Other investigators have confined themselves either to individual tracts or to single features of a wider topography. Systematic surveys of whole areas in Tennyson's stylistic practice are therefore in order, particularly those of a carefully focused and fully detailed nature.</page><page sequence="48">288 / VICTORIAN POETRY Though all the results are not in, it is nonetheless clear that recent interest in style is having a significant impact on the fundamental revaluation of Tennyson that is now in progress. Stylistic analysis is providing new avenues into poems to which access has hitherto been difficult. The past year, for example, saw unusual attention paid (chiefly by Shaw but also by Sinfield) to Maud and "Lucretius" as prime exhibits of Tennyson's verbal artistry. Over the past decade Enoch Arden furnished what is possibly the most striking case of this kind. A pair of analyses, Martin Dodsworth's in 1971 and Priestley's in 1973, demonstrated considerable stylistic refinement in this possibly most despised among Tennyson's works. Last year Paul Turner saved what was effectively the last word in his book to hail Enoch Arden as "one of [the poet's] great artistic achievements." With Enoch Arden the discussion on Tennyson's style comes, in a sense, full circle. This is the poem that gave Bagehot his classic example of the Laureate's ornateness ("ocean spoil / In ocean smelling osier") and in so doing helped set the terms of the questions we are still debating. Whatever we may think of Enoch Arden- where Tennyson is concerned, these are among the basic questions.</page></plain_text>
