MINOS's TAIL TN Inf. V, 6-I2 we are told that the monstrous Minos, after he has heard and judged the sinners, sends them to their appointed places in Hell "secondo ch' avvinghia": which verb being not any too perspicu- ous here-it normally means "clasp," as Dante uses it in Inf. XXXIV, 70o--an immediate explanation is given: "Dico che . . . cignesi con la coda tante volte / quantunque gradi vuol che gilI sia messa." This explanation, as it happens, is not over-helpful; for, while cignere, modern cingere, normally means to "gird," "put round the waist," like a belt (cintura), it also had a meaning-found in Ariosto, for example--cor- responding to the noun cigna, "belt" or "strap"; and these two English words when used as verbs (the former rather slangily) give this alterna- tive sense. So that, while expositors in general have taken the former meaning for 'cignesi' in our passage, and therefore also for 'avvinghia,' a few2 have interpreted that Minos "lashed," "struck" himself with his tail, rather than coiled it from one to nine times about him. Another reference to Minos's famous tail, Inf. XXVII, 124-25, may help in deciding the question as to its modus operandi, as well as its length: in this passage Guido da Montefeltro says that Minos "attorse / otto volte la coda al dosso duro"; after which, in his rage, he bit it- that is, the tail. Now the Latin verb attorquere, background of Italian attorcere, which is found in Aeneid IX, 52,3 meant "hurl upward," "swing upward"-a meaning that would excellently well fit in the case of Dante's "attorse . . . la coda al dosso." Combining this with the two 1" . . il collo li avvinghiai." 2 E.g., Mazzoni; and, somewhat dubiously, Passerini and Vittorio Rossi. 3 And only there.</page><page sequence="2">2 ITALICA verbs in Canto V which describe the operation: "avvinghia" and "ci- gnesi," it seems fairly clear that Dante conceived of the caudal gesture of Minos as consisting of an upward sweep of a tail long enough to lash at least far enough round his body to leave a loose end over the shoulder, or near it, for him to bite! That great percentage of commen- tators who hold that the tail was long enough to enwrap Minos's body nine times at once if need be have evidently not estimated the magni- tude of such a prodigious appendage. Dante doubtless pictured Minos to himself as being of "heroic size"; but even not so considering him, the total length would hardly be less than fifty feet; and for "heroic size" it would be more like a hundred-which might be an unhandy distance to have to keep the confessing sinners away. A more serious difficulty, and one which most commentators also do not seem to have considered, is to imagine just how he would arrange with his tail when indicating a number relatively small--say two, or five: for naturally it would have to start its winding, or coiling, at the base. And, finally: the lashing of the tail, like the cracking of a whip, would be a very suitable signal for the disposal of the condemned: a type of signal familiar enough in those cruel ages.4 2. IN His HAPPY ASPECT One of the great mysteries of predestination, that of discrimination by the Creator among human souls, His creatures, though He loves them all, is stated by St. Bernard thus in Par. XXXII: "Creating all minds in His happy aspect (aspetto), at His pleasure He endows them diversely with Grace.""5 The phrase "in his happy aspect" is not immediately perspicuous; and commentators have apparently been a little puzzled as to just what angle to view it at. Almost invariably they center their attention on the adjective "happy" (lieto); and refer back to Purg. XVI, 88-90: "the simple little soul that knows nothing, save that, coming from a happy (lieto) Maker, it is fain to turn to whatever delights it."' This general idea, however, is clear enough; the real difficulty is in "aspetto," whose exact meaning in this context seems to elude one. The solution is found rather in that famous chapter on generation 4 It may be noted, by the way, that Servius, ad Aen. VI, 432, refers to Minos as a cruel judge: " ... notandum quia Minoem quasi crudelem introducit, quod ei epitheton et Plato et Homerus dat: nam Aeacus et Rhadamanthus fratres mitiores sunt." 5 Verses 64-66: "le menti tutte nel suo lieto aspetto / creando, a suo piacer di grazia dota / diversamente." 6 "I'anima semplicetta che sa nulla, / salvo che, mossa da lieto fattore, / volen- tier torna a ci6 che la trastulla."</page><page sequence="3">THREE DANTE NOTES 3 and the creation of the human soul, in Purg. XXV, and specifically in the terzina of vss. 70-72 (to which, for some unaccountable reason, no ex- positor seems to have appealed): so soon as the embryo has reached the stage where the brain is sufficiently developed, "the Prime Motor turns to it, happy (lieto) over so great a work of nature, and breathes a new spirit, full of potentialities.'"7 The picture of God the Creator, here, is more than merely anthropomorphic, it is positively paternal. His happy countenance turns to, and bends over, the new creature; and from His smiling lips comes the breath that implants in it the immortal soul! "Creating all minds in his happy aspect" becomes thus as clearly out- lined as in a sketch drawn by some pious mediaeval designer, to illus- trate the first chapter of Genesis. Not only is the epithet "happy" (lieto) still further illuminated, but "aspetto" stands out free from all obscurity or ambiguity: it is the benign countenance of the Creator, rejoicing in the creature of His making, at the moment of that joyous act.8 3. "CRYSTAL" IN DANTE'S USAGE The ancients and the mediaevals, perhaps not too unnaturally, be- lieved rock-crystal to be formed by petrifaction of ice or snow; and, as is well known, the word "crystal," which is originally Greek, comes from a root meaning "cold," and to the Greeks meant both "ice" and "rock-crystal." In Latin, crystallum (or crystallus) was used rather in- frequently for "ice"-excepting as a metaphor-;9 and it gained wide vogue in the mineralogical sense among the encyclopedists and compilers of "lapidaries." It seems to me extremely probable that by cristallo Dante always meant definitely the stone which we call "quartz" or "rock-crystal." He uses the noun cristallo five times. One of the occurrences has a context which forms of the whole a simile which is definite, climactic, and ef- fective, only when the word is so understood; it is Par. XXIX, 25-26: "E come in vetro, in ambra od in cristallo / raggio risplende ... " Ven- 7"lo motor primo a lui si volge lieto / sovra tant' arte di natura, e spira / spirito novo, di verti' repleto." s This Purg. XXV, 70, is often made a cross-reference to Purg. XVI, 89, and vice versa; but curiously enough the direct bearing on our passage from Par. XXXII seems to have been overlooked by commentators. 9 In the Vulgate Bible, even where the meaning "ice" seems at first sight clearly indicated it is quite possible that the real intention may not seldom have been to use it as referring to the mineral, in a metaphor for "ice." At least it is certain that the Middle Ages at times so conceived it; Uguiccione da Pisa, for example, in his section on "Cristallus," which he defines only as the mineral, quotes as apposite Psalm CXLVII, 17: "Hec Cristallus, -li, genus est candidi lapidis, quia nix sit glacie durata per annos. Unde et greci ei nomen dederunt; et dicebant antiqui hoc cristallum. Unde psalmista: 'Mittit cristallum suum' . . . "</page><page sequence="4">4 ITALICA turi, Le similitudini dantesche, seems singularly ineffective here (No. 158): "Avendo detto 'vetro, ambra o cristallo' " ["non" is evidently omitted at this point] "e a credere che Dante annettesse a cotesta voce l'idea stessa del vetro,10 che sarebbe ripetizione insolita; ma intendesse per Cristallo un corpo lucido in genere, conforme abbiamo veduto altrove: 'Si che se il Cancro avesse un tal cristallo' [Similit. 4Ia].1 (There Venturi says only: "Cristallo, per estensione, Corpo lucido.") The phrase "corpo lucido in genere" is repeated from this comment, or paraphrased, even by two or three of the foremost modern expositors. In two other passages Dante uses cristallo as a metaphor to desig- nate: (i) the planet Saturn: (Par. XXI, 25 ff.) "Dentro al cristallo che '1 vocabol porta, / cerchiando il mondo, del suo caro duce / sotto cui giacque ogni malizia morta, ... "; (2) a hypothetical star as bright as the sun (the passage referred to by Venturi in the quotation above): (Par. XXV, ioi f.) " . .. se '1 Cancro avesse un tal cristallo, / l'inverno avrebbe un mese d'un sol di." Thought of in these passages as meaning the gem, "crystal," the figure is forceful and beautiful; taken in an indefinite or general sense it is weak. In one case where Dante uses the noun cristallo, and another, the adjective cristallino, he is evidently referring specifically to the process by which quartz was supposed to be formed out of congealed snow, and ice. The former (Rime LXXIII, 4) refers to the frozen north with the words: "ove si fa '1 cristallo in quel paese"; and the other reads: (Rime CII, 25 ff.) "Segnor, tu sai che per algente freddo / l'acqua di- venta cristallina petra / 1l sotto tramontana ov' " il gran freddo."11 Finally: the phrase in Inf. XXXIII, 98, where the frozen tears that fill the eyesockets of the traitors are compared to vizors of "cristallo," suggests helmets in which the eyes of the wearer should be protected by transparent insets of crystal instead of having the familiar types of vizors pierced with slits or holes. Whether Dante knew of the existence of such vizors, or merely conceived of them as possible, the simile is, at any rate, a stroke of genius: " . .. le lagrime prime fanno groppo, / e si come visiere di cristallo, / riempion sotto '1 ciglio tutto il coppo."12 University of Southern California H. D. AUSTIN 10 The idea that by cristallo Dante could ever have meant "glass" is unwarranted; since flint, or other, glass was not called "crystal" until long after his time. Scartazzini's Enciclopedia dantesca is quite misleading on this point. 11 Cf. D'Ovidio, Studii sulla Divina Commedia (Rome, 190o), p. 575. 12 Were there such vizors? It is tempting to think that Guillaume, in the Charroi de Nimes, meant such when he is made to say, describing the blow which led to his being nicknamed "au court nez": "de son brant nu me dona un colp tel / desor le helme, que oi a or gem6, / que le cristal en fist jus avaler"-for the location and the direction of the blow would fit the context very nicely. But rock crystal was evidently regularly used on helmets merely for ornament-as on Roland's</page><page sequence="5">THREE DANTE NOTES 5 horn (Ch. de Rol., vs. 2320)-; cf., e.g., "Flors et cristaus [du haume] il acravente jus," also from the Roland; and "Amont es haumes ofi luisent li cristal," from Ronc. (both quoted by Littr6, s.v. cristal). -A century after Dante, Cennino d'Andrea Cennini is found referring to "eyes of glass" in helmets (II libro dell'arte, ed. Thompson, Yale Univ. Press, 1932; p. 104, 1. 13 f.-in paragraph beginning: "Quando ti viene il chaso di fare alchuno cimieri o elmo dattorniero, o da rettori che abbino andare in signioria . . .
