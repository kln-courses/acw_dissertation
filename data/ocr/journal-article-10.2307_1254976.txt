<plain_text><page sequence="1">LORD AVEBURY ON MARRIAGE, TOTEMISM, AND RELIGION. BY A. LANG. LORD AVEBURY, like Yama the discoverer of Death, "opened a pathway unto many," by his book on Pre-historic Times (1865), followed (1870) by his Origin of Civilisation, Though written so long ago, and though concerned with anthropology, these books are still popular, like all that Lord Avebury writes. It was under Lord Avebury, Mr. E. B. Tylor, and Mr. J. F. M'Lennan that men began their anthropological studies. between 1870 and 1880. These teachers, naturally, were not agreed on many points which still divide us. Amongst these the most serious are the questions, "What was the social condition of man before the evolution of the various restrictions on marriage connected with Totemism and Exogamy; and how were Totemism and Exogamy evolved "? Again, "By what earliest steps did man attain to religious beliefs "? My own "early views" have been and must continue to be modified by fresh discoveries and new reflections. Lord Avebury, on the other hand, in his Marriage,, Totemism, and Religion. An Answer to Critics (Longmans, 191 I), abides, on the whole, by the conclusions of his book of 1870, and thinks that they "have received additional support from the evidence which has since accumulated" (p. vii).</page><page sequence="2">Marriage, Totemism, and Religion. In criticising his views, I took them, in 1903, from the sixth edition of his Origin of Civilisation, published in g9o2.1 Lord Avebury's terms, in I902, retained the per- plexing use of "tribe," "class," "gens," and "sept," and the "tribe," as far as I could understand, seemed now to be envisaged as a fairly large, and again as a very small, com- munity. "Family names" appeared to be synonymous with names of totem-kins, and people of the same " family name " to " belong therefore to the same tribe." "Family," "gens," "class," "clan," and "tribe" were, as far as I could perceive, sometimes used as equivalent terms. It would be easy for Lord Avebury to define his terms and use them consistently, but, in his new work, as we shall see, he retains the indefinite terms, which make it hard to interpret his meaning. It is certain that his views about a pristine kinless state of " communal marriage," (that is, of no marriage, of no "exclusive relations" of any man or men with any woman or women), are accepted by several of the leading modern explorers and theorists, such as Messrs. Howitt, Spencer, and Gillen, and, (if I succeed in understanding him), by Mr. Frazer. On the other hand, with Mr. Darwin, Mr. N. W. Thomas, Dr. Starcke, Mr. E. B. Tylor, and others, (I cite Mr. Tylor from his Anthropology, a work of I88I), I do not believe that, in a primal stage, men and women lived without "exclusive relations" between each other; do not believe in a primal state of "communal marriage," or sexual promiscuity, in which no ideas of consanguineous or other kinship existed. Yet, while differing from Lord Avebury on this point, I agree with him, as against Messrs. Spencer, Howitt, and Frazer, in holding that the common form of tribal exoga- mous division into two exogamous and intermarrying sets or phratries is not the result of a conscious human effort to improve morals, or to avert any form of supposed danger to the eugenics of the tribe. Lord Avebury and I are at 1 See Social Origins, pp. 122-130. 403</page><page sequence="3">Lord Avebury on Marriage, one in holding that the two phratries are not the result of a consciously devised segmentation of the tribe, but of the union into a tribe of two sets of people previously separate. As has been said, my opinions have often been modified, and I need scarcely dwell on Lord Avebury's criticism of views about totemism and exogamy which, since I903, I have publicly renounced. For example, I abandoned the idea that exogamy is a consequence of the general totemic taboo.2 A man of Lord Avebury's many and multifarious activities can scarcely be expected to be familiar with every contribution to scientific serials, and, as far as I observe, he never alludes to my Secret of the Totem (1905). I am not to defend positions which I no longer hold. As to the corner-stone of Lord Avebury's hypothesis, namely, the idea that human society began with a stage of sexual promiscuity, or communal marriage, I prefer the opinion of Mr. Darwin that man most probably " aborigin- ally lived in small communities, each [man] with a single wife, or, if powerful, with several, whom he jealously guarded against all other men. Or he may not have been a social animal, and yet have lived with several wives like the gorilla," in whose band "but one adult male is seen." In either case there was no " communal marriage,"-according to Darwin. Lord Avebury objects that it would be diffi- cult for a species so solitary and unsocial, (in the second alternative), "to make any real progress." No doubt it would. It is always very difficult "to make real progress " -in the right direction. Lord Avebury proceeds,-" Mr. Darwin himself appears to have felt the difficulty, for it will be observed that he offers an alternative: "Or he may have been a social animal and yet have lived with several wives, like the gorilla." Mr. Darwin, in fact, wrote "Or he may not have been a social animal," etc.3 Mr. Darwin offered two alternatives, (i) man social, and 2 Man, I906, pp. I30 et seq., "The Totem Tabu and Exogamy." 3Cf. Descent of Man, vol. ii., p. 361 (I87I); Avebury, pp. 15-17. 404</page><page sequence="4">Totemism, and Religion. each man "jealously guarding his wives against all other men." (2) Man solitary, with his wives and offspring: no other adult male in his band. By neither Darwinian alter- native is "communal marriage" conceivably possible. I agree with Mr. Darwin, and Lord Avebury differs from him; hence our systems of explaining the actual marriage regula- tions of very backward races inevitably vary in inverse ratio to the square of the distance which divides our initial hypotheses. In mine, man began with individual families; in Lord Avebury's, man began with sexual promiscuity and with no consciousness of consanguineous kinship. Lord Avebury, again, is staunch to his idea of forty years ago that marriage originated in Capture. " If a man captured a woman belonging to another tribe," (my italics), "he thereby acquired an individual and peculiar right to her, and she became exclusively his property, no one else having any claim on or right over her." The women, in such a "tribe," would be (i) the native ladies, and (2) the captured brides. The captives would have the disadvantage of being, so to say, slaves, but each had the protection and affection of one man, her captor. The native women would be nominally free, but could refuse "the attentions" of no tribesman, and had no special claim on any man for food, shelter, and protection. Many of these women would like to be in the respectable and relatively secure position of the Brides of the Spear, whom I can imagine as already putting on airs of superior respectability; that they must have done. Again, many men would desire to have each a woman exclusively his own. That could be done, says our author, by men applying the right of capture even to women belonging to their own tribe.4 The original capture of a woman from an alien tribe might be, not vi et armis, but by wooing. By the word "tribe" Lord Avebury appears to mean a local tribe of considerable size. Such tribes are friendly Avebury, pp. 39-41. 405</page><page sequence="5">406 Lord Avebury on Marriage, among themselves. But, when men took to capturing women within their own tribe, the tribe would be broken up by internal blood-feuds. A tribe which practised, as a rule, capture of brides within the tribe would be weakened by internal dispeace. If Lord Avebury means that his tribes were " very small communities," capture within these would break them up entirely. Moreover, exogamy has nothing to do, in Australia, with marriage out of the local tribe. Choice in marriage is regulated, as M. Salomon Reinach objects,5 by " clan," (totem kin); or, more properly speaking, by phratry and matrimonial classes, where these exist. Lord Avebury "fails to understand" the objection of M. Reinach, but to myself it seems intelligible and valid. It is Lord Avebury's affair, I think, to show, step by step, how marriage by capture, out of the tribe, and marriage by capture, within the tribe, evolved the actual rules of marriage outside of the phratry, and, necessarily, out of the totem-kin. I do not find that Lord Avebury has followed the evolution step by step. He takes the case of the Buandik (formerly called Mount Gambier) tribe. Here the phratries, as is very common in South East and South West Australia, are named Black Cockatoo (Kumit) and White Cockatoo (Kroki). Mr. Howitt gives four totems confined to the former, and five different totems confined to the latter phratry. Each phratry has a totem-kin of its own name-giving fowl, Cockatoo, within it, as is usual. How does Lord Avebury explain these facts ? He does not attempt, here, to explain all of them. He postulates two original neighbouring tribes, one called White Cockatoo (Kroki), the other Black Cockatoo (Kumit).6 But where, in Australia, does he find tribes called by names of animals? Such names are held by many phratries, by many totem- kins, by some matrimonial classes, but not by tribes. How- ever, let it be so,-there were two small neighbouring 5 Avebury, p. 75. 6 He writes " Krumite."</page><page sequence="6">Totemzsm, and Religion. tribes, White and Black Cockatoos, each living in sexual promiscuity within itself, in "communal marriage." Black Cockatoo men now and then capture White Cockatoo women, and vice versd, captors having exclusive property in their brides. Finally, it would be the rule that no man might marry a woman of his own "tribe"; he must marry a woman of the other "tribe"; Kroki marries Kumit, Kumit weds Kroki. Then what becomes of the practice of capture by mar- riage within the tribe ? 7 By that rule any Black Cockatoo man could marry a Black Cockatoo woman. Kroki could marry Kroki, and Kumit could marry Kumit. But they dare not do so,-under punishment of death in older times. How does Lord Avebury reconcile the facts with his theory of legalised marriage within the tribe? If Lord Avebury means by " tribes " a number of small local communities of animal names, originally raiding each other for wives and finally forming two leagues each of so many animal-named groups, which two leagues coalesce as intermarrying phratries, then his theory is practically the same as my own. However, Lord Avebury has now, I think, reached the hypothesis that, in the case of the Buandik, exogamy began with a stage of "one totem to one totem marriage," as exemplified in the northern Urabunna, the Itchumundi, Karamundi, and some of the Barkinji.8 Though he is apparently unaware of the fact, I put forward a similar theory, "under all reserves," in "Australian Problems."9 But the Urabunna, Karamundi, Itchumundi, and Barkinji, though each of their totem-kins marries into only one other totem-kin, have phratries, each with several totem-kins, no totem-kin appearing in both phratries. The Buandik phratries, White and Black Cockatoo, also contain, each, four or five totem-kins. 7 Avebury, pp. 41, 42. 8 Howitt, The Native Tribes of South-East Australia, pp. I88, 189, I94. 9 Anthropological Essays presented to E. B. Tylor etc., pp. 203-218. 407</page><page sequence="7">Lord Avebury on Marriage, How does Lord Avebury explain the fact that, in the Buandik tribe, no one of the Ti-tree, Owl, and Root totems may marry a person of the Fish-hawk, Pelican, Crow, and Snake totem ? A hypothesis must colligate all the facts in the case.. Why are the phratries universally, (except in the Arunta and one or two other tribes where the variation is easily explained), so arranged that none may marry into their own totems, nor into several other totems ? This question carries us to Lord Avebury's theory of the origin of totems. " The children and followers of a man called the Bear or the Lion would make that a tribal name."10 Then is it Lord Avebury's theory that all per- sons called Black Cockatoo (Kumit) and White Cockatoo (Kroki), originally were descendants of the children or followers of two men, one named Black and the other White Cockatoo ? If so, Lord Avebury makes the Patri- archal system prior to Totemism! Such communities would not be tribes, but would exactly resemble Highland clans, "Sons of Wry Mouth," "Sons of Crook Nose,' (Campbells and Camerons). The Highland clans consist of the "children and followers" of this man or that, Ian or Donald, or The Servant of Christ, (Macgilchrist), and so on. Here we have the Patriarchal system, which could exist neither among the "kinless loons" of "communal marriage," nor under the system of female descent of the name, which Lord Avebury recognises as prior to male descent. Lord Avebury's theory of the origin of totemism here demands the existence of recognised families, children of this or that man; now this is the Patriarchal system. Again, Totemism "arose from the practice of naming, first individuals, and then their families, after particular animals." n Here a "family" is the family of an individual. 10Avebury, p. 97. 1 Avebury, p. 87. 408</page><page sequence="8">Totemism, and Religion. 409 "Communal marriage" could produce no such family of an individual. But, deserting his patriarchal theory of the origin of the totem-clan, Lord Avebury (p. 99) answers Mr. Fison's objec- tion to that theory,-if the name (Bear or Lion) "were first given to an individual, his family, i.e. his children, could not inherit it from him when descent is reckoned on the female side." To this Lord Avebury replies that, "there must, I submit, have been a still earlier stage " (than female descent of the name) "when children were not regarded as specially related either to the father or the mother, but only as part of the horde. Mr. Fison's . . . objection" (which is also Mr. Tylor's,) "therefore falls to the ground." Here I understand Lord Avebury to mean that he now conceives totemism to have arisen in his age of " communal marriage," when fathers and their children were unknown quantities. But he had previously declared that totemism arose out of the adoption by children of their father's animal name. Against that opinion of Lord Avebury, and not against the opinion that totemism began in an age of com- munal marriage, Mr. Fison was arguing. Therefore I must agree with Mr. Fison's and Mr. Tylor's objection. Their objection is to Lord Avebury's statements that " the children andfollowers of a man called the Bear or the Lion would make that a tribal name;" that totemism "arose from the practice of naming, first individuals, and then their families, after particular animals." 12 Lord Avebury cannot mean to tell us, first, that totemism arose from inheritance by families of the personal names of their fathers; and then that totemism arose when children were not regarded as related either to father or mother, "but only as part of the horde " (p. 99). If he adheres to his second theory, (and he still cites his first as a theory which he holds, pp. 87, 97), how did a "horde" acquire the hereditary name of " Bear" or " Lion "? '2Avebury, pp. 87, 97.</page><page sequence="9">Lord Avebury on Marriage, Lord Avebury seems to use "horde" and "family" as synonymous terms. "A man was first regarded as merely related to his family" (p. IoI). Children were "regarded only as part of the horde" (p. 99). I do not know what is meant by " family" (p. IoI). Lord Avebury uses the term to denote the children of "individuals " (p. 87), or of a " man" (p. 97). If a "horde," then, be a "family," and if a "family" be " the children of a man," where is communal marriage ? In place of "communal marriage" we have here the Patri- archal system, and full recognition of paternity. Lord Avebury, as far as I can understand him, offers at once two contradictory theories. In one, totemism arose in the inheritance by a man's children of his personal name, an animal name. By the other theory, totemism arose before any degrees of consanguinity were known. All members of a " horde " were called by the horde-name, Bear or Lion, -and why was the horde named Lion or Bear? Here Lord Avebury appears to have an answer, but it is not the answer that he gives, for example, on pp. 87, 97. In the new answer, children, families, and fathers are omitted. In the elder answer, they were essential. " My suggestion was," he says (p. 98), " that if a group was led by a man who had been named after an animal, the members of the group took the same name," Lion or Kangaroo. Here the term "group" supplants the terms "horde" and "' family," and the " father " of p. 97 becomes the " leader " of p. 98. Further reply, if I understand my author, is superfluous. Lord Avebury's theory of totemism is, as far as I can see, a combination of two contradictory hypotheses; thus it needs drastic modifications before it can be discussed with any profit. Moreover it does not explain the existence of totem-kins within each phratry whose members may not marry each other. No man or woman, say, of Frog totem, in phratry Crow, may marry a member of Crow, Snipe, Duck, Carpet Snake, Frog, or any other totem, within their 4IO</page><page sequence="10">Totemism, and Religion. own phratry. It does not appear that Lord Avebury tries to explain the origin of this arrangement. In all discussions we are so apt to misunderstand each other that I must express my regret if I misconceive Lord Avebury; when he seems to me to hold two contradictory theories,-one, that totemism arose in an age of recognised fatherhood, when children assumed hereditarily the animal name of their father; the other, that it arose when promis- cuous hordes assumed, for ever, the name of their leader in one generation; the next leader, of course, might have another name. This remark applies to all theories accord- ing to which the name of one man, woman, or leader becomes stereotyped as the name of a totem-kin, and as the origin of a totem. Why was one of many names of individuals stereotyped as a kin-name or a group-name, before male kinship was known? But such stereotyping is possible in much more advanced conditions, with full recognition of paternity, as in Mac- donalds, Mackays, Macfearchars (Farquharsons). Religion. Lord Avebury, some fifty years ago, "expressed the belief that the lowest races were without any belief which could be " called religion,'3 and he adheres to that opinion. Mr. Tylor, on the other hand, writes,-" Even in the life of the rudest savage religious belief is associated with intense emotion, with awful reverence, with agonizing terror, with rapt ecstasy when sense and thought utterly transcend the common level of daily life." 14 I never went so far as Mr. Tylor in this direction, I think. Thus Lord Avebury's opinion is not that of notre mattre a tons, nor of Dr. Roskoff in Das Religionswesen der Rohesten Naturvolker; nor is it my own opinion. Indeed, as Lord Avebury quotes me, I have said that Dr. Roskoff " con- 13 Avebury, p. 138. '4Primitive Culture, vol. ii., p. 359 (I873). 411</page><page sequence="11">Lord Avebury on Marriage, futed" Lord Avebury. I am happy to withdraw the saying, for by " religion " Dr. Roskoff means one thing, and Lord Avebury means another thing. Lord Avebury does not recognise as "religious" beliefs and usages which are religious in the opinion of his critics. All that we can do is to produce, in the most savage regions, beliefs and usages which most men will confess to be essentially religious; and if Lord Avebury still maintains that they are not, the question is left to the verdict of anthropologists,-judicet orbis terrarum. Here we are obliged, then, to define "religion," and in their definitions few people agree. Some may say that the minimum of religion is belief in non-personal power, Mana. Then a dispute arises as to whether Mana is or is not per- sonal. Perhaps I might describe an early minimum of religion as " the belief in and a measure of obedience to a potent being or beings, not ourselves." But, if I take that line, Lord Avebury meets me with " I have never denied that the fear of ghosts, fairies, demons, genii, and Nature- spirits, of the Ariels, Nixies, Brownies, etc., is found every- where among existing savages." (I wish I could find a savage Brownie !) "They are beings differing from living men, but are not gods, nor are they worshipped."15 Yet we have endless examples of prayers to and propitiation of Nature-spirits and ghosts. To Lord Avebury nothing is religious except a god, and a worshipped god. Where do the Saints come in ? Therefore we have to ask, what is the definition of a " god," what is the definition of " worship," and can no being who is not worshipped be styled a"god"? For my part, though I spoke of " high gods of low races" in The Making of Religion (I898) I am. now very shy of the use of the word "god " in this connection,-as it seems to be unacceptable,-and I often prefer, following Mr. Howitt, to say, not "god " but "All Father." Nevertheless I firmly believe that the belief in the All Father is the germ of the 15 Avebury, p. I41. 41 2</page><page sequence="12">Totemism, and Religion. belief in a God who receives worship, and more than the germ. In this, as in almost everything except two points, I follow Mr. Tylor,-" The figure of the supreme deity, be he Heaven-god, Sun-god, Great Spirit, beginning already in savage thought to take the form and function of a divine ruler of the world, represents a conception which it becomes the age-long work of systematic theology to develope and define."16 On the other hand Mr. Howitt writes,-" it may be said that their beliefs," (the beliefs of "these aborigines") "are such that, under favourable conditions, they might have developed into an actual religion, based on the worship of Mungan-ngaua or Baiame."'7 Mr. Howitt manifestly thought that religion cannot exist without worship and that his tribes exhibit no worship. Every man has his own definition, and I regard the belief in an All Father as religious in many cases. Thus I think that belief in, and obedience to the desires of, a creative being, dwelling above the heavens, is religious. Mr. Spencer discovers and describes,18 among the Kaitish of Central Australia,-a people who, as far as he tells us, are uncontaminated by missionary teaching,-a being, Atnatu, who "made himself," dwelling in other skies than ours, the Father of the Kaitish, who descend from rebellious sons of Atnatu. He sent them down to earth; he provided them with all that they have; he expects from them obedience to his injunctions in the affairs of the mysteries. This belief is religious, in my opinion. Lord Avebury says (p. 153) that "in the absence, how- ever, of prayers or thanksgiving, offerings or ceremonies, we may well doubt whether such a belief" (as I attribute to many Australian tribes) "really exists as a living faith." Yet he knows from Mr. Spencer's and Mr. 16Primitive Culture, vol. ii., p. 355. 17 The Native Tribes of South-East Australia, p. 507. 18 The Northern Tribes of Central Australia, pp. 498, 499. 413</page><page sequence="13">Lord Avebury on Marriage, Howitt's evidence that ceremonies are done in obedience to the supposed commands of Atnatu, Baiame, Mungan- ngaua, Daramulun, and so on; while Baiame, we shall see, was " worshipped with songs" before any missionaries arrived among the worshippers. Why is this not "a living faith"? If singing of hymns be a form of worship, Mrs. Langloh Parker publishes the hymn to Baiame.19 Like the Latin hymns of the Church in a rural congregation, the Baiame hymn is so old that it is now unintelligible to the singers. "No one now knew the meaning of the whole, not even the oldest wzirreenuns." The same author mentions "the prayer of the oldest wirreenun to Byamee, asking him to let the blacks live long, for they have been faithful to his charge as shown by the observance of the Boorah ceremony " from which women and children are excluded. The tribe believed in, and had a sense of awe for, and of dependence on, an All Father, Baiame, to whose decrees they conformed, to whom, on two occasions only, they prayed, and who received the souls of some of them, at least, unto his own place. Lord Avebury must be almost alone in his theory, if he denies that here we have religion. That Baiame is not a spirit, but a being suigeneris, and that absurd myths are told of him, as of Zeus, does not destroy the religious nature of the belief in him, any more than the religious nature of the belief in Zeus is destroyed. Mr. Howitt says "There is not any worship of Dara- mulun; but the dances round the figure of clay and the invocating of his name by the medicine-men certainly might have led up to it."20 Now, if the Athenian maidens danced round an image of Artemis Brauronia, and invocated her name, I should call that "worship." Lord Avebury no doubt would not. Mr. Howitt shows religious obedience to "that great Biamban" (Master)" whom you know about," among the 414 19 The Euahlayi Tribe, pp. 79, 80. 20 OP. cit., pp. 507, 5o8.</page><page sequence="14">Totemism, and Religion. Yuin. The name of the being is not taken in vain. Mr. Howitt spoke to Yuin friends of "that great one," (pointing upwards), "who ordered your fathers to hold the Kuringal, and to make your boys into men." "The men looked at it," (at the mudthi displayed to them by Mr. Howitt), "with every appearance of awe."21 If sacred awe of and obedience to "that great one above" be not religious, what is ? Does Lord Avebury seriously deny that here we have religion ? Perhaps he does not quite deny it, for he now shifts his ground (p. i6I). He takes up, if I follow his meaning, the old theory that anything which critics cannot easily deny to be religion, (such as the awe which the Yuin pay, and the obedience which they yield to " that great one" whose Name they scruple to utter), is borrowed from Christian missionaries, in Australia. This theory I have disproved several times by arguments of which Lord Avebury takes no notice. For example, Lord Avebury quotes (p. 162), as to Baiame and the sup- posed attributes borrowed by him from missionaries, Mr. Tylor's criticisms.22 Now I proved, on Mr. Tylor's own evidence that Baiame was "worshipped with songs," (and worship is the essential thing with Lord Avebury), "when the missionaries first came to Wellington" (circ. 1831).23 In "The Theory of Loan Gods" in my Magic and Religion, I examined Mr. Tylor's arguments and evidence in full detail. Lord Avebury has overlooked my facts and arguments. Mr. Tylor, (whom Lord Avebury cites from Mr. Hartland), wrote "the evidence points rather, in my opinion, to Baiame being the missionary translation of the word Creator, used in Scripture lesson-books for God."24 But as, by Mr. Tylor's own evidence, that of Mr. Hale (circ. I840-1842) quoting Mr. Threlkeld, a very early missionary, Baiame was in full force 21 0p. cit., pp. 517, 5I8.

Mr. Ridley's Gurri Kami- laroi, I856,-(my copy I gave to Mr. Tylor), -the ingenious conjecture of the great anthropologist is erroneous. Lord Avebury writes (p. I63),-"Mr. Lang may challenge (Mr. Tylor's) opinion as that of an anthropologist, however distinguished, whose theories a large part of his book is occupied with controverting." I don't "challenge,"-I prove my case. If Hale's mention of Baiame "in the year I840" be "the earliest," his mention avers that Baiame was being worshipped when the missionaries arrived at Wellington. Consequently Baiame is not a word coined by a missionary in 1856. As to my challenging Mr. Tylor's theories, my own are due to his great book, though mine are, in one or two points, modifications of those of our leader. The chief modification is this:-Like Mr. Howitt, and before Mr. Howitt, I saw and said that the superior being of most savage religions is not envisaged by his people as a "spirit," but simply as an anthropomorphic wesen. Thus his origin is not " animistic." Here I part company with Mr. Tylor. Secondly, I entirely agree with Mr. Tylor when he asks "Among low tribes who have been in contact with Christianity or Mohammedanism, how are we to tell to what extent, under this foreign influence, dim uncouth notions of divine supremacy may have been developed into more cultured forms or wholly foreign ideas have been planted "?25 But I reply to the question, we must study each case critically by itself, remembering, in Mr. Tylor's words, "how closely allied are many ideas in the rude native theologies of savages to ideas holding an immemorial place in the religions of their civilised invaders."26 I maintain that, when such ideas of savages are reported by laymen before the arrival of missionaries, and when absence of European 416 25 Primitive Culture, vol. ii., p. 333. 26 Op. cit., p. 334.</page><page sequence="16">Totemism, and Religion. influence is proved by Mr. Howitt, for example, while the presence of missionaries is demonstrated to produce absolutely no effect on the native beliefs, then the hypothesis of borrowing cannot be logically held. I do not doubt that here Mr. Tylor would agree with a self- obvious conclusion. Lord Avebury writes,-(Mr. Lang's) " contention is that they" (the Australians), "or at least some tribes, believe in the existence of a deity named " Baiame," who is omni- scient, omnipotent, immortal, beneficent, and to whom the blessed name of "All-father" can fitly be attributed."27 As to "the blessed name of All Father" I adopt it from Mr. Howitt.28 I prefer the word " All Father" to "deity" or "god " in these cases, for reasons already given; though I use both "deity" and "god" in works written before I saw the advantages of Mr. Howitt's term. Next, as to my ascription of "omniscience," "omni- potence," and "immortality" to the superior beings of Australian tribes, and also the ascription of "creativeness," I explain29 that I use the word "creative" where our evidence asserts that the All Father "made all things." Sometimes he only made the earth and sky and other trifles of that sort; some other things "came otherwise." In these cases I prefer to call the All Father "a maker of things, or of some things." Where I have said "omnipre- sent" and "omnipotent," I have pointed out that "this is only a modern metaphysical rendering of the actual words attributed" (by Mr. Howitt) "to the savage: 'He can go everywhere and do everything'."30 I said "with these explanations I trust that my rhetorical use of such phrases as 'eternal,' 'creative,' 'omniscient,' 'omnipotent,' 'omnipresent,' and 'moral' may not be found to mislead, or covertly to import modern or Christian ideas into my 27Avebury, p.

This I said in 900o; in I9I Lord Avebury seems to be unaware of my explanation of my terms. He next advances to the theory of attributes of Austra- lian superior beings as borrowed from missionaries. But there is ample evidence, though Mr. Howitt's is enough,. to such unborrowed aborigirnal beliefs as that entertained by the Kurnai, who, when Mr. Howitt met them, had never seen a missionary. Later he met a converted Kurnai, but the man was not invited to, and knew nothing of the intention of the heathen Kurnai to hold, a Jeraeil, or initiation-ceremony. Mr. Howitt offers "the reasons which appear to me to prove conclusively the aboriginal origin of the belief in the All-father as I have given it." The elements in the belief which I deem religious did not filter down to the isolated Kurnai from blacks in contact with Christian influences, and the Kurnai "did not attend the ceremonies of any other tribe."31 Lord Avebury never alludes to these facts of Mr. Howitt. Moreover, says Mr. Howitt, in four tribes, Narrang-ga, Parnkalla, Dieri, and Arunta, "missionaries have long preached in the native tongue." The Narrang-ga and Parnkalla, and Dieri, are either extinct, or modernised. But the Arunta, a tribe whose southern section has energetic missionaries such as Mr. Strehlow, have no trace of an All Father in Mr. Spencer's region, and further south have only the shadow of the name of an All Father, known to the women. Thus Mr. Howitt32 argues that missionaries have not lent to the natives of the South East the higher elements of their belief, while, where the Arunta are in contact with active missionaries preaching in the Arunta language, there is either no All Father, or a shadow of an All Father, held in no reverence. Mr. Howitt's facts and logic are alike invincible. But 31 Op. cit., pp. 504-5. 2 Op. cit., pp. 504-6.</page><page sequence="18">Totemism, and Religion. when Lord Avebury, confronted with the higher and, (as I think), religious aspects of Australian belief, tries to escape by way of the old theory of borrowing from Christian sources, he overlooks Mr. Howitt's evidence, which is quite destructive of that theory in Mr. Howitt's region, and among the Arunta of Central Australia. Lord Avebury quotes Mr. Tylor, who, in Primitive Culture,33 declared that the theory of the borrowing of belief in "The Great Spirit" from missionaries "will not bear examination." I am not disposed to go so far; I do not doubt that there are places in which European has contaminated savage belief. Again, it is an old error,-as Mr. Howitt followed me in saying,-to think that the Australian All Father is conceived of as a "spirit." But, in I892, Mr. Tylor34 argued, contrary to his previous opinion, that certain North American and other tribes borrowed "The Great Manitou," "The Great Spirit," from the Jesuits, and so on in certain other cases. Thus argued Mr. Tylor in I892, but, in an edition of his Primitive Culture of the previous year (I891), he published, as in previous editions, the evidence for American All Fathers, (if I may not say gods), discovered and reported on before the arrival of any missionaries, and of such beings found in situ by the Jesuits on their arrival in America. There is Heriot's chief and creative being in 1586; there is Strachey's Ahone in 1612. According to Winslow (1622) the belief in an All Father, Kiehtan, maker of all other gods, and of man, was in New England an article of faith from unknown antiquity; Kiehtan was worshipped with feasts and songs and prayers. In 1633, P6re Le Jeune, S.J., being asked by an Indian, " What is God ?" answered " He made all things, heaven and earth." They then began to cry out to each other, "Atahocan ! Atahocan ! it is Atahocan." 33Vol. ii., pp. 339-40 (I873); Avebury, pp. I6I, 162. 3 The Journal of the Anthropological Institute etc., vol xxi., pp. 284-5. 419</page><page sequence="19">Lord Avebury on Marriage, As Mr. Tylor published this evidence in 1891, I do not, I admit, understand how, in 1892, he came to assert, in such measure as he did, the Theory of Borrowing. Borrow- ing may, and I doubt not does, occur in places, but we cannot invoke borrowing when the beliefs are found, (Mr. Tylor gives the evidence), prior to the arrival of mission- aries; or are discovered in active existence by missionaries when they arrive. To these facts, which would be accepted in any Court of Justice, Mr. Tylor, as far as I am aware, has never replied, nor are they noticed by Lord Avebury. Moreover, missionary beliefs, among the Arunta, Kaitish, and so on, do not crystallize round Atnatu of the Kaitish, or round the neglected All Father of the Southern Arunta, who are missionary-ridden. Here we have Lord Avebury's supposed cause of high elements in beliefs,-the mission- aries,-without the alleged effect: as among the Kurnai we have the alleged effect without Lord Avebury's supposed cause,-the missionaries. Thus it is certain, if we accept Mr. Howitt's authority, that the higher elements of Australian belief were not borrowed from missionaries, and, (see Mr. Hale), that Baiame, whatever his mythical eccentricities, was wor- shipped by tribes near Wellington before the date of first arrival of the missionaries. If more facts and arguments are needed, (i) the women and children of Australian tribes were not allowed to know about the existence and attributes of the All Father, whatever his local name. Now, if the higher attributes were drawn from missionary teaching, the women and children would know as much about them as the Initiates. But they did not know. (2) If the higher attributes of the All Father were borrowed from pious Christians continually engaged in acts of public worship, the adults of the tribes ought to have borrowed the worship with the doctrines. But, according to Lord Avebury, the Australian All Father receives no worship. I am ashamed to say how often I 420</page><page sequence="20">Totemism, and Religion. have published these and other arguments in refutation of the Theory of Borrowing, in the cases indicated. Perhaps my most complete statements are in " The Theory of Loan Gods," and the Appendix in Magic and Religion. As to the death of Daramulun, in a Wiraijuri myth, as an argument against his immortality,35 Lord Avebury seems to be unaware that, among the Wiraijuri, Daramulun is not the All Father, but a subordinate of his ;-destroyed by him, in one myth; going strong in others.6 The three diverse positions of Daramulun are these:- I. Coast Murring. Daramulun is supreme.37 2. Wiraijuri. Daramulun is a subordinate of Baiame, and, in one myth, Baiame punished him by extinction.38 3. Kamilaroi. Daramulun is to Baiame what Apollo was to Zeus, a kind of " mediator." There seems to have been an overlap of tribal beliefs. As to absence of worship, where the belief is unaccom- panied by worship, I explain it 3 by reasons which Lord Avebury quotes.40 Mr. Tylor gives the same reasons as myself in a quotation from Bowditch on the Yoruba.41 "No sacrifices are made to God " (Olorung, the Lord of Heaven) "because he needs nothing, but the Orisas" (minor beings) "being much like men, are pleased with offerings of sheep, pigeons, and other things." Mr. Tylor writes of "an unshaped divine entity . .. too benevolent or too exalted to need human worship . .. this is a mystic form of formless- ness in which savage and barbaric tribes have not seldom pictured the Supreme." 42 Meanwhile, where such belief in what Mr. Tylor terms "the Supreme" exists, we constantly find that ancestral 85 Avebury, p. x66.

My book is full of evidence to this effect, and so is Primitive Culture. " Mr. Lang's theory seems most improb- able," says Lord Avebury, "and can only be supported by the strongest evidence for the facts " (p. I60). The evidence is good enough for Mr. Tylor, and, if it is not good enough for Lord Avebury, he must criticise the testimony in each case. He says that there is contradiction and inconsistency in the statement that men " believe in a supernatural being but make no attempt to secure his protection and assistance." This is exactly the attitude of a Samoyede quoted by Mr. Abercromby,-" I cannot approach N um, he is too far away; if I could reach him I should not beseech thee" (a spirit to whom he is praying), " but should go myself, but I cannot." 43 One main object of my Making of Religion was to show how very common in savage religion is this attitude,-how often we meet the highest,-may I say " god " ?-who is not addressed in prayer. The importance of a religious concep- tion so strange to the European mind is very great, and, as far as I am aware, (except by Mr. Tylor in Primitive Culture), the point had been universally neglected. But new examples of this creed keep pouring in from every quarter, and it is becoming impossible to ignore the evidence. I am glad to take this opportunity of sheltering myself behind the tower-like shield of the Telemonian Aias, the author of Primitive Culture. My sole difference from him is inability to see that "the Supreme" of many savage religions is "animistic," is spiritual; and in my opinion, (which I think he would not contest), the Theory of Borrow- ing in many cases is ineffectual,-in others there has certainly been borrowing. Manifestly this controversy is caused, to a great extent, by the variety of definitions of words like "god," "worship," "religion," "creator," and so on. Thus Lord Avebury '3 The Pre- and Prbto-historic Finns, vol. i., p. 153. 422</page><page sequence="22">Totemism, and Religion. 423 quotes Mr. Eyre, Expeditions into Central Australia, vol. ii., pp. 355-358, to the effect that " the natives of New Holland, as far as yet can be ascertained, have no religious belief or ceremonies. A Deity, or great First Cause, can hardly be said to be acknowledged . . . by this people, who ascribe the creation to very inefficient causes. They state that some things called themselves into existence and had the property of creating others." I do not wonder that these metaphysicians were guilty of a bull! A thing must be in existence before it can " call itself into existence." Theirs is a way of trying to understand " The Great First Cause, itself least understood." I don't suppose that Mr. Eyre understood the problem any better than the blacks did.44 Now I also quoted from the same pages of Mr. Eyre's book his discovery, among these very blacks, of Noorele "all powerful and of a benevolent character," who dwells with three unborn sons "up among the clouds." Noorele is credited with "the origin of creation"; "he made the earth, trees, water, etc." Yet, goes on Mr. Eyre, "a great First Cause can hardly be said to be acknowledged." I added "such are the consistent statements of Mr. Eyre." Lord Avebury omits the passages in Mr. Eyre's book which I cite. Mr. Eyre, of course, first reported, in his own terms, what the blacks told him in theirs,-that Noorele is "all powerful" (omnipotent) and "of a benevolent character," "'made earth, trees, water, etc.," and then Mr. Eyre, re- flecting on these views, added "a Deity, or great First Cause, can hardly be said to be acknowledged,"-obviously because he found no worship of the " benevolent all power- ful maker of earth and sky." Lord Avebury prefers Mr. Eyre's reasonings (logical as they are). I prefer to look at Mr. Eyre's statements, and to exhibit the nature of his reasoning. I give both positive statements and reasonings. We often meet examples of Mr. Eyre's kind of reasoning in works written before attempts were made to study savage 4 Avebury, pp. 171-2.</page><page sequence="23">Lord Avebury on Marriage, religion scientifically. Thus Lord Avebury (p. 207) quotes Thevet (I558), who says of a Canadian tribe "as to their religion, they have no worship or prayer to God.... For the rest, they fully believe there is a Creator . . . who holds all in his power." Lord Avebury calls these "inconsistent, and contradictory statements; belief in a Great Spirit, but not in a God; belief in a supernatural being, but no attempt to secure his protection and assistance" (p. 207). Now Thevet, as quoted, says nothing of a "Great Spirit"; he avoids "that misleading error" as Mr. Howitt terms it. My Making of Religion made an effort to clear that error out of our studies, except, of course, in any instances where an uncontaminated people describes its superior being as a "spirit." The term "Great Spirit" is almost always an European blunder. To conclude, it is a curious fact that Lord Avebury, for all that I can see, might easily agree with Mr. Tylor and myself, on the points where we hold the same opinions. Lord Avebury writes (p. 154),-"If he," (the savage) "is asked, or if he asks himself, who made the world, it is a simple explanation, however unsupported by evidence, that his ancestor or some other mysterious being did so; and then we are told that he believes in an all-powerful Creator!" Well, a mysterious being who made the world is a Creator, of no limited power. To make the world is "a large order." But let us take the case as Lord Avebury puts it,-it is my own case; as far as I can make a conjecture. I wrote (Making of Religion, p. x, 900o),-" As soon as man had the idea of 'making' things, he might conjecture as to a Maker of things which he himself had not made, and could not make. He would regard this unknown Maker as 'a magnified non-natural man'... This conception of a magnified non-natural man, who is a Maker, being given; his Power would be recognised, and fancy would clothe one who had made such useful things with certain other moral 424</page><page sequence="24">Totemism, and Religion. attributes, as of Fatherhood, goodness, and regard for the ethics of his children; these ethics having been developed naturally in the evolution of social life. In all this there is nothing.. as far as I can see, beyond the limited mental powers of any beings that deserve to be called human." This is only a guess, but, at all events, any savage who once con- ceived of a maker of the worldwould find his conception about a being so powerful expanding in the sense in which the All Father is undeniably envisaged by many tribes; and again the conception would fade with the rise of a vast theory of animism, and of evolution, as among the Northern Arunta. The earlier part of my book The Making of Religion was devoted to a study of certain world-wide beliefs, found in all ages and degrees of culture, compared with certain con- temporary evidence as to abnormal and supernormal experi- ences. Why anthropologists,-except Bastian in his Ueber psychische Beobachtungen bei Naturvilkern (I900),-should bury their heads in the sand and be blind themselves to the existence of so large a field of research and comparison, I have never been able to understand. Lord Avebury writes,-"if I were to despair it would be to see some of our ablest intellects still clinging to the most childish superstitions of the darkest ages and the lowest savages." Well, very low savages appear to have some practical knowledge of hypnotism and of crystal-gazing. But these things are facts. There is such a thing as hypnotic influ- ence; hallucinations can be induced, in a percentage of educated, civilised persons, by crystal-gazing. Why should Lord Avebury be inclined to despair because we investigate human faculties ? As M. van Gennep says, "it is unscien- tific to deny that certain persons can find water-springs by aid of the divining rod (baguette) merely because we cannot explain the phenomenon." 45 It is much too late to dismiss facts by giving them a bad name as " superstitions."
