<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES A. DIEFENBECK Bringing Things About This paper, resting upon a presupposition that activity is the ultimate metaphysical reality, attempts to challenge widely held assumptions that genuine knowledge is confined to the form of objective truths, and that every event has a cause, or that the sole mode through which things are brought about is causal control. It then seeks to formulate the general forms that our knowledge of activity has actually taken, and to indicate some major modes by which we influence the activities of other agents. Any person, even any conceivable agent, exists by initiating some movement. The initial and ever-present form of an organisms's presence is its movement of its own body, which is the sign and portent of its existence: Even when unconscious we can breathe and move our own limbs. When such a center of activity seeks to extend its control beyond its own body, what it seeks to do can be expressed by the term "bringing about" when this is used as a neutral expression indicating no particular mode of such attempts to control either nature itself or other agents. Our problem is to identify the various major ways in which an agent can bring things about and the inherent possibilities and limitations of these modes of operation. All existence is, or is the result of, self-movement. In the most primitive movements there is no differentiation between an entity's doing something and its knowledge of what it is doing. But when development of activity has reached the organic level, a distinction does appear between an entity's initiative movement and its primitive awareness of what it is doing, although this represents only a very minimal level of comprehension of THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. V, No. 3, 1991.

Primitive activity is predominantly regular, as in the self maintained enduring patterns of atomic motion or even in the genetically maintained forms of organic reproduction. Certain of these organic ac tivities, such as those of genes, influence or direct other activities, but this bringing about occurs through the impingement of one motion on other motions. What lifts activity itself, as well as knowledge of it, to a radically new level is the development of concepts of action. Human agents bring these concepts into existence when they expand the modes of their activities from the initiation of physical movement to the initiation of thought. Conceptual activity originates as a reflective activity in which an agent examines one of its acts in order to understand it in a new way of formulat ing it as a concept or idea that expresses the intention or purpose or mode of operation of such an immediate act. Thus I examine my eating of food and formulate it as an attempt to maintain my strength, or as an attempt to get rid of a particular unpleasant feeling in my stomach. This is not merely the reaction of one movement to another, as in a developing organism's following the lead presented to it by the genes, but is an activity whose aim is not the control of movement, but the generation of understanding. Understanding is made possible by this new level of conceptual thought, which is not only self-maintaining, as are organic processes, but is also capable of presenting the meaning of an act through an activity that is independent of the act it is attempting to comprehend. This expanded activity, in moving beyond any activity it seeks to understand, cannot be reduced to, or included within, the direct activity it seeks to know. Independence of a concept of activity enables it to reflect upon the direct activity so as to make it more comprehensible. An empiri cal objective concept is abstracted from, but cannot alter, the perceptions to which it refers; a concept of activity is a creative extension of activity beyond the act to which it refers. Because a concept of activity is the expansive act of an agent, this act, moving from a direct act to conceptual formulation of that act, can take many different forms. Thus, there can be many different concepts of activity seeking to illuminate the same direct action. Bringing things about does not initially appear as a problem, since it first occurs as an immediate or instinctive activity, as in the genetic direction of an individual's development into its mature form, or in various organisms' instinctive ways of affecting each other in maintaining an animal commu nity. Such activities are largely regular, as genetically directed or as long</page><page sequence="3">182 JAMES A. DIEFENBECK standing habitual behavior. Bringing things about emerges as a self conscious problem with the appearance of conceptual activity, which enables an act to be examined apart from its actual performance. In this way the meanings of various acts can be held in one mind and examined in relation to each other so as to make explicit the possibility of alternative courses of action. One pf the questions this process opens is how an agent is to make such a directive concept of action effective by extending his control beyond the direction of his own bodily movements. Atoms themselves can be considered as centers of activity, but we are at present concerned with activity on the organic level. An individual organ ism represents a direct relationship among various centers of activity; and relationships among individual organisms represent other more self conscious ways of bringing things about. Animals train their young and affect the behavior of others as, for example, in establishing a pecking order or in staking out their territories. And insect communities represent very advanced examples of such control as mutual relations among active agents. Instinctive modes of operation continue to occur on the human level, but the generation of conceptual thought enables these operations to be brought into conscious consideration and to be formulated as explicit modes of behavior so that they can be examined and compared with each other. While the first movements of human self-understanding appear as the creation of aesthetic images expressing feelings, the movement toward comprehension of activities themselves takes form not as objective con cepts, but as concepts of activity; these are reflected in the animism and anthropomorphism of early thought. These early concepts are often closer to the realm of feeling and the aesthetic than to the precision and clarity we expect in conceptual thought. And although animistic modes?such as teaching by imitation, the use of argument, supplication, threat, or appeal to divinities?are useful for affecting the acts of other human agents, they are subsequently discovered to be rather ineffective in bringing about events in the inorganic world and even in most non-human organisms. And the great advance in the formulation and use of concepts, and in the prestige that attaches to them, has occurred in our tradition through attempts to fashion a different kind of concept: one indicating, not human feelings or acts, but a very different, objective relationship that exists in its own terms independent of all human desires, acts, or controls and finds its cognitive certification in some form of permanence. Objective concepts gained their great cognitive prestige in Greek</page><page sequence="4">BRINGING THINGS ABOUT 183 thought, not when referring, as in Thales's concept of water, to nature, which is largely beyond our control, but in relation to thought itself. Pythagoras led this development in his turning to mathematics and propor tional relationship, in which concepts can be both clearly and exactly conceived and related to each other with absolute certainty. These are in a realm of thought, however, rather than of encountered reality. The practi cal, as distinguished from the cognitive, prestige of concepts (which depends upon their certainty) comes with the modern attempt (developing from Pythagoras's further relation of number to natural phenomena, as in his account of musical scales) to see the primary significance of concepts as related, not to each other, but to nature. This process enables us to attain a certain measure of control over natural phenomena. In relation to nature the stance making possible this new function of objective concepts is a passivity that attempts to observe how the inorganic world behaves in its own terms. While such passivity is the attitude with which we regard nature in this search for the objective, the positive cognitive content of this observation is some form or manifestation of permanence. This appears either as static existence, or, more commonly, as repeated orders in our perceptions. When receptive observation of nature encounters regular patterns of operation, these can be formulated as laws of nature. The utility of such discovered laws is that they enable us to control, at least to some extent, the nature they describe, not by changing the way it behaves with threats or persuasion, but by understanding it in its own terms and then operating upon it through causal activity. In Bacon's famous phrase, we become the servants of nature in order to become her master. The great success of this causal operation in the modern world has led to attempts to turn both the cognitive form of laws of nature and the use of these laws in the control of nature into philosophical principles appearing as cognitive and metaphysical absolutes. The passivity and the static form of the objective cognitive principle means that knowledge is concerned with something other than our acts; the causal principle holds that every event is brought about by something other than itself, or that causation is the only way by which events in nature are established. In this way certain particular modes of human activity?one discovering regular orders indi cated by our perceptions but beyond change by our own acts, the other using these regular orders or laws for causal explanation and for a limited control of nature?are turned into total or all-encompassing principles that are thought to indicate, on the one hand, the sole meaning of knowledge, and, on the other hand, the only way by which events are</page><page sequence="5">184 JAMES A. DIEFENBECK brought about in the encountered world. There have even been attempts to reduce initiative action itself to causal control. But fundamental contradictions appear in these very conceptions when they are examined as all-inclusive or philosophical principles. Here I will summarize some of these difficulties without developing them in detail. The supposedly objective laws of nature, existing in nature quite apart from our acts, are discovered, principally through the thought of Kant, to depend as well on our own spontaneous acts asserting the categories without which such laws could not be known and formulated. Yet objective laws cannot comprehend these very activities on which they depend since they both refer to and depend upon an opposite principle, the passiveness of received information. Further, if objective laws were all-encompassing they would negate the possibility of the initiative acts that are required for the very discovery of laws of nature, an aspect of scientific investigation discovered by the Copernican revolution and one that recognizes the importance of aggressive experiments in contrast to mere unaided percep tion. And because the use of a law for specific prediction, or for causal control, requires in addition an act of either direct control or delineation of a particular measured situation (which is quite different from an abstracted law), such acts are essential ingredients in any specific prediction and in any achievement of causal control. But an act, through its very self initiation, excludes itself from complete causal determination, for this requires the establishment of an event by something other than itself. If all events were caused, this would render impossible acts that are essential in any act of causal control. For these reasons the cognitive mode of objective knowledge cannot be an adequate form of knowledge since we require some method, which it cannot provide, for comprehending activity itself. And causal control cannot be the only mode by which human agents bring about events in the world since it cannot explain the acts that are essential in its own opera tion. Thus, modes of knowing other than the discovered laws of objective thought, and means of bringing things about other than causal control, must be appealed to, even for the effective operation of lawful knowledge and causal control. These objective modes cannot be considered as them selves defining metaphysical and cognitive forms but must be seen as elements within a wider and more comprehensive philosophy. The com mon assumption that irrationality would follow if every event were not thought to have a cause does not hold if there are other intelligible ways of bringing about events in the world.</page><page sequence="6">BRINGING THINGS ABOUT 185 In order to explore the possibility of other modes of bringing about, we turn again to concepts of activity that provide the cognitive form for understanding these other possible ways of effecting events in the world. Concepts of activity represent the first or most primitive appearance of concepts, although it is not this temporal priority that gives them their philosophical priority. These are the concepts that acting agents generate in order to extend their Self-knowledge beyond the direct acquaintance with action that accompanies its very doing. In the Western tradition the emergence of concepts as precise and effective instruments of thought has occurred in terms of the Greek development of objective concepts, which are able to generate certainty in their deductive form and the possibility of causal control in their empirical form. However, the limitation of these forms, when turned into philosophical positions, has become apparent. This realization, and the emergence of the idea of activity as a reality more fundamental than permanence, suggest that we turn to concepts of activity as a central cognitive category and consider, under its aegis, modes of bringing things about other than that represented by causal control. Concepts of activity refer to and bring us an enhanced comprehension of our own acts. And the conceptual precision generated in objective thought enables us to bring into existence a more accurate form of such reflective knowledge than it originally manifested. One form of activity is the attempt to bring about changes in the acts of other persons. What are the avenues, other than causal control, that open before us when we challenge the philosophical pretensions of objective truth and causal control, but still seek to influence the controlling ideas of other human agents? From the presupposition of this paper, which is the metaphysical status of activity, it follows that the relations among centers of activity are only what they, or other centers of activity, bring about. Atoms, as centers of activity, re-act to other atoms in forming compounds because of their characteristic and continuing modes of activity, such as those represented by their valences. But this activity does not control, or allow prediction of, the complete actual activities of atoms, for there is no existing control of their meetings, since they themselves control only the way they react to other atoms when they meet, not the occurrence of such meetings. Atoms control only their self-maintaining activities. Any further predic tion, for instance that atoms will meet at a particular time or place, is possible only as some other center of activity, such as a chemist, directs their meeting by bringing them together to form a compound. Because atoms in their meetings, as in entering into a simple compound, do not</page><page sequence="7">186 JAMES A. DIEFENBECK alter their natures, but rather continue to act in the same way, the inorganic world is partly regular as following from these largely regular orders of primitive activity. However, it lacks total regularity or predic tability because of the absence of any further control over the relationships or meetings of these atoms, for even their further modes of activity? manifested in the electro-magnetic force, the weak and strong atomic forces, and gravity?do not generate a completely predictable order. At oms control, not their meetings with other atoms, but merely the way they behave when they encounter them. Barring further control by organic agents, the inorganic world is not completely predictable because, although it manifests some regularities in the activity of its constituents such as atoms, there is present no total control of the relations among such elements. Present-day chaos theory represents a recognition of, and an interest in, this situation. Causal control is a later and highly specialized activity in which an agent compre hends, and then uses, encountered regularities for a particular purpose, thus partially reducing the initial randomness of the meetings of elements. The movements of a clock can be more predictable, because more regular, than are macroscopic natural events because the relationships between its parts are controlled by the clockmaker. The first appearance of a control by which one agent brings about something beyond its own initial activity occurs with the generation of organic relationships in which two self-maintaining entities, such as atoms or molecules, encounter each other and, in this meeting, extend their activities in a new form that is not a causal effect. It is, rather, the result of the first movement of mutual organic activity, and is a new form differing from an inorganic compound which is produced from the meeting of atoms. In a compound the atoms continue their unchanged habitual ways of behaving; in an organic activity its constituent elements, that is its atoms or molecules, not only continue their accustomed activities, but also generate in their meetings new modes of mutually supported activity in which they are both active and passive in relation to each other. From these initial relationships emerge the more developed systems of activity within an organism which themselves influence each other, as, for instance, the nervous system affects and is affected by the endocrine system. An organism represents an area where the problem of bringing things about is a subjective, but not a reflective, problem. That is, the control between organic centers is one in which there is a self-change in both entities in such an organic relationship, but one achieved not through</page><page sequence="8">BRINGING THINGS ABOUT 187 reflective conceptual knowledge of these activities, but through the direct contact of their respective movements as they alter themselves in imping ing upon each other. A human example of this is two persons holding hands and silently going for a walk. Such centers of activity affect each other but not in a causal way, because both centers of activity themselves act in new ways to accomplish what they jointly do. What is brought about is a commonly supported expansion of modes of behavior, rather than an imposition by one center of activity upon another entity of a non-self maintained form, as in causal control when, for instance, I stamp an image on a coin. Causal control involves the separation of activity from passivity so that one agent is active in the relation between the two, while the other is passive. If, when one human being attempts to causally control another, the affected agent is active in changing its mode of behavior, the regular order used for causal control disappears and with it the effectiveness of this mode of operation. In an organic relationship between animate entities, both agents, rather than just one, are engaged in a common activity, but the degree and kind of activity manifested by two active centers coming into contact on various activity levels can vary widely. While one partner may take the lead and create the form of movement, the other partner must also be active at least in initiating its own movement, although it is following the pattern initiated by its partner. For its effective operation, causal control requires an element of stability in the entity affected which exists independently of anything the controller does. But in an organic relationship even the less active or originative agent must still act as a self-originative center and make contact with the other agent in following the mode of action which that agent indicates. This difference explains why the activity that is brought about in the receptive agent can be self-maintaining, whereas in causal control the imposed pattern is not self-maintained by the caused entity but is even tually worn away or dissipated, as is the image on a stamped coin. The control of the development of a new individual by the activity of the genes is an example of the initiative leadership of one activity in regard to another that follows its pattern. However, the new agent produced in this relationship is quite as much an active agent as are its parents, or their genes, which gave it its pattern of development. The key here is the transference of a change in form of activity to another center, something which causal control cannot accomplish. While causal control involves the isolation of the self-moving activities</page><page sequence="9">188 JAMES A. DIEFENBECK of the agents involved, so that one does not influence the other, organic relationship requires contact between these activities, even when one activity takes the lead and the other follows. If this relationship is repeated, it presents the appearance of a causal relationship because the act of the leader is regularly followed by a similar act in the follower. But if a follower exhibited the passivity required in a causal effect, he would be unable to act in following the leading pattern. If I follow you I cannot be totally passive but must myself walk. One can lead another person who can move himself, but one cannot lead a rock; to move it one has to initiate its movement by pulling it, as well as determining the path it is to take. And this motion I impose on the rock does not become part of its nature. A human being depends upon incredibly complex organic relationships, most particularly on genetic control. The emergence of the control of other agents as an explicitly perceived problem comes about, however, through the initiation of concepts of action. These are ideas explicitly formulating patterns or aims of action, and the ensuing problems of deciding among alternative ideas of action, and of possibly implementing them in the activities of other agents. Organic developments as such seem to occur directly and immediately, without deliberation. But the creation of con cepts of activity separates ideas of activity from the direct activities them selves, so that, having independent existence, they can, as enduring concepts, be considered in relation to each other. This makes it possible for a human being to consider activities other than the one currently engaged in so as to raise the normative problem of determining which mode of activity among those considered he wishes to follow. It also raises the further problem of how to lead other centers of activity to follow a given mode of activity. This requires some form of bringing about that moves beyond causal control, since the very definition of the problem requires two initiative agents each being active in relation to the same idea. Causal control depends upon regularities in an entity in which it causes an effect that is impervious to anything the controller does because it requires the maintenance of a given pattern of activity in any entity that can be successfully controlled by this mode of operation. Its operation merely adds a further form that is superimposed on this continuing reg ularity but does not become part of it as a self-maintained form. Any organism represents a level of mutuality among its constituent animate activities in bringing about changes, not causally, but in a direct way, that is through the impingement of one movement upon others. What appears as the specifically human problem is that of bringing things about in</page><page sequence="10">BRINGING THINGS ABOUT 189 relation to guiding concepts of activity. In place of organic activity in which centers just regularly follow a pattern of activity indicated by the genes, or by more developed relationships indicated by the nerves or chemical messengers, there appears the specific problem of human activity. This has two aspects: first the normative problem we have indicated; that is, how to determine the best guiding concept of activity to follow. This is the problem reflective historical thought seeks to solve, but it is not our primary present concern. The second problem is how one person is to lead others to follow such a norm, which they then use to guide their conduct. When a human agent has established what he considers the best norm he can generate, he faces the important political problem of how he can implement it by bringing other agents to accept and act in accord with the goal of action. Causal control, as the use of encountered regular behavior in another person, can be turned to, but this has two limitations, one being that the other person may change his priorities and thus his modes of behavior. If this self-generated change in behavior occurs, the observed regular behavior or law, on which causal control depends, has been elimi nated and the control fails. The other limitation is that the control lasts only as long as the controller acts, for instance by paying money to another to perform some labor. The reason for this lack of continuing control is that causal control does not change the self-motivated and self-determined modes of acting of other agents. Thus, with the termination of the controller's acts, this form of action is not maintained, precisely because it has never become the goal of the affected agents. How then can a concept of action be transferred to another agent so that it is the goal he himself will implement? One of the most effective and prevalent modes for accomplishing this is indoctrina tion. Indoctrination has the double advantage of operating in terms of guiding concepts of action or norms, and of generating a commitment to this goal by the agent indoctrinated. But how does this mode, which is routinely successful when properly practiced, manage to produce ac ceptance of a guiding norm by individuals who are freely acting self determining centers? Practitioners of indoctrination know the answer to this question: It must operate upon young minds before they have developed conceptual commit ments, and must present one such conceptual system in isolation, so that access to alternative systems is not allowed. Given this situation, indoc trination is almost uniformly successful since these unformed minds cannot themselves invent such an overall system. Therefore, they turn to the</page><page sequence="11">190 JAMES A. DIEFENBECK system presented as the only alternative to remaining on the instinctive level of activity. If one is convinced that knowledge, to be useful in directing activity, must take shape as truth, and that one has found such a truth as a universally applicable directive of action, then the problem of communica tion takes the form of bringing about acceptance of this view in other minds, and indoctrination is the proper way to proceed. But if activity itself, rather than some objective existent or particular truth, is taken as the ultimate reality, spontaneous or initiative movement is always a possibility for an active agent. And the exercise of this potentiality can produce new norms that may challenge any norm assumed to be the exclusive determi nant of activity. Therefore, if activity is judged a fundamental reality, other agents cannot be considered merely as recipients of indoctrination, for they can also be the source of alternative guiding norms of action. And as the norms they assert are different from, or are even incompatible with, one's own guiding concepts, such agents can be seen not merely as possible subjects for indoctrination, but also as the asserters of norms that may challenge one's own. This unresolved conflict among incompatible norms presents a situation reflective thought seeks to solve. Resolving this incompatibility becomes possible, however, only as one ceases to think of other agents as merely subjects for indoctrination, and instead considers them also as the sources of diverse norms of action. One may still be concerned with bringing about acceptance of one's ideals by others. This urgency is tempered, however, by realizing the lack of finality in one's own convictions because they are not truths but subjec tively asserted norms which may possibly be inferior to the ideals of other agents or to new concepts that may emerge in the future. Resolution of such possible opposition can come, not from any objective appeal, but only from the generation by active agents of further relationships among such con cepts themselves. Thus, that exclusive initiative activity of the controller in his relationship with other agents, which is characteristic of both causal control and indoctrination, is succeeded by a relationship in which each agent is both receptive and initiative in relation to the convictions of others. In this way a thinker is no longer solely interested in bringing about acceptance of his own ideals by others, for he is also open to having his convictions altered by other agents. Further, another person, even though he accepts my values, may alter or extend them. The great new dimension of freedom appearing in this form of mutual</page><page sequence="12">BRINGING THINGS ABOUT 191 relationship is that passiveness before the ideas of others is no longer the passiveness of the indoctrinee who, although active, has no alternatives in his possible activity. Passiveness in its new form is temporary and limited in that it has alternatives for consideration; and in relation to these it can alter and re-formulate any norm it receives as well as its own original commit ment. This means that a person in this receptive relationship is not purely passive before the conviction of another, since he not only considers it in relation to alternative norms but can also interpret it as he sees fit. The most important dimension of this new relationship among active agents is that the static status of a person's commitment to his normative concepts, which is required for successful indoctrination, is overcome through intro duction of conceptual diversity in his own universe of thought and action. An agent moves from an exclusive interest either in imposing his ideas on others, or in passively accepting a norm that is thought of as an eternal universal truth, to a position where his ideas themselves come properly into focus only through this double receptive and initiative relationship with other conceptually directed agents. This is a progression from the either active or passive movements of objective thought and causal control and a return to the mutual relationship among centers of activity characteristic of organisms. But this relationship involves, not the mutual impingement of physical movements and the usual leadership of one such activity, which are found in organic and especially genetic relationships, but the meeting of concepts of activity. A person seeks to encounter disruptive and chal lenging positions different from his own as presenting the ground from which can proceed the resolution of such conflicts in the generation of a new position. An individual may well believe in a position and wish others to accept it, but only if this acceptance emerges from their own active consideration of it in relation to alternatives. Some measure of indoctrina tion of the young is unavoidable, but a proper maturity is attained only as indoctrination is overcome by a reflective establishment of guiding norms. In this dispensation, knowledge moves beyond the boundaries of truth, for agents are concerned primarily not with finding existing regularities in an encountered world, but first with the generation of new forms of activity and then with the creation of reflective knowledge of such activities. This knowledge cannot be formulated in terms of the permanence that is the cognitive content of truth, but proceeds, rather, in the dimension of self moving activities and requires a more complex relationship among active agents themselves. Activity can find an order adequate to its ever-possible expansive movements not by reference to an encountered permanence</page><page sequence="13">192 JAMES A. DIEFENBECK apart from itself, and not in a self-created permanence in its own operation (as in an enduring concept it creates) but only in self-generated systematic activity itself. The cognitive goal here is not permanence but a connected order within activity, one that is in a continuing process of transforming itself. Neither causal bringing about, in its imposition of an external form on a regular order, nor the indoctrinational transference of an activity from one mind to another, is adequate when human agents have generated concepts of activity and then seek to generate evaluative knowledge of these directing concepts. Other persons can no longer be seen as the objects of one's causal or indoctrinational control, but as initiative agents equivalent to one's self in the very process of improving guiding norms and of making these politically effective. The drive to bring about a particular conviction in other agents becomes modified by the willingness also to have one's ideas brought about by others, but in a process one controls. Other agents are no longer objects to be controlled but, in company with any thinker himself, autonomous agents in a reflective community.
