BALZER ABSTRACT Siberian Khanty (Ob Ugrian Ostiak) burial rituals have weathered acculturating pressures of Russian Orthodoxy and Communism, although a few significant changes have occurred. Analysis of burial ritual reveals both syncretism and the maintenance of basic Khanty values. Behavioral mechanisms which allow Khanty to cope with their new identity as Soviet citizens at the same time they maintain their identity as Khanty are discussed, in order to place the burial rituals in perspective. The Khanty of the Ob River in Northwestern Siberia (fig. l) are a Finno-Ugric people often called Ostiaks in Western literature. Far from having given up their ethnic identity while under Russian influence, the Khanty provide evidence for cultural persistence in the North. This is best revealed in their religious be- liefs, particularly those beliefs buttressed by the symbolic action of life-crisis ritual. Cultural persistence in Khanty burial ritual is especially strong, as indicated by examina- tion of recent "graves in the two Khanty villages of Tegy and Kazeem, by discussions with Khanty informants of various ages, and by observa- tions of aspects of remembrance feasting.1 lI was privileged to accompany a Soviet ethnographic expedition sponsored by Leningrad University in the summer of 1976. This short but fruitful field trip -was possible because I was living in the Soviet Union for thirteen months as part of the US-USSR cultural ex- change. My ethnohistorical research and fieldwork in the Soviet Union were made pos- sible by a grant from the International Re- search and Exchange Board (1975-76), while my analysis and writing of the data were sup- ported by The Helen Wood-Pearl Hogrefe Fellow- ship of the American Association of University Women (1977-78). I am deeply indebted to two Soviet scholars who made my field trip both possible and enjoyable: Rudolf Fer diñando vi eh Its, head (and founder) of the Leningrad Uni- versity department of ethnography, and Valery Andreevieh Kozmin. Drofessor and expedition leader. (They are not responsible for my non- Marxist interpretation of data. ) In writing this article, I gratefully acknowledge the critical assistance and encouragement of Jane C. Goodale and Frederica de Laguna of Bryn Mawr College, Jonathan G. Andelson and This article describes Khanty burial prac- tices, analyzing how they have been influenced both by Russian Orthodoxy and Communism. Ac- culturating influences have resulted in syn- cretism and have not shattered basic Khanty values. Behavioral mechanisms which allow the Khanty to cope with their new identity as Soviet citizens at the same time they main- tain their identity as Khanty are explored in the conclusion. Although the focus of this article is on cultural persistence in ritual, it is neces- sary to explain that Khanty have been very willing to accept material benefits such as salaries and electricity from the Russians. They are also happy to buy snowmobiles, motor- boats, and vodka. Their acceptance of ma- terial and social changes has not prevented them from maintaining a sense of dignity, a cultural sense of "self." My work can be grouped with the growing body of anthropological literature that em- phasizes culture change through culture con- tacts as a process that is often dynamic and organic rather than entirely assimilative.2 Ralph Luebben of Grinnell College, Demitri B.

Culture gain is accounted for as "well as culture loss. In addition, the ability of a single individual to play "both traditional and modern roles in different socio-cultural contexts can be affirmed. Khanty talent for adaptation has histori- cally been tested by some Communist tactics, especially in the 1930s when villages were evacuated, shamans persecuted, and nomadic reindeer breeders T children forced to go to boarding schools, while their parents were swept into fishing and reindeer breeding brigades (Balzer 1979a: 81-99) • Oppression, however, has not been the norm, and, since Russian culture is not a monolith, a distinc- tion should be made between officials and Siberian-Russian settlers. Despite Soviet anti-religious propaganda, Khanty beliefs about life after death and reincarnation have continued to dominate burial ritual. Faith in reincarnation helps Khanty perceive themselves as an ongoing ethnic group. According to one Khanty myth, all people once lived forever because the sky-god Numi-torum made them out of iron, an impor- tant Siberian symbol of strength and spiri- tual power. However, the iron was too heavy for easy walking, and too many people came to inhabit the earth. The sky-god let everyone die and then remade people in pairs by nationality out of clay and water. This meant that the Khanty could die and return to the earth, to be reborn as Khanty children when their time came. KHANTY BURIAL Khanty care passionately about their dying and their dead. To accentuate this, a young fisherman of the village of Kazeem told me a somewhat ethnocentric story about the differ- ences between the Nentsy, a neighboring Samoyedic tribe, and the Khanty treatment of the dead. The nomadic Nentsy, he claimed, still leave behind their old people when they have gotten too old to fend for themselves. One time some Nentsy left their old grand- father, thinking him near death, but he fol- lowed his family and caught up with them at their next camp. They thought he was an evil spirit and threw knives at him, which he had to dodge. "The Khanty are the opposite," this proud man insisted; "they are close to their dying and wish to care for them so they will die contented." The Khanty, he implied, wish to avoid having their dead become evil spirits, by treating them well. PREPARATION RITUAL Treatment begins when a Khanty is sick, and close relatives are called to take turns in attendance. There is special concern, both for the sake of the family and for the sake of the dying, that the multiple souls of the invalid be allowed to follow their proper afterlife courses. The "breath" soul must be kept under a shroud, transferred to a doll image of the deceased, and relinquished to live in the Khanty afterworld so that even- tually it can return as the reincarnation soul. The "shadow," or "material" soul, which is considered capable of getting drunk, must be encouraged to live in the graveyard. Other souls, varying in their specifics with different groups of Khanty, may fly into the forest as birds or become evil soul-stealing spirits. The Soviet ethnographer Chernetsov (1963) claims that Khanty believe men have five souls, while women have only four.3 When the last breath escapes, a fire is begun in the house. In Kazeem, it is important that this fire be next to the body, and kept continually burning. In earlier years, this fire had to come specifically from the ehuval, or traditional round wood stove where the household fire spirit Tut-imi ("old woman fire") was believed to dwell. The fire symbolizes both the need for purification in the presence of death and the familial link between the living and dead. The body of the deceased is laid "straight out on the floor," or occasionally, in Kazeem, set on a table "Russian style." A scarf or some other article of the deceased1 s clothing is washed as symbolic purification from death, and, with Russian influence, the body is also washed. Close relatives are not allowed to wash or dress the body, and today women make these preparations for women, and men for men. attempted to outline the emerging theory. The eminent Soviet scholar Arutiunov (1978: 3-lM has recently been grappling with similar problems of "bi-culturalism." 3Chernetsov (1963:3-^5) claims that Ob- Ugrian peoples, Khanty and Mansi, believe in the following four main souls: lil , the rein- carnation or breath soul; is-chov , the material or shadow soul; uVdm^ the soul which comes to a person in sleep and at death clings to clothing until it can be coaxed into the forest as a bird; and urt9 the sickness soul, which leaves a person in sickness or death and travels northward to the afterworld. The fifth soul that men have, but women do not have, is probably "strength." Lydia Black (pers. comm. February l6, 1978) feels that so- called "multiple" souls in Siberian beliefs are actually "the relationship of parts to the whole."</page><page sequence="4">SO Arctic Anthropology XVII- 1 In some areas, people build up a specialist reputation for preparing the body. A Kazeem informant explained, "Some are specially asked to dress the dead. I personally remember one old woman who was always asked. . . . Such people know how to dress the dead properly." These specialists are sometimes, but not necessarily, shamans. They may have a role in the burial itself, and, in Tegy, may be given presents by close relatives of the de- ceased. In Kazeem they are "usually not paid, but are respected. They know how to pray for the dead." Clothes of the dead consist of what he or she died in, plus "traditional" holiday clothes, decorated with beads and applique, forming a layer on top. These "best" clothes are tied with a special "knot of the dead" around the arms and legs. The right hand is tucked under the deceased1 s belt. In addi- tion, a white shroud or best shawl is placed around the head and shoulders. It is some- times decorated with beads forming representa- tions of eyes, noses, mouths, and ears. This seems to be the modern equivalent of tradi- tional "death masks." Death masks of rein- deer skin, buttons and disks have been described by Chernetsov (1963:29) and may be related to bronze North Ugrian masks of the first century A.D. reported by Moszynska (1968). The masks are representations of the skull, where the reincarnation soul is sup- posed to dwell. To protect themselves from the contamina- tion of death, members of the immediate family cut their hair and burn it in the stove. Locks of hair are in turn cut from the deceased, preferably by a somewhat distant relative such as a second cousin, and often by an elderly woman. The hair is twisted with grass into a doll-like image of the dead. It is said that it is important to use much hair, "as if it were the deceased1 s soul." During the rigorous mourning period, which lasts forty days after a woman* s death or fifty days after a manfs death, the doll is "awakened in the morning and laid to rest at night." At the end of this period, in Tegy, the image is burned in a special grove at the edge of the village.4 Before the burial itself, members of the immediate family demonstrate their solicitude by taking turns with the body, sitting near the head throughout the night in shifts. It is forbidden to sleep while "on watch," since in sleep one's souls are vulnerable. For three days and nights, the deceased is considered, according to a Tegy elder, "neither here nor there. . . . His favorite things and candy and cookies must be placed with him. The dead man is like a spirit of the parallel world now." It is believed that during this time, the de- ceased travels to all the places he or she had visited in life, "even Moscow or America." Such spirits are blamed for taking missing reindeer and for frightening late night travel- lers. A travelling "material" soul can be recognized by its death mask, death knots, and restrained right hand. In Kazeem, but not in Tegy, the corpse is brought outside on the second day after death so that "friends and relatives who had lived at some earlier time can come to meet the dead. It is easier and better for the living if they meet outside." The body is placed next to the family house with a campfire, and its feet are pointed toward the river to indi- cate that its nocturnal journeys should lead it away from the village. During the three to four day interval be- fore burial, the coffin and grave goods are prepared.' Although Sokolova (1971:229; cf. 1975:166) claims that coffins made of cut-off boats are rare among the Sinski and Kunovat Khanty, there is evidence that some boats with their ends cut off are still used as coffins today in Kazeem. One Khanty Communist Party official confided that in 1975, "an old man was buried in a cut-off boat." A young mother who escorted me through the Kazeem graveyard claimed that many Khanty still pre- fer boat burials. Sometimes, particularly in summer, it is difficult for a family to sacrifice a usable boat which takes time to replace, and so a Russian-style larchwood coffin is substituted. It is "usually larger than Russian coffins," to accommodate grave goods . THE GRAVEYARD Traditional burials occurred on the day after death in an extended patrilineal family graveyard near the family dwelling. Today most Khanty prefer interment in graveyards which are some distance from their village or nomadic settlement - in the forest, on a river ^Karjalainen (l921:lUU) reported that, on the Kazeem River at the turn of the century, doll images were also made of hair. In other Khanty localities the images were traditional- ly made of wood and bits of metal, dressed with layers of clothing (cf. Sokolova 1975: 170-171 ). They were kept in sacred family boxes, given offerings, and occasionally be- came renowned as idols. Doll images of vil- lage leaders and shamans were especially likely to become such idols, while the images of other family members were eventually buried. I am extremely grateful to the National Museum of Finland and to Finno-Ugric curator Ildiko Lehtinen for allowing me to study the images in their collections.</page><page sequence="5">Balzer: Siberian Khanty Burial Ritual 81 bank, on a high cliff, or on an island. Family clusters within the graveyard are maintained and sometimes fenced together. Khanty say, "it is dangerous for too many graves to be in too many different places. There will be more deaths. Spirits are still around the graves." Nonetheless, some fami- lies still prefer to bury their dead in an- cient family graveyards rather than in larger, newer community cemeteries such as those in Tegy and Kazeem. The Nettkin family grave- yard, situated in the forest five kilometers from Tegy, is an example of this preference. I observed that today both Khanty and Russian families share a general graveyard in Tegy and Kazeem. The Russian graves are segregated and readily recognizable, for they are placed in front along main paths, they have family names marked on their Russian Orthodox crosses, and they lack campfire sites. Several Khanty families usually share a campfire. There are three campfire places for approximately forty graves in Tegy and twelve for about two hundred graves in Kazeem. To reach the isolated village graveyards, which are usually near water, the Khanty organize a burial procession, in summer by boat, and in winter by reindeer sled. If the body has not already been taken out of the house (as in Kazeem), then relatives must first remove the body through a window, or put an iron knife on the threshold after the body is removed by the door. This act prevents the "material" soul from returning home (Chernet- sov 1963:3; Karjalainen 1921:128). The house is then noisily smoked to purify it and to drive away any lingering souls of the de- ceased. Finally, close lineal relatives share the boat or sled with the deceased, while others travel ahead, tempting the "material" soul to follow them. They carry a table, kettle, food, tea, and liquor. Once all mourners have arrived, they de- termine a northwest orientation for the grave, which is then dug to a depth of about six feet by male relatives. Close relatives, such as the son of a deceased father, or a younger brother, are forbidden to participate since the deceased might be tempted to steal a soul of an especially beloved relative. Women, sitting off to the side, begin a campfire and the boiling of tea. The coffin is lowered in- to the grave by four men who place the corpse with its feet to the northwest. Eighteenth century observers Novitsky (l88U:U5) and Zuev ( 19^7:67) both claimed that Khanty coffins were placed with much wailing, hair tearing and face scratching, but more recent sources and my own informants mention only reverent silence, deeply felt parting kisses, and unstylized weeping. Both Russian influences and local differences may be in- volved here. The dead are praised and their deeds in life are enumerated in weeping songs, sung particularly by close relatives of the same sex as the deceased. After the coffin has been lowered, grave goods including some of the deceased1 s belong- ings and some presents from the participants are placed in it. In Kazeem, it is said that the faster the belongings are thrown into the coffin, the more quickly they reach the de- ceased. Grave goods vary according to the sex and personal activities of the deceased, since it is expected that he or she will live a comparable life to the one just completed. Some clothes and subsistence equipment are still obligatory, although it appears that under recent pragmatic Soviet influence a compromise has been reached that allows some valuables , such as fur parkas , to be in- herited. One old Tegy fisherman mentioned that when he was young, relatives put valuable guns, jewelry, beads, amulets, and many knives into their coffins. The Russian archeologist Rudenko!s examinations of graves dating from the l600s to the beginning of this century (1910:36-37) back up this claim. To- day one knife, a tobacco pouch and pipe, a flint, a hunting belt, and bear tooth amulets might be placed in a manfs coffin. A woman's coffin usually contains her sewing bag, beads, needles, and extra lengths of material. In Kazeem, at strictly traditional burials, close female relatives of the deceased walk in a circle around the grave five times for a man, and four times for a woman, chanting "an old woman collects five distaffs, five hammers, and five needles." Each of these items is grasped during the walk and then tossed into the coffin. The women probably wish to demonstrate their exertion and generosity, so that the souls of the deceased will be content not to bother the living. The ethnographer Gondatti v( 1887:67) men- tioned that drawings of animals, birds, or fish were placed on the lids of coffins by some Khanty and Mans i . He considered these to be symbols of patrilineal clan affilia- tions. Such drawings may be compared to the clan symbols placed in the graves of women. These symbols, for instance of ravens, fal- cons, snakes, or frogs, are paired metal hair ornaments that Khanty women traditionally wore in their braids (cf. Roheim 195^:33; Karjalainen 1921 :U5). Such clan markers are no longer worn and are probably not considered mandatory as grave goods today. According to a Kazeem informant , drawings of a sun and crescent moon are sometimes scratched in char- coal on the coffin to discourage the deceased from wandering, but these do not seem to be clan-related symbols. In both Tegy and Kazeem, certain items tainted with death (worn by the deceased while sick) are hung or tossed into the woods near</page><page sequence="6">82 Arctic Anthropology XVII- 1 the graveyard. I observed fur boots, an em- broidered dress, a -worn black Soviet work jacket, bedding, and a shirt scattered near Kazeem graves and was told: "It is forbidden to us, the living, to see or use these things; forbidden for the living to have contact." If reindeer or horses, preferably owned by the deceased, are available, several are sacrificed. The ideal is that three reindeer should be stunned by an axe blow on the neck. This ritual should be performed by a shaman, or by an older male relative of the deceased. Some of the meat is to be eaten at the grave, some taken home in apportioned bundles, and some left on the grave. This ideal is today far from realized at every burial, because of Soviet restrictions on killing work horses and reindeer. But since the animals are still considered important as vehicles to the after- world and as means of livelihood in afterlife, sometimes a cow or horse is killed anyway. Khanty still recall burials by the number of animals killed, as a reflection on the status and wealth of the deceased. For example, one Tegy matron boasted that two horses were killed at her father fs brother fs burial in the late 1960s. Eating and sharing of food with the dead is considered a crucial aspect of burial, which becomes "a little like a wedding," with plen- tiful meat and vodka. On the Upper Vakh River in 1957, Sokolova (1971:232) witnessed the sharing of drinks with the deceased: "An old woman poured out liquid from a cup of tea and a glass of wine, onto the ground near the coffin, saying 'drink, drink, old man, good tea, strong wine. f" Divining for the cause of death and to pre- dict the lifespans of living individuals also occurs at some traditional burials. Kazeem informants were somewhat evasive about this aspect of burial, saying that such things are especially common in other villages , not theirs. This caginess can be in part attrib- uted to the fact that shamans are supposed to preside over the divination.^ Methods of divination vary by locality, but a standard procedure is to raise the coffin on a pole be- fore its lid is nailed down. If the coffin is too heavy to move, the response to a question such as "Were you displeased with your wife?" is positive (Chernetsov 1963:30). In predict- ing longevity of mourners however, the person in question will live if the coffin is raised easily (Sokolova 1971:232) . Predictions are made first for the elders, then for younger males, and finally, for females. During divination, a Tegy friend confided, the diviner asks the body, "Why did you leave so early? Was your (shadow-material) soul maybe heavy?" This was done in Tegy as recently as 1976, at the grave of a progressive Khanty schoolteacher. After divination, a farewell is said to the deceased, with mourners stooping over the coffin to kiss the deceased in what may be a Russian Orthodox-influenced manifestation of mourning. The coffin lid is finally nailed, with birchbark and boards placed over it. Then each of the participants takes a turn at shovelling earth onto the grave, walking in a clockwise circle. A small "house" of boards is constructed on top, taking care to make a plugged hole or "window" that can be opened "for when the relatives come and feed the deceased" at future remembrance feasts. The top of the slanting house roof is made of five boards for men, and four for women. Once the basic grave is completed, grave goods too bulky to go into the coffin are placed on the grave. These may include rein- deer sleds, oars, boats, or skis which repre- sent possible transport options, depending on what the deceased used in life or what can be afforded. Each of these items is placed up- side down and is often purposely broken, since the goods are considered more useful this way, in a Northern land of the dead con- ceived to have an upside down and opposites orientation. A new development in Tegy and Kazeem is the occasional substitution of miniature sleds and oars, looking like children1 s toys, for the real items. This may reflect reluctance to part with important usable goods like sleds. These miniatures are definitely not placed on children !s graves, which are separate from the main graveyard, but on those of adults whose relatives rationalize that, in an inverted land of the dead, miniatures are good enough. The numerous items piled on top of graves reveal Khanty interest in covering all spiri- tual options. Thus Russian Orthodox crosses appear with purposefully broken sleds, skis, or boats. The graves of World War II heroes are decorated with plastic garlands strung around Soviet red stars - plus sleds, grave houses with windows, and reindeer skulls left 5Khanty shamans, like most Siberian shamans, are greatly revered and feared for their abil- ity to communicate with the supernatural world through trance, in order to cure by re- covering lost souls. Today such shamans have been driven underground by the Soviets, and are more feared than revered. Even before the revolution, a shaman's role at burials was secondary to that of family elders, and so the shaman has not been emphasized here. However, a shaman was, and is, considered better equipped to divine than an elder. When a shaman is not available, a patrilineal elder presides over divination. For further infor- mation on Khanty shamans, see Balzer ( 1979b :1- 2k) and Karjalainen (1927:305-382).</page><page sequence="7">Balzer: Siberian Khanty Burial Ritual 83 from burial sacrifices. The red star, however, is never combined with the Russian Orthodox cross (see figs. 2, 3). PARTING RITUAL, MOURNING, AND REMEMBRANCE When all the grave goods have been left in order, mourners leave the graveyard together. The Khanty of both Tegy and Kazeem alluded to the fear of being followed, saying that all must travel together so that their numbers would intimidate the soul-spirits of the deceased. In Tegy, the elders shout back to the dead that they must stay away from the village. Still further precautions are mentioned in the literature, including step- ping across a fire built on the path out of the graveyard, and blocking the exit road with a log or an axe (Sokolova 1971:233; Harva 196h:2k-, Karjalainen 1921:128). Once at home, mourners wash their hands, again fumigate the rooms that housed the deceased, jump across their hearth fire for purification from death, and carefully main- tain a steady hearth fire for the next four or five nights. This fire, according to a respected Tegy elder, is kept going so that the deceased will have "light in the next world." In Kazeem, one young man lamented that "some memories always remain in the house." For this reaspn, and in apprehension of the dead, some Khanty have traditionally preferred to abandon their homes. Near Kazeem, this was done as recently as the 1950s by reindeer- breeding tent dwellers, for whom it was rela- tively easy to move. In the 1920s some Khanty abandoned not only tents but cabins after a burial. For example, one Vakh River man moved 120 kilometers to a new house when his father died, while another moved seven kilometers after the death of his wife, although their former house had a valuable tin roof (Startsev 1928:127). This kind of moving clearly dis- rupts the life of a collective and cannot be easily tolerated in today1 s state-organized society. In the Soviet North, this impracti- cal step is now rare even for nomadic reindeer herders. Strict outward signs of mourning are, how- ever, still maintained for at least four or five days, depending on the sex of the de- ceased. People congregate, trying not to sleep, sing, or play. Men and women wear their hair loose, and, for forty or fifty days, women wear their scarves reversed. According to Chernetsov (1963:33), mourners should not go barefoot or gird their belts during the first days after burial, and knots and bands are prohibited, in order to make the journey of the dead "unhindered" (Harva 196^:27; Gondatti 1887:67). Mourning formerly prevented the Khanty from working on strenuous projects for at least four to five days, but now, according to Sokolova (1971:229), "this is nearly curtailed." Restrictions on remarriage for widowers and widows alike are still taken quite seriously, and last from one to two years in Tegy and Kazeem. (Earlier the norm was four years for widowers and five for widows . ) When a young Vakh River man violated the rule against re- marriage in 1950, he was vigorously condemned by influential patrilineal elders (Sokolova 1971:223). In some Khanty communities, a bereaved spouse traditionally spent four or five nights after burial at the graveside (Kharuzin 1905 :28U)'. The spouse is still expected to care solicitously for the de- ceased^ doll image, and to organize remem- brance feasts. Remembrance feasting continues in Tegy and Kazeem, despite Soviet propaganda against it. In principle, Khanty women have four main feasts, while men have five. Final feasts occur for women after forty days, and for men after fifty days. This may show syncretism with traditional Russian practice, since Orthodox wakes , called pominki^ end on the fortieth day after death. Although the timing and nature of the middle feasts vary today, the final feasts are strictly observed. Later remembrance rites can occur after a dream about the deceased, or after a year, if close relatives feel so inclined. Remembrance feasts usually begin at midday at the graveside, or occasionally in the home of the deceased's closest relatives. I witnessed preparations for remembrance feast- ing that featured dressing in holiday clothes, making a tobacco bundle for the deceased, and packing food and tea in birch containers. In Tegy I saw, but could not participate in, part of a graveside memorial, attended mostly by women and children. In Kazeem a young woman showed me how a deceased relative is awakened by burning matches at the window opening of the grave house, to begin the remembrance. The deceased is given small offerings of food, tea, wine, and vodka through this window, in the course of several hours of graveyard vigil. Frivolous songs are forbidden at such feasts, although improvised songs of mourning about the deceased are encouraged. A Tegy matron who attended a series of remembrance feasts in 1976 described the standard procedure: Everyone participating goes to the grave. Only the women cry. They sit around the campfire. All bring something, whoever, whatever, they can. The women wash them- selves, and then everyone sits together. They cook, eat, drink, and after the eating everyone then goes to their own relatives1 graves, kisses them, knocks at them, and then puts out tea and food to feed them. . . . All leave together.</page><page sequence="8">84 Arctic Anthropology XVII- 1 RUSSIAN ORTHODOX AND SOVIET INFLUENCES With the encouragement of Russian Orthodox priests and some Russian traders, settlers, and officials, the Khanty have learned to wash the "body of the deceased, to dig deeper graves necessitating a three to four day delay in burial, to make larehwood box coffins, and perhaps to give up stylized hair tearing and face scratching. Some now kiss the deceased farewell, place Russian Orthodox crosses on their graves, and follow a remembrance feast schedule similar in timing but not in content to Russian Orthodoxy. These adoptions, I would argue, are not fundamental changes; they do not disturb the content of Khanty beliefs about souls and afterlife. Despite Russian Orthodox pressures against sacrifice, divina- tion, and the making of dead doll images, the Khanty have continued these practices. The pressures of Sovietization are harder to withstand. First, there are today many more Russians in Tegy and Kazeem than there ever were. Most of these Russian fishermen, school- teachers, and technicians are not particularly politicized, but some of them are officials whose job it is to disabuse natives of thier supposed "superstitions." The Soviet Russians are especially concerned about Khanty shamans, sacrifices of good work or breeding animals , the so-called throwing away of usable grave goods, the absences from collective brigade work on account of mourning, and the changings of residence on account of death. Khanty have indeed adapted to pragmatic Soviet demands. They have also gradually lost some of their traditional emphasis on clan organization, and this may be in part reflected in modern burial ritual. Nonetheless, some Khanty continue to believe in reincarnation and an idealized afterlife where, according to a Kazeem fisher- man, "each nationality goes to its own place." CONCLUSION What elements of socio- cultural interaction have enabled the Khanty both to adapt to Sovietization and to maintain the traditional spirit of burial rituals? Two major factors can be isolated, one based on the concept of plural "social identities" and the other based on female conservatism. In order to understand the idea of plural social identities, as derived from Goodenough (1971:311), it is necessary to think of an individual as having multiple identities from which a few can be chosen for a given inter- action. Social identities thus are built from contextual choices of behavior which are related to actors1 culturally defined percep- tions of appropriate rights and duties. Al- though Goodenough uses this concept to study social dynamics within a given culture, I think it is particularly applicable to analyz- ing culture contact situations. When an individual Khanty today learns the roles that correspond to Soviet social identities (e.g., brigade leader), this does not mean that he or she automatically forgets traditional Khanty social identities. Indeed, Khanty are learning to act appropriately in different contexts: as Soviets in their brigades and at collective meetings, and as traditionalists in burial rituals. There is no simple opposition between a few young middlemen-progressives and old-folk conserva- tives. Instead, as I witnessed, the same individual can be a Communist Party member and also participate in a graveside remembrance feast. I believe the ability of Khanty to act as loyal Soviets can protect them from overt reprisals against some of their traditions. Although Khanty and Russian standards for behavior can be contradictory, many Khanty seem to cope with potential conflicts by com- partmentalizing Communist activities and ignoring some anti-religious propaganda. In addition, Khanty and Russian values are not always mutually exclusive. The young Khanty librarian who explained this to me is often reminded: "Not all were like your grandfather, bringing home much on the hunt, fighting in the Great Patriotic War (World War II), and know- ing legends." Excellence in each of these activities is valued by both Khanty and Russians. Soviet behavior is more frequently advanta- geous for men than for women. Men are expected to be particularly active in Commu- nist Party affairs and in the local economic hierarchy of brigade leadership. Female political activism is possible, but has not been encouraged by the Soviets until recently. For this external reason, and also because Khanty women themselves tend to be the up- holders of traditional values, women are less likely to learn new Soviet social identities. Women indeed have the most trouble adjusting to collective brigade work and can avoid work- ing for collectives more easily than men. We can therefore see that in communities like Tegy and Kazeem, there is likely to be a continuum of adjustment to new social identi- ties, with older women being the least adapt- able to change. A few examples graphically illustrate female conservatism. Older women are con- spicuous in insisting upon strict ritual maintenance. It is they who most faithfully attend remembrance feasts, make doll images of the dead, and preside over the naming cere- monies that identify reincarnation souls in newborn Khanty children. Many older women wear traditional dresses as badges of Khanty- ness, refuse to attend Russian films, and</page><page sequence="9">Balzer: Siberian Khanty Burial Ritual 85 speak very little Russian. Some older and middle-aged women are known to understand Russian, but prefer not to use it. Even some young women hide their faces with scarves before male in-laws, in traditional avoidance custom. These young women may well, as they grow older, increase their participation in life crisis rituals, as has been the tradi- tional Khanty pattern (Balzer 1978:1-12). In summary, Khanty women appear to be a strong force for maintenance of traditional ritual, concepts of the sacred, and ethnic identity. Despite female conservatism, burial ritual has itself gradually been changing. We need, therefore, to examine its symbolic signifi- cance as a whole, as both an inculcator of traditional values like reincarnation and as a potential forum for reflecting cultural change and value reorient at ion. When new generations of Khanty are taught that the sub- stitution of a miniature sled for a usable large one on a grave is acceptable to the dead, the message may well be that to survive as a Khanty is to adapt. Although this seems like a paradox, we know that tradition is relative.</page><page sequence="10">86 Arctic Anthropology XVII-1 Fig. 2.
