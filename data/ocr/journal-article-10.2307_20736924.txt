<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Essays Observations of Another Trotline Runner: A Critical Discussion ofD. L. BirchfieWs Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test: New and Collected Elemen tary, Epistolary, Autobiographical, and Oratorical Choctologies (1998) by the Choctaw writer D.L. Birchfield is a rarity in the publishing world. It is a work that conforms to American Indian compositional principles, not to Euroamerican rhetorical imperatives. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test advances ideas, and even entire chapters, in ways that are more paratactic than hypotactic, a method which in Eric Havelock's view of language privileges the paratactic, or oral quality of a work, over its hypotactic or post oral characteristics. In this work, arguments are not prioritized or ranked. Neither are they schematized or overburdened with definition and qualification. Cause and effect are generally left to the reader's imagination. Since hypotaxis, or subordina tion, is minimized, all portions of the book contribute equally to the work's totality. The final chapter simply reiterates the first. Intervening chapters restate others in widely divergent ways. Chapters can be read in any order without loss of continuity or meaning. This paratactic form, revealed in the work's content, suggests that The Oklahoma Basic Intel ligence Test has some kinship to works in the American Indian oral tradi tion, and a close reading of the work reinforces that analysis. Birchfield's controlling metaphor for The Oklahoma Basic Intelli gence Test is trotline setting. A trotline is a long fishing line strung across a river or section of a lake. On the trotline hang numerous smaller lines,</page><page sequence="2">Review Essays 67 which are baited so that one person can catch, or as the Choctaws say, kill many fish at one time. In some places, trotlines are illegal and are consequently "run" at night. Our narrator's lines are baited with live perch, not dead bait, so they are first class, premium lines and presumably legal. In Birchfield's book, all the chapters hang on one continuous the matic line, the betrayal of the Choctaw Nation by the United States. The smaller lines are all connected to the trotline and supply it with a quite varied "catch." It is fair to say that The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is a work of nonfiction that satisfies like real fiction. It has a plethora of characters, but no character development. Characters and themes transform but do not ripen into finely drawn studies or disquisitions of incremental intellectual maturity. Characters and themes are mature at the onset. They have their say and then move on. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is marginal discourse that draws on Choctaw tradition to make its case. That this volume got pub lished is a marvel, since most American Indian works that do observe American Indian narrative practices find their way to the reject heap, not to B. Dalton's. That it was published by a press that promotes American Indian works perhaps explains this particular publication phenomenon. In his review of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test in the Fall issue of Studies in American Indian Literatures (1998), Robert Conley (Cherokee) relates that his initial reaction to Birchfield's suggested plan of organization was that the "idea was totally insane. It would not be a collection. Rather it would be a mad hodge-podge of unrelated, discon nected individual items" (95). Upon seeing the completed version, Conley reversed his position and wrote that the completed manuscript "worked brilliantly." It belongs, he continued, to that category of Native literature which most troubles non-native readers, editors, and literary critics, that peculiarly Native category of Momaday, Silko and Vizenor. It's a category in which the writer cre ates his own genre with each book he writes. (95) At first glance, The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test does appear to be a collection of unrelated essays, autobiography, war stories, fishing sto ries, hunting tales, poems, letters, histories, literary criticism, and social commentaries ranging from a comparative study of dictionaries to an in quiry into the appropriateness of Oliver La Farge's first dedicatory note for Laughing Boy. The essays, written in prose, poetry, and occasional</page><page sequence="3">68 SAIL 11.3 Fall 1999 trickster discourse, wander from recipes for stove-top blackberry dump lings to a critique of Lonesome Dove. The essays are punctuated with encomia to Pushmataha and catcalls for the decision of Robert Maynard Hutchins and Mortimer Adler to abolish football at the University of Chi cago. The essays speak not only to readers, but to other published works as well. The book is a self-conscious literary work that derives from the American Indian oral tradition, speaks to the Euroamerican literary tradi tion, while adhering to the principles of Choctaw story telling and ceremo nial life. In an interview, the Reverend Mr. Randy Jacob, a Choctaw scholar from Broken Bow, Oklahoma, explains that the well composed American Indian text is designed to confuse the hearer or reader. In the oral tradi tion, good story tellers do not tell all of the story. The hearer/reader must supply the missing parts of a narrative and comprehend the point of the work by means of his or her own intellectual efforts. For this reason, many oral works do not move along a chronological plot line in which first one event happens and then another. Works in the oral tradition seldom dem onstrate cause and effect. Events transpire, and the hearer/reader must infer possible cause and effect, significance, and chronology if such cat egories are necessary for comprehending the meaning of a narrative. Since a narrative assumes different meanings as the interpretative abilities of the hearer/reader change with age and experience, narrative, like the hearer/ reader, stays in a constant state of interpretative motion. All this is not to say that there is no truth to a story; it is to say, however, that truth or meaning must be perceived by a Choctaw in his own time and in his own way. It goes without saying that writing a piece of literary criticism that interprets a work violates principles of Choctaw epistemology, since the hearer/reader must do his or her own independent thinking. Because literary critics, Indian and non-Indian, are enmeshed in a publish or perish Catch 22, this Cherokee critic will write and hope that Choctaw readers will overlook the inappropriate activity. Without doubt, Choctaw readers will offer their own responses to this text. Many modern American Indian publications take much of their form and content from works in the American Indian oral tradition. Cases in point range from journalistic essays such as Alexander Posey's early twen tieth century Fus Fixico letters to novels like Leslie Silko's Ceremony (1977) or Irvin Morris' From the Glittering World (\991). Like their arche typal models, these works usually contain creation accounts, land narra tives, animal narratives, hero or warrior reports, and a trickster component. Like the sacred ceremonies they emulate, these modern writings pay spe</page><page sequence="4">Review Essays 69 cial attention to the power and importance of words. Portions of such narratives are written in poetry, the language of orality. Like the early sacred narratives, such works also honor the directions, the earth, and the beings that inhabit the earth. In addition to their entertainment function, these modern narratives are twentieth-century verbal ceremonies which have a serious intent. The novels cited above refute the image of the demoralized American Indian and make a case for the continuance of American Indian sacred traditions in the modem world. The Fixico letters uphold the efficacy and integrity of the old ways as compared to the chicanery and duplicity of the dominant society. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test takes its place within this genre of works inspired by the spirit and intent of the oral tradition. Birchfield has structured his book into four parts. Four is a weighted number for Indians, since that number symbolically gives geographic and social definition to a piece in terms of land, living creatures, and direction. In addition to representing the four directions, the number four refers to the four stages in the life of man?infancy, childhood, adulthood, and old age. It also represents the four species of life on earth?the four leggeds, the two leggeds, the birds, and the fish. Four symbolizes the four seasons and the four races?black, white, brown, and red. Since direction cannot logically be separated from the land, the two can be considered metonymic. In Choctaw thinking, land cannot be disengaged from people. In a conversation with me in 1998, Betty Jacob, Choctaw linguist and scholar also from Broken Bow, explains that: the name Oklahoma is two Choctaw words joined together. Okla means "people" and homa means "red." It is not necessary to add a word to the agglutinate Oklahoma meaning "land" because Choctaws feel that setting a foot anywhere on the earth's surface makes them part of the land beneath them. Birchfield's quadripartite compositional structure immediately suggests that the work will contain themes directly related to land and people. The introductory matter of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test confirms these suspicions. The first written section, "Elementary Choctology," defines the subject as Choctaws and gives two very differ ent views of their nature. These differing observations were made by the same person, Kerleric, Governor of French Louisiana in 1753 and in 1754. The first perspective indicates that the Choctaws are "true to their plighted faith." The latter maintains that the Choctaws are "covetous, lying, and</page><page sequence="5">70 SAIL 11.3 Fall 1999 treacherous." That Choctaws have been true to their plighted faith in regard to their dealings with the United States is the main theme of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test. That they are "covetous, lying, and treacherous" suggests that trickster dialogue will occasionally befuddle the narrative, but Birchfield, with his coinage of the word Choctology, clearly intimates that the trickster attitude should not obscure the major thrust of the work. Perhaps as in the hymn, "Doxology," Birchfield's "Choctology" is indicating that The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is essentially a song of praise to Choctaws, and the word further suggests that a connection is being made between The Oklahoma Basic Intelli gence Test and works of an ancient and sacred nature. The "Doxology," which derives from the Geneva Psalter, 1551, is a hymn used at most religious observances by Protestants of the Reformed traditions. Once Birchfield has clearly established that Choctaws are the sub ject of his book, he moves to the next important feature of an American Indian work?the creation account. The second written section, or "Choctology 101," details the emergence of the Choctaws from Nanih Wayih, their Mother Mound in the lower Mississippi valley. The Choctaws are the world's oldest people; they were the last to emerge from the sacred mound and were allowed to live near it. It was there they received the gift of corn and the knowledge to cultivate it. The third introductory section of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test, "Intermediate Choctology," reiterates the importance of place by making explicit the land narrative suggested earlier. Geographic locations are specifically named, e.g., Oklahoma, Rich Mountain, and Black Mesa. In American Indian works the land is never just a background for a plot; to a large extent, the land narrative informs the plot. In American Indian literature, land generates the narrative. Land, permeated with the essential essences of the creating divinities, is the place where everything begins. A land narrative prescribes a work's major themes. As the interpretative center of the work, the land narrative reflects the truth of the story. Char acters lie. Narrators are forgetful and sometimes suspect. The land is constant and is the most reliable of all narrators. This third introductory section, which sets in motion the land narra tive, also introduces the reader to the importance of words, particularly the importance of Choctaw words as it advances the theme that Choctaw talk, and everything that implies, is central to this book's meaning. "When the Choctaws talk from the top of Rich Mountain, you have to go all the way to the panhandle to find anywhere in Oklahoma where anyone can do any taller talking" (6).</page><page sequence="6">Review Essays 71 That we are going to be presented with "tall" talking suggests that the subject matter of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test will have "stature," or importance. It further implies that the talking will be "tall" in a metaphorical sense as in folk tale or "tall tale" or fable. At no point, however, will the humor of the tall talk undercut the work's serious nature. In Ancestral Voice: Conversations with N. Scott Momaday by Charles L. Woodard (1989), the Kiowa writer says that "the humorous element [of language] is one of the chief manifestations of a defensive attitude. Hu mor is really where the language lives_It's very close to the center, and very important" (31). Part 1 of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test begins with a quiz, again perhaps reminiscent of Momaday's practice of beginning his classes with trivia games (Velie 101). Birchfield's quiz, "The Oklahoma Basic Intel ligence Test: Are You Smart Enough To Be An Okie?", serves as a humor ous overview of the themes he will develop in the book, particularly those of land defilement, words, sports, treaties, and people. Following the introductory quiz, with its amusing questions and wry answers, is a poem, "Have You Heard About America?" This verse serves as the serious summation of one of the book's central themes, the abrogation of all trea ties made between the Choctaw Nation and the United States. First they want to be your friends1 Then they want to build a wagon road through where your live2 Then they want you to move3 Then they want to build a railroad through where they moved you to4 Then they want to move in with you5 Then they want you to keep quiet and stay out of their way while they tell the world that ever since then your nation has been past tense The footnotes refer to the 1786,1801,1830,1866, and 1907 treaties with the Choctaws, all of which were broken by the United States. This poem and</page><page sequence="7">72 SAIL 11.3 Fall 1999 the following chapter, "Using and Misusing History," underscore the two major themes of the book, the betrayals of the Choctaw Nation by the United States and the distortion of American Indian history by advocacy journalism and popular American fiction, two genres that obscure the realities of the betrayals. To make his point about the misrepresentation of American Indian history, Birchfield cites several cases of careless historical citations and ambiguous dictionary definitions which, in his words, "refer to the past in terms of the present" (23). Such "trickster" reporting undermines accu racy, and with accuracy undermined, fallacies proliferate. For example, Birchfield says that, in an entry about Choctaws, The American Indian Almanac (for which he gives no bibliographic citation) states that "After being forced to cede their lands in Mississippi and Alabama and to move to Oklahoma, the Choctaws established their own government" (23). Birchfield explains that in 1830 there was really no such place as "Okla homa." A certain territory west of the Mississippi would be designated Oklahoma Territory in 1890 and a state named Oklahoma would enter the Union in 1907. Prior to 1890, however, there was no Oklahoma, so Choctaws technically could not have been removed there. Actually, the Choctaws were moved to what would become Indian Territory, not Oklahoma Territory, so there is yet another error in The American Indian Almanac's sentence; furthermore, Choctaws had a gov ernment before they were removed to the West, but the sentence as it stands implies that they did not. In one simple entry, there are three major errors that distort tribal organization, geographical polity, and historical reality. These distortions, which seem to be innocent historical summa ries, may seem innocuous, but they are not. Choctaws were settled, agri cultural people with well developed governments at contact. They were not wanderers in search of a viable political system and a home. Birchfield's succeeding chapters emphasize the dangers of advocacy journalism by underlining the power of words. Traditional American Indi ans tend to believe in the efficacy of words, particularly Native words. Joseph Epes Brown, in I Become Part Of It: Sacred Dimensions in Native American Life (1992), writes that in American Indian languages "the un derstanding is that the meaning is in the sound, it is in the word: the word is not a symbol for a meaning which has been abstracted out, word and meaning are together in one experience" (13). As N. Scott Momaday points out in his monograph, "The Native Voice," which appears in the Columbia Literary History of the United States (1988), "language is sacred [and] words ... bring about physical change" (7).</page><page sequence="8">Review Essays 73 Given these conceptions, it is easy to see why Birchfield devotes so much space in The Test to dictionaries, word meanings, lexicographical reliability, and Choctaw words. Words, particularly Native words, em power a text. They give a work authority and sustainability. By the same token, words used in an indiscriminate or "trickster" way weaken a text, make possible inaccurate readings, create ambiguities, and violate the intent of a work. It is ambiguous word choice that sustains advocacy journalism, which in turn undermines the truth about American Indians, their cultures, and their history. Inappropriate words create damage and chaos. To protect his manuscript and empower it, to send it out as a state ment of truth about the unwavering military loyalty of the Choctaw Nation to the United States in the face of broken treaty after broken treaty, Birchfield includes a medicine chapter, or a chapter given over to a narra tive of the old ways of the Choctaws expressed in the Choctaw language. This portion of the book, "Obalaka Apistikeli Is Hard to Find," recalls the ancient times of the Choctaws when they hunted, emigrated, or sent out war parties with the assistance of a pelichi bina, or camp leader who was accompanied by an obalaka apistikeli, or guardian from behind. The leader and the person guarding the backtrail also had a scout, the tikba pisa, to check out the area surrounding the group's movement and be on guard for surprise ambushes. The fourth essential person in a scouting party was the honi bina, or camp cook, who always left out food each night for the obalaka apistikeli. It is for tikba pisa to range far ahead and from side to side, to learn what lies ahead, and to find his way to his hot supper and dry bed at the bina before dark. It is for obalaka apistikeli to guard the backtrail and be hard to find. It is for honi bina to tend the fire and cook. It is for pelichi bina to do some great thing. (51) Birchfield's medicine text emphasizes danger and the execution of great deeds. Thematically this chapter underscores much of the book's con tent, which relates the works of Choctaw leaders, heroes, and warriors like Pushmataha, Muscokubi, Homassatubbee, Yockonahoma, Tobocoh, Aiahokatubbe, and Puckshennubbe. These names give power, strength, integrity, and authority to his text. The persons so named stand in stark relief to the villains recounted by this text, men such as Major Earl Van</page><page sequence="9">74 SAIL 11.3 Fall 1999 Dorn of the United States Cavalry who "attacked and destroyed a joint encampment of Wichitas and Comanches near the present town of Rush Springs, [Texas]" (146) or Texas Ranger Captain John Ford who "crossed the Red River into present-day Oklahoma, and, in the early morning hours of May 12, 1858, attacked without warning and destroyed a Comanche village... killing seventy-six people" (145). To achieve some sexual balance in his work, Birchfield's text does not forget women and their efforts to preserve American Indian culture and tradition. He devotes space to the Choctaw historian, Anna Lewis, who published a work on Pushmataha, and to the Euroamerican historian Angie Debo who devoted a lifetime to writing about American Indians and their sufferings at the hands of the United States. In addition to setting the historical record straight in matters of Ameri can Indian affairs, Birchfield takes on the fictional record as well. Of great significance is the fact that The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test speaks to many other texts produced by popular American culture. Writers of American Indian literature, with few possible exceptions, rarely engage Euroamerican writers in literary dialogue in their works. They sometimes "speak" to one another, but rarely do they allude to, praise, attack, or even recognize the works of Euroamericans. Birchfield initiates both literary conversation and confrontation; he makes the basic point that American Indians write American literature. High on Birchfield's list of novels that fail to portray American Indi ans with either accuracy or humanity is Larry McMurtry' s Lonesome Dove and its portrait of Blue Duck, the work's ostensible villain. McMurtry's bad Indian perpetuates the stereotype of the murderous, red skinned ren egade who kills innocent white settlers randomly and purposelessly. Such stereotypes are largely unfaithful to American history and are insulting to American Indian people. These stereotypes partly derive from the falla cies of historians such as Frederick Jackson Turner and Walter Prescott Webb, a historian who reported with "glee... the genocidal activities of the Texas Rangers against Indians" (139). Historians like Webb and Turner, and the many unnamed writers of dictionary and encyclopedia entries, distort American Indian history, tradition, and cultural practices to the extent that most Americans, or Oklahomans writ large, have false concep tions of American Indian people and their lives. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is not critical of all Euroamerican writers. In Birchfield's view, Joan Didion comes across quite well. "[W]e bonded in spirit" (130). Similarly he has accolades for Steve Frazee, Jim Kjelgaard, Stephen Meader, and Lew Dietz, writers of</page><page sequence="10">Review Essays 75 juvenile outdoor fiction. He is undecided about Tony Hillerman, familiar with Tom Robbins, and noncommittal about Thomas Harris. He tells us that he reads The Daily Oklahoman, Sports Afield, Lucas on Bass Fish ing, and the Encyclopedia Britannica. He is familiar with the Oklahoma State Constitution, Charles Kappler's Laws and Treaties, Macbeth, and "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock." All this literary title dropping underlines his point that he is an American, an educated American, and a Choctaw American who sees himself as part of the Euroamerican literary tradition. He is a contributor to that tradition, and a spokesman for it. Like most American Indians, he does not see himself as the mute Savage Other, but instead sees himself, and other Indians, as part and parcel of the American experience?literary, social, and political. The oxymoronic Okla homa Basic Intelligence Test is really The Ordinary American Basic In telligence Test of Indian Americana. It examines the American reading public's awareness of Indian affairs and publishes its findings. It is not too surprising that scores are low given the less-than-accu rate writing practices of historians and fiction writers, but The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test does not stop with noting the gaps in the Ameri can public's knowledge of Indians. It corrects part of that unawareness by imparting interesting and little known information about various Na tions and their leaders. In other words, it provides a cure for the national illness. It is a type of lighthearted healing ceremony, and its humorous remarks show a literary kinship to Alexander Posey's Fus Fixico Letters and to some of Will Roger's acerbic witticisms. It is common for many North American Indian Nations to begin im portant ceremonies with games. Stickball games, played by men, women, and children, precede the sacred stomp dances for members of the Five Tribes of which the Choctaws are a part. They serve to bring the commu nity together in exercise and good will before beginning the religious ceremonies of the evening. The games help insure a good turnout for the stomp dances, and they emphasize notions of communal effort, physical skill, cunning, and fun. The physical exercise clears the mind and prepares the body for the serious portion of the ceremony. The games rite, in theory if not always in practice, is the prelude to the prayer rite. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test devotes much space to com mentaries on football, football coaches and players, football stadiums, and football games. It rattles off old scores and statistics. It summarizes a history of the split T formation and the men who developed it. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test also chronicles the author's own foot ball playing days. All this sports talk serves a purpose in constructing</page><page sequence="11">76 SAIL 11.3 Fall 1999 either a serious, Euroamerican, literary work or a ceremonial, American Indian work. The sports scores, statistics, playing fields, and the like replicate the massacre stories, statistics, participants, and locations. They provide an untroubled echo of the war stories. Combat and attack strate gies in war and diversion mirror each other. The sports talk performs the same function for Birchfield's ritual text that sports activity contributes to ceremonial life. It is not a needless distraction from the main themes of the work, but is a necessary part of the whole. The sports talk gives perspec tive to life and to life's concerns. Broken treaties cannot consume present day American Indians; play and community action have to mitigate the suffering. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test, like Leslie Silko's Cer emony or N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn, is a medicine text, a work which partially reproduces an ancient ceremony and provides for healing or restoration. Unlike these high mimetic works, The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is perhaps low mimetic form. It appears to be casual and at times lighthearted, but its thematic core and its structure indicate its serious intent. Like a medicine text, or sacred ceremony from the oral tradition, The Test includes poetry in its composition. In much sacred literature, works like the Christian Bible for example, poetry often points to older sections of the Scriptures. In Birchfield's text, the poetry provides the same func tion. It metaphorically creates an "older" text that is contrapuntal to the "newer" just as the creation account and the medicine chapter stand in relief to chapters detailing the Ada High School football stadium or the author's reluctance to mow his mother's yard, a chapter that "speaks" to the writer's need for a place to work that is not interrupted by demands of the world. Much of The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is given over to fishing and hunting stories which serve several purposes. They give dimension and specificity to the land narrative that runs through the book. These chapters also expand one of Birchfield's minor themes?the des ecration of the American landscape. The narrator fishes in the Muddy Boggy, one of the few rivers in Oklahoma that have not been dammed by the Army Corps of Engineers. He hunts over land that had once belonged to his grandfather but is now changed. "Somebody had bulldozed all the timber across the road in front of Granddad's place. We had intended to camp in that timber" (62). The land narrative and terrain spoiling come together in many chapters. One of the most notable is the one in which the narrator relates that he is trying to find a new place to hunt during deer season:</page><page sequence="12">Review Essays 11 I finally found it, in the upper watershed of the Kiamichi River, in the Ouachita National Forest of southern LeFlore County in southeast ern Oklahoma, a completely hidden valley, nestled along the side of Winding Stair Mountain, tucked away behind Lenox Ridge. (73) As he hunts in this area he runs across beer cans and other rubbish. Continuing his pursuit of game he finds: Not just beer cans, but all kind of trash, candy wrappers, pop bottles, an old mattress, piles of complete and utter yuk. Then I heard traffic, the unmistakable whine of automobiles whizzing by at high speed. Then I heard voices. I climbed up onto a modern two-lane highway. (78) What once had been part of the Choctaw Nation is now a scenic highway going nowhere. Included also in The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test are several trickster narratives. Trickster tales are integral parts of many American Indian medicine works, so it is appropriate to find several in this narrative. The most obvious trickster tale in The Test is the chapter entitled "To His Honor the Governor," which is satiric writing directed at books, movies, and journals that relate accounts of European heroes trekking through jungles and outwitting hostile natives in order to perform some romantic mission. It spoofs a wide variety of print and film materials ranging from early journals of the Conquistadors, to David Livingstone's Narrative of an Expedition to the Zansibar and Its Tributaries (1865), to Heart of Darkness (1902), to The African Queen (1935), to Anacondar(1997). Trick ster themes work steadily through The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test in episodes such as the narrator's tricking his brother into going hunting in a snow storm and then having the process reversed when the narrator himself is tricked into thinking he has found the perfect hunting ground when in fact the area is quite public and adjoins a scenic highway. Humor pervades the The Basic Oklahoma Intelligence Test. We see it working when the narrator tricks his nephew into buying a dictionary he really doesn't want and we find it again in the "tricking" of the Choctaws by the United States. Trickster mechanisms culminate in the book's final chapter which discusses the Treaty of Camp Holmes (1835), a trickster's masterpiece that takes land from non-owners, gives it to non-deservers, and reserves right-of-way for Those-Who-Couldn't-Care-Less-and-Were</page><page sequence="13">78 SAIL 11.3 Fall 1999 Unlikely-Even-to-Hear-About-the-Transfer. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test incorporates many other at tributes of American Indian ceremonial writing. It carries within it a stra tum of text devoted to animal life. In addition to the enormous catfish, which are the animal text's main characters, there are mosquitoes and Kitty, eighteen squirrels, carefully described, and a whitetail buck. Round ing out the cast are a hound, a mutt, and five wild turkeys, slightly para noid. This animal life adds realistic detail to the land narrative and brings to mind the animal and insect characters in many American Indian creation accounts and legends. When the talking anthropomorphic catfish/Choctaw manages to get out of the narrator's live box without serious damage to his person, we have an animal commentary on Birchfield's major theme. Some where in the murky regions of the Muddy Boggy not too far from the McGee Valley in the southeastern portion of what is now Oklahoma, this particular catfish lives to tell another tale and trick another fisherman. The big, crafty, catfish/Choctaw is not the Vanishing Catfish of American leg end, but is the modern survivor. The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test is not just a journalistic fish ing expedition or a Choctaw version of The Compleat Angler, but as its warrior narratives and medicine chapter suggest, it is a war party bent on setting the record straight. It opposes the fictions of the modern world concerning American Indian history and refutes them in a way that is at once serious but decidedly engaging. It brings to light some heretofore little known facts and enters them into the modern red-white dialogue. Betty Booth Donohue WORKS CITED Conley, Robert J. "The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test."
