<plain_text><page sequence="1">Huang Lao Thought and the Huainanzi* MICHAEL LOEWE The Huainanzi ^ ^g -^ is a corporate work which was compiled at the court of the king of Huainan, being first presented to the imperial throne in 139 b.c., and possibly receiving certain additions between then and 122 b.c. For various reasons, however, the book did not meet with the same type of acclaim that had accompanied other texts. By the eleventh century at least, the comments of Xu Shen ?^p'|jj| (c 55-149) and Gao You f? ^ (c. 168-212) had been fused together into a single set of notes. The book attracted the critical attention of Su Song jj?jfc ^(1020-1101), and then that of some of the most notable scholars of the Qing period, such as Wang Niansun 3E ^ B? (I744~I^32), Huang Peilie U? 352^ (1763-1825) and Gu Guangqi || Jjg iff (1776-1835). In the early days of western sinology the work evaded the attention of scholars such as Legge and Couvreur who necessarily followed the lead of their Chinese masters and fastened on what they regarded as the basic texts of traditional learning, i.e. mainly the classical texts and the Confucian teachers, and the Daodejing. It is only in the latter part of the twentieth century that western scholars have felt ready to examine, appraise and translate parts of the Huainanzi, and the results may be seen in the writings of Eva Kraft (1957-58), Benjamin Wallacker (1962), Roger Ames (1983), Charles Le Blanc (1985), Hal Roth (1992), Claude Larre (1993) and now John Major.1 Further research in the future will be immeasurably improved and brought to new standards thanks to the publication of the concordance to the text by D. C. Lau (1992). In a recent volume, John Major presents a translation of three chapters that other scholars have not treated, except for an unpublished draft by Herbert Chatley, and Erkes's version of chapter 4. Quite apart from its consideration of early Chinese ideas of cosmology, his study raises a number of interconnected questions that are of fundamental importance in tracing the development of Chinese thought. These include the propriety of adhering to well-established terms which, hallowed as they may be in sinological tradition, may yet be misleading ; the validity o? assigning the Huainanzi to a particular school or group of thinkers ; the meanings that properly attach to the terms fa and fajia ; the significance of Huang Lao thought in the philosophies of the pre-Qin and early * A review article of John S.

At the cost of over-simplification, Major's thesis may be summarised as noting the points of similarity between parts of the Huainanzi and those particular manuscripts from Mawangdui JH 3E t?t tnat have been described as the classical texts of Huang Lao ; regarding the Huainanzi as deriving from Huang Lao thought ; and interpreting chapters 3-5 as a statement of cosmological theory that formed an integral, but hitherto unrecognised, element of that thought. Considerable progress has been made in the last few decades in distinguishing the different elements that have been embraced under the general terms of "Confucianism", "Daoism" and "Legalism", and it is within this major context that the significance of the Huainanzi is being re-examined. Basic questions have in fact been raised regarding the significance of those terms and the different elements of thought that they comprise. In particular it has been recognised that, just as Dong Zhongshu J[ ^ ^ (c. 179-c. 104 b.c.) had done much to formulate Han Confucianism at a stage long past the time of Confucius, when the new conditions of the imperial age required a re-assessment of the ethical precepts that applied five centuries earlier, so too it has been accepted that several different approaches to life should be discriminated within the general term of Daoism. While comprising much that had been seen in earlier texts such as the Laozi, Zhuangzi or other less well-known or preserved writings, the Huainanzi also includes a number of strands of thought which developed from a world view, or cosmology, that had been emerging after their time. It need hardly be stressed that this stage in turn would be followed by a whole variety of new departures, notably that of the religious sects of Daoism on the one hand and the Neo-Confucian modes of thought on the other ; it may however be noted that Major for one rejects the old distinction between "Philosophical Daoism" of the pre-Han period and the "Religious Daoism" of the late Eastern Han and beyond (p. 10). Two recent interconnected developments have stimulated attention to the Huainanzi; the discovery of the famous set of manuscripts at Mawangdui, of 168 b.c., and the suggestion that some of them derived from Huang Lao thought ; and the realisation of the significant part played by Huang Lao thought in the early decades of Former Han. In so far as they included not only copies of known texts, but also those of some that had not been seen previously, the manuscripts have given rise to considerable scholarly activity, including textual criticism, a review of the bibliographical history of certain writings such as the Laozi, and a review of the classification of much of China's early literature. For the texts long predate the work of Liu Xiang g?j fp] (79-8 B.c.), Liu Xin gijg^ (46 B.c.-A.D. 23) and Cai Yong || g| (a.d. 133-92) in setting up such categories and establishing the standardised version of China's traditional literature. That there had been a number of devotees of Huang Lao thought in high places in public life had long been known ; but it is only recently that the extent of this cult has come to be recognised, as may be seen in a recently published list of those who are mentioned in this connection in the Shiji and Han shu.2 So far as the Huainanzi is concerned, attention has focused on four of the texts that precede copy B of the Laozi which are entitled Jingfa |g gj, Shiliujing -|-/^ ||, Cheng 2 See Vervoorn, p. 268, note 31.</page><page sequence="3">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 379 $? and Dao yuan Jg Jj^. Writing shortly after the discovery of the texts, Tang Lan (1974) identified them with an item which is named Huangdi si jing ^ ^ |7g |g being listed in Han shu 30 (p. 1730) as a work of 4 pian, under the category of Daojia. This identification, elaborated in Tang Lan (1975), has been followed and accepted with varying degrees of certainty by a number of scholars, some of whom are anxious to relate the mode of thought and the principles of the texts with the more general schools, known as Daoist or Legalist. Thus Tang Lan and Cheng Wu associate the texts with a legalist framework; writing as they were towards the close of the campaign to " Criticise Lin Biao and criticise Confucius". They may perhaps have been subject to the influence of the times, when both Jia Yi jf f^and Wang Chong 3? ~f? were being described as legalists.3 Tang Lan saw the texts as originating in Zheng H?, being taken over by Han |?, c. 300 B.c.; Long Hui, however, believed them to be the product of Chu ^. Both Tang Lan and Cheng Wu were anxious to pursue the thought that Legalism had derived from a Daoist base, and saw the newly-found texts as illustrating this thesis. Tang Lan dates the manuscripts between 179 and 168, but this need not imply that the original compilation was not earlier, and there is reason to believe that in some form or other the text had been circulating in the latter part of the Zhanguo period. His identification of the work within the Huang Lao school is backed by the references to xing ming jf\j ^, a set of ideas that took prime place therein. Protagonists of xing ming insisted on the need for statements, descriptions and promises to correspond with reality and practice. The link between this mode of thought and Huang Lao is affirmed in the Shiji's account of Shen Buhai ^3^=1^ and Han Fei.4 A distinction from the outlook of the Laozi is seen in at least one crucial aspect. While the writings in question are able to contemplate an explanation of Dao as being possible, the Laozi is unable to do so. Uniquely, one of the four texts (Shiliujing) includes accounts of Huangdi's consultation with his assistants, as will be seen below, together with a reference to the four-sided mask which provided him with all round vision. Inclusion of some of these concepts and nearly identical passages has suggested that the Huainanzi should be similarly classified as deriving from a, or the, Huang Lao school. Major summarises (p. 12) his reasons for taking the Huainanzi as a whole and the three chapters that he treats (nos. 3?5) individually as part of the Huang Lao tradition on the basis of Dao's universal application, its generative power and complete nature; Dao's place in the cosmic order, comprising as that does both the world of nature and that of mankind; the need for royal government, which is essential to human order, to conform with the natural order; the true king's possession of penetrating insight; the balance and strength that is achieved when the king's government is in conformity with Dao. In this way, the Huainanzi derives from Huang Lao thought and supplies its cosmological elements. Of equal importance, the text was written to explain to the ruler what he needs to know if his government is to be successful. Different views, with a somewhat different emphasis have been expressed by other scholars. Writing in 1979, Tu Wei-ming did not feel able to accept Tang Lan's identification for certain. In recognising the unified pattern of the four texts, he selected E.g. by Cheng Wu; see Wen wu 1974. 10, pp. 43, 45. 4 Shiji 62, p. 2146.</page><page sequence="4">38o Michael Loewe (pp. I02f.) four subjects as being critical for an understanding of their content, i.e. (a) Dao, as ultimate reality or non-reality, whose meaning is to be applied with a deliberate purpose rather than as a vehicle for contemplation, and which provides a universal model (fa g)~) and pattern (H 3H) for a monarch to follow; (b) while fa and //, as deriving from Dao, provide a monarch with a system of regularity to which he must accommodate, Huang Lao thought is not to be seen as legalistic, in so far as it does not prescribe regulations or sanctions ; (c) it is essential for the true monarch to practise guan j|l i.e. a view of the inner workings of the universe ; and (d) the idea of balance |f? must be seen in the context of Daoist rather than legalist ideas; by accommodating to this basic principle, the true monarch will follow the laws of nature and refrain from initiating any arbitrary actions. Major's view of the relationship between Huang Lao and legalism is set forth as follows (P-9): In all of this, the assumption has been that the term Huang-Lao associates Legalism (whether of the Hanfeizi "punishments and rewards" or of the Shen Buhai "technocratic" variety), or at least state centralism, with Huangdi, while its Daoist elements derive from Laozi. Something is missing from the picture, however, and I believe that the missing piece is supplied by a proper understanding of the cosmological chapters of the Huainanzi. In my view, Huangdi stands not only for a Legalist, or statist, approach to government, but also for the integration of cosmology into political theory. If the leading candidates for exemplars of Huang-lao thought are the Mawangdui corpus, the Guanzi (or at least major portions thereof) and the Huainanzi, it becomes a matter of significance that Huangdi is represented in some of those texts (e.g. Wuxingzhan, Huainanzi 3-5) as a thearch whose astral projection is identified with the planet Saturn and whose ritual emblems refer as much to a cosmological as to a political centre. These considerations prompt the suggestion that due thought should be given to the continued use of the three key terms that recur in most writings on Chinese political thought, i.e. Confucianism, Daoism and Legalism. The need is emphasised in Tang Lan's own writings (1975, p. 12), where he distinguishes between three types of text that are included in Han shu chapter 30 as Daojia; and his statement that while the Shenzi Ffl ^f, Shenzi |J| ^p and Hanfeizi are basically Huang Lao, Han shu chapter 30 lists them with the Fajia. Quite apart from the broad and varied usages to which the terms have been put without due attention to the developments of centuries, there are a number of reasons why their use requires re-assessment, seen not least in the origin of the terms themselves. Although Daojia and Fajia are in fact seen in both the Shiji and the Han shu,5 Confucianism is no more than a substitute for Rujia and adoption of the term Ruist or Juist, as prompted by dissatisfaction with the term Confucian, does little to solve the problem. Thus while "Confucianism" derives immediately from the name of a single highly revered teacher, "Daoism" does no more than render a Chinese word into romanised form; and "Legalism" is based on but one of several meanings of the term fa. For Huang Lao we are even less fortunate; for, although the term is seen frequently enough to describe an individual's mode of thought, it does not appear in lists of documents as an intellectual category; nor is any such master named. Indiscriminate use of the terms, which cannot 5 For Daojia, see Shiji 23, p. 1160; 56, p. 2062; 63, p. 2141; 107, p. 2843, and 130, p. 3292, and Han shu 30, p. 1732; 40, p. 2050 and 62, p. 2713. For Fajia, see Shiji 130, p. 3291 ; Han shu 30, p. 1736 and 62, p. 2713.</page><page sequence="5">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 381 begin to do full justice to the diversities of Chinese thought that modern scholarship has been revealing, is capable of leading to muddled thinking, and misappropriation for political purposes as has already been noted. Furthermore, in some cases use of the terms implies the existence of distinct schools of philosophy, thereby possibly leading to misapprehension. Such categorization tends to suggest that the Chinese thinkers of the pre-imperial age and later tended to limit themselves to a particularly defined framework, when examination of any text makes it abundantly clear that they were more likely to be thinking in eclectic terms. Fastening on the use of certain terms, whose meanings differed strikingly in different books, can lend itself only too readily to misapprehension at times of political controversy, whether past or present, or even to the temptation to apply recent concepts anachronistically, as is done when writers who are treating the Dao are sometimes described as idealist, sometimes as materialist.6 It remains for specialists in Chinese philosophy to provide a solution to this problem of terminology, together with the formulation of a more precise set of categories. In these circumstances some concern must perhaps be voiced at the adoption of Huang Lao as a specific school of thought, to be treated on the same terms as those modes that are denoted as Daojia, Rujia and Fajia; for apart from the recent finds, if these have been identified correctly, there exists no piece of writing that could be described as a textbook or as a set of scriptural statements of the creed, which derived from the masters of this way of thought. It is perhaps too premature to insist that Huang Lao was a widely prevalent philosophy that was current in early Han times; to identify the Huainanzi as primarily a textbook of Huang Lao, on the basis of a wide identity of expressions seen in the four new texts ; or to identify modes of its thought in other writings. It may also be noted that nowhere in the Shiji or Han shu is the term Huang Lao applied to the King of Huainan or the scholars whom he assembled at his court. Tang Lan's view that Huang Lao should be regarded as deriving from Fajia thought draws attention to the two basic meanings of fa, i.e. that of a model, and that of the impositions of an acknowledged temporal authority. The first of these is seen in early literature, and Hu Shih SfJ ?jjt has pointed out that one of the earliest meanings of the term was that of a mould.7 The second usage, with the specific meaning of punitive measures, appears in the L? xing Q Jffj chapter of the Shang shu, which may date from very early times ; but general use does not seem to predate the late Zhanguo period, being seen in the Zuo zhuan.8 In imperial times the terms used to denote the specific commands, prohibitions and punitive sanctions of a government are l? ||? (usually rendered as statutes), ling ^ (ordinances), xing JflJ or fa Jp] (punishments). There would seem to be no implication in fa U&gt; as used in Qin and Han times, of a concept of law that provided protection for the populace, or regulated the authority of officials or limited the opportunities for oppression. 6 E.g. see Cheng Wu, pp. 44-5. 7 See Hu Shih, The Development of the Logical Method in Ancient China (Shanghai, 1922), p. 95 and the telling passage in Guanzi 7 (53 Jin cang |?| jj| ). 8b (SBCK ed.) which spells out the comparison between the effect of fa in controlling the population and the action of the potter's or smith's mould. 8 See Shang shu 19.18a; Shaughnessy dates this part of the work to early in the Chunqiu period (see Early Chinese Texts; a Bibliographical Guide (The Society for the Study of Early China), 1994, p. 380). See also Zuo zhuan 44.4a.</page><page sequence="6">3^2 Michael Loewe By the time that chapter 130 of the Shiji was compiled, whether by Sima Tan W] H? g^ or Sima Qian W) JH j5? the fajia were being singled out for their objective approach, irrespective of the call of kinship or social status ; and while their principles could be regarded as being of value as a temporary expedient, they were not regarded as being suitable for application on a long-term basis ; their unique value lay in their maintenance of the hierarchies needed for the operation of government.9 A telling passage in the Huainanzi, whose textual accuracy may be in question, reads ^^^^F /?fiA????^v ji ? ffi $jj -Hj i here/tf signifies a model, and the subsequent passages discuss punishments that necessarily follow its infringement.10 Somewhat later, perhaps c. 60 B.c., one of the spokesmen of the Yantie lun ??| $f? ff$f compared fa fj? with the bit and bridle used to control a horse, and punishments with a ship's ropes and helm.11 The summary of Liu Xin's bibliographical list that is in the Han shu, and which is to be dated before the time of Ban Gu ?fi@ (d. A.D. 92) assigns ten items to the category of fajia, including works by Shang Yang j|? ^, Shen Buhai, Shen Dao f}| JlJ (fourth-third century b.c.), Han Fei and Chao Cuo J|[ |j| (died 154 b.c.). In the note to this section of the list, the compiler points to the way in which the fajia insisted that a promise of rewards or the threat of punishments should be duly honoured, and describes the destructive effects of excessively strict enforcement.12 Unqualified use of the term legalism perpetuates a type of criticism that has been raised perhaps somewhat unfairly against a particular dispensation, on the grounds that it depended on punishments to an undue degree. It also perpetuates a further misconception, to the effect that political theory should be seen in the light of a wide, unbridged gap, between Legalists on the one hand and Confucians on the other. For the early empires, the principal distinction should be seen more clearly as between those who believed that mankind should be organised, to some degree or other, and those who fastened on the values of a laissez-faire type of freedom. The first group would include both those who saw mankind as responding principally to precept, as advocated by teachers such as Kong Zi and Meng Zi, and those who felt that organisation depended on a rigorous discipline ; and it may justly be assumed that considerable scope for variations and differences of emphasis existed between the two extremes of this way of thinking. The main distinction, however, would not have been between a Confucian and a Legalist wing ; it would have been between those of both camps of these on the one hand and those labelled as Daoist on the other. The opening passage of the texts that precede copy B of the Laozi, from Mawangdui, perhaps explains the relationship between dao and fa : JH t??^ ^ gfe ^f ? I ?H $i OX HK? m w Miwmfe m &amp;&amp;%?.&amp; m N&gt;mmm.is perhaps * is not too much to suggest that to the "Huang Lao school", while fa derives from the transcendent dao, l? and ling are instituted by man. Possibly fajia should be interpreted as those who sought to concentrate on the models of reality that dao engenders and to apply these to conditions of everyday living ; and in this way they were to be distinguished from the daojia, who sought to comprehend the unity of ultimate reality. It may be suggested that 9 Shiji 130, p. 3291. 10 Huainanzi 9.19a; Ames, p. 190. 11 Wang Liqi ?f!j^|, Yantie lunjiaozhu It^l^Rtt (Shanghai, 1958) 10 (55, "xingde" Jfljg), p. 344 12 Han shu 30, p. 1736. 13 Mawangdui Han mu boshu, column 1, transcription p. 43.</page><page sequence="7">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 383 the terms apply to two approaches, on different levels, the one being more practical and lending itself to the means of government, the other being more sublime and less capable of application to mundane problems. In any event, the statement that dao generates/# is of considerable significance to an interpretation of the texts from Mawangdui and the Huainanzi, and in relating these to Huang Lao thought. A full analysis of the use of fa in the Huainanzi is perhaps a necessary step in determining how far that work presents an overall consistent view that is comparable with that of other texts, such as those found at Mawangdui. Certainly there are examples in the Huainanzi where fa is used to mean a model, or to take as a model. There are also passages where it denotes the positive and perhaps detailed commands of a government, which may be of a rigorous nature. Elsewhere it would seem that the terms fa and ling should be taken as two distinct and separate things; e.g. Huainanzi 6. 9b-ioa, which recounts Huangdi's establishment of order in the world and reads : ^ ^ 0^ jfjj ^f\ ^ the ordinances that derive from the model, being clear are not obscured.14 There is certainly considerable evidence to show that Huang Lao attracted a considerable following in Former Han times, with some notable names being mentioned in this connection; how far its ideas influenced public decisions, however, may be another question. Perhaps the most famous persons who are recorded as devotees are Cao Can "H" ^, Chancellor of State (xiangguo ^g |g|) 193-190, Chen Ping ?5jf? 2p, who held the office of Chancellor (chengxiang J|&lt; jfg) of the Left or the Right between 189 and 178; and the Empress Dou flf, consort of Wendi (reigned 180-157), and it is often observed that their influence was eclipsed by the predominance of Confucianism early in Wudi's reign.15 At first sight, the initiatives taken at about that time may appear to be somewhat contradictory, deflecting attention from an earlier praise of purposeful government and a disciplined way of life, while also inaugurating a number of activities designed to organise mankind more effectively. The first type is seen in the famous decree, of 141, which ordered the dismissal of candidates for office who espoused the ideas of Shen Buhai, Shang Yang, Han Fei, Su Qin ??| ^ and Zhang Yi ?Jfj fj|. Such a move would have accorded well with the Dowager Empress Dou's devotion to Huang Lao ideas. But shortly after her death (135), a number of measures were introduced to co-ordinate human effort, to provide security against potential enemies and to extend the areas of the government's influence, by mounting a number of military campaigns. How far such measures should be classified as Confucian may well remain open to question, and in at least one respect Dong Zhongshu, founder of Han Confucianism, saw reason to object to their results.16 However widely the Huang Lao cult may have gained acceptance in the first decades of Former Han, it evidently did not warrant identification and treatment on the same level as the six schools that Sima Tan singled out for comment. Nor is there a separate category of Huang Lao writings in the surviving summary of Liu Xin's bibliographical list. Tang Lan17 notes that while writing of his love for xing ming, the Shiji avoids mentioning 14 The passage may be compared with Guan ?|j| and Zheng lu?n JE f?[,5 in the Mawangdui texts, transcriptions pp. 62, 67. 15 See Han shu 39, p. 2018; 40, p. 2038; 97A, p. 3945; for a full list, see Vervoorn, p. 268, note 31. 16 For measures taken in respect of internal organisation, co-ordination of the economy and the extension of Chinese territory, see The Cambridge History of China, pp. i52f. 1? 1974, p. 51.</page><page sequence="8">384 Michael Loewe Wendi's attitude to Huang Lao.18 Ban Biao's J|? $? (a.D. 3-54) statement that, while revering Huang Lao, Sima Qian treated the Five Classical texts with less respect is perhaps worthy of mention in this connection.19 In one of many passages where he is arguing against the belief that Heaven takes an active part in warning mankind of its errors. Wang Chong 3l 5K (27?c. 100) writes with apparent approval "In their discussions and explanations of the order of Heaven, the Huang Lao school finds truth (shi j|f)" ;20 he may perhaps have had in mind the element of xing ming thought. As may be seen in a few examples, references in the Hou Han shu testify to the maintenance of the cult by a number of adherents in Later Han times, or at least to a recognition of its existence, with or without approval. Perhaps towards the end of his reign Guangwudi (reigned 25?57) was advised by his Heir Apparent that while he possessed the sagacity of Yu |? and Tang ^, he had forfeited that happiness achieved by nurturing one's nature, as in Huang Lao. In one of his famous memorials of protest that were framed towards the end of the dynasty (166), Xiang Kai U ;f|| noted that he had heard of the establishment of worship to Huang Lao and the Buddha within the palace. In 173, when answering a charge of performing certain religious rites with treasonable intent and therefore of conduct that was impious (pu dao?f* |H), a high ranking official claimed that he had done no more than sacrifice to Huang Lao j un ^, in a search for the happiness of long life.21 Nevertheless, there had been an occasion in Former Han when the attention paid to Huangdi in high places had received a distinct setback or check, just at a time when it would have seemed only too likely that he was due to receive great honours. It must have been much at this time that the first chapter of the Shiji had been completed; and whether this had been written by Sima Tan or Sima Qian, it included one departure from previously accepted traditions. Whereas hitherto texts had referred to a series of early monarchs whose deeds were enshrined in mythological history, in this chapter Huangdi was singled out as the first of those kings and as the progenitor of succeeding monarchs and their lines. Elsewhere the Shiji mentions him along with several others who, in the dim mists of antiquity, had performed the feng 3gj and the shan jjjfp ceremonies, thereby providing Wudi with a precedent for the action that he was about to undertake (no b.c.). There is also an account of a sacrifice that was made in order to invoke Huangdi's powers as an exorcist. Above all, he was associated with the highly auspicious discovery of the bronze tripod or tripods, in 113 b.c.; when the event was reported to Wudi, he was informed that one such vessel had been cast by Taidi |jf: ^, three by Huangdi and nine by Yu jg| the Great. The discovery was interpreted as a portent that heralded blessings for Wudi; and the retrospective adoption of the nianhao ?f?. ?j^ Yuan ding jq |^J for 116 B.c., perhaps reflects some recognition of Huangdi's importance. A few years later the major symbolical action of adopting the nianhao Tai chu ^ |?J for 104 b.c., was linked with 18 Shiji 121, p. 3227; Han shu 88, p. 3592. 19 Hou Han shu 40a, p. 1325. 20 Huang Hui ^? fljp, Lunheng jiaoshifjfaf?jf?ffc (Changsha, 1938; rpt., Taipei, 1969) 14 (42 Qian gao Ha), pp. 635-6. 21 Hou Han Shu iB, p. 85; 30B, p. 1082; Rafe de Crespigny, Portents of Protest in the Later Han Dynasty (Canberra, 1976), p. 29; Hou Han Shu 50, p. 1669, A.

But in all this series of events there had intervened one occasion with a completely contrary significance. Major changes were introduced in the imperial cults in 113 ; one was that of the worship extended to Hou tu Jg j^ and it might reasonably have been expected that Huangdi would have been treated to comparable honours. However, in the event, a new imperial cult was set up not to him but to Tai yi ^?-, first conceived as a deity of the stars, and by now possibly seen as an embodiment of Grand Unity.22 It may therefore be asked how this was allowed to take place, if attention to Huang Lao thought at court was still in favour at this time; and we are indeed told that Wudi was apparently far from certain that the worship of Taiyi should be inaugurated.23 A few suggestions may perhaps be tentatively offered to answer this question. Certainly although Huang Lao may have been espoused by some highly placed persons, from the start of the empire until about 90 b.c. or perhaps later the main policies of state had been based on the imperial ideals associated with Qin and its methods, which were hardly conducive to Huang Lao thought. That the kingdom of Huainan had been brought to an end in somewhat disgraceful circumstances in 122 might well have militated against the adoption of views known to have been expressed and promoted at that court. At the time it is likely that, along with the cosmological ideas of the Huainanzi, which, Major argues, formed an integral part of Huang Lao thought, Dong Zhongshu's scheme, with its essential place for imperial government, was gaining acceptance, as is implied by writers who refer to the "Victory of Confucianism " as a characteristic of the age. Possibly by now the measures to train officials on a basis of the prescribed texts of earlier times were beginning to bear fruit, with the result that newly appointed officials were more concerned with the rules of li jjH than with the Huainanzi's explanation of the cosmic system. Attention is also due to a complex question which still requires analysis, i.e. the degree to which the Huainanzi should be regarded as deriving from a single, unitary system of thought. As Major recognises, much work remains to be done by way of philological investigation, and the new concordance to the text will facilitate and speed such enquiries in a manner that has so far not been possible. But even a crude glance at the evidence immediately reveals certain features of how the content varies from chapter to chapter. Thus, while there appear to be no references to the house of Zhou Jr?, its Duke and its kings, in the first five chapters of the book, they may be seen fairly frequently in chapters 9-15 and 20-21. Similarly, Yao |? and Shun ^ almost escape mention in chapters 1-6, while appearing frequently in chapters 7-13 and 19?20. References to Lao Zi are distributed in anything but an even manner; at least 50 statements are ascribed to him in chapter 12; there is one in chapter 11; one in chapter 14; one and perhaps a second in chapter 18 ; and there are four other references to Lao Zi or Lao Dan ^ J^f in chapters 1, 10, 12 and 19. 22 For the powers and reputation of Huangdi, see Shiji 12, pp. 455-68 and 28, pp. 1385?92, Han shu 25A, pp. 1216-28,25B, p. 1246; for the adoption of the regnal title Yuanding, see Han shu 6, p. 181, and Homer H.

(2) 3.6a; as the tutelary deity of the centre, assisted by Hou tu Jp Jh; this occurs in the highly patterned account of the Five Planets (Major, p. 71). (3) 5.18a; as controller of the central zone, with Hou tu (Major, p. 259). (4) 6.9b; as one who put the world in order, assisted by Li Mu ~]rj %fc and Tai shan ji l? [JLlfll. Huangdi is shown as one of the prime instigators of a civilised way of life at the time of the golden age. (5) 10.la and 20.12a; as author of a saying pronounced in the context of primaeval concord, before the emergence of human distinctions. (6) 15.1b; in a discussion of the proper use of fighting, reference is made to Huangdi's battle with and capture of Chi You ^ ~C?; there are also references to the battles fought between Zhuan Xu |j| JJ| and Gong Gong it JQ5 and those undertaken by Yao and Shun. (7) 17.5a; he is named as the generator of Yin and Yang. (8) 18.19a; in a passage which illustrates the subjective nature of human values, the text records Huangdi's loss of his black pearl, followed by its recovery ; this occurred once the appropriate agent was sent to do so, unsuited as he would appear to have been at first sight. (9) 19.16b; in arguing against the habit of praising that which is old and decrying that which is new, the text observes "So, those who cultivate Dao of course ascribe it to Shen Nong and Huangdi". These references may be compared with those that are seen in the four texts identified as the Huangdi si jing (references are to Mawangdui Han mu bo shu 1): (1) P. 16 Li ming XL rfp J Huangdi, with his four-faced image, is seen as receiving his charge from heaven, establishing his position on earth and creating his reputation among mankind, with his achievement of setting up offices for the rule of man and devising a means of calculating the divisions of time. (2) P. 62 Guan JU ; Huangdi instructs Li Hei JMon the means of organising a disciplined way of life, thanks to the complementary nature of Yin and Yang and other pairs, the establishment of constant models and conformity with the movements of nature. (3) P. 65 Wu zheng J^ Jp; Huangdi questions Yan Ran [|f| |% on the establishment of the Five Standards ; he talks of pf* (j?j |p[ ; after a period of self discipline, and in line with Yan Ran's advice he captures Chi You. (4) P. 66 Guo tong |pi Jjf;; Huangdi consults four assistants on the way of setting the universe straight; Guo Tong answers, alluding to the complementarity of opposites. (5) P. 67 Zheng luan J? {?[; Huangdi is in consultation with Li Hei, Gaoyang ?jfj [5|? and Tai shan zhi ji y^ jjj ?L fji| the latter reassuring him ; there is a reference to Huangdi's encounter with and capture of Chi You ; and to the incident in which he cut off Chi You's hair, displaying it in the heavens and naming it "The Banner of Chi You ",24 24 For the use of this term to denote a comet, see Michael Loewe, Divination, Mythology and Monarchy in Han China (Cambridge, 1994), pp. 77f.</page><page sequence="11">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 387 (6) P. 69 Xing zheng $? 4??; in the course of conversation with Gao Yang and Li Hei, the latter stresses the need to obey heaven, and the balance of the opposites, e.g. xing Jfjjand de f?i, or inaction and action (jing zuo $? fj?). (7) P. 72 Cheng fa ff? ^?; Huangdi asks Li Hei whether a completed model exists with which to set humanity straight, and is apparently answered "Yes: that of unity"; unity is explained as being based on Dao. (8) P. 79 Shun dao J||j=f j||; Huangdi asks Li Hei the reasons for Ta ting shi's^jjg? Jj; possession of the world before the separation of Yin and Yang, the recognition of the movements of the sun and the moon and the identification of the four seasons. These passages call for two immediate comments ; first, the overriding similarity of the content of the section entitled Cheng fa with that of the first chapter of the Huainanzi (Yuan dao Jj|( Jg); and secondly the apparent need of Huangdi to consult and take the advice of his assistants, possessor of the world though he is. As Major points out (p. 4), views vary regarding the date when the text of the Huainanzi was completed, as between 139 and 122 B.c. Both this question and that of the links that existed between Huainan and the capital city concern the circumstances and motivation that accompanied the composition of the work. Huainan kingdom lay appreciably to the south of Chang'an and it may be asked how far the scholars who were assembled there were likely to have been affected by the intellectual climate of the capital city or the political decisions that were being taken there. Possibly the family connection with the imperial house may have prompted an interchange of views ; possibly some information was brought back to Huainan regularly, as a result of the statutory annual visit of the king or his officials to render homage and an account of his stewardship. Major interprets the chapters which he translates as a message addressed to a ruler, to persuade him of the need to acquaint himself with the operation of the world of nature and to regulate his own affairs accordingly. At the time that is in question there occurred a major change in imperial policy; from one of consolidation, storage of resources and a negative attitude towards the foreigners, to a positive intensification of imperial administrative control, co-ordination of economic enterprises and initiative in foreign ventures. Certainly the first seven decades of the empire had witnessed remarkable achievements in tightening the grip that the government held over the country, as may be seen, for example, in the steady reduction of the size and strength of the subordinate kingdoms, and the collection of material resources. But it is clear that a new stage of development was about to start. Possibly the year 133, with its decree that ordered a campaign against the Xiongnu, may be taken as being symbolical of the change. It may be noted that this followed two years after the death of the Dowager Empress Dou, grandmother of the newly acceded young emperor, and reputedly an adherent of Huang Lao thought. Possibly Dong Zhongshu's three memorials were being presented at this time; possibly, as a fifty-year-old observer, he was noticing a growing gap between rich and poor which was drawing his protests. A great part of the Huainanzi may well have been completed before these changes had become manifest ; and if this were so their content would well have suited the intellectual climate of the time, and the work could perhaps have been seen as lending intellectual support for the policy of the times. But somewhat different conditions may have applied</page><page sequence="12">388 Michael Loewe to those parts of the work which, if any, were compiled after 139. By then it could hardly have appealed to those who were taking imperial decisions, with a view to extending and enriching imperial strength. Such chapters might very well have been seen as an uncomfortable word of protest, reminding a government of its failings to appreciate ultimate reality. Possibly by this time, i.e. in the years following 135, decisions of state were already drawing criticism of a different type ; Dong Zhongshu may already have been pressing, asjia Yi jj f?[ (201-169 b.c.) had urged previously, the need to avoid the errors and extreme measures of Qin and to base policies on ethical ideals. To some the Huainanzfs description of the universe and its rhythms may have acted by way of encouragement; to others it may have sounded a warning knell. These considerations would hardly arise if it were thought that the book had been intended in the first instance for local circulation in the kingdom of Huainan, for the benefit of the king and his advisers, and that presentation to the imperial court was a secondary development. However the circumstances of its compilation, as related,25 cannot justify such a conclusion. Possibly the interpretation of chapter 9 Zhu shu j? ff?j, the Art of Rulership, is crucial to this question, and opinions here may well differ. To the present writer, that chapter would seem to be addressed more as an exercise of protest than one of praise, as may be implied in the passages about the correct use of rewards and punishments, the stress on individual merit and the need for a ruler's impartiality, or in those that criticise oppressive taxation.26 Other passages of the book, which dilate on the fall of man and the consequent deplorable condition of the human race, lend some support to this view.27 In his specialist study of the chapter, Ames expresses the opinion that the chapter was compiled to combine the practical vocabulary of Legalist theory with basic Taoist and Confucian principles in order to convince the Han court that there was a workable alternative to totalitarian control (p. xvi). The wide range of subjects that are treated in the Huainanzi has called for a number of scholarly approaches, and Major's book takes its place in a number of recent publications that are devoted to differing aims. Probably it is not possible to produce a translation of any one of its chapters that will satisfy all readers. Academics are anxious to see an interpretation of the basic terms of the text with full account paid to traditional scholarship ; students are looking for an easy and direct comprehension of the book's underlying messages ; literateurs would appreciate the literary styles and beauties of some of the writing; scientists are hoping to see a comprehensive statement of some of the basic ideas of China's scientific principles. In such circumstances no style of translation can hope to avoid comment. Neither Roth's study of the text and its bibliographical history nor D. C. Lau's concordance were available in time to help Major in his work. Of these the first may be described as an exemplary way of applying the principles of textual criticism to a Chinese work ; the second will enable scholars to make possible a far more thorough and accurate examination of the book and its contents than has been feasible hitherto. In a somewhat neglected work, Eva Kraft made an early and excellent contribution by introducing the 25 Han shu 44, p. 2145. 26 HNZ 9.2a et seq. and 27a; Ames, pp. i69f, and 200. 27 See HNZ 2.13b, Ames, p. 14; and HNZ 8.1b et seq., as paraphrased in Loewe (1982), pp. 44-5.</page><page sequence="13">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 389 Huainanzi to sinological readers, at a time when the significance of the work had not been appreciated, and by providing an annotated translation of the first two chapters, with a critical appreciation of the problems of interpretation. Wallacker's translation of chapter 11 was published in 1962. It retains the best qualities of sinological work ofthat period, without the benefit of some of the aids that became available to his successors. The book rendered great service by bringing the Huainanzi to more general attention, being the second reliable translation of any part of the work to appear. Le Blanc's version of chapter 6 is partly directed to a discussion of the idea of resonance and its place in Chinese thought. As an excellent exercise in scholarship, this work includes a full introduction and annotation, in which the author takes care to explain to the reader where he is following an emended text. Ames likewise introduces chapter 9 to students of philosophy, aiming to provide an analysis that will satisfy specialists in western as well as in eastern thought. His particular concern is the effect of Daoist principles on royal or imperial rule, itself a pre-occupation of many of China's early writers. Writing for a wider audience rather than for a purely scholarly reader, Father Larre and his two colleagues present a translation of no less than five chapters, nos. 1, 7, 11, 13 and 18, with suitable annotation; they are concerned with bringing to public notice the major contributions to a Daoist frame of mind that are to be found in the whole of the book, and they see the chapters that they have chosen as setting out its main thesis. For long a specialist in Chinese astronomy and cosmology, Major provides a translation of the three key chapters that concern the shape of the universe, the relation of its component parts to each other in space and time, and the means of recording and measuring their motions and activities ; and he believes that these form an integral part of Huang Lao thought. Like other translators, he writes not only for those sinologists who are as yet ignorant of the text and its implications ; he is also concerned with bringing its contributions to the attention of general historians and, in this case, to historians of science; and he is looking at certain aspects of Chinese philosophy that have been largely neglected. The annotation is concerned more with matters of interpretation than with scholarly minutiae ; unlike Le Blanc he does not always feel the need to provide detailed textual notes which inform a reader where the translation follows a traditional commentator rather than the received text. Like others, he balks at an attempt to render certain key terms, such as qi ^ into English; such hesitation is understandable enough, provided that it is accompanied, as it is in this case, by an explanation of how the term is seen in its particular context. For the non-specialist reader, a particularly valuable feature of Major's book lies in the introductory part which sets out the intellectual, cosmological and mythological background against which the Huainanzi should be seen. These sections handle the relation of the Huainanzi to Huang Lao Daoism; cosmogony and creation; the influence of the idea of resonance; the place of the circle and the square in cosmography, and their symbolism, and the instruments known as shi J^ that are termed cosmograph ; and the place of myth and religion in Huang Lao cosmology. The introductory notes that precede each of the three chapters that are translated concern the more technical aspects of each one ; each section of the translation is accompanied by an interpretative explanation. The reprint of Dr Cullen's article of 1976, written without immediate reference to the theme that is under</page><page sequence="14">390 Michael Loe we consideration here and before considerations of Huang Lao had entered in, is to be welcomed. A few points of general interest call for reflection. Comments on the technical aspects of cosmology and astronomy lie beyond the competence of the present writer. (i) How far a, or the, Huang Lao mode of thought may be regarded as a comprehensive system must remain open to question, if only owing to the lack of documentation. One outstanding problem, that of reconciling the various cycles according to which the universe operates, may have drawn the attention of Jing Fang jjT f? the Younger (77~37 b.c.), who was concerned with fitting the rhythm of 64 to that of other schemes. Possibly attention could perhaps have been given in Major's book to the possibility that one of the functions of the TLV mirrors was to present the cycles of 5 and 12 in such a way that they fitted together harmoniously. (2) A further point which does not seem to have been covered fully in the texts that are available is the proper place accorded to divination, which was practised widely at the time in a variety of ways and evidently carried conviction. In discussing the lack of any need for the practice at a time of primaeval bliss, the Huainanzi28 may have been criticising an improper or excessive recourse to this type of enquiry. Major's remark (p. 30) " ...in fact until the end of the second century b.c.e. the Yijing was the exclusive preoccupation of the Confucian school..." calls for comment, in view of the need to distinguish the different parts of that document and concepts of the Confucian school. How far some of the ancillary texts of the Yijing derived from Confucian thought as this had developed at the time of composition may be questionable, and Kramers29 has discriminated between the various schools. It is also of some importance to bear in mind in this connection that it was after the use of the stalks to construct the hexagrams had become established, that attention was fixed on the trigrams and their symbolical meaning. (3) Major's conclusion (p. 48) "The concept of the sacred in Huang-Lao thought thus seems to be subsumed into a broader concept of cosmic order " may perhaps reveal a major difference with other preoccupations of the time, when devotion to the shen ;|E(l and a belief in the powers of the gui jQ, were only too prevalent. (4) Both in the texts from Mawangdui and in the Huainanzi the process of creation is treated in terms of what may be termed natural evolution, or in those of mythology. Reference is perhaps also due to the concept of zaohuazhe }? ^ ^, which is seen on a number of occasions in other chapters of the work than those translated in Major's study, as well as in other texts. (5) Major correctly observes (p. 31) that "Correlative thinking was not devoid of absurdities". This has a significant bearing on the basic question of how far metaphysical speculation or scientific initiative were inhibited by a tendency to place too much trust in categories and hierarchies, whether in the form of the Five Phases, the Eight Trigrams or the Sixty-four Hexagrams. (6) More attention is perhaps due to the part played by the cosmograph (shi j^) as a means of enquiring about one's destiny. One of the recorded occasions of its use in this connection refers to the time of Wang Mang3E # (a.d. 23),30 i.e. just at the juncture when 28 HNZ 8.1b. 29 Cambridge History of China, ch. 14. 30 See Loewe (1979), pp. 77-8.</page><page sequence="15">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 391 some of the choicest of the TLV mirrors were being fashioned, with full attention to symbolism. At this time those who designed these mirrors were taking pains to ensure that the iconographie details were correct, as opposed to those seen on later examples. (7) Major paints a picture (p. 51) in which those Chinese who had been educated in their traditions were thinking nostalgically of what is termed a "Zhou Chinese manifestation of [feudalism] " and he is right to point to the new developments of Wudi's age, as has been described above. But it is perhaps questionable how far an idea of a dispensation of the kings of Zhou went. Many centuries had elapsed since the breakdown of the social and political system that was practised under the Western Zhou kings. It may be asked on what basis any ideas of Zhou that were being entertained in the second century b.c. rested, other than that of the versions of the Shang shu, Zhu shujinian and Chunqiu and a few other texts that were circulating at the time. Certainly there are references in the Huainanzi to some of the kingdoms formed later, in some cases long before the unification, in some cases more recently ; but it would seem that if there was any idealisation of the Zhou period present in the minds of the authors of the Huainanzi it could well have been strangely mixed and unrealistic ; and it would have derived from that part of the Chinese tradition that is categorized as ru rather than Huang Lao. (8) Major is right to show (pp. 45f.) the co-existence of an intellectual approach to the cosmos with an acceptance of much of China's mythology, deriving as part of this does perhaps from neolithic times. It might perhaps be worth stressing here that one of the functions of myth is a means whereby man places himself within the wider world of time and space and reconciles himself to his own insignificant and transient past. (9) The earliest record of the Chinese measurement of the obliquity of the ecliptic is dated at A.D. 17831 and it cannot be known how much earlier Chinese observers had been able to take note of, if not to record, this phenomenon. Major suggests that the myth of the battle between Zhuan Xu and Gong Gong, which ended in the destruction of Mount Buzhou sf&gt; jg| and the consequent tilt of the heavens, arose as a means of explaining it. It would be of interest to know whether elements of mythology in non-Chinese cultures are explained in comparable fashion. The following notes concern the interpretation of a few passages of the text of Huainanzi chapter 3. Support for the renderings that are suggested is to be found in the traditional commentaries to the text, or in reference works such as the Han yu da zi dian ? lg ^ ? &amp; or Han yu da ci dian ^ ?g ^ f|] ||. (1) In some cases consultation of the Japanese versions and interpretations of the text might well have been of value. Thus, on p. 150, the passage (HNZ 4.3a) 3E ?f jjj(? ^ ffi ^Jt ?L R? *s rendered "The jade vase [becomes filled with the elixir of immortality] only in the north-western corner". At least seven kamhun versions take Jjjg as a verb, tsunagu, rather than as a limiting particle, thus suggesting a rendering as "the yuheng is attached to the north-west corner". Interpretation of yuheng as a jade vessel that contains the drug of deathlessness follows the Gao/Xu annotation and a citation from Taiping yulan 756.3a, as Major points out in his note (p. 305). One version (Kamhun s?sho g| Tjr ^ |J, pp. 120-1) reads yu lou :? ig, See Needham, iii, p. 200.</page><page sequence="16">392 Michael Loewe i.e. "a jade tower links its southwest corner"; meaningful as this reading is, it does not seem to be backed by any authority. (2) In HNZ 3.1a (p. 62), ^ 0g is rendered as "The Great Inception", on the basis of a proposal made by Wang Yinzhi 3E ?[ /?(I766-i834), and adopted by D. C. Lau, to read ^ If? (see Major's note on p. 293). However, this does not seem to be a well established term or concept by the middle of the second century b.c., and there is no need to question the possibility that tai zhao the "Great Illumination" is the right reading. Attention need hardly be drawn to the prime place that the emergence of light takes in other accounts of the creation. (3) A passage in HNZ 3.1b (p. 62) is rendered "The sun is the essence of fiery qi". The proposition should perhaps be better put as "The essential element of the vital force of fire became the sun". (4) HNZ 3.4a (p. 67) ^ yp J|^r... "If (lawful) commands are not accepted, there will be great excess of rain"; it is doubtful whether shou can be used in this sense; the reading Bvf as in the Yi lin, jj; ffi is perhaps preferable. (5) HNZ 3.8b (p. 78). ??J $g gg f? jfi*? gjf is rendered "issue unimportant dispatches, dismissing, delaying, or restraining"; this should be "release those imprisoned for minor crimes and dismiss those who have been held in custody unduly". (6) P. 78. To the commentary on Section XII a note might well be added regarding the practice of consulting the oracles of the winds in order to ascertain one's fortune. (7) HNZ 3.8b (p. 78); |g jfy g "Report on the fruitfulness of the land and sacrifice at the four suburbs"; better as "repay the bounties of the earth...". (8) HNZ 3.9a (p. 78); J|? ?^ g| Ip H y^ ?jg; "receive magistrates and put aside amusements"; the text is more likely to mean "the hanging musical instruments are put in store and the qin and se are not strung". (9) HNZ 3.9a (p. 78); m jH jgj? ; "improve dikes and walls"; better as "repair the walls at the borders". (10) A passage in HNZ 3.21a (p. 109) is rendered as follows (see note on p. 300): 5 Thus it is said, "One produced two, two produced three, three produced the myriad things", and Heaven and Earth. 6 Three months make one season. 7 Thus a sacrifice of three [types or portions of] cooked grains are used in mourning rites. 8 The year continues for three shifts (of seasons) to make the seasonal nodes [complete their cycle]. 9 Armies emphasize three signal-flags in order to maintain control. 10 Using three to examine matters: The highly respected Kambun taikei g| 7?r ^^ edition punctuates the text in a different manner. In addition, Wang Niansun 3? ^ ^ (1744-1832) commented that the two characters chong Jj| and han ?fi were meaningless, and proposed an emendation to ge ^ and jun J|[ respectively. The passage would seem to mean:</page><page sequence="17">Huang Lao thought and the Huainanzi 393 Thus it is said, "One produced two, two produced three, three produced the myriad things." In heaven and on earth, it is of three months that a single season is formed. Thus, in sacrifices, it is three offerings that are taken as the prescribed rite ; in the order of conduct for mourning it is three occasions for the dance that are taken as the regulated norm; in military matters it is the three divisions of troops that form the standard; three is used as a means of assessing organic matter. (ii) HNZ 3.29a (p. 133); t&amp;mf?fjB?k # ftl At "Heaven and Earth move with slow dignity. The male uses the (twelve) musical notes to know the female". Perhaps better as "The kanyu moves slowly, the male thereby comprehending the female"; see Early China 9?10 (1983?85), p. 205. Interpretation of the term kanyu as Heaven and Earth derives from Xu Shen ?^ '(g (c. 55?r. 149); and it may be suggested that it denotes instruments which, while representing Heaven and Earth, and described as "canopy and chassis" were used as a means of prognostication. How far the term corresponded with shi may be open to question, but reference may be made to Wen wu 1978.8, pp. 12-31, and figure 8.25 on p. 19, for instruments found at Shuanggudui ?|? "?J* if? that are dated at c. 165 b.c. As will be seen, the rim of the upper plate of one of the instruments is marked by a series of small sockets, perhaps as many as 365, into which it is possible that a small peg could be fitted, moving from one position to another with the passage of the days ; such an action could well be described as that of the male comprehending the female. Exclusion of the character yin ^ may be supported by the version of the passage that is cited in the Wen xuan. (12) HNZ 4.3b (p. 157) ?? 7R ?? S*! ? is rendered "The Weakwater (River) issues from the southwest corner", following the text suggested by Wang Yinzhi, and adopted by D. C. Lau. This difficult and possibly corrupt passage has evoked considerable comment, as may be seen in Major's note (p. 306). The term Qiongshi is seen as the name of a mountain in texts such as the Zuo zhuan and the Chu ci. Enough has been said above to raise the question of how far we are justified in regarding Huang Lao as an integral system of thought comprising elements of political philosophy, metaphysics, cosmology and mythology. It must also remain open to question how far we would be justified in thinking that Chinese writers of the second century b.c. would have described themselves specifically as members ofthat school, however much they may have been attracted by the thoughts ascribed to Huangdi or Lao Zi, or by some of those that are expressed in the documents from Mawangdui or in the Huainanzi. It would perhaps seem more likely that here, as elsewhere, full allowance must be made for an eclectic approach; orthodox, approved ways of thought had yet to be laid down. As yet it would perhaps be better to defer classifying the Huainanzi, or even select parts of it, as Huang Lao, until further hard evidence is identified. Indeed, the circumstances in which the book was compiled were such that, while we may assume some measure of uniformity among its contributors, it would not be right to require that they all fitted within the same category of thought, if indeed it were to be valid to think in terms of the establishment of such categories. Critical and informed translations of early Chinese texts, particularly those which concern scientific or technological matters, are to be welcomed, and there is every reason to be grateful to Major. He brings to attention a number of key issues and sets them within</page><page sequence="18">394 Michael Loewe the context of cosmology, astronomy or mythology; and he ensures that both these questions and the Huainanzi cannot be omitted from consideration in any assessment of the intellectual and scientific developments of early imperial China.
