<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 91 Marxism, an Interpretation. By ALASDAIR C. MACINTYRE. (London: S.C.M. Press. 1953. Pp. 126. Price 8s 6d). This is a short book, but it is clearly the deposit of much thought. It seems to me to take a little time to get into its stride, and the first four chapters are the least satis- factory. Chapter I starts off with a discussion of the sacred and the secular, chapters II to IV trace the development of Marxism from Hegel through Feuerbach. These chapters contain good things and illuminating insights; there is a penetrating, brief exposition at the beginning of chapter II of the Gospel parable of the sheep and the goats (which I think is central for the author's own interpretation: Marxism is finally, so to speak, brought to the judgement of this parable), and there is a vivid awareness in chapter I of the danger of divorcing the sacred from the secular (as a protest against this divorce, an anti-clerical secularism may itself be ' among the fruits of the gospel '). But the removal of the distinction is also un-Christian (as the author sees, p. 12) and I do not think Mr. Maclntyre faces the question where the line is to be drawn. Chapters II to IV do not link directly to the theme of chapter I. They are mainly concerned to show that the religious concern with alienation and redemption, translated from theological into philosophical terms, was central to the Hegelian philosophy, and to trace this theme through Feuerbach to the early Marx. But the exposition rather jumps about. From chapter V onwards (there are ten chapters in all), when the author passes from introduction to an exposition and criticism of Marxism itself, the book seems to me to gain markedly in strength and sureness. Chapters V and VI, the central chapters, are devoted to Marx's vision of History. First it is shown, from Marx's early writings, how Marx's own thought was dominated by the theme of the alienation or estrange- ment of man from his own essential being and the means of his reconciliation. Then it is shown how Marx himself came at about the time of the Communist Manifesto, to repudiate this language. He came to see the estrangement not as a metaphysical hap- pening, but as an historical one (the historical fatality which produced the phenomenon of class-division), and the reconciliation therefore as something to be achieved not by thought nor in religion, but by social and revolutionary action. This latter is the Marx- ism with which we are all familiar, but it cannot be understood unless it is seen that its social and revolutionary practice is moulded by its religious and philosophical back- ground (pp. 76-7). To show how Christianity leads to Marxism, and to trace the cor- ruption of Marxism-this is the twofold theme of the book. The corruption of Marxism is seen in its converting of itself into an orthodoxy. Mr. Maclntyre has a profound insight here, which I despair of rendering. Marx's achieve- ment was to relativize all orthodoxies, seeing that ' fundamental humanity is discovered at a level deeper than that of which men are ordinarily aware '; his failure was that he did not relativize his own orthodoxy, he was 'therefore forced to see his own theory as the truth come to light at last '. Consequently 'a man's assent to or dissent from essential truths ' comes to be ' measured by his assent to or dissent from Marxist theory ' (pp. 88-9). This corruption of Marxism 'turns man's hopes away from man and puts them instead in the party' (p. 77). A chapter (chapter IX) is devoted to the relation of Marxism to 'Analytical Philo- sophy ', which would deny the meaningfulness of the questions to which Marxism gives an answer. Marx's answers, says Mr. Maclntyre in effect (and I infer that he would say the same about the statements of Christian faith) are meaningless if they are taken as statements. But their true nature is not to be statements, but to be practical. ' Moral judgements announce our decisions ' (p. 114). But I question whether we can acquiesce in the denial of all truth-content to theological utterances. I must have given a distorted impression of the book by abstracting brief topics for quotation in a short review. First, it does not do justice to the concentration of thought into a short space which is characteristic of the book. There is sometimes a lack of lucidity, not in the expression of individual thoughts, but in their connection ; but there is a certain depth of insight, which is crystallized every now and then in a telling sentence. Thus: the later Marx comes 'to deny any moral foundation to a vision whose whole origin lay in moral concerns'. 'The tragedy of Marxism is that it wished to combine the scope of metaphysics with the certainty of natural sciences'. (Of the special position accorded to the proletariat in Marxism) 'The possessing classes are comforted by a semblance; the dispossessed have nothing but reality '. Secondly, abstraction of topics may make it appear that the book is concerned with the development and relations of ideas seen objectively from the standpoint of a detached observer. In fact it is written from a confessional standpoint, from within Christianity, so that the writer is involved in the issues which he is discussing; it is rather a con- frontation of beliefs than a comparison of ideas. (Or rather it is a criticism of ideas, based on a confrontation of beliefs.) If this is criticized as a confession of bias, we should perhaps reflect that the ideal from which it is criticized has been shown to be untenable. No statements on the metaphysical level have the objectivity of detachment.</page><page sequence="2">92 BOOK REVIEWS Accepting Mr. MacIntyre's standpoint, I should be inclined to differ from him on the following points : (i) It is fruitless to discuss the relation of Marxism to 'religion '. Marxists do this, including Christianity as a species of religion. But the crucial question is the relation of Marxism not to religion, but to Christianity (it has been said ' Christian- ity is not a religion '). I do not mean that Mr. MacIntyre is unaware of the uniqueness of Christianity among religions. Indeed, when I have felt that he was generalizing about religion, I have generally found myself refuted by coming across a passage in which the special character of Christianity is strikingly displayed (e.g. p. 83). Never- theless I will venture the criticism that the distinctiveness of Christianity is not quite systematically held in mind. (ii) In his important and instructive distinction between prediction and prophecy (pp. 89-90), I do not think the special nature of prophecy is quite adequately shown. Prophecy is thought of as being teleological, anthropomorphic, moral; but does not its true character depend on the fact that what is prophesied is a mystery ? (iii) ' You can only know the truth of the world if you are engaged in altering it '. This sentence expresses Marx's belief, and I think expresses Mr. MVaclntyre's also. But do not the last three words of it imply a too narrow restriction ? 'You can only know the truth of the world if you are engaged '. But is the only form of engagement that which finds expression in reformatory or revolutionary action ? Does Mr. MacIntyre allow sufficiently for the truth expressed in the words of Theodore Woods: 'It is not for you to build a new world, but for God to build a new world, working mightily in you in the power of His Spirit' (quoted Margaret Cropper New Life, p. 20). In his final chapter Mr. MacIntyre says 'The task is to create a form of community which will exemplify the pattern of the gospel ' (p. 122). But this task does not lie wholly in the future. Does Mr. MacIntyre allow sufficient weight to the fact that the decisive part of it has already been performed by Christ in the Incarnation and what followed from it ? On the final page of the book is a quotation from Dietrich Bonhoeffer: ' The Christian is not a homo religiosus, but simply a man as Jesus (in distinction from John the Baptist) was a man. . . . Not the flat and banal " This-sidedness " of the Enlight- ened, of the Active, of the Comfortable and the Sluggard, but the deep " This-sidedness " which is full of discipline, and in which the knowledge of the Death and Resurrection is always present, this it is that I mean .... How can a man wax arrogant if in a this- sided life he shares the suffering of God ? ' The social conditions which make possible a Christian life in this sense have already been created. M. B.
