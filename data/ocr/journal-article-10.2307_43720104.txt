<plain_text><page sequence="1">Albert Gelin, S.S., Les Idées Maîtresses de L'Ancien Testament (Paris: 1948, Les Éditions du Cerf) . Pp. 87. This book is another proof that there is an ever increasing demand in Catholic France for popular expositions of the Bible. It is the second number of a series entitled, Collection , Lectio Divina , designed to make the spiritual treasures of the Bible accessible to the clergy and the educated laity in a form embodying the re- sults of the best modern research, without stressing these results in such a way as to becloud the primary purpose of all scriptural reading, union with God and de- velopment of the inner life. Scientific works are indispensable, but they must be supplemented by those of a popular character in which the religious aspect of the Bible is duly emphasized. The present book proposes to give the leading ideas of the Old Testament. It begins with the Hebrew concept of God, tracing and analyzing the qualities which the Old Testament attributes to the deity: unicity, spirituality, anthropomorphism, transcendence, and closeness to His people. In the second chapter the author ex- pounds the development of the messianic idea: the fundamental promise given to Abraham; its relation to the covenant and the kindgom; the promise of salvation; the presentation of the Messias as king, heavenly being, and prophet; the eschato- logical kingdom in which the Messias is not mentioned. The third chapter treats of personal salvation; the idea of solidarity; retribution, collective and individual, temporal and eternal; the notion of sin, original and personal. The appendix con- tains a useful bibliography, with an evaluation of the books enumerated. The book is marked by succinctness, clarity, and precision. The author is familiar with the best literature, and his choice of opinions is usually felicitous. A striking characteristic of the book is the relation which the author establishes be- tween the principal ideas of the Old Testament and the outstanding features of the New. Much that could have been said has been omitted, but this is generally due to the limited scope of the book. Much too is debatable, but this must be expected in a subject where certainty frequently is difficult of attainment. In short, then,</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 117 the author has written a useful and stimulating book, which we hope will some day be expanded into a scientific theology of the Old Testament.
