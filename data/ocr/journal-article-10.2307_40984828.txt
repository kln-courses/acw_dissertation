INTRODUCTION The Laus Pisonis (hereafter LP), a hexameter poem of 261 lines composed by an apparently young poet and addressed to a man named Piso, may be conveniently summarized as follows: 1-2: Introduction and purpose 2-24: Piso's ancestry 25-80: Piso's eloquence in court (25-71), followed by an apology for not recounting specific examples of this eloquence (72-80) 81-96: Piso's leisurely rhetorical pursuits: declamation and literature 97-108: Aspects of Piso's demeanour and character 109-37: Piso's commendable relationships with peers and clients (in comparison to the norms of the time) 137-208: Piso's lighter pursuits 140-63: justification for lighter pursuits 164-5: composing verse 166-8: playing the lyre 169-77: justification for playing the lyre 178-84: competition in arms 185-9: the lusus pilae 190-208: the Indus latrunculorum 209-61: Conclusion: apology for not writing a work worthy of Piso, and a pledge to write better works if supported by the patron. This is an intriguing short work which has been of interest - if only mildly or in passing - to many a scholarly critic over the years. In order to do any sort of justice to the poem, it needs to be contextualized, and this has proved to be the essential stumbling block. The LP lacks the sort of specific detail that might allow us to put forward an irrefutable case for its authorship, the identity of its addressee and/or its date; consequently, any answers to these questions must remain tentative and be reliant on (at times heavy) interpretation and pleading.1 * An earlier version of this paper was given at the Leeds Departmental Research Seminar in 2007. I offer my thanks to the audience of that paper, and also to Roger Rees, Adam Bunni and various anonymous readers for their helpful comments and suggestions. 1 In this sense, the fate of the LP mirrors that of Calpurnius Siculus, for whom no consen- sus can be reached on matters of date and addressee; see in particular the judicious words of E. Champlin, 'History and the date of Calpurnius Siculus', Philologus 130 (1986), 104-12.</page><page sequence="2">498 STEVEN J. GREEN That said, some interpretations have carried more weight than others in recent years. The identity of the addressee is probably the best place to start, as there is now general agreement that the LP is addressed to C. Calpurnius Piso, the man best known to us from the Annals of Tacitus as chief candidate to replace the Emperor Nero in the failed conspiracy of a.d. 65. 2 Comparison of the qualities given to Piso in both Tacitus and the LP - noble ancestry, successful legal profession, generosity to friends, pleasant figure and demeanour - do indeed suggest that both authors are talking about one and the same person.3 The life of Calpurnius Piso has been judiciously reconstructed from the surviving evidence by Champlin.4 Born in a.d. 8 from a noble Republican family, he became a member of the Arval Brethren in a.d. 38. He was married that summer to Livia (or Cornelia) Orestilla, became consul in a.d. 39^0 and was exiled by Gaius in the latter part of a.d. 40. We only hear about him again at the time of the failed conspiracy of a.d. 65, as a result of which he committed suicide. It is far more difficult, however, to find any consensus on the authorship of the LP. All that the text itself offers, if we are to take it at face value, is that its poet is very young, in that his 'twentieth summer has not yet arrived' {LP 261): this would make him either eighteen or nineteen years old, depending on whether or not the speaker is counting inclusively. Various famous candidates in their younger years have been nominated - notably Statius, Lucan and Calpurnius Siculus - but more recent scholarship advises caution in assigning a recognized author to the piece.5 Finally, the issue of dating the work, or at least establishing date parameters, can now be linked to the identity of the addressee, if one accepts the view that it is Calpurnius Piso: given that Piso has evidently already achieved the consulship by the time of writing (LP 68-71), we have a window for the LP of about 25 years from c. a.d. 40 until his death in a.d. 65. For many years, a late-Claudian or mid-Neronian dating was preferred.6 More recently, Champlin has put forward a forceful argument for a much earlier dating, c. a.d. 40. Champlin's case is very detailed, but it is based on two major arguments: 2 Cf. Tac. Ann. 15.48-74. For a detailed history of the debate, see now S. Di Brazzano, Laus Pisonis: Introduzione, edizione critica, traduzione e commento (Pisa, 2004), 47-64. 3 See E. Champlin, 'The life and times of Calpurnius Piso', MH 46 (1989), 103^; it it can be trusted, we may be helped in our identification by a comment from a scholion on Juvenal 5.109, who specifically links Calpurnius Piso with the ludus latrunculorum; see further M.D. Reeve, 'The addressee of Laus Pisonis' ICS 9 (1984), 42-8; Champlin (n. 3), 105-6, 108-11. 4 See Champlin (n. 3), 107-23. 5 For (fairly) recent advocates of Lucan authorship, see e.g. B.L. Ullman, 'The text tradition and authorship of the Laus Pisonis' CPh 24 (1929), 109-32; A. Seel, Laus Pisonis (Erlangen, 1969); for Calpurnius Siculus, see e.g. R. Verdière, T. Calpurnii Siculi De Laude Pisonis et Bucolica et M. Annaei Lucani De Laude Caesaris: Édition, traduction et commentaire (Brussels, 1954), 47-9; J.P. Sullivan, Literature and Politics in the Age of Nero (Ithaca, 1985), 36, 48 n. 61; see also N. Horsfall, 'Cleaning up Calpurnius', CR 43 (1993), 268. The (now lost) Lorsch manuscript which contained the LP originally attributed the work to Virgil; for a detailed assess- ment of all the proposed candidates, see now Di Brazzano (n. 2), 64-84. Both Champlin (n .3) and Di Brazzano (n. 2) feel that authorship is too difficult a judgement to call. 6 Those who maintain that either Calpurnius Siculus or Lucan is the author take the asserted age of the poet (LP 261) to reconstruct a late-Claudian or mid-Neronian date respectively: as Calpurnius Siculus is believed to have been born in a.d. 33^, the LP can be dated to a.d. 52-3 (see e.g. Verdière [n. 5], 19-21); as Lucan is believed to have been born in a.d. 39, the LP can be dated to a.d. 58-9 (see e.g. Ullman [n. 5], 131-2). See further Di Brazzano (n. 2), 54-63.</page><page sequence="3">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 499 (i) arguments from silence: there are no clear references or indirect allusions to events under Nero, and several events in Piso's life later than a.d. 40 - namely his exile, children and second wife - are not mentioned in the work;7 (ii) Piso as iuvenis: on three occasions in the work, the poet refers to the addressee as iuvenis (LP 32, 109, 211), a term which suits a young adult and is felt to become increasingly less appropriate the older Piso is.8 Champlin concludes, therefore, that the LP was written in a.d. 40, just after Piso's consulship and before his exile, while he was still relatively young (c. 32 years old) and while there was still hope of future glory, especially on the military front.9 A dating of c. a.d. 40 has been the general consensus of scholars over the past twenty years or so.10 Despite the carefully constructed nature of his argument, I find Champlin's dating unsatisfactory. I leave aside for the moment Champlin's two main arguments as outlined above: suffice it to say at this stage that they are surmountable.11 On both stylistic and thematic grounds, a dating of c. a.d. 40 for the LP seems to create more questions than answers. First, if it is the case that Piso has just celebrated a consulship, we need to ask why the LP downplays this achievement, relegating it to a few lines {LP 68-71), especially when such an occasion presented great opportunity for a would-be pan- egyrist. Consulships were most fitting occasions to be commemorated in verse, a popular tradition which can be traced back in extant literature to Cicero's fragmen- tary De consulatu}1 In a detailed comparison of the extant verse commemorations of consulship, Du Quesnay detects more than enough comparable motifs to class it as a 'genre' in its own right, or at least an exercise with fairly well-established rhetorical prescriptions.13 In particular, it is noticeable that written consular celebra- tions typically offer great detail about the occasion itself, often describing the lavish ceremonial of the inauguration, the joy of the spectators and the new consul's popularity; fittingly, emphasis is placed on the special nature of that year, which is deemed blessed and happy.14 7 For Piso's exile, cf. Dio Cass. 59.9.7; for his devotion to a wife in a.d. 65 called Satria Galla, cf. Tac. Ann. 15.53, 59; for his son, Calpurnius Galerianus, apparently sentenced to death in a.d. 69 owing to his connections with his rebellious father, cf. Tac. Hist. 4.11.59.

GREEN At a time when the 'genre' was fairly well established, then, the 'celebration' of Piso's consulship in our poem comes as a real disappointment (LP 68-7 1):15 quis digne référât, qualis tibi luce sub ilia gloria contigerit, qua tu, reticente senatu, cum tua bissenos numeraret purpura fasces, 70 Caesareum grato cecinisti pectore numen? Who may worthily recount how great the glory was that touched you on that day on which, when your purple counted its twelve fasces, before a hushed senate you sang with grateful heart about the godhead of Caesar? There is no pomp and ceremony here. In fact, Piso's consulship, relegated to a subordinate clause (LP 70), is only evoked to provide a temporal reference point for one of his greatest speeches, as the climax to the section celebrating Piso's skills in oratory. Even if we suppose that there were more conventional literary celebrations of Piso's consulship in circulation in a.d. 40, and that our poet was wanting to cover new ground in his eulogy to the man, it is hard to believe that he would have paid so little attention to a recent event which was the most important in Piso's career to date. As a second, but related objection to a dating of a.d. 40, we need to ask why the poet of the LP passes over the consulship, a thoroughly praiseworthy Roman achievement, and instead reserves the climax of the piece for Piso's skill at the ludus latrunculorum, a board game which (as we shall see) had a dubious reputation in antiquity. On a stylistic level, a reader is struck by the consistent use of military language which pervades the LP, in that seemingly every aspect of Piso's political and social life is couched in militaristic terms.16 This culminates with elaboration on Piso's playing of the military strategy board game, the ludus latrunculorum. Scholars are right to suggest that such obsessive military language only manages to highlight the absence of any real military experiences from the addressee, an impression which is surely contrary to the wishes of the panegyrist.17 If this were composed in a.d. 40, it is difficult to explain why, at a high point in Piso's political career, the author would choose to draw so much attention to an aspect of Piso's career not yet realized. Conceptually, therefore, I cannot accept that the LP belongs to a time c. a.d. 40. Allusion to Piso's consulship in LP 68-71 is precisely that, allusive and peripheral, a brief recollection of a past achievement long gone. But if, instead of privileging these few lines, we take on board the whole package of issues raised and themes explored in the LP - detail about ancestry and political life, obsessive militarization of pursuits and defence of leisure - a significantly later dating may become more attractive. 15 The text of the LP is taken from Di Brazzano (n. 2); translations are my own unless oth- erwise stated. 16 See below and, more generally, Champlin (n. 3), 118-19. 17 See e.g. Champlin (n. 3), 103. We may dismiss the idea that our author is employing what Ahi calls 'safe criticism', whereby the poet is using figured speech in order to mock Piso delib- erately for his lack of real military experience, or to (simultaneously) flatter a gullible Piso and mock him in front of others; see F. Ahi, 'The art of safe criticism in Greece and Rome', AJPh 105 (1984), 174-208. Everything we know about the poet (from LP 209-61) suggests a young man in need of a financial patron, for whom such a strategy would be wholly unprofitable.</page><page sequence="5">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 501 In what follows, I offer a reconsideration of a Neronian dating for the poem, but one specifically centred around a.d. 65, at the time when Piso was the chief candidate in a conspiracy to replace Nero.18 From what we may glean from the sources, Piso did not represent an entirely positive alternative to the despotic Nero, given his lack of a military career and the criticism generated by some of his extra- curricular activities. Our young and ambitious poet, possibly aware of his subject's reputation as generous patron,19 seizes the opportunity to come to Piso's aid with a piece of praise in favour of his patron's suitability to be Emperor. Indeed, the style of the LP bears a strong resemblance not to the genre of consular celebra- tion but to the basilikos logos, 'the address to the Emperor', as prescribed by the later theorist Menander Rhetor.20 But the crucial point is that our author is offering strategic praise: not simply a celebration of Piso's noble Roman attributes, the LP is designed equally to act as a defence against accusations that Piso's antics are sufficiently un-Roman as to discredit him from becoming a realistic alternative Emperor to Nero. In order to demonstrate this, we must first set the historical context for Calpurnius Piso and the conspiracy of a.d. 65, as far as can be ascertained from the later sources. II. PISO AND THE CONSPIRACY OF a.d. 65: THE MAN AND THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT Following a bad year for Nero in a.d. 64, during which the Emperor suffered personal tragedy with the death of his daughter and widespread criticism for his role in the Great Fire, a.d. 65 saw the conception, hatching and failure of the so- called Tisonian conspiracy'.21 Though the conspiracy was made up of people of 18 Tacitus {Ann. 14.65) refers to an obscure episode in a.d. 62, whereby a charge is brought by Romanus against both Seneca and Piso on the grounds of subversion. Whatever the specifics of this episode, Tacitus interprets it as the 'seed' for the later conspiracy; cf. Tac. Ann. 14.65; see further V. Rudich, Political Dissidence under New: The Price of Dissimilation (London, 1993), 75-6. If we are tempted to trace Piso's intent on political revolution back to a.d. 62, it follows that the LP might, on my reading, have broader date parameters of c. a.d. 62-5. In the absence, however, of any real evidence of Piso's political intents before a.d. 65, I argue for a date much closer to a.d. 65 than a.d. 62. 19 Cf. Mart. 12.36, Juv. 5.108-12. 20 For the basilikos logos, cf. Men. Rhet. 368-77, D. Russell, 'The panegyrists and their teach- ers', in M. Whitby (ed.), The Propaganda of Power: The Role of Panegyric in Late Antiquity (Leiden, 1998), 29-33. Menander advises a thematic rather than chronological approach to the address by demarcating it in terms of the virtues of the individual (Men. Rhet. 373; cf. Quint. Inst. 3.7.15); Menander also advises the writer to show humility in the face of so great a task, to stress the virtual impossibility of extolling the addressee's virtues, and to express uncertainty as to where to start such an undertaking (Men. Rhet. 368-9). All these features are prominent in the LP; for the ordering of virtues, see discussion below; for the poet's humility and uncer- tainty, cf. LP 1-2, 18-22, 72-80, 214 ff. 21 Though we may glean some detail about the Pisonian conspiracy from Dio Cass. 62.24 ff. and Suet. Ner. 36, our main source is Tac. Ann. 15.48-74, where it constitutes the most detailed single episode in the entire work. For modern discussions, see M.T. Griffin, Nero: The End of a Dynasty (London, 1984), 166-8; Rudich (n. 18), 87-131; A.J. Woodman, 'Amateur dramat- ics at the court of Nero: Annals 15.48-74', in T.J. Luce and A.J.

GREEN differing classes, it seems to have been an entirely internal Roman affair, in that no provincial governors or army generals were involved. The reasons for revolu- tion appear straightforward: the conspirators were looking to replace Nero with a more suitable princeps. According to Tacitus, it was the accumulation of Nero's disgraces and atrocities which had finally led to revolution. When questioned by Nero after the event as to why he had resorted to such treacherous measures, one of the conspirators, Subrius Flavus, apparently replied (Tac. Ann. 15.67): 'oderam te ... nee quisquam tibi fidelior militum fuit, dum amari mentisti : odisse coepi, postquam parricida matris et uxoris, auriga et histrio et incendiarius extitisti.' 'I hated you ... yet not a soldier was more loyal to you while you deserved to be loved. I began to hate you when you became the murderer of your mother and your wife, a charioteer, an actor, and an incendiary.' The murder of his mother Agrippina in a.d. 59 and Octavia in a.d. 62, his apparent instigation of the Fire of Rome in a.d. 64, his flouting of the norms of upper- class Roman society by engaging in acting and chariot-racing22 - Nero's assault on everything Roman and decent had contributed to the need for revolution. The conspiracy itself was a resounding failure. The plan had been to murder Nero during the Cerealia festival. Piso was to take no part in this deed, but would be escorted to the Praetorian camp after the murder. On the evening before the event, however, the conspiracy was betrayed by one of the freedmen of a conspiring senator, who reported his master's suspicious antics to the Emperor. The conspiracy quickly collapsed, as conspirators revealed the identity of their accomplices under interrogation. Most of them, including Piso, were either put to death or committed suicide. Most interesting for our purposes are the portrayal of Piso and the attitude of others towards him. Our fullest description comes from Tacitus (Tac. Ann. 15.48): ineunt deinde consulatum Silius Nerva et Atticus Vestinus, coepta simul et aucta coniu- ratione ... cum odio Neronis, turn favore in C. Pisonem. is Calpurnio genere ortus ac multas insignesque familias paterna nobilitate complexus, claro apud vulgum rumore erat per virtutem aut species virtutibus similes, namque facundiam tuendis civibus exercebat, largitionem adversum amicos, et ignotis quoque comi sermone et congressu; aderant etiam fortuita, corpus procerum, decora facies; sed procul gravitas morum aut voluptatum parsi- monia: levitati ac magnificentiae et aliquando luxu indulgebat. Silius Nerva and Atticus Vestinus then entered on the consulship, and now a conspiracy was planned . . . out of hatred of Nero as well as a liking for Gaius Piso. A descendant of the Calpurnian house, and embracing in his connections through his father's noble rank many illustrious families, Piso had a splendid reputation with the people from his virtue or semblance of virtue. His eloquence he exercised in the defence of fellow citizens, his generosity towards friends, while even for strangers he had a courteous address and demeanour. He had, too, the fortuitous advantages of tall stature and a handsome face. But solidity of character and moderation in pleasure were wholly alien to him. He indulged in laxity, in display, and occasionally in excess. of the Pisonian principate', Arethusa 39 (2006), 281-302. Woodman (n. 21), 104-5 argues that the conspiracy may have stretched back at least a few years. 22 On which, see below.</page><page sequence="7">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 503 Considering that Tacitus has few positive words for Nero, it is noticeable that he can only offer an ambivalent picture of his potential replacement. Although he attracts some positive comment, Tacitus is also keen to point to volatility and duplicity in the character of Piso, a man who can feign virtue, indulges in luxury and lacks moderation and consistency. A later passage develops this sense of duplicity (Tac. Ann. 15.65): fama fuit Subrium Flavum cum centurionibus occulto consilio, neque tarnen ignorante Seneca, destinavisse, ut post occisum opera Pisonis Neronem Piso quoque interficeretur tradereturque imperium Senecae, quasi insonti et claritudine virtutum ad summum fastigium delecto, quin et verba Flavi vulgabantur, non referre dedecori, si citharoedus demoveretur et tragoedus succederet (quia ut Nero cithara, ita Piso tragico ornatu canebat). There was a rumour that Subrius Flavus had held a secret consultation with the centurions, and had planned, not without Seneca's knowledge, that when Nero had been slain by Piso's instrumentality, Piso also was to be murdered, and the empire handed over to Seneca, as a man singled out for his splendid virtues by all persons of integrity. Even a saying of Flavus was popularly current, 'that it mattered not as to the disgrace if a harp-player were removed and a tragic actor succeeded him'. For as Nero used to sing to the harp, so did Piso in the dress of a tragedian. The 'laxity' and 'excess' of the earlier passage are particularized here: Piso enjoys acting in tragedy. One cannot underestimate the damage such a pursuit might cause a would-be Emperor, especially one billed as a positive alternative to Nero. To the Romans, who aspired to the dignified and conservative life of the mos maio- rum, acting in public was put on a par with prostitution, in that both professions involved relinquishing control of one's body for financial gain and to serve the pleasures of others.23 Acting was also strictly illegal, following an Augustan law of 22 b.c. specifically banning members of the senatorial and equestrian classes from performing in public spectacles.24 For this reason, actors in Rome were typically criminals or slaves. By a.D. 65, Nero's notorious stage antics seem to have flouted the laws and sensibilities of the elite Romans in the extreme.25 As the influence of Seneca and Burrus gradually waned in the late 50s a.D., Nero's enthusiasm for theatrics became evident to wider audiences. First, at the private festival of the Juvenalia in a.d. 59, the Emperor adopted Greek-style competition by offering performances on the lyre and encouraging - or possibly compelling - the Roman upper class to take part in mime. The unwilling and ashamed participants, we are told, tried to avoid 23 See especially C. Edwards, The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome (Cambridge, 1993), 98-100, 127-36; ead., 'Beware of imitations: theatre and the subversion of imperial identity', in J. Eisner and J. Masters (edd.), Reflections of Nero: Culture, History and Representation (London, 1994), 83-93. 24 Cf. Dio Cass. 54.2.5.

GREEN recognition from the populace by wearing masks (Dio Cass. 62.19), and Tacitus scornfully depicts a scene of great immorality (Tac. Ann. 14.15). Matters deteriorated further, however, when Nero joined the competitors in the lyre-playing contest for his first truly public performance in Rome at the second Neronia in a.d. 65. Nero would continue his artistic career after the failed con- spiracy of a.d. 65. In his tour of Greece in a.d. 66-7, he performed in all the major festivals, and took on the roles of tragic characters both male and female (Dio Cass. 63.9). Just how far Nero had moved from the ideals of the Roman Emperor in this regard may be judged from a later comment by Pliny concerning Trajan (Plin. Pan. 67.1): quae enim illa gravitas sententiarum! quam inaffectata veritas verborum! quae asseveratio in voce! quae affirmatio in vultu! quanta in oculis, habitu, gestu, toto denique corpore fides! Consider the weightiness of his sentiments, the straightforward candour of his words, the assurance of his voice, the decisiveness of his visage, the sincerity of his gaze, his gestures, indeed of his entire person. Gravity, sincerity, the ability to reassure - all these were felt to be essential qualities of the Roman princeps. As the Romans had no concept of being 'in character', Nero's theatrical antics categorized him as the polar opposite, as a man of simula- tion and unreality: if Nero was a good actor, how could he ever be trusted? Returning to Piso, one can now understand Tacitus' ambivalence towards Piso's general character when he suggests that he is either virtuous or gives the semblance of virtue (Tac. Ann. 15.48: per virtutem aut species virtutibus similes) - Piso's acting threatens to undermine everything he stands for or seeks to do. Ultimately, in the passage cited above, Tacitus, through the mouth of Flavus, raises the fundamental question: is Piso really a positive alternative to Nero? No wonder given his un-Roman antics, then, that Piso is at most the leading, rather than the unanimous, candidate for next Emperor: it is quite easy to believe Tacitus when he suggests that Seneca - a man of established auctoritas in government - might have been the preferred choice for some.26 Another reservation about Piso, made more implicitly by Tacitus, is his lack of military experience. As mentioned above, the conspiracy lacked the military muscle of loyal generals with their armies, and therefore had to rely on its leader for any spontaneous, strategic moves. This proves to be disastrous.27 When the conspiracy had been revealed, but before Piso had been implicated, Piso was urged to take control of the situation, to use his renowned eloquence to test out the loyalty of the army and the people and their appetite for revolution; Piso, however, was unmoved by such petitions and opted instead for suicide ahead of his imminent arrest (Tac. Ann. 15.59). Piso's tactical naivety here is symptomatic of his lack of any military experience. 26 For Seneca as potential candidate for Emperor, see also Dio Cass. 62.24. The sources mention other candidates for ringleader of the conspiracy: L. Faenius Rufus (Dio Cass. 62.24), L. Iunius Silanus Torquatos and M. Iulius Vestinus Atticus (Tac. Ann. 15.42). In fact, Dio's account of the conspiracy does not mention Piso at all, and Tacitus {Ann. 15.49) is ultimately unsure as to who initiated it. 27 The whole conspiracy, in fact, is characterized by Tacitus as a farcical exercise in military bravado which lacks any real military might; see Woodman (n. 21), 114-25.</page><page sequence="9">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 505 This would, in any event, have provided a real dent to his credibility as a new, positive alternative to Nero, as the position of soldier/general and Emperor were inextricably connected in Roman thought and deed.28 Ever since Octavian/ Augustus had founded the Empire on military conquest, and had duly listed his military achievements first in his Res Gestae (RG 1 and 3), subsequent Emperors were under pressure to maintain the military prestige associ- ated with the position. Coming to the principate with no such military prowess and feeling the weight of imperial expectation, both Gaius and Claudius 'staged' foreign conquest in Gaul and Britain respectively; nor was the 'theatricality' of such campaigns lost on the ancient commentators.29 Nero's response to his own lack of military experience on becoming Emperor was noticeably different from that of his forebears. Nero continued the military campaigns of his predecessors (especially in Germany and Britain) and most crucially, in a.d. 63, resolved a difficult and long-standing issue with Parthia concerning the kingship of Armenia. In fact, up until the final years of his reign, Nero's foreign policy was one of the few areas of the Emperor's administration which was not subject to criticism in the ancient sources.30 Subtle criticism of Nero in the military sphere did, however, emerge in the latter years of his reign, when he was charged with undermining the Roman conception of military glory by subverting the gravitas of the Roman triumph. On several occasions, the sources suggest that Nero inappropriately orchestrated non-military events with triumphal overtones. The earliest example comes from a.d. 59, in a description of Nero's entry into Rome after the death of his mother, which Tacitus articulates in terms of a victor and his slaves, 'just like what is seen at a triumph' (Tac. Ann. 14.13: quo modo triumphi visuntur). According to Cassius Dio (63.4-5), similarly triumphal overtones marked the crowning ceremony in Rome of the new Parthian king, Tiridates in a.d. 66. Other, more subtle acts add to the picture of an Emperor who had channelled the spectacle and regalia of the Roman triumph to suit his own, non-military exploits.31 To summarize, from the later prose sources of Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio, we may with due caution construct the following picture of Piso and the chal- lenges that faced him in a.d. 65. Piso was an attractive and well-liked nobleman, whose experiences to date had included a successful legal and political career. But at a time when Rome was apparently ready for a real alternative to Nero, and a return to the more 'traditional' rulership of Augustus, Piso could be felt to be left wanting: absence of a military career and indulgence in certain artistic leisure pursuits could be ruinous to his chances, as they do little to mark Piso out as a positive replacement for Nero. If the LP is to succeed in what I suggest is its primary aim - to put forward the strong case in support of Piso as Emperor - the author must confront these 28 For more detailed discussions of the Emperor/soldier connection, see Griffin (n. 21), 221-34; D. Shotter, Nero (London, 1997), 25-39; J.E. Lendon, Empire of Honour: The Art of Government in the Roman World (Oxford, 1997), 252^. 29 For Caligula's campaign in Gaul, cf. Dio Cass. 59.22.2, Suet.

Tac. Ann. 15.72. Note also the strong triumphal overtones to his return from the tour of Greece in a.d. 67 (Suet. Ner. 25.1-2). Moreover, that Nero and his ancestors flout the protocol of the Roman mili- tary triumph is a leitmotif of Suetonius' account of Nero's life; cf. also Suet.

After all, if propaganda is to be successful, it must put a kindly gloss on or focus attention away from negative traits, but it cannot ignore them entirely as if they do not exist.32 The main body of my discussion of the LP will be in three parts. First, I will assess the ways in which the poet draws attention to, or creates, a military air around Piso (§ III). Secondly, I will analyse the ways in which the LP excuses Piso's more dubious leisure activities (§ IV). Finally, we shall see how the LP brings both authorial preoccupations together into a fitting climax (§ V). III. ARMING THE HERO Warfare, then, was a quintessential pursuit for a Roman Emperor. For anyone look- ing to compose a piece of praise on the virtues of an Emperor, Menander Rhetor's advice is to deal in great detail with matters of war ahead of any matters of peace, as warfare demonstrates courage, the cardinal virtue for an Emperor (Men. Rhet. 372-4). True to this advice, achievements in war occupy first place in many of the extant imperial panegyrics.33 The author of the LP, lacking any real military material to play with, attempts to circumnavigate this issue by adopting a consistent strategy of 'militarizing' the strictly peacetime achievements of his addressee.34 Ilia. Piso's Martial Law (LP 25-71) After an introductory section which deals in cursory fashion with Piso's ancestry (LP 1-24), our poet starts the praise of the individual proper by dealing with Piso's eloquence and services in legal matters. Piso was well known for his eloquence in court (cf. Tac. Ann. 15.48.3), and the use of such skills for the altruistic purpose of protecting helpless defendants is a classic theme of encomium.35 However, as mentioned earlier, discussion of such peacetime activities is typically preceded by elaboration of military exploits. Our poet would appear to know this well, for having just referred to the military exploits of Piso's ancestors (LP 19-24), he tries to soften the blow when he turns to Piso himself (LP 25-9): 32 This general point is well made, in relation to Roman poetry, by A. Wallace-Hadrill, 'Time for Augustus: Ovid, Augustus and the Fasti' in M. Whitby, P. Hardie and M. Whitby (edd.), Homo Viator: Classical Essays for John Bramble (Bristol, 1987), 222, and by L. Morgan, 'Assimilation and civil war: Hercules and Cacus', in H.-P. Stahl (ed.), Vergil's Aeneid: Augustan Epic and Political Context (London, 1998), 181-2. 33 Cf. e.g. Pliny's Panegyricus, in which Trajan's martial exploits (12-20) precede his politi- cal achievements (25-53); cf. also Pan. Lat. 8 (5), 6-16 (Constantius' campaign victories in the west). 34 The LP might have provided a possible model for later panegyrists who were faced with a similar problem of an addressee with no real military prowess to extol; cf. Pan. Lat. 1 (6) (to Constantine and Maximian) with C.E.V. Nixon, ' Constantinus oriens Imperator, propaganda and panegyric. On reading Panegyric 7 (307)', Historia 42 (1993), 238^6; esp. Claud. 7. (Honorius III) 14-38, where the poet tries to build a military air around Honorius by speaking about his subject's playing around soldiers when he was a child. 35 Cf. Hor. Carm. 4.1.13-15 (Paullus Fabius Maximus), [Tib.] 3.7.46-7 (Messalla), Ov. Fast. 1.23 (Germanicus), Pont. 1.2.116 (Paullus Fabius Maximus), 2.2.50 (Messalinus); see further Men. Rhet. 375.</page><page sequence="11">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 507 nos quoque pacata Pisonem laude nitentem exaequamus avis, nee enim, si bella quierunt, occidit et virtus: licet exercere togatae munia militiae, licet et sine sanguinis haustu mitia legitimo sub iudice bella movere. Let us too equate Piso to his ancestors, as he shines in a glory associated with peace. For if wars have sunk to rest, courage/manliness does not fall as well: it is allowed to exercise the gifts of a toga-clad warfare, it is allowed to engage in gentle battles, with no blood drawn, under a judge ordained by law. At first glance, our poet seems resigned to the advice Menander offers to the panegyrist who has no military material to work with: 'If, however, [your subject] has never fought a war (a rare occurrence), you have no choice but to proceed to peaceful topics' (Men. Rhet. 372). However, our poet has other ideas: he is actually serving notice, at this early stage, that he will be strategically blurring the categories of war and peace. Peace has its own virtus on display (LP 27), a term encompassing all aspects of 'manliness' which is often translated as 'courage'. If we translate so, this is a forceful rebuff of the Menandrian precept that warfare is the principal guarantor of courage: one and the same virtue, we are told, can now pass fluidly between times of peace and war. This serves notice of the arming of the peacetime hero to come. Our poet is certainly not the first to use military language to describe legal activity.36 But nowhere is it employed in such a forceful and sustained fashion. At court, Piso can engage in wars, albeit mild ones (LP 29 mitia ... bella movere). What is more, the prizes of war and peace are comparable (LP 30-1): hinc quoque servati contingit gloria civis, altaque victrices intexunt limina palmae. From this service also comes the glory of saving a citizen, and the palms of victory enwreathe the high threshold. Reference is made here to the palm branches that a successful pleader could receive as a reward for his services.37 But specific reference to 'palms of victory', set up to commemorate the 'saving of a citizen' {servati ... civis), casts Piso in the role of successful military general who has received the crown traditionally awarded 'for saving citizens' (ob cives servatos)?* Fittingly for the would-be Emperor, a flattering connection is forged between Piso and Augustus, to whom the Senate famously awarded an oaken crown to be hung on his doorposts to commemorate his saving of citizens.39 The martial imagery here, then, serves both to enhance the military reputation of Piso and forge links with the archetypal Emperor figure. 36 For isolated instances, cf. e.g. Cic. Cat. 2.28, Ov. Fast. 1.22 civica ... arma, Val. Max. 7.7.1 itaque depositis armis coactus est in foro togatam ingredi militiam, 8.5.5, TLL 8.958.56-63; for oratory as weaponry, see also Aper's speech in Tac. Dial. 5.5. 37 Cf.

GREEN As similarities can be forged between a victorious orator and a victorious military general, so the apparent gap between the achievements of Piso and his ancestors now narrows (LP 37^0): sed quae Pisonum claros visura triumphos olim turba vias impleverat agmine denso, ardua nunc eadem stipat fora, cum tua maestos defensura reos vocem facundia mittit. But the crowd which once filled the streets in a packed column to see the illustrious triumphs of the Pisones, the same crowd now packs the laborious law-courts, when your eloquence sends voice to protect sad defendants. A packed crowd attends the services of all the Pisos, and the connection between Piso and his ancestors is conveyed stylistically, as claros visura triumphos (LP 37) is balanced by maestos defensura reos (LP 39-40). When focussing in more detail on the orator's skill at court, events proceed with the ferocity of a military confrontation (LP 44-6): dum rapis una iudicis affectum possessaque pectora temptas, victus sponte sua sequitur quocumque vocasti. While you snatch away altogether the feelings of the judge and assail his captured heart, conquered, he follows of his own accord to wherever you call him. The judge, then, is attacked, captured and subjugated in such a way that he finds himself following a master, an image which suggests almost a triumphal proces- sion. As is customary in praise literature, flattering comparisons to the great men of old are forthcoming: whether he gears himself towards fiery verbal attack, grace- ful concise expression or flowery elegance, Piso's eloquence surpasses that of Odysseus, Menelaus and Nestor respectively (LP 57-64). All three characters are classic, well-used exempla of different rhetorical arts.40 It is worth noting, however, that all three mythological figures are consistent with the author's general strategy in this section, as all three speakers are equally well adept at warfare. Moreover, our author appears to have exercised a degree of choice in avoiding comparisons with less heroic, non-military figures such as Cicero.41 Illb. The Warrior at Play (LP 178-89) The metaphorical militarization of Piso's legal career is later complemented by a discussion of Piso's sportive leisure activities at LP 178-89: arma tuis etiam si forte rotare lacertis inque gradum clausis libuit consistere membris 40 Cf.

If moreover it has pleased you perchance to whirl weapons from the shoulder and take your stand, limbs taut in fixed position, and at the same time both to avoid and attack your adversary, then with nimbleness of foot you swiftly interlace circle upon circle; with slantwise rush you press hard on your adversary as he retreats: and now you lunge at his breast with vigorous right hand, now you strike his exposed flank with an unexpected blow. No less is your nimbleness if perchance it pleases you to return the flying ball or recover it when it is falling to the ground, and by an unexpected movement throw it back as it flees from you. The people are gripped by this spectacle, and the whole crowd, now sweating from exertion, suddenly abandons its own games. The two games mentioned here - competition in arms (178-84) and a game of ball (the lusus pilae, 185-9) - as well as the public setting (188-9) paint a picture of Roman exercising that took place on the Campus Marthas.42 Though these leisure pursuits attracted some criticism owing to their Greek influence, most of our evi- dence suggests that they were acceptable, and indeed commendable, activities for a Roman. Exercise involving weapon-fighting competition was typically associated with young men, as it was formally sponsored by Augustus as a means of preparing the Roman iuventus for warfare.43 But it was not just the preserve of the young: Marius in his seventieth year could still be found practising weapon drills among younger people.44 Ball games, of which there were several types, were played by noble Romans of all ages.45 The game's popularity and acceptability tie in with the general ancient philosophy that a little light exercise had the physical and psychological benefits of refreshing the body for more serious pursuits.46 The poet takes advantage of the positive associations of these two activities - and especially the military connotations behind the competition in arms - to consolidate his overall message. Our author contrives to describe each contest in terms which bring out virtues and strategies key to successful warfare: agility {mobilitas: LP 181, 185), the ability to catch an adversary unawares, be it human or ball {LP 184 necopino, LP 187 non sperato), and the ability to change the momentum of a situation such that hostile attack/onrush {LP 180 petentem, LP 42 Cf.

Ben. 2.17.3-5, 2.32. 46 Cf. e.g. Val. Max. 8.8 praef, Sen. Ep. 15.1-6. Cf. also Galen, De parvae pilae exercitio (v, 899-910 K.).</page><page sequence="14">510 STEVEN J. GREEN 185 volantem) is quickly converted into enemy flight (fugientem: LP 183, 187). Moreover, intertextual links have the effect of casting the contest in arms in an epic, Virgilian light, arma, as the first word of the hexameter line for this section {LP 178), immediately recalls the Aeneid.41 This is followed by diction which lifts the playful contest on to the level of a heroic duel, particularly reminiscent of the contest between Aeneas and Turnus.48 IIIc. Piso as Iuppiter tonans In eulogistic literature to a Roman Emperor, it was by the first century a.d. a recognized tactic to connect the addressee with Jupiter, either on grounds that they are ruling counterparts of earth and sky respectively or, more boldly, on the grounds that the addressee is like a god on earth.49 Following in this tradition, the author of the LP finds subtle means of not only flattering his addressee with such a correlation, but also pointing up the aggressive side of the king of the gods. On two occasions, our author expresses Piso's verbal dexterity in terms reminiscent of Jupiter in his role as thunderer. During the section on Piso's forensic talents, the poet writes {LP 57-8): nam tu, sive libet pariter cum grandine nimbos densaque vibrata iaculari fulmina lingua For whether it pleases you to hurl down rain along with hail and loud thunder from brandished tongue ... Though the metaphor of 'verbal thunderbolts' is found occasionally elsewhere,50 it is nowhere developed with such metaphorical colouring. Piso is depicted as meteorological master of rain, hail and thunder, and it is only in the final word of the clause - lingua (58), which replaces the more natural dextra - that we realize that it is Piso rather than Jupiter who is being described. Compare also the poet's description of declamation {LP 94-5): hinc solido fulgore micantia verba implevere locos, From here, words flashing with sustained brightness filled up the choice passages ... 47 For the ancient practice of referring to major works by their first word, and the use of arma to allude to Virgil's Aeneid, cf. Ov. Am. 1.1.1 with J.C. McKeown, Ovid: Amores, Vol II: A Commentary on Book One (Leeds, 1989) ad loc. 48 The verb rotare {LP 178) to denote the 'brandishing' of weapons is of epic register; cf. Verg. Aen. 9.441, 10.577, Sil. Pun. 4.201. More specifically, reference to Piso's nimble move- ment in circular motion to avoid being hit {LP 181-2 super orbibus orbes ' plectis), as well as his lunges against a retreating opponent {LP 1 82 obliquis fugientem cursibus urges) recall the language used for the duel between Aeneas and Turnus; cf. Verg. Aen. 12.481-2 Aeneas tortos legit obvius orbes, | vestigatque virum, 12.742-3 ergo amens diuersa fuga petit aequora Turnus I et nunc hue, inde hue incertos implicat orbis; cf. also Verg. Aen. 5.584 (the lusus Troiae). 49 Cf. e.g. Hor. Carm. 3.5.1^, Ov. Met. 15.858-60, Fast. 1.608 with Green (n. 39) ad loc, 2.131-2, Plin. Pan. 80.3-4. 50 Cf. Cie.

According to the TLL, this is the first instance of a rare, metaphorical usage of mico, a verb usually employed to describe splendid light, including lightning.51 For this reason, we might well ask how tempting it is for the reader to slip between fulgore ('brightness, splendour) and fulgure ('lightning'). IV. MUSIC AND LIGHT POETRY: MAKING THE MOST OF A PATRON'S BAD LEISURE (LP 137-77) As mentioned above, the essence of successful propaganda is the ability to put a positive gloss on negative qualities.52 Our author, then, needs to tackle head-on the issue of his patron's dubious leisure activities. In a piece which is remarkably fluid in the way it moves from one topic to another, it is noticeable how much space is given over to an introductory justifica- tion for Piso's leisure pursuits (LP 140-63), backed up with further justification for a specific pursuit later (LP 169-77). These apologiae enclose two specific activities - composing verse (LP 163-5) and playing the lyre (LP 166-8). In order to understand the LP's cautionary stance in this area of his subject's life, it is necessary to look more closely at the nebulous concept of otium in ancient Roman thought.53 otium was a concept invented and maintained by the elite in society. Proper otium was felt to be a dignified endeavour, as it constituted the practising of worthwhile, stimulating and productive pursuits, which provided enjoyment, relaxation and opportunities for personal development. As such, one had to avoid pursuits which were a waste of time and contributed to a life of sloth and immorality. To some extent, then, a hierarchy of leisure pursuits was perceptible in antiquity, which would, for example, see philosophy and intellectual conversation at the top of the list, and entertainment in the arena towards the bottom. But proper otium was not simply a case of class or specific activity. In his illuminating study of alea, the game of dice which typically involved gambling, Purcell has shown that there was also a time- and context-specificity for proper otium: he notes that alea, typically branded a waste of time and a swift path to general immorality, was treated less harshly if played at a time of officially sanctioned otium, especially the Saturnalia, and in a private rather than public setting.54 Proper leisure was especially important for an Emperor, for whom the distinction between 'private' and 'public' activity had been blurred since the time of Augustus: 51 For the rare metaphorical use, see TLL 8.930.75 ff.; for its usage to describe thunder and lightning, see TLL 8.930.31 ff. 52 See n. 32. 53 For detailed discussions of otium, see J.-M. André, L'Otium dans la vie morale et intel- lectuelle romaine des origins à l'époque augustéene (Paris 1966) and J.P Toner, Leisure and Ancient Rome (Cambridge 1995), 22-33. 54 See N. Purcell, 'Literate games: Roman urban society and the game of alea' Past and Present 147 (1995), 3-37, esp. 11-14. For the Saturnalia as the primary occasion for increased licence in the Roman year, cf. e.g. Sen. Ep. 18.1, Stat. Silv. 1.6.1-8; Balsdon (n. 42), 124-6. Most notably, the legal ban on alea was relaxed during the Saturnalia; cf. e.g. Mart. 5.84, 11.6.1-4.</page><page sequence="16">512 STEVEN J. GREEN private life was open to public scrutiny, and an Emperor had to lead by example and ensure consistency between private and public practice.55 This sentiment is perhaps best expressed by Pliny who, having just praised Trajan's interests in hunting and sailing as indicators of the man's strength, dexterity, leadership and piety, sets out the general ethos {Pan. 82.8-9): simul cogito, cum sint ista ludus et avocamentum, quae quantaeque sint curae seriae et intentae, et a quibus se in tale otium recipit. voluptates sunt enim voluptates, quibus optime de cuiusque gravitate sanctitate temperantia creditur. nam quis adeo dissolutus, cuius non occupationibus aliqua species severitatis insideat? otio prodimur. an non plerique principes hoc idem tempus in aleam stupra luxum conferebant, cum seriarum laxamenta curarum vitiorum contentione supplerent? At the same time I ask myself what, since these are [Trajan's] games and amusement, is the extent of his serious interests and occupations, from which he takes himself into such kind of leisure. For it is a man's pleasures - indeed, his pleasures - which are believed to give the best indication of his dignity, moral purity and self-control. For who is so dissolute that no semblance of seriousness resides in his occupations? It is in leisure moments that we are betrayed. Is it not the case that many of our leading men have used this very time for gambling, debauchery and extravagance, when they were replacing relaxation from serious concerns with the tension of vice? How, then, might the Romans have viewed the leisure pursuits of Piso, the would-be Emperor? As we have already seen above (§ II), Piso's apparent predilection for theatrical pursuits, especially acting, was about as disastrous a pursuit as an upper- class Roman and potential Emperor could have. Our author glosses over this most controversial of pastimes.56 He does, however, maintain a sense of objectivity by dealing with the two related artistic hobbies of dubious repute for a Roman: the composing of light, Callimachean-style verse (164-5)57 and the playing of the lyre (1 69-77). 58 There is no doubting the need to excuse these two activities in a eulogy for the potential replacement for Nero, given that both these pursuits would have reminded the reader of the despotic Nero, who sponsored some of the lighter forms of poetry and whose lyre-playing is strongly linked to his general immorality.59 55 Cf. Plin. Pan. 83.1-2. See also P. Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (Michigan 1988), 159-62; Edwards (n. 23) 163-72. 56 Champlin (n. 24), 77-80 argues that Nero may not have taken to acting tragedy until the tour of Greece in a.d. 66-7, i.e. at least a year after the Pisonian conspiracy; if this is the case, it would explain why the author of the LP ignores the issue of tragic acting and focusses only on those pastimes of Piso which would invite most direct (and unfortunate) comparison with Nero. 57 That LP 1 64-5 refers to short, witty, frivolous types of poetry, characteristic of Callimachus and in counterpoint to traditional 'serious' poetry like epic, is apparent not only in ludenti (164) but also in the close proximity of deducit ... carmen (165), which is an obvious allusion to the deductum carmen, a tag used by the Romans to denote the lightness and lack of thematic unity associated with Callimachean poetics; cf. Verg. Eel 6.4-5 pastorem, Tityre, pinguis ' pascere oportet ovis, deductum dicere carmen (a near translation of Call. Aet. fr. 1 .23-4 Pf.); see further S.J. Hinds, The Metamorphosis of Persephone: Ovid and the Self-Conscious Muse (Cambridge 1987), 18-21. 58 For the interconnection between acting and lyre-playing, however, see Champlin (n. 24), 78-80. 59 For Nero s practising and sponsorship ot lighter, Callimachean torms ot poetry, see esp. Sullivan (n. 6), 86-92; for Nero's predilection for lyre-playing, cf. Suet. Ner. 20.1, 25.2, 30.2, Tac. Ann. 14.14, Dio Cass. 62.20-1; most notably Tac. Ann. 15.39. This feeds into a more general Roman moral criticism of music and frivolous poetry, which attracts contempt through</page><page sequence="17">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 513 Our author starts with a lengthy introduction (LP 140-63) which acts as a general anaesthetic, as it makes a powerful case for the need for leisure. Rather than a man who wantonly abuses otium, Piso is depicted as a man of laudable versatility who is in synch with the cycles of the world. Piso's change in activities is made to mirror the changes in mortal occupations (140-4), the natural seasons of the year (145-51) and, climactically, the activities of the king of the gods himself (152^4). The section concludes fittingly with the famous Ciceronian advice to 'obey the seasons' (155).60 Although many of the motifs in this section are well rehearsed, it would be wrong to overlook the choices the author has exercised. The two mortal occupa- tions mentioned here are those of archer (142-3) and soldier (144), the former being a well-attested exemplum in such contexts,61 the latter an apparently novel addition. Both images are used to develop further the metaphor of Piso as military man: just as he is 'at arms' when he is conducting legal work, so, at leisure, he is like different types of aggressor who have put down their weapons. Moreover, the subtle correlations made earlier between Piso at work and Iuppiter tonans62 are made specific here, as Piso at play is compared directly to Jupiter when he has put down his thunderbolts for a symposium (152-4): ignea quin etiam superum pater arma recondit et Ganymedeae repetens convivia mensae pocula sumit ea, qua gessit fulmina, dextra. Indeed, even the father of the gods stores away his fiery weapons and, seeking again the banquet at the table served by Ganymede, takes up the goblet in the same right hand with which he wielded thunderbolts.63 As our author plays up potential military connections, so he plays down other aspects. Tacitus' condemnation of Piso's leisure pursuits strongly suggests that he indulged in them beyond those times officially sanctioned for otium.64 So as not to draw attention to this, our poet is noticeably vague about exactly when Piso partakes in such activities, opting for defensive terms to highlight the limited nature of these pursuits: Piso pursues serious activities not all the time (139 nee ... semper, which links with nee semper ... non semper in 142 and 147), as he partakes of leisure activities for a short while (162-3 paulisper). Piso's love of the lyre is felt to require its own further justification (LP 169-77): ne pudeat pepulisse lyram, cum pace serena publica securis exultent otia terris, 170 ne pudeat: Phoebea chelys sic creditur illis pulsari manibus, quibus et contenditur arcus; its Greek origins; see J.RV.D.

Do not be ashamed to strike the lyre! At a time of serene peace, let public leisure rejoice in carefree lands! Do not be ashamed! So it is believed Apollo's harp is played by those (same) hands which also stretch the bow. So it is told the fierce Achilles played the lyre, even though Priam's hero son was burning a thousand ships, and the war trumpet clashed with harsh noise with the well-tuned strings. The hero sprung from Nereus beat out sweet melody with that (same) thumb from which the Pelian spear used to speed against an enemy. The underlying exhortation ne pudeat - repeated in prominent position in 167 and 169 (169 in enjambment) - is an immediate response to any Roman elite criticism which has been attracted to Piso after the revelations of 166-8.65 Instead of viewing the issue as a matter of shame, the poet directs the reader to more positive responses. First, lyre playing is consistent with Apollo, a deity who has a recognizable military aspect and very good imperial credentials.66 Moreover, it is consistent with Achilles, the best warrior in mythology, as he famously plays the lyre at the loss of Briséis (Horn. //. 9.185-8). The phraseology of 172 and 177 drive home the central message: talented hands can be directed to divergent pursuits without compromise to one aspect or other. V. CONVERTING CRITICISM INTO HIGH PRAISE: PISO'S TOY SOLDIERS AND THE LUDUS LATRUNCULORUM {LP 190-208) The LP reaches its eulogistic climax with a description of a board game at which Piso was apparently skilled, namely the Indus latrunculorum, 'the game of little soldiers'.67 As our most detailed extant description of this ancient board game, this part of the LP has probably attracted the most scholarly attention over the years.68 Piso's apparent reputation in playing this game is attested elsewhere.69 None the less, as it forms the climax of the eulogy, it is important first to assess the status with which the ludus latrunculorum was held by the Romans. An epigram of Martial might provide the most suitable point of departure (Mart. 7.72.1-8): 65 Interestingly, Horace makes a similarly defensive exhortation to a Piso on the merits of the lyre (i.e. lyric poetry); cf. Hör. Ars P. 391-407 esp. 406-7 ne forte pudori ' sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cantor Apollo. In the light of the general debate surrounding the identity of the Pisos in Horace's Ars Poetica, it is irrmossible to recover whether or not the connection is intentional. 66 For the close connections forged by Octavian between Apollo and himself throughout his reign, cf. Verg, Aen. 8.704-6, Prop. 4.6; see esp. Zanker (n. 55), 48-53. For Apollo's ability to move with ease between his military and lyre-playing roles, cf. Hor. Carm. 3.4, 4.6, Prop. 4.6.25-36. 67 For latro in the sense 'soldier', cf. e.g. Plaut. Mil. 76, Varro, Ling. 7.52. 68 See esp. R.G. Austin, 'Roman board games I', Greece and Rome 4 (1934), 25-30; R.C.

In this epigram, Martial addresses a (possibly fictitious) man named Paulus, cast as a lawyer (cf. 5 reus) and patron, and wishes him prosperity in all his pursuits at the festive, gift-giving time of December, which is an obvious reference to the festival of the Saturnalia. The patron is not only wished material boons (4-5), but also success at the Indus latrunculorum - clearly identifiable by its mandra (on which, see below) and glass-countered soldiery (8) - against two named opponents, Novius and Publius. Assuming that Martial is sincere in his well-wishing, this epigram might be felt to provide useful information about how the Indus latrunculorum was regarded in Roman society. First and foremost, it might be seen as a meritorious, intellectual leisure pursuit for a man of high society: Paulus, like Piso, appears to have a legal career. We might push the passage further and, using an analogy with modern-day chess, argue that Martial is here referring to some form of public championship, in which Paulus has to pit his gaming wits against two famous adversaries (simultane- ously?). If this were the case, exceptional skill at the ludus latrunculorum might indeed provide a fitting conclusion to a eulogy to Piso. Such an interpretation does not, however, take into account the time-specificity aspect to proper otium discussed a little earlier.70 The crucial point of Martial's epigram is that the poet is talking about the Saturnalia, a time of officially sanc- tioned otium where the ludus latrunculorum might be regarded as an acceptable pursuit.71 But it would be rash to use this as evidence of approval of the game per se. On the contrary, outside the confines of festival days, some ancient com- mentators make clear that they hold the game in rather low regard. The younger Seneca, for example, categorizes it along with ball games and sunbathing as a thoroughly wasteful use of time,72 and both Seneca and Macrobius regard it as frivolous in comparison to more worthy pursuits, such as literature and stimulating conversation.73 Our evidence then, limited though it is, suggests either that different individuals held the ludus latrunculorum in different regards, or that the game was acceptable and unacceptable dependent on time and context. Either way, it would seem, the 70 See § IV above. " In similar fashion, Ovid intimates (Tr. 2.471-92) that treatises on the art of gaming, includ- ing the ludus latrunculorum (477-80) were only acceptable during the greater freedom of the Saturnalia. 72 Cf. Sen. Brev. 13.1. 73 Cf. Sen. Ep. 106.11, Macrob. Sat. 1.5.11.</page><page sequence="20">516 STEVEN J. GREEN ludus latrunculorum held an ambivalent position in ancient Roman thought, which makes it all the more surprising, at first glance, that the author of the LP should not only deal with his patron's skill in this game, but do so in such detail and reserve it for the pinnacle of his eulogy. By now, however, we should be able to discern our author's motives here. Risky a topic it may be, but for a patron without any experience in real warfare, the 'game of little soldiers' provides the most suitable canvas on to which to project the tactical and military prowess of the addressee.74 In order to appreciate our author's strategic embellishment in this section, it is first necessary to explain briefly the rules and objectives of the ludus latrun- culorum, as far as we can ascertain from ancient texts and board diagrams found in Italy and Britain. Played on a plain board of either 6 x 6 or 8 x 8 squares, two individuals would contest against each other, using glass, circular pieces of differing colours to represent their soldiery.75 The objective of the game was to capture one's opponent's piece by surrounding it with two of one's own pieces on either rank or file; pieces were allowed to move backwards as well as forwards, but not diagonally. The winner was the player who had removed the most of his opponent's pieces. With this basic information in mind, we can turn to our author's treatment at LP 190-208. We will see that, from discussion of a man playing a board game, our author subtly transforms Piso into a general on a battlefield. The topic is introduced as follows {LP 190-4): te si forte iuvat studiorum pondere fessum non languere tarnen lususque movere per artem, callidiore modo tabula variatur aperta calculus et vitreo peraguntur milite bella, ut niveus nigros, nunc et niger alliget albos. When you are weary with the weight of your studies, if perhaps you are pleased not to be idle but to start games of skill, in a more clever way you vary the moves of your counters on the open board, and wars are fought out by a soldiery of glass, so that at one time a white counter binds blacks, and at another a black binds whites.76 74 In adopting this strategy, our poet may be influenced by the slippage between real life and game playing which is detectable in Greek thought, pessoi, board games which operate according to a structured system of rules, seem to have been viewed by some Greeks as symbolic of the workings of society as a whole, such that playing a good game was like participating properly in society; cf. esp. Arist. Pol. 1.2.9-12, 1253al-18; see further L. Kurke, 'Ancient Greek board games and how to play them', CPh 94 (1999), 247-67. But it remains a dangerous strategy none the less, as gaming can equally be viewed as inadequate substitution for real action. The first and perhaps most famous example of /?esso/-playing occurs among the suitors at the beginning of the Odyssey (1.106-12), a pastime which comes to symbolize their idleness and inaction when compared to the proactive and heroic Odysseus (Kurke [n. 74], 253-5). /5 Cf. Ov. Ars ars am. 2.208, Tr. ¿All. lhe glass counters may have been technically known as oculi (Plin. HN 36.197), though our author refers to them as calculi {LP 193, 196). 76 My translation of LP 190-208 makes some use of the one by Richmond ([n.68], 175), though Richmond is surely wrong to keep repeating the word 'counter', thus missing the delib- erate slippage between gaming and real battle action in this section. A similar desire to render this section an accurate description of a board game mars the translation of J.W. Duff {Minor Latin Poets [Cambridge, MA, 1934], 294-315). Closer to the military ambience of the passage is Austin's translation ([n. 68], 30).</page><page sequence="21">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 517 The introduction strikes a similar note of defensiveness to the one we have already seen with regard to Piso's musical and poetic leisure activities. Our author's spe- cific claim that Piso plays the game in order to avoid idleness (190-1) attempts straight away to establish the Indus latrunculorum as a worthwhile cerebral pursuit and defend it from accusations of sloth. The poet starts by keeping in sight the technicalities of the board game. All mention of wars being waged (193 peragun- tur ... bella) is set strictly within the context of a gaming board (192 tabula), with counters (193 calculus) and an army made of glass (193 vitreo ... milite), alliget (194) appears to be a technical term in the game whereby one piece can immobilize, but not capture others.77 From this point on, however, the board game gradually recedes from view as the author slips into battle narrative (LP 195-6): sed tibi quis non terga dedit? quis te duce cessit calculus? aut quis non periturus perdidit hostem? Yet who did not offer his back to you? Who gave way when you were his leader (the counter, I mean)? Or who, on the point of dying himself, did not destroy an enemy? The effect of the delayed calculus in 196, which I have attempted to reproduce in the translation above, is to dupe the reader into interpreting the subjects of the rhetorical questions as real men on a battlefield. This impression is aided by anthropomorphic and sentimentalizing language which takes us far away from the bland realm of flat game counters: these fighters have backs (195 terga), a leader (195 duce) and encounter enemies in the face of death (196 periturus). Moreover, the quick succession of apostrophes/rhetorical questions raises the emotional level of the passage in a way not dissimilar to introductions to the aristeiai of epic heroes on the battlefield.78 From this point on, we find ourselves in the midst of a battle proper (LP 197-200): mille modis acies tua dimicat: ille petentem dum fugit, ipse rapit; longo venit ille recessu, qui stetit in speculis; hic se committere rixae audet et in praedam venientem decipit hostem. Your battle line joins combat in a thousand ways: this one captures while he is fleeing; this one, who stood on look-out, comes from a remote spot far away; another one dares to trust himself to the struggle, and deceives an enemy as he was coming on the spoil. Not only do these lines make no reference to any paraphernalia from the board game: they actually contradict our evidence for how the game was played. We have no evidence for there being a 'thousand ways' to join battle (197). Moreover, these lines detail attacks made by individuals (197-99 ille ... ipse ... ille ... hie), whereas the rules of the ludus latrunculorum require two pieces to make a capture. 77 For discussion, see Richmond (n. 68), 169-73. /8 For this (particularly Homeric) start to the epic hero s aristeia, cf. e.g. Horn. //. 5.703^ (Hector), 8.273 (Teucer), 11.299-300 (Hector), 16.692-3 (Patroclus), Verg. Aen. 11.664-5 (Camilla); see further E. Block, 'The narrator speaks: apostrophe in Homer and Vergil', TAPhA 112 (1982), 21.</page><page sequence="22">518 STEVEN J. GREEN More generally, the 'individualistic' air given to the fighters here does not fit well with a game for which there is no evidence of pieces having different powers and classes.79 In its stead, our author seeks to create an exciting account of warfare, where passive counters have been replaced with active, conscious fighters, with the ability to be bold (200 audei) and deceive (200 decipit), and where a plain, squared playing board has been replaced with the classic battle terrain of the speculum (199, 'lookout, watchtower') and the reces sus (198, 'remote spot, retreat'). The section concludes as follows (LP 201-8): ancipites subit ille moras similisque ligato obligat ipse duos; hie ad maiora movetur, ut citius effracta prorumpat in agmina mandra clausaque deiecto populetur moenia vallo. interea sectis quamvis acerrima surgant 205 proelia militibus, plena tarnen ipse phalange aut tantum pauco spoliata milite vincis, et tibi captiva resonat manus utraque turba. That one risks dangerous traps and, apparently entrapped itself, counter-traps two oppo- nents; this one is moved to greater things, so that when the formation is broken, he may quickly burst into the columns, and so that, when the rampart is overthrown, he may devastate the enclosed city. Meanwhile, however keenly the battle rages with soldiers in their divided ranks, you conquer with a formation that is full, or bereft of only a few soldiers, and each of your hands rattles with its band of captives. The narrative is still coloured with 'real' military imagery, especially in the storming of the city in 203-4, but other details intrude to move us back to the specifics and technicalities of the board game, ligato and obligat (201-2), much like alliget earlier (194), appear to be technical gaming terms for immobilizing pieces,80 and mandra (203) may refer in this game to an unbroken mass or 'drove' of pieces across the board.81 The soldiers, the subject of active verbs before, start to look again like passive moveable pieces: hie ad maiora movetur (202). Our poet does, however, have one very important reason for breaking the 'real battle' illusion and bringing us back to the game. The end of this section sees Piso as winner of the game, triumphantly holding the pieces he has captured (208). One very interesting piece of information about the ludus latrunculorum is preserved in SHA Quatt. Tyr. 13.2: cum in quodam convivio (Proculus) ad latrunculos lud- eretur atque ipse decies imperator exisset, 'When Proculus was playing the little soldiers at a certain banquet and had left ten times (being hailed) as 'commander/ emperor' ...'. The winner of the game was hailed imperator. For a work which is, I suggest, designed to celebrate Piso's suitability for the position of Emperor, there can surely be no more fitting ending to the eulogy than to have Piso hailed as imperator. 79 See Richmond (n. 68). 167. 80 See Richmond (n. 68), 169-73. 81 See Austin (n. 68), 28; also Richmond (n. 68), 173-7.</page><page sequence="23">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 519 VI. 57 YEARS YOUNG? THE RHETORICAL FORCE OF 'IUVENIS9 My overall argument is that the thematic drive of the LP points most fittingly to a Piso in his important revolutionary year of a.d. 65. Let us return finally to the two apparent objections to such a dating raised by Champlin.82 The first of these objections - that the LP does not refer to Piso's exile, wife or son - may be dealt with fairly briefly. Discussion of Piso's exile in a.d. 40, however unfair and undeserved,83 would surely have been felt unsuitable, in terms of both theme and tone, in an upbeat eulogy of Piso's contemporary virtues. As for the absence of Piso's wife and children from the LP, this is nothing unusual in a piece of praise which centres on the achievements and merits of the individual. A useful comparison might be made with the Laudes (or Panegyricus) Messallae, a eulogy to the famous Augustan literary patron which is commonly attributed to Tibullus (3.7). Allusions to foreign warfare within this poem have been used to establish date parameters for the piece of between 27 and 26 b.c.84 By this date, Messalla had a young son of about ten years by the name of Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus.85 He may well have had a wife (or wives) by this date as well.86 In spite of this, no mention is made of any wife or offspring in the Laudes Messallae, or indeed any individual other than the patron. However important such domestic details might seem to modern readers in establishing the character of the addressee, they seem to have been regarded as surplus to requirement in Roman eulogistic writing unless they could be made to reflect back positively on the addressee.87 Against this background, it is easy to see why our author might not have wanted to deflect attention from his central addressee in this way: the presence of a wife and child add nothing to the military side of Piso, nor does the author need to excuse them in the same way as Piso's artistic activities:88 therefore, they are simply passed over in silence. Absence of domestic details, then, might well be a recognized feature of the genre rather than a useful indicator of date. The more problematic of Champlin's objections, at first glance, concerns the reference to Piso as iuvenis (three times, at LP 32, 109, 211). Many scholars have maintained that this information should 82 See § I above. 83 The reason for Piso's exile is shrouded in mystery, though it appears to have centred on Caligula's lust for Piso's new bride, Livia Orestilla; see Champlin (n. 3), 116-17. 84 See H. Schoonhoven, 'The panegyricus Messallae. Date and relation with Catalepton 9', ANRW 2.30.3 (1983), 1702. 85 There is inscriptional evidence for Messalinus' induction into the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis in 17 b.c.; Messalinus' new sacred position is the subject of Tibullus' poem 2.5, and it is therefore assumed that he must originally have been inducted shortly before Tibullus' death, i.e. 19-18 b.c. Given that priesthoods could be given to the offspring of nobility as young as fifteen years old, Syme has argued for a birth date for Messalinus of 36-35 b.c.; see R. Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford, 1986), 230. 86 For the uncertainty and debate surrounding this aspect of Messalla's life, see Syme (n. 85), 230-2. 87 See R. Rees, 'The private lives of public figures in Latin prose panegyric', in M. Whitby (ed.), The Propaganda of Power: The Role of Panegyric in Late Antiquity (Leiden, 1998), 77-101. 88 Tacitus records rumours {Ann. 15.53, 39) that Piso eloped with Satria Galla while she was still the wife of his friend, Domitius Silius, but there is no way of recovering how much of a live scandal this may or may not have been.</page><page sequence="24">520 STEVEN J. GREEN be used as a primary means of establishing date parameters for the poem. It is typically argued that, as the term iuvenis is only appropriate for a man under the age of 45, or 50 at the absolute maximum, it follows that the LP could not have been written later than a.d. 58 (if one accepts Champlin's date for Piso's birth as a.D. 8); by a.d. 65, however, Piso would have been 56 or 57 years old, too old to be credibly labelled a iuvenis. This argument has carried undue weight for too long. It is articulated in terms of a determinably 'proper' versus improper' usage of iuvenis, dependent on the presumed age of Piso: but this is a misguided strategy on (at least) two counts. First, it should be noted that it is already somewhat unusual for the younger person (the poet, aged 18 or 19, cf. LP 261) to be referring to the older person (Piso, at least 30 on Champlin's reconstruction of his life) as iuvenis. In her detailed study of Latin addresses, Dickey notes that it is much more common for the speaker of such a term to be older than its recipient (and offers only three examples from poetry to the contrary), adding, 'I know of no examples, however, in which the speaker of iuvenis is significantly younger than the addressee'.89 The age gap in our instance would be at least eleven years, significant in real and conceptual terms, the speaker being close to half the age of the addressee. Dickey's study would suggest that, whatever the exact ages of the two protagonists, the usage of iuvenis in our case, while it may not be unique, is very uncommon. Secondly, one must look more closely at the specific age category of iuventus in antiquity. From legal and philosophical perspectives, iuventus appears to have covered two quite distinct age ranges, which carried with them different ideological significances. At the lower end of the scale, between the ages of about 14 and 25, iuvenis could be meaningfully translated 'youth' or 'young man', as it overlapped with terms such as puer and adulescens.90 At the upper end of the scale, however, iuvenis could be used of a man of considerable life experience - he may be mar- ried, or have a military and/or political career - such that the translation 'young adult male' would be more appropriate.91 Roman philosophical theorists suggest an upper limit for iuventus of between 45 and 50.92 But philosophical posturing does not determine everyday usage. Indeed, we have evidence of a man at the age of 50 being described in his epitaph as 'in the flower of youth', rather than at its upper limit.93 Evidence such as this suggests that, much like today, the use of age terms was typically imprecise, subjective, impressionistic, and dependent on speaker and circumstance. To the sentimental dedicator of the epitaph, then, this man appeared to be much younger than his years might suggest. Compare also the description of Hannibal as senex at the battle of Zama in 202 b.c. (Livy 30.30.10) 89 See E. Dickey, Latin Forms of Address from Plautus to Apuleius (Oxford, 2002), 196. 90 Cf. e.g. Stat. Silv. 5.2.97 (sixteen year-old), LP 260 iuvenile decus (the poet under the age of twenty); see further Dickey (n. 99), 195-7. For the interchangeability of puer/ adulescens with iuvenis, see J.-P. Neraudau, La Jeunesse dans littérature et les institutions de la Rome républicaine (Paris, 1979), 125-9. 91 See esp. E. Eyben, Restless Youth in Ancient Rome (London, 1993), 24-8, 42-80. 92 Cf. esp.

Orig. 11.2.5 (iuventus lasts up to the age of 50); see further Neraudau (n. 90), 93-5, Eyben (n. 91), 6-9.

(Cic. Phil. 2.46.118). At the time in question, however, both men were around the age of 44: rather than indicators of exact age, therefore, the terms are impressionistic, as they contrast the tired general with the (still) vigorous defender of the Roman state.94 To sum up this part: rather than speak in terms of proper versus improper usage of iuvenis in the LP, we need to recognize that the use of the term in our instance is: i) unusual in any event, given the relative ages of speaker and addressee, and; ii) not necessarily indicative of age parameters, given the impressionistic usage of age terms in antiquity. I return now to my own argument. Having established the general slipperiness of age categories in antiquity, one must next ask whether or not iuvenis is a viable means of reference for a Piso in his late fifties. Indeed it is. For one thing, though the ancient theorists regard 45-50 as a cut-off point for iuventus, they also declare that senectus starts at 60. 95 One needs to ask, therefore, how one is supposed to conceptualize the intervening ten to fifteen years. Some Romans at least conceptual- ized a period of 'middle age' between the end of iuventus and the beginning of senectus,96 but there was no recognized way of referring to a person of this age in the same manner as terms like iuvenis or senex.97 In place of a more definite term, then, iuvenis would appear to be as appropriate as senex for describing a man of 57. But iuvenis is much more than simply a viable term of reference for a 57-year old. In our instance, I would argue that it might form a strategic move on the part of the poet which is consistent with his general aims for the LP. To put it another way: if one is a hopeful client looking to paint the picture of an energetic, multi- talented 57- year-old patron, what are the benefits of referring to him as iuvenis? First, and in conjunction with the militarization of Piso's pursuits elsewhere, the use of iuvenis maintains the illusion of a man who is still young enough to embark upon a glowing military career. Our evidence suggests that it was highly unlikely that a 57-year old would still be an active solider.98 For the Romans, warfare was the occupation of the iuvenis, a term often etymologically linked to iuvare, in that a iuvenis was someone who could 'bring aid' to the state, especially on the military front.99 For this reason, iuvenis is commonly used as a synonym of miles. m Secondly, and not mutually exclusive with the last point, the rhetoric of youth had been well used for Octavian/Augustus over a long period of his life in order to project an image of the princeps as an energetic individual with much to 94 See further Parkin (n. 93), 15-26. 95 Cf. esp.

In this regard, it is worth noting that the term senior is used as a mark of respect rather than an indication of specific age; see further Dickey (n. 89), 197-8. 98 Gell. 10.28.1, apparently citing Aelius Turbo (first century b.c.), suggests an age of 45 years as the upper limit for military service. Only in emergencies were older men conscripted; see further Parkin (n. 93), 95-6. Piso is only two to three years from being 60, the standard commencement of senectus; for the standard view that old age was unsuitable for warfare, see Tac. Ann. 1.17, Parkin (n. 93), 242^1. 99 For the etymology, cf. Censorinus, De die natali '42, Isid. Orig. 11.2.16, R. Maltby, A Lexicon of Ancient Latin Etymologies (Leeds, 1991), 320 s.v.; see further Neraudau (n. 90), 98; Evben in. 91), 42-52. 100 See esp.

In contemporary literature, iuvenis becomes a popular discreet reference to Octavian/ Augustus, both before and after the Battle of Actium.101 Official portraiture of the Emperor contributes to the motif of a seemingly timeless individual who remains ever young: the famous Prima Porta type statue of Augustus, dated to 27 b.c., was never updated in the further forty years of his rule.102 If Piso is a man of imperial pedigree for whom age labels defy his years, he is in the very best imperial company. Taking into account the symbolic and eulogistic connotations behind iuvenis, I would argue that its use in the LP, noteworthy but not overplayed, helps to focus attention away from the onset of senectus and contributes to the sense of military expectation in the figure of Piso; much like the first Roman Emperor, Piso is fashioned as a (future) leader of considerable 'youthful' energy with still more achievements ahead of him.103 VII. CONCLUSION: OPTIONS AND CONTINUING DEBATE In the previous sections, I have argued on thematic grounds for dating the Laus Pisonis to a.D. 65, around the time of the Pisonian conspiracy. I maintain that it is only at this time, when Piso is seeking to set himself up as a credible alternative to Nero, that the structure, style and thematic direction of the LP make the most sense and have their most potential impact. In the process, I have been challenging the current scholarly consensus on the dating of the poem to c. a.d. 40. Given the oblique nature of the poem's sentiments, my argument might be felt to have involved some heavy interpretation of the obscure, and a dose of special pleading in the usage of the term iuvenis. But on balance, I am convinced that a.d. 65 is a better dating than a.d. 40: I am ultimately prepared to admit poetic (and considered) licence in the use of iuvenis than to accept that the thematic thrust of the poem - the militarization of the addressee and the excusing of leisure activities - would be at all suitable for a newly elected consul in a.d. 40. Assuming this to be the case, I must finally say something about the intended audience for the poem. My argument suggests that the LP remained a work for a closed audience outside the immediate circles of Nero: it is most unlikely, given his track record of eliminating potential rivals, that an increasingly paranoid Nero would have tolerated a work of such high praise to a powerful individual. I would therefore contend that the LP was composed before the conspiracy and was (destined to be) given to Piso for his consultation; if he so liked it, it might 101 Over a period of roughly ten years (c. 40-27 b.c.), Octavian is fashioned as iuvenis in Verg. Eel. 1.42, G. 1.500, Hor. Carm. 1.2.41 (with R.G.M. Nisbet and M. Hubbard, A Commentary on Horace: Odes Book I [Oxford, 1970], ad loc.) and (possibly) Hor. Serm. 2.5.62. 102 See esp. R.R.R. Smith, 'Typology and diversity in the portraits of Augustus', JRA 9 (1996), 31-47; D. Steiner, 'Semblance and storytelling in Augustan Rome', in G.K. Galinsky (ed.), Cambridge Companion to the Age of Augustus (Cambridge, 2005), 207-17. 103 We may dismiss more readily the idea that Piso's age can be determined from the youth- ful crowd (iuventus) that attends his private declamations (LP 84-6); for the view, see e.g. Champlin (n. 3), 116 n. 36. In fact, Piso's activities appear to attract the attention of the popu- lace at large (cf. LP 1 87-8), thus providing a flattering impression of a man who can reach out to and inspire different sectors of Roman society; cf. Plin. Pan. 45-7, where Trajan, 46 at the time of Pliny's oration (a.d. 100), is able to provide moral inspiration for everyone in society, including the iuventus (47.1).</page><page sequence="27">'(NO) ARMS AND A MAN' 523 have been used as positive propaganda for him in his imperial ambitions. Whether or not our author was successful in any of his aims is, of course, impossible to recover. Modern scholars tend to suggest that the LP does not work as a serious endorsement of its addressee, but such views are inevitably influenced by Piso's sudden demise: if Piso had become Emperor, I suspect that we might hold a more charitable view of the rhetorical power of the LP. Ultimately, the poem will continue to resist conclusive dating because of the lack of specificity surrounding the poem's content, as well as our lack of knowledge about the mercurial figure of Piso but for certain highlights in his career. We are, however, fully justified to talk in terms of levels of firmness of argument. Taking the poem as a whole, I believe that the LP should be located in the latter years of Nero's reign, and should take its place among the contemporary literary documents that help us to shed light not only on the man of the conspiracy of a.d. 65 but also on Roman negotiation about the ideal qualities for an Emperor at a time of leadership crisis.
