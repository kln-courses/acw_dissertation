<plain_text><page sequence="1">Purposive Evolution : The Link between Science and Religion. By Edmund Noble. (London : George Alien &amp; Unwin. 1926. Pp. ix + 578. Price r8s.) It is symptomatic of a period of transition that when one takes up a work on Purposive Evolution one has to ask : What does the author mean by Evolution; what by Purposive ? In Mr. Edmund Noble's well-written, well-planned, and assuredly not over-condensed book, the reiterated stress is on self-maintenance. " The aim," he says, " of the relational philosophy is to unify the self-maintaining organism with the self-maintaining universe; . . . to universalize so-called ' intelligence' by showing it to be primarily neither a conscious nor even an organic process, but a process rooted in the very nature of power" (p. 155). 399</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES By power we are to understand the " driving force behind phenomena " (p. 187) ; the " thrust from which Nature's own harmonies proceed " (p. 199); " the universal source of energy " (p. 201) ; " the impulsion to self-main? tenance " (p. 367); " the dynamic urge towards a goal " (p. 377). In virtue of this power " the universe is at once a self-differentiating and a self- equalizing system" (p. 203). In a passage which, like many others, is reminiscent of Herbert Spencer, Mr. Noble says : " Alike for bodies that meet with a resistance which finally brings them to rest and for members of moving systems which are sooner or later adjusted to each other by equili- bration?alike for forces gravitative, electromagnetic, chemical, biochemical and muscular?change is a procession from conditions of differential stress towards conditions of equalized stress. Motion and change of motion are ways through which differential stresses automatically eliminate themselves by finding their goal in configurations and forms that endure. And it is these forms which we know as teleological, purposive, 'intelligent.' The sign of their teleology, simple and complex, incipient and complete, is equal? ized stress?the endurance which, relative as it may be, results from the automatic elimination of differential stress. They seem ' designed,' ' put together for a purpose,' display the character of ' intelligent adaptations,' because they are so many goals of conservation reached by a self-maintaining universe engaged in converting differences into likenesses " (pp. 205-6). Thus we reach " the conception of a self-complicating, yet also of a self-ordering cosmos sufficient unto itself . . . a world of definite tendency wherein the goal of the conflict and the striving is prefigured from the beginning " (p. 523). For, " the future is dynamically present in each organic system as so many foreshadowed stages in which, under favouring conditions, the incipient stages are to find their goal. In man this goal is illumined more or less by consciousness : it is dark, but none the less potent, within the organic system " (p. 427). Whether the concept of " power," as the driving force behind phenomena and the universalized source of energy, is regarded as scientific or as other than scientific, will depend on what one understands and accepts as distinctive of the method of science. Whether Mr. Noble's use of the word " cause " is in line with that of modern science or not, again depends on the manner in which the field of scientific inquiry is delimited. And whether his ruling concept of self-maintenance is equivalent to de facto endurance, or implies something explanatory of this?whether, too, the oft-repeated words " goal" and " end " mean just de facto outcome or imply something more than this? must be gathered from the context rather than from any searching discussion in the pages of this book. It may be a travesty of a notion that has its roots in causa sui to say that it is exemplified by the procedure of the Irishman who held himself suspended in mid-air by a firm grasp of his coat-collar, but the full significance of self-maintenance seems to call for further and fuller elucidation than it receives. As it is, one must make the best one can of such statements as " the organism wielding itself, in possession of itself " (p. 453) ; having " a directing power over its own units and their activities " (p. 340); and " the self-direction of a system which, instead of being merely pushed or pulled, maintains and therefore wields itself " (p. 490). Passing now to Evolution, if we take it as a process which may be described in some detail and of which certain generalized statements may be made on the basis of scientific inquiry up to date, the question arises : Does Evolution explain ? This is discussed in Mr. Noble's thirteenth chapter. Using the word " explain " in a sense defined by his use of the word " cause," the conclusion reached is that it does not explain. It stands in need of 400</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS explanation in terms of purposive self-maintenance as operative cause. So, too, in a later chapter on " Purposiveness or Natural Selection ? " we read : " Nothing is plainer than that the changes through which the ascending organism reaches its goal constitute a definite and orderly progress towards that goal, and that for this purpose no mere survival of variations which ' happen ' to be useful will suffice : it requires a constantly operative stress working for the production of correlated, life-favouring and therefore purposive modifications irrespective and in advance of whatever may happen to the variations after they are produced " (p. 418). " In its most general aspect evolution is a movement in which the cosmos, giving rise to difference, insists on likeness?toils, in a word, towards self- recovery from the differentiations that have arisen within it." For "to a universe of striving, difference is essential; in a universe which is to achieve, likeness is fundamental" (p. 519). The stress, then, is on purposive self- maintenance of which the observed phenomena of evolution are the expression. But the words " purposive," " teleological," " intelligent " ; the words " end," " goal," " directive " ; presumably the words " striving," " achieve," and the like?all these words are used in a sense that is " sublimely free from the limitations of human intelligence " ; in a sense which implies that man " is able to transcend anthropomorphism, biomorphism, psychomorphism " (p. 102). These introduce " the factor of illusion." " By no interpretation of physics and by no resort to metaphysics can we weave illusion into the ' argument from design,' based on the notion of an overruling conscious intelligence resembling our own, without destroying its very fabric " (p. 125). None the less, if we start from some simple object of sensory acquaintance and scientific knowledge, " we intuitively feel the something that transcends knowledge." " What we may depend on is that the cosmos . . . is working out some vast process in which life is included, but which life does not exhaust." " There must be a realm which yields no phenomena, a super-real which is rendered inaccessible to us at once by its nature and by ours." " The sense of a something that transcends us is imposed, not by mere feeling, not as a logical opposite, but by a supreme act of the reason itself " (pp. 467-9). Enough has been said to indicate, but in so short a space barely to indicate, Mr. Noble's avenue of approach to ' the link between science and religion." It is difficult to do justice to a thoughtful and carefully elaborated work of 570 pages in less than thrice as many words. In the few that remain one or two passages may be cited to show Mr. Noble's attitude towards the vexed problem of the evolutionary genesis of mental and conscious relations. " The reason why we are conscious of both means and ends is that our relational activities involve us in the shocks of continually and suddenly changing adjustments to environment. The sessile plant, experiencing no such shocks, is not quickened into awareness of what it is doing; so the animal, in the development of its organs, as in the carrying out of its internal processes, is engaged in activities that . . . are not broken up into varia? tions and vicissitudes, and do not, therefore, shake the system into awareness of them " (p. 359). " From the threatened negation of maintenance comes the shock we call pain, from the new affirmation of maintenance the shock we call pleasure ; and each is founded in a purely physical attitude of the organ? ism to its own experiences, imposed or self-originated " (p. 451). " Feeling was first a sense of contact with objects. When the organism began to receive nutriment at a particular part of its body the sense of taste was developed. Particles diffused in air were utilized for the sense of smell, 2E 401</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES atmospheric vibrations for the sense of hearing. . . . The development of vision worked a sort of miracle . . . by converting the subtile interchanges between objects, eye-lens, retina and brain into the definite picture of an external world" (p. 433). " Sensations, reactions from incident forces, would be without form and void were it not for a power which, bearing down on the physical correlates of the conscious states, segregates, organizes and correlates them in ways that yield the maximum utility for self-maintenance. The mind is such a power, and we can only mean by mind not the sum of the conscious states, but the total brain and nerve system on which the function of guidance has been imposed " (p. 482). C.
