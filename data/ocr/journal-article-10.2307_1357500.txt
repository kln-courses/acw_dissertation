The final phase of the fieldwork in 1994-1995 is summa- rized and interpreted here. Evidence suggests that rather than a single undisturbed set- tlement, there once were two prehistoric settlements which were destroyed in the 16th and 17th centuries C.E. by a series of major erosional episodes. The archaeological and ecofactual remains from one of the settlements was deposited in what was a freshwater pond. The other ended up as fill in a network of erosional gullies and in an outer series of rooms of the monastery. Further sherds and other artifacts from the area point to a number of periods of utilization of the monastery's environs from the beginning of the fourth millennium B.C.E. through this century. The Chalcolithic, Bronze Age, and Medi- eval-Modern ceramic assemblages, the chipped stone and ground stone assemblages, the glass assemblage, and the human osteological remains are presented as well.1 23</page><page sequence="2">24 RUPP ET AL.

RUPP) Introduction uring 1994-1995 the Western Cyprus Proj- ect (WCP) continued and completed the first phase of its fieldwork in the Pafos District in southwestern Cyprus which it began in 1992 (fig. 1).2 The primary focus of the WCP efforts was at the Middle Chalcolithic (ca. 3500-2800 calB.C.E.; Knapp 1993: table 1) "site" located in the vicinity of the church and ruined monastery of Agios Savvas tis Karonis (fig. 2) within the territory of the deserted village of Prastio on the eastern side of the middle portion of the Dhiarizos Potamos valley. In 1994- 1995 we completed the testing of the natural and archaeological strata begun in 1992 (Rupp et al. 1993).3 Determining the extent and the state of pres- ervation of the archaeological strata was stressed during this fieldwork.4 Agios Savvas was chosen in 1991 (Rupp et al. 1992) explicitly to test a hypothesis generated by the senior researchers on the Lemba Archaeologi- cal Project (LAP) concerning the changing nature of sociopolitical relations during the Middle Chal- colithic period in western Cyprus (Rupp et al. 1994). E. J. Peltenburg and D. L. Bolger postulate that the island's first episode of social integration and asym- metrical socioeconomic relationships took place during the later part of this period (Peltenburg 1993; 1996: 17-19). In addition, they argue that this oc- curred only at a few strategically and favorably lo- cated settlements in the southwestern part of Cyprus such as at Erimi Pamboula (Bolger 1988), Souskiou Laona (Hadjisavvas 1977: 228, fig. 1; Rupp et al. 1992: 291-92, fig. 10), and Kissonerga Mosphilia (Peltenburg 1991a) (fig. 1). Further, they claim that these larger, nodular settlements positioned near the coast or in the lower portion of a river valley, with rich and varied material cultures, differed from the majority of the settlements, which were smaller and scattered primarily throughout inland and upland locations. They argue that such settlements were unaffected by these sociopolitical developments. Agios Savvas's small size (approx. 2.5 ha surface ar- tifact scatter), inland location (approx. 17 km from</page><page sequence="3">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 25 WCP 1994/95 CPSP BOUNDARY N 9 -,.,". ?,.TRAKHYPEDHOULAo2 0i, PRASTIO Kilometers KA PAP H ',.

The areas chosen for excavation in 1994 (fig. 3)5 were designed to test the tentative hypotheses and assumptions generated after the 1993 field season (Rupp et al. 1994; Clarke and Rupp 1995). In essence, this fieldwork concentrated on attempting to support the working hypothesis that at this so-called site there were once two small Middle Chalcolithic settlements in the general area of the monastery, which were sep- arated from each other both physically and chrono- logically. It was assumed that the archaeological strata from these two settlements had eroded away completely at some point and were redeposited else- where. The postulated existence of a freshwater pond fed by a spring required further proof as well. The artifact scatter and erosional deposits at Ag- ios Savvas stretch up in the middle section of the valley slope for about 225 m from about 325 to 355 masl. This encompasses four cadastral plots com- prising Areas 1 through 4 (fig. 3).6 The 18 trenches, totaling approximately 43.5 m2, were excavated.7 They will be discussed briefly by area from the lowest and northernmost to the highest and southernmost.8 Area 3 This vineyard9 constitutes the lowest portion of the site with Middle Chalcolithic material (fig. 4).

Stratified pond sediments in Area 3 in (top) the southern scarp of N495E480 and (bottom) the southern scarp of N490E480 (drawn by D. W. Rupp after E. Kemp). sediment strata (Strata 2-4) with dense concentra- tions of archaeological materials detected in 1992 and 1993 (Rupp et al. 1993; 1994) were deposited as a series of colluvial fans immediately to the west of a streambed cut into the soft, marly limestone bed- rock of the Moni Formation of the Mamonia Com- plex, as was postulated previously (Rupp et al. 1994). Two 1 x 5 m trenches (N500E485 oriented north- south; N490E480 oriented east-west) were excavated to test this possibility. Trench N490E480 revealed a series of very compact concave strata (fig. 5) dipping toward the east and containing limited artifactual material but significant quantities of freshwater snail shells (D. S. Reese, personal communication 1998). These were deposited against and possibly over the soft marly limestone bedrock on the west. Basil Go- mez's analysis of seven sediment samples taken in 1993 from similar strata immediately to the north from the western scarp of N500E480 (fig. 5) suggests that they were deposited in a freshwater basin rather than a streambed (personal communication 1997). Al- though additional possible basin deposits were en- countered in the southern half of N500E485, the expected marly limestone bedrock in the middle sec- tion, seen close to the surface in the western part of the 5 x 5 grid module excavated in 1992, did not ma- terialize even at a greater depth. Instead a 1 m long sec- tion of a possible simple rubble wall (approx. 0.50 m wide) was revealed near the northern end of the trench (fig. 6). It has only an outer face on the north and runs approximately northeast-southwest. If this is a wall, its function (terracing?) and date are un- known at present, given the paucity of the artifactual material found in association with it. Area 2 The very compact and apparently unstratified sed- iments in this uncultivated field lying between Areas 3 and 1 (fig. 3) were tested briefly in 1992 by trenches N460E495 and N475E510 (Rupp et al. 1993).10 The denseness of these sediments, the very mixed but limited ceramics recovered, the size and openness of the field, and the lack of time and resources for man- ual excavation were sufficient reasons to warrant the use of a backhoe to probe the sediments here.

View of the northern portion of N500E485 in Area 3 from the south, showing the section of a possible terrace wall. 0.95 m wide trenches, oriented approximately north- south and east-west, were dug to an average depth of about 2.5 + m. With only one exception bedrock was not encountered. This includes a deep probe in the western part of the field which revealed sediments to a depth of at least 4.0+ m. These trenches represent approximately 87.9 m2 of exposure. The northern section of the north-south trench was some 24.5 m long. A gap of about 10.5 m separated it from the 28.5 m long southern section. At the southern end of the southern section of the north-south trench, bed- rock was struck at a relatively shallow depth. At the juncture between the hard, bedded limestone and the colluvial sediments, a small seep of water appeared. In the continuous east-west trench, approximately 39.5 m long, sections of three walls were encoun- tered. Near the western end (N460E480) a rubble wall, about 0.75 m wide and running northeast- southwest, was hit at a depth of approximately 1.50 m (fig. 7). This wall may date to the later Cypro-Archaic period (ca. 600-475 B.C.E.), as a whole Black-on- Red ware bowl with everted rim (PAS 94.7.30) was recovered near its northern face. A small deposit or favissa of approximately 24 terracotta female and other figurines (fig. 8) was cut by the backhoe at a slightly higher level immediately to the northwest of the wall. These finds may suggest the existence of a rural temenos here during the later Iron Age.11 To the east on the other side of the deep probe, another section of a rubble wall, about 0.68 m wide (fig. 9), was revealed at a slightly deeper depth (= N460E495). It runs approximately northeast-southwest as well. The limited finds point to a date in the Medieval period. At the eastern end of the backhoe trench (= N460E510), yet another wall section was encoun- tered at roughly a similar depth (fig. 10). It is con- structed of a large semi-ashlar block and rubble, measures about 0.43 m wide, and probably is best dated to this period, as a terracotta cover tile was found immediately adjacent to it. In the northern section of the north-south backhoe trench, two 0.95 x 1.0 m "trenches" were excavated at the bottom of the probe. One (N470E500) was at the southern end of the section, and the other (N485E500) was at the northern end at the juncture between Areas 3 and 2. Neither trench produced any architectural remains. Area 1 One of the two objectives in Area 1 (fig. 11) was to further elucidate the system of erosional gullies seen in the 1993 test trenches (Rupp et al. 1994) in this vineyard.12 This system contained significant quantities of Middle Chalcolithic materials (the equiv- alent of both Kissonerga Mosphilia 3a and 3b?; see Rupp et al. 1994). The specific location and direction of discharge at the lower end of the main gully were probed by another 1 x 2 m unit in the southwestern portion of N475E575. Unfortunately, the stratifica- tion here is more complex than in the 1993 1 x 2 m unit dug immediately to the northeast in the same 5 x 5 m square and in the 1 x 2 m unit in N470E575 to the southeast. A section of a possible havara floor of late date was encountered in the western portion of the unit. Below that the eastern side of the gully may exist. If so, then the gully appears to have run more to the northeast than previously suspected, following the present downward slope along the southeastern external wall of the monastery. To the south, the east- ern arm of the secondary gullies feeding the main</page><page sequence="8">30 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 ........:.. iiii~ii: .? : ... . .. ...... .....

The eastern edge of this gully was defined in the western portion of the trench. Directly to the east of this gully was a complex system of small, shallow tertiary rills. A 1 x 2 m trench oriented east-west was opened at N415E600 in an attempt to discover in situ material. The limestone bedrock was found, however, at a rel- atively shallow depth. At the end of the 1993 field season, during the topographical mapping work in the southwestern portion of the vineyard, worn Chalcolithic sherds, chipped stone debitage, ground stone tools, and un- worked picrolite pebbles were seen on the surface for the first time (Rupp et al. 1994). This area, situated at the base of the limestone bedrock scarp and terrace wall that separates this vineyard from another one above to the south (= Area 4; fig. 3), was well beyond the horizontal limits of the concentrations of artifacts seen in 1986 and 1991 (Rupp et al. 1992). The area wedged between the major bedrock scarp to the south- southeast and a less pronounced one to the northwest is relatively flat and trapezoidal in plan, measuring about 60 m northeast-southwest by about 6-12 m northwest-southeast. At first two 1 x 2 m trenches oriented east-west (N355E565 and N355E570) were opened up adjacent to each other near the eastern end to test the sediments. By chance Trench N355E565 was where the preserved floor of Building 1 was located. The other trench, N355E570, was positioned a meter and a half or so to the southeast. The original 1 x 2 m unit was expanded 0.5 x 1.0 m to the south and to the north (fig. 12). Trench N355E565 revealed an undulating plas- tered havara floor in a poor state of preservation (fig. 13). A stratum of fine, dark ashy sediment ap- proximately 15-20 cm thick overlaid this floor (fig. 14). Large coarse ware sherds and some ground stone tools rested on or just above the floor surface (fig. 15). The original 1 x 2 m unit was expanded to the south and to the north. Subsequently two 1.00 x 1.30 m north-south extensions were excavated to the south- east and to the northeast (= N360E565). The excava- tion of the northern part of N355E565 and N360E565 revealed that the floor was broken off at the north by a deep V-shaped gully or cleft running approxi- mately east-west. Immediately to the north of this cleft a small portion of the floor's subsurface packing was found but at a lower level than to the south. In the southeastern extension, a section of a well-built, curving(?) rubble wall approximately 0.60 m wide was revealed (fig. 12). The floor, however, does not touch the wall's northern inner face as a narrow fissure or cleft running northeast-southwest inter- venes. Along the eastern edge of N355E565, a 0.20 x 1.50 m north-south section of the floor and its foundation sediments were excavated down to bed- rock. The packing immediately under the floor con- sists of a layer with a high density of small stones, pebbles, and sherds. The relatively high density of sherds continues down almost to the fissured bedrock surface. The bedrock slopes from the lower northern part to the higher southern part adjacent to the wall (fig. 14). The other trench, N355E570, situated to the south- east, presumably was outside the circular(?) structure (fig. 12). A curving line of bedrock was found in the southeastern portion of the trench. The bedrock ap- pears to have been cut back to approximate roughly the curve of the outer face of the structure. Between the bedrock and the wall was a thick stratum of fine, ashy, dark sediment similar to that seen just above the floor inside the wall. This stratum was found as well immediately to the west in the limited exposure to the south of the wall in N355E565. Because the floor does not touch the wall's inner face and because it was not clear if the wall actually curved, excava- tors were prompted to dig further in this area. A 2 x 2 m unit was opened in N355E570 and N360E570 some 20 cm to the west of N355E565 and 20 cm north of the previous unit in N355E570. It was de- signed to intercept the presumed curving wall and to reveal more both of the interior and exterior strata associated with the structure. This unit proved to be a paradigm of the "site" as a whole. The east- west deep fissure or cleft from N355E565 continued through the entire northern portion of the unit. Along the western scarp a small gully ran from it northeast- southwest to the south. Another fissure ran east-west along the southern scarp. It most likely continued to the west under the wall to connect with the fissure seen along the inner face of the wall in N355E565. This geomorphological and erosional activity across most of the unit left only a short stub of the curving wall in the southwestern corner. Fortunately, a small section of the floor remained in situ, sloping up to touch the wall's inner face (fig. 12). The stratification below the floor and its relationship to the under- lying bedrock are the same as in N355E565. Exca- vation of the 1 x 2 m area immediately to the west of the original wall segment revealed more fissuring and disturbed contexts.

To the south of this was another small northeast-southwest running crevice. There is now, therefore, sufficient evidence to label the architectural remains as "Build- ing 1." The interior diameter of this building, with an approximately circular plan, was about 6.40 m. The ceramic assemblage from above as well as below the floor points to a date for its construction and aban- donment in the earlier part of the Middle Chalcolithic period (see below, pp. 42-45). The extant curvi- linear portions of a wall combined with a plastered havara floor are characteristic of structures dating to the Middle Chalcolithic period (Peltenburg 1991a: 21-23, figs. 4-5).

The 1993 trenches excavated in the southern portion of Area 1 (fig. 11: N300E500, N290E600, N290E605, N290E610, N290E615, N290E620, N290E625)13 failed to reveal any Chal- colithic remains in situ or otherwise (Rupp et al. 1994). The Chalcolithic materials seen on the sur- face just below the bedrock scarp/terrace wall at the southern end of the vineyard (above), then, were thought to have come from the vineyard above to the south-southeast. Permission, therefore, was sought and obtained to test this vineyard, designated as Area 4 (fig. 3).14 Five 1 x 2 m trenches were opened up to sam- ple the vineyard's sediments (fig. 3). Its topography consists of a shallow trough gently descending from the southeast toward the north-northwest. The sides of the trough are on the northeast and southwest. The trenches broadly transected the trough and its eastern side. Four of them (N315E555, N320E600, N325E575, N330E585) revealed a thick stratum of colluvial sediments without any Early Prehistoric material. The fifth, N340E600, revealed a small ero- sional gully cut into the soft marly chalk bedrock at the eastern edge of the vineyard. The trench was then enlarged to 1 x 3 m to explore the gully further. The fact that the gully, which runs approximately north- west-southeast, contained some Chalcolithic sherds suggests that their probable source would have been farther to the southeast. This slightly higher area was a vineyard15 before it was bulldozed.

In late October, 1995, after the field was bulldozed, again no material was seen on the surface. The apparently significant accumulation of collu- vium in the vineyard, the severe time limitations for manual excavations, the presence of a backhoe at the site, and the easy access to the eastern edge of the vineyard at N320E600 without damaging the vines provided reasons and an opportunity to test the strata mechanically. The backhoe hit the bed- rock in this trench at about 2.5 + m. In the process it partially sectioned a buried archaeological feature in the northwestern portion of the trench (fig. 17). This feature was a small ossuary (fig. 18) cut into the northeastern face of a small erosional gully which ran northwest-southeast. The gully was buried in a distinct stratum some 0.80 m deep, which in turn was covered by the more recent stratum of collu- vium, 1.6+ m thick. The trough-shaped ossuary measures at least 1.2 m long by 0.40-0.45 m wide by approximately 0.30 m deep. It probably was cut into the bedrock using picks made from antlers of Dama mesopotamica (fig. 19). The ossuary apparently once was covered by at least six irregular, unworked flat slabs of hard lime- stone (fig. 20). The poorly preserved, incomplete, and disarticulated remains (see below, pp. 50-51) of at least seven individuals (3 adults [1 male and 2 fe- males], 1 child, 2 infants, and 1 newborn) were re- covered. It seems likely that the material originated in either graves or some other context in which the bodies were permitted to decay. Afterwards, when the corpses had decomposed elsewhere, the collec- tion concentrated mainly on the more obvious bones (i.e., the crania and the larger leg bones) for deposi- tion in the ossuary. The haphazard placement of these bones in the ossuary suggests that a perfunctory ap- proach might also have been adopted in the matter of their selection (P. W. Croft, personal communication 1995). A necklace(?) made from a large picrolite cruciform figurine (see below, pp. 55-56) and small Dentalium shells was the only funerary offering re- covered.16 The ossuary is the first securely attested for Chalcolithic Cyprus. This practice of secondary burial, however, has been suggested by a number of researchers for the Middle Chalcolithic graves in the extramural cemeteries at Souskiou Laona and Vathyr- kakas and Kouklia Vathyrkakas and now documented at the recent excavations at Souskiou Vathyrkakas by Demos Christou (personal communication 1997). Area 5 In the vineyard which lies immediately to the north of the northwestern portion of Area 3 (fig. 3) there was a light to medium scatter of artifacts on its cultivated surface. The chipped stone material collected in the 1991 systematic surface survey in the vineyard (Rupp et al. 1992: 289, fig. 5: line 13 + 2.2 and grab sample 99.8) had possible Ceramic Neolithic characteristics according to C. D'Annibale. In May 1995 an additional collection was made from the vineyard's surface. Only a very limited quantity of the artifacts recovered, however, could be assigned to an Early Prehistoric date (see below, table 7). 1994-1995 MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC CERAMICS (JOANNE T. CLARKE) Area 1: Building 1 Overview The 1994-1995 field season produced the first securely stratified pottery at the site. The area of the preserved wall and associated plastered havara floor of Building 1 had limited quantities of sherds that could be analyzed, comprising Red-on-White ware (RW), Red Monochrome Painted ware (RMP), and Coarse Ware (CW). These were found in a deposit immediately above the floor of Building 1 and in greater quantities below it (fig. 14). For the analysis of the pottery from Building 1, the sherds have been divided into the nine distinct strata that were recog- nized by the excavators. 1. plow zone, cultivated 2. plow zone, uncultivated 3. "undisturbed" erosional strata above the floor deposit 4. "undisturbed" stratum outside of the building17 5. fill of major east-west fissure 6. fill of minor northeast-southwest crack 7. undisturbed deposit above the floor18 8. the plastered havara floor 9. undisturbed/sealed deposit below the floor All of the strata were characterized by high per- centages of abraded Chalcolithic pottery. Apart from Strata 4, 8, and 9, the strata were contaminated by later pottery (table 1). The in situ "mixed" layer (Stratum 3), immediately above the floor deposit (Stratum 7), contained very small quantities of RW and CW sherds of types identical to that found in</page><page sequence="16">38 RUPP ET AL.

Although this layer was "undis- turbed," the presence of the later sherds suggests that it represents erosional materials deposited sometime in the past. Overlying the preserved. havara floor surface was a deposit of fine, dark, ashy sediment (Stratum 7; fig. 14) which contained the majority of the sherds recovered in this area. Although slightly contami- nated, this deposit represents, along with Stratum 4, the material from the occupation and abandonment of the structure. The contamination of this stratum was probably caused by erosional sediments in the V-shaped fill of a narrow fissure which ran north- east-southwest along the interior face of the wall. The later pottery probably represents material from the uneven interface of the fissure fill and the floor deposit which was inadvertently included during excavation of the floor deposit. Stratum 4, found im- mediately outside of the structure, while uncontami- nated, nonetheless had a high percentage of abraded Chalcolithic sherds (68% of the total quantity; 61% of the total weight). This may suggest that these sherds were subjected at some point to movement from farther up the slope. Loci 11 and 15 of Stratum 7 contained the largest number of well-preserved sherds lying directly upon the havara floor (fig. 15). In Locus 11 these include a CW shallow tray of an unusual shape with very low walls (1; fig. 21:1; PAS 94.7.55). There are also</page><page sequence="18">40 RUPP ET AL.

These sherds are similar in morphology to examples from Erimi Pamboula (Bolger 1988: fig. 5:1018) and Lemba Lakkous (Peltenburg 1985: fig. 46.7). This shape is fairly typical for the Middle Chalcolithic period, and one could expect to find it in both ear- lier and later contexts. Other RMP sherds occur in small quantities, as do unidentifiable Chalcolithic sherds. There is a single rim sherd from a small RW bowl of unknown shape. Very little decoration has survived on it apart from a worn rim band on the exterior surface. There are also seven later sherds from Locus 11. The pottery found in association with Locus 15, the stratum lying directly above the fissure and the floor, is identical in nature to the pottery from Locus 11. The deposit contained the rim sherds of two RMP basins (4; fig. 21:3; PAS 94.7.54) which are identical in fabric and finish to the two examples found in Locus 11. Although the fragments from Loci 11 and 15 could not be joined, the shape, fab- ric, and technology of the RMP basins and the other associated pottery would suggest that the two loci are the same. Like Locus 11, 15 contained mostly abraded Chalcolithic sherds, very little RW, and one Medieval Sgrafitto sherd, plus an unidentified sherd of later date. The RW sherds are primarily worn body sherds of both open and closed shapes, but there is also a rim sherd of a straight-sided flaring platter. In contrast to these loci, Loci 6, 19, and 28, also of Stratum 7, contained very few identifiable sherds. Locus 6 produced 11 sherds, all unidentifiable Early Prehistoric (EP) wares. Locus 19 was bisected by the gully and contained relatively few sherds, one- third of which were unidentifiable or later sherds. Locus 28 was made up mainly of unidentifiable EP wares of probably Middle Chalcolithic date. Only two strata, 8 and 9, were both in situ and not con- taminated by later ceramics. Out of a total of 12 sherds found in the matrix of the havara floor (Stratum 8: N355E565 L22), 9 are unidentifiable but dated to the Chalcolithic period. Two could be identified as RW open body sherds, one with a lattice decoration on its exterior surface and the other a rim sherd of an RMP holemouth ves- sel. None of these sherds sheds any light on the date of the construction of Building 1, although the RW and RMP sherds are stylistically identical to the pot- tery from Area 3 and, therefore, could be dated to early in the Middle Chalcolithic sequence. The pack- ing sealed between the floor and the bedrock (Stra- tum 9: N355E565 L23) contained 132 sherds, almost half of them RW sherds from open vessels. The re- mainder are unidentifiable Chalcolithic sherds from open vessels plus 5 RMP sherds. The fabric, finish, and decoration of the RW sherds is again consistent with those found in Area 3. Motifs consist mainly of multiple parallel lines and lattice patterns (6-8; fig. 22:5-7; PAS 94.7.74-75 + 77). Among the RW sherds are rims of small inward-curving bowls with</page><page sequence="21">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 43 1. PAS 94.7.55 2. PAS 94.7.52 + 53 3.

There are also holemouth vessels with linear design on the outer surface and a plain red interior surface (9; fig. 22:8; PAS 94.7.78). Vessels of similar shape have been found at Lemba Lakkous (Peltenburg 1985: figs. 57.4, 58.1). This stratum also included an incomplete RW pottery disc (10; fig. 22:4; PAS 94.7.68) and what appears to be an RW rim sherd that had been reworked into a curved, elongated implement ending in a tapered point (5; fig. 22:3; PAS 94.7.67). It seems odd that the percentage of worn Chalcolithic sherds in these two strata remained high, given that they are both pre- sumably uncontaminated. A possible explanation is that these sediments represent the debris discarded from various activities associated with the settlement and became abraded subsequently. At Lemba Lakk- ous and at Kissonerga Mosphilia, sherds were often used as packing in the walls of the structures (E. J. Peltenburg, personal communication 1995), and this may represent another possibility. There was no ev- idence of this, however, in the limited portion of the wall of Building 1 that was excavated. Analysis of the Building I Pottery There are 2,768 RW, RMP, and unidentified EP sherds from the contaminated deposits (Strata 1-3 and 5-7) associated with Building 1 (table 1). Open vessels comprise 15.8 percent (438) of the total, while only 2.4 percent (67) are from closed shapes. The majority of the RW and RMP sherds are im- possible to assign to either category; however, this</page><page sequence="22">44 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 1. PAS 94.7.66 2. PAS 93.7.313 4. PAS 94.7.68 3.

Profiles of the Middle Chalcolithic Red-on-White ware sherds and figurine fragments from Building 1 and Area 1 (1, 3-8 drawn and inked by M. Tsipopoulou; 2 drawn and inked by A. South). is not unexpected given the highly abraded nature of the ceramic assemblage. In the uncontaminated deposits (Strata 4, 8-9) 418 RW and RMP sherds were recovered. Of these 45.2 percent (189) are from open shapes and only 2.2 percent (9) are from closed shapes. The remainder are unassignable. The pottery from the sealed deposits associated with the structure, Strata 8 and 9, is of the same gen- eral type as the pottery from Area 3. Fabric 1 (Clarke in Rupp 1993) is the predominant fabric. Vessels are fine, small to medium-sized bowls, buckets, and hole mouths in both RW and RMP. Slips on RW sherds</page><page sequence="23">1999 PRASTIO--AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 45 are thin and hard, and the decorative motifs are lim- ited to thin multiple lines and the lattice motif. RW is the most common ware in all of the deposits apart from the ashy layer excavated as Loci 11 and 15, where the discovery of several RMP storage jars ac- counts for most of the recovered ceramics. The pres- ence of large RMP storage jars and a CW tray directly above the floor is unusual for Agios Savvas in that RW is by far the most common ware across the entire site apart from isolated pockets of RMP in Area 3. In addition, sherds from storage vessels are infrequent, and the fabric of these vessels from Build- ing 1 is of a type not seen before at Agios Savvas. Almost nothing can be deduced from the pottery concerning the spatial and chronological sequencing of the structure because so little of the floor survives. In general, the pottery suggests that the building be- longs to the same period as Area 3. However, there is nothing to suggest that it could not also belong to the same tradition as that of Area 1, if in fact the assemblages from Areas 1 and 3 come from different settlements, as has been hypothesized (see below, pp. 80-81). Furthermore, examples of RW similar to that found at Erimi Pamboula and Kissonerga Mosphilia 3b only occur in small quantities (i.e., 23% of the total in Area 1). What can be said is that the construction, the use, and the abandonment de- posits in Building 1 belong to one phase within the Chalcolithic period, and it is possible that this lies early in the Middle Chalcolithic sequence based on stylistic comparison with the pottery from the rest of the "site" and with other Middle Chalcolithic sites. Having said this, I must reiterate that there is no stratigraphic development at the site so we do not know whether the Agios Savvas pottery, and spe- cifically that found in association with Building 1, actually belongs to an earlier phase in the Middle Chalcolithic sequence, or whether the stylistically "early" fabric and finish of the pottery are due to technological and regional factors. Seriation with the Kissonerga Mosphilia ceramics is not reliable given the great range of the fabrics, tempers, and firing conditions found across the island in the EP period. Therefore, to make any categorical state- ments concerning the exact dating of the site with- out more complete stratigraphic evidence to back it up would be premature. Overview of Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 To the north of Building 1, in the lower part of Area 1, two trenches (N475E575 and N440E585) were excavated in the region of the erosional gully system. As in 1993 the pottery from the upper loci of N475E575 was mixed with high percentages of Medieval pottery (table 2), declining to predomi- nantly Chalcolithic pottery in the lower loci. Closer to the surface, the Chalcolithic sherds are very abraded and no specific ware types can be identified. In the lower loci, examples of RW and RMP are found but the proportion of recognizable wares is still very low. The loci of N440E585 represent the upper fill of an erosional gully. The trench is farther away and upslope from the monastery, and as a di- rect consequence it contained much smaller quanti- ties of Medieval sherds and much greater quantities of Chalcolithic sherds. All sherds are very abraded and there is a very low proportion of recognizable wares (table 2). No pottery was found in N415E600 in the midslope area to the east. The 1994 pottery from Area 1 differs only marginally from the 1993 season. There is one major inconsistency, however, which is that there is no evidence of the thick, chalky, white-slipped RW pottery in the tradition of Middle Chalcolithic Kissonerga Mosphilia 3b (Erimi type). This suggests that the distribution of this fab- ric type is uneven and could very well be attributed to a series of separate erosional episodes from a sin- gle settlement rather than from two different ones as has been tentatively postulated (Rupp and D'Anni- bale 1995: 34, 36, 38; see below, pp. 80-81). A notable find from N475E575 is a stylized head and neck/torso of an anthropomorphic ceramic figu- rine (11; fig. 22:1; PAS 94.7.66). The "face" of the figurine consists of a flattish, round disc with a ver- tical, luglike protrusion in the center of the disc (a nose?). The "face" measures 6 x 5 cm and is deco- rated with random splashes of paint. This type of figurine is well known from most Chalcolithic sites, including Erimi Pamboula where a number of similar examples have been recovered (Bolger 1988: pl. 13). While Bolger has divided the Erimi figurines stylis- tically into three groups (naturalistic, semi-abstract, and abstract), she deduced that no obvious chrono- logical division exists between the types (Bolger 1988: 104). The Agios Savvas head is extremely ab- stract with no natural rendering of the facial features or other anatomical details. Also like some Erimi ex- amples, there has been no attempt to make the RW decoration conform to the human form. In this context it should be noted that another terracotta figurine(?) fragment (12; fig. 22:2; PAS 93.7.313) was recovered from the flotation resi- due from N450E580 L12 excavated in 1993.

The surface deposits contained abraded Chalcolithic sherds mixed with Medieval material in roughly equal quantities. The lower loci, while containing more Chalcolithic sherds, still produced Medieval wares in significant amounts. The trenches excavated in Area 4, above Area 1, were almost devoid of any EP material.

There were six worn Chalcolithic sherds in N340E600 in the lower loci. Finally, trenches were excavated in Area 2. This area has to date turned up very few ceramics of any type, and Chalcolithic pottery is particularly scarce. In the uppermost portion of the contaminated sedi- ment layers, very worn Early Prehistoric wares are found in relative abundance. This pattern is charac- teristic of Agios Savvas where ubiquitous EP mate- rial is common in surface loci (table 5).

FOX) Multiple primary interments of discrete individu- als have been recorded at numerous sites for the Early Prehistoric in Cyprus. The fact that the human bones from the rock-cut feature in Area 4 (see above, p. 37) are commingled from secondary interment makes Agios Savvas unique to date among Chal- colithic and earlier sites on the island. Of the human bones that can be segregated by individual, the re- mains vary from a single fragmentary bone of one individual to the cranium, right femur, and ilia of an- other. In addition to the fact that the remains are largely incomplete, the preservation of the skeletal material ranges from fair to poor. As a result, the conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis are limited. Minimum Number of Individuals Based on the duplication of right femora, there are minimally three adults present (Individuals 1-3). At least four subadults can be identified as well, based on the duplication of three left mandibular teeth (Individuals 4-6). The presence of a newborn (Individual 7) is indicated by the fragmentary re- mains of an unsided tibia. Sex Among the three adults are a male (Individual 1) and two females (Individuals 2-3). The sex determi-</page><page sequence="29">1999 PRASTIO--AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 51 nation of the most complete individual (1) as male is based on cranial and pelvic morphologies as well as the robusticity of a femoral fragment. The sex deter- minations of Individuals 2 and 3 as female are based on gracile long bone morphologies. Sex determina- tions were not attempted on the subadults. Age at Death Individual 1 is estimated to be a 36+-year-old male based on ectocranial obliteration of the coronal suture (Angel et al. 1986). Individual 2 is estimated to be minimally a 26-year-old female based on endo- cranial obliteration of the coronal suture (Angel et al. 1986). The other female, Individual 3, can be aged no more precisely than "adult." Individual 4 is an infant, approximately 9-18 months based on dental devel- opment (Schour and Massler 1944). Individual 5 is another infant, 1-3 years of age based on dental de- velopment (Schour and Massler 1944). Individual 6 is approximately 2-4 years of age, also based on dental development (Schour and Massler 1944). The newborn, Individual 7, is estimated to be 0-6 months of age, based on the approximate length of a recon- structed tibia (Hinkes 1983). Dentition At least 37 teeth were recovered, the majority of which (21) are from Individual 1. The mandible of the adult male, 1, was recovered with 7 alveoli and 2 partial alveoli, the left molars (#17-#19), the left 2nd premolar (#20), a left 1st premolar (#21), a right double-rooted canine (#27), and the right 1st, 2nd, and 3rd molars (#30-#32). Individual l's maxillae were recovered with the following 12 teeth: the right molars and premolars (#1-#5), the left lateral incisor (#10), the left canine (#11), and the left premolars and molars (#12-#16). Alveoli are present for the other anterior dentition not recovered (#6-#9). The following dental anomalies are identified: a double- rooted mandibular right canine (#27); a lingual tu- bercle on the maxillary left lateral incisor (#10); and Carabelli's traits on the maxillary right and left 1st molars (#3 and #14). Individual 1 has the only dental paleopathology identified among these individuals: a carious buccal (facial) pit of the mandibular right 2nd molar (#31). Dental wear of the mandibular dentition when scored utilizing the Scott system (1979) gives the following scores: #19: Scott 16; #18: Scott 14; #17: Scott 14; #30: Scott 17; #31: Scott 13; #32: Scott 13. When applied to the maxillary dentition the scores are as follows: #1: Scott 14; #2: Scott 14; #3: Scott 18; #14: Scott 19; #15: Scott 14; #16: Scott 14. The only other tooth associated with an adult is a loose maxillary incisor with exposed dentin and postmor- tem root fracture. This tooth cannot be associated with a specific adult. The remaining dentition includes 16 teeth from the older subadults. The following 7 loose teeth pos- sibly are all from Individual 4: a deciduous maxillary left central incisor; the unerupted deciduous maxil- lary left 2nd molar crown with Carabelli's trait; the unerupted deciduous mandibular right 2nd molar; the unerupted crowns of the mandibular right and left 1st molars (#19 and #30); the unerupted maxillary left 1st molar crown (#14); and a partial crown and root fragment that possibly is a deciduous maxillary 1st molar. The mandible from Individual 5 contains the deciduous left 1st molar and canine, 2 deciduous in- cisors, and the unerupted left posterior dentition. The mandible from Individual 6 contains the deciduous left 1st and 2nd molars, the loose unerupted left 1st molar crown (#19), and the loose fragmentary de- ciduous mandibular right 2nd molar. In addition, a loose unerupted maxillary central incisor crown may be from this individual as well. No teeth are assign- able to Individual 7. Skeletal Anomalies and Palaeopathologies Aside from the nonmetric dental trait anomalies mentioned above which tend to be highly heritable, the only skeletal anomaly identified is a septal aper- ture of a distal humerus. As this trait is more fre- quently found among females than males, it probably is associated with Individual 2 or 3. In addition to the dental palaeopathology seen in Individual 1 (buccal caries of #31), we identified an exostosis of the an- terior greater trochanter of a fragment of an uni- dentified adult left femur which extends inferiorly. The etiology of this palaeopathology is unknown. Conclusion Little can be surmised from these human bones owing to the small sample size, incompleteness, and the state of preservation. One area for future inves- tigation is the prevalence among other Cypriot skel- etal series of the nonmetric traits identified at Agios Savvas.</page><page sequence="30">52 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 THE CHIPPED STONE INDUSTRY (CESARE D'ANNIBALE) Research has demonstrated that the Chalcolithic chipped stone industry in Cyprus, with the possible exception of that at Erimi Pamboula (Seton-Wil- liams 1936), is predominantly flake-based (Betts 1979, 1985, 1987; Hordynsky and Ritt 1978). This represents a drastic departure from the previous blade-oriented industry of the Neolithic period. Re- sults of the investigations at Agios Savvas confirm this general shift in technology. The chipped stone assemblage at Agios Savvas,21 however, presents a number of anomalies in relation to its coastal relatives. Indeed, it raises questions about the supposedly lim- ited scope of the Chalcolithic chipped stone industry. This contribution discusses the characteristics of the site's general assemblage from mixed archaeological contexts in relation to the in situ deposits. Analysis of coastal site assemblages suggests that the flake orientation of the industry is directly in- fluenced by the lack of good quality local raw material (Betts 1985: 278; 1987: 11-12). It would also seem that chert acquisition did not figure prominently in exchange networks. High-quality cherts never reached the institutionalized prestige commodity status at- tained by other lithic materials such as picrolite or obsidian. General consensus equates sedentary prehis- toric populations with expedient or informal chipped stone technology based on opportunistic local chert exploitation. The major difference between Agios Savvas and its coastal counterparts is the abundance of chert. The Agios Savvas site produced over 12,000 chipped stone artifacts weighing more than 80 kg. Of these, nearly 90 percent are Lefkara chert varieties. The closest modern bedded Lefkara chert source is ap- proximately 10 km away (S. T. Stewart 1992). Al- though Moni chert is the closest good quality chert source, approximately 7 km away (S. T. Stewart 1992), it accounts for only 9 percent of the assem- blage. The abundance of Lefkara chert raises the questions of whether the site was simply fortuitously located near a hitherto unknown high-grade chert source or whether selective chert raw material acqui- sition was being exercised. All of the formal Chalcolithic tool types are present and, in most cases, in consistently higher frequencies than at contemporaneous coastal sites. The recovery of 240 scrapers at Agios Savvas com- pares well with the total from Lemba Lakkous (Betts 1987: 14) and is far greater than that of Kissonerga Mosphilia (Betts 1985: 278) and Kissonerga Mylouth- kia (Betts 1979). The frequency of notched tools, 617 examples, and borer-type tools, 485 examples, is overwhelmingly greater than at all coastal sites. In addition, 4,837 unretouched but utilized flakes and blade forms are unparalleled in terms of frequency (figs. 23:5, 24:1-3, 6). Two main types of utilized flakes have been iden- tified (D'Annibale 1993: 400)-Type 1, a rectangular flake (figs. 23:3, 24:6) and Type 2, a laterally faceted flake (fig. 23:6), both of which have a broad striking platform. These broad flakes exhibit standardized forms, reflecting a patterned flake production based on core preparation. In general terms, aside from the numbers and greater size, these tool forms do not deviate from the characteristic Chalcolithic chipped stone industry as represented on coastal sites. The inordinate number of blade-derived tool forms, however, distinguishes the Agios Savvas as- semblage from those of the Lemba cluster of sites. Raw material availability may account for the mark- edly different chipped stone industry at Agios Sav- vas. Blade technology still plays a dominant role in this site's industry. Blades, however, are typically smaller and wider than their Neolithic counterparts (figs. 23:1-2, 5; 24:1-3). It would appear that, al- though a large number were recovered whole (167 examples), the primary aim was to modify them by truncation or snapping to produce a number of us- able segments. Over 1,000 such blade segments have been identified (fig. 23:5). Another distinctive feature of the blade technology at Agios Savvas is the pres- ence of 463 crested blade flakes (figs. 23:4, 24:5). Bladelet production also played a major role as evi- denced by 397 examples (fig. 24:4). The Agios Savvas assemblage is also character- ized by knapping techniques that differ from the gen- eral Chalcolithic repertoire. Aside from edge retouch, two techniques were frequently employed to further reduce blades and flakes. First, the burin technique was used to remove lateral edges to back an imple- ment, facilitating hand or finger placement. This is a somewhat unorthodox application of the technique; it is normally associated with the production of an engraving point. Second, ventral trimming was used to create hafting ends or finger holds (fig. 23:3). On some items the ventral trimming was so extensive that the ventral face was completely removed. With the identification of a freshwater pond at Agios Savvas in 1994, evidence for peripheral site</page><page sequence="31">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 53 1 2 3 0 5cm 4 5 - , 6I , ,! 4 5 6 ._Zzz7 Fig. 23.

Remains from chipped stone activity are more likely to stay intact and undisturbed in outlying areas of a settlement than in and around the structural compounds (Rupp and D'Annibale 1995). Chipped stone reduction sequen- ces in high-use areas are easily dispersed during the settlement's occupation. One such example of an undisturbed reduction activity area located outside the structural component of the settlement was iden- tified in Area 3 (D'Annibale 1993: 404-5). Testing of the pond area revealed similar intact chipped stone discard/reduction patterns. A total of 132 chipped stone artifacts were recovered from the in situ strata corresponding to the pond sediments. Compared with the abundance of chipped stone found in colluvial fans and gullies covering the site, this is a relatively small sample. These offer a glimpse, how- ever, of what may be the only undisturbed and best represented assemblage on site (fig. 23). Material disposed into the pond, intentionally or not, would remain buried within the sediments with little move- ment. As the pond dried up, the deposit was effec- tively sealed. The best evidence for an actual lithic reduction locus is found in N500E485. Here, 33 chert artifacts were recovered from the pond sediment. What distinguishes this assemblage are two distinct concentrations of Lefkara Basal Green and Lefkara</page><page sequence="32">54 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 1 2 3 0 i I 5cm 4 5A Fig. 24.

Translucent Red, Tawny, and Brown chert types. The majority of the Translucent chert may originate from the same cobble since all three chert varieties can be found grading into one another on several pieces. What make this assemblage even more distinctive is the noticeable absence of the other two Lefkara Basal varieties, which are ubiquitous on site. The Lefkara Basal Green variety is represented by 14 items, most of which can be classified as waste material. None of these shows any sign of use. However, three pieces are retouched: a notch element found on a snapped blade segment; a tip scraper fashioned on a Type 1 flake; and a scraping edge created on a Type 2 flake (fig. 23:6). The Lefkara Translucent chert assem- blage provides perhaps the two finest chipped stone tools recovered from Agios Savvas. They are a sickle blade backed by retouch and a drill, both of which are manufactured on Lefkara Translucent Brown (fig. 23:1-2). The sickle blade is produced on a snapped blade segment. Fine retouch, use, and sheen are lo- cated on the left lateral dorsal edge. The right lateral dorsal edge, dorsal distal, and proximal edges are re- touched to back the piece. Another backed sickle blade was found in a disturbed pond context, also manufactured on the same chert type. The drill is on a crested blade and is bifacially retouched. The distal point has been dealt a burin blow to create a trans- verse truncation. Retouch, both on the ventral and dorsal faces, was then employed to further reduce the drill point. Extensive ventral retouching or trimming,</page><page sequence="33">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 55 as well as some dorsal retouch, was applied on the proximal end to thin the area, probably to facilitate hafting. The occurrence of bifacially reduced tools in Chalcolithic assemblages, and in Neolithic contexts as well, is rare in the Cypriot chipped stone industry. With the exception of the casual appearance of drills, some scrapers, and the odd erratic item such as the possible points from Lemba Lakkous (Betts 1987: 13), there have been few documented artifacts. Despite this general absence, a variant of this technique ap- pears frequently in the Agios Savvas assemblage. It involves the secondary trimming of a tool blank, ex- clusively concentrated on the ventral face (fig. 23:3). The intention was to create a hafting end or to facil- itate finger placement. A similar practice, employed primarily on blade forms, can be seen at the Ceramic Neolithic site of Sotira Teppes (Stekelis 1961: pls. 116:637a; 117:221a, 471a, 455g) and recently at the Aceramic Neolithic site of Kholetria Ortos (Simmons 1994: 5). At Agios Savvas this technique was re- stricted primarily to flakes. The chipped stone recovered from the partial re- mains of Building 1 at Agios Savvas proved to be less than adequate for statistical comparison with the overall site assemblage (Rupp and D'Annibale 1995). The in situ material found on the floor and subfloor deposit totaled 77 artifacts. The majority of these consist of debitage, mostly angular blocky fragments and broken flakes, probably resulting from occupa- tion trampling. Heat-altered and cracked chert is also characteristic of the sample. No formal tools were recovered, only utilized flakes. The in situ stratum outside the building yielded similar disposal patterns; however, tools are better represented (fig. 24). This is probably a reflection of the varied and specialized activities performed around the structure's compound. Flake and blade blanks are not as common here as in the pond area. Spatially segregated activity patterns are reflected by these two areas: blank production and tool manufacture were taking place on the fringes of the settlement, and tool utilization in the habita- tion area. The chipped stone industry at Ayios Savvas seems to have been vibrant and flourishing. Chert availabil- ity may account for the anomalous features of the industry at the site. This situation could have led to enhanced productivity and craftsmanship, and subse- quently to inherent craft specialization for the region. Lithic technological organization suggests that a func- tional differentiation and specialization can be pos- tulated for the chipped stone industry at Agios Savvas and perhaps for the region. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE GROUND/PECKED STONE AND PICROLITE INDUSTRIES FROM THE 1994 FIELD SEASON (JOHN CRITCHLEY) In the course of the 1994-1995 season at Agios Savvas, 102 ground/pecked stone and 9 picrolite ar- tifacts were recovered. Of these only 44 (39.6%) came from excavated contexts; the remaining 67 (60.4%) were surface finds from Areas 1-3 and 5 (tables 6-7). Picrolite Artifacts Nine picrolite objects were recovered. The trenches in Area 1 produced two unworked pebble fragments and one flake. Two pebble fragments were also dis- covered on the surface. One of these (fig. 25.1; PAS 94.6.43), of unknown purpose or function, appears to have been ground and pecked into an ovoid shape. Weighing 182 g, it is the largest picrolite object found at the site. An unworked pebble came from the sur- face of Area 2. In N500E485 in Area 3 another flake was recovered. While neither of these objects shows signs of alteration, the flakes could represent the product of a reduction stage in the manufacture of picrolite artifacts. An unidentified worked picrolite object recovered in 1992 from the surface of Area 3 by P. Croft and previously stored with the 1991 systematic collection materials was cataloged (fig. 26:1; PAS 94.6.119). This fragmentary object (4.5 x 3.0 x 9.0 cm, 14 g) is roughly triangular in shape with a section similar to that of a very thin axe. It is ground to a smooth finish on both its ventral and dorsal faces, although there are some striations on these surfaces remaining from the process of grinding it into shape. It is impossible to speculate on the appearance of the entire unique object because of its fragmentary state. A picrolite cruciform figurine pendant (fig. 26:2; PAS 94.6.1) was recovered from the fill of the os- suary discovered in N320E600 in Area 4 (see above, p. 37). It appears to have been part of a necklace made up of Dentalium shells given as a burial offer- ing. This figurine (6.3 x 3.3 x 0.4 cm, 2 g) has no</page><page sequence="34">56 RUPP ET AL.

A small hole was pierced through the facial area to facilitate attachment to the string once form- ing the necklace. As the hole shows no signs of wear, it suggests that the pendant was not worn frequently. Further, the figurine appears not to have been fin- ished when it was deposited in the ossuary as its sur- face displays numerous scratches from grinding and there is no sign of polishing. When analyzing the 9 picrolite objects from the 1994-1995 field season and the 33 from the 1993 field season (Critchley in Rupp et al. 1994: 324), a pattern emerges. The unaltered and the semi-worked pebbles, the flakes, as well as the unfinished cruci- form figurine reinforce the assertion that picrolite objects were manufactured at the Early Prehistoric "settlements" around Agios Savvas rather than hav- ing been brought there as exchanged finished ob- jects. This supports Peltenburg's suggestion that "the</page><page sequence="35">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 57 TABLE 7.

Ground/Pecked Stone Artifacts Area 1 produced 81 ground/pecked stone artifacts or 79.4 percent of all such artifacts found in the four areas that comprise the site. Of these, 48 were re- covered from the surface with the remainder, 33, from excavated contexts. While the majority of the artifacts came from erosional deposits, Building 1 produced only a few artifacts in situ in the deposit resting on the plastered havara floor surface. In this deposit were a hammerstone (fig. 25:2; PAS 94.6.221) and a crudely made multipurpose tool (rubber/pestle/ chisel?) (fig. 25:3; PAS 94.6.26). In addition, a col- lection of 7 small spherical pebbles (fig. 25:4; PAS 94.6.25) were found in a cluster resting on or imme- diately above the floor. As these pebbles (on aver- age 3.6 cm in diameter and weighing between 52 and 82 g) show no signs of having been physically al- tered, their purpose or function is unknown. There also was a thin, rectangular piece of limestone (fig. 26:3; PAS 94.6.28) with a series of incised lines on its ventral and dorsal surfaces forming a checker- board pattern. Its function is unknown but it ap- pears to be most similar in terms of decoration to the incised circular cobbles found on Aceramic Neo- lithic sites such as Khirokitia Vouni and Kholetria Ortos (Fox 1987: 23; Simmons 1994: 9, fig. 3). From the stratum overlying bedrock that formed the floor's packing/foundation, one polisher/pecking stone (fig. 25:5; PAS 94.6.29) was recovered. Because the ex- cavated portion of Building 1 is so small, it is impos- sible to draw any conclusions concerning the ground/ pecked stone assemblage associated with it. The backhoe trenches in Area 2 produced only three ground/pecked stone artifacts: two grinders</page><page sequence="36">58 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 ,.~~, ,,so,?., i .60. .?. sis~ ~ 5. AS 4.6292.

Picrolite objects (1 drawn by J. Ravenhurst and inked by R. Granda; 2-3 drawn and inked by M. Tsipopoulou). and a fragment of a marble or alabaster pendant (fig. 26:4; PAS 94.6.9). The latter is likely from the post- Bronze Age period. The near absence of Chalcolithic ground/pecked stone artifacts from this area sug- gests that the deep erosional deposits which fill this natural basin did not come primarily from the sedi- ments that deflated from the Early Prehistoric "set- tlements" farther upslope. In Area 3 only three ground/pecked artifacts were excavated in the pond sediments in the southern half of N500E485. Unfortunately, this provides no information for dating the possible wall (see above, p. 28) at the northern end of the trench. Two artifacts were also picked up on the surface of this vineyard. In the ossuary in Area 4, along with the picrolite cruciform figurine pendant (see above, pp. 55-56) a fragmentary limestone bowl (fig. 25:6; PAS 94.6.2) was recovered. The shallow bowl appears to have been oval in shape with a thick rim. It seems to have been broken prior to deposition within the ossuary. Whether this represents an intentional burial gift or was deposited afterwards by erosional processes one cannot tell. No other ground/pecked stone artifacts were recovered in Area 4. Preliminary Conclusions In advance of the final analyses and synthetic discussion of the ground/pecked stone artifact as- semblages at Agios Savvas, one can make some pre- liminary observations. The majority of the ground/ pecked stone tools recovered are fragmentary in na- ture, having been damaged or broken through use or historic landuse and cultivation practices. This makes it difficult to identify them and to compare them with material from other sites. There appear to be no major differences in artifact types between Areas 1 and 3. Area 1, however, does display a greater density of tools and range of tool types. The assemblage consists of a wide range of types, many of them multifunctional. This demonstrates that a wide range of activities was carried out at</page><page sequence="38">60 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 the settlement(s) including tree cutting, wood work- ing, tool and ornament manufacturing, and subsis- tence pursuits such as food processing. In some instances, broken tools appear to have been reused. In addition, while some of the tools-particularly the axes, chisels, pestles, querns, and bowls, as well as some of the hammerstones and grinders-have been shaped deliberately into the more traditional forms seen at the larger coastal settlements, a number of them seem to have been chosen in the unworked state for their natural shapes and used without any or only minimal alteration. Thus, it would appear that for tools whose function required a very specific shape or physical property (e.g., axes) or the ability to with- stand constant, heavy use (e.g., mortars and pes- tles), time was taken to peck and grind them into the desired forms and shapes. For rougher and perhaps more expedient work, however, unaltered or mini- mally altered stones which had natural forms similar to the shape required were used. Thus, the ground/ pecked stone industry at Agios Savvas shares simi- larities with other Chalcolithic settlements. The abil- ity of the inhabitants to manufacture fine tools as well as to create rougher tools of convenience and the value placed on the former as shown by their reuse and multifunctions echo similar observations made by C. Elliott (1985: 275) in regard to the in- dustry at Lemba Lakkous. The picrolite object assemblage suggests the local manufacture of ornaments and other objects. While the picrolite used at Agios Savvas most likely came from the Kouris riverbed, it is not clear whether the unworked picrolite pebbles and cobbles were acquired directly from the riverbed or through "down-the-line" exchange with neighboring groups (Hancock and Fox 1992: 9-10). The picrolite assemblage does support, however, a view that the settlements at Agios Savvas were not isolated subsistence agriculture communi- ties but, rather, had contact with other settlements in the region. BRONZE AGE POTTERY (ELLEN HERSCHER) A number of sherds were recovered during the excavations at Ayios Savvas that were tentatively identified as dating to the Bronze Age. Some of these sherds eluded firm identification even after further study, but the majority provide significant evidence for Bronze Age occupation in the area.22 Catalog Red Polished (RP) ware 1.

Discussion Settlement in the initial phase of the Late Cypriot Bronze Age (LC IA) is most strongly suggested by this material. The Red Polished IV ware is closely similar to that from the LC IA settlement (Area A) at Episkopi Phaneromeni (fig. 1), where it is also found in association with Drab Polished and Proto White Slip wares (Herscher 1981: 81; Carpenter 1981: 64-65). The single certain example of Proto Base Ring (PBR) ware (17) supports this date as well. Cat. no. 16, classified here as Drab Polished ware, could possibly be considered PBR as well. The abundance of Drab Polished ware confirms the apparent predominance of this ware in western Cyprus during the Bronze Age (Herscher and Fox 1993). Most of the Agios Savvas sherds examined display the distinctive unoxidized "blue core" known from other sites in the south and southwest (Herscher 1976: 11; G. Philip in Peltenburg 1983: 48-49). One sherd (12) is decorated with the impressed circles typical of the west (Karageorghis 1976: 862, figs. 43-44; Karageorghis 1973: 606, fig. 8). The general condition of the sherds, as well as the presence of sherds from large storage vessels (8, 14; cf. Carpen- ter 1981: fig. 3:18), suggest that they originate from a settlement rather than a cemetery. Use wear is clearly visible on several of the sherds. When considered in conjunction with the finds from Mesoyi Katarraktis (Herscher and Fox 1993) and Kissonerga Skalia (Peltenburg 1983: 46-51) (fig. 2), this group of sherds from Agios Savvas (2- 18) provides additional support to the hypothesis that, at the end of the Middle Cypriot period, west- ern Cyprus was beginning to increase in importance and emerge from a period of isolation.23 It is uncertain whether the WS II material from Agios Savvas (19-22)24 should be considered as evi- dence for continuous occupation of the area into the later part of the Late Bronze Age or whether it rep- resents a distinct episode. Because of the limited range of shapes and LC II fabrics represented, it is perhaps most likely that these finds may come from a tomb in the area.25 The WS II handle (19) displays an unusual style of decoration characteristic of "WS IIA," as defined by M. Popham (in Astr6m 1972: 446, fig. 51), a style typical of southwestern Cyprus, especially Kouklia. Body sherds with narrow hatched bands (such as 21-22) are also typical of this style. Several other sherds initially thought by the WCP to be of possible Bronze Age date did not prove to be- long to this period upon closer examination. Rather, they may be assigned to a late phase of the Chal- colithic period, representing wares similar to those known from Kissonerga Mosphilia 4 and Lemba Lakkous Period 3 (Peltenburg 1983: 24-28; J. D. Stewart 1978). While they are not, therefore, the fo- cus of the present study, they are deserving of men- tion. The Black-topped bowl sherd (1) could date to the Late Chalcolithic period as well: its size and con- dition are inadequate for more precise assessment.26 Possible Late Chalcolithic ware 23.

GREGORY) Introduction The Medieval to Modemrn pottery from the exca- vation at Agios Savvas fits the standard assemblage of wares already known from elsewhere in Cyprus during these periods. The absence of some well- documented wares is, however, worth noting and presumably relates to the history of the site. Thus, it</page><page sequence="41">1999 PRASTIO--AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 63 is not surprising that we do not find pottery of the so-called Byzantine Dark Age, from the 7th to the 10th centuries C.E., during which Cyprus was appar- ently a "condominium" under the joint authority of Arabs and Byzantines. It is, however, significant that no imported Byzantine wares of the 10th through the 12th centuries C.E. have been identified from the excavation material and that the standard wares of the 13th-14th centuries C.E., well known through excavations as well as survey elsewhere, are rela- tively poorly represented at Agios Savvas. The Me- dieval ceramic material becomes much more common in the 15th and especially the 16th centuries C.E., when the site witnessed a high point of activity, some- thing certainly associated with the development of the monastery. Particularly notable in the ceramic assemblage are the Cypriot pottery of the 16th cen- tury C.E., found in a variety of shapes and decorations, and the Maiolica ware imported from Italy. This latter pottery is seen especially in its rather early phases (16th century C.E.), rather than the fully developed forms of the 17th century C.E. and later, and it is well paralleled with examples found earlier in the century in Nicosia. This late Medieval activity apparently continued into the Early Modern periods, although perhaps on a reduced scale, and much of the pottery discovered dates from the Modern period. One should note again that the site of Agios Sav- vas has been heavily eroded and that even most of the Medieval-Modern pottery has been found in sec- ondary positions and in very fragmentary condition. The ramifications of this for the distribution of the pottery will be discussed below, but this had an im- portant effect on the condition of the pottery pieces and the relative lack of fully stratified or whole pieces. Catalog Glazed Wares 1. Plain Glazed Ware Plain Glazed ware is a general category used for vessels, usually jugs and bowls, that are decorated only with a vitreous glaze, either directly on the clay or over a white slip (Morgan 1942: 58-63). The glaze is commonly green or yellow, although many other colors are possible. The ubiquity and lack of distinctive characteristics among most of the exam- ples of these wares make them difficult to date. Pre- sumably, most of the examples cited here are late Medieval to Modern. 1. Plain Glazed bowl (fig. 28:1; PAS 94.7.38; Area 1: N475E575 L2).

Glaze-Painted Wares These wares are represented primarily by bowls whose interiors are covered by a white slip and a single-colored light glaze, with decorations painted in various contrasting, usually darker glaze (cf. Mor- gan 1942: 141-45, "Painted Sgraffito Wares"). The primary color of the glaze is yellow or green, with added color in brown or dark green. This tech- nique is widespread throughout the eastern Mediter- ranean, but most of the examples here were probably made in Cyprus between the 13th and 18th centuries C.E. Some of the bowls resemble those of Group IX from Polis, dating to the 16th-18th centuries C.E. (Dikigoropoulos and Megaw 1940-1948). 7.

Small spots of green glaze on interior. Lapithos ware, 19th-20th centuries C.E. 3. Slip-Painted Wares This common ware is characterized by a design painted in white slip directly on the fabric of the ves- sel (Morgan 1942: 95-103; Taylor and Megaw 1937- 1939; 4, Group II; Dikigoropoulos and Megaw 1940-1948: 80-81, Group IIA). The surface is then covered by a yellow or (less commonly) green or purple glaze which fires dark over the unslipped clay but much lighter over the slip. The most common designs are circles, spirals, dots, and geometric fig- ures. The ware is found in a variety of shapes, in- cluding both open and closed examples, and it seems to have been manufactured widely, both in and out of Cyprus, from the 12th century C.E. onward. They are particularly common in so-called Lemba ware from the 13th-14th centuries C.E., and in Lapithos ware from the 18th-20th centuries C.E. The bulk of the material in this category found at Ayios Savvas is, however, in the later category. 9. Slip-Painted bowl (fig. 28:9; PAS 93.7.293; Area 1: N455E575 L2).

BASOR 316 medium, light and dark and small gold sparkling inclusions, perhaps not Cypriot. Self-slip on exterior; on interior, yellow glaze and uncertain slip-painted design. Date also uncertain: may be Medieval, but just as likely to be Early Modern. May be Lapithos ware; if so, probably 16th-18th century C.E. 4. Sgraffito Wares Sgraffito wares utilize a red clay covered with a white slip, into which designs are scratched using a sharp instrument, over which light glaze is then ap- plied (Morgan 1942: 115-66; Taylor and Megaw 1937-1939: Groups I, III-VIII, X; Dikigoropoulos and Megaw 1940-1948: some groups subdivided further). After firing, the glaze over the lines and incisions is dark, while over the slip it remains light- colored. Sgraffito technique seems to have originated in the Near East, but it became one of the major types of Byzantine pottery in the Aegean area, and this was imitated both in the Levant and in Italy. In Cyprus small sgraffito bowls became the dominant type of fine ware production by the 13th century C.E. These bowls, which were decorated also in slip- painted technique, characteristically had relatively high ring feet and carinated sides; the sgraffito de- signs were often emphasized by the application of a darker glaze (making the technique resemble glaze- painted wares). The divisions suggested by Megaw and colleagues are based largely on the application of different colors. Interestingly, none of the sgraf- fito wares discovered in the excavation appear to have been imported from the Aegean area (cf. Greg- ory 1993: 162-63). a. Zeuxippos Ware This is a sgraffito ware characterized by a very hard, shiny glaze, usually yellow, and bright reddish- orange clay (Megaw 1968; 1971: nos. 13-14). It is to be dated primarily to the early years of the 13th century C.E., although its manufacture appears to have continued until nearly 1300 C.E. 12.

Possibly an Italian import. c. Cypriot Sgraffito Wares These represent the most common fine wares en- countered in the excavation. They are mostly char- acterized by the carinated bowls mentioned above, and they can be divided into at least three cate- gories: Lemba ware (13th-14th centuries c.E.; see Papanikola-Bakirtzis 1988); Lapithos ware (Byzan- tine period 15th-16th centuries C.E.); and possibly Enkomi ware (15th-16th centuries C.E.; see Papani- kola-Bakirtzis 1989). 16.

The pottery was widely made throughout Italy, especially in the center and north, and it was broadly exported, including to the Eastern Mediterranean. The clay was covered with an opaque white or tinted lead glaze with an added tint to make the glaze opaque, and designs were then painted on the surface in contrasting colors. The technique of using a glaze with added tint came to Italy ca. 1200 c.E. from the Islamic world, and the name "maiolica" came from the island of Majorca through which many of the Hispano-Moorish wares entered the peninsula (Wilson 1989: 78). Maiolica wares have been widely reported in Cyprus, although no special study has been devoted to them (Megaw 1937-1939). 29. Maiolica bowl (fig. 29:6; PAS 93.7.264; Area 1: N490E575 L2).

Most of these were presumably locally made, although some of the cook- ing pots are similar to others found elsewhere in the Mediterranean and so may have been imported. The fabric of almost all of these wares is a brown clay that fires a red or reddish-brown, remarkably similar to the Kornos pottery still being produced today; many of the shapes, too, are very much like that of tradi- tional pottery made for local use well into the present century. Inclusions include a shiny black stone and pieces of quartz. Among the vessels in this category are examples that were partially covered with a yel- low glaze, making them like so-called Brown Glazed wares (Morgan 1942: 36-41; in general, cf.

Evidence from these pieces shows that they were attached on the roof with mortar, with remarkably little overlap on the upper end of the tiles. 54.

Cut edges along long sides; thick at broken end and thinner at finished end. Mortar on the concave side with heavier concentration at the thin, finished end; mortar also present on thin end on the convex side. The location of the mortar shows that the thin end of the tile was placed upward on the roof with the thicker end placed downward. 56.

Very coarse red clay (2.5 YR 5/8) with many medium to large, dark and light inclusions, unevenly fired black and red on convex surface. There is no good evidence of tiles being laid as pans. Description similar to 55, but this tile is thicker at broken end. Mortar on concave side and thin 2/3 of convex side. This includes a large blob of mortar about 0.02 m high that must have been thrown up against the front of the tile above it; the surface of the mortar seems to have been colored (perhaps with ground tiles) so that it is the same color as the tiles. Thus, only the upper 0.05 m of the tile was covered by the tile above it, showing that there was little overlap in placement of tiles on the roof, resulting in considerable economy of materials. Numbers and Distribution Beyond the discussion of the various wares and individual pieces, some broader observations may be made about the amount and distribution of Medieval- Modern pottery recovered from the excavations at Agios Savvas. These observations are naturally based only on the pottery actually brought back from the field, and one cannot expect high levels of precision or conclusions with far-reaching ramifications. In ad- dition, at the time of a preliminary examination, the pottery for some of the trenches was sorted and pieces tentatively described as "Medieval and unknown wares" were separated and discarded. This was done only in a few areas, however, and checks with pottery that were given a preliminary reading and that sur- vived until they could be read fully suggests that most of the discarded pieces probably were not Medieval or later. Thus, with the caveat in mind that not all the pottery originally found could be part of this analysis, it still seems desirable to seek information that goes beyond the mere descriptive or simply chronological. Because of the way the pottery was collected and studied, it is not possible (nor probably even desir- able) to compare gross counts of pottery of different dates. Weights were not taken, and it has not been possible to compare numbers of sherds identified as Medieval-Modern with those identified from other periods. Thus, the level of analysis cannot be that of the individual piece, but rather that of the trench and, within that the excavational unit (locus) or in some cases the broad stratigraphic layers that have been identified at the site by the excavators and consid- ered in the discussion of the prehistoric pottery in this article. In addition, we assume the normal strati- graphic principle that the locus can be dated by the latest material in it. With this in mind, and considering only the loci for which pottery survived for analysis, we can make the following observations: % of Number whole Total number of loci excavated at PAS 363 Loci dated as Medieval 69 19.0 Loci dated as Early Modern 5 1.4 Loci dated as Modern 38 10.5 Loci dated as Medieval to Modern 10 2.8 Loci dated as Early Modern to Modem 6 1.7 Total Medieval-Modern loci 128 35.4 Probably most notable here is the observation that over a third of all loci are dated to the Medieval- Modern period. This is even more striking when one considers that 66 loci, or 18.2 percent of the total,</page><page sequence="52">74 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 could not be assigned to a particular period and these are included in the total for the "whole" listed above. If one were to exclude these 66 loci from consider- ation, the Medieval-Modern loci would make up 43.2 percent of all the datable loci. One reason for this, of course, is that all surface loci would be ex- pected to date to the Modem period since many if not all of them will have contained Modem ceram- ics. Rather interesting by comparison is the rela- tively low number of Early Modern loci and the high number of those assigned to the Medieval period. Perhaps the low number of Early Modern loci may be partially offset by the number of loci which could not be precisely assigned to one of the periods but which roughly fell into the period Medieval to Mod- ern (10) or Early Modern to Modem (6). If a substan- tial number of these loci should, in fact, be assigned to the Early Modern period, the chronological spread would be considerably evened out. On the other hand, it is clear that a significant number of loci should be securely assigned to the Medieval period. These in fact numbered more than the loci assigned to all the other periods combined. The broad spatial distribution of Medieval-Mod- ern pottery in the excavation area by trenches is shown in fig. 33.29 This indicates that the spatial dis- tribution of the Medieval-Modem pottery is remark- ably widespread over the whole of the excavated area: the distribution of trenches with later pottery strongly resembles a plan showing the spatial distri- bution of the excavated trenches, with particularly heavy concentrations in Areas 1 and 3. One notable exception, however, is the upper (southern) part of Area 1 and all of Area 4, where virtually no later pottery was found. This is not surprising, given the location of known later architectural activity (around the monastery in the northern part of the site) and the likelihood that any later pottery would have been high up in the stratigraphy and would have been washed down into the lower part of the site as a result of the erosional activity that is otherwise well documented. Figs. 34-36 show the same information, broken down by individual periods: Medieval, Early Mod- ern, and Modern.30 Noteworthy is the relative pau- city of trenches with loci dated to the Early Modern period, an observation made above that is surprising given the known activity at the monastery in this age. The distribution of Modern material is rather wide- spread and undifferentiated, while the Medieval pot- tery is concentrated especially in Area 3 to the west of the monastery and in the very northern part of E700 N600 N250 MEDIEVAL, EARLY MODERN, MODERN Fig. 33. Spatial distribution of Medieval-Modern sherds by trench (created by T. E. Gregory). Area 1 close to the monastery wall. We can also note that the latest pottery identified on the surface in Ar- eas 3 and 5 was Medieval in date (13th-14th centu- ries C.E.), while the latest pottery in the backhoe trench in Area 2 was from the Early-Modern period. The information in these figures may be somewhat misleading in that it reflects the spatial distribution of Medieval-Modern pottery trench by trench, with- out any consideration of the quantity of that material. Thus, a trench would receive the same dot whether one or several hundred pieces were found in it. No systematic sampling of the ceramic material was carried out at the time of excavation, and the earlier pottery had already been removed from the material by the time study was carried out on the Medieval- Modern wares. Therefore, no significant statistical examination can be carried out at this point. Nonethe- less, since the excavated trenches were all of roughly similar size (surface extent), it is possible to provide a very rough estimate of the intensity of activity, pe- riod by period, by comparing the number of loci with pottery of a certain age in each trench. The results of such an inquiry are shown in figs. 37-39, where the size of the dot is an indication of the number</page><page sequence="53">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 75 E700 N600 So E450 N250 MEDIEVAL Fig. 34. Spatial distribution of Medieval sherds by trench (created by T. E. Gregory). of loci with pottery of each of the three periods: Me- dieval, Early Modem, and Modem. Fig. 37 is perhaps most revealing: it shows that many of the trenches with Medieval pottery contained multiple units of Medieval date, suggesting incidentally that some of this Medieval material was probably in situ and not washed down from some other area. Particularly in- teresting is the group of trenches south of the mon- astery, in the northern part of Area 1, where all of the trenches contained more than five Medieval loci and where the trench closest to the monastery wall re- vealed the largest number of Medieval loci in the entire excavation. Fig. 37 should be contrasted with fig. 39 which shows the number of Modern loci trench by trench. Of the 25 trenches with Modern pottery, 14 or 56 percent had only one loci Modern in date; the com- parable figures for the 25 Medieval trenches were 7 or 28 percent.

Of perhaps greater interest is a preliminary anal- ysis of the Medieval-Modern pottery found in strata that have been connected with the various erosional or anthropogenic sequences at the site. Thus, for ex- ample, it is significant (and satisfying) to note that no Medieval-Modern pottery has been found in the layers identified as floor deposit or connected in any significant way with the Chalcolithic structures at the southern end of Area 1. Naturally, by far the major- ity of the Medieval-Modern pottery was found in strata described as plow zone (cultivated and uncul- tivated). Perhaps more significant is the analysis of later pottery in some of the erosional sequences at the site. Thus, there is only one locus (N485E500 L2) where there was later pottery, as this has been identi- fied as no later than Medieval. Likewise, there was no Medieval-Modern pottery in the post-Early Pre- historic colluvium, and only two pieces of Medieval pottery in the 18 loci of pond sediments. Further, there was virtually no Medieval-Modern pottery in the loci associated with Stratum 2 colluvium (only in N485E490 L3), and none in Stratum 3 colluvium. By contrast, the rubble and stone fills in N470- N485E575 contained large quantities of later pot-</page><page sequence="55">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 77 tery-at least three of the loci with secure Medieval dates-and even the lower layers in this area (includ- ing erosional gully fill) seem to contain Medieval disturbance. Thus, overall, it does seem that the Me- dieval and later pottery, although scattered broadly throughout the excavated area, was confined prima- rily in contexts above (i.e., later than) those of the major erosional sequences. The conclusions to be drawn from this analysis are neither far-reaching nor surprising. They indicate the areas of the site where Medieval activity may have been concentrated (northern part of Area 1) and where evidence of Medieval occupation may have washed as a result of erosional activity (Area 3). The analysis suggests considerable density of activity in the 13th-15th, and especially the 16th, centuries C.E., with some falloff thereafter. Overall, however, the picture of Agios Savvas for the Medieval-Modern periods resembles that for earlier eras, determined by quite remarkable erosional sequences that radi- cally altered the landscape and moved the archaeo- logical material around to places different from those of their original deposition. In this context mention should be made of the Medieval-Modern sherds recovered from the sur- face in the course of the CPSP exploration of the area in 1986 (Rupp 1987). This material was, of course, found only on the surface, and we have seen already how the steep slope in the area has caused consider- able displacement of the archaeological material, pri- marily downhill from the higher portion of Area 1. Nonetheless, this surface material is pertinent to the discussion above, in part as a check of survivability to predict what lies under the surface and in part as a check on the chronological conclusions derived from the excavated material. The surface material is grouped into two sepa- rate units. The first (CPSP 1986.D.14) contains the Chalcolithic sherds, chipped stone and ground stone collected, as well as some of the Medieval-Modern sherds. This material comes principally from those portions of Areas 1 and 3 away from the monas- tery. The second collection (CPSP 1986.D.24) con- sists of the Medieval-Modern sherds recovered from the lower portion of Area 1 and the eastern half of Area 3, both adjacent to the monastery. Opportu- nistic grab samples of decorated Medieval-Modern sherds made during subsequent visits to the site are also included in this collection. As one would expect, this survey pottery31 gen- erally conforms to the periods and types discovered in the course of the excavation. Indeed, the broad chronological information derived from the survey sherds closely parallels that from the excavated ma- terial. Therefore, we can conclude that the survey re- sults were a good predictor of what would be found in the excavation. As might be expected, the exca- vation pottery allows greater precision in dating, and it points to greater activity in the 16th century C.E. than would have been surmised from the survey alone. Thus, the survey pottery includes no example from the Byzantine period, but begins with examples from the 13th century C.E. This documentation con- tinues through the 16th century C.E., but no exam- ples clearly assigned to the Ottoman period are recorded. Likewise, although most of the survey pot- tery is Cypriot in origin, there is one sherd of im- ported Maiolica, again a confirmation of the similar pieces found in the course of the excavation.

A few recovered fragments including 5 and 6 may be as early as the 19th or even 18th century C.E. Several other frag- ments, including 1-4, date to the Late Roman period, ca. 350-650 C.E. Evidently they were brought into the middle Dhiarizos Potamos valley by the residents of the Late Roman farmstead/estate at Prastio-Kok- kinolaona C (Rupp et al. 1994: 326; infra Rupp). As the Late Roman fragments were found in Areas 1 and 3, it is likely that they were deposited during an ep- isode of erosional activity (see above, pp. 25-34). Cat. no. 1 (fig. 40.1) is a rim fragment of a not particularly diagnostic small bowl or beaker. Its fire-polished rim can generally be placed in the Ro- man or Late Roman period. Fragment 2 (fig. 40.2) comes from the base of a thin-stemmed goblet which can be paralleled by many Cypriot examples of the later fourth through early seventh centuries C.E. (e.g., Vessberg 1956: fig. 45.18; Catling 1972: 76, fig. 41.G9; Chavane 1975: 57-59, no. 161). Nos. 3 and 4 most likely date to the Roman period as well. No. 5, a rim sherd of a blown glass bowl or beaker (fig. 40.3), and 6, a piece of a simple blue glass bracelet (fig. 40.4), most likely date to the Early Modern era.</page><page sequence="56">78 RUPP ET AL.

RUPP) The following tentative geomorphological con- struction may begin to explain the patterning of the excavated remains and the observed strata (see above, pp. 25-34) apparent after three seasons' work around the monastery. There seems to have been a fairly large basin in the underlying Moni Formation of the Mamonia Complex bedrock in the southern portion of Area 3, which most likely extended to the south to include at least the northern half of Area 2 (fig. 4). This basin filled with water to form a long- lasting pond. One or more springs upslope to the south along the scarp forming the southern edge of Area 2 probably fed this pond. Along this scarp in the marly chalks of the higher Lefkara Formation, the unconfined groundwater in the aquifer is able to reach the surface. The lava breccias and porphyritic pillow lavas of the Dhiarizos group of the Mamonia Terrane form the underlying impervious stratum. The spring that supplied water to the monastery until the severe earthquake in 1953 C.E. abruptly caused it to stop flowing may be the same one or a successor to the one postulated here.32 The presence of signifi- cant quantities of the freshwater snail Melanopsis praemorsa in the pond sediments in Area 3 (D. S. Reese, personal communication 1998) suggests that the postulated spring produced a copious quantity of water which formed a permanent stream running first to the pond33 and then flowing down (starting? in the general area of N505E505 in Area 1) to the Dhiarizos Potamos below to the north. The present dry stream- bed which starts in the locality of Mouttokambos to the northwest (fig. 41) may be the remnant of the earlier permanent stream. At least three separate(?) catastrophic episodes of erosion caused the deposition of three superimposed colluvial fans (Strata 2-4 in Area 3) into the pond's basin which formed the zone of net deposition. These colluvial strata would have come from the zone of net erosion which must have been located somewhere upslope (fig. 41) to the south-southwest (Boardman and Bell 1992). The dendritic network of deep, narrow gullies and minor, shallow rills in the underlying soft marly chalk bedrock revealed in the lower and midslope portions of Area 1 (fig. 11) point to at least three ma- jor erosional episodes which would have first stripped the overlying soil and subsoil horizons lying on the bedrock. This probably was followed by an episode that cut the gullies and rills into the bedrock. Subse- quent to these episodes, the network was filled up from possibly three other erosional episodes, depos- iting the sediments, the artifactual and ecofactual remains, and the building materials that came from the deflation and probable total destruction of one or more settlements farther up the slope to the south- east, to the east of Area 4 (fig. 41). Thus, the zone</page><page sequence="57">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 79 'Dhlarizos Potamos flood plain t"... ?,L- u iq r t 7 /7 99- CPSP86....9.2 ........ t.

The geomorphological history in the small area exposed around Building 1 in Area 1 is complex as well (fig. 12). A tentative interpretation may be put forward as follows. After the construction and use of Building 1, it was abandoned. One may conclude that this was the case as the deposit covering the floor does not contain burnt structural remains, and most of the artifacts found resting on the floor do not</page><page sequence="58">80 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 show signs of burning. At some point afterwards the underlying marly chalk bedrock apparently cracked or fissured, possibly from a severe earthquake. This activity appears to have created blocks of bedrock of varying sizes, with fissures and crevices of vary- ing widths and depths dividing them. The main and secondary fissures ran northeast-southwest, approx- imately at right angles to the slope. Smaller tertiary ones ran perpendicularly from them. The blocks to the north then(?) started to slip or subside slightly down the slope. At first, adjacent archaeological strata fell and/or were eroded into these expanding fissures. Later colluvial material from farther upslope washed in to fill them up completely. The steepness of the re- sulting slope to the north of these bedrock blocks per- mitted the total erosion of the archaeological strata that once rested on or near the bedrock's surface. The limited excavations here suggest, therefore, that there are probably no in situ architectural remains to the north of the line of the east-west fissure in the north- ern portion of N355E565 and N355E570/N360E570 or to the east of the eastern portion of the later unit (fig. 11). If there is any more architecture preserved, it would most likely lie in the trapezoidal area to the west-southwest. No complete structures could be expected to be found there unless they had a diameter of less than 10 m and/or were small and rectilinear in plan. The trenches excavated in Area 4 (fig. 3) suggest that the now shallow, vaguely amphitheater-like land- form was originally a more sharply defined drainage feature. This drainage feature may have originated farther upslope to the southeast in the area of the lo- cality of Plevra tou Miri (fig. 41). It then could have run downslope to the northwest through Area 4 over the bedrock ledge which forms the boundary between Areas 1 and 4, at approximately where Building 1 is located. After that it could have skirted the bedrock feature immediately to the north of Building 1, then run northwestward again through the southwestern portion of Area 1 to the southern extreme of Area 2.34 The stratification in trench N300E500 in this part of Area 1 shows thick erosional strata over bedrock sim- ilar to that seen in the Area 4 trenches. In at least the eastern side of this topographical feature in Area 4, small erosional gullies formed in the soft marly chalk at some point. A deep geomorphological feature en- countered in N320E600 had a cavity cut purposefully into its northeastern side. Rough, unworked lime- stone slabs once sealed this cavity. In the cavity the partial skeletal remains of seven individuals were de- posited in a secondary burial context. The presence of a necklace made from Dentalium shells and a picro- lite cruciform figurine points to a date for the ossuary in the Middle Chalcolithic period (Peltenburg 1991 b: 113-18, table 6). With this provisional construction of the geomor- phology in mind, the problem of relating it to the chronological and spatial patterning of the archaeo- logical remains now must be addressed. As J. Clarke cautioned with justification (see above, p. 45), the dating of the EP ceramic material strictly on inter- nal stylistic considerations and external comparanda in the almost total absence of well-stratified contexts with large quantities of sherds is very risky. This is especially true for the Chalcolithic period if there were significant intraregional differences35 or larger vs. smaller settlement differences. These caveats hav- ing been stated, it is nonetheless important to put forward some hypotheses concerning the patterning of human occupation in the general area of the mon- astery since the beginning of the fourth millennium B.C.E. and the possible postdepositional processes that have shaped the archaeological record as revealed by our fieldwork. The freshwater pond apparently was one of the major attractions to human occupation in the gen- eral area as well as the focus of settlement (fig. 41). The earliest evidence for settlement at the end of the Late Ceramic Neolithic/beginning of the Early Chalcolithic(?), ca. 4100-3700 B.C.E. (Knapp 1993: table 1), is on the spur of hillside to the northwest (Prastio Kokkinolaona A: CPSP 1986.D.18/1991.2; Rupp et al. 1992: 289). The three superposed collu- vial fans in the pond basin in Area 3 may represent material from the deflation and the possible total de- struction of either a settlement which had an area within it that was occupied first and then abandoned or of two different settlements. The ceramics in the colluvial fans in Area 3 provide some support for such a construction. The lower Stratum 4 has sherds that date to the later Early Chalcolithic(?)/begin- ning(?) of the Middle Chalcolithic period, ca. 3600- 3400 B.C.E. (Knapp 1993: tablel). The higher Strata 2 and 3 have sherds that date to the earlier Middle Chal- colithic period, ca. 3400-3100 B.C.E. (Knapp 1993: table 1), which is possibly contemporary with Kisso- nerga Mosphilia 3a (see Rupp et al. 1994; Clarke and Rupp 1995). The location of such a settlement would have been upslope to the south-southwest (fig. 41). While the sediments in the vineyard that once existed in this area were bulldozed almost completely</page><page sequence="59">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 81 away, there are worn sherds on the surface at the up- per edge of the now sedimentless hillside. The set- tlement must have extended to the east at least as far as Building 1. Some of the debris from this settle- ment eroded into the gully network in Area 1. The focus of occupation may have then moved farther east to the higher ground immediately to the east of Area 4. The recent bulldozing of this former vine- yard precludes confirmation of this suggestion. Al- though the evidence is very scant, this postulated settlement may date to the later Middle Chalcolithic period (possibly contemporary with Kissonerga Mos- philia 3b)/earlier Late Chalcolithic(?) period, ca. 3100-2700 B.C.E. (Knapp 1993: table 1) (see above, p. 62). This postulated pattern of settlement cluster- ing or drift during the Chalcolithic period has been suggested for the Kissonerga/Lemba areas as well as for the Kalavasos/Mari area (J. Clarke, personal communication 1996). Immediately adjacent to the eastern floodplain in the middle portion of the Dhia- rizos Potamos there are a number of isolated, unusual, prominent, steep-sided rock outcrops of lava breccias and porphyritic pillow lavas of the Dhiarizos group of the Mamonia Terrane. Frequently within a kilo- meter of each outcrop there is at least one Early Prehistoric site. Below Agios Savvas, at the locality called Louvorotsos, there is such an outcrop (fig. 41). These may have served as settlement "sign posts" or "natural signifiers" in the cognitive map of the Chal- colithic residents of the valley (W. A. Fox, personal communication 1986; Knapp 1997: 16-18). The general subsistence pattern of the inhabitants of these Middle Chalcolithic "settlements" around Agios Savvas diverges little from that seen in other contemporaneous settlements on the island (Croft in Rupp et al. 1994). The lithic technological basis of this economy at Agios Savvas is also analogous. The ceramic assemblage, on the other hand, may not reflect a broad and dynamic intraregional cultural perspective. The manufacture of a wide range of pi- crolite objects at these "settlements" from unworked pebbles obtained in some unknown fashion from the Kouris Potamos riverbed indicates, however, that the inhabitants did not live in isolated, autarchic com- munities. The presence of small quantities of marine shells also supports this view (D. S. Reese, personal communication 1997). Thus, the scenario proposed by Peltenburg and Bolger, of incipient socioeco- nomic asymmetries both within Middle Chalcolithic settlements as well as among them, may not have been as clearly articulated, at least for the latter, as the evidence from Kissonerga Mosphilia is inter- preted to support. There is no further evidence for possible settle- ment until the Late Cypriot IA period, ca. 1650- 1550 B.C.E. (Knapp 1993: table 1) (see above, pp. 60-62), where it may have been located again on the higher point of land to the south-southeast. The occupation appears to have continued into Late Cypriot II. The tomb(s) at Prastio Angathera (Mout- tikambos?) (see n. 23) may be associated with this postulated settlement. There appears to have been another hiatus in the active utilization of the area for approximately another millennium. The wall, the complete vessel, and the favissa of terracotta figurines dating to the later Cypro-Archaic period (ca. 600-475 B.C.E.) found in the western section of the east-west back- hoe trench in Area 2 point to the possibility of a sanctuary near the pond. The concentrations of later Cypro-Archaic painted, open shapes of fine and finer wares around N505E505 in Area 3 and another one around N480E575 in Area 1 plus a similar sherd in N360E565 may suggest the existence at one time of a tomb or some other use of the eastern portion of the "site."36 The 1986 survey material collected around the monastery37 suggests some sort of activ- ity between ca. 350 and 50 B.C.E. (Lund 1993: fig. 56; C-43). This evidence may be related to the Zeus Sabazios material (see n. 11) which dates to around the mid-second century B.C.E. Thus, there may have been a continuation of the later Iron Age temenos near the pond or the establishment of a new sanctu- ary in the general area. The next evidence for occupation lies to the southwest of Area 2. In a triangular-shaped vineyard (Prastio Kokkinolaona C) there is a surface sherd scatter of Late Roman 2 sherds dating to ca. 400- 650 C.E. (Lund 1993: 108, 110, fig. 58; C-263).38 The rough terrace walls surrounding the vineyard are constructed of stones and cobbles which most likely were collected in the Dhiarizos Potamos riverbed and used originally in the construction of house walls. Lying on top of the terrace walls are crudely cut stone column drums, other roughly cut ashlar blocks, and an olive press base. These might come from a small agricultural estate. To the northwest on the end of the pointed spur of land on which the earliest occupation in the general area is attested, there are footed chamber tombs (Prastio Kokkino- laona B; CPSP 1986.D.19) which may be contempo- rary with the material from the vineyard. The glass</page><page sequence="60">82 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 fragments recovered in the excavations also suggest activity in the general area between the third-fourth and the sixth-seventh centuries B.C.E. Today the most visible signs of human occupa- tion in the area are the Church of Agios Savvas and the ruins of the monastery that surround it. The mon- astery was probably founded ca. 1120 C.E. The visi- ble foundations beyond the northeastern end of the church must be from this early 12th century C.E. structure. In the early 13th century C.E. during the Lusignan kingdom, apparently it was a Latin church; by 1486 C.E. it appears to have returned to Orthodox hands (der Parthog 1995: 67). In December of that year, the monastery (though not the church) was de- stroyed by fire. The monastery was rebuilt probably at the same time that the church was restored in 1501 C.E. (der Parthog 1995: 66). The ceramic remains (see above, p. 77) suggest that activity at the monas- tery increased in the 15th and reached its height in the 16th century C.E. during the Venetian period. Afterwards there is increasingly less evidence for its use although the restoration work was carried out in 1742, 1910, and 1929 C.E. (der Parthog 1995: 66-67). The systemic effects of the Ottoman con- quest of the island in 1571 C.E. may well account for this decline in the wealth and fortunes of the monastery. The two walls discovered in the central and eastern portions of the east-west backhoe trench in Area 2 (see above, pp. 28-29) may date to the beginning of the 16th century C.E. It is quite pos- sible, based on our state of knowledge of the pat- terning of artifacts in the area, that the catastrophic erosional episodes hypothesized previously began to occur after the decline in the activity associated with the monastery. In other words, the probable in- tensive agricultural utilization of the landscape im- mediately around the monastery in the 15th and 16th centuries C.E. may have caused a significant degra- dation of the landscape. This could have created the situation for the one or more likely many cata- strophic erosional episodes that choked up the pond and its basin with extensive colluvial fans, cut the networks of erosional gullies in the soft bedrock, and deflated as well as mostly destroyed the archae- ological strata from a series of mid-fourth through mid-second millennia B.C.E. small settlements on the hills around the pond, redepositing them lower down the slopes. The evidence from N480E575, N475E575, and N470E575 in the lower portion of Area 1 points to at least five such episodes. The first one stripped the hillsides of soil and subsoil horizons, depositing these sediments in a thick series of layers above the bed- rock at the bottom of the hill. This colluvial surge may have caused the destruction and resulting aban- donment of the room(s) along the southern exterior wall of the monastery seen in N490E575. In the next episode, the network of gullies and rims was cut into the exposed soft bedrock. The third episode filled this system with the deflated contents of the archae- ological strata from the remains of the Early Pre- historic and Bronze Age settlements farther up the slope. There is furtive evidence in the fill of these gullies to suggest the possibility of three slightly dif- ferent layers or phases in this process of filling the system. Above the uppermost gully fill there is evi- dence for a simple plastered havara floor. There are not, however, any extant walls to go with it. Directly above this floor in the unit excavated in N475E575 in 1994, there is a layer of densely packed, unorga- nized stones and cobbles. This layer of stones con- tinues in the other unit in the trench to the northeast as well as into N470E575 to the southeast. These stones most likely originated from the destroyed rub- ble walls of the earlier houses upslope that ended up in the fill of the gullies. This concentration of stones may represent an attempt to utilize in some fashion the new topography of the area for structures and/or terrace walls. Another, thinner erosional layer covers this horizon. The extensive bulldozing that occurred about 25-30 years ago prior to the planting of the present vineyard destroyed any possible evidence above this fifth layer. If the tentative geomorphological and archaeo- logical constructions put forward here have some reasonable degree of probability, then there are wider ramifications for archaeological research in western Cyprus and possibly elsewhere on the island. These include the likelihood that a significant portion of the present landscape of the Dhiarizos Potamos val- ley is the product of human and natural transforma- tional processes which occurred in the past 200-400 years. These processes contributed to the destruction of what were once the stratified remains of ancient settlements and, then, to the partial redeposition of their jumbled remains in new locations lower down the valley slopes. Although a major portion of the transported artifactual and ecofactual materials may have ended up in the river floodplain or in deeply buried colluvial deposits, some of them ended up in superficial sediments. Materials in sediments that are now cultivated are susceptible to detection by archae- ological survey techniques. If the artifact densities in these locations of secondary deposition are high,</page><page sequence="61">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 83 the variety of artifact classes is logically consistent, and the scatter is physically discrete, then they prob- ably would be labeled as an "archaeological site" by a survey archaeologist. This is therefore more of an artificial and vaguely defined construct than is recognized normally in practice. What is interesting here is that many of these so-called sites are in vine- yards established 25-30 years ago, if not earlier. The frequent cultivation regime followed for vineyards throughout the year contributes to the relatively high visibility of artifacts on the surface and, hence, the higher probability of observation by an archaeologi- cal survey crew. The farmers must have intuitively recognized that these colluvial sediments from de- flated ancient settlements represent ideal ones for the successful cultivation of grapevines. Further analyses now in progress and the synthesis of the various data sets will enable us to provide a fuller, better documented picture39 of the approxi- mately 4,000 years of human occupation and utiliza- tion of the area. The accuracy of our final interpretation of these results should improve as well. NOTES 1The Cypro-Archaic ceramics and terracotta figurines (Lone Wriedt Sorensen), the Hellenistic and Roman ce- ramics (John Lund), the shells (David S.

In this context special rec- ognition and thanks should be extended to Mr. and Mrs. John Amerman, The Mattel Foundation, and the late Mr. and Mrs. Elmer W. Rupp (to whom this article is dedicated in memoriam) for their continued generosity, support, and encouragement. 5Excavations were conducted at Agios Savvas over 21 days in late July through early August 1994, in late October 1994, and in early May 1995. In addition to the individuals named in note 3, the staff consisted of Ms. Corinna Schoen- felder (project manager, field office supervisor, and 1994 AART Research Assistant Program assistant instructor), Ms. Kristina Alveby (assistant chipped stone artifact ana- lyst), Ms. Christina Hatzimichael (assistant ceramic ana- lyst), Ms. Karen Giering (assistant field office supervisor), Mr. Sotiris Hadjicharambous (trench supervisor), Mr. Mario LaGace (assistant photographer), and Dr. Metaxia Tsipo- poulou (archaeological illustrator and object photogra- pher). The dedicated work (including the backfilling of all the trenches) of the AART RAP'94 group ensured the over- all success of the season. The fine hospitality and excellent food provided by Mr. Polikarpos Andreou, his wife, and family at the Dhiarizos Taverna in Kouklia made our eve- nings worth looking forward to each day at the site. 6The topographical map of the area of the "site" with suspected archaeological remains, begun in 1993, was ex- panded and completed. It was created by Mr. Spyros Avraam of S. A. Marketing Engineering Co. Trading House (Lef- kosia, Cyprus) using a Sokkia Total Station SET 3C instru- ment. He was assistant by Michalis Avraam and WCP staff and crew members. The data were imported into Auto- CAD 12.0 for the production of the actual map. Mr. Ian</page><page sequence="62">84 RUPP ET AL. BASOR 316 Duquemin, ID CompuDraft (St. Catharines, ON) modified this map and others for publication. 7 As in previous seasons, all of the loci excavated were dry-sieved using a 0.5-cm mesh. In addition, 50-liter sed- iment samples were taken from significant loci and then run through a water flotation unit for a 100 percent recov- ery rate. 8As the study of all of the artifactual, ecofactual, and geomorphological materials by the various researchers will not be complete until summer 2000, this preliminary re- port is subject to revision and enlargement in light of their findings. 9The owner of cadastral plot 214.44 is Mr. Zacharias Alexandrou of Lemesos. 1oThe owner of cadastral plot 181 is Mr. Eugenios Zachariades of Kato Polemidia (Lemesos District). These trenches were erroneously labeled as N460E490 and N475E500, respectively, in Rupp et al. 1993: 388, and the location of trench N460E495 was incorrectly located in fig. 6. 11 There is evidence to suggest the existence of a sanc- tuary dedicated to Zeus Sabazios somewhere in the imme- diate vicinity of Agios Savvas. In 1969 at least 32 objects (terracotta figurines, ceramic vessels, and lamps) were dis- covered by accident during leveling operations in a vine- yard (the village is given erroneously as Trakhypedhoula, not Prastio; Karageorghis 1970: 216, 218, figs. 49-54). The two lamps which were inscribed with the deity's epi- thet are dated on general stylistic and epigraphical criteria to the mid-second century B.C.E. (Lane 1986: 199-200; Anastasiades 1995: 234-35). Whether or not the material found in 1994 can be associated in any way with this material is purely speculative. 12Cadastral plot 214.19 is owned by Mr. Sokratis Sokratous of Salamiou (Pafos District). 13These trench designations were made arbitrarily at the time they were started, as the Electronic Distance Measurement Total Station (EDM TS) was not available for proper layout and location. These working designa- tions, therefore, do not correspond to what should be their proper designations in terms of the site's 5-m grid module. 14Cadastral plot 214.17 is owned by Ms. Maria Geor- ghiou of Trakhypedhoula (Pafos District). It should be noted here that the tentative designation "Area 4" was originally given in 1992 to the vineyard adjacent to the northwest of Area 3 (Rupp et al. 1993: fig. 6). This vine- yard is Cadastral Plot 219 and is owned by Ms. Geor- goulla Andrea of Trakhypedhoula (Pafos District). It has been relabeled as Area 5 (see above, p. 37). 15 Cadastral plot 214.18. 16A fragmentary limestone bowl found in the backdirt (see above, p. 59) also may have been a grave offering. 17This stratum is of similar composition to Stratum 7 and probably represents the discards/debris from living/ use activities in and around the structure. 18This stratum represents the discards/debris from liv- ing/use in and around the structure. The 5 percent contam- ination in the deposit represents material from the edges of the deposit where it is bisected by the gully and the fissure. 19The terracotta figurines from Agios Savvas will be analyzed and interpreted as a group for the final synthetic article. 20It should be noted here that the Medieval sherds found in this locus came from the fill of a geomorpholog- ical feature. The ossuary was cut into the northeastern side of this feature (see fig. 17). Given the limited space avail- able to excavate the ossuary itself, as well as its depth from the surface, both areas were included under this locus des- ignation. No sherds, however, were found in the ossuary deposit itself. 21 The chipped stone tools and debitage recovered in the May 1995 excavations are not included in this discussion. 22The author inspected the sherds at the Kouklia Ar- chaeological Museum on May 2, 1996. She wishes to thank David Rupp and the staff of the museum, especially Onisi- foros Loukaides, for the opportunity to do so, and to thank M.-L. von Wartburg and F-G. Maier for their hospitality during the visit. 230ne or more "Middle Cypriot" tombs were discov- ered by accident at Prastio Angathera in the lower part of the hill slope below the monastery. The material is regis- tered under the Cyprus Survey number 1782. This most likely came from the vineyard in the locality called Mout- tokambos on the 1:5,000 topographic map immediately be- low and to the northwest of Areas 3 and 5. Here RP sherds were collected in 1993 along the base of a bulldozed scarp. A major later Middle Cypriot site lies directly across the river at Prastio Lakries (CPSP 1982.D.1/WCP 92.1; see Rupp et al. 1993: 383-85). From this point northward until the pillow lava formations on both sides of the river valley, there is ample evidence on the surface and in modern ter- race and road cuts for later Middle Cypriot settlements (Rupp 1987). 24 Another very small and worn WS II bowl body sherd (PAS 92.7.190; Area 1: N500E500 L2), with only a trace of paint remaining, was not cataloged. 25Another very small body sherd from a small closed vessel (PAS 92.7.189; Area 3: N500E500 L2), tentatively identified as White-Painted Wheelmade ware, may also date to this phase. 26 Several other sherds may be of Late Chalcolithic date. PAS 94.7.64 (Area 1: N475E575 L14): rim and body sherd of open vessel; fine rim with straight profile; brown bur- nished self-slip on outer and inner surfaces. PAS 94.7.71 (Area 1: surface): rim sherd of open vessel; rounded rim with straight profile; brown burnished self-slip on outer and inner surfaces. PAS 93.7.306 (Area 1: N465E575 L3): two body sherds from a large open vessel. PAS 93.7.307 (Area 1: N450E580 L5): body sherd of open vessel; red-brown burnished outer surface and black burnished inner surface.</page><page sequence="63">1999 PRASTIO-AGIOS SAVVAS TIS KARONIS MONASTERY 85 PAS 93.7.311 (Area 1: N445E575 L2): body sherd of open vessel similar to 93.7.306. It should be noted in this context that J. T. Clarke, having looked at these sherds, does not believe they are of Chalcolithic date. Given the extreme paucity of this material, nothing definite can be said at this point. What one can say is that these sherds are of Early Prehistoric date and that they fall within the broad time range after the Middle Chalcolithic and before the Middle Cypriot periods. 27CPSP refers to the Canadian Palaipaphos Survey Project. 28While this tile is registered as coming from the sur- face, in fact it came from the eastern scarp in L7 just above the marly chalk bedrock. 29Fig. 33 is based on the presence of loci from the Medieval-Modern periods within a given trench. Thus, in fig. 33 if the trench has one locus dated to the Medieval period, it will appear with a dot. 30The following rough chronology is used: Medieval: 1191-1571 c.E.; Early Modern: 1571-1878 c.E.; Modern: 1878 c.E.-present. 31The pottery in question from 1986.D.14 is: Glaze- painted ware: D24, D26, D27; Italian Sgraffito ware: D66; Cypriot Sgraffito ware: D100, D116, D120; Coarse Ware: D162, D163. The sherds from 1986.D.24 are: Plain Glazed ware: D25; Cypriot Sgraffito ware: D90; Coarse Ware: D167, D169, D171, D175, D176, D178, D199; and tile: D223 (Gregory 1993). 32Anecdotal evidence to support the existence of a stream and a pond is provided by some older residents of Trakhypedhoula. They claim that before the 1953 earth- quake, Area 2 was prone to extensive flooding during the winter rainy season. 33According to J. S. Ridout Sharpe, the freshwater snail Melanopsis praemorsa's "natural habitat is mountain streams and small rivers: it requires a high oxygen content in the water and is almost entirely restricted to permanent bodies of running water" (Ridout Sharpe in Peltenburg 1991b: 82). 34This now buried drainage feature may well have aug- mented the flow of water into the pond. If it had a spring as its permanent source rather than simply surface water runoff during the interrainy season, then the snails men- tioned in n. 33 may have lived in it primarily. 35It should be noted, however, that D. Bolger (1987: 74-75) argues that there is no sign of regional difference on the island before the Late Chalcolithic period. 36In the 1986 survey around Agios Savvas, one sherd from a Bichrome Red I (IV) bowl was collected (Sorensen 1993: B-179). As the general date for this period, Cypro- Archaic I, is ca. 750-600 B.C.E., the postulated temenos may have been earlier than the Cypro-Archaic II period. 37While some non-Early Prehistoric sherds found around Agios Savvas during the 1986 survey activity were included in the material assigned to the Chalcolithic site CPSP 1986.D. 14, the majority were collectively subsumed under the site designation CPSP 1986.D.24 which was assigned to the monastery itself. 38Subsequent exploration of the environs of the mon- astery enabled us to differentiate spatially the Late Roman 2 scatter from others associated with the monastery. As this happened in 1991-1992, no formal CPSP site desig- nation was given to it. 39This synthetic and interpretative article will represent the "final publication" for the WCP work and research at Agios Savvas.
