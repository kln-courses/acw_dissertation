<plain_text><page sequence="1">T h e M e a n i n g s o f Suffering~ by STAN VAN HOOFT Western thinkers have usually falsified our experience of suffering in trying to make sense of it. In a postmodern age, their accounts seem implausible. We need a way of making sense of suffering while admitting its horror. uffering is one of the most profound and dis- turbing of human experiences. The very word suffering has a resonance that relates to our sense of life's meaning and the threat suffering poses to our hopes of happiness. It does not refer just to maladies, pains, and difficulties with which we can and should cope. It involves crises and threats that constitute a degradation or alienation of our being.' It is the spiritual dimension of our existence or the "contemplative" aspect of our being, to use Aristotle's term, not only the bodily aspects of our selves, that is implicated in suffering.

HASTINGS CENTER REPORT 13 September-October 1998</page><page sequence="2">Suffering is a spiritual phenomenon, an event that strikes at the faith we can have in life. The role of suffering in our lives is contested at the level of discourse at which cultural mean- ings and visions of human life are negotiated. In evaluating its role, the central question is whether suffering is a good thing or a bad thing. This may seem an odd question to pose; it may seem obvious that suffering is intrin- sically bad. Given the ineliminability of suffering from our lives, however, a central project of human thought is to make it bearable or acceptable, and one of the most common ways of doing this is to show it to be good in some way. If suffering were seen as a positive event or force in our lives, we would be better able to endure it. Accordingly, our cultural tradition contains many attempts to make suf- fering positive.2 Simultaneously, there are those who think such attempts a species of bad faith and who argue that, if we are to be authentic in the face of it, suffering must always be considered negative. This paper ex- plores a few of the attempts in the Western tradition to give suffering meaning and then asks whether an authentic acceptance of suffering as something inherently negative, de- structive, and adverse to human hap- piness can still be acceptable. Ancient Conceptions: Suffering and the World 1rom the very earliest of times in the West, suffering has been asso- ciated with the concept of justice. What the spiritual or contemplative functions of our thinking seek is a co- herent and totalizing world view in which everything has its place and nothing disturbs the order. Within such a divinely decreed cosmos, suf- fering would result either from a human violation of the supernatural order or a divine response to such a violation. Perhaps the most primeval and naive reaction to suffering is to think of it as punishment. Cultures and re- ligions around the world abound with examples of the belief that suf- fering is a punishment exacted by the gods. But this is already an anthropo- morphic rendering of a more primi- tive idea: namely, that, despite its ubiquity, suffering is something that should not happen. It is something that is inherently negative. It is a de- parture from how things should be. But why? Clearly, it is contrary to what the victim or victims of the suf- fering would want. But it would be hubris to suppose that the mere wish- es of individuals could establish the axiological status of suffering. The value status of everything, including suffering, must arise from an order of reality greater than that of puny hu- man individuals or peoples. It must arise from the gods. Suffering must be seen as part of the divine order, and the most obvious explanation in a universe that contains gods who have emotions and desires like hu- man beings is that suffering is sent by the gods to punish human beings for deeds that displease the gods. In this way suffering becomes part of the divine order despite its apparent evil and acquires an explanation of why it is, after all, to be borne with equa- nimity. The genius of ancient Greek thought was to have transcended the anthropomorphic gods and replaced them with more abstract concepts. The concept of justice acquired a content similar to that of destiny; it alluded to the cosmic order itself. The one fragment of the thinking of Anaximander that has come down to us expresses the matter thus: Things perish into those things out of which they have their birth, according to that which is or- dained; for they give reparation to one another and pay the penalty of their injustice according to the disposition of time.3 Two crucial elements comprise this thought. First, there is the notion of change as a constant flow into and out of existence in accordance with an overarching destiny (an idea that, secularized further, became the con- cept of causal determinism). Second, there is the somewhat more complex idea that such change is somehow an offense to the divine order and that reparation therefore has to be made for the very contingency of the exis- tence of things. Change is an offense to the eternal and changeless scheme of justice, where justice involves that fated order in which everything is as it should be. In contrast to this divine order, changeable reality is an offense that calls for reparation. The penalty that needs to be paid is suffering. In this way a conceptual association is expressed and forged between suffer- ing, existence in this world, and pun- ishment. Suffering in this world was inevitable, negative, and necessary. But it was ordained by the supernat- ural order, and therefore ultimately positive. Plato developed this contrast be- tween two worlds, one of divinely constituted perfection and the other of worldly change and corruption, into a secular metaphysical system. Martha Nussbaum has argued that Plato's metaphysical system was a re- sponse to the fragility, danger, and sorrow of worldly existence.4 In the face of these afflictions, the contem- plative mind created a realm of per- fection from which to draw consola- tion. On the eve of his death, Plato's hero Socrates welcomes his fate on the ground that it will take him out of this world of suffering, change, and obfuscation and into a realm where clarity and light will guarantee his knowledge of the Forms of Beau- ty, Truth, and Goodness. Although there is no direct link here between suffering and punishment, there is an association between suffering and a lesser form of existence, namely, exis- tence in a world of variability, corrup- tion, and epistemological uncertainty. Christianity: Suffering as Reparation The idea that suffering is an in- evitable and inescapable aspect of worldly existence but that it can be 14 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT September-October 1998</page><page sequence="3">escaped by a form of self-transcen- dence, an elevation to a higher mode of existence, can also be found in many of the great world religions, in- cluding Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity. In the West, the pre- dominant way of giving suffering meaning is still derived from Christianity. For a Christian, human beings are tainted with original sin. There is here another version of the notion that worldly existence is less than perfect, even corrupt, but in this version, the primordial condition of humanity requires reparation. As a natural outgrowth of a religious tradi- tion in which ritual blood sacrifice was used to appease God and seek His favor, and in which guilt for sin was washed away in sacrificial blood, suffering came to be seen as a price that had to be paid for sin. And so heinous was the original crime of humanity that nothing less than the suffering of a God was required to achieve reparation for it. Christ's suf- fering on the cross thus becomes a paradigm case of positive suffering. It was this sacrifice that saved human- kind from sin, and every Christian is called upon to participate in it by dedicating his or her own suffering to this salvific task or by declaring his or her faith in its achievement. Thus the Christian believes that salvation is achieved through suffering, whether his or her own or that of Christ. This account can be complicated. At least one writer in the Christian tradition, Stanley Hauerwas, has re- centy argued that Christians should not in any simplistic way align their suffering with that represented by the cross. According to Hauerwas, only suffering accepted for some moral reason is Christlike. Hauerwas argues that suffering is an intrinsic part of our moral lives. No human life could be complete without accepting some suffering as part of its moral project. Just as we should be prepared to ac- cept death for some overwhelmingly noble cause, so we should be pre- pared to accept suffering in propor- tion to the value at issue. Even in mundane contexts our moral self- project or our autonomy involves being able to give up things that we want. "Suffering is not morally sig- nificant only because things happen to us that we cannot avoid," writes Hauerwas, "but because the demand divine providence works in a similar way, by suggesting that all the unfor- tunate things that occur in the world have a larger purpose and will ulti- mately tend to the good, as guaran- teed by God. This too is a theory that Our bodies might suffer maladies, we might suffer pain, our zest for life might be lost, our relationships shattered, our projects failures, our suffering real, and yet we can think of it as for the ultimate good. of morality cannot be satisfied with- out asking the self to submit to limits imposed by morality itself. In this sense, without allowing ourselves and others to suffer we could not be human or humane."5 This insightful observation about human life recasts the meaning of suffering by turning it into sacrifice. Suffering for a cause, even merely giv- ing up something we want for the sake of something worthier, frustrates our desires and might for that reason be thought of as suffering. Insofar as these experiences are freely accepted for the sake of some good, however, they are actually cases of sacrifice. That is, one is accepting some frus- tration, pain, or negative experience for the sake of something better or worthier. However the relation between the Christian's suffering and the suffer- ings of Christ is understood, the out- lines of the Christian theory of suffer- ing are clear. At the contemplative level of our being, where we establish the meaningfulness of our lives by relating it to a larger story, reality, or cosmic theory, Christians relate their suffering to the story of Christ so as to give it meaning. In this way Chris- tians feel that they can contribute their suffering to the salvific plan of God. Suffering loses its prima facie negative character for the victim by being given a transcendent, positive meaning. The Christian concept of belongs to the meaning-seeking or contemplative aspect of our exis- tence. It too allows us to understand suffering and misfortune as meaning- ful, in this case by situating it within a divine providential plan. The key point about an authentic acceptance of suffering is that suffer- ing is not made meaningful. It is in- herently negative. What is crucial in the Christian theories is that suffering is experienced as negative-it really is suffering-but that when suffering is given meaning within the larger story, it becomes something positive. Suffering will be negative in that it hinders the fulfillment of the biologi- cal aims of the body, negative in that it involves pain or other frustrations of our desires and needs, and negative in that it frustrates our practical pro- jects and our pursuit of everyday goals. Yet it becomes positive by virtue of the meaning-giving aspect of our existence. Our bodies might suffer maladies, we might suffer pain, our zest for life might be lost, our re- lationships shattered, our projects failures, our suffering real, and yet we can think of it as for the ultimate good. And in this way the meaning- filness and integration of our exis- tence can be preserved and even en- hanced despite the trauma we experi- ence. It is among the highest tri- umphs of human existence that it can achieve the overcoming and transfor- mation of suffering in this way. HASTINGS CENTER REPORT 15 September-October 1998</page><page sequence="4">Even within the Christian tradi- tion, these ways of turning suffering into something positive have been questioned. In a rich and complex argument, Simone Weil has stressed the irreducibly negative character of suffering even when conceived from a theological perspective. Weil argues that some suffering amounts to what she calls "affliction," a form of suffer- ing that damages the selfhood and crushes the spirit of its victim. Where- as everyday pain and suffering are troubles we can cope with, in the face of which we can bless God for the challenges He sends us, affliction cannot but lead to despair. Whether because of the intensity or the inter- minable duration of the agony, the victim of affliction is reduced to being a thing completely determined by the blind forces of causality. Such suffering is a form of humiliation and of absolute degradation. To en- dure it is to be a slave to the pain and anguish that the victim undergoes. Moreover, by focusing the victim's attention excusively on personal dis- tress, it constitutes the victim as total- ly alienated in relation to others and to Otherness. Affliction leads to total separation from hope, from society, and from God. And yet, Weil goes on to say, it is precisely in this total abnegation that the victim participates in the afflic- tion of Christ. Christ also suffered abandonment by God. The following passages give the flavor of Weil's thinking: Men struck down by affliction are at the foot of the Cross, almost at the greatest possible distance from God.6 As for us men, our misery gives us the infinitely precious privilege of sharing in this distance placed between the Son and his Father (p. 446). If the tree of life, and not simply the divine seed, is already formed in a man's soul at the time when extreme affliction strikes him, then he is nailed to the same cross as Christ (p. 453). The key to Weil's thinking in these quotes is the notion of distance. Weil argues that the incarnation both es- tablishes and bridges the distance be- tween God and creation but without thereby alleviating the meaningless- ness and alienation of creation. The Cross of Christ therefore represents the reality of the abandonment and hopelessness of the human condition arising from its distance from God. Affliction is a state that we must all accept, just as Christ did, because it is inevitable within our created con- dition. And yet Weil does not deduce from these insights that affliction has a positive meaning. She rejects utterly any doctrine of providence. Creation really is meaningless and purposeless and our place in it really is subject to the utter degradation of affliction. The perennial cry of every afflicted person, "Why?", was uttered by Christ himself and received no an- swer. We must simply accept that the love of God sets up this distance be- tween creation (including the incar- nate Christ) and Himself. It is be- cause of this distance that affliction (as well as other more positive mys- teries such as beauty) occurs. Our quest for meaning yields only silence and in this silence is the space for love and faith. "God's secret word of love can be nothing else but silence" (p. 467). Suffering in a Secular Age 7The Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas also firmly rejects the possibility that suffering has any providential meaning. Reflecting on the Holocaust, Levinas concedes that suffering of such magnitude and such uselessness cannot be absorbed into a justifying theological narrative. God was silent in Auschwitz and remains so. And yet there is a nontheological meaning that can be ascribed to suf- fering if one's view of one's own suf- fering might be different from one's view of the suffering of others. Indeed, it must be different. To say of the suffering of another that it is jus- tified by having a meaning or a pur- pose is to denigrate the other by mak- ing him a means to some purpose. It is an immoral gesture that refuses to see the suffering for what it is: useless. Our response to the suffering of the other must be compassion, not expla- nation. Indeed, Levinas argues that suffering is a unique possibility for overcoming the isolation that we all experience as atomistic individuals in a narcissistic society. Even in our own experience, suffering cannot be ab- sorbed into the world that we consti- tute for ourselves as our own. It is al- ways strange and foreign. Whereas it is the existential nature of our being to be active in relation to the world, in the face of suffering we are passive. As a result suffering is always an alien- ation of our being. It destroys our self- possession and our self-satisfied en- joyment of life. This allows us to be open to the suffering of the other through com- passion. Rather than being enclosed in the solipsism of self-concern, with the presence of the other a mere ra- tional posit unable to touch our being in its intimacy, our encounter with the suffering of another calls upon our responsibility and awakens us to the real presence of the other in his or her need. In this way the negativity and meaninglessness of suffering, rather than being wiped out in a theodicy, provide the basis of real contact with others. It creates the in- terpersonal space in which ethics can occur. As Levinas puts it, "For pure suffering, which is intrinsically meaningless and condemned to itself without exit, a beyond takes shape in the inter-human."7 My helping the other is a recognition of that person's being, and a recognition no mere the- oretical thought could accomplish. Suffering, therefore, has a meaning in the interhuman world that preserves its inherent negativity: it grounds the ethical. Are such ways of giving meaning to suffering available in a postmodern secular age? What meaning is avail- able for people without religious or even humanistic faith? A schematic 16 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT September-October 1998</page><page sequence="5">answer can be found in the ancient Stoic philosophers and in Nietzsche, who in different ways embraced a tragic sense of life. They held that there is no plan, no purpose, and no What meaning is available for people without religious or even humanistic faith? meaning to existence arising from reality itself. The cosmos does not run in accordance with a divine plan or an inherent goal. There is no over- arching fate or justice. The world is just a vast dynamic system of change and becoming. Everything becomes what it is and changes in systems of mutual interaction and effect. Hu- man beings are subject to "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." Whatever happens is caused by blind and purposeless processes. It is appro- priate to do what we can to protect ourselves from bad luck and evil, but if we become victims we can only ac- cept what has happened as inevitable. There is no transcendent meaning to be given to it. Nonetheless, to accept suffering as the result of blind fate, or even to love fate, as Nietzsche would put it, is to give meaning to one's suffering. To see suffering this way is still to exer- cise the contemplative and meaning- giving side of our existence, since to adopt such a view is still to insert our suffering into a larger theory of reali- ty. It gives suffering the meaning of tragedy even while it says that suffer- ing is meaningless. And so the tragic view of life is a real alternative among the various ways that the contempla- tive aspect of our being gives mean- ing to suffering. The Stoic philosophers encapsu- lated their view in saying that we should live life "in agreement with nature."8 By this they variously meant that we should live in accordance with human virtue or with natural law. To be moral was all. This in turn meant that we should seek good things, shun bad things, and be in- different to things that are indiffer- ent. Among the indifferent things is health, since it can be used for good or for bad and so is in itself morally neutral.9 Good things make us morally good _ and bad things make us morally bad, but of itself, health does neither. And so it is with the opposite of health. As Seneca put it, "That which is evil does harm; that which does harm makes a man worse. But pain and poverty do not make a man worse; therefore, they are not evils."'0 Epictetus offers similar advice in paragraphs eight and nine of his Manual: Ask not that events should happen as you will, but let your will be that events should happen as they do, and you shall have peace. Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to the will, unless the will consent. Lameness is a hindrance to the leg, but not to the will. Say this to yourself at each event that happens, for you shall find that though it hinders something else it will not hinder you.11 Epictetus's thought is, first, that those people who accept everything that befalls them in the physical world will live with equanimity, and sec- ond, that illness, lameness, and other forms of suffering are physical events; they affect the body but not the will or moral being of a person. Provided this moral being is kept intact, the person will experience inner freedom and peace. Acceptance of fate, along with a focus on one's inner existence, are the guarantees of a peaceful mode of being. In this conception, suffering is something toward which the victim should remain indifferent. It is nei- ther good nor bad. It is to be given no meaning. The contemplative dimen- sion of our being should not trouble itself with it and should look beyond it toward an eternal and changeless nature conceived as moral and tran- scendent. We can see the influence of Plato's Socrates on this view. The tragic view of life, as articulated by the Stoics, leads to a life that secures our moral being and integrity by withdrawing from our worldly exis- tence. But it is not likely to be useful to us today. While we may view it with admiration, its emphasis on withdrawal ensures that it will not have much appeal to our modern sensibilities. Pain within a Life Project Ithough he owes much to the Stoic philosophers, Nietzsche presents us with a rather different suggestion as to how a positive mean- ing might be given to suffering. He develops it in this typically rhetorical and eloquent passage: You want if possible-and there is no madder "if possible"-to abolish suffering; and we?-it really does seem that we would rather increase it and make it worse than it has ever been! Wellbeing as you under- stand it-that is no goal, that seems to us an end! A state which soon renders man ludicrous and contemptible-which makes it de- sirable that he should perish! The discipline of suffering, of great suf- fering-do you not know that it is this discipline alone which has created every elevation of mankind hitherto? That tension of the soul in misfortune which cultivates its strength, its terror at the sight of great destruction, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, endur- ing, interpreting, exploiting mis- fortune, and whatever of depth, mystery, mask, spirit, cunning and greatness has been bestowed upon it-has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the dis- cipline of great suffering?'2 Nietzsche praises suffering as the means whereby a higher order of hu- manity will evolve. Nietzsche strong- HASTINGS CENTER REPORT 17 September-October 1998</page><page sequence="6">ly disparaged pleasure and comfort as goals of human life. He hated utilitar- ianism, thinking it a doctrine that gave moral worth to the satisfaction of desire for its own sake. Rather, he admired what he saw as the overcom- ing of our human natures by way of it shows that the person fails to ap- preciate the positive power of suffer- ing, and it belittles the object of pity because it represents that person as failing to bear suffering courageously. Pity goes hand in hand with the de- sire for comfort, thought Nietzsche, The challenge of postmodern authenticity is to refuse the false consolations of theodicies or metaphysical theories that make suffering positive. effort and striving. He admired com- mitment and dedication and the will- ingness to put up with hardship and pain in the pursuit of a noble goal and in particular, in the fulfillment of our existential quest for self-affirma- tion and self-assertion. He saw this quest as leading to a newer and better kind of human being. But this being who would overcome mere humanity would not emerge if we focused only on comfort and the avoidance of suf- fering. The avoidance of pain and amelioration of suffering were forces of decadence that led to the softening of the human spirit and a loss of focus upon the task of self-overcom- ing, which was essential to human advancement. Suffering was the cru- cible in which a higher form of hu- manity could be forged. Nietzsche's view is attractive. It is implicitly accepted by nations that define their identity through the suf- fering and sacrifice of their founding fathers or war heroes,13 as Australia does with its annual celebration of a major military defeat on Anzac Day. In at least one respect, too, Nietzsche's view is similar to the view of some Christians, since it embraces suffering as a sacrifice for a higher goal. Indeed, Nietzsche's view might seem noble were it not for his further view about pity. Nietzsche thought that pity be- littles the person who feels it as well as the person who is its object. It be- littles the person who feels it because and should be repudiated on that ac- count. But if the rejection of pity constitutes a rejection of compassion, then Nietzsche should himself be re- pudiated. So understood, Nietzsche comes to seem callous and uncaring. Whether or not we reject Niet- zsche, however, his position is impor- tant for understanding how we con- front suffering. Even if abhorrent, it expresses the attitude to suffering that many people in our culture have. It is yet another theory, created by the contemplative aspect of our being, of how suffering might be made more meaningful. In this theory there is a story of how humanity reaches its highest types and of how suffering is necessary for this to be achieved. In- terestingly, Nietzsche himself would not dispute this framing of his ac- count; he would react to it with irony. It was his view that humanity tells itself a variety of stories in order to make life livable and that his own story is just one of these. None of these creations of contemplative rea- son could be taken as ultimately true, including Nietzsche's own. The reason that Nietzsche's view and its self-deprecating irony finds a ready response in contemporary postmodern thinking is that it rejects overarching theories of providence or human progress. In postmodern thinking there is little scope for contemplative reason. The existential quest for meaning that used to be expressed in the theoretical aspect of our being is still in us, however. In a postmodern culture it is exercised in the "integrative" aspect of our be- ing,14 the aspect in which we engage in the preconscious task of combin- ing the various dimensions of our lives together so as to constitute our wholeness and identity. This can be achieved by faith or commitment. And above all else, Nietzsche might be seen as urging us to live in a com- mitted way. Which ideals and hopes we commit ourselves to does not much matter; they would all be meaning-giving stories anyway. But the key point is that we achieve the integration of our being by infusing every aspect of our existence, includ- ing the bodily, with the enthusiasm for, and commitment to, those of our goals that define our identity. Both our zest for living and our practical tasks would in this way become, along with our very biological being, an expression of our commitment. Our highest ideals would shape the way we live. Our bodies would be in- fused and enlivened by our commit- ments, not just as their vehicle, but as their very expression, for we feel more alive when we are engaged upon an absorbing task. In this way we would overcome the all-too-human desire for comfort and security and extend ourselves both physically and spiritu- ally toward the goal of self-overcom- ing. Our pain, effort, and struggle would then not be meaningless suf- fering since they would not frustrate our whole being. While there might be pain and hardship, our commit- ment and drive for becoming would shape all of them into a single life pro- ject. Our pain and hardship would validate our identity. Whether this way of thinking would allow us to embrace the suffer- ing that is inflicted by disease or acci- dent, the suffering that is not part of our life's plan, is perhaps still doubt- ful. Useless suffering in the face of which we are passive might continue to be meaningless in terms of our life's goals. Or it might be embraced as the test of our mettle, the ultimate 18 HASTINGS CENTER REPORT September-October 1998</page><page sequence="7">ordeal through which our existential faith and commitment might be tested. Whether one is a Christian who sees suffering as part of God's salvific plan for humanity, or a hu- manist who thinks that suffering grounds the possibility of ethics through compassion, or a Stoic who maintains an indifference to suffer- ing as something morally irrelevant, or a Nietzschean who holds that suf- fering ennobles the human spirit and makes possible human advancement and personal self-validation, the per- ennial and inescapable question of the one who suffers is, Why me? But rather than seek an answer to that question, we should ask, in the spirit of Nietzsche, why we want an answer to it. The challenge of postmodern authenticity is to sever the link be- tween suffering and justice. It is to accept the blindness of fate and the inevitability of bad luck. It is to refuse the false consolations of theo- dicies or metaphysical theories that make suffering positive. Suffering is to be borne. There is nothing more to it. The only question remaining about this way of thinking would be whether it could give rise to compas- sion for the suffering of others. That is, even if we reject the ancient and Christian attempts to accept suffer- ing, we should try to incorporate some part of Levinas's humanistic in- sight. And this seems possible. Inso- far as suffering is borne, it opens us to the suffering of others. Indeed, at- tempts to make suffering good blind us to the reality of our and of others' suffering by allowing us to view it as something that ought to happen or that ought to be accepted. Cruelty and insensitivity lie down this path. The tragic bearing of suffering, on the other hand, awakens us to its real- ity. If neither the gods, the cosmos, providence, nor a faith in human progress rob suffering of its tragedy, then we are left just with the brute fact that we and others suffer. And in this there is community. Our own suffering awakens us to what the other is going through and thus cre- ates in us the compassion through which relieving actions can be moti- vated. In this community of suffer- ing, a meaning might yet be found for our own suffering. Perhaps all the meaning that suffering can have is that it teaches us to care for others. References 1. Eric J.
