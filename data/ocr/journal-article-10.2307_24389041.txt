<plain_text><page sequence="1">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison by Joshua M. Hall I've put together new steps in the breakaway by slipping and almost falling. I was always looking for anyone dancing in the street or just walking and doing anything that suggests a step. If I could see it, I could do it. —Shorty Snowden, Savoy dancer The present essay has developed from an affirmation of two widely acknowledged tropes in Ellison s thought and an extension of both in the pervasive presence of dance in the author's fiction, non-fiction, and life.1 The first trope could probably be captured by the title of one of Elli son's essays, "The Novel as a Function of American Democracy," if one were to add to "Function" the modifier "Moral-Educational." The second is that of the (particularly bebop-era) jazz jam session as figurative con densation of this democracy. This latter idea is strengthened significantly by Ellison's education for and career as a trumpeter. The first and lon gest section of this essay, then, is an attempt to wed the two tropes — the novel as ameliorating methodology and jazz improvisation as regulative ideal — through a phenomenological exploration of the ubiquity of dance and its near-coextension with music in the author-trumpeter's life and masterpiece novel. These analyses open the possibility that, given music's intimate connection to dance for Ellison and the prominence of dance language and imagery in the novel, jazz dance could function as well as, if not better than, jazz music as Ellison's regulative ideal for the U.S. novel as "ethical instrument" of "agonistic co-operation" (Ellison, Col lected 99,188).

All rights reserved. 57</page><page sequence="2">58 Southern Literaryjournal Secondly, in the wake of this exploration, I will gesture briefly toward a reading of the novel as a whole. In essence, I will consider Invisible Man as a kind of "public jazz dance" wherein each chapter constitutes a dif ferent "song" (each with its own corresponding dance) and features its own different primary characters or "dance soloists." The performances of the soloists, in turn, can be understood as attempts at a kind of multi leveled syncopation. Based on Lucius Outlaw, Jr.'s contention that the movements of individual characters in the novel can be read as symbol izing the movements of various communities (or typical figures in a com munity), one could justifiably claim that Invisible Man is centrally con cerned with the movements of syncopated communities. By implication, the protagonist's central attribute will appear, not as invisibility, but as arrhythmia. Ralph Ellison loved to dance, even as far back as toddlerhood: "Either his father or mother was responsible for 'the first song ever taught me as a two-year old' ('Dark Brown, Chocolate to the Bone'), as well as for his command of a wildly popular, risque dance to go with it, the Eagle Rock" (Rampersad 6). This dance, according to prominent dance historian Marshall Stearns—-to whose students Ellison once gave a for mal address — is a typical example of U.S. American jazz (or vernacular) dance (xiv): The Eagle Rock was named after the Eagle Rock Baptist Church in Kansas City, according to Wilburn Sweatman: "They were famous for dancing it during religious services in the years following the Civil War." The dance may well have been much older, but ... it has the high arm gestures associated with evangelical dances and religious trance. (Stearns 26-27) By the time he was in grade school, Ellison apparently possessed talent in addition to his enthusiasm, because during "a second-grade class pre sentation," Zelia N. Page Breaux, superintendent of music for the city's black schools, "noticed Ralph's intensity as he sang and danced to a nurs ery song" (Rampersad 26). On the basis of this performance, Breaux "made him a major part of her curriculum," and later, "invited him to first join and ultimately lead his high school band" (26). Along with music, Breaux's curriculum also included a significant dance component, as indicated by Ellison's remark that "European fold dances were taught throughout the Negro school system" (Ellison, Collected 198). Crucial for the entirety of Ellison's life's work, Breaux also "taught him to think of himself as an artist" (Rampersad 26).</page><page sequence="3">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 59 Dance, especially dances derived from, complementary to, and/or cre ative of jazz music—hereafter, jazz dance—was clearly vital to Ellison's development as a person and as an artist. Along with Mrs. Breaux's more formal music and dance, as well as the sacred music at church, Ellison asserts that jazz "and the public jazz dance was a third institution in our lives, and a vital one" (Ellison, Collected 28). Ellison also wrote later of his peers' ambition to be, among other things, "experts and tireless part ners of the race horse-gaited girls at public dances" (32). On a more intel lectual note, Ellison reminisces about "the wild, transcendent moments which occurred at dances or 'battles of music' ... in which memorable improvisations were ignited" and describes himself as "claimed by" a variety of community practices including "public dances and jam ses sions" (198, 200-201). Note in both cases the immediate syntactical prox imity of improvisational music and dance. Ellison also rhapsodizes poeti cally of the "big dance" in which a young trumpeter like himself can send the crowd into "an ecstasy of rhythm and memory and brassy affirmation of the goodness of being alive and part of the community" (Ellison, Col lected 232). I will return to the issue of community and communion at the end of this investigation. Ellison's love for the public jazz dances also got him into at least one significant predicament. His family's longtime friend, Dr. Slaughter, refused to allow a broke and desperate Ellison to drive with Slaughter's wife and daughter to Tuskegee Institute [at the time] largely because he claimed Ellison had "been observed indulging in such obscene couplings as the belly-rub, the hellish jelly-shake, the slow-drag, and the one butt shuffle . . . with strange black gals in countless numbers!" (Rampersad 48). As a result of this refusal in the context of the Ellison family's finan cial straits, Ellison was forced to turn hobo —a harrowing experience which furnished the raw material for his first short stories several years later (49-51). During college, Ellison "earned a little cash playing in a band for private dances in some of the larger towns near Tuskegee" (Rampersad 56). His last public trumpet performance, at age twenty-five, was in an orchestra commissioned by a composer friend to play "ballet music for the dancer Anna Sokolow" (109). That same month he met the woman who was to become his first wife, Rose Poindexter. She was not only a dancer, but a professional dancer, "a popular entertainer," who "had gone to Europe as a teenage singer and dancer" (109). The newly married Ellisons soon served as witnesses to the marriage of Ellison's close friend Richard Wright, who followed Ellison in choosing a professional dancer</page><page sequence="4">6o Southern Literaryjournal for his wife, "a tall, commanding dancer of Russian Jewish ancestry who sometimes passed herself off as Egyptian" (126). The first time that music is thematized in Invisible Man, in the "Pref ace," it is explicitly linked to the body. The protagonist of the novel (to whom I will refer as "Invisible") expresses a desire to "to have five" pho nographs with which to listen to Louis Armstrong simultaneously (8). He may have intended the number five to suggest the five senses, given the following syn£esthetic passage: "There is a certain acoustical dead ness in my hole, and when I have music I want to feel its vibration, not only with my ear but with my whole body" (8). Apparently, the protago nist of the novel is not only visually unavailable, he's almost completely audibly unavailable. Invisible then rhapsodizes about the way Louis Armstrong's jazz trumpet style "bends that military instrument into a beam of lyrical sound" (8). Sound, unlike light, is not normally described as occurring in "beams." Both have the structure of waves, but light can appear as something with the length and width of a physical beam, say of wood. If Ellison is using "beam" metaphorically, and if one understands the noun "beam" as "a beam of wood," then Ellison is taking sound from its ordi nary physicality as audible vibrations in the air to a metaphorical tangi bility as a solid object. Invisible further clarifies his audible impairment by noting that invis ibility "gives one a slightly different sense of time, you're never quite on the beat. Sometimes you're ahead and sometimes behind" (8). This is basically the definition of the musical term "syncopation," one of the most pervasive elements of African-based musical traditions, and one taken up productively by music theorist Jay Rahn. Invisible's analysis of this lived-syncopation continues as follows: "Instead of the swift and imperceptible flowing of time, you are aware of its nodes, those points where time stands still or from which it leaps ahead. And you slip into the breaks and look around" (8). Here the invisible man bodily enters the auditory space of the music, creating a conceptual site for a privileging of the body in African American musical experience. To illustrate this conception, Invisible then describes "a prizefighter boxing a yokel," char acterizing the prizefighter's body as "one violent flow of rapid rhythmic action" (8). This usage is indicative of the fact that boxing is the tradi tional sport most often described in the language of dance, probably due to the intricate footwork and relative movements of the fighters involved in skillful fighting. The word "flow" is also often used in descriptions</page><page sequence="5">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 61 of dance due to the fluidity of movement characteristic of harmonious embodiment, and rhythm is obviously connected to dance. The point of this narrative is that the prizefighter is ultimately knocked out cold by his "yokel" opponent, due entirely to the latter's successfully having "stepped inside of his opponent's sense of time." This "stepping inside" then serves as Invisible's metaphor for the way he discovers "a new analytical way of listening to music. The unheard sounds came through, and each melodic line existed of itself, stood out clearly from all the rest, said its piece, and waited patiently for the other voices to speak" (8-9). Invisible then deepens the description provocatively by describing him self as "hearing not only in time, but in space as well" (9). Thus, the first appearance of music in Invisible Man leads quickly, by invocation of the body, to the first appearance of dance. This appearance takes the form of an illustration of improvisation, which in turn is used to develop a metaphorically-expanded conception of syncopation. Chapter One also gets underway primarily by way of a layering of dances, organized around a "battle royal" boxing match with a group of schoolmates for the entertainment of a group of prominent white towns men. Before the fight begins, "[a] clarinet was vibrating sensuously," with Invisible and his fellow boxers' "bare upper bodies touching and shining with anticipatory sweat"-—an erotically charged moment. The syntax of the first phrase—which makes the clarinet (and not the clarinetist) the subject of the sentence and the verb a description of the physical mechan ics (and not the phenomenological experience) of sound—suggests read ing the clarinet figuratively as itself moving sensuously, like a dancer. The clarinet also sets the scene for the appearance in the room of a "magnifi cent blonde—stark naked," with a "small American flag tattooed on her belly" (19). Invisible exhibits a strongly mixed reaction of, desire and dis gust for the woman, and this mixed reaction will reappear in other sensual encounters throughout the novel—including Invisible's affair with one of the Brotherhood wives and his reaction to the Sambo doll performance: And then she began to dance, a slow sensuous movement; the smoke of a hundred cigars clinging to her like the thinnest of veils. She seemed like a fair bird-girl girdled in veils calling to me from the angry surface of some gray and threatening sea. I was trans ported. Then I became aware of the clarinet playing. (19) The image of the veil is, of course, a prominent one in African Ameri can writing, most famously in its role as the image of Du Bois's double</page><page sequence="6">62 Southern Literaryjournal consciousness, although it is unclear in this case whether the veil hides the white woman, the white men watching, and/or the black men about to fight. This image of the veil appears eight more times during the novel, including an allusion to the famous statue of Booker T. Washington lift ing or "lowering] more firmly in place" the veil of ignorance (36). This dance also foreshadows several later passages in the novel in which Invis ible is (a) accused of equating freedom in the North with dancing with a white woman (153), (b) locked in a kind of inadvertent jam-packed subway train slow dance with a white woman (158), and (c) ultimately a dance partner of an alluring white woman at a meeting of the Brother hood (314-315). Just as the first appearance of dance in the Prologue pre figured the battle royal scene, the second appearance of dance in Chapter One prefigures three more kinds of dances scattered throughout the rest of the novel. Thus, one can observe already in Chapter One how dance functions as a unifying narrative motif for the novel. Shortly after the "And then she began to dance" passage, Invisible observes one of the young men having an erection in response to the blonde's dance call, which he claims appears "as though in answer to the insinuating low-registered moaning of the clarinet" (20). In other words, one of the young men is aroused as though by the clarinet pre sumably because the arousing blonde is dancing to the music of the clari net. Ellison thus explicitly anthropomorphizes the first dancing trope of the chapter (the clarinet, already potentially a phallic symbol) into a met aphor for the second dancing trope (the blonde). Therefore, the clarinet, which has already become a kind of dancer, now functions as a metaphor or symbol of the actual dancing blonde, insofar as Invisible describes the clarinet as provoking the erection. As the first human dance of the chapter begins with a chaotic persecu tion from the respected white men, the next one begins as Invisible and nine other young men enter the ring and are "blindfolded with broad bands of white cloth" then forced into a haphazard war of each against all (21). "Blindfolded," Invisible relates, "I could no longer control my motions" (22). And yet, just after this comment, he finds himself, despite the blindfold, somehow able to "see the black, sweat-washed forms weav ing in the smoky-blue atmosphere like drunken dancers weaving to the rapid drum-like thuds of blows" (23). In even this chaotic event , Invisible sees something sufficiently like boxing-as-dancing to merit the use of the modifier "weaving" to describe it. With the battle royal descending into greater and greater chaos, the dancing goes from serving as a metaphor to a literal description. First,</page><page sequence="7">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 63 Invisible takes a "blow to [his] head as [he] danced about" (25). He is dancing then, but not skillfully, as he loses the fight. Invisible is thus unlike the yokel from the Prologue whose syncopated dancing allows him to take down the prizefighter. In this case — as in so many dances and "dances" to follow throughout the novel—it is Invisible who is taken out in his first display of arrhythmia. Put differently, Invisible's lack of skill in the rhythmic sport of boxing causes him to be ultimately defeated in the battle royal. And this defeat takes place against the backdrop of the syncopated effectiveness of the sensuous black clarinet and sensuous white dancer. After the fight is over, the white men encourage the young black men to collect their prize money that has been scattered on an electrified rug, the "hot, violent force" of which cause another young man to "liter ally dance upon his back" (27). This image reappears almost identically in Invisible's first experience of electroshock therapy in the factory hos pital which his doctors amusedly describe as dancing. Despite seeing the other man electrocuted, Invisible nevertheless continues collecting as much money as he can, "discovering] I could contain the electric ity—a contradiction, but it works" (27). One could read this conception of "containing the electricity" as a metaphor for black Americans' cre ative improvisation in the face of racial oppression; it is also arguably a truthful phenomenological account of the experience of passionate jazz dancing. To dance well to jazz music, one must be sufficiently energized by the music to dance in a way which is both emotionally expressive and enjoyable, while nevertheless sufficiently disciplined or self-controlled to execute complex movements accurately in a visually appealing way. Thus one must channel or "contain the electricity" of the physical and psy chological energy in order to dance well. The fact that this conception of containing electricity works well in both cases supports Ellison's account of black Americans' proclivity for expressive dance, to which we will return below. Also significant in the account of the battle royal, one of the white men in the crowd calls Invisible "Sambo" (26). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word is a racial slur originally referring to persons of mixed Negro and Amerindian or Asian, or half-mulatto/half-Negro persons, individuals with the kind of hybrid and complex ancestry which, for Ellison, is an essential part of "the complex and plural wholeness" that makes up the "Americanness" of the United States (504). "Sambo" is also the name of a specific species of monkey, which calls to mind Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s work on the Signifyin(g) Monkey trickster figure</page><page sequence="8">64 Southern Literaryjournal in Afro-American literature. Gates notes that the Yoruba god Esu — of which Gates claims the Signifying Monkey is a kind of avatar—"is also a highly accomplished dancer, a mask-in-motion, who signifies in ritual by his phallic dance of generation, of creation, of translation" (Gates xxi, 20). Aside from its meaning as a racist epithet, Sambo is also the name of the type of dancing doll centrally important near the end of the novel. This earlier use would seem to suggest that Invisible, like the Sambo doll, is here a puppet for the whites' amusement, and merely appears to move independently of the thin black thread by which it is manipulated. Fur ther, this first use of this word marks the first time in the entire novel that another person uses a proper name to address the protagonist—'"That's right, Sambo,' a blond man said, winking at me confidentially" (26). In other words, the protagonist is first named as a dancer. Only a few pages after its last reference to dance, Chapter One ends. Chapter Two begins with a description of the black college, the second sentence of which utilizes the dance language of "the roads gracefully winding, lined with hedges and wild roses that dazzled the eyes in the summer sun" (34). Again, the syntax of the clause makes "the roads" into the grammatical subject—the road "winds" instead of being "a winding road" — and the inclusion of the adverb "gracefully" enhances the road's anthropomorphism. The dancing grammatical subject is also the the matic backdrop of the entire chapter, in which Invisible drives a wealthy benefactor down the wrong roads — i.e., roads leading to the poorest areas on the outskirts of the college town. Here reside the social rejects who are the perennial shame of the college. In this way, at least from the perspective of the president of the college, Dr. Bledsoe, Invisible moves entirely grace-/e.w-ly through the community and through the chapter. As a result of this second insensitivity to syncopation in the story, this time vis-a-vis a black college community, Invisible ends up exiled to New York City where various other dances lie in store for him. When the opening description of the chapter turns from the landscape to the human inhabitants of the campus, it begins with "how the girls in bright summer dresses promenaded the grassy lawn" (20). "Promenade" is a word with multiple dance-meanings, including one particular step in ballet and another in ballroom, and it is the longer version of the word "prom." In each case it indicates a stately procession. (A similar dance like parade appears much later in the novel in the elaborate funeral pro cession for Clifton following the adventure of the Sambo doll. In both events, the individuals in the promenade constitute a kind of graceful road of humanity).</page><page sequence="9">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 65 The language of dance returns in Invisible's first description of one of the main characters in this chapter: the philanthropist Mr. Norton. Invisible notes that Norton's "manner was aristocratic, his movements dapper and suave," thus again emphasizing as central to an entity the aes thetic dimensions of his/her/its movements (38). Until the encounter with Trueblood, which again is only made possible by Invisible's bungling tour-guiding, Norton appears completely in sync with the rhythms of the college community. He knows his place in it, he is proud of his con tributions, and he moves along its graceful roads like a king in his limou sine in a parade through his kingdom. Norton's encounter with the col lege's underworld, however, reveals that he is not truly able to improvise, to cope with the syncopation of the underside of the college community. This invisibility becomes obvious when their car takes an opportunity to itself improvise, i.e., break down, at which point Invisible says, "Waves of heat danced above the engine hood" (41). In the encounter with True blood that follows, Norton loses almost all capacity for speech or mean ingful human interaction; the dance with Trueblood is one he cannot dance, and one which forces him almost completely off the dance floor for the rest of the novel. In the aftermath of this breakdown, in Bled soe's speech to Invisible about his arrhythmic chauffeuring (i.e., driving Mr. Norton to the wrong parts of the community) we find that it is, on the contrary, the improvisations of Bledsoe that make possible Norton's delusion of himself being in rhythm. It is this performance by Bledsoe that allows the school to remain funded, and therefore to exist at all. And since Invisible's arrhythmic behavior has so jeopardized the college com munity, that behavior becomes the grounds for his permanent expulsion from the school. As with Chapter Two, Chapter Three also begins with dancing. In this case, it is the dancing of the mental patient who believes himself to be a drum major "strutting in front" of the rest. And again the danc ing, "energetically in long, hip-swinging strides ... as though in time to music," is the first part of the description (71). The comparison to the drummer suggests the domain of big band music, thus swing, thus jazz, reinforced by the reference to the patient's hips, which literally "swing." After Invisible arrives at the Golden Day bar with an unconscious Nor ton, another mental patient and trained physician remarks that Mr. Nor ton's pulse, like the clarinet in Chapter One, "vibrates!" And when chaos descends upon the bar, all the other drunk patients are "whirling] like maniacs," which brings to mind the whirling dervishes of Sufi mysticism, an internationally-known trope for dance (78, 85). Crazy as it might look</page><page sequence="10">66 Southern Literaryjournal from the outside, the mental patients are syncopating perfectly with the unusual rhythms of the Golden Day. As usual, it is rather Invisible and his white burden (Norton) who threaten the rhythmic integrity of the scene. There are many other examples of this peppering of dance language in the novel. But with the pervasiveness of dance in Invisible Man estab lished, I will now conclude the close reading of the novel with the last significant appearance of dance in the novel. Chapter Twenty's primary narrative is that of the Sambo doll, a "grinning doll of orange-and-black tissue paper" moving "in a loose-jointed, shoulder-shaking, infuriat ingly sensuous motion, a dance that was completely detached from the black mask-like face . . . dancing as though it received a perverse pleasure from its motions" (431). (The word "detached" had been applied earlier to describe the blonde dancer's expression during her dance). As before in the case of the blond dancer, Invisible has a mixed reaction to the danc ing doll, a "desire to join in the laughter" in tension with a desire "to leap upon it with both feet" (432). After the formal dance performance, while being assaulted by the police officers, Clifton (the charismatic for mer Brotherhood member-turned-Sambo-operator) gives a brief, infor mal dance, spinning "on his toes like a dancer," before ultimately being killed (436). In the aftermath of the funeral, Invisible stumbles upon the Sambo again, lying in the street, and in attempting to determine exactly how it danced, he makes an interesting discovery: Then I saw a fine black thread and pulled it from the frilled paper. There was a loop tied at the end. I slipped it over my finger and stood stretching it taut. And this time it danced. Clifton had been making it dance all the time and the black thread had been invis ible. (446) The doll, the hypostasized figure of blackness, had only appeared to dance independently of its controller. And the clue to the charade had been extremely subtle: only a fine black thread described with the same word that gives the novel its title and the protagonist his most famous attribute. As in so many other cases, beneath the misappropriated, rei fied figures of blackness produced for whites' entertainment lay complex, living traditions. Having examined various passages in depth, including every occur rence of dance language and imagery in the first three chapters, I will now attempt a more global reading of Invisible Man based on the patterns that emerge there. First, dancing elements are part of the scene-setting</page><page sequence="11">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 67 of each chapter discussed here, and these elements are almost always in some way non-human forms of dancing: a clarinet, the roads of Tuske gee, and an imaginary drum major routine, respectively. The second instance of dancing in each chapter, by contrast, always involves a human element: the boxers fighting, girls strolling across the lawns, and Norton's pulse vibrating. Finally, the third dancing element in each chapter tends to focus on the primary character(s) of the chapter: the blonde dancer and Invisible-called-Sambo, Mr. Norton's aristocratic movements, and the whirling mental patients at the Golden Day. In the light of these patterns, we may understand the structure of the novel in terms of an elaborate choreography by Ellison, or more appro priately, as a band's set list for playing a public dance. Each chapter may be read as a different type of song that corresponds to a specific kind of dance; each dancing entity is a dancer on the floor for that dance (and some dancers dance multiple songs); and each primary character is the best dancer in the house (with regard to that chapter's dance) for whom the other dancers ultimately clear the floor in order to make room for the soloists' improvisation (or lack thereof). In this reading, the Prologue and Epilogue are the opening and clos ing dances of the novel, and both are performed to songs by Louis Arm strong. Both of these dances also, as we will observe in detail below, thematize the issue of syncopation in jazz dance which is performed throughout the rest of the novel. Chapter One is a dance of sensuous desire in its most concrete form, at which the blond is adept and Invis ible is clueless. Chapter Two is a dance of the conflict between the desires of the individual (Norton) and the community (the school), as well as between the white majority (the world outside the school) and the black minority. Here, Invisible and Norton are the comically inept "squares" ruining their solos. And Chapter Three is a dance of the disenfranchised, micro-minority (the mental patients) cast out by their own black minor ity (the school) to buttress its respectability. Yet despite their alleged dys function, the vets manage to signify hilariously on Invisible, Norton, Supercargo, their own situation, and pretty much the whole world — a "vast and complicated game . . . whose goal was laughter and whose rules and subtleties" Invisible admits he "could never grasp" (74). My reading of Invisible Man can also be formulated in terms of music theory, as the first dance elements in each chapter could be understood as symbolizing the foundational rhythm or deep structure of the chap ter against which the other dancers are supposed to signify or improvise. For this analysis, we draw again on Rahn's account of syncopation. As</page><page sequence="12">68 Southern Literaryjournal a concept in European music theory, syncopation was conceived against the backdrop of the regularity of basic metrical intervals with a fixed pat tern of stressed and unstressed beats, such as the four quarter-note beats of 4/4 time, in which the first and third quarter-note beats of the measure get the emphasis, are more likely to receive stressed syllables in the lyrics, and more often contain the beginnings of new chords. In this context, "to syncopate" means to begin a note before or after one of the stronger beats in the measure and then hold that note into and throughout the following stronger beat. In traditional European-derived music theory, syncopation gets under stood as involving "a deviation from the 'normal' placement of an accent" and as a "displacement" in which "an accent that belongs on a particu lar strong beat is displaced to a weak one . . . displaced from where it belongs" (Temperley 20). Thus, the metrical structure is literally a white European framework into which the addition of African-derived rhythms with a different basis is experienced as a tension-producing distortion from the norm. In addition to criticizing the general musical validity of this standard understanding of syncopation, Rahn also brings in issues of embodiment and cultural context, as in the following passage: [An African rhythm] can be considered to comprise a fully concrete motor rhythm that results not just from motions corresponding to the sounds actually heard but also from motions, unheard but felt by performers, which occur between these sounds and which com plete or complement the rhythm actually heard. (83) Consequently, Rahn suggests incorporating "something like the Effort values of Labanotation" — the standard system of dance notation in use in Western dance—into musical analysis. In short, then, Rahn is calling for dance analysis to complete music analysis. Every sound requires a non-sound that produced it; every heard sound implies a bodily feeling that produced it. Rahn later uses the concrete example of "off-beat clapping," in which "every clap of hands that is heard implies a pair of hands unclapped and unheard" (85). It is worth noting at this point that clapping, like other aspects of dance — espe cially the step of jazz-dancing tappers — is itself also a kind of music making, in this case percussion. And in the singular ways in which the metrically regular (4/4 time) clapping interacts with traditional African rhythms such as the "clave," Rahn finds something analogous to "danc ers turning alternatively left and right, within a larger, counter-clockwise circling" Rahn calls this "turning the beat around . . . toroidally" (85)</page><page sequence="13">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 69 "Toroidally" refers to the "toroid" shape, the most common of which is the doughnut. Put very simply, a "torus" is what results when the two dimensional motion that creates a circle is raised to the second power and results in a three dimensional entity; it is the movement whereby cycles of musical rhythms "crosscut, intensify, subdivide, or multiply each other" whereby sound creates its own embodiment: the incorporation of motions whereby music becomes dance (85). Returning to Ellison, we can see how these musicological analyses support a move from literal syncopation to the metaphorical syncopation of individuals and communities as represented in Invisible Man. Synco pation on this model also applies to, for example, what the patients do in the destabilized Golden Day. They move in ways that are surprising and creative given the kinds of movements accepted as normal and reg ular in the white-dominant milieu in which they find themselves. And in their successful syncopation of the basic dance rhythms of their envi ronments, these figures symbolize the endurance of black communities in the United States, entire communities syncopated relative to the met rical norms of the white American majority. In other words, in order to survive, the black communities have had (and continue to have) to find the corporeal spaces between the notes in the basic metrical pattern of white America. They have to be just ahead of the beat, to inhabit the silent spaces in between the sounds; and the results of this persecution born improvisation are often beautiful, as in the literal syncopation of jazz music and dance. In contrast to these successfully syncopating figures in the novel, other characters such as Mr. Norton, and especially Invisible, demonstrate the results of failing to improvise, of trying to abide completely by the domi nant metrical structure of the environment, failing to detect and respond to the improvisation of the other dancers in the environment. And unlike Norton, Invisible as a black man should know better, at least according to various figures such as Bledsoe and Peter Wheatstraw. The protago nist therefore has little excuse for the metaphorical arrhythmia —"not having rhythm," being perpetually "out of step" or "off the beat" — that plagues his entire journey through the successive dances of the novel-as public-dance. And on the rare occasions when Invisible does appear to be successfully "syncopating," the appearance is usually merely the result of luck or accident. To take one example, it is only the drug high that finally allows him, after all the action of the novel's timeline has passed, to truly hear Louis Armstrong, to "slip into the breaks" of the music "and look around" (8).</page><page sequence="14">yo Southern Literaryjournal To successfully do so, Invisible has to cut the thread that has kept him a Sambo puppet and begin to move on his own—which is exactly what he seems to be starting to do in the Epilogue. The reader leaves him again speaking of Armstrong, this time without needing the assistance of marijuana, and speaking entirely positively for the first time in the entire novel about his own dancing. What is the relationship of the concept of dance to the concept of music as an interpretive tool in understanding Ellison? Significantly, most dance requires music, and jazz dance in particular requires jazz music. Thus, an analysis focusing on dance obviously requires an account of music to be complete, whereas it is generally considered permissible to leave out dance when considering music by itself. The trope of dance, with its obvious emphasis on embodiment complements and enhances the concept of music as an interpretive tool for Ellison's novel by forging another connection between Ellison's aesthetics and his politics. In his essay, "Remembering Jimmy" Ellison himself comments on the insepa rability of jazz music and dance: the dancers — and the musicians — achieved that feeling of com munion which was the true meaning of the public jazz dance. The blues, the singer, the band and the dancers formed the vital whole of jazz as an institutional art form, and even today neither part is quite complete without the rest. The thinness of much so-called "modern jazz" is especially reflective of this loss of wholeness, and it is quite possible that Rushing retains his vitality simply because he has kept close to the small Negro public dance. (275-276) Note the word "communion," marked as the "true meaning" of the public jazz dance, which seems a stronger concept than those Ellison usually employs elsewhere, as in "The Little Man at Chehaw Station," to describe "that feeling of communion" as reflected in jazz (507). "Commu nion" also seems better-suited to evoke "the mysteries and pathologies of the democratic process" than the language of group membership, or links in the chain used in his most famous expression of jazz-as-democracy (507, 266-267). In support of this point, it seems critical here for Ellison that the dance is public.2 For Ellison, without the essentially public com munal component of dancing, jazz is never complete.</page><page sequence="15">Syncopated Communities: Dancing with Ellison 71 NOTES 1. ror an important related account or the importance or this kind or dancing dexterity in an African-American context, see Houston Baker's Blues, Ideology and Afro-American Literature (Chicago: Chicago UP, 1987). 2.
