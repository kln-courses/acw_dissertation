Almost every sphere of our life has been affected by science to such an extent that we have developed a mistrust of all that is not part of science. Scientific spirit has come to characterise and almost determine our mental attitudes. Thanks to this overwhelming influence of science, it was natural for the modern man to judge the validity of all that he considers true against the touchstone of science. More recently, the word scientific has become a blanket term to denote accuracy and correctness. Unconsciously (and at times even consciously) the adjective scientific is equated with true and perhaps the only true. Today, more than ever, a great many scholars and theists are desperately striving to adapt religion to the advancements and discoveries of science. Scholars belonging to different religions are taking great pride in flaunting the so-called scientific character of their respective religions, not realising that science itself is much given to change and revision. In this apologetic attitude there is a tacit acknowledgement that truth is an exclusive monopoly of science and anything not confirmed by the empirical investigation of science is bound to be untrue. We are hardly aware that this attitude is not doing any service to religion and, more precisely, by vindicating religion through science we are not providing religion very strong bases to rest on. This paper seeks to work out answers to questions such as the following: How much, if any, of the current scientific lore constitutes knowledge? What is the extent to which scientific method can effectively reach? Are there matters that science is not competent to deal with? This paper will demonstrate that science, by nature, is falsifiable and amenable to change whereas religion is not given to these changes. The study also proposes to demonstrate that science is not without its inherent limitations and inner contradictions and much of science itself is based upon relativities and contingencies, and that any attempt to make religion conformable to science or vice versa does good neither to science nor to religion. ?t&gt;&gt;</page><page sequence="2">512 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI Introduction: The Scientific Factor Herbert Butterfield, an eminent Cambridge historian, once said that the Scientific Revolution reduced the Renaissance and the Reformation "to the rank of mere episodes," and that it marked "the real origin both of the modern world and of the modern mentality.5,1 Given the overwhelming importance of science and the scientific worldview obtaining in the modern world it is easy to see what he meant. Today science figures very prominently in our everyday discourse and has come to pervade the entire fabric of human existence. From mythic and ritualistic beginnings, it has developed into one of the greatest and most influential fields of human endeavour. Numerous branches of science investigate almost everything "from China to Peru;"2 and science as a whole shapes the way we understand the universe, our planet, ourselves, and other living things. Organized empirical science provides the most impressive result of human rationality3 and the Scientific Revolution of our time took the world by surprise and relegated all that was unscientific to the realm of skepticism and superstition. This onslaught of science tended to equate religious teachings with false fears and ornamentations of life of no intellectual value. Thanks to this pervading awe of science, religion began to be perceived as a way of responding psychologically to pressures in society. Belief in miracles, and in fact belief in whatever is supernatural was considered to belong to the domain of fantasy. Two factors, in particular, intensified confrontation between science and religion. The first of these was the Industrial Revolution. Never has science been as pervasive and influential as it has been since the Industrial Revolution. David Burnie says: For a large part of recorded history, science had little bearing on people's everyday lives. Scientific knowledge was gathered for its own sake, and it had few practical applications. However, with the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, this rapidly changed. Today, science has a profound effect on the way we live, largely through technology ? the use of scientific knowledge for practical purposes.4 1 "Scientific Revolution" in Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia, at: &lt;http://encarta.msn. com&gt; (1997-2009). 2 From Samuel Johnson's poem "Vanity of Human Wishes" (1749 edition by Jack Lynch), available at Web site: &lt;http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/-jlynch/Texts/ vanity49.html&gt;.

In this book the origin of humanity, crucially attributed to an omnipotent Creator, was explained by scientific principles according to the theory of evolution, where only those species survive that best fit the environment. The weak and defenceless are weeded out in this relentless process of Natural Selection. However, the content of this book is not our immediate topic, so we will revert to our main discussion. A Fundamental Difference Man has a profound and natural urge to march with the tide of time and at no stage of life does he like to be out of tune with time knowingly. There are, of course, periods of regression and fatigue but they are more of an exception than rule and as a whole the march of life is onward and progressive. Muhammad Iqbal makes this point in his Saql Namah: f * / f J q&amp; fjf &amp;~&gt; &amp;- ?Jt j* r &lt;r* *J**J r ^ J* I &amp;J %fj? %f t %f The sea of life has its ebb and flow-, In every atom's heart is the pulse of life; It manifests itself in the body, As a flame conceals a wave of smoke; Contact with the earth was harsh for it, But it liked the labour; It is in motion, and not in motion; Tired of the elements' shackles.5 This urge to be modern (and in our time postmodern) gives us a sense of relevance. But in the face of this desire of relevance we are likely to lose the sight of certain institutions whose very merit lies in the fact that they are 5 Muhammad Iqbal, Kulliyat-i Iqbal&gt; tr. Naeem Siddiqui (Karachi: Sheikh Ghulam Ali &amp; Sons, 1986), 453.</page><page sequence="4">514 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI perennial and timeless such as religion, law and morality. We are likely to forget that fundamental values and teachings propounded by these institutions are always relevant to our life and that the change of time cannot render them obsolete. Science may pass through countless vicissitudes of time and undergo a variety of experiences, possibly being clothed in every age in new garbs, but these institutions are not affected by these scientific discoveries because they address the essential and timeless nature of human existence. The propositions of morality or the teachings and beliefs of religion do not affect by the changes which have so frequently come to characterize science ("Love thy neighbour" by Jesus and "Even a smile in the face of your brother is a charity" by Muhammad (pece be on him) are two cases in point as scientific discoveries of entire history have done little to falsify them). Khalifa Abdul Hakim, a prominent scholar of Pakistan and the founder of the Institute of Islamic Culture, Lahore (d. 1957), for instance, stresses the timeless relevance of morality and religion: Can the essentials of morality be successfully contradicted even by the apparent relativity of morals and manners? Can it ever become irrational to believe that the gradations of existence extend above the material, vital the mental level? Can it ever be demonstrated that the soul is a product and an attribute of the body and perishes with it? Can it ever be demonstrated that our spatial and temporal existence is co-extensive with entire being?6 The question arises: why science as such with all its astonishing discoveries and inventions cannot invalidate the propositions and tenets of religion? The answer lies in understanding a crucial difference between not only the essential nature of science and religion but also their function. First, let us consider science: what exactly is science? How can we characterize it? What are the necessary conditions for a given theory to be considered scientific? All this is far from easy to say and many conditions have been proposed as essential to science. According to Jacques Monod, "The cornerstone of the scientific method is the postulate that nature is objective... In other words, the systematic denial that 'true' knowledge can be got by interpreting nature in terms of final causes ..."7 In the 1930s, the eminent German chemist Walther Nernst claimed that science, by definition, requires an infinite universe; hence the Big Bang theory, he said, is not science.8 Science shows the present and apparent actuality and operations of 6 Khalifa Abdul Hakim, Islamic Ideology (Lahore: Institute of Islamic Culture, 1994), xiii-xiv. 7 Jacques Monod, Chance and Necessity (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971), 21. 8C.F. von Weizsacker, The Relevance of Science (New York: Harper and Row, 1964), 151.</page><page sequence="5">FALSIFIABILITY OF SCIENCE AND THE TRANSCENDENTALISM OF RELIGION 515 phenomena which exhibit regularities of behaviour and these regularities enable a scientist to predict different effects also and this too with no degree of finality. To a scientist only the empirical and inductive reasoning yields genuine knowledge. Thus primarily science is an experimental investigation into a physical phenomenon where precise observations can be made and measurements taken, where experiments are repeatable and universally testable.9 Viewed in this light, the aim of science is explanation (whether or not this is put in the service of truth). To be more precise, the aim of science is to produce empirically adequate theories, whether or not they are true.10 These theories succeed each other as successive approximations to the full truth (but only approximations).11 All scientific theories operate within the ambit provided by natural laws. However, some scientists deny even the existence of any natural laws. To them there are only regularities and no laws of nature.12 With this scope, science cannot claim to possess any knowledge of metaphysical and supra-phenomenal realms of existence. Anything lying outside the purview of nature is summarily excluded from the domain of science: For the scientific oudook only two vital factors were left: mechanistic nature, on the one hand, and scientific reasoning, on the other. This nature and this reason were the sole realities; they mirrored each other; nothing else existed and nothing else counted. Scientific reason was the only instrument to grasp truth; what could not be weighed and measured became non-existent. God and moral values were imponderables and so was the human mind itself. Consciousness which had discovered scientific truths was itself banished from reality; it was neither a noumenon nor a phenomenon, but was called an epiphenomenon, an ineffectual by-product of the mechanistic causation of the brain cells. Life and mind must be explained away in terms of matter, which was assumed to be the Ultimate Reality.13 Religion, on the other hand, concerns itself with the question of ideal conduct and a belief in the Unseen. This belief in the Unseen guides and directs human behaviour in its totality. Being a manifestation and expression of God's infinite wisdom, religious tenets and principles have been set in the light of eternity. Empirical investigation and inductive reasoning are of little 9 See, "Science* in Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia. 10 See, B. van Fraassen, The Scientific Image (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), 78. 11 See, Antony Flew, "Philosophy of Science" in A Dictionary of Philosophy (London: Macmillan, 1979), 320. 12 See, van Fraassen, The Scientific Image, 94. 13 Abdul Hakim, Islamic Ideology, 2-3.</page><page sequence="6">516 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI use here. Religion is concerned with value judgments whereas science is concerned only with phenomenal truth and the discovery of laws and uniformities. Religion, however, is concerned with the spiritual, the immeasurable, and the uniquely individual. Belief in God always goes beyond reason in the sense that the source of its warrant is not the deliverance of reason. However, it does not follow that such a belief is irrational, or is contrary to reason, as if faith were necessarily blind or a leap in the dark.14 Instead, it is concerned with an infinite spiritual reality where God is not just a probable hypothesis, but a living and experienced fact of life. Professor Stephen Jay Gould makes the point in the following words: Science tries to document the factual character of the natural world, and to develop theories that coordinate and explain these facts. Religion, on the other hand, operates in the equally important, but utterly different, realm of human purposes, meanings, and values.15 Though we are not obliged to subscribe to Professor Gould's view in its entirety (as who is to deal with the factual character of the non-natural, supernatural world?), yet the difference shown here is quite significant. Today, however, this fundamental difference between the nature and temperament of religion and science has been blurred. The theists are busy in showing the scientific disposition of religion without realizing that religion is primarily a matter of faith and belief, and that "...to mix up theology with astronomy might vitiate both."16 Men of science have also gone berserk in a futile enterprise to criticize religion on the basis of their inductive reasoning forgetting that science neither claims nor has any absolute or permanent truths. To say that established scientific principles have come to stay is to exhibit ignorance about the true working of science as nothing can be established in science in the ultimate sense of the word. A by-product of this so-called objective attitude is a pronounced contempt for all those religious tenets and precepts which, according to this attitude, are unscientific and hence untrue. In fact, when it comes to religion, science must recognize its limits if it is to remain true to its salt. Science and religion have two different epistemologies and idioms. The study of natural phenomenon is primarily the subject of science and not of religion. Allusions 14 See, A. Plantinga, God and Other Minds (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 66. 15 H.

Science cannot tell us anything about the existence of God, eschatology, prophethood, charity, soul, justice, etc. All this is the domain of religion. If science gives any opinion in such matters, it infringes upon the premises of religion and thereby seriously risks its own validity and forfeits its claim to objectivity and empiricism. For example, look at the following two statements which are true but their truthfulness operates at two different levels of reality: 1. God made water. 2. Hydrogen and Oxygen made water, that is, water came to be by a particular combination of hydrogen and oxygen. Now both of these statements are true and the truthfulness of the one does not necessitate the falsity of the other. It is simply a matter of two different levels of reality. What a scientist can do at the most is to disbelieve the first statement, but he has no right to deny the possibility of truthfulness to it as he does not have the means to disprove this statement. If Einstein invalidates Newton and shows that gravitation is no longer a matter of attraction, how does it entail the conclusion that there is no God behind the great drama of human existence?17 Even if Darwinism is accepted to be absolutely true, that cannot exclude the possibility of God being the One who prescribed the process described by Darwin for the creation of man, and hence a theist can reasonably maintain that ultimately this evolutionary intelligence has its source in God. Another thing to be noted is the nature of scriptural language and we should not judge it by the so-called analytical criticism of the day. Religion uses (and must use for all practical purposes) the language that is in tune with the idiom of the day or common observation. Again, look at the following two statements: 1. The sun rises in the east. 2. The sun rises from nowhere; there is neither the east nor the west. These two statements can also coexist and are not mutually exclusive. If religion uses the first statement, it does not deny the possibility of the second because both the statements are talking in two different idioms. Here the question is not whether the sun rises in the east or the west; instead, the 17 See, Manzoor Ahmad, Islam: Chand Fikrl Masa'il (Lahore: Institute of Islamic Culture, 2003), 18.</page><page sequence="8">518 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI question is whether there is any Divine Intellect behind the apparent existence and functioning of the sun.18 Aristotelian logic of "either...or" is of no use here and it has been the application of this ruthless logic to religion which gave rise to much of the confrontation between religion and science in history.19 Revisionism of Science It would also be pertinent to see how science has shifted its grounds from time to time. A cursory survey of the history of science will make it abundantly clear that science has never been static and immune to change. Abdul Hakim has rightly observed, "Has not the progress of Science been from error to error or if you please from lesser truth to greater truth?"20 He further maintains: Who can say that Science even at present is completely free of myths and mysteries? With all the limitations of human knowledge and experience, the hypothesis of pure mechanical naturalism is now being gradually superseded. The great biologists say that life cannot be explained in terms of purposeless mechanism; it has a causation sui generis. Psychologists like William James came to the conclusion that mind is more than mere biological life; mental causation and the relation of body to mind cannot be explained in merely biological terms. This may be called either the Retreat of Science or the Advance of Science; it all depends on how you view it.21 Some people might argue that the basic postulates and principles of science do not change but other less central and peripheral theories and conceptions are revised or improved upon. This, however, is just a convenient explanation. The fact of the matter is that every breakthrough in science changes its basic principles and postulates. From Ptolemaic to Copernican system* from Newtonian Physics to Einstein's Relativity, from the Determinism of Classical Physics to the Uncertainty Principle, from Euclidean Geometry to non-Euclidean Geometry, the change has always been about the basics and fundamentals. Modern science does not leave any possibility, even theoretical, for the rigid determinism of the classical physics. In physics, the concept of force is well-established. Any influence that accelerates an object is called force. Force is a vector, which means that it has both direction and magnitude. The force acting on an object, the object's mass, and the acceleration of the object are all related to each other by Newton's 18 See, Abdul Hakim, Islamic Ideology, 34. 19 Manzoor Ahmad, Islam: ChandFikri Masa'il (pp. 13-34) is an insightful book on this subject. 20 Hakim, Islamic Ideology, 7. 21 Ibid., 8.</page><page sequence="9">FALSIFIABILITY OF SCIENCE AND THE TRANSCENDENTALISM OF RELIGION 519 second law of motion. But Einstein denies this very concept of force. Razi-ud Din Siddiqi, an eminent Pakistani mathematician, philosopher and founding Vice-chancellor of Quaid-i-Azam University, has significantly remarked: As a matter of fact Einstein has demonstrated by a detailed analysis that it is entirely unnecessary and superfluous to introduce the concept of force in science. There is no such thing as force. Bodies move not because they are pulled or pushed, or because there is a gravitational, electrical or magnetic attraction, but because the space-time continuum is of such a nature that bodies are obliged to move in their apparent orbits.22 Another concept about which Einstein made a radical departure from traditional physics was the gravitation. Gravitation is the force of attraction between all objects that tends to pull them toward one another. It is a universal force, affecting the largest and smallest objects, all forms of matter and energy. Newton was the first to develop a quantitative theory of gravitation, holding that the force of attraction between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Einstein proposed a wholly new concept of gravitation involving the four-dimensional continuum of space-time which is curved by the presence of matter. In his general theory of relativity, he showed that a body undergoing uniform acceleration is indistinguishable from one that is stationary in a gravitational field. Thus the Newtonian concept of gravitation gave way to Einstein's space-time curvature. This brings us to Joseph Boscovich who made this incomprehensible proposition that matter of physicists, which occupies space, is composed of particles which do not.23 What would you say about this latest assertion by the physicists that matter, in the sense of spatial substance, has ceased to exist? The electrons, we are being told today, have none of the properties of matter. They are neither solid, nor liquid, nor gaseous. They have neither mass, nor form; and their dissociation in radio-activity casts doubt upon the classical notion of the indestructibility of matter. What exactly matter is, no one knows yet, and we should acknowledge that frankly. The more we study matter the less we see it as fundamental, the more we perceive it as merely the externality of energy, as our flesh is the outward sign of life and mind.24 Similarly, the notion of ether is losing all explanatory value. Some have gone so far as to say that ether is a fiction created to conceal the learned ignorance of science; it is as mystical as a ghost or a soul. Einstein, by redefining the concept of gravitation, 22 Razi-ud-Din Siddiqi, Iqbal as a Thinker (Lahore: Sheikh Muhammad Ashraf, 1994), 27-28. 23 See, Will Durant, The Pleasures of Philosophy (New York, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1981), 40. 24 See, ibid., 42-43.</page><page sequence="10">520 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI overthrew the idea of ether; latterly he decided to restore it for a while; whenever a physicist is puzzled he answers, "Ether."25 According to Henri Poincare (d. 1912), modern physics is in a state of chaos, reconstructing all its bases, and meanwhile hardly knowing where it stands.26 Oswald Spengler (d. 1936) with exceptional courage said, "...every atomic theory is a myth and not an experience."27 To Spengler, all science is a fable convenue, a mythology in which "electricity," "positional energy," "forces" and "laws" take the places of demons and gods, and the schematizing intellect cramps the actualities of life into the forms of mathematics and mechanics.28 Karl Raimund Popper (1902-1994) was an Austrian-born British philosopher of science. He is known for his theory of scientific method and for his criticism of historical determinism. In The Logic of Scientific Discovery he criticised the prevailing view that science is fundamentally inductive in nature. Proposing a criterion of falsifiability for scientific validity, Popper emphasized the hypothetico-deductive character of science. Scientific theories are hypotheses from which can be deduced statements testable by observation. If the appropriate experimental observations falsify these statements, the hypothesis is refuted. If a hypothesis survives efforts to falsify it, it may be tentatively accepted.29 No scientific theory, however, can be conclusively established. Thus by rejecting the traditional conception of induction, which held that a scientific hypothesis may be verified through the accumulation of confirming observations, Popper argued instead that scientific hypotheses can at best only be falsified. Since Popper, the principle of falsifiability has come to be accepted as a vital component of scientific investigation. Any principle which is not falsifiable is not scientific. Thus if a proposition wants to qualify for being scientific it must be falsifiable.30 W.W. Bartley III is a professor of philosophy at The Hoover Institution, Stanford University, illustrates Popper's position as follows: An ardent advocate of reason and the scientific spirit, Popper nonetheless denied the very existence of scientific induction, argued that probability (in the sense of the probability calculus) could not be used to evaluate universal scientific theories, disputed the importance of the verification (as opposed to falsification) 25 Ibid., 40. 26 See, ibid., 41. 27 Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), 1: 367. 28 See, Will Durant, The Pleasures of Philosophy, 42. 29 See, "Karl Popper" in Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia, at: &lt;http://encarta.msn.com&gt; (1997-2009). 30 See, Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations (New York: Basic Books, 1963), 84.</page><page sequence="11">FALSIFIABILITY OF SCIENCE AND THE TRANSCENDENTALISM OF RELIGION 521 of hypotheses, denied the importance of meaning analysis in most branches of philosophy and in science, and introduced his famous falsifiability criterion of demarcation to distinguish science from ideology and metaphysics.31 Now here our men of religion have some food for thought. Are they going to prove the scriptural realities through something which is falsifiable in its very nature? Is it of any good to religion to be proved through something in which falsifiability has precedence over verifiability? These questions sufficiently illustrate the fact that vindication of religion through science is insecure and shallow. Scientific argument in favour of religion is much more of a problem than a help. Let us talk of mathematics ? the mother of all sciences and sometimes the language of science. Of late we have been told that even mathematics is not without inconsistencies and problems. The person who undertook a serious critique of consistency and completeness of mathematics was Kurt Godel (1906-78), a Hungarian born American logician, known primarily for his research in philosophy and mathematics. He proved that a mathematical system always contains statements that can neither be proved nor disproved within the system. In simpler words, as a science, mathematics can never be totally consistent and totally complete in itself. His theorem can be illustrated as follows: Godel used an ingenious numbering system to translate statements about a mathematical theorem 7 into numerical statements within T. Then he used many applications of the rules of logic (called a proof) to show that a theorem could not be proven to be consistent or complete. To understand how GodePs proof works, imagine a numerical statement within Tthat means "this statement has no proof in T* Call this statement S and treat it like any other statement in T. If this particular statement S is provable in T, then S is false, which would make T inconsistent. Therefore, S must be unprovable and thus true. If S is true, then the negation of S (not S) ? "this statement has proof in T" ? must be unprovable; otherwise 5 would be false. Because neither S or not S is unprovable, T is incomplete. If we try to prove that T is consistent, we prove Sy which is impossible. Therefore, T cannot be proven to be consistent or complete.32 Here it is interesting to note that Godel published his theorem in 1931. This was the time when the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862 1943), recognised as one of the leaders of the formalist movement, proposed 31 W.W. Bartley HI. "Popper, Karl Raimund" in The Social Science Encyclopedia, ed. Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985), 622. 32 "Kurt Godel" in Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia, at: &lt;http://encarta.msn.com&gt; (1997-2009).</page><page sequence="12">522 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI that every mathematical theory should be given firm logical foundations. Formalism aimed at establishing the completeness and consistency of each theory. Godel proved the formalists' position in establishing completeness and consistency to be untenable. Thus the proverbial accuracy and consistency of mathematics, the mother of all sciences, was brought into question from within ? what to speak of the postulates and premises of other natural sciences. Next comes causality. The principle of causality is of cardinal importance for the empirical investigations of science. Testability and repeatability of scientific experiments owes much to the validity of this principle. What is causality? Causality is a relationship of a cause to its effect. When we say that fire causes smoke, we mean that fire is a cause and smoke is an effect. How much this principle of causality is crucial to science can be seen from the following opinion: The ultimate test of the validity of a scientific hypothesis is its consistency with the totality of other aspects of the scientific framework. This inner consistency constitutes the basis for the concept of causality in science, according to which every effect is assumed to be linked with a cause.33 That means any invalidation or suspension of causality can have consequences for scientific consistency and accuracy. But a serious critique of causality is already underway and laws of causality are being challenged. The classical view of causality reduces cause to a motion or change followed by another motion or change with a mathematical equality between measures of motion. This mechanical characterization of causality is already gone. David Hume (d. 1776) said that causality is not a real relation, but a fiction of the mind. Hume divided all knowledge into two kinds: knowledge of relations of ideas ? that is, the knowledge found in mathematics and logic, which is exact and certain but provides no information about the world; and knowledge of matters of fact ? that is, the knowledge derived from sense perception. Hume argued that most knowledge of matters of fact depends upon cause and effect, and since no logical connection exists between any given cause and its effect, one cannot hope to know any future matter of fact with certainty.34 Thus, the most reliable laws of science might not remain true ? a conclusion that had a revolutionary impact on the philosophy of science. Because of this, the rigid determinism of classical physics has lost much of its validity. To Hakim: 33 "Scientific Method" in Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia, &lt;http://encarta.msn.com&gt;. 34 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, first printed in 1740 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967), 76.</page><page sequence="13">FALSIFIABILITY OF SCIENCE AND THE TRANSCENDENTALISM OF RELIGION 523 But Naturalism itself having accomplished its task began to deteriorate from within. Its view of Nature and human Reason was too narrow and one-sided; so was its view of causation. What is called the law of causality was really the regularity of inter-phenomenal uniformities and these regularities differed form sphere to sphere of existence. The causation that worked in matter was transformed when matter was organized into life or life assimilated matter and changed it according to its own requirements. The mistake of Naturalism lay in its limited and defective view of causation. Frantic attempts were made to explain the organism and its workings on mechanistic principles.35 Bertrand Russell (d. 1970) has also criticized the rigid relation of cause to effect: The text-books say that A is the cause of B if A is 'necessarily' followed by B. This notion of 'necessity' seems to be purely anthropomorphic, and not based upon anything that is a discoverable feature of the world...We must not have any notion of 'compulsion/ as if the cause forced the effect to happen...The notion of compulsion is just as little applicable to effects as to causes. To say that causes compel effects is as misleading as to say that effects compel causes.36 Huston Smith (b. 1919) is a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He is widely regarded as one of the most learned and and brilliant cotemporary writers on the history of religion. In his book Religion: Significance and Meaning in an Age of Disbelief "he draws upon the insights from comparative religions, theology, philosophy, science, and history. The book is a magnificent study of the subject and helps restore an undeniable primacy of religion. Smith imagines a time when humans will go beyond the present materialistic and relativistic understanding of existence and recognize that consciousness not matter, is the ultimate foundation the universe. About the revisionism of science too he has made an eloquent analysis: For the knowledge class in our industrialized Western civilization, it has come to seem self-evident that the scientific account of the world gives us its full story and that the supposed transcendent realities of which religions speak are at best doubtful. If in any way our hopes, dreams, intuitions, glimpses of transcendence, intimations of immortality, and mystical experiences break step with this view of things, they are overshadowed by the scientific account. Yet history is a graveyard for outlooks that were once taken for granted. Today's common sense becomes tomorrow's laughingstock; time makes ancient truth uncouth. Einstein defined common sense as what we are taught by the age of six, or perhaps 35 Abdul Hakim, Islamic Ideology, 20-21. 36 Burtend Russell, Outline of Philosophy (London: Unwin Hyman Limited, 1927), 90-91.</page><page sequence="14">524 JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI fourteen in the case of complex ideas. Wisdom begins with the recognition that our presuppositions are options that can e examined and replaced if found wanting.37 In the light of all this we can say that the revisionism of science is a historical fact and at no stage can we have a claim to absolute knowledge. We cannot say that any of our discoveries or inventions has come to stay. Our world is too unstable and the foundation of science too precarious. Lest we err and overrate our achievements, we should confine our embrace to our reach; let us not put blind faith in science that grows more and more erudite from day to day, and every day refutes its yesterday. Is Science Immune from Belief? How many times have the exponents of religions been accused of being zealous votaries of faith, implying that it is unbecoming to have faith? Is science free of all faiths and beliefs? Can a scientist, no matter how objective, be without any faith? As a matter of fact, even science is not devoid of faith and belief. Science itself requires a leap of faith that is at least as strong as religious commitment. All science is based upon axioms and postulates and a priori premises which themselves are statements whose truthfulness is taken for granted without any proof ? "Woe to him whose beliefs play fast and loose with the order which realities follow in his experience; they will lead him nowhere or else make false connections."38 In fact the whole edifice of science rests upon a faith. Aldus Huxley (d. 1895) has rightly said, "All science is based upon an act of faith ? faith in the validity of the mind's logical processes, faith in the ultimate explicability of the world, faith that the laws of thought are laws of things."39 If people committed to religion believe in the Unseen, scientist are also obliged to have some notion of a belief in the Unseen. The whole paraphernalia of scientific knowledge and investigation is not observable. A great deal of unobservable and indemonstrable lies in its fold: All science is a study of the Seen on the basis of certain beliefs based on the Unseen. The Law of Causation or the Uniformity of Nature is the fundamental axiom of all science. The scientist starts with the belief that there is a universe subject to a reign of law in every aspect and every detail. But the universe as seen 37 Houston Smith, Religion: Significance and Meaning in an Age of Disbelief (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2002), 60. 38 W.

How does a scientist assert about an Infinite Whole what he experiences only in a very finite part? Every scientist must believe that the Unseen is immensely greater than the Seen... It has become customary to compare and contrast religion with philosophy on the one hand and science on the other, and asserting in a very shallow manner that religion compels you to believe in the Unseen while science deals only with perceptible and verifiable realities and philosophy deals with only logically demonstrable reasoning or speculative thinking. We have seen above how all the three are constructed on the foundations of Belief in the Unseen. Reason itself is founded on the belief in the rationality of existence which is again a belief in the Unseen because the rationality of the totality of existence could never become a perceptible or a demonstrable face.40 So it is time to frankly acknowledge our limitations and deficiencies. No amount of discovery can, at any time, enable us to berate the belief in the Unseen. In face of these boundless reaches of our universe, people wedded to science cannot claim any finality of information or authenticity, more kind of so when men of science themselves are not devoid of their own faith and belief. What lies before the birth and after the death for each and all of us can be a matter of faith, never of inductive reasoning or robust empiricism. Conclusion It is time to call a halt and let us hope that one day science will learn to see things whole and then religion will not be perched precariously upon the shifting sands of its theoretical reasoning. Till such time the people of science should remember that a useful abstraction from reality is not reality itself. Protagonists of religion too should withdraw from this needless confrontation. Even to start with, they should reiterate the transcendental character of religion. Religion always talks of ultimate and final truths which may not be perceived by science; and, quite probably, some of these truths may never be grasped by science. It is not a question of time; it is a question of a fundamental difference which sets the two eternally apart. Citing general scriptural statements backed by equally general scientific principles is not a conciliation of science and religion or, to be more precise, a confirmation of religion. It is, however, not to say that religion cannot be proved by science. Instead, the study maintains that it is not required because an essential principle of religion is belief in the Unseen. This belief in the Unseen is an intuitive understanding and is in no need of any empirical evidence. Religious tenets are timeless. They neither age nor expire. Science, after all, is given to ' 40 Abdul Hakim, Islamic Ideology, 40-41.</page><page sequence="16">JAMIL ASGHAR JAMI simplification and always tries to reduce the complexities of phenomena to the candour of speech. It supposes that it is dealing with things but the fact is that the whole material of science consists of sensations, perceptions, and conceptions, rather than of things. Ironically, a large number of great scientists Rene Descartes (d. 1650), Blaise Pascal (d. 1662), Isaac Newton (d. 1727), Albert Einstein (d. 1955), etc. have always maintained a respectful posture to religion and most of them never overrated the abilities of science. Newton is reported to have said, "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."41 Religious faith on the other hand is a matter of vision and commitment, not of speculative theories. The history of science is the history of revision. At no stage of its evolutionary march, science could have claimed finality. Even today the most fundamental postulates of science are on the brink of revision and in the broader perspective of tomorrows an Einstein here or a Copernicus there may come up and make a radical departure from the current status of science. Will Durant's words can furnish a befitting end to this paper: Finally, and by the same token, there is a God. If the sense of duty involves and justifies belief in rewards to come, 'the postulate of immortality...must lead to the supposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect; in other words, it must postulate the existence of God.' This again is no proof by 'reason;' the moral sense, which has to do with the world of our actions, must have priority over that theoretical logic, which was developed only to deal with sense phenomena. Our reason leaves us free to believe that behind the thing-in-itself there is a just God; our moral sense commands us to believe it. Rousseau was right: above the logic of the head is the feeling in the heart. Pascal was right: above the logic of the head is the feeling in the heart. Pascal was right: the heart has reasons of its own, which the head can never understand.42 $ ? ? 41 D. Brewster, Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton (Charleston.
