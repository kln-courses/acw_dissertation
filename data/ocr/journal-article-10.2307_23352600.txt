<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jeanette Bicknell An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics Spinoza's analysis of the emotions has been the subject of much study, but commentators usually neglect his treatment of love and friendship.1 Philosophers interested in Spinoza's analysis of the emotions have tended to focus on three major issues. Some, like Edwin Curley, look at Spinoza's place in the history of thought about the emotions and compare his views with those of Descartes and others.2 Others, like Stuart Hampshire, concentrate on Spinoza's analysis of the "intellectual conversion" by which we gain freedom from passions, with little discussion of what implications * I am very grateful to David Jopling for his kind assistance in the development of this paper.

In addressing this overlooked component of Spinoza's philosophy, this paper tries to determine what contribution a study of Spinoza's conception of love might make to contemporary discussions of love and friendship. I will argue that, despite its limitations, there is much that is compelling in Spinoza's thoughts on these emotions. While Spinoza's economical definition of love ("pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause," III, 13S) is forceful, does it meet Spinoza's own goal to capture the "nature" of love?6 Can the intricate network of emotional bonds and interactions usually considered to constitute love between human beings be reduced to pleasure accompanied by psychological associations? Even our love for our pets does not seem adequately characterized in this way. While pleasure and mutual benefit are essential aspects of love, so too are attachment to the loved one, concern for the loved one's well being, and the willingness to act on that concern, even at cost to oneself. Equally crucial to our idea of love is the belief that these feelings of concern and attachment can withstand hardship and adversity, and are of some duration. Ideally at least, love is celebrated as "an ever fixed mark/That looks on tempests and is never shaken."7 At the opposite extreme from Spinoza's simple, very general definition of love lies his almost mystical conception of the intellectual love of God.

We cannot even endeavour that God, the object of our love, love us in return (V, 19). Is love of God then discontinuous from love for our fellow human beings? Are the positive values of love for God found only in love for a supreme Deity, or can something of its unselfishness be present in our love for one another? I will argue that there is a more subtle and complex view of love implicit in the Ethics, and that Spinoza does allow for the possibility of a sophisticated, mature love between human beings. This third type of love, which may be characterized as "self-determined," mediates between the extremes of love based on inadequate ideas (what Spinoza calls the "common sort of love" V, 20S) and the intellectual love of God. Like the common type of love, self-determined love is based on pleasure. Yet as it also possesses some of the positive aspects of the intellectual love of God, self-determined love can encourage actions which do not directly benefit the agent. The primary manifestation of self-determined love is in human friendships; indeed, true friendships are impossible without it.8 A General Picture of Spinoza's View of Love and Some Difficulties Spinoza's use of the word "love" does not overlap seamlessly with modern usage. His conception of love is broader than ours, and may be understood as a generic term which encompasses many favourable sentiments. This extreme generality is one of the problems with Spinoza's analysis of love. If love is just pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause, then it is difficult within his system to distinguish between different degrees and variations of love. We are compelled, for example, to give the name of love to both the pleasure which arises from spending time with a close friend and that which arises from the act of eating jelly donuts. A definition of love that encompasses both fleeting gratification and long term emotional and intellectual attachment may simply be too broad to be of much psychological applicability or philosophical interest. 8 Pierre Macherey hints that Spinoza's "demystification" of love in part III of the Ethics paves the way for the rehabilitation of the same emotion in part V (Macherey, 143n.). Unfortunately he does not explore this theme in detail.</page><page sequence="4">44 Jeanette Bicknell Spinoza attempts to make his conception of love account for some of the subtleties of that emotion by emphasizing the external object which accompanies the feeling of pleasure: the explication of every passive emotion must include the nature of the external object which produces it, and there are as many different kinds of love as there are external objects (III, 56). But a problem with such an analysis is that it is difficult to talk about love meaningfully if every object calls forth a different type of love. In Spinozistic terms, general categories like "love of dogs" would have to be replaced by a myriad of specific categories ("love of miniature dachshunds," etc.). Yet we do speak of general types of love, such as a mother's love for her children, despite the fact that every child is different. Spinoza gives little indication as to the status of general and specific types of love, how the two might be related, or if general types of love can even be admitted. Spinoza anticipates this criticism in the Ethics: given his aim of providing a comprehensive philosophical psychology, the existence of different types of love is not crucial. Although there is a great difference between, say, love for one's spouse and love for one's children, there is no need to investigate these differences. For his purposes in the Ethics it is sufficient "to understand the common properties of the emotions and the mind so as to determine the nature and the extent of the mind's power in controlling and checking the emotions" (III, 56S). While the existence of general and specific types of love is of limited consequence for Spinoza's project, his analysis is nonetheless incomplete in view of his goals of practical applicability for the Ethics. Spinoza does not address the fact that love is usually considered to carry moral obligations. In his view, moral obligations arise only as a result of civil society (III, 37S2); yet love exists in the natural state as well as in civil society. Indeed, love for different objects is commonly thought to entail different moral obligations. For example, a woman who deserts her husband is not thought to be as morally reprehensible as one who deserts her children. The reader of Anna Karenina may have no trouble forgiving Anna for deserting her dull husband; Anna's greatest moral lapse, however, which Tolstoy does not mean us to forgive, is to abandon her young son. Love for another adult involves lesser obligations than love for a dependent child. This complexity of differing obligations within our loving relationships exposes a deficiency in the practical application of Spinoza's system. Another difficulty with Spinoza's definition of love involves what has</page><page sequence="5">An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics 45 been called the "dialectic of fungibility."9 On the one hand, love is transferable: an infant experiences love in the relationship with its principal caregiver. As part of normal psychological development, the infant learns to "transfer" this affection to other beings. Yet the object of our love is also thought to be "non-fungible," i.e., one loved object cannot be substituted for another object in the manner that any combination of bank notes can be used to pay a debt. A fully realized conception of love must be able to account for the transferability/non-fungibility dialectic. Spinoza's insistence that an emotion be explicated with reference to its object is helpful here. If love for, say, one's spouse, is non-fungible, then that particular individual, as external object, is not subject to substitution by any other external object. Yet difficulties remain: by the mere fact that we imagine a thing to have something in common with an object that pleases us, we will love that thing (III, 16). This leaves open the possibility that a loved object might be adequately replaced by an object which is similar to it. If, then, a friend is grieving over the death of his beloved grey poodle, does that mean that the gift of a similar grey poodle would be appropriate? Probably not — in fact the grieving friend would likely think you insensitive if you appeared on the doorstep with the gift of another dog in tow. Love for the first poodle involved more than the nature of the poodle as simple external object. It also involved an emotional investment in that external object—time spent with the poodle on walks, feeding it, and so forth. It is this "emotional investment" by the loving subject which contributes to the non-fungibility of a loved object, not merely the singularity of the object itself.10 While Spinoza does address the need for an analysis of the subject—the desire of one individual differs from that of another individual in the same way that their essences vary (III, 7S), love's dual nature as transferable yet non-fungible requires a more detailed analysis of the loving subject than Spinoza can offer within the scope of his wider project in the Ethics. A discussion of the "phenomenology" of love, including the effect of love on an individual's moral psychology, and the possibility that love might be a 9 Ronald de Souza, "Self-Deceptive Emotions," in Explaining Emotions, ed. Amelie Rorty (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), 292-294. 10 Amelie Rorty has addressed the "historicity" of emotions in "The Historicity of Psychological Attitudes: Love is Not Love Which Alters Not When It Alteration Finds," Midwest Studies in Philosophy 10 (1986).</page><page sequence="6">46 Jeanette Bicknell catalyst for character change or development, would make his account more comprehensive. A more serious critique of Spinoza's conception of love is that it clashes with his ethical theory. For Spinoza, the basis of virtue is the conatus—the desire of each person to persist in their being (IV, 22C). Thus, every individual should seek his or her own advantage (IV, 18S). Given this conviction, would Spinoza be able to endorse any altruistic or even disinterested acts; and what would the implications be for his conception of love? It is not clear that selfless behaviour for the benefit of a loved one could ever be considered virtuous. Yet Spinoza's view is more subtle than an incomplete examination of his views on virtue and the conatus might suggest and is tempered by two factors. The first is his view of the nature of the good: good and evil are defined with reference to their effect on rational understanding. Whatever is conducive to understanding is good, and whatever hinders understanding is bad (IV, 27). The statement that people should seek their own advantage must be understood in the restricted sense that people should do whatever they can to develop their power of understanding.11 Secondly, virtue and the conatus must be understood with reference to the notion of an "expanded self'; that is, a constituent part of the self is its need for the society of others.12 Spinoza is convinced that whatever is conducive to social organization and harmony is good (IV, 40), and he repeatedly extols the benefit of living among other rational individuals. The more that we live under the sway of reason, the more we will understand the benefit of social harmony, and will desire that same good for others. Hence preservation of the self will include preservation of social order and justice. The "self' of self-preservation refers not only to the individual, but also to those with whom, broadly speaking, he or she has a relationship of mutual benefit. So Spinoza's ethical theory does not preclude the possibility of altruistic action based on love. Having given a general view of Spinoza's conception of love and some of 11 Spinoza makes this point with considerable force in the opening paragraphs of On the Improvement of the Understanding. See The Chief Works of Benedict de Spinoza, volume II, tr. R. H. M. Elwes (London: George Bell and Sons, 1898). 12 Wolfson develops this notion to distinguish Spinoza's ethical views from those of Hobbes. See H. A. Wolfson, The Philosophy of Spinoza (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1934), 2:247.</page><page sequence="7">An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics 47 the difficulties inherent in it, I will now look more closely at the two types of love in the Ethics which have human beings as their objects: the extremes of "common" love and active, self-determined love.13 A Taxonomy of Love in the Ethics The following discussion is based on a distinction between active and passive emotions. Spinoza considers many emotions, but is convinced that all are based upon pleasure, pain, or desire (III, IIS). Passive emotions are those which are based upon pain (III, 59), or do not follow from the individual's conatus for self preservation. Active emotions are based on pleasure and are consistent with the individual's conatus (III, 59). (i) The "common sort of love" Spinoza is convinced that the majority of people—in bondage to their emotions—typically experience this first type of love. Love here is not self-determined but passive, and as such is determined by the nature of the loved object. The common type of love is related to our conatus for self-preservation only insofar as we are a part of Nature that cannot be considered independently of other parts. It is connected to pleasure insofar as the latter is a passive transition having its basis in inadequate ideas. One of the distinguishing features of the common type of love is immoderation. It is related to titillation, which is in turn defined as unbalanced physical pleasure.14 As a passive emotion, the power of common love may be so great as to surpass the other activities of the body (IV, 6), and not be of advantage to the whole person (IV, 6). So, while pleasure is in itself good (IV, 41), the love which I have for, say, Japanese bonsai gardening will be excessive if the pleasure I derive from it surpasses the other activities of my body and I am in a state of mental obsession, unable to eat, sleep, etc. This pleasure will also be unhealthy, physically and mentally, to the extent 13 The intellectual love of God, one of the most difficult concepts in Spinoza's work, is not discussed. To do it justice would require a much deeper examination than is possible here. 14 Titillation is pleasure in which at least one of the body's parts is affected more than the others; it is bad if the power of this emotion is so great as to surpass the other activities of the body and hinder the body's ability to be affected in other ways (IV, 43). Titillation combined with the idea of an external cause is love (IV, 44).</page><page sequence="8">48 Jeanette Bicknell that it does not relate to me as a whole person, but only, say, as a lover of plants. Common love, then, to the extent that it is immoderate or excessive, is bad. Spinoza emphasizes the physical aspect of the common type of love, and indeed the examples of it that come most readily to mind are cliches of bodily obsession — gluttony, lust, and so forth. Yet for an accurate view of his position it is important to keep in mind that Spinoza is not a dualist. Common love is not bad to the extent that it involves physical pleasure, as every physical state has a corresponding mental expression. Spinoza does allow physical and sensual pleasure an important role in human happiness.15 The common type of love is a negative force to the extent that it is based on inadequate ideas; it is not essential that a physical component predominate. Another example of common love (more prosaic than an obsession with bonsai gardening) might be the love that compels a parent to insist on the innocence of a wayward child, despite evidence to the contrary. While the common type of love can be responsible for much emotional distress (V, 20S), Spinoza's characterization of it is not wholly negative. Desires that do not arise from reason are not necessarily bad—they may be bad or good (IV, Appendix, 3). Spinoza meant us to regard this type of love in the same way that we are to regard, say, pity. Pity is pain accompanied by the idea of ill that has befallen another whom we think of as like ourselves (III, Definitions of the Emotions, 18), and is bad in itself (IV, 41). Yet as far as we can, we endeavour to free from distress a thing that we pity (III, 27C3), and to that extent pity can be good. Similarly, if the common sort of love moves us to acts of kindness or tolerance, to which we are not moved by reason alone, to that extent it is good. Spinoza's descriptions of common love are based upon incisive assessments of human psychology; many of our loves are not grounded in reason and are indeed adequately explained by the conjunction of pleasure with the idea of an external cause. However, if his account of love were to consist solely in an analysis of the common type of love, it would be incomplete. There has been nothing to suggest that we might be capable of selfless actions prompted by love, but based nonetheless on adequate ideas. 15 It is appropriate for the wise man "to refresh and invigorate himself in moderation with good food and drink, as also with perfumes, with the beauty of blossoming plants, with dress, music, sporting activities, theatres and the like." Furthermore, "certainly nothing but grim and gloomy superstition forbids enjoyment" (IV, 45S2).</page><page sequence="9">An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics 49 (ii) Self-Determined Love If love for all other than God is passive, largely self-interested and a potential source of discord, how can it be that love for God will be manifested with such different results? We will recall that Spinoza affirms the existence of active emotions; these are based on pleasure and are consistent with the individual's conatus (III, 59). Implicit in the Ethics, then, is the foundation for a type of love between human beings—one which is based on adequate ideas, and may be characterized as "self-determined." As opposed to intellectual love, the object of self-determined love will not be God but other human beings. Indeed, this type of love is the basis of our most rewarding relationships with others. Spinoza himself gave the name of "nobility" (generositas) to what I have characterized as self-determined love. He states that an individual who lives by the guidance of reason will attempt to render back "love, that is, nobility" in return for another's hatred (IV, 46; my emphasis). Nobility is defined as follows: all activities which follow from emotions that are related to the mind insofar as it exercises understanding are called "strength of mind," which is further subdivided into courage and nobility. While courage refers to those actions which benefit the agent, nobility designates those which are directed to the advantage of another; courtesy and mercy are both characterized as types of nobility. More exactly, nobility is "the desire whereby every individual, according to the dictates of reason alone, endeavors to assist others and make friends of them" (IV, 59S). Some explanation is needed for my change in terminology from "nobility" to "self-determined love." In calling this type of love self-determined, I mean to stress that it follows from the individual's conatus and is based on adequate ideas, and, like any of the active emotions, it is a form of pleasure. The adequate ideas at the foundation of self-determined love include both adequate self-knowledge and adequate knowledge of the loved one. Self-determined love is not "blind" in the sense that we are unaware of the loved one's flaws. To be unaware in this way would be to expose oneself to potential harm, and hence could not follow from the conatus for self-preservation. In instances of self-determined love, our reason is active, and we accept the loved one as a fellow human being, with both the inadequacies and potentials that this implies. The example of common love cited above (a parent's love for a wayward child) can also be construed as an example of self-determined love based on adequate ideas. The difference is that the</page><page sequence="10">50 Jeanette Bicknell parent who is motivated by the common type of love believes in the child's innocence despite all evidence to the contrary; love for the child is not based on reason. The parent whose love is self-determined and based on adequate ideas recognizes that the child has made unwise decisions and has certain character flaws, but loves and supports the child nonetheless. Just as we endeavour to have adequate knowledge of the loved one, the activity of reason and the conatus for self-preservation mean that we strive not to lose sight of our own place in the love relationship, nor of the effects, beneficial or otherwise, that we experience. According to Spinoza's philosophical psychology, reflexive knowledge (that is, knowledge of our emotions and the reasons for these emotions) is crucial for the possibility of self-determined behaviour. Spinoza contends that there is "no more excellent remedy for the emotions than that which consists in true knowledge of them" (V, 4S), and that the more an emotion is known to us, the more it is in our control (V, 3C). P. F. Strawson has raised some interesting issues regarding the implications of a detached, "Spinozistic" attitude in interpersonal relationships. When we regard someone objectively we are not in a full, participatory relationship with him, and do not consider him to be our equal. Rather, he becomes an object, that is, something to be studied, understood, treated, or cured. An objective attitude then is invariably one of condescension, and would seem to be inconsistent with a wide range of human emotions, including love.16 If Strawson is right, then love might be incompatible with the objectivity and rationality that Spinoza extols. However, the type of objectivity which Spinoza has in mind is different from that which Strawson discusses. According to Spinoza, we should strive to see both ourselves and the loved one objectively. From that point of view, their behaviour is no more an object of study than our own, and the equality between us is preserved. Indeed, in advising us to view events under the aspect of eternity, Spinoza can be seen to advocate an attitude of extreme unselfishness, in which our own desires do not take precedence over those of anyone else. Together with the quest for adequate knowledge, a fundamental aspect of self-determined love is its connection with "freedom of the spirit" (animi libertatem). Spinoza does not define this term, although he makes important 16 P. F. Strawson, "Freedom and Resentment," in Freedom and Resentment and Other Essays (London: Methuen &amp; Co., 1974), 1-25.</page><page sequence="11">An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics 51 use of it. In a discussion of marriage he makes the surprisingly egalitarian claim that marriage is in agreement with reason if "the love of both man and woman has for its cause not merely physical beauty but especially freedom of the spirit" (IV, Appendix, 20). A love that acknowledges any other cause than freedom of the spirit "easily passes in hatred" (IV, Appendix, 19). Furthermore, we must recognize God as the highest good and love Him with a free spirit.17 Let us try to get closer to what Spinoza means by "freedom of the spirit." As a type of freedom, freedom of the spirit must be based on adequate ideas (active mental states) and flow from the individual's conatus. It is helpful to elucidate this concept with reference to Spinoza's insistence on the importance of social harmony: whatever is conducive to social harmony is good (IV, 40), and human beings are most advantageous to one another when they live by the guidance of reason (IV, 35C). Spinoza's admonition to love God with a free spirit emphasizes that God should not be worshipped out of fear, superstition, or servility. Such worship would not be founded in reason and adequate ideas, and would therefore not be conducive to social harmony. As marriage and the family are the basic components of society, Spinoza's comments on marriage can likewise be seen to spring from his commitment to social harmony. Marriage will be a source of social stability if the love of men and women is founded in reason and mutual benefit, rather than the love which is "a type of madness" (IV, Appendix, 19). Many characteristics of self-determined love, particularly reflexive knowledge and the strength of character it entails, are highlighted in Spinoza's discussions of friendship. Indeed, this type of love forms the basis of friendship, as well as of non-destructive erotic relationships. Spinoza repeatedly stresses the importance of friendship. He regards human beings as essentially social, as we can never bring it about that we should live unrelated to the things around us (IV, 18S), and sees friendship as the basis of the state (IV, 37S). It is of primary importance to establish relationships with others and "as an absolute rule, to act in such a way as serves to strengthen friendship" (IV, Appendix 12, my emphasis). We saw earlier that Spinoza defines what I have called self-determined love in terms of friendship: nobility is an active emotion which is not directed to the 17 Letter 43 in Correspondence of Spinoza, tr. and ed. Abraham Wolf (London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1927).</page><page sequence="12">52 Jeanette Bicknell benefit of the agent. Specifically, it is the desire, based in reason, to help others and make friends of them (IV, 59S). So while friendship is of benefit to the individual, it is not motivated by or founded upon self-interest. Spinoza accepts the influential Aristotelian view that true or "complete" friendship is among equals,18 but understands it in the sense that friends are equal, insofar as they are rational. He repeatedly stresses the rationality of the agent in discussions of friendship: the most advantageous thing to man is another man who lives according to reason (IV, 35C1). The desire to establish friendships characterizes the individual who lives by the guidance of reason (IV, 37S1). When men are subject to passive emotions, they do not agree in nature (IV, 32). Men can only be said to agree in nature insofar as they live under the guidance of reason (IV, 35), and hence according to active emotions. Friends, then, are those who "agree in nature," and are equal in the sense that they strive to live according to reason. Those who work at living according to reason necessarily develop their capacity for reflexive knowledge and self-determination, and so are not invariably subject to passive emotions.19 Self-contentment, strength of character, and confidence are examples of active emotions based in reason, and hence among the character traits necessary for friendship. Self contentment, which arises from an individual's contemplation of his or her own power, indicates the importance of reflexive knowledge for friendship. "Freedom of the spirit," a fundamental component of self-determined love, is also important here: for a friendship to be truly mutually beneficial and a source of pleasure, both parties must be free and subject as little as possible to passive emotions (IV, 34).20 Hence, only free individuals are united by the closest bond of friendship. 18 Nicomachean Ethics 8.4. 1157b25—37. 19 We will recall that, according to Spinoza, it is impossible for the individual not to be part of Nature and not to undergo changes other than those of which he is the adequate cause (IV, 4). It follows that the individual is always subject to passive emotions (IV, 4C). So no individual, however rational and self-determined, can ever entirely escape passive emotions. 20 Because the concept of "freedom of the spirit" is characterized in the Ethics specifically in the relationship between husband and wife, it is tempting to conclude that Spinoza saw the relationship between husband and wife as potentially between rational agents, and hence equals. He may have been influenced by Thomas Aquinas who held that marriage is the greatest degree of friendship (Summa contra Gentiles, III, 123). Unfortunately, there is not enough evidence to state this conclusively.</page><page sequence="13">An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics 53 Spinoza's conception of the nature of equality between friends can be explained with reference to the distinction between pity and compassion. In the Ethics, Spinoza contrasts compassion with envy, but some of the special features of compassion as an active emotion are brought into relief more sharply if we compare it with pity.21 Pity, as we saw earlier, is defined as pain accompanied by the idea of ill that has befallen another whom we think of as like ourselves (III, Definitions of the Emotions, 18). Because it is a type of pain, pity is a passive emotion, and is based on inadequate ideas. The individual whom we pity is merely "someone we think of as like ourselves," and to whom we feel no special emotional attachment. We can never pity a friend, then, in spite of the bad things that might happen to her. Friendship is based on love, while pity implies a certain distance from the suffering individual. Indeed, because the object of our pity is by definition a source of pain, we are likely to hold ourselves away from him. Compassion, in contrast, is an active emotion. Spinoza defines it as love, insofar as it affects us that we rejoice at another's good, and feel pain at another's hurt (III, Definition of the Emotions, 24). As it is based on love, compassion does not imply distance from the suffering individual. The suffering individual is someone with whom we have associated pleasure, so an emotional bond already exists between us. Although pain is an aspect of compassion, as much as it is of pity, we do not hold ourselves apart from a suffering friend. Compassion is a much deeper emotion than pity; it implies a certain equality between the parties involved, and the fact that a friend's suffering will not adversely affect our opinion of her. Spinoza shares the traditional philosophical conception of friendship as a reciprocal relationship of mutual benefit.22 Reasonable men are just, faithful, and honourable, and seek nothing for themselves that they would not desire for the rest of humanity (IV, 18S). Most crucially, to be of benefit to a friend, one must oneself possess a strong character. Here again, we see the importance of the active emotions, and the mental freedom which comes from continually striving to live according to reason. The love which is expressed in friendship is necessarily self-determined. The common type of love is a passive emotion based on inadequate ideas 21 The importance and philosophical interest of the distinction between pity and compassion was suggested by Lawrence Blum, "Compassion," in Explaining Emotions (note 9 above), 507-517. 22 For example, Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 8.2. 1155b28—1156a5.</page><page sequence="14">54 Jeanette Bicknell and does not encourage strength of character; it is therefore unsuitable for friendship. If an individual does not have adequate ideas of her own strengths and weaknesses, but falls into the traps of either humility (pain arising from contemplation of one's own weakness, IV, 53) or extreme pride (thinking too highly of oneself because of self-love, III, Definition of the Emotions, 28), this lack of adequate self-knowledge will hinder her ability to form friendships that are of mutual benefit. Similarly, if one friend has a too mean or too great opinion of the other, their friendship will not be a relationship of equality. Although the intellectual love of God can prompt goodwill and unselfish acts, it is nonetheless inappropriate for friendship. Spinoza would reject any suggestion that we could have a "friendship" with God as gross anthropomorphism. Conclusion In the course of this paper we have seen that a type of love is implicit in the Ethics which allows that humans are capable of active, self-determined love for one another. Self-determined love mediates between the extremes of "the common type of love," which is a passive emotion, and the intellectual love of God. As an active emotion, self-determined love springs from pleasure, yet is founded upon adequate ideas. Spinoza's analysis of love shares the limitations of other strictly rationalist analyses of human behaviour. The shortcomings in Spinoza's conception of love stem chiefly from his avowed intention to treat the study of human actions and appetites "as if it were an investigation into lines, planes or bodies" (III, Preface). While we have seen that Spinoza's treatment of the emotions is insightful and thought-provoking, human beings are different, not only in degree but also in nature, from predictable, easily understood geometric phenomena. To treat human beings in a manner appropriate for lines or planes is then to deny the complexity of lived human reality.23 23 This is not to say that a rationalist account of the emotions can never be philosophically interesting or psychologically enlightening. In fact all forms of psychoanalysis and most forms of psychotherapy assume the "thought dependence" of emotions. Without such a connection, no matter how hidden or obscured, a "talking cure" aimed at psychological development would not make sense. See Ronald de Sousa, "The Rationality of Emotions," in Explaining Emotions, 127-51; and Jerome Neu, Emotion, Thought and Therapy (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1977).</page><page sequence="15">An Overlooked Aspect of Love in Spinoza's Ethics 55 Nonetheless, there is much in Spinoza's analysis of love that is compelling. The strongest aspect is Spinoza's insistence that love is based on pleasure, and his understanding of pleasure as wide enough to include not only fleeting physical sensations, but also the emotional sustenance necessary for self-contentment, freedom, and happiness. Love is thereby linked to the positive aspects of human life and the potential for emotional growth. York University Toronto</page></plain_text>
