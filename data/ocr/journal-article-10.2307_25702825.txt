Walter Lippmann Against the Lobotomites: Thoughts on the Bible, Philosophy, and Politics Peter Augustine Lawler My effort here is to keep alive the conflict between the natural theology of the philosophers and the personal theology of the Bible, particularly the Christians. I'm siding with Thomas L. Pangle against those who would hide or obscure the fundamental moral and political implications of that conflict. It may surprise some to side with Pangle against many distinguished students of Leo Strauss. Pangle showed me we're on the same side in the final chapter of his fine new book on Leo Strauss {Leo Strauss: An Introduction to His Thought and Intellectual Legacy [Johns Hopkins, 2006]). There Pangle criticizes many Straussians for their understand able but still rationally indefensible circumvention of the radical core of Strauss's thought. They do so, for example, by diminishing the importance of what's atheistic and what's distinctively modern about Locke's thought. They fail to highlight and confront what Pangle calls the modem effort to lobotomize the modern brain, to purge from it through various diversions and technological transformations the permanent human problem of the relationship between the particular human being and eternity. The effort, in other words, is to keep us from thinking about our deepest desire and our hopes for its satisfaction. The effort is to produce human beings who for the most part live unmoved by love or death, who live with their most passionate human longings replaced by relative indifference. The failure of the modern effort to lobotomize human beings, and so the permanence of the human problem, is visible, Pangle adds in a note, in the work of theologically inspired Straussians such as the French Catholic political philosopher Pierre Manent and myself, although neither Manent or I embrace classical rationalism's way of dealing with the problem. And it's one sign among many of the superiority of Pangle's book to the others recently written about Strauss is that he finds an important place?almost an indispensable place?at the Straussian table for theologically-inspired or what Jim Ceaser called faith-based Straussians. I have to add that being theologically inspired seems more open-minded to me, than Pangle's alternative of being inspired by the necessity of defending rational independence. The standpoint of Pangle's book on the Bible {Political Philosophy and the God of Abraham [Johns Hopkins, 2003]) seems to be that of the continued on page 4 In this Issue: Featured Articles on Religion and Politics Symposium on Pluralism and Liberal Democracy Symposium on America Beyond Capitalism A PEGS Reader</page><page sequence="2">FEATURED ARTICLES independent rationalist standing on a high hill fighting off an enemy?revelation?that he has propped up to be stronger than he really thinks it is on its own. But the theologically inspired Straussian is, in effect, constantly animated by the concerns that arise among social, political, and religious beings who are incur ably God directed. To be theologically inspired, it would seem, is to be animated by the question who or what is God, a question which is inseparable from another: who or what am I? Let me say I really do agree with Pangle on the fundamental human problem. I'm stunned by his unwavering resolve, coupled with extraordinary intellectual exertions and an unimaginable dis play of erudition, to confront it. And I admit that I don't understand and/or don't buy classical rationalism's way of dealing with it, at least in the way he understands classical rationalism. Of course, that may be because my exertions are less than stunning and my erudition is quite imaginable. From the view of philosophy, the pro-lobotomy or, to sound more Biblical, lobotomite modern philosophers described by Pangle thought they were doing us a favor. God with his grace has the power to save us all, but the modern philoso phers knew that no amount of power could turn most people into philoso phers. But their lobotomizing procedure just didn't work in chilling the patient out or getting him to compliantly be obedient to reason. Among its main practical effects was what Harvey C. Mansfield calls the totalitarian manliness run amok of the 20th century, and now the growing postmodern conviction that the main effect of rational ism on human life is to reduce particular human lives to utter insignificance. It has also had the effect, of course, of emptying moral life of its contents, and the heart disease that Tocqueville called individualism grows in the West as a result. But in addition to the amorphous religious longings that animate Heideggerian thinkers in their resistance to individualism or techno-relativism, there's another contemporary American anti-relativist phenomenon that Pangle seems to have overlooked: The resurgence in our country of evangelical and even more orthodox religious belief, a resurgence that's mainly reaction to the promiscuous techno-relativism that's come with the American inability to keep Lockean modes of thought limited or in a Locke box. People who care about their families, for example, are surely better off going to the Bible, rather than Locke, for guidance. It's not clear to me how Pangle expects his book on the Bible to affect that belief. In my opinion, its main effect would be to confirm evangelicals in their anti-rationalist or anti-natural prejudices: If the two human alternatives really are blind obedience to revelation or complete rational independence from a loving personal God, then they would have every reason to become more blind or fundamentalist than ever. From their eyes, Pangle shows that the point of philosophy is to negate the credibility of the premises of all genuinely moral and religious life, and their natural response is to want to negate the negation. That's why very soft and gentle or at best ambiguously loboto mite Straussians who try to reconcile modern natural rights with creationist natural law surely have a more salutary teaching. And that's why we Straussians might consider more seriously not only the utility but the truth the Thomistic proposition concerning the compatibility of what we know through reason and what we know through revelation. It seems to conform better than Pangle's extremism to how we actually experience our souls and our lives. But maybe that conclusion is not fair to Pangle's intention: Surely he doesn't want to tell evangelicals dogmatically that the true solution to the contemporary problem of techno-relativism is sim ply to become philosophers, just as they shouldn't tell us, at least too confidently or self-righteously, that the only solution to what ails us is to be born again. Pangle, in a way, criticizes the Enlightenment philosophers' war against revelation or the personal God of the Bible as, in a way, too cautious; the manly Harvey Mansfield criticizes it for being too aggressively atheistic, for undermining all human claims for genuine individual importance. Pangle's case against revelation rightly claims to be less polemical and more theoretical than his Enlightenment predecessors?he means to convince minds rather than distract them and not merely to seduce bodies. That means, of course, it is in the most important sense more aggressive. But his aggression, I think, is not in the service of killing the case against atheism once and for all, but restoring the genuinely intellectual dimension of the conflict between reason and revelation. The Enlightenment philosophers, historicist totalitarians, and our postmodern mythmakers all discourage radical human thought about what it means to be a particular human being open to eternity. Richard Rorty, for example, sees quite well that he and Thomas Jefferson are, in this sense, both pragmatists who would rewrite the Bible to free human beings from both the greatness and misery Pascal or Kierkegaard find in thought. Jefferson, Marx, and Rorty are all, each in his own way, lobotomites, and in a deep way none of them is really convincing today to anyone with eyes to see. Surely we have to agree that the failure of the Enlightenment project in thought presents us with no alternative but to think radically. So Pangle and I share in the great refusal either to be lobotomized or to lobotomize others. And we may even agree with the wisdom of the country song, which I quote imprecisely or from memory: "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy." Before you're too quick to conclude that either classical political 7b be theologically inspired, it would seem, is to be animated by the ques tion who or what is God, a question which is inseparable for another: who or what am I? 4 The Good Society</page><page sequence="3">ON RELIGION AND POLITICS philosophy or Christianity can completely replace hard liquor for either of us, let me add that even Pangle says in his conclusion to his Strauss book that the genuine life of the mind is, at best, a mixture of joy and melancholy. But maybe one reason for that mixture in all the real philosophic types that we actually know and even love is that Pangle, quoting Strauss, says, quite reasonably, that we're not philosophers. We can look up to philosophers and accept their guidance (but not about everything), and we can share in their joy and serenity, but only quite, quite imperfectly. And we remember that Strauss adds that theological psychology?the psychological complexity of the flawed, moral mortal presented in the Bible and in, say, Leon R. Kass's commentary on Genesis {The Beginning of Wisdom: Reading Genesis [Free Press, 2003])?is true for everyone but the philosopher. So it's to some extent or even mostly true for all of us. Plenty of students of political philosophy believe they have chosen for reason and/or for revelation, as Strauss says we should. But even we students of political philosophy really live the tension, as Ernest Fortin wrote, between reason and revelation insofar as we're not perfect philosophers. And Pangle?by radicalizing the two alternatives in speech?provides us indispensable insight into the ineradicable tensions and contradictions that characterize especially the best human beings or at least almost all the best human beings. And so I'm going to boldly say that both Pangle and I really defend, in very different ways of course, the possibility of what might be a way of life somewhere in between lobotomy and seren ity, a way of life the enlightenment philosophers may have worked too hard to abolish. And maybe we agree also that the perfectly serene life would not be that of the philosopher, but of the compre hensively wise man who is stuck with nothing to do and nothing new to think. To be completely serene and completely unerotic is not a possibility, we seem to agree, for a being with a body, thank God. So we really don't join the Seinfeld character in screaming or even hoping for SERENITY NOW. Maybe we only disagree (only!) on what sort of God is the image of perfection beyond all human experience to which the deepest human longings point. So my comments on God and Pangle's Bible book are going to be based on the premise that he regards the life of perfectly rational independence as possible and good, although I've given reason to doubt that either he or I would finally say that. For him, the best way of life may well be the endless struggle to achieve rational certainty about nature and his own situation in the world. But that means for him the very definition of hell would be to wake up one morning knowing that he has completely succeeded?or even that he had become a philosopher (in the sense of the philosopher-king described in the Republic) and nothing more, that the phrase "the philosopher" corresponded perfectly to "Tom Pangle of Austin Texas." Pangle's book makes so many particular claims about so many things that I have to limit myself?for reasons of competence and many others?to general impressions. And in a way I'm only going to suggest why Pangle's teaching style doesn't correspond to my learning style. If these comments don't have much to do with Genesis-based textual controversies, that's because, as a Catholic, I can't claim to read the Bible all that much. And when I do, I can't read Genesis in isolation or by forgetting how the story turns out. (Pangle, to his credit, can't separate the issues surrounding creation with the real possibility of personal resurrection either.) Pangle says more than once that he wrote on the Bible on behalf of the philosophy's?by which he must mean the philoso pher's?rational independence. And it's clear enough for me what independence in his mind is from. It's from revelation?by which he means blind obedience to a willful, inscrutable God. But what is independence for? It is for figuring things out for yourself. But does that mean figuring them out according to your various natural inclinations?which might point in the direction of your duties as a social, political, rational, and religious animal? Or is rational independence freedom from those "moral" duties for some more radical autonomy? Well clearly, for Pangle, it is. He criticizes the Bible for almost enslaving men to their marital and familial lives at the expense of male friendship and even, it seems, the possibility of homosexual or relatively morally unencumbered eros. He seems to embrace the Aristotelian view that the family points beyond itself to political life and political life beyond itself to friendship based on rich and insightful conversation. That friendship, in turn, points beyond itself to a divine rational self-sufficiency. He means that human eros points beyond itself, and he finally seems to identify rational independence with a kind of tran serotic solitude. That solitude seems to be based on some insight about intelligible natural necessity from which God, in truth, can't save us. By seeing nature as eternal, the man who lives the life of rational independence sees that he and we are not. That insight is of the absolute transitoriness of everything human and the insignificance of particular human lives. If there is anything like a personal God, it would be the Socratic political philosopher, that being who exists in his purity only in the Platonic dialogues and beyond any of our experience: And the story of that self-sufficient being is the drama of the particular human being losing himself in the anonymous truth, of learning what it really means to die. According to Leo Strauss, only the philosopher can live in light of this truth without surrendering his humanity. Only he knows what it really means to be alone and what it really means to not be at all. So Pangle disagrees with the Biblical God when he says that it's not good for man to be alone. He points to a way of life that would cut him off from a genuinely erotic or loving relationship Volume 15, Number 3, 2007 5</page><page sequence="4">FEATURED ARTICLES with other human beings and with God. That's a way of life that the Bible presents as sinful?one willfully or proudly cut off from love of and duties to other human per sons and God. Sin, from one view, is our proud, futile, and self-destructive desire to be self-sufficient like the God of the philosophers. And so sin is based on a proud error about both our own being and the being of God. Pangle rightly adds that it's impossi ble for us to figure out why a genuinely omnipotent and omniscient God wouldn't want to be alone. We can't grasp the lacking or longing?what for us would be eros? that would cause Him to create. Who God is eludes us, but just because we can't fully understand the foundation of God's cre ative love doesn't mean it's not there. All we believers can have is faith that our experience of his knowledge and love of us is not an illusion. But we can know, as St. Augustine shows in Book XIX of The City of God, that our deepest longings point in the direction of his personal knowledge and love of us. But Pangle would disagree: The deepest longing of beings capable of philos ophy?of wisdom?point beyond personal knowledge and love. Pangle makes the point that the Biblical God is not erotic, but has other anthropomorphic qualities. He even appears to us?as a lover would?as envious or jealous: He didn't want to lose Eve, it appears, to the lonely life of rational independence. That God is unerotic is a premise of monotheism, a monotheism, Pangle thinks, perfected in the depersonalized God of the philosophers. And I guess it's true that the mono part of monotheism is more perfectly consistent in the God of Aristotle who has no friends: The God Aristotle says we wouldn't want our friends to become because we would lose what we would now call our personal relationship with them, the God who experiences, unlike virtu ally all of us human persons, the goodness of being alone. But maybe it's more reasonable to say that the Biblical God can't be captured by our categories erotic or unerotic, just as He eludes the philosophical distinction between corporeal and incor poreal. The Biblical God?the God of the whole Christian Bible?is the God of love, the God Who is the source of all forms of love. Our human loves?of God, of our country, of our friends, of our family, of the truth?point toward a God who recognizes and secures our significance as a particular person made in his image that he chooses, whatever our shortcomings, to know and love. Our erotic longing, in truth, points in the direction of such a God, and not in the direction of an impersonal natural necessity in which my very being and so eros itself fades away. For particular persons?irreducibly and ineradicably erotic "whos"?God, too must be a "Who," or not merely another "what." It seems to me to make more sense to say that the highest level of our eros points toward knowledge of such a person, that we are incurably directed toward a personal God whether or not there is such a God. Only if God is a "Who" can we preserve the truth about ourselves as unique and particular beings or "whos" or not merely "whats." Pangle is right to say that sexual eros, considered by itself, connects us more with the other animals than with God. Birds do it and bees do it, and we do it too. But even our sexual eros is trans formed by our self-consciousness, and human eros, of course, is polymorphous as a result. Both the goodness and the incompleteness of the var ious forms of human love point beyond themselves. No human friendship, for example, achieves the transparency of how I appear before God. The real but limited and somewhat distorted human powers of knowing and loving show us who God would have to be like. So our longing for God ennobles and purifies our eros, and it even, as Pope Benedict XVI explains in his recent encyclical on God's love, obliterates the unnecessary theological distinction between eros and agape. Our love of God is never severed from its erotic connection with the other forms of human love, and love itself is never transcended in favor of something impersonal or higher. It is impossible genuinely to know God without loving Him, without discovering that, contrary to our anxious suspicions, our erotic imagination is sustained by more than illusion. One of the genuine innovations of the Bible is its emphasis that the most wonderful thing in the universe is not the stars or heaven but us. This disenchantment or dedivinization of the subhuman natural world elevated us as the natural and more than natural beings most deserving of the deepest reflection, and only we are deserving of special dignity and reverence. We, not the heavens, are closest to God, because we, not the stars, know that we are not God. That innovation also emerges, in a different and arguably less complete way, in the famous Socratic turn?the change of Socrates from the natural scientist mocked by Aristophanes to the political philosopher most of all concerned with the human soul lovingly portrayed by Plato. Natural science?the heavens and the earth?has nothing to say, the Bible and the mature Socrates agree, about how human beings should live with one another. And it has nothing to say about the uniquely human free quest for perfection that culminates in some way or another in God. The Bible's account of the whole human person under God and Socrates's ascent from the questions that animate moral and political life of a mind also reflect two fundamental ways of explaining why human beings should be at home with their homelessness, two explanations of how human beings destabi lize what might otherwise be regarded as a perfect natural order. Neither presents whole human beings (as opposed to If there is anything like a personal God, it would be the Socratic politi cal philosopher, that being who exists in his purity only in the Platonic dialogues and beyond any of our experience... 6 The Good Society</page><page sequence="5">ON RELIGION AND POLITICS unrealistically disembodied minds) as fully at home in this world. In both cases, we see that neither physics nor biology can account for all the diverse ways human beings seem not to be governed by impersonal necessity?for why we have not only physicists and philosophers, but priests and poets and presidents and princes and even parents who consciously love and even willingly step aside for their children. The Socratic political philosopher liberates his mind by seeing through the moral, political and religious illusions that allow human beings confidently to experience themselves as at home as whole persons. The philosophers' experience is that the human mind is at home in the world, but only by experiencing themselves as depending for their existence on bodies that exist for a moment nowhere in particular and are gone. So being at home somehow both depends upon and does not depend upon abstracting from the limitations of our embodiment. Or perhaps more precisely, knowing why my mind at home, as Pangle says, produces both joy and melancholy: My being at home depends upon the most radical conceivable homelessness of a being who experiences his mortality all the way down. Any being that appears to us to be eternal?such as the stars?can't possibly know anything at all. Only a being that is absolutely mortal could know the truth about the stars and the truth about the insignificance of himself. Pangle puts a lot of weight on the issue of whether God was limited by preexisting natural necessity or whether he created the world out of nothing. He rightly concludes that the Bible and even key church fathers waffle on the issue. So does Leon Kass in his great book on Genesis, but Kass adds that the waffling is evidence that the Bible is reasonable and trustworthy. The truth is, in Kass's view, that the two competing possibilities concerning origins?that the world is eternal and the world is created?both present seemingly insuperable problems to the human mind. And so the Bible's implicit teaching is something like, as Kass says in a footnote, "God knows what happened before the Big Bang." The universe that we experience as intelligible is not, in fact, eternal. And we don't know whether God literally made the world out of nothing or shaped preexisting stuff of some sort? maybe by managing the Big Bang in a certain way?into the largely intelligible and maybe teleological world we now experi ence. Even if we can answer the question why is there being rather than nothing at all with God, we still can't fathom the questions why or how in the case of God. Kass is pretty unconcerned, in part, about the big details concerning creation because he knows a mystery when he sees one. But he also does so because his analysis takes it for granted that human beings, after the fall, are self-conscious mortals. And he even presents what the Christians call the fall as actually an ascent, because Adam and Eve, in effect, come to see what they always were, and they come to experience all the psychological characteristics that come with experiencing the truth about themselves?such as shame guilt, anger, love of other persons, and fear and anxiety in the face of death. And they come to see that their longing for the simplicity of bodily or psychic wholeness is constantly undermined by their corrosive self consciousness; they come to see that their greatness and misery as mortals comes from being more than either bodies or minds. So beginning with Adam and Eve creatures can't help but shamefully experience the gap between their ideal ized self-understanding and the flawed reality of how they actually live. And we can't close that gap, the psychology of the Bible suggests, by experiencing ourselves basically as minds at home in the intelligible world God made. Whether we are flawed mortals simply through God's will or through the Creator's mysterious semi-dependence on natural necessity is not that important for Kass. Pangle agrees, finally, that our origins are shrouded in mystery, and even that the philosophers speak of the world's eternity mainly to protect themselves or their activity from all that is implied in the idea of creation. The philosophers don't care whether or not the world is actually eternal, they just want it to be fixed enough to be intelligible or not dependent on the unfathomable will of any particular person. They want the world, in other words, to be governed by impersonal necessity in order that their minds, as Strauss says, can be at home there. The world as we experience it was here before we as individuals and as species got here, and it will be here after all of us disappear. Eternal just means what is before, during, and after all that is human or transitory in the precise sense. The idea of eternity safeguards the philosophic insight that we know for certain that we're not eternal. Better than the Bible, in Pangle's view, the philosophers and those influenced by the philosophers have understood that God's promise to redeem me from the necessity of my particular death depends upon creation ex nihilo. Unlike Kass, he has the Christian Bible in mind, its connection between creation and the resurrection; like the Enlightenment thinkers, his real target seems to be the idea of particular providence. Only if God created the world out of nothing?and so if all of being were simply subject to his unfathomable will?does it make sense to say that he really could provide each human being what St. Augustine says they most desire: eternal life. For Pangle, the most important implication of this possibility is that the world would no longer be the home of the human mind. Even the distinction between what happens by nature and what is a miracle would disappear. Everything that happens would be a miracle and so, strictly speaking, nothing would be a miracle. There would be no point of view discoverable by the human mind that would allow any intellectual resistance at all to blind submission to whatever God decides or commands to happen. The price of eternal life?the granting of which is the complete Volume 15, Number 3, 2007 7</page><page sequence="6">FEATURED ARTICLES overcoming of the fixed and intelligible natural necessity that the philosophers think really governs our lives?is every pretense of rational independence and even moral coherence. For the philosopher, the humility that makes possible this blind obedience to the Creator's will is a sham. Most deeply, the affirmation of revelation's truth is based on incredible vanity: The Creator of all that exists cares about and secures my partic ular existence forever. If Mansfield is right that men are manly or spirited because they can't help but want to be important as individuals, then the claim of particular providence is, in fact, manliness run amok. As Strauss explains, the philosopher's humble opinion is that nobody cares whether he lives or dies but himself and a few friends. And to be a philosopher, in part, is to purge oneself of one's manliness or to be ok with that fact of his personal insignificance. The truest courage transcends every manly claim for self-importance. That deconstruction of the Biblical virtue of humility has always given me pause: But it's also true that men (and women too) can't help but want to be important, and without a personal God they're condemned to live without any reliable evidence that they are. And even manly men, of course, can't help but want to be loved. Surely the philosophers' claim that they are somehow the reliable sources of their own happiness is manliness run even more amok, as St. Augustine notes. The philosophers may think they've come completely to terms with human mortality, but maybe not with the sheer contingency of all that is human, including all that is good about being human. More generally, we have to say that Pangle downplays the upside of experiencing oneself as the creature of a providential Creator. It's surely good to know that one's particularly existence was willed as something good and so not accidental or insignificant. And it might even be possible to presume that the capabilities God provided me for my benefit?such as the mind?are in good working order and meant to be used. Not many creatures, it seems to me, have experi enced the alternatives between blind obedience and rational independence as starkly as Pangle presents it. The theological psychology by the Bible is that of a flawed being still open in many ways to the truth about his situation, and it's just not true that the orthodox Jewish and Catholic traditions really are full of the thought that God demands the radical sacrifice of the intellect. What He demands is that I tell the truth to myself about myself as a particular being who can't be reduced to either body or mind. Pangle says, seemingly with alarm, that genuine belief in revelation's truth threatens the understanding of nature and nature's God that is at the foundation of "natural rights" and our liberal democracies. That fact would be news to our evangelicals, and even to many of the men who signed a Declaration of Independence that talks about a providential and judgmental Creator. But I have to agree that the Nature's God of the Enlightenment philosophers was, in their eyes, impersonal natural necessity. But even for Locke, for exam ple, it still makes sense to speak of a Creator, if only because of the mysteri ous liberty that allows human individu als alone to improve upon or move away from what they've been given by nature. Locke adds that only suckers think of themselves as creatures or fundamen tally dependent on a providential God who guarantees us eternal life. Locke's fundamental message, of course, is that we're stuck with providing for ourselves. We must wonder whether the philosophers' opinion that we are completely or eternally governed by fixed principles of impersonal natural necessity can really capture the free individual?the indi vidual who has the right creatively to free himself from his natural limitations. Can?even on Lockean terms?what distinguishes the free human individual from everything else that exists in the visible universe really be captured by the thought that the world is the home of the human mind? Our modern or enlightened doctrine also includes our faith in the uniqueness or genuinely individuality or true dignity of each particular human being, and I'm not sure how the God of the philosophers does anything but undermine that self conception. The truth about or even the pretensions of free and dignified persons, as well as the truth about their invincible flaws and limitations, point in the direction of a personal God. Peter Augustine Lawler is Dana Professor and Chair of the Department of Government and International Studies at Berry College. Only if God created the world our of nothing?and so if all of being were simply subject to his unfathomable will?does it make sense to say that he really could provide each human being what St. Augustine says they most desire: eternal life. 8 The Good Society</page></plain_text>
