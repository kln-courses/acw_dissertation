A complete apparatus criticus is not given here, but I have attempted to provide, in my anno tations to each entry, an indication of the extent of any revi sion, if any.

But chief blest spirit now thy influence try, To move the powers of Europe in that cause For which thy champion* toil'd through many a year - The cause of Africa's much-injur'd sons!

And thou my native land, whose honour'd name, Whose welfare to my heart will still be dear, Unwearied be thy patience and thy seal, And firm thy voice against that barb'rous trade, The curse of Afric, Europe's foul disgrace, That the great Power who doth delight in mercy May approve - and if again to sweep the earth, War's dreadful whirlwind in its fury rise, He may preserve thee in the evil day. ♦Clarkson 123</page><page sequence="7">REFLECTIONS ON LEAVING THE THE INQUIRY VICINITY OF PENRITH Wilt thou young shepherd tell me why Ye flowering mountains, clad with hovering mist, Sleeps so long thy plaintive lyre, The rugged guardians of these lovely plains, Say have those long continued rains, The fertile, fair, Arcadia of the West - That drench'd the mountains, steep'd the plains, Ye lofty woods, environing with shade Fast pouring from a sky Warm sunny glades and pleasant meadows green - Quench'd the beams of Phoebus fire. And thou impetuous Lowther, rushing swift By Carlton's groves, and gay Elysian meads, Through Yanwath's woods, and Dalemain's sweet retreat, And climb Dunmallet's woody cone, to gaze On the blue curling waters of the lake: Oft will she visit those delightful plains Or, is it that the stormy gale, Barb'd with frost; which sweeps the earth, To thee, as to the year unkind, Chills the warm fervors of thy mind, Thro' shadowy glens, beneath o'erhanging rocks, To join sweet Eamont's softly winding stream, And mix thy mountain-torrent's foaming waves With the smooth waters of its crystal tide: Till fancy's emanations fail, Oh mountains, woods, and streams, but just beheld ur.i- -, , . . . r .

And all its playful smiles are fled, JSaddleback. How great the anguish of a mother! 124</page><page sequence="8">Should animating health, no more Crushing the year's first honours in their birth, Its fast declining frame restore, Fly with the whirlwind on its swift career, When the last fatal hour is o'er, And quickly end thy stormy race o'er earth. Ah! who would wish to be a mother? Uncertain April, with thy frequent showers, The storm succeeded by the sunny gleam, WRITTEN ON HELSINGTON COMMON, Soften the dods which shield ^ embryo flowers, IN THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER And call them forth to share the tepid beam. Bleak rugged bank, behind whose rocky heights, Swell the young germs of spring, unfold the buds, So oft I've seen the orb of day descend, Scatter the verdant tufts the vales among, Tinging with purple yon continguous vale, Expand the gay, green foliage of the woods, Rich with luxuriant Autumn's varied glow. But, tearful April, do not tarry long. How chang'd the valley! all its honours gone, .. n_ -, . . r _ , i . u Roll on ye months, unwearied by your speed, While thy rude features scarce have lost a charm, ' ' ' r _, , , . r i xi , , Till comes your queen, the sweet enchanting May, Though now the last of pale November s suns / i • ° ' , . . , , , , , , Those distant 'fairy featur'd' vales to tread, Sheds its pale lustre o er thy dusky brow; ' , Where hope directs my willing feet to stray. Still the dwarf Juniper, low creeping shrub, r ' ° ' Its dark deep verdure unimpair'd retains, May no rude blasts, no chilling gales arise And light elastic mosses round it spring, To blight her verdure, and her blooms destroy; Fresh as if cherish'd by the vernal day; Warm be her suns, unclouded be her skies, The sable Yew firm rooted in the rock, That I may share in Nature's general joy. Waves its dun foliage in the sweeping gale, The glossy Holly with its barbed leaves, PATTERDALE The clasping Ivy winding round its stem, 'Mid Western mountains far away, When mingled with their shining clusters gay, Where soft the star of evening gleams, Of crimson berries, will compose for thee, g'assy lakes and silver streams, A glowing garland through the winter months. A mild and melancholy ray. To what shall I compare the rugged hill? A lovely vale, deep bosom'd lies, To the uncultur'd rude yet dauntless mind, Of mountain dales the matchless queen, That litde mov'd by pleasure or by pain, A gem of softest, brightest green, Can meet the storms of fortune undismay'd; Beneath those cloudy northern skies. And thou disrobed valley - once so fair, .. .. . . _ .

The feeling heart can taste on earth, but ah! Proudly they rise to meet the storm, Whose fury threatens her repose, And their stern, rock-crown'd brows oppose, In many a rude and vary'd form. Too sensible of ill - when Hope's bright sun Has nurtur'd and unfolded all its charms, Then should misfortune's dreadful winter come, The shrinking spirit droops beneath the storm, And to the threat'ning ruin, yields like thee. ^ut w^en t^le storm is hush d to rest, And o'er the wild and lovely scene UNTITLED The gladsome sun looks forth serene, ("Cold, joyless February, dark and drear") And earth in robes is drest Cold, joyless February, dark and drear, Then every steep and rugged pile Enrapt in sombre clouds, thy gloomy day; Throws by its frown and threat'ning air, The drizzling sleet, still hovering in the air, And on this lovely valley fair, Oh, speed thee on thy tardy course away. Looks with a fond parental smile. Rough, boisterous March, a bold rude charioteer, Their darling and their pride is she, 125</page><page sequence="9">The vale that's cradled in their arms - Exulting in her matchless charms, They wave their woods with joyous glee. The sun in all his mighty round, Where'er his radiant beams are shed, On lowly plain or mountain's head, A lovelier scene has never found. The Spring in all her long career, May visit many a verdant isle, To bless it with her genial smile, Yet spot more beauteous or more dear, Than this sweet dale, she has not seen; Nor from the bounty of her store, Has given one sweeter, fairer, flower, Or tint of lovelier, livelier, green, Or ought that might more charming be, To other vales - but all around This little spot of fiairy ground, Has strew'd her choicest favours free. To me, like magic visions fair, Of which an image would be faint, Sublime above my power to paint, Sweet lonely dale, thy features were. Like the wild wonders of a dream, Which strike with sudden, strong, surprise, Then vanish from our ravish'd eyes, Did thy romantic features seem. Scarce from astonishment awoke, And silent raptures of delight, Ere like enchantment from my sight Thy scenes were gone - the spell was broke. And who from views like thine could part? From views that fill th' astonished mind, With high-ton'd feelings undefin'd, And feel no sorrow at the heart. I gave thee my adieus in sighs, As fast retreating from the shore, Each motion of the dashing oar, Remov'd thee further from my eyes. Yet long will shadowy forms remain, Of views, majestic all, and wild, Around thee, Nature's favorite child, Lone Eden, of her mountain reign. And oft o'er memory's magic glass, When sleep, her opiate, tries in vain, The powers of fancy to restrain, In wild confusion will they pass. NOTES 'For more on Harrison, see Dorothy Wordsworth, The Grasmere Journals ed. Pamela Woof (1991), p. 19, and my "William and Doro thy Wordsworth and Anthony Harrison's Poetical Recreations," N and Q 43 (March, 1996) 32-3. 2There was also a review of the volume in the Monthly Review 76 (1815) 211. These correct Jonathan Wordsworth who says in his In troduction to the welcome Woodstock facsimile of Poetical Effusions, "There was no acclaim for Poetical Effusions in 1814." sThe Quaker poet, Thomas Wilkinson of Yanwath, published his Elegy, on the Death of Miss Elizabeth Smith, in the Westmorland. Adver tiser for August 3, 1811 (Vol. 1, No. 6). That Lickbarrow knew Wil kinson is clear from Occasioned by Reading T. Wilkinson's Elegy on Life (PE 91-2), and it is likely that she had read his tribute to Smith. Smith's work was also known to Wordsworth, another friend of Wilkinson's. 4The occasion of these lines was news of Napoleon's resigna tion from the throne, announced in Paris on April 6, and reported in the Westmorland Advertiser of April 16; Lickbarrow had evidently been told the news by the editor of the Advertiser and was offered the opportunity to write an occasional poem to mark the event. Its occa sional nature probably discouraged her from including it in PE. 126</page></plain_text>
