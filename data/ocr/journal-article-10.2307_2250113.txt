Peirce in 1914, at the age of 74, his unpublished manuscripts came into the care of the Department of Philosophy of Harvard University. A selection of these, together with his published papers (about 75 in number), his book-reviews, and his letters, are now being published by the Harvard University Press in some ten volumes, which are appearing at the rate of one about every eight months. Volume I. contains the outline of Peirce's system of philosophy, together with his remarks on " General Historical Orientation ", on the classification of the sciences, and on ethics. Volume II. contains his work on what would be called general or philosophical logic-the function of logic as a study, the theory of signs, traditional syllogistic logic and Peirce's important writings on probability and induction. Volume III. contains his published papers on formal or symbolic logic, which include the work on the logic of relatives which has won him an important place in the history of the subject. Volume IV. contains his unpublished papers on formal logic, and on the foundations of mathematics: these include Peirce's scheme of " existential graphs ", which he took to be his " chef d'ceuvre ". Volume V. contains all the papers which are relevant to the claim made on his behalf by James to be considered the founder of pragmatism: they show that his "pragmaticism " differed in many ways from the doctrines of James or of Schiller.' Volume VI., we are told, will be concerned with metaphysics; and the remaining volumes will contain his writings on psychology and physics (Peirce was for some time on the staff of the United States Coast Survey, and many of the papers deal with the determination of gravity by pendulum experiments), his reviews, letters and biography. When 1 Volume V: Pragmatism and Pragmaticism, 1934.

To judge from the accounts given of the mass and confusion of Peirce's unpublished papers, the editing of the " Collected Papers " must have been about as difficult as any task of editing can be; and Dr. Hartshorne and Dr. Weiss have earned our gratitude by the success with which they (with the assistance of members of the Harvard Philosophical Department and others) have carried out their task. The manuscripts left by Peirce were in all stages of completeness: they included drafts on the same subject written at different times (sometimes the date could not be discovered or in- ferred), and the editors have had to select the material for the volumes so as to include most of the good passages which he wrote. Thus a certain amount of repetition has been unavoidable. More- over, few of Peirce's papers deal with one point only: he was a great enough philosopher to see that most philosophical problems are connected with other philosophical problems; so he treats of the same subject (e.g., his doctrine of signs) in a great number of contexts. This has made the arrangement of the papers exceedingly difficult; and I imagine that the editors' difficulty was increased by the practical necessity for publishing the volumes at different times. The first volume contains papers on a strange variety of subjects whose, bond of union seems to be that they are not specifically concerned with logic; but the justification for this is presumably that the volume appearing first had to convey a general impression of Peirce's manner of thinking, and in this it is very successful. I was distressed to find only three, of the famous six articles on " Illus- trations of the Logic of Science " which originally appeared in Popular Science Monthly (1877-78) and were republished in Chance Love and Logic (1923), collected in the discussion of induction in Volume II. But I realise that it was necessary to save two of these articles for Volume V. if this volume was to include everything that Peirce wrote germane to pragmatism. If all the papers could have been published simultaneously, another classification might have been possible and desirable: granted successive publication, the editors have probably made the best of a very nasty job, and have shown considerable patience and ingenuity in fitting together the mosaic. G But there is one feature of the edition which I do criticise : the biography is postponed till a late volume, so that we know very few of the facts of Peirce's life. This is not merely my vulgar curiosity .(although a person presented with a million words of a philosopher has surely the right to have even this satisfied). For anyone reading Peirce's manuscripts, where very "lhard-headed" statements and reasonable argumentation are sprinkled and sometimes swamped with fantastic suggestions, will feel how much his work would have gained had he been subjected to the continual criticism of</page><page sequence="3">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers qf Peirce. 489 intelligent students. When Peirce says, for example, that though " I am a determined foe to no innocent number; I respect and esteem them all in their several ways ", yet " I am forced to confess to a leaning to, the number Three in philosophy" (1.355), one feels that he should have heard the ribald laughter which seems fitting to that remark. And though his style is most obscure and involved when he is treating of what he thinks are the most difficult matters, at other places he writes so well that one cannot believe that he could not have improved the obscure parts if he had been writing for an audience. For both these reasons, therefore, I thiink it was a great misfortune that Peirce taught at a university for a few years only; and my curiosity is aroused as to why his great gifts were not thus used. If, as is rumoured, the reason for this had nothing to do with intellectual capacity, we should have been told this: otherwise one is tempted either to criticise Peirce for an inability to adapt himself to the needs of students or to condemn American universities for not having employed a most stimulating teacher. Both these criticisms are probably beside the mark; and I hope that the biography, wheii it appears, will dispel what is to me a mystery. It should be mentioned that the editors have done the routine work of editing extremely well. Every paragraph is numbered (3.647 means the 647th paragraph of Volume III.), and the volumes are excellently indexed and cross-referenced. In my considerable use of these references I have found only three or four mistakes: the only one worth mentioning is " Keynes, J. M." for " Keynes, J. N." in the indexes to Volumes III. and IV. Helpful footnotes have been added, and in Volume III. (which contains the published papers on symbolic logic) a supplementary table of contents has been prepared to einable a reader used to modern terminology to find his way about the book. I have heard it complained that the editors have not paid sufficient attention to chronological order in their arrangement of the unpublished manuscripts. But most of Peirce's views, even the inconsistent ones, he held all his life: elements of his later doctrines are to be found in his earliest papers; and I think the editors were right in classifying according to subject instead of according to date. The date of every paragraph that the editors know can be ascertained (though one sometimes has to turn over several pages to find it). I miss thei dates on the admirable photo- graphs serving as frontispieces to Volumes I. and V.: the former photograph shows a resemblance to W. K. Clifford, whom I fancy Peirce was like in many ways. If the editing of the " Collected Papers " must have been exceed- ingly difficult to the editors, their reviewing is not easy. Even were it desirable, it would not be within my powers to pass systematically in review the whole contents of these four volumes, expounding and criticising all the topics in a manner worthy of MIND. So, after ,some very short remarks on Peirce's general philosophy and on his 32</page><page sequence="4">490 CRITICAL NOTICES: work on symbolic logic, I shall treat at more length the two most important parts of Peirce's work on general logic-his theory of signs and his theory of probability and induction. These doctrines display very well Peirce's weakness and strength as a logician. Peirce's Philosophy.-Only a selection of papers dealing with Peirce's metaphysics has been published in Volume I.; the remainder will appear in Volume VI.: so we are not yet in a position to pass judgement upon Peirce's system. Peirce classifies the things which are in any way present to the mind (phanerons) into three categories, which he calls by the non-committal names of Firstness, Secondness, Thirdness. The category of Firstness includes " qualities of feeling, such as the colour of magenta, the sound of a railway whistle, the taste of quinine, the quality of the emotion upon contemplating a fine mathematical demonstration, the quality of feeling of love, etc." (1.304). These are all possibilities, not actualities: they need not "inhere" in a subject: they are the universalia ante res of the scholastic realists (Peirce greatly admired Duns Scotus). Secondness comprises the actual facts of the world-the hic et nunc of things. (Peirce never distinguished between particular existents and facts.) Secondness comes before the mind as the " element of struggle ": it is involved in the consciousness of otherness, of action and reaction, of volition. Thirdness includes the meaning of signs, the conception of general laws, " infinity, continuity, diffusion, growth, and intelli- gence " (1.340). It is the category that is concerned with connecting, and it is involved in all reflective thought. Peirce's three categories start by beiing phenomenological categories, and perhaps because of this his metaphysics of nature, with its struggle and something analogous to thought, seems very anthropomorphic. Peirce is thoroughly aware of this; and defends himself boldly by saying that " other things being equal, an anthropomorphic conception, whether it makes the best nucleus for a scientific working hypothesis or not, is far more likely to be approximately true than one that is not anthropomorphic " (5.47 n.). Volume I. includes a short section on the Normative Sciences: most of what Peirce wrote on this subject was in connection with pragmatism and logic and occurs in Volumes II. and V. " The fundamental problem of ethics is, What am I prepared deliberately to accept as the statement of what I want to do ? . . . Now logic is a study of the means of attaining the end of thought. It cannot solve that problem until it clearly knows what that end is.... It is, therefore, impossible to be thoroughly and rationally logical except upon an ethical basis " (2.198). But Peirce admits that a logician must be on his guard against being " over-influenced by the moral spirit "; and declares that what was " at the root of the barbarism of the Plantaganet period and paralysed the awakening of science from the days of Roger Bacon to those of Francis Bacon " was "the exaggerated interest men took in matters of vital import- ance (1.675). For " all sensible talk about vitally important</page><page sequence="5">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 491 topics must be commonplace, all reasoning about them unsound, and all study of them narrow and sordid " (1.677). Symbolic Logic.-It would be impossible to give an adequate account of Peirce's published contributions to symbolic or " exact " logic (as he liked to call it) much more shortly than is given in the admirable 28 pages devoted to Peirce in Lewis's Survey of Symbolic Logic. I will only mention, therefore, the four things which class Peirce with Boole as co-founders of mathematical logic as it is understood to-day: (1) the use of inclusion as the most important notion, (2) the application of the algebra of logic to propositions by limiting the values of the variables to 0 and 1, (3) the purification of the algebra of extraneous arithmetical elements (Peirce's progress in this direction can be seen by comparing the paper of 1870, in which logarithms and differentials occur, with those of 1882-85), and (4) the development of a logic of relatives, i.e., of propositional functions of more than one variable. In this connection Peirce developed the notion of variable, of definition in extension and of the relations between (ax) (y) . q (x, y) and (y): (ax) . b (x, y) almost in the form (though with quite a different notation) to 'be found in Principia Mathematica thirty years later. The great defect of Peirce's work is that he hardly ever proves anything; compared with Schroder's or Whitehead and Russell's work, his papers seem merely preliminary sketches. But his originality and subtlety are manifest throughout, and his shrewd comments on, for example, what is now known as " material implication " (which he refers back to Philo of Megara) are well worth study to-day. He was also thoroughly imbued with the modern conception of exact logic as a calculus. There is one point which I should like to mention, because I have not seen it referred to by other commentators. It is surprising that the inventor (after De Morgan) of the Logic of Relatives would not admit of any unanalysable relations of a higher order than the third. I cannot help thinking that his main reason for this intolerance was that his metaphysics did not allow any place for Fourthness. But he gives a formal reason for it which is worth examining: I give it in my own words. Every tetradic relationship can be analysed in terms of two triadic relationships : thus " A sells B to C for the price D " may be analysed into " There is a transaction E such that A enters into E with C and such that E is the sale of B for the price D " (1.363).1 Similarly, relationships of higher orders can be analysed into triadic relationships by the introduction of one or more extra terms. The objection is that this procedure, however symbolically convenient, cannot be justified as a logical analysis in most cases: the meaning of " transaction " presupposes an under- standing of the original tetradic relationship which is supposed to be explained by it. The extraordinary thing is that Peirce uses this very argument against A. B. Kempe, who formally analysed triadic re- lationships in exactly the same way as that in which Peirce analyses 1 On 1. 8 of p. 188 the " C " and " B " are transposed.</page><page sequence="6">492 CRITICAL NOTICES: tetradic relationships (3.423). Peirce cannot have it both ways. If the question is that of representing propositions in a diagram of spots connected by lines, only lines connecting two spots (corresponding to dyadic relations) are required, and Peirce's triadic relations are superfluous. But, as Peirce says, " the difference between setting down spots in a diagram to represent recognised objects, and making new spots for the creations of logical thought, is huge " (3.424) ; and if we are not permitted to do this latter, Peirce's elimination of tetradic and higher relations is impossible. In Volume IV., besides an interesting anticipation of Sheffer in a paper of about 1880, " A Boolian Algebra with One Constant," there are a number of papers and notes upon the foundations of mathematics which I think repay study. Peirce was well aware of the importance of Cantor's work on infinite numbers; but as he observes, " there are in Cantor's exposition of his ordinal numbers several points which will give the unmathematical student difficulty, not because he lacks intelligence, but because he thinks so exactly as to see the difficulties, while not being sufficiently acquainted with the subtleties of mathematics he is unable to solve them " (4.677). Now that the exact meaning of the mathematical subtleties is being doubted by the finitists, Peirce's acute commentary is not at all out of date. In many places Peirce discusses the question as to whether cardinal number is logically prior to ordinal number or vice versa, and decides in favour of ordinal number: here he is in agreement with the modern revolt against the Cantor-Frege-Russell orthodoxy. In this connection it may be noted that in his treatment of the general proposition in a logical sum and logical product symbolism, Peirce emphasises that general propositions are only similar to a sum or to a product; "they are not strictly of that nature, because the individuals of the universe may be innumerable" (3.393). Readers of Peirce's papers will find that not only did he discover independently (and sometimes first) many famous theorems in the theory of finite and infinite number, but that he was more conscious of the proper philosophical difficulties than most of his contemporaries. It is here as much as in any other part of his work that I regret that he did not publish a systematic treatise. A great part of Volume IV. is devoted to Peirce's system of Exis- tential Graphs, a form of logical diagram which Peirce considered his " chef d'oeuvre " and the purpose of which is " to study the workings of necessary inference " by " representing diagrammatically any possible set of premisses, this diagram to be such that we can observe the transformation of these premisses into the conclusion by a series of steps each of the utmost possible simplicity " (4.429). I regret that I have not been able to study the system sufficiently to venture an opinion upon its importance, but I have seen enough to commend its examination to those interested in " exact logic ".</page><page sequence="7">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 493 PEIRCE ON SIGNS. The papers of Peirce upon the theory of signs which the editors have thought worth preserving are to be mostly found in Volume II., Book II., and Volume IV., Book II. For the most part these very short papers have not been previously published, they vary in date between 1867 and 1910, they are deeply interfused with Peirce's meta- physic, and they are not completely consistent either in doctrine or in terminology. The editors inform us, moreover, that the letters to Lady Welby of 1906, which have not yet been published, contain certain complications of the doctrine and divide signs into 66 classes instead of the 10 classes of'the papers in these earlier volumes. So I shall only be able to discuss what seem to me the main features of Peirce's account, and I shall do this independently of his meta- physical presuppositions. Peirce defines what he means by " sign " in different ways in different places: the definition he gives in Baldwin's Dictionary is typical:-" Anything which determines something else (its interpretant) to refer to an object to which- itself refers (its object) in the same way, the interpretant becoming- in turn a sign, and so on ad infinitum " (2.303: similar definitions are given in 1.541, 2.242 and 2.274). Let us, to begin with, ignore all after the first comma and consider what Peirce means by " determine " and by " refer ". Though he nowhere explicitly discusses the meaning or meanings of determination, I think that he is meaning here and in similar contexts " causally determine ". If this is so, Peirce is thinking of a sign from the point of view of its hearer or reader or interpreter: the sign is something given in advance of its interpretation and acts upon its interpreter. Peirce is not thinking of a sign as essen- tially something made by the speaker or writer in order to signify: he thinks of it as something whose significance is to be iriterpreted. Since every sign made or used by a person is intended to act as a sign to some interpreter, either himself or some one else (see 4.551), Peirce's emphasis on the role of the hearer would be unexceptionable if it did not, I think, lead him into neglecting sometimes the equal importance of the speaker. There is more difficulty about Peirce's use of the phrase " refer to ". Sometimes he uses it as synonymous with "being determined by ". In one place he goes so far as to define "a sign, stretching that word to its widest limits, as anything which, being determined by an object, determines an interpretation to determination, through it, by the same object " (4.531). If " determination " means " causal determination " Peirce's " sign " would here be similar to Ogden and Richards' "stimulus similar to some part of an original stimulus and sufficient to call up an excitation similar to that caused by the original stimulus " (The Meaning of Meaning, p. 140). I will call a theory which describes the functioning of signs purely in causal terms without bringing in any intention to use a sign in a particular</page><page sequence="8">494 CRITICAL NOTICES: way, a " naturalistic " theory of signs. It is, of course, held by materialists, who would eliminate the specifically mental element everywhere, but it would also be held by dualists who wished to retain only sensation and feeling as mental elements and to analyse thought causally. A great deal of Peirce's writing is consistent with his taking a naturalistic or, indeed, a behaviouristic, view of signs. When he has to speak of " a mind " in connection with signs, he frequently adds " or a Quasi-mind " (4.550, see 2.274, 1.540), and suggests that it is only out of consideration for the weakness of his readers that he brings in human minds at all. And some of the passages in Peirce's metaphysics would agree with Firstness, Second- ness and Thirdness being considered as materialistic categories. Nevertheless I do not think that a naturalistic theory of signs is adopted by Peirce. His metaphysics on the whole is not materialistic: indeed, it ma-y with more reason be criticised as too anthropomorphic. Moreover, his whole account of signs is saturated with words like " represent ", " stand for ", which clearly presuppose the intention of a mind. In Baldwin's Dictionary Peirce defines " to represent " as " to be in such a relation to amother that for certain purposes it is treated by that mind as if it were that other " (2.273). So I think that the sense in which the sign refers to its object is that it is intended by a mind to stand for that object, this relation being the essential and peculiar characteristic of symbolic thought. In this sense it is nonsense to talk of a sign referring to its object without an allusion, explicit or implicit, to the mind which is doing the referring. " Sign " is usually used in some such sense as this by logicians, and I shall call it the " logical " theory of signs. Though Peirce sometimes expresses himself in a naturalistic way, I think that fundamentally he held a form of the logical theory. That he did so is also supported by his doctrine, difficult to interpret naturalistically, that the functioning of a sign requires the creation of a new sign, its interpretant, which refers to the object in the same way as that in which the original sign referred to it. The sort of situation of which he is thinking is where I hear and understand a sentence spoken by you with the intention of communicating some fact to me. Then, if the communication is successful, the fact to which I take the sentence as I hear it to refer is the same as the fact to which you took the sentence as you spoke it to refer. Whether or not the actual sign used by you is the same as the actual sign used by me depends on whether by " sentence " is meant the physical event or the set of private sense-data (and also upon one's view as to the relation of sense-data to physical events) ; but these are subsidiary questions: my understanding the sign used by me is certainly differ- ent from your understanding the sign used by you, and it is of this that Peirce was thinking when he said that the former (the inter- pretant) was different from but determined by the latter. So far, so good. But Peirce insists at the end of his definition of " sign " that the second sign (the interpretant) determines a third</page><page sequence="9">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 495 sign which in its turn determines a fourth sign, and so on ad infinitum. If " determines " is taken categorically, this would mean that in every case of the use of signs there was an infinite series of signs which were interpretants of the sign next earlier in the series. There is no reason to suppose that this occurs. For even if it were neces- sary in Peirce's metaphysical system for every interpretant to determine another interpretant, there is no reason, so far as I can see, why the interpretant of the interpretant should not be the original sign itself. But in fact Peirce makes it clear in many places that by "to determine " in these contexts he only means " to be capable of determining" (see 2.274, 1.542). So all the irxfinite series comes to is that there may be an infinite number of signs which might function as interpretants of one another. This is harmless enoughl: perhaps it is a bad way of stating the important fact, which is the basis of the logical theory of signs, that any sign can be used in place of any other sign if the interpreter uses them with the same meaning. Peirce has other infinite series of signs which are equally harmless if his statements are taken merely as statemernts of logical possibility. In 1.339 he says that the object of the sign can be nothing but a sign of which the first sign is the interpretant: this only makes sense, I think, if it means that the object can be used as the sign of another object. In 2.274 he says that the relation of the original sign to its object is an object of which the original interpretant is a sign. If this means that I can think of my thinking of an object by means of a sign, and that I can then think of this thinking, and so on, well and good: if it means that in every actual case I do think of my thinking, and think of my thinking of my thinking, etc., it is fantastic. Indeed in his definitions of " sign " in 2.242 and 2.274, Peirce only speaks of the triadic relation of the sign to the object and the interpretant as being " capable of determining the interpretant " or as " determining a possible interpretant ". He adds that- " while no [Sign] actually functions as such until it actually deter- mines an Interpretant, yet it becomes a [Sign] as soon as it is fully capable of doing this; and its Representative Quality is not neces- sarily dependent upon its ever actually determining an Interpretant, nor even upon its actually having an Object " (2.275). But this would deprive " sign " of every vestige of distinctive meaning: if a sign need neither stand for an object nor signify for a person, there is no point in using the notion at all. Anything can be used as a sign for anything: Peirce's discussion and classification is only of value if he is discussing those signs which are actually used by speakers or writers to communicate their meaning. In Volume II. Peirce makes a tenfold classification of signs which is based upon three fundamental trichotomies. I shall not discuss this tenfold classification, because the system all hangs on the three fundamental trichotomies which I think are themselves open</page><page sequence="10">496 CRITICAL NOTICES: to criticism. The three trichotomies depend upon dividing signs according to three principles each of which yields three sorts of sign. The three principles of division are in the nature of the sign itself, in the relation of the sign to its object, and in what the sign is taken to represent. I will consider the three trichotomies in turn. The Sign Itself.-According to Peirce, a sign is (1) a mere quality, a Qualisign or Tone, (2) an actual existent, a Sinsign or Token, or (3) a general law, a Legisign or Type. As examples of the three kinds he gives (1) a tone of voice (an "indefinitely significant character ": 4.537), (2) a particular word "the " on a page, (3) the written word " the " in the English language of which the particular " the "s are instances (2.246). It should be noted that Peirce's distinction between his sinsign or token and his legisign or type is a distinction depending purely upon the nature of the sign itself and in no way upon what the sign is taken to mean: thus the legisign " the " is the class of written words having a certain physical similarity, not the class of written words having the same meaning. (Ramsey, who introduced Peirce's words " type " and " token " into modern logical discussion, used "type" in the first sense as applied to a pro- positional sign and in the second sense as applied to a proposition: Foundations of Mathematics, p. 274). Using " legisign " then for the class of sinsigns having a certain character in common, or (if you like) as the common character, I cannot distinguish it from a qualisign. For the specific quality of voice by which I recognise a friend (a qualisign) must be embodied in some particular event which has that quality in order for it to serve as a sign, just as the legisign " the " has to be embodied in its instance. Peirce admits this, but says that in the former case " the embodiment has nothing to do with its character as a sign " (2.244). This seems to me like saying that the existence of a patch in my visual field has nothing to do with my seeing it as red: I could not see it as red unless there were an it to see; I cannot take the tone of my friend's voice to be a sign of him unless the voice exists. Peirce's trichotomy reduces then to a dichotomy of signs into qualisigns or legisigns and sinsigns. And there can never be one of the former without one of the latter. Can there be a sinsign without a corresponding legisign ? that is, can an individual particular or event function as a sign except by virtue of having some property in common with other signs ? I think that the answer to this question is: In a private system of signs, yes, for the thing itself can be used as a sign; but in a public system of signs (of the sort which Peirce is considering), no. For in order for me to be able to interpret the sign used by you to mean the object you mean by it, I must have reason to believe that you are using the sign with that meaning, and I can only do this if I have reason to believe that you always use a sign of a particular sort to have the meaning in question. I shall not be able to interpret your sinsign unless I regard the sign as a legisign as well.</page><page sequence="11">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Pdpers of Peirce. 497 It is interesting to note that the same consequence follows if the working of signs is considered purely causally according to the natural- istic theory. For a cause is an event having some property: the event's having that property causes another event to have some property; so on a naturalistic theory both a sinsign and a legisign are involved in all sign situations. The upshot of this is, it seems to me, that while in certain con- nections it may be important to distinguish the sign as legisign or type from the sign as sinsign or token, yet any actual object or event which is a sign must function both as type and as token. The Relation of the Sign to its Object.-The trichotomy under this heading is the one to which Peirce attaches the most importance: (1) An icon is a sign which represents its object by virtue of having some character in common with the object: the colour of a colour- card as representing the colour of the object which it resembles is an icon, and a map as representing spatial relations is an icon. (2) An index is a sign which represents its object by the latter's having some direct action on the former: an example of an index is a hole in a wall taken as a sign of the pass'age of a bullet (2.304). (3) A symbol is a sign which only represents its object by a convention or law that it is to be interpreted in that way: any word or sentence is a symbol. Peirce describes the distinction also in terms of the reducibility of the fundamental triadic relation involved in the use of signs : I think that the essential point at issue can be expressed more simply by saying that in the case of symbols there is no relation between the sign and its object which by itself determines its inter- pretation, whereas with icons and indices there is such a relation. In the case of an icon this relation is one of similarity in respect of some property; in the case of an index it is some relation such as causality holding directly between the sign and its object. Now Peirce does not want to make merely the obvious point that some things used as signs resemble their objects, and that other things used as signs have been directly caused by their objects he wants to contend that these facts are relevant to their functioning as signs. And I do not think that he makes any good case for this. In some of his reasoning he seems to confuse two questions which he is usually at pains to- keep distinct-the psychological ques- tion of the historical origin of our use of signs, and the logical question of the correct analysis of our use of them at present. It may quite well be that the signs first used in the history of language were signs which had a direct causal relation to their objects (e.g., gestures of touching objects) or were signs which resembled their objects (e.g., imitative gestures representing move- ments), but from the logical point of view in neither case were these gestures in themselves signs: they only became signs when they were used for the purpose of communication or understood as standing for their objects. Peirce himself puts the case against the separate existence of indices when he says: "When a driver to</page><page sequence="12">498 CRITICAL NOTICES: attract the attention of a foot, passenger and cause him to save himself, calls out 'Hi!' so far as this is a significant word it is . something more than an index; but so far as it is simply intended to act upon the hearer's nervous system and to rouse him to get out of the way, it is an index, because it is meant to put him in real connection with the object, which is his situation relative to the approaching horse " (2.287). But in the latter case the " Hi ! " is not a sign at all; it is only a stimulus used for the purpose of affect- ing the hearer's body, not his mind. When the " Hi! " is a sign, it must be understood by the hearer to refer to the presence of danger. And the case is the same with icons. When I use a sign which resembles its object, as when I choose the cloth for a suit from a pattern book, I send the marked pattern to my tailor with the intention that he shall understand that I want him to make me a suit of cloth of a similar pattern, but my expectation that he will understand this by my marking the pattern is based upon the exist- ence of a well-understood convention between tailors and their customers. As for maps, which are Peirce'~ favourite examples of icons, we all know how difficult it is to explain a route by means of a map to a person initially entirely ignorant of the principles of map-reading. Peirce's indices and icons are supposed to be signs which signify independently of their use as signs: I find this notion self-contradic- tory. When Peirce defines a symbol as opposed to an icon or an index as " a sign which would lose the character which renders it a sign if there were no interpretant ", and says that a symbol " signifies what it does only by virtue of its being understood to have that significa- tion" (2.304), he is saying things which seem to me true of all signs. Peirce's indices and icons are similar to Stout's " suggestive signs" and "substitute signs" (Analytical Psychology, Vol. II., p. 193). Stout is surely right in contending that these sorts of signs are useful in calling up or in manipulating " expressive signs ", but that without reference to these they are meaningless. Of course, the acceptance of a naturalistic theory of signs would, justify the attempt to divide signs in their relation to their objects on some such lines as Peirce's trichotomy. But I think that a naturalist would be very simple-minded to attach much importance to Peirce's division. For the essential thing in the functioning of a sign to a naturalist is its " sufficiency to call up an excitation similar to that caused by the original stimulus ", and a resemblance or causal connection of the sign to the original stimulus goes only a very little way to explaining an efficacy due almost entirely to an acquired habit. In his discussion of icons and indices Peirce confuses the matter, I think, by his contentions that logical diagrams have an iconical character and demonstrative symbols (logically proper names) an indexical character. With regard to logical diagrams Peirce says a great many very interesting things, and his contention that the</page><page sequence="13">HARTSIIORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 499 process of deduction consists in observing the properties of and making Gedankenexperimente upon diagrams contains important ele- ments of truth. And when he says that " the arrangement of the words in the sentence, for instance, must serve as [an Icon], in order that the sentence may be understood " (4.544), he is approaching Wittgenstein's doctrine that a sign must have a " logical form of representation " in common with its' object. But it is quite a different thing to say, as Wittgenstein would say (Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus, 2-27 et seq. 4 04), that a certain feature of an object (e.g., its " multiplicity ") can only be " shown " by the sign having something in common with the object, and to say (what I take the Icon doctrine to say) that if a mark has a certain similarity to its object, then it is a sign for that object. With regard to demonstrative symbols like " This " in " This is a pencil ", Peirce contends that I cannot understand the sentence unless there is a real connection be- tween the " This " and the pencil pointed at which would make the sign an index. But his argument (2.287) only goes to show that there must be a real connection between the mind of the interpreter and the object, which is an entirely different thing. The distinction that is important for the theory of signs between a word like " This " and a word like " pencil " in the sentence is surely that the former is used for symbolic reference in a different way from the latter, not that in itself it has a relation to its object independent of the con- ventions of the English language. Peirce has thrown distinctions into his second trichotomy which should have been made within the field of his third trichotomy. What the Sign is taken to mean.-I have criticised Peirce for making distinctions in his first and second trichotomies which have no importance for the theory of signs: my criticism here is that his division is woefully inadequate in distinguishing the sorts of things for which signs are taken to stand. He makes a division into (1) a Rheme (or Seme), a " sign of qualitative possibility ", (2) a Dicisign (or Pheme), a " sign of actual existence ", and (3) an Argument (or Delome), a " sign of law " (2.250; see also 4.538). There is not much difficulty about rhemes: they are signs for uni- versals and correspond almost exactly to Russell's " propositional functions " (when this expression is used for the sign). But about dicisign there is a great difficulty in relating the various things Peirce has to say: his definition of a " dicisign " as a " sign of actual existence " would seem to make particulars the objects of dicisigns; but he analyses " the essential nature " of a dicisign as " the kind of sign that conveys information " (2.309), and says that " the readiest characteristic showing whether a sign is a Dicisign or not is that a Dicisign is either true or false, but does not directly furnish reasons for its being so " (2.310). This would make the dicisign the sign of a proposition (or perhaps of a proposition not directly known to be either true or false) ; and in Peirce's considerable discussion of propositions he uses dicisign almost as a synonym for</page><page sequence="14">500 CRITICAL NOTICES: sentence expressing a proposition. And in other places (e.g. 2.260) he calls the sign of a fact a dicisign. There is also uncertainty as to his use of " argument ". Sometimes he means by this merely the sign for a proposition stating a law, in which case it would not seem to be essentially different from a dicisign (especially since Peirce sometimes maintains that all propositions are of the form of, laws: 2.356); but frequently he means by "argument" an inference from premisses to conclusion, in which case it seems to me wrong to call the whole made up of the sentences expressing it a sign: the separate sentences are signs, but the inference is the passage of thought produced by understanding the separate signs but not itself represented by a sign. Though Peirce is right in making a classification of signs in accordance with what they are understood to represent, he does not do justice to the very many different ways signs stand for their objects. His treatment of demonstrative symbols and signs expressing logical form under his second tricho- tomy has impoverished his third classification, which seems to be the only fundamental one from a logical point of view. In concluding my somewhat destructive criticism of the basis of Peirce's theory of signs, I ought to emphasise that other inter- pretations could be given of parts of the theory which may be more in accordance with his thought. The difficulty of a commentator is that the papers on signs are fragmentary, and their contents not mutually consistent. PEIRCE ON PROBABILITY AND INDUCTION. The papers on the " logic of discovery " or " ampliative reasoning" that the editors have collected in Volume II. have for the most part been previously published. They consist of (1) three out of the famous six articles, "Illustrations of the Logic of Science ", first published in Popular Science Monthly (1877-78) and reprinted in Chance Love and Logic (1923), (2) " A Theory of Probable Inference " published in the Johns Hopkins Studies in Logic (1883), (3) articles in Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology (1901 and 1911), (4) some 1905 notes on the varieties and validity of. induction, and (5) an unpublished note of 1910 on the Doctrine of Chances. These last two items throw new light on Peirce's views; so, although all but 26 pages of Peirce's work on probable and inductive reason- ing have been previously published in fairly accessible forms, this review seems the place to give a critical account of the part of Peirce's work on general logic which I take to be of most permanent value. Induction is, for Peirce as for every other logician, a species of inference; and inference for him is the process by which the mind passes from believing one proposition (or set of propositions) to be- lieving another, the process of passage being " according to a general habit of thought " which the reasoner " approves as conducive to true</page><page sequence="15">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 501 knowledge " (2.773). Without this conscious approval the passage of thought would not be inference; but apart from this Peirce always treats inference as a psychological (or even physiological: see 3.160) process. The validity of the inference, for Peirce, is " purely one of fact and not of thinking " (5.365); it depends simply on whether or not the habit of thought leads from true premisses to true conclusions. The same criterion of validity is applicable both to a habit of inference and to a calculating machine. " Say, if you like, that thinking has everything to do with the life of reason- ing; I still insist that it has nothing to do with the logical criticism, which is equally applicable to the machine's performance and to the man's " (2.59). The habit of mind governing an inference 4 "may be formulated in a proposition whose truth depends on the validity of the inferences which the habit determines " (5.367): such a proposition Peirce calls a guiding or leading principle or precept of inference; the leading principle is true because inferences made according to it are valid, and not vice versa. In demonstrative inference the leading principle is known to be- logically necessary, i.e. is known to be true by " a person who knows no facts, though perfectly au fait at reasoning and well-acquainted with the words involved " (4.67). It is logically impossible for the premisses of a demonstrative inference to be true but the conclusion false. Peirce calls demonstrative inference " explicative, analytic, or deductive ": he holds that such inference, however useful it may be, can never " increase our real knowledge " (2.680). I shall not discuss this difficult question, nor Peirce's interesting views as to the diagrammatic method by which deduction has to be carried out, which has analogies with the operational methods of contemporary logicians. The form of inference usually contrasted with demonstrative inference is problematic or probable inference; but if in the latter is included every inference in which probability is concerned in the conclusion, then some of these inferences are demonstrative and are called by Peirce " probable deductions ". I think it is worth while classifying these " probable deductions" according to a principle which Peirce does not use. There are, first, those in which no rules of probability are explicitly involved: for example, from my know- ledge that p/h - l and my knowledge that p/h - ' implies q/k 3 I can deduce that q/k - 1 This is an ordinary deduction in which the premisses and the conclusion are about probabilities: it is of no special interest. Secondly, there are deductions in which the laws of probability are premisses, but in which no analysis of the notion of probability (except that it obeys the laws) is necessary. Such are the deductions of the theorems of the,calculus of probability from its fundamental axioms. For example, the Law of Great Numbers states that we may deduce from the proposition that the probability of a penny falling heads is always 2, that the probability that the proportion of heads in n throws lies between - e and</page><page sequence="16">502 CRITICAL NOTICES: 2 + e (where e is any small number given in advance), tends to 1 as n increases without limit. This theorem may be deduced from the axioms of probability by simple algebra by Tchebycheff's method, without involving any assumptions about the nature of probability in itself. But the kind of" probable deduction " in which Peirce is interested is a third kind in which, while the conclusion is a proposition about probability, the explicit premisses contain no reference to probability. Such inferences require for their justification not only the formal axioms of probability, but an analysis of the concept of probability. Probability, as Peirce realises, means different things in different con- texts; he defines the probability of an event (which he sometimes calls objective probability and contrasts with likelihood and plausibility) as the ratio of the number of events of a species to the number in a genus including that species (see 2.674). He accepts, that is, what Venn and he called " the materialistic view of the subject " and what J. M. Keynes has christened the Frequency Theory. Peirce differs from Venn in emphasising properly the fact that the probability of an event is always with reference to two classes, that it is what he calls a " relative number ", the ratio of the number of PQ's to the number of Q's. But in his earlier papers (1878 and 1883) Peirce ignores the difficulties concerned in the possibility of the latter number being infinite. In 1901 he defines probability in the manner of Venn as the ratio " in the long run of experience " of these two numbers (2.785), and in 1905 he expands this into the limiting value of the ratio of the number of PQ's to the number of Q's as the number of Q's increases without limit (2.758). This is open to the objection that has been urged by, e.g., Jefireys, that there is no unique limiting value to the ratio; and Peirce would appear to be aware of this objection in his last note on the subject (1910) when he admits that there is no " syllogistic certainty " that an unbiassed die will not turn up a six " obstinately at every single throw " (2.667). In this paper he sketches a " doctrine of chances " which seems to me the most satisfactory form for a Frequency Theory to take. The statement of an objective probability (e.g., of a die turning up six) ' means that the die has a certain ' would-be' ; and to say that a die has a ' would-be ' is to say that it has a property, quite analogous to any habit that a man might have. . . Just as' it would be necessary, in order to define a man's babit, to describe how it would lead him to behave and upon what sort of occasion-albeit this statement would by no means imply that the habit consists in that action-so to define the die's 'would-be', it is necessary to say how it would lead the die to behave on an occasion that would bring out the full consequence of the ' would-be '; and this statement will not of itself imply that the 'would-be ' of the die consists in such behaviour " (2.664). Thus to attribute an objective probability to an event is to state a law about events of a certain class, which theory can be neither completely confirmed nor completely refuted</page><page sequence="17">HARTSHOORNE AN'D WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 503 by experience. In this first respect it is like every other law of nature, but the second respect is the peculiarity of laws about probabilities (" statistical " laws). Nevertheless, though such a law cannot strictly speaking be refuted by' experience, for the die might turn up six always in any series of throws, yet if it did turn up six in a large number of throws, we should certainly reject the law that the probability of its turning up six was one-sixth and say (in Peirce's words) that it had taken on " an abnormal,. a miraculous, habit" (2.667). This seems to me by far the best way o$ looking at statistical laws about objective probabilities; they are to be rejected if experience differs too widely from what the law prophesies, accord- ing to the Law of Great Numbers, as probable. The matter is more important than it was in 1910, now that physicists do not expect to be able to derive their " statistical " laws from more fundamental " deterministic " laws; so Peirce's " would-be "s seem to be some of the brute facts of the universe.' To return to Peirce's contention that there are deductions in which probability enters into, the conclusion which are not of my first and second kinds. In his Johns Hopkias paper he gives three forms of this third sort of probable deduction, of which I will examine the last-" statistical deduction " (2.700) The proportion r of the M's are P's; 3', S", S"', etc., are a numerous set, taken at random from among the M's; Hence, probably and approximately, the proportion r of the S's are P's. Peirce follows his statement of this form with an account of the relation between the " probably " and the " approximately " given by Bernoulli's form of the Law of Great Numbers: and if the conclusion is interpreted in this way, there is no doubt that it follows demonstratively from the premisses, if " at random " means that an S is equally likely to be any M. But in this case the conclusion is not in any direct sense about the proposition that the proportion r of the S's are P's: the conclusion is that the probability that the proportion lies between r ? e is some complicated function of c. The same method of proof will prove that it is very improbable that exactly r of the S's are P's; so Peirce's manner of expressing the correct conclusion is very unsatisfactory. Why he puts it the way he does is, I think, because he wishes to apply his " objective probability " to inferences as well as to events, and hence derivatively to propositions which are the conclusions of inferences. " To say that a proposition has the probability p means that to infer it to be true would be to follow an argument such as would carry truth with it in the ratio of frequency p " (2.697). On 1 I sketched a theory similar to Peirce's, with special reference to the Quantum Theory, in the Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume X. (1931), pp. 187-191.</page><page sequence="18">504 CRITICAL NOTICES: this interpretation the "probably " attached to the conclusion of his " statistical deduction" should mean that, with a number n of in- ferences from the premisses to the conclusion that approximately r of the S's are P's (i.e., that the ratio of the SP's to the S's lies between r ? E), the proportion of these conclusions that are true is nearlv unity. But this is false: if E has the value of the " probable error ", the conclusion is as likely to be false as true. The true proposition is something complicated about the probability of the proportions lying within a certain range; and this, like the other correct interpretation of Peirce's " statistical deduction ", is simply a case of my second kind of " probable deduction ". So I do not think that a claim for a third kind can be justified. We can now turn to " ampliative, synthetic or (loosely speaking) inductive " reasoning, of which Peirce considers two forms-induc- tion and "hypothesis " or " abduction ", which I will leave till later. The form of reasoning which Mill called " inference from particulars to particulars " and Johnson " eduction " Peirce calls " analogical inference " and treats as a compound of induction, abduction and deduction (2.733). For Peirce induction is what Broad and Mace call " statistical generalisation i he states it in the form (2.702) S', S", S"', etc., form a numerous set taken at random from among the M's, S', S", S"', etc., are found to be - the proportion p of them - P's; Hence, probably and approximately the same proportion, p, of the M's are P's. Peirce never considers separately an induction to the conclusion " All the M's are P's ": this is for him a form of statistical generalisa- tion in which p = 1 and, without the qualification of " approxi- mately ", it is never justifiable when the number of M's is infinite (2.732). For Peirce the problem of induction is that of inferring tile pro- portion in which a property is manifested in the world from know- ledge of the proportion in which it occurs in a sample. He frequently uses the analogy of estimating the constitution of a bag containing black and white balls from the constitution of a sample of draws from the-bag. He criticises effectively the two types of justification for induction usually given by logicians: Laplace's Rule of Succes- sion, and a " uniformity of nature " major premiss. The former he demolishes admirably by showing that the " equiprobability of ratios " upon which the argument depends is untenable and incon- sistent and that ari " equiprobability of constitutions " will not give us anything at all (2.682 et seq., 2.744 et seq.). The latter, which would make induction depend upon some " presupposition " like a principle of uniformity of nature or of limited variety-the method of EIll, Broad, Keynes, Jeffreys-is treated only cursorily;</page><page sequence="19">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 505 but he nevertheless makes what seems to me an effective criticism of this line of approachl: " To say that a theory such as these is ,necessary to explaining the validity of induction and hypothesis is to say that these modes of inference are not in themselves valid, but that their conclusions are rendered probable by being probable deductive inferences from a suppressed (and originally unknown) premiss " (2.749). In other words, if a " presupposition " were necessary, all induction would be deduction and there would be no special problem of induction. Peirce's positive doctrine of the explanation of the validity of induction is not consistent. Three views which are closely related may be distinguished in his writings; traces of all of them are to be found in most of his papers. (1) In his Johns Hopkins paper, where he is comparing induc- tion with deduction, he says incidentally but explicitly that the general rule for the validity of an induction is that " the statistical deduction of which the induction is the inversion, must be valid and strong" (2.715). In the analogy of black and white balls in a bag, the induction to the proportion of black balls in the bag being probably about p, from knowledge that a sample has this proportion, is " valid and strong " if and only if the " statistical deduction" from knowledge that the bag has a proportion r of black balls to the proportion of black balls in the sample being prob- ably about r is " valid and strong " (the relation between r and p is mysterious: see 2.720). But in most of the cases in which we are interested the bag would have to contain an infinite number of balls, which would not then permit of any " statistical deduction " and would make the criterion inapplicable. And in other cases it cannot be considered to be a sufficient condition, for if so the induction would be virtually reduced to a deduction. But what I think is correct in Peirce's contention is not that the validity of some de- duction explains or guarantees the validity of an induction, but -that it is a necessary condition of it. (Peirce makes this lesser claim in 2.718.) An analysis of the concept of randomness is difficult; but a case can be made out for saying that when the fact that the examined instances have been selected at random is demanded as a necessary condition for the validity of an induction, this fact is another way of stating Peirce's test that they should be such as would validate a statistical deduction of their properties. (2) The justification for induction to which the greatest weight is given in the 1878 and 1883 papers is that the validity of an in- duction is its probability, its probability being the ratio of the number of inductions leading to true conclusions to the total number of in- ductions. Peirce quotes Locke as his predecessor in this doctrine, where Locke is speaking of a man who accepts a mathematical proposition on the authority of a mathematician: " In which case the foundation of his assent is the probability of the thing; the proof being such as for the most part carries truth with it " (Essay, 33</page><page sequence="20">506 CRITICAL NOTICES: Bk. IV., ch. 15, ? 1). That is, it is reasonable to believe a mathe- matical proposition on proper authority and it is reasonable to believe the conclusion of an induction, because both these processes- believing mathematicians on mathematics, and making induc- tions-are processes which " for the most part " lead to true beliefs. But for the most part of what ? What is the genus whose number is to be the denominator in the fraction which is the objective probability (and hence the degree of validity) of the species of inferences in question ? If it is every possible induction, or even every induction that has been or will be made, the number which carry falsehood with them must outnumber by far those that lead to the truth. (Consider, for example, all the inductions by simple enumeration-Pooh-pooh arguments as Peirce calls them: see 2.758 n.) The genus must be restricted to inductions obtained according to some special " precept of inference ", and every special precept that can be stated, e.g. " scientific method " is so very vague. Moreover, there are all the Frequency Theory's difficulties about infinity. Nevertheless I think that the process of induction " being such as for the most part carries truth with it " must be an essential part of any adequate theory of the validity of the process. (3) In the 1900's Peirce came to see quite clearly what he had only glimpsed before, that the sort of probability involved in the question of the validity of induction is quite different from any " objective probability ". The validity does not consist in the majority of the conclusions obtained by using the inductive method being true (this is " by no means certain ": 2.781): it does consist in the fact that the inductive method is self-corrective. " The true guarantee of the validity of induction is that it is a method of reaching conclusions which, if it be persisted in long enough, will assuredly correct any error concerning future experience into which it may temporarily lead us " (2.769: 1905). This very interesting doctrine is presumably the one of which Peirce, in his sketch of his proposed work on logic (1902), said that when " I shall set forth the reasoning in strict accuracy of form, I defy anybody to find a flaw in it" (2.102). Unfortunately he never did this; nevertheless he wrote enough to enable us to see the trend of his argument. Peirce was led to this view, I think, by his comparison of inductive inference with inferring the constitution of a bag from the known constitution of a sample drawn from the bag. For if the drawings from the bag are continued until all the balls in the bag have been drawn, then the proportion of black balls in the sample must ap- proach and finally become identical with the proportion of black balls in the bag. (It would not be correct to say that the former approaches the latter as a limit in the technical mathematical sense, because there are only a discrete number of draws: but after n balls have been drawn of which m are black, the number of black balls-in a bag containing N balls must lie between m and m + N -n, and the difference of these two numbers decreases by 1 with every</page><page sequence="21">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 507 fresh draw until they become equal when n = N.) " In induction we say that the proportion p of the sample being P's, probably there is about the same proportion in the same lot; or, at least, if this happens not to be so, then on continuing the drawings the inference will be, not vindicated as in the case [of statistical deduction], but modified so as to become true " (2.703: 1883). But this is only the case both if the number of balls is finite and if the balls are not replaced after being drawn: if there is no end to the number of draws there can be no assurance that p approaches r as the number of draws increases. In his application of this analogy to the general problem of induc- tion Peirce attacks this difficulty from the other end with a bold and ingenious solution. How can the universe have a character which does not manifest itself with a continued application of inductive methods ? For if the universe is irregular, it must be irregular in some way, and that way can be discovered by induction. If we conceive of the universe as infinite, we must conceive of it as an infinite series governed by some law. (Here Peirce is accepting the priority of an ordinal infinity to a cardinal ithfinity.) " Whatever has no end can have no mode of being other than that of a law, and therefore whatever general character it may have must be describable, but the only way of describing an endless series is by stating explicitly or implicitly the law of the succession of one term upon another. But every such term has a finite ordinal place from the beginning and therefore, if it presents any regularity for all finite successions from the beginning, it presents the same regularity throughout" (5.170). But, granted that an infinite series must be governed by some law, it by no means follows that the law can be discovered, or even approximated to, by any finite series of observations. A mathematician can easily co2nstruct a series whose rule will not be discovered (except by a lucky guess) from inspection of any number of its terms; and there is no reason to suppose the Creator less. ingenious. Moreover, even if an infinite series of events had a regularity that could be easily discovered, there is little-reason to suppose that examining events of that series in a different order would enable us to discover the regularity of the series in the original order. Suppose that there are alive at this moment 1000 times as many white swans as black swans. The correct proportion would only be discovered by a set of people who made one count in Australia to 1000 counts elsewhere. Peirce may very well be right in insisting that the only way in which we can conceive of infinity is as an ordered series, but he must admit that it can have different orders. Since this is the case, the only way to discover the order of the universe would be to pursue the inductive process not only infinitely but also exhaustively. We cannot do the first of these, let alone the second. The element of truth in Peirce's argument is that irregularity in the universe is in itself no bar to the success of induction. " Utter irregularity is not surpassed in regularity by any other relation of</page><page sequence="22">508 CRITICAL NOTICES: parts to whole, and is thus readily discovered by induction to exist where it does exist " (2.769): this has been shown recently by the success of the Uncertainty Principle in physics. But it is quite a different thing to say that, if the world is suitably irregular, induction can lead to the truth, than to say that it must do so, whatever the constitution of the world. I have assumed that the " wonderful self-correcting nature of ampliative inference " (2.749) with which Peirce is concerned consists in the substitution of a more correct value of p in the inductive conclusion that a proportion p of the S's are P's, as described in his 1883 paper. 'For later, when Peirce praises this " self-correcting nature " so much, he never explains precisely what it is: and he may be thinking of another sense in which induction may be said to correct itself-that in which we substitute the hypothesis that a proportion p of the SQ's are P's for the hypothesis that a proportion p of the S's are P's when this is refuted or rendered very unplausible by experience. This sense seems to me quite as important a feature of inductive procedure as the other: Peirce's remarks that " for sound reason . . . it is necessary to take account of the manner in which the [examined] S's were brought to the inquirer's attention " and on the importance of the " general conditions " accompanying the examined S's (2.763) are more relevant to this second form of self- correction. What seems to be the most important point in Peirce's teaching, which is common to his second and third theory, is that a particular inductive inference is not to be considered as valid in itself, but valid as a member of a class of inferences whose defining property is that they are obtained by " inductive method ". That is, the " justifica- tion of induction " is essentially the justification of the inductive method. Peirce's second theory justifies the inductive method by saying that it leads on the whole to the truth, his third theory by saying that, if persisted in, it tends to correct itself. It seems to me that a more satisfactory theory of induction than either of Peirce's separately can be produced by combining their str6ng points, in some such way as this: The validity of an inference made by inductive method (and inductive method must be limited to some sort of scientific method so that not all inductions by simple enumera- tion are included) consists in the fact that most of the " developed " inferences lead to true conclusions, a " developed " inference being one obtained after the failure of many inferences in the same field have corrected the conclusion (either by changing the p or by limiting the S to SQ). What is meant by " most of the inferences lead to true conclusions " is the same sort of thing as what is meant by " most dice turn up six between 16 per cent. and 17 per cent. of the throws" (see my account of Peirce's f'would-be "s) : the class re- ferred to as " the developed inferences made by inductive method " is not the class of inferences that are in fact made, nor the class that could conceivably be made, but the class of those that could be</page><page sequence="23">HARTSHORNE AND WEISS, Collected Papers of Peirce. 509 made by creatures with intellectual faculties rather like ourselves. (Cf. Peirce's " social principle " in logic: 2.654.) Such a theory as this -will yield, I think, a satisfactory, though vague, criterion of the validity of induction. But, a critic will say, it cannot be an explanation or a definition of that validity, since our knowledge that most inductive inferences of this sort lead to the truth is itself derived from induction. It is curious that this diffi- culty, which has been prominent in recent discussions of induction, is nowhere discussed by Peirce. It is true that he frequently talks of inference as essentially a habit; but he never says explicitly, as Ramsey says, that induction "is one of the ultimate sources of knowledge just as memory is ", so that " if any one has not got the habit of induction, we cannot prove to him that he is wrong " (Foundations of Mathematics, p. 197). Thus that part of Ramsey's essay which, he says, ".is almost entirely based on the writings of C. S. Peirce " (loc. cit., p. 194 n.), is a continuation and not merely a re-statement of Peirce's line of thought. It seems to me that the Peirce-Ramsey method of approach, incomplete though it is at present, is the only one that properly appreciates the peculiarities in the problem of the justification of induction. Something must be said about the other form of ampliative reason- ing which Peirce calls at different times " hypothesis ", " abduction ", " presumption ", " retroduction ", and to which he attaches great importance. In his papers of 1878 and 1883 he treats deduction, induction and abduction as three types of inference which are equally fundamental, and he produces a complicated (and, I think, mis- leading) doctrine of their mutual relations treated with reference to syllogisms (2.508, 2.623, 2.716). Abduction is here an argument of the form (2.623):- Every M is P, Every S is P; Hence, every S is M; the class of S's being a class given by enumeration-[a, b, c, d]-and P being a conjunction of properties-P'P"P"'. Whereas induction infers that all the members of a class have a property of some of the members of the class, abduction infers that a property which formally implies (in Russell's sense) a set of properties applies to the things having this set of properties. An abduction is, as Peirce notes,' reducible to an induction applied to properties. Never- 1 Peirce does not set out the reduction of an abduction to an induction with sufficient precision (2.632): the explicit reduction is:- Every member of the class of properties [P', P", P"'] is a property of everything of which M is a property, Every member of the class of properties [P', P", P"'] is a property of every member of [a, b, c, d]; Hence, inductively, every property of everything of which M is a pro- perty is a property of every member of [a, b, c, d]; Hence, deductively, M is a property of every member of [a, b, c, d].</page><page sequence="24">510 CRITICAL NOTICES: theless he thinks it important to treat it separately, partly because " characters have to be weighed rather than counted " (2.706) so that the multiplication -of instances works differently in the two cases, but chiefly because " the essence of an induction is that it infers from one set of facts another set of similar facts, whereas hypothesis [abduction] infers from facts of one kind to facts of another " (2.642). However, in the " Minute Logic " of 1902 Peirce admits that his early papers attached too much importance to syllogistic forms and " confused two different kinds of reasoning " in the conception of Abduction (2.102). Consequently in his later papers " abduction " and its synonyms are used, not for a process of inference parallel to induction, but for the " probational adoption of a hypothesis " (2.96) which has then to be confirmed or refuted by induction (see 2.776, 2.755). This, of course, is the ordinary account of scientific procedure given by every logician since Jevons: Peirce only differs from the orthodox account in classifying the thinking of the hypothesis as itself a form of ampliative reasoning, and this difference is, I think, merely a verbal one, namely, that of whether " an act of insight, although of extremely fallible insight " (5.181), is or is not called reasoning. (In 2.643 he calls abduction an emotion !) In various places throughout Volume II. Peirce gives practical rules for abducting hypotheses, some of which (e.g. lack of bias) are excellent, but one of which-that the hypothesis must be specified " in advance of, or at least quite independently of, any examination of the facts " (2.789: see 2.735 et seq.)-seems to me only important if one takes the lowest view of the credulity of scientists. He re- cognises, however, that the main philosophical questions about the use of hypotheses are concerned with what hypotheses are possible, which is part of the general question of the significance of proposi- tions, to which " pragmaticism " has a definite answer. " If you carefully consider the question of pragmatism you will see that it is nothing else than the question of the logic of abduction-" (5.196). So his final treatment of abduction is to be found in the Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism of 1903; and I leave them for discussion to the reviewer of Volume V. Peirce says of Kant that he " possessed in a high degree all seven of the mental qualifications of a philosopher: 1. The ability to discern what is before one's consciousness. 2. Inventive originality. 3. Generalizing power. 4. Subtlety. 5. Critical severity and sense of fact. 6. Systematic procedure. 7. Energy, diligence, persistency, and exclusive devotion to philosophy " (1.522).</page><page sequence="25">S. ALEXANDER, Beauty and Other Forms of Value. 511 How many of these qualifications did Peirce himself possess ? 2, 3, 4 certainly (indeed he had 3 over-developed); 7, on the internal evi- dence, I think he had, and 6 he more often attempted than achieved. His deficiencies were in 1 and 5. His sense of fact, though sometimes extremely hard-headed, deserted him when his metaphysical fancy led him on; and his critical severity was blinded whenever he met a triad. Reared on the Critique of Pure Reason and the J. S. Mill tradition transmitted through Chauncey Wright (1.4), he had the defects of his masters. But he also had many of their virtues. He combined a commonsensical outlook with creative imagination to a higher degree than did Mill, and his professional knowledge of pure and applied physics kept his logic closer to actual scientifie thinking. And Peirce had one qualification which, though perhaps not necessary to a pure philosopher thinking by himself, is very important to one who wishes to influence the thought of others- that of being a sufficiently good writer not to turn his gold into dross. Peirce's writing is of very varied texture-sometimes abstract, sometimes concrete or personal; but it is nearly always readable and occasionally remarkably felicitous. He freqiaently digresses, but his digressions are so full of obscure and interesting information that a curious reader will find himself forgiving him for them. (Since reading 2.252 I shall never mis-spell "premisses ".) He is not a writer to read at a stretch, but one to dip into: the fluidity of his thought makes it more stimulating. It may well be that philosophy will derive more from this admirable edition of Peirce's " Collected Papers " than it would have done had he been able, as he wished, to freeze his philosophic imaginings into an architectonic magnum opus.
