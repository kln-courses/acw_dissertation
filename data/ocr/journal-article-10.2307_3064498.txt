<plain_text><page sequence="1">changed the Greco-Roman idea of happiness by defining it in, and confining it to, a Christian context: Deum qui habet beatus est (De Beata Vita 2. 11). Furthermore, man can only 'have' God by grace, through the mediation of Christ. If man, in his fallen condition, still has some sense of and desire for true happiness, it is because of God's initiative (De Trin. 4. 1. 2: ac per hoc egit nobiscum) and not because of any natural divinity in human nature. Furthermore Augustine, in contrast to much ancient thought, insists that true happiness is unobtainable in this life; we are happy in this world only in spe, not in re; and Augustine's definition of happiness in his letter to Proba: Ille igitur beatus est, qui omnia quae vult habet, nec aliquid vult quod non decet (Ep. 130. 5. 11) must be understood in an eschatological sense: Tunc erit vera vita post mortem, verumque solatium post desolationem (ibid., 2. 5). B. lists his conclusion about Augustine's view of happiness under five headings (pp. 23-43): (1) Augustine's idea of the happy life is characterised by its unlikeness to the life of the present world; (2) it consists in having God; (3) it pertains to the future, in the visio beatifica; (4) the manner of 'having' God is by loving: Beata quippe vita si non amatur, non habetur (Civ. Dei 14. 25); (5) the happy life is one of the highest spiritual and emotional intensity, but the emotion is always the result of the action of the Holy Spirit. Thus there can be no reduction of happiness to the level of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World: 'They get what they want, and they never want what they can't get'. Here, the author might have made more of the Augustinian notion of participation in God (briefly noticed on p. 35 in connexion with Trin. 4. 2.4: Illuminatio quippe nostra participatio Verbi est, illius scilicet vitae quae lux est hominum) and his doctrine of Deification (see Victorino Capanaga in Augustinus Magister II [1954], 745-54). This is an interesting essay. The style is, however, not an easy one for the foreign reader and English-speaking scholars may find it helpful to consult the translation in the Augustine Lecture.

London: The Warburg Institute, 1983 (1982 on title page). Paper, ?18. The Secret of Secrets, a Fiirstenspiegel enriched with occult speculation, is genetically connected with the ever productive genre of letters between Aristotle and Alexander. Hence its attribution to Aristotle. In itself it is of none but antiquarian interest. But its immense popularity in the Middle Ages and beyond claims the attention of the historian of literature and culture. The present tightly-packed and well-produced collection of articles on the Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, French, and Russian versions caters for most needs. Some Arabic version is first attested in 941. The work purports to have been translated into Arabic from classical Greek via Byzantine Greek or Syriac. But there is no need to believe in the existence of a Greek or Syriac original. The Arabic evidence is complex and confused. No major breakthrough has been made since Manzalaoui's comprehensive account in Oriens 23-24 (1974), 146-257. Oxford F. W. ZIMMERMANN A.

Primitive Rome was marked by simple piety towards the gods of nature, an idyllic state of innocence which was shattered first by the importation of Hellenic, anthropomorphic deities with their alien mythology and then by the increasing interference of politics in the sphere of religion. By the late Republic religion counted for little; manipulation and scepticism were rife. The restoration by Augustus may have stemmed this melancholy decline temporarily, but state cults had little power under the empire. True religion lay in the personal cults of oriental origin and in Christianity. In the past twenty years a new wave of scholarly work has countered the traditional view at every stage. Notions of primitivism, decline, manipulation, scepticism and personal (as against collective) religion are now rightly viewed with suspicion.
