<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS1 BY WILLIAM CHASE GREENE The whole world's life is a chant to the sea-tide's chorus.?Swinburne. In no age have we looked upon the sea with indiffer ence. More than the rocks and the trees, more even than the mountains, it has forced itself upon our imaginations as something peculiarly a part of our life. We have lavished all our skill in describing it, we have cursed it as a hostile monster, we have prayed to it as a god, we have felt it to be a symbol of our inner life; but whatever our passions may have been, they have always told us that the sea is a presence not to be ignored. We, of a later generation, are at a double disadvantage when we try to discover the attitude of an ancient race tow ard the sea. We find it very difficult, of course, not to read into all the ancient literature the ideas and fancies of later epochs. Moreover, we find not only that there is no one con ception or attitude in the whole body of literature, but that hardly any single writer thinks of the sea in unchanging terms. It shall be my task, therefore, to consider the views held by some of the Greek poets, and to trace in outline their growth from poet to poet. The subject has at least this advantage, that the individual poets were at liberty, much more than the sculptors and the painters, to give free rein to their own fancies, to create new worlds of images in the likeness of new visions they had seen. To them the beliefs of their fellows were a background against which they might set their figures. The Greeks began early to think about the sea. Long before the Homeric poems took literary form, the great 'This essay won the Charles Oldham Prize at Oxford, June, 1913. The quotations are given partly in the translations of well-known scholars, partly in versions made by the writer.</page><page sequence="2">428 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW spectacle of its shape and color, its drama of sound and motion, must have found expression in speech. In its simplest form, this means the Homeric epithet, which voices in a large descriptive way the physical nature of its object. The sea is " wide," " deep," " boundless," " purple," or " wine-clark "; it is "loud-sounding " and "much-dash ing," " hoary " or " misty." This " salt thing " is " un vintaged," if that be the meaning of arpvyrjTos; as the highway of ships, it is named the " waterways." Such description comes from impressions that have not been turned over in any individual mind. To any pair of eyes the sea is large, to any ears its breakers are surging, to any tongue they are salt. Quite easily the descriptive terms became stereotyped in conventional phrases which recurred naturally to the lips of everybody, when once they had been used. Especially must this have been the case in the Homeric poems, because of their traditional character. When a poet begins to sing, however, his imagination im mediately dictates what his eye shall see. And the Homeric poems give us accurate and vivid description. Let us turn to the embarking of Telemachus: Then came Telemachus aboard; but Athene led the way, and at the vessel's stern she sat her down, while close at hand Telemachus was seated. The others loosed the cables, and coming aboard themselves took places at the pins. A favorable wind clear-eyed Athene sent, a brisk west wind that sang along the wine-dark sea. And now Telem achus, inspiriting his men, bade them lay hold upon the tackling, and they hearkened to his call. Raising the pine-wood mast, they set it in the hollow socket, binding it firm with forestays, and tightened the white sail with twisted ox-hide thongs. The wind swelled out the belly of the sail, and round the stem loudly the rippling water roared as the ship started. Onward she sped, forcing a passage through the waves. Making the tackling fast throughout the swift black ship, the men brought bowls brimming with wine, and to the gods that never die and never have been born they poured it forth?chiefest of all to her, the clear-eyed child of Zeus. So through the night and early dawn did the ship cleave her way. (Prof. Palmer's translation.) Again, the description of the shipwreck of Odysseus abounds in picturesque detail; waves and wind and spray, rocky ledge and shore-rushes, all are skilfully suggested. But in the Homeric poems by far the greater num ber of passages of this kind must be sought under the guise of similes, often elaborately set forth. When the de tail is added at unnecessary length, so far as pure com</page><page sequence="3">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 429 parison is concerned, the very fullness of the rehearsal be trays the naif interest of the poet in the theme itself. Thus " the assembly was swayed like the long sea-waves of the Icarian Main that the East wind and the South wind raise, rushing upon them from the clouds of father Zeus." Hermes " dropped down on the deep and skimmed along the water like a bird, a gull, which down the fearful hollows of the barren sea, snatching at fish, dips its thick plumage in the spray.J' And there is observation of the keenest sort in another passage: " Even as there spreadeth across the main the ripple of the West wind newly risen, and the sea grows black beneath it, so sate the ranks of the Achaeans and Trojans upon the plain.'J The same figure is repeated when Hector " fell upon the fight like a roaring blast that leaps down and stirs the violet-colored deep." Sometimes the sketch is turned into a moving vignette: As when on the echoing beach the sea-wave lifteth up itself in close array before the driving of the West wind?out on the deep doth it first rear its helmed head, then break on the land, and bellow aloud, and go with arching crest about the head-lands, and spew the foaming brine afar,?even so in close array moved the battalions of the Danaans with out pause to battle. A particularly vivid touch is lent to the boxing-match between Euryalus and Epeius by another happy simile. '' As when beneath the North wind's ripple a fish leapeth on a tangle-covered beach, and then the black wave hideth it, so leapt up Euryalus at that blow." To even a casual reader of these epithets and similes it must appear that we are passing beyond mere delineation of physical facts. It is only a step from simile to metaphor, from metaphor to personification; and figurative language comes early in the lives of children and of nations. Any thing so active as the sea, too, lends itself with especial ease to figurative expression. Frequent are the references to the " broad back of the sea," and to an island as the " navel of the sea." In the more conscious art of iEschy lus, too, we find phrases suggestive of such ideas. Xerxes, in the " Persians," throws his bridge of ships like a yoke on the neck of the sea, and the waveless sea is several times conceived of as having fallen asleep. A wonderfully vivid effect is gained by iEschylus when he says that the sea after a storm " blossomed with wrecks of ships and bodies of sailors." Parallels to this idea may of course be found</page><page sequence="4">430 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW in Euripides, where the sea " blossoms with blood," and in Lucretius, where it " blossoms with sails." The genius of language can go far to shape the beliefs of a people. Yet it is doubtful whether the personification of the forces of nature by the poets could ever of itself have brought about their deification. Greek myths cannot be explained simply as the allegorical account of physical phenomena, nor mythical figures as the personification of the powers of nature. Many deities certainly had their origin in the natural elements, conceived as sentient beings, and requiring placation by fetish rites. Yet there are many other cases where gods must have been borrowed from foreign nations, or in which a myth was invented to explain a rite whose origin had been forgotten. In such cases we must not hope to find a close relation between the force of nature and the deity that seems at first to preside over it. Both kinds of deification had been applied to the sea be fore the Homeric poems were written, and both kinds are represented within their pages. Side by side the concep tions grew, and side by side they stand in the poems. Ink lings of a vague divinity are in the epithet aX.9 Sia, no less than in the more individualized forms of the primitive sculptor. And Herodotus tells us, in a passage full of significance, his own conception of the theogony: As to the origin of each individual god, whether all of them existed from the beginning, what were their peculiar forms, the knowledge of these matters is, so to speak, only of to-day and yesterday. For Hesiod and Homer are my seniors, I believe, by perhaps four hundred years,? not more. They it is who have composed for the Greeks the generations of the gods, and have given to the gods their titles and distinguished their several provinces and powers, and marked their forms. Exaggerated as this view may be, it is at least a half-truth; at any rate, the divinities of the sea are already individualized in the Homeric poems, and never lost the more prominent traits of character that we find there. Vague and popular animism has given place to personality; the phenomena of storm and calm have become but the manifestations of an angry or of a beneficent god. Homer and Hesiod have drawn together the scattered and conflicting beliefs into a fairly consistent dogma; they have done their best to nationalize the theogony. As we might expect, the tendency is for all the gods to become more and more independent of natural provinces, as</page><page sequence="5">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 431 they win new personal traits. And in general the gods are noblest the nearer they are to their functions as nature gods; they doff their sublimity as they approach humanity. Two stages in the development of the sea-gods are chron icled in the early Greek poets. Two sea-dynasties reign without conflicting with each other. The earlier, that of Oceanus, is hardly more than the animate power of the all encircling Ocean-stream; the later, Poseidon and his train, is far more detached. Yet attempts were made to reconcile the dynasties by means of genealogy.1 In Oceanus was expressed the immensity of the sea, as the great stream that embraced every known land. Whether the Greeks sent their ships to the Euxine, or past the Pillars of Heracles to the Atlantic, beyond them always lay " that untravel'd world whose margin fades for ever and for ever.'' Nor could anything be more natural than that round a level world a stream should flow; a shield of Achilles must have its rim. In due season, ocean became Oceanus: " the world is full of gods," said Thales, and Oceanus took his place among the other gods. He is a figure of remote grandeur, living in his palace far to the west, seldom mingling in the affairs of the other gods or of men. He is subject to Zeus, but does not attend the councils of the gods of Olympus. In his stream the stars bathe, and the dawn rises from his depths. By his sister Titan Tethys, he is the father of three thousand rivers and of countless ocean nymphs. In the " Prometheus Bound " he is more distinctly a person than anywhere else; indeed, we should almost forget his connection with the sea, were it not for his entrance in a chariot drawn by a gryphon. It is interesting to note that Shelley, in the u Prometheus Unbound," though he makes Ocean act as a personality, never allows him to become divorced from his function as the incarnation of the sea. More prominent than Oceanus is Poseidon, who rep resents more nearly the power of the sea. Throughout Greek literature and art, it is the physical aspect of him 1 The following table, adapted from Gayley's Classic Myths, will show how this was done: Ouranos-Gaea Pontus Oceanus-Tethys Cronus-Rhea Doris Nereus Thaumas Phorcys-Ceto Jnachus Oceajids Doris Poseidon -Am phitrite Galatea Thetis Iris Harpies Graeae Gorgons Sirens Scylla and other -! Tiver gods Proteus Triton</page><page sequence="6">432 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW that is most characteristic, nor does he ever rise to any great spiritual significance. He, too, like Oceanus, is the u engird]er of the earth," but is also the " earth-shaker " and the " gatherer of clouds "; he is reputed to have split the rocks of Tempe. His voice is heard in the surf; his anger is felt in the storm. He belongs to the Olympic dynasty, and as ruler of the sea is the peer of his brother Zeus, while his marriage with Amphitrite, daughter of the Oceanid Doris, reconciles him with the older dynasty. In the " Odyssey," he is the main celestial machinery for the action of the poem; for he " steadily strove with godlike Odysseus till he reached his land." His palace was in the depths of the sea, but he used to drive in his chariot over the floods, the waves standing asunder before him. The trident, his symbol of authority, was probably evolved from a fish-spear; and other attributes, like the dolphins of his train, may be traced to natural origins. It is not certain why the horse came to be associated with Poseidon. Per haps the best explanation is the resemblance of foam crested waves on a windy day to the flying manes of horses. Obscure as many parts of his cult may appear, the person ality of Poseidon is simpler than that of most of the gods; indeed, we find in Hellenistic art new attempts to revive his passionate character and his immediate connection with the sea, even at the expense of his dignity as a god. Other divinities of the sea are numerous. Sometimes a sea-monster was simply deified, or some fleeting aspect of the sea was endowed with a more lasting form. Son of Pontus (the high sea) was the fish-god Nereus, a genial old man who represents the beneficence of the sea. His fifty daughters embody the various phases of the ocean, with all its changes of form and color. Thus Galene is the Nereid of calm weather, who danced with her sisters in the depths of the sea. The changeableness of the sea had another repre sentative in Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, whose power of changing from one intangible form to another cost Mene laus so much trouble. The manner in which the phenomenon of nature became a person is admirably shown in the pas sage where he " comes forth from the water at a puff of the West wind, veiled in the dark ripple." The terrible aspect of the sea finds its divinity in Phorcys; its wonder and maj esty in Thaumas. O Such, then, are the steps by which the Greeks placed the</page><page sequence="7">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 433 sea in their tneology. It was not an orderly progress, well defined from step to step. In the Homeric poems, where the epithet stage still lingers, many other conceptions are to be found; nor do we lack intimations of ideas that later generations carried further. As early as the Homeric age, the Greeks learned to express their emotions toward the sea. Dread and fascination strove for mastery in their minds; and at first dread seemed to prevail. The sea was a great and hostile power that separated the nations from one another, and lay in wait for the sailors that had the hardihood to tempt it. So in Homer we find: Hector shining with fire on all sides leaped on the throng, and fell upon them, as when beneath the storm-clouds a fleet wave reared of the winds falls on a swift ship, and she is all hidden with foam, and the dread blast of the wind roars against the sail, and the sailors fear and tremble in their hearts, for by but a little way are they borne forth from death; even so the spirit was torn in the breast of the Achseans. Menelaus tells of a " sea from which birds travel not within a year, so vast is it, and fearful "; and Menelaus was not alone in finding the sea Seuvos. Even Hermes, the great traveler among the gods, asks, " Who of his own accord would cross such stretches of interminable salt sea?" And when Calypso bids Odysseus to build a raft, he is dis tressed at the thought of " that great gulf of sea, terrible, toilsome, which trim ships cannot cross, although they speed so fast, glad in the breeze of Zeus." In fact, the sea became almost a type of all that is hard and unfeeling; so that Pa troclus cries to Achilles, " Pitiless that thou art, the knight Peleus was not thy father, nor Thetis thy mother, but the gray sea bore thee, and the sheer cliffs, so untoward is thy spirit." The sight of Odysseus to Penelope is as welcome as the sight of land to the shipwrecked mariner. The very name of the Euxine Sea is euphemistic for what iEschylus calls the " stepmother of ships." This attitude of fear naturally kept the Greeks from be coming very reckless sailors. " Nothing is worse than sea life for weakening a man, however strong he be," say even the Phaeaeians. The Greeks were averse to sailing in win ter, and Hesiod advises that ships be drawn up on the shore at the setting of the Pleiades. Man shows his superiority over the beasts by sailing the sea, says Sophocles: but put ting to sea in a storm is tempting the gods. Later poets vol. cxcix.?no. 700 28</page><page sequence="8">434 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW elaborated this idea into a dogma, maintaining that the sea is a divinely appointed barrier between nations. Horace was not the only Roman poet who considered the first sailor to have been armed with "aes triplex." Some modern critics have found fault with Tennyson's " Ulysses," on the ground that the Greeks never sailed at night. It is true that they were averse to such voyages; yet the Homeric heroes were sometimes compelled to make them. Telemachus sails for Pylos in the night in order to escape the notice of the suitors; Odysseus several times steered by the stars, and the Phaeacians brought him home by night, so that his arrival should not be known. Still, it must be remembered that these characters were under the especial care of the gods; and the Ulysses of Tennyson had no reasons but those of the poet for setting sail at dusk. Everybody remembers the touching passage in the "Odyssey" where Odysseus is confronted among the shades by his companion Elpenor, who has just died. Odysseus asks Elpenor: "How came you in this murky gloom? Faster you came on foot than I in my black ship." Elpe nor tells Odysseus of his death, and begs his lord to '' erect on the shore of the foaming sea the mound of an unhappy man, that future times may know. Do this for me, and fix upon my grave the oar with which in life I rowed among my comrades." The custom of honoring shipwrecked mar iners in this way gave rise to many very pathetic epitaphs as well as to other poems in the same spirit. Thus we may read the poem of Archias: Not even in death shall I, Theris, tossed shipwrecked upon land by the waves, forget the sleepless shores; for beneath the spray-beaten reefs, nigh the disastrous main, I found a grave at the hands of strangers, and forever do I wretchedly hear roaring even among the dead the hated thunder of the sea. (Translation of John William Mackail.) An interesting parallel with this attitude is that of the Hebrews. The " Great Sea " was regarded by them with a feeling of fear, almost of abhorrence. Their harbors, un like those of Greece, were few and poor. For them the sea was the abode of huge monsters, particularly of the evil power of " Rahab," or " Leviathan," or the " Serpent." This explains such passages as the apocalyptic description of St. John, in which the beast rises from the sea; and of</page><page sequence="9">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 435 his ideal conception of the new heaven, where " there shall be no more sea." Yet almost as strong as the Greeks' fear of the sea, and not altogether unmixed with it, are traces of a more rational feeling. They could not but recognize that however danger ous it was in its stormier hours, it was also a friendly power. Especially in the post-Homeric period it was looked upon as a great highway; but even before the Homeric age, the Ionians of Asia Minor had begun to explore the Mediter ranean, and they were born sailors. Of course their prox imity to the Phoenicians, the great sailors of antiquity, acted as a stimulus to them; but that they did not learn so much from them as some writers have supposed is shown by the fact that none of the Greek nautical terms come from the language of the Phoenicians. Yet it is likely, as many think, that the Homeric poet had them in mind in his descriptions of the " oar-loving Taphians," and signally of the Phaea cians. " For the Phseacians do not care for bow and quiver; only for masts and oars of ships, and the trim ships them selves, with which it is their joy to cross the foaming sea." So, as civilization advanced, the sea came more and more to be considered a path from country to country, no longer a barrier. Only in this way can we understand with what ecstasy, after long suffering and weariness far inland, the army of the Ten Thousand could cry, when it reached the mountain height from which it could behold the outspread Euxine, "The Sea! the Sea!" So, too, in the " Ajax " of Sophocles, the chorus of sailors, far from home, sings, " Would I were there, where the rock, thick-wooded and washed by the waves, hangs over the face of the deep, under Sunium's broad-jutting peak, that there we might hail, once again^ Athens, the holy, the blest." Ever since the days when the Ionian cities of Asia Minor had begun to send colonies to the Euxine and to Magna Graecia, the political importance of the sea had become large. Though the Greeks never became a thoroughly commer cial people, like the Phoenicians, they realized their debt to the sea in something the spirit of the medieval doo:es of Venice, who were betrothed to the sea, Indeed, shipping was even in the time of Homer so extensive that it became a profitable source of booty for pirates. Aristophanes ridi cules in the " Birds " the importance to which the navy has risen; the Hoopoe does not wish his city to be so near</page><page sequence="10">436 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW the sea that he may be disturbed any fine morning by the " Salaminia," the official galley. Even Plato had a strong aversion to founding his " second-best city" on the sea, since it was a " brackish neighbor, filling the streets with merchants and shopkeepers, and begetting in the souls of men uncertain and unfaithful ways." No people that sees its ships sail away to strange lands can fail to speculate about the goal of the voyage; and this is particularly true of the Greeks. They were in the habit of fashioning legends about their sailors. Jason embarked on a venture to win the mysterious golden fleece, far to the east; other adventurers sought for distant Islands of the Blessed in the domain of the sunset. Down to the times of Lucian, whose " True History " has been the model or the inspiration of countless tales of adventure, there was among the Greeks a very lively interest in foreign countries. In deed, it is hard to explain the Io episode in the " Prome theus Bound " by any other motive than a desire to satisfy the geographical curiosity of a naturally curious race. Schiller was half right when he wrote: They (the Greeks) do not attach themselves to nature with that depth of feeling, with that gentle melancholy, that characterizes the mod erns. . . . Their impatient imagination only traverses nature to pass beyond it to the drama of human life. ... It takes pleasure only in the spectacle of what is living and free. This is very largely true of Homer; but, as Professor Butcher points out, it is a hasty generalization, and is not altogether true of the rest of Greek literature. The Greeks did not always hear, with Wordsworth, in the sea, " the still, sad music of humanity "; they did not often fall into the meshes of what Ruskin has made famous by the term " pathetic fallacy "; they did not, like some of our Roman ticists, make of nature an enthusiastic cult: yet they were not unaffected by the human voice of the sea. Many are the accounts of men who walked or sat by the sea when they were troubled at heart. Thus Achilles, when mourning for Patroclus, " would roam wildly beside the beach of the salt sea." Odysseus, when he was the captive of Calypso, used to sit on the rocks and gaze at the sea, weeping. And when the Phaeacians had brought him home to Ithaca, before he knew where he was, he " sadly paced the shore of the resounding sea." The sailors pity Philoc tetes, " hearing in his loneliness the dashing of breakers on</page><page sequence="11">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 437 the shore." The brooding Daphnis of Theocritus sings " looking out upon Sicilian waters," and Polyphemus, in love with Galatea, " sat by the seaweed of the beach from the dawn of day," or " on the crest of a tall cliff, looking out upon the deep sea." For a mind whose imagination is heightened by suffering, it is easy to find in the commotion of the sea a counterpart of its own pain. In its simplest form, the relation becomes a simile. So in Homer: As when the great sea is troubled with a dumb wave, and dimly bodes the sudden paths of the shrill winds, but is still unmoved, nor yet rolled forward or to either side, until some steady gale comes down from Zeus,? even so the old man pondered. And the wrath of the gods against a house is compared by Sophocles to a storm on the Thracian coast. None of these examples, if they were found in a modern author, would be considered very subtle; the significant point is that the comparison is not, as in the other similes, that I have quoted, of a merely physical nature; there is an ethical idea besides. Such ideas are often more prominent. Just as " the blast of the most dread winds will lull to rest the groaning ocean," writes Sophocles, all troubles must have an end. Danae, in a fragment of Simonides, sings to her baby, '' Sleep, I bid thee, my child; and sleep, thou sea; and sleep, my immeasurable woe." In contrast to this, in Theocritus the girl Simaetha cries, " so silent is the sea, and silent are the winds; but the torment in my breast is never silent." Then, in the same way that the physical powers of nature were personified, the moral side is endowed with feeling, and is sometimes an actual personality. So in Theognis, " the primeval earth smiled, and the deep flood of the sea was glad." In -ZEschylus there are varying emotions. Though we have " the myriad laughter of the ocean waves," the sea elsewhere " cries out as it falls, and the depths make moan." A late poem in the Anthology speaks of the " glad ness " of the sea. All of these passages readily suggest such verses in the Bible as, " Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together." In " Dover Beach," Matthew Arnold describes the moon lit sea: Listen! you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling</page><page sequence="12">438 THE NOETH AMEEICAN EEVIEW At their return, up the high strand, Begin, and cease, and then again begin, With tremulous cadence slow, and bring The eternal note of sadness in. Sophocles long ago Heard it on the iEgean, and it brought Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow Of human misery. ... Though it is safe to say that there is more Arnold than Sophocles in these lines, nevertheless it is true that Soph ocles, as well as other poets of his period, thought easily in terms of the sea. Hard as it is to trace the scattered and confused cases in which these ideas occur, the effect of the feeling upon the poetic language of the Greeks is well marked. In Homer, the figures are easily visualized. The dead suitors are likened to the fish that a fisherman has caught. So, too, in ./Eschylus, the slaughter of an army is compared to tunny-fishing, and Clytaemnestra boasts of the murder of Agamemnon that she " cast around him a drag net as for fish." But in ^Eschylus figurative language is more and more transported to the realm of moral ideas. Perhaps the commonest metaphor in Greek poetry is that of aa sea of ills " with its many variants. Sometimes the conception is a little more defined. Aegeus seems to Medea a haven in storm, we read in Euripides; and so Peleus seems to Andromache. The figure of the ship of state, familiar through Theognis, Alcaeus, and Horace, has count less variations, such as the comparison of a prosperous but overweening man with a ship carrying too much sail, or too heavily freighted. It was for this that Polycrates threw his ring into the sea in vain, as Herodotus tells us. By the time of Sophocles, these figures had in a large measure become stereotyped as rhetorical conventions. When he wrote that a city was " tempest-tossed," very little of the original metaphorical force was left. The ideas had passed into the currency of common speech; they were like counters, or coinage, equivalent to certain fairly distinct ideas. OEdipus was " pilot of the ship " in much the same artificial sense in which Macbeth speaks of King Duncan as " the spring, the head, the fountain " of his sons' blood. A " whirling surge of chariots," though it may conceivably retain the original figure, is probably a mere convention. So we may explain away the mixed metaphor in Hamlet's soliloquy, by saying that Shakespeare no longer retained</page><page sequence="13">THE SEA IN THE GBEEK POETS 439 the original force of the figure in his '' sea of troubles.'' In Euripides these tropes are sometimes of a perfunctory nature, sometimes they are thought out with more care. So, we find, it is best with an angry people to slacken sheet and let the storm spend itself. We noticed in Homer that the epithet " sacred " or " divine " was applied to the sea. The early philosophers, too, dwellers beside the great presence of the sea, gave it a supernatural place in their systems. Thales based every thing on water; Xenophanes declared, " We all spring from earth and water"; Heracleitus supposed water to be a mani festation of fire; and Empedocles made it one of his four elements. In the same way the sea was regarded as peculiarly the portion of the gods. An interesting light is thrown on this peculiar and sometimes almost superstitious belief by Greek notions of the lustral character of water. In order to understand them fully we should have to go far into folklore; yet it seems clear that their origin is to be sought, as one would expect, in the simple cleansing effect of water, gradually idealized. When OEdipus bathed before his strange disappearance, a spiritual purification was supposed to accompany his bodily ablutions. Such is the origin of Jewish rites of purification by washing, and of the baptism of the Christian Church.* Telemachus washed his hands before prayer, in accordance with the belief that clean hands and a pure heart go to gether. And so Hecuba wished to wash Polyxena in sea water before her death. Aristophanes, in burlesque, makes iEschylus parody Euripides by having a dream washed away with water. In Apollonius Bhodius, Circe washed her hair and garments in the sea. Even more than the water of a spring, the sea was felt by its very vastness to have a lustral power. There are a num ber of examples of this belief, cast in such a form as to bear a striking resemblance to the famous passage in " Macbeth." Says the unknown writer of an epigram preserved in a manuscript in the Laurentian Library, " For the holy, a sprinkling of water sufficeth; but a wicked man the whole 1 From representations in art, as well as from passages in the poets, it appears that the mythological birth of Aphrodite from the sea has a close connection with her ritual bath; she renewed her virginity from time to time in this bath (as did also Athene and Hera). Perhaps we may find a parallel to this in St. Paul's analogy between baptism and a death and "newness of life." (Rom. viM 3, 4.)</page><page sequence="14">440 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW ocean cannot wash in its floods." In Sophocles we read, " Nay, not all the stream of Istros or of Phasis I deem could wash this house clean." And, as if in echo, Shakespeare speaks : Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red. Nor has Keats forgotten The moving waters at their priest-like task Of pure ablution round earth's human shores. Prom such passages it is striking to turn and read in Euripides what I believe to be the most modern line in all Greek literature?a line spoken, to be sure, with double entente, yet designed to be understood by the hearer in its larger sense. Thoas, the barbarian king, asks Iphigeneia why she wishes to wash the supposedly polluted statue of the goddess in the sea. She replies in a line that might have been written by Swinburne, " The sea doth wash away all ills of men.'' As in the preceding poets we found no one conception of the sea supplanting all others, in Euripides this fact is even more noticeable. He was not writing in an age that was just opening its eyes to a new and wonderful world; the Greek genius, when once it had budded, was soon in flower, and Euripides found himself heir to a great legacy of traditional ideas. So we find " a sea of trouble " recurring many times, more as a stock expression than as a spontaneous metaphor. Yet he weighed his expressions with care; for as his faith in the gods of his fathers was an effort, not a natural impulse, so his figures were the tools of an artist, not the carelessly picturesque expressions of the actual observer. Nevertheless, there is in many of his plays a sus tained atmosphere of the sea. With a felicitous touch of humanity, he makes the chorus of Argive maidens, in the " Taurian Iphigeneia," exiled far from home, picture their joyous voyage home, Pan piping the stroke and cheering the rowers, Phoebus singing to the lyre, while the oar-blades splashed, and the swelling sail stretched the halliards taut, as the ship swept along. It is customary to exaggerate the amount of the so-called " modern spirit " that is found in the Anthology. Here the</page><page sequence="15">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 441 various sea-gods are frequently petitioned for happy voyages, just as in earlier poets, but it is largely as a mat ter of convention. It is noticeable that the lesser sea divinities take the place, to a considerable extent, of the earlier and more powerful gods. Thus Priapus and other minor gods are several times thanked for calm weather. In deed, the heroic and creative age of Greece was gone, and it remained for the Alexandrians to express in faultless verse the modest emotions of their own age. In most cases they worked on a small scale; their pictures were miniatures, their poetic descriptions were verse cameos. Oftenest such bits of nature are used solely for the background of the human drama, and are introduced for their picturesque and atmospheric possibilities. The most direct relation of the sea to the Greeks of the Anthology is expressed by the epitaphs of shipwrecked sailors, sometimes placed over their graves on the shore, sometimes on cenotaphs, and frequently written merely as literary exercises. Most of these epitaphs, however, be moan the harshness of the sea. " Sailor," reads one, " ask not whose tomb I am, but be thine own fortune a kinder sea." On the other hand, the feeling of love for the sea, which I have already discussed, is brought out in an epitaph, attributed to Plato, on the Eretrian exiles who died far in land in Persia; they cry ' * farewell, dear sea.'' The picturesque side of the sea is reflected in several short descriptions of spring on the coast, treated more from the point of view of Hesiod than with spontaneous lyric enthusiasm. Earely, a fanciful poet will attribute emotions to the sea, or make it the type of his own experiences, or by an act of imagination lose himself in the sea. So, in a late period, Paulus Silentiarius saw by the convention of an epigrammatic writer the image of his beloved in the sea. Theocritus treats the sea differently. His descriptions are not those of a self-conscious artist, artistic though they be. They come at first hand from one who has lived in the open air, among a sea-going people. The rugged, gray haired fishermen that he introduces into his idyls are of flesh and blood; he has been in their wattled cabins, reclined on their beds of sea-moss, and handled their fishing-rods and seines and oars. He has heard them tell their stories and dreams, and has heard from their lips such popular be liefs as that a stone falling into the sea is a good omen.</page><page sequence="16">442 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW " They had no neighbor by them, but ever against their narrow cabin gently floated up the sea." And that is why Theocritus was able to give such life-like pictures of the sea and its followers?why his Twenty-first Idyl, like Words worth's " Michael," is more truly pastoral than anything that Vergil, or Mantuan, or Sannazaro, or Spenser could ever write. He had gazed long days at the blue Sicilian sea with its foam-crested waves,? those graceful, fan-like jets of silver upon the rocks, which softly rise aloft like water-spirits from the deep, then shiver, and break, and spread, and shroud themselves, and disappear, in a soft mist of foam.x He knew it, too, in its tempest days: The winds raise huge billows about the stern, yea, or from the prow, or even as each wind wills, and cast them into the hold of the ship, and shatter both bulwarks, while with the sail hangs all the gear confused and broken, and the storm-rain falls from heaven as night creeps on, and the wide sea rings, being lashed by the gusts, and by showers of iron hail. Yet it is not only as a spectacle that he saw the sea. He still retained the old mythology, much as Homer had built it, with the same ocean stream and the same gods. But this he did with freshness of touch. His similes, not plentiful, are more sincere than startling. Of this kind is the com parison between the ruinous effects of love and a storm at sea. His figure in which Atalanta leaps into " deep waters of desire " may well be compared with the idea of Heine's " Lorelei " and of Goethe's " Fischer." One might prolong this study far into the centuries that followed; yet among the minor poets of the decline, few gave voice to any new conceptions of the sea,. The gamut of their emotions had already been sounded, and they did little more than try new variations on familiar themes. Down to Lucian, whose dialogues burlesque the absurdities of an thropomorphism, and whose " True History " parodies with Attic salt the romantic and adventure-seeking tenden cies of the day, we find the artless fancy of the sea-lover side by side with the conscious images of the moralist. If we look in Greek poetry for any one attitude toward the sea, we must be disappointed; there were many concep tions, and few attempts were ever made to distinguish them. But were we to seek for any one conclusion, it would have to be that the Greeks, though often deeply moved by the sea, 1 Newman, "Historical Sketches."</page><page sequence="17">THE SEA IN THE GREEK POETS 443 and highly imaginative in their conceptions of its nature, regarded it in general as an external object. For them, man remained the measure of all things; when they animated the sea, it was by anthropomorphism; when they idealized it, the process was in terms of humanity. Though the chorus of the world's life may be in the sea-tide, the chant itself, they believed, is sung by mankind. In this sense, then, we must look at their life, a life spent on the margin of the sea, always mindful of its presence, yet never surrendered to it. So far as the sea was real, it gained its reality by entering into man's life. If it made life terrible, or joyful, or won derful, the sea was given a place in their world as a thing of terror, or of joy, or of wonder. But " the blue waves, unconquerable and restless," have lasted while the thoughts of man have ebbed and flowed, and we have sometimes gone to the sea for a touchstone in a too uncertain world. So later ages have loved the poetry that is so full of the ocean's life. It is striking to read that Walt Whitman used to shout Pope's Homer to the waves of the New Jersey coast. And it has been granted to few poets of our age to surpass the poignancy of Mr. Lang's fine sonnet, with its magnificent closing cadence: So gladly, from the songs of modern speech Men turn, and see the stars, and feel the free Shrill wind beyond the close of heavy flowers, And through the music of the languid hours, They hear like Ocean on a western beach The surge and thunder of the Odyssey.
