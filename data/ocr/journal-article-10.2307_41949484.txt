He was subsequently transported to the gruesome French intern- ment camp at Vernuche near Nerves. Within a few days of his arrival at the camp, which made few concessions to its prisoners' human dignity, Benjamin began to hold an outdoor seminar "for advanced students," charging a tuition fee of three cigarettes, or alternatively, one button. Along with a small group of interested inmates, he convened regular meetings on straw-covered ground beneath a suspended blanket in order to launch an academic camp journal. Drinking contraband schnapps from a thimble, Benjamin, to the amazement of the other prisoners, conducted these edito- rial meetings with a ceremonious rigor that stood in marked contrast to the camp's macabre living conditions. (19-20) Benjamin's phantasmatic seminar testifies in rather heart-wrenching ways to the necessity of theory in a crisis, as well as to the perseverance of Benjamin's thought well after he took his own exiled life on the border between France and Spain almost exactly a year later. In the famous final "Theses on the Philosophy of History," Benjamin insists that the "state of emergency" is "not the exception but the rule," for " [t]he current amaze- ment that the things we are experiencing are 'still' possible in the twenti- eth century is not philosophical" (Benjamin 1968b, 256). Indeed, what is philosophical for Benjamin is the restless pursuit of philosophy itself, the rescue that comes with Thought. Neither a state of cessation or exception, the internment camp is here what Giorgio Agamben calls "in some sense . . . the hidden matrix and nomos of the political space in which we still live," the space out of which Benjamin came to understand more intimately the "barbarism" undergirding both law and history (Agamben 2000, 37). But the tableau also bears witness to Benjamin's assertion in One-Way Street that "work is the death mask of its conception," a cryptic formulation which signals not political nihilism or philosophical solipsism, but a recognition of a future responsibility disconnected from the myth of origins, of work performed in the name of something else and to come (Benjamin 1996a, 459). If Benjamin's lifelong commitment to unmasking historicism's</page><page sequence="3">Nieland and Juengel • 191 self-confidence in favor of a theory of radically open-ended and immanent experience became more urgent with the rise of fascism in Europe, then perhaps we can view Benjamin's uncanny discipline at Vernuche as a sum- mons to think with Benjamin again, now, as certain political imperatives in our own time urge us to linger over his example. It is by now a critical commonplace to observe and bemoan the "Ben- jamin industry" that has delivered dozens of scholarly monographs, essay collections, special issues of journals, multivolume translations of the selected writings, and literally hundreds of critical articles since the early eighties. Indeed, it might be argued that it is increasingly difficult to think modernity, or visual culture, or historical materialism apart from Benjamin's shaping, if always elusive, influence : moreover, the breathtaking range, lyri- cism, and esoteric nature of his thought tempts readers from an array of dis- ciplines to find elective affinities with Benjamin, all emboldened perhaps by Benjamin's own central concept of Jetztzeit, the "now-time" of the past flash- ing up in the dangerous present.1 In his "Afterword" to a recent special vol- ume of boundary 2 ("Benjamin Now: Critical Encounters with The Arcades Project "), Kevin McLaughlin revisits Benjamin's doctoral dissertation, The Concept of Criticism in German Romanticism (1920), to retrieve the concept of "criticizability," the potential for immanent critique that completes or rep- resents ( Darstellung : also "performs") the work of art; or as Benjamin avers, "if there is present in the work a reflection that can unfold itself, absolutize itself, and resolve itself in the medium of art - then it is a work of art" (quoted in McLaughlin 2003, 195). That Benjamin saw in the program of a coming philosophy of art the necessity of critical prose, McLaughlin argues, suggests our ongoing reflective encounter "that puts the work to work and, in the indispensability of doing so, exceeds the limits of a classic concept of the work as a self-contained entity" (197). The inexhaustibility of reflection - holding open even as it is animating the act of judgment - inti- mates something of the always unfinished work of Benjamin's reader.2 In what follows, we have surveyed a wide range of recent Benjaminian interventions in the hopes of understanding both the urgency of Benjamin's thought, and our persistent contemporary reclamation of his</page><page sequence="4">192 # Benjamin's Urgency philosophical improvisations. As the makeshift seminar at Vernuche illus- trates all too starkly, criticism and totalitarianism are never-ending and perhaps mutually defining projects, each venturing to foreclose the other: just as it is imperative that we not think of fascism as an aberration of his- tory, as ever fully present, so is it vital that criticism continue to provide "a general deconstruction of the history in which our own provenance lies" (Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, 1990, 312). In the spirit of this perpetual inquiry, and ever mindful of our own more contemporary catastrophes, we sought out the political and ethical stakes of thinking with Benjamin in an( other) age of terror, hoping to reflect finally on the exigencies of experi- ence, history, and the lingering promise of a deconstructive humanism. 000 The question of politics in Benjamin is intimately bound to his under- standing of the nature of experience. And because Benjamin's varied medi- tations on experience are so complexly embedded in this category's Romantic heritage and its historical transformations, all rigorous reckon- ings with Benjamin's concept of the political must perforce grapple with its experiential contours and their pesky metaphysical trappings. In many ways, it is this fraught conceptual imbrication in Benjamin's thought of "the political" with the historical contours of modern experience that con- nects the otherwise diverse critical and theoretical labors of Howard Caygill's Walter Benjamin: The Colour of Experience (1998), Lutz Koepnick's Walter Benjamin and the Aesthetics of Power (1999), and Krzysztof Ziarek's The Historicity of Experience : Modernity, the Avant-Garde, and the Event (2001). Whereas Koepnick implicitly values experiential configurations that would remove the political from a state of exception and embed it within a bourgeois realm of facts, norms, and values, Caygill and Ziarek use Benjamin to think the politics of a transformational mode of experience irreducible to normative and cognitive closure. Koepnick's lucid and carefully-argued study - the most thorough exam- ination to date of Benjamin's understanding of aesthetic politics - locates the specific strength of Benjamin's critique of German fascism first in the</page><page sequence="5">Nieland and Juengel # 193 realization that "fascism ferociously finalizes what capitalist modernity ever since the middle of the nineteenth century has done all along. It mobi- lizes technological and economic rationalization against the normative substance of political modernity, against post-Enlightenment values of political justice, equality, freedom, and democracy" (Koepnick 1999, 12). Second, because Benjamin understands fascist aestheticization primarily as the political orchestration of experience - as the total mobilization of sen- sory perception - his historical critique of fascism is necessarily bound to a "materialist history of individual and collective experience" (12). Thus, Koepnick consistently underscores Benjamins critique of the anesthetiz- ing of experience that accompanies fascism s attempts to "drive the politi- cal beyond all facts, norms, and values "(31). Through this critique, Koepnick hopes to revise critical accounts of the aesthetic politics of the Third Reich, accounts that understand fascist poli- tics as a "full-blown attack on modern differentiation," as the supplanting of political values with aesthetic experiences in order to "do away with what Kant, Weber, Habermas, or Luhmann, each in his own way, under- stands as the hallmark of the modern condition - namely cognitive, nor- mative, and functional differentiation" (1999, 2). For Koepnick, Benjamins arguments about aesthetic politics are best understood as a critique of the "autonomy of the political," as a deep suspicion about the way aesthetic politics aim "to redefine the political as an autonomous realm of absolute self-referentiality privileging cultic forms over ethical norms " (3). As a result, the political becomes the site of "existential self-assertion," at which "nothing less than authenticity comes into being" (3). In this sense, Koepnick turns to Benjamin to describe fascist politics as an engine of rad- ical difference, one that pursues "its own project of differentiation, auton- omization, and modernization" by severing political action from "normative debates," moving the state "beyond bourgeois-democratic codes of legality, morality, and political emancipation" (3). Koepnick pursues this argument by carefully tracking three versions of Benjamins aestheticization thesis. The first incarnation, Koepnick argues, emerges in the Trauerspiel* s metaphysical examination of power in the context of Baroque drama, and the tacit critique Benjamin offers of his</page><page sequence="6">194 • Benjamin's Urgency contemporary Carl Schmitt 's "political existentialism" (1999, 37). Here, Koepnick compellingly juxtaposes the deployment of the aesthetic in Baroque drama against the formulation of aesthetic autonomy Benjamin offers in the "Goethe's Elective Affinities" essay, in which "what is ethical about aesthetic artifacts lies solely in their limitation of the range of art . . . art constitutes itself by means of its very separation from the spheres of pol- itics and morality, through difference rather than totalization" (39). The rulers of Baroque drama, by contrast, draw on aesthetic spectacle to natu- ralize their authority and thereby conceal the very fragility of their power. As such, Baroque drama testifies "to the origin of modern, secularized con- ceptions of power and realpolitik," echoing Schmitťs construction of sov- ereignty, similarly dependent upon the "spectacular enactment of leadership in the public realm, on the total visibility of power" (45, 44). Schmitťs decisionism, like Baroque drama, betrays its own attempt to secure the autonomy of the political and "foils the ethical self-limitation of art," thus pushing politics towards "the abyss of aestheticism" (4 s).3 The second version of the aestheticization thesis hinges on the materialist account of history and experience Benjamin renders in the "Artwork" essay, in which fascism's aesthetic politics depends on its instrumentalization of industrial culture: its falsification of premodern community in auratic, cul- tic spectacles that colonize and anesthetize "peculiarly modern structures of seeing, perception, and experience" (5). In its third iteration, which Koepnick unearths in the Arcades Project, the aestheticization thesis con- nects fascist spectacle's particular combination of industry and aura, progress and cultism, to the visual dynamics of the capitalist phantasmago- ria, an expansive form of commodity fetishism that wraps the technologi- cal trappings of capitalist progress in a mystifying and compensatory aura. Caygill and Ziarek, on the other hand, are less specifically interested in Benjamin's critique of National Socialism's colonization of experience than they are in offering more rigorous accounts of Benjamin's concept of expe- rience - accounts that consistently work within a political field of impli- cation. Taking as his point of departure Benjamin's encounter with the Kantian system in "The Programme of the Coming Philosophy," Caygill offers nothing less than a systematic review of Benjamin's oeuvre as</page><page sequence="7">Nieland and Juengel # 195 sustained attempt to articulate a "speculative" concept of experience, a pro- gram that thus lends philosophical continuity to the critical bifurcation of Benjamin's thought into two cycles: what Benjamin called the "'Ģermānis tic' phase" ending in the Trauerspiel study, and the " One-Way Street phase," culminating in the unfinished Passagen Werk (Caygill 1998, xi-xii). By a "speculative concept of experience," Caygill means experience that accommodates an immanent Absolute and thus remains resolutely futurai, contingent, and open to infinite transformation (4). Thus, whereas Kant demarcates the parameters of experience in a fashion that excludes the Absolute from the faculties of intuition (space and time) and all but moral experience, Benjamin counters with an "intensive metaphysics in which space and time are informed by an immanent totality" (6), an Absolute man- ifest in the very distortions, warps, and complex patterning of space-time. At first glance, Ziarek's resolutely deconstructive approach to the cate- gory of experience would seem to have very little truck with the metaphys- ical Benjamin that Caygill so trenchantly defamiliarizes. While not a study of Benjamin per se, The Historicity of Experience draws extensively on the for- mulation of experience in Benjamin and Heidegger to offer a profound reap- praisal of the nature of the twentieth-century avant-garde as primarily a critique and redefinition of the concept of experience itself. Turning to an exhilarating range of avant-gardists (not just the historical avant-garde of Dada, but also Gertrude Stein, the Russian futurist Velimir Khlebnikov, and the language poets Miron Bialoszewski and Susan Howe), Ziarek argues that the political radicality of the avant-garde should be understood primarily as an attempt to reconfigure experience as an event. By the "event-structure of experience," Ziarek means an experience imbued with historicity, an expe- rience that is, like the "propriative event" ( Ereignis ) in Heidegger's phe- nomenological formulation, always a "simultaneous coming into presence and withdrawal in which what is becomes measurable and representable only at the expense of suppressing historicity" (Ziarek 2001, 13). Because Ziarek's Heidegger is deconstruction's Heidegger - Nancy's Heidegger - Ziarek's event-structured or historicized experience is never a self-identical "temporal punctuality or an instant of presence, but instead, a dynamic and open-ended field of forces, whose historicity prevents experience from</page><page sequence="8">196 # Benjamin's Urgency closing into representational constructs, psychic spaces, or lived instants" (14). As a result, event-structured experience, sharing the temporal disloca- tion and "radical de-essentialization of happening" itself, is "always open to the future and to transformation" (4). The critical thrust of this historicized formulation of experience - one that, for Ziarek, links Benjamin to other- wise disparate philosophical projects of both Heidegger and Irigaray and, beyond them, to the broader project of the avant-garde - lies in its challenge to three alternative formulations of experience in modernity: 1) the priva- tized, subjectivized, isolated experience of aestheticism; 2) the metaphysical understanding of experience in terms of presence; and 3) the ruthless, tech- nological determination and instrumentalization of experience in "techno- scientific modes of perception" (6). Thus, both Ziarek and Caygill pin the hopes of Benjaminian experience on its futurai and transformative capacity. But where Ziarek asserts that experience can only be open-ended and exces- sive so long as it remains anti-metaphysical, for Caygill, the futurai dimen- sion of experience inheres in Benjamin's intensive metaphysics, in the historicity - or in Caygills terms, the "spatio-temporal distortions" - of an immanent Absolute. Benjamin's politics of experience begin to emerge as Caygill notes a cru- cial discrepancy between Benjamin's two ways of understanding this "immanent totality": "The first stresses complexity, and looks to the ways in which an immanent totality may manifest itself in the complex patterns and distortions of spatio-temporal experience. The other dissolves space and time into totality, and threatens to collapse the complexity of spatio- temporal patterning into a closed 'redemptive' immanence" (Caygill 1998, 6). For Ziarek, it is this second notion of totality that is in fact the chief antagonist of historicity, linked in his account to the twin threats techno- logical reproduction poses towards experience, dangers that materialize most pressingly in the artwork: on the one hand, the artwork becomes aes- theticized and thus follows the broader reduction of the human sensorium to the "lived moment" (Erlebnis), becoming inconsequential and danger- ously isolated from historical and political memory ( Erfahrung ); on the other hand, the artworks perceived isolation from the everyday sparks the transformation of art into a recuperative, totalizing mode of experience,</page><page sequence="9">Nieland and Juengel # 197 the redemptive immanence of totalitarian myth. Both of these orders threaten to collapse the complexity of historicity in the self-presence of the present, now steeled against alterity : "Invested with authenticity and power, the present can either authorize itself as its own ground" in the punctuality of shock experience absent historical memory, or "transfer this authority onto a prehistoric, mythical origin, thereby making possible a totalization of experience at the expense of otherness and difference. In either case, the dis- cursive and political effects of the erasure of alterity in the wake of the col- lapse of Erfahrung into Erlebnis become apparent" (Ziarek 2001, 47). It is to Caygill's credit that he countenances the moments in Benjamins own writing that veer towards the dissolution of historicity's complexity into "an absolute immanent purity," those moments of "'pure spirit' which abolish any trace of externality or remainder" (here Caygill names the for- mulations of "voice" in "On Language as Such and the Language of Man," divine violence in "Critique of Violence," and "pure language" in "On the Mimetic Faculty" [Caygill 1998, 6]). More impressive, though, is the way Caygill connects the politics of experience to Benjamin's "transcendental but speculative philosophy," and the two kinds of infinities it mobilizes: one, a transcendental, Kantian infinity that consists of an "infinity of pos- sible marks on a given surface (or perceptions within a given framework of possible experience)"; the other, a speculative infinity that understands any given "surface," or framework of experience, as "but one of an infinite set of possible surfaces or conditions of experience" (4). This formula- tion - "one of an infinite set" - is one of Caygill's favorites. For example, in a fascinating reading of Benjamin's seldom-mentioned early writings on painting, Caygill describes "colour" as a trope for precisely this speculative infinity of experiential configuration; having no fixed value, color's infinite variety - its manifold complexity - can only be reduced to a graphic mark on a singular surface with certain violence. So, because Benjamin's specu- lative concept of experience remains always open to color - to the emer- gence of alternative experiential surfaces - the experiential decay of modernity must perforce produce flashing glimpses of (or porous passages to) other potential frameworks for experience. It is here, for Caygill, that a speculative concept of freedom emerges, but it is a freedom that is "less a</page><page sequence="10">198 # Benjamin's Urgency programme than the occasion of an unexpected transition made possible by one of the gaps, warps, or breaks in the continuity of experience" (26-27). Such tenuous freedom appears, for example, in the experiential potential of the modern city, which Benjamin repeatedly thinks through non-Kantian concepts like "porosity," "threshold," and "shock," concepts which show the space and time of the Paris arcades to be "not fixed and continuous forms of intuition," but rather "in the process of continual but discontinuous transformation," opening speculative moments of excess within reified experience (124). If freedom, in Caygill 's account, is the name of the moment when expe- rience reveals itself to be colorful, then violence is the antagonist of color's complexity - the black-and-white reduction of configuration to an impov- erished surface. One of the great strengths of Caygills book is its ability to track Benjamin's critique of this violence in a variety of texts with seem- ingly disparate concerns: in the early language and translation essays, in his metacritical texts, in the "Artwork" essay, and in his writings on the city. So, in his brilliant discussion of Benjamin's language and translation essays, Caygill notes that Benjamin's noninstrumental account of language's dig- nity depends upon its role as a "sphere of speechlessness," which is to say, a space of the Absolute immanent in language, conveying "at once meaning and the limits of meaning, the sayable and the unsayable" (1998, 14). Applying the transcendental/speculative distinction to language, Caygill argues that the transcendental view understands "language as an infinitely extended field of possible utterances," while a speculative view of language would see it "as a mode of designation and intention capable of generating an infinite number of languages" (15). For Benjamin, the "true speculative condition of the discrete languages is 'the creative word of God"' (19). And violence is the name for the usurpation of this speculative condition in translation, when one "language surface arrogates the role of the divine word and considers itself to be the source and measure of all the others" (22). 4 Nonviolent translation, by contrast, refuses translation's penchant to reduce the other to the same; instead, the word in translation would be col- orful , "having no fixed meaning but existing in a state of continual trans- formation according to its relationship with" other languages. Nonviolent</page><page sequence="11">Nieland and Juengel # 199 translation thus names the encounter between incompatible infinities, in which "each language is transformed by and transforms the others" (20). This kind of mutually transformative mode of ethical translation reap- pears in Benjamin s notion of critique, which is for Caygill a "speculative critique" whose operation he traces from the early Benjamin's thesis on German Romanticism to the late Benjamin's interest in the modern epic. In the speculative critical mode (a more precise mode of immanent critique), critique and its object are in a continual process of speculative transforma- tion. The political contours of this critical strategy emerge in Benjamin's critique of Romantic epistemology. If experience is infinite configuration, then, Benjamin adduces, the critical work of Romantic reflection is trou- bled insofar as all reflection is infinitely mediated by more reflection. Critique's task, then, is to avoid the twin dangers of dogmatic finitude on the one hand (stating "all the formal possibilities in the work, thus trans- forming them into timeless necessities") and skeptical infinity on the other (dissolving "the formal constitution of the given work by the potentially endless invention of contingent, counterfactual formal possibilities") (Caygill 1998, 45). What Caygill calls speculative critique's middle ground is a kind of compromise between considerations of the artwork's form as immanent potential or as mere contingency: "Critique becomes the intro- duction of contingency into the form of the work . . . critique disturbs the identity of the work by opening it to future possibilities, but it does so with- out transforming its immanent possibilities into necessities nor by dissolv- ing them into contingencies (46). The critical task, in other words, is to keep the artwork open to the future, as "one of a number of possible configurations of experience." Indeed, the recurrence of formulations like this - "one of an infinite number of possible configurations" - throughout The Colour of Experience suggests that for Caygill, as for Agamben, Benjamin is primarily a theorist of potential. Thus, the politics of art, and of criticism, are determined by the art- work's relationship to its experiential borders: "If the borders of the work of art are impermeable and closed, then the work is immutable, defying time and change; if they are permeable and open, then the work is con- stantly in the process of transformation, becoming other than itself"</page><page sequence="12">200 # Benjamin's Urgency (Caygill 1998, 93). For Caygill, it is the contraction or expansion of the aes- thetics experiential parameters with which Benjamin demarcates the political in the "Artwork" essay: fascism, like aestheticism, is a regressive mode of experiential border-patrolling that "seeks to monumentalize the phantasm of a present and authentic identity and model of experience, while communism . . . affirms the flux of identity and the permanent revo- lution of the organization of experience" (103). The ambivalent politics of the artwork, Caygill argues, inhere in the deployment of its technological reproducibility to either "resist the change in experience, to monumental- ize the present, or ... to promote the transformation of experience" that anti-auratic cinematic technology itself abets - here, specifically, by destroying the intuitive conditions of experience in Kant's formulation (space and time), dissolving auratic spatio-temporal borders of objects, and through the optical unconscious, revealing the more expansive experi- ential possibilities of technological second nature (95). In Caygill s model, then, the optical unconscious is yet another manifestation of "an absolute which is immanent to experience but which manifests itself in inconspicu- ous and indirect ways" (112). Koepnick's and Ziarek's meditations on the "Artwork" essay di- chotomize the progressive or reactionary politics of the aesthetic through a related constellation of oppositions: monumental identity and flux, stasis and transformation, closure and rupture. Koepnick's insightful chapter "Aesthetic Dictatorship" establishes the terms of Benjamin's attack on fas- cism's "presentation of political action as the culmination of artistic origi- nality" (Koepnick 1999, 86) through a conceptual triad of productive modes - the forces of creation, formation, and conjuration - that Benjamin delineates in the "Goethe" essay in order to discriminate between "incom- patible forms of action and [to] delimit quasi-autonomous spheres of knowledge and ethical responsibility" (87). Creation, the sphere of life, "brings forth a world from nothingness," while formation - the mode of production of autonomous art - names the energy with which artists endow the "chaos of the given world with form," the production of Schoein that "interrupts the flow of time and the metamorphoses of space" (87).</page><page sequence="13">Nieland and Juengel # 201 Conjuration, by contrast, presents "life as art and art as life," claiming falsely that it "can bring forth a world out of nothing," thus falsely appro- priating "the ethics of origin and continuity inherent to creation" (87). The "Artwork" essay's critique of the claims for autonomy made by aestheti- cism and fascism and its related celebration of technical reproducibility are thus predicated on Benjamin's sense that "any appeal to the principle of formation . . . has become potentially complicit with conjuration," whereby war itself "emerges as a self-referential work that resists discursive ques- tioning," calling "for awe and submission, not for normative debates or moral criticism" (90, 97). And thus, Koepnick explains, Benjamin turns to a "postaesthetic theory of production and experience" and, beyond that, to "postbourgeois concepts of rupture, openness, and collective authorship or reception" modeled in the work of Brecht, Valéry, and Eisenstein (91). For Ziarek, on the other hand, the politics of Benjamin's newly postaes- thetic work of art lie in the artwork 's ability to unfold the historicity of experience - its event-structure - that frustrates both "punctuality of expe- rience [Erlebnis] and the temptation of a totalizing, mytho-poetic recuper- ation of being" (Ziarek 2001, 84). Here, the other side of fascist spectacle's monumental self-referentiality is not "discursive questioning" and "nor- mative" debates, but rather the dislocating singularity of the event enacted in the artworks structure of reproducibility, in the self-disjunctive shock of what Samuel Weber has dubbed "reproducibility as a mode of being."5 Because the reproducible artwork, operating on the model of the linguistic event, "guards against the erasure of otherness in the totality of history by interrupting, to paraphrase Nancy, its myth of unity, such postaesthetic work also deploys the singularity of the event historically" (84). Thus, this interruptive singularity points not to a stable discursive realm of norms, fact, and value, but rather brings about the "recognition of how the discur- sive formulations of experience are liable to continuous reinvention and reinscription in light of their historicity" (84). Insofar as Ziarek links the event-structure of the reproducible artwork to the eventful temporality of the dialectical image, his account may be considered the extrapolation to the domain of experience of David Ferris 's useful formulation that for</page><page sequence="14">202 # Benjamin's Urgency Benjamin, the political is "the advent of a present, a now that disarticulates the continuity of the past and, in so doing heralds a politics that will be known as revolution" (Ferris 1996, 19).6 Koepnick, by contrast, understands Benjamins "anti-evolutionary and catastrophic conception of history" as Habermas does - as the very suspension of "any meaningful notion of polit- ical action" (Koepnick 1999, 169, 170).7 At this point, it is worth lingering a bit on the language of alterity, ethics, and violence that surfaces in these accounts. To what extent, we might ask, are these reckonings with Benjamins politics of experience suspicious of similar violences? And what do they suggest about the relationship in Benjamin's work between experience and ethical responsibility? Here, we might notice how the dubious move that Caygill calls becoming the "source of configuration" (that which flattens the color of experience) is quite close to what Ziarek identifies as the self-authorization and self-grounding of the present (that which erases the historicity of experience). Both moves would lay claim to the forces of creation that posit origin and continuity, and that, in Koepnicks account, are falsely appropriated by fascist spectacle s politics of conjuration. Consistently posed against alterity - variously understood in these accounts as color (Caygill), historicity (Ziarek), and "those peculiarly modern structures of seeing, perception, and experience" fascist spectacle would domesticate (Koepnick) - these instantiations of origin recall the "pure violence" that Benjamin, in his "Critique of Violence," associates with the divine and the messianic.8 Taken together, these studies locate Benjamins political relevance in his thinking of expansive forms of experi- ence resistant to closure, continuity, and origin, and in his sensitivity to the ethico-political violences attending experiential reduction. It is really only Caygill, though, who underscores Benjamin s dialectical approach to expe- riential decay - the way his trenchant analysis of "the destruction of tradi- tional forms of community and their relations to nature by the development of capitalist social relations and technology" is inseparable from his "assess- ment of the chances for an active, even religious nihilism which nests within the decay of experience, manifesting itself above all in the experience of des- titution" (Caygill 1998, xiii). Benjamin s urgency thus lies in his attempt to think together both the terms of enriched experience and the potential of</page><page sequence="15">Nieland and Juengel # 203 experiential poverty by turning his attention to the destroyed subject of experience and to the ethical imperatives of new human physis - immanent, embodied, thingly - emerging in the wake of God's remotion.9 It is Beatrice Hanssen who perhaps provides the most comprehensive and vital account of the "logic of decay" that follows from modern secular- ization, a logic "left in the wake of the excision of the transcendent" and rooted in the natural history that/of remains (Hanssen 1998, 11). Unlike Susan Buck-Morss s conception of a "natural history" discoverable in the fossilized surfaces of capitalism's vanishing, Hanssen's Walter Benjamin's Other History : Of Stones , Animals, Human Beings, and Angels voices an "ethico-theological" call within Benjamin's materialist historiography that recalls "more primordial forms of responsibility and justice that antedate the hegemony of the Greek ontophilosophical tradition" (5). 10 Beginning from Benjamin's and Adorno's oft-noted recoil from Heidegger's ontolo- gization of history - which devalued, among other things, the crucial notion of transience - Hanssen seeks to outline a version of natural history that at once radically undermines Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment historicity, and decenters, if not dismantles, the human subject that organ- izes its meaning (Sinn). Her argument foregrounds decay and transience as dialectical principles, thus following Adorno's 1932 lecture "The Idea of Natural History" in countering an ahistorical or prehistorical arche with the coinherence of nature and history, and the subsequent material processes of decline. But where Adorno focused attention on Benjamin's Trauerspiel and its anti-idealist concept of history, Hanssen projects that text's melancholic, anti-humanist disposition over the whole of the Benjaminian canon and teases out a consistent, if sometimes understated, ethical imperative, one that allows her to read, say, Benjamin's essay on Goethe s Elective Affinities as "a Kierkegaardian ethics of decision ( Entscheid - ung)" and "an existential embrace of death," as well as "a notable attempt to think through the categories of salvation and redemption " (83). Hanssen's Benjamin is thus a Benjamin in dialogue with Lévinas, the later Derrida, and Adorno - a Benjamin not unlike the Heidegger he consistently, if problematically, opposed, striving to overcome the shortfalls of human- ism even as he barely skirts the fascist orientation he fears.</page><page sequence="16">204 • Benjamin's Urgency Hanssen's study is divided into two sections, with the first detailing the vicissitudes of Benjamins "mourning play" thesis and his strategic dialecti- cal oscillations between sacred and natural history, especially as they coa- lesce in the figure of allegory, which Hanssen reimagines as not only a "radically new antisystematic figure" for the disruptive force of history, but an excess of signification that destabilizes "the figures of self and interiority, symptomatic of the philosophy of consciousness" (1998, 4). Consequently, the latter half of Walter Benjamins Other History turns to the great literary essays of the 1930s - on Kraus, Kafka, Leskov, and others - and the gathering recognition of an extra- or infrahuman "nature," signaled by the prevalence of stones, animals, and angels in Benjamins metaphorics. This, the realm of the creaturely, is at once the domain of "the passions, mythical guilt, wanton melancholia, and animality," and yet, beginning as early as Benjamin s 1916 language essay, a "more pronounced and expressive [vehicle] of an ethical call for an all-inclusive turn toward nature" (104). Consistent with con- temporary theoretical explorations of animality that challenge the legacy of Western humanism (for instance, Agamben's recent The Open : Man and Animal with its own millennial preoccupations), Benjamin's ethico- political project seeks to awaken a responsibility to human creatureliness, a shrugging-off of anthropomorphic subjectivity in favor of a redemptive, if fleeting Judaic singularity. Hanssen illustrates how the "model of progres- sive human creation" must be "replaced by that of violent destruction": "Only in this way, [Benjamin] suggested, could the grounds for the coming of a new humankind be laid - a humanity that, paradoxically, would realize itself through destruction" (118). At the center of this new humanity is the figure of the Unmensch, the inhuman, born of a politics of destruction artic- ulated in two 1931 essays, "Karl Kraus" and "The Destructive Character." If, to quote Benjamin, the destructive character "has the consciousness of his- torical man, whose deepest emotion is an insuperable distrust of the course of things" (Benjamin 1999, 542) and whose promise is seeing potential in every obstacle ("What exists he reduces to rubble - not for the sake of the rubble, but for that of the way leading through it" [542]), the Unmensch is the ruined human left behind, stripped by violence of his metaphysical privi- lege, and yet redeemable in the name of a broader, nonexclusive humanism.</page><page sequence="17">Nieland and Juengel # 205 Hanssen is quick to note Benjamin's penchant for "embracing] dan- gerously conservative figures of thought" while promoting a coming poli- tics, and she offers a corrective in the form of Deutsche Menschen ("German People"), a curious and little-noted compendium of letters and commen- tary that Benjamin collected and published during his exile from National Socialism. Written mostly by prominent German intellectuals between 1783 and 1883, the montage of letters - including correspondence to and from Lichtenberg, Kant, Georg Forster, Goethe, Hölderlin, Jean Paul, and others - is designed to awaken an exemplary but nearly lost German humanism tremulous beneath "the work of forces that noisily and brutally denied it public effectiveness" (quoted in Hanssen 1998, 108). Thus, against the Nazi refashioning of the national Bildung , Benjamin hoped to archive "another, silent, silenced, and secret Germany," easy in its heterogeneity, democratic in spirit, and possible only in the private everyday deliberations of singular individuals (110). In the inscriptions he wrote in gift copies of Deutsche Menschen, Benjamin referred to the volume as "this ark, built according to Jewish example," a gesture which points not only to the "ele- ments of difference and alterity" within Benjamin's German-Jewish iden- tity, but to the promise of a replenished humanism after National Socialism, founded in the unresolved potential of an unremarked past. Significantly, after the Holocaust, Adorno viewed Deutsche Menschen as Benjamin's Utopian attempt to naively recover an otherwise unassimilable German collectivity under "the erroneous belief that spirit and cunning could achieve something against a power that no longer acknowledged the spirit as something independent but only as a means to its ends" (quoted in Hanssen 1998, 111). The mundane practicality of many of the letters, their everydayness, signaled "the last vestiges of a Kantian ethics" pitted against the totalizing instrumentality of hypernationalism; but, as Hanssen demonstrates, Adorno is himself susceptible to a similar romantic yearn- ing, justifying his eventual German return to his fondness for the "German idiom," which exhibits "an 'elective affinity' to philosophy, as well as a metaphysical speculative surplus ( Überschuß ) of meaning" (113). The seem- ingly gravitational pull of a natural/national language on these figures high- lights the nonsubjective, "linguistic nature of truth" beneath Benjamin's</page><page sequence="18">206 # Benjamin's Urgency "nature": for, as Benjamin asks in the famous translation essay, "is not the continued life of works of art far easier to recognize than the continual life of animal species?" (Benjamin 1968a, 71). The question acknowledges the deep murmuring language of things that preexists things themselves, a lan- guage in and from which Benjamin and Hanssen hear an ethical summons. Where Caygill rightly remains uncomfortable with this betrayal of complex historicity in the name of redemptive immanence, Hanssen's keen ear for the "transcendence" looming in Übersetzen (translation) means that "indi- vidual, singular translations were said to point proleptically to and antici- pate revelation" (Hanssen 1998, 34); as a result, "the history of the work and its translations was an objective, nonhuman, nonhumanistic history, for it was distinguished by relational concepts ( Relationsbegriffe ) and by relations, which, as Benjamin wrote, would guard their most central significance only 'when they are not in advance exclusively related to humans"' (36). Much like Edward Said's late call for a return to philology as a resource for a new humanism - to Spitzer and Auerbach, as well as to the tradition of ijtihad - Hanssen's often brilliant recovery of Benjamin's broad ethical project depends upon a renewed commitment to a nearly for- gotten creatural language, which, like the language of translation, "gives voice to the intentio of the original not as reproduction but as harmony" (Benjamin 1968a, 79). Fittingly, then, " [i]n this pure language - which no longer means or expresses anything but is, as expressionless and creative Word, that which is meant in all languages - all information, all sense, and all intention finally encounter a stratum in which they are destined to extinction" (Benjamin 1968a, 80). Released from the din of twentieth-century political life, the "stratum" of pure language represents an emancipation from communica- tion, the dying-off of sense, and the possibility of generative silence. In a 1999 special issue of Critical Inquiry in honor of the first volume of the Harvard Selected Writings, Shoshana Felman binds Benjamin's sense of blasted experience and the potentiality of language's dead-end under the sign of war and its relentless self-referentiality, within which silence func- tions as event. Felman's Benjamin is war-haunted, a historian whose entire theory of historical transmission is bound up in the silence that anticipates</page><page sequence="19">Nieland and Juengel # 207 and follows cultural trauma: where "The Storyteller" (1936) looks back to the incommunicability of experience and resulting erosion of community following World War I, the "Theses on the Philosophy of History" four years later diagnoses the "double silence" - both the speechlessness of the oppressed and "the silence of official history" with respect to it - at the heart of historiography before World War II (Felman 1999, 213). The exi- gency of the latter moment aligns this silence with ideological "collabora- tion," and insists that the rational continuity of historical narrative be arrested, the voice of the dead and the vanquished heard in what Benjamin calls "a Messianic cessation of happening" (Benjamin 1968b, 263). How- ever, Felman s account is more intimate, as she traces the source of this pro- found speechlessness to the August 1914 double suicide of Benjamin's best friend Fritz Heinle and his girlfriend, and their fateful last letter to Benjamin instructing him where to find the bodies. Read as a symbolic ges- ture of protest against the war, this event, its letter, and its afterlife linger as the material figure of articulated, even revolutionary silence. Or, as Benjamin remarks in the 1916 "On Language as Such," "In all mourning there is the deepest inclination to speechlessness, which is infinitely more than the inability or disinclination to communicate" (Benjamin 1996b, 73). The shock of these two familiar yet lifeless bodies calling to be discovered consolidates and privatizes the mass trauma of the battlefield, and when Benjamin tries to come to terms with the meaning of Heinle s suicide in the autobiographical A Berlin Chronicle, he posits it as a form of living outside experience. Indeed, for Felman, suicide functions within Benjamin s oeu- vre as a "refusal to compromise with life [an] absolute commitment to a youth" that the subject "refuses to survive" (1999, 221). In and through Heinle's self-silencing, Benjamin found an arrested but still vibrant lan- guage: strangely, then, in suicide there is insurgent life. It is useful to conclude with Gerhard Richter 's Walter Benjamin and the Corpus of Autobiography , in part because Richter 's expansive treatment of Benjamin's frequent autobiographical wagers understands that the desic- cated subject left behind after the violent attenuation of experience is still perhaps the last best point of departure. As such, Richter 's book serves as a valuable case study in how we might proceed with Benjamin when the</page><page sequence="20">2o8 # Benjamin's Urgency political is both a horizon of possibility and legible only in the deepest soundings of the figurative. Benjamin's frequent ventures in memoir - including the Moscow Diary (1926-27), the Berlin Chronicle (1932.), and the Berlin Childhood around 1900 (1932-38) - are urgent and intimate enact- ments of his theoretical writings, registering always a profound skepticism toward the canonical privileges of the modern autobiographical subject while insisting that memory is "the very scene of thinking itself" (Richter 2000, 43). Resistant to the imbricated lies of chronology and narrative, memory must, in Benjamin s words, "assay its spade, epically and rhapsod- ically in the most rigorous sense," creating an archaeological mnemonics whereby each of his autobiographical texts is more topography than chron- icle, more ruin than record, with temporality looming not as the vital tra- jectory of bios, but as a "strange figure" of both ephemerality and eternity. Richter 's project is an excavation of this figure, especially as it is mate- rialized in Benjamin's corpus , a trope designed to capture at once the inscriptive surfaces of experience that Caygill privileges, the archive of Benjamin's autobiographical improvisations, and the body in language at the moment of remembering. Adorno was among the first to remark Benjamin's broad rejection of inwardness as "not merely the seat of torpor and dull complacency" but "the phantasm which distorts the potential image of the human being," and his characterization of the "empirical" Benjamin as "hardly the person but rather the scene of the movement of the subject matter that pushed through him toward language" provides Richter with a dynamic starting point for thinking the body in thought (quoted in Richter 2000, 58, 51). Sensitive then to "the simultaneity of a historically recognizable physical subjectivity (and, by extension, the revolutionary potential this recognition may engender), but also to the moment of uncon- tainable excess, or even destruction, that mars this prospect," Richter wants to conjure a body that privileges openness, discontinuity, and dis- persal, without forsaking the creaturely call of Hanssen's natural history (58). Richter 's reading of the Moscow Diary, for instance, turns in part on Benjamin's diagnosis of the "[w]eakening of the symbolic and commu- nicative power in the skeleton of the word," an atrophic figure meant to sig- nal the impending collapse of both the house of language and the subject's</page><page sequence="21">Nieland and Juengel # 209 internal consistency, portending the deep, abiding anonymity on which the ethical depends. The retreat from transparency into a post-mimetic "stra- tum" is a retreat into the theologically suffused environment where lan- guage has no human speaker (only God). In order to think this delimitation politically, Richter begins his study by way of Benjamins appeal to a conceptual apparatus "completely useless for the purposes of fascism," the details of which Benjamin famously fails to specify. This seemingly political foreclosure is for Richter an invitation to read "the politics of concepts that have never been written," and a responsi- bility to, in Benjamin s words, "the Now of recognizability [which] bears to the highest degree the stamp of that critical, dangerous moment that lies at the ground of all reading" (quoted in Richter 2000, 13). For Richter, reading Benjamin's autobiographical corpus emplots in miniature "the intricate interruptions of teleology - moments that give us 'polities' to think again and again - rather than the instances of its mimetic execution" (234), whereby the dispersion (rather than the consolidation) of the self aligns autobiography with Benjamin's "politics of language," with the "pure lan- guage that wrestles with its own inability to transmit a stable content and that recognizes its status as a vital supplement to any performance of signification" (30). Obviously, the rejection of naive functionality, trans- parency, and self-identity is intended to elude the instrumental appropria- tions of fascism, and it follows then that the counter to the myth of the closed communal subject in history is the unusable body, a provisional sub- ject faltering between solidity and diffusion, unity and difference. Richter s long opening chapter on Benjamin's corporeality traces the arc of the disag- gregated subject from the mutilated, suffering body of the baroque Trauerspiel to the self-alienation experienced by the twentieth-century's mass-mediated subjects (or, as Benjamin writes, "In a film, the human being cannot recognize his own walk or his own voice in the gramophone"), in order to suggest how Benjamin's body has always already been something else, caught in the instant of its transformation. Not surprisingly, Richter turns to de Man's theory of prosopopeia to suggest how autobiography is always concerned, in de Man's idiom, "with the giving and taking away of faces, with face and deface, figure, figuration, and disfiguration." Much like</page><page sequence="22">210 # Benjamin's Urgency the work of Carol Jacobs, whose three decades of Benjamin scholarship is the quintessence of writing with Benjamin,11 Richter 's deconstructive sym- pathies are less avowed than performed, as he repeatedly stages the violent diffusion of Benjamin's bodily figures in order make them irreducible to other modes of violence. That Benjamin s figurai politics have finally become a site for reimagin- ing and rematerializing the stakes of deconstruction measures the ethical turn in critical theory, in which the theosophical nature of "pure language" and "natural history" ironically becomes the motor of an unworking, after which, always, we can begin anew. Adorno famously said of Benjamin, "In all his phases, Benjamin thought the demise of the subject and the salvation of humanity as one thing," a formulation that would seem to underwrite the deconstructive spirit with which Benjamin is continually taken up by his contemporary readers: what Benjamin calls the destructive character, and the eventfulness of God s word, is deconstruction for theorists like Ziarek, Hanssen, and Richter. It is hard to know at times whether this is precisely the methodological point, whether contemporary theory has found in Benjamin's politics a measure of the "redemption" that Benjamin himself awaited: out of the rubble something potentiating, eventful, to come. NOTES 1. This penchant for sundry and often cavalier "Benjaminian readings" probably reaches its apotheosis with Lisa Patt's edited collection, Benjamins Blind Spot : Walter Benjamin and the Premature Death of Aura (2001), which includes essays putting Benjamin in conversation with the early Elvis, Wallace Stevens, the industrial music group Coil, Georges Bataille, and others. 2. For exemplary work on Benjamin's early engagement with Jena Romanticism and the attempts to resolve the Kantian problem of consciousness's representation of itself to itself, see the inaugural volume in the "Walter Benjamin Studies" series, Beatrice Hanssen and Andrew Benjamin's (eds.), Walter Benjamin and Romanticism (2002), edited by Beatrice Hanssen and Andrew Benjamin, especially Winfried Menninghaus 's "Walter Benjamin's Exposition of the Romantic Theory of Reflection," Rodolphe Gasche"s "The Sober Absolute: On Benjamin and the Early Romantics," and Josh Cohen's "Unfolding: Reading After Romanticism."</page><page sequence="23">Nieland and Juengel # 211 3. For a different account of Benjamin's uneasy affinities with Schmitt in the context of the Trauerspiel, see Horst Bredekamp, "From Walter Benjamin to Carl Schmitt via Thomas Hobbes" (1999)- Linking Benjamin and Schmitt primarily through the value they attribute to a form of political time "posited beyond the continuum of normal- ity," Bredekamp insists that Benjamin - in his critique of the baroque rulers' failure to govern the state of exception - views the absence of true decisionism, true sover- eignty, as "catastrophic," and thus remains firmly "within the Schmittian framework" (258, 261). 4. Here, we might observe that what Benjamin calls the "pure language" of God's word, which Caygill understands as the potential for infinitive configuration of experience, is quite like what Heidegger, according to Ziarek, calls language's function to unfold phenomenality itself through the double movement of figuring and unworking that it shares with the artwork: "because art works like and as a language - it unfolds the world by transposing it into discourse - artworks stage being in its historial character, rendering legible the historicity of the discursive constitution of experience" (Ziarek 2001, 36). What Heidegger calls the event-structure of language - the unfolding of all that is through the sayable - is God's word for Benjamin. 5. See Samuel Weber's "Theater, Technics, and Writing" (quoted in Ziarek 2001, 77). See also Weber's formulation that the artwork's politics lie in its ability to frustrate fascist organization, which it achieves through the different "taking place" of the "time of reproducibility," a non-self present, shocked, temporality (Weber 1996, 34). 6. For Ferris, as for Ziarek, the political force of the dialectical image's historicizing interruption finds "its aesthetic counterpart in a concept, technical reproducibility, that would mark the end of historical continuity represented by the aura of the work of art and, at the same time, resist political organization in the name of politics that arises in and out of the dialectical image" (Ferris 1996, 18). However, Ferris and Ziarek make these similar claims by articulating very different relationships between Benjamin and Heidegger: for Ferris, Benjamin's discontinuous phenomenology is posed against Heidegger's phenomenological essentialism, whereas for Ziarek, because Heidegger is already anti-essentialist, his formulation of the artwork's his- toricity is easier to see in dialogue with Benjamin. 7. Here, Koepnick quotes approvingly and at length Habermas 's skeptical critique of Benjamin as a thinker of revolution in his well-known 1972 essay "Consciousness - Raising or Rescuing Critique" (Koepnick 1999, 170). 8. Insofar as such reductions are bound- in these accounts- to the instantiation of ori- gin they are, of course, reminiscent of the mythical violence that Derrida, following Benjamin, locates at the founding of the law (Derrida 1990). For superb readings of Benjamin's "Critique of Violence," see Alexander García Düttman, "The Violence of Destruction," and Tom McCall, "Momentary Violence," both in Ferris's Walter Benjamin: Theoretical Questions (1996), as well as Beatrice Hanssen's reading of Benjamin's Utopian attempt to formulate a non-instrumental politics of pure means in Critique of Violence : Between Poststructuralism and Critical Theory (2000). 9.
