<plain_text><page sequence="1">Attilio Bertolucci, Selected Poems, Italian-English bilingual edition, translated by Charles Tomlinson (Bloodaxe Books, 1993). Elena Shvarts, 'Paradise', Selected Poems, Russian-English bilingual edition, trans- lated by Michael Molnar with additional translations by Catriona Kelly (Bloodaxe Books, 1993). I approached the poetry of Attilio Bertolucci with anticipation. For a number of reasons. First of all, I was intrigued because I had never heard of him. Odd, but perhaps not all that difficult to understand as this is his first edition in English and I read no Italian. I was even more intrigued when the book jacket went on to say he was 'Italy's greatest living poet'. If he was this good, where had he been? The intro- duction by the translator was no less liberal in its praise. While setting down the seemingly innocuous events of Bertolucci's life, it linked them to the names of Push- kin, Chekhov and Proust, among others, suggesting that Bertolucci moves in some pretty ratified company. Did I really think the poetry could live up to this kind of advanced billing? Yes, I did. Which means disappointment was almost inevitable. The selections are chronological and the opening ones are the weakest. True, Bertolucci did develop early as a poet, as the introduction states. His first book (Sirius, 1929) appeared at the age of eighteen, which means that at least some of the poems were written even earlier. The poems show a technical command rare at that age which comes through clearly in the meticulous translations. But a command of what? While not blemished by the excesses of youth (which can also be virtues, one should not forget), these early poems (including those in Fires in November, 1934) often border on the banal and rarely rise above the commonplace. We read: 'It is like a wolf, the wind'; 'A pallid sun that burns/ as if it had a fever'; 'I am alone/ the river is full and singing'; 'Your solitary song awakened me/ sad friend of October, innocent owl'; 'The wine was golden in the glass/ sparkling, inebriating us:/ love within your dark eyes played/ as running fire ignites a glade'. These quotes are entirely representative of the first two collections (and could be easily multiplied) which cover the years of Bertolucci's youth, the next collection appearing when he was forty. All these rather vague cogitations on the infinite must indeed have left him 'tired out, content/ as a cloud or a rain-drenched tree'. Not to be unkind, all this is pleasant enough, but these are not poems one would associate with a great poet. Impersonal as exercises, they slip their generic way into each other, gliding by anthropomorphic nature. His third collection, Letter from Home, appeared in 1951 after a silence of seven- teen years. There is a graver, more personal note here as befits letters, the most</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 393 personal form of writing after a diary, and home, the most personal of places. And they are addressed, by and large, to family. There is much lyric beauty, yet sentiment- ality and clichd are never far away; it is a beauty that seems to cover emptiness, an inability to connect with the source in himself, in his world, where he 'only hears/ the swish of billhook in the risen wind/ tranquilly mingling life and death'. His admittedly middle-class upbringing will let him be no more specific than this. Of course, this is one of the main reasons the bourgeoisie is not a more fertile field for poetry. Technic- ally, it has as much to offer as any other milieu, but to protect its privileges it must spurn the personal and promote its substitute, the cliche. At that point I was ready to dismiss Bertolucci, but fortunately I read on, because unexpectedly things began to happen to him as a poet. There is already some evidence of this in Indian Wifwam (1955) where the generalities are now part of a clearly personal, rural world, his usual world in a sense, but now definitively his. The structure of the poems moves off in a new direction, more colloquial, more idiosyncratic, more complex, and, as the translator admits, there are problems rendering them in English, though the translations are admirable despite this. But the poems are still governed by a rather listless repose and serenity, ripening shadows that never ripened for anyone, nature trimmed to fit in with an autumn meal prepared by servants and eaten before vistas of leisure and comfortable melancholy. And then something really happens. Something breaks free. Not all at once of course, but the book makes it seem that way. Winter Journey (1971) appeared when the poet had turned sixty. At last Bertolucci seems to have shed his upbringing and he emerges as a poet with a distinct and surprisingly powerful point of view. While losing nothing of their lyrical beauty the poems gain a rich, new voice. All the poems in this section are excellent, but 'Toward Casarola' seems to me the best of them, for several reasons. Though the events described occurred nearly thirty years before this poem appeared, they may mark the moment when the poet truly began to find himself. It is 1943. Italy has capitulated and Bertolucci and his family are headed for the mountains, for Casarola, for home. It is a bad time, a bad time for everyone, as the poem stresses, but simultaneously the real joy of anticipation, the joy of beginning again, is also stressed, this time, though, in his own way and his own place. 'Let me set out along the uphill way / and, at the first quickening heartbeat, turn,/ uplifted and oppressed by my fatigue and joy.' This 'oppressed' signals the new Bertolucci. He is walking into a memory transformed, marvelling 'with the unquiet hope of migrant and fugitive' and, though the bells that are resounding along the mountain course herald their coming, the poet is well aware that he and his family will be placing an added burden on the people here who 'for our insolvency must always pay', implying, in this context, that it has always been the case. The second section of the poem dwells on the momentous, symbolic aspect of the journey. The vacancy of 'year on year' roars in his 'diminished ear' but at last he has chosen a way 'for the salvation of both spirit and of flesh' feeling that nothing could be better than being 'clasped together as man and wife in close embrace'. Confusion falls away as he enters ever more deeply into a land absorbed in its own unhurried thought and,</page><page sequence="3">394 Critical Survey, volume 6, number 3 though he is in many ways a stranger now, he is a stranger who knows that when 'swifts/ erupt into a sky that skylarks filled. Then/ will be the time to hoist their son onto their shoulders/ so that emerging from the covert he can eye with awe/ the mingling of smoke and stars above Casarola gained'. A long climb, but the poet has gained himself and at last proven worthy of his praise. In closing, I would like to add that Bertolucci is one of the finest poets of old age I have read (as good as Hardy, which is very good indeed). His cold, yet compassion- ate eye notes the mortal marks time lays down, his inexorable advance into nothing- ness as sensations fade and life's texture grows harder to grasp. He hates it but indicates, with a touch of irony, that you can at the end partially exorcise your fate when 'you close your eyes/ lost in a lassitude without end,/ a convalescent who enjoys his state,/ like a transgression or a privilege'. The poetry of Elena Shvarts is about as far removed from the world of Attilio Bertolucci as it is possible to get. She is speaking of a 'city laid out like a carcass/ In the grip of savage anguish'. This city is, of course, St Petersberg- Petrograd- Leningrad- but it is also the great, dark, turbulent 'soul' of Russia we are all so familiar with from Russian literature. Shvarts takes us once more through the myth and mysticism, innocence and guile, despair and derision, brooding and blarney with which the Russians treat Russia. It is a testimony to her power and skill as a poet that the journey is invigorating rather than depressing. 'Black Easter' could be considered a core poem of this selection, for the poet states 'suddenly I understood/ long ago Russia flooded Petersberg'. The swampland turned into citadel, a stone paradise of supposed Western enlightenment has reverted, or, better, become re-submerged by a Russia where 'bushes blacken in agony' and 'women are thrashed on Sundays' before saints with 'radiantly empty eyes'. Shvarts obviously loathes all this, but at the same time she realises it is still Paradise, horribly so perhaps; Paradise by definition, albeit Russian definition. In passing, it is rather amazing that Russian poets can still speak seriously of Paradise, inverted commas or not. So little changes in Russian despite the veneer of Western political and economic culture periodically applied to almost timeless cataclysm. Shvarts then asks 'Oh Moses when you at last came to the Promised Land / Did you ever feel you were something she'd dreamt?' In the context of this selection it is a question the poet could be asking herself as well and, in a number of guises, this question does appear again and again- there are examples of it to be found in every poem in the book. Paradise- The Promised Land- Contagious Bog, all in one- could she help but feel dreamt up? And in these poems dream and thought are closely intertwined, racing on relentlessly, but seldom breathlessly, feeding on themselves, creating new energies in an ongoing, never slackening cycle. Her images are startling, obsessive. It is the word itself (and the Word) she draws our attention to, all that we can really know of heaven and/or hell because it is the only thing we know we share with the Christian God. Shvarts sets up no impediments to the flow of uncon- scious energy, but the imagery that makes up the poems is gloriously conscious. She</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 395 fears nothing, at times seems to desire nothing while speaking incessantly of fear and desire. Making herself even clearer, Shvarts says, 'The Poet is an eye- later you'll find this out-/ linked for an instant to a howling God./ A gouged eye on a bloody thread, for a moment filled/ with all the pain and glory of the world'. Not only does this indicate her existential position, it also illustrates one of the problems she encounters as a poet: language inflated until it loses its elasticity. Not that there is anything contrived about her violent imagination- there is no manipulation here, but put simply she is hurling herself at an impossible task: trying to make Petersburg stand for Russia entire. At times one feels she has an almost claustrophobic concern for exaltation and degradation and this is bound to lead to infelicities such as 'pain and glory'. Fortunately, she is so genuine and powerful she never descends to bathos or self-parody. As much as I admire this poetry, it strikes me that it might seem like demonic rambling in another context. Yet here it doesn't. It isn't exactly 'natural', but it is not all that strange either. Maybe we have grown inured to the Russian soul being 'out of control'. In many ways, of course, this is akin to borderline psychosis, a view of the cosmos that refers to nothing but itself, in a country so vast its inhabitants can easily feel it is a symbol of the universe and in time lose all sense of personal or national boundary, lose sight of the fact that they are talking of a symbol. A country so vast, so exposed to enemies on all sides, cannot really be defended actively except by belief, by language. And so much of Russian literature, poetry and prose, is an elaborate defence of Mother Russia but so labyrinthian and baffling (if brilliant) that the 'apologetic' element is sometimes missed. Dostoevsky and Mayakovsky immediately come to mind in this context, but the same belief is also present in Pushkin, Turgenev, Tol- stoy, of course, Akhmatova and even Chekhov, though there the rhetorical heat is capped. But even there it is the driving force that keeps the lights burning. Shvarts fits snugly into this group. As an illustration of the non-changing aspect of Russian literature (and reality) found in Shvarts, we only have to consider that all the poems in this selection appeared before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Day after day we read in the newspapers of the complete social and economic anarchy in Russia, chaos, and cri- minality overwhelming civilised behaviour, a radical polarisation sweeping away the stability of repression in a polluted, degraded environment where cities of the 'living dead' like Magnitogorsk and Asbestos are time-bombs whose time has arrived. Is this really any different from what we read in Shvarts? Collapse is the legacy of each generation of Russians. But now the moral authority of the poet is no longer a factor and who knows what this may mean for both poets and Russians. Speculation aside, these poems will remain. Though excessive at times (see 'Elegy for an X-ray Photo of my Skull' for example), we have been taught by Blake that excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom. At the risk of being facetious, it can of course also lead to the Halls of the Ridiculous. But as I have said, Shvarts manages to avoid most of the pitfalls of super-heated language and, to be fair, I have perhaps overstated</page><page sequence="5">396 Critical Survey, volume 6, number 3 this aspect of her poetry. 'Sale of a Historian's Library', for example, one of the most successful and complex poems in this selection, is subtle and restrained: 'The centre of the world is forever/ the glint on my finger, in Socrates' eye,/ in a tram, on the moon, in clouds grey-knotted,/ in the ruptured maw of a slaughtered private.' The same could be said of 'Cynthia' and 'A Parrot at Sea' to name only two. This measured tone, at least in Russian terms, seems to be growing with age if I can judge by the dates of publication given at the back of the book. Since I have no knowledge of Russian I cannot judge the translations of Molnar and Kelly except to say they seem excellent. As a translator myself I can appreciate the problems they must have encountered trying to find equivalents for the Russian without giving way to bombast and sentimentality. They have accomplished this very considerable feat, producing quality English poems that would never (and could never) have been written in English. In the end it is tempting to identify Shvarts with the nun Lavinia she writes of: 'Alive I have become a tomb/ and I will fly to God alone.' In her more despondent moods she may feel that way, but I hope she has more to give us, works of even greater, even broader vision. In any case, tombs cannot fly, not even to God. Bloodaxe Books must be commended for its ongoing commitment to publishing bilingual editions of poetry. The books are excellent in all respects. May the series continue and may it prosper.
