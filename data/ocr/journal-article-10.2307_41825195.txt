This is an ambitious book which aims to recover an aspect of Degas's practice previously much neglected. In effect, Richard Kendall seeks to show that landscape was an important part of Degas's production, and that the artist took it every bit as seriously as figure painting. It is within the terms of this revision that the author focusses the reader's attention on the landscape prints. Effectively therefore, his claims about Degas's practice as a landscape printmaker are strongly inflected by his wider view of Degas the landscapist, and they stand or fall by the success or failure of the argu- ments on this score. The difficulty here is that while this book contains much that is valuable, it sometimes presents a picture of Degas's landscape practice that is speculative or even self-contradic- tory - despite its declared intention to eschew 'the theoreti- cal gymnastics' of recent art history and to concentrate instead on 'the artist's procedures'. Thus, on the one hand, the author presents reliable evidence that Degas did make extensive painted and written observations of motifs he saw outdoors, that he thought of himself as a 'Realist' and that he was interested in the plein air aesthetic of his contempo- raries. But on the other, Kendall shows how Degas was opposed to the more slavish aspects of j bleinairisme, in that he preferred his 'memories' to the 'boredom' of 'contemplating nature', and that he chided Henri Rouart for making a 'sport' out of landscape painting by painting a landscape on the edge of a cliff. The result of this is that a lot of the time it is difficult to see just what Kendall is saying. And Kendall's stock solution to the complex and contradictory character of Degas's practice - that his attitude to the landscape was 'paradoxical' - is little help either, as this best translates as a tacit admission that Kendall has not really worked it out. This conclusion is borne out in some of the analyses of individual works, particularly where Kendall seems bent on stretching the evidence in order to make a picture a record of something seen, even though this is an insecure or con- tentious move. For instance, Kendall characterizes the series of pastels Degas made at Dives-sur-Mer in 1869 as 'essen- tially matter-of-fact', and of a kind that Zola would have appreciated for their 'correctness of observation' - a quality he approved of in Boudin. Admittedly, Degas did make close verbal notes of what he saw, but it is hard to believe the pas- tels are reducible to observations in the same spirit: they sim- ply look too nebulous for this to be the case. To complicate the issue further, Kendall intersperses his analysis of these works with a discussion of how Baudelaire valued Boudin's work for its 'poetic impression', and he also hints at how the historical record suggests Degas made these works from memory. Memory was a central faculty in the creative process according to Baudelaire, and even though Kendall acknowledges Degas was reading the poet's criticism pre- cisely at this time, he none the less ignores the obvious rele- vance of Baudelaire's aesthetic to the artist's practice. Paradoxically enough, given his wilful insensitivity to the synthetic and poetic aspects of these works, Kendall does acknowledge Degas's studied procedures elsewhere, and also shows considerable sensitivity to his interest in the suggestive and expressive properties of the media. For instance, he does mention the artist's interest in studio work, and even remarks on the 'god-like powers of the landscapist' who arbitrarily disposes the contents of his works. In several places Kendall also acknowledges that Degas's works often look more like the pictures they transform (particularly Japanese prints) than they resemble nature. He seems to want to acknowledge by this (even if only tacitly) that artists learn how to make pictures by following the schemata other pictures supply. However, Kendall also mentions how artists like Degas sometimes saw nature in terms of art, as when the painter remarked on how he saw a 'sunset like in pictures'. It follows, therefore, that if works of art determine how an artist sees nature, arguments about Degas's verisimilitude need some account of what it is that the artist is truthful to when he (supposedly) is. This we do not get. Kendall's account of how Degas exploited the expressive potential of his media is more convincing, even if it under- mines the argument about the painter's commitment to I bleinairisme. Unfortunately, the discussion of Degas's tech- niques is not so much analytical as implicit in the many lengthy descriptions of the surfaces of his works that Kendall offers. In moderation, description can be helpful - particu- larly in a book like this, which is designed to accompany the Degas landscapes exhibition that toured New York and Houston. Here, though, the author tends sometimes to overstate the obvious, on occasions to represent his own responses to pictures as facts, and frequently to express him- self in a style that is florid. Notwithstanding, Kendall does give useful intimations of the discourses out of which Degas's theory of the expressive character of the landscape picture may have grown. The discussion of Baudelaire's views on Delacroix's ability to synthesize 'the wonderful aspect of things' is helpful, as is a reference to Champfleury's remarks on the impossibility of describing a landscape, which 'is an emotion'. Ideas like these plainly inform Degas's own think- ing as he remarked: 'A picture is an original combination of lines and colours that make themselves felt . . .'. Unfortunately, Kendall offers little analysis of how a remark like this links Degas's beliefs about landscape painting with Baudelaire et al ., or with the theory of the sensation cherished PRINT QUARTERLY, XII, 1995, I</page><page sequence="2">go EXHIBITION AND BOOK REVIEWS by his Impressionist colleagues. Admittedly, an account like this, in the terms of nineteenth-century thought, could only provide an account of what artists like Degas told themselves they were doing, but it might none the less lay the ground for a more complete explanation of how their work actually was expressive. As I implied earlier, Kendall's treatment of the monotypes is closely similar to his more general account in its structure. On the one hand, the author is determined to invest these works with a close relation to things seen, however difficult this position may be to sustain. For instance, he argues that a large number of the 50 or so monotypes that Degas made in the years around 1890-92 in Di√©nay and Paris were records of his 'fleeting experience' of the journeys by coach and rail he undertook during the period. Relying on accounts by contemporaries, Kendall suggests these works issued from an 'astonishing memory', which meant they could represent landscapes 'as if they were still in front of his eyes'. He also suggests they were connected with 'sensations of speed and dislocation'. In a like manner, Kendall stretches the evidence of their production to make the case that some of the monotypes issued from a kind of pleinairiste aesthetic. For example, he likens Degas's practice of taking one or more cognate impressions from the same plate to Hiroshige's habit of taking impressions from differently inked blocks in order to suggest different atmospherics. On the other hand, we are told later that because Degas 'looked around only vaguely' while travelling, the monotypes were to some extent arbitrary and synthetic. Typically, Kendall's solution to this conundrum is to suggest the monotypes were paradoxical, forms being 'blurred or partly erased' and yet also at the same time expressing a sense of 'engagement with real sites' (cf. the monochrome monotypes of the late 1870s, which, he suggests, were both Impressionist in spirit and not). If that were not enough on its own to call Kendall's arguments into question, he shoots himself in the foot by pil- ing up the evidence that Degas's eyesight was far too impaired for him to be able to register the landscape in any- thing like an accurate fashion. Degas, we are told, referred to himself as a 'blind man' and to his landscapes as 'states of eyes'. Kendall's discussion of the improvisatory character of the monotypes is valuable, even if it eventually forces him to accept that Degas made these works not for their topo- graphical accuracy, but for their expressive effects. He points out the artist's love of the 'difficulty' of the medium, and how its accidental and unpredictable character (like that of the Japanese woodblock print) made him think of it as a kind of 'juggling'. More specifically, Kendall offers a cogent expla- nation of why Degas used the monotype medium, for all that it may initially appear redundant when compared to normal printmaking practice (which can at least produce multiple impressions from the same plate or stone). Effectively, Kendall argues that the interest of monotype for Degas was twofold. In the first place, the look of the monotype proper (the first print taken from the plate) could not be exactly con- trolled because the paint (or ink) would spread or smudge or take on the paper in an unpredictable fashion, leaving the artist with an image that could be nebulous in the extreme and strikingly suggestive as a consequence - A Wooded Landscape (his fig. 147) and Squall in Mountains (his fig. 153) are particularly salient examples of this sort of serendipity. Second, the cognates (or secondary impressions) drawn from the painted plate would differ gready in hue, tone and tex- ture from the monotype proper, according to a variety of factors, such as the viscosity of the paint on the plate, or the weight and wetness of the paper used to take the impression, or the amount of time that elapsed between impressions. What is more, while the monotypes proper only sometimes suggest their elaboration in pastel, the generally fainter cognates almost demanded this kind of working up. Accordingly, the different kinds of print could lend them- selves to different degrees and kinds of elaboration, and so Degas would sometimes produce subde variants of the same scene, but sometimes spectacularly different images. Kendall produces some fascinating surprises about rela- tionships between some of the pastels over monotype. For instance, he shows how Wheaifield and Green Hill (his fig. 174) and The Field of Flax (his fig. 175), although very different in appearance, are in fact elaborated versions of prints from the same plate. He also recovers the connection between a pair only tenuously connected previously, in showing how Degas inverted and elaborated a cognate of the monotype beneath Autumn Landscape (his fig. 151) and made it into River Banks (his fig. 152). Most spectacular of all is Kendall's dis- covery that Landscape with Cows (his fig. 176) is not in fact a pastel plain and simple, but an elaborated version of the monotype Landscape by the Sea (his fig. 177). Apart from refining our knowledge of the status of the pastels over monotype (and even proposing a system of clas- sifying them according to plate size), Kendall raises some very interesting issues about their genesis and expressive character. His argument is that in some of these works, Olive Trees against a Mountainous Background (his fig. 190) for example, Degas worked synthetically: raiding his memory and arbi- trarily disposing what he found there in the work. Kendall does accumulate considerable verbal evidence to underpin his claim. He quotes Georges Jeanniot, who witnessed Degas at work while staying with him at Di√©nay: 'I can still see him . . . printing on my press the monotypes that were inspired by memories of the landscape'. He cites Degas on how his 'memory' of Burgundy endured. He quotes Daniel Hal√©vy's recollection that Degas worked in Paris 'success- fully fixing his memories' of the landscape, and Boldini's description of how Degas had 'a memory strong like iron'. Kendall also points out that Ingres had told the young Degas: 'Never work from nature. Always from memory'; and he recounts how Degas was interested in the mnemonic procedures advocated by Lecoq de Boisbaudran. The problem with this account, however, is that it does not accord sufficient importance to the way that works of this sort determined their own progress. To put it another way: if elements in these prints do relate to memories of things seen, this relationship is often tenuous, as it is clear enough from the way that Degas elaborated his monotypes that it was what the work suggested - or allowed him to see</page><page sequence="3">EXHIBITION AND BOOK REVIEWS ' 91 in it - that led him to work it up the way he did. Moreover, as Kendall points out, the landscape takes on unmistakably bodily characteristics in many of these works: to varying degrees, Le Cap Hornu (his fig. 155), Lake and Mountains (his fig. 168), two versions of Rocky Coast (his figs. 185 and 187), Mountains and Valley (his fig. 194), Landscape (his fig. 197), An Island in the Sea (his fig. 201) all have features that look like those of the human body or face. So does Olive Trees against a Mountainous Background , in which the mountain in the left background looks like the head and back of a woman. In the pastel Steep Coast (his fig. 199) the body of the woman in the Metropolitan Museum Woman Having her Hair Combed reap- pears rotated through ninety degrees and recumbent; and the male genitalia are inescapably suggested by features of another pastel: Landscape (his fig. 200). (Although similar in this respect to the elaborated monotypes, Kendall is at pains to point out that these works have no printed base). For Kendall, suggestions of human form in these works are no more than a kind of 'anthropomorphic' punning. But this misses the point. As Baudelaire so beautifully expressed it in the theory of correspondances , landscapes appear to have moods and feelings that are not merely those a spectator brings to them. Even recent aesthetics has little to say on why this is. It may be that this is something that cannot be analysed in terms of the features landscapes exhibit; in which case our tendency to see them in anthropomorphic terms, or to see quasi-human features in them, just follows from the brute fact that they seem to have moods. But it may be the case that we see landscapes as having moods precisely because we see formal or performative features in them that lend themselves to metaphorical association with features of the body. This much would at least explain why a particular landscape seems possessed of a particular mood. If this were the case, then what Degas was doing in giving salience to the landscape's quasi-human properties was making its expres- sive character more clear or marked. By this account, works like those last mentioned are not merely visual jokes, they are metaphors in which the landscape borrows qualities from the human body and becomes expressive by virtue of doing this. Baudelaire is not explicit about how it is that the land- scape has moods, but he says enough in places to suggest it sometimes borrows properties we normally associate with human bodies or feelings. And at least one of Degas's remarks that Kendall quotes shows he thought of making landscape in strictly Baudelairean terms - his advice to Jeanniot: 'It is very good to copy what one sees; it is much better to draw what you can't see any more but in your memory. It is a transformation in which imagination and memory work together. You only reproduce what stuck to you, that is to say the necessary. That way, your memories and fantasy are freed from the tyranny of nature'. Here, Degas effectively expresses a belief central to Baudelaire's theory of correspondances , but stripped of its metaphysics. Brutally summarized, Baudelaire suggested that correspon- dance occurred only when the memory and the imagination allowed the soul to penetrate appearances and divine the mysterious, divinely ordained relations between the world and itself. What Degas seems to say is that the memory and imagination give shape and meaning to things or distil some otherwise hidden something from them. And to the extent that his landscapes take on metaphorically human proper- ties, it seems that what his memory and imagination distilled via the suggestive medium of monotype was something very like correspondance.</page></plain_text>
