<plain_text><page sequence="1">What The Dynasts Meant to Hardy HAROLD OREL DYNASTS took more time to prepare for, and to write, than any other work in Hardy's career. It was undoubtedly his most ambitious undertaking. Its thirty separate rhyme schemes illustrate his command of prosody on a very generous scale. It contains the most explicit statement of his philosophical views about man's relationship to the universe. At the time of its appearance, in the first decade of this century, it was immediately recognized as the greatest imaginative treatment by an English author of the Napoleonic Wars, and no poem, play, or novel has since superseded it. During two World Wars, both conducted as if the dividing-line between civilian and military targets had been obliterated by high explosives, Hardy's characterizations of Pitt, Nelson, Wellington, and ordinary Englishmen served as inspiration for tens of thousands of readers. Hardy felt some chagrin at the puzzled reviews that greeted the publication of Part First as a separate volume ( 1 903), and he regretted that he had not waited until the work was complete. (Part Second was completed in 1905 and published the following year; Part Third, completed in 1907, appeared in print in 1908.) Like any author, he treasured the praise of those who liked it. Max Beerbohm, Ford Madox Ford, Siegfried Sassoon, Walter de la Mare, and A. M. Broadley, among others, told him of their admiration. Years later Hardy confided to Ellen Glasgow that he considered it "his greatest work (he may have said 'best')."1 The Dynasts, more than any other single work, earned Hardy his Order of Merit. At the time of the conferral of the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters at Oxford (1920), a special (and flattering) mention of The Dynasts was part of the ceremony. And St. John Ervine, sending him in 1921 an address that had been signed by 106 younger writers, concluded: "From your first book to your last you have written in the 'high style, as 'Ellen Glasgow, The Woman Within (New York, 1954), p. 197. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 / VICTORIAN POETRY when that men to kinges write,' and you have crowned a great prose with a noble poetry. We thank you, Sir, for all that you have written . . . but most of all, perhaps, for The Dynasts" {Life, p. 413). A masterwork, and perhaps the greatest long poem in English published during this century (the claim has been made more than once). Yet, oddly enough, many lovers of Hardy have not read it, and many books about Hardy dismiss it in a footnote or desultory paragraph. Some critics are still bemused by "its experimental mixture of epic and drama, prose and poetry, narrative, theatrical, and even cinematic technique";2 by the attraction that it exerts on "writers interested only in philosophy";3 and by the somewhat patronizing judgment, "As a whole it is flawed. . . . The ambition and the form were not quite manageable."4 These views, current more than a half-century after publication of The Dynasts, should warn us that Hardy's epic-drama does not clearly resemble his earlier and more readily understandable productions. Hardy's determination to write a new kind of fiction grew from a number of reasons, not all clearly sorted out in the memoirs that he dictated to Florence Emily Hardy many years later. Moreover, the doctrine of the Immanent Will has never been congenial to all readers, and Hardy, in The Dynasts, made his concept of Its nature inescapable, something not to be rushed over. And it is understandable that he did not, perhaps could not, achieve complete success in handling a full decade of European history in three parts, nineteen acts, and 131 scenes.5 Still, the degree of success that Hardy achieved is astonishing, and will be best appreciated if we take a closer look at what he thought he was up to. That, in turn, requires our looking at some biographical considerations. Hardy's renunciation of the novel after the publication of Jude the Obscure (1895) is usually attributed to the hostility of the reviews. Jeannette Gilder's two notorious attacks in the New York World { Hardy's mind "seems to run to pigs - animal and human"; when she finished the story, she opened the windows "and let in the fresh air"; Hardy's realism was "disgusting") appeared almost simultaneously with a review entitled "Jude the Obscene" in the Pall Mall Gazette, a denunciation of Hardy's "morbid animality" in the New York Critic, a sneer at the "prevailing gloom" of the novel in the Daily Telegraph, and a slating in the Manchester 2 Paul Zietlow, Moments of Vision: The Poetry of Thomas Hardy (Harvard Univ.

Press, 1954), p. 134.</page><page sequence="3">HAROLD OREL /111 Guardian, which accused Hardy of having insulted "marriage, religion, and all the obligations and relations of life which most people hold sacred." Other angry notices, all assuming that realism had its limits and that Hardy had overstepped them, sternly notified Hardy that still another effort to depict the "night-cart" side of nature would not be tolerated.6 Hardy's reaction - "A man must be a fool to deliberately stand up to be shot at" - followed immediately (Life, p. 246). He did not relish being described, by Mrs. Oliphant, as a member of "The Anti-Marriage League," one who seemed to suggest that hanging a child was the best way to remove the principal obstruction to the abolition of marriage. He had always been sensitive to unfriendly reviews (and had ample reason to be); but not even the reception of Tess had prepared him for what seemed to be an orchestrated outcry. In addition, he knew well the hostility of his wife to the dangerous direction that his career as a novelist was following.7 More novels along the lines of Jude might well destroy his marriage for all the world to see. Yet these facts do not justify the speculation that Hardy, in 1895, thought he had accomplished all he wanted to in the world of prose fiction, and that Jude had been sent to the press as a self-conscious final statement. Even riskier is the claim that Hardy had no more stories to tell that warranted novelistic treatment; that his blaming the reviewers proved a convenient method of ending a long dry spell of failed creativity. The point is important for two reasons: one, Hardy never admitted, either in the mid- 1890's or later, that such a spell existed, and such speculation cannot be confirmed by anything that Hardy himself wrote down or said; and two, Hardy had always regarded the novel as a form of literature inferior to poetry, and the decision to renounce novel-writing was an inevitable event once Hardy had assured himself of financial independence.

Robert Gittings has expressed skepticism that Emma acted in so extreme a fashion, and he has finally convinced me.</page><page sequence="4">112/ VICTORIAN POETRY Hardy's resolve to turn away from novels meant that he could now devote time to a vast, still awkwardly-defined project about the Napoleonic Wars that he had been considering, on and off, for more than two decades before he started on Jude. After all, he had been born in 1840, and had grown up among adults who remembered and reminisced about alarums when it seemed that Boney's troops might invade Dorset; about the Peninsular Campaign, and foot-slogging across the Continent. He had read with fascination several numbers of A History of the Wars, a periodical that he discovered in a closet at home. His grandfather, a volunteer, had subscribed to it, and, as Hardy wrote in the Life, "The torn pages of these contemporary numbers with their melodramatic prints of serried ranks, crossed bayonets, huge knapsacks, and dead bodies, were the first to set him on the train of ideas that led to The Trumpet- Major and The Dynasts'" (pp. 16-17). He read, and often quoted, Carlyle's The History of the French Revolution. From the age of fifteen, when he first began to study the French language, his studies led him to Thiers, and to Hugo's view that the Bourbons were dynasts no less subject than Napoleon to the workings of destiny. By 1868 Hardy was toying with the notion of a narrative poem on the Battle of the Nile; he completed an outline of the poem (now lost). What would Hardy have made of Napoleon's first direct confrontation with Nelson? Within two years he paid the first of several visits to Chelsea Hospital, conducting interviews that tested the vividness of veterans' memories of Waterloo. The reading in primary and secondary sources that he conducted during 1878 and 1879 for The Trumpet- Major included C. H. Gifford's two-volume History of the Wars Occasioned by the French Revolution, 1792-1816, a work that he would return to some two decades later. "Let Europe be the stage," Hardy wrote on March 13, 1874, "and have scenes continually shifting."8 Perhaps, as Hardy thought when he discovered his note after more than a quarter-century, it was then that he first thought of "a conception of The Dynasts." His puzzlement indicated that he had forgotten the exact moment of genesis. Far more likely, indeed, that there was no one moment; that the associations and leisure readings of a lifetime were preparing him for a major dramatization of the most significant European wars of the century; and that his visit of 1874 (with Emma) to locales in France associated with Napoleon, and again in 1876, to Waterloo, provided him with the continuing inspiration he needed. By June, 1875, he was considering the possibility of "A Ballad of a Hundred Days," another ballad on Moscow, and a series of ballads about earlier 8 Thomas Hardy's Notebooks and Some Letters from Julia Augusta Martin, ed. Evelyn Hardy (London, 1955), p. 45.</page><page sequence="5">HAROLD OREL / 113 campaigns, "forming altogether an Iliad of Europe from 1789 to 1815." These inter-linked ballads would have constituted "an epic on the war with Napoleon" (Life, p. 106). In June, 1877, Hardy recorded his intention of creating "a grand drama, based on the wars with Napoleon, or some one campaign, (but not as Shakespeare's historical dramas)." He was uncertain whether to call it "Napoleon" or "Josephine," or some other person's name (p. 1 14). Josephine as heroine would have feminized his subject matter in ways that are difficult to imagine today, and Hardy still had not made up his mind about the span of years he intended to cover; but this jotting of 1877 was indicative of Hardy's interest in the form of his new work. By November, 1880, when he called it a "Great Modern Drama" (Life, p. 146), his use of the word "modern" signified the resonances of the theme to Englishmen three-quarters of a century after Trafalgar. On March 27, 1881, he conceived of Napoleon as "a sort of Achilles" who would serve as the protagonist of "a Homeric Ballad," yet a few days later he returned to the thought that drama was more suitable as a genre: "Mode for a historical Drama. Action mostly automatic; reflex movement, etc. Not the result of what is called motive, though always ostensibly so, even to the actors' own consciousness. Apply an enlargement of these theories to, say, The Hundred Days'!" Here, for the first time, Hardy was relating the Napoleonic era to a "philosophic scheme or framework," something larger in import, "enclosing the historic scenes" (Life, p. 148). During the 1880's, in brief, The Dynasts became a lingering, obsessive concern to which he could not devote as much time as he would have liked. In 1886 he was reading systematically in the British Museum Library "and elsewhere," preparing himself for what he was later to call "the question of The Dynasts'" (Life, p. 183). In the spring of 1887 he visited the roof of Milan Cathedral, and there probably imagined the scene in The Dynasts which uses the Cathedral as a means of character revelation. In November, he worked on another outline scheme: Napoleon would be "haunted by an Evil Genius or Familiar, whose existence he has to confess to his wives" (Life, p. 203). Perhaps unsurprisingly, this concept proved deficient; and similarly to be abandoned was the scheme of Napoleon's use of necromancy to "see the thoughts of opposing generals" (p. 203). Yet, within a month, he knew that Coleridge's rule ("a long poem should not attempt to be poetical all through") would guide him as he concentrated the "ornaments of diction" in particular passages of the epic he was yet to write. Most biographers and critics underestimate the length of the gestation period. By 1895 Hardy had clearly identified the historical period he wished to treat (1805-15), regarded Napoleon as his major figure (one hesitates to use the word "hero"), thought of this unwritten work as differing in scope from and presenting a greater challenge than anything he</page><page sequence="6">114 / VICTORIAN POETRY had written before, and intended to present a recension of his opinions on the nature and significance of the Immanent Will. Moreover, he planned to cast it in the form of a drama or of an epic; possibly, he had begun to speculate, as a hybridized genre. An illuminating note was recorded on September 21,1 889: "For carrying out that idea of Napoleon, the Empress, Pitt, Fox, etc., I feel continually that I require a larger canvas. ... A spectral tone must be adopted. . . . Royal ghosts. . . . Title: 4A Drama of Kings'" {Life, p. 221). It is true that the striking similarity of this projected title to that of Robert Buchanan's closet drama (1871) has caught the eye of scholars;9 but Buchanan's fustian, historical digressions, and failure to consider adequately the English role in defeating Napoleon could have presented Hardy with only the feeblest type of inspiration for his own magnum opus. Moreover, Hardy needed a tighter time-frame than Buchanan had used (two of the three parts of Buchanan's play dealt with 1870-71), and he soon dropped plans to review the stormy events of the French Revolution as a luxury of chronology that he could not afford. Then followed a note dated 1891, when Hardy was completing Tess: "A Bird's-Eye View of Europe at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century It may be called 4A Drama of the Times of the First Napoleon'" (Life, p. 234). The "Napoleon drama" was to obsess him for the next fifteen years. At one level, then, Hardy was writing about a French general whose character and actions had affected the lives of millions. If he focused on the period between the day when Napoleon put the crown of Lombardy on his own head in the Cathedral of Milan and the day when he was "stung by spectral questionings" in the wood of Bossu after the battle of Waterloo, he had ready-made a reasonably well-shaped drama of the meteor-like fall of a dynast. For almost any other writer of his generation, that would have been enough of a creative problem. But The Dynasts, as the Fore Scene informs us, takes place partly in the Overworld, where choral observers named Spirits talk continually about the Immanent Will and Its designs. Hardy's epic-drama is (among other things) an eloquent, detailed, and by-and-large consistent statement about the relationship of human beings to the forces that shape the universe. The Preface maintains with prudent modesty that the doctrines of the Spirits are "but tentative," and should be taken "as contrivances of the fancy merely." Hardy argues that these doctrines might, at best, secure, "in the words of Coleridge, 'that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith'."10 9Hoxie N. Fairchild, "The Immediate Source of The Dynasts" PMLA, 67 (1952), 43-64. 10 Thomas Hardy's Persona/ Writings: Prefaces, Literary Opinions, Reminiscences, ed. Harold Orel (London, 1967), p. 40. All subsequent references to the Preface are to this edition.</page><page sequence="7">HAROLD OREL / 115 Nevertheless, Hardy knew (better than most of his critics, indeed) how radically his epic-drama differed from previous literary models. Since the gods of the old dispensation were no longer believed in, the "celestial machinery" of the Iliad, the Eddas, and Paradise Lost was irrelevant to a modern poet. God was no longer creditable as an "anthropomorphic conception." Napoleon's defeat, if it were ever to become important to the twentieth century, must be rendered in the language of an artist, certainly not that of a biographer or historian. He would invent - as he put it - a "modern expression of a modern outlook." The notion that a participant in battle does not perceive the larger outlines of strategy had been dramatized by Stendhal; the doctrine that war moves at its own lumbering, inevitable pace, unaffected by anything Napoleon did, or could have done, had been argued by Tolstoy (a writer whom Hardy greatly admired, though Hardy had not as yet read his War and Peace). Still, the "supernatural spectators of the terrestrial action" had a great deal more to say about the follies of mankind at war, and much of it was bound to disturb those readers and reviewers who had already been upset by authorial comments made in Tess and Jude. The Immanent Will had already been discussed seriously, and at length, by Eduard von Hartmann {Philosophy of the Unconscious, translated into English in 1884) and Arthur Schopenhauer (The World as Will and Idea, read by Hardy in its 1890 translation), but Hardy knew even as Part First moved through the press that his treatment would stir up the British Philistine. If we keep in mind that Hardy's renunciation of the novel as an art form was not meant to be taken as a renunciation of literature itself or of his personal religious views, and the fact that Hardy had formulated most of the over- all plan for 7776* Dynasts well before the turn of the century, the famous note of October 17, 1896, may be seen as doubly artful: Poetry. Perhaps 1 can express more fully in verse ideas and emotions which run counter to the inert crystallized opinion - hard as a rock - which the vast body of men have vested interests in supporting. To cry out in a passionate poem that (for instance) the Supreme Mover or Movers, the Prime Force or Forces, must be either limited in power, unknowing, or cruel - which is obvious enough, and has been for centuries - will cause them merely a shake of the head; but to put it in argumentative prose will make them sneer, or foam, and set all the literary contortionists jumping upon me, a harmless agnostic, as if 1 were a clamorous atheist, which in their crass illiteracy they seem to think is the same thing. . . . If Galileo had said in verse that the world moved, the Inquisition might have let him alone. {Life, pp. 284-285) Hardy's opinion - that the Immanent Will is indifferent to man's aspirations - is lucidly argued by the Spirits (and The Dynasts is "a passionate poem," as we shall see). The Immanent Will does not speak directly for Itself; it is "viewless" and "voiceless"; most of what we learn about It comes from the speeches of the Spirits. It works unconsciously. We may cherish only the faintest hope that some day, after the passing of eons, It may become self-aware, and thus help to improve the lot of the</page><page sequence="8">116 / VICTORIAN POETRY human race. At the present time, It controls human destiny. Whether history is to be regarded as terrestrial tragedy (according to the Spirit of the Pities) or comedy (Spirit Ironic), "these flesh-hinged mannikins" do not operate independently, and can not. They move as one organism. Wars have long been ordained: "Ere systemed suns were globed and lit / The slaughters of the race were writ" (I. II. v). Thus, Napoleon's schemes for the continuation of dynastic power are foredoomed, and at the end of the epic- drama the dynasts who succeed him have no clearer sense of their own limitations, of their vulnerability to "the Immanent Unrecking." Men do not learn from one generation to the next. After Waterloo, when - presumably - the forces of humanity have defeated the discredited, exhausted army of the Emperor, the Spirit of the Years can say, in melancholy tones no less intense because its message has been prefigured, So hath the Urging Immanence used to-day Its inadvertent might to field this fray; And Europe's wormy dynasties rerobe Themselves in their old gilt, to dazzle anew the globe! (III. vn. viii) The Spirits are as much subject to the Will as "the frail ones" who "gyrate like animalcula / In tepid pools." Hardy differentiates them nevertheless. Most important is the Spirit of the Years, to whom the deterministic shape of this grim decade is clear from the very beginning. Years rationalizes whenever he speaks: "The Will has woven with an absent heed / Since life first was; and ever will so weave" (Fore Scene). Years sees no point in moaning about "the World-Soul's way." He insists that the Semichoruses of the Pities pay attention again to "the ordered potencies, / Nerves, sinews, trajects, eddies, ducts" of the Will (I. VI. iii)- as if by grim repetition the refractory student will learn his lesson. More attractive for many readers is the Spirit of the Pities, who came into the world late, during the Tertiary Age of human beings, and hence must defer to the older Years. Remembering Christianity from "its early, lovingkindly days," before it became ceremonial and institutionalized, Pities recognizes the illogicality of emotion: I feel, Sire, as I must! This tale of Will And Life's impulsion by Incognizance I cannot take. (I. i. vi) Unable to accept the grimness of Years's teaching, Pities cannot delay the passing of men "to dark corruption, at the best" (II. IV. viii), and change its inevitability. The importance of this Figure lies in the advocacy of compassion: the suggestion, however faint, that men may choose between alternatives. The names of the other Spirits are suggestive: Ironic, Sinister, Rumours, Recording Angels. Shade of the Earth must be thought of as</page><page sequence="9">HAROLD OREL / 117 feminine, even Shelleyan: she regards herself as the "ineffectual Shade" of the earth, and looks forward to a time when those "who love the true, the excellent" will inherit her bounties. She is on the side of Pities, who, after all the campaigns have ended, speaks last. Hardy refracted through the speeches of his Spirits the significance of a grand cavalcade of events that no mere human participant could appreciate. He solved the problem of perspective by viewing Europe as the Spirits might, from an awesome height above the earth. For some readers, this has always been Hardy's most original contribution, the angles of vision that relate "the mindless minions" wheeling "in mechanized enchantment" to huger vistas, to the curvature of the earth itself. The Fore Scene begins with one such spectacle, as the nether sky opens to disclose Europe: "a prone and emaciated figure, the Alps shaping like a backbone, and the branching mountain-chains like ribs, the peninsular plateau of Spain forming a head. Broad and lengthy lowlands stretch from the north of France across Russia like a grey-green garment hemmed by the Ural mountains and the glistening Arctic Ocean." Hardy moves closer: "The point of view then sinks downwards through space, and draws near to the surface of the perturbed countries, where the peoples, distressed by events which they did not cause, are seen writhing, crawling, heaving, and vibrating in their various cities and nationalities." At times Hardy imagines himself "on high over the Straits of Dover, and stretching from city to city" (London to Paris, II. I. ii), or above the open sea between the English coasts and the Spanish Peninsula ("Four groups of moth-like transport ships are discovered silently skimming this wide liquid plain," II. II. v), or over the spacious field later to be commemorated by the name of the village Borodino (III. I. v), or so high that Leipzig may be seen as "somewhat in the shape of the letter D, the straight part of which is the river Pleisse" (III. III. ii). Some of Hardy's finest descriptive writing may be found in these openings to scenes of momentous import, of sanguinary excess, whether at Cape Trafalgar or Torres Vedras or Vimiero, and as representative as any, and as splendidly imagined, is the field of Waterloo itself, to which an impatient reader may be referred (III. vil. i). This mode of seeing may be termed Burkean. Hardy found ample warrant for it in a book he knew well, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (first published in 1757, enlarged in 1759). There, he found defined several causes of the Sublime, among them vastness, also called "greatness of dimension." Burke mused that looking down from a precipice was probably more striking "than . . . looking up at an object of equal height" (II. vii), and Hardy took the thought as a guide to the writing of dozens of descriptions throughout the poem.</page><page sequence="10">118 / VICTORIAN POETRY In addition to his desire to impose order upon a jumble of childhood impressions, to confer significance upon history by the devising of a philosophical and theological argument, and to exploit a novel way of treating European vistas (one that still defies the technical resources of the cinema), Hardy had still another reason for wanting to write The Dynasts. In his Preface, he admitted that completing The Trumpet-Major and seeing it into print had brought him only to "the fringe of a vast international tragedy," and he had been unable to do more artistically with its "events" (pp. 39-40). "But," he added, "the slight regard paid to English influence and action throughout the struggle by those Continental writers who had dealt imaginatively with Napoleon's career, seemed always to leave room for a new handling of the theme which should re-embody the features of this influence in their true proportion; and accordingly" (p. 40). What Hardy was saying, in brief, was that the Napoleonic Wars had failed to attract writers willing to give proper credit to the Younger Pitt, Nelson, Wellington, and the thousands of English soldiers and sailors who had fought, and finally defeated, the French Emperor. The failure of imaginative writers - of Romantic and Victorian poets and novelists - to exploit the riches of these materials has puzzled not only Hardy, but historians and literary critics. William R. Rutland, for example, has dismissed as relatively minor efforts the celebrated Waterloo passage in the third canto of Byron's Childe Harold, and the Odes in Contribution to the Song of French History written by Meredith (less than a thousand lines survive). When Tennyson memorialized the Great Duke, he predicted that in some later age ("Far on in summers that we shall not see") another poet would celebrate Wellington's triumph over Napoleon; he did not attempt the task himself. Rutland went on to say, in a judgment that has not been challenged: The Dynasts is to-day the greatest imaginative representation of the Napoleonic epoch in the literature of Western Europe. As far as English is concerned, it is likely to remain without successors, as it was without forerunners. No major English poet before Hardy had cared to dedicate himself to that theme; and after Hardy none will either dare or desire to sing again the lay he sang once for all." At this point we come to the baffling problem for which no critic has yet proposed a satisfactory solution: the discrepancy between Hardy's grim, unrelenting vision of a helpless humanity, "atoms," entangled by the weavings of an unthinking Will, and the heroism of a few individuals (mostly English, though Hardy admired Marshal Ney, and always depicted him favorably). The Dynasts, without descending to the level of 11 Thomas Hardy. A Study of his Writings and Their Background (Oxford, 1938; rpt. New York, 1962), p. 271.</page><page sequence="11">HAROLD OREL / 119 crude caricature of "Boney" save in a few Wessex scenes, and without flinching from the unflattering record of English war-profiteering, cowardice, and a strong desire to act as if Napoleon were an ephemeral phenomenon, is essentially a patriotic work. It is true that the first long movement of The Dynasts describes Trafalgar, a naval battle that pitted Villeneuve of the Bucentaure against Nelson of the Victory (I. v ), with Napoleon only a name; that Napoleon is not directly involved as a character in any of the scenes depicting Spanish battlefields (II. il-iv and VI); and that Wellington is not in direct confrontation with Napoleon during the Russian campaign (III. i-ll). But England is throughout and everywhere the Nemesis of the French Emperor's dynastic schemes. It is certainly more real to him than the Immanent Will, the workings of which he only faintly apprehends. For Napoleon, the English are "licentious," like all "canting peoples" (III. II. ii), insolent, able and willing to stir up dissension on the Continent, using their wealth to frustrate him, a nation skilled in a "tough, enisled, self-centred, kindless craft." If Nelson had not blocked him at sea and, at the cost of his own life, crippled his great armada, he would have invaded England. If England had not heartened and supported the guerilla forces on the Iberian Peninsula, he could have secured a minimal army there while he turned his attention to Russia. He blamed England for turning the Tsar's head from his resolve to destroy that nation, a pledge made at Tilsit and the River Niemen (II. I. vii). The English resolutely refused to recognize the government of Joseph, King of Spain. Later, if he succeeded in his Russian invasion, he would march on to the Ganges, and then Once ripped by a French sword, the scaffolding Of English merchant-mastership in Ind Will fall a wreck. (III. i. i) All that he did in Russia (Napoleon told himself) was done to revenge himself upon England. Hardy's emphasis on Napoleon's monomaniacal hatred of his enemy across the Channel distorts the historical record, for England was out of Napoleon's mind for long periods of time. But these iterations do redress the balance for generations of neglect by previous historians, and do give the English their due for the first time in imaginative literature. Moreover, Hardy's heroes are astonishingly god-like. When the candle-snuffers do their duty (I. I. iii), Pitt rises to speak, and "during the momentary pause . . . the House assumes an attentive stillness, in which can be heard the rustling of the trees without, a horn from an early coach, and the voice of the watch crying the hour." To Pitt a "strange fatality" now "haunts the times" wherein the lot of Englishmen is cast, but he is determined to face the perils created by Napoleon. The King may reject his counsel (Pitt wants to form a</page><page sequence="12">120 / VICTORIAN POETRY coalition government with Fox and Lord Grenville), but he will not despair. After Nelson's astonishing victory - England is not to be threatened at sea for the remainder of the century - he proffers a toast at the Guildhall: no man has saved England, let me say: England has saved herself, by her exertions: She will, I trust, save Europe by her example! (I. v. v) Years calls this speech "his last large words"; but dying, Pitt is to call, "My country! How I leave my country!" (I. VI. viii) and we are reminded of Nelson's valedictory, after the great sailor has ordered Beatty to "Go to the others who lie bleeding there," and Hardy to kiss him. (Hardy framed and kept the portrait of Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, Nelson's flag-captain and his kinsman, a collateral descendant, framed opposite a portrait of himself in the drawing-room of Max Gate.) "I'm satisfied," Nelson murmurs. "Thank God, I have done my duty!" Wellington is less quotable, and Hardy indicated, by printing his name in italics among the list of characters at the beginning of Part Second, that he would remain mute throughout the Peninsular Campaign. But Wellington is no less devoted to King and country than Pitt or Nelson: he speaks often of "poor devils" and "brave men"; he never loses faith in the ultimate victory; and every speech at Waterloo - during the most perilous and undecided moments of that seesaw engagement - is a rallying-cry: At Talavera, Salamanca, boys, And at Vitoria, we saw smoke together; And though the day seems wearing doubtfully, Beaten we must not be! (III. vn. vii) The royal blood of courage runs freely among the common people, in the scenes of Wessex (Rainbarrows' Beacon, Egdon Heath, I. II. v, and Durnover Green, Casterbridge, III. V. vi), the streets of London, the reception-room of the Marchioness of Salisbury's ("At last, then, England will take her place in the forefront of this mortal struggle, and in pure disinterestedness fight with all her strength for the European deliverance. God defend the right!"- II. II. iii), in a Viennese cafe in the Stephans-Platz, at the Ford of Santa Marta, Salamanca, on the plain of Vitoria, and at the famous ball in the now-legendary ballroom of the Duke and Duchess of Richmond's, Brussels, the night before Waterloo. These men and women - and Hardy, too - regarded Napoleon as someone to take seriously. He is, of course, the most important character in the epic-drama. Hardy's characterization of the nineteenth-century Alexander depended heavily on "oral tradition, accessible scenery, and existing relics," as well as "the abundant pages of the historian, the biographer, and the journalist, English and Foreign," as he wrote in the</page><page sequence="13">HAROLD OREL / 121 Preface (p. 40). The historians were by far the most useful: Sir Archibald Alison's History of Europe (ten volumes, useful as background for III. i); Hazlitt's Life of Napoleon Buonaparte (four volumes); Adolphe Thiers' Histoire du Consulat et de V Empire (twenty volumes, and perhaps Hardy's most important single source, available to the poet in both the Paris edition of 1857 and the D. Forbes Campbell translation); W. F. P. Napier's The History of the War in the Peninsula (six volumes); and le Comte de S6gur, William Beatty, and the Baron Claude-Francois de Meneval.12 If occasionally the inconsistencies of Hardy's characterization puzzle us, if the Napoleon who acts as master of his destiny seems oddly incongruous with the Napoleon who cowers before premonitions, ghostly warnings, and dreams, the roots of the problem lie in the baffled studies of the Emperor's life that Hardy consulted. The historians, despite the passage of more than seven decades, had not formed a consensus. The legend of Napoleon as legitimate heir of the French Revolution and as Lawgiver still seemed attractive. Part of Hardy's originality must be accounted his willingness to endorse the historian Pierre Lanfrey's harsh verdict on Napoleon's character. In his structuring of scenes that dramatize the impossible and thankless assignment to Villeneuve, the hypocritical negotiations with representatives of rival nations, the ruthless treatment of Josephine, Marie Louise, and Louisa of Prussia, and the delight in the carnage of war, Hardy presents us with a loveless and unlovable hero. Nevertheless, a hero; and Hardy's portrait, despite its somber coloration, is more subtle, human, and credible than any other fictionalized version. Napoleon unifies the work; he is present more often, and has more to say, than any other of the 297 human beings with speaking roles. His vision of himself as Emperor, and of the King of Rome as his legitimate successor, is at least as appealing as the mean and corroded ambitions of the other dynasts of Europe. If such a vision is to be bought at excessive cost, Hardy makes sure that we know how much the royal houses have earned their destruction. (Hardy reserves his pity for the soldiers who die for causes they do not understand, and for the civilians who suffer for no cause at all.) Napoleon's interest in moral and ethical questions, his sincere belief that he works "for France," and his obvious zest in holding center-stage, make him more than a crookback Richard. As his character deteriorates, the images of his physical debilitation multiply, particularly after Borodino; yet for most of the epic-drama, as in life, he exerts a genuine, almost sexual attraction over worldly-wise men and women who 12See R.

The speech to Queen Louisa, delivered at a moment when he is determined to deny her Magdeburg, or what she prizes most, impresses us as what Napoleon must, in fact, have believed about himself: Know you, my Fair, That I - ay, I - in this deserve your pity. - Some force within me, baffling mine intent, Harries me onward, whether I will or no. My star, my star is what's to blame - not I. It is unswervable! (II. i. viii) The reviewers of Part First carped at its "hard Pyrrhonism," its "quasi-dramatic form," and its occasionally crabbed and unpoetical language. The Dynasts, as they saw immediately, did not resemble anything that Hardy had written earlier. But as the years have passed, it has become more clear that The Dynasts is the most authentic continuator of epic tradition in the twentieth century. It fulfills every requirement listed by E. M. W. Tillyard in The English Epic and Its Background: high quality and high seriousness, amplitude and variety, rigorous control, and choric appropriateness ("the epic must communicate the feeling of what it was like to be alive at the time").13 The term "epic-drama" was adopted rather late by Hardy, after he had dallied with such coinages as "a mental drama, a vision drama . . . or 'A Chronicle poem of the Napoleonic Wars under the similitude of a drama'."14 Hardy freely acknowledged the unplayability of The Dynasts in a conventional theatre. Still, as he suggested in his Preface, the speeches of such a play "of poesy and dream" might well be recited in "a monotonic delivery . . . with dreamy conventional gestures, something in the manner traditionally maintained by the old Christmas mummers" (p. 43). He was understandably irritated when Arthur Bingham Walkley (1855-1926), in an unsigned article printed in the Times Literary Supplement on January 29, 1904, suggested that since The Dynasts treated Pitt, Nelson, and Napoleon as "puppets," the epic-drama might well be staged as a puppet- show. The exchange of letters that followed (Hardy on February 5, Walkley on February 12, and Hardy once again, and for the last time, on February 19) made clear two things: Hardy saw quite clearly that considerations of form were distracting readers from an appreciation of what, in fact, he had accomplished, and the degree to which he had 13E.

In recent years, and particularly since World War II, Hardy's work has been praised more generously, and seen for what it is: the central event of his life, and not an aberration from a developing career as a poet of love lyrics and dramatic sketches and satires. The Dynasts treats issues of great magnitude, challenges the imagination, and achieves something very close to sublimity in the Burkean sense. It triumphs over its faults, the mixed materials, the lengthy passages of ill-disguised prose and only partially versified transcription, the tedious repetitions of the querulous Spirits, the inconsistent treatment of heroism in a predetermined universe. These faults are inseparable from a splendor of vision unique to Hardy. Disillusioned by the Great War and by the Treaty of Versailles, Hardy wrote, years later, that Napoleon had thrown back "human altruism scores, perhaps hundreds of years." If he could have foreseen the Great War, he might not have written The Dynasts at all, or at least might not have concluded it with a carefully-worded promise of a developing self- awareness on the part of the Immanent Will. Two months before his death he brooded that "he had done all that he meant to do, but he did not know whether it had been worth doing" {Life, p. 444). The starkness of these final views, recorded in the poignant section of the Life entitled "Life's Decline," should not obscure the fact that, long before the revulsion caused by trench warfare, Hardy had recorded the strongest possible indictment of the bloodiness and impersonality of modern warfare. No reader of Hardy's descriptions of the debacle of the Satschan lake (Austerlitz), the "ghastly climax" of Albuera, the slaughter at the bridge of the Beresina, or of what takes place during the snowstorm on the road from Smolensko into Lithuania, can mistake Hardy's moral indignation as being that of a cynical or neutral perspective. Anger at the futility of war, compassion for the defenseless and the defeated, admiration for the inspired leadership of Nelson, Pitt, and Wellington, and love of country: the epic-drama surges with emotion. Thomas Hardy never spoke more directly than through the Chorus of the Years in that great lyric timed just before the fighting begins at Waterloo (III. vi. viii). One may not read it unmoved; nor, once having read the whole, remember it without affection.15 l5This article originally appeared as the introduction to the New Wessex Edition of The Dynasts, ed.
