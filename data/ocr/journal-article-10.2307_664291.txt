<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST By LESLIE A. WHITE "Again and again in the world's history, savage tribes must have had plainly before their minds the simple practical alternative be- tween marrying-out and being killed out."-E. B. Tylor* THE subject of incest has a strange fascination for man. He was preoc- cupied with it long before he developed the art of writing. We find in- cestuous episodes in the mythologies of countless peoples. And in advanced cultures, from Sophocles to Eugene O'Neill, incest has been one of the most popular of all literary themes. Men seem never to tire of it but continue to find it ever fresh and absorbing. Incest must indeed be reckoned as one of man's major interests in life. Yet, despite this intense and perennial concern, it is a fact that incest is but little understood even today. Men of science have been obliged all too often to admit that they are baffled and to declare that it is too mysterious, too obscure, to yield to rational interpretation, at least for the present. One of the more common explanations of the universal prohibition of incest is that it is instinctive. Thus Robert H. Lowie, a distinguished anthropologist, once accepted "Hobhouse's view that the sentiment is instinctive."' To "ex- plain" an element of behavior by saying that it is "instinctive" contributes little to our understanding of it as a rule. Sometimes it merely conceals our ignorance with a verbal curtain of pseudo-knowledge. To say that prohibitions against incest are "instinctive" is of course to declare that there is a natural, inborn and innate feeling of revulsion toward unions with close relatives. But if this were the case, why should societies enact strict laws to prevent them? Why should they legislate against something that everyone already wishes passionately to avoid? Do not, as a matter of fact, the stringent and worldwide prohibitions indicate a universal and powerful desire for sexual unions with one's relatives?2 There are further objections to the instinct theory. Some societies regard marriage with a first cousin as incestuous while others do not. Are we to assume that the instinct varies from tribe to tribe? Certainly when we consider our own legal definitions of incest, which vary from state to state, to claim that a biological instinct can recognize state boundary lines is some- what grotesque. In some societies it is incestuous to marry a parallel cousin (a child of your father's brother or of your mother's sister) but it is permissible, and may even be mandatory, to marry a cross cousin (a child of your father's sister or of your mother's brother). We cannot see how "instinct" can account for this, either; in fact, we cannot see how instinct can distinguish a cross * Tylor, 1888, p. 267. 1 Lowie, 1920, p. 15. 2 "Freud has shown all but conclusively that incestuous tendencies represent one of the most deeply rooted impulses of the individual."

It is usually incestuous to marry a clansman even though no genealogical connection whatever can be discovered with him, whereas marriage with a close relative in another clan may be permissible. Plainly, the instinct theory does not help us at all, and it is not easy to find a scientist to defend it today.3 Another theory, championed generations ago by Lewis H. Morgan and others, and not without defenders today, is that incest was defined and pro- hibited because inbreeding causes biological degeneration.4 This theory is so plausible as to seem self-evident, but it is wrong for all that. In the first place, inbreeding as such does not cause degeneration; the testimony of biologists is conclusive on this point. To be sure, inbreeding intensifies the inheritance of traits, good or bad. If the offspring of a union of brother and sister are inferior it is because the parents were of inferior stock, not because they were brother and sister. But superior traits as well as inferior ones can be intensified by in- breeding, and plant and animal breeders frequently resort to this device to improve their strains. If the children of brother-sister or father-daughter unions in our own society are frequently feeble-minded or otherwise inferior it is because feeble-minded individuals are more likely to break the powerful incest tabu than are normal men and women and hence more likely to beget degenerate offspring. But in societies where brother-sister marriages are per- mitted or required, at least within the ruling family, as in ancient Egypt, aboriginal Hawaii and Incaic Peru, we may find excellence. Cleopatra was the offspring of brother-sister marriages continued through several generations and she was "not only handsome, vigorous, intellectual, but also prolific . . . as perfect a specimen of the human race as could be found in any age or class of society."' But there is still another objection to the degeneration theory as a means of accounting for the origin of prohibitions against incest. A number of competent ethnographers have claimed that certain tribes are quite ignorant of the nature of the biological process of reproduction, specifically, that they are unaware of the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Or, they may believe that coitus is prerequisite to pregnancy but not the cause of it." B. Malinowski, for example, claims that the Trobriand Islanders denied that copulation has anything to do with pregnancy, not only among human beings but among the lower animals as well.' This thesis of ignorance of the facts of 3 In 1932, Professor Lowie abandoned the instinct theory of incest prohibitions. But he comes no closer to an explanation than to observe that "the aversion to incest is, therefore, best re- garded as a primeval cultural adaptation" (Lowie, 1933, p. 67). In one of his recent works (Lowie, 1940, p. 232), he again discusses incest but goes no further than to suggest that "the horror of incest is not inborn, though it is doubtless a very ancient cultural feature." 4 See Morgan, 1877, pp. 69, 378, 424. 5 Mahaffy, 1915, p. 1. 6 See Montagu, 1937, both for a discussion of this subject and for bibliographic references to other articles. 7 See Malinowski, 1929b, especially pp. 155 ff., 3, 171.</page><page sequence="3">418 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 life among primitive peoples has been challenged by other ethnologists, and I am not prepared to adjudicate the dispute. But it may be pointed out that such ignorance should not be very surprising. Once a fact becomes well known there is a tendency to regard it as self-evident. But the relationship between coitus and pregnancy, a condition that would not be discovered until weeks or even a few months later, is anything but obvious. Furthermore, pregnancy does not always follow intercourse. And knowing primitive man's penchant for explaining so many things, the phenomena of life and death especially, in terms of supernatural forces or agents, we should not be surprised to find some tribes even today who do not understand the physiology of paternity. At any rate, there must have been a time at which such understanding was not possessed by any members of the human race. We have no reason to believe that apes have any appreciation of these facts, and it must have taken man a long time to acquire it. There are reasons, however, as we shall show later on, for believing that incest tabus appeared in the very earliest stage of human social evolution, in all probability prior to an understanding of paternity. The reason for the prohibition of inbreeding could not therefore have been a desire to prevent deterioration of stock if the connection between copulation and the birth of children was not understood. This thesis receives additional support from a consideration of the kinship systems of many primitive peoples. In these systems a person calls many of his collateral relatives "brother" and "sister," namely, his parallel cousins of several degrees for example, and the children of his mother's and father's parallel cousins, also of several degrees. Marriage between individuals who call each other "brother" and "sister" is strictly prohibited by the incest tabu, even though they be cousins of the third or fourth degree. But marriage with a first cross cousin may be permitted and often is required. Now these people may not understand the biology of conception and pregnancy, but they know which woman bore each child. Thus we see that the marriage rules disregard the degree of biological relationship so far as preventing inbreeding is con- cerned; they may prohibit marriage with a fourth parallel cousin who is called "brother" or "sister," but permit or require marriage with a first cross cousin who is called "cousin." Obviously, the kinship terms express sociological rather than biological relationships. Obvious also is the fact that the incest tabus follow the pattern of social ties rather than those of blood. But suppose that inbreeding did produce inferior offspring, are we to sup- pose that ignorant, magic-ridden savages could have established this correla- tion without rather refined statistical techniques? How could they have iso- lated the factor of inbreeding from numerous others such as genetics, nutrition, illnesses of mother and infant, etc., without some sort of medical criteria and measurements-even though crude-and without even the rudiments of sta- tistics?</page><page sequence="4">WHITE] THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST 419 Finally, if we should grant that inbreeding does produce degeneracy, and that primitive peoples were able to recognize this fact, why did they prohibit marriage with a parallel cousin while allowing or even requiring union with a cross cousin? Both are equally close biologically. Or, why was marriage with a clansman prohibited even though the blood tie was so remote that it could not be established genealogically with the data available to memory, while marriage with a non-clansman was permitted even though he was a close blood relative? Obviously the degeneracy theory is as weak as the instinct hypothesis, although it may be more engaging intellectually. Sigmund Freud's theory is ingenious and appealing-in a dramatic sort of way at least. Proceeding from Darwin's conjectures concerning the primal social state of man, based upon what was then known about anthropoid apes, and utilizing W. Robertson Smith's studies of totemism and sacrifice, Freud developed the following thesis: in the earliest stage of human society, people- lived in small groups each of which was dominated by a powerful male, the Father. This individual monopolized all females in the group, daughters as well as mothers. As the young males grew up and became sexually mature, the Father drove them away to keep them from sharing his females with him. "One day," says Freud, "the expelled brothers joined forces, slew and ate the father, and thus put an end to the father horde. Together they dared and accomplished what would have remained impossible for them singly."8 But they did not divide their Father's women among themselves as they had planned. Now that he was dead their hatred and aggressiveness disappeared, and their love and respect for him came to the fore. As a consequence, they determined Jo give him in death the submission and obedience they had re- fused in life. They made therefore a solemn pact to touch none of their Father's women and to seek mates elsewhere. This pledge was passed on from one generation to the next:9 you must have nothing to do with the women of your father's household, i.e., of your own group, but must seek other mates. In this way the incest tabu and the institution of exogamy came into being. This part of Totem and Taboo is great drama and not without value as an interpretation of powerful psychological forces, just as Hamlet is great drama in the same sense. But as ethnology, Freud's theory would still be inadequate even if this much were verifiable. It does not even attempt to account for the many and varied forms of incest prohibition. It is not our purpose here to survey and criticize all of the many theories 8 Freud, 1931, p. 247. 9 In another work (1938, p. 617, fn. 1), Freud suggests, if he does not say so outright, that the incest tabu became incorporated into the germ plasm and was consequently transmitted by means of biological heredity: "The incest barrier probably belongs to the historical acquisitions of humanity and, like other moral taboos, it must be fixed in many individuals through organic heredity."</page><page sequence="5">420 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 that have been advanced in the past to account for the definition and pro- hibition of incest. We may however briefly notice two others before we leave the subject, namely, those of E. Westermarck and Emile Durkheim. Westermarck's thesis that "the fundamental cause of the exogamous pro- hibitions seems to be the remarkable absence of erotic feelings between persons living very closely together from childhood, leading to a positive feeling of aversion when the act is thought of,"'o is not in accord with the facts in the first place and would still be inadequate if it were. Propinquity does not an- nihilate sexual desire, and if it did there would be no need for stringent pro- hibitions. Secondly, incest tabus are frequently in force between persons not living in close association. Durkheim attempts to explain the prohibition .of incest as a part of his general theory of totemism. The savage knew intuitively, Durkheim reasoned, that blood is a vital fluid or principle. To shed the blood of one's own totemic group would be a great sin or crime. Since blood would be shed in the initial act of intercourse, a man must eschew all women of his own totem. Thus the tabu against incest and rules of exogamy came into being." This theory is wholly inadequate ethnologically. Tabus against incest are much more wide- spread than totemism; the former are virtually universal, the latter is far from being so. And the theory does not even attempt to explain the many diverse forms of the definition and prohibition of incest. In view of repeated attempts and as many failures to account for the origin of definitions of incest and of rules regulating its prohibition, is it any wonder that many scholars, surveying decades of fruitless theories, have become dis- couraged and have come to feel that the problem is still too difficult to yield to scientific interpretation? In the same work in which he presented his theory, but some pages earlier, Freud said: "Still, in the end, one is compelled to subscribe to Frazer's resigned statement, namely, that we do not know the origin of incest dread and do not even know how to guess at it."'12 Ralph Linton treats of the subject as follows:13 The causes which underlie such limitations on marriage, technically known as incest regulations, are very imperfectly understood. Since these regulations are of uni- versal occurrence, it seems safe to assume that their causes are everywhere present, but biological factors can be ruled out at once. Close inbreeding is not necessarily injurious .. Neither are purely social explanations of incest regulations altogether satisfactory, since the forms which these regulations assume are extremely varied . . . It seems pos- sible that there are certain psychological factors involved, but these can hardly be strong o10 Westermarck, 1921, Table of Contents for Ch. 20. 11 Durkheim, 1898, pp. 50 fif. 12 Freud, 1931, p. 217. Frazer's statement was: "Thus the ultimate origin of exogamy and with it the law of incest-since exogamy was devised to prevent incest-remains a problem nearly as dark as ever."

They have probably originated from a combination of all these factors... In other words, somewhere in the man-culture situation lie the causes of incest regulations, but where they are and why and how they are exercised are matters too obscure for description or explanation. The late Alexander Goldenweiser, a prominent disciple of Franz Boas, never discovered the secret of the prohibition of incest. In Early Civilization he spoke of certain tabus that "are everywhere reinforced by the so-called 'horror of incest,' an emotional reaction of somewhat mysterious origin."14 Fifteen years later, in Anthropology, his last major work, he could go no further than to repeat these identical words.15 The sociologists have little to offer. Kimball Young, for example, disavows instinct as the source of incest prohibitions, but he advances no further expla- nation than to assert that "the taboo is a rather constant and expected result arising from the very nature of the social interaction between parents and children and among the children themselves"le--which is virtually equivalent to no explanation at all. The late Clark Wissler, one of the foremost anthropologists of our day, observes :17 ... so far as we can see, the only facts sufficiently well established to serve as a starting point are that anti-incest responses of some kind are universal among mankind. As to why these are universal, we are no nearer a solution than before. These are discouraging words indeed. "Anti-incest responses" help us no more than "an instinctive horror" of incest. But in the phrase "we are no nearer a solution [now] than before," we may find a clue to a way out of the dilemma. Perhaps these theorists have been on the wrong track. Science has found itself on the wrong track countless times during its relatively brief career so far. So many, in fact, that many of the important achievements of science consist, not in the discovery of some new fact or principle, but in erecting signs which read "Blind alley. Do not enter!" Phrenology was one of these blind alleys. But until it has been explored, how can one know whether a passage is a blind alley or a corridor leading to a new world? Once it has been found to be a blind alley, however, other scientists need not and should not waste their time exploring it again. Perhaps we are confronted by blind alleys in the various theories of incest and exogamy that we have just surveyed. Wissler's admission that "we are no nearer a solution [now] than before" would lead us to think so. Fortunately we are not in the situation of a mariner who has lost his bear- ings and who must try to recover his true course. We do not need to seek a 14 Goldenweiser, 1922, p. 242. 16 Idem., 1937, p. 303. s16 Young, 1942, p. 406.

The solution has already been found, and that long ago. Confusion in this field of ethnological theory has been due to circumstances such as we have just described. Theorists who have sought biological or psy- chological explanations of incest tabus have been on the wrong track; they have only led us into blind alleys. Those who have sought a culturological explanation have succeeded fully and well.1" The culturological point of view is younger and less widely known than the psychological or even the sociologi- cal. Although it was set forth simply and adequately by the great English anthropologist, E. B. Tylor, as early as 1871, in the first chapter of Primitive Culture-which was significantly enough entitled "The Science of Culture"- it has not become widely known or appreciated among social scientists, even among cultural anthropologists. There are some who recognize in the new science of culture only a mystical, fatalistic metaphysic that should be shunned like the Devil.19 So habituated to psychological interpretations are many stu- dents of human behavior that they are unable to rise to the level of culturo- logical interpretation. Thus, Goldenweiser looked to psychology for ethno- logical salvation:20 "It seems hardly fair to doubt that psychoanalysis will ultimately furnish a satisfactory psychological interpretation of this 'horror of incest'." Professor William F. Ogburn observes that: Incest taboos and marriage regulations may be quite fully described historically and culturally, yet there is something decidedly strange about incest and about marriage prohibitions. One's curiosity is not satisfied by the cultural facts."2' And even men like Lowie and Wissler, who have done excellent work along culturological lines in other areas, have relapsed to the psychological level when confronted with the problem of incest. Thus Lowie once declared that "it is not the function of the ethnologist but of the biologist and psychologist to explain why man has so deep-rooted a horror of incest."22 And Wissler is inclined to turn over all problems of cultural origins to the psychologist, leav- ing to the anthropologist the study of traits after they have been launched upon their cultural careers.23 The science of culture has, as we have already indicated, long ago given us 18 Cf. White, 1947b. 19 Cf. White, 1947a, especially pp. 189-205. 20 Goldenweiser, 1922, p. 242; and 1937, p. 303. 21 Ogburn, 1922, p. 175. What Professor Ogburn means apparently is that culturology cannot tell us all that we want to know about incest. This is true; psychology must be enlisted in the in- quiry also. But one must insist upon a sharp and clear distinction between the psychological problem and the culturological problem. Psychology cannot account for the origin or the form of the prohibitions; only culturology can do this. But for an understanding of the way the human primate organism behaves-thinks, feels, and acts-within, or with reference to, one of these cultural forms, we must go to psychology.

We find it set forth simply and succinctly in an essay by E. B. Tylor published in 1888: "On a Method of In- vestigating the Development of Institutions, Applied to the Laws of Marriage and Descent:"24 Exogamy, enabling a growing tribe to keep itself compact by constant unions be- tween its spreading clans, enables it to overmatch any number of smallfintermarrying groups, isolated and helpless. Again and again in the world's history, savage tribes must have had plainly before their minds the simple practical alternative between marrying- out and being killed out. (p. 267) The origin of incest tabus greatly antedates clan organization, but a sure clue to an understanding of incest prohibitions and exogamy is given by Tylor nevertheless: primitive people were confronted with a choice between "marry- ing-out and being killed out." The argument may be set forth as follows: Man, like all other animal species, is engaged in a struggle for existence. Cooperation, mutual aid, may become valuable means of carrying on this struggle at many points. A number of individuals working together can do many things more efficiently and effectively than the same individuals working singly. And a cooperative group can do certain things that lone individuals cannot do at all. Mutual aid makes life more secure for both individual and group. One might expect, therefore, that in the struggle for security and sur- vival every effort would be made to foster cooperation and to secure its bene- fits. Among the lower primates there is little cooperation. To be sure, in very simple operations one ape may coordinate his efforts with those of another. But their cooperation is limited and rudimentary because the means of com- munication are crude and limited; cooperation requires communication. Mon- keys and apes can communicate with one another by means of signs-vocal utterances or gestures-but the range of ideas that can be communicated in this way is very narrow indeed. Only articulate speech can make extensive and versatile exchange of ideas possible, and this is lacking among anthropoids. Such a simple form of cooperation as "you go around the house that way while I go around the other way, meeting you on the far side," is beyond the reach of the great apes. With the advent of articulate speech, however, the possibili- ties of communication became virtually unlimited. We can readily see its sig- nificance for social organization in general and for incest and exogamy in particular. One might get the impression from some psychologists, the Freudians es- pecially, perhaps, that the incestuous wish is itself instinctive, that somehow a person "just naturally" focuses his sexual desires upon a relative rather than upon a non-relative, and, among relatives, upon the closer rather than the 24 Tylor, 1888.</page><page sequence="9">424 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 remoter degrees of consanguinity. This view is quite as unwarranted as the theory of an "instinctive horror" of incest; an inclination toward sexual union with close relatives is no more instinctive than the social regulations devised to prevent it. A child has sexual hunger as well as food hunger. And he fixes his sex hunger upon certain individuals as he does his food hunger upon certain edible substances. He finds sexual satisfaction in persons close to him because they are close to him, not because they are his relatives. To be sure, they may be close to him because they are his relatives, but that is another matter. As a consequence of proximity and satisfaction the child fixates his sexual desires upon his immediate associates, his parents and his siblings, just as he fixates his food hungers upon familiar foods that have given satisfaction. He thus comes to have definite orientations and firm attachments in the realm of sex as in the field of nutrition. There is thus no mystery about incestuous desire; it is merely the formation and fixation of definite channels of experience and satisfaction. We find therefore, even in sub-human primate families, a strong inclina- tion toward inbreeding; one strives to obtain sexual satisfaction from a close associate. This tendency is carried over into human society. But here it is in- compatible with the cooperative way of life that articulate speech makes pos- sible. In the basic activities of subsistence, and defense against enemies, co- operation becomes important because life is made more secure thereby. Other factors being constant, the tribe that exploits most fully the possibilities of mutual aid will have the best chance to survive. In times of crisis, cooperation may become a matter of life or death. In providing food and maintaining an effective defense against foreign foes, cooperation becomes all-important. But would primordial man be obliged to construct a cooperative organiza- tion for subsistence and defense from the very beginning, or could he build upon a foundation already in existence? In the evolutionary process, whether it be social or biological, we almost always find the new growing out of, or based upon, the old. And such was the case here; the new cooperative or- ganization for food and defense was built upon a structure already present: the family. After all, virtually everyone belonged to one family or another, and the identification of the cooperative group with the sex-based family would mean that the benefits of mutual aid would be shared by all. When, therefore, certain species of anthropoids acquired articulate speech and became human beings, a new element, an economic factor, was introduced into an institution which had up to now rested solely upon sexual attraction between male and female. We are, of course, using the term economic in a rather broad sense here to include safety as well as subsistence. The human primate family had now become a corporation with nutritive and protective functions as well as sexual and in- cidentally reproductive functions. And life was made more secure as a con- sequence.</page><page sequence="10">WHITE] THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST 425 But a regime of cooperation confined to the members of a family would be correspondingly limited in its benefits. If cooperation is advantageous within family groups, why not between families as well? The problem was now to extend the scope of mutual aid. In the primate order, as we have seen, the social relationships between mates, parents and children, and among siblings antedates articulate speech and cooperation. They are strong as well as primary. And, just as the earliest cooperative group was built upon these social ties, so would a subsequent ex- tension of mutual aid have to reckon with them. At this point we run squarely against the tendency to mate with an intimate associate. Cooperation between families cannot be established if parent marries child; and brother, sister. A way must be found to overcome this centripetal tendency with a centrifugal force. This way was found in the definition and prohibition of incest. If persons were forbidden to marry their parents or siblings they would be compelled to marry into some other family group-or remain celibate, which is contrary to the nature of primates. The leap was taken; a way was found to unite fami- lies with one another, and social evolution as a human affair was launched upon its career. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of this step. Unless some way had been found to establish strong and enduring social ties between families, social evolution could have gone no further on the human level than among the anthropoids. With the definition and prohibition of incest, families became units in the cooperative process as well as individuals. Marriages came to be contracts first between families, later between even larger groups. The individual lost much of his initiative in courtship and choice of mates, for it was now a group affair. Among many primitive peoples a youth may not even be acquainted with his bride before marriage; in some cases he may not even have seen her. Children may be betrothed in childhood or infancy-or even before they are born. To be sure, there are tribes where one can become acquainted or even intimate with his spouse before marriage, but the group character of the con- tract is there nevertheless. And in our own society today a marriage is still an alliance between families to a very considerable extent. Many a man has ex- postulated, "But I am marrying her, not her family!" only to discover his lack of realism later. The widespread institutions of levirate and sororate are explainable by this theory also. In the levirate a man marries the wife or wives of his de- ceased brother. When a man customarily marries the unwed sister of his deceased wife the practice is called sororate. In both cases the group character of marriage is manifest. Each group of consanguinei supplies a member of the other group with a spouse. If the spouse dies, the relatives of the deceased must supply another to take his or her place. The alliance between families is important and must be continued; even death cannot part them.</page><page sequence="11">426 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 The equally widespread institutions of bride-price and dowry likewise find their significance in the prohibition of incest to establish cooperation be- tween family groups. The incest tabu necessitates marriage between family groups. But it cannot guarantee a continuation of the mutual aid arrangement thus established. This is where bride-price and dowry come in: they are de- vices for making permanent the marriage tie that the prohibition of incest has established. When a family or a group of relatives has received articles of value as bride-price or dowry, they distribute them as a rule among their various members. Should the marriage tie be broken or dissolved, they may have to return the wealth received at the time of the marriage. This is almost certain to be the case if it can be shown that the spouse whose relatives were the recip- ients of the bride-price or dowry was at fault. It very often happens that the relatives are reluctant to return the wealth if indeed they still have it. If it has already been consumed they will have to dig into their own pockets. It may already be earmarked for the marriage of one of their own group. In any event, the return of dowry or bride-price would be an inconvenience or a deprivation. Consequently they are likely to take a keen interest in the marriage and to try to prevent their own relative from doing anything to disrupt it. According to our theory the prohibition of incest has at bottom an economic motivation-not that primitive peoples were aware of this motive, however, for they were not. Rules of exogamy originated as crystallizations of processes of a social system rather than as products of individual psyches. Inbreeding was prohibited and marriage between groups was made compulsory in order to obtain the maximum benefits of cooperation. If this theory be sound, we should find marriage and the family in primitive society wearing a definite economic aspect. This is, in fact, precisely what we do find. Let us turn for summary statements to two leading authorities in social anthropology. Robert H. Lowie writes as follows:25 Marriage, as we cannot too often or too vehemently insist, is only to a limited extent based on sexual considerations. The primary motive, so far as the individual mates are concerned, is precisely the founding of a self-sufficient economic aggregate. A Kai [of New Guinea] does not marry because of desires he can readily gratify outside of wedlock without assuming any responsibilities; he marries because he needs a woman to make pots and to cook his meals, to manufacture nets and weed his plantations, in return for which he provides the household with game and fish and builds the dwelling. And A. R. Radcliffe-Brown makes similar observations concerning the aborigines of Australia:26 The important function of the familyis that it provides for the feeding and bringing up of the children. It is based on the cooperation of man and wife, the former providing the flesh food and the latter the vegetable food, so that quite apart from the question of 25 Lowie, 1920, pp. 65-66. 26 Radcliffe-Brown, 1930, p. 435.</page><page sequence="12">WHITE] THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST 427 children a man without a wife is in an unsatisfactory position since he has no one to supply him regularly with vegetable food, to provide his firewood and so on. This economic aspect of the family is a most important one . . . I believe that in the minds of the natives themselves this aspect of marriage, i.e., its relation to subsistence, is of greatly more importance than the fact that man and wife are sexual partners. Turning to the colonial period in America we find the economic character of the family equally pronounced. According to William F. Ogburn:27 In colonial times in America the family was a very important economic organiza- tion. Not infrequently it produced substantially all that it consumed, with the excep- tion of such things as metal tools, utensils, salt and certain luxuries. The home was, in short, a factory. Civilization was based on a domestic system of production of which the family was the center. The economic power of the family produced certain corresponding social conditions. In marrying, a man sought not only a mate and companion but a business partner. Husband and wife each had specialized skills and contributed definite services to the partnership. Children were regarded, as the laws of the time showed, not only as objects of affection but as productive agents. The age of marriage, the birth rate and the atti- tude toward divorce were all affected by the fact that the home was an economic insti- tution. Divorce or separation not only broke a personal relationship but a business one as well. And in our own society today, the economic basis of marriage and the family is made clear by suits for breach of promise and alienation of affections in which the law takes a very materialistic, even monetary, view of love and romance.28 Suits for non-support, alimony, property settlements upon divorce, the financial obligations between parents and children, and so on, exhibit further the economic function of the family. Marriage for many women today means a greater economic return for unskilled labor than could be obtained in any other occupation. It is interesting to note, in this connection, that Freud who, according to 27 Ogburn, 1933, pp. 661-662. We recall, also, Benjamin Franklin's account of his proposal to marry a girl providing her parents would give him "as much money with their daughter as would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house." He even suggested that they "mortgage their house in the loan-office" if they did not have the cash on hand. The parents, however, thought the printing business a poor risk and declined to give both money and girl. "Therefore," says Franklin, "I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up." (Franklin, 1940, p. 78.) 28 One court ruling observes that "the gist of the action for alienation of affections is the loss of consortium. 'This is a property right growing out of the marriage relation' ... " (Supreme Court of Connecticut, Case of Maggay vs. Nikitko, 1933), quoted in Turano, 1934b, p. 295. Another legal statement says that "the law generally takes the rather worldly view that marriage is a 'valuable' consideration; a thing not only possessing value, but one the value of which may be estimated in money, and therefore, in a sense, marriage engagements are regarded as business transactions, entered into with a view, in part, at least, to pecuniary advantage." (Ruling Case Law, Vol. 4, p. 143, quoted in Turano, 1934a, p. 40.)</page><page sequence="13">428 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 popular belief, "attributes everything to sex," nevertheless declares that "the motivating force of human society is fundamentally economic."29 The notion that marriage is an institution brought into being to provide individuals with a means of satisfying their sex hunger is naive and anthro- pocentric. Marriage does provide an avenue of sexual exercise and satisfaction, to be sure. But it was not sexual desire that produced the institution. Rather it was the exigencies of a social system that was striving to make full use of its resources for cooperative endeavor. Marriage, as an institution, finds its ex- planation in terms of socio-cultural process rather than individual psychology. In primitive society there was frequently ample means of sexual exercise out- side of wedlock. And in our own society the great extent of prostitution, the high incidence of venereal disease as an index of promiscuity, as well as other evidence,30 show that the exercise of sexual functions is not confined to one's own spouse by any means. As a matter of fact, marriage very often restricts the scope of one's sexual activity. Indeed, monogamy ideally considered is the next thing to celibacy. Nor is love the basis of marriage and the family, however fondly this notion may be cherished. No culture could afford to use such a fickle and ephemeral sentiment as love as the basis of an important institution. Love is here today but it may be gone tomorrow. But economic needs are with us always. Absence of love is not sufficient grounds for divorce. Indeed, one may despise and loathe, hate and fear one's mate and still be unable to obtain a divorce. At least one state in the Union will grant no divorce at all. And certain religious faiths take the same position. Marriage and the family are society's first and fundamental way of making provision for the economic needs of the individual. And it was the definition and prohibition of incest that initiated this whole course of social development. But to return to the definitions and prohibitions themselves. These vary, as we saw at the outset, from culture to culture. The variations are to be ex- plained in terms of the specific circumstances under which cooperation is to take place. One set of circumstances will require one definition of incest and one form of marriage; another set will require different customs. The habitat and the technological adjustment to it, the mode of subsistence, circumstances of defense and offense, division of labor between the sexes, and degree of cultural development, are factors which condition the definition of incest and the formulation of rules to prohibit it. No people known to modern science customarily permits marriage between parent and child. Brother-sister 29 Freud, 1920, p. 269. 30 , ... virginity at marriage will be close to the vanishing point for males born after 1930, and for females born after 1940.. intercourse with future spouse before marriage will become universal by 1950 or 1955." (Lewis M. Terman, Psychologic Factors in Marital Happiness, p. 323 [New York, 1938]), as quoted in Hohman and Schaffner, 1947, p. 502.</page><page sequence="14">WHIE] THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST 429 marriage has been restricted to the ruling families of a few advanced cultures, such as those of ancient Egypt, Hawaii, and the Inca of Peru. But this is not "royal incest,'" as Reo Fortune calls it,31 or "sanctioned incest" to use Kimball Young's phrase.32 Incest is by definition something criminal and prohibited. These marriages between siblings of royal families were not only not prohibited; they were required. They are examples of endogamy, as the prohibition of brother-sister marriages are examples of exogamy. Solidarity is a source of strength and effective action in society, as cooperation is a way of achieving security. And endogamy promotes solidarity as exogamy fosters size and strength of mutual aid groups. In view of the fact that a sure clue to the reason for the origin of prohibi- tions of incest was set forth by Tylor as early as 1888, it is rather remarkable that we should find anthropologists and sociologists today who juggle with "anti-incest responses" and who look to psychoanalysis for ultimate under- standing. As a matter of fact, we find the reasons for exogamy set forth by Saint Augustine in The City of God (Bk. XV), more than 1400 years before Tylor: For it is very reasonable and just that men, among whom concord is honorable and useful, should be bound together by various relationships, and that one man should not himself sustain many relationships, but that the various relationships should be dis- tributed among several, and should thus serve to bind together the greatest number in the same social interests. 'Father' and 'father-in-law' are the names of two relationships. When, therefore, a man has one person for his father, another for his father-in-law, friendship extends itself to a larger number. He comments upon the fact that Adam was both father and father-in-law to his sons and daughters: So too Eve his wife was both mother and mother-in-law to her children . .. while had there been two women, one the mother, the other the mother-in-law, the family affection would have had a wider field. Then the sister herself by becoming a wife sus- tained in her single person two relationships which, had they been distributed among individuals, one being sister, and another being wife, the family tie would have em- braced a greater number of persons. Saint Augustine does not, in these passages at least, make explicit the ad- vantages in security of life which would accrue to the group as a consequence of exogamy. But he makes it quite clear that community of social interest and "greater numbers of persons" in the group are the reasons for the prohibition of incest. 3' Fortune, 1932, p. 622. R. H. Lowie also speaks of brother-sister marriage in Hawaii and Peru as "incest" (Lowie, 1940, p. 233). J. S. Slotkin, too, in a recent article (Slotkin, 1947, p. 613) appears to identify incest with certain specific forms of inbreeding rather than with a kind of union that is defined and prohibited as a crime. 32 Young, 1942, p. 406.</page><page sequence="15">430 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 If an understanding of incest and exogamy is as old in social philosophy as Saint Augustine and as early in anthropological science as Tylor, why is it that the subject is still so obscure and so little understood among scholars today? We have already suggested the answer: a preference for psychological rather than culturological explanations. Anthropomorphism is an inveterate habit in human thought. To explain institutions in terms of psychology-of wish, desire, aversion, imagination, fear, etc.-has long been popular. Explana- tions of human behavior in terms of psychological determinants preceded therefore explanations in terms of cultural determinants. But culturological problems cannot be solved by psychology. Preoccupation with psychological explanations has not only kept many scholars from finding the answer; it has prevented them from recognizing the solution when it has been reached by the science of culture. The sociological explanation, such as Kimball Young's "social interaction," is no better. As a scientific explanation it is not only in- adequate; it is empty and meaningless. The sociologist's fixation upon "social interaction" keeps him, too, from appreciating a scientific interpretation of culture as a distinct class of phenomena." Even men who have made notable contributions to culturology, such as Kroeber, Lowie, and Wissler, have failed to see the significance of Tylor's early discussion of exogamy. The following incident is remarkable and revealing. A. L. Kroeber and T. T. Waterman re- printed Tylor's essay, "On the Method of Investigating the Development of Institutions," in their Source Book in Anthropology34 in 1920. But in a subse- quent edition,36 they cut the article down to conserve space, and omitted this highly significant passage! Important contributions to science are sometimes made "before their time," that is, before the general level of scientific advance has reached a point where widespread appreciation becomes possible. There was really very little that was novel in the work of Darwin; most if not all of the ideas and facts had been presented before. But the broad front of the cultural process of biologic thought had not advanced sufficiently prior to 1859 to make a general acceptance of this point of view possible. So it is with the problem of incest. An adequate ex- planation has been extant for decades. But, because the problem is a culturo- logical one, and because the science of culture is still so young and so few scholars even today are able to grasp and appreciate its nature and scope, an understanding of incest and its prohibitions is still very limited. As culturology develops and matures, however, this understanding as well as that of a host of other suprapsychological problems will become commonplace. We do not wish to minimize the extent of this understanding today. De- spite the ignorance and confusion of many scholars, there is a considerable number who do understand incest tabus. Thus Reo Fortune states that:"36 33 Cf. White, 1947a, pp. 186 ff. 34 Kroeber and Waterman, 1920, 1924. 3 Ibid., 1931. 36 Fortune, 1932, p. 620.</page><page sequence="16">WHITE] THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST 431 A separation of affinal relationship from consanguineous relationship assures a wider recognition of social obligation, . . . Any incestuous alliance between two persons within a single consanguineous group is in so far a withdrawal of their consanguineous group from the alliance and so endangers the group's survival. Malinowski, too, has illuminated the problem of incest tabus. Instead of emphasizing, however, the positive values that would accrue from alliances formed as a consequence of compulsory exogamy, he dwells upon the disrup- tion and discord that the unrestricted exercise of sexual appetites would in- troduce into a small group of relatives or close associates. He writes:37 The sexual impulse is in general a very upsetting and socially disruptive force, [it] cannot enter into a previously existing sentiment without producing a revolutionary change in it. Sexual interest is therefore incompatible with any family relationship, whether parental or between brothers and sisters . . . If erotic passion were allowed to invade the precincts of the home it would not merely establish jealousies and competi- tive elements and disorganize the family but it would also subvert the most fundamental bonds of kinship on which the further development of all social relations is based ... A society which allowed incest could not develop a stable family; it would therefore be deprived of the strongest foundations for kinship, and this in a primitive community would mean absence of social order. B. Z. Seligman expresses somewhat similar views-as well as others that are less discerning.38 A good statement on the nature and genesis of incest tabus is tucked away in a footnote in a recent monograph by John Gillin.s8a William I. Thomas sees clearly the reasons for prohibitions of incest: "The horror of incest is thus plainly of social derivation."39 And Freud, apart from his drama of patricide, comes close to an under- standing of incest tabus and exogamy. He says: The incest prohibition, had... a strong practical foundation. Sexual need does not unite men; it separates them... Thus there was nothing left for the brothers [after they had killed their father], if they wanted to live together, but to erect the incest pro- hibition.40 In another work he observes that:41 The observance of this [incest] barrier is above all a demand of cultural society, which must guard against the absorption by the family of those interests which it needs for the production of higher social units. Society, therefore, uses all means to loosen those family ties in every individual... The cultural function, if not the genesis, of incest tabus and of rules of exogamy seems to be very clearly seen and appreciated here. It is interesting to note, too, that Freud holds substantially the same view of the relationship 37 Malinowski, 1930, p. 630. See also, idem, 1929a, Vol. 13, p. 407. 38 Seligman, 1929, pp. 243-244, 247, 268-269. 38a Gillin, 1936, p. 93. 39 Thomas, 1937, p. 197. 40 Freud, 1931, pp. 250-251. 41 Idem., 1938, pp. 616-617.</page><page sequence="17">432 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 between restrictions upon sexual gratification and social evolution that has been set forth earlier in this essay. One of the principal themes of Civilization and Its Discontents" is "the extent to which civilization is built up on re- nunciation of instinctual gratifications. ... This 'cultural privation' domi- nates the whole field of social relations between human beings" (p. 63). He sees that "the first result of culture was that a larger number of human beings could live together in common" (p. 68); that "one of culture's principal en- deavors is to cement men and women together in larger units" (p. 72). Thus, although he proceeds from different premises, Freud comes to essentially the same conclusions as ours. There is, then, considerable understanding of incest and exogamy extant in the literature today. Yet, in a comparatively recent review of the whole problem a prominent anthropologist, John M. Cooper, has concluded that "the desire to multiply the social bonds [has] in all probability not been [an] important factor" in the origin of incest prohibitions.43 How far he is from an understanding of the problem is indicated by the two "chief factors" which he cites: "(a) sex callousness, resulting from early and intimate association... ; (b) the distinctly social purpose of preserving standards of sex decency within the family and kinship circle." The first factor is contrary to fact; intimacy fosters incest rather than callousness. The second explains nothing at all: what are standards of sex decency, why do they vary from tribe to tribe, and why is it necessary to preserve them? The culturological theory of incest receives support from a comparison of primitive cultures with our own. The crime of incest is punished with greater severity in primitive societies than in our own, as Reo Fortune44 has observed. Among the former the penalty of death is quite common; in our society punish- ment seldom exceeds ten years imprisonment and is often much less. The reason for this difference is not far to seek. In primitive societies, personal and kinship ties between individuals and families were more important than they are in highly developed cultures. The small mutual-aid group was a tre- mendously important social unit in the struggle for security. The very survival of the group depended to a considerable extent upon alliances formed by exogamy. In advanced cultures the situation is different. Society is no longer based upon kinship ties, but upon property relationships and territorial dis- tinctions. The political state has replaced the tribe and clan. Occupational groups and economic organization also become important bases of social life. The importance of exogamy is thus much diminished and the penalties for incest become less severe. It is not to be expected, however, that restrictions 42 Idem., 1930. 43 Cooper, 1932, p. 20. 44 Fortune, 1932, p. 620. Freud also remarks that "This dread of incest..,. seems to be even more active and stronger among primitive races living today than among the civilized." (Freud, 1931, p. 217)</page><page sequence="18">WHITE] THE DEFINITION AND PROHIBITION OF INCEST 433 upon inbreeding will ever be removed entirely. Kinship is still an important, though relatively less important, feature of our social organization and will probably remain so indefinitely. Rules of exogamy and endogamy will there- fore continue to be needed to regulate and order this aspect of our social life. In the various interpretations, both sound and unsound, of the definition and prohibition of incest we have a neat example of a contrast between psycho- logical explanations on the one hand and culturological explanations on the other. The problem simply does not yield to psychological solution. On the contrary, the evidence, both clinical and ethnographic, indicates that the desire to form sexual unions with an intimate associate is both powerful and wide- spread. Indeed, Freud opines that "the prohibition against incestuous object- choice [was] perhaps the most maiming wound ever inflicted..,. on the erotic life of man."45" Psychology discloses an "incestuous wish" therefore, not a motive for its prevention. The problem yields very readily, however, to culturological interpretation. Man, as an animal species, lives in groups as well as individu- ally. Relationships between individuals in the human species are determined by the culture of the group-that is, by the ideas, sentiments, tools, techniques, and behavior patterns, that are dependent upon the use of symbols"46 and which are handed down from one generation to another by means of this same faculty. These culture traits constitute a continuum, a stream of interacting elements. In this interacting process, new combinations and syntheses are formed, some traits become obsolete and drop out of the stream, some new ones enter it. The stream of culture thus flows, changes, grows and develops in accordance with laws of its own. Human behavior is but the reactions of the organism man to this stream of culture. Human behavior-in the mass, or of a typical member of a group-is therefore culturally determined. A people has an aversion to drinking cow's milk, avoids mothers-in-law, believes that exercise promotes health, practices divination or vaccination, eats roasted worms or grasshoppers, etc., because their culture contairis trait-stimuli that evoke such responses. These traits cannot be accounted for psychologically. And so it is with the definition and prohibition of incest. From psychology we learn that the human animal tends to unite sexually with someone close to him. The institution of exogamy is not only not explained by citing this tendency; it is contrary to it. But when we turn to the cultures that determine the relations between members of a group and regulate their social intercourse we readily find the reason for the definition of incepst and the origin of exogamy. The struggle for existence is as vigorous in the human species as elsewhere. Life is made more secure, for group as well as individual, by cooperation. Articulate speech makes cooperation possible, extensive, and varied in human society. Incest was defined and exogamous rules were formulated in order to SFreud, 1930, p. 74. 46 Cf. White, 1940.</page><page sequence="19">434 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 make cooperation compulsory and extensive, to the end that life be made more secure. These institutions were created by social systems, not by neuro- sensory-muscular-glandular systems. They were syntheses of culture elements formed within the interactive stream of culture traits. Variations of definition and prohibition of incest are due to the great variety of situations. In one situa- tion, in one organization of culture traits-technological, social, philosophic, etc.-we will find one type of definition of incest and one set of rules of exog- amy; in a different situation we find another definition and other rules. Incest and exogamy are thus defined in terms of the mode of life of a people-by the mode of subsistence, the means and circumstances of offense and defense, the means of communication and transportation, customs of residence, knowledge, techniques of thought, etc. And the mode of life, in all its aspects, technological sociological, and philosophical, is culturally determined.
