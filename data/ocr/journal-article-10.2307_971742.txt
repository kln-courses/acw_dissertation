<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spouted vessels are diagnostic forms of Middle Preclassic (1000-400 B.C.) and Late Preclassic (400 B.C.-A.D. 250) Maya ceramic assemblages. Mayanists have traditionally called these vessels "chocolate pots," but until recently there has been lit- tle direct evidence to support this interpretation. In fact, few studies have focused on the role these specializedforms played in the daily social and ritual activities of the ancient Maya. This paper provides a contextual and functional analysis of Preclas- sic spouted vessels found across the Maya lowlands and highlands. Additionally, the results of chemical analyses on residues collected from spouted vessels found in Middle and Late Preclassic burials at Colha, Belize are provided. Preliminary data reveal that some of the vessels from Colha contained substantial amounts of theobromine, a distinct markerfor cacao or choco- late. The significance of the discovery of chocolate in Maya spouted vessels is discussed as well as its implications for the rest of Mesoamerica. Las vasijas con vertedera son una forma diagnostica de la cera'mica maya del Precla'sico Medio (1000-400 a. C.) y del Preclasico Tardio (400 a. C.-250 d. C.). Tradicionalmente los arqueologos han denominado a estas vasijas "jarras de chocolate ", pero hasta ahora no se contaba con evidencias directas para apoyar esta interpretacion. De hecho, pocos estudios se han enfocado en el papel que estas formas especializadas tuvieron en actividades sociales y rituales cotidianas entre los mayas. Esta investigacion of rece una analisis contextual y funcional de piezas completas con vertedera del Preclasico en diferentes sitios del altiplano y de las tierras bajas mayas. Adema's, se incluyen los resultados de los ana'lisis quimicos de residuos de vasijas de esta clase encon- tradas en entierros del Preclasico en Colha, Belice. Para esta ultima coleccion, los resultados preliminares indican que algunas p iezas con ten ian can tidades conside rables de teob romina, un ma rcado r ca racte ristico del cacao o chocolate. En este articu lo se discute la relevancia de la identificacion positiva de chocolate en las vasijas con vertedera mayas asicomo sus implicaciones para Mesoame'rica. Terry G.

Geographically, spouted vessels were widely dis- tributed in the New World from northern Mesoamer- ica to Lower Central America. Temporally, such vessels occur from the Preclassic or Formative to historic and modern times (Ford 1969; Powis 2000; Wauchope 1950). They first appear in Mesoamer- ica during the early Middle Preclassic period (1000400 B.C.) in both the southeast Mayaperiph- ery and the Maya lowlands and highlands. They become more widespread in the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic periods (400 B.C.-A.D. 250), extend- ing into the central depression of Chiapas, central Veracruz, the Valley of Oaxaca, and Central Mex- ico. The vessel form decreases significantly through- out the Classic and Postclassic periods in the Maya area, but gains in popularity with the Tarascans and Huastecs. The purpose of this paper is to provide informa- tion on the distribution of spouted vessels in both space and time across the Maya area and to discuss their function using contextual data from a number of lowland and highland sites. Samples of dry residue collected from the interior surfaces of spouted ves- sels at the Maya site of Colha, Belize were also ana- lyzed to determine what content(s) these vessels actually held. The preliminary results confirm the existence of liquid chocolate or cacao (theobromine) in a few spouted vessels allowing for a number of functional interpretations to be made. 85 SPOUTED VESSELS AND CACAO USE AMONG 1HE PRECLASSIC MAYA Terry G. Powis, Fred Valdez, Jr., Thomas R. Hester, W. Jeffrey Hurst, and Stanley M. Tarka, Jr.</page><page sequence="2">86 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002] Form and Style Compared to the occurrence of other vessel forms (e.g., plates, dishes, vases) in Preclassic Maya ceramic assemblages, spouted vessels are a rare but diagnos- tic form of the period. In appearance, spouted ves- sels have both a central orifice and an open-ended, tubular spout that is placed in a fashion that is very similar to those on a kettle or teapot. Jars and bowls are often the shapes that generally exhibit these hol- low tubular spouts. The open-end of the spout can be either oval or round in cross-section. In many exam- ples, the height of the spout is equal to the height of the rim of the vessel. Spouts are typically vertical in direction; however, there are exceptions with speci- mens having their spouts either slanting inward toward the vessel wall or angled outward from it. The spouts may either be bridged to or supported by the main body of the vessel. If bridged, the spout is con- nected by a short solid bar to the rim of the vessel. Spouted jars and bowls typically have a single spout, but double spouts do occur. Lip-to-lip strap handles for carrying purposes and/or pouring liquid contents out of the spout are also present. In rare examples, lids have been found covering the main vessel orifice (Gann and Gann 1939:24; McAnany et al.1999: 138; Powis and Hohmann 1995:53). They can also be either plain in design or highly decorated with anthro- pomorphic, zoomorphic, naturalistic cacao pod or squash-like shapes, and Usulutan-style designs. Across Mesoamerica during the Early, Middle, and Late Preclassic periods there are a number of forms that are related to, but distinct from, Maya spouted vessels, including the straight-necked bot- tle, stirrup-spout bottle, and the bridge-spout bottle (Ford 1969:117-123, Chart 16). Spouted jars and bowls, designated as teapot vessels by Ford (1969: 122-123), are differentiated from these other forms because the spout is located off-center, as opposed to a bottle, in which the spout is found on the central axis of the vessel. Bottles originated in northern South America (e.g., coastal Ecuador) around 2000-1500 B.C. and remained common forms for nearly three millennia. By Middle Pre- classic times, bottles of various shapes and sizes were being found from Lower Central America to the Basin of Mexico (Baudez and Becquelin 1975; Coe and Flannery 1967; Ford 1969; Grove 1970, 1982; Healy 1974; Kelly 1974; MacNeish et al.1970; Porter 1953; Snarskis 1981; Tolstoy and Paradis 1970). Although tlley became a standardized form in many cultures across Mesoamerica during this time, their occurrence in lowland Maya sites is rare (Awe 1992:232; Valdez 1987:64, 74); however, a total of six orangeware stirrup-spout fragments have been found at the site of Blackman Eddy, Belize (Kat Brown, personal communication, 2001). Around 1000400 B.C. spouted vessels first appear in south- eastern Mesoamerica at Playa de los Muertos, Puerto Escondido, Los Naranjos, and Las Honduritas, all in Honduras (Beaudry-Corbett and Henderson 1993; Henderson and Joyce 2001:14; Joyce and Hender- son 2001), and at Chalchuapain El Salvador (Sharer 1978). They may have either been derived from ear- lier necked bottle forms or they may have been a localized development in that it was clearly associ- ated with a specific function. According to Hender- son and Joyce (2001:14), spouted vessels in several Honduran sites may have been used for chocolate processing at this early time. In the Maya lowlands, spouted vessels are roughly coeval in date with those being produced in various parts of southeastern Mesoamerica. Although it appears, based on available data, that the earliest examples of spouted vessels come from the cultural frontier between Mesoamerica and Lower Central America, it is not known whether the lowland Maya adopted this specialized form from any of the groups living in that region or developed it independently. Evidence from a number of low- land Maya sites (e.g., Blackman Eddy, Cahal Pech, Colha, Cuello, Tikal) indicates that spouted vessels were being produced as early as 1000 B.C., but it is unclear whether similar forms identified further to the south are contemporaneous or predate the low- land examples. Clearly, more research is needed to determine the currents of influence radiating from these culture areas. Temporal and Spatial Distribution Spouted vessels have a broad temporal and spatial distribution across Mesoamerica. Figures 1 and 2 provide a general overview of their distribution in both the Middle and Late Preclassic periods, respec- tively. Furthermore, given their range of variation in several geographically diverse regions of Mesoamer- ica, a description of their form, style, and context is presented inTable 1. Additionally, specific examples from the different regions of the Maya area are briefly commented upon and illustrated below. They are</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 87 Figure 1.

Maya spouted vessels are found in both the north- ern and southern lowlands. Across theYucatan Penin- sula, a number of sites, including caves, have produced both intact vessels and spout fragments. The majority of spouted vessels in this region are monochrome redwares dating to the Middle and Late Preclassic periods. The highest frequency of spouted vessels occurs in northern Belize, the Upper Belize River Valley, and the Department of Peten, Guatemala. In these regions, spouted vessels are vew popular throughout the Middle and Late Preclassic. They are typically recovered from burials, but are occasionally found in domestic middens and chul- tuns. Spouted jars and bowls are rarely associated with caches in these areas. Northern Belize sites, like Colha and Cuello, have reported the highest numbers of spouted vessels. Intact specimens are generally found in burials. In addition to these two sites, spouted jars have been recovered from a number of primary contexts at Lamanai, including a Late Preclassic burial in Struc- ture P8-9 (Figures 3a) and a Protoclassic midden in a chultun (Feature P8-2) (Figure 3b). The Upper Belize RiverValley region, like north- ern Belize, has produced a number of spouted ves- sels in Preclassic deposits but, to date, most of the recovered remains consist of broken tubular and oval- shaped spouts. The Belize Valley has recently been subject to intensive studies of early Maya occupa- tion (Awe 1992; Brown and Garber 2000; Cheetham 1998; Garber 1998,1999; Garber and Brown 2000; Healy 1999; Healy andAwe 1995,1996), and exca- vations have revealed dozens of spout fragments in architectural contexts dating almost exclusively to the Middle Preclassic period. At present, no spouts have been recovered that predate 800 B.C. Sometime dur- ing the early part of the Late Preclassic (ca. 100 B.C.), spouted vessels ceased to be produced in the BelizeValley (Powis 2000:8; Willey et al.1965:337). The presence of Middle Preclassic spouted ves- sels in caves in the Belize Valley is a rare occurrence. Extensive survey and excavation of caves in the Roar-</page><page sequence="4">88 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002] Figure 2. Map of selected Late Preclassic Maya and non-Maya sites with spouted vessels. ing Creek and Macal Valleys have yielded no frag- ments of this vessel form (Jaime Awe, personal com- munication, 2000). Although there is evidence of activity in the Late Preclassic period in the caves of this region, it is limited in terms of numbers of caves (e.g., Actun Chapat, Chechem Ha) and intensity of usage. The absence of spouted vessels in caves at this time follows the pattern observed at surface sites across the Belize Valley. In the Peten, few Middle and Late Preclassic intact examples have been recovered from special deposits. For example, only four intact specimens have been excavated at Tikal. Although they are considered rare at the site (Culbert 1993:Figure 119; Gifford 1976:127), three were recovered from Cauac com- plex (1 B.C.-A.D. 250) bunals and one from an early Eb Complex (800-60 B.C.) burial. One of these Cauac vessels, a nubbin-footed, spouted ei1gy jar with an Usulutan-style body, was found in a Proto- classic tomb (Burial 85) in Structure SD-Sub-1-lst (Figure 4a) (W. Coe 1965:20; Coggins 1975:79-83). To the south, broken spouts are generally found in mixed deposits (e.g., construction fill) at most sites in the Guatemalan highlands. However, they are fewer in number, especially during the Protoclassic (50 B.C.-A.D. 250) period (Rands and Smith 1965:1 19). Comparative Data from Across Mesoamerica Elsewhere in Mesoamerica there are Preclassic period spouted jars and bowls from sites in Lower Central America (Costa Rica), the southeast Maya periphery (Honduras, El Salvador), the central depression of Chiapas, the Valley of Oaxaca, south- ern and central Veracruz, and Central Mexico. In Honduras, a number of sites have yielded spouted jars and bowls dating to both the Middle and Late Preclassic periods. Between 100s700 B.C., the sites of Playa de los Muertos and Puerto Escondido in the Ulua Valley, Los Naranjos on Lake Yojoa, and Las Honduritas on the Rio Cataguana have produced both spout and bridge-spout vessels with "trumpet- shaped" necks in red, red-and-grooved, red-on-white, and white slips (Beaudry-Corbett and Henderson 1993; Henderson and Joyce 2001:14).</page><page sequence="5">Country/Site C Middle Preclassic Belize Altun Ha 2 Barton Ramie 1 Blackman Eddy 2 Blue Creek 1 Cahal Pech 1 Colha 1 Cuello 1 Pacbitun 7 El Salvador Chalchuapa 3 Guatemala Lakes Yaxha-Sacnab 1 Los Mangales 1 Nakbe Seibal Tikal 1 Honduras Cuyamel Caves Las Honduritas Los Naranjos Playa de 1QS Muertos Puerto Escondido Central Mexico Tehuacan Valley Yucatan, Mexico Actun Pech 1 Becan 1 Dzibilchaltun 3 Ek Balam 1 7+ + Kiuic 1 Table 1.

Illustration courtesy of Joyce Marcus. In the central depression of Chiapas a number of sites have been reported with spouted vessels dating to the Late Preclassic period. Vessel forms in this area generally consist of bridge-spout jars with anthropo- morphic faces incised on the neck portion of the ves- sel. These bridge-spout vessels are overwhelmingly found in caches in this region. For example, at the site of Chiapa de Corzo Horcones phase (A.D.1-100) Cache 5-6, located in Mound 5, contained five bridge- spout jars, four of which exhibited anthropomorphic faces on the neck (Figure 4b) (Lowe 1962:24). In the Valley of Oaxaca, a number of Late For- mative (ca.200 B.C.-A.D.200) sites have produced spouted vessels. They are generally bridge-spout pots placed in elite burials. For example, at Tomaltepec, there is a Monte Alban I tomb equipped with 37 pot- tery vessels, nearly half of them elegant jars whose neck and spout were connected by a bridge. Several of them are human effigies, including one with a seated figure wearing a macaw mask (Marcus and Flannery 1996: 169-170). AtAbasolo, Burials Sa and Sb, representing an elite marital pair, were accom- panied by 21 MonteAlban Ic pottery vessels of which six were human effigy bridge-spout jars (Figure 5) (Marcus and Flannery 1996:171; see also Caso and Bernal 1965:873, 878, 880-885). Human effigy bndge-spout jars of Oaxaca gray- ware have been found in Tomb 7 at Chiapa de Corzo. This elite tomb at Chiapa de Corzo, dating to the first or second century B.C., contained 35 vessels all of which were imported from elsewhere, including the Oaxaca graywares. The bridge-spout vessels in Tomb 7 are remarkably similar to those recovered from Burials Sa and 5b at Abasolo and others from Monte Alban, San Jose Mogote, and Tomaltepec (Marcus andFlannery 1996:192-193).Bridge-spoutjarshave been recovered from one of the most famous Zapotec royal burials, Tomb 104 at Monte Alban, dated to Period III (Figure 6). They were placed alongside other pottery forms that Marcus and Flannery (1996:214) called a "complete table setting" for a Zapotec lady or lord, including bowls, vases, jars, ladles, and sauce boats. At San Jose Mogote, a fine gray bridge-spout jar was found in Tomb 4 dating to the Monte Alban Period IIIa (Marcus and Flannery 1996:230). Function and Use Having provided an overview of the spatial and tem- poral distribution of spouted vessels across the Maya region and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, we would like to briefly discuss their function and use in Pre-</page><page sequence="10">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002] 94 t \ l &lt; - - / vr w ) *- -- *R v - - 7 Figure 6.

Only whole spouted vessels recovered from primary contexts are used in this study. In the past, few attempts have been made by researchers to identify what function spouted ves- sels served in Preclassic Maya society. From a func- tional point of view, we believe they are specialized serving vessels that belong to a production or con- sumption complex. However, what can be said about their specific function in Preclassic Maya society? Given the steep vertical angle and the overall height of the spout relative to the rim it would have been difficult, especially for bridge-spout vessels, to pour liquids from their spout into another container with- out spilling some of the contents out of the main ves- sel orifice. The only exception(s) to this would be if there was a tall restricted neck on the vessel and/or the level of the liquid contained within was kept below the neck/shoulder break. Clearly, some exam- ples, like that in Figure 7a from Colha, Belize would have had no problem in pouring liquids, while oth- ers, like that in Figure 7b from Santa Rita Corozal, Belize would not have poured at all. If spouted vessels were not only used for pour- ing liquids, what other possible functions could they have performed? Thompson (1939:82) stated that they may have been used as drums at San Jose, Belize. Some may have served symbolic purposes at Late Preclassic sites in the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico (MacNeish et al. 1970: 154). At Dzibilchal- tun in the Yucatan Peninsula, children were buried inside Middle Preclassic spouted jars (Andrews and Andrews 1980:3940). It has recently been sug- gested by McAnany et al. (1999: 138) that the spouts of these vessels acted as an orifice for the introduc- tion of air into the body, which would have aided the frothing of liquid chocolate (Theobroma cacao) before consumption. If their statement is correct, then spouted vessels would have also been used to prepare beverages before serving them. In Classic Maya times, tall cylindrical vases and bowls were used by elite members of society to pre- pare, store, and pour chocolate drinks (Figure 8a). The process of frothing chocolate, as pictorially rep- resented on ceramic vessels, was by pounng the liq- uid from one vessel into another to raise the foam, which was considered the most desirable part of the drink, not only by the Maya, but by the Aztecs as well (Figure 8b) (Coe and Coe 1996:50).

Colonial times, Yucatec Maya spoke of yom cacao, meaning "chocolate foam." They also spoke of t'oh haa, haa being a word for chocolate as well as water, t'oh meaning to pour from one vessel into another from a height just as Figure 8a shows a Classic period woman pouring a chocolate drink (Coe and Coe 1996:50). In the Early and Late Classic periods, there is glyphic evidence found on many vessels that clearly demonstrates chocolate was being prepared as frothy beverages and that elite individuals had exclusive access to them.

MacLeod (1990) has nicknamed this glyph compound as "the recipe" or the actual contents of the vessel (see also MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994). While Classic- period vessels have epigraphic evidence to indicate their contents, there is no such information for Pre- classic vessels, including the spouted vessels under consideration here. Spouted vessels have been referred to many times in print as "chocolate pots," and the implication is that all jars and bowls with spouts functioned as ves- sels related to chocolate production and consump- tion (Brady et al.1998:22; Chase and Chase 1987:51, 53; Gann 1918:77; Gann and Gann 1939:25; Ham- mond 1977:47; Kosakowsky 1987:57,85; Powis and Hohmann 1995:53; Thompson 1939:221; Valdez 1987:237-238). Without any supporting contextual, residual, phytolith, or iconographic analyses to either confirm or deny this for these Preclassic vessels, it is difficult to understand how this phrase "chocolate pot" has become so embedded in the literature. Where did Maya archaeologists get the notion that Preclassic Maya spouted vessels were used for chocolate drinks? Specifically, why have Mayanists used spouted vessels synonymously with the phrase "chocolate pots"? One of the earliest uses of the expression comes fromThomas Gann's 1918 report on "The Maya Indians of Southern Yucatan and Northern British Honduras." He found a few spouted vessels in Late Preclassic/Protoclassic burials at the site of Santa Rita Corozal and used the term "choco- late pot" to refer to these spouted vessels. His use of the name may stem from the likeness of the Preclassic Maya spouted pots to European teapots or hot choco- late pots. There is a strong resemblance between the two forms, and we believe that this is how the term became part of the literature in Maya archaeology. Archaeologists working in other parts of Mesoamer- ica do not refer to them as chocolate pots, but sim- ply as spouted vessels, thereby leaving the functional interpretation open. There are no ethnographic data from either the highlands or theYucatan Peninsula to support the idea that spouted vessels were used for chocolate drinks. In fact, spouted vessels or pichingas, as they are called by modern Maya groups living in highland Guatemala, are used as water bottles (Figure 9) (Reina and Hill 1978:25). In the town of Merida, Yucatan spouted jars also occur, but the modern Figure 9. A pichinga, similar in form to Preclassic Maya spouted jars, is used by modern Maya groups living in high- land Guatemala as a water bottle (after Reina and Hill 1978:Figure 2). Illustration courtesy of Robert M. Hill and Ruben E. Reina. Maya use them as water containers or coolers (Thompson 1974: 127). Spouted vessels made of metal are also found, but these too are similarly used to hold and pour water. Today, indigenous groups across Mesoamerica use small, open bowls or jicaras (Spanish for xicalli), made of either clay or gourd, to drink chocolate in both private and public ritual ceremonies (Thomp- son 1958: 151-159; Tozzer 1941 :9&gt;92). Generally, they use a grooved wooden beater or swizzle stick (called a molinillo in Spanish) for the production of the much-prized foam. The use of the molinillo was probably introduced by the Europeans. Spanish doc- uments do not mention the method of pouring liq- uid chocolate from one vessel to another to produce the coveted foam on the drink, which appears to be a unique Mesoamerican practice prior to the conquest (Coe and Coe 1996:88). In summary, Mayanists have dubbed Preclassic spouted vessels as "chocolate pots" for nearly a cen- tury without conducting any scientific inquiry into their use in early Maya society. However, within the past decade there has been substantial documenta- tion, through residue and epigraphic analyses, indi- cating that from Early Classic through Colonial times</page><page sequence="13">Table 2.

Can we state with any degree of certainty that open bowls and tall cylindrical vases were also used to pro- duce and consume chocolate during the Preclassic? What evidence exists to suggest the Maya were drinking frothy cacao? If the Preclassic Maya had knowledge of chocolate production, how were they making it? What type of vessel(s) were used in this process? And who was drinking it-elites and/or commoners? These questions, among others, led Powis and Hurst to conduct residue analyses on Pre- classic spouted vessels to determine what contents they contained. Dry Residue Analysis In order to clarify what these vessels actually con- tained in Preclassic times, Powis sampled the inte- rior surfaces of 14 whole spouted vessels from the Maya site of Colha, located in northern Belize (Table 2). The Belize Department of Archaeology granted permission to sample the Colha vessels, which are presently stored at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin. All of the vessels are derived from Middle and Late Pre- classic burial contexts in Operations 2012 and 2031 at the site (see Valdez 1987: 101-129). A total of 11 vessels came from the 2012 structure, a stepped pyramid and platform located on the western edge of Colha's ceremonial center (Potter 1980, 1982; Potter et al.1984; Sullivan 1991) . All of the spouted vessels from Operation 2012 are slipped either red or black. In addition to their monochrome color, they are also modified with either incising, fluting, or indentations. Several of the specimens have lip- to-lip strap handles as well. The remaining three spouted vessels were found in Operation 2031, which was located in the southwest portion of the Main Plaza, the largest enclosed plaza within the cer- emonial center of Colha (Anthony 1987; Anthony and Black 1994). Each of the three vessels was red slipped and only one of them exhibited pre-slip incised decoration. No residues were visible on the interior surfaces of these vessels. As a result, the interior surface of each vessel was lightly scraped to remove any sub- stance(s) that may have permeated the vessel wall. A small sample of clay material (ranging from 1-7 grams) was collected from each vessel and sent to W. Jeffrey Hurst and Stanley M. Tarka of the Her- shey Foods Technical Center at Hersheys Foods Cor- poration in Pennsylvania. Briefly stated, the Colha samples were analyzed by High-Performance Liq- uid Chromatography coupled to Atmospheric Pres- sure Mass-Spectrometry (HPLC-APMS) (Hurst 2001). The studies that were conducted centered on the determination of theobromine. Research has indi- cated that cocoa is the only Mesoamerican plant con- taining theobromine, and this compound was chosen as the unique marker for the presence of cocoa (Hall et al.1990: 141 ; Hurst 2001: 1 ; Hurst et al.1989:281). The results provide conclusive evidence that two vessels (Vessels 12 and 13) contained significant amounts of theobromine and a third (Vessel 14) con- tained minor amounts of this compound (Hurst 2001:1). Both of the spouted vessels that held sub-</page><page sequence="14">98 LATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002] O 1 2 3 4 cllk O 1 2 3 4 cls a b Figure 10.

Ves- sel 12, a blackware spouted jar, was found in burial Strat 67, located below Floor 7 in Operation 2012 (Figure 10a). The vessel has a short spout, short neck, and a lip-to-lip strap handle that is actually two twisted coils of clay (Valdez 1987:Figure 22a, b). It has a height of 12.5 cm and a rim diameter of 6.0 cm. Decoration consists of fluting on the vessel shoulder, which resembles squash-like indentations. Vessel 13, also a blackware spouted jar, was found in burial Strat 61 in Operation 2012 (FigurelOb). The vessel has a tall neck with a long, vertical spout, and a lip-to-lip strap handle. It measures 20.0 cm in height and has a rim diameter of 10.5 cm. Decora- tion consists of squash-like indentations across the vessel shoulder as well as a thin red stucco coat that was added to the exterior surface after firing (Valdez 1987:Figure 22c). The third vessel (Vessel 14) that contained minor amounts of theobromine was also excavated from Operation 2012. This redware spoutedjarwas found in Burial 1 and is dated to the Late Preclassic (400 B.C.-A.D. 250) period (see Figure 7a). Decoration consists of alternating bands of incised lines and lin- ear punctations that encircle the neck and shoulder of the vessel (Valdez 1987:Figure 27a). At present, there are no measurements for this vessel because it has not been fully reconstructed. Discussion After nearly a century of having no foundation to use the term "chocolate pots," Mayanists now have Erm evidence that some Preclassic Maya spouted vessels did indeed contain cacao. Of particular importance is the early date of cacao consumption by the low- land Maya, dating to the late Middle Preclassic (60(H00 B.C.) period. The presence of cacao at Colha predates our knowledge of its use at Rio Azul by nearly a millennia. The significance of this infor- mation is that it suggests the Maya had a long, con- tinuous history of preparing and consuming liquid</page><page sequence="15">REPORTS 99 chocolate from the Middle Preclassic to historic and modern times. Although we have strong evidence of cacao residue in some spouted vessels at Colha it does not indicate that every spouted vessel recovered from this site or any other lowland site was used specifically for this purpose. In fact, spouted vessels may have served several functions in Preclassic Maya society, one of which was to prepare, contain, and pour liq- uid chocolate. It should also be acknowledged that the three spouted vessels that tested positive for cacao at Colha came from burial contexts, as did the ves- sels from RioAzul (Hall et al.1990: 142). At present, we do not know what other contexts, either domes- tic or ritual, cacao may have been used for by the Middle and Late Preclassic Maya. The problem cen- ters on the lack of whole vessels being recovered from primary contexts (i.e., middens) other than spe- cial deposits like burials. Some comments on the nature of cacao prepara- tion within early Maya society can be obtained from a study of Classic period inscriptions on ceramics and monuments as well as from historic documents and ethnographic accounts (M. Coe 1973; S. Coe 1990; Coe and Coe 1996; Dakin and Wichmann 2000; Gasco 1987; Hall et al. 1990; Houston et al. 1989; Houston and Taube 1987; MacLeod 1990; McAnany et al. 2001; Millon 1955; Popenoe 1919; Reents-Budet 1994; Stuart 1988; Tedlock 1985; Thompson 1956). In particular, early colonial doc- uments mention the importance of cacao as a luxury drink, trade item, tribute item, and currency. During this time, chocolate was eaten and drunk with most meals and was always mixed with some other sub- stance (e.g., water, maize, chili, honey, achiote) and in different proportions to produce a variety of foods (e.g., atolli, posolli) and drinks (e.g., balche, batildo). This was also probably the case in Preclassic times, although testing for these other substances has not yet been performed on the Colha samples. However, phytolith remains have been recovered from a spouted vessel in a Protoclassic tomb (Tomb 5), located in the northeast periphery of Blue Creek, Belize. A preliminary analysis of the phytolith remains is being conducted by Steve Bozarth of the University of Kansas. Although his analysis is ongo- ing, Bozarth (personal communication, 2001) has noted that there is a culturally elevated frequency of polyhedra, stomata, and branching spirally thick- ened tracheids indicating that leaves from at least one arboreal species were placed in this vessel as part of an offering. He also recovered one unclassified fruit phytolith. This information from Blue Creek, cou- pled with the results of the residue analysis from Colha, suggests that the Preclassic Maya may have been preparing beverages with either pure chocolate or with a combination of chocolate, vegetal matter, and fruit. With regard to spouted vessels and cacao use, a number of questions arise about why the Maya abruptly switched to cylindrical vases and bowls in the Early Classic period. It is interesting to note that just before their decline in the first centuries A.D., there was an explosion of new varieties of spouted vessels being produced at Maya sites (e.g., Chan Chich, Colha, K'axob, and Lamanai), including the increased use of effigies, the number of slips applied, the addition of bridge supports, and ring bases (see Figure3b). Why, after nearly a millennia of popu- larity, did spouted jars radically decrease in use around the Maya area, especially since they were integral to the preparation and consumption of cacao? Was it connected to Teotihuacan's influence on the Classic period Maya? We know trade between Teoti- huacan and the Maya was occurring (Ball 1983; Bove 1991; W. Coe 1972; Coggins 1983; Sanders and Michels 1977;SandersandPrice 1968;Stuart2000). There is ceramic evidence of chocolate drinking at Teotihuacan from a carved vase fragment showing a hunting scene with a quetzal bird in a cacao tree (Figure 11); this same fragmenthas nubbins, shaped like cacao beans, attached to the bottom exterior edges (Coe and Coe 1996:54). Teotihuacan may have controlled the rich cacao-growing orchards on the Pacific Coast (Soconusco region) dunng the Early Classic. Given this information, is it possible that tall cylindrical tripods, so popular at Teotihuacan, replaced spouted jars for cacao drinking in the Early Classic period? Could the Teotihuacanos have intro- duced an alternative method of cacao preparation, by pouring the liquid from one vessel into another from a height, to the Classic Maya? If so, this might have made the spouted vessel less popular or even obsolete. We are not implying that the Classic Maya could only have learned this particular technique from Teotihuacan, but it is interesting to note that this practice, as pictorially represented on Maya ceram- ics, is roughly coeval in time with contact/commu- nication with highland Mexico. Therefore, it may be a possibility that the Teoti-</page><page sequence="16">100 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 13, No. 1, 2002] Figure 11. A young blowgunner hunts quetzal birds in a cacao tree, on an Early Classic (ca. A.D. 500) carved vase fragment from Teotihuacan, central Mexico (after Coe and Coe 1996:54). From Codex Tudela, Museo de America, Madrid. huacan-style tripod cylindrical vase, introduced from highland Mexico, came to the Maya with the intro- duction of a new method for preparing liquid cacao. In his discussion of known apparent ceramic homolo- gies between the Maya and highland Mexico, Ball (1983:136) stated that: either aesthetic considerations or a desire to emulate a particular vessel form associated with a foreign social system and so connoting high status might have motivated such copying. Consideration should also be given to the possi- bility that lidded tripod cylinders might have represented specialized commodity containers. Some possible association with the transport, presentation, storage, and/or consumption of cacao or a cacao preparation comes immedi- ately to mind given the Teotihuacan and Guatemala highland distributional foci of such vessels. What we may be seeing, then, is a change in func- tion and ideology in the ways in which cacao was prepared and consumed in the Maya area during the Preclassic/Classic transition, with a local or regional vessel form (i.e., spouted vessel) being replaced with another extra-regional one (i.e., tripod cylinder vase). It must be stressed that we are not suggesting that Teotihuacan introduced cacao to the Maya. Clearly, we now have evidence that the Maya were consum- ing cacao as early as 600 B.C., predating the rise of Teotihuacan by centuries. Furthermore, cacao wood charcoal has been found in Middle and Late Pre- classic contexts in northern Belize at the sites of Cuello, K'axob, Kokeal, and Pulltrowser Swamp (Hammond and Miksicek 1981:260-269; Miksicek 1983:103, 1991:76, 82; Turner and Miksicek 1984:Table 1). Although the archaeological and pollen data are limited, the Maya could have been growing cacao locally in northern Belize during Mid- dlePreclassic times (see Bergmann 1969). However, if the Maya were consuming cacao but not growing it, who was? And, where? There may be indirect evi- dence that cacao was also being grown in north and central Honduras during the Middle Preclassic period. In other areas of Mesoamerica, the data are scant, particularly in the Gulf Coast area where there is no strong archaeological, botanical, or icono- graphic evidence for the use of cacao by the Olmecs (David Lentz and Michael Coe, personal communi- cations,2001). Thus far, it is linguistic evidence that provides the strongest clue that the origins of cacao cultivation began with the Olmecs. According to Campbell and Kaufman (1976), the Olmec spoke ancestral Mixe-Zoquean as farback as 1500 B.C. and that the word kakawa or cacao was a Mixe-Zoquean word. However, in a recent article, Dakin and Wich- mann (2000) contend that the origin of the word "cacao" is a Uto-Aztecan (Nahuatl) term, dating to</page><page sequence="17">REPORTS 101 A.D. 400, not an Olmec one. Based on the current findings from the Colha spouted vessels, it does not seem plausible that the word "kakawa " was diffused to the lowland Maya from highland Mexico, partic- ularly since the Maya were consuming chocolate nearly a millennia before this diffusion supposedly occurred. Clearly, more interdisciplinary research is needed between archaeologists, botanists, linguists, epigraphers, analytical chemists, and geographers to determine the nature and extent of cacao production, distribution, and consumption by Preclassic Mesoamerican cultures. Conclusions Rather than ending on a conjectural note about the origins of cacao, it is important to note that spouted vessels have been recovered from many geographi- cally diverse regions of Mesoamerica. Temporally, they span the Middle and Late Preclassic periods in the Maya area, but continue in other parts of Mesoamerica into historic and modern times. Pre- liminary data indicate that spouted vessels occurred very early in three separate regions of eastern Mesoamerica, including north and central Honduras, western E1 Salvador, and the southern Maya low- lands. Spouted vessels occur earliest in Honduras and E1 Salvador around 900 B.C and are found slightly later in time in the Maya area. It appears, then, based on available data, that spouted vessels developed along the cultural frontier between Mesoamerica and Lower Central America. It is unclear, however, whether or not the Maya independently developed this specialized vessel form on their own or were influenced by the Preclassic cultures to the south of them. Using contextual data presented in Table 1, the vast majority (90 percent) of spouted vessels found across Mesoamerica, including the Maya area were recovered in special deposits like burials and asso- ciated with elite individuals. It is unclear at this time whether their inclusion as offerings was the primary or secondary function. Spout fragments are also on occasion found in midden deposits. We know that many spouted vessels were probably functional and used in a production and consumption complex (e.g., preparing and/or serving), but some of them were not functional and could only have had decorative or symbolic functions. Maya spouted vessels are never high-frequency items (as evidenced by their elaborate forms and decorations) and typically co-occur with other serv- ing vessels in special burials and caches. They are rarely found alone and, therefore, belong to what may be called a "complete table setting," if every vessel form is included as in Oaxaca. McAnany et al. (1999:138) have recently noted this and suggested that spouted vessels recovered from burials at K' axob may have been "signature" pieces in that "they con- tain special characteristics such as modeling, gadrooning, incising, and applique" to specify func- tion. Essentially, this practice of specialized vessel use is found later in the Classic period, with the PSS glyphic texts encircling the rim of cylindrical ves- sels that identifies a titled individual as the owner of the pot that contains tree-fresh cacao. The results of the residue analysis provide defin- itive proof that Middle and Late Preclassic spouted vessels from Colha contained varying amounts of cacao. The information obtained from the Colha ves- sels extends the date of cacao use by the Maya from Early Classic times back to the Middle Preclassic period. Therefore, we now know that the Maya had a much longer history of cacao consumption than previously believed but, to date, evidence is lacking as to whether the Maya were also cultivating it at this time. If cacao was being grown in northern Belize, there is very little demonstrable evidence to show where it was being grown and who was controlling its distribution. Although cacao was identified in a few Colha vessels, it does not mean that all spouted vessels were used for this specific purpose. Some of these vessels may have held chocolate beverages with or without other ingredients or flavorings (e.g., chilis, honey, maize, annatto) similar to that observed dur- ing historic and modern times. One avenue of research that must be pursued is determining what other ingredients were included in Preclassic Maya chocolate drinks. The phytolith research presently being conducted on the Blue Creek vessel should shed light on this issue. Another topic that needs to be more fully inves- tigated is this apparent connection between the dis- appearance of spouted vessels in the Maya lowlands at the end of the Preclassic and the appearance of tri- pod cylinders from highland Mexico. It is important to know whether Teotihuacan influenced the Clas- sic Maya elite in abruptly changing their practice of cacao preparation and consumption.

By that time, vessel form was not as important as what was written or depicted on its surface. In other words, tall cylinders and vases could better illustrate or communicate their message through hieroglyphic texts and pictorial scenes. Acknowledgments.
