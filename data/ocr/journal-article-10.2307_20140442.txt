<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Muses' Birdcage, Then and Now: Cameron on Apollonios Rhodios PETER GREEN An 1980, Mary Lefkowitz contributed to ZPE a paper entitled "The Quarrel between Callimachus and Apollo nius," of which the main thrust was that the quarrel, like snakes in Iceland, was a latter-day fiction. The following year she pub lished a volume on the Lives of the Greek Poets, from which it became clear that, in her opinion, virtually all the surviving bio graphical material about these Hellenic literary figures was invented, for want of genuine information, by Hellenistic critics, working primarily from the poets' own texts. The climate of opinion was exactly right for such a thesis. The "biographical fallacy" had been trashed by a nucleus of influential scholars, and others, spotting a trend, were quick to sign on. The age of the persona had come, bringing with it licence to discount authorial intention in any shape or form?and, as an extra ben efit, freedom to float the most bizarre critical fantasies without fear of contradiction. More insidiously, those who preferred to position themselves immediately behind the cutting edge of research (rather than leading it) were presented with that most precious of gifts for the intellectually lazy?a rule-of-thumb well-suited to general application. Lefkowitz's findings about the lives of Greek poets gave them a dogma that required no serious critical sifting of evidence, but rather a presupposition of nonsense. Even better, its deconstructive, negative nature offered the unearned intellectual cachet that too often attends scepticism of any sort. In short, it was irresistible. Obviously, the older the poet, the easier the thesis is to main tain. Homer, Hesiod, and most of the lyric poets are pushovers. But as time goes on, and record-keeping improves, the axiom</page><page sequence="2">5 8 THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW behind Lefkowitz's argument?that no one at the time cared about poet X or Y's life, thus forcing a later generation of the curious to raid the persona or invent blatant fairy-tales? becomes harder to sustain. Did these people never learn? Was there not even enough local, civic, or familial interest to provide material for an obituary? What became of all the funeral enco mia? When Herodotos claimed to have written so that the great deeds of men should not become ?^irnAa, pass from knowl edge, were poets excluded from the canon? Surely not. Indeed, in one case we can see the process of commemoration at work. The so-called Archilocheion, the shrine on Paros dedicated to Archilochos, contained (Lasserre cv-cvii) a long inscription con cerning the poet's life and work, which (just as we might expect) offers a nice blend of fantasy and fact. Further, as time went on, and better records were kept, and widespread interest began to develop in a?xia?origins as well as causes?it would seem reasonable to assume that more reli able evidence began to be collected. After all, if earlier genera tions of poets had frustrated latter-day knowledge-seekers, would the latter not be doubly careful to document their own contemporaries, and save scholars still unborn from such desper ate measures as they had sometimes been forced to take them selves? It was Hellenistic Alexandria that spearheaded the movement to retrieve the Greek past: how odd if it had displayed no interest in its own present! Thus Lefkowitz, and now Cameron, have had to face a decidedly tricky challenge when they set out to discredit, not only the supposed facts of Apollon ios' life, but every detail of his alleged literary quarrel with Calli machus. For a period where unshakable evidence is hard to come by, sceptics can without trouble cast doubt on most specifics: their real difficulty comes when they try to discount general patterns or trends. To take the most obvious example: \ieya ?i?Xtov, fx?ya xax?v. It needs (and, I may say, it gets) some remarkably disingenuous casuistry to eliminate the obvious con clusion that, whatever else he might have also have had in mind, Callimachus was targeting contemporary epic. When we look at Cameron's Callimachus and his Critics, it becomes apparent that a large part of this immensely erudite</page><page sequence="3">Peter Green 59 book is devoted to countering objections to Lefkowitz's thesis. No one could accuse Cameron of pulling his punches, or holding back from outsize radical solutions. To take one obvious example: his answer to \ieya ?i?^iov, [x?ya xax?v?apart from assuring us that Callimachus' "tongue was firmly in his cheek" (ix?x) when he wrote it?is simply, as far as he can, to expunge epic altogether from the high Hellenistic period: if it didn't exist, Callimachus couldn't possibly have been attacking it. Jam yester day, jam tomorrow, but never jam today: epic was there from Homer to Antimachos; it was there again in the Graeco-Roman period?indeed, ad nauseam, as Juvenal (among others) reminds us, in the opening lines of his first Satire?but somehow, so con veniently for Cameron's argument, under the early Ptolemies it went into near-total temporary eclipse. Why then, we may won der, did the Romans, in their eager (not to say slavish) pursuit of Greek literary models, pick up and develop such an unfashion able non-starter? What, indeed, did Apollonios imagine he was at when he wrote the Argonautika} If this epic poem was an anom aly, a reversion to the past (and in fact, despite its Callimachizing attempts at modernism, it may well have been) then it was all the more likely to be savaged by hostile critics. What Cameron in fact has provided here is an extra argument (even though a false one) in favor of the quarrel in which he so firmly refuses to believe. Epic poetry (considered for a moment in social rather than literary terms) lay at the very heart of the on-going debate between mythos and logos. It is sometimes assumed by intellectu als that the arrival of logos will always be welcome, that mythos is simply awaiting enlightenment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Heart long remained in stubborn resistance against head: mythos persisted against all odds. The archaic world-view it represented was dangerous, baffling, and wholly unpredictable; it stressed?perhaps more realistically than Anaxagorean confi dence in man-the-measure-of-all-things?human helplessness, ?uTjxav?a, against nature and divinity. That ?\i?]%avia formed so prominent a feature of Jason's make-up in the Argonautika was no accident. Meanwhile poets, historians and mythographers anxious to "save the appearances" were forced either to explain</page><page sequence="4">6o THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW away or reinterpret those elements of each mythos which seemed incompatible with the demands of sophisticated logos. The two ways they found of doing this were by rationalization or alle gory: the first dealt with physical or historical impossibilities, the second with matters morally repugnant or embarrassing to the new urban middle classes. Epic, Homer above all, was vulnerable here. It preserved the great mythic cycles. It made no distinction whatsoever between the mythical and the historical, treating both as unquestioned fact, the cumulative legacy of the past (something that renders Cameron's distinction between historical and mythical epic oti ose). It thus catered not only to antiquarians but also to the great mass of thinking (and in Alexandria expatriate) Greeks who sought validation for their culture. Since the mythic tradition formed the prime source for that validation, not least through systematic aetiological enquiry, an open avenue existed by which scholars as well as poets (many, of course, were both) could explore and develop the genre in literary terms. Yet there were serious objections. The acknowledged suprem acy of Homer meant that any modern epic would be relentlessly measured against the Iliad and the Odyssey. At the same time, as was all too clear, the heroic world, with its values, had gone for ever. Besides, the current taste for epigrammatic concision was sure to discourage would-be Homeric epigonoi. Quasi-secular rationalism could not but find the whole divine apparatus of epic?those disconcertingly anthropomorphic Olympians, para normal phenomena like the Clashing Rocks, the Cyclops, or Ai?tes' fire-breathing brazen bulls?both artificial and embar rassing. Even were there no evidence whatsoever for a fundamen tal conflict between the Callimachean school and the author of the Argonautika, it would still be necessary to postulate its existence. It is true, and a fact which Cameron exploits to its full extent, that our evidence for the existence of Hellenistic epic poets other than Apollonios, let alone for their texts, is woefully inadequate. Yet that does not, of course, mean per se that such poets never existed, and about some of them we do have a little evidence. Antimachos of Colophon, an earlier poet who flourished about</page><page sequence="5">Peter Green 61 400, seems in many ways (glosses, neologisms, variatio, obscure allusions, erotic elegy) to have anticipated the scholar-poets of the mid-third century. He wrote an epic Thebaid, and his two book elegy Lyd?, composed in memory of his mistress, and deal ing with unhappy love-stories, contained in Book I an account of Medeia and the Argonauts' expedition (Wyss frs. 56-65) which surely influenced Apollonios' portrayal of Medeia in Arg. III. Apropos the Lyd?, and Callimachus' undoubted dismissal of it as "fat," we have an excellent example of Cameron's favorite forensic device: the confident assertion which readers are left to digest without further argument (337): "So there was no great dispute about different types of poetry; no battle between tradi tional epic and modern poetry; between bad, boring long poems and elegant, witty brief ones. Just a few contemporaries who disagreed about one particular poem. Epic had nothing to do with it. The debate about Antimachus centered on his elegy the Lyd?. There is no reason to suppose that even Callimachus dis approved of his epic Thebaid." There isn't? Presumably this is why Cameron so casually dismisses, unquoted, a key article by Vessey {Hermes 99, 1971, 3), who argues that if Callimachos dis liked the Lyd?, a fortiori "he is likely to have had an even lower opinion of the Thebais, which he must have regarded as an example of that hated genre t? iio\x\\xci to xvx^ix?v." There is no reason to think that he would have thought otherwise about contemporary writers of epic. Here, as I say, the trouble is lack of evidence, though perhaps the lacuna isn't quite as great as Cameron would like us to think. Of Rhianos of Crete's Herakleias, or a Thebaid by Anta goras of Rhodes, it is true, we know only enough to whet our curiosity for more. Rhianos wrote local quasi-historical epics, such as his Messeniak?: both he and Antagoras, interestingly, produced erotic verse as well as epic, a versatility which must weaken Cameron's claim that the debate was exclusively over elegy. Even more interestingly, Dionysios Skytobrachion, an exact contemporary of Apollonios (Rusten 1-21, 93-101)?but, except for three brief casual references, ignored by Cameron? produced an Argonautika (summarised at length by Diodoros, 4.40-56) that ruthlessly rationalizes the myth throughout, and is,</page><page sequence="6">62 THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW in fact, just what we would expect a Callimachean intellectual to approve. The contrast with Apollonios is immediate and strik ing. Ziegler, indeed, in Das hellenistich Epos (e.g., 13), argued that the Callimachean movement, far from being representative of mainstream thinking (the average reader preferred epic any way), was a mandarin aberration, and only much later, under Neoteric influence, actually achieved the position of authority to which, in the mid-third century, it had briefly aspired. No won der Cameron trashes him. Cameron asserts flatly (264) that "both quarrel and contro versy are entirely modern inventions." This is not the only claim in his book that fails to match up to the evidence. Though the Suda is regularly trawled for useful (i.e. supportive) evidence, but briskly dismissed as late and untrustworthy when it records evidence at odds with the theory du jour, the entry on Callima chus (its format suggesting derivation from Hesychios of Miletos) contains the following comment on one title in a list of Callimachus' works: "Ibis, a poem of deliberate obscurity and abusiveness, directed against a certain Ibis, who had become Callimachus' enemy: this person was Apollonios, the author of the Argonautika." A specific enough assertion, this, to require the usual last-ditch refutation: that the words constitute a paren thetical interpolation (along with forgery, the favorite recourse of a classical theorist in trouble). Sure enough, Cameron, follow ing Hutchinson (86-87), makes the predictable claim. It does not carry conviction. As we have seen, there is every a priori reason for assuming (at the very least) a fundamental difference of opinion here. The rea son for the hostility is not stated, but there is a strong chance of it having been literary. That such feuds were common in the Museum we might have guessed, and Timon's famous squib (ap. Athen. i.22d, confirms it (even if we accept Cameron's mildly outr? suggestion that what xakaqoc, really means isn't a wicker cage but a bird's nest): "In the polyglot land of Egypt many now find pasturage as endowed scribblers, endlessly quarrelling in the Muses' birdcage." Callimachus himself, imitating Hipponax (and, like him, presumably on the principle of "Don't do as I do, do as I say"), urged scholars to eschew mutual jealousy (fr. 191</page><page sequence="7">Peter Green 63 Pf., dieg. 6.2 ff.). But, as Pfeiffer observes (History of Classical Scholarship from the Beginnings to the Hellenistic Age [Oxford 1968] 97), what with "free meals, high salaries, no taxes to pay, very pleasant surroundings, good lodgings and servants," there was "plenty of opportunity for quarrelling with one another." Leisure, combined with the arbitrary uncertainties of royal pat ronage, must have made backbiting and paranoia endemic. Despite the vast amount of scholarship generated by this topic, direct testimony for what Callimachus actually disliked in Hellenistic literature is limited. There are three main items of evidence which, taken together, offer a fairly consistent picture: lines 105-114 of the Hymn to Apollo; the partly fragmentary preface (1-38) of the Aitia, attacking the "Telchines" (malevo lent mythical dwarves here representing literary opponents); and a six-line epigram (28 [30] Pf.) on the theme of distaste for what is "base, common, or popular." There are a few other hints? e.g. the last line of one epigram (8 [10] Pf.) wittily closes with a six-syllable word, ?oaxucnjMxx?ir], meaning "brevity"?but these three texts form the basis for all argument. "All that's commonplace makes me sick" (orx/cavo) jt?vTa Ta o?](i?aia) is the epigram's central message: the targets include?fact merging into literary metaphor?not just indis criminate lovers, as Cameron suggests, but also public fountains, over-populated highways, and "cyclic" poetry. Popularity, in short (a perennial academic tenet, this) is suspect. The avoidance of well-trodden roads is a theme that recurs in the preface to the Aitia (25-28), as advice from Apollo. Also, a poet should chirp like the cicada, not bray like the ass (29-32); poems should not be measured by their length or loudness (15-18). The Telchines mutter (?mTQU?ouorv) against Callimachus because he has not written one sustained epic, many thousands of lines in length, about kings or heroes (3-5), but instead turns out short poems, like a child (5-6) and is a man of few lines (?XiyooTixo?, 9). The cryptic postscript (105-114) to Hymn 11 has Envy ((j)9ovo?) whispering to Apollo (106): "I do not admire that poet whose utterance lacks the sweep and range of the sea"?to which Apollo replies, with a contemptuous kick (jto?i t' rjtaxoev), that a river such as the Euphrates may have a vast current (uiya</page><page sequence="8">64 THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW qoo?), but also carries down a mass of silt and refuse; whereas Demeter's priestesses bring her, not just any water, but only (111-12) that "thin trickle, the ultimate distillation (dxoov aooTOv), pure and undefiled, that rises from the sacred spring." The general message is clear. Callimachus is advocating three fundamental qualities in poetry: brevity, originality, and refine ment, whether of style, language, or form. He is criticised for not having produced a "major" or "substantial" work (not the same as an accumulation of aiTia). Bulk, he replies, means dross and (the donkey's bray applies here) vulgarity of utterance. How far can this be taken as directed against epic in general, Apollonios in particular? The "cyclic poem" (to Jtoirpa to xuxA,ixov) might be thought specific enough; but critics have not been slow to remind us that xvxAxx?v also carries the sec ondary meaning of "commonplace," "conventional," even "platitudinous." On the other hand, Callimachus (as the same critics emphasize) had an exquisite ear for the mot juste, and cannot have set up so striking a verbal ambiguity by accident. The message, conveyed with pregnant brevity, is: epic = clich?. Theocritus (7.45-48) scorns those who try to rival Homer. It is epic, too, thousands of lines long (5,835 to the Argonautika) which at Aitia 3-5 Callimachos is reproached by the "Tel chines" for not writing. This judgment would have remained comparatively simple were it not for the existence of the Florentine scholia (Pf. vol. i, 1-3), where several of the "Telchines" are identified, and a little fitful light is shed on the kind of critical debate, if not literary in-fighting, that went on between members of the Alexandrian intellectual coterie. The problem, of course, is that nowhere in the Florentine scholia or related material is there any specific mention of Hellenistic epic, let alone of Apollonios. The genres discussed are elegy and epigram. Cameron, of course, makes the most of this argumentum ex silentio: far more, in fact, than it deserves. If Callimachus thought it preferable, as clearly he did, to write short rather than long poems (not excepting the Aitia, which is simply a string of short poems masquerading as a long one), it is not only in the field of elegy that this preference will apply?even though he may well have picked that genre when</page><page sequence="9">Peter Green 65 defending himself against the specific charges brought by "Tel chines" such as Asklepiades and his friends. It is also worth recalling that, according to one scholiast (schol. Call. H. ii, 106), Callimachus wrote the Hekale in response to those who derided his inability to compose a lengthy work. There seems no compel ling reason to doubt this. From the numerous surviving frag ments it becomes apparent that to attain even this length (no more than one book of the Argonautika) Callimachus resorted to a whole series of individual anecdotes and aitia concerning both protagonists, and indeed other mythical figures (e.g. Erich thonios and the daughters of Cecrops, fr. 70 Hollis = 260 Pf.). The evidence, then, suggests that the tradition of literary dis sension between short poems (personal, aetiological) and long ones (heroic, mythical) was in fact genuine. If Callimachus included epic (the "cyclic poem" in its basic sense) among the types of long poem to which he objected, then Apollonios, as by far the most distinguished living exponent of the genre, must have figured as one of his targets for scorn. If Callimachus approved of a contemporary Argonautika, the odds are very long that it will have been the trendily rationalizing version by Dionysios Skytobrachion. The tradition of Callimachus having composed a derisive poem attacking Apollonios under the name of Ibis thus makes perfectly good sense. Did his victim strike back? It would seem so. We have an epigram ascribed to Apollonios (AP 11.275 = Call. test. Pf. 25, composed in the form of two mock encyclopedia entries: "Callimachus: Trash, cheap joke, blockhead. Original Sin: Writing Callimachus' Origins." Despite Cameron's argument that "this crude and feeble piece" (his words, 227) is irrelevant, doesn't fit the situation, turns on a mere pun, and (last-ditch argument again) must be the work of some other Apollonios, I see no reason not to treat it as genuine. That the two would be at odds over the viability of epic poetry is certain. Finally, the matter of Apollonios' life. It is my contention that the evidence, scanty though it is, enables us to construct a reason able and consistent vita for Apollonios, which neither Lefkowitz nor Cameron has succeeded in disproving. Using this evidence, I maintain that Apollonios, son of Silleus and Rhode, was an Alex andrian by birth, of the Ptolemais tribe, and thus probably the</page><page sequence="10">66 THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW first native-born Alexandrian poet (though his family may have moved to Alexandria from Naukratis). Since he flourished under Ptolemy II Philadelphos?a point to which I will return?and had Callimachus as a teacher, perhaps when the latter was still a grammatik?s in the Alexandrian suburb of Eleusis (i.e. before 285), he will have been born circa 305. Thus his precocious, and unfortunate, public reading of what ended as Book I of the Argonautika will have taken place?if the term "youth" (e(()T]?ov) be strictly interpreted?when he was between eighteen and twenty, i.e., at some point between 285 and 280, while he was still attached, as student or assistant, to Callimachus. It was after this, late in the day (that otye, in context, is highly ironic), that he decided, for now, to concentrate on poetry rather than scholar ship, and removed himself to Rhodes for that purpose. Rhodes left its mark on the Argonautika. Rostropowicz {Eos 88, 1990, 107-17) has shown how much knowledge Apollonios' epic reveals of navigation, maritime life, shipbuilding, and nauti cal expertise in general. The Rhodian shipyards were the most famous in the Mediterranean, their fleets kept the seas safe, and their famous maritime laws were passed on to Rome and the Venetian Republic. On Rhodes Apollonios completed his Argon autika, after carefully revising Book I (fragments of the prior draft of which survive embedded in the scholia), pursued a distin guished teaching career, took part in public life, and achieved a position of some literary eminence. All this took time. The termi nus ante quern for his return to Alexandria had to be the incep tion of his tutorial duties with the future Ptolemy III Euergetes. The boy was born between 288 (the year of his father's marriage to Arsino? I) and 275. He cannot have been less than twelve or more than fifteen when assigned his tutor. Thus we are looking at a date not earlier than 273 and possibly as late as 260, with the earlier period a great deal more likely. If Apollonios emigrated to Rhodes in the period 285-280, he will have spent at least thirteen, and more probably up to twenty years on the island. He could easily have turned forty?a more than acceptable age for such honors?when he made his triumphant return, to be appointed by Ptolemy II both royal tutor and Director of the Library. I would suggest a date circa 265.</page><page sequence="11">Peter Green 67 There followed a long period of uneventful success and pro ductiveness. It will have been during these years that Apollonios wrote foundation-poems on the origins of Alexandria and Nauk ratis, and an aetiological poem entitled Kanobos, just as during his Rhodian residence he had similarly composed works about Caunos, Cnidos, and Rhodes itself. He was equally busy in his capacity as a Museum scholar, with critical works on Homer (including a monograph attacking Zenodotos, the Library's first Director), Hesiod, and Archilochos. This career was only ended in 246, when on his accession Ptolemy III summoned Eratosthenes from Athens to take over the Directorship. There was no question of his old tutor being dismissed, let alone exiled. Apollonios had served with distinction for twenty years, was now in his sixties, and had earned an honorable retirement. If there is any truth in the tradition that after he died (probably in the 230s) he was buried beside Callimachus, that suggests, not?as has been romantically inferred?a reconciliation between the two men, but rather the existence of a private cemetery for the Direc tors and other distinguished members of the Museum and Library community. There are undoubted difficulties and contradictions in our tes timonia, but these tend not to be as impossible as they are gener ally made out. Take the matter of Apollonios' floruit. Most MSS of Life A state that he lived "during the reign of the Ptolemies," em t??v I?ToXeuaiurv. This is rejected by most scholars as, in Hunter's words (R, L. Hunter Apollonios of Rhodes: (tArgonau tica" Book 111 [Cambridge 1989] 1, n.3) "too obvious to need say ing." If so, why was it said? In fact "the Ptolemies," plural, are, and can only be, Ptolemy II Philadelphos and his sister-wife Arsino?, the "Sibling Gods" (0eol 'A?eX(|)oi), the first and by far the most famous of the dynasty's incestuous royal couples, regularly portrayed together on both gold and silver coinage. Wendel, however, emended the text to read ?m toD tqltox) riToXeumou, thus bringing it into agreement with the Souda article which makes Apollonios a coeval of Ptolemy III, and the successor, rather than the predecessor, of Eratosthenes as Direc tor. The obvious explanation of this discrepancy (apparent from a comparison with P. Oxy 1241, is that the writer of</page><page sequence="12">68 THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW the Souda article confused our Apollonios with Apollonios the Classifier (ei?oyocKJxx;), also an Alexandrian, but of a later generation. Yet Cameron and others regard not only P. Oxy. 1241 as more reliable evidence than the rest, which is reasonable, but also the Souda article, which most certainly isn't. Why should they do this? I rather suspect it may have something to do with the long, acrimonious, and largely pointless debate about the relative origi nality of Callimachus, Apollonios, and Theocritus. A late date for Apollonios would be a godsend for scholars specializing in this kind of Quellenforschung. Set him in the 270s, and, as the record makes all too plain, it is impossible to prove which of these poets influenced the others. Shift him down into the 230s, and a large part of the problem vanishes. It is striking, but perhaps not sur prising, how many of the arguments about Apollonios' life are susceptible to this kind of parti pris interpretation. It is, after all, one of the few ways available to discredit the existing evidence. What is surprising is how often Cameron's flat assertions turn out to be not quite right. He stresses (217) that both Lives place the composition of the whole Argonautika in Alexandria: in fact both state that the poem's final completion was accomplished on Rhodes. He also tells us that "the Lives do not bring Apollonius back to Alexandria: he leaves Alexandria as a youth and spends the rest of his life in Rhodes." In fact Life B records the tradition of his return and subsequent elevation. Endeavoring to muddy the waters by claiming that this Rhodian Apollonios was in fact a later (120 bc) sophist from Alabanda, he supports his claim by insisting that Life B's statement about Apollonios being "active in public affairs" and lecturing on rhetoric would be "absurd for the poet." But Alexandria virtually invented the scholar-poet, and since when have poets been debarred by definition from pol itics or civic activism? This kind of argument, I'm happy to report, sometimes back fires. Though he goes to ingenious (if unconvincing) lengths to deny that Callimachus started life as a suburban schoolmaster, casts literary doubts (in sharp contrast to Wilamowitz) on his putative homosexuality, and makes him out to have been, qua general's grandson, a Royal Page at court during his adolescence,</page><page sequence="13">Peter Green 69 Cameron doesn't join Rudolf Blum in claiming that he held the Directorship of the Library. Why not? Because, he tells us, "the Oxyrhynchus list has proved that [Callimachus] was never chief librarian (11)." But in fact, as even a photograph makes clear, it does nothing of the sort. At least half a column is missing before the crucial passage, and anything could have been in the lacuna. Other arguments smell unmistakably of the bottom of the bar rel. The statement in Life B that Apollonios "was found worthy (?t?;i?)6fjvai) of the Museum's Libraries," clearly refers to his appointment as Librarian (it had earlier been used of his enroll ment as a Rhodian citizen); yet Cameron prefers Pfeiffer's uncharacteristically weak (and weakly supported) claim that it meant the admission of his works to the Library's holdings? something for which inclusiveness, not merit, was the criterion. Sometimes he bites his own tail: "The series of Egyptian poems," he informs us (215), "lends no support to the claim of an early departure from Alexandria." Indeed they do not, being written, as we have seen, after his return; and since Apollonios very prob ably never left Alexandria again, this is not too surprising. Some times evidence is abandoned altogether, and dismissive derision has to do the work of reasoned argument: the notion of Rhodian influence on the Argonautika, for example, is simply brushed aside (263) as the acme of extravagance. What comes over most clearly in all this is that the negative thesis comes first, and the evidence is either slanted, trimmed, or, if necessary, ignored in order to advance it. Texts are credible or rejected primarily depending on whether they support or contra dict it. The trouble with theories in a case like this is that they are never fully demonstrable. There is always the temptation to appeal to common sense, or rely on dogmatic assertion, when the evidence runs out. Cameron is no more immune to this tempta tion than the rest of us. I lost count of the times when he comes up with phrases like "obviously," "undoubtedly," "unlikely," "it would not be surprising if," "easy to see why," "something approaching certainty," "it can hardly be coincidence," "we may reasonably assume," must surely have been," &amp;c, &amp;x.?all the familiar labels of persuasive rhetoric. We are both of us arguing, in the last resort, like good Greek orators, on the basis of proba</page><page sequence="14">70 THE MUSES' BIRDCAGE, THEN AND NOW bility, ?jt? toD elxOTO?. I cannot prove my thesis beyond doubt; but then Cameron cannot disprove it either, only say he has, in the hope?not always vain in this world?that his readers will be alternately charmed and bullied into mistaking mere assertion for proof. He enjoys, of course, the double advantage of putting a case that is not only negative (thus earning him automatic credit for scepticism), but which also surfs, as I suggested in my opening remarks, on the wave of a contagious new academic theory. In exactly the same way, a surprising number of anthropologists (Lingua Franca 7.4, 1997, 28-38) have, in the last few years, bought into the notion, against a mass of evidence, that canni balism is, and was, a non-existent fantasy of the colonial mind: as an intellectual concept, not quite up to Holocaust-denial stan dards, but well on the way. The lies-not-lives epidemic currently spread through the study of Greek poets is small beer by com parison, but the psychological pattern is identical. There is a great deal more I could say, both on this phenomenon generally and the specific details of Cameron's take on Apollonios; but I have gone on too long already, and the problem must wait for the first of what, I have no doubt, will be many rounds of unre solved debate. NOTE Material from this article?originally presented in 1996, under the auspices of the University of Colorado, as part of the CAMWS debate on Cameron's Calli machus and his Critics (1996)?has also appeared in: Peter Green, The Argonau tica by Apollonios Rhodios, translated, with introduction, commentary, and glossary (Berkeley 1997).</page></plain_text>
