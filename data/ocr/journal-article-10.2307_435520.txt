<plain_text><page sequence="1">"POETS' POLITICS"--WALLACE STEVENS' OWL'S CLOVER JOSEPH N. RIDDEL I WALLACE STEVENS' twofold com- mitment to life is in some way reconciled, we feel, in his pre- occupation with the theory of poetry. His simultaneous dedication to poetry-the life of the imagination-and to business-- the quotidian world of affairs-is almost a metaphor of his search in poetry for a union of the imagination and reality, for an idea of order in a world of multiplex confusions. Order for Stevens is inextric- ably bound up in poetry; yet his world of reality is a contemporaneous and im- mediate one. It is not strange, then, that a decade such as the 1930's, a decade so concerned with order-and particularly systems of order embraced by politics and the extension of politics, ideology-Ste- vens could offer his own idea (or ideas) of order. He called it, in one of his jottings, "aesthetic order," which "includes all other orders but is not limited to them."' Stevens' volume Ideas of Order (1935) is an almost heretical plea for poetry in a decade which would subordinate art to ideology. Paradoxically, Stevens found himself under attack by the decade's idealists for his own idealism. His order was not practical; his ethic not social or economic. William Van O'Connor notes that a critic by the name of Burnshaw, writing in the New Masses (October 1, 1935), found a "strange confusion" in Stevens' work, that the poetry was the kind "that people concerned with the murderous world collapse can hardly swallow today except in tiny doses," that Stevens would have to "sweep his con- tradictory notions into a valid Idea of Order."2 By "valid" Burnshaw meant po- litical or social, an abstract system where- by the new masses might realize their suppressed potential. Burnshaw was not concerned with poetry per se, but with poetry as polemic. This was the coarsest kind of Marxian criticism. A Christopher Caudwell might well have sympathized with Stevens' aesthetic concerns. Indeed, Caudwell maintained that art, even in the Marxian sense, was not propaganda but a synthesis of the individual experience with the socially recognized symbol. He could not abide in Stevens, however, what he called "the anarchic tendency of the bourgeois artist," the attempt to go it alone "through a free act of the individual will amid decay and disaster."3 Stevens' order was an individual and not a social order; it was "poets' politics" as he ex- pressed it in Owl's Clover, in part an answer to Burnshaw's myopic criticism. What Stevens saw in the chaos and confusion of the 1930's, what many of his critics failed to see, is that there is a basic will for order in man that precedes his commitment to system or idea. That will is manifested in the spiritual and mystical experiences of the individual. In modern times, which constitute for him an "age of disbelief . . . or if not disbelief, indif- ference," art becomes the "compensation for what has been lost."4 System is suspect because it imposes an abstract order which cannot account for man as an indi- 1"Adagia," Opus posthumous, ed.

Man either loses his identity before the abstraction or revolts against it, adding to the confusion. The "poets' politics" are not politics at all but precede politics and eventually al- low men to live within political systems without capitulating to them. Burnshaw's mistake was to interpret Ideas of Order as doctrine when it is ritual. Stevens' aes- thetic is not anarchic in political terms because it acknowledges existing political systems as a reality that it must not only incorporate but understand. The reality side of Stevens' imagination-reality bal- ance prevents anarchy and accounts for his immediacy. The imagination prevents his becoming a slave to that reality and offers him a way of maintaining his identity in the midst of it. Owl's Clover is not, strictly speaking, a political poem, though it is involved with politics. Stevens rejected the poem for its excessive rhetoric, and even after exten- sively cutting and revising it for later editions he would not include it in his Collected Poems. William Van O'Connor, however, calls it his "finest long poem" and one of the best in English during the first half of the century.5 O'Connor's sym- pathetic but sketchy study of the poem finds it a clear, almost doctrinal, state- ment of what he calls Stevens' "Politics of Order," meaning, in part, politics in their usual sense. But Stevens himself has said, O'Connor admits, that, although the poem reflected the political and social furor of the decade, its main intention was to elaborate on the opposition "between things as they are and things imagined; in short, to isolate poetry."'6 I should accept Stevens' judgment on both points: that it is not his finest long poem and that its main intention, but not execution, is con- sistent with his whole poetry. The immediacy of politics in the 1930's made it unavoidable that Stevens include topical matters in his aesthetic, especially when he must consciously combat them. The Marxian abstraction becomes, in the poem, only the most recent of a long line of failures of abstractions to provide an operative order. The rhetoric which Ste- vens deplored was his tendency to let statement replace the organic interrela- tionship of reality and imagination. We may suppose that, looking back from the 1950's, he concluded that the "violence from without" had momentarily over- come the "violence from within" and led him to rhetorical defense. He has said specifically of the poem that it concerns "the effect of the depression on the inter- est of art," that I wanted a confronting of the world as it had been imagined in art and as it was then in fact. If I dropped into a gallery I found that I had no interest in what I saw. The air was charged with anxieties and tensions. To look at pictures there was the same thing as to play the piano in Madrid this afternoon. I was as capable of making observations and of jotting them down as anyone else; and if that is what I had wished to do, I could have done it. I wanted to deal with exactly such a subject and I chose that as a bit of reality, actuality, the contemporane- ous. But I wanted the result to be poetry so far as I was able to write poetry. To be specific, I wanted to apply my own sensibility to some- thing perfectly matter of fact.7 Owl's Clover, in its original form, is Stevens' longest poem,8 more than 860 lines divided into five separate, but organically related, poems. It is more characteristic of Stevens' late verse than his early, in that it is controlled by a dia- lectical, rather than a narrative, con- 5 The Shaping Spirit, p. 60. 6 Ibid., p. 44. 7"The Irrational Element in Poetry," Opus post- humous, p. 219. 8 The edition of the poem used for this essay is printed in Opus posthumous after the original "Alces- tis" edition of the poem.

RIDDEL tinuity-a series of poems playing varia- tions on a theme or set of themes. The central issue is a familiar one to Stevens readers: the possibilities of order in the modern world. The method is analytical as well as rhetorical. Stevens takes certain existing possibilities of order in our cen- tury and puts them to the test of what he feels order must be. Lying behind the method is the assumption that any ab- stract, imposed system necessarily fails to acknowledge the human and thus can be invalidated. Old traditions of art and/or religion fail to take account of the present. The Marxian abstraction denies the hu- man, i.e., the imagination, to treat man as a complex of biological drives. A borrowed or an imposed order cannot account for the particular needs of a people; the order must be native. The ideal future is but a postulate and cannot satisfy the present. The reason is limited and self-deceptive. The failure of each of these ideas of order is a failure to take account of the human variants, the natural law of change, and the identity of the individual. An idea be- comes fixed and is instantly outmoded. A postulate fails to materialize. Reason be- comes engrossed in itself. Stevens' answer, of course, is the imagination, at once individual and uni- versal, inclusive of the past and the pres- ent. For liberal critics of the 1930's, to speak of an imaginative order was to avoid a necessary commitment, to be ir- responsible before a pressing reality. One had to make his choice, the bourgeois or the proletariat. What Stevens saw was that to speak in terms of class was to speak of a rigid abstraction, little more than an economic label for something that was constantly changing. As O'Connor put it in commenting on the fourth poem of Owl's Clover: "Even now, some years after their break with the 'bourgeois past' the Soviets are rediscovering that certain institutions are human rather than bourgeois."'9 Eschewing abstractions, Stevens wishes to return to the well- fount of man's need for order, the innate force that drives man to create out of him- self and his environment an account of the ineffable. This is manifested in myth, in religion, and in poetry-for Stevens, one and the same thing. Myth is the only valid account of the ineffable, a meta- phoric realization of order rising from man's will to understand his environ- ment and himself. It is imaginative and constantly changing, and it is accountable to only one force-the necessity for man to see his world harmoniously but truly. Stevens can account for the varieties of myth; for myth is native and depends on a constantly changing reality. If the myth becomes rigid and fixed, it loses its rele- vance and is discarded. The classical myths served the Greeks in a way they cannot serve us; yet they are imaginative enough to entrance us still today, to charm us, if not to provide us a belief. ("The greatest piece of fiction: Greek my- thology. Classical mythology but Greek above Latin.")'0 For Stevens, the Christian myth has lost its vitality as a controlling vision. He would offer the imagination, not Marxism, as a substitute. Myth is fiction, the "supreme fiction," as he later called it, and its effectiveness lies in its honest adherence to the reality from which it springs. Compare the enduring myths that derive from the earth-goddess Ceres and her daughter Proserpine with, say, the fanciful myth of Johnny Apple- seed that grew out of our own Middle West, and you can appreciate the im- aginative fidelity with which the former answered for recurrent generation as con- trasted with the flatulent unreality that has made the latter worthless for any- SThe Shaping Spirit, p. 63. io "Adagia," p. 178.</page><page sequence="4">WALLACE STEVENS' "OWL'S CLOVER" 121 thing other than entertaining children, naming motels, and adorning bad regional literature. Enduring myth recognizes and embraces its reality, changing with it. Stevens' return to imagination is a return to the fountain of myth. He wishes to be- gin again in the reality of the present, which no myth has yet been able to em- brace. The statue is Stevens' controlling sym- bol. Speaking specifically of the first poem in the series, he said that "the old woman is a symbol of those who suffered during the depression and the statue is a symbol of art, although in several poems of which Owl's Clover . . . consists, the statue is a variable symbol."" Through- out "The Old Woman and the Statue" it stands for the art that has come out of a past and now dead tradition, a tradition which is now a meaningless relic before the confusions of the present. Otherwise, the statue appears to represent form as opposed to the intense fluidity of reality, and when it is seen in relation to its maker, it is a form which incorporates the spirit of its time and place. In short, the pre- vailing image of the statue is form, and form, although it is necessary to Stevens' scheme of order, runs the risk of expiring in its own rigidity. The "supreme fiction," which is finally to evolve out of Stevens' search for order in the 1930's, necessarily takes a form, the form of Verrocchio's masterpieces, if not of General Jackson's statue. It is when man can identify him- self with the statue, can feel "the central in the composition," when the statue "is the sculptor not the stone," that Stevens' idea of order may be realized. The remainder of this essay will be concerned with Stevens' attempt to elabo- rate this order as an alternative to the artificial systems he denies. It will involve a more careful reading of the original Owl's Clover than anyone has so far given it. If the original is distinguished by its rhetoric, it is this rhetoric, above all, which reveals Stevens' preoccupations at the time. For the first and only time in his career he boldly, if awkwardly, insisted on the "poets' politics." II The title is a typical Stevens one, a metaphorical use of natural phenomena. Owl's clover is a California herb of the figwort family, a "scrophulariaceous" herb, as one dictionary puts it, and, even at its most pleasant, hardly related to Stevens' lush tropical flora. It appears to be a metaphor of the reality he found in the depression years-violence and pov- erty and anger, ugly but nevertheless real. In one of her essays in Predilections, Marianne Moore speaks of the "carnivor- ous owl with African greenness for its re- past,"'2 somewhat mixing her metaphor and confusing Stevens', to see the title in one of her familiar animal images. Miss Moore notwithstanding, owl's clover is still a plant, the coarse herb of reality that Stevens faced in the 1930's and which so distracted him from his art. In "The Old Woman and the Statue" Stevens studies the outmoded traditions of the past, the statue of an earlier time, as a guide to order in the present, the old woman of the depression. The statue is of "Another evening," a more tranquil time, and it incorporates that time in its careful design. But the sculptor has not made the accommodation of change; the statue is too much like that of General Du Puy in Notes toward a Supreme Fiction. The statue is art; more than the artist's "muddy hand" is in it. Yet it now stands among "rotten leaves" of the present, which swirl about it and detract from its beauty. The artist had not foreseen the 11 "The Irrational Element in Poetry," p. 219. 12 (New York, 1955), p. 35.</page><page sequence="5">122 JOSEPH N. RIDDEL old woman, "the bitter mind / In a flapping cloak." His failure is the symbolic failure of the past to account for change. In part, his failure is smugness, a desire to fix all time in a complacent now and to escape the responsibility of a future. How- ever, the old woman inevitably appeared. The old woman is the naked reality of the here and now, "So destitute that nothing but herself / Remained." The past cannot solace her, for it has not al- lowed the possibility of her being. The de- humanization of the present has resulted from the failure of system, the failure to realize the possibility of the old woman. "The mass of stone collapsed to marble hulk" before her; the narrowly conceived tradition cannot exist in this reality. The statue, not the old woman, collapses. The reality prevails, and art, tradition-the form of order, if you will-must account for it: "the black of what she thought" changed the marble hulk "to its [the black's] triumphant hue," triumphant but meaningless. The statue loses its relevance and comes to be transfigured as a "man- ner of the mind, a mind of a night / That was whatever the mind might make it." The imagination becomes the saving power, "the sovereign shape in a world of shapes." The order of the present must be individually imaginative and not derive from an outmoded system. The woman, moving through her world, feels intuitive- ly the impulse of change in the seemingly motionless objects that surround her. She has profoundly modified the present, a present thatwould be "brilliant" as was the past, had not the "harridan self and ever- maladive fate" arisen to blot it. The sym- bolic "yew," which might have "Grown great and grave beyond imagined trees," could have been the ideal order, had it not been for the shrieking reality of the present. But the evening can no longer achieve the tranquillity of the traditional religious symbol; it cannot remain "Un- troubled by suffering, which fate assigns to the moment." The statue, the yew- past traditions, old myths, old concepts of order-cannot exist in this age. Their clear definitions do not admit the chaotic flux. The poem, then, is a rejection of the traditional past. The past, as we shall see, must live on in the present but not as an outmoded form. It is assimilated into the present as an unconscious force; it lives within us as a human constant. Stevens found his working metaphor in a decade in which the failure of the past was most immediate and pressing. Politics is only ancillary to his subject here; the political dilemma is a concrete example of the failure of abstraction to consider the hu- man. Art, religion, politics-whatever the statue is, it is too abstract, too formal, too much codified, and too unimaginative. "Mr. Burnshaw and the Statue" picks up the idea of the rejected past and ex- plores the possibilities of a new and ap- plicable tradition growing out of the present. It also suggests the ideal of a future and the various projections of an order in that future. Called "The Statue at the World's End" in later editions, the second poem was undoubtedly first titled as an answer to Burnshaw's criticism. Later, Burnshaw dropped out altogether from both poem and title. Along with his rejection of the past, Stevens is careful to deny the Marxian abstraction of an ideal future. The inevitability of change is Stevens' subject, and the order he offers is much in line with that he was to espouse in "Connoisseur of Chaos." The "thing," the statue, "is dead." And Stevens continues: Everything is dead Except the future. Always everything That is is dead except what ought to be. All things destroy themselves or are destroyed.</page><page sequence="6">WALLACE STEVENS' "OWL'S CLOVER" 123 He is not uttering a Marxian cry for the future but only stating a law of change. The statue is a failure of the imagination, the horses "made to affect a dream they never had." It is, indeed, a mere antique (O'Connor suggests Schwartz's as an antique shop) with only an antique's relevance to the present. The horses are as rigid and "ugly as an idea," in contrast to reality. The real horses would much ex- ceed this creation of the fancy, "this jotting down of the sculptor's foppish- ness." The real horses would exhibit their own nobility in action, by living in change. Stevens then proceeds to see this rejec- tion of a stolid past in terms of a ritual that is at once a rejection and an incep- tion. Out of the death of this past, out of the "sibilant requiems for this effigy," Stevens heralds a "new day," born out of the luxuriance of reality. This "new day" is not a preconceived order. It emerges spontaneously from "nowhere," from the richness of living "as and where you are," as he says elsewhere. It is a product of the individual imagination and the reality of the present: "while the music makes you, make, yourselves, / Long autumn sheens." There is no need to deny the present for a future that one can only posit. Even if it come, its reality, "the apple in the or- chard," "will not be redder, rounder then/ Than now." The "gawky plaster" of a moribund past must decay in time; be- yond that certainty, the dream of a materially ideal future is idle and irre- sponsible. Stevens' new order must admit present- day reality: "The Mass Appoints These Marbles of Itself To Be Itself." This order admits "no subterfuge," no escape from responsibility. The ideal lies in the earth, not in transcending reality, but neither is it materialistic. Stevens' second reference to Shelley within a few lines bears with it an indication of the limits he places on the ideal. The only order for Stevens is momentary, in time, subject to change, and dependent on the facility of the individual imagination to combat the violence without. His order is the "poets' politics" which rule only in the "poets' world." The poets' politics can never be abstract; the poets' world is imaginative reality, and the poet is any man of imagination. Stevens' politics pre- cede politics as we know them, as systems of social order. They are not polemic. The poets of the 1930's who complained and prophesied were concerned with social abstraction, not man. The poets' politics disclose reality but do not analyze it, and propose changes in it. Who knows, order may be conceived by merely allowing reality its identity, by seeing it in the mind's eye and allowing the freedom of its vast disorder. Then "ploughman, pea- cocks, doves"--different aspects of so- ciety, one supposes; that is, different aspects of reality-may find an order outside the abstraction, may find, para- doxically, order in disorder. Stevens re- fuses to accept the Marxian myth of an ideal future as he refuses to admit the myth of an ideal past. He becomes a connoisseur of chaos. A voice which reaches beyond the nar- row limits of Burnshaw sees at the world's end not an ideal proletariat or a dying bourgeois but the inevitable "trash can" of death. The rich and poor alike move to that end to "Give up dead things," the body. This finality of change turns the living back to the consciousness of their being. The rich and poor alike decay, are subject to the buzzard and the crow. This is a reality far more vivid than the eco- nomic starvation of the poor by the rich.</page><page sequence="7">124 JOSEPH N. RIDDEL The finality of death makes materialistic optimism absurd. The law of change does not herald the ideal future; it leads only to final decay, to the "immense detritus" of things. It is not toward an ideal future that the world progresses, but rather from waste To waste, out of the hopeless waste of the past Into a hopeful waste to come. Yet it is not enough to hold to a reality which is soon to be swept into the past. There is no ideal, no sustaining system. The "temple," the final form of order, "is never quite composed." One must submit himself, as Conrad says, to the destruc- tive element: "It is only enough / To live incessantly in change." Change is its own form of order, the natural order of the universe, the order of seasonal sequence which composes a uniform fluidity through "a moving chaos that never ends." In short, man needs to come into a harmoni- ous relationship with his moving world, to evolve a "drastic community" from the "whirling." The poem, thus, moves back to ritual, the rhythm of order danced out in a universe of sibilants. We must turn our backs on the "vivid statue," must recompose ourselves within the possibilities of our present. Man must move through the richness of his world, giving it the liquid order of his imagina- tion while allowing it "To Be Itself." Stevens has tested the ideal against the real, the abstraction against the reality, in an effort to debunk the idea of an imposed order. The error of system is that it ig- nores that which it cannot comfortably embrace. As it narrows and becomes in- creasingly abstract, it eschews the human and becomes the master instead of the servant. Defying change, it rots in its own smugness. Stevens' answer is in one sense a challenge to the denizens of the ideal to see their little world as it is. It becomes a statement not of order but of the necessity of returning to the essence of order, the first idea. From there, one may begin again in the "true meridian," with what is given, the "breathing earth." Having established the basis of his order in a native reality, Stevens turns in "The Greenest Continent" to the form that order must take, the form of myth and the way it derives out of man's need. The poem explores the nature of myth, the necessity for it, and the ways in which it may fail to satisfy. The poem fits cleverly into Stevens' methodical scheme which proceeds with imaginative logic to destroy the social criticism of his "confusions." Against the metaphorical statue and the chaos which surrounds it, he opposes a metaphorical Africa, the "breathing earth" of poem 2. Out of the tensions of opposites, he can show the failure of the former and at the same time the need for form in the latter. That need is man's rage for order, and from that rage comes myth. If the 1930's was a decade which de- manded social reference in art, it was also a time when traditionalists like John Crowe Ransom were chanting a requiem for the death of myth. It was Ransom's contention that "there can be no more poetry on the order of the famous tri- umphs until we come again upon a time when an elaborate Myth will be accepted universally, so that the poet may work within a religious frame which is conven- tional, and therefore universal: having at least that kind of objectivity."'" Ransom and Stevens agreed on the source of that myth, the earth. But where Ransom wished to return to the ancient and sus- taining myth of the past, Stevens would have the poet shoulder the burden of a chaotic world and with the force of his 13 "Yeats and His Symbols," The Critical Perfor- mance, p. 192.</page><page sequence="8">WALLACE STEVENS' "OwL's CLOVER" 125 imagination give it meaning. He main- tained that the great Christian myth did not have the flexibility to serve the modern era, that it was consumed not by indifference but by its failure to resist the onslaught of rationalism. Its mythic too easily degenerated into an ethic, thence into a code or a useless abstraction. In the passage quoted above, Ransom was writ- ing of a past view of his which, he now admits, was given the lie by Yeats. Yeats proved, he says, that, although we have no common religion, the poet can never- theless work effectively with religious symbols of his own. Stevens claims no more when he asserts that the poet must create his own myth out of his experience and the need for order. The poem opens with a short rhetorical question: what god, what myth rules over this pure reality of Africa? None, of course, with the single reservation he will make later. Africa has not lost its identity because it has not succumbed to any ab- straction as had modern Europe, now a mere relic of its great past. The empty castle, too, is like a thing from Schwartz's. It had once been alive, filled with pomp and circumstance which finally destroyed it. Its cultural heritage, the "Schloss- bibliotek," is exhausted. Europe has lost its indigenous vitality to a series of abstractions. Stevens' tropes mark its his- torical decay. "Everything did it at last": every attempt to formalize it into a civil- ization, to see it in terms of class, to subordinate life to the church, to entertain culture vicariously, to improve it with science, and finally war, the "fateful farce / Of war." The decline of belief in life marked the coming-on of chaos. Formerly there had been a belief to sustain it, not the belief in an anthropo- morphic god in his "Salzburg of the skies," but the "spirit's episcopate," an indi- vidual's spiritual order which is "Beyond thought's regulation." This was a time of simplicity and inner harmony which could allay the "confusion of men's voices." It was the religion of "each man" who "Be- held the truth and knew it to be true." In Africa, however, there is not even that belief. In the luxuriant confusions of its untamed reality, there is no attempt to transcend life, to construct a heaven. Death is the last reality. Should the statue rise here, it would prove "Too starkly pallid" for the effusions of reality around it. "No god rules over Africa." Only death can control the serpent, the elephant. It is in the tension between death's finality and the lion's protest against it that one finds the central issues of life bared and not confused by abstrac- tions. Stevens goes on to speak of that mod- ern phenomenon, the missionary, and the absurdity of his dedication. He comes forth ostensibly to save, but, in bringing a foreign order, he "slays." These "Sera- phim of Europe" are warriors against reality, bearing their alien order against the "milkiest bowman." This "new de- sign" is absurd, a "masquerade" that is perpetuated by the humanitarian who sees man through the narrow definition of a conventional order, "Concentric bosh." Their order does not serve in Africa. Myth must arise out of its soil and be in- formed by its environment. The statue was conceived "not in the tumbling green" of Africa but among "The com- mon-place of which it formed a part." Transported into the alien world of Africa, its message is only "half-borne." Opposed to the missionary's zeal, there is the smug intellectualism of the cafe diplomats, who see life as a series of intel- lectual forms. But theirs is a world with- out gods and subsequently without form. They are captives of an abstraction of un- belief that has destroyed the gods and</page><page sequence="9">126 JOSEPH N. RIDDEL left nothing in their place. They have re- jected the statue, the "cavernous past," without being able to "feel the sun." Theirs is an empty world of "Champagne/ On a hot night and a long cigar and talk." It is as vacuous and as limited as the past which they reject. Stevens ultimately arrives at the source of myth, "Fatal Ananke," necessity. We create our myth out of our need for order. Having swept away the false orders which destroy, having returned to the most naked reality, Stevens is ready now to ad- mit the need of an essential form, one which will constrain reality without ob- literating it, a form which will retain tex- ture in its structure. Ananke is the spiritual, intuitive desire for order, the "angel in the nigger's mind." He is the "final," the archetypal god "who ordains/ For races, not for men"; that is, he is the race-constant that limits a particular myth to its particular place and people. He has accounted for the statue which served in its time and place; and subse- quently he has accounted for its destruc- tion when it became outmoded. He is, above all, the "changeless element," the "ubiquitous will," which stimulates man's rage for order. "A Duck for Dinner" proceeds to in- vestigate the possibilities of the future in Stevens' terms as against existing ideas of a future which promise what they never realize. It is, perhaps, the most rhetorical of the five, for Stevens is drawn into the immediate social milieu and the various ideologies which are vying for power over man. Each, of course, must promise a future, and the poets' politics, too, must be cognizant of a future. Stevens has said in the second poem that the future must develop gradually out of the present, from "hopeless waste" to "hopeful waste." There can be no leap into the ideal state. It is interesting that, in a time when fascism was commanding headlines and the uneasy attention of independent states, Stevens would choose the Marxist promise as the greatest potential threat to his humanistic order. The choice is strategic in a poetic, though not necessari- ly in a political, sense. The materialistic ideal is the ultimate abstraction which Stevens uses as a metaphor for ideology. He then opposes it to the idea of an or- ganic order developing its future gradual- ly out of the imaginative demands of those it is to serve. What results is the most nearly political poem in the se- quence. A duck for dinner is a small offering for an ideology which desires to captivate the minds of men. Yet this is the basic as- sumption of dialectical materialism. The "Bulgar," probably a member of the now composite American society, knows that such simplifications lack verity. The mass does not rise suddenly as an abstract unit. Man's rise will be no miracle as was Venus' from the sea, foam-born, as Hesiod tells us. The progress will be gradual and spiritual rather than ma- terial: They rise to the muddy metropolitan elms, To the camellia-chateaux and an inch beyond, Forgetting work, not caring for angels, hunting a lift, The triumph of the arcs of heaven's blue For themselves, and space and time and ease for the duck. They rise "an inch at a time," these several men, because of their desire for self-identity but not by social revolution. This is different, however, from the American past. The individual spirit of the frontiersman founded a country out of his own vitality. But in the industrial present the individual spirit must struggle against the "engined wrick-a-wrack." Mass man in a modern industrial world cannot express this spirit as could the</page><page sequence="10">WALLACE STEVENS' "OWL'S CLOVER" 127 frontiersman; thus, the reality having changed, the ideal of the past is outmoded, the frontier closed. The Bulgar knows that there are no simple abstract answers. The mass is not one race, and the individual, more than a biological entity, is a complex product of his historical past. One cannot lump this vast composite group into one class and call it "proletariat." Though they may outwardly fit into an abstract pattern of action, they, with their separate pasts and alien traditions, cannot be defined as class. It is dangerous to assume from ex- ternal uniformity that there is an internal consent to a single purpose. That is the error of the "newest Soviet reclame," the concerto of a material Eden. An abstract future may fail; reason's clearest logic may turn in upon itself. The answer, says Stevens, is to reverse the Soviet doctrine: As the man the state, not as the state the man, Perennial doctrine and most florid truth. Stevens is a democrat of the imagination. The man-state relationship must be an organic unity, a "sphere," not a country of "squalid cells." Its voice should not be the politician with his systems but the orator of the imagination who can "Con- found all opposites" and set up chords of internal harmony in the man-state. Ste- vens is near to giving affirmation to a form of order which, if not political, verges on a communal ideal of the spirit. It is prob- ably to such a point as this that Hi Simons refers when he says of Owl's Clover that "Stevens so overstressed the ideal term of his ideal-reality dichotomy that he felt it necessary to correct the emphasis in his next major composition, 'The Man with the Blue Guitar.' ",a Even here, Stevens can go no further. In an age of violence, of "concentric mobs," it is not probable that even the power of the imagination can effect a significant order. There is always the fear that the future may fail, Stevens' as well as the Soviets'. Stevens turns again to the statue, this time a statue of order which gathers the mass around it. It is most probably here a symbol of the state or that form of order which politics gives the state. Stevens has changed his perspective upon the statue and now looks at it through the eyes of those it serves or him who made it. The people see more than the barest composi- tion of their statue, their state, if you will. They see the "central of the composition, in which / They live": They see and feel themselves, seeing And feeling the world in which they live. The statue is not its materials but the mind and emotions of its maker. It is the sculptor and his age-and, one supposes, his past-coming together in a single com- position of order. The creation exceeds sex, for sex can only reproduce its own race, while this composition is a synthesis of all races and consequently "another race, / Above our race." Stevens again emphasizes the importance of the artist as the creative and ordering force in a world devoid of belief. The sculptor is "Don Juan turned furious divinity,/ Ethereal compounder, pater patriae"- a proud claim for the artist. It is from him the "future springs"; it is he alone who sees his time and place in its fulness and who sees that his myth must grow out of the existing reality, which is to say, the people. The artist knows that these are not "theoretical people," that he cannot wrap them in the "civil fiction, the calico idea." The poets' politics do not assume an "abstract man," which is an evasion of the existing truth and a repetition which "comes to bear / A meaning without a 14 "Wallace Stevens and Mallarme," Modern Phi- lology, XLIII (May, 1946), 247.</page><page sequence="11">128 JOSEPH N. RIDDEL meaning." These people have a meaning that is not easily apparent to the super- ficial eye. Occasionally, the people make a movement for self-identity (perhaps Stevens means revolution or religious movements), but today they are caught in the movement of history that treats them as a great abstract group and im- poses upon them its abstract future. The irony of materialism is that it has merely diverted them from one dream to another; it has denied heaven ("catastrophe / For Isaac Watts") for a future, one abstrac- tion for another. But the social revolu- tionists have not been aware that the evolution of a future takes "time and tinkering." Stevens' conclusion is very mindful of Eliot's Waste Land images. This leap into the future in thought has not been accompanied in actuality. It has left the present, more or less, between two worlds, beset by a tawdry cheapness and preoccupied with hopelessness: How shall we face the edge of time? We walk In the park. We regret we have no nightingale. We must have the throstle on the gramophone. "Throstle on the gramophone"-"The pianola 'replaces' / Sappho's barbitos," said Ezra Pound surveying the cultural aftermath of World War I. Is the offer of a duck for dinner enough? asks Stevens. Material fulfilment would not necessarily "daunt the old assassin, heart's desire." Wealth may beget wealth, but most sure- ly it will beget the desire for wealth. Stevens finds man's crying need not the material but the spiritual. In the age when the future of a heaven has been per- verted into a heaven of the future, Stevens saw behind the insipid narrowness of "movements" and ideologies to the idea of man and his innate need for order, for belief. He is not deceived by the need to take sides, as many found it imperative to do in the 1930's. Thus he was not in danger of letting either his reason or his passions give way to dogma. "Sombre Figuration," the concluding poem, continues his lifelong preoccupa- tion with the limitations of reason. The theme is particularly appropriate here, for Stevens has come to the point where there are but two alternatives of order, a rea- soned one (and therefore abstract and political) or an imaginative one (and therefore individual and spiritual). His strategy through the first four poems was to investigate metaphorically the various ideas of order advanced against the mod- ern dilemma. Having concluded that the basic error was the assumption that man was but a biological entity, he can pro- ceed to exploit that error in terms of what he calls the "subman," the human con- stant, or spiritual man. The central idea of order, in other words, precedes politics. Subman is the indefinable constant which runs through mankind and which is constantly informing thought and action in the present. He is a kind of Jungian archetype, though universal rather than racial and though not expressed in a series of so-called "patterns" of action. He is, in brief, a sort of metaphorical constant which imagines and finds truth in that imagining, in contrast to thought which is false because it defines and system- atizes. Subman lives on out of the past into the present and will necessarily in- form our future. We see through the eyes of the past not because we wish to avoid the responsibilities of the present but be- cause the past is always with us as ex- perience and unconscious heritage. This accounts for the subtle distinctions of the individual, his uniqueness, and denies the abstraction of class. It is this subman</page><page sequence="12">WALLACE STEVENS' "OwL's CLOVER" 129 within him that is continually surprising the logician, forcing continuous redac- tions of his conclusions, causing him to see "bulls under sea," the inexplicable in the obvious. Although the rationalist may speak of the solid, of the age and its char- acteristics, he must continuously be adapt- ing that view to the "fluid, the cat-eyed atmosphere," the flux in which he and the subman are reconciled. In his essay "Two or Three Ideas,"'5 Stevens preoccupies himself with the na- ture of gods, not as religious symbols but as products of the imagination. The gods come and go, he maintains, as belief waxes and wanes. They are "the clear giants of a vivid time who in the style of their beings made the style of the gods and the gods themselves one." In a poem some- what later than Owl's Clover, "A Primitive like an Orb," he writes of "an abstraction given head, /A giant on the horizon," and later in the poem of man's imaginings as a part of this "giant of nothingness." The giant, it appears, is man's conception of the first idea, his anthropomorphic god filled out in the imagination. Stevens' con- cern with the giant is a fitful conclusion to Owl's Clover. The "sprawling portent" broods over man, informs his consciousness of its limi- tations. But this giant of the 1930's is the "form / Of a generation that does not know itself," that cannot find a belief by which to give the giant body. The tem- poral confusions of the decade obscure its directions. How is the unlearned, the "Young catechumen," to resolve the pressing complexities? He must know that the portent is of his own making, that man makes his gods after man's own image. He must begin again with the knowledge, often repeated, that "the future must bear within it every past." He must deny nothing, neither good nor evil. He must begin without preconceived ideas of his future; he must become, as Stevens said later, a "naked man" again: The portent may itself be memory; And memory may itself be time to come And must be, when the portent, changed takes on A mask up-gathered brilliantly from the dirt, And memory's lord is the lord of prophecy And steps forth, priestly in severity Yet lord. The problem of Stevens' conclusion is one of affirmation, one he is not able to make so clearly as he later was. He pre- sents two opposing choices-the "sprawl- ing portent" and the "statue"-and ends by rejecting both. Admitting the compli- cating obscurity of the passage, I take the portent to be a symbol of spiritual order and the statue one of secular order, both informed by the imagination. If the por- tent moves across the heavens, the statue takes its position in time and space. Were one to choose between the two, he would be most attracted to the statue, for the portent has become "man-haggard" and has been "trampled under the hoofs" of a reality it cannot encompass. "The statue stands in true perspective" so long as it is informed by the imagination. But even that powerful faculty is liable to failure. This is one of Stevens' rare moments of doubt in that greatest of human powers. In this moment of skepticism, he can only revert to that most certain of certainties, his own being in the here and the now. Perhaps the secret passion of man is not to find his order in even the "poet's hum" (the poets' politics) but is to fling away the "cloak" of the night, the imagination, which is "Adorned for a multitude," and 1a Opus posthumous, pp. 202-16.</page><page sequence="13">130 JOSEPH N. RIDDEL to live in the fulness of being as and where we are, to begin again in the "gaudium of being." This is not entirely satisfactory. If Stevens has begun with the idea of testing the possibilities of order presented him in the 1930's, he has ended by rejecting everything, including the imagination. Politically, this would be anarchy, and irresponsible. Poetically, it ends by deny- ing poetry. Is this Stevens' accomplish- ment? Has complete skepticism of system and ideology led him back to the most primitive of existences? No, although the fact that such thoughts can arise is a possible indication of his failure. To con- clude, we must once again look at the poet's basic assumptions. III Stevens' admitted purpose in writing Owl's Clover, we remember, was to ex- pound his particular idea of the relation- ship "between things as they are and things imagined; in short, to isolate poetry." Poetry is order, a form of order that precedes temporal order. It is for Stevens what the great religions of the past or the great myths of the past were for those who could believe. To isolate poetry, then, wvould be to isolate order. But ideas of order are usually temporal or political ideas, especially in the secular world in which Stevens was living, and he was forced by the pressures of his time to defend his ideas against those which were current. To isolate his ideas was to show that they were not merely another ideol- ogy in an age of ideologies. O'Connor is right in saying that Stevens does not ig- nore the issues of the 1930's, that he ascribes to the need of a political world order against anarchy and similar con- fusions. He is wrong, I think, to say that Stevens was momentarily captivated by the Leftist doctrine of an ideal future.'6 The point O'Connor misses is that Stevens' order precedes politics, that it is a defense against politics. Political order at its best and even when most decentralized is an abstraction. Ab- stractions deny the innate vitality of the individual. Stevens was most concerned with an "aesthetic order," one which would defend him against the abstracting tendency of politics, one which could in- clude politics without being limited by them. At no time in his life, as he says, did he find the pressure of politics, the violence from without, so harrowing. That is what motivated the rhetoric for which he later condemned the poem. This can be borne out, I believe, by looking at the revisions that Stevens made in later edi- tions of the poem. If one traces down the deletions from the 1936 to the 1952 edition of the poem, almost two hundred lines in all, he will find that, aside from attempting to tighten up the poem's structure to omit unnecessary repetition, by far the greatest number of lines left out are topical al- lusions and direct suggestions that he is offering an ideal order of his own. Refer- ences to Mr. Burnshaw are completely omitted, that incident having receded into a dead past. His long analysis of the decline of Europe is reduced to a sen- tence, and the section on the cafe diplo- mats wholly excluded. But perhaps the most striking omission is that concerning the "poets' politics" and the "poets' world." It is as if Stevens had found the word too harsh in the 1950's, at a calmer, more mature age-as if politics were only a rhetorical phrase one had to use to be understood in the 1930's. Even then, we 16 The Shaping Spirit, p. 66.</page><page sequence="14">WALLACE STEVENS' "OWL'S CLOVER" 131 notice, Stevens was careful to call his form of order the "poets'" politics, not the "poet's" politics. It was a distinction he was to make, with less anxiety, in Notes toward a Supreme Fiction in which he saw his "first idea" informed by a plurality of poems by, one assumes, a plurality of poets; that is to say, modern myth is to be a composite of the products of the only remaining myth-makers, poets. In the later poem he had no need for the word "politics," and in the later version of Owl's Clover he found politics no longer necessary as a locus of communication. Stevens' "poets' politics" would not be anarchic, then, even in the plainest po- litical terms. His politics are imaginative to the degree acknowledged in his im- agination-reality synthesis. The momen- tary doubt and strained affirmation which Stevens offers at the end of Owl's Clover must be seen in their historical perspec- tive. There are times when the imagina- tion does fail, when the girl at Key West is no longer able to sing her world. Stevens felt this at times in the 1930's, in his compulsion to write Owl's Clover, as he admits. When the imagination fails in Stevens' world, there is nothing left but reality. It is necessary, then, that we com- pose ourselves before it or be destroyed, that we live merely for the passion of liv- ing, for the "gaudium of being." This is what H. H. Watts calls the "cul-de-sac" which "often terminates Stevens' won- derful testimony to his chosen solution."'7 It is the conclusion, finally, to Esthitique du mal, a poem which Owl's Clover closely resembles in intent, if not in realization: The greatest poverty is not to live In a physical world, to feel that one's desire Is too difficult to tell from despair. The rock of earth is Stevens' one and only certainty. The rock remains when the imagination fails; it is the imagination which must make the accommodation. Note the end of Owl's Clover: the night to be re-designed Its land-breath to be stifled, its color changed, Night and the imagination being one. Stevens in the 1930's was caught be- tween past and future, in an uneven time in which the pervasive reality was the social confusions around him. He was forced to attach his imagination to the confusions of his present, to become a connoisseur of chaos. That the most ob- trusive confusions of that era were ex- plicit politics was something Stevens' poetry had never had to face before. Ir- ving Howe explains the failure of the poem as "rhetoric overrunning thought, as as- sault upon a subject which as a poet Stevens was not prepared to confront.'" Because of this, however, the poem offers us perhaps the best chance of seeing Stevens react to immediate reality, to issues which have implications for his concern with belief as well as the threats to his imagination-reality balance and synthesis. It is a most revealing chapter in the growth of a poet. APPENDIX The following is an abstract of certain omissions and revisions Stevens made in the later editions of Owl's Clover.
