<plain_text><page sequence="1">POLITICAL SCIENCE AND POLITICAL THEORY* DAVID G. SMITH Stanford University Among political scientists, even among political theorists, there is a wide- spread conviction that political theory has entered upon a time of troubles. Few, however, regard it simply as a "dead dog," and political theorists con- tinue, as they should, to administer critical self-analysis, and to define and defend their methodological and philosophical positions.' The basis for a unity of opposites is still a subject for dispute. This paper is offered, not as a solution, but as a statement of one conception of the role of political theory. A time-honored technique of dialectic is to seek well-reasoned objections to the view one does not hold. A medicine often commended to the political scientists is a body of systematic, scientific theory akin to economic theory in approach and methodological sophistication. Accordingly, this article takes issue with that interpretation which conceives of political theory as, ideally, the master discipline whereby the science of politics is to be unified and sys- tematized, and empirical investigation oriented and guided.2 A few definite and carefully developed proposals for reconstruction along these lines, familar to political scientists, are G. E. G. Catlin's The Science and Method of Politics, Harold D. Lasswell's and Abraham Kaplan's Power and Society, and David Easton's The Political System.3 These works can serve as an initial point of purchase for analysis and discussion. Each of these programs for the reform of political science and political theory is built upon two theses that are critical for this discussion. One is the proposi- tion that the attempt to dig out and refine the primary concepts and definitions of our discipline is a particularly rewarding occupation.4 The other is a belief that putting the principles of politics together into a "conceptual framework" and articulating them closely-in short a "codification" of political science- is in principle or practice a useful approach to science or knowledge in politics.5 * This article is based upon a paper read at the fifty-second annual meeting of the American Political Science Association in Washington, D.

I The German philosophers, Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert, made a suggestive distinction between "nomothetic" and "idiographic" sciences. Nomothetic sciences, corresponding roughly to the physical sciences, search for abstract, universal laws. Idiographic sciences-exemplified by the more con- crete cultural and historical disciplines-deal with unique, more or less extended temporal events, seeking to represent them fully and exhaustively rather than abstractly.6 The two philosophers took a rather special view of history, and their conception of physical science is in many ways dated; but the bases they used in contrasting science and the cultural disciplines help to discriminate sharply the procedures of political science. The natural sciences, in Kant's phrase, study objects only insofar as they are "determined according to natural law."7 The physicist works only with un- conditionally universal categories, eschewing all particularity or individuality.8 He deliberately excludes all that is qualitative or that relates only to appear- ances, and ruthlessly exorcises all anthropomorphism. His goal is to attain the highest generality, to reduce all to mathematical system and symbolic repre- sentations, and to function with the smallest possible number of assumptions. Thus the saying, which has an odd quality if applied to social studies, that "science has to unify reality, not to understand it."' Social, cultural and historical sciences-the "idiographic" sciences-destroy appearances, qualitative aspects, and particular spatial and temporal relations only in part, and in part preserve the specific and contextual properties of the individual phenomena regardless of what inferences or analyses or abstractions may be made.'0 Several more specific differences follow from this governing distinction. In the first instance, the concrete content of an event or relationship is of more significance, in an idiographic science, than is the abstract, logical or scientific form. The student of politics is not greatly enlightened by learning that Freud's discoveries bear on politics. To know that psychology and history and economics are relevant, even to know how and why they are relevant, is not knowledge that can be converted immediately into a series of reliable de- ductive consequences. The matter for vital concern is the ramifications of some 6 Wilhelm Windelband, "Geschichte und Naturwissenschaft" (1894), in Praludien- Aufsdtze und Reden zur Einfurhung in die Philosophie, Bd.

These are matters not of form or universal principle, but of specific and contextual expression. Secondly, the idiographic sciences often lack sharply defined criteria of con- firmation or disconfirmation of hypotheses or explanations. These disciplines attempt to illuminate phenomena which do not fall neatly into the logician's or the physicist's universal categories, and must necessarily emphasize the particular qualitative shadings of individual configurations. In many instances, ''proof" can be little more than an effort to establish a close or high degree of "fit," "congruence," or "conceptual integration" between the description, the event described, and a more or less wide range of other relevant conceptual findings." Any reflective study of the legislative process would afford a good illustration of this thesis. Like the psychoanalyst, the historian or empirical political scientist, if he works upon any theme large enough to be of impor- tance, never entirely proves his points. Yet we are neither at a loss to criticize the weaknesses of his proofs; nor do we feel, on the other hand, that he has not contributed to our knowledge. Lastly, much of the knowledge sought by the idiographic sciences is not, to adopt John Wisdom's terms, "discovery by investigation," but "discovery by reflection."2 Such discoveries are not "in the facts," but are the result of per- spective, insight, and grasp. In political studies, a statement such as "The national parties are collections of state and local machines," is a homely ex- ample. They are the kind of discoveries reported in the literature of psycho- analysis, in the novel, or in the imaginative treatment of social themes. They are rooted in fact and matured opinion, and seek to summarize experience and insight and to tie knowledge and meaning together. Without them, to para- phrase a famous economist, we might possibly support our lives as political scientists, but we could scarcely be expected to enjoy them. Although this contrast of nomothetic and idiographic sciences is extreme, it is useful to direct attention to certain aspects of political science. The many disciplines grouped together as political science do not fall neatly under one heading or the other. Only slight reflection is required to realize that politics is primarily an idiographic science. Perhaps a simple example of the relation between political science and related disciplines will illustrate. The political scientist has little use for the formalized or theoretical aspects of these dis- ciplines-for economic theory, abstract learning theory, or highly conceptu- alized studies of group-behavior. He turns almost exclusively to those parts of other disciplines which cast their statements of findings in a contextual and relational mold-to psychoanalytic studies, to the more empirical, social and historical aspects of economics, to the sociologist's picturing of groups in a wide range of social situations-in short, to those related subjects that are concretely descriptive.

Political science is not a "behavioral" science, concerned with general laws. The sub- ject-matter of politics is basically the specific problem and particular institu- tion: a constitution for post-war Germany, the present goals of Soviet foreign policy, the legislative process in Congress, or the reform of a city or state government. The political scientist may avail himself of the "laws" or descrip- tive regularities formulated by the behavioral scientist, but as a political scien- tist, his need is for less and not more general information. He is concerned to learn not how politics will illuminate human behavior, but the way in which depth psychology can aid in comprehending Nazism, or how problems of capital formation bear upon the politics of Southeast Asia, or what theories of class stratification contribute to the study of American voting behavior. A generalized theory or "conceptual framework" of politics as a whole would give too distant and too different a view of the reality that the political scien- tist wants to study and reconstruct. The political scientist, assuming he could employ such an analytical system, would still face the task of searching for and re-assembling the concrete and qualitative details of his problem, and testing his solution, not by his abstract model, but in relation to the specific and con- textual properties of his empirical materials. And if he also reported his findings in the language of such a "conceptual framework," the political scientist would find it necessary to attach an addendum, stating in descriptive and qualitative language what he really meant to say. The Language of Politics. David Easton remarks that a science is "as strong as its concepts ... "213 This statement may be true of physical sciences; yet the attempt to exalt the status of political science in the hierarchy of sciences by assiduously recasting, polishing and sharpening its definitions and basic concepts is open to strong suspicion. Definitions function in radically different ways depending upon the purposes they serve and the nature of the disciplines within which they are employed. A passing glance at the different functions of definition in pure geometry, physics, ethics and law evokes considerable uneasiness at proposals for an authoritative terminology in a subject as diverse as political science.14 Two vital but unproven assumptions seem to be involved in most proposals for conceptual rigor and technical vocabulary in political science. Both assump- tions comport ill with the idiographic properties of the discipline. The first unproved thesis is that effort devoted to more precise analytical and descriptive characterization of the abstracted elements of a political phenomenon yields proportionate revenue in reconstructing or understanding the situation as a whole. Secondly, the demand for terminology appears to turn also upon a 13 Easton, op. cit., p. 44. 14 See, for example, Arthur Pap, Elements of Analytic Philosophy (New York, 1949), pp. 100-107; Morris R. Cohen and Ernest Nagel, An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method (London, 1939), Abridged Edition, p. 235; G. C. Field, "The Place of Definition in Ethics," in W. S.

Hart, "Symposium: Theory and Definition in Jurisprudence," Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume XXIX (London, 1955), pp. 216 ff.</page><page sequence="5">738 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW belief that it is possible to have in advance an accurate and relatively conclusive knowledge of precisely what is to be characterized and with what specific conceptual instruments and preconceptions the task of characterization is to be approached. The first assumption is quite appropriate to a highly developed physical science. These sciences decompose reality into its elements, analyze these elements, and then reason deductively or by implication from the residual concepts. A necessary step in the procedure is precise analysis of the simplest phenomenon exhibiting the strategic factors involved in a specific problem.'5 And because the categories of natural science are universal and relations logical and mathematical, the procedure is extremely valuable. But the results of applying any similar method to the social sciences are quite different, as the example of Pareto testifies. Perhaps the most illustrative case is the long and arid dispute of the psychologists over the nature, number and exact definition of "instincts," "drives" or "needs." Certainly, this exercise was not without importance. But many authors wrote quite intelligently and accurately about the more complex problems of psychology, even though these foundation concepts remained unclarified. Moreover, the dispute was not settled primarily by reflection upon or analysis of these terms, but by an accre- tion of information and reshaping of philosophy that ultimately implied new definitions. Even so, the precise logical and verbal properties, or even the em- pirical content of these new definitions, do not seem highly important or useful in discussing the concrete expression of these "residues" in a cultural context, or in the treatment of more complex problems of personality. Heavy labors concentrated upon definition and conceptual clarification of a diffuse discipline such as political science seem to promise an even slighter yield. Analyzing the political into its elements still leaves the complex unity to be explained. Possibly the variables isolated would be numerous enough, and the descriptions of their functioning discursive and concrete enough to do justice to the richness and subtle diversity of political behavior. But this seems to be another way of saying that the way to learn more about politics is to learn more about politics. The proposition that it is possible to have in advance a relatively accurate notion of what, specifically, about a phenomenon is to be described and how it is to be described is a notion also more appropriate to the physical than the social sciences. In physics, this condition is fulfilled because the exact form of the data required is already known. What is to be characterized and how it is to be characterized is determined. But in social sciences, as Durkheim notes,16 discovering the nature of the problem itself is almost the whole of the task of solution. And the nature of the problem largely is just this matter of determin- ing what, in a particular instance, needs to be described. In the study of politics, where problems are largely diffuse, concrete and unique, this requirement im- 16 F. S. C.

There is also a compelling positive ground for avoiding, as far as possible, a highly technical vocabulary of politics. Political policy and moral judgment are inseparable; they are woven together both practically and conceptually. And the carefully chiseled and closely articulated terminology of the systematic reformer is often much worse than useless in weighing choices between policy alternatives or searching for the valuational premises of particular courses of action. Ordinary language, "common sense" notions of events and behavior, and everyday, popular distinctions cannot be eradicated from the subject-matter of politics, any more than they can from that of ethics.'7 Certainly, rigor has its place. More, not less, analytical clarity and linguistic precision are needed in the often cavalier treatment of such notions as "natural," "equitable," "democratic," etc. But commonly held views and subjective conceptions of "rights" or "coercion" are essential data in piecing together the whole pattern of the ethical implications of political programs. Equally, prevalent anticipa- tions, popular distinctions, and specific contexts are part and parcel of viable conceptions of "liberty" or "loyalty." In the same vein, "democracy" and "freedom" defy all attempts at final, authoritative definition and continue to gain supplementary meaning and richness from the theorist's attention to their habitual, undisciplined employment in everyday discussion and language. Insistence upon banishing ordinary language and distinctions by resolute ad- herence to scientific vocabulary, as moral philosophers have long insisted, can lead political scientists, first, to obscure and evade the crux of ethical disputes, and last, to rest in sterile conceptualism.18 The problem of doing justice to meaning and subtle implication is corre- spondingly magnified when a scientific or technical vocabulary is combined with the "conceptual framework." Discussion of and writing about politics are heavily infused with terms that have varying amounts of emotive content, such as "power," "responsibility," "legal," "consent," "authority," and "elite." Definitions expressed with such words are persuasive definitions, and proposi- tions about such terms are often subtly and systematically misleading. Dif- 17 This same point has been effectively argued in respect to law. For example, the definitions of "intent," "causation," and "defamation" in law are necessarily merged and interwoven with ordinary language and "common sense" ideas of the subjects. See Glanville Williams, "Language and the Law," II and IV, Law Quarterly Review, Vol. 61, at pp. 181, 190, 191, 393, 394; and H. L. A. Hart and A. M. Honore, "Causation in the Law: I-A Survey of Common-Sense Principles," Law Quarterly Review, Vol. 72, at pp. 60, 64. 18 R. G. Collingwood supplies some support, on philosophical grounds, for the views here presented on this subject. He argues that the language of ethics-particularly when structured about such terms as "expedient," "pleasure," "happiness," "good," "just," "right"-has its own specific syntactical qualities of overlapping classes, contextual relation, and hierarchical ordering that defy any attempt to reduce the subject matter of ethics to neat or final categories and statements. See his An Essay on Philosophical Method (Oxford, 1933), pp. 33, 49, 86-89, 92-101.</page><page sequence="7">740 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW ficulties and dangers arising from systematic bias are illustrated by manage- ment studies, by the literature of administrative efficiency, or by approaches taken in the study of social control."9 Casting the language of politics in the rigorous formulae of a given scientific framework may produce logical order; but it will also achieve disciplined and persistent perversity in the discussion of moral and democratic issues. The linguistic needs of political science are complex. Some terminology is technical, obviously, because it is borrowed from law, psychology, economics or related subjects. Furthermore, some of the concepts of political science are complex, puzzling in their use, or especially valuable in economizing thought or focussing or directing inquiry. These notions often require reform or analy- sis. Equally, however, political science makes extensive use of ordinary lan- guage and of the rich, flexible, and technically undisciplined vocabulary of literature to communicate information in a comprehensible form, and to char- acterize sharply qualitative differences, shades of meaning, and the elusive dis- tinctions of reasoned philosophical views. The relations between these pur- poses of language are tangled and complicated, and very likely to be slighted by a systematic program for linguistic reform. A better approach, perhaps, is that of the lawyer, of allowing language and concepts to grow and be shaped piece- meal, in response to the emergent needs of a pluralistic subject matter. The Codification of Political Science. Among proposals for the renovation of political science, the comprehensive "analytical" or "conceptual framework" has special attractions. Part of the allure of such an all-embracing program is that it offers hopes of scientific advances through a systematic and dis- ciplined approach to the task of sharpening concepts and relating basic prin- ciples or hypotheses. Moreover, claims are made that such a method would suggest new and useful hypotheses, aid in the identification of political vari- ables, and improve predictive theory.20 This appeal for a methodological cam- paign needs to be critically examined both in relation to past experience in political inquiry, and by a consideration of crucial differences and similarities in other related disciplines where such techniques have been successful or un- successful. Economic theory is the one social science that exhibits any high degree of scientific maturity. The growth of economic theory, also, has required and produced progressive systematization and increasing methodological rigor. However, the contrasts between scientific economics and political science are discouraging rather than promising. Economic theory is applicable primarily to static or short-term conditions.21 It deals with one, qualitatively uniform, 19 For an illustrative and compelling example of systematic bias, compare Lionel Trill- ing, "The Kinsey Report," in his The Liberal Imagination (New York, 1950), p. 216. 20 Catlin, op. cit., pp. 95-131; Easton, op. cit., p. 318; Lasswell and Kaplan, op. cit., pp. xxi-xxii.

Knight, The Ethics of Competition (London, 1935), pp. 141-4.</page><page sequence="8">POLITICAL SCIENCE AND POLITICAL THEORY 741 narrowly defined species of conduct. For economic theory, the end of activity is given, and the attitude toward that end determined by the assumption of rational behavior. With these special assumptions, the economic theorist can build a system of premises and theorems universally valid as to the form, not the content, of economic activity.22 But the political scientist is more interested in the particular content of events and institutions than their universal or generalized form. The ends of political activity are not given, but diverse and continuously and rapidly changing. Assumptions of rational behavior toward a complex of ends or any given end are likely to be misleading and positively dangerous. The limited successes of the economic theorist in attempting to con- struct a theory of economic dynamics23 should suggest the difficulties lying in the path of "analytical frameworks" when the logic of conceptions does not correspond closely to the "logic" of events. The history of psychoanalysis, another case study instructive for the political scientist, affords an example in which increasing systematic rigor has not been the path of progress. To be sure, Freud's initial models have been altered by numerous elaborations and qualifications. But beyond a point at which the constituent concepts and their relations are still rather ill-defined and loosely articulated, disciplinary reform is not achieved by systematization and def- inition. Instead, analysts gain increased skill in using their concepts to explore and reconstruct. They need interpretive ability, cumulative insight, grasp and informed judgment rather than logic or method. Significantly, schools of psychoanalytic thought quarrel about their comprehensive models and about canons of application and construction more nearly in the fashion of legal theorists or philosophers than of scientists or logicians.24 It seems likely that their laggard ways have reason, and that greater scientific purity, in the strict sense, is not sought because it would be at the expense of the usefulness of the discipline. These examples argue strongly against any image of politics as a discipline possessed of a usable body of abstract deductive theory making possible scientific predictions of method and form. If a hypothetical "conceptual frame- work" for the political process can be at best a rather loose-jointed body of 22 Ibid., pp. 135-145. 23 Ibid., pp. 141-144. 24 Clara Thompson, Psychoanalysis: Evolution and Development (London, 1952). Karl Marx is also an instance of the manner in which conceptual rigor can lead away from in- tellectual light. In passages where Marx uses his materialistic interpretations of history as "levers for construction," his depicting of history or analysis of contemporary events is lifeless and unconvincing. Only where he or Engels employed their philosophy of history more tolerantly and more loosely, using concepts to probe and illuminate rather than to shape materials to an analytical model, does the interpretive power of Marx's insights become evident. The example is imperfect, however, because Marx also committed the error of reductivism-reducing a complex issue to a logically simpler level, as, for example, by explaining a psychological phenomenon in the language and concepts of biology; in short, a form of over-simplification, which accounts for part of his difficulties.</page><page sequence="9">742 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW concepts and hypotheses, then prediction will remain at its present level of informed guesses based essentially on common-sense notions of behavior.25 For the political scientist, unlike the physicist, will not have terms with fixed content, relations between concepts that are precise and stated, or rules of transformation permitting reliable inferences from one formal entity to another. To discover the significant and the exact relations of variables, the political scientist will still be forced to grope empirically. And reliable conclusions, or the control of error26 will still depend upon assessment, confirming each step of the reasoning process empirically, and testing the result itself by the aid of con- crete imagination or appeal to experience. In other words, the state of the dis- cipline in the matter of prediction will stand much as before. The claim most commonly made is that such a "conceptual framework" will aid in research-in exposing pseudo-problems, in revealing areas of ignor- ance, in directing inquiry, and in suggesting hypotheses worthy of further investigation. Certainly, some of these claims should be conceded. A codifica- tion of the principles of politics will expose some pseudo-problems. Whether it will generate more than it exposes is another question. Similarly, a systematic summation of knowledge reveals areas of ignorance. But the reasons why, specifically in the study of political science, an elaborate "conceptual frame- work" should be more effective than a careful inventory of ignorance remain to be explained. Perhaps the codification of political science would suggest hypotheses valu- able for further research; but the logical grounds for supposing this to be so are not readily apparent. What must be proven, if the methodologist's position is to be accepted, is that the use of such a "conceptual framework" to search for more inclusive and more abstract formulae embracing sets of related hypoth- eses turns up not only logical and conceptual problems, but problems with significant empirical content as well. In physics, by virtue of a close unity of empirical content, mathematical reasoning and physical intitution, significant empirical problems are discovered in such a fashion. In political science, the ascent through successive levels of abstraction would seem most likely to re- move the investigator to an altitude at which the clues he is seeking merge into the surrounding landscape. In disciplines such as psychoanalysis, political science or anthropology, a startling or anomalous fact becomes a strategic datum for the particular scientist not by virtue of its logical and conceptual relation to a comprehensive system of the particular science, but because of his immersion in and theoretic sensitivity to the particular subject on which he is working.27 A wide competence in a particular subject will always be of value in suggesting hypotheses. But conceptual systematization does not automati- 25 See Knight, op. cit., pp. 124-126, for a discussion of the role of common-sense in prediction. 26 C. I.

The limited successes achieved by the use of conceptual constructs in political science are of a variety that should warn against any ambitious methodological schema. The application of group theory to party politics, the decision-making approach to administration, the concept of power to international relations, and analyses of individual judicial attitudes and of the evolution of legal doc- trine to the courts, have been valuable in differing degrees. But this experience argues for a piece-meal attack. These methodological tools vary greatly in approach and supposition. They have no common denominator, suggesting some inclusive, general formula. Nor are they, as "models," elaborate or sophis- ticated. Conceivably, the theorist might devote his attention to the construc- tion and refinement of these more modest tools of inquiry. However, it should be obvious that the problems here are not those of detached conceptual re- finement, but of application and improvement through use. These are tasks for the specialists in these fields. Contemplation of the histories of physics, chemistry and economic theory is inspiring, but perhaps misleading. The wreckage of some of the monstrous symbolic mechanisms of the nineteenth century, such as the Hegelian dialectic, are equally lessons of history. European codifications of law in the same century are also instructive, especially when undertaken by jurists dominated by a passion for abstract logic. The imposition of deductive systems and a "mathematics of concepts" upon a vast field of diverse, complex, continually evolving separate problems did not produce order and clarity, but subterfuge, fictions, tortuous language, logical confusion and inept handling of individual cases.28 Political science should not become, in Bentham's pungent language, "the art of being methodically ignorant of what everybody knows." II Since the political theorist cannot supply methodological canons for the guidance of scientific inquiry, there remains the task of describing what, except for the study of the history of political philosophy, the theorist can do. The preceding discussion suggests two conclusions. Political theory is largely a reflective and literary discipline, more akin to moral philosophy in its relation to ordinary living, than to economic theory or mathematical physics in their relations to economics or physics. The theorist warns and advises; he does not legislate. He pursues and articulates assumptions and implications, and com- mends models of the political life. Secondly, political theory does not have a task or a function. Its tasks are several. And the particular problems with which it is concerned are of greater significance than the matrix within which these problems are embedded. These problems are questions for the political theorist either because they call for reflective or philosophical judgment, or because there is confusion in such judgments about these matters. 28 Julius Stone, The Province and Function of Law (London, 1947), esp. Ch. VII, "Falla- cies of Logical Form in Legal Reasoning."</page><page sequence="11">744 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW One employment of political theory is that of analysis, with several ap- proaches and several goals. Some topics require logical or philosophical analysis. For example, questions of the form, "What is sovereignty? the state? law?" have caused much perplexity. Whether such questions are merely "verbal," or whether they have a significant and not wholly obfuscating use in political discourse is a problem for the theorist.29 Another issue for the logician, already discussed at some length by Prof. Weldon,30 is the cognitive status of proposi- tions about public policy or political values. A second type of analysis is essentially linguistic in character. How judges, political sectarians, or ordinary people commonly and occasionally employ terms, and the distinctions they want to make, are a vital part of political dis- cussion. The reasons for the meanings assigned to such terms as "freedom," "consent," "responsibility," "community," "democracy," are significant clues; and the exploration of these reasons is one of the primary ways of getting straight what one wants to say, and what sorts of propositions about such terms make sense.31 A more honorific occupation for political theory, partly analytical in charac- ter, might be termed philosophical critique. Such a critique can be of use both in practical or moral and in scientific concerns. One continuing task of the theorist is that of formulating philosophical judgments upon political practices and doctrines-unearthing their premises, tracing out their remoter implica- tions, and presenting his reasoned criticism from the vantage point of moral philosophy, past experience, and present aspirations. Similarly, as a critic, rather than a creator of method, the theorist may help in untangling methodo- logical confusion. Systematically misleading expressions,32 equivocal termi- nology, mistaking the logically simple for constituent or cause, and disguised versions of reductivism or determinism are obvious and frequent examples of errors in treatises on method. Further, insights drawn from philosophy or the history of science can aid in forming tentative judgments of the conceptual foundations or philosophical consequences of a methodology. But beyond these negative functions of criticism and clarification, some- thing more positive is wanted of the theorist. Traditionally, political theory has claimed a series of special problems, such as those related to personal and civil liberties, loyalty and civil disobedience, equality, authority, and the appropri- ate grounds and limits of government intervention. The creative role of the political theorist depends largely upon what he can say about these matters. 29 As examples of a similar type of analysis in law, see H. L. A. Hart, "Definition and Theory in Jurisprudence" (Oxford, 1953); also, Jonathan Cohen and H. L. A. Hart, loc. cit. 30 T. D.

To some extent, these topics are his through preemption. Political theory has been about them; and the theorist has reflected upon them. Consequently, he believes that he has something to contribute to their clarifi- cation. Secondly, the content of these problems changes constantly. Each gen- eration must make up its mind about them. And the political theorist, in prin- ciple at least, contributes to the process of revision of evaluations and contin- uing decision. A more significant reason for allotting these subjects to political theory results, to speak paradoxically, from their obscurity. They are questions of policy, but call for a decision on a route into uncharted regions. Moral values are involved, but there is disagreement upon what values shall guide us, and the values themselves are muddied and distorted by collective political action and diffusely and subtly meshed with social living. Furthermore, the problems of behavior shade off into darkness-the line at which legal rules break down or miscarry, the force of some image from the past, the power of hate, the amount of virtue that a nation can bear, the latent potentialities of political institutions. Therefore, it is idle to look for conclusive answers to the broader questions of political theory. What is wanted is the statement of a reasoned philosophical position, and informed judgment upon viable political options-in short, guid- ance in matters that despite their obscurity we must still decide. The theorist, in his consideration of these traditional problems of political theory, can be likened to a reflective jurist reasoning about the merits of adopt- ing a new line of precedent. Like the jurist, the political theorist strives for a practicable optimum, for a good and honest rule or principle that can survive and guide for future days. More than facts and logic is needed. The theorist's tasks call for intuition and judgment and wisdom to achieve creative solutions that strike a balance between interests, satisfy moral sentiments, and comport with a body of existing rules and institutional practices. Both the jurist and the theorist must reach conclusions about many questions of possible reactions and of human behavior, past and future. But the sign-posts that they have reach only part of the way. And they are searching not only for a safe answer but a good one. Beyond what personal experience and science can tell them, they both have use for and build upon the kind of insights, judgments and perspectives gained through literature, through philosophy, through reflection upon history. The political theorist's mistake lies not in his concern with these issues, but in his failure to revise the list of topics and shift his approaches to them. Some problems should be allowed to expire; new ones should be added. Some tradi- tional themes, such as political obligation, probably require only slight restate- ment. Others, such as pluralism, should be dissected into a group of separate questions. But a failing common to many discussions is their abstractness; they revolve about propositions so far removed from the political scene that they smack of scholasticism. Political science, law, economics, and the behavioral sciences are in continual evolution. They offer empirical foundations and raw</page><page sequence="13">746 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW materials for the problems of political theory. The methods and materials for answering the issues of political theory change as well as the issues themselves. Therefore, restatement is doubly necessary. And reconsideration is not tread- ing the same ground, but continually creative. Political theorists are commonly engaged in one remaining vocation. This occupation is the endeavor to present a systematic philosophy of politics: a comprehensive picture of political life that relates our living together in a com- mon political entity with our private and general ends and our final aims.33 There seem to be two valid reasons why the writers of such treatises strive for systematic unity. First, to give a view of the whole so that interests, groups, institutions, aims, means, and policies are not viewed in isolation, but as parts of an interrelated and complex solution. Second, systematic unity is a mode of exposition and proof. Within such a framework, the significance, the validity, and the creative power of a theoretical perspective are set forth and tested. A systematic political theory differs from a systematic treatment of political institutions primarily by greater emphasis upon the valuable in possible politi- cal goals, and upon the search for political ways and obstacles to broader and more ultimate moral purpose. If well done, a political philosophy has much in common with a thoughtful novel. The novel treats of quite possible characters and largely of ordinary and familiar events. But relationships of personalities, values and ideas cast shadows upon a far larger screen. Elements of scattered events are made to stand out, are ordered, and the whole set in a context so that the ordinary and familiar jars and provokes reflection. An intuition that before was dim and wavering is now clearer. An anomalous apprehension is articu- lated. Or the reverse is the case, and what was long believed now has an air of lunacy. The novelist carries his points by bringing his characters and his story fully to life. He shows us models of lives that are possible ones-lives like ours, and yet different from ours in a way that casts a thousand lights upon the life that we are leading, that enables us better to see why we behave as we do, and what we want to become. Political theory, in its most constructive and ambitious endeavors, is literary in form. Some are perhaps disturbed by such a comparison and tempted to say, "Let Science be done, though perish the earth." Science has its role; but so has literature, and especially in aiding us to discover what we want to do. Like the novelist, the political theorist paints pictures in words of a political life that we might choose, or that we are now leading but do not fully comprehend. He records his reflections upon politics to help us to decide how we are to live. As Plato observed, that task is no mean one. 33 The most representative examples of a systematic philosophy of politics, as the concept is here discussed, are Ernest Barker's Principles of Social and Political Theory (Oxford, 1950), and Robert M. MacIver's Web of Government (New York, 1947).</page></plain_text>
