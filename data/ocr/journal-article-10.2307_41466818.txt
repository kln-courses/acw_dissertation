<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Origins of Intelligence, by Sue Taylor Parker and Michael L. McKinney. Bal- timore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. 1999. 404 pp. CDN$81.50; USD$55.00. The Origins of Intelligence comprises 13 chapters in two parts. Part I concerns ontogeny of cognition within a Piagetian framework. Part II focuses on phyloge- ny and evolutionary biology. Part I and chapters 9, 10, and 11 were written by Parker. McKinney contributed chapters 8 and 13. Only Chapter 12 is coauthored. The book is stylistically quite academic, and at points cumbersome. There are an objectionable number of errors: of fact, of spelling - a proper editing could have obviated many of these annoying flaws. The purpose of the book is to trace the origins of cognitive abilities. Com- parisons throughout are between human children and nonhuman primates, mostly the apes. The Piagetian theory and methodology are supplemented by Perner's (1991) framework when the discussion turns to the theory of mind in the chapter on social cognition. The overall hypothesis is presented in the preface and intro- duction and identified as 'radical' in that it confronts and dismisses the evolution- ary process of the retention of juvenile traits in the adult known as neoteny (i.e., juvenilization) as the means by which cognitive abilities developed sequentially for primates. Rather, it was "adultification," the progressive extension of adult stages, that facilitated this development. These concepts are situated within evo- lutionary biology and given extensive treatment. McKinney recently (1990) coauthored a seminal work discussing heterochrony - changes in rates of growth and development within the evolutionary context. His contribution, then, is a reit- eration and exegesis of the process by which hominid abilities emerged. Major excursions to intellectual history, cladistics, anatomy, neuroanatomy, and behav- ior are made to develop the matrix for the thesis. It is an ambitious and impressive journey, interesting, and provocative. The size of the project, however, sets its own limitations. Trying to standardize developmental progression across the Order is under- standably a priority, but virtually impossible since there is a dearth of Piagetian studies across the Order. The use of Piaget as a universal comparative structure is reasonable because it is so well known, despite the development of alternative models of cognition (e.g., Gopnik 1996), and despite the fact that the sensorimo- tor period - essential to this work - is currently being reviewed as knowledge of cognitive development in children increases (Decarie et al. 1996; Mueller et al. 1998). The debate in neo-Piagetian discourse over what influences development, biology or social environment, has received a new twist with the recent publica- tion by Deaner et al. (2000) indicating that such studies are methodologically flawed, so that there may not be a distinction between these 'forces' in evolution- ary development. Certainly the evidence of enculturation (p. 159) depends on</page><page sequence="2">476 / Book Reviews having a culture. Since the 1970s, 'culture' has become increasingly acceptable as a term to describe the means by which nonhuman primates - especially great apes, especially chimps - live. While the authors contest some details of other scenarios concerning the origin and development of culture (pp. 276 ff.), they agree that it lies significantly within the domain of the great apes. A good number of primatologists who watch monkeys will disagree as I outline further below. Generalizing at different taxonomie levels (subfamily versus genus) unnec- essarily confuses the phylogenetic inquiry. Further distortion is possible when categories as vast as "apes," "cebus," and "macaque" (p. 54), or even worse "monkeys" (e.g., p. 121) are used when discriminating cognitive abilities. The text on p. 265 says that Table 9-4 will compare macaques, great apes, humans, and hominid teeth with developmental stages, but does not. There are no ho- minids in the table, yet reference is made to the table for Homo "erectines" (a vague and generalized nomenclature). The point of the table is to compare dental development with cognitive stages. The capuchins are important to the develop- ment of the argument on heterochrony (but are not in the table), since their abili- ties, being out of phase with the rest of the New World monkeys as well as the Old World monkeys, suggest they represent convergent evolution in this regard. This would then constitute further proof of the argument as a regularity of the evolutionary process as apparent in the primate clade. Had the authors looked fur- ther for material on capuchins, they would have found data that would have made this argument somewhat more tentative. Galliari (1985) found that molars in cap- tive Cebus apella erupt at around one year, hence Cebus fall into line with the gradient of development of molars consistent with primate phylogeny but out of line for cognitive development and the correlation with dental development. Moreover, there really isn't enough known yet about the capabilities of other New World monkeys. The review of the literature that appears here does not provide some important material. For example, apes are not the only nonhuman primates who control the direction in which trees are made to sway (p. 208); muruqui mon- keys ( Brachyteles arachnoïdes) sway trees in a particular direction requiring or- chestrated cooperation. Controlling for publication dates after the book went to press, there are ar- ticles on the cognitive abilities of Saimirí sciureus (squirrel monkeys), classified (along with Cebus) within the Family Cebidae, that have impressive cognitive abilities (Olthof et al. 1997). These facts seriously affect some of the conclusions about convergent evolution. What does this do to the theory? Perhaps it is yet one more piece of evidence for 'mosaic evolution' - that recourse for every anomaly found. In chapter 12 the authors expend a lot of energy refuting Stephen J. Gould, finally focusing on his view of evolutionary processes as 'luck,' namely, random events concatenating. Yet their description of heterochrony, once various aspects of development are decoupled from one another creating the mosaic effect, be- gins to read like randomness. After reading the careful exegesis on heterochrony in the early chapters, the reader becomes confused when in the final pages the au-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews I All thors state: "Developmental mechanisms that cause terminal extension are often heterochronic" (p. 350). But in the careful presentation of heterochrony, they were precise in explaining that terminal extension is another phrase for peramor- phosis, and peramorphosis is one of the two categories of heterochrony. Of course, mental abilities may also have developed in 'mosaic' fashion, which would make scenario-building of what must have occurred somewhat more diffi- cult. What's more, why would not some abilities be paedomorphic, some per- amorphic? Would not the ability to continue to play into adulthood (a consistent feature in primate evolution) depend on the retardation of growth of joint and muscles (paedomorphic processes) as well as the extension of the 'playfulness' (peramorphic ones)? Recent studies (e.g., Rapport 1999) suggest neuronal plas- ticity cogent to this issue. At the very end of the book (p. 348), the authors agree that "none of this is new," as they list the four basic premises of their book, which recapitulate Bon- ner's formulation (1988). Then what is the purpose of the book? Perhaps it is in- tended as heuristic: much of what is suggested is based on insufficient evidence (e.g., the Cebus issue above). The supposition that all members of a species behave similarly is an a pri- ori permitting of these kinds of generalizations, yet there is no evidence to sup- port this contention. The conditions of study also will affect performance (p. 204). There is appropriate sensitivity to nonhuman primates as personal entities: recognizing that something about self could affect objectives tests. "We suggest that some great apes may be shy or embarrassed by the mark and avoid touching it" (p. 155). This affinity is not extended to monkeys (Figure 2.2), where bore- dom, fear, or cold are not controlled for in lab subjects. The strongest parts of the book are indeed interpretations and citation of observations on common chim- panzees in the wild, from which anecdotal material the authors make conclusions on actual mental abilities in apes (p. 132). Yet (p. 214) there is nothing in this summary of 'naturalistic behaviors' that is exclusive to higher cognitive powers as exemplified by chimps; nor is there anything in the compendium known from field workers that requires a Piagetian frame. Deception, for example, is an evi- dence of theory of mind. It is clearly seen in apes, and that information is re- viewed (p. 159) but not accepted for monkeys, since . . . "only great apes have de- veloped symbolic-level Machiavellian Strategies" (p. 277). Yet recent findings attest to this ability in monkeys too (e.g., Worden 1996). Social reciprocity is the sine qua non of group living. Indeed, the material in Table 6.4 is not exclusive to chimps: macaques classify male from female; old from young; stranger from pack (Burton 1984). The behavior of young animals is remembered by others well into adulthood, where it forms the basis for social pat- terns, including 'dominance', mating, friendship, and revenge. The activities of the Piagetian 'steps' (Table 2-6) do not correspond to behavior seen in the wild - the discussion of cognition, therefore, does not readily permit identification for the field worker (p. 39).</page><page sequence="4">478 / Book Reviews The historical appraisal of primate cognition is best reviewed in this con- text. The correct date for the establishment of the regional primate centers by Act of Congress is 1961. At least four more years elapsed before the centers physical- ly existed. Significantly, this date places primatology in the middle of the decade in which the debate concerning ethology as a functional explanation for behavior burgeons. This is the period when nonhuman primates in the field are described, and when the debate over field work versus captive studies becomes articulated (Burton 1994). The historical review is symptomatic of the choice of researchers to follow throughout the text: while one or two have had a little field work, often limited to one species of nonhuman primate (e.g., Russon), the majority have not studied even free-ranging apes let alone monkeys. There is a vast literature from field workers who have considered the cognitive abilities of nonhuman primates in their context. This distinction between captive and wild, and between monkey and ape is not minor. In the presentation of primatology and its history, three forms of anthropomorphism are identified, yet the salient "negative" anthropo- morphism is not included. Here, primatologists are concerned with the incorrect nonattribution of characteristic or ability to a primate because it is not human. Is there not a degree of anthropomorphism in expecting nonhuman primates to per- form on human tasks? The authors cite research on 'cebus' which are trained to point with the hand - a gesture beyond their usual repertoire. Once the nonnative behavior is acquired the test can commence. Anthropomorphism takes many forms, one of which is the nonattribution of abilities where they do actually exist (p. 156). The issue concerns the viewer's focus. This problem raises the question of who is the audience for this book? Recent publications - books, let alone jour- nal articles - on this subject, as the authors carefully point out, are legion. If the purpose is to present the hypothesis on 'adultification' process, why the introduc- tory reviews? If the book is for a lay audience, or beginners in the debate on the origins of intelligence, is the book not too complex? As for the errors, I sample only a few and have filed the 'typos' and refer- encing errors with the editor: I personally have a problem with some neologisms, such as "apeocentric" (p. 11). References are often out of date (e.g., Oakley 1959; Passingham 1975 for brain anatomy [before magnetic imaging!]). The use, for example (p. 30), of "many studies" with no citations is disturbing, especially in the context of Piagetian studies, which have been so amply criticized. Again, on p. 121, "Reviews of social learning in monkeys . . ." but there are no reviews. More seriously, perhaps, are errors of fact: 1. The Clever Hans Effect (p. 10) was not an "anthropomorphic interpreta- tion" (p. 10). Pfungst showed in his remarkable studies on the phenome- non that what occurred was a matter of cuing not interpretation. The communication from human to horse was done by varying muscular ten- sion and facial expression. 2. According to findings of 1999, Australopithecines, at least those found</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews / 479 at 2.3 mya in Hadar, were using flake tools of stone (Roche et al. 1999) and an elaborate as well as technologically diverse tool assemblage. Hence the stasis hypothesis - little cognitive development over eons - seems less tenable. 3. The supposition that selective pressure for bipedalism came from the need to transport objects (p. 295) is perhaps less plausible than the cur- rent thermal scenario. 4. The encephalization quotient (p. 322) is now commonly used as a mod- el allowing the statistical estimation of "expected" brain size, given body size (Foley and Lee 1991). 5. Chapter 7 is a basic introduction to the nonhuman primates that exem- plifies the need for a good editor! It is rife with typographical errors and simple spelling mistakes; worse, there are some serious errors of fact and inappropriate referencing. Spelling: Morroco for Morocco; Cat- tarhine for Catarrhine (p. 217) Callithrixidae for Callitrichidae (p. 218). Why is Tuttle's 1986 taxonomy used concerning a subject that is dy- namic and constantly under revision? One of the more widely accepted modern taxonomies is Colin Groves (in Burton 1995). H. lar has been known not to be monogamous for over half a decade. Why is there no reference for the rafting hypothesis (p. 218)? Life history variables are of varying utility as a species indicator. Interbirth interval, for example, is labile, depending on population density and resources.
