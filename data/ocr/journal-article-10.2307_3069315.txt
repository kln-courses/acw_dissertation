STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the for- mat and language to use when preparing manu- scripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A different document, "Information for Contributors" (front of each issue or http://aom. pace.edu/amj/submission.html) describes desir- able content. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu. Follow the "Instructions for Electronic Submission" (http://aom.pace.edu/ amj/electronic.html). Full articles should not ordinarily exceed 40 manuscript pages, including references, appen- dixes, tables, and figures. Research notes should not ordinarily exceed 25 pages. Manuscript Format AMJ is not printed directly from your file. Ac- cepted manuscripts are copy-edited and retyped. You can help this process go smoothly by following these steps: Type and spacing. Use at least 12-point type. Double-space references, endnotes, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures. Double-space everything except quotes more than seven lines long. Indent these as a block. Use wide margins of an inch or more. Don't vary type size-stick with 12-point. Never underline- use italic (for occasional emphasis; names of books and periodicals; certain statistics; and as illustrated under "Citations" and "References," below). Saving. When you save your file, use the option "Embed true-type fonts" (pull down "tools," go to "general options"). Put in hard page breaks be- tween parts of the manuscript, as described in "Back Pages," below. Front Pages Your title page is page 1. Please number it. Address. Under the title of your work, list au- thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCET.ENT STUDY A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Famous University Special Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu The details of your address will not appear in AMJ, but we need them to keep in touch with you. Keep the editor's office informed about job changes and long absences. Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note (double-spaced) at the bottom of page 1. Abstract. Your abstract and the title of the work go on page 2. Your abstract should be about 75 words long. Back Pages Group any endnotes, references, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Put hard page breaks between these parts. For instance, the refer- ences should begin on a new page, and every table should begin on a new page. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Main headings designate your major sections; three or four main headings should be enough in most cases. Center your main headings and type them in all capitals. Example: METHODS Second-level headings follow. Type these flush with the left margin, beginning only major words with capitals. Examples: Data and Sample Indent third-level headings. Begin the first word with a capital, end the heading with a period, and continue with your text. Example: Manager sample. Respondents consisted of a random sample of 300 managers... First sample: Bank managers. Respondents consist- ed ... 827</page><page sequence="2">Academy of Management Journal The headings indicate a hierarchy of sections. Sections with main headings precede those with second-level headings, which precede those with third-level headings. Do not skip a step and launch directly into a section with a second-level heading. When you divide a section, use two or more subsections. For instance, a main section needs at least two second-level sections (or none). Second- level sections should be at least a page long. Hypotheses Begin each hypothesis on its own indented line. Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number or num- ber-letter label. Example: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation- ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au- thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Special Words Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key tech- nical terms, both conceptual and analytical ones. A technical term is a word that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Quotes can replace defining for technical terms that are not key to your work. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names-not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Endnotes Do not use footnotes-use endnotes. Please use these sparingly, and keep them short. Double-space endnotes in 12-point type so that they will be easy to copy edit and typeset. The printer will shrink them. Math Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used chi-squares to evaluate coefficients," not "We used X2s." You can report statistical results using symbols in parentheses. And, unlike the rest of your manu- script, results in parens and equations should be formatted as thoroughly as possible. Use italic as customary-for p, r, b, F, z, and so forth. Use bold italic for vectors; use Greek letters and other needed symbols. Display and number only equations you mention again in your work. Sexist and Biased Language Avoid language that might be interpreted as den- igrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-estab- lished customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager ... he"), can imply gender- based discrimination. Using plural pronouns- changing "the manager . .he" to "managers... they"-usually helps. Active Voice and First Person Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you yourself did: Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). [Passive] Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. [Active] The author developed three new items. [third person] I developed three new items. [first person] Anthropomorphism Avoid describing inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Because tables and figures are more expensive to prepare for pub- lication than text, please carefully consider what each adds to your work. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG- URE" with a number (1, 2, etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered at the top. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se- ries for tables, one for figures). Group your tables and figures at the end of the manuscript as de- scribed under "Back Pages" above. Indicate the po- sition of each in the text as follows: 828 June</page><page sequence="3">Volume 45, Number 2 Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. Tables Look at tables in published AMJs that report the type of analysis you are reporting. Imitate them. But use more than one page if you need to. Do not squeeze material onto one page. Our basic table principle is that each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title) and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Label what you are presenting across the top or down the side-not in the body. For variable names, use ordinary words, not abbreviations, and avoid parentheses. Report only two decimal places for statistics. In correlation matrixes, the correlations should fill the lower-left corner of the table. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small letters. Significance levels can be summarized in a let- tered footnote ("aAll values greater than ...."). Or use this format, with every level on a separate line: tp&lt; .10 * p &lt; .05 ** p&lt; .01 *** p&lt; .001 Figures Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. Our printer scans in figures directly from your manuscript. So make sure your figures will print out crisp and clear. Avoid "stacking"-write all words horizontally, not vertically. Use the same variable names you use in the text. Do not abbreviate. Look at figures in published AMJs for format ideas. Citations Citations are your in-text identifications of other research. Minimize self-citations that would reveal your manuscript's authorship. Doing this is impor- tant for protecting the double-blind review process. To cite, enclose authors' names and the year of a work in parentheses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a, 1976b) support this conclusion. Order citations alphabetically. Two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year should have "a," "b," etc., added after the year. If a work has no human author(s), cite the peri- odical it is in as the author: (Wall Street Journal, 1990) or cite the "corporate author" that produced it: "... forecasts of increasing service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Com- merce, 1992)... To cite a direct quotation, give pages after the year, separated from it by a colon. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). Also cite page numbers when you paraphrase or summarize others' specific arguments or findings. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." Examples: Few field studies use random assignment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). (first citation) ... even when random assignment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). (subsequent citation) For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the matching reference should give all the authors.) References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list includes only work you have cited. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Order works by an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differen- tiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat author's name for each entry. Book entries follow this form: Authors' or Ed- itors' Last Names, Initials. Year. Title of book. (Italic, lowercase except for the first letter of the first word and the first word after a long dash or colon).
