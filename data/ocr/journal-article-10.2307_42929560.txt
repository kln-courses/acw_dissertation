It has been generally held by scholars that the Šaivism of to-day is a product of the Aryo-Dravidian culture-contact. But according to the author of this work all the available evidence definitely points out that the' attributes which are con- sidered to be the hall-marks of Dravidism are the products of the " natural evolu- tion " of the elements present from the beginning in the Vedic religion. The im- portant aspects of the author's thesis may be presented forthwith : - There can be no doubt the demoniacal qualities of Rudra which can be traced in&lt; the Vedas. In his beneficent activities his identity with Agni played a larger part in converting him into the later Siva , the auspicious. It may be also noted that with regard to the disposal of the dead amongst the Indo- Aryans this identity of Rudra with Agni facilitated the transition from burial to cremation. The important aspects of Siva's personal appearance may also be traced to the Vedic period ; e.g. his three eyes, his hide-skin, blue neck etc. The fact that Rudra was a god of death can easily explain how the present deity came to be adorned with the garland of skulls. Siva's mountain habitation is on mount Kailãsa ; but originally it was on mount Müjavat ; and Siva got the moon on his matted hair because on this mountain soma grew in abundance and soma was identified with the moon already. Siva's relation to the Ganges is due partly to his connection with mountains and partly to Iranian influences. The instance of Persian Anāhitā sug- gests! that the legend of the descent of the Ganges may be a reminiscence of a forgotten cultural contact between the twoi peoples. As to Siva's accoutrement one is particularly reminded of the Assyrian deity Assur ; for both Siva and Assur were solar deities and display many features common to both. "Whether theses simi- larities were accidental or due to some long-forgotten contact between the two gods can hardly be determined at present " (cp. page 29) . As to Siva's associa- tion with the bull-vehicle the fact is that Rudra was originally a bull-god and when " anthropomorphic representations of divine beings became common the ori- ginal bull-form was driven into the background and the bull was henceforth regarded as a symbol or vehicle of Rudra" (page 31). The various names of Siva can be easily explained from references in the Vedic literature. The names Bhava and Sarva deserve special notice. Sarva was a popular Iranian deity, but was later merged into Rudra. Siva's connection with linga is generally attributed to non-Aryan, particularly Dravitjian, contact. Expressions such as šisna-deva and " nose-less dãms " which occur in the early Vedic literature are put forth as evidence to support the con- nection. The identification of " nose-less dãms " with Dravidians is manifestly wrong ; for the so-called Dravidians are not nose-less and the " nose-less " Däsas were in conflict with the Indo- Aryans already before their entry into India, some- where near the Caspian sea. Again the interpretation of sisna as a phallic emblem is still open to doubt. Archaeologists claim that they have unearthed the " Dravi- dian" civilisation of the pre-Vedic - and hence pre- Aryan - period in the Indus valley, where they think they have found cogent proof of the existence of linga cult. But there is no foundation for such a claim. The script of the Indus valley is still to be satisfactorily deciphered ; the racial affinities of the Indus people are still to be traced and there are no authentic proofs to regard the Indus civilisation as pre-Vedic. Again strictly speaking no specimens of Unga , properly so called, have been so far discovered ini the Indus cities ; and the phallic stones found there may be regarded as symbols fore-shadowing the advent of the full-blown cult of linga. There is no justification for the belief that the Indus people were not Aryans and the contention that the phallic worship was abhorrent to the Aryan religious sentiment is equally unjustified, The phallic emblem grew naturally out</page><page sequence="2">404 REVIEWS of the sacrificial cult and the cult of the phallus is the " natural product of the evolution of primitive ideas inherent in the Aryan religion from the beginning" (page 55). With regard to Rudra's family it should be noted that Ambikā was primarily a deity of death along with her brother or husband, Rudra. The origin of the cult of the mother-goddess may be attributed to some non- Aryan race, but in India the Aryans brought it. The other proto-type of Indian Durgā or Ambikā was Ishtar, the great goddess of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Both the goddesses resemble each other in many respects. " It is obvious that the cult of the mother- goddess was introduced into India by the Aryans who seem to have adopted it from the Babylonians when they still inhabited the countries in the neighbourhood of Mesopotamia" (page 70). Ever since the Indus civilisation had been discovered the problem of the origin of Šaivism has assumed a new interest for the scholars of the religious history of India. The late Sir R. G. Bhandarkar wrote his famous work before this remark- able discovery in Indian archaeology was made. A reorientation on the history of šaivism had certainly been felt. Dr. Venkataramanayya brings forth such a re- orientation on the subject but to his thesis the Indus civilisation is of no great significance. We have already given the summary of his views above. According to him Šaivism was part and parcel of the Aryan religious heritage and nothing need be attributed to the non-Aryans of India nor to the Dravidians which according to him is a doubtful racial designation for the peoples of South India. He tries to trace the passage of Šaivism right from the Caspian sea to the north-west frontiers of India along with' the Indo- Aryans who brought it with them into India. What- ever of Šaivism we see in later times was evolved naturally from what was inherited about Rudra- Ši va either from the Aryan ancestors or from their neighbours out- side India. The author states that " the home of Rudra was in some foreign country into the north probably of the Mūjavats and Mahāvr§as " (page 22). Are we to suppose from this that the country " foreign " to the Vedic Aryans was also " foreign " according to the present geographical situation of India ? No attempt is made to ascertain as to who these Mūjavats and Mahiâvrças were. Again the god Rudra occupies a subordinate position in the Rgveda being celebrated in only three entire hymns while his name , occurs only 75 times in the Rgveda. From the Rgvedic Rudra we are not reminded much abouť any Babylonian and Assyrian resemblance^ and it is difficult to see with the author the origins of the various complex aspects of Šaivism in some country outside India âmply on grounds of resemblances. The discoveries of the Indus Valley and the religion of the people indicated by them do not baffle the author much ; for in the absence of any conclusive evi- dence as to the antiquity of this civilisation he is not prepared to call it pre-Vedic. His arguments regarding this antiquity resemble those of Dr. N. N. Law (cp. IHQ.f VIII, p. 121 ff.&gt;. The fact that the Indus culture shows certain affinities with the Sumerian civilisation and the fact that no other archaeological discoveries of the historical periods of India can be properly related to the Indus culture are commended to the author's attention. Vaisņavism and Šaivisiri are the two sides of the Hindu religious culture-complex of post-Vedic times. In the Indus remains we get, if not actual evidences, at least resemblances with the Šaivite ideas, but we find nothing of Vaisņavism. Thus in assigning post-Vedic antiquity to the Indu9 civilisation we will be called upon to answer many objections, the more so when we, with the author, take it to be an Aryan achievement. It does not seem that Dr, Venkataramanayya has given us any definite opinion on this matter,</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 405 There is no such thing as an Aryan race in India to-day. The possibility of gradual racial fusion of the in-coming Aryans with the indigenous population can hardly be objedted to. There is every ground for belief that the indigenous population of the country did not succumb to Aryanisation without leaving their stamp on the " Aryan culture ". This aspect of the question has been completely overlooked by the author. He apparently overlooks the fact that there are many primitive tribes in India even to-day whose religious practices deserve to be com- pared with some of the prominent aspects of Saivism. He is aware of Babylonian, Assyrian or Iranian culture-contact when he seeks to trace the origin of the cult of the mother-goddess or of Siva's accoutrement or of his mountain habitation, lie draws much upon resemblances or common features but fails to establish any connecting links of influence. To say only from resemblances or common features that the Aryans before entering the borders of India might have assimilated this or that element of Saivism the existence of which becomes manifest only in very later times is not sufficient. Strong proof is required for such assumptions and the author does not convince us in this respect. And one may request him to explain how the Rudra-Siva worship which was only in the corner of the Vedic religious superstructure and some of the dominant elements of which were bor- rowed from the Babylonians or Assyrians should have become so widely prevalent in very later times. The author says that the earliest method adopted by the Aryans to dispose of their dead was burial and that Rudra's identity with Agni prepared a ground for the introduction of the practice of cremation amongst the Vedic Aryans. He has unnecessarily brought into discussion a problem over which there is ground for much controversy. An archaeologist like Childe would tell us that a fuller knowledge of the available evidence " reveals that cremation presents a much more compli- cated problem than is generally imagined. In fact " this rite is intimately bound up with the Aryan problem It was widely distributed amongst the Indo- European peoples and its adoption by a particular Aryan group is a problem by itself which has so far defied any satisfactory solution. The simple solution sug- gested by Dr. Venkataramanayya for its adoption by the Vedic Aryans carries little conviction for he does not seem to have considered the full implications of the problem. Whatever the point of view of the author, there is no doubt that he has brought a reorientation on this subject. His treatment of the subject under the various aspects of Saivism is certainly commendable. A study of Vaiçijavismi on the same lines would also be welcome. Dr. Venkataramanayya's attempt serves a timely warning against a tendency to hold the " Dravidians " responsible for everything that has appeared in the Hindu culture of later times as being "abhor- rent to the Aryan religious sentiment", whatever be the case about the origin and development of Saivism.
