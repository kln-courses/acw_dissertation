<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wildlife Management on Your Land. By C.L. Cadieux. 1985. Stackpole Books, Cameron and Kelker Streets, Harrisburg, PA 17105. 310 pp. $29.95 The strengths of Wildlife Management on Your Land-the author's personal writing style and 30 years of professional experience- are also its weaknesses. Cadieux's homey, down-to-earth style is overly simplistic at times and certainly anthropomorphic at others. Also, it is apparent that much of Cadieux's experience has been on the central plains, which results in an uneven treatment of the species covered by the book. This does not mean that there is not a wealth of information, folklore, and even darn good recipes in the book, but rather it suggests that the casual reader may be fed some nonfactual material and unless he/ she shares the same predilection for game species as does the author, will be disappointed in the virtual absence of management prescriptions for unhunted animals (only 8 pages devoted to non-game birds). While florid statements like "the young grouse's fancy (turns) to thoughts of love...." (pg. 53) may be colorful though anthropo- morphic, others such as "the powdered antler probably does nothing for the Chinaman's love life..." ( pg. 241) border on the distasteful. Coupled with errors of omission and commission, this book presents a "roller coaster" of high and low points to the reader. Generally the material presented is factual, though highly biased to the Mid-west, but many scientists would challenge state- ments such as there is no evidence that closing canvasback seasons will aid the population (pgs. 8 and 102), or that there is no sound nutritional data on coprophagy (mispelled as copraphagy in the text), or that tularemia is not a problem in cold weather (pg. 150), and others. Also perpetuated is the myth that the Conibear trap is an instant killer (pg. 155). Trappers know, and recent scientific studies have confirmed, that the commercial Conibear series is often too under- powered to quickly dispatch many of its target species. Well, by now anyone reading this review will have decided that I hated the book, but that wasn't the case. I thoroughly enjoyed Cadieux's candor and his anecdotal comments, e.g., if you want to reduce soil erosion do the opposite of what the Army Corps of Engineers does (pg. 170). There is also a considerable amount of good management information throughout the book and some telling comments on how some species have been managed (pgs. 102-103). And then there are those recipes!! I would have liked to have seen more detail for the non-hunted species, but in Chapter 15 a list of suggested readings is included which softens this deficiency. The book consists of 20 chapters, the largest (Chapter 3) repres- enting Cadieux's prime interest, upland game birds. Chapter 4 treats migratory waterfowl, Chapter 5 small game animals and Chapters 6-8 look at fishes, farm ponds, and fish farming. Big game is examined in Chapters 9-11 and Chapters 12-20 are very short and touch on some topics as predator control, crawfish farming, trapping, and wildlife censusing. In summary, if you are looking for light reading with useful management information and a wealth of personal experience presented in a crusty open fashion, Cadieux's book will be your "cup of tea" or "brandy." However, if you are expecting a scientifi- cally detailed approach to wildlife management, you had best look elsewhere.-Frederick F. Gilbert, Wildlife Biology, Pullman, Washington.</page></plain_text>
