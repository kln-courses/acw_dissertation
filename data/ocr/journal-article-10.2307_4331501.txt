Drickamer, eds., Foundations of Animal Behavior: Classic Papers with Commentaries (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), xvi + 843 pp., illus., $95.00, $34.95 (paper). Foundations of Animal Behavior: Classic Papers with Commentaries is an anthology of writings in the field of animal behavior, from Charles Darwin's chapter on "Instinct" in the Origin to Robert Trivers's landmark 1972 paper "Parental Investment and Sexual Selection." The collection is thematically organized in six parts: historical origins, goals and methods, learning and instinct, physiological underpinnings, senses and communication, and evolu- tion of behavior. Each part is introduced with an extensive commentary on the selected papers and on other relevant literature. This collection is invaluable both as a reader and reference source to every student of animal behavior. Despite limitations consequent on having to exclude important work, it comprises an excellent collection of papers. It is an eclectic anthology not only thematically, as its organization suggests, but also in its distribution of theoretical and empirical papers, as well as in the range of species the papers investigate. The anthology recognizes the influence of behaviorism on the biological study of animal behavior by including excerpts from E. L. Thorndike's and J. B. Watson's work. It also pays tribute to the theme of anthropomorphism, with a chapter from George Romanes's Animal Intelligence and a brief discussion by Bennett Galef in his commentary on the historical section. Other seminal authors included are the founders of ethol- ogy, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen; forerunner Wallace Craig and critic Daniel Lehrman; Karl von Frisch and Donald Griffin, whose discov- eries of honey bee language and bat perception were groundbreaking; and William Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith with equally consequential theoretical breakthroughs. It would be remiss not to appreciate the difficulties in selecting a set of seminal papers, from a period spanning Darwin's inception of the study of animal behavior to the present. The editors' objective was to compile, in a single volume, papers that had a major impact in behavioral research. In their introductory remarks, they discuss the difficulty in selecting such a set of landmark papers. Their original set - compiled with the help of six researchers in the field of animal behavior - included two hundred papers. They eliminated 80 percent, leaving a total of forty-four papers in the selec- tion. The editors state that "brief thoughts" to put together a five-volume set were replaced by a "sense of reality." One can only conjecture that the "sense of reality" has to do with financial considerations that pervade the publish- ing world. Yet a multivolume set of papers, titled Foundations of Animal</page><page sequence="2">456 THE J. H. B. BOOKSHELF Behavior, might have been preferable to forcing this encompassing title on a subset of a proper selection. The editors used time-period constraints as a winnowing criterion, for thirty-nine of the forty-four pieces included were published between the 1940s and 1970s. (But for the inclusion of five historical pieces, the volume might more accurately have been called Classic Papers in Animal Behavior with Commentaries, 1940 to 1970.) There is a deliberate omission of early- twentieth-century works. The anthology also does not reflect changes in the study of animal behavior with the advent of sociobiology, behavioral ecology, and cognitive ethology. The strategy of compiling writings almost strictly from the period 1940 to 1970 is an efficient means for delimiting the volume's scope. Yet what is excluded by this time frame has consequences vis-a-vis what is proposed as the foundations of the study of behavior. This volume depicts the science of animal behavior in a particular way, and its ambitious title invites critical scrutiny of that depiction. My critical comments, however, should not be taken to undermine its contribution. The anthology portrays the study of behavior as a relatively homogenous enterprise, namely, a collection of aims, methods, discoveries, and theoretical problems. However, a more robust historical representation, inclusive of the early-twentieth-century and post-mid-i 970s eras, would disclose the study of animal behavior to be more heterogeneous and tumultuous in its trajecto- ries. The volume also emphasizes standardized and reproducible quantitative methodologies in the study of behavior. Given this emphasis, the exclusion of naturalists like Jean Henri Fabre or Jane Goodall - whose investigations are more akin to ethnographies of animal life - seems to involve more than space considerations. Rather, knowledge based on measurements and mathematical operations is represented as superior to - or perhaps less idiosyncratic than - naturalists' intimate, and sometimes anecdotal, descriptions of animal life. Focusing on the 1940-1970 period, when the influence of behaviorism was most pronounced, goes hand in hand with a stand against anthro- pomorphism and the anecdotal method endorsed in the volume. In this regard, choosing not to reproduce excerpts from Darwin's Descent of Man or The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals is telling, for in these works anthropomorphic language and anecdotes abound. The commentator's remark (in the introduction to the historical section) that this was an "unfor- tunate lapse" ignores that Darwin's linguistic and argumentative style was a deliberate means to press home the message of evolutionary continuity between animals and humans. The exclusion of the early prominent figures Julian Huxley and von Uexkull, whose writings on animal life are colorful and even lyrical, underscores the representation of scientific language that is nonidiosyncratic and free of the perceived fallacies of subjectivity and</page><page sequence="3">THE J. H. B. BOOKSHELF 457 singularity. Moreover, without samples of sociobiology and cognitive ethol- ogy, the more receptive contemporary attitude toward anthropomorphism and anecdote is not reflected. It is not my intention to rebuke the anthology's perspective on the long- standing themes of anthropomorphism and anecdote recounting. Rather, the preclusion of a language of subjectivity and of findings that cannot be gener- alized reflects a demurral to appreciate that these are issues endemic and unique to the study of animals. In the interest of showing how foundational studies of behavior are scientific like any natural science - homogeneous, quantitative, and untainted by subjective language or the singular datum - the volume has in part sacrificed the ways that the science of animal behavior has been like no other.
