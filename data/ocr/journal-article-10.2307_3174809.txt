By the tenth or twentieth gen- eration it is changed out of recognition-into a set of conventions, which place more confidence in the founders than they ever had in themselves and privilege them above all later visionaries. From the volatile and un- certain realm of direct experience, the vision has entered ordinary life, where comfort and stability are higher values than imagination and risk.

In ordinary life, the first imperative is that parents protect their chil- dren. Since they cannot protect them very well-and least of all from the nearest danger, the force of a parent's personality-they often end by protecting them from the force of culture, from the very arts and visions and speculations that might finally make them equal to the founders. Religious authorities are generally happy to cooperate in this project by concealing the more ambiguous currents of their own traditions, since this consolidates their authority and discourages latter-day visionaries from disrupting the status quo. Religious energies, which are freshly available to each new generation, tend to be contained and narrowed by hierarchies intent on controlling the definition of religion. Eventually this narrowing process results in generations of people growing up securely within a religious tradition while knowing very little about it-and often having very little feel for any kind of spiritual life. They take their doc- trines at the literal level (and if they seek to reform them, or deny them, do so at the literal level) and are seldom aware of any other possible responses. There are, of course, religious traditions that do better-that encourage the full development of each person's spiritual life and powers-but in the West these have been marginalized, either socially (as in the Afro-Caribbean religions) or theologically (as in Christian and Jewish mysticism). The West, on the whole, has preferred clergy and laity to fully competent human beings. Feminist spirituality has, for the most part, emerged from within this limiting milieu. As a result, its discourse and creative energies are gener- ally focused on the public and liturgical rather than the private and speculative. Feminists in religion have objected to misogynist doctrines, sexist practices in religious hierarchies, and liturgical language that is skewed toward the masculine; or they have left the mainstream and tried to devise or recover religions that do not put women in second place. But the men whose policies they are protesting (whether by reform or by exodus) often have such a superficial understanding of their own religions that they are scarcely worthy opponents, and in addition have often done a very bad job of transmitting religious knowledge and sensibility to women who are seeking it. This state of affairs tends to put much femi- nist religious discourse at a rather low level-Should we speak of God or Goddess? Should we situate ourselves in or out of the institutions? Is it more womanly to speak of the divine in maternal and pacific terms than in male and dangerous ones?-rather than freeing women to consider their actual relations with the universe and to construct their practice not in reaction to exclusion and mistreatment but in response to direct study Winter 1994 SIGNS 481</page><page sequence="3">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION and thought. (Under "study," perhaps I should add, I include direct ob- servation of bodily and spiritual states and the active development of personal and political ethics, not simply the more traditional study of philosophies and sacred texts.) It is difficult to imagine feminist spiritu- ality, in any of its current forms, attracting a major thinker from a secular background-to envision a mind the stature of, say, Simone Weil's being struck to fire by it; since it is mainly concerned with healing the wounds of women within religion, it has as yet very little positive content to offer women in search of religion. Still, the global extent of contemporary feminism and the high intelligence of the women involved may make it possible for the next generation, or the next, to generate such content- as long as feminists in religion are not merely imposing a new set of conventions but creating the conditions for vision. Of recent books in the field, I find Judith Plaskow and Carol P. Christ's anthology Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality one of the most encouraging. Building on their earlier work in Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion, Plaskow and Christ have collected a variety of work that gives the widest possible definition of "spiritual- ity."' Oddly-since nearly all of the selections are reprinted from other sources-the book seems to be more than the sum of its parts; perhaps this is because it includes work that was not originally intended as femi- nist theology (such as Audre Lorde's important essay "Uses of the Erotic," the title chapter of Alice Walker's The Color Purple, and an excerpt from Susan Griffin's Woman and Nature). By expanding the definition beyond the narrowly theological, Plaskow and Christ have in a sense moved the center of the discussion: the National Council of Churches' Inclusive Language Lectionary is no more normative than Luisah Teish's Yoruba ancestor rituals, and Dhyani Ywahoo, a spiritual teacher trained in the venerable Cherokee tradition, is not outranked by an established academic like Rosemary Radford Ruether. Women from a fairly wide range of backgrounds and cultures (some of which accord more respect to female power than the American mainstream) are given the chance to define the bounds of spiritual life. Thus an essay like Beverly Wildung Harrison's "The Power of Anger in the Work of Love" is given breathing space-not confined to the realm of Christian moral theology, but put in its broader context of feminist moral thinking. Es- says on psychology and philosophy are also given a place-for example, Naomi Goldenberg's critique of psychoanalysis, which praises Freud (despite his faults) for his insistence on the continuity of physical and intellectual experience, and Catherine Keller's critique of the feminist 1 Carol P. Christ and Judith Plaskow, eds., Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1979). 482 SIGNS Winter 1994</page><page sequence="4">WOMEN IN RELIGION Madsen "ethic of inseparability" and Simone de Beauvoir's feminist existential- ism in each other's terms. The breadth and overall sophistication of the anthology give a sense of what feminist spirituality (and spirituality in general) can be when common ground for discussion takes precedence over categorization. Another anthology, After Patriarchy: Feminist Transformations of World Religions, edited by Paula M. Cooey, William R. Eakin, and Jay B. McDaniel, stays within the traditional religious categories-except for Emily Culpepper's account of her transformation from Southern Protes- tant to freethinker-but offers untraditional approaches to them: Judith Plaskow's rethinking of Judaism (which I will consider in more detail below); Rita Gross's critique of Buddhist practice; Cooey's recovery of neglected positive images of the body in Christian tradition; and Riffat Hassan's analysis of Islamic misogyny in terms of its own Qur'anic ethic. Delores S. Williams's account of black American women's "surrogacy experience" as mammies, slaves, and servants suggests that the Christian ideal of vicarious suffering is not a redemptive image for those perma- nently consigned to such a state against their will. Lina Gupta and Inez Talamantez provide material of value from their traditions: Gupta in a detailed essay on Kali, the Hindu goddess who combines violence and nurturance (qualities considered antithetical by many Western feminists), and Talamantez in a presentation of young Apache women's practical and ceremonial preparation for powerful roles in an egalitarian culture. (The latter essay is worth a serious look by mothers and teachers of young women: the lack of such preparation in the dominant culture is surely at the root of many young women's miseries.) Studies in fields other than theology can throw unexpected light on women's position in religion. Clarissa W. Atkinson's The Oldest Voca- tion: Christian Motherhood in the Middle Ages is a historical study of the processes that shaped Catholic and Protestant attitudes toward birth and mothering. As such, it may serve as an introduction to much of the other recent literature, which often makes use of motherhood either as an attribute of the Goddess or as a model for reformulating religious ethics and relationships. Atkinson shows that the Christian construction of motherhood (and thus of women's position in general) has shifted radi- cally over time. One of her central points is that motherhood has never been simply "natural," but is always historically conditioned: she notes that "to recognize its historicity is to begin to assume responsibility for the character of its reconstruction" (246) in an age when women can take a conscious and public role in the process. Atkinson's deeply absorbing book contains as much physiological his- tory as ecclesiastical, drawing on ancient Greek and medieval gyneco- logical manuals, Plato's theory of the "wandering womb," and Aristotle's Winter 1994 SIGNS 483</page><page sequence="5">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION notion (later adopted by Aquinas, who is still cited in Catholic arguments against women's ordination) that men are normative and women defec- tive; fortunately the theorists were seldom practitioners, and the manuals are mostly concerned with practical matters (including the observation that working women were stronger than "ladies"). Atkinson is intrigued by the demographic shift from a preponderantly male population to a preponderantly female one in eleventh-century Europe: evidence from church census records strongly suggests female infanticide in poor fami- lies, but female mortality in general shifted at this point, possibly because of the introduction of iron cooking pots-which (along with the greater availability of meat) would have relieved the widespread anemia that contributed to women's death from blood loss. Clearly, medical and social considerations are interwoven in some unexpected ways. So, it appears, are social and ecclesiastical considerations: as Atkinson shows, the changes in the church's attitude toward motherhood were made in response to philosophical and economic pressures. The early Christians, expecting the end of days at any moment, were very little concerned with the biological family (Atkinson cites a story of two women so anxious to be thrown to the lions with their comrades that one weaned her infant in time for the occasion and the other gave birth prematurely). Once Christianity became respectable, gender roles and class distinctions were firmly reasserted. But it was a long time before the claims and distractions of family life were considered compatible with holiness. With the church's political ascendancy, asceticism replaced mar- tyrdom as the available source of challenge and spiritual euphoria, and serious religious life was considered so thoroughly incompatible with motherhood that some women left husbands and young children in order to pursue it (and were accepted by the convents, apparently without difficulty). By the late Middle Ages, with the rise of devotion to the Virgin Mary, family and holiness were no longer mutually hostile terms: moth- ers were encouraged to view the sufferings of childbirth and parenthood as purifying, and nuns were having visions of being pregnant with or suckling the infant Jesus. Joseph was rehabilitated as a member of the Holy Family and began to be shown with Jesus and Mary in domestic scenes. During this period there was a certain amount of marriage resis- tance by young women who wished to remain virgins, both in the Be- guine movement and more privately; considering that women could be married as young as eleven, one can see how they might have identified their simple desire for bodily integrity with the church's ideal of holy virginity. Atkinson goes on to demonstrate that the rise of Protestantism, and of middle-class private ownership in place of the feudal economy, pro- foundly changed the concept of the family. It took on the familiar 484 SIGNS Winter 1994</page><page sequence="6">WOMEN IN RELIGION Madsen "nuclear" form, still invoked (though with more and more overtones of a quaint archaism) by American politicians. Marriage was the Protestant institution: there was no Protestant monasticism. Even men were not considered fully respectable unless they married: John Calvin, who did not feel he was suited for marriage, was pressured into it for the sake of his career. And women were forced out of careers-shut out of the guilds and other public work, with domestic service as virtually the sole exception-because "society, religion, and good order" (201) demanded that they marry. For both sexes, parenthood was considered a vocation. The Catholic church, while fiercely defending the value of celibacy, evolved its own theology of marriage in response to the Protestant threat. (Beginning at this point, women who left their children to become nuns were expected to remain "good" mothers while they pursued their vo- cation.) Ironically, and tragically, women outnumbered men; not all could marry even if they wanted to, and work was extremely hard to find. Even midwifery, till then almost entirely a female preserve, was being encroached upon by doctors. "Masterless" women had been problema- tized, and the solution was the witch persecutions. The institution of Christian motherhood, which appears so stable and unchangeable, dates back only about four hundred years and owes its apparent naturalness partly to large-scale torture and murder. I have given only the sketchiest idea of Atkinson's book, which is enor- mously rich in detail; it will be useful in many disciplines. For feminist theology it provides a necessary reminder that the concept of motherhood- human or divine-is subject to historical change and cannot be used uncritically. A culture's construction of motherhood is inevitably linked with its construction of sexuality, contraception, and abortion, and in this con- nection Ginette Paris's cassette The Sacrament of Abortion (1991) is an extremely interesting contemporary view.2 The tape is an interview with Paris by fellow Jungian psychologist James Hillman, whose rather pedes- trian questioning does not manage to obscure her point-blank definition of abortion as a religious act. In her view, the general secularity and individualism of much pro-choice political rhetoric stops short of the psychological truth: that abortion, as a choice between life and death, necessarily has a religious character, and that (as Carol Gilligan also found) women generally make the decision not from an individualistic stance but with some collective good in mind-the size of their families, the state of the world, the extent of their own resources.3 Essentially, in Paris's definition, abortion is one of the varieties of nurturance. 2 Ginette Paris, The Sacrament of Abortion (New York: Spring Audio, 1991). 3 Carol Gilligan, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Develop- ment (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1982). Winter 1994 SIGNS 485</page><page sequence="7">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION What religion permits such a definition? As far as Paris is concerned, only pagan religion (though her analysis of patriarchal monotheism as monolithically opposed to abortion is oversimplified). She gives examples from the Greek myths of Artemis and Aphrodite. Artemis "forbids the hunter to wound an animal instead of killing it"; similarly, a woman may abort a child because she is certain that it would be deeply wounded by the life she has to offer it. Aphrodite represents a sexuality that is legiti- mately "for pleasure," whose mechanisms are a legitimate study and whose purpose may or may not be procreation; in such a construction of sexuality, motherhood cannot be a punishment for pleasure, and should not even be an accidental by-product. Paris insists that motherhood is a responsibility, to be taken on only by women who are willing-that (if there is a pagan concept of "sin") it is "a sin not to abort if you do not want the child." Whether this is or is not an exclusively pagan view, it assumes that a religious person is one who knows how to make mature choices-a view that is not altogether absent in the mainstream tradition, but that is often overshadowed by the view that suffering the accidents of life is holier than working intelligently to prevent them. It is worth pointing out, yet again, the derivation of heresy from the Greek hairesis, "choice"; Paris rightly restores choice to the religious realm, and proposes a construction of motherhood suited to an age not only technological but also spiritual. Sally Cunneen's Mother Church attempts to bring the contemporary feminist construction of motherhood, according to such theorists as Sara Ruddick and Carol Gilligan, to bear upon the institutional Catholic church. Why, she asks, does the ecclesiastical hierarchy so often function like a mother who does not want her children to grow up? How might a reconstruction of the church's "motherhood" improve both private and public life? Cunneen does not hold out much hope for the institution in its present form, but she arrives at interesting recommendations based on the work of students in her community college "mothering classes," who learn the necessity of genuine attention, equable temper, and honest speech. The book ends with a vignette of a personified Mother Church apologizing for her historical mistakes and going into retirement ("Yes, I intend to rejoin my older sister Nature once again" [215]), leaving the people free to question received ideas and make their own choices. It is not altogether clear whether Cunneen thinks the church would (or ought to) persist as a distinct community without the presence of a controlling hierarchy; she is very much concerned with questions of community, but very little with questions of doctrine, so that her ideal community might well cross all the lines of what is usually meant by church. It is also unclear how she thinks the Vatican might react to her suggestion that it 486 SIGNS Winter 1994</page><page sequence="8">WOMEN IN RELIGION Madsen put itself out of business.4 But it is encouraging to see feminist thinking applied in a fairly traditional context; the results bear out Plaskow and Christ's contention (in their introduction to Weaving the Visions [7]) that the distinction between reformist and revolutionary feminist theologies must be judged by subtler criteria than whether the writer works inside or outside of existing institutions. Carol Saussy, in God Images and Self Esteem, has interviewed women working within such an institution-a group of Protestant seminary women-to learn whether new concepts of God are having a helpful effect on women's concepts of themselves. She was "curious about the conflict between religious faith's claims about a God of love and believ- ers' inability to love themselves" (12); she found that many of the women in her sample experienced considerable improvement in self-esteem when they began to define God in their own terms. Not all of their imagery was female, or anthropomorphic; though Saussy herself is inclined to pro- mote Goddess imagery as at least a necessary stage in women's spiritual development, her respondents present a more complicated mix. In fact, what her evidence suggests is that it is really the identification of one's own compelling images of God that heightens self-esteem. Presumably, in a different sample, women who abandoned the notion of God altogether would have a similar experience.5 Theologians from Kierkegaard to Valerie Saiving to Judith Plaskow have suggested that women's besetting "sin" tends not to be pride, as in the classic Christian model, but abdication of self (a point that Daphne Hampson discusses in some detail [122-23]). Women who have been expected to live for others (or compelled to, by such exigencies as single motherhood) often continue to do so when it is no longer necessary or expected, rather than getting a clear sense of their own needs and 4 It is interesting that there is a doctrine in esoteric Christianity that resonates closely with this suggestion of Cunneen's. "This doctrine teaches the end-more or less at hand-of the church of Peter, or above all of the papacy which is its visible symbol, and that the spirit of John, the disciple loved by [esus] ... will replace it.... The 'exo- teric' church of Peter will make way for the 'esoteric' church of John, which will be that of perfect freedom" (Meditations on the Tarot: A Journey Into Christian Hermeticism [Rockport, Mass.: Element, 1985]). In a sense, there is biblical precedent for such a doc- trine: the "covenant written on the heart" of Jer. 31:31-34, with which God says he will someday replace the commandments given on Sinai (and which Paul and later Christian commentators identified with the mission of Jesus [Heb. 8:6-13]). A parallel doctrine in sixteenth-century esoteric Judaism imagined the "Torah of Briyah" (creation, conception, mind) being superseded by the "Torah of Atzilut" (integration, union, unob- structed clarity) at some point in the future (Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, "Transmitting the Software of Tradition," in Gnosis 3 [Fall/Winter 1986-87]: 20). S A little-known (and immensely entertaining) account of such a "conversion" to athe- ism, complete with a William Jamesian experience of rebirth, is Yvonne Stevenson, The Hot-House Plant: The Autobiography of a Young Girl (London: Elek/Pemberton, 1976). Winter 1994 SIGNS 487</page><page sequence="9">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION working to fill them. Thus one of Saussy's more interesting points is that heightened self-esteem need not precede behavioral change: in fact it more often follows it, as women change their established patterns of abdication and find that they not only survive but thrive. Saussy does not make it clear whether God imagery plays any role at all here; no doubt there are many factors, both ideological and circumstantial, that can precipitate such a change. What is striking in Saussy's sample is the number of women who were discouraged as children from showing (or even from feeling) emotions considered unacceptable for girls. (Interestingly, none of the four black women in the sample reports this experience-perhaps because all of them grew up in families that valued female power, and at least one in a family that deliberately gave her high self-esteem as a bulwark against racism. Is this pattern of believing one's feelings unacceptable-and even the larger pattern of abdication of self-chiefly a white women's prob- lem, masquerading as a "women's" problem?) The fear of showing un- acceptable emotions has, I think, an effect on God imagery that has not occurred to Saussy. Several of the women who have adopted Goddess imagery (including Saussy herself) use overwhelmingly positive terms in speaking of the Goddess; one woman adds, "I'm not angry at Her" (71). No doubt this is mainly the relief of imagining a God who has some resemblance to one's own image; but is it also a relief at not having to feel anger? When anger is an unacceptable emotion in a woman, are women inclined to construct a Goddess who never provokes it? In spite of this caution, it is clear that Goddess imagery, like self-chosen imagery in general, can make possible a companionable and competent stance toward the universe. "The question in a given situation," Saussy writes, "is not so much 'Where is God's will?' [but] 'God/dess, what do we do with this one?'" (154). Women who have arrived at this point would understand Paris's approach to religion as the making of mature choices; they have certainly managed to throw off unnecessary fears. "A movement is in process," Carter Heyward once wrote, "from 'May I please be who I am?' to 'Dammit, let me be who I am!' to 'I am who I am' .6 The essays collected in Carol P. Christ's Laughter of Aphrodite trace such a movement in her own life and work.7 Combining theological argument and personal reflection, they explain the reasons she left the (Presbyterian) church and adopted Goddess worship, a position still rare and risky among scholars of religion. The book's final essay, "Finitude, Death and Reverence for Life," shows how productive this move was for her: she speaks with greater authority, and her theory that only the 6 Carter Heyward, A Priest Forever (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1976), 73. 7 Carol P.

In the work leading up to this essay she is a careful and diligent scholar, bal- anced and reasonable about such details of women's history as the witch persecutions, and making a visible effort to reconcile the claims of intel- lect and inner life as she becomes increasingly drawn to the Goddess. Unfortunately, however, the Christianity with which she was raised seems to have been so conventional and bland that she never recognizes the full complexity of the biblical God, and not until the end of the book-well after her influential essay "Why Women Need the Goddess"-does she manage to imagine a very complex Goddess. Like many feminist theologians (or thealogians, as she prefers), Christ conceives of the biblical God as a sort of puppet brought in by a patri- archal culture to drive out Goddess worship, sacred sexuality, and female autonomy; she makes nothing of the fact that the men of the Bible do not have this God's favor simply by being men, but are subject to his demand- ing and sometimes capricious judgments. Convinced that God is basically a tool for the legitimation of male authority, she quite unabashedly counters with a Goddess who is a tool for the legitimation of female authority-a Goddess who is on our side, as superficially and approv- ingly as God might be on the side of an attacking army. Do women need that Goddess? Male church authorities in some denominations have cer- tainly taken the position that God's maleness justifies their own hegemony-in a reading of the Bible that is not only cruel in its effects but quite fantastically off the point-but need one operate on the same level of spiritual illiteracy in order to answer them? Must transparent propaganda be met with more transparent propaganda? Propaganda for one's own side is exhilarating enough in the short run, especially if one has never had it before, but it is far from being a response of one's own to the universe. It is also entirely unconvincing to women who want something more from the universe than unqualified approval. It is interesting that when Christ finally has an actual experience of the Goddess, it is not one of pure legitimation or unconditional love: it is Aphrodite's voice, laughing at her and saying, "Whoever told you that you could know sexual ecstasy without pain?" (195). Aphrodite is no- body's puppet here, any more than the biblical God is when he says, "I make peace and create evil" (Isaiah 45:7); they might almost have been talking to each other. The universe, by whatever name, is a mixture of the wanted and the unwanted, the joyful and the miserable; the more we change the masks, the more we find the same old pair of eyes behind them all. The content of God language is arbitrary, but the conditions it is meant to describe remain the same. Christ may have needed propaganda in order to come to a more complex understanding-for the universe, by Winter 1994 SIGNS 489</page><page sequence="11">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION whatever name, works in mysterious ways-but one cannot help feeling that if the church had done a better job of reading its own scriptures (and its poets), a great deal of Christ's time and effort might have been saved. All of which is not to say that Christ could have remained in the church: besides her feminism, her understanding of the anti-Jewish po- lemic in Christianity is too acute to allow her to remain there. In the early essays she acknowledges her debt to Elie Wiesel (though she has absorbed none of Wiesel's prodigious irony, his ability to perpetuate and negate the traditional notion of God in the same breath), and at one point she proposes to adapt the Jewish tradition of arguing with God to Christian feminist uses (though she never carries this interesting suggestion very far). Her essay "On Not Blaming Jews for the Death of the Goddess" is informed and responsible, and makes the important point that patriarchy began before the ancient Hebrews. She might have let this awareness of Jewish thought inform her essay on finitude, where she critiques Platonic dualism and the Christian denial of death and looks at the effects that certain doctrines-original sin, the wickedness of the flesh, God's imper- viousness to suffering-have had on Western history. None of these are Hebraic ideas-not even original sin, which derives from Augustine's interpretation of Paul-and she might have found it useful to reflect that there is a strong Western countertradition that does not dishonor the body or deny finitude. (Though of course the Hebrew Bible will never be unproblematic in feminist terms, or even in its own.) In any case, Christ seems to have arrived after much struggle at a position of integrity, and the book is an interesting record of that quest. The English theologian Daphne Hampson has also arrived at a post- Christian position, but without moving in the direction of the Goddess. Interestingly, she finds much feminist theology "profoundly secular" (170) because it speaks more of women's general experience than of their experience of God. Overall, her Theology and Feminism is an argument against the possibility of a Christian feminism, but it also hints at her own emerging theology in which "perceptivity" (the perception of God through phenomena such as the efficacy of prayer) is the basis for reli- gious language, and in which anthropomorphic metaphors for God are not a fundamental necessity. Hampson finds Christian feminism untenable mainly because she sees no solid scriptural grounds for it; one can read feminist content into scripture (e.g., by attributing feminist motives to Jesus' treatment of women), but she feels that such efforts are only made by women who have already decided to maintain their Christian allegiance and who are thus faced with having to derive the feminist present from a patriarchal past. Hampson sees this as bending the truth to shore up received doctrines, and dislikes it. She has more respect for more adventurous 490 SIGNS Winter 1994</page><page sequence="12">WOMEN IN RELIGION Madsen theologies-Sallie McFague's Models of God: Theology for an Ecologi- cal, Nuclear Age, for instance, which proposes new metaphors like "God's body" for the world and "mother, friend, and lover" for God on the purely pragmatic grounds that they are saner than the ones we have been used to-but she cannot see how such theologies are Christian.8 Christianity, she says, must give some central place to Christ (and she left the church because she could not do it): the doctrine that Jesus was God, or was uniquely intimate with God, or was the one possible redeemer for all times and places, is the doctrine that makes Christianity Christian, and cannot simply be ignored. Since no Christian feminist theology to date has shown that it regards Jesus as anything more than a necessary encumbrance-at best a beloved and familiar figure-Hampson thinks that Christian feminism is only tenuously attached to the central Chris- tian myth and would do better to break with it altogether. Like Carol Christ, however, she accepts certain conventional assump- tions about the Christian idea of God that somewhat lessen the sophis- tication of her argument-perhaps because she did battle with the An- glican hierarchy for several years in the cause of women's ordination (at long last won in 1992) and ended by accepting the hierarchy's claim that it represented him correctly. "The question arises," she says, "as to how God can be good if God can have revealed himself through such a [pa- triarchal and misogynist] history and if such a myth is true" (45)-as if the question of God's goodness had never arisen before, in all the dis- turbing history through which he is supposed to have revealed himself. Of course it arises repeatedly in the Hebrew Bible, most obviously in the Book of Job, and while it is never satisfactorily answered ("My ways are not your ways" is scarcely a defense), it is not a question likely to dis- appear with the rejection of patriarchy and misogyny. (Surely it arises whenever people suffer: whether or not one can believe that God is revealed in history, why is history so painful? If being alive is better than being dead, why does that essential goodness not carry over easily into our ethical relations?) Hampson mocks at the caricature of the "good" but monstrously authoritarian God (151-52) and quotes Mary Daly's observation that the "God-Male ... is beginning to be perceived by women as a kind of cosmic joke" (108). But it is two hundred years since William Blake called that God "Nobodaddy," and over a hundred since Emily Dickinson wrote: God is indeed a jealous God - He cannot bear to see 8 Sallie McFague, Models of God: Theology for an Ecological, Nuclear Age (Phila- delphia: Fortress, 1987).

If modern feminists are just now getting the joke, is this not simply yet another sign of shallow and literal religious teaching, which has always insisted on reverence at the expense of accuracy? There is no need for women to be good-natured in their joking-Kadia Molodowsky was not, who wrote after World War II, "O God of mercy / For the time being / Choose another people"-but it is sheer waste to ignore the long tradi- tion of questioning God's goodness, as if feminists had no allies in this project.10 Hampson makes the interesting suggestion that women's relationality is responsible for their relative lack of Angst in the face of their own mortality; they do not feel themselves terrifyingly alone before the uni- verse, as have male theologians with the luxury of a quiet study and a woman to cook their meals (137-42). She tends to make a virtue of necessity here-though she has just spent several pages (121-31) show- ing the pitfalls of relationality and its tendency to lead to abdication of self-but the discussion is useful and worth initiating. She suggests that self-actualization and coming to trust one's own judgment may be as central to women's theology as the breaking of the proud, "sinful" self has been to men's. She also questions whether monotheism is not basi- cally inimical to relationality and pluralism (153), and whether-even if God is redefined as Goddess-oneness must not always imply hierarchy and intolerance. Here I think she mistakes what many feminists mean by the Goddess (and even what some traditional monotheists, on the more mystical end of the spectrum, mean by God), which is not a tran- scendent authority but an immanent presence. When she quotes Cathe- rine of Siena's "My real me is God" as an example of the direction her own theology is taking (169), she is approaching the subtler reaches of monotheism but not necessarily leaving the neighborhood entirely. (The literal and shockable interpreters of monotheism will no doubt find her shocking-as their fourteenth-century equivalents found Meister Eck- hart's "God and I, we are one"-but fortunately we do not live in a time when they can try her for heresy.) But there is a place where monotheism, pantheism, and atheism all converge: it is words that are inadequate, not realities that conflict. Who knows but the experience of God is electrical or chemical, a bodily capacity prior to vocabulary? If it is, then both 9 Emily Dickinson, The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, ed. Thomas H.

If the experience is potential in everyone, pluralism is not suppressed but guaranteed. The ethical applications of this view remain a problem, but there is no theology (and no politics) where they are not: the relation between theory and practice remains one of the murkiest in life. It will be interesting to see how Hampson approaches these questions in her future work; her evolving theology promises to be something more than a prop for women's self-esteem. Judith Plaskow is Hampson's nearest equivalent in Judaism, though (since Judaism is based on community, not on creed) she has chosen to stay within her tradition. In Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective she has subjected that tradition to a scrupulous feminist critique. Examining the three main foci of Jewish spirituality- God, Torah, and Israel-and adding further chapters on sexuality and political action, she raises essential questions: To what extent does the Torah define women as Jews at all? Is law necessarily a female form of social organization? How can communities acknowledge difference among their members-including differences of sexual orientation- without finally losing their cohesiveness? Is the concept of chosenness worth preserving, or does it too easily lead to chauvinism-or to religious nationalism, as has happened in modern Israel? The answers she pro- poses are provocative and often controversial; she does not hesitate to revise or discard what she cannot assent to. She also speaks strongly for what she does assent to: her observations on "the communal character of human selfhood" (77) in both Judaism and feminism are particularly interesting. Even more promising is her discussion of the power of the erotic as "fundamental life energy" (202) whose full, knowledgeable, and ethical exercise is necessary for both public and private creativity. If this idea were to be carefully and thoroughly worked out, the West might finally arrive at a religion for free people. Much could be said on all these questions, but I want to focus par- ticularly on Plaskow's "God" chapter, since this is an area in which she is continuing to work (see her article "Facing the Ambiguity of God") and in which-as will be evident by now-I have a particular interest.1l Plaskow asks at the beginning of the book, "What can we claim that has not also wounded us?" (1). I am not sure this is the right question, either in terms of Jewish tradition-which has a good many wounds to bestow besides those reserved exclusively for women-or in terms of God, who, as Elaine Scarry has pointed out, is frequently pictured in 11 Judith Plaskow, "Facing the Ambiguity of God," Tikkun 6, no. 5 (September- October 1991): 70. Winter 1994 SIGNS 493</page><page sequence="15">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION biblical metaphor as being on the wielding end of a weapon that wounds humanity.12 Plaskow accepts the premise common to feminist critiques of God language, that masculine and hierarchical imagery is intended to appear innocuous and that its purpose is chiefly to legitimate male au- thority and female exclusion. No one can deny the exclusion of women from public Jewish religious life until very recent times, but I would argue that male God imagery was never intended as innocuous and that the metaphors of father and king arose and persisted because of the very mixture of love, awe, and perpetual unease that they evoke in men as well as women. The biblical writers-indifferent to a later generation's need for role models-were not interested in a God with whom one could be comfortable. On the whole, they seem to have been bent on establishing a God as problematic as possible-a God who torments the conscience without being in any coherent sense subject to conscience, who gives life and moral precepts without linking the two in any reliable way. The psychological dynamic here, I think, is something like the one that op- erates in Tibetan Buddhism, whose "wrathful deities" are contemplated in order to rouse the soul to its full energy: biblical God imagery func- tions as a sort of spiritual live wire conducting (in alternating currents) raw life force and intensified moral strength. What is important is not the literal truth of the imagery but the fact that it disturbs. The effort to "choose life" may require such complicated mechanisms, much as it also requires an overarching ethic of compassion and critical detachment. (In which case, the male image of God may have uses for feminists that have not yet been remarked-rather than being impediment or damper, he may be fuel.) Plaskow herself recognizes, in another connection, that God's ambi- guity has something to do with the nature of monotheism, which in order to make God a credible creator must include evil in his makeup (151). (In her 1991 article she observes that "creativity by its very nature seems profoundly ambiguous.")13 That the biblical writers used very little fe- male imagery for God was doubtless politically motivated to some de- gree, but they may also have had difficulty conceiving a female image that fused love and unease with the same efficiency as the male. Perhaps that was their failure of imagination (and one need only look at the intensely uneasy and unloving images of whoredom in the prophetic writings to see exactly how it failed), but I suspect Plaskow's imagination fails her too at this point. She does once propose "purposely disquieting female images" (161), but she repeatedly insists that "images of domination" must be excluded from feminist God language. (Excised is her word, not a verb 12 Elaine Scarry, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), 198. 13 Judith Plaskow, "Facing the Ambiguity of God," 70. 494 SIGNS Winter 1994</page><page sequence="16">WOMEN IN RELIGION Madsen noted for its mutuality.) What she is faced with here is Judaism's uncom- promising construction of monotheism: in order to be one, God must encompass evil, including what she thinks of as evil, or God is only an idol. It is not a religion for the fainthearted. As a theologian rather than a poet, Plaskow is, I think, fundamentally out of sympathy with metaphoric thinking. (She is not alone: so were some of the biblical writers, and so have been a great many interpreters of the Bible since.) She understands that emotionally valid metaphors cannot be generated on demand, but she seems not quite to see that they are never generated except by intensely felt experience-that they are ruled by the "fundamental life energy" of the erotic and not by a sober effort to be fair-minded. Metaphor is never a solution to personal or political problems: it is a response, a cry of pain or gratitude or a shrug of irony. However elaborate or compelling, metaphors are merely unsys- tematic products of the creative impulse, which spills out one approxi- mation after another, one image after another, prodigal as sperm, and as soon forgotten by their maker. (Somebody else, of course, is left to labor over their consequences, which may be far-reaching and disastrous and are likely to be wholly unintended.) Like humor (and like God), this life energy has an amoral streak. It has a sense of justice, but it is aesthetic justice-the right word for the right moment-and not necessarily ethical justice. Forbidden its full range-forbidden, for example, to "dominate"- this energy will dry up, become diffident and self-conscious, examine its every move for evidence of domination till it dare not move at all and reverts to stasis. (Sonia Johnson's recent book The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room is a painfully detailed example of how this operates in sexual life; for examples from religious life, one has only to look at most contemporary liturgy.)14 Obviously metaphor has inherent dangers, and perhaps requires some sort of ethical containment; on the naive or the desperate it can have an effect almost Dionysian, and history shows how easily one may be persuaded to kill and maim real people for the sake of a metaphor. But Plaskow's call for the "excision" of disturbing imagery is essentially a call for censorship, itself ethically compromising. Perhaps what we need instead is the strength and common sense to behave hu- manely toward other people no matter what metaphors we use for God. The trickiness of the creative impulse is one reason that the metaphors of "co-creation" in Jewish tradition, which Plaskow points out while lamenting their scarcity, are so surprising and so interesting. (An example is the rabbinic play on the last line of Psalm 90: "May God establish the work of our hands as the work of our hands establishes God.") While 14 Sonia Johnson, The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room: Sex and Intimacy Re- considered (Estancia, N.Mex.: Wildfire, 1991). Winter 1994 SIGNS 495</page><page sequence="17">Madsen WOMEN IN RELIGION raising no uncomfortable questions of gender or hierarchy, they have a powerful emotional validity-right down to the amorality of putting oneself on a level with the Creator; they show a kind of deep and intimate metaphysical daring, a trust in human creativity that is exceedingly rare in Western religion. They are scarce, and we should be cautious about multiplying them so as to cheapen them. But I agree with Plaskow that these images are crucial to the feminist enterprise in religion; they are also crucial to the poetic enterprise, and here (as occasionally happens) the two are not in conflict. Two collections of women's writing have some bearing on this ques- tion of the poetic enterprise. Cries of the Spirit: A Celebration of Wom- en's Spirituality, edited by Marilyn Sewell, is an anthology of poetry and short prose by modern women writers. Intended for both private reading and liturgical use, it spans a range of subject matter from the self and its relationships to violence and loss to moral and mystical experience. The subject categories are intriguing ("Songs of Brokenness and Alienation," "The Spirit and the Flesh Are One"), and the selection of authors is impressive, but the readings themselves are somewhat disappointing- for reasons that become clear in the preface, where Sewell says she deliberately chose against work too subtle or profound to be understood on the first reading. No doubt her intentions were generous-most Americans at present find poetry intimidating-but an insult to the intelligence is still an insult, however generously meant. Like the revisers of the Episcopal liturgy, who removed all the archaisms lest someone be confused by them, Sewell assumes that what puzzles the mind is merely a barrier to rational understanding rather than a key to the barrier between rational and irrational. Language without any difficulty tends to be unmemorable-and thus can never fully enter the body, cannot replace the language of one's lost religion that still rings on one's unwilling ears. Too much of the language in this book (though not all) is useful only in the short term, to be understood on the first reading and ignored on the second. Lavinia Byrne's anthology The Hidden Tradition: Women's Spiritual Writings Rediscovered would not be useful for Sewell's purposes since it is drawn entirely from the Christian tradition, but it does not shy away from archaisms or complicated syntax. Though not specifically intended for liturgical use, parts of it would be effective read in church, and prob- ably ought to be heard there. Ranging from the medieval mystics to Salvation Army and Quaker women to nineteenth- and early twentieth- century feminists, the book contains an interesting mix of devotional and visionary writing, advice to women in the ministry or in monastic life, and trenchant political comment on male churchmen's attitudes toward women. What I find most interesting, in view of feminist theology's 496 SIGNS Winter 1994</page><page sequence="18">WOMEN IN RELIGION Madsen recurrent call for new metaphors, is the grit and resilience of the medieval women's metaphors, still unsurpassed (to my knowledge) by anything contemporary Christian women have done: When poor Christianity came before our Lord, she was like a maiden. I looked at her and saw also that our Lord looked at her. And I was very ashamed. Then our Lord said: behold, is it fitting for me to love this maid in my eternal infinite wedding bed and to draw her to me in my imperial arms and to look at her with my divine eyes, since she is half-blind in her knowledge and crippled in her hands, which hardly do any good works? [Mechthild of Magde- burg (26)] For are you not my mother and more than my mother? The mother who bore me laboured in delivering me for one day or one night but you, my sweet and lovely Lord, laboured for me for more than thirty years ... when the hour of your delivery came you we:e placed on the hard bed of the cross ... and your nerves and all your veins were broken. And truly it is no surprise that all your veins burst when in one day you gave birth to the whole world. [Mar- guerite d'Oingt (31-32)] This is not the stuff of feminism-there is no discernible female solidarity here-but it draws powerfully on female experience, the worst along with the best, uninhibited by any considerations of decorum or role modeling. These images are not "inclusive" or compensatory but or- ganic. (And Julian of Norwich's well-known metaphor of Christ as Mother manages without any slight to real mothers: "To the property of motherhood belong nature, love, wisdom and knowledge, and that is God" [37].) Not all the writing in The Hidden Tradition is this forceful- there are a number of saccharine pieties-but the authors included show a remarkable sense of freehold in the religious realm, a courage and energy to equal anything contemporary feminists are doing, in or out of mainstream religion. Adrienne Rich once raised the question of whether the discipline of women's studies would become the dutiful daughter or the disobedient daughter of the patriarchal university.15 In religion, I suspect we are lost if we submit to being daughters at all. As daughters we are only the inheritors of someone else's misunderstood vision, and whether we are tractable or rebellious inheritors we still place more authority in an 15 Adrienne Rich, "Disobedience and Women's Studies," in her Blood, Bread and Poetry: Selected Prose, 1979-1985 (New York: Norton, 1986), 76-84.

Clearly, a lack of self-trust is one of women's common problems, in religion and else- where. If religion at its best is defined as self-mastery for the sake of service, women have a thorough acquaintance with service but a much more tentative understanding of the self. Our business, if we are women of spiritual force, is always to become the first generation: to make, in solitude or in community or in any way we can, those connections with the universe that will give us a self to master.
