<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dilthey's Voice in the Emerging Consciousness of Humanistic Education Hilary Evans Bender Wilhelm Dilthey, a precursor to our modern interest in human life, supports and confirms our humanistic thinking, several generations later. He urges us to develop a new methodology that is both appropriate to our unique object of study, man as human, yet sufficiently rigorous to escape the critique of scientific skepticism. Dilthey sketches the ground plan for such a methodology. Basing his research on empirical phenomena, he nevertheless utilizes the researcher as his own instrument of interpretation, understanding, and meaning-building. Steps are then outlined to train the researcher to an acceptable level of competence. Only with a methodology of rigor and power can humanistic education escape a Utopian idealism and humanize our present technological society. The researches of Dilthey were, for their part, a pioneering work; but today's generation has not as yet made them its own. ... [In the] following analysis, the issue is solely one of furthering their adoption. (Heidegger, 1962, p. 429) Humanistic education has much the mentality of an orphan. Popular and fast-growing, this movement seems to have popped up from nowhere. But, it stands like the onion in the proverbial petunia patch, so obviously out of place in a field dominated by statistical analysis, behavioral objec- tives, and countless other forms of scientific research and practice. If pressed: "where in the world did humanistic education come from?", my best answer would probably be that it rose in reactive protest against the overflow and over-exuberance of the scientists and technicians who monopolize American education. How regretful is this orphan-child attitude. It makes the humanistic influence on the educational world so defensive and reactive, and ulti- mately, so impotent. More painful is the fact that it is just not true. Humanistic education did not just "pop from nowhere;" it is a vital in-</page><page sequence="2">32 BOSTON UNIVERSITY stance of a growing, swelling movement, reaching back at least a century and now exhibiting the potential to humanize the present technological world. Humanistic education has, at its back, the vigorous thrust of gen- erations of the most insightful thinkers and practitioners of this civiliza- tion. But, this heritage must be embraced if people are to assume its power and direction. I submit that the work of Wilhelm Dilthey could hardly be a more appropriate doorway for we orphans to return to our parental home. Dilthey (Note 1) is obviously an unknown, despite the fact that his work is basic to Weber, Jaspers, and Buber; despite the fact that Ortega y Gasset (1946, p. 131) calls him "the most important philosopher of the second half of the 19th century"; and despite the fact that Heidegger recognizes his foundational importance to the present generation. He was a pioneer thinker, one of the first to intuit the revolutionary new dimen- sion in human life. As a "predawn" researcher, he was forced to cast his insights into the existent conceptual frames of reference, grossly ill-suited to deal with this new dimension. As a result, his work was obtuse and rambling, the work of a man who could never bring his thought into clear focus (Note 2) . In the early morning of the new "human life" idea, only these few men of unusual stature were stimulated by Dilthey's research. Now the light is much clearer, the ideas more sharply outlined and set in their proper context; time reveals Dilthey's penetrating insights to be more, rather than less, relevant to contemporary insights, particularly in the field of humanistic education. This article intends to introduce a selection of these insights addressing the question of humanistic research methodol- ogy. But first, a fingernail description of Dilthey's "man" and an equally brief sketch of his historic thrust are given. The Idea of Human Life Dilthey's "man" is no self-contained "essence," a creature whose inner "nature" houses a preset growth process that needs only the proper en- vironment to unfold into beautiful personhood. In fact, his "man" has no set nature but is a social and historic creature in the process of be- coming. He is interdependently formed on the one hand by the context of his human society and its ongoing flow of history, and on the other by his own free and intelligent human response to this socio-historic environment.</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF EDUCATION 33 Man is a becoming, partially self-determining, and partially world- creating creature, not a predetermined potentiality to be actualized. As a comparative historian, Dilthey saw all too many prototypes of "man" disintegrate under the wheels of history to allow himself to accept any one as man's "true essence." One might picture Dilthey's man as standing casually over a bar on a speeding commuter coach, sipping his 5:30 Martini. To himself and his friends, contained within this same "cultural" coach, life is relatively simple and at rest. It appears that each man can be considered complete within his own personal context. Only if the commuter were to quit his smoke-filled coach and step out on to the gravel for a breath of fresh air, would he quickly realize that his life should have been evaluated in the context of a forceful momentum projecting him down the track at 80 miles an hour. So contemporary man appears to possess a relatively estab- lished "nature," especially when viewed by his cotraveling peers, but he can be validly understood only by appreciating the force of history pro- jecting him through life and by identifying its power and direction. This analogy limps only because it fails to add that Dilthey's "man" can be the engineer of his socio-historic commuter train if he so chooses. How to describe this "thrust" that so powerfully affects human lives? The following sketch, admittedly crude, attempts to summarize Dilthey's "social-historic context" from the perspective of humanistic education. Primitive man made sense out of his world by seeing it as a living ex- tension of himself, a community of anthropomorphic personalities who threatened his very existence at every turn. His myths about these gods were his "knowledge" of reality and his worship, his only practical means of placating their impending violence on him. However much one may smile at his simplistic naiveté, the primitive's knowledge and deeds were intensely integrated into his subjective self. Life was a human celebration. As man's stature grew, the "awful" power of these gods diminished and they became more like himself; capricious, egotistic, and at times, even weak. Eventually, in the evolutionary growth of his own self-image, man made the olympian leap that totally demythologized his world out of his own projected imagery and objectivized it into that mindless physical complex that it actually is. Man, his knowledge, and his deeds become separate entities. At first, this more realistic view allowed man to see only a static, im- mutable world, an object to be known and reckoned with in stoic co- existence but not a world to be conquered and transformed. Knowledge was not necessarily linked with the deed, and both were objects to the</page><page sequence="4">34 BOSTON UNIVERSITY subjective self. As he matured further and became "ready" for more perceptive insights, man realized the world to be an ever changing and evolving reality, the object not only of his knowledge but of his responsi- ble modification as well. Once again, knowledge reassumed the power of the deed. With each step, man developed a new set of tools, new methodologies of investigation and new technologies of power and transformation. As each set of tools became perfected, man achieved not only a technological revolution but a further increase in his own evolving stature as well. This evolution of man's consciousness is not of ideas man has, but of ideas he lives within. Each idea constitutes his life-dimension. One by one, each of these ideas has emerged into human consciousness only in "due season," after a long process of germination extending over several generations and involving many thinkers. The true and only source benefiting the initiators of an Idea is the intellectual level that has been reached in the course of human evolution. That is why the several pieces of the Idea are discovered by people who live far apart and do not know each other. All they have in common is that they stand on the same level in the scale of mankind's experience. (Ortega y Gasset, 1946, p. 134) Today, as man absorbs the full realization of his most recent conquest, the harnessing of the powers of the universe into his service, a new "readi- ness" is germinating and a new idea is being given birth. Man's attention now moves away from the objective world lying before him and turns toward the only "unknown" yet remaining in the universe: man himself - man as human life and man as the creative subject of himself, his world, and his history. Within this new idea lies the promise of a new, advanced reintegration of the human self, his knowledge, and his deed - the promise of a new humanistic education. Dilthey, as a precursor of this new dimension of human life, supports and confirms current humanistic thinking, several generations later. One selection among these ideas that is especially intriguing can possibly guide people out of a methodological closet that has yet failed to be unlatched (Rickman, p. 12) . The Humane Sciences A good thing is hard to resist, and this scholarly world has a good thing in the physical sciences. Their methodology is valid, refined, and</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF EDUCATION 35 highly reliable; the technology it has spawned has not only developed extensive power and shaping control over this world but, in turn, has facilitated its parent's research method beyond imagination through its mechanical brain, the computer. Day by day, the growth in knowledge and world control expands geometrically. Much in education is the legitimate object of this positivistic form of research. Not only does education search and transmit knowledge, but this transmissive process itself is carried on by physical beings subject to behavioral laws and scientifically controlled dynamics. Yet, when one steps back from this limited view of education precisely circumscribed by the "good thing" of positivistic science, he sees a great realm of human interaction, values, perceptions, and educated under- standings neglected. He also sees the delivered insights and programs of the positivist as superficial and crude when evaluated on the total horizon of this essentially interhuman activity. Although the power of the posi- tivisti science is immense, it is largely inappropriate to the object under study in education: human life and human interaction. Two objects of study, human life and physical matter, are radically distinct. The physical order consists of homogeneous elements, one set identical with another, each exactly subject to a causal order and uni- versal laws. The human order consists of unique and distinct individuals, interrelating in a meaningful order of relationships on which trends and patterns can be projected, but without precision or finality. The physical order is known when its objective facts are disclosed and its activities thereby identified. The human order can be understood only when its external expressions are interpreted to reveal their inner mean- ings, motives, and inter-connections (Note 3) . The waterfall is composed of homogeneous falling particles of water; but a single sentence, which is but a noise in the mouth, shakes the whole living society of a continent through a play of motives in absolutely individual units, none of whom is comparable with the rest; so different is the ideal motive from any other kind of cause. (G.S. 5, 1961, p. 63; trans. Hodges, 1952, p. 165) Human life is qualitatively different from the physical world, and thereby requires a new, qualitatively different methodology of research. Dilthey recognized this need and set out to develop its appropriate structure. Although he identified the inappropriate nature of positivistic research, Dilthey admired its disciplined rigor and sought to incorporate these high standards into his own methodology. Though he appreciated</page><page sequence="6">36 BOSTON UNIVERSITY the sensitive understanding of the romantics, he also recognized their detached idealism and tendency toward subjective imagination. Their findings, insightful as they might have been, were all too prone to scien- tific skepticism. Dilthey hoped to combine the best of both of these two worlds. He began by rejecting all a priori metaphysical constructions, whether reli- gious, rational, or moral, and founded his method on the empiric level and the current external expressions of the individual person. As Dilthey intended to view man in his human rather than physical dimension, he carefully bypassed considering these phenomena under the physical, causal order and saw them rather as signs and bridges into the inner order of the "Geist" (Note 4) . The Geist of man is his intellect, will, and feelings, integrated into a synthetic whole, a "something more than the sum of total parts," the human person. "It was the human world which he saw suffused throughout with meaning arising from the con- sciousness, feeling, purposes and valuations of human beings/' (Rickman, 1962, p. 61) . In his determination to avoid unrestrained flights of theory and the imaginative conjuring of psychological motives, Dilthey anchored his methodology in the empirical level and the actual individual. Yet, since he saw man as a social-historical being rather than a self-contained essence, Dilthey viewed the study of man as interdisciplinary, embracing all those humanities and social sciences that studied man in his human dimension (Note 5) . "Man knows himself only in history, never through introspection; indeed we seek him in history." (G.S. 7, 1961, p. 279; trans. Rickman, 1962, p. 138) . These various disciplines Dilthey described as Die Geisteswissenschaften, the humane sciences, to distinguish them from Die Naturwissenschaften, the natural or physical sciences. Experience, Expression, Understanding The key to Dilthey's methodology is understanding ( Verstehen ) : that unique human ability of one man to understand the experience of an- other because of a similar experience within himself. "Understanding is the rediscovery of myself in the other" (Note 6) . A fuller explanation in- volves the close interconnection among the three words: experience, ex- pression, and understanding. Each lived-experience (Erlebnis) of one's life becomes clothed in an overt expression, i.e., a word, deed, gesture, or a mental word. A fundamental characteristic of mental life is that it needs</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF EDUCATION 37 to "objectify" its experiences into such an expression. By some further psychological law, an overt expression by which one person's experience has become objectified has the power to evoke a corresponding experience in another (Hodges, 1969, p. 14) . The other's experience leads one to live over again ( Nacherleben ) the other's experience in one's own conscious- ness (Note 7) . This is the essence of understanding. Understanding is an uniquely human power, common to all human beings. It is not an intellectual or an emotional mechanism but an activity of the integral "Geist," i.e., an activity of the total human being. This activity is not to be confused with sympathy, in which I join an- other's feelings with my own, but remains an empathy, in which I experi- entially understand another's inner world as distinctly his and not nec- essarily mine. Dilthey is not speaking of mystical intuition or psychologi- cal speculation but of a simple, fundamental process analogous to the simple process of reading words in a book. Since, however, a process of interpretation is involved, it is necessary for the researcher to observe a set of interpretative rules, a hermeneutics, and thereby avoid a response of scientific skepticism from scholarly readers. For example, the researcher must limit his interpretations to the observed expressions, to what actually happened, and avoid venturing into intuited psychological motives. He must, on the one hand, interpret each part with respect to the total context, and on the other, develop the meaning of the whole out of the meaning of each of its parts (Note 8) . Again, the researcher must develop his interpretation out of his under- standing of the other and not out of his own imposed meaning of life. This he must suspend while he becomes open and sensitive to the other's contextual Weltanschauung . The development of such a hermeneutics (Note 9) is essential if this human science is to aim for validity, con- sciously and critically, and thus be a science in the strict sense. Its business is to furnish, in opposition to the continual inroads of romantic arbitrariness and skeptical subjectivity into the field of history, a theoretical vindication of the universal validity of interpretation, upon which all security in history depends. (G.S. 5, 1961, p. 331; trans. Hodges, 1969, p. 25) This trilogy; experience, expression, and understanding; forms the heart of Dilthey's research process and yields meaning ( Bedeutung ) as its ultimate product. This mental unity, realized by the geistig order, is achieved on two levels. The more elemental level sees meaning as the result of the decoding of the expressions of another's experience. The</page><page sequence="8">38 BOSTON UNIVERSITY more all-embracing level sees meaning as interpreting the interconnec- tions between parts and forming them into a structural unity, a "mean- ingful" whole. This, latter level forms the ongoing activity of the re- searcher. Life continually shapes itself into a whole; yet, it is never com- plete or stable. As each present event has been fashioned by what has gone before, so it, in turn, opens up certain future possibilities and closes out others. Past, present, and future play a role in the shaping of life's meaning. While the formation of meaning is an activity of the human mind {Geist) , it must not be regarded as a purely subjective imagination im- posed upon reality. Man senses and exposes an unfolding pattern, an interconnection between parts, that is substantively founded in reality; yet, it is observable and understandable only by the human mind. The usual definition of subjective thought and objective reality fails to com- municate Dilthey's view. Trans jective, the interdependent relationship between man and his world, could well serve as a more adequate term. Autobiography, Biography, Objective Mind Given the above description of the elements that make up Dilthey's humanistic research methodology, this discussion has the remaining task of placing them into their contextual process of operation. This step in- troduces a new trilogy of terms: the autobiography , the biography and the objective mind . Each forms a phase in the development of the re- searcher's power in his scientific discipline. The research method of the physical sciences depends upon a set of carefully designed procedures that must be followed with objective pre- cision. The power is in the instruments and the design of the research. However, the critical factor in the humane sciences is the researcher himself. He is his own instrument, and the power of his research depends upon his skill and human sensitivity. Understanding, for example, can have various levels of concentration. If interest is limited, or the listener is anxious to make his own contribution, understanding will be cursory. On the other hand, if the researcher keenly watches every facial expres- sion and intently sifts every word of the speaker to fully grasp his mean- ing, understanding will be penetrating. This is only one element among many. Dilthey's point is that if one wishes to develop the power and validity of research in the humane sciences, one must develop the re- searcher himself.</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF EDUCATION 39 Autobiography is a continuing introspection on the part of the re- searcher as he seeks to analyze the significance of his own past experiences and to derive out of them that emerging, interconnecting pattern that gives meaning and direction to his own life. This exercise helps him not only to become aware of the inherent significance of human experiences but also to learn how they gradually coalesce into a meaningful pattern. The power and breadth of our own lives and the enegry with which we reflect on them are the foundations of historical vision. It alone enables us to give life back to the bloodless shadows of the past. (G.S. 7, 1961, p. 200; trans. Rickman, p. 87.) This activity also introduces the researcher to some initial skills of his methodology. Searching his memory, he becomes conscious of a "selective" process in which certain events stand out as highly significant to his life pattern, while countless others have passed beyond recall for their lack of significance. This selective memory has validly disciplined his search. (Society's selective memory of its past has equal validity.) A further task is also completed. Events of particular significance, already given an early interpretation, have had that interpretation modi- fied and re-evaluated in the light of later developments. An interconnect- ing pattern has begun to emerge in the researcher's own life, linking one significant event with another and gradually unfolding a clear, albeit inconclusive, meaning of life. The task is not complete, and the present "meaning" will continue to undergo further modifications and clarifications in the light of future events of significance. But, for the moment, the "I" of the researcher, with his contextual Weltanschauung realized in this consciousness-raising autobiographical exercise, becomes increasingly unique and, at the same time, expands his bridge of understanding to the rest of mankind. The major discipline in biography is two-fold: (1) "to surrender and lose one's self in the existence of another" (G.S. 7, 1961, p. 200) , reliving with sensitivity those experiences communicated by the other's expres- sions, but (2) to carefully withhold all tendencies to impose the re- searcher's own interpretative Weltanschauung on the other's perceived experiences. On this fine line lies the researcher's ability to avoid an in- jected bias into his research. Since the researcher can never become culture-free, a total elimination of bias is never possible. Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="10">40 BOSTON UNIVERSITY through autobiographical exercise, his degree of subjective introjection into the interpretative process can be reduced to scientifically acceptable levels. The biographer's task is to gradually interpret the system of purpose and values governing the other's life and to reveal its own unity and meaning. To accomplish this task, he not only interprets the subject's outer expressions and their cumulative interconnecting meaning, but also interrelates the social and historical context in which he lives. Only by seeing the formative cultural environment to which the individual was a respondent, can the biographer correctly understand. From this perspec- tive, he can understand his subject better than the subject himself. Dilthey is here rejecting any concept of the individual as a being in- clusive from within himself. With equal force, Dilthey rejects any in- timation of an overarching "collective soul" that rises above the indi- viduals of a society; a society and its history are created by its participants. Each participant has power and influence, and together, community, in- stitutions, and purposes are formed. No mystique or spirit exists above man that is not explainable by interrelating one constituent biography with each of the others. The individual biography, however, is only the crossing point of the cultural system. Although that biography equips the researcher with insight and skills, it remains too limited to stand by itself. A larger order remains to be studied for the training of the researcher to be complete, the order of the objective mind . This term is used by Dilthey to identify everything in the social order that has been created by the human mind and embodies, in external forms and institutions, human intention. Just as the researcher "reads" the expressions of an- other's individual experiences through his own human resonance, so he now "reads" the expressions of man set in society and history. Here, too, the hermeneutic process remains substantially the same. The researcher interprets the inner meaning of the outer phenomena, relates each part to the whole, and tries to ascertain the interconnecting pattern that joins them into a unity (Rickman, p. 115). But, on this level of the objective mind, the researcher is led to Dilthey's ultimate concern, the social-historical world, or, as he simply calls it, "life." Here the concept of the human studies is completed. Their range is identical with that of understanding and understanding has the objectification of life consistently as its subject matter. Thus the range of the human studies is deter- mined by the objectification of life in the external world. The mind can only understand what it has created. Nature, the subject matter</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF EDUCATION 41 of the natural sciences, embraces the reality which has arisen independently of the activity of the mind. Everything on which man has actively impressed his stamp forms the subject matter of the humane studies. (G.S. 7, 1961, p. 148; trans. Rickman, p. 125) Humanistic Education If we were directly addressing the humanistic educator, Dilthey would certainly not intend or desire a response of filial allegiance to his pro- posals. He would insist that we are much too far along the path of human conversation not to recognize the relativity of perception of each pilgrim. Rather, he would hope to encourage a dialogue, to confirm those percep- tions of ours that resonate with his experiences in life, and to encourage further research in those areas where his early, limited, and culture-bound vision is found wanting. Two points especially recommend themselves. The first need is for humanistic education to search its lineage and return to that vital conversation of western thought from which it came. Contrary to the academics, men live in their ideas and not the reverse alone. A new idea has been born and strives for maturity. This idea, human life, comes from within the stream of the western socio-historic process, and it is sustained and given shape by the continuing conversa- tion of men who listen and respond to each other out of their life experi- ences and reflective consciousnesses. But, the recent anti-historical mood has isolated us from this vital conversation and denied us the source of power necessary to achieve the goals of the humanistic education movement. Our monologue has tended to become dissipated, myopic, and reactive. Humanistic psychology has contributed heavily to our study, but its contribution must be supported by re-acquiring this intellectual history and by exploring man's social dimensions. In fact, all the humanities and social sciences having human life as their focus should be given a chair at our table of discussion. A second need is to recognize that there is no dichotomy between humanism and disciplined direction. To the contrary, humanistic edu- cation must somehow escape that reactive "orphan child" mentality of a subject that does not yet fully possess its own image and confidence. Little is to be gained and much is to be lost by a rear guard defensiveness against the positivistic sciences. There is a realm in which positivism is valid and beneficial, even within the educational processes. Dilthey is correct in noting that humanistic educators have much to learn from their discipline and scientific rigor.</page><page sequence="12">42 BOSTON UNIVERSITY More to the point, the humanistic educator must give serious attention to building a methodology of his own. Subjective, intuitive, and mystical impressions of a romantic tenor must give way to a method of research anchored in the empirical order. A sound, defensible procedure must be developed that is in tune with the dimensions and potentialities of the human order, as distinct from those of the physical order. The wealth and vision of this human research instrument must be explored and refined so that his great powers of meaning-building and world-creation can be fully realized. However much one may agree or disagree with these specific proposals, the conversation of Wilhelm Dilthey has been engaged. On our ability to respond hinges the hope that humanistic education shed its orphan-child posture and assume the dignity and responsibility presumed by its pres- tigious heritage. Footnotes 1. Wilhelm Dilthey was born in Mainz Germany in 1833 and died in 1911. Most of his professional career was spent at the University of Berlin. 2. At best, his conclusive Critique of Historical Reason was the posthumous effort of his disciples. Dilthey saw his life mission to make an effective response to Kant's positivistic Critique of Pure Reason. During his lifetime, the European intellectual world was rejecting the idealistic metaphysica of Hegal and returning to Kant, but the Kant of the first Critique rather than that of the second or third. This focus forced the humanities and social sciences, including Dilthey's field of history, into positivistic forms of research. Dilthey sought to legitimize the interpretative methodology more suitable for these humane sciences. 3. The first order studies the physical world, objective to the researcher; the second studies a realm in which the researcher must always remain within, a participant in his own study. This distinction alone dramatically accents how a particular factor that would critically compromise and debilitate positivistic research, becomes the very source of power in humane research. 4. Dilthey sought the integral man, overcoming the cultural view of separate and distinct faculties: cognitive, conative, and affective, a division still heavily imposed upon us today. But, he remained a child of his age by precisely separating body from mind as two distinct orders. Preserving this cartesian split, he failed to perceive what later existential writers realized: the body is a symbolic extension of the mind, intrinsic to the integration of man into a whole. 5. In spite of the phrase "critique of historical reason," the object of Dilthey's concern is not historical knowledge alone. It is something wider than that. What he has in mind is a much more diverse group of studies, including history, biography, psychology, anthropology, sociology» economics, jurisprudence, and educational theory - a group of studies that vary in aim and method but find a common subject matter in the thoughts and activities of men (Hodges, 1952, p. xxii) . Throughout this study, references by Dilthey to history should be identified with the entire range of the humane sciences.</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF EDUCATION 43 6. Das Verstehen ist ein Wiederfinden des Ich in Du. (G.S. 7, p. 191) . 7. "To reproduce another's expression in my own mind leads to reliving another's ex- perience in my own consciousness." Nachbilden ist eben ein Nacherleben, (G .S. 5, p. 277) . 8. Dilthey speaks frequently of the "pendulum" movement of interpretation, part to whole and whole to part. This appears to be a classical example of a "begging of the question." However, a common example of its application is our method of in- terpreting the meaning of a sentence, with each word understood in the context of the whole and the meaning of the whole yet derived out of each word. 9. Dilthey based his hermeneutical science on the principles of biblical exegesis of Schleiermacher. Dilthey saw Schleiermacher as the first to raise hermeneutics from a literary art to a skilled discipline. References Dilthey, W. Gesammelte schriften (abbreviated in text as G.S.) (16 vols.) .
