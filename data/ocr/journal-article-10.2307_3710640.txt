<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sociology of Religion: Some Areas of Theoretical Potential Louis Schneider University of Texas at Austin Five "areas" where there seems to be potential for theoretical progress in the sociology of religion are presented. One area has to do with accurately aggregating or putting together the elements of the "religious," in order to facilitate possible continuation of sophisticated functional and inter- change analysis. Another area is suggested by processes of personification and mythologization occurring in economic and political spheres often not connected with religion. A third area bears on the sociology of religion in relation to general cultural theory; and a fourth on religion as "dialec- tical." Fifthly, while close attention to more or less comprehensive views of religion for their sociological suggestiveness does not constitute an "area," it can still be theoretically most stimulating and is loosely re- ferred to as an "area." The sociology of religion, whatever else it may be, is sociology. Being so- ciology, it can be held to a notably diffi- cult ideal for the analysis of social data generally, namely, the ideal of marrying "big," important ideas with rigorous methods. Because of the difficulty of the ideal and of the high demands of a train- ing that shall embody it, there is a cer- tain danger of fragmentation. Some sociologists will be tempted to go off into social speculation, philosophy, or history. Others will be tempted to develop fine measurement instruments, redoubling their strictly technical efforts when they have lost hold of any larger non-technical aims. There is now considerable and acute awareness of, and sophistication about, these things. There are many so- ciologists not particularly liable to the temptations noted. There are possibilities in the way of teamwork for men of dif- ferent talents. But sociology does not thereby at once become an easy en- deavor, with promise of great success soon to be attained. It is not that there is warrant to sag hopelessly before the challenge that so- ciology presents. However, it is not sur- prising if its practitioners are often concerned about its progress or failure to progress, and this holds in the soci- ology of religion as elsewhere in the gen- eral field. The sociology of religion has suffered much from lack of data on matters of essential interest. On the whole it has thus far made use of rather rudi- mentary methods in a technical sense, although this may not have been alto- gether disadvantageous, given its general condition of underdevelopment. Yet de- spite this underdevelopment, the field has had the benefit of a number of reasonably "big' ideas. "Big" ideas have indeed been a rather conspicuous feature of the sociology of religion. Everyone knows that two of the authentic giants of modern sociology- 131</page><page sequence="2">132 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Durkheim and Weber-made important contributions in the field. In the histor- ical background there loom figures like Marx and Freud, shining lights in their time (with all their perversities, I, for one, would add), who did relevant and provocative work. If anthropologists like Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown lack the stature of these four men, they are still far from dwarfish in their own right. The considerable intellectual tradition this suggests has been continued (although with small debt to Marx) by that very capable "idea" man, Talcott Parsons. But the big ideas have not been replen- ished or greatly developed for some time. With all due respect to Parsons and with full regard to the significance of his work for the sociology of religion, it can be plausibly argued that he never went much beyond a synthesis of Durkheim, Weber, and perhaps one may say Freud, as far as basic insights are concerned. A good deal, of course, depends on what one means by basic insights. The concern here is particularly with the ma- jor functionalist tradition, a tradition so heavily dependent in its background on Durkheim and the anthropologists men- tioned. One of the great achievements of functionalism was the demonstration of the importance of the non-rational in human social life, of certain elements in the orientation of the actor (for the mat- ter can be put in this way) different from scientific elements, not cognate with the latter and not in any sense "inferior" to them. Parsons may be said to have consolidated this victory on the basis of the work of Durkheim, with help from Pareto, in The Structure of Social Action in 1937. It would not be unreasonable to regard this as the last main instance of theoretical develop- ment in, or pertinent to, the sociology of religion in the functionalist line. Or one might take statements in The Social System ( 1951: 164) relating to religion and Ausgleich ("the ultimate balancing of the motivational moral economy"), or religion and tension management, and regard these as such a final main in- stance of development. This would per- haps be generous, but the point could be argued. One is certainly not free to overlook the relevance to analysis of re- ligion of Parsons' ideas of structure, of his applications of cybernetic notions, of his development of concepts like that of "fundamentalism." It would not be difficult to defend the view that there is much interesting and even brilliant work here. And others besides Parsons have contributed to the sociology of re- ligion in the functionalist line. It is hardly necessary to contend that there has been hopeless stagnation. In fact, there has been a good deal of capable reinforcement and refinement, and a measure of advance, but these things are not the same as major steps forward. With this absence of really large ad- vance in a crucial line of theory, we inevitably ask how we can move ahead. The ultimate ideal for the field remains, and must remain, an effective consolida- tion of significant idea and acute method. It would be an achievement to dredge up from the sociology of religion as it has developed up to now the materials for a spectacular consolidation. But it is an unlikely achievement, given what the field up to now can offer. Perhaps one could effect some really strategic combination of functionalism, and, say, phenomenol- ogy, to help toward the ultimate ideal. But functional theory alone stands in need of further development on its own terms, to say no more. Or one might bring into the field from outside some quite new, smashing theoretical outlook that would re-order and systematize it to its lasting scientific benefit. We could not withhold admiration from anyone</page><page sequence="3">SOME AREAS OF THEORETICAL POTENTIAL 133 capable of doing such a thing, but it cannot be brought appreciably nearer by being wished for. One might at least hope for a stylish new notational scheme that would present old insights in a fresh, economical way and thereby cre- ate the prospect of catching significant things previously uncaught. Even this is not offered here. It is of course not difficult to be critical of the sociology of religion. But it is not always easy to be "constructive." I do not pretend to do more in the follow- ing five notes than to point to a few areas of theoretical potential for the field. They rest largely on the simple conviction that the field is likely to gain from broaden- ing its outlook and, indeed, the last of the notes directly advocates a deliberate effort to broaden outlook and is some- what different from the foregoing four, which address themselves to more par- ticular matters from whose consideration a broadened outlook might emerge. The ultimate ideal of consolidation of signif- icant idea and effective method is not forgotten, but the main design of the subsequent remarks is to offer a limited set of suggestions that may conceivably be helpful on the "idea" side. However conscious sociologists may be at various times of falling short of their ultimate ideal, that ideal still cannot be forced, and it is not necessarily always best ad- vanced by endeavor strictly undertaken in the light of it alone. The ways of indi- rection can be profitable in a discipline aspiring to scientific status also. In cor- respondence with the relatively "relaxed" spirit in which the following is set out, it is assumed that it is sometimes profitable even today to look back to older or pioneering work even while one appre- ciates the point that the past may be- come oppressive and constrictive. 1. A first matter has again to do with functional theory. One of the most con- spicuous developments in the sociology of religion in the last few years has been the shift of attention of a number of students in the field to nonchurchly forms or manifestations of the religious. A bare review of this development is quickly given. Bellah noted in his famil- iar article on religious evolution that it is misleading to concentrate on the church "in a discussion of the modern religious situation," for "it is precisely the charac- teristic of the new situation that the great problem of religion . . . is no longer the monopoly of any groups explicitly labeled religious" (1964: 372). And in another familiar article the same writer outlined the elements of a civil religion in America, in its way drawing on but certainly not identical with the heritages of Christian- ity and Judaism (1967: 1-21). Lloyd Warner, of whom Bellah was naturally aware, was clear on the point that he used the word "sacred," not only with reference to the specifically, convention- ally religious sphere of the Christian faith, but used it also to apply "to ob- jects and phases of life to which the special reverence arising from religion in general has been extended" (1959: 5). Peter Berger's A Rumor of Angels turns away from what its author sees as a conventional churchly supernaturalism in decline and toward examination of a number of possibly constant sources of religious impulse-one might say inti- mations of the divine-that could give nourishment to religion in all sorts of nonchurchly loci (1969). Luckmann is another of the sociologists disposed to look for manifestations of religion out- side specialized religious forms or in- stitutions (1967). This extra-churchly orientation is hardly confined to sociol- ogists. Thus, Harvey Cox the theologian, cites Bellah, Berger, and Luckmann with evident approval and writes: "Just as education is not by any means confined</page><page sequence="4">134 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS to schools, so religion cannot be equated with what goes on in churches. Any theologian must today be something of a theologian of culture"' (1961: 173). This statement by Cox actually touches on something most significant for the- oretical development in the sociology of religion. If the concern with the non- churchly forms of the religious or sacred has any merit at all, then the functional- ist theory, in particular, would appear to face a considerable task of "aggregat- ing" the religious, marking out its com- ponents in a variety of places and "&lt;packaging" them properly for analytical purposes. Just as the "political' has to be aggregated and packaged or put to- gether, since it is not confined to "state" or "government," so a similar problem arises for the religious. This is the more important since Parsonian theory, in par- ticular, has in recent years given so much stress to interchanges (as between cul- ture and personality system within the large "action" context). It is hard to see how any very full or impressive theory of interchange could be built without pulling together the elements of "re- ligion" that may be found at various loci.2 Even if we are not concerned with interchange in particular, the entire pre- occupation with the nonchurchly-reli- gious still awaits a full, distinctive functionalist development. It seems fair to say that there is a large challenge here and possibly a chance for function- alist thought to give evidence of further vitality. 2. But the wanderings of the religious or sacred are hardly done with yet. It has become virtually banal to suggest that movements like Marxism need seri- ous consideration in the light of the question whether they are religious or contain religious components.3 No more than beginnings are made with the ques- tion when, on the one hand, one notes within Marxism such things as the pre- sumption of a loaded historical process that in the end makes for an inevitable triumph of good over evil or notes the presence within Marx himself of a pas- sion for social justice of quite possibly religious origin breaking through an ostensibly scientific socialism; or, on the other hand, such things as Berger sug- 1 It is of interest in connection with the concern of non-sociologists for certain extra- churchly religious phenomena that Marty sug- gests that Bellah tended to "slight the historians' [pertinent] contributions in dealing with the past" when he discussed civil religion and that Williams writes that Bellah is "unaware . . . of the extensive historical literature on this subject and even of a quite articulate contemporary exposition: Duncan Howlett, The Fourth American Faith." (Cutler, 1969: 31;493) The present interest in this of course has to do with the suggestion of concern with the nonchurchly religious or sacred beyond the circle of sociol- ogists. Theologians are obviou ly also similarly concerned. The philosopher Huston Smith looks penetratingly for shifts in the locus of the sacred on the contemporary scene. (Cutler, 1968: ch. 16) Writers such as Joseph Campbell, who functions in a college department of litera- ture, and Frederick Elder, a minister by pro- fession, do work that is most suggestive with regard to the extension of the religious beyond conventional frameworks and categories. (Cut- ler, 1968: ch. 17; 1969: ch. 18, ch. 2) Marty (p. 32) notes popular-periodical indications of new religious (and magical) concern. The most recent indication of such concern in a popular periodical to come to the writer's attention is "The search for faith," in Life for January 9, 1970. The larger backgrounds of this whole development are beyond the scope of this article. 2 Parsons has been receptive to the idea of the diffusion of the sacred insofar, at least, as he has taken up Bellah's notion of civil religion, which he does with some enthusiasm in his "Religion in a Modern Pluralistic Society," (1966: 125-146). His expectably affirmative stance toward Bellah's paper on evolution (which contains the statement we have quoted on religion as no longer monopolized by "groups explicitly labeled religious") is indicated in Cutler (1968: 688). 3 Some pertinent matters are covered by Mary-Barbara Zeldin (1969: 100-111).</page><page sequence="5">SOME AREAS OF THEORETICAL POTENTIAL 135 gests when he observes that "the wis- dom of Marxism is unlikely to afford much comfort to an individual facing a cancer operation" (1969: 32). No one would want confusion introduced into a field that is in any case difficult enough. Why go chasing after "religious ele- ments" in a phenomenon like Marxism when there are at least surface indica- tions that in some respects it can well be argued not to be religious and there is sufficient work to do elsewhere? But the matter is not so easily disposed of and it would hardly do to shirk a neces- sary task. Birnbaum reminds us that Friedrich Engels observed that, in a re- ligious epoch, "even revolutionary ideas have to be expressed in a religious rhetoric" (in Cutler, 1968: 917). Then perhaps in a political epoch (if that is what ours is) even religious ideas have to be expressed in a political rhetoric. If we're not going to be fooled by forms or appearances, let's not be fooled by them. Whatever conclusions we may ulti- mately reach in regard to the religious character of Marxism, the entire notion of the diffusion of the religious is sug- gestive in other ways. It may serve to remind us of the need for doing things that we have tended to put aside. In the present context of reference to Marxism, it is worth recalling that Marxism does have a scientific side. Marx was one of the significant modern contributors to the idea of religion or myth (not neces- sarily "religious") as arising out of social circumstance. When he discussed the fetishism of commodities, as is well known (1936: 81-96; 1909: 962-968), he afforded a powerful delineation (how- ever obsolete the relevant framework of economic analysis has become) of how the results of men's actions in economic context confronted them as phenomena which they could no longer trace to their authentic human sources. He wrote of the producers in the capitalist economy that "to them their own social action takes the form of the action of objects which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them" (1936: 86). The elements of a sociology of knowledge and of economic and political myth are certainly present in his work. Economic and political mythology has hardly ceased to be important. Myths about races and ethnic groups, too, are no- toriously widespread in the modem world. Processes of hypostatizing, per- sonifying and demonizing are constantly at work in a kind of "natural" mythologi- cal development, a kind of bad poetry- bad because it rests on false or inaccu- rate perceptions and on a literal under- standing of its own metaphors.4 An economic depression can still seem to be something like a hostile visitation from another world-an arbitrary, self- willed, autonomous thing-although no doubt this perception differs by societies and other groups. Witches, devils and angels in human form are always with us. The idea that the realm of politics, for example, is a realm of myth is not a novel one by any means.5 Nationalism has often been scrutinized for its possi- ble religious content. But there is a potential here to which the sociology of religion has hardly been sufficiently alert. The possibilities of close affiliation with the sociology of religion of studies of 4 This is not to deny that there can be spon- taneous social production of "good" poetry. Any effort to interpret, say, touchy race relations exclusively in terms of poetry, without refer- ence to the terrible social and personal con- sequences or concomitants of "bad" poetry, would obviously be disastrously wrong, if it is really necessary to say this. 5 Note Claude Levi-Strauss's interesting ref- erence to "myth and what appears largely to have replaced it in modem societies, namely, politics." (See Levi-Strauss in William A. Lessa and Evon Z. Vogt, 1968: 563)</page><page sequence="6">136 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS race prejudice and its ideologies, of the psychodynamics of politically significant personality types have not begun to be properly explored. Political mythology should be of prime interest to sociologists of religion. Perhaps the rather impover- ished state of economic sociology ex- plains something of the reluctance of sociologists of religion to look for legiti- mate objects of concern in the economic realm. Students of Marxism have long been aware of the possibility of turning its own weapons of sociological analysis against it and exploring the character and foundations of its own mythical components. Three points are worth stressing at the price of some repetition. First, it is not being unequivocally, flatly contended that "Marxism" (a complex, various thing) is a "religion." Rather, that prop- osition needs (and will undoubtedly get) further serious analysis. Second, it is certainly not contended that the area of political, ethnic, economic mythology, with the above referred-to processes of hypostatizing, personifying and demon- izing it presents, necessarily must be a "religious" area. The religious or sacred in some fairly strict sense may be more to the fore in some of the things to be studied in this area and much less to the fore in others. But the whole idea of the diffusion of the religious, of its extension to nonchurchly spheres, may be utilized to motivate us to be more alert than ever to common mythic ele- ments shared by things religious and certain things non-religious. Third, it is recognized that words like religious and sacred, even if many of us still regard them as indispensable, give us a lot of trouble already. There is no desire to allow them unwarranted further exten- sion. It is merely one of the circum- stances attesting the underdevelopment of the sociology of religion that its vo- cabulary is not up to the clear statement of its problems. 3. Cox has been quoted as saying: "Any theologian today must be some- thing of a theologian of culture." It would seem desirable for the sociologist of religion to be more than a little of a student of culture in general. It is important for him to be this in follow- ing the movement of religion, in itself, and in relation to other things. Broadly speaking, we have thus far exploited some possibilities of considering the re- ligious or sacred to be more diffused or pervasive than it has been considered to be up until recently, at least in a good deal of Western thought, and even the previous note, with its suggested reserva- tion that much in the realm of political and economic mythologies is not re- ligious (even if it is mythical), was to some extent motivated by the same no- tion of diffusion of the religious. But it is also true that much that "looks" religious is, or has been cogently argued to be, only superficially so. In facing up to such contentions, we would be greatly aided by a really penetrating theory of culture. To indicate what is intended here, it is well to note that there are at least three meanings that may attach to the assertion that certain things are only superficially religious-meanings that may be here designated as reduction- meanings, manifestation-meanings and plus Va change plus c'est la meme chose- meanings. Charles Francis Adams, in his study of the so-called antinomian controversy of 1636-38 in Massachusetts, the con- troversy centrally involving Anne Hutch- inson, remarks that that controversy was "in reality not a religious dispute, which was but the form it took." Adams thought that the controversy was properly seen as "the first of many New England quick-</page><page sequence="7">SOME AREAS OF THEORETICAL POTENTIAL 137 enings in the direction of social, intel- lectual and political development-New England's earliest protest against for- mulas"6 (1892: 367). Quite indepen- dently of Adams, Belfort Bax, in his often cited study of the Anabaptists pub- lished soon after the turn of the century, writes of "the religious garb" of move- ments of the Anabaptist type and time- a garb which "allows us plainly to see through to the deeper-lying social dis- content which constituted [their] real substance" (1903: 133-4). Bax tends to be defensive of the Anabaptists, more particularly with regard to their conduct in Miinster, and sees men like Munzer, Jan of Leyden, and Jan Matthys, "with all their shortcomings" as in a sense "forerunners of Modern Socialism"8 (1903: 391). But what is of interest here once more is the tendency to think that the "real significance" of certain osten- sibly "religious" phenomena is not "re- ligious." Adams and Bax have been drawn upon rather than other men who might do equally well because of certain in- terests I have at the present time. But others could certainly have been drawn upon. Neither Adams nor Bax makes his meaning very clear in statements crucial for present purposes. Each man might conceivably be interpreted as talking about a manifestation, within the religious sphere, of things also to be perceived elsewhere, outside the reli- gious sphere. Thus, Adams might be construed to be saying that there was a general, widespread movement, at the time he writes of, against rigid modes of thought and behavior that showed itself in religion as elsewhere. This suggests a kind of simultaneous, more or less "equal" operation of generic forces in different specific areas. Bax might be interpreted in much the same way. The "deeper-lying social discontent" of which he writes might then, once more, be manifesting itself in religion as elsewhere. On this interpretation, one might well wonder about the "religious" character of what one sees in the religious sphere. What one sees in that sphere might merely be a specifically religiously col- ored form of a more general reality. Dissident Catholic priests today com- plain about hierarchy, authority, struc- ture, and hardened institutions, but they share precisely these complaints with alienated college students in large pub- lic universities. The priests' perceptions and ideology could very plausibly be interpreted as manifestations in the re- ligious sphere (and perhaps given a somewhat peculiar coloring in that 6 Contemporary treatments of the contro- versy are to be found in Emery Battis (1962) and in Kai T. Erikson (1966). It may be noted in passing that however disturbing Anne Hut- chinson's religious enthusiasm may have been among her contemporaries she was not much of an antinomian. As Battis (p. 287) remarks, "'Certainly with Mrs. Hutchinson and her col- leagues the deeply implanted inhibitions of Puritan morality precluded the grosser be- havioral possibilities of the Antinomian posi- tion." Erikson (p. 85) remarks: "Anne Hutchin- son may not have been an Antinomian in the purest sense...." 7 See also pp. 166-167, where the phrase "religious or theological garb" is again used in the same sense. This inevitably again reminds us of Engels' observation that in a religious epoch even revolutionary ideas have to be ex- pressed in a religious rhetoric. 8 Bax, incidentally, has some interesting com- ments on antinomianism. The Anabaptist move- ment has had particular attention paid to it in recent years by Marxists, and the impulse for this evidently goes back to Engels' view of the Reformation disturbances in Germany as heralds of the bourgeois revolution. See Otthein Rammstedt's sociological analysis of MUnster, (1966: 118) and the Marxist dissertation by Gerhard Brendler (1966).</page><page sequence="8">138 SOCtOLOGICAL ANALYSIS sphere) of more general phenomena "equally" appearing in other spheres.9 Adams and Bax might be differently interpreted. Their meaning might be, not a manifestation-meaning, but a reduction-meaning. This is perhaps par- ticularly the case for Bax. In a reduction- meaning, one could hold a bias to the effect that a kind of false consciousness, a kind of illusion appeared in the case of, say, the Anabaptists at Munster. Their fantasies would need translation into another language. We would be in the presence of false renderings or deri- vations of the realities of class conflict and the like. Whatever portion of truth this may contain and however subtly that might have to be worked out, it is of interest that a shrewd present-day Marx- ist (Gerhard Brendler) takes Karl Kaut- sky to task on the subject of Anabaptism and writes of "religious motives not reducible without remainder to economic reasons for action;" while just prior to this he remarks of Kautsky's work (in language mercilessly orthodox but in- telligently cautious): "His economic re- ductions of ideological realities eliminate the ruling dialectical reciprocal action between economy and ideology and negate the relative independence of ideological phenomena" (1966: 49). But a reduction-meaning still must involve at least a component of reduction, as in the sense above suggested. The re- ligious appearance is in some measure deceptive in that it is, precisely, an appearance that cannot be taken simply at face value. In a third possible interpretation, Adams and Bax (or others who write in rather similar terms) might be con- ceived to be saying that we can see the significance of the New England antinomianism of 1636-1638 and of Anabaptism and its travail at Miinster some hundred years earlier if we recog- nize that they were only religious expressions of trans-historical or trans- cultural impulses which might at other times and in other places take a non- religious form. We would accordingly be fooled by them if we took their "re- ligious" character too seriously. Adams remarked provocatively that to call a man an antinomian in Anne Hutchin- son's time and place was "merely an- other way of calling him a lawless libertine or a ferocious revolutionist" (1892: 432). There is reason to think that there is much similarity between statements such as "She is a witch" and "She is neurotic," when these state- ments are transhistorical or transcultural (O'Dea, 1966: 112). This is emphatically not to deny that the verbalization, "She is a witch" may be accompanied by very different consequences from those that accompany "She is neurotic." And those different consequences are obviously im- portant. But there can still be a powerful strain toward cross-cultural similarity in that the statements or verbalizations address themselves to the same or quite similar phenomena. Plus qa change plus c est la meme chose. It is not merely that when a shift does in fact occur from "witch" to "neurotic"'0 something like "secularization" may be at work. That need not be denied. It is that a different language and a different interpretative frame translate much the same expe- rience. There are striking cases where relevant shifts are hard to misinterpret. I have suggested elsewhere, after F. J. E. Wood- bridge, that a pious man of an earlier day might have called sweetheart or wife "a handmaiden of the Lord." But 9 These observations have their grounding in interviewing of a group of dissident priests done by the writer in 1968-1969. 10 I recognize that there may be a good deal of simplifying in this quick formulation.</page><page sequence="9">SOME AREAS OF THEORETICAL POTENTIAL 139 the woman would in time become "a very fine girl"; and, in further time, "quite a kid." The language involved in "handmaiden of the Lord" could have rather little religious significance and might be hardly more than an archaic way of saying "a very fine girl." The religious quality of the early language could be but a thin veil cast over a sentiment substantially the same over several centuries1' (Cf. Schneider in Zollschan, 1964: 371-400). Granted, not all our cases are in principle so simple.12 Granted, too, that the threefold distinc- tion developed above could stand a good deal more explanation than it has re- ceived here. It has received enough, it may be allowed, to suggest the gains that might come to the sociologist of religion from a developed theory of cul- ture. The "character" of different cul- tural spheres, the relative autonomy of those spheres, their tendency to change at the same or different times and the measurement of the time differentials, the rationale for regarding various phe- nomena as transhistorically or trans- culturally "equivalent"-these are all relevant things. Religion cannot be ade- quately studied in isolation from its cultural neighbors. The threefold dis- tinction introduced points to jobs that could yield considerable theoretical gains. They are jobs that will have to be done (with whatever help can be got- ten from other disciplines) if a success- ful historical and comparative sociology of religion is ever going to emerge. 4. The sociologist of religion cannot afford to forget the simple, very general point that certain things that occur in the religious sphere also occur else- where. Religion is a sphere rife with paradoxes, dilemmas, "contradictions," oppositions. In this broad sense, it is eminently dialectical (See Leach; 1968). One may study religious statements alone for evidence of stress on counter- balancing themes or entities and forces, and one can also study religion in a more comprehensive sense-religion in action-for evidence of similar things. Consider a forest hermitage in Ceylon referred to by Obeyesekere (in Leach; 1968: 37). Monks had come to live in caves at the hermitage. But they could not remain isolated in meditation and free of the world. Their fame brought the world (involving laymen and alms) to them. The state of holiness of the monks could greatly benefit laymen, but the very availability to laymen that would accord the benefit would at the same time reduce the monks' holiness. Paradox, dilemma, "contradiction," op- position are thus readily suggested. Con- sideration of these can cast considerable light on religion and on the connections and affinities of religious with nonre- ligious phenomena. The entire subject of dialectic in re- ligion is an immense one. But let us just stress opposition or oppositeness in two roughly discriminated contexts. One is 11 I am persuaded that Sorokin's Social and Cultural Dynamics is now underrated in Ameri- can sociology, but it was one of the limitations of Sorokin's work that he often took at face value ostensibly considerable cultural "differ- ences" that analysis could show to be rather superficial. 12 The whole point involved here should not be labored, but it may be reinforced by reference to folk sayings, where equivalences are often, admittedly, ridiculously easy to see. One group says, "The grass is always greener in the other fellow's field;" another, "Other men's women are always the prettiest ones." We might want to make the obvious reservation that one group has had agricultural experiences in its eye and the other, shall we say, amatory experiences, but we cannot doubt that the statements are merely different forms of ren- dering the same sentiment-or perhaps one can say, without cynicism, the same perception. And when we find that still another group says, "There it is good where we are not," we can only applaud this gifted generalization of the same sentiment or perception. The different expressions of the same thing do not deceive.</page><page sequence="10">140 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS a "logical" context, which may be il- lustrated by antinomianism, although it is not necessary to refer again to the weak form of it that appeared in New England in 1636-1638. Antinomianism crops up in religion with some frequency. It is certainly not confined to Christian- ity. But it is often described in terms that suggest a peculiar religious ten- sion and opposition. Thus, Bax includes among phenomena that "alike found their place in the ranks of the Anabap- tists and of the later sects of the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries" both "the mortification of the flesh of the anchorite" and 'the unbridled lascivious- ness of the libertine." (He remarks that "religious asceticism in sexual matters has invariably throughout history car- ried its own reaction with it. It has always tended to pass over into its op- posite" 1903: 14, 204.) Opposition is further suggested by the common theme that to the pure all things are pure, for it implies that the pure can harmlessly, without peril to their spiritual welfare, give themselves over to all kinds of im- purity (See Cohn; 1961: Appendix). Dbllinger, in his vivid account of the me- dieval Gnostic-Manichaean sects, points out how, via the institution of the Con- solamentium among the Cathari, with which a "good end" indispensable to sal- vation was made, antinomianism was encouraged, for one who was certain of salvation at the end of life could afford to be unrestrainedly licentious until the end (although by no means all were) (1960: 211-2; 216-17). It is significant that the Cathari, generally, rejected mar- riage and contended that a married man, too, looked upon his wife with lust and was accordingly sinful. A more recent student of Catharist morality, in touching upon the dualisti- cally grounded notion of liberation from this evil world, notes that one could scorn the flesh in libertinism or punish and repress it in asceticism13 (Koch, 1962: 107). That the soul is untouched by what the body does is a common antinomian idea. Koch observes: "The origins as well as the goals of libertinism were the same as those of asceticism. The two orientations were but two poles of a fundamental disposition, which pro- posed disdain for matter" (p. 116). In politics, the fundamental rejection of the notion that a social order is susceptible of any considerable reform may unite extremists of the right and left. In a second context in which opposi- tion or oppositeness may be stressed, we become especially alert to various pro- cesses and mechanisms. This "processuar' context may be conceived to overlap with the "logical." Cohn, writing of the persecution of the Anabaptists, observes: 'This persecution in the end created the very danger it was intended to forestall." (p. 275) This is a quite com- monplace example of suggestion of mechanisms whereby the opposite of something intended is brought about. The religious sphere constantly exhibits this kind of thing. So do other sociocultural spheres. Certain paradoxes in the sphere of religion suggest that processes of indirection often will in fact "work" bet- ter than direct efforts to attain various goals or results. Thus Battis voices the at least plausible suspicion that ",the most substantial strides toward religious freedom have generally been made, not by the dedicated and articulate propo- nents of that end, but rather by the strenuous endeavors of innumerable see- tarians . . . to gain religious freedom for themselves." He adds: "In the long run religious heterogeneity and the force of numbers were more powerful persuaders than rational arguments in producing this great social change" (1962: vii). 13 This is formally a Marxist work, but its scholarship and its analysis are not stultified by Marxist pieties.</page><page sequence="11">SOME AREAS OF THEORETICAL POTENTIAL 141 Heimert's work on American religion ( 1936) features a thesis to the effect that it was precisely orthodox or conservative ("evangelical") religion that carried strong democratic seeds within itself and afforded impulse or energy to popular activity-not "liberal" religion. (Gener- ally relevant in the present discussion is the circumstance that Max Weber's work in the sociology of religion was imbued with a deep sense of how men constantly brought about results that they had never contemplated and that could even-a la the notion of "the tragedy of the idea"-contravene their intentions.) Paradox, dilemma, contradiction, op- position or oppositeness are indeed broad notions. It may seem almost as if the above is designed to suggest that so- ciologists of religion should work-in the field of the sociology of religion. But a fuller statement than has been possi- ble here would make it quite plain that a major result to be hoped for from dialectical sensitivity is the discrimina- tion and precise description of particular patterns of "logic" in religion that are also important elsewhere (as in the case of the "logic" of libertinism-asceticism); and of processes and mechanisms that are only dimly grasped or quite unknown now. All this could conceivably make a large contribution to what Merton calls "theories of the middle range," in the particular case of the sociology of re- ligion-regardless of whether or not one is inclined to think present-day sociology should especially concentrate on attain- ing theories of the middle range. 5. In a somewhat different vein, finally, it may not be amiss to stress that it is profitable in the sociology of religion to pay close attention to more or less comprehensive views of religion for their sociological suggestiveness. In this con- nection, it is worth recalling, for exam- ple, that there have been various state- ments of what it is well to label a "poetic" view of religion. Some important ten- dencies in this are suggested by the work of the early Santayana, who set out the notion that "religion and poetry are iden- tical in essense and differ merely in the way in which they are attached to prac- tical affairs,"&gt; poetry being called reli- gion "when it intervenes in life," while religion, "when it merely supervenes upon life, is seen to be nothing but poetry" (1957: v). On the basis of this outlook, Santayana thought it well for religion not to claim to deal analytically with the "empirical" world, since it had "ideal" functions different from, and in principle not in conflict with, those of science. It was accordingly possible for him to say that "science should be math- ematical and religion anthropomorphic" (1936: 204); the former rigorously pre- cise in its language, the latter utilizing poetic symbols. Santayana offers us an instance of a transparent bit of "poetry" or myth: "Punishment, limping in one leg, pa- tiently follows every criminal" (1935: 12). The personification here cannot be missed. This is a way of saying that there is a rough or lagging tendency for criminals to be caught up with. As San- tayana puts the matter, in stating the myth he has "expressed a truth of expe- rience and pointed vaguely to the course which events may be expected to take under given circumstances" (1935: 12). The poetic view of religion takes much religious language as metaphorical state- ment of a variety of truths. It is clear that the poetic view in one form or another has had considerable influence in theological work and in work on mythology and literature. Max Muller's old theory that religion was in a way due to a corruption of language has plain affinities with the poetic view.'4 The 14 See the analysis in Emile Durkheim (1926: 71-86).</page><page sequence="12">142 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS poetic view has an evident pertinence to demythologization. To say that there is a lagging tendency for criminals to get caught up with is indeed to demyth- ologize Santayana's little myth. The po- etic view is likely to be accompanied by a certain friendliness toward religion and a disposition to notice its functional- i.e., eufunctional-aspects (as well as by a certain discomfort about or antag- onism toward such conventional super- natural features as it may have). A phi- lospher like Santayana, something of an authentic poet himself, is unlikely to be inimical to what he takes to be poetry in action. It is in line with the entire tendency of Santayana's outlook on re- ligion that he should treat prayer, for example, in a functionalist manner. He insists first that "no chapter in theology is more unhappy than that in which a material efficacy is assigned to prayer." It is simply not the case that "the most orthodox and hard-praying army wins the most battles." But prayer has its "true uses," for "it clarifies the ideal;" "it reconciles to the inevitable;" and "it fosters spiritual life by conceiving it in its perfection." Prayer will not bring rain, "but until rain comes it may cul- tivate hope and resignation and may prepare the heart for any issue" (1957: 41-47). The larger philosophical context, of Santayana's thought in particular, within which this so briefly stated view comes, the precise relation of Santayana's poetic view to that of other and more recent thinkers, the matter of just how "tran- scendence" may be accommodated in a poetic view of religion, the question that James B. Pratt so keenly presented of how one might get "benefits" from prayer without belief in premises upon which the act of prayer is grounded-these and other interesting things have to be left aside. I do not pretend to evaluate Santayana's views here. I am for now more concerned with their suggestive- ness. The need to study aesthetic objects in relation to religion is clearly sug- gested. It is small wonder, in the poetic view of religion, that men of letters, for instance, should often be greatly inter- ested in religion for their part. And the sociologist can ill afford to reject possi- ble help in comprehending religion qua cultural form. Something is perhaps sug- gested also by the poetic view with re- gard to the attitudes of "the common man." The views of philosophers are often entertained in less articulate, less systematic form by more ordinary per- sons. It is at any rate possible that a certain amount of "poetic" sympathy with religion is concealed under ostensi- ble rejection of it and that a certain religious potential is accordingly under- estimated in a population that is asked questions that are too simple. The need for study of hypostatization or reification of the poetic is reinforced. Archaic lan- guage (or archaism generally) is sug- gested as a field of study in the sociology and psychology of religion, and the an- cient question of whether new wine can be poured into old bottles is posed in a new richness, when religion is perceived as "poetic." There could clearly be dangers in tak- ing a poetic view of religion, including the danger of forgetting that religion in action can be devastatingly "unpoetic," as when it is exploitative or submissive to the powers that be. Adherents of a poetic view can learn something from those more determined to show "un- friendliness" toward religion. The poetic view points us to things that are of sociological interest, true, but it might be said that we could come upon them by other ways and that they are in any case not startingly novel, even if a cer- tain novelty may be present here and</page><page sequence="13">SOME AREAS OF THEORETICAL POTENTIAL 143 there. Moreover, sociologists of religion are already well aware of the need to "broaden" themselves, in such fields as theology, for instance (and a number of them are theologically more than pas- sably informed). All this may be ac- knowledged. But it does no harm what- ever in an area like the sociology of religion to stress again and again the utility of broad outlooks. The sources of such outlooks, and their richness, may differ. If we could and should ever de- velop a sociology of religion without appreciable affinities with history, cul- ture theory, theology, perhaps even phi- losophy and literature, it would hardly be worth having.'5 This is not to forget the indispensable need for the sociology of religion (as for sociology in general), in the end, to combine vision with sound method. It is only to remember that sociology (and the sociology of religion more so than most other subfields there- of) is a difficult discipline. The above notes have drawn on a number of analytical traditions. This I believe to be unavoidable in a richly problematic area like that of the soci- ology of religion. The notes may seem remote from "empirical" concerns. The obvious suggestion can be made that they will seem less remote if "empirical" is not defined with arbitrary narrowness. Why turn back to past thought so much? Is not the object to move ahead? No antiquarianism has been intended here. If one does go back, it is precisely in the hope of finding a better way ahead. 15 One need not overlook the point that a science may sometimes move ahead and de- velop a powerful paradigm, a theoretical model commanding great consensus within a field, in Kuhn's sense, while it narrows its range. (See Kuhn, 1962.) But the narrowing is not neces- sarily permanent. We go on the presumption that a sociology of religion that shall in some sense be scientifically adequate sooner or later will have to deal with problems that in a present view involve appreciable affinities with the areas mentioned.
