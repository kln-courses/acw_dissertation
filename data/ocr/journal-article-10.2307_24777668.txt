<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hands of Milton : Blake's Multistable Image of Self-Annihilation THOMAS DILWORTH If Blake's works were to be assigned like the chapters of Joyce's Ulysses to parts of the human body, most readers would assign Milton to the foot. A better choice might be the hand. In the poem, self-annihilation for the poet Milton does involve his entering Blake through the latter's left foot. But artistic creation, of which self-annihilation is an essential aspect, is primarily the work of hands. And more than any other of Blake's illuminated books, Milton emphasizes hands as symbols of creative agency in its text and illuminations.1 One of its illuminations in particular is especially important because it depicts hands by way of an unusual optical illusion. This unusual visual image, which appears on plate thirty-six of the poem, is multistable; that is, it elicits two different visual interpretations which are nearly equally clear or compelling, so that the viewer perceives sometimes the one and sometimes the other. Although Blake commentators have not noticed multistable imagery in plate thirty-six—or, for that matter, anywhere else in Blake's illuminations— they do frequently point out images in the illuminations which evoke what W.J.T. Mitchell calls "multiple, equivocal, transformatory, and even contradictory associations."2 The wave-form that envelopes Oothoon in the illumination on plate four of Visions of the Daughters of Albion is an example: it may be interpreted as an ocean wave or a flame of passion—or both, in what amounts to a sensory oxymoron. Such paradoxical inclusiveness Mosaic XV1/3 0027-1276-83/010011-17J01.50 ©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">12 Thomas Dilworth resembles the multistable effect, though multistability is a matter of clear double vision which precludes interpretive ambiguity. In the history of graphic arts, the multistable effect is often mere trickery but here, in Blake's illumination, it is symbolic, as double images always are for Blake. Unlike other kinds of double image, however, this one actually effects what it symbolizes. As a consequence, plate thirty-six contains what is, in some respects, the central illumination of Milton. This illumination depicts the Blakean universe, with a line indicating the route of Milton to Golgonooza, the center of true art. The diagram is a map of sorts, complete with compass bearings, but like the poem's other engrav ings it also illuminates narrative action. The action here is that of self annihilation and artistic creation—which, conceptually at least, involve all the poem's artist-figures acting in unison. Their multiple, simultaneous activity is the subject of the entire poem, and, in this illumination, is not merely implied—by the track of Milton's journey, for example—but is actually depicted. This is consonant with the other Milton illuminations, which are unusual in Blake's prophetic books for their straightforward illustration of the text.3 Direct illustration of this kind in plate thirty-six involves the subtle rendering of two hands thrust, thumbs foremost to the viewer, down from the circle of Urthona to contain the fire of Satan within the Mundane Shell (Fig. I).4 The hands are not actually in the flames, but in the spaces to either side of them, within the Shell. That these hands have not been noticed by Blake critics is understandable, since even when one knows what to look for they may at first be difficult to distinguish. The hand to the left of the flames has a thumb narrower than the anatomical norm, and the fingers of the hand to the right of the flames are not fully outlined. The outline of each hand, furthermore, also delineates the flames. Since the eye cannot easily take in at once images joined, as these are, by a common bounding line, the viewer must quickly and repeatedly look from one side to the other of the line. To see the hands one must cease temporarily to see the flames. For this reason, therefore, the hands will suddenly appear to some viewers if the illumination is inverted. An abstraction of the Shell, in which the hands are darkened and appear alone, may serve to aid recognition (Fig. 2). The only previous interpretation of this illumination that suggests a multistable effect is that of Kay Parkhurst Easson and Roger R. Easson, who see the entire area outlined by the flames as "claw-shaped" with "finger-like projections."51 quote phrases that suggest a perception similar to my own, but the Eassons interpret the area in question as the Polypus of sensory delusion.6 Their interpretation is awkward because it places the Polypus and Ulro, with which it is identified (pi. 34:24), in contradistinction to Satan's sphere, whereas Ulro is the "Seat of Satan" (pi. 27:45). John Howard makes better cosmological sense when he sees the Polypus in "the flames as tentacle-like projections."7 But he is no more convincing, for the Polypus cannot be identified exclusively with Satanic flames; it is the entire Vegetable</page><page sequence="3">Blake's Multistable Imagery 13 Fig. 1.

Probably the Polypus, like most of the rest of Blake's cosmology in Milton, is not depicted.8 This may be because Blake's cosmology defies two-dimensional representation. Another reason may be that plate thirty-six is only in part a map, and further cosmological detail would obscure what it also is—an illumination of the cosmic action of artistic hands. There is a centuries-old tradition of multistable imagery which provides a context, and possibly a matrix, for Blake's double image of hands-and flames. The tradition may begin in the late fifteenth century with the Paduan painter Andrea Mantegna, who put faces in his clouds. But the first major Fig. 3. Arcimboldo's Vertumnus</page><page sequence="5">Blake's Multistable Imagery 15 Fig. 4. Claude Fortier, Anthropomorphic Landscape, ca. 1800. influence in the tradition is the sixteenth-century Milanese mannerist painter Guiseppe Arcimboldo, who painted composite heads which are both portraits and piles of vegetables or fruit. Vertumnus is an example (Fig. 3).9 Arcimboldo had many imitators whose multistable portraits were widely copied by engravers during the Romantic period.10 Multistable images actually became something of a vogue in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries among engravers, particularly among carica turists. Their fascination with the visual effect may be owing to contemporary optical experimentation.11 An example of the effect in work by a contempor ary of Blake is Claude Fortier's engraving of a rugged outcrop of rock which is also the head of a giant in profile (Fig. 4).12 Composite portraits were used, in particular, for political caricature. In the early years of the French Revolu tion, pornographic composite heads of counterrevolutionaries were widely distributed throughout the new republic. These portraits consist of writhing bodies engaged in multiple sexual activity.13 In countries later conquered by the French armies, patriots could buy prints of Napoleon whose profile comprises the cadavers of his victims.14 Such portraits are multistable because they must be perceived in alternating stages. As Arcimboldo writes, "the eye is invited to decompose and to reconstruct the total image."15 The particular kind of multistable image Blake uses, however, involves the juxtaposition of positive and negative spaces in such a way that the Gestalt relationship of figure to ground is reversable. In about 1795, this sort of Fig. 4. Claude Fortier, Anthropomorphic Landscape, ca. 1800.</page><page sequence="6">16 Thomas Dilxvorth Fig. 5. Anonymous, L'urne mystérieuse, ca. 1795. multistability characterizes political prints like the anonymous L'urne mystérieuse, which appealed to royalists in mourning for the overthrown mon archy (Fig. 5).16 The outline of the urn is formed by the profiles of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, and in the tree above are the profiles of their children. A later caricature which post-dates Blake but which also has special affinity with his image of hands-and-flames is an 1834 caricature of King Louis Philippe as a non-person—a visual metaphor of the wish that he disappear from the political scene (Fig. 6).17 As illustrative of self-annihilation, this sort of multistability is uniquely effective because it achieves the one effect that no other kind of image can. It makes absence visible. Fig. 5. Anonymous, L'urne mystérieuse, ca. 1795.</page><page sequence="7">Blake 's Multistable Imagery 17 A political radical, like the young Blake, might have been familiar with the use of multistable images in political satire. Blake's apprenticeship with the engraver Basire, and his life-long work as an engraver make it very likely, furthermore, that he knew of the professional interest in multistable images among engravers. The modern master within the multistable tradition is also a graphic artist, M.C. Escher. His work makes an interesting comparison with Blake's plate thirty-six of Milton. Because Escher's periodic drawings are usually solid shapes of alternating light and dark, the balance between competing interpretations of the visual image is exact (Fig. 7).18 In contrast, Blake's Fig. 6. Anonymous, Louis-Philippe, Charivari, 1834.</page><page sequence="8">18 Thomas Dilworth Fig. 7. M. C. Escher, Birds and Flying Fish. image is, even in colored plates, roughly uniform in tone. Because the hands in Blake's illumination are not, moreover, completely delineated, the multistable balance is not exact, as in Escher, but weighted in favor of the flames. In Blake the alternating images are not, as in Escher, entirely contiguous : the hands do not occupy all the space within the Shell unoccupied by the flames. This too contributes to an imbalance, which minimizes the presence of the hands. But the imbalance harmonizes with the action it helps to illuminate. Escher's tesselated images are easy to perceive partly because their interest is merely optical and geometrical. Blake's multistable effect is harder to perceive but, as I hope to show, this accords with its symbolic and dramatic meaning. At any rate, the appearance of the hands within the Mundane Shell is probably not coincidental, particularly in light of their analogues in the text and in the poem's other illuminations. The hands of Milton are those of the poets, sculptors and musicians who appear throughout the illuminated poem—among them the poet Milton, Blake as narrator, Palamabron, the Bard, Los and the sons of Los. The work's literary and visual leitmotif of hands is an important aspect of the assimilation of the poem's artists into the figure of Los, their archetype, and ultimately into the anagogical figure of Jesus. On the level of cosmic myth, the hands of all true artists are initially those of Los. In a special sense, then, the flickering hands in the cosmic diagram on plate thirty-six belong to Los. They exist within the Mundane Shell, which is Fig. 7. M. C. Escher, Birds and Flying Fish.</page><page sequence="9">Blake 's Multistable Imagery 19 "the Universe of Los," and attach at the wrists to the circle of Urthona— who is Los within the Shell (pi. 19:25). The Shell encloses the hands, but the hands also sustain and partly constitute the Shell, for the outline of the back of both hands is also the outline of the Shell. Los is, after all, an Atlas-figure, whose constant struggle sustains the world and averts cosmic disaster.19 The name Atlas derives from the Greek for "the Endurer" or "the Sufferer," and it is tempting to see some verbal affinity between the names of Atlas and Los, both of whom endure the endless labor of sustaining the universe from within.20 Los sustains "the Egg form'd World" with hands alone, however, instead of with shoulders and hands, as Atlas does. "Los continual builds the Mundane Shell" (pi. 34:31); he sustains it by manually creating it, and in this he resembles the creative Logos of Christian theology, from whom his name may, in fact, be a logogriphic derivation. For Blake, of course, the Logos is not Hellenistic Reason but creative Imagination. Jesus, the Logos incarnate, is, for Blake, inspired Imagination, and in Milton Jesus has close affinity with Los. The hands that endlessly create the world also, and simultaneously, shape and contain the flames of Satan, who "never can be redeem'd/ But must be Created continually moment by moment" (pi. 11:19-20). The creation of the world and of Satan are interrelated aspects of Los's fundamentally satiric art; he is giving form to rationalistic error, which would otherwise proliferate infinitely. The creation of Satan in particular involves for Los "continual labouring in the Furnaces of Golgonooza" (pi. 31:26). "Satan Refusing Form" flames up (pi. 3:41), but Los casts "him down into the Lake/ Of Los, that ever burneth with fire" (pi. 39:11-12). This is the Lake of Udan-Adan, in which the fingertips of Los appear to be immersed at the bottom of the egg-shape in Blake's illumination. The sons of Urizen labor on the verge of this lake on behalf of Satan (pi. 27:49); in a sense, they help to fuel his flames. If Los resembles the Logos because he creates the world, he also resembles the Logos incarnate in this combat with Satan, for near the opening of Milton the Bard sings about the hand of Jesus: "The Divine Hand bound the Two Limits: first of Opacity, then of Contraction/ Opacity was named Satan, Con traction was named Adam" (pi. 13:20-21). The primordial separation achieved by "The Divine Hand" is continued throughout time by the hands of Los. The hands in the illumination that symbolize the creative struggle of Los also typify sons, "the Elohim" or the Creators, who ceaselessly labor with him. These sons divert "spectres" from Satanic cruelty by endowing them with human lineaments as the "spectres" pass into generation. All "Nature is a Vision of the Science of the Elohim" (pi. 29:65), but science here is primarily artistic technique, which is exemplified by one son in particular who seems especially deft with his hands. As "spectres" come to him, Antamon takes them into his beautiful flexible hands, As the Sower takes the seed, or as the Artist his clay Or fine wax, to mould artful a model for golden armaments. The soft hands of Antamon draw the indelible line : Form immortal with golden pen; such as the Spectre admiring Puts on the sweet form; then smiles Antamon bright thro his windows. (pi. 28:13-18)</page><page sequence="10">20 Thomas Dilworth And while Antamon's "soft hands" make bodies, other sons of Los make lengths of time : "Day &amp; Month &amp; Ages &amp; Periods... all are the work of Fairy hands" (pi. 28:45,60). The "flexible hands" and "soft hands" of the sons of Los suggest why hands in Milton have special artistic associations. Hands are the aboriginal instru ments of art, of course, but they seem also to symbolize touch—for Blake the only sense that allows man to "pass out" to eternity "what time he pleases" {Europe, iii: 1-6). Touch opens to eternity because it alone retains something of the prelapsarian "flexibility" of the senses.21 Of all the parts of the body, hands are, moreover, the most flexible. The visionary potential of touch has been discussed by many Blake critics with respect to sexual ecstasy, but touch may also climax in artistic ecstasy. This is implied in Milton by Blake's equation of "the Sense of Touch" with the "Cultivated land" of Allamanda encircling Golgonooza. In Allamanda, "the Sons of Los labour" through art "against Death Eternal" (pi. 27:42-46). The children of Los themselves imply special artistic and mystical status for the sense of touch when they sing that the eye, the ear, the nostrils and the tongue take in only "the Vegetable Ratio." About the sense of touch they say nothing—except a passing but sig nificant remark about "the pure melodious harp struck by a hand divine" (pi. 5:20-31). Such a hand belongs to the Bard who sings prophetic truth to Milton, and announces near the end of his song, "I touch the heavens as an instrument to glorify the Lord" (pi. 13:29). Because the hands illuminated in plate thirty-six reach out from Urthona, they belong to Los and typify his sons, but they seem also to reach from the more constricted circle of Adam within Urthona. The suggestion is that the hands may also be those of man, at least in so far as man partakes in the artistic nature of Urthona or, within the Mundane Shell, of Los. Two such men in the poem are Milton and Blake. Milton in heaven listens to the Bard narrate Satan's usurpation of Palama bron's poetic role. As a result, Milton becomes aware of his own puritanical betrayal of visionary art, and leaves heaven in order to correct his mistake. In plate thirty-six, Milton's track takes him to the center of Adam's circle, which is his proper sphere because he is a man. Milton is further identified with Adam, as Foster Damon was the first to notice, by a bilingual pun on his name: fuiXrov is Greek (accusative case) for red ochre, and recalls the red clay of which Adam is made. When Milton wrestles Urizen in Book I, he gives him "new flesh" with his bare hands and "as a sculptor" (pi. 20:8) by taking "of the red clay of Succoth" and "moulding it with care/ Between his palms..." (pi. 19:10-11). As the pun on Milton's name suggests, the poet uses as modeling clay the substance of his own humanity. In Book II, Milton repeats the creative battle of Book I as he confronts Satan, who resembles "a ruind building of God not made with hands" (pi. 39:54-55). In each case, Milton is being tempted to accommodate the enemy within him self, as he did during his life as a puritan by representing Urizen and Satan as God the Father and the Son. Now Milton succeeds in manually giving</page><page sequence="11">Blake 's Multistable Imagery 21 Fig. 8. Plate eighteen of Milton. Urizen and Satan proper external form, objectifying them in what Blake calls, in Jerusalem, "the body of Falsehood that it may be cast off for ever" (pi. 12:13). Milton's sculpting of Urizen is illuminated in plate eighteen (Fig. 8), where the hands of the poet are visible roughly to the same degree and in the same proportions as the hands in plate thirty-six. In plate eighteen, Milton's sculp ting is, furthermore, identified with the musical dance above it, with Milton corresponding to the figure of the Bard playing the harp directly overhead. This is the Bard whose song enlightens Milton at the start. In a sense, he now lives in Milton as Milton will live in Blake, for, after singing, the Bard symboli cally merges with his audience by taking "refuge in Milton's breast" (pi. 14:19). Fig. 8. Plate eighteen of Milton.</page><page sequence="12">22 Thomas Dilworth Fig. 9. The Title-page of Milton. The hands of Milton receive further visual emphasis on the poem's title-page where, as in plate eighteen, Milton's back faces the viewer (Fig. 9). In the title-page, both hands are open wide, and the right one plunges forward into the flames and smoke like the hands on plate thirty-six that plunge into flames. Blake, too, uses artistic hands, as the first-person narrator of the poem, and as the mythological self-projection named Palamabron in the Bard's song. The "cold hand of clay," with which Blake says he writes (pi. 20:17), recalls Milton's hands and the red clay Milton uses to shape Urizen. The fusion of clay and hand in a single image suggests that authentic art involves for Blake an interior struggle like that which Milton undergoes. At the opening of the Fig. 9. The Title-page of Milton.</page><page sequence="13">Blake 's Multistable Imagery 23 Fig. 10. Plate ten of Milton. poem, Blake invokes the muses of poetry to "Come into my hand" (pi. 2:5). The invocation is not merely an evocation of the opening of Paradise Lost; Blake really does need help. Like Palamabron in the Bard's song which Milton listens to in Book I, Blake has, in a parody of true self-annihilation, allowed Satan (the poet Hayley) to usurp the harrow of poetry and generate chaos. In the Bard's song, this disorder is depicted as Satan testifies before the assembly of heaven (Fig. 10). He rages unchecked because hands that should plunge forward to contain his flames are turned away by Rintrah (or Los) and wrung together by cringing Palamabron. In the Bard's song, Los corrects this dis order by commanding, "let each his own station/ Keep" (pi. 7:41-42)—Satan's Fig. 10. Plate ten of Milton.</page><page sequence="14">24 Thomas Dilworth Station being "Beneath the Plow of Rintrah &amp; the Harrow of the Almighty/ In the hands of Palamabron" (pi. 4:1-2). For Blake as a narrative persona, correction comes in Book II with authentic self-annihilation, which coincides with his personal assimilation of Milton and Los. This event also entails for Milton and Los the self-annihilation which is essential to all true art, and which has as its primary visual metaphor the multistable image in plate thirty-six. The hands in this illumination are subtly or minimally rendered because they are engaged in self-annihilation : they exist not for themselves but only to shape and contain the flames of Satan.22 Milton's emanation describes the act of self-annihilation as "giving thy life to thy enemies" (pi. 40:8). This may ironically describe the satiric art of Blake, but it also applies without irony, for satire requires the annihilation of pity, which is a form of self-projection, and which had been the fault of Palamabron with Satan and of Blake with Hayley. Self-annihilation is, moreover, prerequisite to all true art, for clarity of vision demands the sacrifice of ego. This is why true art is made only in Golgonooza, which appears to be named for Golgotha, the place of self sacrifice. In Milton, Blake writes of certain London artists, himself included, that "Between South Molton Street &amp; Stratford Place: Calvarys foot/...the Victims were preparing for Sacrifice" (pi. 4:21-22). The central paradox of human existence is that in losing your life you find it. And for the Blakean artist, the burning consummation of self is a revelation of "the Human Lineaments," because, in fire, Jesus burns away the "Arc &amp; Curtains" that obscure those lineaments (pi. 41:26). Only in fire do the hands of man truly exist, and then they become, each of them, "a hand divine." Or, more precisely, the hand divine, for in The Four Zoas the sons of Eden sing : Glory Glory Glory to the holy Lamb of God Who now beginneth to put off the dark Satanic body Now we behold redemption Now we know that life Eternal Depends alone upon the Universal hand &amp; not in us Is aught but death In individual weakness sorrow &amp; pain.... (pi. 104:6-10) The multistable image in plate thirty-six illuminates the whole of Milton, because the entire poem is, in a sense, an extended definition of self-annihilation. Because the concept is central to Blake's fully developed myth, moreover, the application of Blake's multistable image extends beyond the limits of Milton to all of his later poetry. Conceptually at least, the illumination in plate thirty-six is the counterpart of the famous frontispiece of Europe (Fig. 11), which likewise has broad application to Blake's work.23 This illumination depicts Urizen engaged in physical creation, which for Blake equates with the Fall. The hand of Urizen-Jehovah is extended in a cold mechanical compass which imposes the diameter of his own sphere. It is an image of science and egoistic self-projection. In contrast to the closed, self-contained posture of this Jehovah, whose hand does not touch what he creates, are the open and completely engaged hands in plate thirty-six, which are, moreover, consumed by their creative act. These hands ultimately belong to Jesus, whose artistic self-immolation redeems physical creation and reverses the Fall.</page><page sequence="15">Blake 's Multistable Imagery 25 Fig. 11. The Frontispiece of Europe. Because the illumination in plate thirty-six involves the only multistable image so far noticed in Blake's work, it expands our sense of his technical and conceptual repertoire. We have seen how the near invisibility of the hands illustrates self-annihilation. There is a further, circumstantial aspect to this signification. Like all pictures, Blake's illuminations are, aside from their representational aspect, primarily autonymous and only secondarily referen tial. But Blake's multistable image relies for its symbolic meaning, and even for its visual plausibility, entirely on its literary context—and not, as with most of Blake's illuminations, on a particular local section of text but on the entire poem. Blake must have known that the likelihood of his image being Fig. 11. The Frontispiece of Europe.</page><page sequence="16">26 Thomas Dilworth noticed at all would be minimal. Blake the visual artist has annihilated him self, therefore, before Blake the poet. The result, once the image is noticed, is mutually enhancing. The poem gains remarkable visual focus which cap tures the conceptual simultaneity and anagogical completion of all its acts of artistic creation. And by losing himself to the poet, the visual artist achieves an image so subtle and expressive that it alters our assessment of his art and of the symbolic potential of multistability in the visual arts. NOTES 1/ As symbolic of artistic creation, hands first become important in The Four Zoos and remain important in Jerusalem but the image of artistic hands appears with disproportionate frequency in Milton—1 times in Milton's 48 pages of text. In The Four Zoas (103 pages) the image occurs 11 times, and in Jerusalem (113 pages) it occurs 8 times in the text and, I think, with much less visual emphasis in the illuminations.

Behrendt of the University of Nebraska for introducing me to the tradition of multistable caricatures in the eighteenth century. 2/ W.J.T.
