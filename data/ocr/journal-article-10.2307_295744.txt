<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. By H. J. ROSE. Livy i, I8, 6, describing the accession of the second King of Rome, provides food for much thought on the part of those who are interested in the religious ideas of early Italy, and gives us the material for a brisk controversy which is far from being settled. Despite there- fore the familiar contents of this passage, I quote the part of it which is most important for our purpose. Accitus . . . de se quoque deos consuli iussit. inde ab augure, cui deinde honoris ergo publicum id perpetuumque sacerdotium fuit, deductus in arcem, in lapide ad meridiem uersus consedit. augur ad laeuam eius . . . dextras ad meridiem partes, laeuas ad septentrionem esse dixit. Numa then is facing south; the augur is facing east. Both are engaged in the same important ceremony. Why do they not look the same way, but at right angles to each other, and what is the significance of their respective attitudes ? That Livy is describing an historical event, no one of course now believes. Neither is it necessary for us to suppose that the procedure as he describes it is very old; indeed I hope to show that it cannot, as it stands, belong to the very oldest period, quite apart from the nice legal question raised by Mommsen whether a king of Rome, not being simply a rex sacrorum, could be inaugurated at all. But, considering how keen and accurate is Livy's fair for religious matters, and how thoroughly he contrives in discussing them to 'make his very mind ancient,' as he elsewhere says, we cannot simply neglect his statement, or suppose, as we might for instance do in dealing with Plutarch or Dionysios of Halikarnassos, that he had misunderstood his sources. This impression of his reliability is strengthened when we find the great Varro himself supporting the southward position and possibly the eastward also in sacral matters, and find further that both Numa and the augur can invoke the very respectable authorities of Cicero, Verrius Flaccus, Frontinus the gromaticus, and the sources of the already mentioned Greek historians, to prove that they knew their business. Let us begin with the augur, whose professional reputation is at stake in the matter. Isidore,1 whose miscellaneous compilation contains much good learning, says of the templum: locus designatus ad orientem a contemplatione templum dicitur. cuius partes quattuor erant, antica ad ortum, postica ad occasum, sinistra ad septentrionem, 1 Etymol. xv, 4, 7.</page><page sequence="2">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. dextra ad meridiem spectans. unde et quando templum construebant, orientem spectabant aequinoctialem . . . ut qui consuleret atque precaretur rectum aspiceret orientem. The resemblance to Varro, de ling. Lat. vii, 7 is strong, so far as language goes, and the etymon seems derived from ibid. 9. The interpolated Servius on Aen. ii, 693, has the same doctrine: sinistras autem partes septentrionales esse augurum disciplina consentit, et ideo ex ipsa parte significatiora esse fulmina, quoniam altiora et uiciniora domicilio Iouis. Much earlier than either of these is Dionysios who draws, as he himself tells us, on very good Roman sources. Speaking of Romulus' augural contest with his brother, he states1 that a flash of lightning came from the left, 'now the Romans consider lightning from left to right of good omen, whether they were taught this by the Etruscans or whether their fathers so instructed them, for some such reason, I suppose, as the following. The best position for the augur to sit in is facing the east, whence comes sunrise (etc.) . . . Now when we look east, the regions bearing north are on our left, those pointing south on our right. But the former are by nature more honourable than the latter, for the celestial axis rises northward.' Plutarch2 cites from Juba of Mauretania a similar statement about the north, adding 'and this some consider the right or upper side of the universe.' ' Some' apparently means or includes Empedokles, who held3 that the summer tropic was the right-hand side, the winter the left-hand side of the heavens. We may add that Ovid, without giving any such high philosophic reasons, says4 that the prayer uttered at the Parilia should be made four times, in an eastward position (conuersus ad ortum dic quater). But Numa, if at variance with his own augur, had at least, could he have known it, the support of two notable members of the future college. Writing in B.c. 44, Cicero, who had himself been co-opted augur in B.C. 53, says that Attus Navius in his search for the famous bunch of grapes ad meridiem spectans in uine a media dicitur constitisse. 5 Augury was not then at its best; but Cicero took a more than dilettante interest in such matters, as the speech De domo sua, to say nothing of the De diuinatione itself and the lost De auguriis abundantly testifies. Moreover, Varro gives him abundant support. Eius templi partes, he says, 6 quattuor dicuntur, sinistra ab oriente, dextra ab occasu, antica ad meridiem, postica ad septentrionem. Again, Verrius Flaccus held the same view; his words are thus epitomised by Paulus Diaconus7 ; sic etiam et caeli pars quae sole illustratur ad meridiem, antica nominatur, quae ad septentrionem, postica. Finally, we have the Antiqluit. Rom. ii, 5, 2-3. 5 De diuinatione i, 3I. 2 Quaestiones Romanae 78. 6 De ling. Lat. vii, 7. 3 Ps.-Plut, De plac. philos. ii, 888 b. 7 P. 276 Th., zzo M. 4 Fasti iv, 776. 83</page><page sequence="3">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. testimony of Frontinus that in Campania the decumanus ran north- south; est kardo in orientem et decumanus in meridiem. This he interprets as an eastward position, and denounces as contra sanam rationem ; but it seems, whether unsound or not, to be a southward position. The fact at all events the Capitoline temple fronted more or less south indicates the same practice. But Frontinus in the same passage mentions yet another position, which he assures us is the only true one and supported by Varro (as usual), by certain architects and by the disciplina Etrusca, which is the origin of all land-surveying: quod aruspices orbem terrarum in duas partes diuiserunt, dextram appellauerunt quae septentrioni subiaceret, sinistram quae ad meridianum terrae esset, ab oriente ad occasum, quod eo sol et luna spectant, sicut quidam architecti delubra in occi- dentem recte spectare scripserunt. That the statement about the architects is true we may learn from Vitruvius, iv, 5, I, who gives as the reason that it enables the wor- shippers to face east. That his theory was universally followed at any time or place does not appear; Nissen (Templum, p. 228) says very truly, as his own elaborate surveys show, ' Die italischen Tempel sind so ziemlich nach alien Theilen der Windrose orientirt.' And if we ask why, Vitruvius in the passages already cited gives us a string of reasons theoretical and practical. Some of them have reference to what I call terrestrial orientation, a matter which cannot be discussed here. The facts remain, that a Greek temple was generally built so as to look to the sunrise; that an Italian temple, in our sense of the word (i.e. an aedes sacra), might in practice, if not in theory, face any way at all; and that even a Greek temple not infrequently ran north-south. I am inclined, in accordance with my general views on the subject, to suppose that the Greek temple, being in the most concrete sense the house of a god, was arranged as it was for no mystical or religious reason, but merely to enable its divine tenant to tell the time of day, or of the year, by the position of the sun.2 But with regard to the Italian templum, we have seen that some said it should face east, some south, and some west. Let us now try if we can narrow these views down in any way. The westward position I think need not detain us very long. It rests on the solid fact that the decumanus normally ran east and west; but need we accept the further statement that it ran east to west ? Frontinus says it should, because that is the way the sun and moon go; but it appears, as a matter of fact, that it ran both ways from the centre, for that was where the groma was placed in 1 Gromatici, p. 29, 4, Lachmann. Hyginus p. I69, ltemplum was a different thing from the augur's r4 sqq. merely repeats Frontinus, adding, postea (Wissowa, art. Augures, in Pauly-Wissowa ii, 2339) placuit omsnem religionem eo conuertere ex qua parte seems to me a groundless idea. caeli terra inluminaitur. That the land surveyor's 2 See y.R.A,.I, 1922, p. 135. 84</page><page sequence="4">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. surveying (cf. n. 3). This reason and that of Vitruvius sound more like a theoretical interpretation of the facts than a ritual reason inherited from priestly surveyors and architects of the remote past. It is to be remembered that in the days of Frontinus and Vitruvius, and indeed some time before the earlier of them was born, astronomical or astrological interpretations of the facts of cult were rife. Already in Euripides we get Apollo identified with the Sun,1 and Vitruvius' great contemporary Vergil declares that Bacchus and Ceres are no other than the sun and moon.2 Moreover, as will be shown presently, the question of the right and left sides of heaven had agitated Greek philosophers since the days of Pythagoras. I am inclined therefore to reject the westward position altogether, since I find no facts of cult to support it; that is, I nowhere find it stated that an Italian augur should or did face west to take the omens, or that one should or regularly did face west to pray. At most, Frontinus' view may reflect the practice of those unskilled surveyors who (he tells us)3 knew no better than to fancy that the sun always rose due east. If they started to work early in the morning, as it appears they usually did, this pleasing delusion would no doubt move them to start their decumanus by simply sighting along their own shadows, and therefore to begin it by drawing an east to west line. But before going any further I wish to dispose of a whole series of passages which have, to my mind quite wrongly, been pressed into the discussion. These are the various references to the turn in prayer.4 If they are carefully examined, they will be found (as Nissen rightly sees) to signify that the worshipper, having finished his prayer, turned right around; ' Vertuntur in orbem,' says Valerius Flaccus. ' Totum corpus circumagimus,' Pliny states it. Plutarch in the Life of Numa is the most explicit of all. Applying, not for the first or the only time, Greek ideas to Roman facts, he says that the worshipper is facing west, i.e. towards the cult-statue in the temple, supposing that to have its commoner Greek position. He therefore 'is turned away from the east,' and seems now 'to change his position in that direction [i.e. eastward] and turn towards the god [viz. the sun ].' As we have seen that the Italian aedes sacrae followed no fixed principle in matters of orientation, and as we have no reason to believe that the custom of turning was observed in temples only, we must I think leave out of count all reference to the eastward or I Eurip.

Rom. 25, non conuenerit. ad fin.</page><page sequence="5">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. any other position. There is another and a better magical reason. The worshipper has invoked a god; but, as he who sees a god dies, he follows the good magical rule of nec respexeris. Moreover he is going out of the holy place, if he is in one, and therefore must get rid of his state of sacredness and become profane again; therefore he turns away from the res sacrae and sits quietly down for a while, to let the sacredness pass off. This, it is true, would make him end his ritual facing west, if he had prayed as Ovid recommends, ' conuersus ad ortum.' But the way one comes out of church, however much it may have become regulated by usage, is not in itself any part of a church service; nor is the turn any part of a Roman prayer as such. Naturally, like all movements, it was made in the lucky direction, sunwise; ' si deos salutas, dextrouorsum (sc., te uortas) censeo,' says Plautus. Why the Gauls turned ' widershins,' as Pliny states, is a curious question on which I can throw no light. I come now to the southward position, and would at once note that it, and it alone, can produce strong archaeological evidence in its favour, namely, buildings and other objects demonstrably Italian and not Greek, visibly turned south or southerly. Three important temples of Etruscan workmanship-the Capitol, the temple at Vulsinii, and that at Falerii-all face either due or almost due south. 1 Here however the matter is complicated beyond all possibility of full discussion here by the system of assigning to various deities the whole circle of the heavens, for which I can but refer to the large and growing literature that centres round the bronze liver of Piacenza. Tombs, however, do not seem to be affected by this, and it can still be said, though the statement of Miiller on the subject 2 requires modification, that the typical developed Etruscan sepulchre tends to face south. Most important of all for our purpose is the fact, incidentally revealed by Cicero, that the augurs on the augura- culum looked south; for he tells us that they made Ti. Claudius Centumalus knock down part of his house on the Caelian, because it was in their line of sight.3 Where exactly on the Caelian it was, no one knows, but if we take the average position, its bearing would be about SSE.-SE. from the arx, certainly not east, still less west. Moreover, if we try to trace the Etruscan templum back to its origins, there can I think be but little doubt that its ancestor is the terramara. According to E. H. Peet4 ' the typical terramara . . . is . . . trapezoidal in shape, with its east and west sides parallel and running roughly north and south.' That is, the only dimension which can be said to point very definitely anywhere, the long axis, points the way Numa faced; for that it is not meant to point north 1 Platner, Ancient Rome, p. 298; Martha, L'art further my articles, J.R.A.I.

See 4 Stone and Bronze Ages in Italy, p. 34r. 86</page><page sequence="6">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. is, I think, pretty certain; the people who built the terremare came from the north, and it is reasonable to suppose that they turned the front of their fortified positions in the direction of the yet un- conquered land, not back the way they had come. It is only when the southward position tries to justify itself that I begin to have my suspicions. There is preserved in Festus a quotation from Varro's Epistolicae quaestiones, 1 which runs as follows: a deorum sede cum in meridiem spectes, ad sinistram sunt parte[s] mundi exorientes, ad dexteram occidentes; factum arbitror, ut sinistra meliora auspicia quam dextra esse existimentur. Festus (i.e. Verrius Flaccus) adds: ' idem Jere sentiunt Sinnius Capito et Cincius.' Plutarch (Quaest. Rom. 76), whom I believe to have made much use of Verrius, makes a similar assertion; Servius on Aen. ii, 54, says: ct sciendum laeuum, cum de humanis rebus est, esse contrarium, cum de caelestibus prosperum . . . quia sinistra numinum intuentibus dextra sunt, with which the interpolated Servius, ibid. 693, agrees. This sounds very well, and is generally accepted by writers on Etruria, such as Miller; but to my mind it is too reminiscent of the discussion in Aristotle, De Caelo ii, 284b, 6 sqq. as to whether the heavens have a right and a left side. Aristotle's conclusion is that they have, that the right side of the sky is the east, the direction from which its motion comes; that the south pole is the top, and the north pole the bottom. Empedokles, as we have already seen, and Pythagoras or his followers, as Aristotle mentions, had already started the discussion. Translating what he says into theological or mythical language, and substituting more or less anthropomorphic gods for a spherical sky, we surely get the deorum sedes, not upside- down with its foundation on our zenith, but simply looking south. I conclude then that, while the southward position itself is quite real, the reasons for it are fanciful and come from that storehouse of theology, Greece. We have now to determine the standing of the eastward position in augury. That it existed, the passages above quoted prove sufficiently; why it existed is less obvious. Bouche-Leclerq makes an attempt at reconciliation2 ' La conclusion a tirer ' he says, ' ... est que le temple augural romain etait tourne theoretiquement vers le midi et pratiquement vers l'orient; c'est-a-dire que le magistrat auspiciant dirige son regard suivant le cardo ou meridien, mais que l'augure assistant, determine suivant le coutume a ne voir que les presages heureux, se tourne invariablement du cote ou il les attend. Pour lui, le decumanus devient la ligne principale,' etc. Unfortunately, this explanation breaks down for several reasons. In the first place, it is only in the passage of Livy from which we 87 1 pp. 502, 339' 2 Hist. de la diz ination dans l'antiquite, iv, p. I88.</page><page sequence="7">THE INAUGURATION OF NUMA. started that we get such a distinction between augur and magistrate, and we shall see presently that attempts to account for the two orientations are older than Livy. Secondly, while it is very true that in the decay of augury, only those omens which the consultant wanted were observed, what right have we to assume that the neglect of the rest was so blatant as to show itself in the position regularly assumed by him ? Thirdly, the southward position is shown by the passages above cited from Cicero to have been an augural one. Finally, the ancients when they tried to reconcile the two positions never suggested that the augur was facing the favourable omens, but argued that he was still looking for left-hand ones, i.e. for signs from the north. I have already quoted Dionysios of Halikarnassos and King Juba for this view; the latter was some eleven or twelve years younger than Livy, the former about the same age; their sources therefore, since neither is likely to have originated the idea, would naturally be older than Livy, even where we cannot definitely prove them to be so. 1 But the mere fact that they tried, or that their authorities tried, to explain the eastward position in terms of the southward, surely indicates that both were actually in use and also that the latter was felt to be in some way the more correct. Is the eastward position native to the people who evolved the south- ward, be they terremarecoli or other, and if it is not, from what people does it derive ? That it is native I do not believe. To have two orientations for a grave or a temple, at right angles to one another, is a thing which happens and for which I can see a reason; but surely in augury, as in any science or pseudo-science which involves accurate observation of spatial phenomena, the first requisite is a view- point fixed with reference to some known datum. Of what use is the mapping of the heavens and earth into the most elaborate quarters and sub-quarters, if it is not clearly recognised which division is which ? I cannot conceive the augurs of any one people or race so handicapping themselves at the outset of constructing the theory of their science. Still less can I accept Wissowa's idea2 that the augur might face any way he chose. If then the eastward position was not native to the users of the southward position, whence did it come ? We can definitely rule out Greek influence here. If there is one thing certain, it is that the position of the Greek augur was and remained northward. The famous passage in Homer, M 237 sqq. puts this beyond doubt for early times: tV- t' OtWVOwcrtL rcaVvvrrepVye'cOt KEXEeFVeL ire8OerOax, -rOv o6 rt teeraTrpireTo' ov6' dXeyiLw, ei ' e7drt et' Iswt ' irp6s r' T 7E\Xt6v Te, e r' r ca pio-repa rot ye rorl '65 ov ?ep6evra. 1 Livy was born B.c. 59; Juba was brought to 2 Op. cit. 2341.

Some 500 years or so after Homer, the same doctrine recurs in Plato ; To 8' 'it 8et&amp;o yLyviaO TO pOqS eco. 1 It is true that Plato is not there discussing divination, but the context is not without a tinge of magico-religious ideas, and in any case it is the equation right =east that concerns us. The passage of Aristotle already quoted makes the same assumption and finds ingenious reasons for it. One or two later references will be found in Wyttenbach's note on Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. 78. Against this I know of but one passage in a good author, i.e. one reasonably likely to be giving pure Greek ideas; that is Hippokrates (Kihlwein 8, Kiihn, p. 30), c*Lp 8c[T7; aovo?), where it is mentioned incidentally that ztv'Cz-S will consider the same bird lucky if on the left, unlucky if on the right. But augury was a complicated business, and depended on other things besides the position of the birds. The passage is so short that little can be concluded from it, and even our imperfect know- ledge of Greek divination enables us to imagine ways in which the statement might be reconciled with the northward position.2 If then the eastward position is not Greek and not native to the bronze (terramara) civilization of Italy, whence comes it ? I venture to suggest that it is Villanovan. Here I would say incidentally that despite Pignorini's view that the Villanovan civilization is derived from that of the terremare and despite the agreement of Prof. L. R. Taylor therewith (Cults of Etruria, p. 2), I am still of Modestov's opinion that the two cultures belong to different peoples. It is quite true that there exist connecting links between them, in the shape of sepulchral finds partaking of the characteristics of both.3 But need this prove more than that they were in contact, as invaders and invaded naturally would be, and that they influenced one another in consequence, perhaps intermarrying, as I believe them to have done at Rome, and producing a mixed race which had some of the characteristics of both its ancestors ? On the other theory then, that the Villanovan civilization is akin to that of Halls.tatt, we may first note that in Hallstatt the graves commonly run east to west (Dechelette, Manuel, ii, p. 603), suggesting that that position had some religious significance. Further, we may note that there is admittedly considerable resemblance between this civilization and that of the Kelts, without necessarily accepting the ingenious theories of Mr. Harold Peake on the relationship between the two. Prominent among these we may reckon the philological fact that Italic and Keltic are more closely related to each other than to any third linguistic group. For instance, they alone have I De legg. vi, 760 d. to Roman ritual, we get the corresponding phen- 2 E.g. if an unlucky bird, such as a screech-owl, omenon there; some birds are lucky when in the was seen to the left or west, might that not mean direction opposite to the normally lucky one, that ill-luck was setting or weakening, and there- i.e. right instead of left. fore be equivalent to a good omen ?

It is therefore noteworthy that in Keltic ' left ' means north and '-right' means south. The facts are as follows.1 Cle in Irish, cledd in Welsh, means 'left,' 'left-hand,' as far back as we can trace the languages; the glosses which are our oldest evidence give, in Welsh, or cled hin for limite laeuo, in Irish, laim chli for a sinistris. The word, in its simple form, takes on the usual magical connotations of 'left,' i.e.' adverse,' 'inauspicious,' 'clumsy,' etc. But with a prefix which appears in Irish as fo, in Welsh as go, we get the compounds fochla, the north, especially the North of Ireland, and gogled, 'north.' The word for ' right,' cognate with dexter, is in Irish dess, hence laim deis, ad manum dextram. In Welsh it is deheu. This word appears in both languages in phrases meaning ' south'; Irish des-cert is regio meridionalis; Welsh deheu is ' south,' or especially ' South Wales,' more commonly known as Deheudir or Deheubarth, 'the right-hand land,' 'right-hand part,' dextralis pars britannie in the Liber Landauensis. For ' east,' there is no Keltic word; Welsh calls it ' the rising,' dwyrain, while in Irish it is air, air, a word with curious derivatives, viz. airech (primus), airechas (principatus), airechus (' supremacy '). The east then was simply assumed as known, or if mentioned, was called 'the chief, principal place,' i.e. the quarter from which the others were reckoned. I venture therefore to suggest that what happened was something like this. The Villanovans, when they reached Italy, brought with them a system of divination which involved facing the east to look for omens-probably omens from birds, alone or among others, since the Iguvian Tables mention them. But they found already prevalent, among the bronze-using peoples whom they encountered, another system which had the south as its hieratic quarter. In Etruria and in Latium, where they clashed with this civilization but were not able to overcome it, or overcame it only in part, they so far succeeded as to gain a footing for their ideas alongside of the old ones. The result has been much confusion to the augural art in later ages. NOTE.-(I) The author wishes to thank Prof. Stuart Jones and Dr. G. Macdonald for some pertinent criticisms on the original draft of this article. (2) For a totally different handling of the problem of orientation, see A. L.

I do not find, however, that his main contention (that there were three orientations, used each for a different sacral purpose) is supported by the Italian evidence, however likely it may be for other regions. 1 I owe mv information to the learning and courtesy of a Welsh colleague, Mr. Timothy Lewis. 90</page></plain_text>
